I made this for the first time today, it was AWSOME! I did make some changes, I used a whole chicken and stuffed the cavity with one onion cut up in quarters and 3 cloves of crushed garlic. I also used poultry seasoning, garlic powder, Mrs. Dash, and paprika to season the chicken with. I used the foil balls, but put 2 cups of chicken broth on the bottom, and put the slow cooker on high for two hours and then turned it on low for 5 hours and it came out Great! It didn't fall off the bone because I didn't want to over cook it, but it was SO tender, I didn't even need a knife to cut it! My kids ate it all, I was hoping for leftovers for chicken salad, but there was none!

This recipe was simple and it made "fall off the bone" chicken. I used 5 chicken legs (skin removed) and cooked it on low for 9 hours. Instead of using the alluminum foil, I used potatoes (peeled and quartered) and carrots and onions under the chicken in the crock-pot. I added 1/2 c. chicken broth and lots of seasoned salt and pepper, too. The veggies were nice and soft and the flavor of this slow cooking was wonderful and EASY !!! Thanks 'Cotton' !!!

I used a 4.5 chicken.  I rubbed butter all over and then sprinkled it generously with salt, pepper, garlic salt, seasoning salt, paprika and poultry seasoning.  I put it on low and cooked it for about 11 hrs while I was at work.  When we got home, it smelled wonderful!  I used some of the juice from the bottom to drizzle over the chicken.  It had a light golden color and looked very good.  There was no point trying to pick it up because it fell apart soon as I tried. The meat was very tender and juicy.  Only thing I would change is to remove all the skin from the chicken next time before seasoning.  The skin slid right off when it fell apart and so, naturally, a lot of the flavoring was gone.  The only other thing I may try to different if I leave the skin on is to try and buy those flavor injectors, to get some more of the flavoring down into the meat.  Otherwise, outstanding!

Okay you all!  I got this perfected!!I tried this recipe a couple of times when I was in a hurry and found the chicken just average..I wanted CRISPY crust.  The secret?  Brown the chicken first in cooking oil AND THEN  put it in the slow cooker...Oh my God. To die for.

I didn't give this 5 stars only because I changed the recipe so much. I was concerned about using the foil so I used coarsely chopped onion, carrot and garlic on the bottom of the slow cooker. I liberally seasoned the chicken (I used a 3 pounder) with salt, pepper, paprika, and rotisserie chicken seasoning. I also placed some of the chopped veggies in the chicken cavity. To make sure the chicken didn't dry out, I added about 1 1/2 cups of apple wine I had on hand. I cooked the chicken on low for about 8 1/2 hours and it turned out great. Very flavorful and moist. When it was done, I fished out the veggies and strained the liquid. I thickened it just a little with cornstarch and served the sauce over the chicken with cooked white rice. My husband said it was the best chicken he'd ever tasted. Thanks!

I am responding to several members' comments on the chicken falling apart when taking it out of the slowcooker. After seasoning the chicken, put it on cheeseclose, tie a loose knot, and then when it's done, you can just pick it up by the cloth and move it to a dish for carving. I use this method when I make chicken soup too, pull the meat apart and no bones to drain out.

Simple, delicious recipe. I stuffed the cavity with onion, red bell pepper & garlic. I used baby carrots & quartered potatoes under the chicken instead of the foil. I used a mixture of olive oil, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper &  minced garlic. Rub your spices under the skin like you would a turkey or the skin will be flavored & not the meat.

Very easy..chicken was juicy. I put whole celery stalks and whole carrots, onions cut in half on the bottom instead of the foil. about 1/2 cup bouillion also. Used a seasoned roaster,only added garlic powder and poultry seasoning for added flavor. Put it in breast side down and after 4 hours flipped it right side up. Cooked for another 3 hours. Meat was excellent, but the best part was the broth on the bottom..made the best chicken gravy I have ever tasted. gonna use the rest for chicken and biscuits later on. Good meal for a busy day!!

I have 10 kids and they all liked this recipe!  I did make a few additions.   I rubbed it with olive oil and I put lemon pepper, garlic salt, paprika, and onion powder on my chicken and poured a small amount of Red Wine in the bottom of the crock pot.  Would have been good with a white wine too.  It smelled so good while cooking and tasted great.  I only cooked it for approx. 6 hours otherwise it would have been too dry!

After reading the reviews I made some changes to this recipe, I used a whole 4 lb chicken and added 1/2 cup of broth to the bottom, throughout the day I added alot of spices and turned the chicken a couple of times.  The cook time was only 2 hours on high and 5 hours on low.  This was very moist and everyone in my family liked it.  I will make it again soon.

First of all, I don't know what the reviewer was talking about cause there is NOTHING in this recipe that says to cut the chicken into pieces.  THIS CHICKEN WAS OFF DA CHAIN!!!  Tender, juicy and mad flavorful.  I did use a number of different reviewers' advice:  Instead of foil, used potatoes, carrots and onion at the bottom.  Added a can and a half of chicken broth which kept it from being dry.  The key to this is how you season your meat.  Do so to YOUR LIKING.  I used poultry season, chicken rub, a Tony Chachere's seasoning salt, garlic and onion powder along with the paprika.  Also quartered an onion and put half inside the chicken with some garlic.  The other half went with the potatoes and carrots which I mentioned earlier.  I did use Tony Chachere's Creole Butter meat injector for additional flavor.  Set this on low for 9 hours and let it rock!!  Smelled EXCELLENT when I walked through the door from work.  I may add some white wine next time to see how that tastes.  The original recipe may seem basic to some but the point of cooking is to add your own touch anyway.  Do what works for you....but do it well.

This gets just three stars, because it only works with massive revisions - as is, it would be very bland. 
I placed onions and veggies (carrots and sweet potatoes this time) under the chicken instead of foil. Then, I rubbed it very generously with crushed garlic, lemon pepper, paprika and salt. I poured about 1/4 cup red wine in as well. 
To make a complete meal, I threw in a bit more wine and one cup of white rice forty-five minutes before serving. With all those changes, we loved it!

This is a great method of cooking your chicken. After trying this several times, my best hints are as follows: I brine the chicken in salt and water for several hours or overnight first. Then rinse, and COMPLETELY DRY the chicken as much as possible (With the paprika, it will help to brown the skin a little instead of boiling it!). Instead of the plain foil balls, I wash and wrap up potatoes in foil and make mashed potatoes with them afterward (I wrap them up because I don't want the chicken grease on them). I rub rotisserie chicken seasoning all over the bird and under the skin, and place the dry chicken w/ seasoning breast side down over the potato foil balls. There is no need to add any liquid, it will make plenty of juice.

I give this recipe 4 stars for the original method.. However if you doctor it up with more flavor then it is a 5 star for sure.  I have made this 3 times so far.  
Attempt #1:  Took advice from others and stuffed cavity with onions, garlic, and carrots.  Lined the bottom with onions, garlic and carrots.  Seasoned the 5 lb bird with rosemary, garlic salt, pepper, paprika, etc.. and cooked it as recipe says: 1 hr on high and then 8ish on low.  Smelled amazing walking thru the door but was dry dry dry.  We still ate it (seasonings were great and the veggies were to die for!)

Attempt #2:  5 lb bird again.. seasoned and treated same as before but reduced cooking time (on LOW) to about 6 to 7 hours.  Again.. dry.  :(

Attempt #3:  4 lb bird.  By George, this time I think I've got it.  This time I actually tried the aluminum ball technique.. generously seasoned the bird with olive oil, garlic salt, seasoned salt, paprika, diced garlic, pepper.  4 hours 30 minutes on LOW only.. divine.  

Next time I want to use potatoes as a base..  cooking is all about trial and error right?  I finally figured out a way that is delicious and tender, but you never know.. maybe I could combine the fruits of my research (or should I say veggies of my research lol) and use veggies on the bottom with a 4 lb bird and cook on low for 4.5 hours.  Yum!!

Many of the reviews were wonderful. I see that many folks opted to remove the aluminum foil balls. They then added onions, garlic, potatoes, carrots and more. Great ideas. But this recipe differs from some its "cousins" precisely because of the aluminum foil. The dome creates a moist atmosphere to cook the chicken from within. I reasoned that removing the balls was a BAD idea. So here's what I did. I cut up onion  - I've tried wedges and sliced - both are fine - and I put a bit of carrot and celery inside. It creates a "mirapoix" sort of atmosphere that transfers into the bird and makes it both flavorful and tasty. The insides tend to be a bit over done. I've added vegetables to the outside as well. Frankly they become a bit mushy. If you like mushy they're great. I've tried adding them in the last hour or two of cooking - and this seems to work OK for carrots. I make a baked potato wedge that mirrors "french fries" but is much healthier and I've tried different types of rice. Both are far superior to really mushy potato. Also the flavor doesn't transfer well into the veggies when they're outside the bird. Lastly I've added broth so that it approaches half the size of the aluminum balls - and THIS is the ideal I think. So stuff the bird, create your balls, add in a bit of broth - season the bird well with whatever you like. Remove the skin if you're trying to cut calories - and make your veggies outside the bird. Add them last minute if desired. I've made this about 12 times.

I seasoned this with my own favorite spices and put it on foil it turned out wonderful. Better than the oven actually. It was really moist and the skin was surprisingly crisp.  I decided to try it again with the reviewers suggestions of putting it on potato and onion halves and it wasnt' the same. Introducing liquid from the vegatables makes the skin not as crisp and the meat not as flavourful. Foil is absolutley the way to go with this recipe season it how you like it and you are good to go. Thanks for a great idea.

This recipe was amazing. I never thought of cooking a whole chicken in a croc pot. Great results, heres what I did. Used potatoes and onions on the bottom instead of foil, added about a cup and a half of chicken broth to the bottom also. I made a butter mixture of fresh garlic, savory,parsley, rosemary, poultry seasoning, tiger seasoning and mrs. dash. Then I put a very generous amount under the skin of the chicken and inside. I also put half an apple inside the chicken. The result, the most moist and tasty chicken I've ever made!!!! I also used the drippings for gravy, YUMMY!!!

I haven't made the recipe but have made other chicken recipes similar to this one that turned out delicious.  I just wanted to make a quick comment to those who's chicken turned out dry due to overcooking.  The biggest lesson I learned with my crock pot (and I learned it the hard way) is that cooking times vary from brand to brand.  From experience I know this chicken dish would be done perfectly in my crock pot in 6 hours with no time on high.  So that's something to keep in mind - you have to get to know your particular crock pot and adjust recipes accordingly.

This is how I've been making chicken for years.  I rate it 5 stars because it's the simplest (and I think most delicious) way to make it.  I was never able to cut a roasted chicken decently, so I love how this one just falls apart and it's very easy to strip the carcass afterward for all the extra meat.

Instead of foil balls under the chicken, I just cut a large onion into chunks and put them underneath.

I cooked a 4 lb chicken.  I followed the suggestions as others.  These where my changes 1) Instead of lining with aluminum foil is placed carrots, celery, potatoes, pearl onions and 3 cloves of garlic on the bottom.  2) I cooked it 2 hours on high and 5 hours on low and that was too long.  Next time I will do 4 hours on low.  3) I seasoned the chicken with crushed garlic and poultry seasoning along with the other recommended seasonings.  4) I added 1 cup chicken broth 5) I stuffed the chicken with 3/4 yellow onion.
Delish!  Will be making this again very soon!

What a wonderful recipe! The foil idea is genius!  I used a 5lb chicken and rubbed it with McCormick Rotisserie Seasoning..and I was heavy handed inside and outside the bird.  Also put half a vildalia onion in the cavity.  Excellent recipe..can't wait to make it again! Adding to my review.  I just made this a second time, however, I didn't have alum. foil to add to the bottom to hold  the chicken up.  The chicken turned out to taste "ok"..but the result was much better with the foil.

I knew beforehand that this chicken was not going to be that flavorful, so I made a dish that was packed with flavors (curry fried rice) to compliment it.  It balanced each other nicely.  I used onion salt instead of plain salt and cooked the chicken on high for 3 hours. I really don't think you need 8-10 hours to make chicken fall off the bone. I covered the bottom of the pot with water (made sure the water wasn't touching the chicken) and cooked it like steaming veggies.  The chicken was good; it was very moist and fell off the bone.  It has a nice, subtle flavor.  However, I suggest you pair this chicken with a flavorful dish. Nice healthy meal.  Thanks.

Great tasting, tender chicken! I used Yukon Gold potatoes and baby carrots in the bottom of the crock pot in place of the aluminum foil. Seasoned chicken (which weighed about 4 lbs.) with garlic powder and Lawrey's seasoned salt inside and out. I also put some celery and a small peeled onion in the cavity. That was it! I had a very full crock pot so I left it on high for 2 hrs. and then turned to low and left it alone for 7 hrs. The flavor of this chicken is fantastic and it is so tender! My husband said he loved coming home to such a great smelling house :) Thanks for a recipe I'll use over and over!!

I made this today and had to review it already. It turned out so good! I did follow the advice of another person and added 1 cup bouillon to it. I also mixed in some garlic powder, onion salt, and pepper to the bouillon before pouring it over the chicken. I then seasoned the top of the chicken with paprika and garlic powder. As it cooked it bubbled up and moistened the whole chicken! I also changed the cooking style a bit. I had a 5 lb. chicken and what I did was cooked it on high for the first hour as the recipe states, I then cooked it for 3 hours on low breast side down. I then turned it over to breast side up and cooked it on low for 3 more hours. After I flipped it over I also added more paprika and garlic powder on the top of the chicken. It came out so tasty and tender that the meat actually practically fell off the bone! Get's an A+ from me and I'll definitely be making this again!

It doesn't get any easier than this!  I've done this many different ways just by changing spices.  From this simple chicken to a spicy chicken to a lemon pepper chicken and so on!

My first review! I've made this 3 times now and this last time has been the best.  The 2nd time I used potatos instead of foil and shortened the cooking time to about 6.5 hours and it was alright. This time I layered the bottom with potatos, carrots, celery, and onion. I coated the bird with butter and cajun seasoning and I stopped it at 5.5 hrs. It came out great!

I have been making this dish for at least 20 years now. The difference is I place onions and celery on the bottom, and veggies on top, potatoes, carrots, green beans, are the usual suspects. I also add 1/4 package Lipton Onion soup mix with 1/2 cup water. I cook mine for approx 14 hours on low (at least) and once done it can never make it out of the crock whole because not only does the meat fall apart but the bones actually fall apart! Literally! Talk about juicy, when I first peirce the chicken it always shoots juice out, usually right in my face or blouse (I wear an apron now, LOL!) it's just unbelievable. You will never eat chicken as juicy as this, using a slow cooker is truly the best way to go. I strongly recommend to anyone who hasn't tried this version yet. You won't be sorry. Oh, it doesn't brown on the bottom like normal but that's no big deal as it's still cooked all the way through. Mine is never a pretty dish to serve but it's one of the best I could possibly serve.

I made this for dinner tonight, and as some others suggested, instead of using the foil, I put carrots and potatoes in the bottom.  I stuffed a piece of celery and some onion in the cavity, and put a cup of chicken broth and a tablespoon of minced garlic in the bottom.  I sprayed the bird with olive oil and liberally seasoned with pepper, thyme and rosemary.  It came out moist and wonderful!  I will only use 1/2 cup of broth next time, as there was so much juice from the chicken. Thank you for the recipe, I would have never thought of roasting a chicken in the slow cooker, my husband and son loved it!

you really can't go wrong here!  I have made this chicken before without the foil balls, but this helps to keep the chicken out of the drippings which will boil the chicken and overcook it.  Keeping it on the foil keeps it up away from the juice!  If you happen to have chicken pieces instead of a whole chicken, then your cooking time is significantly less.  I would check after 4-5 hours if you do that because it will cook much faster in pieces.  I always season with seasoned salt and pepper and chopped onion.  I also put a cup of water or chicken broth into the bottom of the crock pot as well.  It helps to keep it moist.  Chicken always comes out great in the crock pot! Falling off the bone because its so tender!  thanks for posting Cotton!!

I love simple & delicious. This surely was both. I followed reviewers & instead of foil, peeled 3 sweet potatoes and laid the chicken on top of them. I stuffed the chicken w/4 garlic cloves and threw some paprika & freshly ground garlic sea salt on it. I then poured some white cooking wine over the top of the chicken. I cooked on high for 1 hour and turned it to low but it was done 5 hours later, for a total of 6. The chicken was falling off the bone. The sweet potatoes were so tender. I served the chicken on top of the smashed potatoes & threw some of the broth over it all. Topped it with a little more garlic salt...we loved it!

Combined a few suggestions for an EASY EASY EASY meal: place peeled carrots and potatoes w/one C chicken broth in crockpot, omitting foil balls; season 8 piece cut-up chicken (easier serving) with Lawry's seasoning salt and pepper prior to placing on top of veggies. Slow cooked for 8 hours, it was soooo fast, easy and GOOOOOOD!!!

I gave Cotton's recipe 4 out of 5 stars because the chicken came out a sickly white color after cooking.  Even though I used a generous amount of paprika, I never did see the promised golden-brown skin.  However, the meat turned out delicious.  I used an almost 7 lb. roasting chicken cooked on high for 2 hours and then low for 6 hours.  I also used some of the earlier reviewers advice and seasoned the chicken UNDERNEATH the skin because when the skin is discarded, most of the flavor goes with it. (I just made a few cuts and folded the skin back in order to season, then just folded it back over for cooking.  You could just skin the bird beforehand, but I find it dries out the meat.)  Be generous with your seasonings, don't cook as long as stated in the recipe and plan on throwing away the unappetizing ghost-white skin and I think you will be pleased with the results.

YUM!!! All you reviewers convinced me to try this and you were right! I had never cooked a whole chicken before and I probably will never use another method again. It was so tender and the meat fell off the bone. I made cuts in the skin and rubbed lots of spices underneath like seasoned salt, Tony's, garlic powder, etc... I also melted butter and rubbed that under the skin. About half-way through I added more of the same seasonings. 8 hours on low was perfect!

Excellent recipe!  I used a whole chicken, BREAST SIDE DOWN!, but I brined it first overnight, and I think that helped the flavor a lot!  (To brine chicken:  dissolve 1/2 cup kosher salt in 1 gallon water, add chicken, refrigerate immediately and leave overnight.)  The outcome was a beautiful looking, soft, succulent, flavorful chicken, thank you!

I tried it exactly as printed. When you change a recipe so severely how in the world can you rate the published recipe?  It is getting sickening reading through all of the completely changed recipes that these people rate.  I wanted to know how THIS recipe came out not the recipes of these individuals who created new recipes.  Shame on you people.  If you are so proud of what you did send your NEW recipe in!!!

Could anything be easier? I tried it two ways: first, I used about 2 cups chicken broth and a layer of carrots and celery instead of tinfoil balls. It came out terrific. Second time, I tried it without the broth and used the tinfoil balls. I still supplemented with some aging carrots/celery to form the base. Turned out delicious and easier to not use the chicken broth. I think this is a better way than the oven to cook chicken. Just SO easy!

Awesome and Oh So Moist!  I added a ton of other seasonings as other reviewers but I'm giving this a 5 star because I would have never known that you could actually cook a whole chicken and have it come out as if it was a Rotisserie chicken in the Crock pot!

So easy and delicious. I couldn't believe that it would work so well but it did. I rubbed the chicken with a ton of herbs and spices the night before and then stuck a head of garlic inside it when I cooked it.

It came out perfectly!! Drop off the bones tender, and very tasty.

Thanks for the know-how on how to cook a whole chicken in the crock-pot! I look at this recipe more as a guideline & how to do it in the crock-pot. The spices and other things can be changed up quite a bit. After reading many of the reviews, I just went at it and created my own meal. First of all, I used a solid FROZEN whole chicken! It was about 4lbs and didn't come with the neck/giblets inside, thankfully. It worked wonderfully, which means I can now always have a whole chicken on hand, in the freezer, whenever I need it. I quartered 2 onions, put 4 whole stalks of celery and 4 whole and peeled carrots in the bottom. I then put in 2 c. of chicken broth and about 1/2 c. red wine. Then sprinkled the entire thing w/ my seasonings of choice (McCormick Grill Mates: Montreal Chicken). I rinsed and patted dry my whole, frozen chicken and smeared it with olive oil and the same seasoning. Since it was frozen, I could not get to the inside of the chicken at all. I then put the chicken on top of the veggies in the crock-pot. Cooked on high for about 5 hours, then low for another 3 hours. The chicken fell apart when I tried lifting it, which was fine. The carrots were delicious to eat, I discarded the celery & onions. I strained the liquid into a sauce pan, added some flour and whisked until smooth and simmered for a bit to make an awesome gravy. My 15yr old boy and 12yr old girl and hubby all RAVED about the meal.

I made changes, but I really enjoyed the results. I did not use the foil; my 4 1/2 pound bird was atop quartered red potatoes, baby carrots, onions and celery. I also chopped the same veggies (no potato) and stuffed them into the cavity. I blended paprika, freshly chopped garlic, sea salt, and black pepper into room temperature butter and rubbed the mixture under and over the skin.  A tablespoon of the butter went into the cavity also. My slow cooker runs hot, so I cooked everything on the low setting for 5 hours. I was able to get the bird onto the platter without the carcass collapsing, and the meat was moist, flavorful and very tasty. I made a quick gravy with a flour roux and the juices from under the meat and veggies. I think that it is important to note that I used absolutely no liquid, there is no need. The meat will make plenty of juice that can be used for gravy, a quick stock, and so on. Next time - and there WILL be a next time - I think I'll switch up seasoning, maybe use rosemary and thyme. Looking forward to the chicken salad I am making tomorrow with the small amount of leftover meat!!

Good recipe, because I never realized you could slow cook a chicken. That being said, this recipe is very basic. You can jazz it up however you like to dress your chicken. I normally stuff with garlic & onion, and outside with many different seasonings.
You do NOT need a liquid in it. Another thing I learned in the past year for ANY meats. The meat will make its own juices, so if you just threw that bad boy into the crockpot and turned it in, it will cook just right.
A note to everyone who doesn't like it soggy outside (me neither, chicken skin is the best!!), when it's done cooking, CAREFULLY (I use big spoons on either side and move slow) transfer to a cookie sheet wrapped in foil, and broil for about 15 minutes. Gets the outside good and crispy, and everyone will think you roasted a chicken.

Easy recipe, but it pays to read other reviews (the good reviews) that is. Omit foil and add chunks of your favorite vegetables red potatoes, carrots and onions are great place to start. For flavorful chicken season UNDER the skin of the breast and thighs with butter and your seasonings. I don't recommend removing the skin because that is what holds in moisture, but bland if you only season the outside. I used a vegetable dip seasoning, fresh rosemary, coarse salt and pepper. Add 1 cup chicken stock. Then sprinkled with paprika for color on the actual chicken. Cooked on low for 9-10 hours. It was DELISH and not a drop of chicken left. My 3 kids (2,2,5) loved every bite! This is a great EASY way to do chicken.

This recipe was GREAT....it was 95 degrees here today, and it was so nice to make a good meal without heating up the kitchen!!! I pretty much followed the recipe except I did not use the foil and I added a few additional spices and lemon juice. I also cooked on high for about 5 hours...the meat just fell right off the bone and we have enough leftover for our lunches tomorrow.
My husband raved about it all through dinner!!! We will make this again!! Nice job and thanks for the recipe!!!

I placed my chicken breast side down, so it would stay juicer (that's how I fix our Thanksgiving turkey also) and added fresh thyme, basil, rosemary, one clove garlic and a small onion, quartered, to the pot. It was delicious and my picky child went back for thirds!

Yummy!  The skin was nice and crisp - amazing that the aluminum foil can help do that!  Thanks for sharing!

We just finished eating this a few minutes ago! 
We moved into a new apartment a few days ago and things have been hectic, so I threw some chicken in the fridge to defrost and checked all recipes to find a slow cooker chicken.  I picked this one because it didn't take a lot of ingrediants.  I did my own variation after reading other comments, I chose to use chicken broth and potatoes instead of aluminum foil.  I didn't have carrots, but I think I will use them next time.  For spices I use paprika (a little extra), salt and pepper, garlic powder and Montreal Chicken seasoning. The potatoes and chicken has such a great flavor! I was hoping for leftovers to make chicken salad but there is none left!

I have made this chicken twice now. The first time I followed the directions exactly and it came out good! The second time, I didn't have the written directons so I put the chicken in the crock pot on top of the foil balls and an onion that was quartered. Seasoned with garlic salt, lemon pepper, greek seasoning, and salt & pepper. Then I poured a can of chicken broth & 1/2 can of water in the the pot (couldn't remember if you needed to add liquid so I played it safe). Set it on high for about 8-9 hrs and it was DELICIOUS!!! I preferred it the second time, but both ways are very good! Next time, I will not add any water and only about 1/2-3/4 can of broth. The chicken just fell of the bones and was very juicy and tender. Maybe next time I'll add some carrots & potatoes and see how that comes out. A very healthy way to cook Chicken that is YUMMY and EASY!!!!

This is GREAT!  Tasted wonderful, with leftovers and easy clean-up.  This chicken browned nicely too!  I added more paprika and poultry seasoning.  No need to cut-up the chicken -  put in a 4.5lb. chicken whole without a problem.  This is a keeper and will be made again and again!  A real time-saver.  Thanks.

We have made this several times now, and it always comes out perfectly! I followed the advice of other reviewers and always use potatoes, carrots, and onions in the bottom instead of the aluminum foil. Prep time is minimal, and the slow cooker does the rest of the work, which I love!

I followed the basic recipe however I added a couple of thing: I made a rub using garlic powder, salt, a little curry and cayenne, and lifted the skin and rubbed the meat with it and then the skin. I used 6 medium potato halves - skin up - on the bottom to rest the chicken on, and 1/2 bag of baby carrots. Two cups of veg stock and a little bit of olive oil. Cooked on high for 1 hour and on low for 7 hours turning it once. Some of the most savory and flavorful chicken I've ever had. Be advised after 8 hours you're gonna need a couple of large spoons to remove the chicken since it all falls off the bone. Potatoes and carrots were done just right and the juice in the cooker ladles over everything. WILL do again!

I love this recipe and have been making it for a couple of years.  The only thing I do differently is cook the chicken for 5 hours on high.  Comes out falling off the bone and delicious.

I was looking for a basic recipe and this was a good start.  I used quartered onions, baby carrots, 3 cloves of minced garlic and a half cup of water for the base rather than foil. I removed the skin from the chicken, rubbed with olive oil, then made of rub of oregano, paprika, fresh ground pepper, and fresh ground sea salt.  I put an onion halved into the cavity with a little rub.  I started the bird on high breast side down for 1.5 hours, then flipped it over and turned it down to low for 5.
There was a lot of juice when the bird was done, I strained it, put it in a sauce pan with a can of cream of chicken soup and enough corn starch to thicken (apx 1 tbsp).  My six year old said "this is so good I can't stop eating it"!  I was sure to write down my changes, this was one of the best whole cooked chickens I have had!

I thought this turned out excellent and so did my boyfriend. Thanks to other reviewers though I did change the recipe a bit. I put the chicken on halves of onions and I stuffed it with an onion, 3 garlic cloves, and 3 chicken bullion cubes as well as 1/2 stick of butter. I also put cubes of butter under the skin to help the flavoring get into the chicken. The I seasoned the chicken with an adobo poultry seasoning packet, very liberally, due to the comments of it turning out bland. I have to say my chicken has soo much flavor we even ate the dark meat and that NEVER happens!! 
I thought it was a great recipe but since I had to tweak it I only gave it a 4. I will be making this at LEAST once a week we love it! Thank You!
***Update...since I obviously cant have that much butter all the time, I have changed the recipe to make it healthy. I have made this recipe at least once a week since I found it and this way taste just as good than the first way I made it. I still stuff the bird with 3 garlic gloves and and onion, maybe 1 bullion cube, to cut the salt. And I now use a marinated garlic flavored injection and I inject the bird liberally in legs,breast,and all over top and bottom. I found a marinade with little salt and 0 fat!! woohoo! I also sprinkle a little cajun seasoning on the skin. This gives it great flavor and keeps it moist no matter how long I have to cook it, sometimes 10 hours before I get home!

I feel like this recipe is unique because it keeps the chicken up, out of the liquid at the bottom of the crock pot to give it a roasted or baked texture.  An earlier reviewer said using ramekins works too, instead of foil balls.  I've used the same method to dry roast baby spare ribs, using a little dry rub first.  Works great.  This is a great recipe to use to have deboned meat for other recipes.  For some reason, keeping the meat out of the juices seems to give the meat a great texture, not dry or boiled.

I have never made a whole chicken in the crock pot before this one so I had no idea what to expect. Everyone at work said that by the time I got home it would be mooshy or WAY to dried out?! But it was neither of the above. It was perfect. I put some chicken spices on it that I picked up on vacation from a spice shop and instead of the balls I cut up 1 potato and set the chicken on top. Also sliced up some onions and celery and placed an onion inside the cavity. I did put 1 can of chicken broth in because no liquid bothers me. The cut up onions were soooo good. I will definatley make this again it was super yummy!!!

I made some changes to this recipe - but LOVED the fact that it could cook for 10 hours - allowing me to set it before work and come home to dinner.  It wasn't dry at all and did not fall apart - though it was very, very moist.  I stuffed the chicken with 2 lemons (cut in half), made a paste of olive oil & my favorite spices to rub in between meat and skin and then the entire outside of the chicken.  I also added one can of chicken stock and 2 halved red & yellow peppers to the bottom of the pot.  The skin actually came out kind of crispy (maybe because of the olive oil) and I only lost 1 wing when lifting it out of the pot.  This is a great basic recipe that can be tailored to anyone's taste.  This is definitely a keeper, especially with fall & winter around the corner!!!

This chicken when cooked was very tender and succulent, not dry at all. I took a med whole chicken and cut it up. I tossed it in a large bowl with olive oil, paprika, and mixed herbs.I did not leave the skin on. I used the foil in the bottom. I placed the breasts in first and then placed all the fattier pieces on top of the breasts. I then sliced a apple and placed the pieces across the top of the chicken. I also put some shallots and garlic in. I added no liquids. I only cooked it on low because that is the only setting my cooker has and its very small also. I cooked it for the full nine hours. The meat did not fall apart and it was moist and tasty.I had about a inch of very tasty juices in the bottom of the cooker when it was finished cooking. Very pleasantly surprised!

This is an excellent recipe.  Comes out tasty every time.  For extra taste I  stuff the chicken with an apple or a pear.  I believe the reason some people don't get a crispy chicken is because they add extra water to the base, that WILL make the chicken soggy. So, add no extra liquid and you'll have a beautiful dinner.

As a college student I always crave home cooked meals. I decided to break out the crock pot. I loved this recipe. I have a 4 and a half pound chicken. I seasoned it with seasonal, onion powder, garlic powder, poultry seasoning, and salt and pepper. Instead of foil i cut up onion, carrots, and whole garlic and had that in the bottom. I cooked it on high for 1 hr and low for 5hrs. The chicken was falling off the bone. It was so juicy. I will definitely make this again.

I Love this recipe, thanks for sharing! This is a no fail recipe, no way you can mess it up. My family loves this. The 1st time I made this I folowed the instructions exactly. It was wonderful. The 2nd time I made this because I was running late, I came home for lunch at 1pm put the chicken in the slow cooker but did not use any aluminum foil. I seasoned the chicken with salt and paprika and then I washed up a few small whole potatoes and put them on top of the chicken and put the lid on. I placed the slow cooker on high and went to work. When I was home by 5pm it smelled great. By dinner time (6pm) we had yummi chicken and baked potatoes! My meal was all done for me with no effort at all! I often make this and my family never gets bored or tired of it!

This was a disaster.  I was so excited because it smelled amazing and looked fantastic cooking in the natural juices. It literally fell off the bone.  Perfect....right?  Wrong.  It was drier than the Sahara desert.  I cooked it the appropriate time and it was a 5 lb chicken.  I am baffled about this one.  I'll stick with buying the already cooked rotisserie chickens at the grocery store from now on.

My chicken turned out great. I used this recipe as the general directions to cook a chicken in the slow cooker, I then seasoned as I would have if I was roasting it. If your chicken tastes bland it is because you didn't season it, I used lots of garlic, paprika, s&p, I put an onion in the cavity as well. I didn't add any liquid to it, placed it on carrots and potatoes, there was lots of juice on the bottom to make gravy.

Two words: fantastic and easy.  I took the advice of other reviewers and rubbed the chicken on the outside and inside the skin with a mixture of olive oil, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder and poultry seasoning.  I set the chicken in the slow cooker on a bed of celery, onions and carrots and two cups of stock.  Chicken was so tender and flavorful - def a keeper!  Bon appetite!

Amazing!! I made some changes. I did a dry rub cumin, salt, pepper, paprika, thyme and garlic powder. All recipes has some great slow cooker tips and ideas. I kept the skin on rubbed under the skin and on top of the skin. I minced garlic cloves put that under the skin too. I also took some whole pieces of garlic and chopped an onion and stuffed it inside. Instead of using foil, I used cut potatoes to line the slow cooker. I also rubbed the bird down with some olive oil. It was about 5 pounds, it almost didn’t fit in my cooker! So I sprayed the sides of the slow cooker with cooking spray so it wouldn’t stick. I cooked it on high for an hour and then switched it low for about 8 hours. Cook it with the skin on and rub underneath the skin in order to have a flavorful chicken. It was hard to transfer because it literally fell apart it was so moist. I didn’t add any liquid it wasn’t needed. I used the leftover juices to make gravy, I just added some flour, it didn’t need anything else. Words of advice- pull all the chicken off and separate it while it’s still warm to hot. It’s hard to do that the next day. I’m using some of the leftovers to make chicken pot pie.

Loved this recipe, only things I did different was, turn the bird breast side down (juices flow to breast) and scrubbed 4 med potatoes and put them IN the foil.  Potatoes come out roasted.  Everything else was great.  Thank you for such a yummy, Easy, did I say yummy?  recipe.  My family loved every bite!

This was the most tender, moist, fall-off-the-bone chicken ever!  I changed a few things based on other reviews, however: I layered the bottom with quartered potatoes, onions, carrots, and celery, then stuffed the chicken with a coarsely chopped onion and three teaspoons of minced garlic.  I poured in a little apple cider since some had expressed concerns about it drying out, but since it's in the slow cooker I wouldn't repeat that step, since it ended up stewing in a mush of veggies and apple-chicken juices.  I used a rub of olive oil, paprika, salt, pepper, sage, basil, and parsley.  Finally, I used a three-pound chicken and mine was a tad too big for my slow cooker, so I covered it loosely with tin foil and set the lid on top of that.  Turned out great!  My husband says it's definitely a keeper!

Made this over the weekend. How simple can you get?!?!  I threw in a bunch of spices together that sounded good...also put some butter and the spices under the skin. Added a whole, quartered onion and a handful of smashed garlic cloves to the cavity. Delish and super duper easy!

I have never cocked a whole chicken in the crock before. I have made this twice.  The first time exactly as the recipe called: came out moist but not a lot of flavor. The second time I doctored up my chicken the same way I do my turkey on Thanksgiving.  Came out wonderful and the entire house smelled as if it were Thanksgiving.  I placed the chicken on top of potatoes, carrots & added 2 cups of chicken broth. After removing the chicken & vegetables from the crock pot, I added 1 C white wine & flour to the juice for mouth watering gravey.  Everyone loved it.  I love the ease of a crock pot for a great meal when we are constantly on the run.

I agree that the chicken needs more seasoning.  I massaged multiple spices with small pats of butter under the skin.  I also put chicken broth in the bottom of the slow cooker and instead of tin foil, used potatoes and carrots.  Very good when using these changes.

This is great and a basic slow cooker recipe, BUT if you want to really cook up a moist chicken, instead of foil place the chicken on top of some celery, carrots or halved apples. Then, stuff the chicken with celery and apple slices....I also like to add some whole garlic and or onion.  Super moist and flavorful!  :)

Great basic recipe very easy to adjust with whatever you have on hand. Here's what I did, first I put potatoes/carrots/celery/onion/garlic cut in chunks instead of the foil. I seasoned with poultry seasoning/cayenne/garlic powder/seasoning salt/dried parsley/dried basil (I seasoned under the skin too - I put some butter under the skin as well) I also cut 1 small onion and about 5 garlic cloves and inserted it inside the chicken. I then brushed chicken with a little dijon mustard and then some olive oil to keep chicken moist. I poured a little white zinfandel wine (maybe 1/4 cup) and about 1/4 beef broth. Let it cook untouched for 3.5 hours on high. Juiciest chicken ever, potatoes were amazing too! I made an easy chicken gravy from the juices left over in the pot by adding a bit of flour paste (flour & drippings) and letting it cook on high for 20 more minutes. Only thing I would do differently next time is I would put lemon wedges on the inside and slices on top (I love lemon). Will definitely be making this again.

I made this for dinner tonight, using suggestions of additional spices and 2 cups chicken broth in the pot. First, the foil balls kept the bird off the bottom of the pot. The flavor was delicious, and would have been very good using just the as written spices. That said, my 3 1/2 pound chicken was dry. I was very glad to have the broth in the pot. I simply defatted the broth and added a cup of it to a roux, along with a pinch of pepper. The gravy was PERFECT! I will certainly make this again, cooking on low for 7 hours. The remaining broth is in the freezer for a night when I need amazing gravy. So 4 stars. With an onion and some poultry seasoning, plus a timing adjustment, this is worth 5 stars. Thanks!

This is a great basic recipe that lends itself well to your personal options.  I had a chicken that had been in the freezer way too long and a slow cooker and wanted to try them together.  I found this recipe and the comments to it and went to work.  I still had some frozen rosemary in the garden and a few oranges in the fridge so made Rosemary Orange baked chicken. First I slathered the bird with butter.  Then, I made a rub of salt pepper poultry seasoning chopped fresh rosemary and paprika and rubbed that onto the whole chicken I grated up some orange zest and sprinkled that on the bird.  I halved the orange and stuffed that in the cavity with 2 small onions. Trussed the bird and placed it on the slow cooker on the aluminum foil "logs" I had made.  I added one cup of stock and cooked for 4 hours on high.  It came out tender, moist with a hint of orange.  Tasted great. Turns out I didn't need to add the stock, I will know that next time.  I didn't brown the bird as I wanted to keep the prep time down and if i wanted a crispy brown skin, I just would have baked the bird.  Thanks for a great recipe

this was so good!  the only change was I used potatoes instead of foil.  My kids could not stop eating it.  I made a gravy with the juices when it was done.  so good.  I love that we made it in the summer and did not have to turn the oven on!

This was really outstanding.  I started by using the "Simple Chicken Brine" recipe on Allrecipes.com and then turned the chicken, breast side down, on potatoes and onions, rather than the aluminum foil balls.  I added carrots and rounded it out with a multi-grain bread for a delicious meal.  Because of the brining, the chicken fell off the bones after only five and a half hours and was moist and delicious.

It doesn't get any easier than this recipe. I did modify the recipe.  I took 1/2 stick of  room temp butter and spread it all underneath the skin of the chicken. Then I took papricka, pepper, salt, garlic powder, onion powder and rotissere chicken season and rub it underneath the skin  and  all over the chicken.  I let it sit in the fridge overnight to season. and place it in the crockpot on high for 1.5 hrs then on low for about 7hrs. It was soooo good!!

I am basing this review on method alone.  It definitely needs more spices- I used salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder under the skin and filled cavity with lemon, onion, and garlic.  Came out very moist and flavorful.  I took the advice of another reviewer and filled the foil with potatoes and then made mashed potatoes with them.  Will definitely use this method again but with my own twist on flavors.

Im a huge fan of this chicken!!! This was sooo moist, flavorful and best of all easy. I have read all the reviews and came up with this. I put potatoes,onions,carrots,garlic and 1/2 cup of both on the bottem. Seasoned the chicken under the skin and over with garlic slivers, salt, pepper, paprika, basil, parsley and BUTTER. I seasoned it twice in the beganing and near the end. Breast side down. I couldnt stuff anything in the cavity bec it was still somewhat frozen. Put on high for 2 hours and low for 4 1/2 hours. This was a 5 pd. chicken. I then put it in the oven on 450 for 20 mins bec I like the skin crispy. I made gravy with the juices just in case it came out dry. I didnt need it!! This was perfect. Thanks! Note: have made this many times and a 5 pounder is the best to use. Also everything that was at bottem of cooker goes in the oven too, gives them a nice crispiness and takes care of one of the side dishes.

This chicken dish was good. I used potatoes and carrots on the bottom of the pot instead of tin foil. I stuffed the chicken with lemon and onion. It was surprising just how much grease there was from the chicken fat. Made for a nice gravy though! A little tip...I let mine cook from 7:30 - 4:00 and the chicken fell off the bone and was a little dry. So I would recommend definitely cooking this for only 6-7 hours!

Chicken was really tender, and had a hard time fishing all the pieces out of the crockpot.  Didn't use the foil, and that ended up giving a great gravy in the end. (with a lil flour and cornstarch)

This recipe was wonderul. I have always been afraid to cook a whole chicken for some reason. This was so easy and it was excellent. I could barely get it out of the crockpot because it was falling apart, very tender and juicy. I cooked it on high for 1 hour and then on low for 6 hours. I made it last night for dinner and with the leftovers I'm going to make chicken and noodles. The only thing I did different was that I didn't use the paprika, I used salt, pepper, seasoned salt, and chicken seasoning. And I used a lot of seasoning.

This was the best chicken I've ever made! I used a whole roasting chicken (about 4 lbs.)and omitted the foil (I wanted it to baste in the juices). The night before I seasoned it with McCormick's Broiled Steak Seasoning inside and out and I put a 1/2 stick of margarine and 2 bouillion cubes inside. In the morning, I threw it in the crock pot and I turned it over a couple of times throughout the day. It was so tender it fell off the bone and was the juiciest and best tasting chicken we've ever had! My family loved it... it was gone almost instantly!

What a great recipe!  I am a personal chef and it impressed me even!  I used a whole chicken and lots of Seasoning salt mixed with a little jerk rub.  I also stuffed it with two halves a lemon and flipped it a couple of times to let the juices distribute!  Me and my cat have been enjoying it ever since it came out of the crock!  Next time I may throw it under the broiler to see if I can crisp the skin a little!  Word to the wise....take the advice and season liberally, it really makes a difference.  Bon Apetit!

I m cooking- and just got a small crock pot at the thrift store. This recipe seemed simple enough, so I tried it.

It came out WONDERFUL!

I used boneless, SKINLESS ,thinly sliced chicken breasts. It came out juicy and tender. There.was some juice in the bottom of the pot, so I mixed that in some instant mashed potatoes. What a wonderful meal!

I am so PROUD of myself for doing this :-)

I rinsed and saved the aluminum foil balls, to reuse them again, and save foil and money.

This is one of my favorite work-week dinners!  I have made this many, many times and it nearly impossible to mess it up.  I've made it with and without the aluminum at the bottom and have noticed no difference, so you can really do it without.  The key here is to add whatever seasonings you like!  I always put onion in the cavity and celery, if I have it on-hand.  I've also added cut up apple before and it tasted great!  I always add garlic and chicken broth too.  As I said, you can really put whatever you want or have on hand in.  Next time I make this, I'm going to try orange slices.  Anyway you try it, I'm telling you - it will taste great and can't get much easier than this!

I did what others before me have done and put onion, potatoes, and carrots in the bottom of the crockpot and then put the chicken on that.  I had stuffed the cavity with fresh rosemary, onion and garlic.  On top I sprinkled Paula Deen's House Seasoning and then drizzled with a little olive oil.  The chicken cooked on high for one hour and then on low for about 5 hours and was done.  It is not a roast chicken like out of the oven but it was suitable for my needs which was just cooked chicken for other recipes.  I was surprised to find that the pot was filled with the juices by the time it was done too.  We will get several meals out of this one effort.  Thanks!

I used a mostly frozen bird, so couldn't stuff or season the cavity, but I did brown the outside a bit before putting it in the slow cooker (as other suggested).  Turned out AWESOME.  Best slow cooker chicken I've tried yet.  While browning may have been helpful, keeping the bird above the juice (with foil wads or upside-down ramekin dishes) seems to be the real trick.  I even forgot to turn down the heat on the slow cooker, but it was still perfect.

Soooooo easy and soooooo good! The chicken is tender, juicy, perfect for eating right away and for freezing. The recipe is easy to change to accommodate different herb/spice preferences. This has become a favorite in my house.

I did the whole aluminum balls thing.  I guess this keeps the chicken suspended so it doesn't roast in it's own juices and thus become soggy.  I did what some others did and quartered an onion and stuffed it inside the cavity along with 4 small cloves of garlic.  I used some McCormicks rotisserie seasoning on the inside and outside along with some olive oil.  My chicken was a 3lb-er or so.  I think 10hrs is overdoing it frankly.  I went for 8hrs and think it could be even shorter.  Test your chicken around the 7hr mark with a meat thermometer to see where it is.  I also tied my chicken up in 3 places with cotton twine.  You might want to do that too because if you read other reviewers you'll notice they say that the chicken falls apart.  It does!  I was able to remove mine OK enough to put it into a turkey pan which I then broiled the top and bottom of the chicken for about 3-4 minutes each side.  That gives it a nice crispy skin and melts off some chicken fat.  The drippings in the crock pot become a dark-colored gelatin in the fridge which I will use for something!

The only reason I gave it three stars is because the foil is a brilliant idea.  The biggest mistake is the seasoning.  I injected the chicken generously with Goya Mojo Criollo Marinade, rubbed on the spices and left it in the refrigerator overnight. It turned out great.

Really easy, really good.  If you have a rack, you don't need the aluminum foil.  Another alternative to the foil is to add a cup of broth or water to prvent burning.

My family loved this recipe and I'm going to make it again and again, but I didn't give 5 stars because I only loosely followed the recipe.  I used a whole chicken and did not use foils balls.  Instead, I halved a few onions and carrots and quartered some red potatoes to put in the bottom.  I used fresh garlic, salt and pepper.  I put some garlic cloves and an onion inside the chicken.  I also added half a cup of chicken broth because I was worried it would be too dry.  I also cooked the chicken breast down.  Mmmmmmmmm so good.  It wasn't fall of the bone chicken, but it was moist and tender, tasted wonderful, and the veggies were delicious!

This recipe would be truly great if the aluminum foil was not added to it. It is surly one that can be adjusted to fit any busy healthy life style just put the vegies in the bottom, I too recommend brining the chicken over night, I have used orange or apple juice instead of water plus a table spoon of salt in a zip lock bag. I think I would also like to try rice in the bottom instead of potatoes.

This was the first time my chicken was done right in the slow cooker. I loved it. The smell was heavenly. Thank you for submitting this recipe. It will be a family favorite for years to come. I even made gravy from the drippings.

Beware new slow cookers. When my 30 year old Crock Pot bit the dust, I tried several brands of newer slow cookers and read many reviews only to discover that the "low" setting on newer slow cookers do not cook slow. They all cook at very high heat which defeats the entire purpose of a SLOW cooker.  The manufacturers appear to be aware of the problem, but sales on slow cookers is slow so they probably won't correct the known issue. 

After much searching, I finally found an older, mint condition Rival Crock Pot at the Goodwill.  It has no timer.  It only has low, high and off.  It has no timer that will go bad in two years making the slow cooker non-functioning.  

Get thee to the Goodwill or plan on your chicken getting done way sooner than the recipe says.

DELICIOUS! I also used potatoes, carrots and onion underneath, along with wine and a little chicken broth.  I cooked mine half the time on high then turned the chicken though I'm not sure that was necessary.  My very picky boyfriend said that it was the best meal he's had in a very long time!! ( I served it with the Red Skinned Potato Salad recipe from this site, BEST ever!) Tonight we're going to cook some rice with onions and chopped leftover chicken and serve it with the thickened broth over it.  Can't wait!  Thanks for the terrific yet simple recipe!

I was looking for a slow cooked whole chicken recipe I could just throw in the crock pot on a work day and dinner would be almost complete when I got home. I slipped cold butter slices between the chicken and the skin and then I seasoned this chicken using the spice mixture w/ less salt from the Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style under the skin as well as on top. I prepared this the night before so my DH could put in the crockpot in the a.m.  I had him skip cooking on high for one hour and opted for an all day low temp. Six hours later he said it was at done so he switched the pot over to warm.  When I got home  2 hours later the chicken fell right off the bone. Not the effect I was after. I was hoping to pull a whole chicken out of the crock pot. This is a great fix it and forget it recipe for stewed chicken but if you are looking for a "baked" chicken effect it may not be what you are after. It was juicy, tender and good and I will probably make again if I am wanting to make a stewed chicken or to make a casserole or soup from the chicken. But if I want a "baked" style I will use my oven next time.

This recipe was extremely wonderful!!! After reading the reviews I had some changes.  Instead of the foil balls I used two onions as a bed.  I also used 1 can of chicken broth and I heavily seasoned inside and outside the chicken with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, & a bit of red pepper flakes.  I used a 4 pound chicken and did the 1 hour on high and 8-10 hours on low.  I fed four people on HALF of the chicken.  I used the other half for taco meat for ANOTHER MEAL!!!    FALL OF THE BONE TENDER...LITERALLY.  EVERYONE loved it! :)

Iv'e yet to find a chicken recipe that comes out good in the crock pot. It always overcooks and dries out and this was no exception. I even tried it a second time with a whole frozen chicken and it still was overcooked. I have discovered that the crockpot makes an excellent chicken stock though.

Please don't hate me for reviewing this recipe even though I went off the grid. Figured someone might benefit from this info. Took other reviewer's advice and put carrots, potatoes and onions in bottom of crock because I'm lazy and didn't want to have to come up with a separate side dish. Used a completely frozen, hard-as-a-rock whole chicken. I rubbed a little olive oil over the frozen, yucky juice (it occurred to me after the fact I should have rinsed it) and sprinkled it with Lawry's. Cooked on high for about an hour and a half (meant to only do it for an hour) and then cooked on low for about another 8 hours. Everything was delicious, the chicken fell apart and the meat fell off the bone, and there was plenty of juice created without having to add any extra should I have chosen to make gravy. I think I did cook it a skoosh too long...was just nervous about the frozen bird thing. Also forgot to put my chicken in breast side down, dangit. Think this would have helped avoid the slight dryness I detected. Would definitely make again. Too easy not to. Thanks!

This was an amazing idea!  I didn't give it a 5 because I changed it a little.  I put 1/2 cup of dry white wine in the bottom of the slow cooker, stuffed the cavity with 6 cloves of garlic and 1 lemon, and put a little dijon mustard on the top.  The chicken melted in our mouths and we strained the drippings and added some cornstarch to make an amazing gravy.  Awesome!!!!

This was what I thought it would be: a great way to stew chicken. I used carrots and potatoes instead of foil for the bottom, and added 3/4 cup chicken broth only because I had it on hand to use up. I put a half onion cut up into four pieces and some celery in the cavity. I loosened the skin and put spices underneath. I cooked it 8 hours on low. It was good, but bland. Next time? Even more spices, and lower the cooking time to 7 hours on low. This would be a great way to make chicken soup, or just cook a chicken to use the meat in different recipes.

Like so many others, I used no foil and instead kept the bird off the bottom using potatoes, onions, and a few baby carrots stuck into the gaps.  A more complete bed than was intended perhaps, but it worked quite well.  The chicken did come out somewhat overcooked, however, I think this was probably due to my being worried about the first hour at high temperature being inadequate and extending that (big bird, full pot, incomplete seal, whole-bird-novice-jitters, etc.)  I suspect if I'd followed instructions more precisely and just relaxed, it would have been fine.
As it turns out (a surprise to nobody but myself), a five and a half pound bird on a full bed of vegetables for 8-10 hours produces quite a lot of thick, dark, beautiful chicken stock (assuming you strain and separate instead of enjoying it directly as a chicken-vegetable soup).  I had planned on throwing the carcass in to make stock after cooking this but in retrospect I think this method of preparation does most of what can be done for you already.  In any case, this would explain the other reviewers' experience adding broth at the beginning and then realizing it was entirely superfluous.
Oh, and I did seasoning under the skin while leaving the skin on (as much as I could after that process), then sprinkled a little on top, worried about seasoning only the skin as commented by others.  It turned out fine in all respects - everything was flavorful and much of the skin stayed put.

The tin foil keeps it out of the juices, so it tastes roasted, not boild.  If your a skin eater, this is not for you.  But if your looking for a good tender chicken that will work for all kinds of things the first time and for leftovers this is the recipe for you.

I cooked this too long =(  Not so long that it came out gross, it was edible and tasted pretty good, but it could have been better. My slow cooker is more powerful than I give it credit for. I'm giving it 5 stars because I hate when people give a recipe a low score because THEY did something wrong! I had a chicken that was over 7lbs, that's why I felt I needed to cook it for so long. I took another posters advice and wrapped potatoes in foil to make mashed potatoes...although that is a GREAT idea, it didn't come out very good either for me. BUT, I LOVE this idea of cooking a whole chicken in the slow cooker. I will try it again and do it right next time (I hope). Oh, I did brown the skin in the broiler first, that was a good idea. I rubbed the skin with butter then seasoned it before putting it in the broiler. I WILL get this right next time! ;o).

I fixed this for Dinner last night and wow it was great.  I did use the foil balls to keep the chicken out of the juices from the chicken,  but added onion and carrots.  This turned out better than any chicken cooked in the oven,  and saves you from the heat of it too.  This is a must try you will love it.  I did add a little white wine when I first put it in the pot,  dont worry,  it is safe for kids to eat all the Alcohol cooks out.

Put some fingerling potatoes, carrots, celery, 1/2 pound of sliced mushrooms, and some re-hydrated dehydrated onions on the bottom (had no real onions).  I was pressed for time, so I cooked it on high for 5 hours.  Turned out great.  My husband loved it and he's a tough critic.  He made a delicious gravy with the juices from the bottom.

We love this! However I followed a few of others peoples advice... I used carrots and Potatoes instead of Foil... Which makes it a great meal.  And then I just add a few different spices.... Basically whatever I have on hand... Such as poultry seasoning, Tony's, cumin, paprika and anything else that sounds good... I mix the seasonings together in a bowl and then rub it all over.  Mostly trying to get under the skin to add more flavor.  This is one of my new favorite recipes!  THANKS!

I have made this several times now and it always turns out great!  I opted not to use the foil balls as I simply chose to add veggies (carrots, onions, and potatoes) to the bottom of the slow cooker before adding the chicken.  I also rub the chicken with butter, even under the skin and spice it up a bit more with garlic, thyme, and a little rosemary. I also stuff the cavity of the chicken with a peeled onion for added moisture and flavor.  I could not imagine making a whole chicken in a different manner.  It is sooooo juicy and tender! My hubby LOVES it everytime!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Fantastic!!!  I made a few changes though. I sprayed the crock with non stick cooking spray, and I added sliced potato, 1 onion chopped, and 1 bag of baby carrots in the bottom of the crock.  I stuffed one onion inside the chicken for some great flavor. I put 1 1/2 cups chicken broth in the bottom of the crock and then put garlic salt, black pepper, herbs de province, and minced garlic on the actual chicken.  I put the seasonings under the skin to ensure great flavor.  After you enjoy the chicken the first night, shred whats left & throw it back in the pot with some egg noodles for a easy and delish chicken noodle soup the next night! 2 meals in one!!

I rubbed it all over with butter and sprinkled with garlic salt and it turned out sooo fantastic!  My 3 year old ate so much chicken I thought she wouldnt eat the leftovers but the next morning she wanted more.

I was intrigued by the thought of roasting a chicken in the slow cooker so I had to try it. I was a little nervous using aluminum balls so I had 3 old small potatoes as my stand that I discarded afterward. After reading other reviews I heavily seasoned the chicken with poultry seasoning and added sprigs of rosemary and thyme and sage into the cavity. Even then I could just taste a hint of the spices so without it I know it would have been bland. Next time I'll add more spices under the skin with some butter.  Mine did turn out a little dry too, and that was after adding a half can of broth to it (didn't want the potatoes to start cooking on a dry surface but the chicken wasn't touching it) and then also I cut the cooking time by an hr (meat thermometer said it was over cooked even at that time). It did turn out good though but not browned. The meat was very tender and the bird fell apart right as I was setting it onto the plate. It deboned very easy which I used the leftovers for soup the next day. I may just use this as a starter for cooking the chicken for chicken noodle soup for now on. Next time I'll also try cooking the chicken -breast side down- to see if that reserves some moisture in the breasts.

This is a great recipe. Added the 1 cup of chicken broth,1 bag of baby carrots, mushrooms, & 2 onions. Pulled the chicken out when it was done and roasted it for 15 minutes to get a crisp skin. Added some flour (salt and pepper) to the left over chicken drippings and broth for a great gravy. It was heaven.

I made this chicken today, I started it early this morning and it was ready late this afternoon, in time for a nice Sunday dinner.  It was sooooooo yummy!  Very moist and tender.  I did make some additions.  I used the salt, pepper and paprika under the skin and on top of the skin but I also added some garlic salt and Grill Mates Montreal roasted garlic chicken seasoning. To the cavity of the chicken I quartered a lemon, an onion and 4 whole cloves of garlic.  I was only able to put in 3 lemon wedges and 2 onion quarters but I think this is what made the chicken so moist, even the white meat was mosit!  About two hours before it was done, I added a can of chicken broth to the crock pot.  I boiled the giblets with some salt and pepper to make a nice broth.  When the chicken was done, I used the drippings and added them to the broth, thickening it with corn starch mixed with cold water.  My husband said this was one of the best gravies I have ever made!  I will definitely make this again soon....super easy and delicious!

The chicken came out so moist and tender, literally falling off the bones. I used onions in the bottom of the crockpot, and threw in baby carrots and red potatoes.  These were great side dishes with the chicken. I also loosened the skin on the bird and smeared butter flavored with minced garlic, paprika, lemon pepper, and salt under the skin. That probably added to the moistness of the chicken. Loved the way the whole house smelled all day while the chicken cooked -- so homey on an Autumn day!

Good basic whole chicken in a slow cooker recipe.  

I rubbed a chicken seasoning in the inside and outside of the chicken.  I added half an onion (not cut up) to the chicken cavity.  Put large pieces of carrots and sweet potatoes on the bottom of the pot.  Also added 2 cups chicken broth.  The chicken was tender - but the sweet potatoes were AWESOME.

Wow! This was sooo good! I didn't use the foil but instead added baby carrots underneath the chicken. I cooked on high for 2 hours then on low for about 4 and it came out perfect..juicy and tender. For seasoning i took about 3 tablespoons butter mixed it with some cajun seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder and it was delish!!! will definitly make again...great basic recipe to add your own pizazz to!

Another hit from my favorite recipe site!  Made this last night and it was great, so very tender and even my picky son gulped it down.  We like lots of flavor so doctored it a little, added garlic powder and onion soup mix to the outside.  Cut up a lemon and some onion and put inside, put carrots on bottom instead of foil.  Bought a big chicken and had to cram it in there!  Added some white wine.  It made tons of juice, added some flour and had about 4 cups of gravy.  Didn't bother starting on high and it was still overcooked with 10 hours so might do less time next time, but overcooked in a falling off the bone tender way so no complaints!  Family loved it, much better than the store chickens and lots of leftovers, will definately make again!

Really as good as everyone says! Instead of the tinfoil balls, cooked mine over onions and potatoes as someone else suggested-wonderful. Also threw in a few carrots and a stick of celery chopped up for flavor. Was afraid that it would be too dry so added a couple of chicken boullion cubes and about a cup of water. Seasoned with salt, pepper and paprika. Cooked on high for 1hr and then at low for 7. Could have probably just done low the whole time though (8-10 hrs or a whole work day). Chicken fell right off! Gonna be one of our favorites...

This is a fantastically easy way to cook a whole chicken.  My chicken was 4.5 lbs.  I used onion halves instead of foil, and stuffed the cavity with onion and apple slices.  I rubbed olive oil, salt, and pepper under the skin (and poked some holes with a fork in the meat) and around the whole chicken.  I'm so glad I didn't add any extra liquid because the chicken generated its own (which I discarded).  The chicken wasn't fully thawed when I started it.  So I cooked it for a little over an hour on high, and then turned to low.  It was done in about 5 hours, and fell apart when I tried to remove it from the pot.  Not dry at all, and good flavor despite minimal spices.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

This was awesome, I took the advice of others and added a little olive oil, garlic, basil and parsley.  I cooked it on low for 10 hours, very juicy.  This is a keeper for sure.

This was great, I added peppercorn bacon on top of the chicken and inserted garlic in the meat along with celery and onion, garlic in the cavity. It was a 7.5 lb chicken. It was very moist. One of the best tasting chickens I have ever had.

This recipe is a great place to start!  Being that I am an onion lover, I also peeled a whole onion and put it inside the cavity of he chicken.  It gives the meat some added flavor.  I also like to sprinkle the skin with a little onion powder in addition to the paprika and salt and pepper.  I bought a meat rack for my slow cooker; so I don't even have to used the foil.  Such a simple delicious dinner!!!

I used a whole chicken the first time, and it was very good.  I did add my own spices. (anything I could find in my cupboard!)  I made gravy just in case the chicken didn't have any flavour, but I really didn't need it.  This time I have used chicken legs, and I was really frustrated trying to balance them on the foil balls.  Next time it's back to the whole chicken!

this recipe does not yield "browned" chicken like
the description says. I used lots of spice and the result was the blandest, mealiest tasting chicken I've ever had. My husband isn't as offended by it as I am, maybe he's just hungry, but I won't be making this ever again.

I actually have not tried this recipe as yet, but I did try the aluminum foil trick with a recipe that involved a rub that I did not want to be washed off by the juices of the chicken, and it worked absolutely beautifully!  I was able to take one of my favorite oven recipes and make it even better in the crockpot!

Love, love love this recipe. Have made it multiple times and I still can't believe how easy and delicious it is. Yes.. it tastes just like the baked chickens you can buy at the deli. I use salt, seasoning salt, paprika and last night my significant other snuck in some liquid smoke a few hours before it was done which (I hate to admit) definitely added some depth. Do yourself a favor and make this tonight!

Followed top suggestions on seasonings. I had the equivalent to a whole chicken but in pieces and cooked them all in the crock. This was a SUPER tasty recipe for fall off the bone chicken. Saved reserved chicken for a recipe later.

Awesome!  
Cut up potatoes, celery, and carrots and put'em at the bottom instead of foil balls.  Seasoned chicken with steak seasoning actually and then added freshly diced rosemary, garlic powder, and onion powder.  Left the chicken pieces (drumsticks, thighs) in the fridge in a plastic bag for a couple of hours.  Then cooked it on high for about 5.5 hours.  I turned the chicken and vegetables halfway so it cooks evenly.  

For the vegetables I salted and peppered it before cooking.

I liked the the chicken on top of the veggies so the chicken fat fell to the bottom of the pot and seasoned the veggies even more.  

Man... this is def the best way to cook chicken.  :)  The meat was superbly tender.  Yay!

I liked how easy this was, and how fall-apart-tender the chicken came out. Literally, when i tried to lift it, it fell apart into quarters. The flavor was kind of boring though, and it didn't have what I consider to be the best part of a roast chicken - no crispy skin. Combine that with the slightly dry white meat, and I just wasn't a fan. I'll stick to oven roasting from now on.

The first time I used this recipe, I forgot to turn the slow cooker down to low after an hour.  So when I went to check after the allotted time all of the meat had cooked off the bone.  The flavor however was great. And the family enjoyed it.   Today I tried it again, this time I did not forget to turn it down to low.   It turned out great.  Mine was not crispy as other have reported.  But it was very tender, moist and flavorful.  Just as if I had placed it in the oven and continually basted it with it juices.    Always thought I had to let meat remain in it's juices in a slow cooker.  It's nice to know that is not the case.   I dont like to have my chicken swimming in fat.  I will be trying this recipe again.

I was a little short on time, so I decided to cook this on high for 4 hours. I also added a glass of water at the bottom to keep it moist. I didn't add any additional ingredients or seasonings, and the chicken was absolutely delicious and flavourful. The whole family enjoyed it. Will definitely make this again!!

I've made this a couple of times and have changed a few things!  I created a rub using the paprika and salt and pepper, but also added 1 tbsp olive oil, a few pinches of parsley and a minced garlic clove.  I also quickly brown each side of the chicken in a frying pan prior to putting it in the crock pot, which helps to crisp up the skin and gives it nice colour.  I also put about a 1/2 cup of apple juice in the bottom of the crock pot.  My husband wants this every week!!!

This chicken was great. I changed a few things: I stuffed the chicken with fresh halved lemons, coarsely chopped onions, 4 smashed cloves of garlic and fresh thyme. I then added root vegetables around the chicken for the last 2 hours of cooking.  It was fall off the bone and the veggies were cooked perfectly. My family ate the entire meal, no left overs!

I loved the idea of "baking" the chicken in the slow cooker.  The foil was a great idea.  My chicken started out a little dry after thawing in the fridge, so I rubbed it all over with olive oil before adding the seasonings.  I also put a couple of cups of broth and several cloves of garlic in the bottom of the cooker and had wonderful drippings that made a great gravy.  

I put it in at about 9 a.m. and let it cook on high for a couple of hours, then turned it down to low.  When we ate about 6 p.m. it was perfectly done.  Yes, it falls apart when you take it out, but I didn't care because I wanted to use it in pieces anyway.  

If you are making gravy with the drippings and are clueless about gravy, use the "Easy Gravy" recipe from Argo Cornstarch.  It's a great base that you can add your own seasonings to.

Too, too easy and tasty!!  I added a few more seasonings than the recipe suggested...garlic, poulty seasoning, S&P and lemon herb (which next time I will add more!)  I more celery stalks in the bottom and a little apple cider (that is what was open in the frig).  Washed the bird, seasoned, put it in the slow cooker and walked away!  It cooked for 6 hours on low/med.  It did fall apart a bit, no big deal because I wasn't making a presentation.  It was moist, tasty and too easy!  I will be making this for all my recipes that call for cooked chicken.

Super easy! I added several spices to the mix, and poured red wine in the bottom. I cooked on high for 2 hours, then turned to low for about 3 hours. The legs and breasts stayed whole, but the thighs and wings fell of the bone which is fine with me! Less carving!

Ridiculously moist and easy chicken recipe. I don't know where the golden brown and baked part come into play here, but it was delicious... I made it last night, let it cook on low for about 8 hours. I was going to take it out of the crock pot to let it rest before i separated meat/bones, but it all just fell apart as i picked it up! So tender... if I wasn't using this for chicken salad sandwiches, I probably would've cooked it a little less so it held together more, but it worked well for the recipe I'll use it for. I also put veggies in the bottom of the cooker as well as the cavity (why use tinfoil when you can add more flavor). And I ended up using a lot more spices (just used some blends I have on hand and want to use up). Should be great!

This was delicious!  I have an older crock pot so the one hour on high and 8 hours on low cooked this chicken perfectly.  The meat was moist and succulent and fell off the bone easily.  I used potatoes instead of aluminum foil balls to prop up the bird.  We ate the potatoes from the pot and hate steamed brocolli with it.  Such an easy recipe!  Enjoy!

If you season the bird with seasoned salt and cook it on low (trust me, use a meat thermometer to verify safely cooked chicken) it will taste very similar to Swiss Chalet chicken (Canadian, coast to coast rotisserie chicken restaurant). I do not recommend high setting with the newer crockpots, tis too high.
I like to tuck a cut up lemon in the chicken when I cook it this way.

I seasoned with paprika, cayenne pepper and garlic and onion powders.  I put a quarted onion and some celery into the cavity and then placed on a cut up onion instead of the foil balls.  I also put about 1/2 cup of chicken stock in the slow cooker.  I cooked it on high for 3 hours and low for an additional 2 hours.  Was fall off the bone tender.  My only complaint was the skin never browned at all and was a slimey mess.  I can't imagine serving this as a main dish.  It is perfect to use in other dishes requiring cooked chicken.

This recipe was easy and good. I used a 5 lb. chicken. Small changes I suggest: I used carrots and onions instead of aluminum foil in the bottom. I crushed about 5 cloves of garlic and put some of the veggies and garlic inside the chicken as well. I stuck a few pats of butter here and there and used maybe a cup of chicken broth just poured over top. I seasoned with s&p, garlic powder and paprika. I cooked 2 hrs. on high and 3.5-4 hrs. on low. It was very moist and the flavor was good. I plan on using some for chicken salad. Another reviewer used the leftover broth and veggies to make chicken soup- a GREAT idea! Delicious with some roasted veggies. Enjoy!

This was very good.  I put chopped carrots in the bottom instead of the foil.  I had 9 lbs I had pulled out of the garden so figured I would give it a try to see how they would taste.  I then seasoned with oil olive spray, tucked fresh thyme under the skin and in the cavity, squirted fresh lemon juice over the top and stuck some lemon pieces in the cavity then some salt & pepper.  Added about a half a cup of chicken broth.  On high for one hour and low for about 6 hours and then warm until dinner.  It was very moist and cooked perfect.  But, there was ALOT of liquid.  I made some gravy and served it with home grown yukon gold taters fresh from the garden and the carrots.  The chicken was great, the taters were great.  The carrots, just tasted odd.  My 21 year old daughter said they tasted like Fruit Loops!  LOL!  I guess the lemon and the carrots didn't work together.

I have made this a few times. Only thing I do differently is add the spices we enjoy. It comes out tasty and not ugly and colorless. The paprika is key, I have some high quality Hungarian paprika we picked up on a trip there. I think that really makes it good.

This is a great way for a busy person to have a delicious dinner ready when they get home.
My only concern was using the aluminum foil at the bottom of slow cooker so I gave it 4 stars.  I am sure it would leach out aluminum into the meal and that is very dangerous for your body. I only use stainless steel or ceramic in my cookware for this reason. A good idea would be to put all the veggies on the bottom or even use a SS rack to fit under the chicken to keep it from sticking or burning. This chicken dinner was delicious. I added carrots, onions, celery and rutabaga ( it's like a turnip that my mom always added to some chicken dishes)  and spiced it up a bit with garlic, poultry seasoning, and S&P.  My family loves this. I put it all in a bowl in fridge in the evening and just pop it in the slow cooker in the am and we are good to go! My neighbors can actually smell the flavorful aromas coming from my house before we even arrive home!

I loved the fact that I could actually bake a chicken in the slow cooker!  I did think it was a bit bland.  When I make this again I will put a spread of garlic butter under the skin of the breasts and add some Greek seasoning all over.  I also added a bit of water before cooking.

My family loved this!  I put some chicken broth on the bottom followed by potatoes and added carrots as well. I added garlic and onion inside the chicken cavity, the garlic made all the difference.  I used a 4 pound whole chicken and it cooked for 8 hours, fell right off the bone.  The chicken broth gave the potatoes a great flavor.  I will definitely be making this again and again.  Thanks!

Super easy. I used a bed of large chunks of carrots, celery and onion instead of the foil and stuffed the cavity with a few pieces of each too. No paprika, just salted and peppered the bird inside and out. And I added about 1/2 to 1 cup of liquid (water) in the bottom at the start (my cooker has hot spots). It completely fell apart when I was taking it out of the slow cooker and is tender and moist and delicious! And bonus, I strained the liquid after pulling out the large chunks of veggies and bones and have some delicious ultra-concentrated chicken broth!

Absolutely delicious! I cut one large onion in half and placed it in the bottom of my slow cooker. I make a compound butter with parsley and paprika and slid it under the skin. Over the skin I slathered on more butter and dusted the chicken with s&p, garlic powder, more paprika and parsley. Wasn't falling off the bone but darn close. Wings did fall off when lifting it out. I cooked it for 4 hours on high. Meant to turn to low but I forgot so just let it cook. It was juicy and flavorful. Served with Dill Potato Salad (warm) and mix of creamed corn and whole kernel corn. My British boyfriend, who is here for 3 months, and my Dad both enjoyed the meal a lot. Thanks!

THE best and easiest way to make a whole chicken - healthy too!  The aluminum foil raises the chicken off the bottom of the pot to allow it to baste itself and not sit in the juice.  Couple changes - borrowed from another recipe - a stalk of celery inside the cavity.  It makes a great difference in the taste.  I also use an Italian seasoning blend.  The best part - you can "de-bone" the chicken in no time since it literally falls apart.  We have it for dinner the first night and then I have a good 2-3 cups of shredded chicken ready for another recipe.  I cook it on low all day or on high for 3-4 hours. *Update*-Decided to make it exactly as the recipe states and it was even better!  The simple seasoning blend of s/p and paprika was very good and cooking it on high for 1 hour and low the rest of the day browned it really nicely.

I love this recipe. The only thing that I did differently was to pour a can of chicken broth over the top and then sprinkle with paprika. I think it makes for a moister chicken.  Love it!

Cotton, your recipe is brilliant. We enjoyed every mouthful. The skin melted away. Literally. I have made this a couple of times now and it tastes different every time I make it, depending on the seasonings I use.

So simple, yet so delicious.  I followed this recipe as indicated.  (No broth at the bottom, no turning the bird, nothing fancy.)  Because I had a 5lb bird, I cooked it for 2 hours on high and then 5 hours on low.  Fantastic.  I also used some "One Step Chicken" seasoning by McCormick. It came out perfectly.

This recipe is great for someone who works outside the home and needs dinner ready when they come home. Since I am a stay at home mom I prefer roasting a chicken in the oven for better flavor. When I made this recipe I followed some advice from other reviewers. I cut an onion in half for the chicken to rest on and added 1 cup chicken broth. I put butter under the skin and seasoned with motreal chicken seasoning inside and out. I also put 3 cloves of garlic and some celery in the chicken. Half way through the cooking I checked on the chicken and it was almost covered in liquid. I did not want a boiled chicken so drained most of the liquid of and added some cut up potatoes and carrots to the bottom and finished cooking the chicken. My husband liked the chicken but I thought that it lacked flavor and reminded me of boiled chicken. So if I maked this again I will not add any liquid before cooking since the chicken make its own liquid.

Loved IT!!!  AWESOME and easy!  To complete the dinner I placed my chicken on potatoes, carrots and onions.   I did put celery/onions/carrots in the cavity of the chicken!  I used some basic seasoning salt as well.  I don't believe in rating a recipe that I changed, however I knew it looked good as it was however I wanted a complete dinner!  Easy Easy EASY!!

This was my first whole 3lb chicken in the crockpot and it was great!  I put potatoes & onions on bottom, filled the chicken with onions, celery and garlic, and added 1cup chicken stock. I also injected it with seasonings and browned first.  Cooked High for 5hrs.

I was a little afraid (especially after reading some of the reviews) that the chicken wouldn't brown and instead would be pasty white and clamy-tasting. But it browned beautifully. The chicken was moist and delicious and falling-off-the-bone good! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This way of making chicken turned out really well.  I deskinned the whole chicken, and rubbed it inside and out with Mrs. Dash, Janes Crazy Salt, and Janes Crazy Pepper.  I also put about 1/2 cup homemade chicken stock in the bottom of the slowcooker along with the balled up tinfoil.  I then sprinkled a little powdered chicken boilloun in the stock, and a little inside the cavity.  It came out wonderful!  The leftovers make a killer chicken salad too!  Definatly a keeper!

I have read the other reviews and am stumped by people who complain about chicken that falls off the bone? Would people rather it be dry and chewy? Well speaking for my family we loved it and we added plenty of spice, skipped the foil and added gravy and it was wonderful and will be made again and again and the recipe will be passed on to others. Thanks, Cara - Severn, MD

I give this 5 stars because it is the most tender chicken I have ever made in my life.  I did have to buy a bigger crockpot as the chicken I bought was way too big for my small one.  But I did brush it with some butter put some salt, pepper, and garlic powder on the outside.  Made the three balls of aluminum foil.  Did not put any liquid in there either.  Did it on high for 1 hour and then had it go on low for 8 more.  When I tried to get the chicken out, it broke in half, which is how tender it was.  The flavor was okay, a little bland but nothing some salt and pepper couldn't fix.  My boyfriend loved it.  Would not rub with butter next time as it made your mouth a bit fatty when eating it.  Will definitely make again with some different flavors.  Thanks.

If what you want it’s an “everyday chicken recipe” this is not bad at all. I made this last night and my husband loved it. I took in consideration what some of the reviewers had to say and I did change the recipe a little bit. I used the potatoes (peeled..you MUST peel them otherwise it look like you cooked the dished 3 weeks ago..it doesn’t look good at all), baby carrots an onions along with the ½ cup chicken broth. I liked the idea of rubbing butter on the legs (I used 4 very large legs) but to make it a little “healthier” I used “I can't believe is not butter - Spray” and on top of that I sprinkled the spices…it came up great!...but again.. This is an everyday chicken…not a fancy dish!  

PS/Definitely take off the skin…it will absorb the flavor much better!

This was absolutely amazing the only reason I did four stars is because it has major changes. The most important is next time I will use chicken parts rather than a whole chicken. The chicken disintegrated into a gross mess and I didn't get much meat out of it.  I put 1 cup of broth in the bottom then rather than slow cooked aluminum (yum!) I made a base of potatoes carrots onions and whole garlic cloves.  Then I made a butter mix with 1/4 cup of butter and 1 tsp each of salt pepper garlic onion powder paprika and poultry seasoning.  I rubbed this under and over the skin.  When it was all done I made gravy out of the juices and WOW this was easy and very good, definately worth trying.

I JUST HAD DINNER WITH THIS WONDERFUL CHICKEN AND TO LET YOU KNOW ITS 100% DELICIOUS!!!! BUT I MADE A FEW CHANGES, I RUBBED IN THE WHOLE CHICKEN SKIN WITH REAL BUTTER, GARLIC, SPRINKLED THE LEMON/PEPPER OF MRS. DASH, KOSHER SALT (LIKE HAWAIIAN SALT), GARLIC POWDER,MINCED CELERY AND PUT IN THE CAVITY OF THE CHICKEN, LOTS OF GARLIC IN THERE TOO!! POURED SOME CHICKEN BROTH ON BOTTOM OF THE BALLED UP ALUMINUM FOIL, PUT LITTLE BUTTER IN THE BOTTOM OF CROCK POT, RUBBED THE WHOLE CHICKEN THOROUGHLY WITH BUTTER OUTSIDE TOO OF THE CHICKEN AND THE HAWAIIAN SALT AND THE MRS. DASH LEMON PEPPER, THEN LET IT COOK ON HIGH FOR AN HOUR, THEN TURNED IT DOWN TO COOK ON LOW FOR 7 HOURS THEREAFTER, TURNED OUT 100% MOIST, FALL OFF THE BONE, TASTY!!!! MAKE SURE YOU MAKE RICE AND THICKEN THE GRAVY ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CROCK  POT, (THICKEN WITH CORN STARCH), THEN POUR THE GRAVY ON THE RICE AND ON THE CHICKEN...ONE WINNER FOR SURE!! ALOHA MARTHY FROM OAHU HAWAII!!

I cooked thighs and I thought they came out somewhat dry. I started it at 7 am and ate at 5:30. I will try againwith a whole chicken and not cook as long (if I can find someone to turn on the Crock Pot after I go to work.)

I highly recomment this recipe to anyone with a tight schedule.  I usually place the chicken in the cooker prior to leaving for work. By the time I return home the house smells delicious and the chicken is ready for dinner. I added extra seasonings especially paprika to ensure the chicken has some color to it.

This was probably the best chicken I have ever cooked!  Every member of the family was a member of the "clean plate" club.  I seasoned with garlic salt, paprika & rosemary (inside & out) & used lots of seasoning.  It definitely will be cooked again & again for its taste and simplicity.

Super easy and juicy...Makes the whole house smell great! But I did add a little garlic powder, onion powder, cajun seasoning, and a sprinkle of parsley. My husband loved it. The aluminum foil is a great idea because the chicken doesn't sit in any fat so it also makes it a healthy dish.I have passed this recipe on to friends and family. Thank You!

I tried this recipe and made just a few changes.  Instead of a whole chicken, I used ground venison.  I rubbed the meat all over with salt, pepper and cinnamon and browned the meat in the oven. Instead of aluminum foil, I placed the venison on a couple of coconut halves in the slow cooker, poured a bottle of cognac over it, and cooked it on low for 10 hours.  I turned out soooo good.  I served it with brown rice and sauerkraut.  My kids, who are picky eaters, LOVED it.

I was most impressed at how it crisped up on the outside, and how juicy it was on the inside.   I just rubbed with oil and put on a lot of "Tony's" season and that was it.    The tin foil on the bottom is a brilliant idea....

My crock pot whole chicken turned out very tender.  I cooked on low the whole time for 8 hrs.  I think a little less time would be better since it just fell apart from the bone and was almost mushy.  I used additional seasonings:  2 tsp salt, 2 tsp paprika, dash cayenne, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp thyme, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp pepper and onion on bottom.  I did not use the rolled up tin foil the second time I did it and it was fine.  I also rubbed a little oil on the chicken before putting the seasonings on and under the skin.

Just made this for supper tonight, used salt and pepper, paprika, thyme, garlic and onion powder and a bit of sage for the seasoning. Woke up late, so put it on high for 4.5-5 hrs, turned out like the rotisserie chickens you can buy at grocery store, or Swiss chalet chicken. Sooooo yummy and moist. I'll definitely be doing this again! Four of us ate and the chicken is just a pile of bones now :) Had potatoes and fresh beans, peas, kale, turnip and beets, what a feast!

Mixed together lemon pepper, garlic salt, onion powder, salt and a little pepper in a bowl. Prepped chicken and rubbed it all over. From the time I opened the chicken until it went in the crockpot took 4 minutes (the crock pot timed it). All in all, that's fast prep! Cooked a 5.75 pound chicken for 4 1/2 hours on high. It was perfectly done and so juicy, it temped at 180-190 all over. I used the aluminum foil method and put some white wine in the bottom. Great!

Delicious!  If you want to make it yourself, this is the way to go.  I must say though, you can get them already delcicious and cooked at the grocery store for about the same price.  Sometimes it feels good to make it yourself, and sometimes you just want to save the time.

Easiest recipe there ever was.  I, like other reviewers, chose to put some onion in the body cavity and some veggies like celery, carrot and onion, under the chicken.  I added about a 1/2 cup of chicken broth, but I don't think it is absolutely necessary as the crock fills with yummy juices that, after draining, can be used for making a heavenly gravy.  I've used this recipe a couple of times now and will continue to do so.

If you're looking for a chicken to impress guests, this isn't the one for you.  But if you're looking for a tender, juicy chicken that couldn't be simpler, look no further.  It's a good base recipe to dress your chicken up however you like it.  I like it simple, so I stuck with the recipe and I love it.  I made pan gravy from the drippings - yum.  Thanks for a super easy chicken recipe.  I put it in before bed and I am having the best lunch ever.

I don't have much to add that hasn't already been said. Super easy, delicious, and versatile. I don't use the aluminum foil and I create a different rub each time I make this recipe. I also put the rub under the skin instead of on top.

It looks like lots of people customize this recipe, and I was no different.  I caught an excellent sale on cut-up chickens, so I used pieces.  I sprinkled the pieces liberally with garlic salt and lemon pepper, then I sauteed them skin-side-down in EV olive oil.  I "baked" them on wads of foil in the Crockpot for 7 hours.  From the pan drippings from the browning, I had enough to make milk gravy, which I augmented with drippings from the Crockpot.  Very simple and very delicious.

I have fixed this for 20 or more years in a slow cooker, My first time recipe came from Rival Slow Cooker booklet, all you did was season and put some butter or margarine in and you get an easy dinner, all you need is some mashed potatoes and something green. Chicken that falls off the bone. Use left overs for lunch or dinner tomorrow

This was just ok, not quite what I was expecting.  It was quite moist and fell off the bone.  Instead of using this as a method to prepare chicken for a main dish, I will use it as a way to prepare a chicken to be used in soups, and chicken salads.

I made this 2 nights ago and it was a huge hit with the family. I added a shake of dried sage as well  (personal preference.) I also used some of the flavorful drippings in the botton of the slow cooker when I made my top of the stove stuffing mix. Just fabulous.

Best thing to come out of my slow cooker yet (and I've made the zesty chicken BBQ and pot roast from this site ;)  ) Stuffed with onions, sat on carrots, celery and more onions and rubbed down right with Rotisserie seasoning. Fannnntastic. If you throw it on the grill to reheat, you get a crispy outside and super moist inside. Thanks for sharing!

I could not believe how easy and how tasty this recipe was!!! I used my favorite seasoning for chicken which is GOYA Adobo (with pepper) and I just season the chicken inside and out and throw a few pats of butter on/in it. This is now a winter staple at my house!!

Used a 4lb bird, cooked it like instructed, and it was super moist and yummy.  Used a spice mix we like, rubbed it inside and out and under the skin.  Added half an onion and half a lemon to the cavity.  Rubbed the skin with oil just before cooking and it browned nicely.  The balled-up aluminum foil worked great-no sogggy skin.

I followed the commented section and used the onion and rubbed under the skin with the spices.  It was pretty good but still a bit bland.

This was pretty good, though it turned out to be a bit dry inside the chicken.   But the meat fell off the bones easily.

Best whole chicken ever.  Instead of using wadded up aluminum foil, we rested the chicken on potatoes! Genius and delicious!  Coat with olive oil.  Also throw some carrots in there, you won't regret it!

I've tried this recipe in 2 different slow cookers and the white meat always gets really dry.  And that was with a 4 lbs bird.  I can't imagine smaller bird surviving the cooking process.

Wow, talk about tender! Thankfully we don"t eat the skin because it will not crisp up much. But after taking the soft skin off the chicken, it was amazing, better than rotisserie! To make the chicken very flavorful throughout, I quartered and onion and put 5 cloves of fresh garlic in cavity. I also put some onion and couple of carrots on bottom of crock. I did use the tinfoil balls under the chicken. I liberally applied everglades seasoning in cavity and over skin. The only problem with this chicken is that it falls apart from taking out of crock pot, good problem to have I guess. Cooked on low for 9 hours while at work.

Juicy and delicious! Used a rub of garlic, paprika, pepper, thyme, salt, onion powder, and cayenne pepper - rubbed under skin and on top as well. Stuffed with 1 onion cut up and 3 cloves of garlic. Wrapped potatoes in tinfoil and placed chicken breast side down over top. Cooked a 6 lb chicken for 3 hours on high, and 4 on low. Turned out perfect. Meat fell off the bone! Potatoes were soft and mashed. No need to add extra broth/water to bottom. Could have used drippings for gravy if wanted.

Absolutely delicious and so simple! I did what the others recommended and added potatoes, pealed and quartered and carrots, diced with a chopped onion instead of the aluminum foil at the bottom, and added 1/2 a cut of chicken broth at the bottom. A 1/4 would have been enough as the juices from the chicken practically filled the pot, but it made a delicious gravy when mixed with a white sauce of flour and water. I also quartered the chicken as last time I made this recipe it didn't cook all the way through. I would repeat this recipe for years to come!

If I rate this as the recipe calles I would give it a 4 but with my additions its deffinately a 5. I added some crushed garlic and added the rest of the ingredients to butter. I left the skin on the whole chicken but separated it from the meat. I smeared the butter mixture between the skin and meat. I also added a chicken cube in the bottom of the crockpot with a little water to give it a little extra taste. It turned out excelent. I am making this again for sure. The chicken came out so tender and juicy. Using balls of foil at the bottom helps alot, the chicken doesn't stick to the bottom and the meat doesn't turn out to soft. Thank you very much for sharing.

This is such a great way to make chicken! I did mine breast down on the foil balls, and I rubbed it all over with garlic powder, seasoned salt and paprika (sprinkled some inside the cavity as well). High for an hour and low for 7; the breast was a tiny bit dry but everything else was nice and juicy. I used a 5 pounder. The house smelled great and I will definitely do this again--just as easy as picking up a grocery store rotisserie chicken! This is going to make awesome chicken salad.

5 star method but to be truly delicious, this recipe needs more seasoning.  Make a rub with salt and pepper by doubling the paprika, adding garlic powder and a pinch of cayenne, and few tsps of sugar to mimic caramelization on the skin.  Throw an onion and some chopped celery in the cavity.  Also, roast breast side down to keep the breast meat moist... you won't get the bird out in one piece anyhow so it doesn't really matter how it looks.  Easy way to prepare a delicious chicken.

Wow did this come out moist! I wanted veggies, so I put onions, carrots, and celery under the bird instead of the foil balls. I also added some garlic powder to the seasonings. For a 3 lb. chicken I cooked it 1.5 hrs. on high and 4 hours on low and the meat themometer read 175 degrees.

Excellent! I put red potatos at the bottom instead of tin foil and cooked on high for 1 hour and on low for 5 hours and it came out perfect! Also added Rosemary inside and out and the aroma and taste was fantastic.

This probably could be very good, but I would suggest that the first time you make it, do it on a day when you'll be home so you can check on it. The recipe says to cook for 9 to 11 hours, but I checked mine after 4.5 hours and it was thoroughly done -- overdone, in fact. The white meat was very dry though I cooked it upside down, and even the dark meat was much drier than I would have expected. It's a great idea and I'll probably try it again, but keep in mind that slow cookers vary wildly and you may need to adjust your cooking time.

Great recipe.  Cut up a few potatoes and onion, added salt and pepper, and put them in the bottom of the pan.  Added butter under the skin of the chicken.  Seasoned it with italien seasonings, garlic powder, parsley, salt and pepper.  Cooked on HIGH for 4 hours.  It presented beautifully on a platter with the potatoes all around.  Very tender, tasted great!

Loved it...but I think of it as more a technique than a recipe.  After reading the comments of others, I used about 1/2 cup of broth in the bottom of the pot and used carrott "chunks" to elevate the chicken.  I seasoned the chicken inside & out with mojo seco, freshly ground black pepper and sea salt then stuffed the cavity with a small onion, halved, a large clove clove of garlic, smashed, and fresh rosemary.  Since I started late in the day I cooked it on high (OLD crockpot) for about 4.5 hours.  My 2 cats were going nuts over the aroma!  I served it with couscous ladled with the carrots and broth - YummmmYummmm!  Perfect!  The chicken was seasoned through and through and not at all dry.  I'll put this version in my permanent file but will probably try the technique with other seasoning themes.  I'm already thinking Greek & Moroccan.

Delicious! Fall off the bone tender and so moist! It couldn't get any easier to 'bake' a chicken. I couldn't find anything less than 4-1/2 pounds and I only added about an hour on Low (after 1 hour on High) making it 11 hours (instead of 8-10) in the crockpot. Will surely make this again!!

Super easy! The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly (although I skipped the one hour on high--I make this right before heading off to work, so I just cook it on low for 9 hours and skip the aluminum foil). It was great! Now, I just use whatever spices I have on hand (Old Bay is a favorite, since I live in Maryland. :-))

I suggest leaving the skin on, but piercing it all over with a fork or knife to allow the spices to get into the meat. Marinate the chicken overnight for maximum flavor.

Collect the juices at the bottom of the slow cooker when this is done to make a FANTASTIC gravy. Serve with mashed potatoes for a quick and yummy meal.

It was the best whole chicken dish I have ever made. I seasoned thew chicken with lemon pepper, onion powder, and garlic salt on the outside of the chicken and under the skin. I had a 5 pound bird and it only took 2 hour on high and 3.5 hours on low and it had fell apart.The meat was juicy and tender. It feels so good not to have to turn the oven on the cook a chicken

The only thing I did differently was soak my chicken in salt water overnight-1/2 cup salt to enough water to cover.  This gets the salt into the meat and also makes the breast meat nice and moist.  I also added the veges on the bottom and a chopped onion inside the chicken.  GREAT!

This turned out perfectly....fall apart, moist, just great.  I devised an aluminum foil 2-strap "sling" to rest the chicken on over the aluminum foil balls and with the help of my husband it was lifted out in one piece onto the platter for serving!  Thx

This was delicious!! The only problem I had was that it fell apart when I took it out of the crockpot but that was because I cooked too long--not the recipe's fault! I prepped my chciken the night before with a dry rub of paprika, rosemary and garlic powder. I poked holes underthe skin, slid some butter and also seasoned under there. I let that marinate all night. The next day I added chopped onions, celery, fresh garlic and another pat of butter in the cavity and added to the crockpot with potatoes, onions and carrots. I didnt add any water. Cooked for 10 hours on low. (Next time I would probably only do 8) I took the chicken out and put under the broiler on low for about 5 minutes. Smelled soooo good and tasted even better!! Served with fresh rolls. Deeeelish!!! Thanks for a great recipe :)

Yep, this works. I have never had to add liquid, but for those of you who have heard of it, Herbamare is great with this chicken. If you're cooking for 2, you can use smaller pieces. I've tried wings, drumsticks, whole legs too (I removed the skin first, and sprinkled the meat directly, to save fat). All of them came out great.

This is a good start to a great recipe. This needs to have butter pats put under the skin and in the cavity. Then, the chicken needs to be generously sprinkled with a variety of spices including salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder. You can add any other spices to your liking.

Maybe I got lucky, but I loved this recipe.  I used a 7 1/2 pound roaster, added sliced garlic cloves under the skin of the breast, salt, pepper, paprika, and placed 1/2 onion in the cavity.  Not only did it brown nicely, but it was extremely juicy and flavorful. I worried about NOT adding any liquid, but it made a whole lot of chicken broth as well.  Even my picky family enjoyed this one.

Loved it!  I made 2 for a family gathering, and it was so easy and good!  I can't wait to do one just for my family.  Try adding a 1/2 onion & celery stalk inside the chicken as it bakes, also

I did what others suggested - put chicken broth in the slow cooker, stuffed the chicken with celery and onion and added more spices, etc.  I had to make 2 chickens so did one this way in the slow cooker, and the other I made exactly the same (chicken broth and all) and put it in the oven for 1.5 hrs at 375 degrees and in the end the slow cooker one was quite bland and the other one was delicious!  We will definitely make this chicken again with the extras mentioned, but in the oven!

Slow cooked a 6lb whole chicken. I used the recommended seasonings plus added minced garlic in cavity and liberal shaking of Mrs. Dash Herb & Garlic seasoned salt. Yes, it was golden brown and a "fall of the bone" chicken, but we were surprised that taste was nothing to write home about. I'll stick to hour of marinating and use our grill's rotisserie.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this chicken turned out.  I thought it would be anemic looking--instead it WAS golden brown in color.  It must have been the skin/paprika combo.  I used bone-in and skin-on chicken breasts.  I used a very generous amount of paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, seasoning salt, and pepper under the skin.  I cooked on high for 3 1/2 hours and the chicken was on the dry side but still really wonderful.  Loved the foil idea--I really can learn something new everyday!

I couldn't believe how delicious this was compared to the ease in making it! I didn't cut up the chicken, I just seasoned it to taste (I put some celery stalks inside the body cavity for extra flavor). Gotta go...I have to e-mail this to all my friends!

I made this recipe yesterday using a whole chicken.  I was very liberal with the salt, pepper and paprika.  The chicken was moist and flavorful, and it was so easy to prepare.  My entire family liked it.  I will definitely make this again.  I didn't really understand the reasoning behind the aluminum foil balls, but I did it anyway, and it apparently worked!

This was as easy as it could get, but I would have liked a little more flavor.  It was good, but we like things with a little bolder flavor.  I will make this again, just modify it with some garlic, etc.  Thanks for the easy meal.

Yes this recipe was very easy, but I wouldn't make it again. It was more like a steamed chicken. The breast meat did shred quite easily but was very dry. Definately season your chicken to taste before cooking but don't expect anything like a 'baked' chicken.

This turned out excellent. I did not cook it for as long as the recipe said because I did not want it to fall apart. I used cheesecloth (recommended in a review) and put carrots, onions and sweet potatoes underneath a small (3lb) chicken. I also added broth and white wine and used the juices to make gravy. Delicious!  I will definitely make this again.

This was about as easy as it gets, big bonus in my world. The second time I made it I stuffed the cavity with carrots, an onion and 2 cloves of garlic.
Saved the bones for slow cooker chicken stock too.

Turns out perfect every time. However, I do rub the spices under the skin and simply turn it on low for 8 hours. The meat slides right off the bone.

I had a 5 lb roasting chicken. Seasoned it with Emerils chicken rub and did the foil at the bottom. Also I threw in the pot onions cut up and half a green pepper.

I stuffed the chicken with shallots, and an onion.  I cooked on High for  6 1/2 hrs. I flipped it the first 2 hrs. I started it breast down and finshed breast up. Was falling off the bone, but still lacked flavor even though I practically seasoned the hell out of it. Next time I'll let it marinate overnight and will try to purchase a flavor injector.

I made this recipe as directed but did use a slightly larger bird.  The chicken tasted good, but 8 hours is too long to cook it.  Fall off the bone is fine to an extent, but after 8 hours you could not pick the chicken up out of the pot to serve it.  This makes it hard to give someone white or dark meat as all you have is a pile of chicken.

So I was all set to make this recipe, but could not find the lid to my crockpot!  So instead, I had to bake in the oven at 350 for about 2 hours.  Also, my store didn't have any 3 pound chickens, the smallest was 5 1/2, so that's what I used.  I loaded the bottom of the roasting pan with cut up potatoes, carrots and celery (make sure to season the veggies)  and prepared the chicken as the recipe states.  I did follow another reviwers suggestion of putting the butter under the skin for crispy skin, yum!  But the veggies began to dry out and there wasn't any drippings so we tossed in a can of chicken broth.  It turned out wonderful!  I barely put the pan on the table before the family attacked the dish.  Next time I will get a bigger chicken because of the complaints about the lack of leftovers.  Thanks for the recipe!

I prepped this in the afternoon, using the seasoning from Sarah’s Dry Rubbed Chicken  (also from this site).  I used the seasoning on the skin, under the skin and in the cavity.  I also put some carrot, celery and onion chunks in the cavity.  Just before going to bed, I put some more carrot, celery and onion chunks in the bottom of the slow cooker, along with a can of chicken broth.  Put my seasoned chicken in and set the slow cooker to low.  My chicken was done and falling off the bone when I got up the next morning, about 8 1/2 hours later.  I used this chicken to make two kinds of chicken soup.  This is a great way to let your slow cooker do the work for you!

I must have read the description wrong, but I thought it was supposed to be "golden brown" and looked baked. While very tasty, it didn't become golden for me at all. The skin turned rubbery and slid off. Very tender, but was looking for "golden" baked chicken in my crockpot.

This was a great recipe!  I have tried to cook a whole chicken in the crock pot before, but it never turned out well.  This time we really enjoyed it!  The only change I made was putting chunks os onions in the bottom instead of foil.

Oh yeah this was excellent. Didn't do the foil balls thing, just put onions and carrots under the chicken, sprinkled with paprika, thyme, salt and pepper and left it on low for about 10 hours. Turned out amazing fall off the bone chicken. Served over brown rice.

This was my first attempt at cooking a whole chicken. I put a quartered whole onion and three crushed cloves of garlic inside, and seasoned it with salt, pepper, paprika and a tiny bit of garlic powder. I cooked on high for two hours, then low for eight hours. I added my veggies at the last 45 minutes and they came out perfect. The chicken, while having fallen apart when I tried to take it out, was still noticeably dry. I don't know if it was me or the slow cooker, but I was really not expecting it to be dry at all. The leftovers made great chicken sandwiches though! The next time I try this however I'm going to try a lemon pepper chicken for a tad more flavor.

other than the seansoning i followed the directions exactly. no flavor what so ever and i even rubbed it down with mccormick's rotisserie chicken seasoning. i usually roast my chickens and that is what i will continue to do because this was not good. the meat did literally fall off the bone which was annoying but the white meat was still super dry. would not make again and i would not recomend. i roast my chickens according to martha stewart's directions and it always comes out perfect but we were having a busy day so i thought i would try this.

This recipe didn't work out for me.  The chicken turned out boiled instead of baked/roasted.  I cooked in slow cooker as recommended but I think it would cook better in a roaster.

The chicken was wonderful!   I found a Purdue roaster (6 lbs) on sale.  I filled the cavity with a quartered onion and sprinkled garlic poweder and paprika all over it.  I did add a bit of vegetable broth to bottom as I had to shove the bird in and didn't think it was actually touching the bottom.  I set it on high for 5 hours and watched for the pop-up timer in the roaster to let me know it was ready.  The meat was moist and flavorful.  

I threw the skin and bones back into the drippings with another onion, celery and carrots and filled the pot with hot water.  24 hours later I had the most wonderful stock for homemade chicken noodle soup!  The house smells wonderful!

Good, easy and moist.  I did season the skin and between the skin and the meat.  Added potatoes and carrots then put the chicken in the crockpot.  Meat just fell off the bone.

I added generous amounts of paprika, garlic, s&p, and poultry seasoning to it, as well as rubbing it down completely with olive oil. While it baked, I used some of the oil/juice on the bottom to drizzle over the top (to keep it moister). I have a brand new crockpot so I only had to cook my 5 1/2 pound whole chicken for about 4 1/2 - 5 hours. It literally, as others have said, fell off the bone. It was SO moist and SO delicious! I could have easily made gravy from the drippings if I had chosen to. I didn't use the foil and actually didn't use anything underneath. It would have been easier to move the bird if I had, but oh well. I would definitely recommend this.

Used 8 chicken legs instead. Covered them in paprika, S+P and let them sit overnight in the fridge. The next morning, I set them into our crockpot over the top of foil balls. Be careful to not over cook them. I cooked mine on low for 9 hours and they were borderline overcooked. But they still turned out nicely browned, and had good flavor. Reminded me alot of rotisserie chicken from the grocery store!

Very good and super easy. Tried it the first time with chicken broth and veggies and the chicken was moist but the skin got soggy and was not edible so we lost all the spices. Made it again with the tinfoil, and broiled it for about 10 minutes after just to be sure and it was excellent!

The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the seasoning did not penetrate the meat, it was just on the skin. Next time I will pull the skin off, add seasoning (salt, pepper, pwd garlic, and paprika) then put the skin back on.   Very moist and falls off the bone. I put diced apple, onion, and butter in the cavity to ensure the moistness.   Will definitely make this again!

Very moist though very little taste.  I cooked my 3 1/4 lb chicken on high for 5 1/2 hours, over baby potatoes, carrots and parsnips, and while it didn't fall off the bone - as other reviewers reported - which was okay, it was extremely moist.  And because I added ~ 1 cup of chicken broth, I was able to make a yummy gravy which made up for the lack of taste in the chicken itself.  Lastly, the chicken was too light in color for our taste so after cooking for 5 1/2 hours, I placed the chicken in a pan and broiled it in the oven for 5 minutes until the top turned brown. I would definitely make chicken again by this method as it's extremely easy and turns out very moist!

I was sick when I made this so I couldn't tast it at all. My husband and kids loved this and have asked me to make it again. BTW- followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT that I used a whole FROZEN chicken and cooked on high for 8 hours. Plenty juicy, I just couldn't taste it because I was so stuffy :(. Looking forward to making it again and being able to taste it!

the family raved at how juicy and tender this bird was!  Not big fans of white meat, they tore into it and I used the leftovers in a chicken pot pie.  Wonderful!  I'll definately make this one again... and again... and again!!

Very easy!  I put the chicken on round yellow onions, added one can of chicken broth (I should have used less broth though), fresh ground salt and pepper, plus garlic powder and old bay seasoning.  Cooked on low heat for 10 hours.  The chicken turned out delicious, moist, and tasty.  It fell off the bone.  Served it with rolls and mashed potatoes.    A few days later, I shredded the chicken and made homemade chicken noodle soup.  My fiance loved it and he is normally a picky eater.

I agree the cooking time is too long.  A 3-4 lb. bird can be done in 6 hours.  On a humorous note, my husband took care of completing our dinner with sides.  When he tried to pull the bird out of the pot, the legs, wings, and skin slid right off.  My husband and I could not stop laughing.

My family loved this recipe. So easy, moist and tender!  I made a few changes also, I cut up potatoes, carrots, and onions and made a bed on the bottom of  the crockpot for the chicken to rest on. I added about a quarter to a half cup of cooking wine to the veggies. I seasoned the bird with paprika, garlic salt, and pepper. Cooked as said on the recipe and it came out oh so wonderful! Thank you!

Lots of reviews note that the chicken is overcooked. I became a member just to post this: it all depends on your slow cooker! I've tried this recipe a couple of times on my Morphy Richards slow cooker, and 9 hours on low leaves the chicken underdone (with tinfoil wrapped potatoes on the bottom, rather than bunched tinfoil). This in comparison to others, who complain of overdone chicken in 5 hours. For me, 11 hours on low cooks a great chicken... which is just right, if I turn it on when I wake up and turn it off at the end of a long day at work.

Mmm mmm good! 2 hrs & 20 minutes on high did it for me. Used potatos instead of foil balls. I did brown the chicken tho, but it didnt help much since the chicken ended up kind of soggy. The chicken wasnt really pretty but it still tasted sooo good! One thing I'm a little confused about tho... Why's it called "baked"?

I, too, changed it up.  I have a large crock pot, so I cooked a 5 lb roaster.  I peeled and quartered three small potatoes and placed them on the bottom.  I tossed in a package of frozen crinkle cut carrots.  I coated the chicken, inside and out, with olive oil and salted and peppered it liberally.  I filled the cavity with frozen small onions and placed the chicken into this "nest" of vegetables, then poured in about a cup of chicken broth.  I cooked it for 3 hours on high then 4 more on low.  Everything came out perfect.  Not over flavored or spiced (for my mom, who can't take heavy flavoring at the moment.)  Veggies were tender but not mush, chicken was cooked through but not falling apart.  Great basic recipe!

LOVE this!  Never could find a great way to make a whole chicken in the crockpot as I work 8-9 hour shifts and most chicken crockpot recipes cook for only 4 hours!  This is PERFECT!  I have mase this several times and have followed the directions as specified.  The chicken comes out exactly as if you had oven-roasted it the old-fashioned way--but you get to skip all the hassle!  My family loves it, and I have leftover chicken for the next night's supper.  A working mother's dream!  :)

This was delicious! I skipped the foil but instead put some chicken broth in as well as some carrots, potatoes and an onion.  I covered the chicken itself with olive oil, salt, pepper, and paprika and cooked this on high for 4 hours...soooo good!!

Who would have thought about placing the foil balls in to hold the chicken up! This prevents the bottom of the chicken from being too "rubbery"...Great Idea!  It came out so moist & tender and waited to put the veggies in last.  I boil the carrots, potatoes & onions in chicken broth on the stove top til just tender then place them in for last 1/2 hour or so.  They hold up better then staying in the pot all day since they seem to break down.  I've also used seasoned salt or Old Bay in place of the paprika for a different flavor and it always turns out YUMMY! Thanks for the recipe and the crockpot technique :)

Excellent!  Very tender, we loved it.  The only advice I have is to be careful for loose bones, as the slow-cooker made everything tender and collapse.  I definitely will make it again.

I love the convienence of this recipe!  I always "kill two birds with one stone".  I have a large crockpot and so I cook two chickens.  I place one cooked chicken under the broiler to present a beautifully "baked" chicken.  I then debone the other and make enchiladas, casseroles, etc. during the week.  I also place the seasonings under the skin.

I put a half thawed chicken in the crockpot at about 7:30 this morning. I set it for 10 hours on low. At about the 8 and a half hour mark, I switched to high. I added about a half cup of water at the start. I ended up with about a cup of drippings that made really good gravy. The chicken came out in pieces and fell right off the bone.

DON'T ADD LIQUIDS!  Very good and simple. Many people are complaining about it being dry, and I think it's because they are adding some form of liquid. I would HIGHLY recommend not doing that. The secret to slow cooker cooking is not adding water which will boil the meat because a slow cooker will not allow water to evaporate. They actually recommend cutting any liquids by 20% when cooking in a slow cooker. That said, if you follow this as written (save for maybe spicing it different), it turns out moist and delicious.

I set carrots, celery and onions on the bottom, and 6 chicken thighs on top of them. 8 hours later the meat was falling off the bone. It was great served with a rice pilaf.

Delicious!! Made this for dinner yesterday for my husband and step-son and they loved it! Their words were 'Excellent!' The chicken was very tender and juicy, and had the most wonderful flavor. I quartered potatoes, added celery stalks and baby carrots and the juices cooked them just great. *Footnote* I had about a 5 lb chicken, and initially I didn't take this into consideration for timing; we did eat much later than I had planned. :o)

Wonderful recipe! My husband and adult son pretty much ate the entire chicken between them! Reviews were very helpful (thanks!). I used the aluminum foil balls. I added chicken broth and red wine to the bottom and replenished during cooking.  I put several cloves of pan roasted garlic inside the chicken and added a chopped onion, a few chopped carrots and a few chopped celery stocks to the wine/broth. I rubbed the chicken with paprika and Mrs. Dash garlic mix.  I cooked on high about two hours and then low about five hours. It was very most but I could tell it would've started to go dry if I had let it go longer. Next time only one hour on high. Also I flipped it three times. Don't know if this helped or not since I'd not made it before but the end result was certainly delicious!  I strained some of the juice through cheese cloth and whisked it with some cornstarch for YUMMY gravy! Served with green beans and garlic mashed potatoes and it was a HIT. After carving the chicken, I threw the remains back in the pot, covered with water, and cooked overnight for a WONDERFUL homemade broth! Love this recipe! I don't know what the reviewer who gave it one star was talking about? The recipe clearly calls for a whole chicken. That review ought to be removed.

This was awesome, I have used the foil method before when I was out of potatoes, saw it on a cooking show...
This is an excelleant recipe for my very picky BF who LOVES Chicken and in the slow cooker stays so moist and tastey, I have never made anything in 34 years of cooking that has ever come out dry in a slow cooker...
One more thing, THIS RECIPE DID NOT SAY TO CUT IT UP, SO NEXT TIME CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO WOULD NEVER WRITE A BAD REVIEW IF THEY DIDN'T TRY A RECIPE, SHOULD REALLY MAKE SURE THEY ARE FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS...THERE IS EVEN A PIC OF A WHOLE BIRD...LOL Well I guess that is what makes the World Go Round...
TYVM This Recipe is really Great, and I make it at least 3 times a month and it works great everytime..

I love slow cooker chicken, and have been making this for years.  Some of my variations include:  Salsa chicken - take cut up chicken parts, lay them in the crock pot and pour a jar of salsa over it (use your favorite variety; Orange chicken - cut up an orange, squeeze the juice over the chicken and stuff the cavity with the orange rinds you just squeezed; BBQ chicken: place cut up chicken in crock pot and pour a cup of your favorite BBQ sauce over it. The possibilities are endless!

I skinned the entire chicken and seasoned with olive oil and spices.  I also placed the chicken breast side down.  When I've told people about this recipe they couldn't believe you could bake a whole chicken in a slow cooker.  My family and I love this recipe and cooking technique.  Great recipe and technique!!

I was surprised to find that the chicken had browned so nicely in my Crockpot. I followed the recipe exactly except put cut up carrots under the chicken along with the foil. The meat was very very tender after cooking on low for about 9 hours and tasted great. Nine hours might be a tad too long however so next time will try to keep it to 8  I want to try it with different seasonings and maybe some potatoes along with the foil. I served the chicken and carrots with some leftover cooked brown rice which I had in the fridge, drizzling the juice on the rice. So nice to have a delicious meal all ready when I arrive home from work.

I just cooked this on low for the entire time and it's perfect. I salted the chicken under the skin as much as I could and that turned out great, I put the potatoes etc in first and the chicken on top, upside down so the fat runs through all the meat. It's a great recipe

I should've taken a picture while it was in the slow cooker because it completely fell apart when I tried to take it out.  I used a 4 lb. chicken and 9 hours was plenty of time.  I put onion and whole cloves of garlic in the cavity and large pieces of celery and carrots on the bottom (instead of using the tinfoil) and added some chicken seasoning.  No need to add any extra liquid, the chicken produced enough to make a gravy.  I strained the juices into a measuring cup, made a rue using about 1/4 C flour and about 4 T of the fat that floated to the top and skimmed off the rest of the fat.  After that browned for a couple minutes I slowly whisked in the remaining liquid and cooked it until it thickened.

I wadded the aluminum foil into balls, but my chicken wouldn't fit in the crock pot, so I had to make them smaller.  I didn't find the chicken "baked" more like it boiled.  I stuffed the cavity with carrots, celery and onion to give it more flavor.  I wasn't impressed with the baked chicken, but the bouillon in the crock pot and the carcass made some amazing Chicken Soup!!  Though it was simple to make, I wouldn't make again.  Sorry!

So good!  I stuffed the cavity with a white onion and some garlic cloves.  I also cut an peeled back the skin and seasoned on top of the meat then recovered with the skin to keep in moisture. It was fall off the bone and the meat was so flavorful. I cooked it for 4 hours on high because I was a little short on time.

Leave the skin on just next time take the neck on the chicken and carefully part chicken's skin from body just enough to put your hand under the skin,( like a pocket)baste body and and do same with legs and arms careful not to rip off the skin. You want to skin and the body to be equally if not more flavorful. Do that and I'm sure you'll totally love it.I do that with my chicken's and turkeys and I get good comments on the full flavor all throughout the chicken.Try that next time Guaranteed love it!

I also added garlic and I only cooked it on low for 5 hours, which seemed to be just right. It still was moist and fell off the bone, but not completely disintegrated or anything. I also put a cup of brown rice (next time I'll do two!) with a 1/4 cup of water underneath the chicken, and under that (directly on the bottom of the crock pot) was chopped onion, carrots, and frozen green beans. It was delicious!

I thought this recipe was a great way to get a delicious meal to the table without the work! I read some of the other reviews and decided to really spice things up by adding extra seasoning. Also instead of wadding up foil to put in the bottom of the slow cooker I cut 2 onions in half and laid them on the bottom of the cooker. I placed the chicken on top of the onions and it turned out great.

I made some modifications, so I gave it 4 stars for the great idea and method.  It's totally customizable for whatever your tastes are.  I added potatoes, carrots, and onions (along with 1/2 cup of water), and seasoned the chicken generously with garlic salt, seasoned salt, lemon pepper, and paprika.  Cooked it for 8 hours in the crockpot and had a fabulous dinner.  Beats turning on the oven for 2 hours to roast a chicken in the middle of summer!

Yum!  A refreshing change from eating cookout food and quick meals.  Season well with your favorite spices.  Definitely cut up some potatoes, carrots and dice a small onion to put under the chicken.  I also cooked it with 2 cups of chicken broth and ended up with alot of broth which made an excellent gravy.  We all had seconds and still had enough leftover to make chicken salad!

Very good recipe, and hardly no work at all!  At first I wasn't crazy about the skin as it didn't get crispy like I usually like it, however, my husband pointed out that we shouldn't be eating the skin anyway!  The chicken was so moist, and again it was so quick and easy to prepare, it is now a new favorite no fuss dinner!  I cooked the recipe exactly as written the first time I made it, and was pleased with the flavors.  I have since added some garlic and tarragon to the recipe.  I'm sure the possibilities are endless (lemon pepper, mesquite seasonings, carribbean jerk seasonings...just to name a few.)to change the look and flavor to suit your mood.  Thank you!!

Just like rotisserie chicken! Yum. Had to use some extra foil along the side of the chicken so that it wouldn't stick to the pot. Cooked a 5 lb chicken for about 9 hours total. Didn't have to baste, or use any extra vegetables- just salt, pepper and paprika. Perfection!

This couldn't have been easier or juicier!  I followed others' examples and used cut up onions and potatoes instead of tin foil.  I also cut up an apple that had been laying around my kitchen and it added a nice subtle sweetness.  I used Ms.Dash, seasonal all, and S&P to season it.  I also sprayed the whole concoction with butter flavored cooking spray.  I only cooked chicken thighs and so reduced my cooking time: 45 minutes on high, 3.5 hours on low, then just kept it warm until dinner time.  It was wonderful!!  Thank you Cotton!!

I give this 5 stars. I like the idea of the foil. I had a hard time getting it out of the crockpot, as it was ready to fall apart. It was delicious. I spiced it up with onions, garlic and other spices. I will make this again. It was so easy to make and delicious too.

I used 3 chicken breasts for this recipe (that is what I had on hand), and I cooked the chicken for 9 hours. It was too dry. Next time I will get my husband to turn it on on his lunch hour. I think 5 or 6 hours in the cooker on low should be plenty of time. Definitely worth trying again!

I got a new crock pot for Christmas and decided to try this recipe.  I did not cut the chicken up and stuffed it with celery, onion, etc.  I also sprinkled it with Mrs. Dash.  For something so simple it was very good!

The chicken came out very nice and tender, but I think it needs alot more spices, it tasted bland to me. Also, I'd put the spices on skinned chicken so the flavor stays on.

This recipe is so easy to make with such great results. Don't expect tons of flavor from your chicken unless you take the skin off before cooking, perhaps; however, it will be super-moist and falling off the bone. I tried this once as directed, and after comments that it needed "more spices", added a Middle East-influenced blend of spices plus several cloves of garlic in the cavity. Rave reviews - will add to the regular repertoire!

Well, upon reading the prior reviews.  I thought I would make some of my own adjustments and try this recipe.  First I lightly browned the "whole" chicken in my electric fry pan since some reviewers said that the chicken never browned in the slow cooker.  I used the foil balls and cooked on high for one hour.  I then turned it down to low and checked it in 5 hours.  The chicken was falling off of the bone and tasted dry, already.  Also, it wasn't as brown as when I first put it in.  I think there are better ways to make a chicken.  I might try it again, with browning it til crisp and then drastically reducing the cooking time.  If that doesn't work, forget it.

Followed the recipe to letter, except that I added extra seasoning as others have suggested.  Wonderful and simple!  Moist and tender, and best of all, it cooked while I was at work!

This is a great way to "bake" chicken if you have to go away the whole day and want to come back to enjoy a juicy and tender chicken. Put any seasioning you like. I am a Chinese. So I make a Chinese paper wrapped chicken with heavy salt seasoning. I placed the chicken on a big piece of wax paper. Then I rubbed the chicken with oil and the seasoning inside and out. Finally, I wrapped the chicken with the wax paper and put it in the slow cooker. It turned out to be really really good.

This chicken was moist but wiggly. I would prefer to use the traditional slow oven method. It's a good way to cook chicken to use at a future time in a different chicken recipe. To make removing easier- place chicken on cooking twine, knotted & tied together like a "net" When you pull the chicken up by the twine- it will be much easier taking it out of the slow cooker. This recipe is very easy but what it has in convenience it lacks in flavor. It needs more spices.

Quick and Easy!
This was a great recipe. I cooked it 1 hour on high and then 6 hours on low and I drained the juice about half way from the cooking time. Definitely a must keep recipe for the hectic weeks!

Great recipe! As others suggested, I put some vegetables in the bottom instead of the foil. I put carrots, onion and garlic. I rubbed the whole chicken with salt and pepper and a bit of butter. I did add a 1/4 cup of water early on but it wasn't necessary as it made plenty of stock. Add some carrots and small unpeeled potatoes halfway through. I will definitely make this again. Next time I will start breast side down and flip after awhile, as someone suggested, but it was delicious and so easy! Thanks!

I make this recipe regularly, and my boyfriend and his children love it. I, however, add onion and garlic in the cavity like other reviewers. I season the chicken with a creole seasoning. I cut medium potatoes in half and place them at the bottom of the crockpot instead of aluminum balls. Then add a couple cans of chicken broth. Place the chicken on top of the potatoes. I add carrots, onion, and garlic around the chicken. Plus, I add a couple bay leaves.

Really great and really easy!  I put onions, carrots and potatoes under the bird instead of foil balls and had a full meal with lots of leftover options too.  Now I'm watching for more whole chickens to go on sale so I can try this again!

This is absolutely the BEST recipe for slow cooker chicken that doesn't taste like slow cooker chicken.   The foil makes the chicken crisp, without drying...-I have given this recipe to many of my friends who love baked chicken but have a problem with soggy bottom/soft skin...everyone needs to try this method of slow cooking if they want crisp, tender chicken

Fixed as written. Although the skin was not crispy, it was OK. The taste of the chicken was very bland. I would rather cook in the oven for 1 1/2 hours and get the flavor and crispy skin. Maybe if you added more spices inside and out. The other thing I don't like about doing whole chickens in the crockpot is having to pick through the bones to get all the good dark meat. The breasts came out in two pieces, but I had to pick through bones to get the rest.

Awesome! I added more seasonings (garlic & onion powders, marjoram, thyme, etc) and used a bed of carrots, onions, and celery instead of the foil balls. Making it again soon. Thanks!

This is an easy way to prepare a whole chicken.  I really liked that the foil balls serve as a kind of rack that lifts the chicken out of the rendered fat.  Use a really good chicken and let the simple, true flavor come out.

I love this recipe.  I use whatever seasons I'm in the mood for at the time I make it.  I am a fan of putting seasonings/herbs/garlic & even lemon and/or lime leaves from my potted trees!  I will NEVER use aluminum balls to set the chicken on, but prefer either whole small potatoes or large/med halved and I imagine that other large veggies would serve well.  Also, NO liquid is required because this makes an amazing amount of chicken broth on it's own.  Later, after removing the chicken you can add water to make a soup base. The cooked chicken can be used so many ways in so many recipes - and don't forget just a plain old good chicken sandwich!

Made this over the weekend since it was very hot outside and I didn't want to fire up the oven.  This was very easy to make, but I was disappointed in the end result.  Like other reviewers have mentioned, the aroma while cooking was wonderful; however, even after seasoning the chicken liberally before slow cooking, it came out very bland.  We ended up adding the chicken to some fettucine noodles and alfredo sauce, which turned out tasty, but I think I'll stick to oven roasting chicken.

Simple and easy...not exciting, but a good easy recipe. I think next time I might cook it a little less time. I cooked 1 hour on high and 8 1/2 hours on low for a 5 pound chicken. Be careful trying to take it out of the slow cooker, it falls apart. The meat is tender.

It was very moist but it was very bland. I didn't use the foil. I put carrots and potatoes on the bottom. I also added 3 cups of Chicken Stock. If I make again I'll doing something different with the seasonings for sure... although the carrots and potatoes turned out pretty good!

This is a great basic recipe for crock pot chicken.  I read several reviews and added my own slant to it, just like the others.  I added carrots and onions and sweet potatoes and garlic at the bottom (instead of the foil) and added 1/2 cup broth on the bottom of the pot.  I also seasoned with paprika as in the original recipe, but also added garlic powder, salt, pepper, and an all-purpose seasoning.  I seasoned it under the skin along with some soft butter.  Olive oil can be used as well. I also stuffed the chicken with some of the veggies and garlic. I brought it to a party and it was delish!  Super easy recipe, I prepared it in the morning and cooked on low for 4 hours until I returned and cooked on high for 2 hours.

I made this recipe but instead of the foil I put potatoes, carrots and onions.  I used a 4.5lb chicken.  I should have removed the skin because it dripped off a lot of fat.  I put butter combined with garlic, salt and parsley all over the chicken.  Even though I added half a cup of white wine some parts were a bit dry, but it was great for a chicken pot pie, so no loss here.

10 hours is too long.  It gets dry. Also, I made it as is, but recommend using garlic, etc., as well as something in the cavity (onion, celery, orange) to give this more flavor.  It's something to do with a whole chicken, but now it's cheaper to just buy a rotisserie chicken at the grocery than do this.

I have been doing this for years but with a twist. I take a completely frozen chicken (4-5 lbs) Place it on the tin foil balls . Season it , put it on high for 8 hours checking it once about half way through to remove the inner bag . Thats it poof 8 hours later you have the best chicken ever. This is great in the summer.

Dee-lish! I've been looking for an easy baked chicken recipe that yields moist, flavorful chicken. This is it! I used bone-in breast and thighs, browned in olive oil, then rubbed on rotisserie chicken spices. Left the skin on, which helped keep in the moisture. Make sure you don't overbake and it will be tender and moist - will definitely make again.

This was ok. It definitely cooks faster than the directions. I took it out an hour early, and it was already a bit dry. I also added quite of additional seasonings, stuffing the bird with onion, celery and garlic, placing bits of butter and more garlic cloves under the skin, and rubbing the outside of the skin with rosemary, salt, pepper and paprika.

made this today...amazing taste.  didn't have chicken stock so I used water and 3 chicken cubes.  put some roasted garlic inside the chicken cavity.  was planning to use the leftovers and the chicken stock to make soup, but there were no leftovers!  So I'll freeze the chicken stock and use it next time. The aluminum foil balls worked great.

Like many of you, I cut up an onion and stuffed it in the cavity of the chicken.  An easy flavor enhancer.  I also mixed 1 TBSP olive oil, 1/2 tsp. paprika, 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp dried tarragon and brushed the chicken before cooking.  Yummy!

This was phenomenal - I made some small changes. Added two shallots into slow cooker and added garlic, thyme and a touch of cayenne.  Cooked on HIGH for 5 hrs and was amazing.

It was a really easy and good recipe. I used a chicken that was a bit bigger than they called for and didnt do the hour on high heat and it was still overcooked at the 10hr mark. Definitely will make it again though! :)

Great way of cooking, but did come out pretty boring.  Should add a gravy when serving.  Or use an injector.

Turned out really well, which surprised me.  We did throw it in the oven to crisp it up afterwards, but inside was super moist and juicy.

I love this recipe.  It's so easy to have a good meal waiting when you get home from work.  This makes baked chicken so easy and tasty.  I gave it 5 stars because of the ingredients which make it easy to choose a side dish.  This goes with anything!

Good, easy.  I also used onion and celery to prop it up instead of aluminum foil.  Shoved some lemon into the cavity, rubbed spices under the skin.  Voila! Dinner time.

I think I now know what I did wrong! The recipe says to cook 1hr high and 8 on low. So after taking a reviewers suggestion and browning the chicken first, I cooked it 1hr on high an 8 on low! It smelled wonderful and fell apart when taking it out. I also took another suggestion and put broth in the bottom. I couldnt find a 2-3lb chicken. The smallest my Safeway had was 5.2!!! So I figured I would def need to cook it the full time plus some maybe. Well the meat was awful! It had this weird sorta clayish texture. Finally as my poor husband is trying to force himself to eat it he tells me, I think it was cooked too long and what we are tasting is the bone and marrow that cooked into the meat! it was so disappointing! Now that I've re read some of the reviews it looks like a lot of people cooked for 7hrs total rather than 9. So maybe I will try again? We'll see! I can't imagine if I'd had a smaller bird like the recipe called for. The darn bones may have just disintegrated! Feel free to send me any tips!

This is an easy way to roast a whole chicken and I love the method.  I used potatoes in the bottom of the slow cooker rather than aluminum foil, as others suggested.  Super easy!

The chicken came out dry and the skin was gooey.  I used carrots, potatoes & onions in the bottom of the slow cooker instead of foil and added about 1/2 c. of chicken broth.  The vegetables were good - the chicken really wasn't, though.

This is interesting and if you use cut up potatos on the bottom it does sit nicely without burning. I added enough water to cover them. This is flavorless even though I followed the directions. As others suggested next time I might try to inject flavoring or put it under the skin.

this was a wonderful technique and yielded very tender chicken!  i flipped the chicken and baked breast down with about 2 cups of broth in the bottom of the slow cooker.  i season with a turkey rub in addition to paprika.  came home and the house smelled incredible!  thanks!

Very good, I followed the recipe as is, the chicken fell right off the bone.  However, my 3 pound chicken only needed to cook for 6 hours in my crockpot.  Glad I was home to catch it, or it would have been dry.  Other than that, excellent!

I tried this recipe because I don't like cleaning the oven after roasting a chicken. Although the crockpot is easy to clean, this recipe doesn't come close to baked chicken. The crockpot removed all taste & texture, resulting in something less appealing. It was easy - yes - but not worthwhile.

Easy and the bird looks beautifull. I rested it on veggies instead of aluminum foil.  Cooked for too long and just fell off its bones as we tried to remove it from the pot.

So yummy!!! my family loved this chicken!  It fell right off the bone!  I think next time I'll use potatoes in the bottom... save on foil and sounds yummy... I think I will also put the chicken in the oven on 450 for 15 minutes or so to brown the skin then I'll put it in the crockpot on low to cook the remainder of the time... that will seal the juices in.

I will be making this often!!! Yummy, easy, and quick to prepare!  To make a one dish meal, I wrapped potatoes in foil and placed in the bottom of the crock pot.  I also put about 3/4 can of chicken broth in the bottom.  For seasoning, I used poultry seasoning, pepper, paprika, and mixed seasoning salt.  I stuffed the chicken with stovetop stuffing in which I added sauteed celery and onion.  My whole family liked this meal.  Wonderful recipe =)

This was good but I think it could use some more seasonings.  I followed the suggestion of others and instead of the foil I wrapped up whole potatoes in foil and put them in the bottom of the slow cooker and then placed the chicken on top.  I seasoned the chicken w/salt and pepper and paprika and also garlic powder and onion powder.  I also placed 1/2 an onion and some minced garlic in the cavity.  I cooked it on high for an hour and then on low for probably 4 1/2 more hours.  My cooker is new so it cooks a little hot.  It was fall off the bone juicy but I think I will try to add some more spices under the skin next time.  I used the pan drippings to make a gravy and mashed the potatoes.  My chicken was almost 4 pounds and I think that even though it was juicy, if I had cooked it any longer it would have been too long.

I got a slower cooker for xmas so I offered to make dinner for New Years. I came across this recipe and thought it would be perfect. I made a couple of changes though. I added carrots, celery, zucchini and onion on the bottom (instead of the foil) and a can of chicken broth. Since I was making this for the holiday I added cornbread stuffing to the chicken. I cooked on low for 2 hours then high for 6 hours. It really was the best chicken we ever had. I will defiantly make this again.

I put potatoes in the bottom of the slow cooker instead of foil.  Chicken was very moist.  Next time I will season the chicken with something stronger.  But the chicken was extremely tasty.  I could not even lift the chicken out of the crock without it falling apart.  I wish I could cook a turkey this way.

Maybe I did something wrong, but mine turned out more like a soup. The chicken and veggies tasted good, but it wasn't what I wanted it to be.

No more need to buy those rotisserrie chickens from the grocery store! :) Super easy and came out great.  The only thing I added was a olive oil rub and then with the salt/pepper/paprika I used lemon pepper Mrs. Dash seasoning.  Moist, tasty and nice color.

I made lemon pepper chicken. I rubbed the chicken down with lemon pepper seasoning and stuffed the cavities with lemons. I put the chicken on top of aluminum foil balls, and cooked on high for 5-6 hours. It was AMAZING fall off the bone chicken. The meat soaks up whatever you season it with.

I'm only giving this 3 stars because it tasted ok.  10 hours is WAY too long for this chicken.  It fell apart too much and we were picking bones out of our food.  The foil balls did not work to get the chicken crispy on the outside so the skin was a slimy mess.  Next time, its going in the oven.

I did this recipe AS IS, foil and all, except I omit the 1 our on high, I believe this method is to make skin crisper and if you can add the step, I imagine it will be worthwhile.  I put it in frozen the night before because we do this for Sunday lunch after church and by 1pm it is ready.  This method, while palatable, is not as good as putting it in thawed.   It is fall off the bone for sure.  The only reason I did not give it 5, is because the meat itself does not absorb any "spice".  So the meat tastes like great tender chicken, but my husband is always a stickler for "spice".  Regardless, we use this method every Sunday and I will be experimenting and researching how to infuse the meat with this method.  The paprika is a great accompaniment, and my husband preferred it to putting just garlic and onion in the cooker for flavor.

this was really good, I cut up squares of butter and covered them in the salt/pepper/paprika mix and put the butter under the skin of the chicken.  i also followed other reviews and skipped the tin foil and used potatoes and onion.  I also put onion and garlic cloves inside the chicken while it cooked.  It turned out really moist and it was so easy.  Then i made homeade chicken gravy from this website with the left over chicken stock in the crock pot.  I definitely will be making this again :)

Was intrigued by one negative review...this recipe doesn't say to "cut up" the chicken...!  Hmmmm....Otherwise, this is a great way to cook a whole bird on a warm day when you don't want to heat up your kitchen....stays moist.

I made some minor adjustments to this recipe and it turned out great.  I rubbed the outside of the bird with a variety of seasonings; garlic powder, italian seasoning, onion powder, salt, pepper, and then injected the bird with a liquid marinade.  I browned the bird under the broiler before putting it in the slowcooker.  I did use the foil balls at the bottom of the slowcooker.  I also basted the bird every now and then since there were so many comments about the bird being dry.  The chicken turned out fabulous and was not dry at all.  Very easy meal and the entire famliy loved it.  Will definitely make again!

EXCELLENT!  This recipe is for fall off the bone, juicy chicken...do NOT use this recipe and expect a rotisserie style chicken. After reading other reviews, I omitted the foil and instead lined my crockpot with carrots, celery, and onion, and one can of chicken broth. I rubbed my bird with butter and sprinkled with some seasonings. The meat was so flavorful and literally fell apart when i touched it. Served with some mashed potatoes and gravy, the veggies, and some biscuits. A perfect meal for a cold winter day!

I used a 4 1/2 lb chicken, kept the slow cooker on high for about 2 hours and switched it to low for about 6 hours. the chicken just fell apart when i removed it from the slow cooker. It didn't win for presentaon but definitely gets 5 stars for how tender and juicy it was. I will use this method again and again. It was effortless.

I only gave 4 stars because of all the changes I had to make.  This chicken was very tender.  I did not use the foil.  I put carrots, onion, and potatoes on the bottom of the crock pot.  I filled the chicken cavity with fresh thyme.  I poured some chicken broth in the crock pot and then made gravy out of it.  I also used poultry seasoning along with the paprika. I served it with fresh dinner rolls and it was a nice, and very easy Sunday dinner.

Wow! This was a delicious and easy way to cook chicken! I had a 4 1/2 pound bird. Instead of using foil, I used half an onion, some carrots, and some celery at the bottom of the slow cooker. I also poured in about a 1/2 cup of chicken stock. I rubbed salt, pepper, and sage under the skin as far as my hands could reach. I then placed the chicken on top of the veggies and drizzled some olive oil on the skin. I then rubbed the rest of the seasonings over the oiled skin. I started the chicken later than I wanted to, so I turned it on high for 2 hours and then set it low for 5 more hours. The legs and wings completely fell off as I was getting the chicken out. Very good!!!! Will definitely cook whole chickens this way again and again!

I am so humbled that I never thought of the foil idea. I've tried doing whole chickens in the crock pot in the past, and they just fell apart with bones floating in the juice. What a great idea to elevate the chicken so that the juice is on the bottom! The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because I usually think of a crock pot meal as a whole meal, but this was just chicken.

For something so simple, this is really delicious! Followed a few tips found in the reviews. I skinned the chicken and marinated it overnight with a homemade marinade - salt, white and black pepper, garlic powder and chili powder. Lined the bottom after the pot with chopped carrots and potatoes, and stuffed the cavity with one small onion and 4 cloves of crushed garlic. After cooking on low for 8 hours, this was perfect!

Hubby and I have been cooking whole chicken in the crock pot for a long time. We used to spice it all up, adding lots of liquid and vegetables to get a soup as well as the chicken. I love carrots. Then I started to get coughs, colds, flus, allergies, stuff that never ends, and I couldn't eat anything with any flavoring at all for awhile. So he started making this even simpler: just chicken and water. Nothing else. Cook about 6 hours and chicken is done with lots of soothing chicken soup. The chicken is very tender, but of course, my favorite part is the chicken soup to make me feel better. Hubby now makes this with frozen chicken, from freezer (just make sure there's no gizzard bag), add water, turn on, leave for next 6+ hours. If I'm feeling good, I'll add lots of sprigs of fresh rosemary or maybe some ginger and the whole house smells great and no need to think about dinner for the next few days. In other words, you can't go wrong with a whole chicken in the crock pot.

This is sooo easy and sooo good. The only thing I did different was put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 450 to sear it a little instead of the 1 hour on high in the crock pot - I didn't have time to wait that long. But, it turned out really good and my kids loved it too. :o)

Wonderful and so easy! I put a few cut onions and fresh garlic in the cavity on the bird and rubbed salt, pepper, paprika and poultry seasoning on the outside. Before I put the chicken in the slow cooker, I put some potatoes on the bottom (instead of the foil balls), then put the chicken on top of the potatoes. The potatoes and chicken were delish! There is no need to put chicken broth or any liquid in the slow cooker. The chicken makes plenty of juice.

This was good, not great.  I took the suggestions of setting the chicken on onions instead of foil balls and seasoned it with paprika, garlic, salt, and pepper.  I'll use this recipe to cook a whole chicken that I want to use for casseroles and other dishes but not as a meal itself.

This was such a great concept for an easy dinner.  It was falling off the bone tender.  I used lemon pepper seasoning on top and under the skin. Two sprigs of rosemary and three cloves of garlic.  The flavor was great!  I can't wait to experiment with other flavors.

I have to say first off this chicken was absolutely delicious!  It just fell off the bone and was so tender.  I did add some extra spices to the rub, 1 and a half cups of broth, and veggies underneath instead of tin foil.  I wish the skin had browned a bit on the outside but I think it doesn't do that since the heat of the slow cooker is more moist than if I had done it in the oven.  The great thing about it was that there was so much left over (it's only me and my roommate) that I just had to take the bones out of the chicken and add some more broth and I had most of a chicken soup already made for the next day!  Will definitely make again.

What an easy recipe.  I put all kinds of seasonings all over the chicken the night before and let it sit in the refrigerator.  It tasted great.  The chicken fell right off the bone.  The skin does not get crunchy but we don't eat it.  Next time, I think I will put seasonings under the skin so the flavor goes right into the meat.  Great to use for leftovers.

What an easy, yet rewarding recipe! I added a few more spices, added water w/ a cube of chicken boulin, about a cup of lemon juice,a few cloves of garlic, and stuffed the bird with a lemon I pierced with a fork. I was initially worried because the chicken was a 5 pounder and I only had 6 hours to cook, but when I took it out, the drumstick fell right off, and the breast was so tender and juicy! Made the house smell amazing! Something so delicious should not be so easy, but it is!

Made changes as did lots of the reviewers.  Didn't use foil, just potatoes, onions and carrots.  Added a can of low-sodium chicken broth and stuffed some extra onion in the chicken.  Cooked on low for eight hours and it was perfect.  Made it like four times in a month.

I was so surprised how moist the chicken was. Here's what I did. I used a 5.5 lb chicken and rubbed rosemary, thyme, chevril & marjoram on outside along with sea salt on outside and inside of cavity, pepper and some texas spice rub. On the bottom of the crockpot I put a bag of baby carrots, whole onion, large garlic clove pressed, few potatoes halved, little worcestershire & few drops lemon juice. I put it on high for an hour and then on low for about 8.5 or 9 hrs. Toward the end I added some chicken base to the juices. The chicken remained intact and was great. As leftovers, I made gravy from leftover juices with water & flour. Had to make more gravy to add. I cut up the baby carrots, onions and potatoes and chicken. Added all this to store bought pie crusts. Baked at 425 for 20 min then 350 for 25 min. It was awesome! Best pot pie I've ever tasted! Served with cabbage salad. YUM!!

I just used my chicken/poultry seasoning, put onion inside and cooked upside down to try and keep breasts more moist.  This is the only way I will cook my chickens from now on.  Everyone agreed that it was better than oven or grilled whole chickens.

Because I am so cheap.....I used three crushed beer cans instead of foil balls.
Worked perfect. I make this often using any combination of spices. Always falls off the bone and is tender and juicy. Also a Great way to make Chicken Noodle Soup.

I was very disappointed by this recipe.  After reading some of the other reviews, I went ahead and slathered on the spices, inside and out, after making cuts in the skin so that it would soak into the meat.  I also stuffed an onion and some peppers into the cavity.  It was still VERY bland!  I have no idea how that happened, but it did!  

The meat was very tender and juicy, though.  I think people who are ending up with dry chickens are placing them breast side up, which will dry out the breast meat.

AMAZING!!!  I used quartered potatoes instead of foil, added a diced onion then my chicken on top...TO DIE FOR!!!  I did find the skin wasn't 'coloured' enough for my liking, so i put it on a foil-lined pan @ 475 for 15 mins just to crisp up the skin.  Veggies were AWESOME.  There was LOTS of wonderful juices to make a gravy with.  The chicken was BEYOND tender--its texture was like velvet~! We will make this again, and again, and again....

Delicious! I used 1/2 cup chicken broth, potatoes, carrots and celery under the chicken instead of foil, and thyme instead of paprika. After 8 hours on low, it fell apart as soon as I touched it! Delicious, but just a bit messy. It's worth it, though. This may be the best way to cook a whole chicken EVER!

I made this last night. It was my first time using a slow-cooker ever! It came out really good. It was so tender and moist that I couldn't lift it out of the pot..it just fell apart. My husband loved it. I didn't put the foil balls on the bottom..I quartered an onion instead and placed them at the bottom with the chicken on top of them. I used the paprika and added onion powered and garlic powder. It was great! Oh and it only took 4 hours on high for a 3 1/2 pound chicken.

I couldn't believe such a simple recipe can chicken that is so tasty and moist! Just like other reviewers, I rubbed whatever ingrediants and spices I have - dry roasted garlic, olive oil, dry basil flaks, salt and papper. I added more salt and roasted garlic to make sure the white meat has some flavor. I left it overnight in the fridge for the flavor to absorb, put the chicken in to the slow cooker in the morning for low 8 hours, and dinner was ready when I came home from work! The chicken was amazingly flavorful and moist. My chicken was just right without falling apart. I will definitely make it again with other ingrediants such as lemon juice and soy sauce.  Hubby loved it! Thank you!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I tweaked it a bit by putting 4 halves of onions under the chicken with the breast side down. I dont use alot of fat for cooking so to give the chicken flavor, I pulled apart the skin and put as much light lemon flavored yogurt as I could. I also put some sage, garlic and lemon in the cavity. Under the chicken I put uncooked wild rice with a 1/4 cup water. Cooked it on low for 7 hours. The rice had all the flavors of the chicken. Delicious.

This was easy and delicious! I was able to fit 2 chickens in my slow cooker. I stuffed both with onions and garlic and then I rubbed the skins with garlic powder, onion powder, and S & P. I like the tin foil method as it kept the chickens from cooking in the greasy juice. I cooked mine on Auto for 6 hours and the chicken fell off the bones! It came apart while I tried to get them out. It was very moist and ohhh so good! Thanks.

Using the aluminum foil to keep the chicken out of its own juices was brilliant. My only complaint is that there doesn't seem to be any 3 lb chickens on the market.  The smallest I found was 4 1/2 lbs., which did not fit in the crock pot with the foil! So, I had to cut-up the whole chicken to fit it in.

I was a skeptic... but this recipe is awesome.  Cooked my pre-seasoned bird upside-down with lots of additional spices for 8hrs on low. Added about a cup and a half of chicken stock because I was worried, but I don't think it needed it. Threw some red potatoes and onion in the pot, but still used the foil ball. I will definitely be doing this again!

I am giving this 5 stars because I blame myself for the way this turned out for me. I wish now that I had just done it like the recipe says. I did follow the cooking time like it said, but I listened to other people and instead of doing the foil balls under my chicken, I put potatoes, carrots and onions. I soaked my chicken in a brine overnight of chicken broth, Mrs. Dash, garlic, lemon pepper seasoning and then sat it on top of the veggies and put in about 3/4 cup of broth to cook. Well, it was fall off the bone tender for sure....even the bones were falling apart! This made it difficult to serve the veggies because I was afraid they may have some littel pieces of bone in them that fell off the chicken. So I ended up taking the chicken out, spooning up all the veggies in a slotted spoon, then I had to pour all that chicken juice into a strainer to make sure all the bones were out (and there were several in there that my kids would have not thought to look for)then I had to put my chicken back in to keep warm. The flavor was pretty good, but I was disappointed, because I really dumped the spices on this thing and to me it was still a bit on the bland side. The dark meat was moist and good but the white meat was dry after it cooled the slightest little bit. I think next time I would try this with boneless skinless chicken and maybe use a cream of something soup...maybe that would be better. Oh , I almost forgot to mention that I did remove the skin before I marinated it all ni

I loved this recipe! I took advice from others and browned the chicken first in oil.  I used two small whole chickens.  Before browning I lifted the skin with a wooden spoon and rubbed in a mixture of poultry seasoning, parsley, paprika, salt and pepper.  I put quartered onions and lemons in the cavities. I layered thickly sliced potatoes in the crock pot before adding the chicken.  I added sliced carrots as well, and 1 cup of chicken stock made from bouillon cubes.  My picky 15 year-old son thought it was the best chicken he's ever tasted.  I served it with seasoned rice and a salad.  Perfect meal!

I cut up carrots, onions and potato and put on the bottom of the slow cooker.  I then put in a shallot in the cavity of the chicken.  I separated the skin from the breast meat and rubbed in garlic and a bit of seasoning salt.  I seasoned the outside with paprika, pepper, more seasoning salt and placed on top of the veggies and away it cooked (about 8 hours)...everything turned out great!  I made mashed potato (boiled up more potato)by adding the slow cooker potato's to the boiled potato's--had wonderful flavour!  Definitely easy and will make again!

Hmm...I am very particular with chicken. If it is not cooked all the way through I will not touch it...usually my chicken is dry.

With that said this was the BEST baked chicken I have ever made.

I used small red potatoes on the bottum of the cooker instead of foil.

3/4 cup of water.

The spices I used were Olive Oil, Garlic Powder, Poultry Seasoning, and Red Pepper Flakes. LOTS!!! DO not be shy.

I did the 1 hour on high and then 7 hours on low and 1 hour on warm.

Made gravy with drippings.

Try it, you might like it!!

Ok.. I followed this recipe mostly to a T to give it a shot... I gave this 4 stars for the easy preparations b/c frankly I NEVER thought to cook a whole chicken in a crock pot before but this chicken had no taste to it at all... Everyone drowned the meat in salt at suppertime, and I even added extra of each spice fearing that the amount stated wouldn't be enough. I will definatly make this again but next time, like others suggested, I'll add more/different spices and I'll stick some onions/garlic/celery in the cavity. And the drippings on the bottem were very good so I think that potatoes and carrots would taste great cooked in that juice so next time I'm adding them too. This is a recipe that you will definatly have to make to your own  taste but it's definatly easy enough to give it a try!

5 Stars for method, however I made changes like other reviewers. I used the turkey brine overnight with my chicken. This gave it a fantastic flavor. Then, because I am somewhat lazy, I used an oven bag to line my crockpot. I used potatoes on the bottom like others, and wedged potatoes on the sides as well so the chicken would not touch the pot at all. I poured some of the brine solution into the pot and cooked on low for 4 hours and high for 2 (ran out of time!). It of course fell apart which was what I expected. However using the oven bag made cleanup a snap. Will use this recipe over and over again. Thanks so much for this recipe!!!

I removed the skin and mixed softened margarine with paprika and cajun seasoning to use as a rub all over my chicken. This gave it a more even color, like a rotisserie chicken. I stuffed the cavity with onion, celery, and bell pepper and cooked it on top of the foil balls. My slow cooker must cook fast, because I cooked it 3 hours on high and 2 hours on low and it was fine. I added no extra liquid. The chicken was tender and delicious -- we had to add more salt at the table, but there were no complaints. I'm interested in trying a flavor injector also, and stuffing the chicken with lemons next time, too. YUM!

This was a great and easy recipe. Instead of using the foil at the bottom I used red skined potatoes and added carrots and onions.....very good. Will definitely try again with different seasonings.

Easiest whole chicken recipe that I've ever made! Like others mentioned, I used whole carrots instead of aluminum foil balls under the chicken. I also added a splash or so of white wine in the bottom of my crock and I sprinkled the chicken with chili powder & Italian seasonings as well as the paprika. Easy & delicious. Thanks!

So moist!  I added a whole apple inside the chicken, forgot about the salt and added thinly sliced fresh garlic under the skin.  This was a deliciously basic recipe for playing around with in my own kitchen.

This recipe is great.  It not only is easy, put on before work and when you get home supper is almost done, but it is also healthy. I add seasoned salt, garlic pepper and a little red pepper to spice things up.  Thanks for sharing.

This came out pretty good, but I'm going to still experiment with the seasonings.  I made this primarily to use the chicken in the chicken salad that my husband loves.  Normally I buy a rotisserie chicken but I thought this would be an interesting experiment.

I bought 2 whole fryers (My crock pot is very big).  I used the aluminum foil balls, no extra liquid.  I rinsed the birds inside and out, and threw half an onion inside each.  I rubbed the outside with olive oil and used seasoned salt based on someone else's review.  I decided at the last minute before throwing them in to add some dried basil and oregano (only dried herbs I had on hand.)  Combining some of the reviewer tips, I cooked on low only, breast side down for three hours and then breast side up for an additional 3-4 hours.  

It was very moist and flavorful, but I'd like to change the seasonings around to make it more like my favorite rotisserie chicken.

my chicken was over 5 pounds (twice the size of the one called for) and my chicken collapsed, it was so overcooked following this recipe.  the white meat was dry and all the whole thing fell apart as i tried to get it out of the pot.  i won't make this again.

Although the chicken ended up being tender and all, the foil gave it a faint metallic taste that I disliked. The others who ate with me didn't notice - so if you don't have a sensitive palate, then it's a good recipe, if a little bland. Otherwise... be leery of the foil.

It can't get easier than this.  My husband, a major chicken-lover, loved this.  There was plenty of juice to make gravy too.

Weight Watchers also suggests the tin foil to cut the fat. I have also cooked whole chickens on low for 10 hours while at work. I'm aiming for the fall apart so I have shredded chicken for tacos, salads, etc. Always juicy and delicious. I use a 3 lb chicken and a 4 qt crock pot.

This review is pretty much for the cooking tip...Love the aluminum foil idea! I coated 4 split breasts with olive oil and then sprinkled my fav cajun seasoning on both sides.  Cooked on high 1 hour then low for about 9 hours. Nice & moist! And I got an intense tasty broth at the bottom of the crockpot. I didn't like how the skin turned out, but otherwise, the meat was beautiful.

Thank-you so much for sharing this recipe and tip.  I've been making whole chicken in the crock pot for years, but it always falls apart and makes a mess. But with your tip about the foil, the chicken held together great for carving.  I only needed to cook it for 7 hours after the 1 hour on high.  I used a 6 lb roaster with a pop up timer. And I rubbed lemon pepper under the skin on the breast and sprinkled liberally all over. Thanks for sharing.

This was the juiciest, tenderest whole chicken I've ever served. I stuffed the cavity with onions, mushrooms and an apple (all chopped) along with some additional spices. Absolutely fabulous!

This was a great recipe for my husband's low carb diet.  And it was so easy to prepare.  I added a butter paste of butter, poultry seasoning, garlic powder and lemon pepper seasoning.  I rubbed it under the skin on the breasts and on the outside of the rest of the bird.  I put some french onion soup under the chicken w/ the foil balls.  Everyone at my husband's restaurant wanted to try some, because the aroma was so wonderful.  And the teenagers who work at the restaurant with my husband actually called me and went on and on about how good this chicken was.  I'm glad I ended up cooking a 5 lb. bird!!   :)  THANKS SO MUCH for a keeper!!!

Turned out very moist and tender.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours in the slowcooker.  I placed the chicken on one of those foil stovetop element  things and it held the chicken up nicely away from the liquid.  The hole in the center of the foil was a bonus for drainage. Will definately make it again.  Mmm...

I used half of a Perdue oven stuffer roaster.  It was very good and smelled great cooking.  The breast meat was noticeably drier than the darker meat, but still tasty.  Cajun seasoning, paprika, salt, pepper, and garlic powder added liberally and rubbed into the chicken made it taste like a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket. Will make again for sure.  So easy.

I loved the baked chicken crock recipe. I cooked it on high for 4 hours then it was on warm for 4 hours. The meat fell off the bone and it was very moist. My husband did miss the crispy skin, but I dont eat it anyway since it is not healty. It is a good way to get him and the kids to not eat the skin.

This chicken is fabulous! I was very generous with my seasonings. I added more paprika then the recipe called for and I added seasoned salt, parsley, and LOTS of minced garlic. My chicken was partially frozen when I put it in the crock pot so I cooked it on high for about three hours and then turned it to low. Turned out great!!! It was not too dry and the meat fell of the bone. Next time I'll try bone-in breasts.  Huge hit with my family, thanks!

I made this for my first company dinner in my new house. I made two chickens for 5 guests and there wasnt' very much left. The meat was the most tender I have ever had and the leftovers made the most wonderful chicken salad. I used more spices of coarse. I used a lot of garlic, tony's, salt, pepper, paprika, lemon juice, basted it with melted butter, and chopped some green onions to put on top and it came out perfect. Use heavy spices but be careful not to use to much hot spices or the bird will come out spicy which is not what I like. 
My husband and I like to have fresh lunches for work so I cook mine while we are sleeping so when we wake up we have a chicken dinner for lunch and the chicken is still great for dinner.

This recipe was on of the easiest I have ever tried.  I think any seasoning would work well, just what ever you are in the mood for.  Next time I am going to try using leg quarters or just thighs, the dark pieces seemed to be a little moister than the white meat. I spooned a little of the juice from the bottom of the slow cooker over the pieces to add a little extra flavor.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I really liked this chicken, although I overcooked it by about an hour. I would re-emphasize how important it is to put the breast pieces upside down at the bottom to prevent dryness. The wings, legs and thigh pieces fell apart as I lifted them from the crock pot, they were so moist! Make sure that you are not shy with the spices, really lay it on thick, because crock pot cooking will mute ground spices as it cooks. This was a winner with the whole family, and couldn't be easier to make! I will make this again and again! Thanks!

I can't believe this was cooked in a crock pot! No 'rubbery' chicken skin and the meat fell off the bones.  
One thing I would suggest for those of you who had trouble with the breast meat being dry.  Try layering the chicken in the pot - breast on the bottom, then thighs, then drumsticks and finally the wings on the top.
My family LOVED this recipe, and it will definitely be used again.

I have used a variation of this recipe 
before, a whole chicken with barbecue 
sauce dumped on it and it always turned 
out good.  This time I tried chicken 
breasts and I cooked for the time recommended but that didn't work.  They turned out dry, the edges were hard.  So my caveat is don't cook it too long!

I've never used a whole chicken before, I found it intimidating! However, this recipe sounded so simple I gave it a try. I cut up potatoes and carrots and set the chicken on those instead of foil balls. I also stuffed the chicken with onions and fresh minced garlic. I generously rubbed paprika, lemon pepper and garlic powder all over the chicken with my hands. Even put some down inside. No measuring, just went with it. Then I seared the chicken in olive oil for about 2 minutes on top and bottom. I put it in the crockpot, sliced up more onions and carrots, put them all in there on top and cooked it on low  for 9-10 hours. I have a very old Rival crockpot.  This was fabulous. My 12, 9 & 6 year olds, hubby & I all enjoyed it. What an easy thing to do before leaving in the morning. You can easily change up spices for different flavors. This one is a keeper. Plus, my chicken was only $4, what an inexpensive meal!

I have made this just as the recipe stated, except wrapped potatoes  in the foil and put in bottom. NOTHING else was needed. Chicken fell off the bone, had excellent flavor and the potatoes didn't need butter or anything. Try it AS WRITTEN and you will be surprised. FIVE STAR (couldn't get it to take 5)

This recipe is great for individual like myself, who are new to the kitchen.  I followed the suggestions and added 2C of water, 3/4C chicken broth, and 1/3C lemon juice.  It was great! I also used red potatoes, broccoli, and carrots to cover the bottom.  I will def be using this again! -Chris

Only thing I added was about 1/4 cup of chicken broth drizzled over for steaming and sliced several area with a knife shoved into each hole fresh rosemary and garlic. Also added a little paprika.

I did all the extras, potato on bottom celery, carrot, onion inside. Cooked one hour on high 5 hour on low 6lb bird. It looked gross no browning action so I carefully picked it up put it in cast iron skillet and broiled it till browned.  But it was good.like a rotisserie chicken but fresh

Excellent recipe for a "roasted" chicken!  I combined recipes using the seasoning from the Whole chicken slow cooker recipe and these driections for cooking, using the foil.  Very good and not greasy at all!  Not even too spicy or salty using the seasonings from the above mentioned recipe.

The chicken browned, better than baked!  As a working woman, who loves roasted chicken, I believe this recipe is better than gold :) I had 5 thighs. I seasoned them as I normally do, balled up 5 pieces of foil, set them  a top the foil, turned it on at 7:30  am & arrived home at 6:45 pm to find beautifully browned chicken.

I made it and it was wonderful!!! I'm going to make it again for sure. I just switched up the seasoning. But this is brilliant I would of never guessed. I took a picture of it and I'm so upset I deleted. I will post it another time when I cook it.

Very easy!  Used some of the variations I read about....like using halved onions on the bottom instead of the foil.  I also put two slaps of thick bacon in slow cooker, and heavily seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and some Italian seasoning.  Turned out great!

I made this a few nights ago in the crock pot. Instead of aluminum foil I went the traditional route and added potatoes, carrots, and chicken broth. I kept it on low for approx. 11hrs. It was tasty, but there was just something missing. I think it needed more flavor. I did like it for the simple fact that it did not take much effort to make.

This was so easy to make and I was able to use it to make 3 different meals. I did not use foil either, but added carrots, onion and red wine, as well as spices. The chicken was falling off the bone and made the house smell so good all day long! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is definitely one for keeping! I used cornish hens and the change I made was add carrots and pearl onions to the bottom with the foil, and seasoned with Old Bay and a cut up orange in the middle. Great base recipe for any variation! Thanks!

I rubbed olive oil on the chicken and I stuffed it with lemon, celery and onion and I seasoned it real well. It turned out so moist and flavorful. Thanks for a great recipe.

One word: easy!  Great basic recipe.  You can spice it up by rubbing olive oil and herbs or seasonings on the skin.  Try using a flavor injector to even juicier chicken.

I am not sure what I did to make it cook so fast, but it was done cooking in less than 7 hours rather than the 10 stated.  The chicken itself was delicious and will definitely keep this recipe for large family gatherings to share the greatness with others!

Followed the directions exactly--the chicken was actually a little bigger than called for.  Cooked TO DEATH.  It didn't just fall apart, it was mush. Yuck.

Mine turned out slightly over done and veggies way over done.  After doing some research, it apears newer slow cookers cook hotter than older ones.  Cook time was definately too long for a newer crock pot.  Will try again without starting it off on High and see how it turns out.

This turned out awesome!  I did inject the chicken with some garlic powder, butter and seasoning salt.  Took about 7 hours on low and it was the juiciest, most moist, delicious chicken we have ever had!!  AWESOME!!  Thanks for the slow cooker recipe!

This came out pretty good. I cooked it as written with the foil except that I only cooked it for 8 hours on low.  It was a little dry so I might cut that time down a bit for my slow cooker.

Lot of juice and fat build up if the slow cooker is smaller.  Leaves the chicken resting in this while it's cooking so the skin is quite slimy.  But tastes fantastic and is low fuss.

After reading a lot of reviews, I decided to put the chicken on foil balls, upside down, after using Lawry's Seasoned Salt and some garlic powder.  I wasn't going to be around to change my heat setting from high to low, so I just set it for low only for 8 hours.  My husband was home before me at around the 6-hour mark and he tested with a meat thermometer and it was registering at 180.  He shut off the slow cooker at that point.  The chicken was very tasty if not slightly overdone.  The white meat was just slightly drier than it should have been.  The dark meat was spot on.  I left the skin on and it was actually edible if you like that sort of thing.  It was very tender and I would definitely cook a whole chicken this way again.  I think either the combo of high then low or just low, but definitely a shorter cooking period.  I added nothing to the cooker but the foil and the seasoned chicken.  I cooked everything else on the side.  The variety of seasonings to use with this technique is endless.  Give it a try!

This is a great way to make fall off the bone chicken. I added veggies (onion,carrots,green beans) and served over rice with gravy from the drippings. It was almost like a stew by the time it came out.

I followed the recipe. The chicken did literally fall apart and my house smelled awesome when I got home, but the chicken tasted so very dry. Even with adding an onion and head of garlic for flavor. Husband was not impressed. Won't be doing this again.

Sorry, I wanted to like this so badly. It smelled AMAZING while cooking. I should say that I did not use the foil in the bottom of the slow cooker. Instead I used onions and potatoes, but Im not sure that would have ruined the chicken. In any matter, it was tasteless. Maybe I should have marinated the chicken overnight? Who knows, but I was majorly dissapointed

I am so glad that Allrecipes has this posted. I have been making a variation of this for years, using a rub that I found on the New Brunswick Chicken Producers' website. The chicken comes out like a roasted bird, with lots of lovely gravy. I hesitated to share this 'cause I worried about the possibility of salmonella or some such thing, though that's never been a problem here.
For a working Mom, this recipe and its variations are a welcome boon. It's great to come home after work and have dinner ready!

Tender but flavorless, even though I seasoned the inside of the skin liberally as well as the outside a few times while the chicken was cooking. I'm going to stick to roasting my chicken in the oven, the results are tastier and juicier.

This was so easy!  It was very moist and tender.  I would have given it a 5 star rating, but it was a little on the bland for me.  I used it to make chicken dishes with so it was fine for that, but if I were to eat it plain I'd inject it & stuff the inside w/ ingredients.  I'll definitely make it again!

I tried this recipe as is (except i didn't leave it in as long as I knew it was ready) and it was pretty good.  My husband loved it.  It's about as good as you can get to making a chicken without a rotisserie.

It was good, not great.  I cooked it on high for about 4.5 hours and it was still really juicy but it lacked in flavor.  I did quarter an onion and put in in the cavity but that was the only thing that I added to the recipe.  It is a good place to start the recipe but more spices are needed to make this a 5 star recipe.

The cooking time on this is WAY WAY WAY too long.   I had a 3 pound chicken and it was done after a total of 8 hours.  It was only 2:30 in the afternoon so I turned down the cooker to warm but after having to sit another 2 1/2 hours like that until dinner time, it was dry as a desert.  The only part that was edible was the dark meat, which was mildly dry too but OK.  It tasted good and I will remake this with a 2 hour and 20 minute shorter cook time than what this recipe indicates.

Im gonna give this a four for flavor but a five for ease.
I cut two onions in half as well cut up potatoes and carrots real chunky and placed them at the bottom of the cooker instead of using aluminum.

I give this a four because woah was it flavorless. I generously seasoned the chicken but it needed way more seasoning than just salt and peper to taste. In the future I will certainly try to marinate it for some time and then throw it in the cooker. 

Other than that wow. The chicken was soooooo tender. Im not a white meat person but the breast meat is so tender. I cooked the chicken breast down and im sure that made a difference.

I love the idea of this meal, very easy but even though I added extra spices it wasn't enough: thyme, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, paprika . I shouldve have let it sit over night. I have a new slow cooker so I have to be careful how long I cook my meals so instead of 8 hours it was done in 5 hours. I didn't use foil but vegetables instead. One thing I didn't enjoy was how the skin was so soggy. Next time I would put it in the oven before serving. Overall this dish was okay.

How did I raise children and not have this recipe before???  Thanks SO much for sharing because this was amazing.  My crock pot is hot so it only took an hour on HIGH and then 6 hours on LOW.  It was falling off the bone moist and delicious!

i put some veggies on the bottom of the cooker instead of the foil balls. I cooked it on high 1hr and low for 10 hrs. It was a bit over done. The bird litterally fell apart and had to be scooped out. oh well it was still really good. I used a 4.85lb chicken so next time i'll watch it more closely. Its a new cooker and i think it might be hotter then most. The recipes is great for people (like my bf) who only eat the breast meat of a whole chicken and maybe a leg and think they're no more edible parts. With this recipe the chicken comes out perfect and i can use all the meat. no wasteing no rubber texture. Next time i'll probably skin the chicken first becasue it just slid off anyway. definately a keeper.

I was surprised at how well this turned out. I slept past my alarm so it cooked an extra 4 hours on accident. The breasts were lightly dry but not too bad. I just put it on top of the foil balls because i uses the chicken to make guarrachas for my husband and chicken salad for myself. Then i used the meat in enchiladas. I seasoned it very well with a spice and butter rub under and over the skin. Mine was nice and golden colored.

This was my first attempt at making a whole chicken!  It turned out almost perfect, but it's really my fault that the chicken didn't turn out as well as it probably could have.  I had a 5 lbs chicken in a tiny slow-cooker so it was pretty much just wedged in there.  In addition to Paprika, I put Montreal Chicken Spice on it, as well as a tablespoon of butter.  I also only cooked it for 8 hours (including the first hour on high).  It turned out pretty well, I thought, but the top most part of the chicken was not in the juices/broth, so it was pretty dry.  Otherwise, I loved how it stayed tender and the flavour was pretty good. I'll make it again, but not with such a big bird and maybe try throwing in some veggies!  I think I'm more excited about the broth! :)

I placed coarse chopped vegetables under the chicken and added 1/2 cup of chichen broth to the bottom. Also added herbs under the skin. Chicken fell off the bone! Had enough broth when done to make gravy and also make a small but delicious batch of chicken noodle soup.

After working all day and picking my daughter up from the sitter, it's rare that I have the time/energy to make a wholesome supper for myself.  This recipe is a lifesaver.  Cooked on low for about 10 hours using potatoes instead of aluminum foil.  The chicken was falling off the bone juicy.  Leftovers will be great for numerous recipes calling for cooked chicken.  Next time I'll add a bunch of spices to give the chicken some more flavor.

The taste was good but it all fell off the bone and was a big ball of mush.  It wasn't good for leftovers because that big ball of mush was more difficult to deal with after cooling.  I don't think I'd make this again, especially if I were serving it to guests.

Delicious! No complaints, just a suggestion...I always have a hard time deciding how much salt to use when the measurement isn't listed for a recipe. For this chicken dish make sure to be generous with the salt!

YUMMY YUMMY!!!  This was great cus you can start before work and it's done when you get home.  I used the following spices...onion powder, thyme, cayenne, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  It was very tasty...i did do the foil and no need for any liquid at it creates its own!!  Will for sure do again!!

This was good, but not as tasty or flavorful as I'd like.  It also took a bit longer thatn suggested and our dinner was a couple hours late.  Next time I'll add a lot more spices.

This recipe is very good if you follow the directions.  I removed the skin like many reviewers said.  I cooked it too long (5lb chicken for 12hr) because the hubby kept me worried about whether it was cooked enough.  The flavor was good but it was overcooked.  I would leave the skin on next time and put the spices underneath the skin (like a turkey).  So great recipe and concept for cooking the chicken, but needed some simple changes.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  It produced wonderful dark meat but after 10 hours the white meat was a little overdone.  Definitely a keeper, I just need to turn it off a little sooner.

This was easy, and that is the best thing about this recipe. I like others added potatoes, onions, carrots, and celery and I still felt like it was pretty blah. The chicken was extremely tender and was falling off the bones. If I made this again I would not just eat the chicken I would have to use the baked chicken in a different recipe that called for fully cooked chicken - just not enough flavor to eat as is.

This didn't turn out well for me.  The chicken was really greasy and fell apart in a bad way.  I was really disappointed.  I did use potatoes instead of foil, but I doubt that is what made this not work for me.  I really wanted it to work out and am curious why some people have success and others, like me, do not.  :(

FANTASTIC!!! My first attempt at "roasting" a whole chicken in a slow cooker,  My No. 20 chicken (I'm in Australia, it's a 2kg bird - dont know lbs) came out extremely moist. I also added some chunky root vegetables into the bottom; carrots, potato & onions.

Yummy! My husband thought it could've used a little more flavor, but I liked it.  It was delicious with mashed potatoes and the chicken just fell off the bone.  The aluminum foil helped the chicken not stick to the bottom of the crock pot.

I only gave this four stars because I made some changes: instead of tin foil I placed the chicken on top of quartered onions and carrot and celery pieces. I dumped in about a cup of chicken broth. On the chicken I liberally used sea salt and freshly ground pepper, added some thyme as well.  When it was done cooking and the chicken had been removed I then strained the remaining contents and made a wonderful gravy with the veggie and chicken flavored broth.  Was SOOO yummy on mashed potatoes!

This was pretty good, but my family just hates having to deal with a whole bird.  I did not do the foil balls, I used a package of frozen stew veggies instead, and also stuffed some in the bird as well. I also added poultry seasoning, minced garlic, and onion powder.  I cooked it on high for about 30 minutes, then turned to low for 7 and half hours.  Then I transferred it to a baking dish and baked in the oven on 375 for about 30 minutes so that the skin could get brown and crispy. I made gravy from the drippings, which I had to add lots of seasonings to because it was just plain tasting.  Next time, I'll need to add more seasonings, and perhaps I'll brown it before putting it the slow cooker.

Good flavor - I did like others and put potatoes, carrots and celery on the bottom in lieu of foil balls.  The white meat did get a bit dry, but rubbing spices under the skin was solid advice.

This was very good but I found it to be a little too greasy for my taste. Maybe i just had a fatty chicken but i cut off a lot of fat before putting it in the crock pot. I skipped the tin foil on the bottom (forgot), but used a layer of cut potatoes, carrots and onions under the chicken - they just cooked in the chicken fat and came out a little soggy. Next time i might try taking the whole skin off first and hope it doesn't dry out too much. I used a garlic seasoning and the taste was fantastic, but again, just too greasy.

I have no idea why anyone would think this recipe is good. I'm baffled by the good reviews... I couldn't eat it. The breast meat was dry and the dark meat had this terrible mealy texture. I only cooked it for 5 hours and it was fall-off-the-bone done, but that is the only aspect of this recipe that delivered as promised. Overall, a huge disappointment. I would skip this one if I were you.

This was the first time I actually had a whole chicken turn out where my whole family would eat it! I gave this five stars because it is really a great basis for a recipe. I did however read the other reviews and used some of their advice in changing the recipe a bit. I used a 5lb chicken. I cleaned it inside and out, dried it with a paper towel, then seasoned it. I used Paparika, Johnny's poultry seasoning, onion powder, minced garlic, salt and pepper. I rubbed down the whole chicken with olive oil (outside and under the skin). I then seasoned the whole chicken on the outside, inside the cavity and under the skin. Instead of using the foil balls, I used potatoes and onion. I also used a 1/2 of cup of chicken broth. I cooked it on low for 11 hours. It was literally falling off the bone. My husband is a really picky eater when it comes to chicken and he thought it was really good. I am definitely going to use this again. I will however add more seasoning under the skin next time to make the meat more flavorful. Thanks for the recipe and to those who gave the helpful suggestions.

This chicken falls right off the bone! I used butternut squash and onions on the bottom instead of tin foil and it turned out well! I recommend seasoning heavily.

This has to be one of the best slow cooker recipes that I have found to date.  The chicken fell off the bone.  I actually had trouble getting it out of the pot because the meat kept falling off.  I have a rather large slow cooker, so I used 4 balls of tin foil.  I also took some of the other reviewers advice (thank you!) and added 2 full cans of chicken broth.  I put several spices on the chicken to taste.  I didn't cook on high at all...I put it on low for about 7 hours.  Excellent!  Thank you!

FABULOUSLY easy and delicious!!  I added potatoes to the bottom instead of foil.  Stuffed the chicken with stove-top, rubbed it with poultry seasoning and garlic salt, and threw a few carrots on top.  It fell off the bone, had to go picking through the veggies to get all the meat :)  Everyone loved it!

This was awesome. Cooked it exactly like it said to and it was the most tender chicken I have ever eaten. Delish! I added some other seasonings of course (garlic salt, pepper, etc) but that was just or our taste. Thanks for the awesome recipe! Who would of thought!

This is an incredibly simple, yet very tasty recipe. Even though it was in the crockpot all day long, it somehow still had a golden brown color! The juices made excellent gravy, and the meat was so tender that the whole chicken broke apart into five pieces when I tried to take it out of the slow cooker. Thanks for sharing this recipe...it is a winner!

After reading the other reviews I get that there is a need to add some moisture to this recipe and got a good idea from those who didn't like it that they still need a little culinary training. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added some extra seasoning and for moisture added 3/4 cup of Vernor's Ginger Ale. It came out remarkably moist and very good flavor. Used the aluminum foil, which was a good idea to keep the chicken from sticking to the bottom of the slow cooker. Excellent recipe-gives the cook an opportunity for testing different taste combinations. Isn't that what its all about?

Of course I didn't follow the recipe exactly, well, really, besides the chicken! I stuffed the bird with oranges (which I usually do for my Thanksgiving turkey). The juice from the oranges makes the meat very tender and flavorful. I chopped garlic and onions and places them in the bottom of the slow cooker. Melted Butter over the top of the bird then seasoned with pepper, garlic salt, basil, etc. And roasted it for about 8 hours on low. AWESOME!

I cooked a 3.5lb chicken for about five hours on low, and it did indeed leave a fall-off-the-bone tender chicken. I took it out of the crockpot and broiled it briefly to crisp the skin and it looked beautiful. But there was absolutely ZERO flavor! I used seasoning salt, pepper and paprika under the skin, in the cavity and on the skin. I also used lemon juice in the cavity, and lemon juice and chicken broth in the basin with the foil balls. Still no flavor.   I ended up serving the chicken with a LOT of BBQ sauce to add flavor. The dark meat had more flavor than the white, and I'll be using the white meat for chicken salad so it's not wasted.  I'll use this cooking method again, but I'll be adding veggies and rosemary or whole fruits to the cavity and upping the broth in the bottom.

this is a wonderful chicken recipe! the meat really did just fall off the bone. it was so tender and moist. i made a few changes though. after i cleaned out the chicken i stuffed a halved lemon, 4 garlic cloves, and some onion inside the bird. and i rubbed a mixture of butter salt pepper and paprica under the chicken skin. instead of the foil i used vegtables. potatoes, onion and carrots. i added chicken stock and white wine to the slow cooker too. then seasoned the chicken with salt pepper and paprica and thyme. it was amazing how good this was. some of the other reveiws said the chicken was dry, but i didn't have that problem, amybe it was the extra broth and white wine. but this chicken is awesome, you should definatly try it!!

This was amazing - tender, juicy and flavorful! The only change I made was to stuff the cavity with a large, chopped sweet onion and two crushed cloves of garlic. Also put a bit of garlic powder on with the paprika, salt and pepper - we really like garlic. Melt in your mouth and the house smelled marvelous when I came in from work. Thanks for the recipe.

I found the chicken to be a bit dry. I don't know if i would try this recipe again using some chicken broth, i'd be afriad of it evaporating too quickly, or over-saturating the chicken. It was VERY tasty though.

Really, really good.  I followed many of the reviews and changed a few things.  Started with a layer of onions, baby carrots and a few cloves of garlic..set the chicken on top of that and added just a 1/4 cup of chicken broth so the veggies didn't stick to the bottom.  Stuffed the chicken with more onions, garlic and fresh herbs (rosemary, sage, thyme)...seasoned top with s&p.  Cooked on high for 1 hour, then low for 7 hours.  It was moist but not totally falling apart - just lost one leg!  I will definitely do this all the time now and can't wait to try different seasonings.  I was skeptical about the little to no liquid, but it truly doesn't need it...thinking about turning  the broth it made into soup right now!!

This is way too long for a 5 lb bird let alone 2-3 lbs. I checked after 5 hours and managed to save the meal.

This was really good chicken.  I especially loved the dark meat.  It really did fall off the bone.  I didn't use the aluminum foil balls and did use chicken broth made with a bouillon cube and boiling water on the bottom (2 cups).  I stuffed the whole chicken with green onions and garlic, and put chopped celery, carrots, and a yellow bell pepper under the chicken.  The bell pepper got soggy with all of the cooking, but the rest turned out well.  I did try to season it well and tried to get under the skin as much as I could with the spices.  Smelled great all day too.  I cooked it on high for 2 hours and on low for 4 hours.

This recipe turned out awesome!  Only reason I am giving it a 4 is because I suggest more seasoning.  I put chicken seasoning, paprika, salt and pepper on mine and I like mine more seasoned than that, but it wasn't bad.  I was a little skeptical at first of not putting any liquid into the slow cooker, but I ran with it and am so glad I did.  I know some people said they didn't get the crispy skin....well I did.  Not sure what I did differently, but I didn't open it for about 10 hours and just let it do its job.  Great recipe!

Four because I added minced garlic (jarred) and Creole seasoning. I also rubbed it down with olive oil. Cooked on foil quite a bit longer than the 10 hours because it was family game night. Added a little chicken stock to the bottom of the pan under the foil. Poured the drippings into a sauce pan and boiled and added a little cornstarch and made decent gravy. Everyone loved it. Fell off the bone, couldn't get it out of the pot in one piece. THANKS

I marinated my chicken in the fridge first, Then I cooked it on High for 4 hours. The skin came out crispy, The white meet juicy, and the meat fell off the bone as I was carving it (It held together bringing it out of the crock pot). Great recipe, I will always cook my whole chickens like this from not on. Oh yeah, I used a crock pot liner, and that worked just fine too.

Good but dry....I made a 6 plus pound whole chicken and the timing was way off. Mine was done and the timer popped at 5 hours....I did check the meat and sure enough it was done at 1pm. I did keep it in the crockpot on warm until we ate at 6pm....and I think that is what dried this out. The flavor was good....we just used up all the gravey I had made...lol...I will try this again and not start so early in the morning...and take it out as soon as its done. 8-10 hours was way off, either that or my crockpot is super hot. Will try again. Thanks.

This was a wonderful slow cooker chicken!  The chicken literally fell off the bones!  Just be careful when eating that you remove all bones... especially for kids... those little chickens have tons of bones in them and when everything falls apart so easy, it's no wonder you might find a bone on your plate!  So good, you should definitely try this recipe!

We LOVE this recipe! I have made different little variations, I put potatoes and carrots on the bottom and quarter two onions that I stuff inside the chicken. It is very, very tender! Falls apart, every time. I put all the leftovers in a stock pot and make chicken noodle soup. Great recipe!

I am making this today, for the about the 6th time.  It is such an easy recipe, and the result is a tasty, moist chicken.  I vary the seasonings, from just salt, pepper and paprika.  I add garlic powder and italian seasoning or sometimes cajun seasoning.  I don't use the foil, I just slice up some onions and place the chicken on top...I like the flavor that the onions and the resulting broth give to the chicken.  I don't mind that the underside is not crisp, since I use the extra thigh/leg meat for soup or casseroles.  I have cooked this on low for 7 hours, and on high for 4, with basically the same result, but I find the low temperature imparts a bit more flavor, maybe because the seasonings have more time to penetrate.

This was absolutely AMAZING!  Its so simple and it tasted so good!  I put season salt on it and a tangy and sweet BBQ rub and it was sooo good.  I went to take it out of the crockpot and the whole thing just fell apart.  I had to take it out in pieces.  We love this!!

I could not find a chicken smaller than 5 lbs at my market. the night before i seasoned my chicken both inside and out with olive oil-on top only, salt,pepper,garlic powder, onion powder,oregano and peprika inside and out. in the morning i stuffed the bird with a med onion cut into chunks, and 1/2 an orange,and a clove of garlic, the other 1/2 of orange i squeezed on top the chicken.Under the skin i put 2 garlic cloves and butter. i did not put any water or broth in the crck pot because i did not want a boiled chicken. the chicken created its own broth i used for hommade stuffing and gravy on the side. the chicken had great flavor from the orange. this chicken was so moist and fell off the bones. did not need a knife to carve this bird. great flavor and so tender

This is the easiest chicken recipe I have ever made! I used potatoes instead of the tin foil balls, sprinkled the chicken with "Montreal Chicken" spice, and tossed in some baby carrots. Eight hours on low. The chicken was moist and tender and the house smelled wonderful!

LOVE IT!  I didn't really read the reviews, so when I noticed that the chicken smelled and looked done at about 4.5 hours, I gave it a try!  Perfect!  Fell off the bone, but not shredded.  I still cut off nice breast pieces.  I used a 5 lb. whole chicken and cooked for 4.5 hours on low.  Just some olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder and 1/2 an onion inside the chicken.  I did do the foil along with some potatoes, onions and carrots on the bottom.  I would do this again in a heartbeat!  No more oven roasted chicken for me!

Very easy and delicious! I used potatoes on the bottom,like another review suggested, added quartered onion, seasonings, and about a 1/2 cup of broth on the bottom...my chicken was frozen solid, so I cooked 8 hrs. on low, then added baby carrots in the last 2 hrs. cooking...the husband used the leftovers for sandwiches the next day ;)

Excellent! Very tasty and moist. I also put the potatos, carrots, bell pepper and onion on the bottom (instead of foil). I rubbed spices under the skin and rubbed the skin with margerine. A terrific dinner. With the leftovers, I made chicken tacos:-)

I thought this was quite good.  I used poultry seasoning in lieu of the paprika.  I did use the foil, which seemed to help the chicken to brown a bit.  I did not add any liquid; the chicken exuded wnough on its own.  I also cut the cooking time to about 6 hours.

I used the foil balls, added 1/2 cup water to the bottom, stuffed the cavity with a quartered onion, and sprinkled with salt, pepper, garlic powder, rosemary, and paprika.  The chicken completely fell apart when I tried to take it out of the crock pot (cooked on high for 6 hours).  So presentation wasn't all that great but it tasted great.  And I was worried the foil balls would do something weird, but they did their job of keeping the meat off the bottom.

This turned out to be more like chicken stew because I added chicken broth, I used potatoes instead of tin foil, threw in some carrots & onion.  Next time I will use some celery.  I used garlic salt & oregano for seasonings along with the paprika and s & p.  Hubby loved this and wants me to make it again soon!!  The hardest part was picking out the bones from the crock pot because the chicken just fell off after about 7-8 hours.

Thank you so much for this great recipe! I didn't have a whole chicken. I used 5 thighs and 4 legs. I removed the skin and seasoned according to the recipe. The only additional seasoning I used was Lemon Pepper. It cooked perfectly: tender, juicy, & flavorful. It tasted like delicious rotisserie chicken. I will definitely make this again and again.

This was a great recipe. I think for individuals who like a lot of flavor, you need to add additional seasoning. I stuffed the chicken with the whole onion, thyme and scallion for flavoring. I did put mine in the oven for an hour to get a nice oven baked coloring. Then, I put it in the slow cooker to cook. I used all of the juices, onions, scallions and thyme to make gravy. Then I added a spoon full of flour to get the gravy thick. Overall, this was great. My husband loved it and I served it with rice and peas. We made chicken salad with the excess meat. Then when we got to the bones we made some chicken soup.

AWESOME!!! followed other reviews to remove skin and add chicken stock. Stuffed it with a little garlic & onion, patted dry & seasoned INSIDE AND OUT w/ seasoned salt, pepper, poultry seasoning & fresh garlic rubbed in with a little butter. On High 1 hr, let cook about 7 hours, was great. Add mayo to leftovers for great chix salad!

It is a good recipe, especially for those with busy schedules...I placed chopped garlic, finely sliced green onion (2) with basil and paprika under the skin and it really flavored it, nicely.
It is worth trying and experimenting with until you get your own taste preference.

This was fabulous. I used sweet potatoes underneath the chicken instead of foil and also put a lemon and onion inside the chicken.  Even my kids liked the flavor.

I don't know what happened-- I followed all the directions.  The only thing I did differently was put potatoes on the bottom instead of the foil.  After 10 hours on "low" the chicken was dry and flavorless.

I used more spices then called for in this recipe. I left out the tin foil and replaced it with sweet potatoes, carrots, onions and garlic cloves and a little chicken broth. I also added pigeon peas in the last hour. The chicken was nice and tender. i will definately make this again.

WOW! So easy and delicious (and the leftovers make an excellent chicken salad!). The only thing I changed was that I removed the skin (per other reviewers advice), put a 1/2 cup of water in the bottom of the crock pot, nd stuffed the chicken with onions and apples - it was terrific! I'm making it gain tonight - this time with onions, garlic and oranges.

My family and I didn't like this recipe at all. It seemed so simple; I even followed tips from other reviewers (seasonings, timing, etc) and it turned out horrible. The chicken was "fall off the bone" tender, but no taste! We had more than half a chicken left and my husband asked me to throw it away. (Probably scared of what I might try to make with the leftovers!)

I loved this recipe. I didn't have paprika, so I used Season all instead. I didn't do the 1 hour on high then switch to low setting. i just set it on low and went to work, when I came home it was done.  I just steamed some green beans, made some rice and we had a wonderful, healthy meal, that my 3 girls and husband loved.

This is excellent and so incredibly easy!!  I have made it many times now, always to rave reviews!  One time, it did turn out a bit too oily, but I think I brushed it with too much olive oil and/or cooked it too long.  This is now my "busy day" staple.  5 mins to prep, throw it in the crock pot, and off I go!  Oh, and it makes an awesome, flavorful chicken salad for the next day's lunch.

This was an absolute winner! I combined suggestions from previous reviewers and used chicken parts so it would cook faster. Placed carrots and onion (quartered) in the bottom of slow cooker and added 3/4 cup of chicken stock. 3 tinfoil balls and placed the chicken on top......the meat fell off the bone. Thank you all for your wonderful suggestions!!

This was really good, although i made a few changes.  in addition to paprika, salt and pepper, i also used fresh garlic and a little bit of chicken soup mix.  i sliced the skin so i could put all of the spices inside and outside of the skin to make sure that those who remove the skin before eating still get the flavor.  i only needed to cook it in the crock pot for about 1.5 hours on high and then another 4-5 hours on low.  i was afraid that this wouldn't reheat well and would become dry, but it was still juicy even when reheated without its liquid.

I can see why this recipe made the cookbook.  It's so incredibly easy and good.  I just used Old Bay instead of Paprika....only because I was out of Paprika. I also cut an onion in half and placed that on the bottom of the pot as well.  The whole idea with using recipes is to expand on someone else ideas.  Use part and add your own touch.

This was really good.  I heeded others' advice and added more spices.  I rubbed olive oil on skin and beneath it then salt and pepper and some paprika and used a packet of dry onion soup mix on top.  I placed it on chopped onion and stuffed it with a little as well.  The cooking time could stand to be shortened because it fell completely apart when I tried to take it out of crock pot, but wasn't dry at all.

I used a whole roaster chicken and left it whole.  The flavor of this chicken was wonderful, though the breast meat of the chicken was a little dry and chewy.  I just cut it up and made chicken salad with it which was wonderful!  The changes I made were, I rubbed the chicken with paprika, garlic powder and sprinkled a little black pepper on the top and bottom of the chicken.  In the bottom of the crockpot I put half of an onion (cut in 2 pieces), some carrots, 2 celery stalks and some chicken broth.  I just set the chicken directly on the vegetables, no foil.  Cooked it on high for the first hour, breast side up, then turned the crockpot to low and flipped the chicken breast side down for a couple of hours to try and keep it a little more moist.  Not sure if that added to the dryness of the breast or if it prevented it from being more dry, but I attempted it that way because I had read that suggestion in a couple of reviews.  I would definitely make this again.  The flavor of the chicken was great and the dark meat was very moist.

Like a majority of the folks, my chicken came  out on the dry side.  While it was very tender, it was a little bland.  I will most definetly make again, but will experiment with different seasonings and shorten the cooking time.

I had some issues with this recipe...as others suggested, I smeared the chicken with olive oil, salt, pepper and lemon pepper and I cooked it on high for 1 hour, then low for 9 hours.  The chicken came out very dry and tasteless.  I still give the recipe 4 stars though, cause I think the idea is wonderful. The meat did fall right off the bone. Next time I will probably stuff the chicken with some lemon and garlic and add more seasonings.  I will also reduce the cook time so its not so dry.  Thanks for the idea!

I used butter and lemon juice with a light covering of lemon/pepper spice.  It was very good and fell apart...which is great since I don't like removing the meat off the bone.  Huge it with every member of the family.

So easy and oh so good. I used Montreal Chicken Seasoning instead of salt, pepper & paprika.  The chicken came out so tender and juicy, I couldn't stop picking at it before serving it for dinner.  Loved it!!!

Good recipe.  Cooked on low for 9 hours and omitted the 1 hour on high.  Placed the chicken on a sliced up onion instead of the tin foil.

Wow, does this meat fall right off the bone or what?!  Very good! I didn't get a whole chicken, I got a cut-up whole chicken.  I also used Old World Seasoning from my local specialty spice store (penzeys.com) instead of salt, pepper, and paprika (which is also very good). I didn't have a chance to heat on high for one hour and it turned out fine on low for 9 hours. My light eating boyfriend ate 1/2 of the chicken, as well as "Easy Buscuit Mixture" from this site and broccoli (that's the most I have seen him eat for dinner in a long time!).  This will surly be a regular meal in my home! With the leftovers I am going to make chicken dumpling soup! Thanks!

This was the best! I trussed the chicken so that it would stay firmly over top the foil without touching the sides, and used mccormick rotisserie seasoning. In 9 hours on low, my 4 lb. chicken was browned and moist. I had some surprise guests and I was relieved that this was onhand for dinner. I wowed the crowd! They are all vowing to go home and pull out their dusty slow cookers and start using them again. Thanks!

I followed the advice of others. I used a whole chicken and stuffed the chicken with a quartered onion and some crushed garlic. I went crazy with the seasonings (a bit too crazy, turns out the lids were loose!). I stuck the chicken in a Ziploc bag in the fridge for a few hours. I used the foil balls and cooked it on low for 11 hours. Didn't use water. I have a huge Rival 6.5-quart pot, and the chicken turned out perfect and golden brown with a crispy skin. I didn't expect it to turn out well because after 1 hour of cooking, I had to take out the chicken and reposition it, as it fell off the balls. Overall, it was very tasty and easy. Thanks, "Cotton!"

I followed the directions by putting the chicken on high for about an hour and then (due to being at work), I cooked it on Low for 10 hours.  The legs were hard from touching the walls of the crockpot and then the thighs were pasty because they were so overcooked.  We did not eat the chicken.
I might try it one more time, but I would definitely use LESS time.  I used a 4 1/4 lb. chicken in a 6 qt. crock pot.

I was excited about this recipe-how simple!  Unfortunately, after only 4 hours on LOW my chicken was overcooked-very dry-and I was left looking for another recipe to save it!  I wish I could have stayed home to check it every 20 minutes or so.

This is so simple. Stick a chicken in the pot and it's done.  I have incorporated other's suggestions, like sitting the chicken on cut potatoes, putting a stick of celerery in the cavity.  Experimenting with the spices is a lot of fun.  The paprika is great.  My favorite is to heavily coat the chicken with cumin, then another heavy coat of chili powder.  I throw a few unchopped garlics into the pot.  If you don't want it too soft, put the cooker on high, and have an appliance timer shut it off in 4 hours.  It's still warm when you get home. Fabulous!  A recent discovery:  this is the ultimate way to may turkey drumsticks.  Use low heat for 6-8 hours  Works great with the cumin, chili, and garlic.  I even used partially frozen drumsticks.

I feared the original recipe would be a little bland, so I followed the modifications recommended. I also couldn't find a chicken small enough so I used large chicken breasts. I seasoned the breasts in salt, paprika, and Mrs. Dash. I placed potatoes, carrots, and onions under the chicken with 1/2 a cup water and cooked it on low for 5hrs. It turned out OK but nothing to write home about. It wasn't as moist as I expected... it was a little on the dry side and the potatoes weren't as flavorful. If I make this again, I would use more water with a bullion cube and perhaps dark meat b/c it is more tender than white meat. I would cook it for an hour on high and then low for the time remaining. I hope this helps.

I added garlic salt to this and it was very good.  I made the mistake of draining the juice from the slow cooker an hour before serving.  Don't do that it will make it dry.  But over all it was good.  Thank you for your recipe.

I used a 4.5 lb whole chicken that I skinned myself.  I put quarter onions and garlic cloves in the cavity and put a few quartered onions in the bottom of the cooker w/foil.  I seasoned very generously with rosemary, garlic powder, poultry seasoning, cracked pepper and salt.  I cooked on high for 2 hours and low for 2 hours.  The chicken was very tender and juicy.  My only complaint was that it did fall apart when I tried to remove it.  I will defintely make again.

I mixed together a teaspoon salt, a teaspoon lemon pepper and a teaspoon of paparika and the smeared the mixture all over the chicken inside and out.  I took the sugesstion of others and lifted up the skin on the breast and smeared some of the mixture there also.  I just took it out of the crock pot and it is the most tasteful chicken I have ever cooked.  I am going to be using the left overs in a salad for tomorrow night.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

One of the best chicken crock pot meals I've ever made!  I used 3 onions cut up instead of foil, and used a whole chicken, cut up already, with skin removed...the chicken came out incredible...tender, tasty, and easy!  I will make this again and again!

This is a simple and great way to make chicken!  I usually use onion cut up on the bottom instead of the foil pieces, it gives the chicken more flavor and still does the same job as the foil!  You can use the chicken for soooo many things!  I use it for shredded chicken in my mexican dishes!  YUMMY!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

The reviewers either love it or hate it.  I have to say I'm in the hate group.  My chicken came out dry. With the price of chicken I probably won't try this again. Sorry Cotton Couch. :)

The idea of wadding foil balls was very good. I feel the chicken cooked too long but as has been stated the idea for seasonings is endless. I love the ease of throwing it into the crockpot with no fuss and having a very delicious dinner ready at the end of the day.

I used crushed garlic and a quartered onion in the cavity as recommended by other reviewers.  For further flavor, I also put a lemon in the cavity, since I have used that successfully in roast chicken a number of times.  Unfortunately, it didn't translate.  The meat turned out kind of bitter, I suppose because the cooking time was so much longer, allowing the flavor of the bitter pith to penetrate the meat.  I think I prefer roast chicken if I'm going to make chicken the "main dish" of the meal.  However, this slow cooker method would be great if you need chicken meat for chicken salad or something comparable.

Great idea, I can't believe I did figure this out for myself. This is so easy, there is just my husband and I so we can easily make 2-3 meals out of one chicken. I will shred some up for burritos, or chicken salad. The great thing is it can cook while I'm at work! Yippee!

This was a very good dinner. Instead of using paprika, I used garlic powder,a little bit of lemon juice and some rosemary. It smelled great when i opened the pot! The chicken was falling off the bone. Great idea!!

This is a very easy way to "bake" a chicken. If you're using butter, be careful not to use too much or it will taste greasy. Thanks for the recipe!

this is a supereasy recipe with fantastic results.
i was quite generous with the seasonings (didnt follow instructions here but kind of sprinkled) salt, pepper, herbs de provence and paprika. absolutely wonderful, put everything in the crockpot and look forward to a good meal. best with big drumsticks (i remove the skin and fat) had no need for aluminium as well and the liquid that is formed from the cooking makes good gravy!

This really wasn't any good.  The chicken was dry and the skin was very, very soggy.  I used lots of garlic powder, but it still didn't have much flavor.  My husband and I threw out the leftovers and my toddler wouldn't touch it.

This is the best slow cooked chicken I've had. I used Lawery's Seaoning Salt (for that extra kick)...allowed the chicken to sit overnight (refrigerated) for better flavor inside/out. Then, cooked according to directions. Thumbs Up!!!

This was tasty and simple.  I used bone in chicken breasts but I think a whole chicken would have been better.  The breasts got a little dry.

I've made this recipe over and over. I usually use a whole chicken (not parts) and I use more paprika than asked for- in fact, I season it generously. When it's done, the meat practically falls off the bone- it's so tender and even the breastmeat is moist.  My whole family loves this dish. Sometimes I'll slather it (generously!) in barbecue sauce alone, and it comes out even just as good! I've referred both recipes to friends.

Seasoned the chicken heavily as recommended by others but the chicken still didn't have much flavor and the breast meat turned out very dry.  I probably won't try this one again.

We didn't care for this recipe at all. The chicken was tender but even with the addition of spices and seasoning salt as others had suggested it was not very good. I ended up throwing most of it away which was a shame and a waste. I won't make it again.

Sprinkled generously on 3 lb. of cut up chicken with Lawry's Seasoned salt, garlic powder, paprika, black pepper, and a tiny bit of Herbes de Provence. Also threw in an onion chopped in big chunks.  Cooked chicken in the crockpot over the foil balls for 9 hours on low while I slept.  
The result?  The dark meat is juicy and tender.  The breasts were on the dry side.  The meat wasn't salty or tasty enough which surprised me since I used so much seasoning.  It wasn't until I scooped the juices (very salty!) that ran to the bottom of the crockpot onto the chicken that it tasted wonderful.  The juice wasn't greasy since I had washed and removed the chicken of excess fat/skin before cooking.  
I recommend this recipe but I would put more spices in besides the salt, pepper and paprika it mentions in the recipe.
Also, if anyone has any ideas on how to make the breast meat more tender I'd like to hear it.  Next time I'll cook it for 8 hours instead and maybe play around with wrapping the breast meat in foil...

I never thought to roast a chicken in my slow cooker, but I gave it a try.  Boy was I ever pleased with this chicken.  It was moist and the meat fell off the bones.  And the best part is that any leftovers went right back in the slow cooker and became soup!

Great and so easy.  Very moist, even the white meat.  I added a few more of my favorite spices.  We loved it.  I am eager to fix it again. Thanks.

I make this recipe at least once a week.  It is great served hot or cold.  I made it last week in the evening and it cooked all night, we had it cold with a salad for dinner that night. This is my favorite recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

This was the easiest recipe ever!!  The chicken was so moist that it fell off the bones and we had difficulty getting it out of the crock pot.  I've never had chicken this tender and moist!

Most Excellent ! I just retired and decided I was going to do the cooking from now on at home. I don't have any experience at cooking, but I use the recipes I find here all the time. She has started to call me maestro. I am becoming the connoisseur of the Crock pot.

This is the best recipe for cooking a whole chicken in crock pot.  The foil rolled up and put on bottom of crock pot was the key to moist chicken and cripy skin.  Wouldn't change a thing!

I used less olive oil to coat the chicken and it still turned out very well. The chicken had lots of flavour and was very moist.  I made gravy out of the drippings and it was delicious.  It’s one of my favourite ways to do chicken.

The foil balls are a great idea. It keeps the fat and moisture off the chicken so it does not "stew". In a bowl I mixed chopped potatoes, carrots, mushrooms, onions, zucchini, etc with a little olive oil, garlic powder and various herbs. Then I wrapped them (not overly tightly) in four foil balls and rested the chicken on them. Some juice from chicken got in but not too much. Delicious!

Followed the directions almost exactly, used Lawry's Seasoned salt instead of the paprika and salt and pepper. Excellent results. No the chicken doesn't look fantastic, but it's all in the taste and this was probably the best chicken I have ever cook. Moist and tender. I found that after you take it out of the slow cooker and let it sit for a minute the skin does kinda crisp up a little. Also the wings and legs that were touching the sides of the slow cooker came out nice and crispy.

After reading the other comments I changed the recipe as follows.  I cut up 3 carrots, 2 pieces of salary and cut an onion in sixths and placed it on the bottom of the cooker.  I took 1/4 cup softened butter and added thyme, sage, salt and pepper and mixed it well.  I rubbed the butter under the chicken breast skin and around the entire chicken.  As suggested by another, I wrapped it in cheesecloth and added it to the cooker breast side down.  I also added a can of low sodium chicken broth but next time will use only half.  I cooked it on high for 1 1/2 hours, low for 5 hours then high again for another 45 minutes.  The chicken was really ugly to look at so don't plan on serving it whole.  The cheesecloth was great because it really did just fall apart.  After pulling the meat off of the chicken and pulling out the carrots, it was terrific.  The husband loved it and while not pretty, a keeper.  The chicken if I'd had any leftover would have made great salad topping or sandwiches so I might make some just for that next time.

I added carrots, onion and celery to the inside of the chicken.  I lifted a bit of the skin off the top so I could season the actual meat.  Used extra seasoning also- garlic, poultry seasoning etc.  Poured a little chicken broth on bottom of crock pot to keep things moist.  Loved this- so moist and flavorful- AND EASY!

This is by-far the best chicken I've ever had, and it's super easy. I followed the directions exactly. Super moist, falls off the bone, and smells delish when you're walking into the house after a long day at the office. My husband REALLY loved it.

unfortunately, this didn't work out too well for me...I followed the recipe to a T, except I used onions cut in half instead of the foil balls, but the chicken was very, VERY dry, even with the juices made into a thin gravy and we could only eat the drumsticks.  The rest will go into a casserole during the week, I guess.  Won't be using this method again tho'.  Some things just do better in the oven!

Delicious. Will get several meals out of it. I added 1 onion chopped with the chicken. Cooked on high for an hour as directed but accidental turned it down to warm instead of low. I didnt notice it for 3 hours! I turned it back up to high for about four hours and it turned out perfectly.

Flavorfull, somewhat healthy and so so easy.  I used half split chicken breasts with rib in and skin on.  I sprayed regular spam on the chicken After placing in crock pot. I highly recommend it!

This was really good!  I did add a few spices because several had said it was bland.  I used garlic salt, black pepper, paprika, thyme and rosemary.  I put celery and onion in the cavity and I added some chicken broth to the crock pot.  I did not cook mine as long as suggested because my crock pot tends to cooker faster than most recipes.  I think I cooked it for about 5 1/2 - 6 hours and it was moist and delicious.

I really want to like this recipe but I have made it multiple times over the years and I never like the way it turns out. The flavors are lacking, and my chicken is falling off the bone unfortunately I don't think I like this this way. Maybe I over cooked it or didn't put enough seasonings but I usually add more spices than what the recipe calls for.

Great recipe.  Just make it your own by adding additional spices you might like.

I added a garlic thyme butter under the skin to keep the breasts moist and full of flavor.

This has become an all time favorite in my house. We make it every couple of weeks and use the leftover meat for chicken burritos. The tinfoil bit freaked me out a bit, so I just used the rack that came with the slow cooker. I stuff the chicken with whatever is lying around, usually an onion and garlic. We like our spice so we usually coat it with a jerk or some other spicy flavor combo.

This was delicious. I felt weird putting the foil balls in there so like someone else suggested I added an onion that I quarter along with a few veggies and placed the chicken on top of that. I was nervous about putting a chicken in the slow cooker and the skin doesn't crisp up like the oven. (But I try not to eat it anyway since it's not very healthy)
I ended up with more liquid than expected so I  strained it and with the leftover chicken and that also main an amazing chicken soup!

I changed the recipe a bit after reading some of the other reviews--I added a little chicken broth, some potatoes and carrots on the bottom, then covered the chicken with vegetable oil and sprinkled some Italian seasoning and paprika on it and cooked on low for about 6 hours...I did try stuffing it with carrots, but they didn't cook as well...otherwise, the recipe came out good and I will make it again :)

This couldn't be easier and is great when you want plain 'ol chicken.  As has been said, the skin falls off, along with all the seasoning.  I use the leftover chicken in pasta or a casserole.

I was so excited about making this but was not excited about eating it. Through it in the oven to brown so it looked more appealing. It was edible but will not do this again.  Thanks anyway.

This was good enough, but I would only do this again if I didn't have time to roast a chicken in the oven the old fashioned way - SO much better (or if it was too hot to use the oven).

I hate to give bad reviews, but I made this chicken over the weekend and it was bland. Very bland. I put an onion and an apple in the cavity of the chicken, rubbed the skin with butter so it would brown, even put the spices (garlic powder and rosemary) under the skin and sprinked with paprika.  The house SMELLED WONDERFUL.  Too bad the chicken didn't taste like it smelled.  Even the gravy I made from the drippings of the chicken didn't help much.

Pretty tasty and delicious! I used drumsticks because I was shorter on time and they came out nicely. I used the entire can of chicken broth on the bottom with the potatoes and carrots and onion and after seasoning the drum sticks I just placed them on top and left them alone for hours. The veggies came out really well also.  I only give it 4 because it seems like a 'BASE' recipe that a number of modifications could really give some pizazz to. I will definitely do again, perhaps, this time with curry!

I do this allll the time.. actually just made one last night!  I don't put the foil in the crock pot.  I cut onions into quarters, use baby carrots, and celery stalks instead.  I  a small can of low-sodium chicken broth, poultry seasoning, and smoked paprika to the vegetables and chicken.  It always falls apart and goes so good with mashed potatoes because your gravy is already almost made for you with the juice in the crockpot.  GREAT comfort food!

I was so excited about the masterpiece I had created, only to find out at the end it was HORRIBLE! I used some Lawry's Herb and Garlic marinade that I put under the skin. Like others I put celery, onions, potatoes, and carrots at the bottom, along with some white wine. I cooked it on high for an hour and then on low for 9 hours (the recipe calls to cook for 10 hours). The chicken all fell off the bone and was so mushy we couldn't even eat it. The veggies were great though! So disappointed. :-(

I season under the skin, as well as over it. That way you get the flavor and juiciness from the skin while still getting the seasoning  into the meat.  Either way, I think it is a great ricipe and so versatile for everyone's taste.  It's the method and technique that I am glad to have.

I only gave this recipe 3 stars because it is quite  bland.  It was tender and juicy (although I think I overcooked it 30-60 minutes) but it just tasted so plain, my family passed the salt and pepper around... twice.  I think that I am perhaps spoiled from my families beer-butt chicken recipe... there is simply no comparison, so while this chicken is ok, the other is soooo much better.

the concept is great, I used a 3lb chicken and placed it on the foil, cooked it on high for 4 hours. was perfect, I added flour to the drippings in the crockpot and made gravy.  my one complaint would be the chicken needs alot more seasoning...under the skin.. I love szeged chicken rub so maybe a little of that and poultry seasoning would help.

This chicken is amazing. Dont take my word for it, try it yourself. Perfect chicken every single time. I dont use the foil but I dont see where it would hurt if you did. I just add a little water to the bottom of my cooker. Simple and satisifying and very easy. Thank you

This worked out great. I cooked on low for 10 hours and the chicken was falling off the bone and looked nice and brown. I used a lot less paprika and added garlic powder to the mix. I might adjust the spices next time for better flavor.

I wanted to like this sooooo bad but I have to say, I'm not a fan.  Too bland.  If you want something more interesting, I suggest the slow cooker Adobo chicken recipe on this site.

This is such an easy recipe! Rather than using a whole chicken, I used chicken thighs and drumsticks since I had them in the freezer. After reading some of the reviews, I ended up browning the chicken on the stove first. Then I placed the chicken in the cooker and left it there for about an hour on high and it came out nice an tender. Goes great with garlic mashed potatoes and any steamed veggies.

I followed directions to a tee-except my bird was 4 lbs- same cook time.  Chicken was tender and moist- yes, it was greasy but used the drippings to make delicious gravy!  Served with mashed potatoes, green beans, butter noodles and rolls for a super yummy Sunday night dinner!

So easy!  I add one small extra step to the preparation.  I mix 1 T softened butter, 1/4 tsp. minced garlic and a sprinkling of basil together and lightly spread under the skin of each breast.  Instead of aluminum foil, I cut potatoes in halves or thirds (depending on the size), cut an onion in wedges and sprinkle some baby carrots in the bottom of the slow cooker.  Place your chicken on top to cook and you've got a full meal in one pot!

this reipes is SOOO GOOD and super easy - have followed the recipe to a T and have made it adding different spices - Always Always falls apart and sooo moist never added liquid to the bottom and the foil balls keep it from sticking to the slow cooker -- Also the only pieces this recipe calls for are the foil balls not chicken pieces

This is a great recipe, but I do make changes.. I sprinkle garlic powder, onion powder, poulty seasoning, paprika, and even lemon pepper inside and out and then i melt about 2 tbsp of butter and drizzle on top. no need for water or broth on the bottom, the chicken makes plenty of drippings to make gravy with.. delicious!

I'm not sure if my Crock Pot cooks too hot or what, but by the time this was ready to serve, it was really dry.  I should have followed my instinct and pulled it out a couple hours early.

Got this ready yesterday morning and walked out the door not knowing what to expect. Came home to the most tender, juicy, fall-off-the-bone chicken I have ever tasted. Better than any rotisserie chicken from the store and less expensive too! All the juicies collect in the bottom so you can easily drain off the fat and make gravy. I will make this again to be sure!

Like a few others said....Not sure if I can rate this perfect when I didn't actually follow it. The idea of foil in my crockpot scared me! I cut potatoes in half and lined the bottom of the crock, then I placed diced carrots, celery, and onion on top, I rinsed and dried the chicken and put some onions in the middle of it and then sprinkled it w/ salt, pepper and Salt Lick seasoning on both sides. I added 2 cups of chicken stock and put it on low to cook while I was at work! It was amazing! Loved it! Will definitely make again!

This was amazing!  We put our vegetables under the chicken, instead of the tin foil, and everything literally fell off the bone.  Awesome chicken!

I was pleasantly surprised at how well this turned out. The chicken cooked in its own natural juices. The meat just fell off of the bone and was absolutely delicious. Thank you so much for this recipe. I will never bake chicken any other way.

Wow, this tasted great & was easy. I heavily seasoned the chicken with EVOO, Oregano, Paprika, S&P. I added potatoes, carrots, celery and onion to the bottom of the crock pot (instead of foil). I wish my crock pot would have been bigger so I could have added more. I cooked the chick in 2 cans of chicken broth. Everything tasted a lot like chicken noodle soup (without the noodles of course). I will make this again!

Very moist...in fact, maybe a little too moist??  Don't know if this is a bad or good thing but it almost seemed a little mushy.  Maybe it's because I left it on for 9-ish hours...BUT all in all, better moist than dry.  very delicious flavors and couldn't believe that it came from my slow cooker!  Instead of foil balls i used carrots, celery, and onions.

The meat really did fall of the bone.  It was really tender and super easy to make.  I felt like it could have used more flavor though.

I put this in before church and came home to a wonderfully tender chicken. I skipped the foil and put onions, carrots and potatoes on the bottom of the crock pot. Salt and peppered the chicken and put a quarter of an onion inside. Added half a cup of water. Set it on high and let it cook for four hours. When I got home, I put the chicken on a sheet pan and broiled it for some added color. Made gravy by removing the veggies and stirring in corn starch thinned with water. Divine!

This chicken was quite a hit at dinner!!  My picky kids ate it up.  The chicken was very tender and juicy, and it actually fell right off the bone.  Next time I make it, I will probably add some vegetables in the crockpot.  Very, very simple but delicious recipe!

Excellent recipe, unless you are worried about presentation. The chicken did fall apart as soon as I tried to take it out of the slowcooker. I mixed a little butter with spices including pampered chef's Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and garlic and spread that under the skin before cooking. I also cut a small onion into quarters and put that on the inside. My chicken was 4.5 lbs and I left it in for 10 hours. There was enough drippings in the bottom of the crockpot to make gravy for the potatoes that I made. Definitly a keeper! Thanks 'Cotton' Couch

LOL, I guess slow cookers differ as this came out very tender but with no recognizable chicken parts, everything just collapsed so it was easy to pick it off the bones as it already was!!!

Cooked on low for 9 hours and added some extra seasonings. I also peeled back the skin and added the seasonings to the meat itself. Great way for moist fall off the bone chicken.

I changed the recipe so much it's hard to rate, but thanks to the basics the chicken was wonderful. A local store sells chunked vegetables for stir-fry, so I put those on the bottom of my crock pot (instead of foil) with 1/2-3/4 cup chicken broth. The bird was seasoned with Creole seasoning inside and out, and had half a lemon stuffed in the cavity. It was about a 3 lb. chicken so I cooked it on high for one hour and low for 6. The skin didn't brown, but the meat literally fell off the bones. I may cut back on time next time because it was almost too tender. Thanks so much for the great idea.

This was great, fall of the bone chicken.  I got this recipe from the allrecipes cookbook, and it said to use chicken parts, here it says a whole chicken.  I used 2 pounds of chicken thighs and it cooked in 6 hours.  Next time I make it I will add more seasoning.  Since it took less than the 8 to 10 hours to cook than I was planning, I removed the chicken from the crock pot and re-heated in the oven at dinner time, this crisped up the skin nicely.

I followed others' suggestions and did the following:  rubbed spices under the skin (of whole chicken), placed chicken on top of carrots and whole red potatotes.  Cooked on high for 2 hours and low for 4 hours.  The chicken was EXTREMELY dry and not great...

Great, simple recipe. I need lots of cooking "help" when it comes to the kitchen. My 17-year old son loved it and he is a very picky eater.

Two thumbs wayyyy up for preparation ease.  I cooked the chicken in the crock pot for 2 hours on high and 4 on low on a bed of carrots and 2 cups of chicken stock (garlic and herb) after reading other reviews.  I also seasoned it with adobo and garlic on top and under the skin and the results were phenomenal.

I made this for my family before I went to class today. I put in on low for about 5 1/2 hours...boy was it ever dry. I will not make this again. I even put chicken broth in the bottom, onions and garlic in the cavity, and seasonings on top. my poor family choked it down. (at least the kids drank their milk!!) The reason I gave it 2 stars is because it was really nice coming home to a cooked meal and the leftover chicken will make a good soup/casserole

I am on crutches for a few months and love to come up with simple recipes like this.  The reviewers who are chopping garlic, onion, peeling carrots, smearing on a spice rub etc. must have more time on their hands.  This recipe is perfect as it is for the time it takes to prepare, and also turned out very juicy.  So my review is based on exactly as written.  I am aware that my crockpot cooks faster so adjusted accordingly.

I have never baked a chicken in my crockpot, but I will definitely try this one again. I used as my seasonings- basil,oregano,and some Mrs Dash. I cooked it one hr on high, and 9 hrs on low and it was great! I used the leftover chicken to make chicken and dumplings. Awesome! thanks for this recipe!

This turned out really well, but I did make a few changes. Instead of putting the foil on the bottom, I added some chopped potatoes and carrots.  I also added half an onion and a few sprigs of thyme to the cavity.  Talk about great flavor!

I seasoned my chicken with Lawry's seasoning salt, black pepper, and garlic powder.  I put it on low and night and when I got ready to go to work, it was done.  Served it with confetti rice and collard greens.  Delicious and easy!!!

Based on a few of the other reviews, I made a few modifications to the recipe. Added my favorite seasoning and stuffed the chicken with onions and garlic. Instead of foil, I added onions with a lil bit of chicken broth. Cooked for 6 hours and it came out very good and tender!

Excellent.  My slow cooker has a meat rack and a temperature probe and the combination made this chicken come out wonderful.  I used a commercial poultry meat rub instead of salt and pepper.

Talk about falling apart....the chicken literally fell off the bone as I was trying to take it out of the crock pot. It didn't look very appetising after that, but it was very moist and tender. I placed the chicken on top of baby carrots and potatoes. I combined all of my favorite seasonings and rubbed them into the chicken and then rubbed melted butter on the chicken as well. I added a little bit of water to the bottom of the pot and added more melted butter about halfway through. I suggest that you not cook longer than 5 1/2 hours. Any longer and it would've been over cooked.

Made this chicken for the first time and it came out tasting great. I did however make a few changes. I seasoned it with some lemon pepper sea salt and on the bottom I poured some College Inn Culinary Broth White Wine & Herb. Cooked it for 8 hrs on low and when it was done the chicken was falling off the bone.

I took other users suggestions and lined the bottom of the crock pot with veggies instead on foil. 2 Onions, 2 Carrots, and 2 Celery Stalks, chopped. I added about a cup of Chicken Broth. The Chicken was delicious, extremely most and tasty. I ate some that some, and use the rest to make chicken soup.

I made this for the family and I loved it and so did my children... My Husband on the other hand missed the baked skin.. our chicken did not fall of the bone, it was most and lots of flavor and it was wonderful.. I would make this again if my Husband was no so dang picky .. this was a wonderful dish and tasted oh so most .. moster then my chicken cooked in the oven. I season it with Seasoning Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder and just a little Creo seasoning.. I then made homemade gravey and potatoes.. Yum, Yum good.. yes, I would make this every week or two but because he is a you know what.. I am sorry to say , that I will be wasting time on a dry chicken just to have the crust on the chicken

I was skeptical, but I watched the video and thought it looked good. My chicken looked pale and corpse-like, and extremely unappetizing. No one wanted to eat it once they got a good look at it. I had to make a different meal and save the meat for something else. Perhaps there is no substitute for roasting a chicken in the oven. Especially for a family like mine that fights over crispy skin.

This was pretty good.  I did the foil balls, and used salt and pepper. However I didn't think that would be enough so I added some onion, thyme, and a bay leaf and 1/2 cup of water with some chicken bouillon.  Cooked on high for just over an hour and then I turned it down to low for 6 hours. It was tender and tasted good.  Thanks for the recipe, I'll make this again soon.

This was easy and delicious. I used chicken parts because that's what I had. Breasts and boneless, skinless thighs. I added grape vinegar, garlic powder and dried onion flakes to the bottom of the pot. I also added dill and parsly flakes to the seasoning. I stirred it at least three times and it took about 5 hours on high. My family loved it. The next day I shredded the chicken and threw everything into a fresh drained pot of pasta. I added a little water and mixed it all up and it was delicious as well. Great recipe.

I liked this chicken and as others said it did fall right off the bone.  However, it lacked flavor.  I quartered an onion and also used garlic cloves as one reviewer suggested and I also rubbed it down with paprika, garlic salt, Mrs. Dash, seasoned salt,poultry seasoning, pepper-it was still pretty bland.  I shredded the rest of the chicken and I am going to use it to make chicken enchiladas.

It was sooo tender, and juicy!  I did was others said, and after it is cooked, to put it in the oven to crisp the skin.  I used a chicken rub inside and out.  What I will do next time is put the chicken breast side down.  So the breast will be more juicy.
Thanks for the recipe!

Very tender and moist. I took the advice of some of the other reviews, and stuffed it with celery and onion and crushed garlic. Sprinkled with the paprika and sea salt and sage. High 1 hour, low 8 hours.

Like other reviewers I added a sliced onion to the bottom of the crockpot instead of foil. I put half an onion and 3 celery stalks (cut to fit) inside the chicken, coated it with Creole Seasoning also from this site, and cooked per instructions. Wonderful, moist, tasty chicken! Great to keep on hand in the freezer, either cubed or shredded, for casseroles, pizza, nachos, enchiladas, etc. Thanks for the post!

Removed the skin and used the seasoning for Sticky Rotisserie Chicken. Stuffed with onion and a couple cloves peeled garlic. Put potatoes and carrots on the bottom instead of tin foil balls and added a small amount of chicken broth to the bottom (1/2 cup?).  Meat definitely fell off the bone. Used leftovers for soup and tacos. Great if you are looking to make the bird in a slow cooker but I still prefer to roast mine in the oven.

This recipe is great to throw something in the crock pot before leaving for work and have supper ready when you get home.  I would recommend adding a few more seasonings and even injecting the chicken with something.  We've cooked this twice now and both times the skin has been flavorful, but the chicken itself was rather bland.  The second time we cooked it we added some lemon pepper to the outside as well.

I have made this chicken several times, and I love it! It is absolutely perfect for a working couple, we even serve it when we have people over for dinner. I just get up in the morning and sprinkle the chicken with salt, pepper, and paprika, put the crock pot on high for an hour to brown the skin, then turn it on low for the rest of the day! By the time we come home from work we can smell that dinner is ready! We serve it with brown rice (Cooked in chicken broth) and use some of the drippings from the crockpot over the rice. SO GOOD!

This recipe is delicious!  I used a 5 pound chicken and it came out juicy and tender. No knife needed here, the meat just fell off the bone. This will make its way into my rotation of whole chicken dinners.

This was very easy to make. I cooked for 2 hours on HIGH, 5 on LOW- could have gone a little longer, but it fell off the bone. The outer layer of chicken tasted awesome (where the spices/lemon/butter had been) but the inner chicken meat was somewhat dry. Next time I will cook the chicken breast side down.

I couldn't believe how easy this was. I used a large frozen chicken. Spread minced garlic, poultry season ,paprika, salt and pepper over the top. There was no room for veggies so I steamed some to serve with dinner. We had a lot leftover since the bird was so big. I picked it clean and used the meat and broth for chicken noodle soup the next day. It was the absolute best chicken noodle soup I have ever made, my husband even said so. I also felt pretty good about getting so many meals out of a $6.00 chicken.

After reading the other reviews, I did what others did and put potatoes and carrots on the bottom of the slow cooker. I also stuffed the chicken with onions and garlic. I also added a can of chicken broth which I probably did not need to do since I wound up having to take some of the broth out of the slow cooker. I got enough chicken broth out to use for the stuffing and the rice that I was cooking to go with the chicken. After only 6 hours, I turned the slow cooker down to warm and the chicken still fell apart when we took it out. Still, it was very flavorful and very moist. I will definitely be cooking it again.

Very easy to make and very good flavour! I used a 3 pound chicken and cooked it on low for 8h. I used the foil balls to elevate the chicken, all the fat goes to the bottom.

I added chicken broth to the bottom also. The chicken fell apart as I took it out. It was a little bland without the gravy I made but otherwise so easy. I put it on high for 2 hours and low for 5 hours. It was a wonderful meal to come home to after being out in the cold watching the Iditarod restart.  I'm sure all those dogs we saw would love this chicken too:)

This was very easy and turned out very good. I did use past reviewers' suggestions and added some chicken broth to bottom of slow cooker. I also cooked for two hours on high, and then turned down to low and cooked for an additional five hours. Chicken was cooked perfectly. I then took the left over drippings and broth, added mushrooms and made a mushroom gravy to go along with our dinner.

Made it on Sunday and it was so tasty!! I added a 1/2 cup of chicken broth, 2 quartered potatoes under chicken (no foil), sprinkled 4 sliced garlic cloves and 1 sliced white onion. Garlic powder, garlic salt, ground sage over. Cooked on high for 2 hours, then low for 6. It fell off the bone. I put half of the chicken aside for chicken soup stock for today!

I looked for a long time to find a baked WHOLE chicken recipe cooked in the slow cooker. I like this recipe because the paprika makes the chicken nice and brown and it is ready when I get home from work. I drain the juices to make gravy if we need it. Thanks for this on.

This recipe turned out very nicely. I did use a lot of other reviewers' ideas though. I skinned the chicken to allow the flavor to soak in, and I also placed potatoes, broccoli, baby carrots, and cauliflower (all frozen except the carrots)in the bottom of the slow cooker. I put 2 cloves of diced garlic and half an onion cut up in the chicken itself  I also put in one can of chicken broth and let that cook all day, about 11 hours or so. Well, the chicken quite literally fell off the bone, it came out of the slow cooker in two pieces! VERY tender. We didn't eat all of it, so I shredded up the chicken, added some peas, corn, green beans, and more carrots and let that stew all the next day and we had wonderful chicken stew the next night!

I'm all for "fall off the bone tender" and juicey meats, however, when the chicken falls apart as I'm trying to take it out of the cooker it's a bit much. The idea was good and definitely add more seasonings maybe cook it a few hours less. I even used a huge oven stuffer roaster about 6 lbs. just didn't work for me, sorry.

Great recipe. I think it's a little incomplete  as far as flavor goes so this it what I did: I poured a 1/2 cup of decent leftover champagne  and a 1/2 cup of chicken broth in the slow cooker. I stuffed the chicken with onion, unpeeled garlic and fresh sage. I sliced red potatoes and put them on the bottom of the cooker like another reviewer suggested. after the chicken was cooked i pulled  the stuffing out of the cavity and squeezed it on to slice bread... oh man, was it good. also I thought this recipe needed quite a bit of salt and pepper.

I've used this recipe with the foil balls multiple times now (using a relatively small whole chicken), and it comes out perfectly every time - I just use large tongs to hold the chicken together while lifting it off of the foil.

My chicken came out perfect using this method, I followed the cooking method. But, enhanced the seasonings to family favorites, (garlic salt, pepper) The chicken was tender for me. But, didn't fall of the bone so it was easy to cut the breast pieces off. Great way to cook a whole chicken.

I took the skin off first so the spices went directly on the chicken. I also stuffed the chicken with an onion. It was so tender and moist without being soggy.  t's amazing what lifting a chicken up on tinfoil in a crockpot will do!  Will definitely make this one again!

This was very good and very easy.  I prepped it the night before so I turned if on before leaving for work.  It was nice to come home to prepared dinner on a Friday night.  I stuffed the chicken with onion and garlic and rosemary.  I put potatoes and carrots and a stalk of celery (for flavor) on the bottom.  I also added chicken broth.  I seasoned the chicken with salt, garlic pepper, paprika.  I also had some fresh thyme and rosemary and I used that.  I also thought it needed more flavor and will do a better job at getting it under the skin.  I will make this again and try to get more flavor.  It still was very good.

This was a great and quick recipe! I didn't put the aluminum in the crockpot because I have heard some scary stuff about cooking with aluminum.  I stuffed the bird with onion and garlic and put onion in the crockpot as well. I buttered the bird and put lots of different flavors in it along with some broth.  I put it on high for about 6 hours and turned out so moist and yummy!

soo good. so easy.  I have already passed it to 3 people.  I seasoned heavily (lawrys and garlic powder), browned in olive oil (not as intimidating as it sounds- just make sure you brown to a good color because this will be the color of your bird when it's done), stuffed the cavity with onion quarters and minced garlic, wadded three pieces of foil into balls and placed in the bottom of my cooker, and then put the bird on top and closed the lid. I followed the temperature and cooking times of recipe. There were quite a bit of drippings from the chicken at the end (yummy gravy). Warning: I used 5.5 pound bird and it was almost too big for my cooker- make sure your bird will fit before you start.

Why didn't I try this sooner? This recipe is amazingly easy.  I had a very large chicken (from a farmer)it filled the entire crockpot and, this did not need 8 hours.  I was very liberal with the seasonings and stuffed w/ onion, garlic, and more seasonings.  I tried to take this out of the crockpot to "carve" but it just fell apart! I was able to get 2 large breast pieces, the rest was smaller pieces great for soup, casseroles, or salad.  Try this!

This was excellent. I used an 8 pound chicken, cooked it on high for an hour and on low for another nine. I used seasoned salt, pepper and some hot sauce on the chicken. It had a great taste. Will make again and again.

I made this when company was coming over and it was great! I seasoned the top of the chicken with garlic powder, salt, pepper, paprika, and italian seasoning. Cooked it for 9 hours (first hour on high) and it fell off the bone.

I used chicken legs and took off the skin. I scored them and seasoned them liberally with seasoned salt, paprika, salt and pepper. I also used lemon pepper seasoning, but didn't taste it at all after it was cooked. I put onions and potatoes on the bottom of the cooker.  The chicken was perfectly cooked.  My husband loved it.  I didn't add any broth and it made alot of it's own juice.  Next time I'll just use onion and garlic and no potatoes.  The potatoes were soaked in juice, pretty pointless in the dish to me.

This was pretty good. I did stuff the cavity with garlic cloves and diced onions. I seasoned the chicken under the skin and on top with paprika, salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning.  I used carrots and small potatoes on the bottom of my crock pot with some chicken broth.  It was very tender and my hubby and I both enjoyed it!

Definetely tastes like you spent an afternoon preparing this.  I liked cooking the potatoes and carrots under the chicken for a complete meal.  Meat fell off the bone, I cooked on high for 2 hrs before turning down to low.

I also used potatoes on the bottom of the slow cooker instead of aluminum foil.  Also, I seasoned it with "Zehders" Chicken Seasoning from Frankenmuth, Michigan.

This was the perfect recipe find!  Made it last week while I had my kitchen all tore up while puttin g in a new floor.  Turned out to be the best meal I had all week, with leftovers for the next two nights.  I used rosemary on the chicken instead of paprika, as I couldn't find the paprika in the chaos, and it was excellent.  I'll do the paprika thing next time I make this, which will be within the week.  Cooking the chicken this way is excellent, nothing to keep track of, and the thing was so tender it started to fall apart as I lifted it from the crock-pot.  And all the fat drips away to a puddle well-under the meat.

This was very good.  I rubbed a 7# roaster with garlic salt, pepper, a few pats of butter and a pkg of onion soup mix.  I put lemon halves in the cavity.  Also, I added a cup of water and used the foil balls.  I cooked it on high for 3 hours and on low for 4.  Most tender chicken we've ever eaten!!  This is a great way to cook chicken for salads, casseroles, etc., and it makes plenty of juice.  If you're looking for that brown skin you find on a rotisserie chicken, you'll  not find it here.  This method kind of poaches the chicken.  Lots of possibilities here.

This was very easy and good, meat just fell right off the bone!!!!!
NOTE: DO NOT ADD CHICKEN BROTH!!!
I did this just because and I didnt need it at all, chicken makes enough on its own. Also it was a little bland even after I added extra spices. Will make this again :-)

Great recipe! My husband and I loved it. And it was so easy.  I used 3/4 of a can of chicken broth, lawry's seasoned salt, lemon pepper, garlic salt, and pepper.  Left it on low for 11 hours and the chicken just fell off the bones. DELICIOUS!

A great, simple recipe. I followed Diana's instructions and put some big veggies in the bottom instead of tinfoil, also used the Lawry's Seasoning and an onion in the middle. There was so much liquid it was almost like a stew, and the chicken kind of fell apart when I tried to take it out of the pot...Maybe I'll cook it a little less next time. I gave it three stars since I made so many changes to the recipe.

I really didn't expect this to turn out but it was the juiciest and most delicious "baked" chicken I have ever made. Instead of paprika I sprinkled entire chicken with Goya Adobo Seasoning.  Used 2 vidalia onion halves and two wads of foil and even without adding liquid the gravy I made later with the juices was fabulous.

Good recipe but I won't cook it as long next time...a bit too dry.  Also, to add a bit more flavor next time, will put onion in cavity.  Loved the idea of placing chicken on balls of foil.

This couldn't be easier or better!
I put it in as I was running out the door so I cooked on low from 7:00am to 3:30p.m. on low and from 3:30-6:30 on high.  It was a large 8lb. overstuffer roaster.  
I would take the popup timer out to season and then put it back in.  The paprika might make it stick down.

I have got to get me a larger slow cooker!
I only have a small one so I had to use a cut up chicken and even then only three pieces fit. But it was soooo worth it! Since my cooker was so small only areas of the skin were brown and since there really wasn't enough room the chicken wasn't as moist. But that was only because of my cooker not the recipe. Even though set backs the chicken was delicious. I saved the drippings and it really added flavor to those meals! The only thing I did different was to rub the chicken with butter before spicing.

So versatile and yummy. I made a herb butter with rosemary, garlic salt, and paprika and placed it between the skin and the breast of the chicken. Rubbed down the skin with a little more butter and s&p. Cooked it to the directions and it turned out terrific. Be sure to make gravy with the drippings! Just as good as the chicken itself.

This was good and easy but I did make a few changes.  A review stated there wasn't a lot of flavor so I used A LOT of salt, pepper, and garlic powder on a whole chicken cut up.  I also used 3 tablespoons of butter.

The meat did fall off the bone, but I put A LOT of spices inside the skin of the chicken and it was still kind of bland. I even put onions in with the foil underneath and some inside with garlic cloves and it was still pretty bland. Was great for chicken salad after though!

Used chunks of onion instead of the tin foil.  Cooked on high for 6 hours which was maybe 1 hour too much.  Good recipe to use if you can't be home and need the chicken cooked when you get home.  Was brown and yummy.  Thanks, Michele, Cambridge ontario

I have to say I was a bit worried that this chicken would be dry with no liquid added.  I WAS WRONG!!  This was the juciest chicken ever!!  I think next time I would use different spicy but this method is the only way to go with chicken...super tender but still a nice golden crispy skin.

So good and so simple!  My family loves the flavor. I added 1 can chicken stock at the bottom of the crockpot to keep it moist.  I make this dish for my family every other week. Thank you for this recipe!

I really liked the idea of the foil balls to keep the bird from drowning in the grease and juices.  However, I find that we just aren't bid baked chicken fans.  It seems to lose the flavor even when injected.

I don't know if I just left in too long or what, but the chicken pretty much 'fell apart' when it was done cooking. The flavor was good, but my family prefers to be served a piece of chicken rather than a lump of chicken.

Instead of an entire chicken I just used 2 chicken breasts for myself and my boyfriend.  We absolutely loved it!  I used some additional spices as some others have stated, garlic powder and some onion powder. I will Definitely make this again!

I enjoyed this recipe, although I didn't use the tinfoil and my chicken was frozen . Maybe that helped it to be juicier ? Anyway the family liked it thanks ! ;) Sonya

I liked the fact that it was easy and made a massive quantity of food.  However, I found the chicken too mushy.  Not bad if I'm in a crunch but not something I'll plan a dinner party around

This recipe was great! It does need to go under the broiler afterwards to crisp up the skin a bit, though. I left the chicken whole and it turned out fine, I will definitley make again, especially in the summer when I don't want to have the oven on.

Great chicken tasted like rotisserie chicken! I use chicken pieces and placed breast pieces on the bottom and it turned out very moist. I also added lots of seasoned salt and pepper. I will make this again for sure.

I threw a combination of spices on it. Adobo, cajun , thyme,  chicken boulion. It was very flavorful and moist. I've stopped looking for how to cook chicken in the slow cooker. This is it ! So easy and good . . .

Last night I seasoned it using "Lawrys seasoning salt with Paprika", "Lemon Pepper", A little bit of "Mrs Dash" and let it sit over night. I have a oval shapped crockpot, so I used 6 balls of aluminum. The meat was tender and not dry at all,Who would have thought that when i put it in that it was still partially frozen! I put it breast side down in the morning before going to work and By the time I got home The heavenly aroma was wonderful. It does in fact taste like roasterie chicken. Delicious!

My husband ate this chicken up! I cut an orange in half and stuffed it in the chicken cavity before "baking"...it added a nice, subtle flavor. I'll make this again.

This recipe is definitely quick and easy.  The meat was very moist and extremely tender.  In fact, it was so tender I had trouble getting the chicken out of the crock pot.  Other than that, I think it is a great recipe to have on hand; especially when you know you're going to have a hectic day!

I did not really care for this recipe.
The chicken was very bland and did not have much
of a taste.  It was also very greasy even
after removing the skin.  I will not be
serving this dish again.

Easy enough and takes only a few minutes to prepare for the slow cooker but the finished product is rather bland.  Maybe you could add a savory sauce to spice it up...

Great!!! My entire family loved it and it was so simple!! I used a rotisserie rub that I already had on hand (made from this site Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style). Instead of the foil, I put carrots, onion, celery and red potatoes on the bottom of the cooker and added a splash of white wine. I had a split chicken and browned it (skin side) a little bit first on the stove top, then placed the halves on top of the veggies. Cooked for 5 hours on low and it was perfect!  Save the cooking liquid and freeze for stock. Thanks for this recipe!

I followed advice from some of the other reviewers and used a half cup of white wine in the bottom of the crockpot, made a bed of carrots and celery to lay the chicken on, made a paste of herbs, salt and pepper mixed with a little olive oil. I rubbed the paste under the skin and on top and sprinkled with a little extra paprika. The chicken came out wonderful!!! I did an hour on high, then 5 hours on low and it was perfectly cooked, still on the bones but tender.

I added salt, pepper, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp paprika, 1 tsp thyme, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, and 1/4 tsp garlic as well. My only complaint is of course the skin doesn't get crispy which is expected in a slow cooker. But the meat came out so juicy. Fell off the bone trying to lift it up so didn't get the whole bird presentation but that didn't matter to me.

This recipe is a good one. I definitely use the foil balls. I put liberal amounts of salt, pepper and paprika. I usually sprinkle with garlic powder. I put onions in the cavity. Sometimes I put a lemon cut up. Today, I'm trying an orange.  It really doesn't matter, it comes out fantastic.  My only word of caution is you don't need to go 8 to 10 hours.... No, no.  I definitely do the 1 hour on high and then 5 to 6 hours on low - tops.  I've cooked this so many times I've lost count and I've never had the chicken not be cooked. It's always falling off the bone.

Rub butter all over and then sprinkled it generously with salt, pepper, garlic salt, seasoning salt, paprika and poultry seasoning. Stuff with garlic, onions, and herbs.  To have it not fall off bone, put the slow cooker on high for two hours and then turned it on low for 5 hours.

The only minor change I made is after patting the chicken dry,  I rubbed olive oil over the chicken before seasoning. This chicken truly fell off the bone & was moist & delicious!

Used drumsticks and added some chicken broth to the bottom. Also added some more seasonings, which I regretted later. Still need to play with the spices a little. But as far as cooking, it turned out great. I also broiled them for a few minutes before serving to make it a little more crispy.

Excellent dish. The only change I made was putting a 3-4 lb whole chicken on low heat for 7 1/2 hours was perfect.

I was not as impressed with this recipe for slow cooking a whole chicken as some others I've tried. A 5 lbs chicken can cook fully in five hours on low. Any more just dries it out.

Just put butter and spice/herb mixture under the skin.  That way it actually cooks into the meat!  I also stuff the inside with lemons, onions and garlic.

Yes I made it! Yes, it was perfect! And yes... I conceded and made one addition. I added a splash of lemon juice to the bottom of the slow cooker, so that, as it simmered on the foil, the lemony juices would help in flavor. No. I did not put a lot, and I did not smoother the poor bird with it. Just a small amount at the bottom of the pan. VERY TASTY AND LOW-FAT, LOW-SALT, ETC!!!

This is a great way to get tender moist chicken.  To finish it off put under broiler for 10 minutes to brown the skin.  Adding a skim of butter to the chicken make for nice down skin.

I used chicken thighs and seasoned them with a Cajun blend and injected them with Cajun butter. I put a beer butt chicken stand in the crockpot and stuffed the center with garlic, green onions carrots and lemons. Then placed the thighs around the stand. It was amazing!

Sorry, I'm not a fan here.  I made a lot of the modifications that other reviewers suggested and it was not worth the effort, imo.  I rubbed my spices under the skin with some olive oil.  I put potatoes, onions and carrots both beneath the chicken in place of the aluminum foil.  I also put these inside the chicken cavity along with plenty of minced garlic.  I added chicken broth and 3/4 cup red wine and let it go.  About 2 hrs before it was finished, I added more chopped onions and potatoes.  One person suggested adding the extra ingredients about 1 hr before it's done but I had a feeling it would not be cooked enough.  Sure enough, even with 2 hrs, they were only half done.  My biggest regret was not using a cheesecloth or a bunch of string around the chicken, because it totally disintegrated when I went to pull it out.  Bones everywhere.  So after about 20 minutes of fishing out bones, I finally could sit down to enjoy.  It was not worth the wait.  The potatoes, onions and carrots on the bottom were MUSH and those I added at the end were under-cooked.  The sauce was mediocre at best.  The chicken had little flavor.  The smell in the house during day was amazing and I had really high hopes for this.  But I think I expected it to be like a roasted dish with the same results and less fuss.  But it wasn't.  It was a chore to eat the remainder not wanting to waste it.  I continued to enjoy fishing for bones still days later.  Sorry..this one doesn't fly.

I used drumsticks and placed them over a few potatoes, new carrots and an onion.  Rubbed the chicken with poultry seasoning and S&P.  It cooked in 3 hours on high with a little bit of chicken stock in the bottom (optional if you leave the skin on), and was fall off the bone tender! Maybe remove skin before seasoning if you don't plan on eating the skin. The carrots were very soft but the chicken, potatoes and onion were perfect.  :)

I prefer a whole chicken in the oven, but you can not beat this on a week night after you have worked all day.  I love using the foil because the chicken does not sit in the grease while it is cooking.  I strain the grease off and make gravy.  I use the leftovers on sandwiches for lunch. Great recipe if you want a good meal during the work week with little effort.

I use this recipe about once a week. It's just my husband and I at home. I can make this,have baked chicken one night and use the leftovers for something else another night. With our work schedule the cooking time is perfect for us. I sometimes switch up the seasonings but the technique is awesome! Thanks for sharing

I had a 5lb. chicken, I cooked it on high for 2 hours and low for 4 hours. I used rosemary, thyme, and Bells seasoning.  It was the most tender chicken we have ever had. The flavor was great! I love the idea of the tin foil.  I highly recommed this.  Very easy with good results!

I made a 5 pound bird in a 6 1/2 quart slow cooker. Marinated it in orange, tangerine and lemon juice with sliced onions and chopped cilantro. After reading most of the reviews and knowing that the size of the chicken and varying temps of slow cookers I decided to place a probe thermometer in the bird to keep from over cooking it. I did place it on foil balls knowing I didn't want greasy veggies from the rendered fat. Placed the slow cooker on high for the first hour then switched to low. The 5 pound bird took a total of 4 hours and 20 minutes. Although this was OK I think I'll stick with my rotisserie cooker.

I followed the instructions, and it was great! So easy! I am always going to cook chicken this way. It was so tender and juicy, and it fell off of the bones. The cleanup is easier too. Just throw out the foil, and you are left with the yummy juice to make gravy. What a great idea! Thanks!

Very Good!! I can't believe how much liquid the bird releases. When I got home the chicken was boiling in it's own juices. It was very good!

This recipe would get 5 stars if the seasoning was amped up a bit. I have made this twice before and in the same fashion - I follow the recipe but use only Emeril's Chicken rub and a quartered onion stuffed into the cavity- that's it. I feel the chicken would be too bland with just salt and pepper. The meat just wants to fall off the bone. And talk about tender- this recipe with the one modification is a keeper for us.

This recipe is sheer genius. Why didn't I think of doing this?! I started this at noon yesterday, turned it off and went to bed at 11ish, got up this morn and it fell apart (good thing) when I took it out.  Bye, bye all other methods for cooking chicken. Absolutely delish!

A nice & easy way to cook your chicken in the slow cooker without it disintegrating.  I cooked it with a handful of carrots and potatoes.  Next time I need add more.

I also found the chicken to be a little bland even WITH using more seasoning than recommended.  Again: needs more

This was inedible. It didn't even make decent chicken salad. Had to dump out an entire organic chicken. The people who seemed to like this recipe all made substantial modifications. As written, this recipe is terrible.

Pretty good. I made this last night. I actually cooked on high for 5 hours (5lb chicken) seasoned as described but added an onion. I think it might be best to marinate over night. The foil helped some what, I think my bird was too big

This is almost always the way I make chicken now.  It is especially nice in the summer when you don't want your hot oven on!  It tastes great!  The chicken comes out perfect every time- I use the leftovers to make a chicken pot pie or chicken and noodles the next day.  It is so easy with the meat falling right off the bones!

If I could give this recipe no stars, I would.  It was horribly dry and almost inedible.  The only redeeming feature is that I may be able to salvage the rest of the breast meat and add it to a soup which will disguise the awful dryness.  It was cooked for 2 hours at high and 5 at low with 2 cups of broth added.  Perhaps it is my crock pot, but this is the worst recipe that has ever come from it!

This sadly came out really dry.  I even stuffed it with half an onion and had some chicken broth on the bottom.  I really like the technique though so I was sad to see it fail.  Used a 5 pound chicken in an AllClad slowcooker, which I think runs hotter than most slow cookers, but I'm still a little burnt to try it again.

I cooked this exactly as the recipes indicates, but was nervous to not have some extra liquid to steam the chicken so I added about 1/2 cup water.  Family loved it and will make it again except will try cut up veggies as others have tried with success.  Simple, easy and yummy.  Thx.

Used a 3.5 lb chicken, rubbed (under the skin) 1 t paprika, 1/2 t. freshly ground pepper, and a pinch of garlic salt.  Instead of foil, did 2 carrots, 1 large onion chopped into large pieces on the bottom of the crock pot.   Cooked on low for 8 hours.  Pretty easy and tasty!

Awesome recipe and so easy to make! Just prep and walk away.  I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and used potato quarters and baby carrots instead of foil balls and also added 1/4 cup of chicken broth.  (I also stuffed with onion and red bell).  Instead of using regular salt I used garlic salt and the result was spectacular!

Perfect! I did brown the chicken first, which is easier than it sounds, and I used potatoes and carrots on the bottom of the crockpot instead of the foil. I added a half cup of white wine to the bottom of the crockpot. I rubbed the spices under the skin as well as on the outside - I used the "Simply Organic" brand of all-season salt - and stuffed the cavity with onions, celery, and mashed garlic.  Do spoon the juices over the top when you remove the chicken. The breast meat was a little dry - I might try putting it in upside down next time to see if that helps.

Could I rate this a ZERO? I am so disappointed. We had to throw it out. Is there a refund? I used the following: carrots, celery, potatoes, garlic, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and poultry seasoning. Cooked it on low for 9 hours and the results were BLAND!!! No taste, tons of liquid at the bottom (and we did not add any to begin with).

After reading a couple of the reviews I decided to add a couple of more seasonings. Garlic & Onion powder. Plus, inject the bird with the same seasoning on the outside. Cooked on high for 6 hours and it turned out great! Thanks for the idea, never given thought to cooking a whole fryer in the crock-pot. Will definitely use this again!

This was very moist and tender and falling apart (after 1 hour high and 7 hours low). After reading comments, I did use veggies instead of aluminum foil and added some liquid. One question--how do you add salt and pepper "to taste" to a raw chicken? I probably should have added a bit more as the breast meat was a little bland (even though I rubbed some seasonings under the skin) although the dark meat seemed very tasty. Perhaps turning it over at some point would have helped? Willl probably use again.

I tried this recipe using potato, carrots and onion on the bottom of the crock pot instead of the foil, and I poured 1 c chicken broth in the bottom as well. It turned out good, very tender. However, I prefer using a roasting pan in the oven to this crock pot method.  The crock pot method ended up with icky-looking chicken skin, whereas the skin turns out crispy and golden in the oven. Unless you need to use the crock pot for convenience b/c you'll be out of the house, I recommend your oven. The roasting pan in the oven also allows me to include enough veggies for my family of 5.

Hey people, forget those foil balls. Put potatoes IN the foil. Then, aside from a veggie your whole dinner is done. It bakes the potatoe perfectly. You still need to add the liquid. I just pour in a glass of water.

I altered the recipe a bit too. First I added to the crock pot a 1/2 cup chicken broth. I then put cubed potatoe, cubed carrot, cubed turnip & sliced onion. I remofed all the skin from the thawed chicken, rinsed & patted it dry. In a bowl I mixed a little pureed garlic, 2 tablespoons of lemone juice & 1 onion, cubed (I stuffed this in the chicken & tied up the legs) I placed the chicken over the veg's & sprinkled pepper, onion salt & paprika over the chicken. cooked on high for 5 hours. I'll give my alteration a 5 star!!! MMM this is good

I appreciate this recipe; I've made it several times.  With a little pre-planning on the side dishes, you can have dinner on the table in the blink of an eye.  Putting the bird atop tinfoil balls is nothing less than genius.  I've also made this dish by rubbing the bird down in Season All (in lieu of salt, pepper, and paprika), and it's wonderful.  Definitely a stand-by dish in this girl's kitchen.

The tinfoil made the chicken taste like aluminum--surprise--and the chicken was bland. There needs to be a heck of a lot more spices to make this recipe tasty. I reused the recipe and put the chicken on potato chunks, threw in some carrots and onions, and seasoned with garlic, lemon, rosemary, basil, pepper and paprika. MUCH better.

I had a 4.5 pound  turkey, cooked it for 2 hours on high and 3 hours on low, and it was great. It was my first time cooking a whole bird, and I don't have many opportunities to cook one, but I'm sure I'd be using this recipe when I do. Thank you, Cotton!

I made this a couple of weeks ago and will definitely make it again.  I set the chicken on top of onions instead of tin foil, and added carrots and celery.  I also removed the skin before cooking.  It was tender and moist - and best of all, easy!

Very nice chicken!  Was so easy and good that it will definitely become a regular for us.  It was a bit on the dry side after 1 hr on high and about 7 1/2 on low but my slow cooker does seem to cook hot.  I will cook it a bit shorter next time but there will be a next time.

Good chicken! I used a marinade mix that was great for the meat, but I put potatoes on the bottom of the slow cooker and they were flavored far too strongly. We didn't eat the potatoes, but the chicken was amazing! Very moist and tender....I can't wait to use the bones for soup! This recipe to me, is one that you can vary in many different ways, with whatever spices/marinades/sauces you have on hand. I agree with other posters though, you have to have the chicken raised up...it does get pretty greasy in the pot. I might try the tinfoil next time.

I followed DAWN SHAW's advice and used chicken legs instead of the whole chicken cause thats all i had and it only took 4 hours for my chicken to be cooked, not 9. that's my only complaint, cause i wanted it for dinner and not lunch. other than that, it was great.

Wonderful fall off the bone chicken.  I used veggies instead of foil to keep the chicken off the bottom and cooked for about 11 hours and it was falling off the bone when I lifted it out.  I also added 1/2 cup chicken broth to keep everything moist, and added flour at the end to make it a gravy for some spaghetti.  Wonderful!!  :P

I have avoided this recipe for a while, convinced that it would ruin a whole chicken.  Then I looked at the photos and decided to give it a try - I'm glad I did!  I made two whole chickens, and used carrots and celery instead of foil balls.  I also stuffed the cavity with onions and celery and added a splash of wine to the pot.  The pan juices made amazing gravy and I had 6 cups of cooked chicken for my freezer - not bad for a Thursday night!

I skin the chicken before I cook it, and I rub a seasoning mix of my own making all over the outside and inside of the chicken. The meat always turns out nice and juicy.

They made a video of this recipe, so I expected really good things out of it. I was disappointed. The chicken was done, but that's about it. It was exactly like baked chicken: very bland and surprisingly dry for a crock pot recipe. None of the spice flavors came through. Forgettable.

We never thought slow cooker chicken could taste so good.  In place of the foil balls we added potatoes, celery, 1/2 a yellow onion and some baby carrots.  We also added 1/2 cup chicken broth.  We used chicken wings and drumsticks. We seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, paprika and a liberal amount of Emeril's chicken rub.  My 13 year old said this was the best chicken she ever had.  Thanks Cotton Club.

This was utterly ridiculous in how good and easy it was. Just absolutely scrumptious! Cooked for eight hours and made exactly as described. My husband was thrilled! The only difference was I added garlic as one of the spices and used a 4.5 lb chicken. Thank you for a great recipe.

I did't use the foil, instead I used carrots.  The chicken came out tender and juicy.  We used the leftovers to make chicken noodle soup.

First thing I made in my crockpot I received as a wedding gift from my grandmother over a year ago. Wish I had listened to her sooner about how great a crockpot is with a young child!  This turned out wonderfully. I added more spices and cooked it on a bed of potatoes and carrots with some onions. Stuffed onions and bellpeppers in the chicken with some fresh chopped garlic. I might try it as is next time but I don't know because it turned out so great!  My husband and my toddler boy loved this. It was truly wonderful and thanks for sharing!

This just wasn't what I expected it to be. I think it was pretty bland and not even very juicy. I would rather just roast the chicken in the oven even though it's more maintenance.

Turned out moist and tender.  Quite lovely.  Laid it on a layer of baby carrots, and even after cooking all day on low, they were not mushy.  Added a bit of chicken broth and some wine, but next time will leave out the wine.  Yum.

I thought this recipe is perfect the way it is!  The only thing I did different was I didnt add any veggies, potatoes or the foil and I removed the skin off the chicken and browned it on the stove before placing it in a roasting pan added chicken broth for liquid breast up and cooked 2 whole chickens at 350 for about 1.5 hrs and I was able to remove the legs and wings just by twisting them!  6 thumbs up from our house

This chicken is very good! And very tender! that being said, you really need to watch for bone slivers. The crock pot makes everything so tender that the bones seem to break down, we found slivers of bones all over when eating. I added a cups of chicken stock to the crock pot along with a chopped up onion, some garlic powder and salt and peper and let it cook all day long. When I got home I made a gravey from the dripping on the bottom of the crock pot. The gravey really made the chicken!!!! Everyone loved this meal, I will make it again!

I liked the way the chicken turned out for the most part - I only have one major complaint and that is that the chicken meat didn't just peal off the bones - the bones collapsed and now I have to pick out a bunch of chicken bones to have any left overs!

I used potatoes, celery, and onions on the bottom.  The chicken turned out great, but I had to drain a lot of grease from the veggies.  I think next time I'll use the foil method like the original says.  I added several other spices to the chicken and rubbed it under the skin.  The chicken was wonderful!  I will definitely make again!

As suggested, I stuffed it with crushed garlic and a lemon that I had quartered.  First off, how inviting is it to come home at the end of a long day and smell a ready made delicious meal?  It was so moist and delicious... but I have to say, next time I will put lemon, sliced onion and maybe a little garlic under the skin to really get that wonderful zingy flavor throughout the bird.  There was soo much in the way of drippings, you'll have a giant pot of sauce or gravy... Far too much for one meal, even one as good as this.  A true keeper!

I felt this needed more spices than just paprika so next time I will add more and place an onion in the cavity.  I skipped the hour on high and cooked my 3 1/2 lb. chicken on low for 7 hours and it was too done.  It looked like it may have been done in 5 1/2.

The chicken was a little drier than I expected. I cooked it 8 hours, and I think that's too much. I was also pretty surprised to open up the lid after I'd been gone all day to see the pot filled with grease.   I put the potatoes, onions, and carrots in the bottom like others said, and they were very good.

Sorry but I cannot give this recipe a 5 star rating.  I used a 3 lb whole chicken and took the skin off (suggestion on another member)and found that after 6 hours the chicken was very dry.  I would cut the time almost in half and keep the skin on next time to keep the chicken moist.  I was very disappointed in this recipe

Placed a quartered onion inside the chicken and cooked atop cubed potatoes and carrots.  Great easy recipe which fills the house with fantastic smell.

Yummy. Out of fairness, I rated this four stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I substituted foil with onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and potatoes. I seasoned the veggies with salt, pepper, powdered garlic, paprika, and olive oil. I used 5 chicken legs because my crock pot is too small for a whole chicken. I seasoned the drumsticks on top of the skin and underneath the skin with the same spices I used for the veggies (minus olive oil). I broiled the drumsticks for 4 min. on each side because I wanted to brown the skin. The leftover meat is great for chicken soup.

I cooked a 6.5 lb chicken for the suggested amount of time, and it was way overdone.  I would suggest a shorter cooking time, especially for smaller birds.

This is so easy and so delicious! We love garlic so I added 6 whole garlic cloves and a quartered onion to the cavity for extra flavor. I cooked it on low all day while at work, about 11 hours, and it turned out perfect. It wasn't overcooked and fell off the bone. This is my favorite way to cook whole chicken, thanks for the recipe!

I thought that this recipe would have been good with as many reviews as it got. But mine didn't turn out very well. I cooked a 4lb chicken on low for an hour then on high for about 6 hours. It was cooked too long and literally falling apart. Even though I added broth and foil, the chicken was dry with a weird dry texture. I seasoned mine with salt, pepper and some all purpose seasoning but it wasn't quite enough flavor.

If you like to eat meat+side_of_potatoes+side_of_veggie type meals this might be to your taste, but I didn't much care for it. The texture was fine - not too dry, but not falling off the bone (I cooked a 4 lb whole chicken for 1 hour on high and then 7 hours on low). Taste was rather boring, even though I added some quartered onions and crushed garlic cloves to the cavity; added about 1/2 a cup of white wine to the bottom of the crock (I used halved potatoes instead of balls of aluminum foil); and seasoned under the skin with paprika, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and poultry seasoning. It was still just "eh" - if I got this in a restaurant I would be disappointed. It was very easy, though, and I plan on using the remaining meat for another recipe, so I don't think it was totally wasted.

My chicken was not dry at all. I put 2 small lemons that I pierced with a fork a couple of times, and add lemon pepper and other spice I liked inside and rubber spice under skin. Tide the legs and seal both ends of chicken with tooth picks. I also but a cup of chicken broth in cooker. The aluminum foil balls where great they held the chicken out of the grease. My chicken was really moist. I cooked it for 2 hours on high and 5 hours on low, but I am sure that on low for 8hrs would have worked just fine. I also put the stoneware with chiken in the oven on broil for a minute or two to make skin crispy!! yummm!!! Will make again.

I've made a whole chicken in the slow cooker before, but couldn't remember how long to do it, so decided to go by this recipe because of the good reviews.  The time is WAY off. I had a 4.5 lb chicken, put it on low (did not start on high b/c I just knew that would be too long) & it was overcooked when I check it at 7 hours.  Also, needs more spices.  Sorry, just not a good recipe.

I never thought to put a whole chicken in the slow cooker. We were snowed in today so I thought I would try it. I liked the idea of previous users of putting some chicken broth in but we didn't have any so we used beef broth. I put about a cup in with diced celery, potatoes, and onion strips. I also added salt, pepper, garlic salt, and poultry magic into the cooker. I rubbed butter and seasoning all over the chicken as well as stuffing the inside with some of the veggies. I turned it once while cooking. Cooked it on high for 5 hours and it was so delicious! The chicken fell right off the bone and the vegetables were amazing! Great recipe for a winter day!

I seasoned it with garlic powder, parsley and a couple of tablespoons of honey and it was delicious! BUT, I'm glad I was watching it, as it was falling off the bone and done by 2 hours on high and 1 1/2 hours on low! (I used a 4.8lb chicken)

Great recipe idea! Thanks!

Fall off the bone tender. Great and easy recipe for weekday meal. Some say it's bland - I say add any seasoning you want. The recipe is a good base recipe that anyone can modify to suit their tastes. 

If you want to present a nice-looking, whole chicken at the dinner table, though, you might want to find another recipe. With care, however, you can remove it piece by piece...breast, wings, thighs, legs. Getting it out whole without falling apart is something I have yet been able to do.

The chicken was fall off the bone but it didn't have a lot of flavor.  I'll need to do something to give it a little more taste.

Loved it!  I did make a few changes, poured some chicken broth in the bottom and added lots of onions!  I have made it several times and look forward to it every time!

I think this chicken tasted okay as-is, and I'm sure it could be better after experimenting with different seasonings.  Otherwise, its just a convenient way to cook a moist chicken (if you don't mind not having the crispy skin) -- nothing more, nothing less.

This is a good basic recipe.  Family loved it "as is", but the seasoning possibilities are endless.  Enjoy!

So good and so easy! I used carrots intead of foil, but next time I will use celery, as I didn't like the carrot flavored that the gravy had that I made afterwards :) This chicken was so moist and delicious. I don't think I'll ever make chicken in the oven again! Left overs are great for the Holiday Chicken Salad Recipe from this site.

This recipe is easy and tastes great. I had about a 4lb chicken and 10 hrs was too long. The chicken turned out dry. I made it a second time & cooked it about 8 hrs-much better!

I rated this recipe a 5 for the simplicity and the technique. The foil at the bottom of the chicken was brilliant and the chicken cooked perfectly. I will definately make again but next time I will add some chopped onion and garlic and maybe even some celery and potatoes.

I made this a couple of times.  First I followed other people's ideas, filling cavity with onion, lining crock with carrot, celery, onion, adding some stock. This gave me chicken stew and was not wonderful at all.

Second time I followed the directions and ended up with a yummy chicken, perfectly tender.  Very easy, I'll make it again.

VERY TASTY but... Timing is off like another reveiwer stated. I used a roaster b/c a 3lb chicken is not feeding a family of 5. The chicken was done by 6 hours possibly before but that's when I came home. The foil balls didn't serve it's purpose b/c my chicken was cooking in it's own fat juice plus I added 1/4 cup red wine vinegar. My son (18) who never compliments says that it was "mad good" and rest of family thought it was delicious also. Skin did not crisp so I just pulled it off and through out, tasted funky fatty. Very tempted to brown it by broiling but took the easy way out.

This came out so moist and delicious!  I removed the skin before cooking.  I don't think the aluminum foil balls are necessary - mine kept sliding off anyway...and I'm thinking maybe that's why it was so moist.  I will definitely make again - SO EASY!!!  I paired this with roasted pumpkin, sweet potatoes, eggplant, and whole garlic cloves (baked with olive oil, salt, pepper, and rosemary.

This recipe was excellent. I had never cooked a whole chicken before. Instead of tin foil, I cut large carrots into thirds and put on the bottom of the crock pot, under the chicken. My teenage kids LOVED this chicken. In fact, they fought over who was having the leftovers. I'm off to the store to buy another chicken to make for tomorrow.

Great way to roast a whole chicken without fuss.  Meat just falls off the bone which also makes this a great way to cook a chicken if you plan on making a soup or storing meat for recipes.  The chicken is so moist and tender and you can really add any seasoning you like.

Added veggies as some of the other reviewers, some of which were more cooked than others but still tasty.  The chicken itself was somewhat dry.  The house smelled delicious though!

This recipe was good.  I followed the other reviewers suggestions.  I had a hard time taking it out of the slow cooker because it fell off the bone.  I was able to get three meals out of it and there was hardly any work.

This is a great and easy recipe!  I added Chicken seasoning and a can of cream of chicken soup.  The soup helped keep it moist and it came out very tender.  I would add garlic next time.

This was absolutely delicious - moist and flavorful.  I personally did not like all the grease/fat from the skin so next time I will try it without the skin (risking moisture I'm sure).  I pulled up the skin and seasoned the meat then covered it back with the skin.  Also did potatoes, carrots and onions like everyone else.  DELICIOUS!

This chicken was super easy and awesome.  I didn't use the foil ball, but instead put carrots, potatoes, and quartered onions in the bottom of the pot.  I rubbed the chicken generously with paprika, garlic powder, lemon pepper, and salt.  I cooked it on high for 1 hour and low for 7 hours, and it was terrific.  I added cornstarch to the drippings and had some awesome gravy to go with it.  The gravy was super over rice cooked in chicken broth.  The best thing about this recipe is how easy it was to have a whole baked chicken...almost no prep.  Thanks for the great dinner idea.

Four stars because I made some deviations from the original recipe, but with the changes, an absolute five star!!!  
I read up before making this and made a couple of simple additions.  I brined my chicken (4 1/2 lb) for three hours the night before and let it air dry in the fridge overnight.  
Before cooking I put four pats of butter (1 tbsp each) under the skin on the breats, and seasoned freely with Seasoning Salt, thyme & garlic powder.
I also quartered some red potatoes and chopped up an onion and threw it in before cooking.
I put it on high for an hour as called for, and then let it cook on low for another 10 hours.  
It is fall off the bone wonderful, juicy and tender.  The ease of the recipe is what makes it a true keeper!  My husband isn't a fan of whole chicken, and he said it's hands down one of the best things I've made off on allrecipes.com.  Yay!

Very good and easy. I used quarter chicken pieces and seasoned them with TS Salt for All Seasons. I added about 1/4 of red wine and a little chicken broth and placed potato chunks at the bottom of the crock pot. Husband, 5 and 10 year olds loved it. 4 legs, 4 thighs, no leftovers.

This is quite tasty. If you don't like dark meat chicken you can alter it to use only bone-in chicken breasts. Delicious and very tender.

I would rate this a 3.5.  The "Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style" recipe on this website gives a more presentable chicken.  I tried to take the slow cooker chicken out of the crock pot and put it on a serving dish but it fell apart...I'm glad I didn't have company for dinner.  It was really moist and tasty but didn't look like the picture.  Also, the skin was soggy if you want a crisp skin, try the other recipe.  I will make this again if I plan to use the leftovers for soup, casseroles, etc. but don't use this if you are trying to impress anyone.

This chicken was very moist, in fact, it fell apart while I was trying to get it out of the slow cooker.  It definately needs more seasoning and it's important to put it breast side down.  You can't beat how easy it is!

I wanted to cook a chicken and have it be fall off the bone tender so I could use the meat for recipes that call for already cooked chicken. This was the perfect recipe for that. I didn't bother rinsing the chicken or adding any spices to it just used the aluminum balls and cooked it overnight. Then this morning I pulled it out and put in a plastic bag in the fridge. When I get home from work this evening I will pull through the meat and discard skin and save the carcass for making chicken stock overnight in the slow cooker. What an easy preparation of a whole chicken. I will be using this recipe often because whole chickens are so inexpensive.

Delicious!  Like most other reviewers, I changed things a tad.  I got this ready the night before in my crock pot, didn't use foil but rather whole potatoes & carrots on the bottom, then the chicken, then cut onions.  I cut the skin on the chicken, then seasoned it with butter, & a variety of seasonings and also put chicken broth in there.  In the AM I turned it on low for 1 hour, then high for the remainder.  It was delicious!!!  However, it did fall apart as soon as we put in on the plate - but I love it when meat is so tender it falls apart!

I've used this recipe many times & the chicken has always been moist & tender. I brush with olive oil first then sprinkle with whatever spices I have on hand. Chicken often falls apart, but that's ok. It still tastes great! I always cut up the leftovers to make soup or chicken tetrazzini the  next day.

This was just alright for us. It was a little bland for my taste. The only changes I made to the recipe was stuffing the chicken with an onion. Next time I'll remove the skin and put the seasoning right on the meat, since mine had little to no flavor.

This was very good. I Added garlic salt, crushed Corriandor, sage, and a little bit of garlic inside the bird. I also put butter in the bird and under its skin aswell. It was so tender it fell right off the bone. I cooked it on high for 6 hours in my croc pot.

This was perfect!  I followed the directions exactly and I got a perfectly moist and flavorful chicken. The skin even got a little crispy. This is such an easy thing to make and tastes great. Next time I will season it with a few other things and put some carrots and onions inside.

The chicken was pretty moist, but it seemed like the breast meat was a little bit dry. I cooked it exactly as the recipe is written, and it really didn't have any flavor. I will definitely do some kind of rub or flavor injector next time. It gets 3 stars for the cooking method, though.

The chicken was great, but any lightly seasoned meat that is cooked in the slow cooker is going to taste good. There made no difference whatsoever with putting tin foil at the bottom. My advice, if your making a whole chicken in the slow cooker, use your favorite seasonings and or sauce and it will turn out great!

SUCCULENT!
The best side benefit of this dish is the chicken juice that dripped after the chicken was cooked. It's almost the essence of the chicken! Very nutritious!!

I used a 5 pound chicken and seasoned with garlic salt, pepper and paprika. I also added a can of chiken broth to the slow cooker, so i could have more drippings for gravy. I cooked on high for about 1.5 hours then turned down to low for 6 hours. I had a hard time taking the chicken out, it fell apart completely. The white meat was dry. I will make this again, just pay more attention to how long it cooks and maybe stuff the chicken cavity with some onion and lemon to add more flavor.

I tried this recipe except I put potatoes in as well.  I cooked a 6 pound chicken and used garlic salt and lemon pepper.  The chicken cooked for nine hours on low heat and it was way overdone.  It fell apart and it was really dry.  If I cook a whole chicken in the crock pot again I will cut it up and not cook it as long.

This is great, I never would have thought to make a roast chicken in a crockpot. I elevated it with foil balls as suggested and that really works. I coated the chicken with minced garlic and Tunnel BBQ Spice (from the restaraunt in Windsor Ont) for spices and it turned out wonderful. I followed other suggestions and put the chicken under the broiler briefly before carving to crisp the skin.

Excellent chicken!  After reading other reviews, I added a lot more spices (montreal seasoning and garlic).  The chicken was moist and delicious!  The only problem was that it fell apart when I was trying to get it out of the crock pot.  YUM!

This was a pretty great recipe. Super simple and quick to put together, very versitile in that anything can be thrown in to add to the dish. I made this with potatoes, cellery, carrot, onion, and garlic. I will definitely make this again.

I thought the chicken was dry and it was well done about 8 hours.  I would recommend a roaster and not a fryer.  I will try this again.

This recipe was so easy, and tasted great!  I don't think I've had a more moist chicken.  I did add potatoes, carrots, and onion instead of aluminum balls, and let the chicken cook all day on low.  Very easy, and dinner was ready when I got home!

I liked the idea of this better than the actual results.Like most said the chicken was bland,i did not use the tin foil method instead i used carrots and cut red potato's on the bottom.I salted them and used about a 1/2 of a cup of chicken broth.I seasoned the chicken itself with salt,garlic powder,pepper and spice club chicken seasonings with grinder and stuffed the chicken's cavity with 1 onion 2 stalks of celery and 3 garlic cloves.Like another reviewer  mentioned i ended up with boiled chicken,however the chicken was extremely tender and literally fell apart when touched.I hated the vegetables i think the potato's ended up tasting like pot roast but without the roast.Since the chicken was bland and since i had an overwhelming amount of juice i decided to drain it and make gravy.The gravy was probably the best part of the meal and it added the extra flavor to the chicken that it needed.I did not care for this at all my mother however said that the way this chicken was cooked it would probably taste great with some spicy rice.I won't willingly make this again unless asked too and if i do i will use the tin foil method and omit the chicken broth all together and i will make the veggies on the side.

Loved it!  I did make 2 changes according to some other reviewers suggestions. 1) I put quartered potatoes, onions and baby carrots into the bottom of the crock pot, not foil. 2) I added garlic/herb seasoning to the salt and paprika and rubbed it under the skin where possible. Delicious!! Falling off the bone. The skin slides right off after cooking. Flavorful and tender. We'll make this again-- frequently!

I used a 4 lb. fryer squeezed into my 2 and a half quart slow cooker. Added onions and garlic to the inside of the chicken, put baby carrots on the bottom. Lathered the chicken with butter and salt, pepper, paprika and oregano. Added one cup of chicken broth. Had it high for 4 hours. Luckily kept an eye on it because broth was boiling to the top and I had to ladle out half a cup. I still put it in 350 oven for 20 minutes for a browned look. Definitely tender and juicy!

Absolutely wonderful, and so easy. I can work all day and still have my boyfriend for a wonderful meal! The chicken seems to brown, and has lots of it's own flavor...thank you!  I have passed this one on to all my friends, and they appreciate it too.

great recipe for easy easy bbq chicken sandwiches.  very tender. just pull the chicken off the bone and add storebought sauce, mix up in a big bowl and you'll have bbq chicken sandwiches for days. 
(careful the chicken doesn't get dry...i usually leave mine on low for 9-10 hours, instead of one hour on high)

My fiancee and my boys didn't like this chicken that much...but hey, who cares?  I loved it!  It's great to cook all day and use in other recipes.  What an easy and cheap way to have deliciously cooked chicken in the fridge.  You can use it for anything:  chiken pot pie, enchiladas, BBQ sandwiches.  I rubbed paprika, garlic, and salt under the skin to make sure more of the flavor was getting into the chicken.  Thanks for the easy recipe!

I followed some other reviewers' advice and de-skinned the chicken. That was the most difficult part. Then I added some vegetables instead of the tinfoil. It turned out wonderful. I'll make it again, though I might get a little more creative with the seasoning.

A good way to bake a whole chicken without having to have the oven on for several hours - especially handy if you need to leave and run a few errands. I took the advice of some other reviewers and stuffed the cavity with chopped onions and garlic and rubbed on additional seasonings (Mrs. Dash, garlic salt, onion powder..)

Very moist and flavorful chicken (with tweaking). I cleaned and prepped the chicken the night before. Put a chicken rub on the outside of the chicken, and sprinkled additional rub in the cavity. Put 1/2 onion inside cavity, and put sliced carrot, celery, red skinned potatoes, and onion around chicken in crock pot. Filled bottom with ~1/2 cup chicken broth (no aluminum foil), and cooked on low for 8-9 hours. It was moist and delicious when I returned from work. Thank you for a good and easy meal!

Wonderful, I needed this recipe. So easy I love it.
I did squeeze a lemon over top, added garlic powder and a 1/2 onion cut up in big chunks. Also I put a lot more S&P and Paprika then called for.  Thank you for this recipe.

Yummmmmmy!!  Even with the idiot factor as I forgot to plug my cooker in first thing, so the chicken was cooked on high for approx 5 hours (husband forgot to turn it down to low after a couple of hours).  Did not use the paprika but another spice blend I had on hand.  Chicken is falling of the bone and very tasty!

I used potatoes and onions instead of foil, but other than that I followed the recipe.  After 8 hours my chicken was far too dry, but tasted good.  I'll will try 6 hours next time.

The chicken was awesome, It came out nice and juicy. The only thing I had a hard time with, was trying to get the chicken out of the slow cooker. It was falling apart. I liked it. The one thing i also did, that the recipe did not do, was i roasted a head of garlic, and a small red onion, while the chicken was roasting. It came out nice, it was also semi soaked with the juices from the chicken. Still everything was tasty. I made it along side a recipe of stuffed zuchinni. It was a delicious meal. I am rating it a 4 because if the chicken was ableto stay more intack, i would have given a 5.

What is better than coming home to such a delicious dish?  I think the chicken was flavorful and fairly moist.  It should get 10 stars for how easy it was to prepare.

This was aan easy fantastic dinner.  I did as others suggested and put potatoes on the bottom.  Also, added onions and celery in the cavity.  I sprayed Wish Bone Italian Vinaigrette Salad Spritzer on it at the beginning and at least three times during cooking.  I do think I cooked it too long because it fell right off the bones.  Of course, didn't bother us any it was delicious.  Thanks.

Great way to cook a whole chicken! I seasoned mine with a stalk of celery, small onion quarted and some seasoned salt in the cavity. Sprinkled the outside with more seasoned salt and some dehydrated vegetable flakes.
Cooked it on the foil. Delicious! Plus I got 2 cups of wonderful chicken stock from the drippings.

My family LOVED this recipe. It is so easy, took no time to prepare, I cooked it for 9 hours on low and it fell off the bone! It was incredibly moist and a keeper for sure! I used garlic powder in addition and didn't use paprika because I was out of it. Instead of rolling up the aluminum foil, I put small red potatoes on the bottom. DELICIOUS, thanks!!

I followed the recipe as well as added a bit more paprika & rubbed garlic butter under skin and along the outside and sat it on top of sliced onion but it still came out pretty bland. It definitely was tender but lacked any real flavor. It tasted as if I had put nothing on it! I was disappointed, it smelled so much better than it tasted! I won't be making this again.

Excellent! The chicken fell off the bone and was very tasty. I used Lawry's Seasoning salt and Paprika on a 5 pound chicken and cooked for about 11 hours. So easy and tasted better than a store bought rotisserie!

It doesn't get any easier than this. I did use garlic salt and added 3/4 cup chicken broth. Probably didn't need to add the broth. The chicken legs and wings fell of the chicken - very moist and tender. The whole family loved and I will make again.

I love this chicken recipe!!    I use  alot of seasoned salt over and under the skin. It gives it great flavor and a nice color.  Then I put a quartered onion inside.  How could it be easier??  Delish!!

I don't know what I did differently, but this chicken was so incredibly bland that I just couldn't stand it.  I followed suggestions and placed a chopped onion and minced garlic in the cavity, and I spiced the heck out of it with rotisserie chicken seasoning (which is the BEST, try it) but the chicken still came out horribly bland.  Sure it was moist and smelled great, but the taste is more important in my book.

Easy, Juicy and delicious. The only change I will make is to try different seasonings to zest up the flavor. I'll definitely make chicken this way from now on. Juicy! And soooo easy!!

This chicken was very tender and moist---I love the idea of propping it up on tin foil!  There was no metal taste, either.  This would be good for an alternate way of preparing chicken for other recipes.  Thank you!

Just made this last night since my boys LOVE Rotisserie Chicken.  Used a 4 lb cx and did the 1st hour on High then an additional 8 hours on low. Turned out great, although it fell apart when lifting out of the crockpot.  Made a big mess and didn't look to appealing...But, the family gobbled it up.  Nice and quick.!

I really really wanted to like this recipe.  It did fall apart to the touch, but that was probably the only nice thing about it.  It had zero flavor and was pretty dry.  I knew that it might be lacking in flavor, so I threw a couple cloves of crushed garlic, a sprig of thyme and one of rosemary, but to no avail.

So easy!  So tasty!  Since I was at work while it cooked, I did switched the cooking time--the first 8 hours on low, then when I got home I switched it to high for the last 1 hour.  Still turned out great.

I was skeptical of this one, but it was fantastic! It turned out Perfect. I was afraid of an aluminum taste, but there was none. As long as the slow cooker is big enough so that the chicken doesn't touch the sides, it will turn out delicious and moist. I will Definately use this again and again.

This is a very basic recipe and could be modified to fit any taste.  I liked that it could be done in the crockpot, it was very easy with little clean up!  I did find, however, that the chicken was dry, so I will probably cook it an hour less or so, next time.  I will also probably add some spices to perk up the chicken a little.

Excellent! I also added a few extra ingredients like garlic powder on the chicken and chunks of onion and celery stalks inside the bird. It was deliciously moist and what was left on the bones made for great chicken soup!

I put onions on the bottom of the crock pot along with the foil.  I stuffed the cavity with a sliced carrot and a sliced apple.  I made a butter paste out of a chopped clove of garlic, Jane's Crazy Mixed-Up salt and Herbs D'Provence and two tablespoons of butter.  I put some under the skin of the chicken breast and spread the rest on the outside of the chicken. I cooked the chicken for 2 hours on high and 3 hours on low.  It was very good, tender and my husband loved it.  I will make it again.

I rated this chicken with 3 stars only because we found it very dry; the dark meat was okay, but the breasts were not.  I cooked this chicken for 11.5 hours on low - so the fact that the meat was dry may have been my fault.  I will probably try to make this again, and reduce the amount of cooking time (or use a larger chicken).  On the plus side, I envisioned a greasy skinned chicken when it came time to eat, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that the skin was quite dry (not browned though) and that all the grease had fallen to the bottom of the slow cooker (thanks to the tin foil).  All in all, not bad, but don't overcook it :)

AWESOME recipe!!!  My husband said he could eat this every day!  We watch our carbs, so this was perfect for that!  I used a little lemon juice and minced garlic instead of the paprika (not a fan), and this was tasty!  You can experiment with any spices really!

I was really excited about this one, but it didn't turn out for me.  The skin didn't brown and it wasn't significantly better than stewed chicken (where you'd also get broth).  Sorry guys -- baked chicken is better.

This was a very yummy recipe. The chicken was so tender! I did however find I did not have to cook it for the full 10 hrs. on low. I found that the 8 hrs was sufficient.  I also used a cut up chicken.

It was so easy. I made this for a church dinner and everyone loved it. I did alter the recipe by using a chicken that was already cut up and instead of just salting and peppering the chicken I used Emirls essence instead. It was juicy and had a wonderful aroma and flavor.

I would have rated this recipe a 3, but my husband gave it a 1.  It smelled great, but was overcooked even after 5 hours on low. 4.69 lb chicken. We will try it again baking it like someone suggested.

The idea is great, the chicken...isn't. It was pretty good, although bit on the dry side (my fault, no auto shut-off on cooker, and lost track of time). Overall I thought it had very little flavor.

Someone mentioned removing the skin and then rubbing in the spices. I think I will try this next time. All of the flavor came off with the skin. I did rub in some garlic and I placed an onion in the cavity and on top of bird. Still, flavor was bland. Oh, and I used a 4 lb bird.


Now to find a recipe for the leftovers...

Thought this turned out Great!  Tender and not greasy.  A great "different"  crock pot recipe, (no cream of mushroom soup!)  I love using the leftovers the best, if there are any!  I wanted to add, this is a great "starter."  Many ways that you could expand on this one, as you can see by the reviews!  THANK YOU for submitting!

Excellent! It tasted like rotisserie chicken.  I followed the recipie exactly except I added more seasoning.  I used Emeril's essence.

I love this recipe!  I make this about once a week.  It couldn't be any easier or versatile.  I put the chicken in whole and season it well.  The leftovers are perfect for chicken salad.

This was SO good, and it smelled wonderful while it cooked! I, too, used a whole chicken, and I actually forgot to put it breast side down. It turned out moist and juicy anyway, and the juice made the BEST gravy for mashed potatoes! Thanks for this easy, tasty recipe!

Yes, this tastes just like rotiserie chicken.  I also cut the chicken up.  I was worried that it would be too dry, but it came out awesome.  Sooo easy!

I made this recipe again tonight but instead of chicken I used a Turkey breast.  This was awsome.  skin was crispy and meat was moist.  I am not a turkey lover but this was better that the chicken.  My daughter who doesnt like anything even loved this one.

This is THE BEST chicken recipe!!  My husband and twelve year old daughter thought it was the best chicken I ever made!  I used a generous amount of Lawry's seasoning salt, paprika and pepper.  I may add some oregano and parsley next time.  Very easy and delicious chicken!

I liked that the recipe was very quick and easy, and it smelled delicious cooking. However, it was somewhat dry.  I will try this recipe again because of it's simplicity, with a few changes.

YUMMY!!!  I used a whole chicken, breast side down. Stuffed with a lemon, seasoned with lemon pepper, Lawrys season salt and McCormick roasted garlic chicken season. I was VERY heavy handed with the seasoning. It is so tender and juicy. It is better than our deli!!  Thanks!

WOW - The BEST chicken I have ever made in the crock pot! It took 5 min to prepare. I used generic seasoning salt as suggested in another review.  Forget about buying an expensive rotesserie oven -this is just as good.  The skin was crisp but the inside was tender. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I used skinless chicken breast and added lemon pepper. It had good flavor but a little dry. Next time I will use a whole chicken. Gave recipe to a friend and they loved it. (they used a whole chicken)

Wonderful chicken! Took the advice of another review and used Lawry's Seasoning instead of paprika.  Even my picky toddler had extra helpings.

All I have to say is WOW!!!!.  I was a little skeptical at first with there being no water added, but I used Bell's Seasoning and Lawry's Seasoning Salt and I stuffed the bird with a lemon.  I didn't even have to use a knife...Everything fell off the bone....It had a GREAT flavor and was a HUGE hit with company.

I loved this recipe. I did not use the foil because I have a small pot and we take the skin off before eating anyway. I put the chicken in whole, breast side down, after seasoning it. It is so moist and delicious.  It cooked beautifully and was wonderful to come home to!

I have made this before with Chicken breast, and it wasn't as good as it was with the whole chicken!  My Hubby couldn't believe I made it.  It looked beautiful, and was soooooooo moist!  I have another chicken in the freezer and can't wait to use it the same way!  My Mother couldn't believe it was made in the Crock pot either ! DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!

Pretty good.  I threw on some garlic powder and it sure smelled good when I came home from work.  My daughter loved the drumstick and the leftovers made a great chicken noodle soup.  The tinfoil at the bottom of the crock pot was real helpful to cut down on the grease!  Will make this again!

Kids loved it. Very easy to make, and the idea of keeping it on the foil (and out of the greasy drippings) lent it a rotisserie-cooked look and taste. (We kept the bird whole, not cut into pieces.) Does need additional spices. LOTS of additional spices. On the plus side, you can do a lot of experimenting with various spices without "messing up" the taste!

Very moist & juicy - including the breast meat.  I left the chicken whole - and it was super.  I used a liberal amount of Johnny's Pork & Chicken seasoning inside and out, plus a lot of paprika to give it color.  I had planned on using the leftover for chicken salad the next day - but what leftovers!  My family gobbled it all up!

I loved how the meat just fell off the bone!!  Just one thing though, there was hardly any flavor to the chicken.  I must not have put enough seasoning.

My entire family loved this recipe. The chicken was very tender and moist, the meat fell right off the bone just as others have said. I was pleased with the natural chicken flavor that came through. I did not feel the need to over flavor with spices. Will make this one again and again!

Although my family ate this up, the breasts were slightly on the dry side--I left it in at just 8 hrs--it was still excellent!

This was a great recipe.  I added celery, carrots and onions to mine while it cooked.  The meat was so moist it fell off the bone when I took it out of the crockpot.

This recipe worked well, but the texture and flavor were lacking.  Maybe with more seasoning and a few minutes under the broiler.

I don't know why no one has ever thought of this before.  Just sprinkle on spices, set the crockpot and go.  My family LOVED this.  My father now bugs my mother to make this for him every week!  Great recipe.

I started it before i went to work and came home to a delicious chicken.  The meat was so tender it fell off the bone.  It's now become a regular weekday meal for us.

This is the first time I have ever cooked a whole chicken. I loved how tender the meat was and it fell off the bone.

Some changes I made that I enjoyed: Stuffed the chicken with half an onion, sever cloves of garlic and some celery. I also stuffed some butter under the skin. I used red potatoes on the bottom instead of foil.

Some changes I would make next time: I would probably cook it on low for 6-8 hours next time, not 10. Slow cooking for 10 caused the entire chicken to fall apart and it made serving it a little challenging. If you cook for 10 hours don’t plan on taking it out of the slow cooker and presenting it on a tray.

I made this last night and it was delicious!  I could only find a 6.25 lb chicken!  Started it at high for one hour, then low for 6 hours.  It was a little bit dry but nothing to complain about!  My family loved it! I used the tin foil balls, but the bird in a bag on top of them, breast down, with a little olive oil, rosemary, salt and pepper under and over the skin.  I also slid large onion slices under the skin and in the cavity.  The fit was a bit snug but I think the only thing I would change is less cooking time.  Thanks for a great idea, Cotton!

I followed other reviewers.  I seasoned and broiled the chicken legs for color.  Then placed potatoes, carrots, onion and corn on the cob,  there were seasoned with garlic powder,  onion powder,  thyme,  basil, paprika, salt and pepper,  into the bottom of the crockpot.  I placed the chicken on top and added 1/2 cup chicken broth. Came out delicious!

Came out delicious and tender. The only reason for the 4 stars is that  I took advice from other reviews and added extra spices & veggies and added less broth. So I didn’t follow as directed.  .I also browned the chicken before placing it in the crock pot.. This is  a basic recipe that you can change to your taste.. will make it again! It’s a family favorite!

I seasoned the chicken with butter all over. I also put butter under the skin by the breast. I seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt, pepper, Italian season, garlic powder and paprika on the outside, inside and under the skin. I also put a half of an onion in the cavity. I poured chicken broth in the bottom of the crock pot and cooked for 10 hours. The chicken was very moist and tasty.

This has potential, but is seriously lacking as written. The length of Cook time is way to long. It was “falling off the bone” but because it was so over cooked. I would start at 1 hour high and start checking at around 4 hours of low after. Even that could be too long, I haven’t tried tweaking this recipe. It lacked in flavor as all the seasoning is only on the skin. I did like cooking it on tinfoil as I’m sure that made the skin crispier than not; but I would not call this crispy skin overall. I will try again tweaking it, but it looks much greater than tastes unfortunately.

I admit I have NOT made this yet.  HOWEVER, after reading some of the bad reviews and some good ones.  I have an idea that MAY help the blandness situation AND legs touching the walls of your crock(provided that the crock is large enough).  I would separate the skin from the meat and slather in herbed butter, if you're going to stuff the bird with anything - place some butter in FIRST - which should be against the "back" of the chicken, THEN, stuff it with whatever veggies you are stuffing with.  Next, tie off those legs - as in tie them together - closing the cavity.  You may want to wad up more foil and place it between the sides of the bird that may be touching the walls of the slow cooker.  Once you've prepped the bottom of your crock - FLIP THE CHICKEN UPSIDE DOWN - this will allow the juices to drip down onto/into the breast meat and help to flavor it.  Once you have your chicken in the crock - I'd add some chicken broth/stock to the bottom - so as not to dry out your bird.   I don't see how the chicken would brown in a crock.  But, if I wasn't using my electric roaster or oven for anything else - I'd be using those and NOT the slow cooker for it.

I love this idea, and loved using the foil balls to prevent sogginess.  Tender and fall of the bone, juicy, love the leftovers!  As always, I use the recipe only as a guide and use the seasonings to my liking and always stuff the cavity with onions, garlic and seasonings.  I will definitely do this gain!

Except for adding 4 cloves of chopped garlic I followed the recipe. My boyfriend, household food critic, said it lacked flavor. He also said it was cooked WAY too long.  It fell off the bone and turned to mush in his mouth. IF I use this recipe again I would not cook it for the 1 hour on high and 10 hours on low. I would also use some spices.

First time I've ever made a whole chicken in a crockpot. It turned out really good! I gave it a 4 star only because I had to leave mine for 10 hours and it did get a little mushy. Not the recipe's fault, but I don't know what it would be like after the minimum recommended time of 8 hours. I will definitely be making this again though. SUPER easy!!!! Doesn't get much easier than this. Made some roasted mini variety potatoes and carrots as a side dish. My family of 6 devoured it all. No leftovers.

I used vegetables as the base instead of aluminum foil. I also added some chicken stock and water and seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder, chili powder and Old Bay. I have to admit it wasn't pretty coming out of the crock pot in bits and pieces but this was the most delicious and moist chicken ever! Note for next time, 2 cups of liquid is enough, 4 almost overflowed as the juices from the chicken came out.

Love this recipe! Very easy and tastes delicious. I may add some additional seasoning next time for more/different flavor, but it is very good as written.

Nobody mentioned it was going to quite literally fall apart. Oh, SOOOO tender... I do like crispy and whatever, and it does need more flavoring, but this could be eaten with a straw.

Loved the foil idea!!  I followed the advice of many and added herbs, onion  and garlic in the cavity with herb butter under the skin.  Apples, oranges etc. also work well in the cavity.  1hr. on high and 8ish on low was about right, as I then popped it under the broiler to give it nice color.

Instead of the foil, I put a metal cooking rack on the bottom of the crock pot.  I put the chicken on top of that, seasoned according to instructions, and poured about 3/4 C. chicken broth in the bottom.  I set it to high for 1 hour, and then cooked on low for 5-1/2 hours, so the chicken wouldn't fall apart when removed.  I put the chicken on a cooking sheet, put it on the bottom rack in the oven, and broiled it for 20 minutes.  YUMMO!!!!

Juicy & delicious! I soaked my chicken in a gallon of seasoned brine overnight, rinsed, and patted dry. I have a 7 qt. oval slow-cooker, so I increased the foil balls to 6. Poured a 1/2 c. chicken broth into the bottom before adding the bird, breast-side down. Melted 2 tbsp. unsalted butter, stirred in a little garlic salt, paprika, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and poultry seasoning, and rubbed onto the chicken. Cooked for 1 1/2 hours on high, then 5 hours on low. There was plenty of juice beneath the chicken, so made gravy, and served with mashed potatoes and steamed mixed veggies. I would've never thought of elevating the chicken on tin foil, but I'm glad I tried it!

I followed the directions with the exception of the seasonings.  I seasoned it to my taste. A very easy prep.  The meat fell off the bones when removing it from the cooker.  I think I need to cook it for a shorter period of time.

Like many others this was great but needed a few changes. I placed baby Dutch potatoes, carrots, and onions in the bottom of my pot with 3/4 cup chicken broth. I then placed well seasoned chicken thighs on top. Seasoned with 
salt, pepper, paprika, and rosemary. I then cooked on low for 9 hrs. Next time I might only do 8.5 as it was just slightly dry. Anyway it was fantastic! Great recipe to build off!

It's edible and it looks baked.  I followed the directions exactly as written.  The texture was atrocious - it wasn't tender; it was so far beyond tender it was like chewing chicken paste.  I think I might try this method again using the temperature probe on my slow cooker to keep the chicken from overcooking.

My family loved this chicken. I especially loved how EASY it was to prepare and tasted like the rotiserie chickens you can get at the grocery store or Wally-World.  I imagine you could season it with italian dressing, or a blend of italian seasonings, or lemon pepper, etc. to get just about any flavor you like!

I followed it exactly but did as other reviewers and used quartered potatoes instead of aluminum foil. It turned out as expected! Next time, I would like to try adding more spices.

rubbed it under the skin really well with onion salt, garlic salt and pepper.  sprinkled it with paprika.  Fried it in a pan till it looked nice and golden brown. stuffed it with onion and celery.  put on top of aluminum balls as directed and didn't add any juice.  Came out great.  Had enough juices to make gravy.

We really enjoy the juicy, fall-off-the-bone chicken from this recipe. I use seasoned salt, which already has some paprika in it, and add additional paprika. If I had a kitchen torch I would use it to crisp up the skin after cooking, but it still tastes good.

I used these directions/method and cooked boneless, skinless breasts prepared the way I usually do for baking (coat with seasoned flour, dip in beaten egg, coat with flour again).  I placed pieces on balled up foil.  It was delicious, easy, quick prep and clean up.  Thanks for a terrific chicken recipe!

Very good, fall-off-the-bone chicken.  I didn't use the foil but set the bird on top of carrots and celery pieces.  The paprika really gave the chicken a delicious flavor.

10 hours on low is way too long - the chicken was very mushy.

It was ALRIGHT. Honestly, not as good as I thought. Yes it was very tender, that it fell off the bone, but it wasn't as good.

This was my very first venture into slow cooking. Saw this recipe and gave it a whirl.  The foil balls in the bottom were a bit dodgy for me so I substituted for carrot, onion, celery and broth.  Stuffed the bird with lemon, garlic and fresh thyme.  The good news it was, as most reviewers have stated was literally fall off the bone.  In fact there was not a part of the chicken I could save from becoming simply burrito filling.  Skin white and limp but moist shredded chicken without the hassle of shredding it.  Would I endevour to cook a whole chicken this way again?  Not on your life. This simply did not come close to a crispy skin, succelent dark meat and moist breast meat.  But for ease of clean up and instant shredded meat, sure.  Not giving up on slow cooking tho - I think I better stick to stew!

Really disappointing. The chicken was dry and flavorless. As suggested by other reviewers, I used potatoes on the bottom of the pot -- the potatoes were cooked perfectly, as were the carrots. But who wants to eat well-cooked but flavorless veggies and inedible chicken? I'll be going back to roasting my chicken in the oven.

I was so disappointed.  I was so excited to make this and it something I couldn't even eat.  I added a little chicken broth as some suggested and maybe that's why it turned out bad but I don't think I will try it again.   I can't even describe the texture this chicken had after 8 hours in a slow cooker, but it was inedible.  :(

This was basically boiled chicken, my family didn't like it.  I deboned it and used it for chicken spaghetti the next day.

Messy, but good!  I used veggies (potatoes, carrots, onion) instead of foil.  I rubbed seasoned salt under the skin before cooking.  The chicken did fall apart while taking it out of crock pot.  By the time I got it all on the platter it was in pieces.  But, as I said, it was juicy and good.  Thanks for sharing.

I used potatoes, carrots and onions instead of alumium balls and added chicken broth as other users suggested. The chicken fell off the bone... but still needed more flavour. Next time I will use a sauce for stronger favour.

Thought this was blah; I was hoping to like a whole chicken in the slow cooker but not so much.  Even basted toward the end hoping to improve flavor but very plain tasting to us.

My 3-star review is based upon how the chicken itself turned out.  I will say right out that I didn't follow the recipe verbatim - I adapted it based upon other reviewers (onion quarters and garlic on inside), and added carrots and celery pieces to the foil balls underneath the chicken.  I added 2 cups of chicken bouillon and regularly basted the chicken throughout the day with the juices.  Should be good, right?  My family was pretty underwhelmed.  It was "just chicken" with no amazing result.  With that said, I strained the resulting chicken broth and blended it with some of the veggies.   The result is an *excellent* soup base.  I'm recovering the ho-hum chicken result with a very nice chicken noodle soup as I type this.  This will be perfect for my hubby who didn't eat dinner since he's down with a flu.  Yummy stock + water + chicken chunks + noodles will be great!

This was okay.  The chicken was too soft for my tastes - perhaps I cooked it too long.  Probably won't make it again.

Oops!  This was my first time using my slow cooker..ever.  I put in 2 cups of broth, first mistake as it turned into soup.  I used veggies on the bottom which added flavor.  I did cook it 2 hrs on high and 4 on low and the chicken fell apart when I removed it.  However, it was very tasty and I definately will try again with a few changes.

I used boned leg quarters and cooked for the 1 hour on high and 8 on low. Fell off the bone but some parts a little mushy. Flavor was excellent I will use whole chicken next time. Great with the foil balls

Chicken did not brown until I took it out of the crock pot and stuck it in the oven.  According to the temp, it was done, but it certainly didn't look like it was.  Unfortunately, it did not taste very good either.

I think this recipe was good for some reasons and not so good for others. I made it for two people and used the leftovers for chicken salad. I love the fact that the chicken just fell off of the bone. I also really enjoyed the foil ball technique. However I thought the chicken was a bit overcooked and it lacked a bit of flavor.

Fell off the bone--however, I slathered herb butter under the skin top and botton and it still did not have enough flavor. I stuffed a 4.5lb bird with s&p onion, celery, carrots and bay leaves. Loved the baking tecnique with the slow cooker but will have to adjust the seasoning next time.

I gave this 3 stars for ease to make, however the results weren't as good as I had hoped. My fiance, (who says everything I make is outstanding) had to make some sauce for this chicken to eat it. I wasn't terribly impressed too, it lacked flavor. I might try the crockpot and foil ball method again, but spice up teh sauce somehow.

This chicken was a bit bland. I also didn't get the browning effect like I thought I would. I would say if you add some more seasonings, and maybe add some butter to the skin, it would turn out better.

Stuffed cavity with onion and garlic and poured about 2 cups of chicken broth in the bottom of the crock pot.  I did remove the skin and I think that did help with the flavor.  Overall, it turned out pretty dry.

I used the foil ball idea. Instead of the whole chicken. I used 4 legs and thigh quarters split. I also pulled the skin off so the flavor would take over. oh i added garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, pepper, and seasoning salt. DH was surprised how tender it was. there was only 2 legs that I guess were a little to skinny because they were a little dry.Next time I wont cook for the whole 10 hrs.I am fortunate enough to have 2 crockpots. I cubed about 10 potatoes in my other one, melted a stick of butter, mixed with 1/4 bottle of ranch sauce and a chicken boullon cube. Poured that over the potatoes. OMG so good. It went very well with the chicken. Also made corn on the cob and biscuits. This fed 7 people easily.

I was always daunted by making a whole chicken, but I was surprised by how easy this was.  I followed other review suggestions and added 1 can of chicken broth, and some carrots, celery and little red potatoes into the bottom of the pot.  I also stuffed a quartered red onion into the cavity, and those onions tasted amazing!  I cooked on high for the first hour, and then on low for 8 hours and the chicken ended up being a little bit dry, so I may not cook on the low setting for quite so long next time.  Overall this was delicious, super-easy, and I'm sure I'll make this again.

This is a great recipe!  I used rotisserie seasoning on my chicken instead of the paprika.  I also used a 4 lb chicken.  It turned out great.  It was so moist it actually fell a part when I was getting it out of the crock-pot.  This recipe will definitely be a favorite!!  Thanks!!!

I placed the chicken on quartered onions instead of foil and stuffed the cavity with orange quarters.  Chicken was tender, but the breasts turned out dry.  Because of how easy it was, I will probably make it again.

I didn't follow the instructions as stated, but rather followed another suggestion.  I added 2 cups broth to the bottom,  stuffed w/ garlic and onion, cooked on high hours and low on 5.  It was so horribly dry.  I will have to try the printed cooking instructions.

Four out of five stars because one of my five children didn't care for it.  I did follow another reviewer's advice and cut up an onion and stuffed it inside the chicken along with a little bit of garlic and some fresh thyme, rosemary and basil.  The next time, I'll just roast the chicken, I think that the flavor is better.  A good recipe for a week/work day, though.

I've never seen chicken fall off the bone so literally before. It was tender and delicious. I added potatoes, carrots, and chicken broth to the slow cooker and cut the skin off the chicken and cooked it all day. We used the leftovers for enchiladas and BBQ chicken as well.

Very bland. I highly recommend adding more seasoning to this recipe. My 3.5 lb chicken also came out a little dry. If I make his recipe again I'll add more spices and adjust cooking time.

Moist, tender meat.  The only thing lacking was an attractive presentation.  Great for the family, but not the kind of beautiful presentation you'd want for company.

I made this chicken the other day and I have done something like this before and I liked it, so did my family and friends. I added baby peeled carrots and onions to the bottom of the crock-pot they cooked well.

I liked the idea of cooking a chicken using the crock pot. It came out pretty good, I think I prefer roasting a chicken though.

Really enjoyed this, but if you put chicken stock or broth in the bottom, I suggest you use low sodium!!

I'm kinda torn about reviewing this one.  You know, it has it's pro's (ease, lower fat, etc), but the cons?  Some spots were dry, it was on the blander side... So, I'll give it a three.  I did follow the suggestions of nixin' the foil and using potatoes instead.  Stuffed the cavity with garlic and onion.  Rubbed a bit of olive oil on the bird.  Used Penzey's Poultry Season, instead of Paprika (not a big fan), and poured about a cup of chicken broth into the bottom of the crock with potatoes.  If I'm havin' a extra busy day, I MAY try this one again (only jazz it up more) - but odds are, I'll skip it and try something else.

I followed others suggestion and cut up red baby potatoes and carrots and placed them instead of the tin foil.  I also removed the skin from the chicken and rubbed it down with olive oil, seasoned it and added fresh rosemary.  Overall the chicken was quite juicy and I will probably make this again but I wasn't really wowed.

I knew it was too good to be true. I agree w/ another review "if it looks like chicken, smells like chicken, tastes like chicken, it must be chicken."
It was ok.  I will use the leftovers in a pot pie.

This was incredibly tender fall-apart chicken. I used 4 whole skinless chicken legs. My husband claimed it was the best he ever had, but I thought it needed more flavor. Still good-I will definitely make again.

I would adjust the time in the cooker back a bit to prevent over cooking. The chicken browned so nicely and the skin was crispy and flavorful. The breast meat was a tiny bit dry.

I thought this chicken was very good.  I added some basil and ground pepper to the skin and put a few garlic cloves and chopped onion inside the chicken to give it a little more flavor. Great recipe!

This was good.  I also put garlic powder, onion powder and poultry seasoning and rubbed it in. Put a little bit of water in the bottom.  It cooked all day.  Fell apart while trying to take it out.  Everyone just loved it.  So simple!!!

My family loved this!! Based on the other reviews, I, too, used chicken broth and seasoned with garlic salt in addition to paprika. I didn't try the red potatoes this time, but will next time. I served it with buttered noodles. A great dish!

I had a bit of trouble with this. I added some broth to the bottom, but the aluminum foil balls collapsed and I ended up with a boiled chicken. Tasty, but not what I was hoping for.

This chicken came out really juicy and falling off the bones but extremely bland. I thought I seasoned it well by rubbing the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic, paprika and stuffing garlic inside of him. Still completely tasteless. Next time I might just marinate it overnight and see what's happens then.

The texture of the chicken was great. However, it was very bland even though I rubbed it with lots of spices. I guess next time I have to rub under the skin or take the skin off. I also put it on top of potatoes wedges. These were great, but I didn't peel the skin off and they looked kind of funny. Will peel them next time and maybe add carrots.

I had a hard time grasping how a chicken would brown in a slow cooker. So, I braised my chicken on the gas grill and stuffed it with rosemary and onion along with a garlic and herb rub. I cooked the bird on low for 9 hours and it came out wonderful.

I had used a fryer cut up.  I found the recipe a bit dry and plan on placing some chicken stock in the slow cooker next time in hopes that it will help to keep the chicken moist.  Good recipe overall.

Super easy and delicious, and you can easily alter ingredients to suit indivdual tastes!  My one and only comment/suggestion is NOT cooking it as long as stated, my poor chicken fell completely apart, no worries.. it was still quite yummy!
Try straining and feezing the left over chicken stock.  I used mine for a base for Italian Wedding Soup, of course with another recipe from allrecipe.com  :)

I had a large natural chicken approx 6 lbs from a local farmer. I followed the recipe but added additional seasoning to our taste. Cooked on high for 4 hrs than lowered it to low for another 7 hrs.This was superb. The meat fell right off the bone and was juicy. My compliments to our local farmer and to your recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly (not very hard to do) and the chicken came out a little bland and the white meat was very dry.  It did fall off the bones as everyone else said, but I was disappointed in the dryness.  I will use all the leftovers for chicken burritos, but will try a different recipe next time.

It came out dry and lacked any kind of flavor even though I used extra spices, garlic and onions like other reviewers.I don't leave reviews very often, but I had to do it with this mistake.

Even though the chicken was very tender, it still turned out a little bland.  I even used more seasoning than the recipe called for and rubbed it under the skin.  However, the leftovers are great for using in other recipes like chicken salad or casseroles.

I think it's just as easy to roast it in the oven. Tasted bland to me. I think the foil is a great idea to reduce fat in the slow cooker though. I might try the idea with pork in the future, but I will not try it again with chicken.

I used 4 lb chicken & it was a little overcooked.  Very juicy but fell completely apart.  I won't cook as long next time.  It was delicious though!!!  I also added pot and carrots rather than foil.

I'll have to try this again to see what I did wrong. We tried injecting the chicken with a homemade marinade that contained some lime juice. My chicken came out tender, but also mushy in texture. We ended up throwing out the leftovers. I think the base recipe idea is good, however, and I plan to try it again without the injected marinade. Like others I put  chicken broth in the bottom of the crock pot, and used potatoes and carrots instead of foil to go under the chicken. At least those modifications were at a good idea!

Not quite as good as I had hoped (or as it smelt). On the advice of other reviewers, I added quite a bit more spice than recommended, stuffed the bird with bell peppers, garlic and apple and replaced the tin foil with quartered potatoes and carrots (the veggies were very tasty). Unfortunately, the chicken was totally overcooked (falling off the bones and bones disintegrating) and certainly not visually impressive for some of the pickier eaters in the family. I will give the recipe another shot with a few changes and not cooking for as long but I’m not getting my hopes up.

Okay.  I added seasoning as others said it lacked flavor and I cooked it with chicken broth at the bottom of the crockpot- still lacked flavor.  Very moist though.  I cooked mine breast side down for first half of cooking time, I think that helped.  Probably not a keeper recipe, but if you're a crockpot cook it will do.

Liked this recipe. I tweaked it a little bit and sprinkle olive oil and garlic powder before placing it the crock pot. My husband don't usually care for anything I make in the slow cooker, but he liked this one and said it was good. I had it on for more than 9 hours as I have a small cooker with no settings and forgot about it. It still came out soft and good, a little on the dry side.

I was surprised at how much flavor the chicken had despite how easy the recipe was!  I added garlic to the inside but it wouldn't have been neccesary.  I was happy to learn of the foil idea.  Good recipe. I will be making it again!

This was wonderful and so easy! I have a small rack that fits in my crockpot so the chicken did not sit down in the liquids. A little paparika and parsley/basil sprinkled on top gives it some color.

It was very tasty, but it did fall apart trying to get it out of the crockpot. I would recommend this, but would plan to pick the chicken rather than trying to serve it whole. Still, a keeper in my book

Very bland, no matter how many spices we added.  However, the idea of putting the balls of alum. foil underneath was so helpful that I gave this an extra star!

It probably would have been much better if I'd made it for the properlength of time. I cooked it 10 hours and it got too dried out.

It was moist, but flavorless.  I even seasoned it with many more flavors than it called for.  I would prefer it on the rotisserie.  The only great thing that came from this was the broth it made.  I will use that in something.

This recipe was fantastic -- I never would have thought up the aluminum foil idea.  The chicken tasted like it had been roasting in the oven all day -- but I'd been at away at work while it cooked safely in the slow cooker.  The meat just fell off the bone, I loved the ease of preparation and my family loved the juicy chicken dinner.

They chicken was very tender and fall of the bone, but the skin never got crisp and I don't like chicken skin that's not crisp. I ended up using the chicken in another recipe.Chicken and Rice casserole that was delicious.

This is the easiest, tastiest chicken recipe ever!!  It literally falls off the bone!  My husband and I absolutely love it and now prepare it at least once a week.  Basically I season it with what ever we feel like that day.  Most of the time I use garlic powder, onion powder and a special seasoning from one of our local restaurants here.  Thanks so much for sharing such a wonderful recipe!  This is a staple in our household now!  :o)

I made a whole chicken on low for 10 hours while I worked(didn't have the time to wait for the first hour on high). It was so tender that when I tried to take it out of the pot it literally fell apart! Awesome taste, and it can't get any easier. I added Lawry's seasoning salt, garlic powder and onion powder to enhance the flavor.

This will be a great way to bake chicken in the summer months - without heating the oven! Tasted like rotisery chicken, and yes, it was tender and fell right off the bone.I did my chicken whole, breast side down. I also started it late in the morning so I kept in on high heat for 3 hours then turned it to low. I added lots of Lawry's seasoning as suggested as well as some Italian seasonings. I will be making this again and again! Thanks for sharing!

This was an incredibly easy recipe.  My crock pot is oval so I ended up making five or six aluminum foil balls.  I guess their purpose is to keep the chicken up out of the drippings.  

Other reviewers said it needed more seasoning so I wasn't shy with the Lawry's, and Lemon Pepper seasoning and pepper.  

It turned out moist and what we didn't eat right away, we refrigerated and ate later.  Meat fell off the bone.

I was able to be home all day and added spices periodically. Chicken was seasoned with Lawry's Seasoning Salt, Garlic, Pepper. Turned out well, and my family really ate it up. Hubby was surprised I'd done it in the crock pot! Very tender. I will make it again soon.

Well, the first time I tried to make it my crock- pot was too small! So I baked it in the oven and it was great. Finally bought a larger crock-pot because I was dying to try this the correct way. It was delicious. Easy, tender and tasty.

very good!  I used seasoned salt and lots of pepper and paprika.   Would be great for any recipe that calls for cooked chicken.  Chicken fell off the bone and grease went to bottom of slow cooker.  Very good!  I used bone in skinless breasts.  A keeper!

Instead of the salt, pepper, and paprika, I would try seasoned salt. This also makes great chicken drippings for a gravy.

Very quick and easy to prepare, the chicken was very moist but the skin didn't brown, not exactly like a roasted chicken although flavor was good.

My whole family loved it. I put it on to cook in the morning and was able to do other things while it cooked. I put the whole chicken in put didn't get the whole chicken out all at once because it fell apart when I tried. It was the best and easiest chicken I have ever made.

This was a great way to do a whole chicken.  All the fat was in the bottom of the crock pot away from the bird.  (It also works well for a small turkey breast)  It was moist and very flavorful.  Thanks!

My family all loved this!  I did add some additional seasonings. Also, I misread the directions and didn't cut up the chicken, but it was absolutely delicious.  The meat fell off the bone!  Definitely a do over!

Excellent! My family and friends laughed about the foil until they tasted it, then begged for the recipe.
