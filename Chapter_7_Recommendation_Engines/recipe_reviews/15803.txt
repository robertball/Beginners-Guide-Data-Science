Simply wonderful. An awesome dessert - highly recommended. Very easy to make.  This makes enough for two moderately filled pies or one very-very-filled pie with leftovers (yum).   My two simplifications:  - Instead of a food processor, I used a blender - I just added ingredients (with the hot cream) and blended; I didn't find it necessary to drizzle hot liquid in while it was running.  - With whipped cream, I didn't find it necessary to add sugar slowly. I just added all sugar at the beginning and whipped.  Thanks so much! Will be making again!!

Very good but instead of a graham cracker crust I made a chocolate cookie crust. Chocolate and peanut butter are just meant to be together

Quick simple recipe that is delcious and easily adaptable to other flavors.  I've also made this with mint chips and simply omitted the peanut butter.  Delicious...the mint was everyone's favorite since it is different than most pies of this nature.

Easy to make,  everyone loved it.  I added a few mini peanut butter cups on top!  Will definitely make again.
