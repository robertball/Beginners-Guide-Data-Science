This is an excellent recipe and so simple to make.  It will not impress you if you eat it immediately after baking.  Let it sit in the frig overnight and it gets better everyday.  Great to make ahead, I have made it up to 4 days early and ate on it for 2 days after. Great!!!!

I make this every Thanksgiving instead of pumpkin pie since I discovered this recipe several years ago. I was surprised to find something my family and I would love in the free Kraft recipe booklet that comes in the mail (I usually toss it out with the junk mail) but this really is a wonderful cake.

I make this almost every Thanksgiving. My husband took it to his potluck at work a few years ago and everyone wanted the recipe! They were so impressed! I will definitely be making this for his Thanksgiving potluck tomorrow!

I was very excited to finally find this recipe on the website. My original recipe was called "Pumpkin Torte". I have made it several times for different occasions. People could not believe that it was homemade and not from a bakery. The recipe I have calls for 16 ounces of Cool Whip. This is a fabulous cake!!

This cake is delicious and very moist.  I don't care for nuts, so I just ended up frosting the whole cake.  I love the frosting too, since it is not too sweet thanks to the Cool Whip.  It wasn't the most attractive cake, but tasted delicious!

Excellent cake!  It truly is luscious.  I made this for a Christmas Eve dinner at a relatives house this year and it was a hit.  No changes needed, perfect as is.

This was very good and easy!  I am not much of a baker and this was a big hit.  added chopped walnuts instead as well as adding them to the batter itself.

I made this last year and the only difference was in the place of cool whip I use REAL whipping cream and the family went NUTS! My family never ask to take left over cake but they all fought over who got to take it  home. 
It is SUPER EASY! I was a baker for 18 years of my life. So if my family enjoyed it you know it was number one!

I always make this cake in the fall for parties or get-togethers.  It's easy; looks and tastes impressive.  I top mine with candies pecans.  Take 1/8 cup or less of white sugar and heat in a small frying pan.  Stirring constantly.  Just as the sugar starts to liquify, add the pecans.  Keep moving the pecans.  They take no time to toast, 1 minute is plenty.  Place the pecans on a sheet of wax paper and quickly pull the clusters apart with two forks.  Be careful!  Those tasty suckers are HOT!!  Work fast, the pecans will cool quickly, you have about 30 seconds of working time.  Do small batches.  Enjoy!

I made this as cupcakes to take to a christmas party, it worked out excellent. I cut the cupcakes in half so they would have two layers, they turned out beautifully!!

SO different and yummy. My boyfriend thinks it tastes weird with the filling but everyone else loved it so I don't care what he says. It is a refreshing holiday change.

We didn't like this at all.  Followed recipe exactly and was very disappointed.  It looked beautiful but there are much tastier things to spend calories on!

This cake is absolutely amazing.  Just the perfect balance of sweet and spice, and a perfect alternative to the standard pumpkin cake.  A must try!
