I made this for extra credit for my Peru project in social studies and it was very good. My dad accidentally added an entire thing of garlic instead of a clove though which gave it a kick.  everyone seemed to enjoy it and the sauce was absolutely incredible. When we boiled the jalapenos  we had spicy steam throughout our house for a few hours though, which hurt.  Overall taste 10/10 and cooking was an 8/10

very tasty and easy to make. traditionally made using aji amarillo. you can find a jar of it in most hispanic markets. 2 serrano peppers make a great substitute.

Made this for a culture night at church and it was a hit. Hard to find aji peppers so I put in some poblanos.

I live in Ohio and Peruvian food is scarce but I had a craving for this and besides the Aji peppers everything else was easy to find (I substituted with jalapeños) What an easy recipe to follow! I would say I’ve had better but that’s because I’ve had A friends Peruvian mom make it and you just can’t beat mami’s cooking! But if you’re not savvy with authentic Peruvian food this will hit the spot my husband loved it and this was his first time trying Peruvian Cuisine MUCHISIMAS GRACIAS MARCO
