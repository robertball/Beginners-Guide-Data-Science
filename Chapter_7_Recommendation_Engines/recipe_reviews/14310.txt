Cannot wait to make this again and again over the summer. In order to decrease the fat I used water chestnust instead of the cashews, and half bacon/half Morningstar Farm veggie bacon...no one at the table suspected a thing! Then, when I opened my new container of sour cream...it was spoiled and I had to substitute. I used what sour cream I had left in the fridge with equal parts nonfat plain yogurt and ranch dressing, mixed in a little sugar to take the edge off the yogurt. I would do the same next time, healthier too!

Delicious salad, Dee! I like to cut down on fat where I can so I omitted the cashews and added chopped waterchestnuts. To cut the pungency of the dressing, I added 2T mayo to the sour cream. On occasion I have added 2t of dry ranch dressing mix also.The bacon to green onion ratio makes this salad a big hit in our family. Thanks for sharing.

I really liked the cruncy difference but I changed it just a bit; I added half sour cream and half Ranch Dressing and it gave it a better taste.

This was the greatest tasting recipe for pea salad that I have ever found! I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a great hit! Only problem was that it disappeared too quickly. Next time I will double the recipe. A sure-fired hit with my family.

This was a big hit at a party I had.  I also added the 1/2 package of Ranch Dressing for seasoning.  I would definitely make again!

Absolutely delicious. I don't usually add the cashews,  I throw a can of French Fried Onions on top. I also add a bit of mayo to the sour cream, as suggested by a previous reviewer, along with a bit of dry ranch dressing mix. Love this stuff... it's a family favorite! Thanks, Dee.

OUTSTANDING.  WE HAVE A FAVORITE RESTAURANT THAT SERVES PEA SALAD REGULARLY AS A SIDE AND IT'S VERY GOOD BUT THIS TOPS THAT ONE FOR SURE.  I USED KNUDSEN LIGHT SOUR CREAM WHICH IS ONLY 35 CALORIES FOR 2 TABLESPOONS AND IT'S GREAT SO IT CUTS THE CALS ALOT.  I USED CRUSHED WALNUTS BECAUSE IT'S ALL I HAD AND IT WAS FINE BUT I THINK YOU COULD ELIMINATE THE NUTS ALTOGETHER AND IT WOULD STILL BE GREAT BECAUSE YOU GET LOTS OF CRUNCH FROM THE CELERY.

Had a picnic to go to that I needed to make a quick side dish to take.  This salad was ready in 15 minutes and I got lots of raves about it.

This is the best salad, I am required to make it for all family gatherings.  If I show up without it I am in the doghouse.  Perfect for warm summer days, its cool and crisp.

I brought this to a Bar-B-Q and the hostess requested the recipe. Very easy to make and tasty. I made it with low fat sour cream and didn't miss a thing!!
Next time, I'll try different nuts.

I followed the recipe and, as written, this seemed pretty average to me. After letting it sit overnight I made a couple of ammendments to it which helped.  I started by adding cubed cheddar cheese and fresh dill.  Then I added in some ranch dressing and mixed it together to cut the heavy sour cream taste and make the texture a little lighter and smoother.  Luckily, I did not add the cashews to the salad bowl, leaving them on the side for people to add as they wish, so I didn't have to deal with soggy cashews. After making those changes, it's better and still not one I'll probably repeat.

Good!  Very refreshing, I loved the taste.  I used light sour cream and half a small red onion, chopped, instead of green.  Added some dried dill.  I only had 1/2 cup of cashews, but I liked that amount.  I will make this again.

This is a good pea salad recipe.  I added a couple of hard-boiled eggs, cubed cheese and chopped pickles.  I did not have any cashews on hand so I did not use them but next time I will try adding the cashews.

This was a great recipe!  Lots of flavor and crunch.  Only change I made was that I used diced sweet white onions rather than the greeen onion.  Will definitely make this many times!

My Mom and I loved this recipe.  My husband and Father, though, thought the green onions were too much.  (Whimps!)  I will definitely  make it again but might try sweet red onions instead of the green.

I've made this recipe several times, always to rave reviews!  It's requested for all office functions, and my family loves it in the summer time.  I use a 16 oz bag of petite peas, and light sour cream, and adjust quantities upward somewhat.  The recipe is not fussy about amounts!

Thanks for the excellent recipe.  I used 1/3 cup sour cream, and 1/3 cup ranch dressing the first time.  The second time I just used 2/3 cup ranch dressing as I was out of sour cream.   I also used chopped water chestnuts in place of the cashews both times, and everyone raved over it!

I like to toss it on loose leaf lettuce and/or spinach.  And add a few sunflower seeds.  Also, great by itself.

I've made this a half a dozen times or so and there are NEVER any leftovers!!!  As written, the dressing is a little bland for my taste, and although I've toyed around, I've yet to find the perfect one spice blended for my picky palate.  Recently, my favorite dressing is half Miracle Whip and half ranch dressing. I'll post again when I perfect it!!!    I do add a jar of chopped pimentos and a handful of shredded cheddar cheese for color, and garnish with a paprika sprinkled, sliced or wedged hard boiled egg.  This is a great pot luck dish, sure to be one of a kind on a table surrounded by a half a dozen bowls of baked beans and another half dozen of green bean casseroles...  Dare to be different!!!

This is good, mom's is better.  You really can't put the cashews and bacon in too long before serving - cause the texture is just all wrong when they have sat in the sour cream.  We always use water chestnuts instead of the boring celery - and the salt and pepper should have measurements - because when you say "to taste" to people and they call the salad too bland - well does anyone else think that could be a seasoning issue?  We added enough salt and pepper that it wasn't boring - but really - I have to call mom to get the real recipe, because I remember this being super tasty around her table.  Thanks for trying...

Made this delicious salad yesterday.  After reading the different reviews, I opted for using the chopped water chesnuts and added 1/2 small jar of chopped pimento (for color).  The salad was great!  I've sent copies of it to several friends.  Thanks for a versatile recipe that I'll be using a lot!

I probably shouldnt rate this recipe, as I had to alter it because I ended up being out of sour cream, and used Mayo instead..  But its great.  i put water chestnuts, celery, onion, and bacon in with a spoonful of sugar and we love it!

This was so good!  I also added 1/2 packet ranch dressing to the sour cream.  It was a little creamier than I thought it would be (they coat the peas really thick) but it tasted perfect!  I will be making this one again!

I have made this salad several times.  I use fat free sour cream, and sometimes add fresh raw cauliflower.  Put the cashews in just before serving.  Love this salad!

A hit at the cookout.   used @3oz packaged bacon bits, two green onions, sour cream w/ @2 tbsp mayo (low cal), sprinkled @3 Tbsp ranch dressing and 1 cup celery.  will add more celery and some hard boiled eggs.  Great!
*have made this numerous times now.  I am now subbing Greek Yogurt for the sour cream.  also adding tons of celery and cabbage.  no cashews.  also fresh dill and basil.  TASTY!

I give this recipe a "5"  it had to be the entire Thanksgivivg dinners best dish.  I had my doubts about how  this simple no bake dish was gonna turn out.  I love peas. Peas are my favorite veggie.  but this recipe brought it to another level.  I will continue making this for any meal and even to eat on its own.  you can easily make it low-cal for no guilt eating.
Very pleased, Thank you Dee A+

I used half a sweet onion instead of the scallions, I used lite sour cream, I added a tbp or so of lite ranch dressing (all I had) & I added about 1/4 cup of grated parmesan. I copied WYATTDOGSTER & used water chestnuts instead of the cashews but next time I won't. They don't add any flavor & the salad has plenty of crunch w/out them. I minced everything very fine so that my grandbabies (2 & 10 mos) could enjoy it too. Which they did! ;o) Thanks for the recipe...it made a very nice lunch w/ some toast.

Very crunchy, wow. Traded the sour cream for mayo since we didn't have any on hand, and I am also not a big fan of the cashews, so we left those out too...still very good though. Try adding a bit of garlic.

Tasty. I used 5 slices of turkey bacon and replaced celery, which I don't like, with chopped jicama. I might make it again, but I would try other pea salads just to see if there is something else I preferred.

Great starter recipe.  Add a little mayo, dill, fresh parsely, chopped red pepper and hard boiled egg. Unsalted peanuts are a great substitute for the cashews.

I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted mayo (aioli) for half the sour cream. I was skeptical, but everyone really enjoyed this.

For a healthy version, I used turkey bacon and fat free sour cream.  It tastes great even without as much fat!  I'm on The South Beach diet so I bring this as a sack lunch and add the bacon and cashews right before i eat it.

I'm going to make this once again, this time adding a big of chopped red bell pepper to give it a Christmassy look!  I used the idea of adding some ranch dressing mix in the past - it's delicious, so I'll do that again.  This is an awesome recipe whether "as-is" or customized for your tastes...a definite keeper for your recipe files!

Great flavor, Good summer time salad  I want to try less bacon next time, also used bacon bits rather than fry my own.  Can't keep the boys out of bacon long enough to let it cool and crumble.

I made this recipe for a Mother's Day Brunch at our church.  I was one of the last tables to get through the line and there was NONE left when I got there, and the people who'd had it were looking for seconds!  Glad I took a few bites to "test taste" it before the brunch!  My kids, ages 3, 6 & 13, actually devoured it the 2nd time I made it!  I'm planning to make it for a company luncheon tomorrow too!  Thank you!

The only thing I changed was I added in Dill.  Awesome!

Great taste and texture!  I’m not a fan of cashews, so I used salted/roasted sunflower seeds instead.  I will try the water chestnuts as others suggested in the future.  What a great base, I’ve made this several times and look forward to it in the evenings after a long day at work, it’s always better the second day.  I also added a small amount of Hellmans mayo, to punch it up a bit.  Thanks again for this recipe ….

I used this for the first time a few years ago and I make it often during the summer.  I follow the recipe exactly except that I add shredded cheddar cheese...yum

Very good!  I would use water chestnuts, as someone else suggested, instead of the cashews next time though because if there are leftovers, the cashews get soft and are not good.

This salad is good.  I took it to a 4th of July party and a couple of people said they liked it, but I had plenty left over.  It is not very good left over.  I would say that I might make it again.

It was a bit bland for my taste and I don't care much for soggy fried bacon in mine, so I omitted that.  Instead, I mixed in some Uncle Dan's ranch dressing and thinned slightly with buttermilk.  I also followed the other readers advice and added some crunchy onion rings to the top.  Very nice addition!  I didn't have cashews, but I had sunflower seeds and I roasted some sesame seed.  It was yummy.  Plenty of crunch without the bacon!

After reading the reviews we decided to just make the salad as is.  Glad we did it was excellent and we added the dressings that we liked.  Thanks for a great post.

This was okay but wasn't great. Husband loved the bacon-y crunch. Also, I used cutting celery rather than celery.

I love this salad.  Have been making it for years since my mother-in-law gave it to me.  Everyone likes it whenever I take it to a potluck or BBQ, even people who don't think they like peas.

I did the stupidist thing ever! I made this for Easter dinner, it was awful. Bland. Bland. Bland. Maybe with Mayo or something, nobody could eat it and I was kicking myself because I didn't try it before hand. I have never rated anything so low!

Guess I expected this to be a wonderful salad given all the rave reviews but I prepared it just as the directions are given and served to a group of 25. Most of the people left it on their plates to be thrown out. I found it to be very bland. Will not make again as is a costly dish to prepare and not one compliment for the effort.

I had a great pea salad at a potluck and was looking to recreate it.  I think this was very close!  I used uncured bacon, 1/3 C greek plain yogurt and 1/3 C mayo.  It was a little plain.  Next time I will try all yogurt and sweet onion instead of green onion.

I was making quite a few dishes at one time so I cheated and used bacon bits (everyone knows bacon is so much better!).  I regret putting in the cashews since it was crunchy enough with the celery. I added 2 tsp. of dried dill weed.  I prefer Balsamic Pea Salad on this site.

I added leftover turkey chunks from Thanksgiving dinner. I added grated cheddar and since I don't care for cashews, I ommited them altogether. Even my husband loved it and he doesn't care for turkey.

I found this just OK. I made the adjustments noted by others, and used 1/2 ranch dressing and 1/2 sour cream; still, it was just a lot of "white dressing".  I ended up using only 6 of the 8 bacon strips, because 8 seemed like a lot for 10 ounces of peas (note that most bags are now at least 13 ounces)..  My guests noted the smokey flavor from the bacon, but otherwise just shrugged their shoulders on this salad.

I added about 1/4 c of ranch dressing to this and everyone liked it. I took it on a camping trip and the bowl was empty. So good sign of success.

I really liked this recipe. Taking into account the comments of others I added bottled ranch dressing, used light sour cream and added water chestnuts. It's a keeper.

Pleasantly surprised.  Love peas and wanted something new to make.  Sounded kinda bland but tried it.  It really is good!  Really, really good.  I always read the reviews and people are always changing the original so that doesn't help me decide.  I always make it the way it was written first.  I do like the idea of adding ranch dressing and may try that sometime but the original version is very tasty.  Give it a try if you're giving it a thought.
