We could not find the sazon seasoning packets in our little grocery store so Juanita and I used Lowry's seasoning salt instead.  I did not have to use buckshot to get my duck since I had a lot of ducks already in the pen thinking they were going to get some sour mash. I chose the fat duck which would have been greasy but I poked it full of holes first and set it upon celery stalks which kept it out of it's own grease. Very good duck and we all liked it.

I made a couple of changes. My bird was nowhere near 4 pounds and so I was too nervous to cook it at 450. I chose 350 instead and it was done in two hours. We also didn't keep the innards because we do not like them so I completely skipped this step. Hard to give an accurate review since my bird was not what the recipe called for but I do think the combo of flavors and the sazon was good for the duck. Thank you!
