Healthy and Yummy! I pretty much followed the recipe, except used jasmine rice since I had no brown rice, so shortened the time of simmering to 18 mins.  My acorn squash was pretty large so I cut it in 4, and placed flesh down in a microwave safe roasting dish, covered with plastic, so it took a little less time.  It needed a little salt, next time I will add it before serving.  The curry and red curry paste make the dish. The feta cheese was a great addition on top.  Definitely jazzed up the acorn squash!

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I made a handful of adaptations based on preferences and what I had available, because this recipe made a great base with some unique flavour ideas. My changes were: one diced apple instead of daikon radish, red onion instead of leek, water instead of stock (I was out of stock, but I figured the intense flavours could stand on their own), a mixture of wild rice, quinoa and millet (so simmered only 25 minutes), added 1 tsp of turmeric, omitted curry paste (couldn't find), spinach/spring mix instead of collards, and threw in a handful of frozen peas at the end. I also baked the squash rather than nuked it (350 degrees, 1/2 hour face down, sprinkle with butter and salt first), and added the spices to the veggie sauté a couple minutes before adding the rice and water, not after it was cooked (spices should be cooked in fat to wake up the flavours). One of my squashes turned out to be bad so I'm going to add some potato and cauliflower to the leftovers, it will make a fine curry dish. My only critique is that it needs salt, unless, I suppose, your stock is salted, which could be why the author didn't add salt to the recipe.

Nutritious and delicious. No need for adjustments except I went a bit lighter on the cumin. Note that the couscous/veggie filling make 2 times the amount needed to generously stuff 4 acorn squash. I didn’t mind having leftovers though.

It was sooooooo good, I had to convince myself to stop eating the stuffing. I used kale instead of collard, and tofu feta in place of cheese as I am vegan. Not sure if I had 1 1/2 tsp of curry paste as I was almost out of it. Also, cooked the two half squashes face down, rubbed with olive oil, and generously salted and peppered, in a 375 degrees F oven for one hour. The result was fantastic. I have friends for dinner Saturday and I’ll make it all over again. Thanks for this amazing recipe!

I used bleu cheese for feta; spinach in place of greens; and instead of rice, a mix of 2 parts kef and 1 part millet. I cooked the empty squash halves in more conventional fashion; next time I would butter them before filling.

This was excellent! I followed very close only did not have brown rice so used half white and half wild.
