I made this dish tonight, it was delicious!! I altered the recipe a bit; I used Italian turkey sausage instead of the ground sirloin and pork sausage suggested. It. Was. AMAZING!!! I also blanched the peppers before I stuffed them (I love bell peppers but they do not love me, they have to be cooked thoroughly). I've been looking for a low-carb stuffed pepper recipe and this is IT!!

We LOVED these.  The only changes to to the orignial recipe were:  black pepper (instead of seasoned), baked the peppers first, and 20 minutes in the oven (vs. 30min).  Also, I used red AND green peppers...which made for a nice change up.  Will definitely be making these again!!

Very tasty and perfect for my low-carb lifestyle.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, except that I didn't have any seasoned pepper and just used black pepper.  Certainly not lacking in flavor and rather simple to make. You don't miss the rice at all.  This does make quite a bit of filling, so really pack them tight and expect a bit left over.  I cut my peppers in half and piled them high with filling.  The only thing I wouldn't bother with next time is putting the tomatoes directly into the dish as they don't cook "up into the peppers" as stated in the directions, and don't add anything to the overall flavor. The cook time was spot on and left a nice firmness to the peppers. I like to meal prep and these make fantastic lunches!
