I had only russet potatoes, so that's what I used, and I had no fresh dill, so used dried.  For our taste, 2 Tbsp cider vinegar was too much because it really thinned out the dressing (it was almost like a salad dressing) and was a little too tart for us...I added a pinch of sugar.  I compensated on the dressing consistency by adding more mayo which yielded a nice smooth dressing that wasn't falling off of the potatoes. This was a nice change from the typical mayo-based potato salad, and in the future, I will reduce the vinegar to 1 Tbsp.  Thanks, bonmot, for sharing your recipe.  UPDATE 8.17.12  I had some left from dinner and was surprised this morning when I looked in the fridge that it held up great!  Wondered if the cukes would break down overnight, making it runny.  It looks exactly like it did yesterday.   Sooooo you can make it ahead of time with no concern that it'll be runny the next day.

Hooray! an easy, simple and delicious recipe that deviates from the norm. I love dill and decided on a whim this morning to add it to my basic recipe, but then got a little nervous about the outcome. Lo and behold, I found your recipe which confirmed my hunch that it was a good idea! I'm going to add the green onion and cucumber instead of the usual yellow onion and celery. What's funny too is that I also use apple cider vinegar in my recipe. Great minds think alike. Fantastic!! thanks. :-)

I substituted new potatoes and a half teaspoon of dried dill. This is an excellent salad, and the longer you leave it in the fridge, the more the flavors blend together.

We had this tonight because it had no celery and it was very tasty!  I had to make a couple of substitutions based on what I had:  rice vinegar for the cider vinegar and bell pepper for the cucumber.  We will definitely have this again because it is super easy and we normally have some type of crunchy vegetable on hand.  It paired very well with roasted red pepper grilled chicken and grilled corn - the mild vinegar really complemented the rest of the meal.  We will definitely have again. Update: I have made this more times than I can count. Sometimes I use dill pickle juice instead of vinegar and add whatever crunchy vegetables I have. This is by far my family's favorite mayo based potato salad. You can't go wrong with it.

I thought this tasted good. I liked how fairly quick it was to make and that it had a crunch, but not from raw celery and onions. I did only get about 3 servings though. After I started making it I realized I only had 1 green onion, so I just used that. For the dill I subbed 2 small pinches of dry as it is more affordable and what I had on hand. I also cooled the potatoes, ran them under some cold water, and then refridgerated them after draining for about 1 hour. For the dressing I used white wine vinegar with lite mayo. However, I think I would prefer the cider vinegar and regular mayo. My dressing got a little thin, which I believe was from using lite mayo. That was my fault though. Ty

I had fresh dill that I needed to use up and this seemed like a simple recipe, so I went for it.  This was very easy to make, with few ingredients and was exactly what I was looking forâ€¦ tangy, creamy and delicious.  I do not miss the mustard or celery at all.  My husband and I both agree that this will become our go to recipe for potato salad.  Thank you so much for submitting!

With so few ingredients and no egg, this potato salad packs on the taste.  What a wonderful use of our fresh dill.  This goes together very quickly since the potatoes are boiled  cubed rather than whole.  I make a kinds of potato salads, and this is one of the best I've tested and requires little effort.

Perfect, easy and adaptable in so many ways...  I used dried dill and lots of it, and a bit more mayo...  It was a hit at a dinner party!

First time so made as is except I did add celery too.  I love the crunch.   Really tasty and I would not go down on the vinegar!  The mayo/vinegar proportions make it wonderfully tart and not so heavily laden with mayo.   I am not usually motivated to make potato salad , but with this easy and delicious recipe I will be more inclined.

Absolutely loved this potato salad. I used an English cucumber (sliced and cut it halves), dried dill, and four cooked bacon slices chopped. We served it with teriyaki chicken kabobs, with green and red peppers, onions, and mushrooms. I would give this salad 10 stars!!!

Loved this and so did my guests!  I dashed some garlic salt in along with regular sea salt and used dried dill instead of fresh.  Such a great dish!

Delicious light potato salad for summer pot lucks!  I multiplied X4, cut the vinegar in half and the result was fabulous. Love the crunch of the cuke....much better than celery! Thanks!

This was so yummy. I substituted bell pepper for cucumber because that's what I had on hand. The only problem I had was  that I couldn't stop eating it and I had to scold my boyfriend for sneaking bites before dinner. :)

Yes, I made changes. Like others said, 2 teaspoons of the vinegar was too much.  I added more mayo, some regular white onions, some Splenda, because the vinegar was just too much.  I also added some sour cream.  Probably won't make it again.

This was a simple potato salad that turned out great.  I used baby reds (less chopping), only used 3 green onions (preference) and added more dill (I love dill!).  My guests and my husband really liked it.  I also liked it because my husband and I don't like white onions or celery, so the cucumbers and green onions were a good fit for us. I thought it was easy to make and everyone enjoyed it.    I was worried that there was not enough dressing at first, however it was fine after mixing it all up.   Good for people who don't like a heavy dressing or a heavy mayo tasting salad.  This will probably be my go to potato salad from now on.

Only three green onion stalks, four was overpowering. Only one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar. THIS. IS. AMAZING. THOUGH!  One more recommendation: double the recipe because youâ€™re going to want more. My teen and I almost demolished The whole thing before it even cooled off. Six stars!

This is a tasty potato salad.  I used the reds because I had them on hand, substituted 1/4 cup for miracle whip for mayo, because that's what I use and I added 1/4 cup sour cream, used 1T apple cider vinegar and 1T pickle juice (clausen kosher dill), added 1/4 cup cooked bacon, fresh parsley, chives & dill because that's what I have growing in my garden, s&p to taste and paprika.  I should add that I rarely follow recipes, but rather use them as a base of inspiration to create my own.  Next time, I'll try to follow the recipe explicitly.

Excellent! Make a few hours in advance to let the flavors come together! I used a fine dice of red onion because I didn't have green onions and it came out terrific, although I will use green next time to compare. I also used russet potatoes because again, that's what I had on hand...

Mine turned out kind of bland and dry (not a lot of dressing).  I'm not sure what I did wrong...But, it was fun to make and try something new.
