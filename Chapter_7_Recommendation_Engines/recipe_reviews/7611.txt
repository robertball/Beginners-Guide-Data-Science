I lost this recipe when we moved & am so glad to find it again. I made the cake this morning for my husband's office & here's what he said--"I had 2 pieces & others had several--it was very very good!" Here are the only adjustments I made: cut the white sugar to 1/4 cup, cut the oil to 1/2 cup, added 1/3 cup water; left out the raisins & nuts. Baking temp of 300 seemed to low to me, so I upped it to 325, then to 340. I think the temp & time need adjustment. The icing was great--I added 1/4 t maple flavoring & 1 t vanilla. Thanks for a keeper Suzanne!

Great! Although, I did omit the raisins & nuts. I did use 8 oz. of sour cream & you may want to reduce the brown sugar a bit. It is for the sweet tooth but it is Wonderful!

This cake had a nice flavor and the convenience of a mix. We enjoyed it, but I made it in a tube pan and there was WAY too much struesel filling. Maybe a sheet pan can hold all of that but it seemed like an awful lot!

This cake is even better than the original honey bun cake, and that is saying a lot because 
the original is to die for.

This really tastes like something from a bakery!  You can't ask for an easier recipe either.  I made this for Easter brunch and it went first and fast.  Extremely moist too!

Very good cake, I've made 20 of these cake so far. We kicked up the temp to 375 degree for 55-60 mninutes.  I added 2 tablespoons of bourbon(wild Turkey 101 to the frosting to change the flavor on some of them. you can add Rum or your favorite extract. also taste good with almonds or pecans.

This was soooooo delicious!! My husband told me not to take any to work. I took some in anyway and they all wanted the recipe. One woman made it and said that she just couldn't stop eating it! 
I followed the recipe exactly as written.

This received rave reviews from all my coworkers.  I baked it for 55 minutes @ 300 but will increase the temperature to at least 325 when I make it again as the center was pretty undercooked in my eyes.  Some of my friends thought that was the best part though. Will definitely make it again.

Nothing too special but great for a cake mix cake (I rate over all, unless it's INSANELY simple).  Put more batter on the bottom, and less on top; it tends to "rise" right through the crumb mixture.  Let this cool before eating or it will crumble in half.  I substituted other nuts for walnuts due to allergies, and I used store-bought icing.

This is my family's favorite holiday cake.  It is perfectly moist and delicious.  I omit the white sugar.  I also bake at 350 for 45 minutes.

Oh the deliciousness!!!! This was so yummy.  I put only 1/8 cup of the white sugar in the cake, next time I will leave out completely.  I left some of the streusel for the top, I liked it a lot that way.  Next time I will do 2 layers of streusel. Wonderful!

Easy and delicious cake. Will make again. Increased bake temperature to 350 for 50 minutes. Omitted the raisins and nuts(due to my family's taste). Add cinnamon to icing.

was ok..a little too sweet but the kids loved it. It also was not the nicest looking cake at the end. I made it into some cupcakes and an eight inch cake. May try it again in a bundt cake pan.

I replaced the raisins with extra nuts inside and sprinkled more on top after drizzling the glaze. I also used pecans instead of walnuts and baked the cake in a bunt pan. An extremely easy and delicious recipe! Make sure to use an extra moist box cake  mix!!

Very moist! I substituted apples and pecans for raisins and walnuts (no raisins and walnuts in the pantry at the time!), and cake turned out beautifully!  Nice fluffy texture, would be great with coffee for breakfast. All and all a great cake mix plus recipe. :)

I have been using this recipe for several years and everybody that has tasted it just loves it! It is especially good served warm.  The only thing that I do differently is to omit the raisins because I don't like them.  Also, I use pecans instead of walnuts, again, my preference.  Another thing, I don't use quite 2 cups (maybe 1.5 - 1.75 cups) of powdered sugar in the icing because I think it makes it too sweet.

Wow, this cake was so sweet it made my teeth ache! I will probably never really make this again but if I did I would make it healthier. You definately didn't need extra sugar in the cake batter and too much sugar for the filling. I guess that's what a honey bun tastes like though!
