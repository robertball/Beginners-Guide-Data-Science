I reduced the amount spices, as suggested by other reviewers, and used a food processor to mix the ingredients together in the morning; allowing the sausage to 'cure' until evening before using it in Tanya Belt's recipe for Ranchers Beans, also posted on AllRecipes.com. The best thing about this recipe is that I can control the fat and salt content.

This was awesome.  I made some for supper one night.  The kids thought it was a little spicy, but the hubby loved it!  I'm fixing some for him to take to work and share with the gang!

This was a quick easy recipe. The cumin was a little over powering so I will use less next time.

The recipe was fine. I experimented with it to satisfy a taste for less pepper and by adding a tsp of corriandar and a tbs chili powder it makes a fair chorizo. I added a little sage and dropped the cumin and reduced the pepper for my wife who doesn't like it spicy. Basically I made a batch leaving out the red pepper and cumin, split it into 4 parts, added the cumin and pepper back into 1; added the cumin, oregano, red pepper and chil powder into 1, added sage into one and voila, sausage to suit everyone.

I really liked this recipe, but thought it needed something a little more to make it a 5 star so I rating it a 4 star.

Instead of forming into patties I  crumbled this so that I could make breakfast burritos. Honestly when I first saw this recipe I was like why not just buy spicy sausage? I suppose you still could BUT the addition of cumin puts this one over the top. It was a little potent and maybe overbearing to some some but it was the perfect balance for me. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I as others decreased the amount of cumin I used only 1 Tbs I also added about 2 Tbs onion and to round out the flavor I added 1 1/2 Tbs light brown sugar as for the salt I used 1 Tsp. This made a spicy sausage that still had a very distinct taste of cumin but we like cumin at our house

I had a bunch of ground cumin to use up, and ran across this recipe.
I made it exactly as written, and I found it to be pretty tasty. I had half of it (2 patties) for breakfast, and the other half for lunch - when I gobble a recipe down, it's always a good sign.
It's quick and easy, and I think I'll make this again soon. I'm sure it could be better, but still I think it merits a 4-star rating. Thanks for a great recipe!
