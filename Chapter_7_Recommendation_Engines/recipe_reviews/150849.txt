I made these for friends at a Christmas Eve cocktail party this year and we all loved them.  Of course since it is made with Irish cream you know right off the bat it’s going to be a sweet drink.  So you’re not going to be drinking them all night.  We made them at the beginning of the evening, everyone had two and then we moved on to other less sweet cocktails.  Regardless, they were very good and I know I will make them again sometime in the future.

If I could, I would give it 4.5 stars.  It was very yummy but so sweet I could only have 1.  Probably a good thing.  It was more like dessert.
