I am not a big fan of the slow cooker for most things but in an effort to have Cacciatore on a weeknight I gave this a try.  The best thing I can say is that the chicken was well cooked.  The sauce, for all it's ingredients, was almost flavorless and seemed under seasoned.  My conclusions are as follows: 1st and foremost, Chicken Cacciatore requires browned chicken. In this recipe the skin is removed to avoid all the fat that would render during the 7 hrs in the pot.  The browning of skin  gives a depth of flavor that is sorely missing. 2nd, I think the garlic, onions, peppers and mushrooms need to be sauted. Again, to get the flavors needed for a good Cacciatore. The garlic and onions especially suffer from the lack of being properly sauted. If I were to attempt this recipe again I would spend 15 minutes browning these items before putting them in the pot. I have used this method with other recipes and had results far superior to this recipe.  I would not make this again without significant adjustments.

This was excellent.  I had some misgivings when I put it in the crockpot this morning because it didn't seem like it had enough liquid to cover the chicken, so I actually added just 3 chicken thighs, about half of what the recipe called for.  I used 1/2 C chicken broth, 1/2C white wine.  I only used 1 onion.  When I served it, it was very liquidy and I realized too late I had forgotten the cornstarch mixture, which I think must be essential.  I also didn't brown the chicken, and I put it in the crockpot frozen.  I cooked on low for 10 hours until I got home from work.

I was disappointed with this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and the flavor came out rather bland. My husband and I agreed that it seemed to be missing several elements that would have added more flavor. The chicken did turn out very moist though, so the cooking method still seems good.

Even my pickiest eater loved this. Will be making it again. Thinking about adding some white wine in the sauce next time for an added zip.

I really hate to rate this so low, but I followed this recipe to the letter, and I did not love it...nor like it.  In fact, after tasting the sauce over and over, hoping somehow it would magically taste better with more cooking time, I finally doctored  it up as best I could...trying to make it somewhat palatable. With no luck there, I threw all the sauce out, put the cooked chicken in a pot and threw Ragu on it.  I cooked the pasta and served the Ragu and chicken over it.  So all wasn't lost and we did wind up having a fairly nice meal after all.

This was a good basic recipe.  I made the following modifications.  I seasoned the chicken breasts with garlic powder, salt and pepper then browned it in olive oil/butter.  I added the chopped onions to the skillet and cooked until tender.  I made in the sauce in the crockpot as instructed but added 2 low salt chicken bouillion cubes and some red pepper flakes.  I didn't add the peppers and mushroms until half of the cooking was done.

I made this recipe exactly, and found it a little bland.  I really like the idea of slow cooker cacciatore, so next time I think I'll keep the skin on and brown it nicely, add plenty of salt to the crock pot, and maybe more Italian seasoning.  I neglected to cut the spine out of the chicken pieces, and the little bones ended up everywhere, so beware when using bone-in chicken!  It was very tender when done, so the chicken was falling off the bone and leaving the rest of the bone in the pot.  Not so great for the kiddos eating it.  I think with a few tweaks this could be a great recipe.

This was not very good. It's much tastier and of better consistency with vegetables crisper and meat tender but more firm if you use the same ingredients and just do it on the stove.  It only takes a little longer than the prep time for putting ingredients in the crock pot.

Ok, I listened to the comments and decided that I would spice this up by adding some Italian Seasoning, basil, hot pepper flakes, and extra garlic. I browned the meat first. It still tasted bland after cooking for 6 hours in the crock pot. In all fairness, I haven't found a chicken cacciatore recipe yet that I liked so maybe its me.

This is one of my favorite recipes! I sometimes add red pepper flakes or another seasoning to give it a little kick, but I think it is great as it is!  We eat this chicken cacciatore regularly and this recipe is the only way I make it!
