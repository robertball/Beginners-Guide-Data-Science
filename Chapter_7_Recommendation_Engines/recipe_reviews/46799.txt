Not to bad. Used fresh salmon instead of canned so it was much tastier.

My kids and hubby really liked this as well as myself. I did find that I had a few of minor issues. One they were slightly dry and the onions made it harder to bind the ingredients together when trying to press into ball shapes, I think mincing the onions instead of dicing them would be better. Other then that, it was a neat use of ingredients. Will make again. But will note, mine didn't fry very long because they got really dark rather quickly.
