This a hit! My only complaint is that as it cools with all the sour cream it will start to separate.

I used O'Brien hashbrown with onions and pepper already included.  Also mixed monterey jack and cheddar cheese.  Added an extra half of bag of hashbrowns also.  It was delish!

I was looking for a different type of potato side and decided on this one.  I made 1/2 recipe since it was just for me and the husband.  They were very good! Next time, though, I will use less Sour Cream.  But I will be making again! Great recipe! (I also sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top before putting in the oven.)

I made half of the recipe. I also added a bit of fresh garlic because that's how we roll here!  It was great for a change. Served it with BBQ chicken breast. I will be making it again.

Not bad, a bit moist. I felt it should have had less sour cream or been cooked on a higher heat. Separated a bit after cooling.

My husband and I both agreed that we were not impressed. I think there is too much sour cream and not enough potatoes.
