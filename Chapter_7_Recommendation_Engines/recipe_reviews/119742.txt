I followed this recipe with one exception: I added 4 tsp of vital wheat gluten with my flour. This was, without a doubt, the lightest, fluffiest loaf of bread I've ever baked in a bread machine. I normally use my machine only for dough and bake my bread in the oven, but decided to try this recipe "as is". The texture is wonderful, but this bread was a bit too sweet for us. I loved the addition of nuts, but my husband wasn't wild about them. I will make this again, but will probably pulverize the nuts to appease my husband. I will also cut the honey and molasses by half. Thanks for this recipe!

I used my bread machine to make the dough. I then put it in a bread pan, let it rise, then baked at 350 for 35 minutes, tenting it after 15 minutes. Delicious!

I made this bread the old fashioned way as I do not own a bread machine. It turned out okay, but I did not care for the taste. Too much molasses I think. If I were to make this again I would omit the molasses.

Yummy! I used toasted pepitas as I didn't have walnuts--so good!
