This was absolutely delicious.  I will
make it again and again.  Just one word of caution.  Although the directions clearly stated 9 x 13 pan,
I made it in a tube pan.  The directions on the cake mix stated in big bold letters, DO NOT GREASE PAN,
so I did't.  BIG, BIG, MISTAKE.  The
cake stuck to the pan and came completely apart.  Sooo, I just took
the pieces, put them in a 9 x 13 pan
and spread the Cool Whip topping over
them.  Everyone still loved it.  I did
add a small can of pineapple to the Cool Whip, along with a couple of drops of yellow food coloring, just for a little added touch.  Thanks so
much for posting this recipe.

The addition of the pineapple makes the angel food much too dense for the cooking time specified.  I cooked it for 25 minutes and my cake collapsed.  This cake really needs 35-40 minutes of cooking time if it is to stay intact.

I have made this cake several times.  I use an angel food cake pan, but even when using a 9x13, you still need to cool it upside down.  Also, I frost it with a small can of crushed pineapple (drained) mixed into a container of cool whip.

Super easy.  I added 1/2 cup coconut as someone suggest, and think I'll add 1/2 tsp. rum extract next time.  It did require about ten extra minutes in my oven.   So, for those who had trouble with it falling, I would suggest to cook it until it is golden brown AND has an even surface. (If not done, the center appears higher than the sides.)  It was so moist that I don't think you could easily dry it out by adding five or ten mintues to the baking time.

How easy was this cake to make?  Unbelievable!  Made one small addition...added 1/2 cup shredded coconut to the batter prior to cooking...so great.  Took this to my inlaws house and they went gaga.  Will make over and over again.

I believe the failures may have come from an Angel Food cake mix with the two bag mixing process.  I recently had a failure with this type which happened to be a store brand.  Previous times I've used a name brand that only had 1 bag in the box that didn't require beating the eggwhites separately in the box directions.  I also make it in the 9x13 pan ungreased and use a spatula to mix it right in the pan. It does seem to be a little sticky to get out but you can't beat the convenience of throwing three things in a bag to "Take & Bake" at another location.

You can't beat this cake for simplicity and tastiness.  I've made it twice, the first time I followed the recipe exactly, like that's hard!  And it was very good, especially considering how low in calories it is.  The second time, I splurged and added a cup of shredded coconut to the batter, and some vanilla extract.  I iced the cake with a canned cream cheese frosting mixed with more shredded coconut, a few drops of yellow food coloring and a teaspoon or so of coconut extract.  I sprinkled a cup or so of chopped and toasted peacans.  Yum!  I'm sure that my diet is in shambles, but it is worth it!  Hello cake, good bye waistline!

I found this recipe in a cookbook years ago and have made it several dozen times. A few tips to remember: Make sure your bowl mixing bowl is large. This batter more than doubles when you're mixing it.  Also, DO NOT UNDERBAKE!  The top needs to be dry & well browned. It will fall in the middle if underbaked.  I usually make this in a 9x13" pan & depending on the pan, my baking time greatly varies.  The last time I made this, I also inverted the 9x13" pan on two pieces of wood resting on the pan's handles just as you would a regular angel food cake.  The results were perfect!  **You can also substitute a 20 oz. package of sliced, frozen strawberries (thawed & with the juice) for the pineapple.

This one gets 5 stars simply because it's not much more difficult than boiling water.  I tried it just for the heck of it and took it to a party.  It was so good I didn't bother frosting it with the Cool Whip and it wasn't missed.  I recommend that we all keep a box of the cake mix and a can of the pineapple in the pantry for those "need something FAST" times.

Thank you soooooo much for posting this recipe!  I would have given it 10 stars if I could.  It is so easy; my 5 year old son practically made the whole thing.  And the taste!!! Heavenly.  It is the perfect combination of delicate angel food and sweet pineapple.  A great low fat dessert and perfect for my weight watchers diet.  I used lite Cool Whip so a serving size only has 1 gram of fat!! Delicious!!!!!!!!

Dear Pineapple Angel Food Cake:  Where have you been all my life?  You're so easy, yet so tasty I can even serve you to company and listen to them ooh and ahh about my superior baking skills.  I feel that this is the beginning of a beatutiful relationship.   Seriously, though - great recipe.  Thanks for sharing! Another note:  I made this again just the other day and mixed the ingredients together with a hand-held mixer for around 1 - 1 1/2 minutes.  The cake was fluffier and didn't fall like it did the first time when I simply mixed it by hand.  Some more serious bakers may already know this, but I thought I would share!   And another note:  I used this recipe with fresh peaches and added a cup of water to make up for the lack of moisture.  Another hit!  I simply can't get enough of this recipe.  Thank you!!

This was really good.  Really good.  But the instructions were all off, thankfully I am pretty good with angelfood, and I read a couple of the tips.  Correction #1.  You don't grease angelfood.  Ever.  It reacts to the egg whites and your cake won't rise.  Correction #2.  You do not just "cool" angelfood. You flip the pan over and rest the tube part on a glass and cool upside down.  This keeps it from falling, and makes removal easier. Resist the urge to run a knife around it until it's time to take it out, it will fall out if you do it before. Comes out like a breeze every time.  Change #1.  I added half a bag of coconut to the mix too. It makes the cake denser, but adds such a nice flavour.  Change #2.  I used real whipped cream,  I'll take a few calories from real food anyday.  Change #3. I toasted the remaining coconut for garnish.  Adds a nice flavor.  Change #4.  I cooked it for 50 minutes in my oven-which was what the box suggested as well.

I made this cake twice in the last 24 hrs.  It was super easy to mix and looked beautiful in the oven.  HOWEVER, both times it fell within seconds of being taken out of the oven and I ended up with a pancake!  I am so frustrated now!!  I needed to bring a cake to work and I'm out of time and will have to go out and buy one-I HATE That!!!

I've made this recipe dozens of times and never had a problem.  However, I NEVER grease my pan (I use a tube pan). Also, use a glass bowl (never plastic) to mix your ingredients.  The cake must bake for 35-45 minutes and is done when it appears golden brown and dry and cracked on the surface.  Cool the cake upside down and when cool, run a plastic knife between the cake and pan to release it.  If you've tried it and failed, it's worth the effort to try again.  This cake is delicious (and low in fat!)

My husband loves pineapple so I made this for his birthday... He absolutely loved this cake! He said I should make it for his birthday every year, and he loved the fact that there was pineapple in every bite. For the frosting, I mixed together 8 oz cool whip with 1 can of drained crushed pineapple and 1 package of vanilla pudding. Then I just spread that on top of the whole cake and added sliced pineapple on top for added effect. Thanks for this recipe :)

I've been making this for many years.  The recipe used to be on the side of an Angel Food Pillsbury cake mix box.  The only difference was to NOT grease the 9X13 pan.  Before baking put four equal size cans in a rectangel so that each can is at the corner of your 9X13 pan. After the cake is baked immediately turn the pan upside down on the four cans to cool.  If you do not bake it long enough the cake will not only fall in the middle but fall out of the pan when turned upside down. I normally bake mine 30 minutes.  I have also used this with fruit cocktail and diced peaches and cheeries.  Very easy cake even a grandchild could make.  Yummy!

I just made this cake to bring as an extra treat to a housewarming luncheon.  I made it with a can of pineapple chunks (just chopped them up by hand).  I reserved approx 3 tablespoons of the pineapple juice to whisk together with 1/2 cup powdered (confectioner's)sugar to pour over over it as a glaze.  Gave it a little extra sweetness and still fat-free.  I used a 9x13 disposable pan and you definately should turn it over to cool upside down.  It will not collapse, and stays in the pan.  When you're bringing it somewhere you can leave the pan and don't have to worry about getting it out for serving.  Just cut into serving sizes and throw the pan out when the cake is gone.  I will definately make this again.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe.

This is a perfect recipe. Only two ingredients that yield an amazing cake. I noticed on many of the reviews that people added water but the directions don't call for it. I just put  the can of pineapple with it's juice and a box of angel food cake mix in a bowl and mixed. It did get big while mixing so I would suggest a large mixing bowl. I didn't prepare the pan but had no problem with the cake coming out. I did not frost it. We felt it was great just as it was. The consistency of this cake is very spongy and moist.

I have made this before loved it but then when i looked for the recipe again I saw that no one could make it work with the 2 bag angel food cake mix. I was pretty bummed when I realized that was all I had in the pantry. However, I just mixed the egg white part and the pineapple and juice together until it formed stiff peaks (10-15 minutes) and then added the cake mix part a little at a time and mixed that for about 5 or minutes until it fluffed up again, baked it as directed and it came out beautifully! So it IS possible to do this with the 2 bag angel food cake mix,it just takes forever to mix it!! :)

I am giving this recipe 5 stars because it perfectly met my criteria for a super fast, easy and tasty dessert. After reading the reviews I debated whether or not to oil the pan, so I compromised and sprayed the bottom only of a 9 x 13 in. pan. The cake rose beautifully and did not sink after removing it from the oven. (I did take the precaution of inverting the pan while cooling - simply turned the pan upside down on the rack.) The cake did not fall out of the pan, but it did cut cleanly and did not stick to the sides.  It tasted better after sitting a day - more pineapple flavor - and was still moist and fresh on the third day. Let me see, what else - I added a tsp. of vanilla extract and baked it for a few extra minutes. I recommend this recipe for those occasions when you want a tasty dessert without any hassle.

I had heard about this on the Weight Watchers boards and finally decided to give it a try.  It is even better than I expected.  This is fat-free, people!  Woohoo!  It has great flavor and texture, and I think it is plenty sweet on its own.  So, since I also really like the slightly crispy/chewy top & edges of angel food cake, I do not plan to add any whipped topping ... you just don't need it, IMHO.  Oh, and I made it exactly as directed, spraying a 9x13 pan and baking exactly 30 minutes at 350.  I did *not* invert the pan, though ... turned out perfectly.  It literally took 2 minutes to prepare; is now my go-to last minute dessert to bring places.

If angel food is your thing, you will love this. I followed recipe exactly, except to make it prettier I baked the cake in a greased (veg spray) Bundt pan, not the rectangular pan. Used Betty Crocker cake mix because it's the one-packet type and used a house brand crushed pineapple in juice. Mixed cake and pineapple per pkg directions (30 seconds on low; 1 minute on medium) using wire whip in Cuisinart mixer--it increased in volume like crazy! Baked at 325 (because my pan is the dark, nonstick type) on bottom oven rack for exactly 45 minutes. Hung it upside down over a drinking glass till cool, per package directions. Can't imagine baking this without greasing the pan--the bits of cake that touched the top edge of Bundt pan that was not sprayed stuck pretty well. Cake rose beautifully, high and light. Moist, lightly sweet, redolent of sweet pineapple tidbits. Will definitely make this again, especially because I can always keep the ingredients on the pantry shelf, ready to go.

This cake is so easy to make and so good....plus it's low fat!  I added about a 1/2 cup of flaked coconut, and a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract.  Mine was perfect at 30 minutes.  Good enough for company!  Thanks Donna for taking the time to post this....BTW, I didn't do anything special to cool the cake and the pieces came out fine.  Just remember to spray your 9X13 pan with cooking spray generously before adding the batter.

Very healthy, easy, and flavorful recipe! I made the following modifications...I added a can of mandarin oranges to the mix along with the crushed pineapple. I used a 9 x 13 pan (sprayed with Pam) instead of the bundt and had no problems with it falling, however I left the cake in for 35 minutes. I let the cake cool upside down on a cooling rack. Along with fellow reviewers I added crushed pineapple to the cool whip along with a few drops of yellow food coloring. Very simple and great tasting recipe, thanks so much for sharing it!

Have made this cake for years and it's always a huge hit.  You can also use canned apple pie filling and sprinkle a bit of cinnamon on the top of the batter before baking.  Makes a great change for a fall or winter dessert.

I made this using Duncan Heins cake mix.  I DID NOT OIL THE PAN.  Using disposable cake pans, an allowing it to cool completely, it came out fine.   I added 1 cup water (box said 1 & 1/4C) plus the juice from the pineapple, and half a 20oz can of crushed pineapples.  (The juice from the pineapple will add extra mositure so I didnt add the whole amount of water.)  Although it was very easy, it took alot of time. 40 mins in the oven (extra cook time cause of the pineapples), then cool down time of 1 hour.  I made 2 small round cakes and stacked them and frosted them using 1/2 container "light" whip cream mixed with remaining 1/2 can pineapples.  The result was amazingly light and delicous.  Suggestions:  -ensure there is the full amount of liquid as stated on the box.   -cook about 10 minutes longer than stated  Im going to make this again and use rasberries and strawberries too next time.

This is a super recipe. Only one thing...it has to be Betty Crocker Angel Food cake. I tried another kind of cake mix and it was a disaster. But, with the Betty Crocker it works every time.

Easy and everyone likes it.  Please note that some angel food cake mixes come with the egg whites in a separate package.  This kind does not work nearly as well as the kind with everything in one package.  When I made it with the egg whites separate, the cake was flat.

This is a wonderful dessert if you follow the directions and don't add water or whip it. You just mix 1 can crushed pineapple with 1 pkg angel food cake mix.   stir til mixed put in a 9 x 12 pan that has been greased, bake and enjoy.

Very good! I added 1/2 cup coconut to the batter like previously suggested. Baked this in a springform pan, once cooled cut in half then spread 1/2 of (1 cont. cool whip, 1 small can crushed pinapple-drained, 1 sm. pkg white chocolate instant pudding). Then put the other 1/2 on top with cherries & toasted coconut. Made a very attractive dessert to bring to a 4th of July cook out!

This was so amazing. I will make this again and again. So simple to make a nd very tasty. I made a sauce out of an extra can of pineapple. 1  can Crushed Pineapple, undrained  
2  tablespoons sugar  
1  tablespoon cornstarch  
1  tablespoon orange marmalade, peach or apricot fruit spread  
Combine. Bring to a boil . simmer for 2 min untill thick. serve over cake with whipped topping. YUMMY!~! Will make this for family functions as it is so quick and easy. I even used just a 9x13 pan and it worked really well.

Very very good. And EASY! Made as directed and it turns out a great ake, not super sweet. Good for dieting. Folded crushed pineapple into the cool whip and I added a dollop to each slice instead of frosting the whole cake. Thanks!!

I have made this recipe many times. No need to turn it upside down and take it out. No need for it to stick. The secret is to bake in a glass pan. It doesn't work well in metal, or so I have seen. 350° for 35 min. in a 9 x 13" pan and it is perfect every time.

This was just not as fabulous as claimed.  Easy, yes.  Convenient, yes.  Memorable?  No.

I did not have technical problems like some reviewers.  By all observations things worked out well in the chemistry department.

My main problem with the recipe is the contrast between the delicate crumb structure of angel food cake and the course chunks of pineapple.  This cake wants to either be light and fluffy or dense and satisfying but is neither.  This is evident when cutting the cake.  Knives catch on the too-dry pineapple pieces and tear the cake to soggy crumbs.

Even the flavor is not spectacular.  I would equate it to the flavor of a pineapple Lifesaver candy - very sweet and little else.

My cake puffed nicely even in the center, but how in the world do you hang a glass 9x13 pan up-side-down?  I tried propping it on its side but the center still fell, though this is not my major complaint about the recipe.  It still had enough loft to be enjoyed were it not for its other lack-lustre qualities.

It was fun to whip something up with pantry ingredients I had on hand.  Tonight it was the difference between dessert and no dessert.  That said I would not add the two necessary items to a grocery list with any amount of excitement to make it again.  I would spend the extra time to make something much more special.

Thanks anyway.

This is the easiest and tastiest cake ever. I can't believe how good it is with such little prep and only 2 ingredients. I actually added 1/2 cup shredded coconut but may add a bit more next time. We ate the bundt cake within 2 days, just the two of us. I bought a few more angel food cake mixes and stocked up on crushed pineapple. This will be my go to dessert whether I'm in a rush with company over or whether it's just hubby and I. yummo. We're from Hawaii as is our dog and we love the pineapple, coconut combo. Topped with cool whip. Nothing sweeter than that needed. Thanks for sharing. So easy!

Agreed that this is a good and easy recipe.  My Mom made it and it came out about 1/2-inch thick.  I made it and used my mixer to blend the cake mix and pineapple following the instructions on the cake mix box (blend for 30 seconds, mix on medium speed for 1 minute).  The recipe recently appeared in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and included 1 teaspoon of vanilla which I did add.  The cake rose fully to the top of a 13x9x2-inch pan.  I served it with Lite Cool Whip over the top, although the Post recipe suggested cream cheese frosting and toasted coconut.  That seemed like overkill for this nice spring-like dessert.

I made this 3 times now; two times on the same day made with different cake mixes. I had a Betty Crocker in my pantry and needed one more since I was making them for a Church function. I bought a store brand which is a two step package. It did not mix well nor foam up like the Betty Crocker package. When it finished it was flat while BC turned out great. I love this cake but the directions really, really need to be more specific. YOU MUST USE THE SINGLE STEP ANGEL FOOD MIXES FOR THIS TO WORK!! Also, the crust should be brown and starting to pull from the edges.

Two ingredients.  Cake mix and canned pineapple.  What could be more easy?  And delicious to beat!  I followed the directions - 16 oz cake mix, 20 oz crushed pineapple (in juice, not syrup).  Mixed and baked 25 minutes.  Comes out perfect.  Very  tasty and no fat.  Good job!

This really is the easiest cake I've ever made, and delicious, too.  An added bonus is that it has no fat in it!  I drizzled a powdered sugar glaze over each piece instead of whipped topping.

I had purchased the 2 pouch angelfood cake mix and got nervous about how to mix it.  My solution was to combine both pouches in the bowl, drain the pineapple and use the juice to mix the batter.  Then I folded in the crushed pineapple.  The cake came out great (probably the same as the original instructions).  The center did collapse a little but not completely flat.  Perhaps that's what the topping is for - a disguise!

I obviously did something wrong (probably undercooked it) because it ended up very flat.  The taste was still pretty good even though the texture was way off.  So... I guess it would be five stars if I had cooked it a little longer.

This recipe was SO easy and really quite good.  It didn't seem like enough liquid at first, but after getting it mixed it, it was perfect.  After baking it (in a greased 9x13) I inverted it like a regular angel food cake.  I don't know if that was necessary, but the cake didn't reduce in height and didn't fall out of the pan.

My mom loves pineapple and angel food cake, so I thought I would give this a try. It was a HUGE hit! My Dad thought that it sounded bizarre but tried it anyway and absolutely loved it!. Because it is so easy, it definitely inspires you to try modifying it, but really you don't need to. It is perfect just the way it is!
P.S. I didn't have a problem getting the cake out of the pan cooling it right side up.

I used a 2-bag angel food mix and it worked well this way:  mix the egg whites and water as directed on the box.  Mix in the 2nd bag.  Drain the pineapple and fold it afterwards (save the juice for the glaze).  I used a angel food tube pan (no grease or spray) and it came out fine after inverting the pan on a bottle and cooling the cake completely.  I used 2 cups of confections sugar and enough of the pineapple juice to make a nice glaze.  I will make this again.

I made the Pineapple Angel Food Cake for the first time this morning. I used  a "No Name brand" mix and turned out great. Only problem is the mix is a little much for a bundt pan. Okay though. I baked it at 3:50 deg. for 35 minutes. When I inverted it, (with a plate), it pushes the cake down to the rim of the bundt pan and did not fall. I sprayed the pan with cooking spray but not enough. I used a heavy steel bundt pan and maybe the non stick one would be better. Needless to say, it is cooked through and seems very light. I haven't cut ino it as yet. It cooked over the center post so I had to cut that out to get the cake out. The "No Name" brand mix worked good and is cheaper than the name brands. I used the recipe intruction not the box instructions. Thanks for posting that delicious recipe.

This recipe flopped for me. I think the problem was that I used a two-bag cake mix, and it just didn't whip. I wish the recipe had explained that you need a one-bag mix! Now I have to start over, because the cake turned out absolutely flat, except where it erupted in one corner and produced a hole! I can't really rate it properly until I try it again with the right mix.

I don't bake and I wanted a homemade desert for a Luau Party.  This was very easy, foolproof and I was asked by many for the receipe. A nice touch is to save a small portion of the pineapple and put a few pieces on top of the cool whip when serving.

Just a word of caution I used a mixer to mix it and only used the 9x13 pan and that was a HUGH mistake I now have cake all over my oven!! 3 stars only because I made a mess of it will try it again and just mix by hand..

I tried making this cake again last night...my 4th and final attempt.
I had eaten this cake years ago at a hospice volunteer luncheon in Rhode Island and loved it. It was light and fluffy and delicious; baked in a 9 x 13. I asked the nurse for her recipe and my first attempt at this cake turned out correctly. But cakes #2 & #3 turned out far to dense/soggy and #3's center actually fell out of the pan when I turned it upside down to cool   and both were thrown in the trash.
 
Yesterday I came across this post and decided to try it one more time...I had recently purchased a box of name brand 1 step angel cake and crushed pineapple in its own juice (because my DH is diabetic this is the only type of canned fruit I buy).
 
After reading the reviews I decided to add a teaspoon of vanilla, 1/2 cup each of unsweetened flaked coconut and sliced almonds.
I also followed other reviewers suggestions and poured it into my trusty 32 year old angel food cake tube pan. The batter started to bubble up like a science experiment and some even leaked out of the bottom and burnt on the oven floor!! The cake initially rose half way up the sides and then collapsed, it attempted to rise again and almost made it back to the half way mark. I added an extra 10 minutes to the baking time because it did not look done. After removing it from the oven I suspended it over an empty wine bottle (as I always do)until fully cooled.
Again I have a cake that in no way resembles an angel food cake...it's edible,

Can't get any easier than TWO ingredients! Fat-free, too! I made this cake in a tube pan (lightly greased), cooled it upside down, and it still stuck to the pan. It wasn't the most attractive presentation, but I will make it again...in a 13x9!

OMG I made this cake with pinapple in it's own juice and frosted with fat free cool whip.  Wonderful soooooo easy and fat free. Great for dieting.  Also a quick note I made this cake with a fresh pineapple what a mistake that was the cake was runny and I had to throw it out and start over. LOL learned my lesson.  Follow this recipe to the tee and you shouldn't have any problem.

You should never grease a pan when you use an angel food cake recpe.  Perhaps that is why they are not turning out for some of you.  I love this simple recipe and it is very low in weight watcher points.

This is amazingly easy! I am surprised at how "pineappley" it tastes. I made 24 cupcakes and 1 8x8 baking pan from one batch of batter. I topped the 8x8 and half the cupcakes with a broiled coconut icing (1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown 1 cup flaked coconut, 6 tablespoons melted butter, 1/4 teaspoon vanilla, 1/4 cup evaporated milk mixed together and dropped by spoonfuls on top of baked cake and broiled 2-5 mins). I haven't decided yet if I like it better with the icing or plain, they are both good. I had a brainwave and thought I'd try substituting thawed frozen sliced strawberries for the pineapple. It didn't turn out very well... the top scorched before the middle was cooked and it was too sweet. Maybe unsweetened berries would be better.

Easy and delicious! I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and didn't serve it with whipped topping -- doesn't need it! However, I think I will try mixing a small can of drained crushed pineapple with the whipped topping and using it to ice the cake which others have posted. Might add some chopped pecans. This is a definite "go to" recipe!

Excellent.  I baked mine in an angelfood loaf pan and did grease the pan. It took about 45 minutes before it was done.  I turned it upside down untill cool.  The cake turned out perfectly.  Like others, I added a half a cup of coconut to the batter and I frosted the cake with coolwhip and then sprinkled  toasted coconut over the top.  It was so light, moist and delicious.  I will definitely make this one again and again.

THIS IS A VERY DELICIOUS CAKE. EVEN MY HUSBAND CAN MAKE IT. WE'RE DIABETIC, SO WE USE NO SUGAR ADDED PINEAPPLE AND LIQUID. ALSO USE ANGEL FOOD CAKE MIX THAT YOU ONLY NEED TO ADD WATER. DO NOT ADD WATER-THE LIQUID REPLACES IT. VERY MOIST AND YUMMY.   BEEN MAKING THIS FOR OVER 2 YRS. NOW. FAMILY LOVES IT FOR OUR GET TOGETHERS.

We are having an early mother's day lunch tomorrow at my moms.  She is on weight watchers and I saw that this would be the perfect recipe.  I made this into cupcakes because I found out that each cupcake is worth 1 weight watchers point.  Well, one of the cupcakes got stuck when I was trying to take it out after it was cooked.  Not wanting it to go to waste, I ate it:)  It was delish!  Thanks for sharing.

I have been making this since I got it from Weight Watchers and it is always a hit in my house too! SO Good. I like to use coconut on it as part of a tropical feel. You can even use different canned fruits. Pears/ peaches? Sure!

Delicious and super easy!!!  And fat free!!  Did not grease pan--angel food cakes need to adhere to pan so they don't fall.  Also think I cooked a bit longer and next time will put on bottom rack so top doesn't brown too much

This was pretty much perfect.  I made it exactly according to the recipe.  It was light and fluffy and delicious, and literally one of the quickest and easiest things I've ever baked.  Perfect for when people are coming over unexpectedly, because you can always keep the ingredients on hand just in case.

YES...IT IS WONDERFUL..BUT BE SURE TO MAKE IN LARGE BOWL, ALLOW IT TO RISE IN THE BOWL ABOUT 7 MINUTES. THEN POUR INTO 9X13 PAN, ALLOW IT TO RISE AGAIN, TO THE TOP OF THE PAN. BAKE UNTIL GOLDEN ALLOVER THE TOP...I DRAINED AND CHOPPED 1/3-1/2 MARASCHINO CHERRIES SPRINKLED OVER BATTER FOR A COLORFUL PRESENTATION.

SO EASY, SO DELICIOUS AND A WEIGHT WATCHERS EXCHANGE DESSERT.

A REALLY GOOD RRECIPE FOR THOSE LITTLE CHEFS AND BAKERS TO START WITH....

Super easy recipe!!  At first, I wasn't sure if I was to add the pineapple (w/ juice) to the cake batter AND THEN, add the 1 1/4 cup of water that the box had recommended.  Directions didn't exactly say whether to continue to follow the box for the rest of the recipe.

Anyways, no water is needed. Just the pineapple with the juice, which comes to an equivalent of about 1 1/4 cup anyway.  Just add the BETTY CROCKER Angel Food Cake box mix with the pineapple, pineapple juice, 1 tsp of vanilla extract (I did, but never tried w/out it yet so I don't know the difference.)  

Crushed pineapple may be better, but I only had chunks, so I chose to chops the chunks in 1/4ths, so that they could be evenly distributed throughout the batter.

Mix batter at low speed for 30 sec & medium speed for 1 minute (as recommended on the cake box).

GREASE non-stick pan (even the disposable one) with non-stick cooking spray before adding batter.

I didn't quite understand what the cooling part instructions were, regarding the glass or cans people recommended, so after 40 minutes of baking, I easily took a separate cookie pan (ALSO greased) and flipped the cake onto it to cool off. 

The bottom of the cake was still moist, so I immediately put back into oven for another 5 minutes at same temp (350 degrees) to let bottom of cake bake more.  

Once times was up, I pulled it out & placed the original 9 x 13 pan onto the cookie pan and carefully flipped it back over. Tada ! Both sides well cooked.

This recipe is all over Pinterest but none of the links work so I searched here and waalaaa.. here it is!  I love this stuff, almost spongey but not too sweet.  I like to put a bit of low fat whipped cream on top.

I made this recipe today. I was wonderful.  I used the Duncan Hines Angel Food cake mix and made cupcakes.  It baked in about 30 minutes.  My husband and I just ate it with a few fresh strawberries....YUMMY!!! Easiest recipe I ever made.

This is just about the easiest thing anyone can do.  Just rip open a box mix of angel food cake and toss in a 20 oz can of crushed pineapple and mix together by hand.  It becomes nice and fluffy and then put it in a 9 x 13 pan, lightly greased and baked it for 30 minutes at 350.  After it cooled I put a cream cheese frosting on it and it is good but VERY sweet.  I happened to have it on hand.  Next time I'll use the cool whip.  I see in some of the reviews some people have mixed the cool whip with a small pineapple and I don't think that is necessary.  Then others topped it with fresh strawberries.  I really don't think it needs anything else but I might try the strawberries when their in season.  Five stars because it was SO quick and easy and tasty.

So delicious and easy to prepare! I just finished baking this cake, using an electric hand mixer. I sprayed the pan with Pam and baked it for 40 mins. in a 350 F oven. No need to invert the pan to cool! It is wonderful by itself or served with fresh strawberries and "lite" whipped cream :)

I saw a cake posted on FB stating the 2 ingredients were pineapple & angel food cake mix.  While shopping I found that there was no more pineapple left as it had been on sale @ $1/can so I got sliced.  When I got to the cake mix I grabbed the lowest priced one.  Today I did a search for the recipe & was immediately confronted with the 2 pouch mix issue. No bother:  it took some time but I paged through the reviews and found one where another member had confronted the issue w/success and followed her tips.  Take A, add the juice from the can, buzz the pineapple in the blender, wait for stiff peaks, add buzzed pineapple & B mix well, pour into bundt pain & bake at 375 for 40 minutes.  Invert the bundt pan over a long necked bottle & hand until well cooled.  Success!  Finding the bottle to hang the pan from along with your reviewers positive comments about 2 pouches took me the longest!  It was a Margarita mix bottle and I think I'll have one later!  Also have some heavy cream on hand and plan on whipping that well and serving it with that.  Advise:  if you don't know how to cut an angel food cake, learn.  Otherwise it will get smashed down & rubbery.  My late mother taught me to use 2 forks & gently tease apart but the fancy smancy baking shops have a special tool to cut just Angel Food cakes.  I've never used a bread knife but I bet that would work if you gentle sawed & tore without pressing down.  Good luck!

Easy, quick, low fat dessert.  I bake mine in a glass 9x12 dish.  It does not fall and taste moist and delicious.  Thanks to others who posted tips - think I will try some next time.

SO EASY!! Moist and delicious. My oven runs hot so I was fine at 25 minutes and had no falling issues. I would have liked more pineapple and might use try 2 cans next time. Maybe drain the second can. Everyone should try this. I like the coconut suggestions too and will try next time.

My aunt made this last night. We loved it. She topped it the whipped topping with strawberries and blueberries. So good. It will be perfect for a red, white and blue themed 4th of July.

I added some extreme changes to this recipe. Instead of angel food I used boxed cherry chip, mixed in a half a cup of pineapple juice and crushed pineapples and shredded sweetened coconut into the batter. When it was done I spread a layer of crushed pineapples and coconut between then two, then frosted it with cool whip and decorated with more coconut, pineapples, and cherries cut in half. It looked beautiful and everyone was pretty satisfied with it. Definatly would make again, especially for any school cake walks or events.

This cake was soooooo....... good.  Easiest I have ever made and our company loved it.  One word of caution - if using a tube pan 25 minutes is not long enough (the cake was no where near done) follow the package directions and it will be perfect.

I've made this recipe twice. The first time it was perfect...and scrumptious. For that cake, I used a mix with only one package in the box. When my fiancé found out how easy the recipe was he wanted to know why we didn't have this yummy dessert on-hand EVERY day!   The second time, it wasn't so good -- the cake fell a bit flat. I believe I made two mistakes on the second try: 1) I used an Angel food mix that contained two packages in the box 2) I did not put the cake in the oven immediately after pouring the batter into the cake pan.   I'll definitely try this recipe out again, avoiding the mistakes I made the 2nd time. When it works, its a 5-star recipe!

I love this recipe!  It's really easy to make, and it disappears quickly.  I've been asked to bring it to gatherings, and have shared the recipe with several friends.  I add sliced strawberries to the top after it has cooled, and allow guests to add their own amount of whipped topping.  I also supply sliced almonds to sprinkle on top.  Thank you for this recipe!

I love this simple recipe, but the big selling point is that it is low in calories.  I often use low fat or fat free topping.  One thing that the recipe should state is that this only seems to work with a name brand cake mix.  That's very important to your success.

AMAZING!  SIMPLE!  NO FAT!!  I can't thank you enough...  I will now keep these ingredients in my pantry for all eternity.  I didn't bother with the whipped cream topping... it's lovely on it's own.

Yummy-- I brought it to work and they all loved it. I made it in 2 loaf pans and served with Cool Whip. Don't grease the pans for best results on this type of cake.

I have made this cake several times just as the recipe calls for.  This time, I added 1/2 cup of coconut and 1/2 cup of slivered almonds to create a very tropical tasting rendition.  And I used the jumbo muffin tins...no cutting needed!!  I can't wait to take these to work tomorrow.

I made this for my grandfather's birthday because he loves angel food cake.  Everyone loved the pineapple.  I used 8oz. cool whip cause that is what I already had in the freezer, and it was plenty!  I added 1/4 tsp. coconut extract and 3/4 tsp. vanilla.  I also toasted some coconut and sprinkled that on half of the cake.

Was a hit....now I change up....every once in a while. ;)

This is a go to recipe that never fails. I bake, following directions on back of cake box and only spray bottom of baking pan, so cake wont cave in ( angel food usually falls if you do sides). In addition, I add a tsp of rum extract to cool whip and top with toasted coconut. Beautiful and so tasty. You may want to make two, since the first one will be gone very quickly. Quick, easy and delicious!

I tried this because I had a 20 oz. can of pineapple in the cupboard that I wanted to use up. I read all the reviews and so was a little bit concerned about how it would turn out, but decided to go ahead and give it a try. I opened up my generic box of angel food cake mix, only to find that it was the 2-bag mix. I went ahead and whipped up Bag A as directed on the box, and then folded in the entire can of pineapple, juice and all, Bag B from the box and about 1/2 a cup of sweetened, flaked coconut. It filled up my Kitchen-aid mixing bowl completely. I greased my 9 x 13 pan with butter and poured in the batter, it filled the pan completely. I baked it at 350 for what I think was about 40 minutes, but I can't be sure because I forgot what I set the timer to initially... Oops! 
  It raised up about an inch and a half above the pan while baking, and I kept it in there till was a nice darkish golden brown. I set it on a rack, right side up, to cool and it fell just to the level of the pan, not bad at all. I couldn't wait until it cooled completely and had to sneak a piece from the corner and I think it tastes great! It's not too sweet, but if you're having angel food cake you're not really getting super sweet anyway, in my opinion. You could always add some sweetened berries to top it off, but we're going to eat it just the way it is! Yummy!

I made this recipe in a Bundt cake pan, cooled it upside down, than put it on a plate, and drizzled Betty Crocker Chocolate (in the can) frosting on top of it, it was real good and got alot of thumbs up,lol! I will be making this again as one of my desserts for Easter.

I can't leave well enough alone, so after putting the mix in the 9"x13" pan I sprinkle shredded coconut and sliced almonds on the cake and gently press them into the cake.  This helps the almonds stick to the cake.  A family favorite and my 9 and 13 year old grandchildren love baking this cake.

Just saw this online today.....where the heck have I been??
Made it for lunch and it was delicious. Will definitely make it again. So quick and easy. Made mine in a glass 9x13 pan and baked it 35 minutes.

The mix I had was two-part, an egg mixture and a flour mixture. We combined those two envelopes of stuff with a wisk, then combined gently but thoroughly with the pineapple. Unfortunately, it flopped completely. The flavor was good, but this was not "cake" at all, but rather a dense and wet layer with a slightly lighter pineapple layer on top. If we make this again, I will find a one-part angelfood mix instead!

Love this!  It has turned out great every time. It's great for potlucks and short-notice dessert time.  Super moist and yummy without being gooey. I sprayed nonstick cooking spray on the bottom of my 9 x 13 pan before pouring in the cake mix to bake because it is a little sticky after being in the pan for a while.

I have made it for us & also for a bake sale. Was meant for a 9x13 pan not Angel food pan. I just mix mine right in the baking pan - did not the grease pan. Store it in the frig.

There is a very VERY important thing to note about this cake...
THIS CAKE CAN NOT BE MADE WITH THE TYPE OF CAKE MIX THAT HAS TWO BAGS.  
My cake was an EPIC failure.  I removed a hockey puck from the pan. 
I will try making it again as I have had this cake before and I like it but I will have to make sure I look at the package instructions before buying the cake mix.

I just took this out of my ungreased, nonstick bundt pan and I have to say that it looks and smells FABULOUS!!!!  I baked it for 40 minutes which gave it beautiful golden brown top and cooled it completely, upside down on soup cans.  I can't wait to taste it :)

I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out perfectly. I think some of the comments are due to variations in ovens and their temps. One thing I may try next time is to crumble flour/butter,cinnamon and sugar mixture and spread on top of batter. To me it could be a real easy pineapple upside down cake!

I just made this and it tastes decent but looks rather weird.  I was intrigued because it's very low cal, low fat and a perfect sweet treat for watching nutrition/diet.  I used a nonstick pan, but still lightly greased it to make sure it wouldn't stick ... good plan.  It was very golden brown after 25mins, and I let it go for another 5 just to be sure ... another good plan.  I immediately cooled upside down on a wire rack and the cake popped out with no problem.  It is not a pretty sight, but it tastes pretty good.  The side of the cake that cooked on the bottom of the pan is pretty white and looks shiny.  The bottom is golden brown and the edges are curled up.  I think I'll tear this into pieces and served topped with some sliced strawverries and blackberries.  If taking this somewhere and you care what it looks like, definitely plan on topping it with something to disguise the weirdness.  Overall:  I'd make it again because it tastes good.

Extremely easy, delicious, and the perfect low fat treat.  It took more than 25 min to bake...more like 37 - 40 minutes.  Very moist too.  We will make this again!

Well, it was very tasty.  However, it fell right out of the angel cake tube pan I used when I went to cool it upside down.  I just had to smoosh it into another pan and smother it with whipped topping after it was cool.  Maybe next time I'll use the regular pan...

I used the 2-bag mix and a can of chunk pineapple: 

First, I saved the pineapple juice and gave the chunks a whirl in the food processor. Next, I mixed bag-1 with the juice and just when it was starting to get thick, my mixer died! Booo :(  so I just dumped in the processed pineapple, and gave it a quick mix. After that, I dumped in bag-2 all at once and mixed it a couple times with a whisk. 

I baked this in 2, 9x9 non-stick pans with NO GREASE. Came out awesome! Fluffier than I thought, too. I was expecting a lot of density from not being able to whip up the mix properly. Not the case! 

I should mention, I reserved about 1/3 c of the pineapple to add to the whipped topping. I forgot I had reserved it (duh!) and topped instead with strawberries. Nice and light (even the HUGE piece I ate). Will make again soon!

I bake an angel food cake every week.  Since it is fat free and both hubby and I have each lost 50 pounds, we want to keep it off.  And angle food cake is a real treat.   Adding pineapple was/is fantastic.  And can I say just so darn simple.   It does sink a bit, but nothing terrible. Thank you very much for the recipe.

To dress up the cake I cook in bundt cake pan. I add sliced strawberries mixed w/small amount of gel in middle and put dollops of cool whip with a strawberry around the top. Everyone loves this cake in the summer and it is VERY Easy to make.

The Best dessert I have had in a long time. I added some coconut as some have suggested, added 10 minutes to the time and baked it in a tube pan. It came out beautiful and tasted wonderful. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This cake was soooo light and tasty. I did make a few changes though. First I greased and used a 9 x 13 pan. Then, I mixed in 2 tsp of vanilla extract with the cake mix and pineapples. 25 minutes in the oven was perfect for me. After the cake cooled, I mixed a package of instant sugar free vanilla pudding (just the powder) in with the cool whip before spreading it over the cake! It was very moist! Quick to make in a pinch and perfect for a hot summer day!

It is a bit denser then traditional angel food cake... but I liked it.  My cake did not fall. This is the method/changes I made:  -Drained the Pineapple, discarded (drank) the juice -Added 1 cup of Mango nectar (other reviewers complained of lackluster flavors- this worked, it is totally flavorful!) - Baked on 350 for 30 min. The top is a bit more brown then  normal, but my cake is perfectly cooked. Any less time would have been too less. -Cooked upside down (helps prevent falling during the cool down time)  Some tips:  -Don't over beat, this will cause an even more dense cake. I hand folded the mix together and then whipped for about 40 seconds -Cooling upside down is important, try not to hit or bang the pan around, that will cause it to fall faster   I gave this four stars because it was VERY easy and VERY quick. I knocked a star off because it is a temperamental cake that needs tweaking.   P.S. I plan on serving this with mango fool.

Excellent! I only made 2 changes to the recipe: I followed the suggestion to add vanilla to the cake, and I used "real" whipped cream instead of cool whip. It received rave reviews both times I served it. A keeper!

I agree with other reviewers that you need to use the cake mix that doesn't require mixing 2 bags. That was the only kind I had on hand and so I used it anyway. Instead of mixing the cake mix with water like the instructions on the box, I mixed it with the pineapple juice. The cake (as others had mentioned) turned out flat but I made two pans and stacked them together. After it cooled, I put a layer of cream cheese frosting in between the 2 layers and then heated the rest of the frosting in a pan and drizzled a glaze over the cake. It turned out extraordinarily well and my friends were impressed with the presentation. I only give it 4 stars because it took so much improvisation from the original recipe.

What an easy reicpe!  Instead of a 9x13 pan I used one loaf pan and also made 24 cupcakes (using the one box).  I used the cooking times listed on the back of the box.  In addition to the whipped topping I topped both with toasted cocount and maraschino cherries.  Yummy and very attractive.  It was a hit at a mother's day function and it looked far more involved than it was.

This cake has a lot of flavor for so few ingredients. The pineapple makes it light and refreshing. I made this for a bridal shower and received lots of compliments. I precut small pieces of the cake and garnished each with pineapple tidbits to make it look pretty. No one could believe it was so easy to make. 

You know, this is pretty lo-cal for cake, and if you use the "Free" cool whip, it's even fat free! You'd never know it from all the flavor though.

This cake is delicious!  I tried it without the cool whip because I didn't have any.  My husband loved it too!  Thanks Donna!

I'm giving this 5 stars even though it didn't quite turn out for me.  It definitely has potential!  I baked mine for 25 minutes, but the cake fell when it cooled.  I think I should have baked it a little longer.  It tasted very good, but next time I'll add a few minutes on to the baking time.  It is such a moist cake that it was hard to tell if it was done using a toothpick.  This recipe is definintely a keeper!

This couldn't be simpler and yet tastes wonderful.  I actually used it as a "base" for strawberry shortcake & topped it with Cool Whip.  So very yummy!

The first time I tried this recipe I used a store brand angel food cake mix that has two bags of ingredients in the box.  DO NOT MAKE THIS MISTAKE.  We did eat the cake but it was about 1 inch thick and very chewy!  So then I read the reviews.  I made another cake today with Betty Crocker angel food cake mix instead. I did use a hand held mixer to blend the ingredients as one reviewer suggested.  I used a 9"/13" oblong cake pan with no cooking spray or grease of any kind. When the cake came out I inverted the cake pan on some ceramic coasters to let it cool.  After it cooled I went around the edge of the pan with a kitchen knife.  The cake came out of the pan just fine.  It was very fluffy and light.  It did seem a bit hard to cut pieces because the top wanted to crumble a bit.  I just used a sharp knife to finish cutting--not a table knife.  I will make this cake again.  Very tasty and low calorie count!  Success at last!

Great dessert. Used Duncan Hines angel food cake mix, 19 oz can of no name brand crushed pineapple plus 1 oz water (instructions call for 20 oz can of pineapple); beat together all ingredients on medium speed for 1.5 minutes in my Kitchen Aide mixer; poured into lightly sprayed (with Pam) 9 x 13 glass cake pan; baked for 35 minutes at the recommended 350 F. Placed on a wire rack to cool (did not invert). Turned out perfectly. When cool, covered with Cool Whip and refrigerated for about 6 hours. Served with sliced strawberries (2 cups) that were marinated in Grand Marnier (2 tablespoons) for about 6 hours. Will definitely make this again. Thanks to everyone who provided tips - very helpful!

Quick, easy and delicious. Easy to keep ingredients on hand. I did as recommended and cooked it a little longer. I also cooled it upside down. 
I will definitely make it again and again.

I had the ingredients on hand and made this for a quick, light dessert for guests. I used a 10 inch springform pan and baked it about 40 minutes. I sprinkled a handful of sweetened coconut on top before baking which helps make a nice tan "crust" on top. Release the spring form when it is cool and cover with foil until ready to serve. Easy, and our guests appreciated a light dessert after a nice meal. Thanks for sharing!

Got this recipe from my sister-in-law years ago and I use it all the time. Have given this to many people. This is good for diabetics also. If you are having unexpected company and have these ingredients on hand you can greet your guests, throw this in the oven. It makes your home smell fabulous, gives a lite but tasty treat and minimal clean up after. This makes for smiles all around !

I love this recipe A great stand by. My kitchen always has at least 1 box of Angel Food Cake Mix and a 20 ounce can of crushed pineapple. I always make mine in a tube pan. DO NOT GREASE THE PAN.Put it together and when it comes out of the oven hang the pan on something so that it can cool upside down. I use the same glass bowl that I mix the batter in If you have ever made ANGEL FOOD CAKE DO WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR YEARS. There is another Angel food recipe that uses canned Pumpkin, it is awesome also.

So easy and it turned out very nice. I put the 1 step angel food cake mix in my mixer with the crushed pineapple. Beat on low for 2-3 minutes and put in my bundt pan that I did spray with pan spray. I baked for 40 minutes at 350 and then inverted it to let it cool. It still stuck some in my pan so next time, and there will be a next time soon, will be baked in my angel food pan.  It was for my grandsons birthday and he was delighted. I didn't tell him how easy it was to make but the hugs were big.

I made this tonight and it turned out WONDERFUL! I followed the directions exactly as it was written and it came up beautifully in 25 minutes!  I did follow one persons advice and used the electric mixer for 1 1/2 minutes so I don't know if that had anything to do with it or not.  Regardless, this is a 5 star recipe....almost too easy!

I just tried this for the first time this morning and it turned out great. I used a Pillsbury cake mix and pineapple, put it in a ungreased 9 x 13 inch glass pan and baked it for 30 minutes.  It is awesome and so quick to make and didn't stick to the pan.  I don't know why you would need to grease the pan. When you make a regular angel food cake, greasing the pan is not required.  Next time I will do it in an angel food cake pan.  Thanks!

So yummy.  Light and fluffy with almost a mashmellowy taste to it.  Only thing I would suggest is to NOT invert it to cool.  I did so and a few seconds later I heard a shloooorp and my whole cake was on the counter.  I did spray the pan so I guess it was really NOT sticking.  I just carefully picked the whole cake up and put it back in the pan. It was fine.  Didn't collapse and was still fluffy.  FYI - I used Duncan Hines brand cake mix.

I read tons and tons of reviews on this and thought it couldn't go wrong. It rose beautifully, I flipped it, it stayed intact and smelled awesome. After it was done and I took it out of the pan, THEN it fell (and I cooked it 40 minutes instead of 25.) The very center of it on the bottom did not come out with the rest of the cake (no idea why.) And the flavor - I did not like it! Neither did my son or my husband (and we LOVE pineapple.) I'm not sure what happened (I did not add anything else besides the mix and the pineapple in its juices.) My mom and brother in law said it was great with the cool whip but I think that was because it masked the flavor. I hate to say it but I don't think I try it again.

This cake is delicious with 1 teaspoon of almond extract added to mixture.  The next time I make it I think I will add cherries for color.  And I did lightly grease the pan.

I'm on a diet (have lost 55 lbs), but I have a really big sweet tooth.  So my friend made this for me for my birthday cake using fat free cool whip.  To be honest, it tasted great and didn't even notice she used fat free cool whip. This definitely will be on my list of easy desserts to make for sure and I will try it w/ coconut!  She said it was so easy to make with just 3 ingredients. She used a greased 9 x 13 pan and it came out just fine.

This cake definitely fell for me, following original direction.  Might try it again but with whipped cream and strawberries.  Quite spongy and not like an angel food cake.  Disappointed in this.

I made for the first time tonight and it was excellent.  Very moist yet not heavy and so low fat!  I skipped the whipped topping casue we are all dieting here but I did add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and almond extract to the mix before baking.  Everyone loved it!

This cake is super easy! At first, after I mix the crushed pineapple into the cake mix using hand mixer, I thought it looks too "foam" rich and it became double in size. I was worried that I made a mistake. Fortunately, after I bake it for like 20-ish minutess, it came out very pretty! I made into 2 layers. But the taste was kind of "sharp" when I tried it warm. So I refrigerate them, spread whipped topping,and refrigerate again. I serve it cold. Everybody just LOVE it! :)

I didn't love this the way I hoped i would.  It needed a lot more time to cook all the way through (at least 40 minutes) and it still collapsed somewhat when I took it out of the oven.  It totally stuck to the pan and we scooped it out rather than inverting the pan and slicing.  It was very healthy for dessert and tasted ok, but I was hoping for more.

All I can say is YUM! I LOVE that it's light in both senses of the word... it was even better the next day after the pineapple had a chance to moisten the cake a bit more! I served each piece with a dollop of the whipped topping rather than "icing" the entire cake. My dinner guests loved it. Followed the recipe exactly... and used LOTS of PAM spray on the pan to make sure it didn't stick. Had no problems...

Excelent cake. I took it to a pot luck at a diet group I belong to. Everyone loved it. Don't expect a dence cake, it is very light and fluffy. If you take it for what it is, a diet cake you will be very happy, and so will your friends.

My husband loves pineapples and sponge cake so I made this for his birthday. Atleast we now know we hate angel-food cake. It tastes sour and weird and synthetic. Will never attempt this again!

I would never have made this without seeing the positive reviews.  It is wonderful.  I added 1/2 C coconut as suggested by other reviewers.  I also served it with some thawed frozen raspberries.  With the few ingredients, it is a great "to go" recipe.

A really nice and light treat that my girlfriends all loved! I also loved how easy it was! I used the 2-bag mix b/c that was all I could find at the store, but it still worked out fine.  I would like to add coconut per previous reviews next time I make it. The only tip I'd recommend is to make sure to distribute the pineapple chunks throughout the batter after pouring into the pan. They won't all settle to the bottom quite as much this way. :-)

I have had this cake before and it is delicious. However, I have not made it until today. I used an angel food cake pan and turned it upside down immediately out of the oven. I let it cool for 30 min. When I took the pan off, it fell. Apparently baking it for 25 min. in an angel food pan is not enough. Try 35 minutes instead. I did not have a 9 x 13 pan as submitter suggested and everything I've read says not to grease the pan. I'll try again baking it longer. I wouldn't be so disappointed if it weren't for someone's birthday cake.

This is a five-star for ease and taste.  It's so simple & done really quick and the taste is perfect!  Thanks for this super quick, tasty recipe.  I'll keep some angel food cake and canned pineapple on hand in case someone gets a sweet tooth we can whip this up in a snap!

I've made this a couple times and I must say, its pretty good!

The only problems I had were timeing on the oven and I had to "push the cake down" with a spatchula(sp?) while it cooked.

My grandma requested it for her birthday.

The angle food cake mix I purchased had two envelopes, an egg white and a cake flour.  I only had a can of chunk pineapple, so I put that in my blender. I beat the pineapple with the egg white and then folded in cake flour.  I made 31 cupcakes with this recipe (350 degrees for 16 minutes) filling the paper liners almost full.  They are very tasty and moist.  Thanks!

This was ok. I used the same measurements, but used canned apricots in pear juice instead of pineapple (it was what was on hand). The flavor of the fruit didnt really come through strongly, and the juice made the already super sweet angel food cake even sweeter. All the fruit sunk to the bottom, making it almost like an upsidedown cake-- but that also meant some of the bottom was soggy and stuck to the bundt pan i baked it in. No prob tho- just stuck it under the broiler until golden and the pieces i had stuck on looked like a natural part of the cake. Good for a quick recipe when you need a cake. GREAT with whipped cream (fat free) and jam!!! o yea, the cooking time was longer- more like 38 minutes.

My family absolutely loves this cake. It is so cool and refreshing. I still can't beleive  how simple it is.

Easy and delicious. Just be sure to use a glass or metal bowl for mixing and that all utensils are grease free. Do not grease the pan. Do not undercook, and invert the pan to cool or else the middle may fall. I serve with whipped cream or whipped topping and make the Supreme Strawberry Topping from this site to go along with it. It’s good all it’s own, too!

This cake was so delicious! I made it in a 9x13 glass pan. I saw on tv once that to get an airy angel food cake, you’re not supposed to grease the pan, bc the cake climbs up the sides and can’t do that if it’s greased. I didn’t grease my pan. After I pulled it out, I cooled it in the pan upside down (no it didn’t fall out! Lol) until the bottom of the pan was cool enough for me to hold my hand to it. I did so by inverting two small pots, and while upside down I positioned the pan handles over the bottoms of the pots. Yes, when cutting it stuck a bit but when I say that, I just mean some of the brown outer layer is left behind, not actual chunks of cake. It was so tender and sweet, perfect subtle pineapple flavor and then you get a piece of fruit and it’s perfectly soft. I just dolloped cool whip right on top. 10/10 would make again!!

Excellent cake and so easy to make! I agree with others,  do not grease your pan.  I mixed this with a mixer and had much fluffier batter, then I did turn it over to cool.   I topped this with a frosting of cool whip, a package of vanilla pudding mix, and a small can of crushed pineapple with the juice.  So easy and yet  so beautiful to serve company!

This was really easy to make, especially when using Betty Crocker’s angel food cake mix.  I made it twice, in a 9x13 and as a bundt cake.  The 9x13 didn’t cut out very well, so I turned it into a trifle, with strawberries, vanilla pudding, and homemade whipped cream.  That tasted amazing and was gobbled up pretty quickly.

I love this cake! I make mine in a bundt pan just because I think it's prettier. I also make homemade whipped cream and add a small can of crushed pineapple to it because I really like Pineapples! Can't go wrong with this one.

Delicious! I added about half a cup of shredded coconut as per some reviewers' suggestion and had to bake it for longer than the recipe indicated, but it was perfect. I also neglected to use topping, and it was fine as is. Stays moist for a couple days. I'll definitely be making this again.

25 minutes is not enough baking time for this cake -- I give it closer to 35, and it comes out great every time.   In fact I enjoy it so much, I don't even bother with the whipped topping.   It's perfect for snacking out of hand, just as it is!

I added the coconut as some people suggested and it turned out great. I used a 9x13 ungreased glass pan  and then inverted it (with two upside down small bowls under the handles) when cooling. Turned out great!!!

I made this in a 9x13 pan and it worked just fine, but no matter what vessel you use, do NOT grease it. Even the directions on the box of cake mix state not to 'slicken' it up! I followed the baking directions on the box and had it in the oven for about 50 minutes. It was cooled upside down and was a wonderful, light cake.

I made this twice the same day both which flopped.  The first one I greased a tube pan and when I turned it over to cool it just fell out . the cake fell so was all gooey. went and bought another mix and can of pineapple, did not grease the pan this time, baked it for h 1 hour and 10 minutes at 350 to make sure it was cooked . it also fell out  and the cake had fallen down also.  won't be making this again.

I made cupcakes out of the batter and used paper cupcake liners and this resolved the issue of the cake sticking to the pan.  I filled the cupcake liners halfway and then added about a tsp. of strawberry jam and topped it off with more batter before baking. YUM! Also added 1/2 cup of unsweetened coconut flakes to the batter and it gave it a chewy texture and yummy hint of coconut flavour. Baked for roughly 30 minutes. Make sure the cupcakes tops are a deep golden brown colour before taking out of the oven.

This is one Delish, Moist cake!  The only thing I do different is when done (& it Has to be Done!).....when you take it out of the oven is...place a wire rack on top ...&... Invert it carefully to cool!!!  It won't sink in the middle!  
And, if you want, a tsp. of vanilla or almond extract, when you mix it.  
My whole family loves this cake!  I only put a nice helping of whipped cream on it when I serve it....yes, it blows the fat -free dessert, but, it's too Yummy!
Oh, Don't use the 2 bag angel food mix!....for some reason, it just doesn't work!

Wonderful.  You can bake it in any size pan from a 4 x 6 loaf pan to a 9 x 13 glass casserole dish...even in a large Polish stoneware mixing bowl.  I sometimes add some toasted coconut to the batter.  There is almost no end to the canned fruits that could be used so long as you use a 20 oz can that contains about 2/3 chopped fruit and 1/3 juice liquid.

I used Betty Crocker 1 bag mix. I made it exactly as shown & it came out perfect. I did bake it 5 minutes longer. I took it to a meeting & everyone loved it. I did not use any topping as it was sweet enough. Wonderful low-cal dessert.

I made this today and the taste was very good.  I'm not sure what I did wrong but when I removed it from the oven, it was lofty and while it was cooling, it sank.  Not a pretty sight but it didn't affect the taste.  I would make this again and maybe bake it in a tube pan or a bundt pan with hopefully better results.

I was concerned that this recipe wouldn't turn out after reading the contradictory reviews.  However, it was very easy and refreshing!  I GREASED a 9x13 glass dish.  Mixed for 1-2 minutes like the box said with an electric mixer.  Also used just a one bag mix.  Baked for longer than instructed at 40 MINUTES (although my oven does tend to undercook).  I cooled this on the counter WITHOUT turning upside down.  Worked great, without sticking to the dish.  Will make again!!

I made this as directed (baked a little longer) but otherwise as directed.  It turned out perfect in the pan. I topped it with fresh berries and light cool whip.  My issue is that it is just not that great.  Something is missing it just didn't taste like much of anything and not sweet enough to satisfying that sweet tooth.  I know it is supposed to be a low calorie dessert and that is what I wanted but I think I would rather have one small piece of something really good  and flavorful than a piece of something that just doesn't satisfy.  I tossed the last two pieces, low cal or not, I didn't want it, hubby didn't want it and I would not make it again.

First time I had this was at my sister's home.  She opted for slightly sweetened, chopped fresh strawberries and the whipped topping.  Omigosh!  Like strawberry shortcake with a twist.  I love this recipe.  Not too bad for my diet.  Delicious and refreshing.

Prepared exactly as recipe called for did not work for me. It was still raw at 25 minutes. I baked it longer, checking it at 3 minute intervals. When I thought it was done, toothpick came out clean, but there were sections that were still raw. Might be my oven, but I have never had any problems baking anything else.

I absolutely love this cake. It doesn't need to be mixed for too long, as over-mixing does ruin it (trial run was a disaster). I used two greased loaf pans and baked longer than recommended, until it didn't feel gooey anymore, although still a little sticky to the touch. I just cooled them in the pan as is. This cake is delicious. I usually make it for my dogs birthday, since it's safe for her to eat too.

Made the cake exactly as directed and baked for 30 minutes and it was perfect.  I Did not invert the pan when cooling the cake. I only mixed the cake mix and pineapple enough to blend it completely maybe 1 minute. The center did not rise and it did not fall.  We topped ours with fresh whipped cream and everyone was happy!

I havea tried this recepie and use it alot and no one has complained except the ones that don't like pineapple.  I use sugar free cool whip with it.  I have taken this cake to several different occassions and every one liked it. It is so simple that it is almost as good as the marshmallow cake. You could also drizzle it with a glaze if you wanted to.

After reading all the reviews, I made this and turned it upside down to cool.  It immediately broke apart and out of the pan.  Smells wonderful, though.  I'm going to put it in a pretty bowl, add some fruit and whipped cream, and call it a truffle.  :-)

just made this and it came out excellent! I had the 2 pouch cake 
mix so I followed the directions on the cake mix box and treated the pineapple as water. Mixed up really well that way, I baked it for 35 minutes and think it was just slightly over baked so I would check it at 30 minutes. I cooled it upside down and did not grease the pan. Everything came out fine.

Super simple dessert. Mixed it together and by the time dinner was over and cleaned up we had a nice dessert. I do think it might have benefited from a few minutes longer just to golden brown a bit more on the top.

This tasted great and it was totally easy but it didn't foam like I thought it would, as a result it didn't raise.  I was disappointed but I am going to give it another try.  I did add about 1/2 cup of coconut to this recipe and the taste was great. Will try again as I love the colata taste. Thanks for this recipe.

This is the easiest thing ever!  We loved it.  The second time I made it I divided the mix up between two 8x8 pans.  Once cooled, I poked holes in the cakes and poured cooled orange gelatin mix over the cakes. Super yummy!

Super fast, easy, and delicious!  I baked mine in a bundt pan, sprayed with PAM, in a 350 degree convection oven.  After 20 min's it was still wobbly on top so I baked it for another 10 mins and it was perfectly browned and firm to the touch.
I also added, as some suggested, coconut and toasted pecans, about a 1/4 cup of each.  The next time I make it, I will chop up some maraschino cherries and throw them it the mix.

My new favorite dessert - I was looking for a quick treat and had a Duncan Hines Angel Food cake and pineapple tidbits (not crushed) in my pantry.  I greased my 9 x 13 pan, sprinkled the cake mix into the pan.  I drained off the juice, mixed it in to the cake mix and then sprinkled the tidbits over the batter and baked for 30 minutes.  I cooled the pan upside down and mixed up some Dream Whip topping (not entirely necessary).

It was a luscious treat!!!

I made the cake just like the recipe calls for and it was very yummy....we topped it with a little light Cool Whip and just a sprinkling of toasted coconut.  Will make again.

Thought I would try this after eyeing for awhile from WW.  It's pretty good for someone who doesn't like pineapples that much.  I'm glad I used 8oz of crushed pineapples because it had enough pineapple taste to it.  I added at least 1/2 or (more ?) cups of water.

I used a 9 x 13 pan and it overflowed.  Was golden brown but still fell.
A little to sweet.

Just made this cake and it turned out well.  I did put brown sugar on the bottom of the pan which added a bit of sweetness. Next time though I will put melted butter in the pan, covered with brown sugar then the batter.  Will make it more like a pineapple upside down cake.  It cooked perfectly in the amount of time specified.  Will definitely make it again.

So I made this and saw that someone else had used an angel food pan so I thought I would try that way. It didn't work for me as the batter rose and spilled out all over my oven, burning. I am sure if I had used the 9x13, it wouldn't have been a problem. I also used real whipped cream and it is so delicious.

Just made this. So easy and delicious. It definitely needs more than 25 minutes baking. Next time, I will turn the oven off and leave in about 5+ more minutes. Absolutely cool it upside down. Came out beautifully. Need something for next month meeting. Think I will mix a small can of pineapple with the cool whip, cut up the cake and gently fold with the cool whip mixture in a trifle dish.

Well I think I made the mistake of getting the "two bag" cake mix... mine ended up very flat.  But I have to say it tasted good! LOL! I can't wait to try it with the one bag cake mix - I think that will make a world of a difference.  My husband enjoyed it - even though it was flat and kinda rubbery.  I topped it with sliced sweetened strawberries and whipped cream.  Will try again with the other cake mix, and edit my rating then :)

I made this, and I am sorry but this was not as good as it has been rated. Yes it is super easy, but that is about it. It was rubbery and chewy....not something me or my family found tasty at all. I am all for trying new things, and maybe for some this was great, but I will definetly not be making this "easy cake" again.

I am rating this 4 stars based on the way it was written. What I ended up with was more along the lines of 6 stars. I made mine as a two layer cake and followed the advice of the other reviewers adding shredded coconut. Between the layers I placed a layer of coolwhip and coconut, then topped the cake with sweetened coconut pineapple tidbits and marachino cherries (those as a garnish). Without the coconut and extra pinapple I don't think it would have been nearly as good. I agree with others this is a great base recipe and with some flare can be awesome.

I have not yet made this cake but will this weekend when I have guests.   Today at Weight Watchers one of the members brought the cake in for us to try.   MMMMMMM and more MMMMMMM.   Delish, moist, satisfying.    And only 3 points on WW.  Will make this many times.   I will leave off the whipped topping on my slice.

This is a great fat-free & cholesterol-free dessert.  My husband has to limit his fat/cholesterol intake so he can't have most desserts.  Even though he doesn't really care for angel food cake, he does like this one because it is more dense and less airy.  It doesn't have an overwhelming pineapple taste.  We serve it like strawberry shortcake - with frozen strawberries, thawed & chopped.  Very tasty and my husband can even have a second serving if he wants.

I forgot about this recipe until my friend mentioned angel food cake one day. I had to find a recipe for temperature directions. I made this as directed and the center of my cake fell out of the pan when I flipped it over. Making another one as I type this and I didn't spray the pan this time. Hope it works. Cake is easy and delicious!

Great, simple recipe! I paired it with the whipped cream recipe from this site and it was delicious! I used 2- 9" loaf pans and one of my cakes fell a bit but they both still tasted great. Next time I will try it with a bunt pan for a prettier look.

I love this recipe - the first time I found out about it was from a guy who came to one of our parties waaaaay back in 1992.  We were all impressed, since guys who could cook were not the norm.  When he shared his recipe - we were even more impressed!  Thank you for reminding me of this recipe!!

AMAZING. I would give this 10 stars if I could! I made this because I needed a healthy dessert for Weight Watchers, but diet or no diet, this is my new favorite dessert. The cake is so soft and fluffy and sweet - I never would have imagined it would come out so great! If you want, put a dollop of fat free cool whip on top, but it's definitely great alone as well. I made it in a 9x13 pan, which gave me about 12 servings.

Made this for my boyfriends birthday, I got a little carried away and used 2 packages of Angel Food mix...so I had an extra cake which I took to work to share with my coworkers. It was gone before 10am!

VERY EASY with a nice fresh taste but it was a bit chewy and the pineapple was a bit dry...maybe more water besides the pineapple juice would help....  this is a GREAT recipe for on the go and will be a crowd pleaser for any event...really now who doesn't like pineapple?

Absolutely SIMPLE & now my favorite. I took advice of other reviewers and I turned off the oven at 25 min but I left in for another 5. It was sticky in the bunt pan but I took a butter knife and gently ran down the sides..... I also added coconut to this recipe and WOW. Thank you so much for submitting the recipe!

I'm still not too sure about this recipe. The flavor is pretty good, but the texture is so odd. The pineapple doesn't seem to add enough flavor to make it worth having those little bits in the cake. I made these to take to work, but I'm not sure they're quite good enough to give out. That equals 3 stars for me. Thanks!

I thought this could have baked a little longer also.  However, this was an easy, cheap, quick and somewhat healthy treat to have around the house.  I don't know if I'd make it for a party but it's a nice after-dinner treat on a weeknight!

Great cake for sugar lovers - it was much too sweet! I tried topping it with sliced strawberries & Coolwhip - good, but still too sweet. Probably will not make it again.

I'm only giving this 3 stars because I was so disappointed that my cake fell. The flavor seemed good though so maybe I will try to make this again. I did take heed of the other reveiwers comments and bought the angel food cake mix that was suggested, but I still had drastic results. Next time I might try it in a couple of loaf pans as was noted by someone else.

Easiest cake ever! Instead of using whipcream on the top, I made a package of instant vanilla pudding, and spread it on the top, then sprinkled it with coconut. Ive already made this 3times in the last 2weeks as EVERYONE raves about it!

This was excellent.  Although I'm not sure 25 minutes was long enough as it sunk in the middle.  May try to cook it a little longer next time.  There will definately be a next time!!!

This cake was delicious & so EASY. I made it in two 8x8 pans and did add extra time for them to cook. They turned out perfect. I don't care at all for Coolwhip so Fat Free whip cream is what I tried. I preferred the cake without. I like pineapple and think next time I will add a bit of a pineapple topping. This recipe is as good and easy as A spice cake mix and a can of pumpkin, for a great Pumpkin cake.

This was pretty good, hubby liked it but definately wasn't blown away by it.  I think it might be better with some type of frosting instead of the whipped topping.  Very easy though, so for that I'll probably hang on to the recipe.  Thanks!

Because its 'cheating' using a box mix I gave it four stars.  Otherwise it was a nice change from plain angel food cake, helping use up canned pineapple (hey, its fruit kids!) but I didn't use the whipped topping, just sieved some powdered sugar over the top. It makes for a nice presentation and if you are in a pinch it will do just fine.

I made this for my fiancees birthday cause he likes pinapple cake. I used a 9x13 pan and the cake did not cook all the way the center was soggie. I think if I try it again I will cook it in a angel food cake pan or bunt pan the way angel food cake is normally made.

Babyboomer, I don't know what you're yapping about, because I took you're advice and thie cake came out awfully! The yogurt burned and it bacame an ugly brown. After my failed attempt, I tried it again, WITHOUT yogurt. It was SOOOOO lovely! It managed to be moist but not soggy and it  had the perfect, tropical taste you would expect from a cake. Tip: to make it prettier, add the top of the pineapple( the spiky part ) to the middle of the cake as an unedible decoration.

I was expecting something fabulous after reading the reviews.  I can say it was "just ok". My cake fell a bit in the middle whe it was cooling. It was a little "blah". Maybe pineapple in the whipped topping as other people have sugessted.  I am glad I tried it out on my family before bring to pot luck at work.

Great recipe!  I made it in a pan that makes a shallow ring around the cake and filled it with the topping (fat-free cool whip, pineapple jello (not completely set) and coconut.  Husband loved it.

Sorry guys, but I really didn't like this recipe. Maybe it was the cake mix I bought, but it didn't really work. It was sticky and gooey and generally not nice.  It was ok the first day, but afterwards it was worse.  I agree that it was really easy, but I didn't think it was worth even that minimal effort.

We have a winner!! This could not be easier or quicker and taste as light and delightful! Even my non-liking pineapple son enjoyed it. I served it with light cool whip and strawberries for a very Weight Watcher friendly dessert. Thank you for a very nice recipe!

This recipe was very simple which I liked.  It was kind of hard to cut and get out of the pan, but other than that, it was very tasty and my husband liked it a lot because he is a pineapple freak.  We had it without a topping which was fine.  I would make it again.

This may be the easiest recipe I have ever made in my life! It came out so moist. And it's fat free!! I topped some of the cake with fresh mango and Cool-Whip. YUM! I'll definitely make this again.

This is the perfect recipe for those of us on diets wanting a special treat.  I really could not believe how good it tasted with so few ingredients.  It reminded me of "wedding cake."  I will definitely make this again.

I've made this so many times over many years and don't know how I've managed not to review it til now. We love this cake! Light and refreshing, absolutely delicious. So simple! Spray a 9x13 pan, mix angel food cake mix and pineapple for a couple of mins, pour in the pan, bake, and you're done! I just leave my cake in the pan it cooks in, then cover it and refrigerate after it cools. I use the Pillsbury angel food cake mix and have never had any problems with this recipe.

We always buy a couple of extra cans of crushed pineapple and at least two containers of cool whip. I drain and save the juice from the extra cans for something else, then mix the pineapple with the cool whip and use that to top each serving of cake. Makes a wonderful difference!

If you want something fast and easy  this  is a good option.  I have been on a diet and this is a dessert that is probably a better choice than a cake with icing.  I will use this one again.

It’s easy to make and even tastes good without the cool whip topping.

Made as directed. Disaster! Made in a 9x13 pan;. batter boiled over in the oven. Had to cut off rough edges before frosting. Cake sagged in the center. It was to be for a potluck. Salvaged several pieces to take. The 2 stars are for the taste.

This cake was very easy.  I made it in a tub pan, lightly greased.  I added some coconut flakes to mixture.  I also added vanilla extract to the frosting.  
 I added one touch to the frosting.  So it would spread smoothly., I dipped my spatula into the drained pineapple juice.  This will be one of my go to cakes from now on

I found this recipe to be too sweet and my cake was mushy in the center.  I bought canned whipped cream in case I didn't like the taste and this was a big plus.  Maybe it needed to be baked longer than stated.

This is a lovely, not-too-sweet & low-fat cake.  I've been making it for years, a sweet elderly lady patient of mine told me about it.  She called it "Blind Lady Cake" as it's so easy a blind person could make it!

This is an awesome cake.  I wonder if the people having problems with it collapsing are not turning the cake upside down to cool.    That's how I do it.  9x13 pans can be propped up using vegetable cans.

Use the one step angel food cake mix.  Mix it right in the pan and bake.  No spray!  So light and tasty..

I have made this cake several times.  Cake is extra moist and very flavorful.  Safe for diabetics as long as you don't eat to much.

I love this cake and my husband loves it!!! When my daughter was alive it never got to the “cool whip stage”!!!! She ate it as soon as it came out of the oven and then proceeded to devour it!!! It was her favorite and she was in her late 40’s

This recipe is delicious as is!  I have made it several times to take to family and work events and it disappears every time! So light and fluffy and not heavy in calories or fat.  Great all the way around!  Next time, I am toasting coconut and sprinkling on the top to add another layer of flavor!

Very good.  Other reviewers are correct in that it's more moist the next day, so it's an excellent make-ahead cake especially for those of us with little time to spare.

Delicious! I took advice and added coconut and used hand mixer for 1 1/2 minutes.  I also used 1/2 t almond extract instead of rum extract and loved the taste. Also baked for 32 min.  Came out perfect! Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

I made it in a tube pan, didn't grease it.  It didn't crumble or fall out, but it made a mess in my oven.  The taste was ok, but not as good as I had hoped.

The "Just Add Water" mix matters! This is one of my favorite cakes and I've made it several times. It's usually awesome! I decided to make it today with my kids. I had the pineapple open, oven heated and everything ready to go, when I realized the mix I had on hand had two packets: one cake mix, one egg whites. . Since the kids were looming over me longingly, I decided to just mix the packets together and continue as usual. Big mistake! This did NOT work! The cake was flat, dense, and had this weird gummy layer at the bottom. Oh well. I'll make this recipe again, but I'll be sure to buy the right mix next time!! PS - the kids ate it anyway.

I loved how easy it was to make! I didn’t read reviews until done so I’ll need to tweet the directions a bit. At 25 minutes the middle was jiggly & It did sink in middle so I left in oven an extra 5 minutes (minus 1star for this) It firmed up but was higher on sides. Still looks beautiful, I’ll add cool whip when serving. Thank u for all the reviews

I have made this cake several times. Be sure to bake it until it’s golden brown, 35 to 45 mins. depending on the type of pan you use and cool upside down.  Low-fat perfection!

I have made this recipe several times!  Yes, you need to cook it longer and I generally cook about 40 minutes.  Double the cake mix and add in a can of cherry pie filling and you have an entirely different cake and flavor!  Great for a spring dish!  I make one for a pot luck and one for home!

Because  of the reviews decided to try it. Made it in large pryex dish. used a little Pam so it wouldn't stick when it came out of the dish fine. cooked for 35 minutes and checked with tooth pick and it did sink a little bit. It has a sweet taste and. Very moist all so ( all most to moist)If using frosting no one will no it sunk. Next time i;ll make it in angel food tube pan.You really have the pineapple flavor. Enjoy it regardless how you make it. No frosting is necessary your choice.

This was absolutely the best.  Everyone raved about it.  Most assuredly a keeper and will be made again and again.  So easy.

Very easy. I loved the simplicity, with few ingredients. I felt that it is very sweet. Next time, I will look closely a the canned pinnaple for sugar content.

I've eaten this in the past but making it was new. It was so much fun to make. The mix and pineapple got all foamy so be sure and use a large enough mixing bowl. It was delicious! My husband couldn't believe how quickly I made it. Definitely a keeper.

This is super easy!  I made it first in a bunt pan but it stuck to it badly.  I still managed to salvage it and use it and it tasted awesome.  Everyone loved it.  I will make it in the correct pan next time - live and learn.

Very good but was disappointed that it didn't stay as high when baked.  It arose when stirred but fell during baking.  Delicious though.

What a super quick and easy cake to make! Great for last-minute dessert plans for unexpected guests. The blend of cake and pineapple is balanced. Add cream topping. A drizzle of light icing would be great to add as well.

Easy to make but the cake collapsed. I drained the pineapple and added the juice to make up the total water needed. Cooked for an hour and left it in the oven after turning it off for 5 minutes to make sure it was cooked. Still tasty.

With pineapple it was great.  Someone said it was good with apple pie filling.  Tried it, not good!  Maybe if you cut the apple smaller.  Didn't come out well.  Would do the apple again!

This was just not good.  Sickening sweet and just had an off taste. I used 9x13 pan and it collapsed so I had to spoon out servings.   I am surprised by the 5 star ratings because this was definitely not what I would consider a 5 star cake by a long shot!  It was however very easy to make and may be good for a quick after school snack for kids or for dieters as I think it should be lower in calories and fat than a regular cake.

I have made this many times and love it.  I bake it in an ungreased 13x9 inch pan for 30 min.  If it's cooled in the pan, it will usually fall and make a dense cake which some like.  When I take it out of the oven, I turn the pan upside down and lay it crosswise over another 13x9 inch pan to cool.  That allows the cake to maintain its height and not fall in the center. The cooled cake  is easy  to cut into servings and remove from the pan.  There will be a thin layer of brown crumbs in the pan which wash away easily.

Loved it! Couldn't stop eating it! Can't wait to make it again. Cooked for 45 minutes at 350...tested for doneness after 40 minutes by inserting butter knife in the center..was slightly  undone, so I covered it loosely with foil to prevent it from browning any further...extra five minutes and it was perfect!

This was very good. I made mine in a glass Pyrex dish , and only lightly greased the bottom. I also added shredded coconut. Yummy. Was even better the next day. Next time I am going to top it off with a cool whip and crushed pineapple topping.

I love this cake and call it the science experiment cake! I followed the recipe as it, but baked it in three 9 inch round cake pans. I fill the layers with whipped cream and add some berries. I enjoy making it with children who love to watch the bubbles!

I made this in an angel food cake pan which was a MISTAKE.  It is too heavy to hold together when upside down!  Also it must be baked longer - closer to 40 minutes.   Later making it in a 9x13 pan then icing it with fat free cool whip and covering it with toasted coconut, it was scrumptious!

I did make changes.  Added 3/4 cup of coconut and almond flavoring to batter.  Baked it in a tube pan for 40 minutes.  Frosting of 2 tablespoon butter melted, 1/8 cup of each white and brown sugar. Mix. Toast 1/2 cup almonds lightly.  Sprinkle toasted almonds onto top of cake, sprinkle 1/2 cup coconut and lastly sprinkle on butter sugar mix.  Broil until coconut toasted.  Cool and I did not need cool whip.

I was looking for a recipe for a cake with very little fat for someone with dietary restrictions and found this gem! So easy and so tasty. This is actually one of my first cakes ever, so if I can make it taste good, you definitely can! the only issue I had was that the top of the cake browned a little and sank in the middle (which I'm sure was user error), but I just flipped it over and called that the bottom and it tasted great. Topped it with fat free Cool Whip and nectarines--so good!

I made this exactly as written. 25 minutes to bake is not enough for 9x13 pan. My cake colapsed. I tasted some of the edges just to see what it was like and flavor is ok (even with cool whip). Unfortunately, I wont make it again.

I have made this many times but never did a review. This cake is excellent. I use the unsweetened pineapple and I have never greased the 9x13 pan that I use. I have never had a problem with it, and have never even thought of inverting it. It is extremely moist. Surely the easiest cake I have ever made. Be sure when you mix it that you incorporate all of the cake mix from the bottom of the bowl. I was told to never use a mixer, so I use a spatula and it seriously takes about 2 minutes from start to putting it in the oven. Can't begin to convince you how easy and delicious this is!!

I've been making this cake for many years as it is soooo simple. I use the koolWhip topping and then put mandarian  oranges on top.  Great in the summer as it is very light and not filling (especially needed when at a cookout)

I bake this cake quite often because it is diabetic friendly if you use the sugar free topping.  Can't be beat and is fantastic for us diabetics.

I also add into the mix about 1/4c of unsweeted shredded coconut and 1/4t of coconut extract. I frosted mine with a mixture of CoolWhip, sm box of vanilla pudding(dry) & sm. can of crushed pineapple(drained well). SO GOOD!

this recipe is the bomb!!!  You really can't beat the simplicity of it for a light, summer cake to bring to a party...people either love pineapple or hate it...if they hate it...more for everyone else!!!  The Cool Whip topping is the best on here!

Very good.  I'm not a fan of Cool Whip so I just sprinkled a little powdered sugar on each piece and used canned whipped cream, again per piece.  Will make again for sure.  Super easy.

Have made this the past 2 Easter Holidays. Got rave reviews. Last time used in mixed fruit and vanilla pudding trifle. So good. So easy. Made exactly according to the recipe. Did follow the advice of one the posters and cooled upside down resting the edges of 9x13 on four cans. It kept the cake from falling. Is great by itself; but I prefer with whipped cream and fruit.

Third time making it! 1st time it didnt rise as well which may have been an older box of mix! I followed the recipe including the 9x13 pan and spraying it. It came out great and although i tried just sprinkling with confectioners sugar  the first time it is best with Cool Whip! This time I added a 1/2 cup of shredded coconut and will sprinkle more on the cream. Wonderful recipe for pot lucks! Thanks!

A friend brought this cake to work for a party.  It was so delicious I had to make it for my diabetic, he loved it.  On top of that it's incredibly easy to make.  Give it a try, I think many of you will like it.  You can also substitute blueberry, cherry, or lemon pie filling in place of the pineapple for a different take on it, I've read.

The recipe was tasty enough that a (diabetic) coworker asked for it. It is super fast and easy, and yummy. I added 1 cup of unsweetened coconut and some vanilla.  I'm giving 4 stars because the cake didn't rise like a regular angel food cake - it was only about 2-1/2 inches high.  The recipe doesn't say if this is normal or not - would be good to know as I almost threw it out and tried again without the pineapple.

Prepared the cake mix and baked exactly as directed.  We're not even going to need the cool-whip topping; it's so nice it stands well on it's own. Thanks for sharing :D

Easy and real good, my daughter loves it, think the only thing i would change about the recipe is the cooking time, it really needs 15 extra minutes.

This cake is the easiest cake to make EVER.  It didn't fall.  It didn't stick to the pan.  And I didn't have to cool it upside-down.  It was perfect as written.  Golden brown on the top and the edges and moist and sweet inside.  Mmmm!  Delicious!  I DO like the idea of using some pineapple mixed with the whipped topping, though.  I think I might try that next time... because there WILL be a next time for THIS cake.   ;)

I made this as written, except for cool whip (Yuk), I only use real whip cream.  It turned out great.  Would make this again, a fast yummy dessert.

this is a great, quick, light dessert!  just the right amount of sweetness and very easy-to-make.  i agree that we should all keep these (3!) ingredients on hand when we need a quick dessert.

Unfortunately, the cake was not very tasty at all.  The pineapple fell to the bottom of the pan during baking, and it ultimately formed a filmy coating on the bottom of the cake.  Overall, I was quite disappointed with the cake's flavor and consistency.

I made this for my husband to take to work for a healthy option for birthday celebrations.  Everyone loved it.  I loved how easy it was.  It's definitely a denser not super light and fluffy like angel food cake.  Really good with cool whip.

I only used half of the pineapple and half of the water (requested from the cake box) and it turned out great.

This cake is delicious and very easy to make.  As a matter of fact I have been telling my friends about it and they are now making it.  Thanks so much for such a great recipe - especially for such an easy one.  Next time I am going to try mixing cool whip with a box of pineapple jello and use it as the topping.

Excellent! I got up this morning and threw this in the oven to take to a family lunch. Even though it did fall a bit, it was still a huge hit, and I will just give it an extra few minutes next time. Thanks for a fabulous quick and easy recipe!

This is my absolute favorite low-fat dessert.  My sister-in-law got it at a Weight Watcher's meeting and we are now addicted to it.  I sometimes top it with toasted coconut but it is great just as is, with or without the Cool Whip. If you are counting fat or calories (and who isn't) you MUST try this recipe!!!
