The coconut milk is what made this smoothie. It was very creamy. I followed the recipe without making any changes and I really enjoyed it. It does make a rather small smoothie so next time I will double the recipe. Thank you for the recipe.

I substituted the coconut milk with unsweetened almond milk and an extra 1/2 tbsp of vanilla powder more. But tasty.

It's nice and refreshing!  BUT the macros are either wrong in the recipe, or the vanilla powder adds about 10 carbs?!  I used vanilla extract instead, entered the ingredients in Carb Manager and got 4 net carbs for this recipe.

Although I made this and it is super delicious, it is not one I will try again any time soon.  With 13g carbs, it defeats my purpose - too many carbs for me.

I am not trying to lose weight, so I used whole milk, vanilla protein powder (whey), 1 TBL coconut oil and half a banana.  Tomorrow I am planning to add some oats and chia seeds.

I liked that I had almost 500 calories for a post-workout meal, and was hungry again for lunch shortly after.

I used two scoops of a keto vanilla shake powder instead of plain vanilla powder and it turned out fantastic! Very filling and it's a new way for me get my nutrients. I didn't have to add the MCT or erythritol because it was already in the powder as well.
