These were very tasty I doubled the recipe and we ate them for dinner with stir fried veggies.  Next time I think I'll add some onion and red pepper flakes.

These were yummy.  I won some goji berries and was looking for a non dessert to use them in.  I think next time I will chop up a few and mix them with the filling.  I didnt have a steamer, but you can google instructions how to make one with aluminum foil and a plate and it worked just fine
