This was delicious, I was honestly sad when it was gone and contemplated making another one.  I really enjoyed the flavor combinations and the addition of sunflower seeds.  I made as written, but used lite veggie cream cheese.  Not sure it needs the mayo, I might try leaving it out next time.  Give this one a shot!
