I used fresh pumpkin which I had pureed, and left everything else the same.  These were delicious!  They turned out warm and chewy, with an almost caramel taste to them.  Absolutely perfect with hot tea or coffee on a wintry afternoon.  I will be making these again.

I made this one with my husband and we followed the recipe exactly. I wasn't fond of the wheat flour dominating the after taste. I don't think I will be making this again. It was OK. Thanks for the recipe I really did enjoy trying it.

I made this using all-purpose flour instead of whole wheat.  I also added some pumpkin pie spice.  They were pretty good, but I think they could use some more flavor.  Maybe some more pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon.

I tried these but my family really didn't care for them it may have been the wheat flour we have never used it but they just didn't appeal to us.
