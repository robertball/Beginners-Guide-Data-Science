I have used a recipe similar to this for years.  The problem with this one is that you put everything in a food processor.  I have tried that and using a grinder and always go back to chopping by hand.  A bit more work but the colors stay true and so do the flavors.  Sometimes you just can't short cut.

Unfortunately, I can't agree with the previous reviewer - I scaled it down to 10 servings but made this recipe as written, and I didn't like it at all. I'm not sure if it was the turmeric, the mustard seeds or both, but it tasted bitter; it was extremely unappetizing-looking too. Husband refused to even try it. Sorry.

I haven't yet made this exact recipe, but it is nearly identical to the one my grandma made for many, many years.  I have her recipe and the only differences are that she used both red and green peppers (6 red and 10 green), a bit more celery seed, and cider vinegar instead of white.

This is my favorite relish!  It's not a dill relish, nor a traditional sweet relish.  It has a taste all its own, and nothing I find in the stores tastes as good as this does, to me.

I didn't have any green tomatoes, so I used tomatillos in their place.  Their seeds looked lovely in the relish.  Also, I did reduce the recipe to 10 servings and next time I would add slightly less sugar.  This was very good on a hot dog.

This is my Mom's recipe.  I use it in Macaroni Salad and it's wonderful.  Substitute it when a recipe calls for a sweet relish and you'll be pleased.

This recipe is same as what i make, but I do use 8 green peppers and 6 red peppers...use it in mac & tater salads, sloppy joes, barbecues, everything!  It's been known to us as "Hot Dog relish' but we use it for everything and everyone loves it!! And while we used to grind by hand, now I use the food processor cause it's easier on the hands...:)

I grew up making this with my Mother and sisters! Great relish! I have had people tell me, "I don't care for pickle relish." But I tell them this is not pickle relish, its green tomato relish. They try it and love it! It's great warm and fresh or cold. I can eat it by the spoon full! Thanks.

Easy to make and a nice blend of flavor. I am taken by the ammount of sugar, though. Next time I wil cut back considerably.

This recipe was handed down from 3 generations of my family.  It is our favorite. I have made it and gave as gifts to friends and they love it.  Look forward to getting it each year as a gift.

Made this recipe for a long time. I add 1 hot pepper per, cut back the sugar and pack in sterilized jars and process. Great Christmas gift. Much better than store relish.

I cooked it only 5 minutes since the canning process will cook it more. I gave it 4 stars since it was only in the old imperial system and not in the international metric system which meant lots of converting figures to get right quantities. Good recipe otherwise but twice as sweet as I prefer especially being a diabetic

Love this recipe -- it is from an old Betty Crocker cookbook.  I add red/yellow/orange peppers to it for some added color.  It makes amazing tartar sauce mixed with mayo!
