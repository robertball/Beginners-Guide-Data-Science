I was really disappointed with this recipe.  Sauteing the corn didn't add anything to its natural flavor and only made it greasy.  The spread was too tart and the chili flavor overwhelmed the delicate sweetness of the corn.

This is near the exact recipe my step-sister brought back from deep in Texas. The only difference is the corn the on cob was soaked (in the husks) in a large bucket of salt water overnight, then slowly cooked on the grill till the husks were charred. Then it was sauted in butter before the cilantro mixture was brushed on. FABULOUS!!! :)

I thought this would be absolutely awesome, but I was disappointed.  The cilantro is way too overwhelming for corn.  Maybe it would OK with another vegetable, but it takes away from the fantastic natural flavor of corn.

I'm a big fan of cilantro, so was excited to find this recipe and it was fabulous!  I made it for a dinner party and used frozen corn niblets for simplicity.  I steamed the corn, then quickly browned the kernals in a frying pan and added a spoonful of this sauce on top.  It outshined even the main course and every guest raved about it.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I like the idea of this, and I loved the spread as something different (also excellent on baked potatoes) for corn on the cob. I was not so crazy about the twice-cooked method and my corn got a little overdone. Next time I'll just prepare the corn as usual and top with the spread. Thanks!

This was pretty good. I liked the tangy flavor of the sourcream, but I'm not real sure about the cilantro.

I totally dug on this.  It is sincerely necessary to use a cast iron skillet to get a nice browned flavor over the corn.  Using a non-stick pan will not do.   I despise cooking things in the microwave, so boiled the corn after soaking it in a pot of water with a little bit of sugar and salt.  The idea of cooking it in plastic wrap just didn't seem right.  I didn't have fresh cilantro so used dried.  I love cilantro, but just couldn't taste it like I wanted to.  Next time I make this, I'll use fresh and let it meld longer.  The only reason I gave this is a four is that I asked hubby what he thought.  He said it was okay, but he wouldn't want the dressing every time.  I liked the concept but will use fresh cilantro next time.  Like others, I can see how this could be used as a chip dip or on other veggies later.

This was interesting, but this wasn't anything we'd have to make again.  Just putting butter and Tony C's on an ear of corn is a better option (IMHO!).

I love corn on the cob, but I like to spice things up a bit and this recipe was great! I boiled my corn, then made the sauce (using 2 tbs. butter instead of sour cream) and then added the corn to the saucepan with the cilantro mixture.  *Delicious*

When I made the spread I thought it didn't have much flavor but when I cooked the corn (I boiled the corn and then sauteed the corn in a pan with the butter) and put the spread on top it was fabulous! It really complimented the corn and my friends really enjoyed!

I picked this to go with a garlic-lime chicken recipe. I love cilantro, so I figured this would be awesome. Eh... it was just alright. The flavors went well together and everyone ate an enjoyed it for the most part, but the flavors didn't blend to make a new tasty flavor, which is what I was hoping for. It tasted like tangy sour cream with cilantro and a little kick, but it was missing something. That said, I totally appreciate the cooking method offered here. Wrapped in the microwave and cooked for 10 minutes then dropped in some butter and pan cooked for another 5 or so, slightly browned... perfection.

This was very interesting.  Next time I'll make it though with MUCH less Chili powder...it was really bitter so I had to increase the sour cream to cut the taste.  Definitely helped to butter the corn first...then add the spread.

The spread tastes great and fresh, but we found that the sour cream mixture clashed with oil of the butter.

This recipe was easy and everyone loved it.  You can also add some Mexicano crumbled cheese (cheese section of the store) on the corn after you put on the sauce.  Will make again

We really enjoyed using this recipe,and changed it up by oven roasting the ears for the entire cooking period after brushing with oil and pepper. The sour cream/ cilantro spread on the warm ears was perfect for the rich sweet flavor of the roasted corn kernels. After doing it this way, will probably repeat many times.

I added WAY more cilantro and a generous amount of Lowry's seasoing salt. It was great! I could use regular sour cream next time though. I also just boiled the corn and omitted the butter.

pretty good! Was a hit with everyone. Alot of work for just a topping for corn on the cob, but the flavor of it is so good that I want to use it as a dip for chips.
Also, I never thought of cooking corn on the cob in the microwave but it was so easy!
thanks!

I had lots of the spread leftover so more corn could be cooked with the same amount of spread.
