In my attempt to not let a single tomato go bad from my 50 tomato plants I made this pie.  I was super surprised at how good it was.  I made my pie crust, Pie Crust IV, from this site.  Then I sliced 3 large tomatoes.  I layered half in the crust, sprinkled with salt and pepper and then layered half the onions.  Repeated with the rest of the toms and onions.  I made the topping with Miracle Whip because it was all I had.  I thought the cheesy topping was wonderful.  This almost tasted like a gourmet type of pizza.  The tomatoes get very runny in the pie but when you slice it and put it on your plate it's not runny.  Most of the juice stayed in the pie plate which I just dumped out.  The only change I may make is too add some green olives next time (I love them and add them to everything) and maybe add some minced garlic to the cheese topping.

I did not think this recipe was good at all.  It came out very goopy and did not taste properly cooked, even though I let it go 5 minutes longer than suggested, fully drained my tomatoes, and let the pie stand for 10 minutes.  I also felt that it was very bland. If you still feel you must try this, I would recommend the following adjustments:  1) the pie crust does not cook through during the cooking time, which can be fixed by pre-cooking just the crust for 10-15 mintues or until lightly browned; 2) the onions, although I sliced them very thin, were practically raw.  I would recommend sauteing them first before putting them into the pie.  I think this recipe might be salvaged by mixing two eggs and some crumbled bacon in with the cheese/mayo mixture, and increasing the cooking time by about 10 minutes or until the top is golden brown.

Two words...ABSOLUTELY FANTABULOUS!!! I have never written a review in the 6+ years I have been using this website but, this was SO GOOD I couldn't not! I picked out this recipe as a new side dish. It was so easy that my 14 year old daughter whipped it together. It was so delicious, her and her boyfriend are making another right now. A simple recipe, with simple ingredients but intricate flavors and textures. The only change we made was pre-baking the crust, (I used a Pilsbury frozen, it has the perfect amount of salty/sweetness) for 12 minutes and make sure the tomatoes and onions are VERY thinly sliced.

Great recipe... Really easy and VERY VERY good! I used regular Mayo rather than fat free, and sprinkled bacon bits on the top for a little more flavor, and it was great!

This pie is delicious! I didn't blanche my tomatoes but just sliced them fresh (I was in a rush) and that turned out just fine. The only drawback was that the mayo/cheese topping,was quite goopy when I cut into it, but looked fantastic. I tried to stick it under the broiler to stiffen it up but it didn't work. I did use regular mayo instead of no-fat though, and that may have made a difference. I will definitely make this again, but perhaps add an egg and some milk to make a bit more of a quiche just to firm up the top. Even so,I will still make it again, Yum!!

I’ve been making this pie for at least 15 years and save this recipe as a reference. Fairly certain I haven’t made it the same twice but it always turns out great! Pro tips: make more topping than you think you’ll need, adding sautéed bacon and onions is never had bad idea and make go ahead and make two pies!

This was good and easy.  I used creole seasoning and it turned out really good.  This is a great recipe to take to a covered dish.

Great way to use garden vegetables..only limited by your imagination!  In my quest to add more nutrients and a bit more interest, I added fresh cut up spinach, mushrooms, one avacado to the tomato mixture. An alternative to adding cheese to bottom of crust as was recommended, I used red pepper humus.  I used roma tomatoes and padded  these dry with paper toweling prior to adding to mixture.  Topped it off with mixture of remaining humus, mayo and a bit of cheese as recommended. Great!

We loved it.  Very tasty. Thank you to all reviewers.  From the advice of others.  I got the Pilsbury crust and prebaked it for 12 min.  I placed some cheese first on the crust.  I chopped the onions and mixed them with regular mayo, cheese, chopped celery, one egg and seasonings. I cut up and put 6 pepperoni on a napkin and nuked for 30 sec then blended into the cheese and egg mix.  I then placed chunky ripe tomato slices on top.  I peeled them w/out blanching and drained out as much juice as possible.  I baked for about 40 min.  The texture was firm like a quiche and the flavor was superb.

I've been making this pie for years for picnics and pot-lucks, getting compliments every time!!!  I use regular mayo and cheese instead of the low fat, and add bacon.  Instead of Italian spices, I use garlic salt, crushed red pepper, and whatever fresh spices I have around.  A real crowd pleaser!!!

This is absolutely delicious...will make often. Dislike people who rave about a recipe and then list all the changes they made. Now I am going to be one of them. After reading all the reviews could barely wait to make this. Prebaked pie crusts for 10 minutes at 350. Guess I sliced my tomatoes too thin so decided to just go ahead and chop them and the onions. I did let the tomatoes drain all afternoon in a colander. Everything else was the same as written...OMGoodness. So good I cannot even tell you. Sherrie, thank you. This was firm, no juices in bottom...just perfect!

Really enjoyed this as an appetiser and it was a great way to use Jersey tomatoes.  I did not blanch them (not necessary in my opinion), but did let them drain for several minutes.  I didn't use anything fat-free, but did lower the amount of mayo to just about 3/4 cup with the 4 oz. of cheddar cheese (which is the equivalent to 1 cup shredded).  I used very large Jersey tomatoes so only used 1-1/2 which seemed good.  I also used one med-large shallot sliced thin as my onion, and then cut one or two more times so that the onions were in smaller pieces.  The mayo/cheese mix is easier to place on top if you use your fingers.....a little messy but the only way to apply it evenly.  I let it cool approx. 20-30 min. and noticed that the first piece was a little runny, but the rest cut nicely like cutting a piece of pie.  I would recommend making it enough ahead of time to allow for some cooling off time.  Will definitely make again for company.

The taste was great, but a little too runny.  Maybe I needed to drain on paper towels longer.

This was a great recipe..the only reason i only gave it 4 stars is because i modified it a bit. I cooked the pie crust first until golden brown then added a layer of tomoates/onion/garlic powder, italian spices and salt and pepper then layered once more with the same. I used low-fat cheddar but reg. mayo and it cooked it as instructed and it came out perfect. I didn't even have any liquid in the bottom of the plate (i sliced the tomatoes and let then drin on the paper towel at least 10 minutes or so) We loved it! Can't wait to use summer tomotoes-I bet it will be even better!

I loved this recipe, tried with regular mayo, again with a mix of soy mayo and regular but the 1st try was better. I found you NEED to let this sit much longer than recommended time and the pie really solidifies.

This dish was a hit! I sauted the onions first to insure they cooked all the way through.  This dish is even better the second day warmed up!

Very tasty and easy to make.  I substituted fat-free ranch dressing instead of using the mayo and italian seasonings which gave the pie an awesome tangy taste.  Will definitely make again.

A BIG hit with all of the family. Ranging from a 13 yr old boy all the way up to our 21 year old! My wife even loved it and is not a huge fan of vegetables! I'd make this again & again! Now...I did cheat & added some sliced pepperoni making it totally non-vegetarian. Believe that additiopn is what really made it a huge hit! :)

My husband said "EXCELLANT-EXCELLANT!"  I noticed a little grease at the top, but that is why the recipe said to use low fat mayo and I did not have any.  Hubby did not notice, just loved it.  ALLRECIPES, you always help me cook like a pro!

I made this and think it tastes very good. My only notes for next time are to let it sit and cool for awhile before serving or else it's a little soupy. Still tastes great, but doesn't look as nice on the plate. I also might do as some suggest and pre-bake the pie crust. My crust on the bottom was a little bit doughy and I wouldn't have wanted to bake any longer because the cheese topping was perfect.

I'm not a big fan of mayo, but I was looking for ways to use up the abundance of summer tomatoes. I substituted shreeded Italian blend cheese for the cheddar and the final product was a bit soupy but the taste was delicious. I may add some bisquick next time to firm up the pie.

A great recipe.  I used fresh grated garlic instead of garlic powder, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I will make it again.
