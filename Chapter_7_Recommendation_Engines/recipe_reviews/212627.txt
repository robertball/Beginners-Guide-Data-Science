After reading that it was lacking in flavour I placed Ms. Dash Southwest Chipolte, Cajun seasoning, seasoning salt and garlic powder in a bowl and seasoned the chicken with this mix.  It turned out amazing.  Had just enough kick without being over the top.

I added sauted onions and garlic along with a can of rotel, very yummy! I also vary this up by adding Campbell's cheese soup instead of the cream of mushroom, it makes it very cheesy and the neices and nephews gobble it up and leave nothing to spare. (I also throw in some peas and sometimes greenbeans,  and they get their veggie serving while eating and I don't have to threaten to take away their ice cream!)

I was looking for something easy and inexpensive to cook for dinner tonight and this turned out to be the perfect recipe. I did do a few things different.  I sauteed the mushrooms and added fresh herbs and a little salt and pepper.  I also substituted spinach for the peas.  I also layered as directed except i put cheese before adding the layer of rice and peas (spinach in my case). I also season the chicken with salt and pepper before browning.  This casserole was so delicious and full of flavor. I def will make again.

It had the making of a good casserole, but it was very bland.

I agree, very bland, thought the full salt soup would do it. It did not.

Needs a lot more, even after seasoning the chicken and rice it was pretty blah. Might try sour cream and bacon next time, and lots of s & p.

I changed up the recipe somewhat.  Instead of cutting up the chicken breasts I pounded them a bit so they'd cook evenly.  I sauteed a diced onion then sauteed the mushrooms along with the onion, then combined it all and baked it as per directions.
