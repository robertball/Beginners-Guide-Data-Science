What a colourful and tasty recipe!  This winning combination of fruit, vegetables, and meat looks and tastes great.  I used some bavarian smokies from the deli counter and fresh pineapple.  I would probably let the vegetables and pineapple marinate a bit longer next time.  Also, the red onion takes longer to cook and was a bit raw so next time I would either precook it a bit before adding to skewers or made separate red onion skewers and put them on the BBQ sooner.  Will definitely use this one again.
