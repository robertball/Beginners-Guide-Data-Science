Very nice. I halved the recipe but it still made way too much for two people. Didn't bother with using the stock & flour as the condensed soup on it's own enough sauce. I added a diced carrot to the mixture to up the vegetable content. This would also be a good appetizer in smaller Vol-au-vent shells.

My husband really likes this.  My biggest problem: I had a very hard time finding the cream of asparagus soup.

My husband and I both love asparagus and was looking for a recipe to do anything w/ fresh asparagus.  We both enjoyed but served over penne because that is all I had on hand and I think it would have been better as original recipe suggested.
