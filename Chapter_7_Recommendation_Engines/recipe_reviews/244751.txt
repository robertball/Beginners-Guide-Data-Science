This sauce is excellent.  They only thing I would add is a bit of ginger.  I used Sambal Chili garlic sauce in place of the chili flakes.  I should have reduced my sauce a bit more than I did.  In the future, I would make the sauce in advance and get it a bit thicker.  Sweet, spicy, messy, and a bit addictive.   Yum.
