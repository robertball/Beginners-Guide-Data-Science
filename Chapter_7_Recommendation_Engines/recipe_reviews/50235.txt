Very good recipe!  Tasty, filling and overall a great crowd pleaser.  5 star rating is for printed written recipe.  Personal taste adjustments:  reduce rosemary to 1/2 tablespoon, add 1 teaspoon peppercorns, use low sodium soy sauce, replace 4 cups of the water with 4 cups low sodium beef broth. Served with a garlic mayo (1 cup mayonnaise and 2 cloves minced garlic that married for 8+ hours).  Assembled buns with garlic mayo, roast and then topped with a selection of cheeses; manchego, provolone and horseradish (hubby liked the provolone cheese best) and broiled until cheese was bubbly.  Served with au jus and a green salad.  Divine!

If I was to review this recipe right after the initial ten hours of cooking, I would have given it 4 stars. But after everyone ate I took the leftovers shredded it, removed all visible fat, returned with juice to refrigerator.  The next afternoon I made a sandwich which my 8 year old son could not get enough of. I think it needed that time in the fridge to completely blend the flavors. I think the next time I make this, I will cook overnight, in the morning shred and put in fridge and then reheat for dinner. Delicious  Just wanted to add that the au jus makes a great base for French Onion soup

I thought this was a great recipe! Much better than I have ever had in a restaurant.  I made a few changes based on other reviews and my own personal tastes. I used 1 cup of low sodium soy sauce, 1-2 cans low sodium beef broth, 1 can Campbell’s French Onion soup (because it had a beef base rather than chicken), and 3 cups of water. I also cooked over night and put it in the fridge for the day. Put rolls in the oven with Swiss cheese and broiled for a few minutes and then topped with sautéed onions, mushrooms, and finally horseradish sauce. Served with Bleu Cheese Coleslaw from this website.

This is a fantastic recipe. I've used it with brisket, chuck roast and rump roast. Instead of water I use a can of beef broth. On crusty French or Italian garlic bread it's a symphony. I also add lots of sliced onions for topping.

This is a very good recipe! I was honestly VERY hesitant of it at first because of the amount of soy sauce, but it turned out quite well. I did not have any fresh garlic on hand at the time I made this, so I used a tsp of garlic powder as a substitute. I added a little garlic powder later in the cooking, too, to offset the tang of the soy sauce, which was just a personal taste thing. I also used and extra cup of water to the broth because I let this cook for 14 hours - I had a very long day - and didn't want the meat to burn. It turned out great!! Even the guys in my family who normally never comment on anyone's cooking said they loved it. I served the shredded beef on steak rolls with swiss cheese with the au jus in bowls for dipping. I expected to have leftovers for lunch the next day, but it disappeared! The soy flavor *was* pretty intense, but the flavors mixed well and it was really, really good. I'm adding this recipe to my monthly menu rotation.

This was to die for.  It was so good, I can't say enough.  I put the meat on a hoagie with a slice of cheese and sauted onions and mushroom and broiled for just a few minutes, dipped in the juice and they were awesome.  The meat had such great flavor!!  The only modifications I made were suggestions made by other reviewers in that I used 2 cans beef broth and 2 cups water and 5 cloves of garlic.  Will definitely make this again and again.

I feel honored that I am the first to review this recipe.  I had my parents over the night I made this.  My husband, kids and parents all loved it.  Only draw back, no leftovers.  I made it exactly as stated on the recipe...no alterations.  I served it with baked beans, potato salad and a salad.

Great base recipe.  I had 2.65 lb chuck roast that I put in the slow cooker with 4 cups of water, minced garlic, the bay leaves, 1/3 cup soy sauce, 1/3 cup Worchestshire, a splash or 2 of Burgundy cooking wine and some dried thyme (because I had no dried rosemary).  I forgot to toss in the minced onions, but did later on and that worked out great.  This au jus is freakin' awesome.  We've got leftovers tonite and then I'm freezing that au jus for some future soup or something!

This was a really great recipe. Will certainly make again.  I did add 1/4 cup less soy sauce and 1/4 cup of worcestershire sauce instead.  The soy sauce was a little too strong for my taste. Also we were not crazy about the texture of the dried rosemary so I strained the herbs out of the sauce before serving.

This was excellent, I used a rump roast, and added some peppercorns and just loved the flavor!  Hubby loves au jus sandwiches, and he wants this again already next week... With the ease of being able to throw it all together in the morning and have dinner almost ready (I fixed a green salad to go with it) after work, I think he will get his wish! ;oP

Okay, you MUST cook this all night and then shred it in the morning and refrigerate all day for it to get "happy" and then reheat!  I also lowered the soy sauce to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of worstershire sauce. I also put in 2 cans of beef broth and as a result, did not add water at all. My son does not like "french dip" at ALL and LOVED this!  This is wonderful!  You must give this a try!

I thought this was very good.  I did have to turn my slow cooker to high for a bit and I did add a few other seasonings (basil and oregano).  I also used garlic powder instead of minced.  I used the coffee filter like another reviewer suggested as well.  Thanks for such an easy home cooked meal.

This was fabulous. I give this 5 stars with a stipulation. I had to incorporate many of the review suggestions to make it work. I used 1/2 beef broth and 1/2 water. Put the spices in a spice bag which I removed after cooking. Separated the meat and broth over night. Took off the fat (1/4 inch!) and poured the broth through a cheesecloth.  Then combined the broth and meat in a pan on warm for about an hour. My Dad couldn't put it down. Can't wait to make it again!

Finally!!!  A recipe the WHOLE family loves!  I tweaked the recipe a bit by putting in 2 cans of Campbells beef broth and 2 cups of water (rather than just 4 cups water). With the regular soy sauce, it WAS salty.  But absolutley delicious.  I cooked it 12 hours and the meat was falling apart but tasty.  I split hoagie rolls and put the beef and some mozzarella cheese slices on top and stuck them uder the broiler for a couple of minutes.  (that helped to keep the meat on the roll!) I sauteed some onions in butter for those of us who like that.  Even without dipping, they were GREAT!!!

This really is delicious. It was a little hard to believe I made it. I did tie the rosemary in a coffee filter and remove it with the bay leaves when I was ready to shred the beef. I can't imagine anyone not liking this, it is that good. Thank-you Lori for this -- I've been telling everyone about it.

I've tried several other beef dip recipes, and the jus in this recipe is the best. I saved the leftover jus and used it as a base for vegetable soup!

Mmmm I love this recipe. Me and hubby ALWAYS order beef dip at restaurants, its just our go-to meal. I made this a week or so ago- and last night we went out- and he said that 'my' beef dip was the best yet- so he won't order it anymore. Thats about as close to a ' you made a great meal!' as I will get from him. Thank you!! delicious- writing this today because I am making it again and excited to eat. I saute some onions and mushrooms, and serve it on lighty toasted rolls with swiss cheese. YUMMY!

This was soooo good. I didn't change a thing, I don't know why some people add beef stock, when the recipe basically makes its own. it was a really big hit with my family. Will definitely make again

This is very good! The flavor is exceptional. I would recommend going with low-sodium soy sauce as the aus jus does get salty. But, man...this is some good eating.

Yummmmm - this IS good! I used a 3lb roast thus- I used 4.5c water and 1/2c soy sauce. I also added some dry onion flakes. We loved this! Great roast but these also make great sandwiches! Tender & flavorful! If you make sandwiches out of this - you MUST dip 'em! Thanks Lori for sharing your secret w/ my family!

My crockpot is far too big for the 2.5 pound roast I had on hand so I did it in the oven. I screwed up and forgot to turn the oven on, so had to do it at a bit higher temp with a much shorter cooking time of just 3.5 hours.  the meat itself had beautiful flavour and was very tender.  My meat was a bit dry, which I am going to assume was due to my changing the cooking method.  The four stars is because I found hte broth just way too salty.  I wound up having to change my plan last minute and make a packet Aus Jus and added 1/2 cup of the meat sauce to the 2 cups Jus, which was great.  I will make it again, but in the crockpot and be prepared with a lighter Aus Jus

LOVED this! Took others' advice and used 1 c. reduced sodium soy sauce, 3c. water, 3c. red. sodium beef broth. Cooked for about 7 hrs, shredded/removed marbling, cooked another 2 hours or so. Added some dried chopped onion (hubby can't tolerate the real thing) and some regular soy sauce - put horseradish and provolone on buns and toasted, served with the beef - outstanding! I was able to skim more fat off that rose to the top the next night. Great football Sunday food for a crowd.

It was okay. I used all beef broth instead of water to increase the flavour, but it was still just okay. Next time I'll use some of the suggestions to bump up the taste, but I'm not in a hurry to make it again the same way.

Wow...I did do some things differently per the advice of another reviewer. I used 2 cans of beef broth, 1/3 cup soy sauce, 1/3 cup worcestershire sauce, 5 minced cloves of garlic, the 3 bay leaves, 1/2 tablespoon thyme, only a pinch of rosemary(we're not crazy about rosemary). Strained the liquid, refrigerated overnight along with the shredded beef (separate containers). In the morning I removed the fat, reheated the au jus over a low simmer and made delicious sandwiches with a loaf of french bread. Best ever is right...

Just like everyone else claims, this recipe rocks!!  I too made sandwiches out of mine and enjoyed the leftovers the next day. I had to give the recipe to my grandmother. Will definitely pass on to others.  Thanks Lori.

I would make this again because it is dead easy. But, I would not eat it the same day. It really does get better with time. Cook it. Eat something else for dinner. Enjoy it the next day.

i've never wanted to sound like one of those know-it-all reviewers "it was only ok until my amazing intellect saved the day"  but do yourself a favor if you like pesto and put a layer of that under the cheese before you bake your french bread. oh baby.

Believe the title of this recipe!  It really is the best ever.  I make this for big family events where I just don't want to worry about cooking all day.  It is a no fail beef dip!   Very forgiving recipe to modifications too.  I have added a can of beef broth to the mix as well- also good.  I have omitted the bay leaves and rosemary and found that it is still great! I usually serve it on onion buns with slices of swiss cheese.

My husband devoured this, I thought it was a little salty.  I used low sodium soy sauce, 1 can beef broth and 2 cups water.  Put the rosemary in a coffee filter and stapled it shut (great idea by the way).  I also used a sirloin roast to cut down on the fat content.  Trimmed off the big hunk of fat and the meat was still very tender and delicious!  Will definately make again.

very good, my family really enjoyed it! so simple too.  I made a couple of changes like using 1/2 cup of lite soya with 1/2 cup red wine.  Used 5 cups of water & 1 cup of beef broth. Will definitely make again!

mmmmm mmmmmmm mmmmmm This is definitely a keeper. I have a recipe for a slow cooker roast that I've been using for 20 years or more and have received rave reviews. I added cornstarch to the sauce to thicken into a gravy, had mashed potatoes and salad along the side. I served this to my parents and husband and we all agreed that it was fantastic. Thank you very much for submitting this recipe Lori. I have tossed my old and now have a new family favorite. :)

I have tried other beef dip recipes for the slower cooker but I made this last night and it really is the best ever!  The only substitution I made was teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce because I prefer the lighter flavor, but it was still delicious!

All I can say is WOW!!! This is soooo good.  I used a 4lb. sirloin tip roast,(it was on sale) and followed the recipe as written, just added a tsp. of beef soup base mix to the au jus at the end and it was perfect!  I served it on toasted ciabatta bread with homemade garlic butter and it was nothing but the best! 
You will definately need a 7 quart crock pot for this recipe and you may just want to use a 5 or 6lb roast also because this just turns out so good you will not have any leftovers! 
Thank you Lori for sharing!!

I don't even know what to say....I'm still in awe!  This is by far, the BEST french dips I've ever made!  I made 2 medium size roasts for myself and my 3 guys, thinking I'd have leftovers for BBQ beef sandwiches later in the week....NO SUCH LUCK!  Every last bit is gone!  THANKS for such a great recipe!

We found the au jus to be a little bit greasy.  So we drained the top of the juice left in the crockpot.  It was much better after that.  About 2 hours before serving I took the roast out, sliced it, and put it back into the crockpot.  This made the beef more tender and flavorful throughout.

After all the rave reviews I was very excited to try this.  Unfortunately, it did not meet expectations.  I thought the soy sauce was a weird ingredient, but went with it as directed.  For us it was way too over-powering. My family of 7 was so excited about this, and in the end not one person liked it.

I put this in the crock pot on Friday morning and left it for about 8 hours.  We ate it for dinner and I thought it was just okay, the au jus definitely was lacking in some flavor, but as others have suggested I put it in the refrigerator for the night and the next day it was amazing!  French dips are my absolute favorite sandwich and I believe this may be the best I have ever had.

Very good! Everyone loved it. I added a bullion cube to the mix and added some peppercorns. (all seasonings kept in cheese cloth)  Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!! Nobody guessed it had soy sauce in it!

My family all loved it, including my 6 and 3 year old.  Made some changes after reading suggestions.  So I didn't have loose chunks of rosemary, I put it in my "loose tea holder" and set right in slowcooker for easy removal. I used 2 cups water and 2 cups of low sodium beef broth.  1/3 C low sodium soy sauce and 1/8 C of Worchestire sauce.  I toasted baguettes with mozza cheese and garlic salt, then topped with meat to make the sub for dipping.  My husband drank his leftover "dip" from his dip bowl, a keeper for sure!!!

My husband LOVES this beef dip.  I don't even eat red meat and I have had bites of this, it was so good.  
I only use light soya sauce, and I usually halve the rosemary.  I also cook it on high for about 9 hours instead of low, never had it turn out anything but juicy and very very tender. So easy, just put in the morning, and no worrying or anything about dinner!  We flake it and put it on crusty buns and melt mozza cheese over it, so good!

A winner!  I added onions & only 1/2 the soy sauce, as that's what I had on hand ;)
Husband enjoyed the au jus so much he requested beef barley soup from the leftovers (added some water, barley, mixed veggies & mushrooms - major yum!)

Awesome! My husband freaked out!(and that is hard to make him do)He was so excited about the recipe, that he wants to have all his friends over for a hockey party, and have me make this.
I only had a small roast, so I cut the recipe in half, next time I will not do that, I will use all the soya sauce and water that it calls for, that way the flavour of the au jus will be even stronger,I also made homemade buns ( we prefer homemade to store bought) loaded up the beef, fried some onions in butter, put them on and it was great, it made it into my recipe book! Thanks for the great recipe.

Super easy and super delicious! I put mixed shredded cheese on a hoagie and melted it before adding the shredded beef.  Not only did it add an extra oomph of flavor but it also helped hold the meat in. Next time I will add some sauteed onions too :)

Yum! Seared roast first, subbed 1can beef broth for some of the liquid, added half a chopped onion into pot. Flavor delicious, meat fell apart. Only thing I would change is using a less fatty chuck or maybe a different cut next time.

As written it's pretty good, I add in 4 cups of beef broth and 2 cups of water, and it makes it SO much better. I have been using this recipe for over a year now, and it's a family favourite. LOVE it!!

This. Was. The. Best. Beef. Dip. Sandwich. I. Have. Ever. Had.  Period.  We mixed up a bit of horseradish/mayo and served on toasted buns with provoline cheese.  The. Best. Seriously.  My only change was to use low sodium soy sauce and I only started off with about 4 cups of water (adding extra periodically until it reached a to die for taste).  Note to self:  save this recipe as soon as AR fixes the save to box clitch.

This is awesome!! Everyone in my house loved this beef dip. The key is low sodium soy sauce. I used regular and the dipping sauce was a salt lick. However, it did not stop me from eating..This is a really good slow cooker recipe.

I made this for my family and everyone was in love with it! I halved the recipe and it still was enough food for 4 people with leftovers. The only changes I made was that I added extra water to dilute the soy sauce a bit and I added in a splash of Worcestershire sauce and extra garlic. Sooooo good, makes a cheap cut of meat amazing.

I followed the recipe exactly.  Used some home-made milk bread to dip the sandwiches into the juice.  Double yum.  Will be making this one again for sure.

The name says it.  I used to only make regular pot roasts with veggies, but those were the old days.  This makes the absolute best beef dip ever. My house of boys can not get enough. Left overs make for equally awesome beef burritos, quesadillas, and tacos.  Awesome easy recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

my husband always eats what i make but rarely comments,but he and my 8 yr old granddaughter kept saying these were the best french dips ever and i agree.the best part is using a chuck roast you don't have to break out the meat slicer. just cube it, shred it,whatever.make sure to use a crusty french bread.

Huge hit at my house! Great flavor. Changed it up because of previous reviews and instead of just water, used Campbell's French Onion Soup and Beef Consomme. Mixed all the juices and the garlic (besides the water) together in a container the night before so that everything could "settle". And since I'm not huge on rosemary (although my husband is), I used half the amount of rosemary, and used oregano too. Also added onion at the last few hours. Put a little mayo on the french bread, and then some shredded cheddar cheese on top of the meat. Went into the broiler for just a minute and it was amazing!

Best beef ever according to the husband:-)  For liquid, ended up using beef broth and a can of beer...i had to try to liven it up a bit b/c i was unexpectedly out of soy sauce.  I should have added salt b/c no soy.  ended up salting meat when we ate - still tasty deliciousness. next time i will make sure to have the soy sauce...it will probably be 6 stars then!  thanks for the recipe!

Very good! I used 3/4 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup worcestershire sauce, and used beef broth for half the water. My only *tiny* complaint is that the rosemary was a tad strong, so I would probably use less next time. Cooked mine for 10 hours and it was completing falling apart and beyond tender. Great recipe. Thanks :)

Really good. Had sandwiches all week long with this. I had a 2.75 lb roast, so I cut the garlic to 2 t, used 2 t of spices but did half rosemary and half thyme, 1/3 cup of soy, I was worried about too much of the soy taste, so added 1/3 worchestershire, 1 cuo of beef broth, and 3 cups of water. Cooked on low for 10 hours and it was falling apart and amazing.

Excellant! I took the advice and used a can of beef broth and cut down on the water and it came out beautifully. And I agree, it tasted even better the next day.

This was really good! A tad on the salty side, but salt and peppered the roast before putting it in the crock pot, so may have been my fault. I followed the directions as written except used 4 cups organic beef broth and 2 cups of water. Everything else as written (no searing the meat or anything). In the crockpot on low 9 hours, then shredded and back in the sauce for about 45 minutes. Turned out great! I will make again.

I found this recipe on 2005 and haven't looked for anything different since!  Absolutely love this beef dip - the only thing I add is a couple of sprigs of fresh rosemary - yummy.  Love having all the dipping sauce, I usually freeze the leftovers and use that as a base for gravy!

Wow!  It is the best beef dip ever!  Unbelievably good!  The only change I made was to add two cups of beef broth and four cups of water instead of six cups of just water.  I also left it in the crock pot for over 10 hours.  Succulent and delicious!  This is a keeper!

Very good. The first time I made this I had a pound more beef and 1/4 cup too little soy sauce on hand so I ended up having to add a couple teaspoons salt to bring out the flavors.  It worked out.  I served this with the "Fabulous French Loaves" from this site.  I also served Kraft Horseradish sauce on the side and cream of celery soup posted by WONDERFALK also from this site.    It was a tasty meal, the family loved it.  I have made this several times and followed the recipe to the letter.  There is no need to change this.  The flavors really are perfection as is.  It is not too much rosemary, it is not too much anything really.

YUMMY!  I added a can of french onion soup to the mix and cut back on the soy sauce a bit, also used 1 cup of low sodium beef broth in place of some of the water.  It came out a bit salty for my tastes but my husband LOVED it as well as the kids.

This was very good.  I doubled the recipe, but only used 1/2 cup of soy sauce.  I was glad I did this because it was plenty salty.  I substituted beef broth for the water and added oregano to the spices.  I took the advice of another reviewer and cooked the meat overnight, refrigerated it all day, and then reheated it.  It was delish with all the changes!

The meat turned out perfect, but the soy sauce overwhelmed the recipe.  I used beef broth and added garlic, still wasn't enough to overcome the soy.  Next time, I will just use beef broth, garlic, water and herbs.

Meat was incredibly tender, but sauce was too soy sauce tasting. Far too overpowering. Will take others advice to use 1/2 next time and sub. beef broth in. The beef was delicious though.

I first tried this 3 weeks ago and have made it 4 times since then! Everyone I've made it for raves about it. I took another reviewers suggestion and tied the spices up inside a coffee filter. Refrigerating the sauce overnite lets you take off alot of fat. We put the beef on sub buns with sauted green peppers, mushrooms, onions and melt some mozzarella cheese on top. The au jus for dipping is a great finishing touch. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!!!

These were great sandwiches.  I used low sodium soy sauce after seeing other reviews comments on it being too salty.  I shreaded the meat and put it on panini bread and melted swiss cheese under the broiler.

So good! Very easy, with so few ingredients, but such amazing flavor. I added a sliced onion to mine, but I am sure it would have been just as wonderful without it. I also saved the liquid, since we didnt use it as a dip, froze it, then later used some of it for the liquid in making rice. Delicious!!! Such an amazing dish!!

This recipe was very tasty! The whole family liked it! I did cut back on the soy also, used 1/2 cup and also used garlic powder instead of minced and 1 bayleaf and added some Italian seasoning, It was great with toasted rolls and jack cheese! Yum!!! Excellent leftovers also!!

I was excited to try this recipe because of all the positive comments.  It smelled really good as it was cooking but then when I dished it up it was downhill from there. The meat turned out really dry, I thought I could salvage dinner by using the juices in the crockpot as a dip but there was a thick layer of grease floating in it.  It was like dipping my sandwich in oil.  We ate it but it was not at all what I was expecting.

Delicious. I didn't have my printed recipe with me when I made this so I kind of ad libbed. I remembered this was a heavy soy sauce base and I remembered the bay leaves, which I usually use for my french dip roasts anyway. I used a packet of dried onion soup mix (again my norm) and I used equal parts dry sherry and soy sauce. I loved the soy sauce flavor. Quite tasty over the bland au jus that just the onion soup makes. My only complaint was that I should have made more for dipping!

Excellent!  The rosemary was wonderful in it.  My only problem was that I could only fit 4 cups of water in with the 4lbs of beef in my average size slow cooker.  So, the sauce was a little salty.  I will just cut back on the size of my roast next time.  But it was a super recipe and am definitely going to use it in the future.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was great. Fantastic job here. Edit: I have made this like 6 times now and we still love it. The au jus is so yummy I could just drink it. Seriously, we had au jus left over after all the meat had been eaten last time and I just dipped french bread in it to eat as a snack. So simple and delicious.

Cook it over night then let it sit all day then heat back up. It is 10x better this way.

Used mix of low sodium beef broth, low sodium soy sauce, worcestershire to taste instead of water.  All else same.  Broth was strained before using. Bread was spread lightly with butter, broiled, then parmesan, shredded beef, mozzarella, then broiled open faced again.  My family was drinking the broth it was so good!  Sandwiches all gone as fast as I made them!  Broth and leftover beef will be the base for beef and noodles next day.  Best dip sandwich ever.

This was delish!  I used a bread and butter roast (beef shoulder) and left out the rosemary and bay leaves.  I could hardly get the roast out of the slow cooker without it falling apart it was so tender.  I served on french rolls that I buttered on one half, added a slice of provolone to the other half and stuck under the broiler for a few minutes.  I made beef and noodles out of the leftovers.  I will be making this again!

This is truly the best beef dip ever!  The only changes I made was using beef broth in place of the water and low sodium soy sauce as others had recommended.  I have made it many, many times and everyone had loved it.

ABSOLUTELY the best I have had :)  I hate changing anything about recipes when I make something for the first time, but I only had a little over a 1/2 cup of soy sauce.  I added a can of beef broth to it.  Cooked it from noon today until about 1030 pm...my husband and I tried it on french hamburger rolls.  SO good!

Absolutely THE BEST!! I love this recipe. I've made it about 30 times. I only use 1 bay leaf and no rosemary b'cos I don't care for either flavor. The meat and juice are delicious. Some great bread and you are ready to go!!!!

Yesterday, I could not decide whether to cook beef stew or roast beef, both I've never cooked before. But after reading this recipe and the reviews, it was a no-brainer that I was cooking this one! I cooked it for over 4 hours and OMG!!!! It was sooooooo GOOD! I used onion rolls and provolone cheese. I can't wait to make this again! Thank you so much for sharing.

One of my favorite sandwich recipes I have found. I do substitue 1/2 c. less sodium soy sauce with 1/2 c. regular and I use half beef broth and half water. We add some provolone cheese, stick it on the buns and broil. Love it!

This was great. I ate it 3 days in a row and that is unheard of for me. I did use some low sodium soy sauce because I did not have a full cup of the regular. I added horseradish sauce to the sandwich because I love that stuff. I will be making this again. Thanks!

DELICIOUS!!! We love this recipe.  It's super easy and comes out super tender.  I serve on hoagie rolls  with provolone cheese on the opened rolls, that I toast slightly in the oven, til cheese is mostly melted, then add the shredded beef.  I've made this many times.  Sometimes I've added dry french onion soup mix.  If you like garlic, you can add more garlic too.  All of the ways are yummy.  Give it a shot; you won't regret it.

This was extremely good.  We loved it and will definitely make it again.  I was suspicious of 1 cup of soy sauce - but in the end, it was to die for.

Made this with the beef broth and it was great but a little too salty. Will experiment with other broths and soy to see if I can tone the salt down a tad.

So I followed other reviewers comments and cooked it last night and it is sitting in my fridge right now waiting for dinner. I took a bite before putting it in Tupperware and it was absolutely amazing. I only had a 2 lb. roast and I cooked it for 4 hours. It's still a little pink but delicious.

I followed some of the suggestions from others (i.e. removing visible fat and returning to juice to refrigerate overnight) and I also used 3C water/3C beef broth.  We ate ours on french bread toasted with olive oil, italian seasoning, and slices of fresh mozzarella. I sauteed a sweet onion and mushrooms to add as topping. Absolutely amazing! We had for dinner two nights and I am looking forward to having it again this week! Thank you for the recipe!

Very good!  Easy to do and great flavor.  I followed others advice and cooked over night, shredded and refrigerated with juice for the day before serving for dinner.  Didn't change the recipe ingredients and found it to be perfect.  My husband said I could serve this for dinner at least 3 times a week!

Geez, I don't know. I made this as written, except halved since my roast was only 2 lbs. We liked the sandwiches well enough, but honestly, the au jus tasted exactly like watered down soy sauce. I let the roast go on low for 9 hours, and it turned out perfect. The au jus needs doctoring.

Very easy, excellent for sandwiches. I shorted the water slightly, which made it saltier. Next time I might short the soy a bit if I'm doing another smaller chuck roast. Also added a few mustard seeds just to be funny. I didn't have all day, so I cooked on high for 5 hours. The meat was tender but didn't fall to pieces completely, so I sliced across the grain for our sandwiches. It was delicious, my daughter and husband had seconds and my daughter even ate an extra hoagie roll just to get more jus.  I could see adding some other herbs and spices to get a different twist, but this was yummy as is.

This was a very nice roast.  The flavor was different than what I have fixed before, and that is good.  Just something new for my dinner rotation.  I am looking forward to having sandwiches with the leftovers tomorrow.  Thanks you for a nice recipe.

Wow, this was fabulous, and sooo easy!  I did modify the recipe based on others reviews.  My roast was approximately 3.5 lbs.  I used 3/4 cup soy sauce, 4 cups beef broth, 3 bay leaves, 1 TBSP minced garlic and 1 tsp of rosemary.  The au jus was perfect!! We will be making this often!

The name says it all! So easy and very yummy! I have used this at least 5 times and I switch it up a little every time. I don't use as much soy sauce though.These are absolutely amazing with onion rolls broiled for 1 min. and Swiss cheese! I made this for my husbands Platoon when they came home from Iraq and it was gone so fast..Now whenever they plan to come over they ask if this is for dinner..lol so it is a hit Thanks!

I made this for Christmas lunch and it was a huge hit.  Per some other reviews, I did make it a day ahead and skimmed the fat and I also used reduced sodium soy sauce.  My family loved it and I was thrilled to have the cooking done in advance.

Mmmmmmm delish. I did go down to 3/4 cup soya sauce as per other reviews other than that just the same and it was so yummy. Fill your bun then top with mozza and broil till melted.

We had this for dinner on a busy Monday night in between school, Cub Scouts, and homework. I used a roast about 2.5 pounds so I scaled back the recipe, also used beef broth instead of plain water. Put it in the crock pot about 7 a.m., turned it to the warm setting about 5, ate about 7:30. It was very tender and moist, but I still thought the soy sauce flavor was overwhelming. I like the spices though, and next time I make this I think I will add onions, scale back the soy sauce, and add a packet of au jus mix with the water instead of canned beef broth. I have lots of leftovers and plan to mix those with some caramelized onions and swiss cheese....

This is everything you could hope for in a recipe - fast, easy and fool proof! I always make this as directed with one exception... I use fresh rosemary - it makes a huge difference in flavor! Also, since I only need to feed two, I usually scale down the au jus by half using 1/2 cup of soy sauce and 3 cups of water. It's just enough for my husband and I and it tastes great, although I think I'll take the advice of some of the previous reviews and try using beef broth in place of the water next time.

This is an amzing recipe! I have been using this as a base for months now! I use two cans beef broth and a little water to make sure it is mostly covered. I just coat the meat in the soy sauce. Don't leave out the bay leaves! Also I have tried dried basil and it works good too!It usually sits in the crock pot for 10 hrs and falls apart when I go to take it out! Perfect!

really not that wonderful. I cook my roast in the crock pot all the time. I was looking for a change of taste. Perhaps the other ladies are right and it will be better tomorrow. If not? im sure it can get turned into hash. I hope so. I also followed the recipe without any changes.

Wow! These were to die for! I LOVE beef dips, and I was impressed! I did add a little extra garlic (our prefrence) and did use half beef broth, half water, insstead of all water. Also added a couple of tablespoons of worsteschire per other reviews. I only had time to cook this on hi for 5 hours and it was perfect. I used a gravy seperator to get the fat out of the au jus, and it worked perfectly. Lori, SHARE this recipe with your family and friends! Who does that?

This was a really good recipe.  I made the beef in the slow cooker, and then placed on french bread and topped with provolone cheese. I put the sandwiches in the oven, and melted the cheese.  The Au Jus was delish!

This is a tasty recipe, however you really have to do alot for it to be good which defeats the purpose of a crock pot.  Cooking the day before or overnight is a must because the Au Jus has a layer of liquid fat that ruins the stock.  So  my tips are prepare well in advance, take beef out to shred and pour juice in a big bowl and refrigerate to remove fat that will form on top, then reheat. I made tonight and we had to skim top off with spoons to enjoy.  Also as others suggested I put spices in coffee filter and used 2 cans of beef broth with the soy sauce. I also added 4 cloves of garlic and I feel it could of used more.  I am sure tommorrow this will make a great sandwich it does need that extra day for extra flavor and to remove all fat from AuJus.

I used a small 2 lb. roast so I cut the sauce ingredients in half, using 2 cups beef broth, one cup water and 1 cup soy sauce. What a mistake. It was sooo salty, I had to dilute it with hot water. Next time I will not use beef broth, just water and soy sauce.

This really is the best and super easy.  I've made it several times now.  I use low sodium soy sauce and added a beef cube for added flavor.  I also strain some of the juice after and add corn starch to make an awesome gravy to go over rice or potatoes.  You owe it to yourself to try this at least once.  Trust me you will make it again.

To be fair, this wasn't horrid, but it was not worth making again. Just tastes like salty, soy-saucy pot roast. I did cook overnight and refrigerate the following day as suggested, and also used low sodium broth and soy sauce. But it just tasted too soy-ish. I much prefer the recipes on this site for italian beef.

Wow! What a tasty beef dip. My boyfriend absolutely loved it and has been happily taking leftovers to work for lunch! When I asked him if he liked it he said "are you kidding? it's AWESOME!"

I'm not a huge soy sauce fan so I halved the soy sauce and added some beef bouillon instead. Also we love garlic, so I went crazy with the garlic.

I will be making this again... thank you!

Made this last night for a bunch of hungry guys--they loved it!  I also followed others advice and used lower sodium soy, and substituted some of the water with lower sodium beef broth and a can of french onion broth.  I left it on low for 9 hours and it was extremely tender.  I also shredded it and put it on rolls in the oven with some cheese on top--there was none left!  The juice will find it's way in some soup or something, but it was still pretty salty even with the changes I made.  Would definitely make again, it was very easy, and tasty.  Thanks!

This recipe was ok.  I found the rosemary to be too overpowering, but that is just a personal taste.  I think that next time I will brown the roast frist with oinons, and then add the onions to the au jous.  I might add another spice, just in a much smaller quantity.  I also added some burgandy wine to it.  The meat turned out very tender!  I will defenetly be cooking this again.  Hoping to be able to give it a 5 next time =)

awesome!!! I cooked the roast for 8-9 hours, and it was perfect! I also used kaiser rolls & provolone. I then made the sandwiches, threw them in the oven at 400 for 7 minutes, and they were just wonderful! The au jus was excellent!! This is a keeper!

This was very good and extremely easy to make!  I used light soy sauce since several reviewers seemed to think it was too salty but I think I'll use regular the next time I make this.

A tip for the au jus: I thought the taste was much better after I stored it in the refrigerator.  All the fat went to the top and turned solid so I removed it and the liquid was more flavorful, in my opinion (and probably healthier).

This was really great! I used the suggestion of several others and reduced the amount of soy sauce by 1/2. I also just smashed a few cloves of garlic and put in a sprig of fresh rosemary so I really didn't need to strain the jus. Definately a keeper!!!

I made this for the first time yesterday--boy were my husband and boys happy with me!  The house smelled great! popped crusty buns in the oven with provolone cheese and broiled till the cheese melted, added the meat and they turned out perfect.  Actually these "sandwiches" were a meal in itself, plenty filling and perfect for a rainy cold Saturday!  I followed the recipe exactly and will definately be making this again, thanks for the great recipe!!

This was the one meal my husband ate during his bout of the flu and that is quite a compliment!  We all liked this every time I've made it.  I like it with horseradish mixed with mayo spread on the buns, but my children like it plain dipped in the juice.  If you aren't really super diligent about fat removal before you cook the roast, you end up with a lot floating on top.  I skimmed the fat before serving the au jus because it grossed me out.  That isn't the fault of the recipe, it is just the way roasts are!

The beef was really good and the recipe was easy to make but I wouldn't rate it as the best ever.  My family all agreed that the oxo beef au jus (just add boiling water) is better to dip in.

This is definitely a keeper! Used 2.5 lb roast but did not half the rest of the ingredients, kept them the same. I cooked it for 8+ hours and it was delicious. Served on toasted rolls with provolone cheese and au jus.

"SUPERIOR!"  Is what my dreadfully picky husband said!!!  I used Kikomann's LITE soy sauce and it turned out wonderful!  My husband couldn't figure out what gave the meat that wonderful flavor!  My house smelled fabulous! Thank you!

very good, not my favorite, but you can use it several ways all week.  first we had it with mashed potatoes and the dipping sauce was great with the potatoes.  then we made sandwiches with french bread and a little melted mozzerella cheese.  we really enjoyed it.

This was delicious! Although next time I will cut down on the rosemary. It was a bit strong for our taste. Other than that, it was great!

Absolutely awesome.  I have been looking for a beef dip recipie and this is it!  I can't believe how simple it was to make either, I agree with the submitter - this recipe will be kept "secret".  Seriously though, I really did enjoy this one, add it t o a family favorite list!

I just made this today for my husband, myself and three friends. We all thoroughly enjoyed it. I will absolutely make this again. Though I wasn't able to use the given amount for each ingredient, I still rate this as a five-star recipe. These are the things I changed, only because I had to: The roast was 3.6 lbs (the biggest the store had); I used only four cups of water (the most I could fit in my crock pot while not passing the "max-fill line"); I used seven bay leaves (mine are old, thus less potent, so I threw in a few extra). I cooked it on Low for seven hours, then on Warm for the following two hours, then served on hoagie buns, with the au jus in a small bowl. The flavors blended extremely well and the meat was very tender. We had no cheese to add to the sandwiches, but it truly tasted so great without any toppings.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I make it all the time.  Its my go-to recipe for feeding big crowds. Everybody loves it.  I follow the recipe exactly, oh except I have never added the bay leaves.  We add provolone or swiss cheese to our sandwiches.  So delicious!

Sensational. Don't believe the broth recommendation. Boiling the beef creates broth. Use Braggs or other low sodium soy sauce, follow the recipe, and your jus will be perfect.

Wow!  This was the biggest hit ever!  My husband and dad both said this is the best meal I've ever made and they are both tough critics. I followed another reviews advice.... I cooked this in a crock pot during the night and put it in the fridge the next morning. After work, I removed the fat and reheated. Great flavor!

This was awesome! I took the suggestion of another review and used beef broth in place of some water. Mistake! It was too beefy and i apologize for changing it. Next time i will do it as written cause it would have been way better. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This was pretty good, but I disagree that the longer you cook it the better it tastes.  I cooked ours for about 10 hours and I really didn't like the texture of the meat.  I think it would have been better if it weren't cooked so long.

We've been making this for two years now. It is so good and extremely quick and easy to make. I follow the recipe exactly, toast some hoagie buns with provolone cheese on them, and pile with the meat that has been pulled apart with a fork. Very good!

This is a great recipe! I've made it twice now and am going to make it tonight. I did follow a few suggestions, I dissolve 2 packets of beef broth with the water and omit the rosemary ( cause I don't have any) otherwise it's excellent!

This is the best French Dip ever.  I have also thickened the sauce for gravy.  I take this recipe to Football Parties and everyone loves it.  The only thing I do not use is the bouillon.  Use beef broth instead.  Great recipe!

Made this today for dinner.  I read the recipe wrong and added 3 Tablespoons of garlic, but I am not sorry.  I also heeded other reviewers and subbed beef broth for half the water and halved the rosemary. Used my gravy separator to remove the fat from the juice.  I served the beef on baguette and broiled it for a minute to melt some shredded mozzarella.  Served the juice on the side for dipping.  Better than the ones I crave from a local restaurant!

This was very easy and good.  The rosemary was way too strong for me so next time I will only use 1/2 t.   I didn't have beef broth so I used one can french onion soup and 4 cups water.  Had plenty of au jus.  Next time I think I'll use beef broth though.  Thanks for sharing.

Wow, this was so simple, yet so delicious.  I will be making this and have already passed on the recipe.  I put the beef on open faced foccacia bread with a few pepporoncini's.  I covered each with a slice of swiss cheese and put it in the oven for 5 minutes.  Dipping in au jus just puts it over the top!!

Very good recipe. I made it exactly as described and had it on a roll with hot banana peppers and Munster cheese. I might try adding extra spices to the crock pot next time. I like the suggestions of adding Worcester sauce and peppercorns. Can't wait to have the leftovers tonight!

I was leery of this recipe when I smelled it cooking... something odd about the aroma.  And the roast never got tender enough to shred, which is what I wanted.  After 14 frustrating hours of cooking, I put the slow cooker container into the refrigerator and ordered pizza.  Next day I took the roast out of the broth and slice a thin piece and tasted it... HEAVENLY!  I had to nibble thin pieces of meat while I prepared the French dip sandwiches.  Give this recipe a try, everyone!

This meal was simple and delicious, great for busy weeknights.  I prepared the jus the night before (didn't take much time, but didn't want to deal with it in the am) and added it to water and meat in the slowcooker in the morning.  It cooked for about 10 hours, and was perfectly tender but not mushy.  I made the sauce just as described, and it had a rich beef flavor- our guests did not detect soy sauce (in contrast to other reviewers.)  Perhaps the extra long cooking time allowed the flavors to develop.

This was excellent!  The grocery store I shop at was out of chuck roast so I substitued English shoulder roast.  I will definitely make this again.  I'd like to try it with chuck next time. So easy!

This recipe got a 2 thumbs up from my hubby which is saying a lot! I put it all together in the crock pot before work and came home to a wonderful aroma! We ate a few minutes later! Mouth watering delicious! The au jus was the best I have ever tasted!

I have tried this recipe 3 times.  The first two,  I put my slow cooker to high for fear of lack of time.....roast turned out "okay"  maybe a 2 star rating.   BUT!  This time,  using a very cheap cut of beef,  I put it in at 8 am,  took it out at 5:30 pm,  and it was melt in your mouth,  cut with a fork good.  Recipe is perfect as stated with full salt soy sauce not light.  This will now be a weekly workday meal,  even without the buns,  but just for roast!  Thanks :)

I made this tonight and it was really good! I used 2 cans beef broth and 3 cups water. My roast was only about 3 lbs. I took the roast out after about 8 hours of cooking and shredded it. Made sandwiches on toasted rolls with melted swiss cheese and sauteed mushrooms and onions. I served the sauce on the side for dipping. Will make this again! Thanks!

Just loved it! I followed the recipe exactly. And it was not too salty. I did not have any rosemary, so that was ommitted. But it still was wonderful. I served it on sourdough rolls the first night. But on the next several days I grilled it on regular sandwich bread with monterey jack cheese with the meat in between the cheese. Dipped it in the juice...yum so good!

SOOOO  DISAPPOINTED! :( I don't know what I did wrong!!!    I scaled the recipe down  to 4 and followed it to those measurements.  I don't know if it was the overwhelming taste of the rosemary or the extreme saltiness from the soy sauce that turned me off.  The texture of the meat was unappetizing as well.  I was very sad because I LOVE french dip sandwiches and my children are all great eaters and love beef as well.   I definately will not make this again, or if I attempt to, I will use the suggestions of another cook on here and change some of the ingredients.   The good news is, my kids will eat anything, so I didn't have to worry about them being hungry while I had to leave them with a  sitter........ :(

Awesome! i did make some slight changes so the flavor might be slightly different than what was originally intended. i used what i had in my pantry. Instead of rosemary i used dried italian seasoning. i seasoned the roast lightly with black pepper, kosher salt(lightly because of the soy sauce) and garlic powder then seared it off in a dutch oven. added the water and soy sauce, bay leaves and minced garlic and simmered on med low for about 4 and a half hours. Then i added the shredded meat onto a buttered french sub roll with provolone cheese and put it under the broiler to melt the cheese. sprinkled a little italian seasoning on top the melted cheese and chowed down. the au jus put the sandwich over the top. i ate two and cant wait to eat the leftovers!

Did this overnight as suggested so I could chill the broth to skim off the fat.  I used reduced sodium soy sauce, 1 litre reduced sodium beef broth (4 cups) plus 2 cups water.  Everyone raved about it!  I still found it a little salty, so I may use even less broth next time.  Actually, I just put the leftover broth in the freezer for the next time, and will add water to make the 6 cups.  Will definitely do this again.

I was hesitant to try this recipe thinking it would be way too salty for us, but I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor! This was very easy to put together. I followed another suggestion by letting it cook overnight then placing in the refrigerator throughout the day. This didn't last long at our house! I will definitely make this again, especially since my husband keeps requesting it!

This turned out so great, the only change I made was that I could only fit 5 cups of water into my crockpot, but it still came out great and wasn't too salty at all. We added swiss cheese to our toasted buns and these were awesome.

My family loved this recipe.  The meat was so tender and juicy, and there was no work involved to boot.  I will definitely make these again.  We ate them on a toasted white hoagie bun with melted mozarella cheese, mayo and roasted red peppers.  Sooooo good.  Thanks for sharing.

Definatly the best beef ever! I cooked for about 11 hours over night, shredded in the morning and refrigerated all day in the juice. Really yummy! I probably won't use as beef dip again, as we prefer roast beef, but will start buying roast more often!

Made this for hubby this week and he loved it.  Sauteed onions in olive oil and then stirred onions in juice from meat and added a little swiss cheese.  Dipped in juice and it was great!  I did use 1/2 water and 1/2 beef broth.  Goes into our family cookbook.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I made it tonight to rave reviews from my inlaws.  I made it exactly as suggested and it turned out great.  I did use reduced sodium soy sauce. I can't wait to have a cold beef and mustard sandwich tomorrow with the left overs.  Thanks for the recipe. It's a keeper for our house.

This was soooo good. I used thyme instead of rosemary, 1 can beef broth, and 1 can Campbell's French Onion soup. I did as others suggested and cooked over night then refridgerated all day. Warmed back up to serve. The beef is good but the au jus was the best I've ever had!

Incredible soft, flavorful meat with rich dipping sauce. Beef broth and toasted italian/french bread is a must. Add a couple of slices of avocado, and this sandwich is unbeatable.

I am always suspicious of a recipe title like this, but I gotta say, it really was the best ever.  Cheap cut of meat, stupid easy, and really delicious!  My man loved loved loved it.  The kids were not into the au jus, but loved the meat.  Served on soft brioche buns from Trader Joe's-- yum!

Unlike some others (!) I start by making this recipe "As-Is" and rate it before tweaking.  It is a solid "very good" and very easy to make.  For the second time, I made some changes for personal taste.  I put in coriander and a chopped onion.  I did 1/2 cup soy sauce, 4 1/2 cups water and 1 cup beef broth.  I liberally sprinkled in some worcestshire sauce.  I cooked it for 8 hours, removed the meat, sliced it and then put it back in for 2 hours.

We loved this recipe.  I thought it was the best I have ever had and better than any resturant.  The only changes I did was as suggested: substitute 5 cups beef broth for 5 cups water and add 1 cup water.  I also a couple hours before serving took the roast out and cut into deli thin slices( took about 45 mins. but well worth it) and then put back into pot to continue cooking for at least 1-2 hours.  Make the beef juicy and tender.  I baked some steak rolls in the oven open with provlone cheese first and then we added meat.  Found the next day meat became more tender and juicy.

A little rosemary goes a long way for me, so it isn't my favorite beef dip recipe.  The roast turned out excellently, however, and I likely do it again, only cutting down quite a bit on the amount of rosemary.  If you like the taste of rosemary, then this is definitely the recipe for you!

The meat was a little drier than I had hoped.  Also, instead of just water I wish I would have added some beef broth, the au jus had too much soy sauce flavor.

This recipe was truely wonderful!!!! Because I was doing it for a large crowd, I placed everything in a turkey size oven bag from Reynolds...and slow cooked the bag in the oven. 
  Everyone enjoyed. I served it sliced with side dishes of lightly fried onions, red peppers, mushrooms, swiss cheese and monster cheese. Some of the company wanted rolls and others wanted the meat served in a dish. 
   Thanks!!!

I would give you more than a "5" rating if I could.  This has got to be the best sandwich I have ever had.  I am from Chicago and they are famous for their "Italian Beef Sandwiches" I have made it before but it requires slicing the roast very thin and that in itself makes me think twice about making it.  But after I tried your recipe I believe I like it better. The meat shredded so easy it was like butter, I followed the other folks advice and after I made the beef I stored it in the fridge overnight and it was just wonderful the following day.  My family all loved it and devoured it, they were even reserving some in their name for later (lol) I doubled the recipe because I wanted to freeze half for another time but it didn't work out that way.  I couldn't stop my family from eating it. Next time I'll know better.  This is definitely going on my permanent cook book of "tried and loved it meals"  can't wait till I make it again.  I love wonderful tasting food and easy to make.
Thanks again for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This was awesome!  Easy, inexpensive, and yummy!  I made it as written except for adding a bit more garlic (I add more garlic to just about everything!)and I use low sodium soy sauce so I didn't have a problem with it being too salty. THe first nite we had it on steak rolls with melted provolone and it was scrumptious!  The kids had fun dipping their sandwiches in the gravy, They made a bit of a mess but it was fun and they ate it all up with a nice big salad and some home-made lemonade.  The next nite I made up a big pot of brown rice and we ate it over that and it was a big hit again; and it also was a bit better I think because I was able to take the fat off the top before I heated everything up.  Thanks for a great easy recipe, this will be a staple in our home from now on!

This really is the best beef dip ever! It has quickly become one of my favorites (I make it almost once a week!) I serve it on crusty bread with some provolone or mozzarella melted on top and it's delicious every time- and couldn't be any easier! Thanks so much for this recipe

This is a great recipe!!!  The only thing I changed was instead of 6 cups of water, I used 4 cups of beef broth.  It cooked on low for about 9 hours.  I shredded it and then let it cook on low for about another hour.  Half of us ate it over rice, the other half ate it in a sandwich.

This recipe is the bomb!  Has had great success in my house.  My girls adore this recipe and would continue eating it until they burst open if I would allow it.  Sooooo incredibly easy and very tasty.  This is a great way to use up chuck roast when you are sick of the traditional roasts!  I couldnt say thank you enough for this recipe...My families new favorite!

Yummy!  Took the advice of others and used 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce.  Also used beef broth and added 1/2 pkg of dry onion soup.  Cut Rosemary in 1/2.
Will definitely be making this again!

I made this for my husband and mother in law and they both loved it and have asked me to make it again.  I did alter the recipe quite a bit to suit my tastes.  I will definatley be making this again.  I changes it as follows:
1) I used beef broth instead of water
2) I substituted one cup of broth/water with white wine.
3) Added 3 chopped shallots 
4) Added one package of shitake mushrooms sliced
5) Added a packet of "Peppercorn Steak Sauce" seasoning packet and rubbed it all over the meat before placing in the crock pot and seasoning it with all other ingrediants.
6) Added 1 teaspoon of peppercorns.

I didn't have any issue with the soy sauce overpowering the meal, but I think the wine might have tamed it a bit.

I have made this twice. Everybody loved it.  I used more meat than called for because you must trim all the fat off.  I used half the water.  Before serving I removed the meat to a cutting board and shredded it with 2 forks.  I skimmed some of the fat from the liquid and returned the shredded beef to the crock.  Served w/jar of Italian pepper mix on the side.  GREAT and EASY.

I was not impressed with this recipe.  It did come out incredibly tender but the flavor was very plain.  If I would have known, I think browning the roast before placing it in the crockpot would have given it a better flavor. I have a french dip recipe that is alot better than this.

This is excellent.  I made this for my husband, and i'm not really allowed to eat it since it's made with soy sauce, but i sampled a little and i wanted to eat it all, it was perfect.  I did use low sodium soy sauce.

Excellent.  The sauce is fantastic.  My meat turned out a tad dry, but that isnt the fault of the recipe.  I added a few peppercorns to the sauce, and didnt exactly add 6 cups of water.  Just enough to cover the meat.  Very good!

This recipe is so GOOD!! I half'd the recipe because I have a small family, so I didn't need to cook as long.

We liked this, but can't say I would make it on a regular basis as it did not blow me away.  Has good flavor, but not good enough for me to give this 5 stars.

Terrific! A great home cooked meal without any hard work. This will come in handy in the weeks after the twins are born, hubby can assemble without any difficulty! Smells great when cooking and comes out delicious and tender. My crockpot is small so I halved the water and soy sauce and didn't have rosemary so skipped it, also used garlic powder b/c it's what I had. Still was great and my toddler had no problem chewing it. Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow - way too much salt!! Take the recommendations and reduce the soy sauce by half. Otherwise, it is a very tasty and easy meal to make.

I made this the other night and we all loved it.  We are big french dip fans, and this recipe so far is the best one I have found.  It is great to come home and have your meal almost done for you.  I did put the sandwiches together and put in the oven for a few minutes to let the cheese melt ontop.  I really did like the sauce from this, my kids kept dipping thier french fries in it.  A keeper if you are a working mom.

Awesome!  The first time I made it I skipped out on the spices and it turned out horrible.  I decided to try again and follow the recipe and it was to die for!  We added some provolone to the crusty french rolls and we both ate two!  This will be in regular rotation for sure for a long long time.

Good recipe, and easy, but I wouldn't say its the best ever.  The rosemary is quite strong, so make sure you like rosemary a lot before adding it!  Also next time I would use the recommendation of another user that said to put the herbs in a tied coffee filter to make it easier to serve - the au jus needed to be strained a few times.  I trimmed all fat from the roast I used, otherwise it would have been a quite fatty.

I give this recipe high marks for being easy to prepare.  It smelled wonderful as it was cooking but I thought my end result was just okay.  Acceptable for a weeknight dinner but not something I would serve for company.  The au jus had a nice flavor & because I had plenty left over, I used it as a stock for veggie soup the next day.  My soup was wonderful!  Bottom line for me, a no fuss recipe that allowed me to make two easy slow cooker meals.

Truly, the best Beef dip I've ever had.  No one could stop eating until it was completely gone! As an addition, I threw in lots of mushrooms, making it even more appealing to the appetite!  This is a definite MUST for the FOOTBALL SEASON!

I used a 2 lb. chuck roast and didn't cut down on any of the other ingredients.  I cooked it for 6 hours one night and 4-5 hours the next day!  I served on toasted french sub rolls, with mozzarella and "Homemade Horseradish" which is found on this website.  My hubby and I really loved it.  Thanks Lori for the best beef dip ever!

I did follow the recipe to the letter and we felt this was average.  Maybe it was the roast or the soy sauce I used.  It was extremely oily. Also, I overcooked it so the meat was too mushy.  It did taste better the next day on sandwiches, but I couldn't use the sauce for dipping (because of the oiliness).  Instead I made a mix french dip sauce.  I'm not sure if I will try again.  Sorry :-(

The aroma alone is worth the effort--drove us crazy all day waiting for dinner.  I made half of the recipe so that it would fit in my standard size crockpot as others had suggested.  Also, I didn't have a roast on hand and used boneless beef short ribs instead.  Fabulous.  I shredded the beef, piled it on rolls with tomato slices, sweet red onion rings, and a slice of provolone, then ran it under the broiler to melt the cheese.  We added a small amount of horseradish too.  On the first taste, my husband closed his eyes and moaned.  Can't get much better than that,  except the leftovers the next day were even better.

Just as advertised; easy with great taste. I also used lite soy sauce & 1 C less water (otherwise wouldn't fit my crock pot). Do serve with a horseradish sauce and crusty French bread for dipping.

I think it was the delicious and so did my family!  I followed the recipe with the exception where I took some advice and I used 3 cups low sodium beef broth and 3 cups water. I definitely feel the addition of the Beef broth was needed. I may even increase it to 4 cups beef broth next time.  If I don’t increase the broth I may add tomato paste for some additional tang. Definitely a great recipe and easy to adjust for personal preference!!

Au ju', came so close! Why not make this way more healthy and lower sodium while at the same time add a weight loss benefit? I would have given 5 stars but, in my opinion, folks look to this site when they lack the knowledge to produce really good food. 1 teeny & 1 BIG change, cost a star, the tiny one? Most of you almost chef's, know that great beef requires pre-season directions, and after cooking, resting. Wouldn't you agree? One year ago when I first made use of these wonderful cooking ideas, I had nto a clue! Making several, not bad, meals later, I found great recipes like this one, with how to season and finish a good cut of beef ( or even better) a cheap one! The big change I make to this great recipe is, replace the soy ( very high sodium & pesticides ) using Braggs liquid amino acids instead. Most store's and all healthy food stores carry this, a hugely more healthy alternative to even low sodium soy, and can be used in any recipe that calls for soy sauce in the spoon for spoon measure. And you get a bonus of about a dozen additional health benefits  from the Braggs, that are hard to get anywhere else.

The meat turned out perfectly tender and well seasoned. I did not find it too salty or tasting too much of rosemary, but then again, I like rosemary quite a bit. Next time, I think I'll add peppercorns at the suggestion of another reviewer. I will definitely make this again!

This was very good. I used sliced Angus roast beef and simmered all on stove top. I adjusted for the reviews that indicated to half the rosemary, swap beef broth for water and followed the recipe as written thereafter. Served on homemade garlic hoagie rolls, halved and toasted with sliced baby Swiss.

I guess I am the minority on this one. The list of ingredients for the jus was a little wierd. Adding them I was even more doubtful since I dont like rosemary or bay leaves but had them on hand. Smelling it, I wasnt quite sure but tasting it was very clear. Gross. Not a good combo at all and I only used half of the soy. Had I used it all, the meat would have been unsalvageable. If I had cooked it ten hours on low it also would have been extremely dry. I did six hours on low and it was plenty. I woke at 4 am to put this in the fridge and almost splashed myself when I took it out with a giant fork because it fell all over the place. Mind you, thats great for the meat but not great when you dont have clothes on to protect yourself, lol. Anyway, I kept tasting the broth just to make sure I didnt like it and sadly it didnt get any better. At least I can pour it off and make a gravy for the meat later.  I would never try this again. A can of mushroom soup is better or a packet of store bought au jus is better. Im thankful I didnt waste a bunch of good ingredients. Oh well,cooking is all about experimenting and we all have different tastes.

This was really great!!!  My husband usually doesn't like meat done in a slow cooker because it can be dry.  This was not!!!  I did add a few teaspoons of beef base to it as it cooked.  I made it the day before,  shredded the meat and removed the fat, then put in the refrigerator over night.  I took it out the next afternoon and pulled off the fat that had come to the top.  I reheated if for 2-3 hours, served on french rolls with provolone.  Excellent!!!  Will definitely be making this again!!!

I made this for tonight's dinner, following a couple of Crystal S.'s suggestions (to reduce the rosemary to 1/2 tablespoon, and replace 4 cups of the water with 4 cups of low sodium beef broth).  Our 4 lb roast cooked on low for ten hours. It and the au jus were delicious!  I served it on franchese rolls that I first buttered and broiled.  A family hit!  I will never use powdered or concentrated au jus broth again.

I had a 2.5 pound chuck roast so I reduced the spices some as well as used 2/3 c low sodium soy sauce and 4 cups water. The taste was really good but it seemed very greasy, like more so than a beef sandwich from any local joint.

We make this a lot at home,  big hit with the family ... only thing I do different,  is instead of mincing garlic ... I throw a bunch of whole peeled garlic cloves in ..  everyone likes to dig a couple out to spread on their toasted bun.

Pretty good! Since I had a 2 1/2 lb roast, I used 4 cups water, 1/3 cup soy sause, and 1/3 cup worcestershire sauce. I cooked it in a pressure cooker & we were eating 45 minutes later.  Everyone liked so I will definitely make again.

Okay I will admit I was very skeptical about trying this recipe. This was DELICIOUS! We made french dip sandwiches. My husband kept saying over and over how good it was.
Hint for a good french dip: Put swiss cheese on your bun and toast it in the oven for a few minutes. Wonderful!

I do not like to cook because my husband is so hard to please.  This so easy and one of his favorite meals!!  He asks for this weekly.:-!  Easy and not hard to make at all. The only thing I change is a 2-3lb boneless chuck roast, 1/2 C soy sauce and 3 C beef broth.  It is delicious, definatley a must try!!

sigh...I was SO excited to find this recipe...however, the soy sauce is overpowering.  I am trying to salvage the roast, and trying a different recipe for au jus.  Maybe I expect too much for a good au jus recipe...everyone else rating this seems to love it. bummer for us & the roast.

I, and my family, LOVED this!  It is a little salty, so maybe next time I will use less soy sauce, or use low sodium soy sauce.  This recipe is a keeper!

Made this with regular beef broth and halved the soy sauce with water and it was wayyyyy too salty. I love salt but the broth and the soy sauce was a bit much. I haven't made the recipe per the directions but I know that using broth and soy sauce is not advisable.. we like the pepperocini beef better and its easier.

I thought this was awesome.  I always use broth instead of water for flavor, but otherwise I left it on for 10 hours and was amazing!  Everyone in our five person household loved it!  Will be doing this one more often for sure!

This really is the easiest recipe ever...and with that being said, it really is delicious! Having provolone cheese on a toasted bun is really the only thing you need for this dish.  It may be missing one or two spices to really make it the perfect dish but still one of the best beef dips ever!

Fantastic recipe. Perhaps the best beef dip sandwich I've ever had. I replaced the beef chuck roast with a tri tip roast, used beef broth instead of water, and added a whole onion. Very good!!

sooo good and simple...I used 4c. low sodium beef broth 2c. water,  3/4 c. of Bragg with 1/4 c. low sodium soy. Also added in a sliced onion and extra garlic.  Amazing...served on a french baguette with melted cheese and horseradish sauce with the au jus for dipping. Became two different meals because I froze the left over au jus and used it for homemade French onion soup...which was really good! I Caramelized one onion in 2 tbl butter, added au jus and simmered until almost boiling...poured into oven safe bowls, added a piece of toasted ciabatta bread and topped with cheese (slice of swiss, shredded italian blend and extra parmesan) and broiled them until cheese became golden and crusty.

So glad I made this, mine was done in about 7 hours..I couldn't wait any longer it smelled so good! Plenty of au jus for dipping, and plently for left overs that heat up well. To some people who prefer less salt, you might want to try a lower sodium soy sauce is the only thing I'd say, personally I think it's fine and wouldn't change a thing!

I expected this to be much better based on the name.  The only modifications I had were low sodium soy sauce (def could've been a factor) and I added a little more garlic just because I like it.  I agree with other posters that the flavor with the soy sauce is a little odd and in the future I will use a recipe with more of a beef broth base.

This was really good, but it seemed to be missing something.  That being said, there are no leftovers:)  Plus, it was great since all of us were running in different directions for dinner tonight (3 different seatings and 1 sandwich to go in the car).

I love this, my kid's loved it, but my husband thought it was bit to much like onion soup.  I think I added to much of the onion.  Next time I will decrease the onion, and use a larger roast.

This was wonderful!  My husband says that I could make it twice a week as far as he is concerned.  I made a half portion as my roast was only 2.5 lb.  Used beef broth rather than water.  Was a bit salty for my taste, but still really good.

This was super good! I used the crock pot (6 hrs -I didn't have any more time than that if I wanted to sep out the fat!), and as others mentioned I decr the amt of soy sauce and used a low sodium one.  After cooling and scraping off excess fat, I added garlic powder to the au jus nd a little fresh horseradish.  I prepared the bread like a garlic bread and broiled before putting the meat on.  After putting the meat on bread I broiled it for a few min. to melt cheese and then dipped entire sandw into juice. Got the thumbs up from the whole fam.!

WONDERFUL RECIPE! I did change it by adding 2 cups of red wine in place of 2 cups of water. I was also out of fresh garlic so I used about 1 TBS of garlic powder instead. Of course the roast was from a local meat market so it was fresh and delicious. This is in my recipe box!

Really good receipe! I made this last night and my family really loved it. I reduced the soy sauce by 1/2 amid the warnings of the saltiness. I still thought it was a little too salty. Next time I will further reduce the soy sauce to about 1/4 and see if that helps.

Excellent Recipe!! I was amazed how good it turned out. The au jus tasted mellow but rich. The beef was very tender and had lots of flavor. Great with toasted Hoagie bun & swiss cheese. Definitely a hit with my friends!!!

This is amazing! I did make a few changes like adding a can of french onion soup, using half soy and half Worchestire sauce and also I used beef broth instead of water. It was so tender and juicy!!! My family ate all of it and I was hoping on left overs for lunch!!!!

Good, tender, and juicy. I would decrease the amount of soysauce next time. And, less rosemary, maybe add another spice into the mix.

Yes this was fantastic! Be sure to cook it for 8-10 hours, the longer it cooks, the better it gets. We put the leftovers on rice instead of on bread and it was just as good, if not better!

Great recipe. I strained the sauce before serving as au jus. Also, I shredded the meat and let it sit in some of the broth so that it was nice and juicy and not dry. My family loved it too!

Absolutely wonderful!  We had a lot of au jus left, so I put it in the freezer to use as a soup base later.  I added the Lipton onion soup mix per other reviews, and it was fantastic.

Made this yesterday.  Used 1 can beef broth and 1 can french onion soup and then water to make up the rest of the liquid.  It was great!!  The meat is perfect for french dip sandwiches!

Great beef dip. I did as some of the others suggested and added a package of onion soup mix and half the amount of Soya Sauce. I also added 1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce just because I love the taste it gives soups and stews etc.  This is definitely the best beef dip recipe I have found.

I cut the water in half and, to cut down on saltiness but still give flavour used Marmite instead of commercial beef stock for flavour (Marmite is a spread like Vegemite, hugely popular in Australia and New Zealand...its very in good this, my partner is Kiwi he suggested it :) )

This is going to be our Easter dinner :)

Excellent recipe...I would use 1 1/2 cp low sodium soy sauce next time and a little less water maybe 5 cps for more taste.

This was pretty good.  The kids really enjoyed the meat however I found it hard to slice the meat thin enough for easy sandwich eating.  I used a beef chuck roast.  I took other reviewers advice and halved the soy sauce and rosemary.  I also used 3 cups water and 3 cups beef broth instead of using all water.  I probably wont make this again because my other recipe takes 30 minutes instead of the all day crock pot method.  Thanks though.  I love trying something new!

I don't eat beef but my family loved this! My husband was especially happy with the recipe. I loved how easy it was. And there was plenty of left overs.

It was good.  Took other's advice and omitted rosemary, halved soy sauce (and used low sodium), added some beef broth and a can of French onion soup as well as lots more garlic.  May have gone too far by adding a packet of dry onion soup mix -- was a little salty.  Cooked it overnight so I could chill it during the day and remove fat (thanks for the suggestion).  Meat was tender flavor was good.  Husband liked it and is glad there are leftovers.

Quick, simple, easy, and delicious.  I make this at least once a month.  I never get a complaint when I serve this.  The only ingredient I modified was the garlic.  You can never have enough, that's what I think.

Very good. This turned out very very tender. I used low sodium soy sauce as other reviews stated, would like the au jus to be a little more beefy tasting though. I added one pack of lipton onion soup mix shredded the beef and removed the fat and had no bay leaves. I would try beef broth and 1/2 the soy sauce next time.

My whole family really liked this, and I have picky eaters.  The only thing I changed I used lite soy instead of regular.  The boys said it was even better the next day, then ate up all the meat with some juice left, and went to the store and got some sliced roast beef so we could finish it up. Delicious!

Sorry but it was not as good as I thought it would be.  Perhaps it was due to the fresh rosemary I used.  It had too strong of a taste.  Maybe use dried or omit the rosemary.

Great Recipe.  I used some of the other review ideas, like the beef broth & french onion soup.  I was concerned that the meat was going to be tough, but it was tender and delicious.  My husband says he wants all the roasts done this way from now on.  He loved it.

Hubby and I didn't really care for this. The Rosemary was a little overwhelming and the roast wasn't tender even after cooking for 8 hours!!! Maybe my fault but flavor wasn't up to par.

We just love this beef and dip, the only change I make is to use low sodium soy sauce.  By far one of the easiest and best crock pot recipes ever.

This was just okay.  I found that the au jus was way too oily with not enough flavor.  I let it cool and skimmed a lot of the fat off and then it was a little better.  The beef turned out nice and tender and was pretty tasty by itself without the sauce.

This roast smells very good while cooking. I did not have any regular soy sauce so I used 1/4c teriyaki soy and 1/2 can of beef broth with the water. I can not hold that much liquid in my crockpot but it still turned out great. Even my picky boys loved it. Thanks for the great easy recipe!

As written, I'd give this 3-4 stars.  Add melted provolone, pepperoncini rings (plus some of their juice) and/or horseradish and it's 5 stars all the way.  Like a previous reviewer I let everything sit in the fridge overnight then (easily) lifted off the layer of hardened fat.

I’m very sorry for the rating, but it came out really hard and the taste was bland, I ended up throwing away more than half.  I love soy sauce and many reviewers say it was tender and delicious.  I don’t know what did go wrong and I can’t see why I mess up with this easy recipe.

The name says it all!  This was delicious.  My husband said it tasted better than the beef dip sandwiches you get in a restaurant.  I will definitely make this over and over. I also sauteed onions and green pepper in olive oil, then added it to the sandwich with some mozzerella cheese and melted it in the oven for a few minutes.  YUM!!!

Excellent! I loved the blends of flavors and the tender meat. I cut back on the soy sauce and put less spice than called for. (I was afraid my kids would not like these spices, especially if they were strong.) Instead of sandwiches, we had the meat and au jus with "Sour Cream Refrigerator Mashed Potatoes" (from this site) and it was very good. Most of my kids liked it fairly well (a few just dislike any kind of meat). I will definitely be making this regularly. I love recipes that have just a few ingredients and are super easy as this one is.

I cooked this in a hotel room and it worked great.  This recipe was awesome!  I did half the recipe for my small "travel" crock pot and used fresh rosemary, but otherwise made no modifications to this.  My husband hates soy sauce and still raved about the juice.  I can't say enough.  We bought some french bread, then topped it with the meat, diced tomatoes and baby swiss cheese, ran it under the toaster oven broiler.  Delicious!

This beef dip recipie is wonderfull and so easy!  You can put it in the crock pot in the morning and know that when dinner time comes it's ready!  I have 3 kids (ages 3,4, and 10) and they all love it as well.  I usually buy sub rolls or onion rolls and prepare french fries to serve with it.  We usually have this dinner once a month and I have commited the recipie to memory.  Remember though, if you use a regular size oval crock pot you may need to reduce the ingredients by 1/2.

Just tried this recipe yesterday. It is the best and easiest I've ever made. The rosemary is a little much so, I cut it down a bit to 1/2 tablespoon and use lite soy sauce. Great Taste! Will defenatley make again. :)

This was a winner on more than one level.  It was tasty, the prep was easy, and it didn't matter if dinner came later than you expected..as extra time in the crock pot didn't hurt it.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was to add beef bouillon granules to the liquid (I guess I was uneasy with so much soy sauce) but it probably would have been fine without this addition.  I served the meat on toasted hoagie buns along with some mozzarella and onions.  The sauce made a great "au jus" for dipping.  Thx for the post, Lori.

The best ever? Nah. Pretty good? Yeah. It was a touch on the bland side. However, I would make this again because it was so easy. Next time I will top mine with pepperoncini, that will add a ton of flavor.

Tasted Great! I followed the recipe, except I only used a 1/2 tsp of rosemary(it's a very overpowering spice) & a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. I will make this again.  The secret is the soy sauce!

This was so easy to make and so delicious. I threw everything in the crock pot before work and had a delicious week night dinner. Definitely serve this with bread... you don't want to throw away any of the au jus. It's a keeper!

Terrific recipe. Delicious. Added more bay leaf and fresh ground pepper. After cooking, I removed the pieces of meat and shredded them, then put back in the crock pot. Yes, there is a lot of fat but you can remove that simply by putting the crock pot in the refrigerator. The next day, pluck the fat layer off. Very good recipe. Will make this again. Cannot beat the simplicity of this dish.

Tried it today with great success. We all loved it and will see how much better it becomes with the leftovers. I did use lite soy sauce and it was not too salty. My husband says to add mushrooms as well next time.

It was a hit with one out of six family members.  Maybe our tastes are simple, but the rosemary was just too strong.  Even the smell it left in the house made us not want to try this again

You know it's a good recipe when there are no leftovers.   This would be a great recipe when you know you'll have a busy night.  It's very simple to put together in the morning and then serve at supper time.  It's tasty, filling and everyone enjoyed it.

5 stars! Made this for my family (plus 2 toddlers who are picky) and everyone LOVED it! Super easy to make. I did use another users suggestions and used 4 cups beef broth and 2 cups water. Then served over soft buns with garlic mayo and provolone. Yum! Will definitely make again :)

This was the first time to use this recipe.  Nevertheless, this is the fourth time in a twelve month period to make this "Dip".  I give it three stars only because the soy sauce (low salt) made this too, well..., too soy-ee.  In my first three previous Dips I used a can of Cambells Beef Consume instead of the soy sauce and two cans of Campbells French Onion, two cups beef broth, then applicable amount of water.  And one time I seared the chuck roast prior, (of which did not make any difference to me) Regardless, the spices added went well and the dish was good.

I love how it turned out! I made it using 3 pounds and excluding the rosemary since I didn't have any. I reduced the water to about 3 cups, just enough to cover the meat. My crock pot is very small and everything fits just right to not spill over. I cooked it for about 12 hours on low since I fell asleep and didn't wake up to turn it off till the next day haha It turned out amazing! I will be making it again definitely!

Oh yes...I made this overnight in my slow cooker and am eating it for lunch right now. Soooo good!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I use 2 thick cut top sirloin steaks. Strained the au jus. I separated the meat and the au jus and placed in the fridge for dinner tonight, but had to take this to work with me!

I'm eating it with swiss chesse melted on top and on a "French Roll To Die For" (recipe is on this site). This is absolutely delicious! Thanks for sharing this recipe. I will be making it often.

I replaced 2 cups of the water with beef broth & only used around 2/3 c soy sauce as that's all I had.  It was excellent; next time I'll try the recipe as written but expect it will be great.

Used 4 cups beef broth and 1 cup water for added flavor. Good sandwich meat. Also used a rolled rump roast, a little over 3 pounds.

It was good, added a bit of chopped onions for flavour. Used fresh rosemary and garlic, plus 2/3 beef broth. I agree that it needed an additional boost, will make it again with perhaps a few more herbs.

This really was the best beef dip ever! I did only use 1/2 cup of soy sauce, and I used the chicken stock vs water, IT WAS DELICIOUS! Next time I may use just a bit less rosemary as well; but to each their own on rosemary. Whoever came up with this is a cooking genius!

It was good. Definitely needed something extra, like beef broth to give it flavor. The amount of au jus is a lot in this dish.

This was really good.  I'll use low sodium soy sauce next time.  I didn't really get started early enough so I put it in a 275 degree oven  for 3 1/2 hrs instead and the flavor was great.

Oh, how I love making this. Serve with Italian bread along with homemade mashed potatoes and applesauce, you'll have a meal that people will sure to love. Unless you don't like people, in that case, make sure your doors are locked. :)

This is amazing! I have been begged to make it again ASAP! I could not find a roast quite as big as what is asked for but still used the same amount of all the other ingredients. I did use low-sodium soy sauce as some reviews suggested. I put the rosemary and bay leaves in cheese cloth and let them float in the liquid during cooking.

I am a vegetarian but my boyfriend isn't. My boyfriend LOVED it. He said it was a 10 out of 10. He ate 2 bowls very quickly and licked the bowl. After reading the reviews about having too much rosemary and soy sauce I was a bit nervous but it turned out perfectly. I will make this again. NOTE- I cooked in the slow cooker for 6 hours.

Very good and flavorful, not to mention...EASY!  I made a few small changes to it. I added garlic power in addition to fresh garlic and some pepper.  I used a smaller amount of meat 2.5-3 pounds so I decreased the water to 4 cups since 4 cups fully covered the meat in the crock pot.  I cooked it for 6 hours on low and then let it sit on warm until I got home from work and we were ready to eat.

A family (and friend) favorite! Be sure to place the spices in a paper tea bag to keep the au juis  clear. We butter and broil the buns, melt pepper jack cheese on the meat and the end result is PURE HEAVEN.

Very good!  I cut the recipe in half based on size of my roast, added a few peppercorns, 3 garlic cloves, a thick slice of onion and a splash of Worchestire sauce.  The broth would definitely make a good French Onion soup.

I followed the recipe except used broth instead of water as others suggested. The beef was very tender, but the au jus was not very flavorful. I skimmed the fat off, then  returned the remaining liquid to the slow cooker. I think it would be much better with less liquid or more herbs/spices, as other reviewers have suggested.

This was easy, although I wish I had allowed for time to let the jus cool, so as to skim some fat. Delicious. I had no Rosemary, used peppercorns and subbed Worcestershire sauce for 25% of recommended soy sauce.

This was great I made them with ciabatta buns,cooked roast for 10 hours and it was falling apart!  Sautéed mushrooms, onion and red peppers in a homemade sweet onion sauce!  Broiled buns with Swiss cheese and veggies then added garlic mayo and beef!  Very selfish!  Was a favorite of mine and my husband!

Absolutely delicious! I listened to other reviewers' suggestions and decreased the rosemary to 2 tsp instead of 1 tbsp and substituted 2 cups beef broth for 2 cups of the water, and added 1/2 cup finely chopped onion. I actually put my roast completely frozen in the crockpot on low and 7 hours later it was done..the meat is so tender it just falls apart, it is super easy to shred. I served the meat on sub buns toasted in the oven with provolone cheese on top and au jus on the side. The au jus is delicious! All in all will definitely make again..adding it into my monthly rotation.

This was great!  Cut the soy sauce in half and it was still almost too salty but it was still delicious.  Made gravy out of the juice the next day and had hot beef sandwiches.  The third day made beef & noodles out of it.  Wonderful!

This was good. A little salty even for me. Will make again and just tone down the soy sauce. My husband on the other hand thought it was perfect!

Like some others, I was a little skeptical about the amount of soy sauce. But it is so delicious, not too much at all. I served this with mashed potatoes and cheesy creamed spinach. Clean plates all around the table, and even 2nd helpings. Excellent recipe.

This is a great recipe.  Just make sure you get a good cut of meat and let it could long enough.  My family eats these up.  I make enough for two days - it tastes even better the second day.

Pretty good, I took the advice of others, and slow cooked the roast through the night, refridgerated it through the day and ate it for dinner. Very easy! Great flavor. I would have to say that because the roast is shredded it is kind of difficult to keep it in the bread, but good none the less. It does make more than enough dipping juice, but it needs all the moisture to keep the roast moist.

This recipe is so simple and wonderful.  It makes amazing beef dip sandwiches.  We made a really large roast, so I used the rest to make a nice beef veggie soup, and the au jus was a great base for it.  I've also used the meat to make pot pie...very simple and yummy.

Excellent, esp the next day.  This made a LOT of au jus..so I will probably half the liquid mixture. I also used low sodium soy which turned out great to us!

This is one of the best crock pot recipes I've ever tried.  My whole family loves it.  I use McCormic crushed rosemary to avoid large pieces.  We add sliced provolone & horseradish to the sandwich.  Awesome!!!

This was good, but nothing special. I thought that it tasted a bit like soggy beef jerky. I cooled the juices to remove the fat, but it still had a pretty fatty taste to it. I sauteed some green peppers and onions and topped it with some swiss cheese. My husband liked it, but it just wasn't as good as I was hoping.

I thought this was very tasty, although the rosemary seemed to overpower the juice a bit.  I will probably make this again, cutting back on the rosemary.

I have to agree with the title! This is one of the best beef recipes that I have tried in a long time. I added fresh rosemary from my garden and about 5 cloves of garlic and it comes out great every single time. The house just smells AMAZING when you are cooking this. I make this recipe about twice a month. Soo glad that I tried it!

This was a hit! I followed some of the other suggestions for 1/2 beef broth and low sodium soy sauce and it was great. We put it on hard rolls with horseradish sauce, cheese, and sauteed onions, peppers and mushrooms. Just like the graet sandwich placecs!

Rubbed the roast with Montreal Steak Seasoning and browned before putting into the slow cooker to give it an appetizing color.  I suggest using low-sodium soy sauce so the salt doesn't overwhelm the other flavors.  Use half-beef broth and half-water for the 6 cups of water.

YUM! My whole family enjoyed this..even the 5 yr old. Only thing I added was some provolone cheese to the sandwiches & toasted them under the broiler for about 5 minutes. Even better w sauteed onion, peppers & mushrooms & a little horseradish. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This was really good. Of course I messed with it but I'm sure had I left it as is, it would've been wonderful too! Instead of dried rosemary I used 2 sprigs of fresh. It was too much though - next time I'll use just 1 sprig. Also, since I didn't have a whole cup of soy, I used a 1/2 cup but then used a 1/2 cup red wine and decreased the water to 5 cups since 6 was too much for my cooker. I also seared the roast in olive oil before I put it in but everything else was the same. I then toasted some hoagies and we had wonderful French dip! I cooked it for about 6 hours on high (didn't have 10 hours to wait!) and it was tender and juicy - perfect! Then I used the rest of the broth for my vegetable beef soup the next day.  This one definitely stays in my recipe box!

This was great!  I tinkered with the recipe and found that probably should have stuck with the origional.  I used 1/2cup light soy sauce and 1/2 cup beef broth.  Next time I think I will use a full cup of light soy.  Other than that it was WONDERFUL!  We will be making this again.

This was just okay!  The meat was a little dry.  Next time I might use a different cut of meat.  Good flavor though.

This was great. I did use less rosemary and add one extra cup of water.  I will definately use this recipe again.  Thanks

I said 3 but I think it was really  2 1/2 stars. The au jus is very powerful. I think if i ever make it again i will cut the soy sauce to a 1/2 cup. We added cheese to ours as well.

This was tasty but even though I cooked it for 9 1/2 hours my roast was just starting to get tender. It was too much for my 3 1/2 quart crock pot. I will try this one again but cut back on the soy sauce and rosemary.  You really have to like these flavors to use the whole amount.

pretty darn good, a little too salty and you definitely have to strain the dipping juice, but overall good!

the meat came out very very tender..but that's all I liked. I find that 1 tablespoon of *any* dried herb is a bit too much, unless you really like it. overall it was ok. good on a sandwich with provalone cheese.

This is absolutely wonderful!! I will make this roast again and again and can't wait to share  with my friends.  This recipe does not need any substitutions, it is great as written.  The only change I will make is to buy the largest roast the store has in the case.  Thank you for a wonderful, easy meal!!

My husband loved this.  I liked it, but thought there was too much of a soy sauce flavor.  Next time I think I'll cut out 1/3 cup of the soy sauce and substitute a can of beef bouillion for one of the cups of water.  We also served this on toasted french bread with provolne cheese.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yum!  I added beef broth instead of water thinking it would need more flavor.  The first day we had it it was great, leftovers were a little salty.  Next time I think I would use half beef broth half water.  Either way, it is delicious and just what we were looking for!

The fact that this was easy to prepare appealed to me. 
But it was not done in the time frame given.
 I would prepare this recipe again but as stated by others the Rosemary is a bit overpowering I added 1 tsp. minced onion and omitted 1 of the bay leaves. Overall this recipe was a keeper.

This recipe was actually very good.  My husband always makes the roast, it's his thing - but this time I made it and used this recipe which was very different from his.  He even liked it.  I used a lower fat oven roast and trimmed off visible fat - we never use chuck roasts, they are way to fatty for us.  I saw that some reviewers didn't like the fat on the top of the au jus, and I can tell you that there wasn't any fat on top of ours.  The only thing we didn't like is that the au jus has a little too much soy flavor.  Next time we will add less soy sauce.  I used my pressure cooker to make this, which worked out beautifully, as always.  Very tender meat.  I live at a high altitude, so it took about an hour and a half - lower altitudes could cook it in about an hour.  The next time I make this I will also add some onion soup mix.

This was just okay-I'm giving it 4 stars for the ease of preparation.  Maybe it's my cuts of meat, but there was just not that much flavor.  I did add more garlic, a couple of boullion cubes, some red pepper flakes and a little wine vinegar.  Will try again with a better cut of roast.

It may have been the cut of my roast, but I didn't think this recipe was that great.  Somewhere around the 6 hour mark, I set my temp up to high because my roast was no-where near tender and wasn't done.  We ended up eating left-overs for dinner but when the roast was done, I shredded it and stored it in a dish with some of the broth.  I saved the rest of the broth separatly.  My husband was not that impressed, as evidenced by the leftovers I still have (he loves leftovers, and eats a lot of protein due to his weight lifting).  Will not be making this recipe again.

i halved the recipe & we almost wish i hadn't!  it was great!  we dipped our sandwiches in the broth.  i didn't have any rosemary, so i just sprinkled some oregano in there & extra garlic too.  also, i used a teriyaki sauce instead of a regular soy sauce.

Fantastic! My family loved this recipe. My kids ate all of their dinner for a change. What a great, great meal and so very simple. I love being able to put it in the slow cooker in the morning and not have to do a thing but toast some rolls at dinner.

I can't really "rate" the recipe because I don't eat red meat (!), but I made this for my boyfriend's lunch one day (we work together). For some reason, I didn't have any rosemary so I used oregano, and the soy sauce I used was either shoyu or tamari. I don't have a slow cooker so I cooked it over low heat on the stovetop and let it refrigerate overnight so the fat could be removed from the top of the liquid (there's quite a bit). The next day, the aroma as I reheated it brought several comments from other co-workers about how wonderful it smelled (one called me a sadist!) I sautéed some onions and melted mozzarella cheese over the meat; the sandwich was made using a hoagie-style roll toasted with garlic butter. My boyfriend really, really liked it and it was very easy (so I had time to make myself something else for lunch)!
