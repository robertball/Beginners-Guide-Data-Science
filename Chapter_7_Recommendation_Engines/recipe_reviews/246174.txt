This is pretty good.  When I make it again, I will use chicken broth in place of the water.  The only real alteration I made was in the amount of chicken used.  I only used 1/2 pound and that was plenty of meat.  A full pound of meat would've been too much in my opinion.  Also, I would leave out the egg yolk.  I don't see how that adds anything to it.  It does need either a flavor packet added or some salt.  I have also made it using beef stew meat, instead of the chicken.  I substituted mushrooms for the peas and carrots and it was great.

I really liked this a lot. The only change I made is that I used fresh carrots instead of frozen. The one suggestion I have is to replace the 4 cups of water with chicken broth. If you you choose to use only water then I recommend adding one of the flavor packets from the ramen. It needs an extra boost of salt/flavor.

Tasty soup. I used chicken broth, to enhance the flavor,instead of water. I had never tried Kimchi before and it's delicious, it adds so much flavor to the soup.
