My family loved this.  I love the rich flavor the tomato soup adds.  Here's what I did the second time to make it perfect:
-Used London Broil, not flank steak.
-Add 1 tbl worcestershire
-Add 1 tbl red wine vinegar
-Mix all 3 soups together first.
-Added some carrots and potatoes - To keep them from changing the flavor of the sauce and soaking most of it up, I place the veggies in some aluminum foil, fold the sides up to make a little boat and sit on top of the meat - I read this trick in a cooking magazine.

I had a cut of london broil in my freezer, and I have been eyeing this recipe for some time. Grilling the meat was out of the question since it is February and the dead of winter here. And that is the only way I have ever made london broil. I was attracted to this recipe because of the different ingredients used.  So I figured I'd give this a try. 
I used low sodium tomato soup and low fat cream of mushroom soup, 2 splashes of Worcester sauce, 1 splash of wine as reviewers suggested. Also added only 1/3 of the onion soup mix and sliced baby portabellas, a chopped onion and carrots. 
The appearance, texture and aroma was not appetizing. My husband came in after it had been on for 7 hours and said "gee usually when I come home and your cooking it smells so GOOD what happened"? Yikes!
I made mashed potatos as so many others suggested to serve this with and reluctantly we dug in. It was EXCELLENT. Wow. We were both so impressed and decided to add this to our regular rotation. The meat comes out very much like pot roast with a steak flavor, and the gravy, no matter what you think about it as it's cooking, it comes out so flavorful and tasty you will be tempted to just dunk some bread in it. 
Great recipe, and I recommend listen to others here and reducing the sodium content, adding veggies, it still is excellent.

First of all I need to thank you for the easiest, tastiest crockpot dish ever.  I actually planned to make it exactly as written but realized I opened a can of cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom soup by accident.  I then just mixed the soups and dry onion soup mix together and poured it over the london broil, turned the meat a few times to coat it, turned the crockpot on low and ran out the door for work.  I planned to be home in 8 hours or so, but got stuck at the office and didn't get home for 11 hours.  I thought I was going to have a mess and no dinner.  Instead I was greated to the most melt in your mouth london broil ever.  The gravy was fabulous!  Next time I will double the gravy so I can have leftover!

FANTASTICALLY EASY!  Seriously this is the ONLY recipe that truly takes 5 minutes of prep time.  I mean, how long does it take to open up a couple cans of soup and a soup packet?  Anyway, I've made this several times using a top sirloin roast and it always comes out tender and falling apart.  I cook it on low for 10 hours and I flip the roast over once during cooking.  This helps get that dry soup mix into the gravy, others suggest mixing it into the soup first.  After making it the first time exactly as the recipe states, I double the canned soup-but not the dry-so there will be extra gravy.  I made this for my sister and brother in law and they couldn't believe it was a top sirloin roast (which tends to be a little tough).  They loved it.  It not only tastes delicious but it is the quickest dinner you will ever make!  Love it!

I used a frozen top round roast and followed all the directions exactly.  It just fell apart when I took it out...it was delicious.  I will definitely try using other cream soups, as many have recommended, since I know now that the meat comes out just like we like it.  I am so glad that I finally tried this recipe and did not listen to the few bad reviews that it received. Let's get it straight, London Broil is a Cooking Method - NOT a cut of beef!! It is usually either Top Round Steak (or Top Round Roast) or Flank Steak.

This was by far one of the best recipes I have ever gotten off this site.  I put some ground black pepper on the meat, laid some quartered potatoes on top of it, and then poured the soups over it.. About an hour before it was finished, I added about a half a bag of broccoli/cauliflower/carrot combo veggies.  I can't even express how delicious this was.  I definitely don't get the few poor reviews this one has gotten, unless it has something to do with the cut of meat.  Thanks for a recipe I'll surely use many many times over!

I am fairly new at cooking considering I have only been consistently cooking meals for the past two years. I am still considered a "newlywed" and have a 1-year-old. It's often times hard to find a quick easy recipe that doesn't break the bank with a million ingredients. My husband is getting very tired of having chicken so much, so I have recently started buying more "inexpensive" cuts of red meat. The first time I tried this, I did not have tomato soup (about the only time that's never been in the cupboard!), so I used tomato paste instead and used NY strip steak that I wanted to get rid of. It came out okay, but it wasn't what I hoped. I made it again with the tomato soup and regular flank steak as the recipe calls for, and WOW! I think the best part is the gravy the two soups make to go over mashed potatoes! Wonderful! The meat is good, too, of course. We had relatives come over that night who commented on how great the room smelled, too. Luckily they had eaten, or I would have felt bad for eating such a yummy dinner in front of them! My only complaint is how the recipe says to sprinkle the soup mix on top. I think it should be mixed in, as others have said. I might try adding some Worsch. sauce and some chopped onions to give it a little kick. It's a tad on the salty side, but the potatoes really even it out. What makes it so salty is the onion soup mix, so I only use 1/3 the package. A fantastic recipe that is always on my grocery list, now! Thanks!

All I can say is YUM YUM!
I added fresh mushrooms, worcestershire sauce, black pepper, fresh garlic and chives. And I seasoned the meat with steak seasoning before putting it in the slow cooker. I cooked it for ten hours, and it was melt-in-the-mouth tender. No need for knives.
I served it with potatoes and green beans, and hubby loved it.

Very good.  I put in my flank steak partially frozen and cooked it on low 8 hours; also used low sodium mushroom and tomato soup.  Will make again!

Omigosh! With all those good reviews, I thought how could this go wrong, but there must be a BIG difference between "London Broil" and "flank steak" cuts of meat. This recipe using London Broil was dry, tough and stringy - even though I followed the directions to a "T". My friend's mom, a veteran cook, said this type of receipe would be best using a flank steak, which has some fat in it. She said a London Broil should only be ... marinated and broiled. Beware!

This is a nice basic recipe and a wonderful starting place to add other ingredients.  I used a Chuck roast and poked garlic slivers into the roast-all over.  Then rubbed all over with a good general roast seasoning.  From there mixed the following and poured into the pot with the roast:

Used a whole mini bottle of red wine(Ernest & Julio Gallo Twin Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, 187 ml.).
1 packet of onion soup mix.
1 can of condensed cream of mushroom soup
Just over ½ can of condensed tomato soup
2 or 3 splashes of cider vinegar
Chopped: garlic, fresh rosemary and fresh thyme
3 splashes of Worcestershire
About 1 tablespoon of Creole mustard (or any other whole grain mustard).
About ¾ onion, chopped. Sprinkled on roast and around the pot over sauce. 

Intended to cook in crock pot for 3 ½ to 4 hours but it went about 5 hours. The meat and gravy were delicious.  When finished, store the meat and gravy in separate containers. INTEND TO USE THE LEFTOVER MEAT TO SHRED FOR TACOS. The meat shreds easily and is very moist. My husband loved it.

This recipe was wonderful.  I used a london broil cut of meat, didn't have tomato soup so subbed one 8 oz can of tomato sauce.  I followed as it was besides the sauce and did season it with garlic adn onion powder, salt and pepper.  This seriously was so simple yet very, very delicious.  We used the gravy over mashed sweet potatoes and the meat itself.  Cooked on low setting for 4-5 hours and it was perfect.  Thanks so much for a very comforting and tasty meal.

Made this with afore-mentioned adjustments (1/2 c red wine, about 3T worcestire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, lots of pepper, and some Texas grill steak seasoning). It made a ton and it was delicious! I also put in 12 oz of sliced mushrooms and some extra onions at the same time as everything else. Let it sit overnight in the fridge and cooked on low for 11 hours. Meat was not only falling apart tender but also very juicy. Served with skin-on garlic mashed potatoes and veggies. Definately a keeper, especially with London Broil on sale for $1.99/lb at Safeway! Thanks for the post!

Okay, I cooked this for the first time today, and my husband is running late this evening, so I keep sneaking bites of it because I can't wait to eat it!  I'm going to eat without him soon!  It tastes   SO good.  I, too, was skeptical about the mushroom-soup-and-tomato-soup combo, but it turned out so tasty.  I doubled the mushroom soup but only used one can of tomato (that's how skeptical I was) -- and I used "tomato bisque," at that; it looked like the only difference was that this soup had chunks of tomatoes in it. Like some others here, I also mixed the onion soup mix into the soups instead of sprinkling it on top of the soup-covered meat. Additionally, I added a few tsps. of minced garlic,  about four shakes of Worchester sauce, and some fresh sliced mushrooms that I needed to use up.  We have a big 4 qt. slow cooker, and I set it on low for 8 hrs.  About an hour before it shut off (switched to "warm"), I added baby carrots.  I'm now cooking some zita and have baked a loaf of Italian bread in anticipation!  I'll let you know what he thinks!

Awesome, tasty & easy to do. My only "deviation" from the recipe was cooking time. Different slo cooker/crock pot or something else I'm not sure. I  can't see cooking 2 pounds of ANY meat - even the toughest cut - for 8-10 hrs. I gave it 5 hours first time out, but have cut back more each time cooking it since.I suggest watching the meat closely first try, so you know what it will do. Especially if you plan to be working or out all day....  Absolutely an EXCELLENT RECIPE! The most awesomely tender London broil ever; as well as being the tastiest by far in a long time. Very, very easy-to-do; being just about a "1 pot" meal..... Thank you MERRI C & AllRecipes.

UGH.  This was disgusting.  I can't figure out the high rating for this at all.  The house smelled great and we were excited to try it.  We're not picky eaters at all and experiment with different recipes frequently, but this horrible.  It was tasteless beef soaked with tomato soup; that's it.  We're on our way out the door right now to pick up some take-out.  Yeah...I'd rather eat take-out than this.

My husband gave this  5 stars, and raved about this recipe. I give it a 4. 
I also took the suggestion of adding a little Worcestershire sauce. Great suggestion! After this was all done I removed the meat, and chopped it into bite size pieces. I added some sour cream and half and half to the crock pot mixture, with the crock pot on high to thicken it up. I added the meat, covered it with the sauce, and served it over egg noodles as shown in the pic.

I usually just mix a family size can of cream of mushroom soup with a small can of campbell's french onion soup together and pour over my roast/ london broil in the crock pot.I saw this recipe and decided to try it for a little something different. It was good . The meat was moist , tender , and falling apart. The gravy was good on mashed potatoes but I think I will return to the canned french onion soup with the cream of mushroom soup. It has a richer flavor than this sauce. It's still good.

The tomato soup added a taste that was unusual, but surprisingly good.  The only changes I made were adding a good amount of black pepper to season the meat, and instead of using dry onion soup mix, I peeled a red onion and layered the slices on top of the beef.  Some other reviewers said the meat came out tough.  Not sure why unless it did not cook long enough.  My london broil came out fork tender after about 7.5 hours.

I make this recipe every season, but I use beef stew meat and add potatoes, carrots and corn to the pot.  Or substitute browned ground beef.  Makes an awesome and easy thick beef stew.  Serve with buttermilk biscuits. Can cook stew in oven for about an hour and a half at 300.

PHENOMENAL!!!!! When I first mixed the tomato, mushroom and onion soups together, it smelled kind of...strange. But when I came home last night, the house was filled with this incredible aroma!! It was one of those dishes that is so good, that you can't help but to keep eating it even when you are sickeningly full. SO YUMMY!

This is one of the best recipes I've made for my family. Even my teen has asked for this to be made more often and my toddler loves it, too. I double the soup, add some Worchestershire sauce and halve the onion soup mix. I also mix the onion soup mix in with the other soups instead of putting it on top. The meat comes out so tender and is delicious over rice. It's definitely a family favorite now.

Easy and tasty recipe. Placed the frozen london broil in the slow cooker and cooked for 10 hrs on low. Very tender but just slightly dry. Decreased the amount of onion soup to half the pkg. Added some chopped garlic, steak sauce, white wine and the worcesteshire sauce. I did mix these together prior to pouring it over the broil as previously suggested.
Would make again. Thanks for a different way to prepare london broil.

Excellent! Tastes great and couldn't be easier. I used a rump roast which I browned first, I think it adds flavor, then doubled the canned soups for extra gravy (not the dry soup) and also added worchteshire,white wine and garlic powder. Last 3 hours of cooking added baby carrots. Served with spaetzle. My family loved it.

I fixed this recipe with a frozen 3 lb. chuck roast.  In 8 hours it was finished and very tender and gravy was great.

This is great with a splash of worchestershire on the meat while slow cooking and then adding sour cream to the sauce before serving.  Serve over large egg noodles and yummmmmm.  We are food critics and both husband and I loved this recipe. The meat was very tender.  Delicious and easy!

This is a GREAT meal. I was initially skeptical because I don't like mushroom or tomato soups but the reviews were too hard to pass up.  I did as others and used two cans of mushroom soup,one can of tomato bisque and mixed it together with the dry onion soup mix, a few shots of worcestershire and some pepper. I served mashed potatoes but I think it would be better with egg noodles or rice. This will be a regular.

Wow!  Did this come great!  I had a 1 1/4 pound london broil which was perfect 'cause there was extra 'gravy'.  Before putting it in the crockpot I rubbed it with a mixture of ground black pepper, paprika and flour.  I didn't have to cut it - fit perfectly in pot.  Didn't have cream of mushroom, so I used cream of celery, but I doubt that made much of a difference.  Added small jar of mushrooms too.  Everyone raved!  Wish I had leftovers...  Thanks Merri!

I have to add to the ratings of people who loved this recipe...reading some of the negative reviews left me a little worried that I may not like the way this turned out. But it was flavor overload with just a few ingredients

I started by seasoning a 2lb London broil with salt, pepper, and garlic powder along with some flour. I seared it on all sides til golden brown. I mixed together the soup mixes along with the Worcestershire + red wine vinegar, and added everything into the crockpot for 5 hours. Served with real mashed potatoes and garlic roasted asparagus it was such a great meal! Awesome new recipe I will be definitely making this again! I had no problem with my London broil coming out tough, in fact it fell apart at the touch of a fork...like butter!

This recipe is perfect just the way it is. It's by far the easiest and best (for the effort) crock pot London Broil recipe I've used. My family truly loved it and it took so little effort but tasted awesome! I will use this one over and over again!

THE BEST!!!  I used round steak, as that was what was in the freezer and it turned out soooo tender and tasty.  I mixed the soups in a seperate bowl with some worsteschire sauce (about 1/8 cup).  Instead of onion soup mix which we find salty, I cut up an onion and laid it on top of the meat before pouring the soup mixture over it.  This was truly a winter nite "COMFORT MEAL".  We will be making it again and again.  Thanks for posting this great recipe!!!

Stand up and take a bow on this recipe. I am a mother of 12 children, and some very picky eaters. Let me tell you this was the "Bomb" as the kids would say it. I had caught london broils on sale and bought 3 of them. I tripled the recipe and it was great. Cooking time the same. After they were done took the meat out and shredded as like Bar-b-que added the meat back in the sauce VERY VERY GOOD. I am not one that likes to grill and all the recipes I was finding for london broil was grill. So I was so very happy when I found this recipes and couldn't wait to try it. I can say this is a keeper and I will make this again. A++++++.

This recipe is the best! I make it all the time!
To make it even better that my family loves is:
Add small red potatoes, carrots, and onion to the bottom of crock pot before putting in the london broil. And be sure to use 2 cans of tomato soup and 2 cans of cream of mushroom instead of only the one. Makes more of that great gravy for the rest.

Have made this several times with only altering golden mushroom for the cream of mushroom(our taste preference) and I use the can of french onion soup opposed to the packet-
DELICIOUS! EASY! QUICK!
This past weekend I made for a party and had two crock pots going with two london broils in each.  I used 2 cans french onion soup, 2 cans golden mushroom soup, 1 cup beef broth and a few splashes of red wine per crock(I forgot to buy the tomato soup-OOPS).  This was my favorite variation so far and I thickened the sauce in the end by adding a tbsp of cornstarch to some beef broth(I had reserved some on the side-cannot use hot liquid to dilute cornstarch) Barely any leftovers.
Will make again and again. OH and how can I forget..I usually pop in a clove or two of garlic as well.  Not many recipes that I do not add garlic into.

My meat turned out very tender but was very stringy and hard to cut(it more like shredded-even against the grain). Good gravy. My husband said he really liked it, but has not touched the leftovers. Flank steak is best on the grill but I thought I would try something different.
Over all it was simple and good.

I used 4 london broil steaks (about 2.5 lbs)and trimmed them well before layering them at the bottom of the crock.  I quartered 4 unpeeled russet potatoes to top the meat.  Added a can of musrooms, 1/2 cup of red wine and used cream of celery because that's what I had.  Mixed the 3 soups together before pouring on top. I cooked for 8 hours on low.  The meat turned out perfect, the potatoes were still a little hard.  Plenty of great gravy and the flavor was very good. I'm sure I will choose low-sodium soups in the future, not so much for the taste difference, but let's face it:  that's a lot of salt! If easy, comfort food is your goal, and you can spare 5-10 minutes in the morning (or the night before), this is a great recipe.  There is plenty of gravy to add veggies too, if you like.  I will make this again.  Thanks.

This was really good.  For a 2 lb flanksteak I wanted to make more gravy so I used 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom soup and instead of the Tomato soup which I did not have I used 2 can fulls of spaghetti sauce.  I only used 1 envelope of the onion soup mix with a little Worcestershire sauce and red wine and the sauce was delicious.  I was able to cut back on the salt content by using the spaghetti sauce and only 1 packet of onion soup mix. I also mixed the soups together and poured over the steak.  The gravy was awesome over mashed potatoes.

YUMMY gravy! I added a can of mushrooms, and liked it. Don't cook it for as long as the recipe says, mine was done in half the time. Think I might add some red wine next time to jazz it up. All in all, a really good basic recipe that has a lot of potential.

I really took liberties with this recipe based on what I had on hand, and it came out great (for the most part). My husband brought home two different London broil top round steaks, both came out different, one being tougher than the other even though they were cooked exactly the same. So those of you saying your steak was tough...it wasn't the recipe, it's the steak. Since we had 4 lbs of steak I needed to double the recipe. For one reason or another, either not having a specific item or having decided through a review to make a change, I ended up using: 1 can tomato soup, 1/2 can tomato paste, 1 can cream of celery soup, 1 can beef gravy, 1 small can mushroom pieces (including liquid), 1/4 c. onion flakes, 3 T Worcestershire, 1/4 c. red wine vinegar. Mixed together and let steak marinate overnight. Tossed into crock pot and cooked on low for almost 9 hours. One steak, the thicker of the two, fell apart like pot roast. The other steak was tougher, but still tasty. Served with Practically Perfect Basmati Rice, and there was plenty of sauce to top the rice with. Thanks Merri C. for a tasty and very forgiving recipe.

Yum-yum-yum. Next time, would mix the soup mix with a bit of water or wine to disperse the salt.

Just awful...I've never had anything turn out badly in my crockpot...until now. I ended up with a briquette. Great idea in theory but london broils I guess are meant for the grill and broiler.

This is such a good way to cook London Broil!! It came out just like pot roast.  I cooked mine in the oven on the lowest setting in a reynolds cooking bag just until meat was tender.  
 Second time came out dryer (cooked too long?), sliced it all up added it to the sauce with peppers and onions and served it like pepper steak over rice, it worked out well.

Made a slight mistake, but it turned out awesome as a result! My London Broil was frozen solid when I threw it into the crock pot. I poured the cream of mushroom soup over it, and kept checking it and flipping it. I had it on high for 2 hours before I looked again at the recipe and realized it should have been on low the whole time and I had forgotten the tomato soup! I mixed the tomato soup in, covering the London Broil and mixing it in with the mushroom soup, put crock pot on low, and let it cook for another 3 hours.

Then I sliced up the meat a bit, to let the flavor soak in, and cooked for an additional hour. The meat was like butter! My son, who rarely comments on my cooking, not only asked me what type of meat it was, but polished off all but 2 slices, which he left for me.

This will definitely be a recipe I repeat, and often, mistakes included! Thanks!

This was SO good. I added about 6 potatoes, cubed; 3 carrots, sliced into rounds; about a lb of mushrooms, cut in half; and an onion cut into chunks. I put them all in the bottom of the crock pot and placed the meat on top. I mixed the two cans of soup together and added a packet of au jus mix to the soups (I didn't have onion soup mix). You could probably just a cube or two of beef bullion. I seasoned the meat with a creole seasoning rub and lots of salt before I browned it. I also deglazed the pan with a little red wine and poured it on the meat in the crock just before i poured the soups over it. The gravy these 2 soups makes is just SO good! And with just a touch of heat with the creole seasoning...mmm, mmm. My daughter's favorite meal is pot roast and she LOVED it. I'll make my crock pot pot roast this way from now on. You really can't beat it!!

This was unbelievable delicious, and so simple! Makes a lot, leftovers make great sandwichs.

I actually got caught up at work and this ended up cooking for about 11 hours, which actually turned out for the best! I'm at high altitude (Denver, CO) so that might have been why it worked out.

Based on a recommendation from another review I bought a bag of frozen broccoli, carrots and cauliflower and threw them in for about 30 minutes. I also made of box of Garlic Mashed Potatoes. It all went together really well. 

This made a good amount for the GF and myself so we ended up putting this on sandwich bread for lunch a few days later.

This was a fantastic meal, and as the description states it's easy to make. We used a london broil cut instead of flank steak since it was on sale, and subbed cream of potato in for mushroom since we're not big mushroom fans. I also added a can of beef consomme. We let it cook for 9 hours, and shredded with a fork and let cook for another 30 minutes. I served alongside green beans with tarragon, and mashed cauliflower. I'd be sure to serve with bread to mop up the sauce on the plate.

This recipe is great as is!  Next time I would add other seasoning as recommended by other reviews.  Also, the only reason I gave this 4 stars is because 8 - 10 hours is WAY too long!  I cooked this for 7 hours on low and it is still very dry... next time I would likely do it for 5 or 6 hours.  Definitely keep an eye on it!

Love this recipe. The only thing that confused me was did you use london broil, or flank steak? I used london broil and I didn't change a thing. It is a keeper for me. I used it about 4 times already. I didn't use flank steak because it is kind of costly, it works well with the london broil.

I didn't change anything.  I used 2 lbs London broil and cooked for 10 hours.  I made with a side of mashed potatoes with the gravy from the slow cooker.  It was so good and tender. My whole family loved it.  My husband was asking me to make it 2 days later.

OMG this recipe is awesome.  I used London Broil and i used only about a 1/3 of the onion soup mix(because of reviews saying it was salty. I never thought the combination of tomato soup and mushroom soup would make such an excellent/tasty gravy. I also took the reviews and added a little worchester sauce and i put the veggies in a little boat and sat on top of the steak to cook(thank you for all the comments and tips) I also made some homemade italian bread for dunking. YUMMMMMY, will definately be making this again. Thank you for sharing the recipe. One last thing only cooked for about 6 hours on low so make sure you check so that you don't overcook and dry the meat out.

I am an experienced cook but a slow cooker newbie.  After reading many of the reviews I decided to use this recipe to break in my slow cooker.  I know the recipe says flank steak, and according to at least one reviewer "London Broil" is a cooking method, not a cut of meat. Nevertheless, I purchased a 2 pound London Broil on sale and it fit nicely in the bottom of my oval 6 quart slow cooker. I used low sodium tomato soup and low sodium cream of mushroom, plus one can of water, and mixed it with the onion soup mix before adding it to the slow cooker. 8 1/2 hours later, it smelled terrific and the meat was so tender it was breaking apart!  My family loved it, and my 5 yo, who usually doesn't like to mix meat with gravy, kept asking for more of both, together!  Thanks - I will definitely make again!

Very tasty! But I slow cooked it in my oven.
I doubled the cans of soups, pan seared the flank first and thinly sliced them on the bias.  Put it in an oven-safe pan and cover with foil.  I slow baked mine at 225-240 degrees for 4 hours and it was great.  Just a tad too plain, so I'll probably add a can of sweet peas.

This recipe was so simple and yet tasted great.  I took the advice of other users as follows:  1. used 2 cans of reduced sodium soup and 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, but used the whole packet of onion soup mix.  2. added an onion cut into rings and a package of fresh cut mushrooms to the top of the meat 3. mixed the can soup and dry soup mix together before pouring over the meat.  I served it with mashed potatos and peas and my boyfriend loved it.  The leftovers were great shredded and put onto french bread for sandwiches the next day.  I'll definately be making this one again.

Wow, was this awesome. I used two cans of tomato soup, two cans of cream of mushroom soup as suggested. I also used a venison roast, and added some potatoes, carrots and onion to the bottom of the slow cooker. By the time it was done, the venison was SO tender and you couldn't taste any wild flavor at all. Delicious!

I followed this recipe to the T, and got very good results. All in all an extremely simple, tasty, & tender crockpot recipe. I'm deducting one star though because I think that the flank would really have benefitted from being flipped over at least once during cooking (the top side, got a bit dried out). Also, next time I will follow the advice from other reviews and add some chopped up onion and probably a couple of dashes of worchestershire. Over all though, even as-is, this is a solid recipe.

I made as directed - no tweaking at all.  I put baby bellas, carrots and celery in foil and steamed on top of the meat as it cooked.  Served it over noodles.  I have to agree with the detractors on this one.  I think a different cut of meat would be better and the sauce combination didn't really do it for us.  It is salty yes, and a little 'off' - sorry I don't have a better word for it.   The three stars are for ease - can't get much simpler than this - but we won't be repeating this one.

Excellent! Even my incredibly picky 10 year old likes it. I used London broil because it was what I had, and followed the recipe exactly except for adding half a sliced onion because I needed to use it up. I was very surprised by how the flavors developed with cooking, because it looked terrible at first, but ended up a real comfort food, home cooking meal.

Very easy, change it a little, I didn't have tomato soup so I use a small can of tomato sauce. I also season the steak before putting in the crockpot...it smell so good that I added potato, carrots, and green beans after 4 hours of cooking plus some broth (beef) made  like a hearty stew...

I used the London Broil for this since I didn't want it to go bad..it came out delicious..I added red wine as some suggested & it tasted soooo good! Great comments from my family & they're going back for seconds!

Unexpectedly good flavor for unusual combination of ingredients!  I used london broil, added a tablespoon each of Worcestershire and red wine vinegar (per pp's) and added some chopped potatoes and baby carrots.  Leftovers were just as good!

i sooo wanted to like it after reading the raving reviews and because i was hoping to add another easy crockpot recipe to my repertoire, but i agree w/ the other negative reviews: 1) wrong cut of meat. it was tender but dry. perhaps a well-marbelized chuck would be better.  lean cuts like london broil are better cooked fast on high heat, like on the grill.  2) gravy was waaay too salty.  i do like the individual soups used, but the combination was terrible.  sorry.

I made this last night and will certainly make again. I only had a 1.25lb London Broil so used 1 can of tomato soup and 1 can of chicken soup. I added chopped onion, celery, carrotts and green bell pepper on the bottom of the slow cooker and put the meat on the top. For the sauce I mixed the two soups together and then added a couple of tablespoons of red wine, a dash of worcestershire sauce and some minced garlic plus a little water. The result was wonderful and smelt amazing when I got home. Served over tagliatelle pasta and it was wonderful. Thanks for a great receipe.

We loved this recipe in our home!  I followed the suggestion of doubling the canned soups, adding 2 tbl worcestershire and 2 tbl red wine vinegar plus a little minced garlic.  -Mix all 3 soups together first.  I used a top round london broil and we didn't even need a knife to cut the meat.  I cooked on low for 8 hours and it was perfect!  I topped with sauteed onions and mushrooms and served it with mashed potatoes and corn pudding.  Delicious COMFORT FOOD!!!!

I only gave this 4 stars because I changed it up a bit. I used a 2.3 lb pot roast, and I didn't have condensed tomato soup so I used spaghetti sauce instead. Based on other reviews I doubled the sauce, using one can cream of mushroom and one cream of celery and 2 cans spaghetti sauce. I also mixed 1 packet of dry onion soup in with the sauce first before spooning over roast. Let it cook on LOW for 9 hours. It was delicious!! My boyfriend says it's the best thing I've made so far.

I don't know how anyone could mess this recipe up. I have been making this for YEARS and by braising on the top of the stove no less. Makes GREAT sandwiches afterwards. I don't use the tomato soup, my family has LOVED this for years.

Lordy.  Easy, different and delish.  I mixed everything together, used low-sodium, FF soups.  Seared the meat before I put it in, and added the Worchester dash that others recommended.  Added to the "working wife" rotation without hesitation.

Sometimes a recipe that looks this easy needs so much tweaking that it is almost a completely different recipe in the end. Not this one! Super fast and simple, and tastes delicious. My 18 yr old son has even made it himself to surprise me when I get home from work! It is tasty as written, though I have used different cuts of meat (my fave has been London broil), and tried using both onion soup mix and beefy onion soup mix - depending on what I have on hand. Always comes out equally delicious. I agree about doubling canned soups to get extra gravy. I have found the best combo for me is one can of the creamy soup (I don't like mushroom so use cream of celery) and 2 cans tomato, and one package of dry mix. I have also added thawed frozen veggie combos as some have suggested, and have done it without them and made mashed potatoes as a side (the gravy is awesome on them!). This is truly one of the better recipes I have tried in my slow cooker.

Easy and delicious-- picked it out when our local safeway had a sale on london broil. I forgot the tomato soup, though, so I actually just squirted in some ketchup instead...worked out very well, and the leftovers have been great for sandwiches and the like!  I think I'll try it again with a few more additives (I saw someone added mushrooms in-- mmm, fantastic idea), but a perfect easy slow-cooker recipe to start with.

The second time I made this, I didn't have the onion soup mix, so I just threw in some dried minced onion.  It was even better than the first time, less salty!!!  I added cooked egg noodles to the crock pot half an hour before serving.  This is a fantastic weeknight meal with almost no effort!

This is a great roast/london cut recipe. I did add some garlic and a can of Golden Mushroom soup to increase the gravy amount and some fresh mushrooms and I will be making this again. I served with fresh sour cream mashed potatoes and fresh green beans. My husband who hates anything canned soup loved this recipe. I was a little unsure about the sauce until the last bit of cooking time. When the meat becomes extremely tender that is when the real flavors came through. For those not used to cooking roast if the meat is tough it has to cook longer. All beef will become super tender when cooked to death. I read a lot of bad reviews that are because of inexpierenced cooks not bad recipes. If you are looking for a super easy slow cooker recipe that is awsome comfort food this is for you.

I am very sorry to say that I was disapointed.  I really looked foward to this and I am hoping that it is my error that made the meat sooooo dry.  First I have to say that the gravy was WONDERFUl.  I doubled the soup that it called for.  I cooked a 2 1/2 lb rump roast in the crock on low for 10 hours AFTER I seared it.  I am really starting to think that "warm" is the temp on my crock that I should use.  I tend to do that with ground beef in the crock.  I will try it again.  All is not lost though.  We are going to have the rest of the meat as cheese steaks with the remaining gravy.

This was so good, and so easy! I did make a couple changes. I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I made the cream substitute soup recipe from about.com. I didn't have enough time to cook for 8-10 hrs, so I first cooked the London Broil in a skillet on all sides for a couple minutes, then cooked on high in the crockpot for about 5 hours. I also added the onion soup mix into the soup mixture before putting it on the meat. This recipe is one of the best I have ever made!  Thanks!! :)

I have never had a London Broil that was so tender,my husband and teenage grandson really loved it. I made this recipe exactly as the original and it was absolutely great. Gravy was served over mashed potatoes as well as the meat and there was plenty left over to mix in with our dogs dry food (we like to share good stuff with our little girl).

This was a great easy recipe (I made one change, because no one in my house likes mushrooms so I substituted Cream of Mushroom with Cream of Chicken).  We served with mashed potatoes.

I put this in the crock pot this morning at 9:30, and by 3 pm, it's moist and tender, and wonderful.  I did cut the London Broil into strips, and season it with black pepper and a little cajun seasoning.  I then added the soups and the dry onion mix.  I also added a touch of A1 sauce and two teaspoons of minced garlic.  I mixed everything together well and let it sit.  We won't be eating for a few hours yet, so I turned it down to warm.  It smells amazing and tastes even better.  What an amazingly easy, flavorful dinner!!  Thanks!

This was great.  I used cream of celery instead of mushroom.  I also doubled the soup, 2 cans of each, but not the onion mix (still only used one packet).  I also used top round london broil.  My husband loved it.  He thought it was the best gravy yet and can't wait to have it again.

This is awesome!  I added some salt and pepper and rubbed on meat first.  Came out perfect and falling apart.  I served with mashed potatoes.  Makes prefect gravy.  I will serve this the next time I have guests for dinner it was that good.

We loved this recipe! I also doubled the soup, added worstechire?? sauce, garlic powder, and only used half of the dry onion soup mix. It was so delicious! The meat was very tender and I will definitely make this again, thanks!!

Great sauce! After reading other reviews, I added 1/2 cup of worcestershire sauce to the soup mixture at the beginning and 2 tbsp. of fat free sour cream just before serving.

Cooked at low for nine hours and meat was tender.  I look forward to fixing this again and using the sauce for other cuts of meat.

This recipe was awesome!  Had some frozen london broil in the freezer, thawed it, put everything in, and it was great!!  We did add some worchesteshire sauce to kick it up a bit and fresh garlic, as we put garlic in everything!

Very simple to make, added Worcestershire Sauce.  But my meat lover husband said "Waste of good flank steak"  Should have made it with stew meat.  No more Flank steak in the crock pot for me.  Thanks anyway.

This was quite good. I made some adjustments that others had suggested, adding worchester sauce, red wine vinegar, pepper, garlic salt and onion powder. I didn't start it until 11am so I put it on 4 (medium high) and it was delicious by 7pm. When we got home at 3pm, we stepped out of the car and said 'Wow, I wonder who's cooking the yummy food'. We walked in the house and it was us!! Gotta love it! For veggies carrots and peas are good to ad about an hour before eating.

This was GREAT!!  I added 1/2 c red wine, sliced onions on the bottom and a small can of mushrooms was mixed in the sauce.  Used a real London Broil..meat was tender and juicy.  Cooked on low for 10 hours!!! Served over rice.  Thanks for sharing!!

Finally a great way to cook London Broil.  This recipe is so easy to make, and it turned out wonderfully.  When I tried to take it out of the slow cooker, I was shocked at how tender the meat was!!  My past attempts at London Broil have yielded meat so tough that it was a chore to eat.  This is fabulous even when reheated.  The gravy made is fantastic, though I think I'll cut down on the tomato soup next time...just to cut the sugar a little - personal preference!  I will be making this again soon - so easy and inexpensive.  Thanks for the recipe!!

i used around 2 lbs. london broil and all the the ingriedents as written.  The end result was juicy with a great gravy.  although i was skeptical because of the tomato the gravy was wonderful.  As for the reviews saying use half a packet of onion soup, i used a full packet and the meat was less salty than the chive and sour cream boxed potatos i made....  try it as written first then adjust.  i love it as it, and it was SO easy!  good recipes for week days.

I try at least 2 new recipes a week and they are rated by the family (though judges). The scale is as follows: #1: Fix once a month, #2: Fix twice a year, #3: Never again. This recipe was rated 1/2; Fix it every week. Everyone loved it.

Very simple, very flavorful recipe.  Easy to prepare...I used a 1 1/2 lb. cut of London Broil and sliced it before putting it into the crock pot.  I layered the slices and then poured all of the soups over the meat (I mixed the 3 soups in a bowl first).  The dish goes together so quickly and the end result was tasty, tender beef.  I served it over buttered rice.  The gravy is really good and I think I will try serving over egg noodles next time.

This was very good and easy to make.  I did use 4 lbs. flank and added 1 Tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce as recommended by others.  I wish I had made it without the Worcestershire Sauce so I would have tasted the original recipe.  I'm very glad I doubled the meat as there was enough sauce/gravy for it.

I have used another version of this that is just great too.  Put your meat in the cooker, add a can of cream of mushroom soup and a package of dry onion soup mix.  I usually add carrots, celery, onions towards the end of cooking.  This has always been a favorite of my whole family.  However this sounds wonderful too as it gives some variations of other additions. I will try the tomato soup next time. But this is always great no matter how you make it.

Made exactly how stated in the recipe increasing the soup to 2 cans each tasted bland. Added an onion, garlic, worstishire sauce, gravy master carrots and celery. This still was bland and the meat was so dry. Wouldn't make this again.

Absolutely delicious and could not be simpler. I whipped everything up in about five minutes before I walked out the door for work and came home to a delicious smelling apartment. I just cooked up some mashed potatoes, made a salad and dug in.

Family loved it. Like some of the others I did add some Worcestershire sauce to the soups and stirred it together and poured over the beef and put in crock pot. It was very tender and everyone wanted to know when I was making it again. A definite keeper.

Made this for a potluck and served with pasta.  Everyone loved it.  I doubled the recipe and the meat fell apart after about 6 hrs.  I used a broth based soup instead of cream and it was perfect.  Just needed to skim off some of the fat at the end.

Excellent! I thought I had tomato soup, but did not so I subbed a can of diced tomatoes. Still turned out scrumptious - and so easy!!! Just needed a little salt and dinner was fab! Will definitely make again :)

This Was AMAZING!! My First time making London broil & had doubts about making it in the slow cooker, But I am glad I found this recipe!! Will definitely be making this more often! Flavors were very good & the meat was so soft it fell apart! I cooked it on low for 7hrs & it was very tender. Even my kids ages 5, 7 & 12 loved it!! Thanks again!!

Really tasty and easy recipe. Mine came out a little dry so next time I will cook it for a shorter period of time. Did NOT smell good at all while cooking but the taste made up do that. The gravy was a little thin for my taste so I thickened it while finishing up the mashed potatoes. Even my personal food critic (my husband) said he would enjoy having it again.

Wow! I used a London Broil and had no problem after ten hours in the slow cooker of it being tough or dry. I never have cream of's in my cupboard. So I made "Cream Soup Base" from this site then mixed it with a can of tomato soup and the onion soup mix. Poured all over the meat, turned the crock pot on, left for work and ten hours later had an amazing dinner! Served with mashed potatos. The gravy this makes is excellent.

Used "London Broil".  The meat turned out tender, even shredded with 2 forks.  I should have added 1/4 cup or more of water from the beginning as the gravy was a bit overbearing.  Alex didn't care for this very much.  Jack was OK about it.  Jenny and I liked it.

This recipe has the potential to be amazing, I just found it to be too salty.  I used low sodium tomato soup and low fat cream of mushroom, otherwise followed the recipe.  I would follow others advice and cut back the onion soup mix to half.  I had a 2.25lbs piece of meat and had a great deal of gravy left over.

I have to say, this has to be one of the most "addictive" sauces I've made yet. It won't let you go, so I happily give 5 stars for this easy delight. I woke around 4am and started the crockpot, finishing around 2pm. I used a flank steak which didn't quite "fall off the bone" but went beautifully with the sauce. I had whipped new potatoes (drizzled with sauce, of course) and asparagus. mmmm so good!!

I made this using London Broil .... while this was very tasty , and I would make it again due to the rave reviews from my husband and kids,  I would call my end result "stew"  ...  Using London Broil 8-10 hours is way too long ...I cooked it for 7 hours and the meat literally broke apart as soon as you touched it.  With carrots and potatoes this made a very savory stew. We liked it!

Absolutely delicious! Extremely easy to make. I revised it a bit and added a can of cream of celery soup like some have suggested, a few drops of worcestershire sauce, about 2 ounces of mushrooms and about a 1/4 cup of red wine. I seasoned the meat with sea salt, cracked black pepper and some garlic powder on both sides. It's flavorful, and not salty at all. My meat fell apart, and was very tender. I cooked it on low for 8 hours.   Thank you so much for such an easy recipe that even the most novice cook can make.

This was decent, but will probably not make again.  Used London Broil & cooked potatos & carrots in a tin foil packet on the top.  Flavor was decent, but nothing spectacular.

Very good, I used low sodium tomato soup and added some garlic and Black Pepper with Worchester flavor to the meat first.  I also mixed all the soups together then put on the meat.  This also goes very well with rice instead of mashed potatoes.  Will make this again.

WOW!!! I have never had success cooking a london broil before, they always came out tough.  But this was fabulous....It was falling apart and so juicy!!! Best EVER!!! My cut of meat was a bit larger than 2 lbs so I added a can of cream of celery because it was what I had on hand.....it was soooo good!!! I cooked some red potatoes and carrots in a seperate pot on the stove and added them to the crock pot for the last 30 minutes and they were heavenly, too!!! Definitely a keeper!!!!

It was good, children (9 and 5) liked it too. My husband really liked it, he and I usually differ on meals we like. I marinated it for 24 hours and slow cooked it for 8 hours on low. I substitued Tomato Sauce for the can of concentrated tomato soup.

Used 2 cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of tomato soup, 8 oz. can of tomato sauce,  Used wine and onions too.  Added mushrooms, and then sour cream right before serving.  Sauce was really great, but the London Broil was very tough with little flavour, and my husband refused to eat it.  Won't make this again.

I tried this with a lot of reluctance. I've never had much luck with slow cooking London broil. I had one that needed to be used. I used cream of chicken because I didn't have the mushroom. Added some garlic and worcestshire. Slow cooked on low for 8 hours, and then shredded the meat. It was so tender and juicy! In the past, I have found London broil to be dry when cooked beyond medium rare. This probed me wrong. Easy and delicious!

We loved this but made a few modifications.  Others said it did not make enough gravy so I added a can of beef gravy to the soups.  I also added a thinly sliced onion.  It was wonderful.  It was so easy I will definitely make it again...and again...and again!!

Usually before I have any company for dinner, I ALWAYS try the recipe FIRST -sticking to the cook what cha know tastes good philosophy.  Unexpectedly, my father was in town, whom I must mention, has become a total food snob in his older years.  With work, 2 children, and a London Broil in the fridge and having all of the required ingredients I took the risk and tried this recipe.  It was AWESOME!  My father still talks about how tender the London Broil was and my husband and children request it often.  The only variation from the original recipe was (as a reviewer suggested) I added the 1 T red wine vinegar and 1 T Worces. Sauce and to make the use of condensed soup not noticeable at all, 1 hour before serving I sliced a pack of fresh mushrooms right into the crockpot.  YUM!  I served with mashed potato and salad.  Thank-You for the Recipe!

I wish I could give this recipe 4.5 stars. It was definitely delicious, but I try to reserve 5 stars for absolutely amazing dishes. I cooked the London Broil exactly as described only adding a few splashes of Worchestershire. After 9 hours it literally fell apart. I made sandwhiches on low calorie hamburger buns with lettuce, tomato and a smear of low fat mayo. It really hit the spot!

This is a fabulous way to cook london broil to get it tender. The combo of soups makes a tasty gravy! I love pouring the gravy ans meat over mashed potatoes! Its like an ultimate comfort ford! I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe except to add a little water to make the gravy less thick but its not needed.

This recipe was totally awesome. I was very skeptical with the use of tomato soup, but I did it anyway. I did add some Worcestershire sauce and garlic to the mix. I used a regular boneless chuck roast, that is what the store had that day. I cooked it in the crock pot for 10 hours on low. The roast fell apart, the gravy was superb over mashed potatoes. Easy dinner. Next time I will add rolls so we can sop up more of the gravy.

A REAL Surprize! Just reading the recipe would have never caused me to make this, but reading several reviews encouraged me to try it. I'm never a fan of a review that changes 90% of the original recipe .... it's hardly a "review" anymore ..... it becomes a "I had a better idea". Most reviews added a little Worchestershire Sauce, which I did (1 TBSP) and thoroughly combined the 3 soups before pouring over a London Broil. It came out REALLY tender and REALLY tasty. Wife said it is MUCH better than ANY pot roast --- which bothered me, a little, cause I think I make a GREAT pot roast...oh well. Next time: I will add 8oz of fresh sliced mushrooms about 30 minutes before serving, and MAY experiment with subbing diced Italian tomatoes for the Tomato Soup .... but the RECIPE AS WRITTEN IS WONDERFUL!!! Try it AS WRITTEN FIRST !!!!
UPDATE: My wife asked me to fix this for dinner the other night and I had everything EXCEPT the tomato soup ---- so I substituted medium enchilada sauce for the tomato soup - kept everything else as originally written and it was even better!!!! Not as tomato-y as before ------ I think I will use this change from now on!!! TRY IT!!!

One of the easiest and best recipes for the busy family I have seen.  My husband and sons loved the meat and I served it with mashed potatoes and vegetables.  I did however add a little water in with the soups when I first put in in the pot and right before serving it I made a paste out of self rising flour and water and added it to make the gravy thicker to go over the potatoes.  It will be a mainstay at our house for sure.

I'm giving this 4 stars because it is an easy recipe and definetely has a good flavor.  I personally just thought that it was way too salty.  Maybe it was just the soup mix I used though.

Very Easy! The best I ever made!:-) My parents loved this dish.  Even my picky hubby enjoyed it.  My dad said it was seasoned just right. However it was a tad bit salty for my taste. I did make some changes. I used Knorr's dry vegetable soup instead of dry onion soup. I seasoned the meat (london broil instead of flank steak) with fresh cracked black pepper and ground coriander seed.  I also followed the suggestion to add a couple of splashes of worcestershire sauce, a splash of red wine and one clove of chopped garlic to the cream soup mixture.  I will make again with the reduced sodium soups.

This was AWESOME! I added some pre-minced garlic & some worcestshire sauce & only used less than half of the onion soup mix. My husband loved it & said it's a keeper. If he says it's a keeper, that's all I need to know. Thanks for a great recipe!

I doubled the soup so I  could have extra gravy.  I combined all the soups together and poured over the meat.  I was very good.  I added 1 tbsp Worchester sauce, red wine for taste.  Great with mashed potatoes, extra mushrooms and carrots.

I give this recipe 5 stars becuase of how easy it is to prepare. I didn't use the onion soup mix, instead I used fresh onion, potato, and carrot. I also used a family sized can of cream of mushroom. Per the suggestion of another rater I also added red wine. I wasn't sure about the recipe at first becuase of the odd smell when it first started to cook, but it turned out awesome.

This one was a bit strange.  Like others noted, it did not smell appealing while cooking, which is not a good sign.  Testing the sauce after it cooked a while didn't help matters--it wasn't good, too much tomato soup taste.  In the last hour I added a good dose of Madeira wine, which helped only slightly.  I was not optimistic when I put it on the table, but the strange thing is that the sauce did taste okay when combined with a bite of the beef, so that was a relief.  However, it just wasn't tasty enough to tempt me to make it again.

Delicious!  I changed a little bit - I had venison tenderloin and no beef, so I used that; boyfriend hates mushrooms, so I used cream of celery; added sliced onion just to see what would happen.  Absolutely incredible - thank you!

Great, easy recipe! I made just a few alterations:
I like to brown my meat before I set it in the crock pot, but only slightly. Then I peeled and halved four cloves of garlic and lay them directly on the heavily peppered cut - I'm a HUGE garlic fan, some may prefer less. 
Instead of dirtying an extra bowl, I simply layered on first the worchestershire and red wine vinegar as suggested by other reviewers, poured on the packet of onion soup, then the mushroom soup and tomato paste (instead of soup). No need to mix first; it will all come together in the end. I set it on low for six hours, and four hours in I added baby portabellas, which kept them from becoming incorporated mush. Absolutely awesome over boiled potatoes.

Yummy! I don't usually liked meat with a tomato-based flavor, so I was a little worried making this with tomato soup. But I followed the recipe exactly and this was delicious! A few times while cooking I looked at it and thought, "Ew." And a few times I smelled it and thought, "Ew," but trust me, in the end it is delicious! The meat was very tender, the gravy was wonderful, and the tomato flavor did not overpower the dish. I will be making this again. It's budget friendly, especially when London Broil is often buy one get one free at my grocery store!

I couldn't give this recipe 3 stars because I have a feeling I've done something wrong, but overall I would give this 5 stars for flavor and 1 star for being unable to chew it.  I used London Broil and followed the recipe exactly.  I have a 7 qt. slow cooker (not sure if that makes a difference though) and I cooked it on low for 10 hours.  The meet turned out tough and chewy.  I had a feeling this would happen, so I cut it in into strips (going against the grain) prior to putting the meat into the slow cooker.  I wish someone could give me a feedback on why the meat turned out so tough, but I don't think this site has that feature.

As a slow cookier newbie, this was perfect for me!  I added a cup of uncooked white rice and some frozen veggies for a complete meal!  Even my picky-eater husband RAVED about it!  I also used 2 cans each of the soups, as suggested by another reader.

I made this for dinner today for the first time, it was by far the easiest recipe and I like that it takes what is typically on hand to make.  I did use the entire can of both soups, I didn't have onion soup so I added onion flakes, worchestershire sauce, salt & pepper, 1/2 can of water.    It really has a great flavor when it was done I shredded it and added 3C of cooked rice.  Thanks for a great fast dinner.

Great recipe. I had to tinker with it a bit since I didn't have all the ingredients. I used one can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup, one can of cream mushroom soup, half of a 6 oz. can of tomato paste and one package of dry onion soup mix. It was delicious.

This was an easy, and tasty recipe. The only thing keeping this from being a five star rating, is that I found it to be a little salty. Next time I will do half of the onion soup mix. Other then that this was a good recipe.

I guess I'm just never satisfied with a slower cooker roast... I will say, the combination of soups is not pretty, but did taste good. It really smelled wonderful, and my London broil came out very tender, just wasn't wow. But then again I'm never wowed over slow cooker meat..

delecious taste but I did not like eating long strips of meat.  Next time I will use stew beef or cut the meat into smaller pieces first

Great base recipe that is good just as written, but better used with a different type of roast such as a rump.  The second time I made this sauce I added about a tsp each of garlic powder and oregano, a dash of worchestershire sauce, and a couple dashes of red wine vinegar.  Really kicked it up a notch.

This was great! So easy and yet so good! Everyone in the house from 4 to 34 loved it. Simple to make in the dutch oven -I also mixed the onion soup mix with the other 2 soups and could not have been happier!

SO EASY!  I added 3 tablespoons of worseshire sauce and a sliced onion an it was so delicious!  (I even forgot the dry soup mix and it was still great!)  The meat was so tender after 8 hours, I could cut it with a plastic spoon.  It is truly a 5 minute prep for a great home cooked meal.  I will make again and again!

I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because I thought it was too salty. We shredded the beef and served it over mashed potatoes. Tasted great.

As a new cook, this recipe was easy.  But, (yes, I am one of those annoying people) I did not have tomato soup so I pureed a can of diced tomatoes with italian herbs. I followed the instructions, turned the steak over once about half way through.  The meat fell apart as promised - so tender.  I served it over a bed of noodels. My super picky husband (excellent cook) and super picky kids LOVED it.  With 3 small children, I couldn't ask for simpler, less time consuming recipe with better results.

This recipe is very easy to make before going to work.  I served it over noodles and added a 4 oz can of mushrooms (drained) and 2 tablespoons of sour cream 30 minutes before serving.  Everyone loved it!

Very good and easy. Cooked for 8 hours on low and was almost too done. The gravy was excellent and  it was more  of a brown gravy then a tomato based type. This surprised me. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes, carrots and soft yeast rolls. There was plenty of gravy  to use to soak up the gravy, which made  it good down to the last drop!

I made this dish last night.  I get tired of the same old London Broil.  It was really good.  I did add 2 cans of tomato soup instead of one and about a cup of water. The meat just fell apart like shredded corn beef. Yum.I aslo added a can of green beans at the end of cooking.  I served it over rice.  It was really yummy and will I will most certainly make again.  Thanks.

I took the soup packet and used it as a marinade for the london broil overnight.  Then added the soups the next morning to it and threw it all in the crock pot.  After about 6 hours on low, I shredded and served over egg noodles.  Really good, but probably could use 1 more can of soup.

I made this exact to the recipe except for the main suggestions here. I doubled the recipe and mixed the onion soup mix right in. I also add the sour cream right before serving. We had this with lightly buttered egg noodles and fresh green beans and my husband and all 3 kids requested that I add it to my regular set of recipes. I could not believe how sophisticated this tasted and yet it was soooo simple!!! The only thing I will change in the future is it was a little salty for my taste so I will get the lower sodium soups but it was FANTASTIC!!!

I made this tonight, I liked this, hubby thought it was just ok.  He felt the meat turned out well, but wasn't a fan of the sauce.  I follow the suggestion of using only half of the onion seasoning, and thickened the sauce a little with cornstarch as it was a little runny.  I added mushrooms. I served it over red skined mashed potatoes.  Very easy to make, wish I could make hubby like it more.

Too good be true?  Not this time!  Served over biscuits - more gravy there than you would think!

This was good and easy. I used a flank steak. Only changes I made were to add a little worcestshire. Then I added 1 chopped green bell pepper and a few cut up potatoes during the last hour of cooking.

I did add a little hot sauce and chili powder (not much at all)to the sauce.  The meat is so tender that I broke it up and we had shredded steak on rolls.  Delicious!

Just had to sample it before taking it to my daughter's for tonights dinner.  They will be impressed! Next time I'll use the recipe on a pork shoulder roast for sandwiches. Chili powder might be good in the sauce for a BBQ flavor,you think?
Thanks Merri

Delicious recipe!  Season meat before adding Golden Mushroom Soup and Tomato Soup...only used 1/2 package of Lipton Onion Soup and a sprinkle of Worceshire sauce. The meat was so tender it could be cut with a fork. There were no leftovers. My family loved it.

I found this recipe to be awful. It comes out way too salty and "oniony" tasting. Even my husband turned his nose up at this dish, and he's the most non-picky eater I have ever met.  Both of us normally love onions, but this went way overboard. Apart from the horrible flavor of the gravy, the meat did come out tender, but that happens anytime you let a cut of meat slow-cook for 10 hours.  That's about the only positive thing that I could say about this recipe, which is why I gave it 1 star instead of zero, which it truly deserved. Also, if you have a person in your home who suffers from high blood pressure, watch out!  This recipe is extremely high on sodium.

this is my all time favorite recipe. I thank the person who submitted this recipe everytime i make it. I've been making it for over three years now. I make it when i have company or just for the family. it is elegent enough for a dinner party and involves little work. the meat comes out so tender it's amazing. and i always make some kind of mashed potatoes to go along with it because the gravy is divine. I will make this recipe forever.

This was excellent, the whole family loved it. I used london broil and marinated it overnight in italian dressing. The meat just fell apart it was so tender. I agree with other reviewers, only use 1/2 package of onion soup.

This was wonderful.  It was so easy to make and it tasted wonderful.  It made a surprisingly good, thick gravy.  This will become a regular in our house.

A wonderful recipe that I did not modify, and will use again.  The modifications to the recipe posted by DFPSHRIMP should not have been posted as a review but a new and completely different recipe.

Perfect recipe for winter!  Works so well in the crockpot and the easiest ever to prepare.  I added lowfat sour cream at the end and used London Broil instead of flank steak to lower the calories.  Add a splash of Worcestershire Sauce also to give it a bit of "zip".

I added a dash of worstershire sauce in with the soup, and added about 1 cup of sourcream to the gravy right before serving (makes a stroganoff type sauce). SUPERB!!!!!  My whole family loved it.

My family loved this, even my skeptical husband (who believes london broil should only be marinated and grilled).  I will make this one again!  I just love Allrecipes.com, great place to find recipes and cooking hints!

This was so easy and sooo good.  I mixed the dry onion soup in with the other soups instead of sprinkling on top. Served with mashed potatoes and peas & carrots and a frosty orange pie for dessert, it was a real hit with my husband and grandson.

I did the recipe as suggested (Mostly) I doubled the soup and added the wine and Worcestershire, the flavor was great!

I must stress that there is a difference between slow cookers. Mine is relatively new at two years old, so the "low" setting is not the same as a cooker that is 5 or more years old.

I put in both flank steak and stew meat. 10 hours turned the flank steak in to a stringy hairball (still tasted good, just visually icky) but the stew meat turned out nicely.

So, if you have a newer cooker, make the necessary time adjustment, or use Stew/Top Round. 

I will definitely make this again

What a mess. My wife insisted we make this. Very salty and just a mess of a taste. This isn't a recipe, it's a piece of beef with a variety of prepared soup mixes. It's like saying let's throw a couple Strip steaks and a jar of mayonnaise and a bottle of BBQ sauce in a slow cooker. mmmmm

This recipe, in all its beautiful simplicity, is WONDERFUL!   Thank you so much for this!   There are times I try to avoid cream of this and packaged that, but this is so good!    I sometimes add some large red potatoes and carrots underneath the meat and soup.   I have also used the "beefy mushroom onion" soup mix instead of just onion.    Sometimes I also use stewed tomatoes instead of tomato soup.    Thanks so much for this!   Perfect exactly as written and a great recipe to tailor to your own tastes and what you have on hand, too!

I was hesitant to try this recipe (it looked way too simple to taste good) and I never had flank steak but I gave it a try!
This was sooooo gooood! Im not picky but my father grew up on savory pennsylvania dutch cooking and he LOVED IT!
I followed other reviewers advice and added vinegar and worcestershire, other than that no changes.
I will make this many times,  I think you can use lots of different meats for this (roast, beef stew cuts, london broil).

This had a very peculiar flavor, almost tinney and way too salty. The only thing accecptable was that it was very tender and falling apart.

I used a 2 lb "rump roast" as that's all I could find at the store.  Used 1 can each but used cream of chicken bc that's what I had.  Only used roughly 1/2 envelope of the onion soup mix bc I found out it was already opened.  It was actually a little bland and I had to add some salt to the dish after cooking then it was perfect.  So if I had used the entire envelope maybe that wouldn't have happened.  Overall we enjoyed it a lot and my picky teen said it was pretty good, which is a compliment from him.  Surprisingly the tomato soup turned out good and we had plenty of gravy.  I added some cornstarch after the meat cooked to thicken it a little.  My meat literally flaked apart and it cooked about 8 hours on low.  I did stir it a few times and flipped the meat over.  Served with red potatoes and a vegetable...will def make again.

Very good roast.  Followed the directions with one exception
mixed all soups together and poured it on roast. I had a two
pound flank steak and it took almost 11 hours in slow cooker
but it was delicious and tender.  A keeper!

I had a 1 1/2 pound flank steak in the freezer and decided that I wanted to try something different from my usual London Broil recipe from my BHG Cookbook that requires marinating the flank steak for hours and then broiling it and carving it.  I wanted something that was easy and would be ready when I was done with my work day so I decided to try this recipe.  I was a little nervous about it but I am so glad that I tried it.  It couldn't have been easier and it turned our very delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except my flank steak was only 1 1/2 pounds instead of 2.  I used one can of Campbell's Tomato Soup and one can of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup, I added a tablespoon of red wine vinegar and a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce and I seasoned my meat with a little salt and pepper.  I also only used 1/2 of the onion soup packet.  I served this with mashed potatoes and peas and put the gravy over the mashed potatoes.  It was delicious with the meat, mashed potatoes, gravy and peas mixed together.  I will make this again.  I would like to experiment with other cuts of beef because the flank steak was a tad bit tough and stringy.  I only cooked it for a total of 4 1/2 hours on low and then turned the heat down to warm because my crockpot cooks extremely hot.

Flavorful and easy.  I added some fresh mushrooms as well.  This gave me a chance to use some of the meat I had in the freezer in a way that could be fully cooked, but still tender and flavorful.  I am pregnant, so can't have any pink in my beef.  Typically, I'd prefer my steak or london broil to be medium, as would my husband.  But, we both really liked this cooking method.

I found this recipe a few years ago - have been making it regularly ever since!  So simple - I mix all 3 soups together and throw it all in the crock pot.  Great with baked potatoes - we use the leftover sauce as gravy.

This was really good, my husband was literally scraping up the sauce on his plate. It was so darned easy, felt like I needed to throw flour on my face to make it look like I worked hard!  I did add salt and fresh ground pepper to the meat before putting it in the pot.  We had this with mashed potatoes, and you could certainly add some veggies to the pot as well.  I will definitely make this again! I can hardly wait to see how the leftovers taste!

I have made this a few times.  My family loves it.  The meat is tender and tasty.  The only thing I add is some sliced onions and sliced mushrooms the last hour so they are just soft.  We like it best served with noodles ( but have also served with rice and mashed potatoes).  This is a keeper for my family!

I had everything for this meal except the mashed potatoes. BUT evidently brown rice was OK as the entire family loved this !! I did cut back on the dry onion soup mix to save sodium, but this gravy is such a hit -  A welcome addition to the meal plan as well as the budget - Easy and Good. Hard to top that combination.

Yum Yum and then some. Followed some of the reviews, added worcestershire and wine vinegar as well as celery and mushrooms. Outstanding. The gravy is absolutely delicious!

You can't get much easier with this recipe.  Instead of soup I sometimes use a can of drained diced tomotoes, the meat is so tender and the sauce is really tasty.

I used low sodium soups and it turned out great (my family doesn't like salty flavors).  Be sure to pour the soup ON the meat - I didn't have any trouble with the meat being too tough but can see where it might have over cooked if the meat was lying on the sauce.  Just a few other notes for the complainers in the group - different slow cookers cook at different temperatures, so if yours tends to cook pretty hot then don't cook it as long.  The cut of meat and the QUALITY of the meat also makes a difference.  I have tried buying meat from a mass merchant and don't think the meat tastes as good as my usual grocer.  Thank you for a quick, easy and DELICIOUS recipe for busy families!

I really wanted to like this, but it was not for me.  The twangy of the tomato soup is what threw me off.

I mix the soups in a bowl and pour over meat. It's EXCELLENT and EASY, a perfect combination. Hubby and I both LOVE this. Best served over egg noodles or with mashed potatoes.  YUMMY!!!!

When I saw this recipe, I thought it was too simple to possibly be as good as stated in some of the reviews.  Boy was I wrong -- it was wonderful!  I used 3 pound Top Round Roast and followed the recipe to the T.  The family loved it as well.  The gravy/au jus was delicious!

I made this with an actual london broil.  Followed directions exactly (except I didn't have the onion soup mix when I put it in the crock pot.  Ran to the store and added it when I got home) .  It was really good!  Mashed potatoes are great with this (as suggested).

Couldn't be any easier!  I'm sure all the additions that others have suggested are wonderful, but once you start all that the "easy" factor is eliminated.  It's yummy just the way it is. Keeping it simple keeps it's appeal.

This makes this cut of beef so tender, it is now one of my husband's favorite dishes.  Great comfort meal when served with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Would double mixture for more gravy for potatoes.

When I went to make this recipe my husband said he would deem me queen of the kitchen if I could make a london broil tender like a pot roast. We were both surprised at how tender and yummy this was. Amazing recipe for a not so great cut of meat. We loved it!!!! Delicious!

So easy!  Used London broil instead of flank steak and doubled the soup with a little worcestershire.  My 11 year old said it's the ultimate mashed potato gravy, and the meat just fell apart with a fork.

Growing up, I hated any kind of roast. As an adult I've grown to like them but have no idea how to cook them. London broil was on sale at my local supermarket so I googled London broil recipes for the crock pot and this was the first result. It looked simple enough so I gave it a shot (added sliced fresh carrots, celery, and threw in some canned whole potatoes during the last hour)- my husband and I both loved it! The combined soups gave the meal a great flavor and the meat was tender after slow cooking all day. I will definitely make this again and again!

Since I'm not a fan of mushrooms, I substituted cream of celery soup for the cream of mushroom soup and it was very tasty and tender. I'll use this recipe many times over.

I really like this recipe because it is very tastey and SO easy!  As someone suggested, I add a little worcestershire.  That and the tomato soup really bring a fantastic flavor to the meat.  I love how the meat becomes so tender yet not overcooked in the crock pot.  I usually cook it for about 10 hours.  I shared this recipe with a friend, and she passed it along as well!

This is a good receipe, the only thing that is wrong is you need to add water to this, at least 1-1 1/2 cups. Much too salty from the onion soup mix. was very good after adding the water

Basically just Pot Roast.  I prepared this exactly as directed expecting a ton of flavor from the tomato soup and dry onion soup mix.  However it was a bit bland considering.  Not a big fan of this recipe.

This is great and good dish to leave in crock pot while at work.  Only down side for my experience was the my son forgot to turn it off when he came home... so it cooked for 12 hrs... a little burnt after taste.  However everyone still loved it.

I've made this recipe for several years & it always turns out great.  Whether for a weeknight dinner, Sunday supper or when having company over, this is comfort food at its best.   The 'gravy' is awesome over mashed potatoes, rice or egg noodles.  Even my friend who hates to cook digs this recipe because she knows it'll be so tasty.

This recipe provides a great base for your london broil. But how like many of the other reviews suggested, I added some veggies and decided to throw in some hot sauce. It came out delicious!! The broil just fell apart. I served it with some bread and it was perfect. Simple ingredients but great flavor!

Super easy, I followed the instructions almost exactly, but doubled the soup to make more gravy (didn't double onion soup). Served with mashed potatoes as suggested. Meat wasn't as tender as I liked, but probably was because we were short on time and I cooked on high for 2 hours and low for 2 hours, I think I would try this again at the beginning of the day, as suggested, 10 hours. We LOVED THIS GRAVY. Leftover meat, gravy and potatoes are going to be shepherds pie on Friday. VERY easy, good recipe.

I had some flank steak in the freezer that needed to be used but no time for prep.  Gave this recipe a whirl and was not disappointed.  My DH liked it.  I would make it again.

My family really liked this one, especially my husband.  The only thing I sorta changed is I put both soups and the seasonong packet in the crockpot 1st and mixed then added the meat on top and spooned the mixture over it. The combination is different, but they go so well together. The london broil just fell apart, it was not dry at all. This is a keeper and have already passed this on to several co-workers.

Loved the gravy, but tried this recipe with a top round london broil.  Not as tender as I would've liked.  I will try it again using a boneless chuck roast.

I seasoned the meat and added one more can of cream of mushroom soup as I had 2 1/2lbs of flank steak. Cooked it for 9 hours and it was delicious. The meat was tender. We will be having this again. Would never have put the two soups together but it is tasty. The tomato soup brings a little zest to it.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  He found the sauce very reminiscent of his hometown Louisiana gravy and loved it over rice.  It was so quick and easy to prepare.  Like other reviewers, I used nonfat cream of mushroom, low sodium tomato, and added worcestershire and red wine vinegar.  I was short on time and cooked it on high 2 hours and turned it down to low for about 3 and it still came out fall apart tender!  Will be making this again and again.

Meat was super tender and had really good flavor.  Only gave 4 stars because even after using low sodium soups, was still a tad salty for our taste.

I thought this was okay.  The meat was tender, but didn't have a lot of flavor.  I am going to try it again and season the meat first with garlic powder, salt and pepper.  It might be better after that.  I also wasn't sure about the tomato soup, it wasn't bad though.

This was just average to me. For years I have done roasts in the crockpot using cream of mushroom soup and dry onion soup mix so I was hoping the tomato soup would give this a bit more of a twist.

Didnt care for the sauce. Next time I will use BBQ. It also burnt to the bottom of the slow cooker after 5 hours. Add some water to prevent burning.

This is an easy meal to prepare, but I really just didn't like it. I found the sauce to be waaaayyy too salty. It didn't have much flavor other than salt. Mine also came out hopelessly burned, but that could have been my fault. I followed the recipe as written; maybe I would try this again with some changes (i.e. low sodium soups?). Thanks for sharing anyway.

We really liked this recipe.  I used london broil and seasoned it with garlic, salt and pepper.  I didn’t use the onion soup mix (many felt it was too salty).  I used low sodium cream of mushroom and tomato condensed soups. I added chopped onion and baby carrots to the soup mix and poured over beef.  Cooked for 7 hours LOW and it fell apart. Served over egg noodles.  So easy and would make again.

I made this last night with a top round London Broil (that I had defrosted by mistake, and it was far too big to grill for 2 people).  My husband and I both loved it.  It was very tender with a great flavor.  I added potatoes, carrots, celery and onions to the pot before I put the meat in.  We now have delicious, easy to use leftovers.  I will definitely make this again!

Can't get any easier!  I had to use golden mushroom soup b/c of a dairy allergy in the family.  Still turned out great! Diluted with just a little water. Served over brown rice.

This was no spectacular at all.  I did as many suggest with the Worcestershire and red wine vinegar, but I was not at all impressed.  I added two white onions, sliced and cooked on low for 8 hours.  I shredded the meat then put it on rolls for sandwiches.  It made for an o-k sandwich, but definitely not the greatest.

I made this the other night. We went other peoples suggestions and I made it with low sodium versions of both the tomato and mushroom soups. I left out the onion soup all together. Wasn't salty. Overall, the meat was tasty, kind of like a pot roast. After 10 hours on low the meat fell apart. Didn't care for the gravy at all. Or the smell of it. Not sure that I'll make it again. Although, it was a very low cost and easy recipe to make!

Used this recipe just as it is with NO CHANGES for a few years now. My family loves it, I use it with london broil or a regular roast. Spectacular anyway you use it. Try the recipe as listed 1 time before making any changes you wont be disappointed.

Not in love, but perfectly edible.  I had a little over 1.5 lbs. of London Broil (round), and cooked nearly 11 hours.  Certainly did NOT fall apart, but wasn't tough either. Don't understand needing more gravy as other reviewers were lamenting, as the meat was swimming in soup/ broth.  The aroma of canned tomato soup and mushroom soup, mixed, is a bit tinny and I had concerns from the beginning.  Took advice and added thinly sliced onion.  I knew it needed more, and added Worchestchire sauce, a TBS vinegar (presumably for tenderness), fresh rosemary, fresh thyme, and fresh sage. Added a few odds/ ends dry stuff like Monterey seasoning and garlic powder, but still wouldn't say I would ever need to have this again... I'd suggest that if you really want a 3 minute recipe next time, drive thru.  If you have more time, dutch oven method is superior.

We were celebrating a MSU Spartan win recently and had this cooking all day.  Brother in law is a meat and potatoes guy so I made certain we had redskin mashed potatoes to go with this dish.  Like others, added worcester red wine and two cloves of garlic crushed.  The gravy made for a perfect topping for the mashed potatoes.  Slow cooking is such a simple way to make this dish.  The best.  Already shared this with several friends.   On the list forever.

My hubby loved this one.  I cheated a little though, whenever I use my slow cooker I want a complete meal.  I added a couple of peeled and quartered white potato's, a small white onion and then added the rest of ingredients. It smelled wonderful while it cooked.  About 20 min. before cooking was complete, I added a small dish of leftover mixed vegies to the pot.  Served with garlic bread.  This was delicious and is another keeper.

LOVED it!!  I used a london broil as the name of the recipe suggests rather than a flank steak in the ingredients list.  I cooked it on low for 8 or 9 hours and it was fabulous!  I have never had such a tender london broil.  It literally fell apart it was so tender!!  I added some Worcestershire sauce as one reviewer suggested, and I also sprinkled some onion powder and garlic powder over the top.  This is a keeper!!

The reason I choose this recipe was from the ratings it had received. Looking back, ANY recipe that has two processed cans of soup should be immediately deleted from any cooking site. This recipe, which I made verbatim, was way too salty, flavorless and unimaginative. Even if you had added vegetables, this is a negative adventure in cooking.

This is a strange recipe, but we really enjoy it and I have added it to my dinner rotation.  It's so EASY.  It does taste great, and I serve it with mashed potatoes.  (Sometimes I skip the onion soup.)  The only thing that makes it a 4 instead of a 5 is it's appearance.  It's not very appealing looking so I would not serve it to guests.  I do, however, give out the recipe for friends to try at home.

A bit of a let down. All the great reviews had me expecting something better. A problem was that it charred against the sides of my crockpot (on low). The sauce was too thick and the taste was too concentrated. I added about a cup of water to thin it out & it was more edible. I won't make this for myself again, however my 4 and 7 year olds, who often don't like meat, really liked this.

My family loved this! Great flavor and another option for London broil. The addition of the tomato soup made such a hearty gravy. This will be a repeat in our house.

It turned out like all of my slow-cooked meats turn out - stringy and with no discernable sense of what the meat originally was.

I was not sure with the mix of ingredients how this would come out. I used a london broil that I already had in the freezer and I used two can each of the soups but only one pkg of the onion mix. I also added fresh mushrroms and onions. This came out great. I would make it again. Like others have said I served it with mashed potatoes and everyone loved it. Since I made the extra gravy the following night I added more mushrooms and a bit of sour cream and cooked beef strips. Mixed all together and served over noodles. What a treat and so easy!

This is not the most visually appealing dish although I managed to cut the meat in thin slices and spoon over some of the sauce onto the meat and it improved the appearance. I do prefer this on either crusty bread as shown in my photo or a soft but toasted onion roll. This made for a hearty lunch sandwich. The meat was juicy and tender and perfect for a sandwich. Another good teenage meal for a group of hungry kids.

I have made this twice and I must say it is wonderful! The whole family likes it. The first time I made it with a London Broil the second time I made it with a Flank steak abd both times it turned out excellent! the only suggestion I have is to double the can soup so there is more gravy. Thanks for a awesome easy recipe!!

Super easy! I had a smaller cut of meat (just two of us) so there is lots of leftover gravy to use in another meal. We are not mushroom lovers so I substituted with cream of celery and it was still good. Added some red wine, Worcestershire, onion and parsnips to the crock pot and cooked it all together on low for about 9 hours.

This came out great.  I added a little woceseter sauce and red wine, but kept everything else the same.  Made mashed potatoes and mixed veggies and some rolls. Used the sauce as is for gravy.  Was afraid of using the whole pouch of soup would be too salty but i just made sure not to add salt to potatoes or anything and it all worked out great!  I am happy to say that a family of five ate every last drop and that does not happen very often with my family since there is always someone who does not like something lol

I made this for Sunday dinner and it was the best!!  I used a London Broil.  I made the recipe the same but I did change a few things.  I didn't use the onion soup mix, too salty, instead I sliced two onions and layed those on top of the meat with some sliced mushrooms.  Added 1 tbl. worchestershire and 1 tbl. of balsalmic vinegar.  The meat fell apart and the gravy was great on mashed potatoes.  I will be making this often! !

This is one of my standbys when London broil pops up on sale. The last time I used dry onion mushroom soup instead of just plain onion soup, and it really added a nice touch. I also used the lower-sodium tomato and mushroom soups, and sprinkled a touch of garlic powder on top of the meat before adding the soup mixture. The leftovers are even better a day or two later when the sauce has really seeped into the beef.

This was wonderful.  I always grill my flak steak, but this is a great change for a winter meal.  My husband absolutely loved it and the gravy was perfect for the mashed potatoes.  I also added Montreal steak seasoning to the meat.  This does not sound like a great combination, but it is.  Must try!

Was fantastic. Meat fell apart. The gravey was great too. The only down fall I had was some of the meat stuck to the bottom of the cooker but that was it. It could have been my fault though cause I have no real idea what im doing. I did add some hot peppers and it gave it a nice zing.

We really tried to love this recipe.  I followed the directions with the recommendation to add some red wine vinegar and some worchestshire sauce - while the sauce was great the meat was dry - very dry.

Just wasn't wild about the flavor of this recipe - maybe it was the tomato soup with them mushroom soup.  The meat was very tender, however, lacked a delicious flavor.  Maybe it was the meat.  I did not add the whole package of onion soup for fear of getting it too salty so therein may lye the problem.  I'd be willing to give it another whirl as it a great way to cook London Broil.

This was good and certainly hardy.  I added frozen peas and mushrooms about halfway through to make it a whole meal along with Pennsylvania Dutch egg noodles.

I read a lot of the reviews prior to making this, so I tweaked this to suit our tastes.  I mixed the soups and onion soup mix together and added a chopped onion and some baby carrots.  The taste was delicious and my husband wished there was more leftovers!

I have made this recipe for years, but only with cream of mushroom soup. I will have to try the tomato soup too. 
I always mix the onion soup in first and add cut up red potatoes, fresh garlic, celery and carrots cut up.I throw the meat in frozen on top of the vegetables.
The entire house smells awesome, and my husband is a very happy man!

My family really liked this.  I made it exactly as written, except I used 1.5 lbs of London broil and half a packet of onion soup mix.  Incredibly easy and very tasty.  1.5 lbs of meat, 2 adults, 2 preschoolers and no leftovers.  'Nuff said.

I FOLLWED THE RECEIPE BUT ADDED POTATOES & CARROTS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SLOW COOKER COOKED ON HIGH FOR 6 HOURS ...... My husband loved it (but he eats anything) I thought it was a bit more like a stew and it had to much tomato flavor for me  I will probably make it again but add 1/2 can of tomato soup

I used two cans of mushroom and tomato soup instead of one, and the sauce turned out really tastey.  London Broil is NOT the meat I would use in this recipe.  After cooking on low for 8 hours, it came out very hard.

This was good.  Maybe the meat should be browned before putting it in the slow cooker.  I wish I would have added potatoes and carrots and just made a beef stew.

I dont understand the hype over this recipe. It's just NOT that good. I even spiced it up a little with some seasonings, worcestershire and onion. The london broil turned into roast beef... a very DRY roast beef. How can beef become so dry when it's sitting in 3 cans of soup? (Yes, I used an extra can.) It was also WAAAAY too salty. 2 stars for the easy factor - taste wise it was 1 star. I'll try any recipe once, but this will not be making it into my rotation. Thanks anyway, tho'!

yes it is quick and easy but I was disappointed as it tastes "out of a can".  I used flank - started on high for an hour then low for rest.  after 6 hours it was almost over done.

My family gives this a 5, and I give it a 3, so we'll split the difference and give it a 4. Followed recipe exactly and it was good. According to my daughter, it was amazing!

Not crazy about this one. Tasted a lot like pot roast or stew, so if you go in with that expectation you'll likely be pleased with the results.  What I personally learned from this is that with this cut I prefer to broil and slice thinly like I normally do and leave the slow cooker to cook other cuts of meat.

As another reviewer said, I'm going to start cooking my meats on WARM instead of low in my crock pot.  The smell was wonderful and my mouth was watering but when I sampled...ugh!  what a disappointment.  The meat was falling apart but still tough and dry.  Granted the sauce is very good, served with whipped potatoes and broiled veggies but will have to find something creative to use up all the leftovers.  It's a good thing my DBF is a human food disposal.  Might try again with a shorter cook time... or might find something different.  Depends if the london broils are on sale again....

I made this last night for dinner and it was wonderful AND easy.  However, I did stray from the original recipie and used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of low sodium tomato soup.  I also used one cup of the french fried onions in place of the onion soup mix.  Cut up about 1/2 an onion, added a small pouch of raw baby carrotts and red potatos sliced, a dash of garlic and worcestershire sauce, cooked about 8 hours.  Rice and peas on the side and it tasted just like Mom's Sunday dinner!!  If you don't like salty (though it was fine w/ me and I am not a salt person) I would use low sodium for one of the cream of mushroom soups or reduce the french fried onions - It was my first go at it so I was just testing the amounts.  The can soup amount worked nicely for extra gravy as others have mentioned.

My husband really liked this recipe alot. I added a little cornstarch to thicken the gravy about 30 min before I served it. Next time I may add some garlic & a splash of wine. Gravy excellent with mashed potatoes!

This was a delicious dish, but I tweaked it just a bit.  I followed the advice of others and doubled the soups, which did indeed make a fantastic gravy.  I thought the dish was a bit salty, I'm wondering if it was due to the soups or the onion soup mix.  I decided toward the end of cooking to throw in some frozen peas.  It gave the dish a little color, and it was a way to get in some veggies.  I served it over some leftover rice I had, and it was a hit! Fast and easy, especially on a weekday, that's my kind of cooking!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This meal was so easy to prepare and tasted so wonderful!  I took some of the advice from the previous posts and used 2 cans of tomato, and 2 cans of cream of mushroom for extra sauce and I served the dish over egg noodles.  This was real comfort food and a hearty meal! A+++

Wow, I can't believe how simple this was and how impressed my husband was! I usually ask him to rate each meal at the end to know if I should make it again and he also gave this 5 stars

I really liked this recipe but my bf, or I should say PITA, didn't care for it so much.  He says that the sauce was funky because it wasn't what he was used to.  I enjoyed it and thought it was even better the next day.  I added a tsp of minced garlic, a splash of red wine, and a splash of worseshire sauce.

WOW! Was I surprised!  Added a can of mushrooms because we love them and only 1/2 packet of dry soup mix (all I had) and le cook for about 10 hours. Doesn't sound like it would be good, but it is amazing!  Adding to my rotation--you can use the cheapest beef and it just falls apart! Thank you!!

Not a fan of the tomato & mushroom mixture.  I also would prefer chuck roast over london broil.  Won't be making again, but it was edible.

Really good recipe.  My crock pot cooked the steak to fork tender in about 7.5 hours on low.  I used low sodium soups just to cut the salt. Very good, would make again.

This was a wonderful, simple recipe. I added 1 T of minced garlic and 2 T of Worcestershire to spice it up a bit, (we're just garlic kind of people), and it was delicious. Thanks for a great idea for an inexpensive cut of meat!

This was a great recipe. I followed the advice of others and only put in half of the italian seasoning and added a little bit of worcesteshire sauce. It was really good. But next time I won't put in a whole can of tomato soup - the flavor was a bit too overpowering.

I wasn't that impressed. I guess my tastebuds just didn't care for this. It's probably because I prefer my slow cooker meat to be a little tangy and this reminded me more of beef stew. My husband raved about it though! He absolutely loved it

Thought the sauce tasted great but the meat was a bit dry. It cooked 7 hours in the crock pot. Maybe will try again.

This is a terrific recipe. I do agree that it is a bit salty and next time I would probably use 1/2 of the onion soup packet.
We served this over mashed potatoes, it was delicious.

I cooked this according to the recipe with a little worcestershire sauce and it was sooooo tender, but didn't have tremendous flavor.  We had to add lots of tabasco sauce (we like the chipolte flavor tabasco sauce) to give it some punch.  It was ok, but not something I think I'll make again.

This was fantastic.  The gravy was delicious.  I took the advice of others and added 1/2 cup of red wine and mixed together the soups, the dry soup mix and the wine before pouring it over the meat.  I added baby carrots with 1 hour left.  I let it cook for 10 hours.  Everyone loved it, there were no leftovers!

Very easy recipe.  I highly recommend letting your meat marinate in the soups overnight- particularly if you are using a london broil (my least favorite cut of meat).  I gave it 4 stars because the meat was unbelievably tender and tasty.

This was just TOO easy.  Family and extended family - adults and children - all thought it was great.  I've prepared it several times and have learned that it comes out much better in my older crock pot which I believe is because my newer one seems to cook hotter and the tends to overcook.  Thank you for sharing this recipe - it's a family favorite!

Made this recipe today using actual london broil meat.  I cut the steaks in half and put in a bowl marinade with worcestershire sauce overnight.  I used low fat cream of mushroom soup and instead of onion soup (onion soup does not go big in my household), I used parsley (just enough for my taste).  IT TURNED OUT GREAT!!!!!  We took out steak knives, but did not need to use them (cooked it for the total 10 hours).  This one is a keeper for sure!

Great flavor. ( I used no salt tomato soup and lowfat cream of mushroom the second time and found no difference in flavor or texture.)

What a tremendous disappointment...and i'm not terribly picky. But this had enough salt to killl someone. I love london broil but i'm sticking to having hubby put it on the Weber.

This was a fantastic change from the usual broiling method.  I was looking for something where I didn't have to heat up the whole kitchen when it's 90 degrees outside and this recipe was it!  The meat literally melted in your mouth and the gravy was yummy!  Thank you, Merri!  This one's a keeper.

I was surprised that this was really good. I was hesitant, and even thought it may not be good after putting it together, but we realy liked it. As some others suggested, I added 1/2 cup red wine (merlot) and used 1/2 the onion soup. I served with garlic mashed potatoes and the whole family liked this!! Will make again!

The "gravy" was indeed very good, but my London Broil came out on the stringy side. It was still appreciated by my partner for dinner. And I concur -- gravy was great over mashed potatoes.

This was moist but cooked as per the recipe, it was bland and salty!  A second try, this time adding only half of the onion soup, a little garlic, worcestershire sauce, and a little red wine improved it to a 4 star rating.  It is easy and I will continue to play with this but when it warms up, it is going back on the grill using a recipe found in the South Beach cookbook.  Awesome Slowcooker Pot Roast is favored more in our house...  Thank you for sharing your recipe, as it does help all of us!

This was strangely good.  I say strange as I was concerned about the tomato soup, but it worked out well.  I skipped the onion soup mix for a medium sliced onion, and added a 1/4 C. red wine, and a large splash of Worchestire.  For the first time ever my husband ate this cut of meat without compalaining.  Thank you Merri. Next time, I will add bell peppers also.

This was quick and easy.  I added a sliced red and yellow bell pepper.  The smell is great.  The gravy is excellent over mashed potatoes.  Mine was done in about 7 hours even cooking it on low.

This was a big hit!  We enjoyed it.  The meat fell apart and was very tender and flavorful.  I made one change; instead of onion soup mix, I finely chopped 1-1/2 small onions and added that.  I'll definitely make this again!

AMAZING!!
I will be making this for the rest of my life. This is going into "Regular Rotation" at our house.
I used 1/2 of the Onion Soup packet because so many people seemed to suggest that in the reviews. It turned out so delicious. The gravy was YUMMY on the mashed potatoes I made. 
My wife and me loved it and I can't wait to go to the fridge in a little while and eat the leftovers.
I love roast-type meat anyway...but this had such a new and unique flavor. Mmmm Mmmm Mmmmmmm

AWESOME!!!! Quick and Easy. I used 1/2 the onion soup envelope and placed new potatoes on top. 
NOTE!!!! I believe the bad reviews are based on a poor cut of london broil. Make sure the cut is nice and red with marbling,cut off fat and grizzle.

I loved this! For something so easy, it sure did taste good. I'm putting this one in permanent rotation. The meat was tender and mouthwatering,and the sauce had a robust, full, savory flavor. Excellent.

I used a London Broil, added in potatoes and carrots after looking at some reviews.  I'm not big on cream of mushroom, so I added a can of beef gravy as a replacement.  This was a good Sunday dinner and I would make it again.  It does have a very strong tomato taste to it, I think next time I may only add a half a can.

Just tried this today and I will DEFINITELY make this again!  I added half an onion, a green pepper and potatoes with the meat at the beginning.  I also used a top round london broil and the meat was fabulous!  We're not big fans of mushrooms so I used cream of potato. Also added a bag of frozen veggies 1 hour before finish...excellent!  My boyfriend loved it and I'm going to try it out on my daughter who is hard to please when it comes to meat.  Thank you to others for the suggestions!

I used a Top Round London Broil instead of Flank Steak and served it over noodles as someone else suggested.  It wasn't bad a little salty but I did put some Adobo seasoning on the meat first so maybe that did it. I love anything in a crock pot so I'll probably try it again with a flank steak as the recipe calls for and see if that bumps up my rating on this.  Either way I'll probably make it again because it's so easy.

I made this today and it was very good.  The only changes I made was I added about 1/4 of red wine.  I like what red wine does for beef.  I also added peeled potatoes and carrots.  Then I mixed all the soups together and poured over the whole thing.  It only took 5 hours on low but, then I had marinated it for 3 days in the refrigeraor. The gravy was real rich. I strained the gravy to get out the onion bits.
It was a little salty, but that was due to the fact I had marinated it in soy sauce and other ingredients.  The meat was fork tender.

This was so easy to prepare and the convenience of not having to worry about burning it was unexplanatory.  My family loves it.  This is the way, I always cook my roasts from now on!!

Awesome! I found this recipe a few days ago and made it yesterday.  I added some whole white potatoes and some carrots about 2 hours before it was done and it came out wonderful.  The gravy has a wonderful flavor.  Thanks for sharing Merri, I'm taking the recipe to my friends at work tomorrow.

This is a GREAT recipe for London Broil!
The best I ever tasted although when I 
used regular condensed soup it was a bit
salty however, I used a can of lower
sodium condensed soup and it was perfect
for my taste.  Speaking of taste, even
my 3 yr. old even eats it.  Thanks for 
such a great recipe!

This tasted like a beef stew I make in the crockpot, but without the vegetables. Even my husband, who can be a bit picky, liked it. My 2-year-old daughter wasn't awake when we had dinner, but I doubt she would've eaten it.

Very easy. I just mixed everything and put it over the meat. Good flavor, easy prep, tender meat. Made good leftovers too. I shredded the leftover meat and put it over noodles with the extra gravy.

I followed the recipe  took other reviewers advice and added Worcestershire and balsamic vinegar because that's what I had on hand. I added carrots and mushrooms, made mashed potatoes (for me) and egg noodles (for hubby). Next time I will double the soup to make more gravy because it was uniquely delicious. I don't eat much salt but my hubby does. The potatoes and noodles helped offset it for me. Oh and the meat was so tender!

I had to try this based on simplicity,  and the twist with tomato soup! 2 minor changes: Fresh onion layered on bottom  ( omit dry mix), I always marinade the meat before cooking in crock pot (simple mix of olive oil,  steak sauce,  lemon juice,  Worcester sauce). Follow as directed.  Cooking for dinner that night 
, cook on high for 5 to 6 hours. (I had a 1lb London broil). Served with mashed potatoes and fresh veggies.  Plenty of sauce to do with egg noodles or over rice.
Had the family begging for more! ENJOY!

Easy dump recipe with lots of flavor, but the stringy consistency of the flank steak from the slow cooker is maybe better pulled apart for sandwiches.

This was the bomb! I used 2 cans of tomato soup, 1 can cream of chicken,  1 can cream of mushroom, 1 packet onion soup mix. Put it on before I went to work got home to dinner done. Amazing! we both loved it. No left over meat but the sauce that was left over i made vegetable soup.... Very good as well!

This recipe was excellent and extremely easy and quick. I used London broil and was so surprised at how it fell apart and was so moist and tender. It actually had consistency of roast. I used a larger can of tomato basil soup and small can of cream of mushroom also I included a can of diced tomatoes. I marinated the London broil overnight with the onion soup mix and some Worcester sauce salt and pepper. I cut up a small onion carrots and last hour and a half I added a frozen bag of broccoli, cauliflower and carrots. I served over rice a roni beef flavor rice with vermicelli. Was absolutely delicious.

This was excellent. I used a Top Round Sirloin, and added Worcestershire sauce as recommended. Next time, will definitely go with 2 cans of the mushroom soup to make more gravy and add fresh mushrooms, but it was delicious as it is. The hubby loved it..... Will definitely make again.

Great recipe with delicious gravy.  Because of the cream of mushroom soup, the gravy is already thick. I used a little less than a pound of flank steak and cooked it in my crock pot for eight hours and it was perfect.

I always review recipes with the ingredients  AS WRITTEN.  This one was not one of my favorites.  I used the exact ingredients (loved the there were so few!!) and mixed them together, pouring over  the London Broil. The smell of the mixture upon first putting into the cooker wasn't particularly good.  But when I got home from work, with the cooker on for 8 hours, the smell was divine.  The flavor, however, was "off. " It was "interesting" to say the least; I could definitely taste the tomato soup.  I do love tomato soup, but don't want my beef gravy/broth to taste like it.  The meat was good and tender, and the gravy was a nice thick consistency, but I didn't like the flavor of the recipe.  So I  added 2 cups of beef broth (used bullion), which definitely  fixed the problem, taming down the tomato soup flavor!!  Yay - with this addition, it was  very good, and the family loved it.   It did, however, thin out the gravy a bit more than I would have liked.  So NEXT time, and there WILL be a next time, I will follow the recipe, except only use HALF the can of tomato soup so that it won't be so strong.

Good.  And I made lots of changes.  First, this is not London Broil, it's slow cooker flank steak.  That's OK, the base of this recipe is a good place to start for slow cooker meat recipes.  I doubled the soups because I saw another reviewer do it for more gravy.  Then I used two London broil steaks; weighing a little over  a pound each.  I added a box of fresh mushrooms (cut in half).  I added a large cut up onion.  Added a tablespoon of pepper, a splash of worchester and white wine.
It tasted good.  The family ate it and thought it was alright.  It's a little salty so definitely should be served with a starch.  We had it with rice but mashed potatoes would be even better.  I'm gonna keep this as one of my base plans for when I have a tough meat and don't want a lot of work.  Thanks for inspiring my recipe.

I used a London broil that was 1.8 lbs for the 3 of us and it was plenty.  This was an easy and tasty meal for sure.  I had it in the crock pot about 3,hours on low.  Definitely will make again

I made this for my picky husband and mother-in-law.  They loved it.
I did use london broil and added mushrooms, sweet onions, worcestershire sauce and drizzle it with red wine.
Will definitely make again - especially on a hot day!

I changed a few minor things.  First, I used London Broil, not flank steaks. I only used half a package of a Knorr's onion soup mix.  I sprinkled a little bit over the meat before pouring the sauce and added a little bit more on top of the sauce. I also cooked it on high for the first four hours then on low for another two hours. I found it was all I needed for a pound and a half of meat. Everyone enjoyed it at my dinner party. I will definitely make it again!

My family and friends have always raved about my pot roast but this recipe is becoming a favorite. I use a chuck roast or London Broil, put it on in the morning before I leave for work and by the time I come home it's finished. I serve it with a green vegetable and mashed potatoes. The soups make it's own flavorable gravy. This is a perfect dish for simplicity and cold Midwestern days.

I thought this would be so great... And the flavor actually turned out pretty good, but the meat (I used top round steak based on many glowing reviews) was stringy and dry. Not as tender as "low and slow" cooked meat often is. If I were to do this again, I'd try flank steak instead.

Yum! Yum! Yum! We have used so many different cuts of meat for this recipe and it always come out awesome. We love our pot roast drowning in gravy so sometimes we double up on the cans of soup and there is plenty of leftover sauce to dip a fresh loaf of Italian bread in!

Absolutely one of my favorite recipes now. My husband also raved about it.  I used London broil even though some are using flank steak. We took a reviewer's suggestion and added Worchestershire  sauce. I did not have red wine vinegar so I substituted cider vinegar. 

This is all-around amazing and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

Made the first time as the recipe is listed here, my ratings are based on that. Came out great really, super simple to make and very flavorful. I've made this a few times now, comes out fine whether you use flank steak or an actual London broil cut of meat. The only things I do different now is I add an sliced onion and a tablespoon of Worcestershire, comes out perfect for me.

Wonderful gravy, added some potatoes and carrots, but surely would use any other cut of meat rather than London broil. As was mentioned earlier there is a reason it is called a London BROIL!

Not bad at all. I cooked it according to the recipe but layered it top and bottom with green peppers (because I love green pepper) I also used Campbell's Cheese Soup to substitute the cream of mushroom. I DID use London Broil because it was more affordable and a more realistic amount of meat for just one person. Though I'm sure the flank steak works great too.

Well, I made same mistake a pp did.  I used London broil instead of flank steak as the  title implied.  Big mistake, very tough.  However the gravy was delicious...  I ended up taking out the beef and shredding/chopping it so as to "rescue" the dish.  Threw it on top of mashed potatoes.  Still very tough, but edible.
I would absolutely make this again, doubling the gravy ingredients  (yes, it was that good!)  and using a fattier pice of meat.
ETA: I mixed all the gravy ingredients together, I did not separate out the onion soup mix, still delicious.

I made this according to the recipe.  Thought it sounded very good.  Cooked it for approximately 6 hours in slow cooker.  Way too long.  It was very dry and stringy.  My husband didn't like it at all.

Good flavor but a little tough so I pulled it apart and chopped it and it made wonderful sandwiches.

An amazing simple and delicious recipe.  I added potatoes about an hour into the 8 hours and it was excellent.  Carrots would have been a good addition too.

Any time I make a new recipe I always follow the directions exactly. The dish was okay, a little under flavored for me. I think I will try some of the suggestions others have mentioned to enhance the flavor.  Good enough to experiment with.

I made it to recipe,  we thought it delicious, and just too easy to make.  I was a little concerned about the soup, wasn't sure if we were supposed to mix it as soup, or just the base in the can, so I went with just the base.  I also used the cheapest cut of beef I could find & it just melted in your mouth, no knife needed. 
We have sauce left over, I'll use it over pasta later.
A must do for any lazy cook.

I couldn't believe that there were so many rave reviews.  I made this last night against my negative feelings that it couldn't possibly be good, but willing to give it a try.  I was right!  One of the worst meals ever.  At 77 years old, I should trust my own instincts, and years of cooking.  Tomato soup and mushroom soup should never be combined.  Half the onion soup mix only should have been added; too salty.  A waste of a perfectly good piece of meat.  Sorry.

Made this today for our supper. I used a pot roast instead of a  London broil.  I ,also, used cream of chicken soup since I was out of mushroom.  I mixed the two soups together a then added the onion mix . After stirring in the mix I poured it over the roast and cooked on low for 8 hours. Served this with mashed potatoes and small lima beans. The grave from the roast was great on the potatoes.  Also had olive rosemary bread. Great dinner. Husband love how tender and delicious the meat was.

I made this recipe with a few changes. I used the condensed tomato soup but instead of cream of mushroom, I used 98% fat free cream of celery.  I added a few dashes of whostishire and instead of using onion soup mix, which is loaded with salt, I substituted fat free, sodium free beef bullion and dried onion. I mixed it all together and before pouring it over the meat, I pierced the meat several times with a fork being careful NOT to go all the way through meat. I also took the time to caramelize some onion and served it with those...boy did that just put it over the top! Being a year post bariatric surgery, I'm always looking for recipes I can alter to fit my diet and this one is definitely a keeper!

I used brisket, and substituted a "Beefy Onion" dry soup package.  Since I didn't have Cream of Mushroom I used Cream of Chicken soup.  After all that cooking time you'd never know the difference.  It was tender and tasty with plenty of delicious gravy. Thanks for sharing!

I wanted to point out to those people referring to London Broil as a cut of beef that London Broil is actually a cooking style and not a particular cut or muscle of beef.  If you see beef in the grocery store that says "London Broil", it is simply a marketing term used in an attempt to get you to over pay for a cheaper cut.  That being said, this recipe is very easy and reminds me of a dish my mother used to make that we all loved as kids....need I say more?

We made this for dinner last night.  Added the Worchester and wine.  It was good the meat was very tender and they ate it but not a favorite.  I thought the gravy was a bit heavy and not enough flavor.   Just not our cup of tea.

The piece of London Broil I had in the freezer was less than 2 lbs. After thawing the meat & trimming the fat, it it was in the cooker for about 8+ hours. I added sliced, fresh mushrooms during the last 45 minutes...and we ate it over mashed potatoes...yum. The meat fell apart..... This is an easy and delicious comfort-type food. Thanks for sharing!

This was good; it had a different flavor with the tomato soup, but we liked it.  I mixed the dry soup in with the rest and put it on the roast. It was really good on rolls too.

This was absolutely delicious ! I took the advice of some others here and but also added a package of sliced mushrooms, a small bag of baby carrots and instead of onion soup mix I used beefy onion soup mix. A splash of red wine and splash of beef broth (since I added a starch) and I wanted to make sure there was plenty of gray. Excellent meal! I served it with garlicky green beans and cauliflower mash (instead of potatoes) which are a nice alternative if you're carb-conscious. Thanks for this recipe. It'll be a regular in our house !

This recipe was so easy and so delicious.  I used London broil instead of the flank steak.  It turned out rich, tender and full of flavor.  The gravy is a full creamy amazing delight, which I served over rice.  Prep time was a 5 easy no mess minutes.   Really,  my 7 year old grand daughter can read and follow this recipe.  I will be making this again.

This was very good. I read a lot of the reviews before I took this one on (because it just seemed TOO easy) and I made two changes: I went low-sodium on the soups and I added a couple tablespoonfuls of Worcestershire sauce. Otherwise, everything was to spec. Nine hours in the crock pot and the meat came out moist and tender. The gravy was very tasty over some accompanying mashed taters and it was a big hit with the boyfriend. One word of caution, however: this is a very heavy dish and would be optimum for winter eating. We had it for dinner in late June and yeah, we couldn't get much of it down, as tasty as it is! Plenty of leftovers for lunch. 4.5 stars, will make this again. Thank you!

I made this as directed, and it was OK. We ate it, but I probably would not make again. We prefer "Three Packet Slow Cooker Roast" from this site.

If you want a slow cooker recipe because you really are willing to wait all day then this is the recipe for you. Don't make this if you think canned soup in a recipe is boring. Give it a try if you love comfort food and are on a low budget so you need to purchase cheaper cuts of meat. 8-10 hours on LOW, I repeat, 8-10 hrs on low will produce a roast that turns out easy to shred up. I purchased a cut of meat labeled 'london broil' but it was indeed a cheaper roast. Patience is a virtue here, do not open the lid to check on it. Trust your slow cooker to do its job. Serve over unseasoned rice, mashed potatoes or pasta and be done. The extra salt can be minimized by the suggestions of other reviewers. If you know you need a lower sodium meal use low sodium soups. I used a small can of tomato sauce instead of soup and added a splash of half and half, this turned out fabulous and did not have that purely tomato flavor, just tasted like gravy.

Made this for the first time last night. Followed the directions exactly. The meat was almost fork tender but a little on the dry side. Instead of slicing up the leftovers I tore it up into bite sized pieces and stored it in the sauce in the slow cooker crock. I heated it back up in the slow cooker for lunch and  if the meant isn't perfect now! Juicy and tender! I will make this again for sure but next time ill either add some water or beer to the soup or possibly dry brine the roast, or both.

This recipe was very easy.  I used left over london broil. The only problem I have is it is very salty. Does anyone know of a way to fix that. Other than that it is very flavorful.

This is a staple in our house. Everyone loves it including the kiddos. It's so easy and so delicious. I also slice up two onions into rings and put them on top of the London broil. They caramelize perfectly into the mixture. Thank you for submitting this recipe Merri C!

It tasted great for such few ingredients.  I served it up on bread which made a nice open faced sandwich.  I added a little shredded cheese to each sandwich.

This was delicious.  I followed the recipe but on the advice of one person added some red wine and carrots.  I cooked it on low about 9 hours and when it was finished the meat was very tender.  My 9 year old gobbled it up and asked me to make it again!  A hit in our house.

I gave this recipe 5 stars not only because of the taste, which is delicious, but because it is so easy to prepare.  I have 3 picky teenagers in my house and they all loved this recipe.  My college age daughter even asked for the recipe to make it herself, now that is a first for me, so it must be really good.  Oh, the only thing that I did differently was use a rump roast since that is what I usually have on hand.

Easy meal..turned out pretty good.  Recommend adding Worcestire sauce for more flavor.  The gravy is the best part of this meal...mashed potatoes a must side dish.

We didn't like the tomato soup mixed in.  I'll continue to use just the mushroom soup mixed with the dry onion soup, this is the way I usually make it.

Absolutely delicious and SO easy!  I used 1 lb of regular steak since it was dinner for just 2.  10 oz can each of the tomatoe condensed soup and cream of mushroom, 1 packet of dried onion soup mix and a couple dashes of worchestire sauce - cooked for @ 8 hours on low - PERFECT!!!! Can't wait to make it again.  Paired it w/ mashed potatoes, only thing I missed was a side of green peas or asparagus and would have been the icing on the cake!

I made this for dinner today and it was a huge hit with the whole family.  Changed a few things, I didn't have mushroom soup so I used cream of celery instead.  I added about 2 Tbsp. of steak sauce to the soups.  About 7 hours into cooking I stirred about a half a package of sliced baby bella mushrooms and a sliced small onion into the sauce (didn't have the dry onion soup) and left it to cook about another hour.  Served it over garlic and cream cheese mashed potatoes and alongside sauteed Brussels sprouts.  Even the kids asked for seconds.  This is definitely a keeper.

Followed recipe except I added chunks of celery. Put this in the crockpot at 9am and cooked it until 1:30. Meat came out on the dry side without much flavor. Was kind of worried that the tomato soup would make it taste funny with the mushroom soup but the gravy was actually pretty good. Next time I will try this with a better cut of beef.

Made this with some London Broil we've had in the freezer and didn't have the first clue what to do with.  This was the first (and only so far) thing I made with my new slow cooker.  The taste was fantastic, but I have to say I think I messed it up!  I added water in addition to the soups and I didn't trim the meat so it was a soggy mess.  Again, the taste was fantastic and literally falling apart.  Served over boiled potatoes.  I will definitely attempt again...but will make sure to trim the fat and not add a bunch of water.

The flavor was fine, but I don't think I'll use this recipe again.  I think I'll stick with marinating and grilling instead of slow-cooking.

I gave it 5 stars for the ease and simplicity.  Very tasty and great with mashed potatoes!  I was a little wary about the tomato soup (wary it might be a little too sweet and my roommate hates tomato soup, so I didn't tell her it was in there).  Well, my roommate had two LARGE servings!!  It will definitely stay in my recipe book for those days where ease is a must!

I am giving this 5 stars because it is one of my husbands favorites.  He loves the flavor (it reminds him of his mom's swiss steak).  I also add whole mushrooms and baby carrots while slow cooking, then I serve it over mashed potatoes.

I mixed all soups together and added a bit of water.  Although I liked the suggestion of putting the potatoes and carrots into foil so they wouldn't absorb the liquid, I put them into the liquid because I added some water into it.

The gravy was great.  The meat was dry so next time I will use a lean, boneless chuck roast because it has a little more fat.  I served it atop egg noodles with gravy to pass.  My family liked it.

I've cooked this several times for my family and always had them rave about how good it is! I do double the condensed soups like some other reviewers and add baby carrots and red potatoes.

As recommended, I added Worcheshire and red wine. It was quick and tasted OK, but nothing spectacular. It was like a lot of meat-with-soup recipes.

I made this recipe exactly how it's written. My boyfriend and I loved it. Super simple and yummy. The ingredients make it have a very different taste. I think I'll try this recipe with a pork roast next.

Wonderful recipe!  It fell apart with a spoon when I was trying to pull it out of the crock pot!  The only thing I did differently was add 2 teaspoons of minced garlic.

This came out great.  I used Londond Broil and it was a very large piece so I added some extra spaghetti sauce I had in the fridge.    The sauce was brown, not pink like I expected after mixing the two soups.  Reminded me of my mother-in-law's hungarian goulash.    The meat fell apart, as it always does in the slow cooker and we ate it over bow ties.  I would definitely make this again!

I was a little nervous about doing this recipe, but to my surprise it was quite tasty!  I used a London Broil not flank steak since I had that on hand.  I thought there was plenty of gravy with the 1 can of each soup.  I would definitely make this again.  Thank you!

This is an easy way to get dinner ready with almost no prep time at all. I did double the amount of tomato and mushroom soup so that I would have extra gravy. Then I added in 1/2c of red wine to give it some extra flavor.   My husband loves it every time I cook it! Especially when I serve it over egg noodles.

I thought this tasted very bland.  The meat fell apart when done cooking, but  it was still chewy.  It also smelled very BAD while cooking.

What an excellent recipe! The meat was so tender, it just fell apart. I only used half a packet of onion soup mix and that was still a little too salty for us. Next time I will add some potatoes to the crock to help absorb the salt content. We loved the gravy so much that I'm thinking about using it as a base for beef stew. Thank you!

Loved this recipe. Was easy and simple to make. London Broil did come out very tender. As someone recommended, I added a bit of red wine and must say the sauce was tasty. I do feel that adding much of the onion soup mix will make it salty. I opted to sprinkle a bit and felt that it was too salty. Than I chose to shave off some of the onion soup mix off the top. If I had not done so, I'm afraid it would have been too overpowering and would have made it too salty. Overall great recipe. Thanks, for I will be making again and again.

For me this recipe was just "ok"...sorry.  Ingredients reminded me a lot of my simple, yet amazing Pot Roast, only with the tomato soup.  The meat definitely fell apart but I found it to be very, very dry.  It certainly wasn't bad...I just wanted it to be better.  Probably won't try again.

This recipe is so yummy and easy to make. The first time I made it I didnt have any cans of tomato soup in the house so I used a can of tomato paste.  I did not want it to be too thick so I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom instead of 1. Also, I used dried onion flakes instead of onion soup mix so it wouldnt taste too salty.  The second time I made this recipe I used 1 can tomato soup and 2 cans cream of mushroom and the dried onion flakes.  Surprisingly, I think it came out much better the first time with the tomato paste.  Tastes best either way served over rice!

I really wanted to make this recipe, but after checking for all the ingredients in the morning, I realized that I did not have tomato soup or dry onion mix!  Luckily, I had pre-marinated the meat the night before with McCormick seasoning, salt, pepper, Texas Pete, and some Cinnamon Chipotle rub for some kick. So, I poured half the can of cream of mushroom soup on the bottom of the crock pot, layered the london broil on top, and then covered it with the remaining soup. I then added a 1/2 cup of chicken broth and turned it on low.  When I got home 10 hours later, I smelled the deliciousness before I even opened the front door. It turned out great! The meat simply melted with the touch of the fork. Next time, I will follow this recipe by the book, but either way - this shows crock pots are great!!

My picky husband loved this!! Which says wonders. Both my girls loved it too. We made it with london broil and served over white rice. I was short on time so I cooked it on high for 3 hours the meat was very tough so I think that would because of cooking so fast.

I followed the recipe and thought the sauce was good, but the texture of the London Broil was unappealing.  The recipe would be better with a fattier, less tender cut of meat such as a chuck roast or short ribs.  Save the London Broil for the grill.

I love this recipe.  I did listen to others and changed it a bit.  2 cans cream of mushroom, 1 can tomato and 1 package onion soup mix.  The sauce is delicious.

At first I liked it, but after a couple of bites the sauce tasted too ready made to me. My boyfriend liked it though.

I followed the directions and the meat came out way overcooked.  I think it would be fine, I just have to figure out the cooking time.

This recipe was amazing and so very simple. I had to change the cream of mushroom soup (as son is allergic to mushrooms), so I used cream of asparagus...Oh my, this was absolutely melt in your mouth wonderful! Thank You!

I wanted to try this recipe because of its simplicity...and I'm happy to say that it was delicious.  I ended up using 2.8 lbs of boneless chuck pot roast (it was on sale) and used 3/4 of onion-mushroom soup mix.  (It was a little salty for my taste, so next time, I'll use 1/2 of the soup mix packet.)  I added a can of sliced mushrooms about 15 minutes before serving.  It was yummy with mashed potatoes (for me) and steamed rice (my hubby & our 13 yr old son), with a bag of veggies (squash, okra, tomato, and corn) on the side!  I'll definintely cook this again.

It's true . . . the smell is strange in the house!  But try it anyway; the taste is NOT how it smells.  It's delicious.  We took a chance and had this for Easter supper . . . put it in before church and when we walked in afterwards, the smell made us think, "Uh Oh!"  But that turned into "Yum!" after we snuck a piece to make sure it was okay.  I sauteed mushrooms in garlic and butter to serve with, along with the mashed potatoes.  Super easy.  Try it!

This was absolutely delicious.  My family loved it. I doubled the soups and it made lots of tasty gravy.  I used savory herb and garlic soup mix because that is what I had on hand.  I also served the meat and gravy over rice.  I will definately make this again.

I would never make this again.  It was extremely salty and I did not like the taste.  I enjoy all three soups and thought it would be great.  The recipe was so easy I thought all would be good.  Not so.  I can't even give a suggetion as to how this would be better.  Sure low sodium soups would lower the salty taste but that does not change the taste.  I even put it over rice in the hopes of absorbing the sauce but it didn't help.  I wanted to love it but it just didn't work for me.

This is very similar to a recipe I've used for roast beef and it came out pretty much the same. Mostly in pieces so it was treated as more of a stew than anything. We served it over beef rice. I'll probably try this one again, maybe with chicken.

Wonderful, tender, easy, great flavor... everything to make a great meal.  My family loved it.  This will definitely be a favorite for us and we'll make it often. I did not have any dry onion soup mix but improvised with beef bouillion and onion powder.  Turned out great.

Although I wasn't blown away by the taste, the ease of preparation was great.  Literally took just a few minutes to pull together.  There just wasn't that 'wow' factor I was hoping for based on other reviews.

I tried this recipe with the carrots and potatoes and the reduced fat/sodium as others suggested. I doubled the soups because my husband likes a lot of gravy, I had over 2lbs of meat plus the veggies. I didn't care for it. It wasn't "pot roasty" enough for me, even minus some of the gravy. Not bad, just not my taste.

I am giving this a 4 because my husband and sister-in-law loved it. I, however, was not impressed. I did change it up a bit. I used a roast instead of a london broil because that is what I had on hand. I added some cubed potatoes and onions. I found the gravy to be bland. I may make this again for my husband but I will be making me a different dinner that night.

I made this and it came out great.  I used flank steak that was labeled for use making London broil.  Based on other reviews I added a tbs of red wine vinegar and worc. sauce.  I only cooked for 5 hours and I think I could have done it in 4.  I think it depends on the slow cooker for how long it takes.  Mine is on the new side and so cooks things faster.

It was a lazy Saturday and I was thinking about doing a pot roast. Already got the meat, carrots, parsnip, turnip in the fridge and I got this recipe in the email.  Sounds easy enough except I only have a can of cream of mushroom (w/ roasted garlic) and a can of beefy mushroom soup in the pantry. Didn't feel like going to the grocery store so I mixed the cream of mushroom, beefy mushroom soup and a can of diced tomatoes, pour it over the beef and root veggies and turn the slowcooker on for 4 hours.  Came out great!

Well, I took the advice of a few and only cooked this for about 5 hours... I was quite disappointed that the meat was not very tender and I bought a very good piece of London Broil!  I will try this again though, cook it a bit longer and possibly add some cut up onion.  I only used half the package of soup and it was not salty at all.

This recipe was ok.  It was a little bland and didn't love the combination of tastes.

A 3.5* - would have been a 4* but after aprox 9 hrs this flank was still tough!! Flavour was great but in following the directions, even after this amount of time on low - it was just too tough.

I used 2 cans low sodium tomato and 2 cans low sodium cream of mushroom.  I stirred the cans of soup with the 1 packet of onion soup mix in the crock pot and then added the meat on top of the gravy and pushed the meat down so that the gravy covered the meat.  I stirred the gravy every 2 hrs due to my need to check on stuff.  After 10 hrs, the meat was so tender that it just melted in your mouth.  Very delicious on top of homemade garlic cheese bread and on top of homemade mashed potatoes!  So good!!!

Well I had to make a few changes based on what I had on hand and I also followed some of the other reviewer's tips.  I didn't have onion soup mix but I added a bunch of raw onions and spiced/floured the meat, I didn't have tomato soup either so added some watered down tomato puree which I flavored up a bit with some garlic, etc.  I also added a splash of Worcestershire sauce, potatoes, carrots, mushrooms,  and crushed garlic.  I cooked on high for 5 hours and it came out great!  Good easy low key recipe.  I love slow cookers!

This is a Great meal!! My daughter, who is not a meat eater, requests it often! We serve it over different kinds of pasta noodles. I just add a little more water and I season the meat.

This was sooo easy to make, and delicious too! I forgot to get some dry soup mix from the grocery store, so I sliced up some mushrooms, celery, onion, and green bell peppers and added it. I also added some Worcheshire sauce, garlic salt, seasoning salt, and pepper to the meat after I put it in the crock pot. I've made this a couple of different times using different ingredients and it's come out wonderful every single time!

This was really really good.  The only negative (and why I gave it 4 stars was that it really smelled up the house....I think next time I will add some red potatoes and veggies to make a great pot roast dinner.

We are big pot roast fans...never even bought flank steak before, but I have to tell you, it was worth the price (I paid $5.69 per pound!).  This cooked the full 10 hours and was just delicious...stringy but tender and moist...not at all fatty like traditional pot roasts.  And the flank steak has a richer flavor than the other cuts of meat.  Served it with steamed red bliss potatoes tossed in butter and fresh parsley and some sauteed escarole in garlic oil.  Yummy!

I liked the sauce but London Broil was the wrong cut of meat for us.  It came out hard and dry.  I'll use the standard beef pot roast cut next time.  It would be great with carrots and potatoes added in.  Thanks for sharing!

I hate to disagree with all the 5 star reviews, but we really didn't care for the tomato/mushroom soup combination.  I used real onions instead of the dry soup mix, which probably saved it from the trash because it was pretty salty from the canned soups, let alone adding a packet of that dry onion soup mix.  I used a 'london broil' which is what is sold in my neck of the woods, and after 8 hours on low, yes it fell apart, but also somehow the meat was dry.  I don't think london broil was meant for a crockpot, not enough fat.  Sorry but we won't be making this again.

Not bad at all -- certainly a good meal to come home to on a cold night.  There is a bit of an artificial taste.  My husband said it tasted like Dinty Moore, but we'd probably have it again.

I made this recipe as stated and it was really good. It took me less than 5 minutes to throw together before work and the gravy was tastey enough to make boxed mashed potatoes taste great.  I will try adding fresh mushrooms next time...and maybe golden mushroom soup.

I made this recipe for dinner the other night. The smell as it was cooking wasn't too appetizing, but I had read that ahead of time and was waiting for the end result. When it was finished we both ate some and it tasted ok but not great. A little while later, I went to clean up and the smell started to make me feel nauseated.  My husband mentioned the same thing, and we decided not to keep the leftovers. I wouldn't make this again.  While the meat came out extremely tender, the flavor and smell of the sauce was a turnoff.

This was good; it wasn't exciting, but it was good.  I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be enjoyable. I wouldn't make it for a dinner party or any special occasion because it's really not any different then any other piece of meat that is cooked in cream of mushroom. It tastes good but it's pretty generic.

I used flank steak and was impressed by how tender the meat turned out. I also added worchestershire, red wine vinegar, and garlic. My (picky) kids liked it and we used the leftovers (without the gravy) to make tostadas.

I added carrots, celery and onion and it came out tasting more like a beef stew. The flavor is pretty good, however very traditional tasting. I would make this again just because it's so simple. The beef did come out a little more shredded than I would have liked it to.

This was very good.  It tasted a little like a lazy osso buco.  I used "healthy choices" tomato and mushroom soup.  I sauteed onions and garlic instead of using the onion soup mix to cut down on salt.  Will make again!

So, so easy and the gravy was great.  I used only a 1/2 pkg of onion soup mix and this was plenty.  I added 1 T. of worcestershire.  Cooked on high for 1 hour, low for 6 hrs - this was enough to make it fork tender. Served over mashed potatoes.

This was the best and EASIEST recipe ever!!  I am pretty new to cooking so I was obviously nervous to host a Rosh Hashana dinner last night.  I made the recipe as is (for 8 people) and even though we only had 5 it was all gone! It was delicious!  And it's unbelievably easy!!  I took other's advice and doubled the canned soups, used low sodium, added a few splashes of worchestshire sauce and red wine vinegar.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

"tomatoey".  My son and husband did not like the sauce. They said the tomato soup overpowered the taste of everything.  Does anyone have any suggestions of a substitute for the tomato soup?

This was great! I added some carrots and celery to make it more of a stew and it was delicious. I'll definitely make this again. It will be great for those cold winter days. Thanks!

This was the first time I had ever made a London Broil.  My husband, friends, & our kids all LOVED it.  Made it again for visiting family & they loved it too.  I love that it's so darn easy!!

Yes, it was easy, but we had leftovers that no one wanted, and that is significant, to me.  So-so beef supper; not bad, but nothing to rave about.

This was ok, but I probably wouldn't make it again.  It was great to find a recipe that would make London Broil edible!  And so tender!!  It really was falling apart!!  But it's a really ugly dish to look at and very salty and all around bland.  It was just ok for us.

This deserves 5 stars for ease, but I gave it just 4 stars for overall flavor.  It is a great way to use an inexpensive cut of meat, and SUPER easy and fast to make, just not very interesting...meat with brown gravy.  But if that's what you want, you've got it!  Serve with mashed potatoes.

London broil should only be cooked on the grill. It is too tough using this method.  I prefer medium rare to rare for this cut of meat which is impossible to get in slow cooker. Probably will not use again.

First time making this recipe. Mixed dry onion soup mix into tomato/mushroom soup mixture rather than putting on top.  Kids loved the sauce -- put it on their mashed potatoes and veggies!! Recommend watching the cooking time depending on the cut of meat used ... 10 hours was too long -- meat was a little overdone/tough.

Mmmmm!  What a wonderful comfort food to come home to after a long day at work!! The london broil fell apart it was so tender, the sauce was great with crusty bread to soak up the juices!  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes, and a green salad. It was enjoyed by everyone, especially my family!

This was pretty good, and a very easy way to cook an inexpensive cut of meat.  We used a 2lb london broil, one can cream of celery, one can tomato soup, one can water, packet of onion soup mix, a splash of worcestershire, one sliced onion, and two tblspoons garlic.  Cooked on low 10 hrs and served over noodles.  Perfect amount of gravy (had to skim a bit of grease off first). Meat was falling apart. I might play around with differnt flavors with this one.

We truly enjoyed this recipe. I used two cans of each soups and seasoned the meat prior to adding the soup on it. I put on to cook prior to work and ended up working late that night. It ended up cooking for 12 hours and it was so tender! Thanks!

Talk about EASY! Good Grief! The taste of this dish was great as well. I did not seem to have tomato soup on hand, so a can of crushed tomatoes were used instead. I also used a few dashes of worcestershire as per the other reviews. Came home to a delicious meal after ten hours. Paired it with some jasmine rice and early peas. YUM! Thanks!

This was pretty good.  I enjoyed it, but was a little disappointed after reading the rave reviews.  I will make again in a pinch because it uses ingredients that are usually always on hand, but it isn't going to the top of the rotation list by any means.

We loved this recipe. I made it with a small flank steak, but used the two full cans of soup to make more gravy. I did find low sodium versions, and it did help with the saltiness. The gravy was delicious, and the meat fell apart like pot roast. I am eating low-carb, so I served this over cauliflower mash instead of potatoes, and it was absolutely delicious. The combination of flavors was wonderful, and it was quickly added to our normal rotation. This is one of the easiest meals I have made and it was Five Stars.

Thanks for sharing. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added an additional can of cream of celery soup, used only 1/2 packet of onion soup, and added about a tbsp of worcestershire sauce. My husband really enjoyed this, I thought it was good but a bit salty. For the three people in our family, I think the two cans of soup called for would be sufficient for the gravy. Next time, I will seek out low-sodium soups and add about 1/4 tsp of pepper. Great way to use up the London Broil that's been sitting in my freezer!

This wasn't particularly good, but it wasn't bad either.  It was just meat and gravy.  I guess that with all of the great reviews I was expecting something a little more special.

Quick, easy, great tasting!!!!  Definitely does not need any extra salt... 

Next time I will double the gravy and add in chopped potatos, carrots, and onions. Will be a household staple!

My family loved this recipe.  I used a 2 lb. venison roast and I came out very tender.  The gravy was delicious.  I also added some worcestershire sauce, garlic and pepper and halved the onion soup mix.  With the low sodium soups it was not salty at all.  Will definitely make again!

Wonderful! I used an inexpensive cut of beef. Added a few squirts of Worcestershire sauce along with black pepper and garlic powder. Added carrots half way and cooked for 9-10 hours on low. I love the tender meat when it falls apart! Served it over wheat egg noodles. Next time I want to try it with biscuits. Thank you!!

EASY!!!!  Not only that, it turned out really really yummy!  I used flank steak.  I would also consider using a small roast.

Excellent!  I made up my own onion soup mix and stirred it into the soups before pouring it over the meat.  I didn't change anything else.  It came out delicious!

Delish. Added red wine  but overall it made a tough cut of meat very tender. My grandmother even loved it and she's an extremely discriminating cook herself. Definitely make it again.

This is excellent. I did added onions and garlic to the slow cooker as suggested. And added 1 oz of dry onion soup mix instead of 1/2 oz as suggested if your making it for 4 servings. I did added about 1/2 of water to the cooker about half way thru. I don't know if it is just mine. But when I had it it remembered of pot roast. Very Very Good ....Thanks again ...

This was a meal right up my husbands alley.  A great way for me to use otherwise tough london broil I had in my freezer.  The only thing I did different was to add only the juice from a can of French onion soup.  I think it worked out perfect.  I served it over mashed potatoes.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the sodium content.  Really high.

Pretty good recipe....I am trying to come up with recipes based on sale items and this is a good one, since almost everything else in it is usually in my pantry.
It tasted pretty good, next time I will use the leftovers for a little shepherds pie.

This was a lot better than I thought it would be. I had 4 1/2lb. pieces of thin cut london broil. I followed directions exactly except I cooked mine on high for about 5 hours. About 2 hours into cooking, I tasted the sauce and found it to be really acidic from the tomato soup and I almost doctored it, but I decided to leave it alone and see what would happen. I'm glad I did because it really did mellow out nicely. Very simple dish and definately the most tender london broil I have made b/c usually it is such a tough cut of meat. Definately will be making again.

It sounded so good and easy, I thought I would give it a try. Of the 15 folks that ate with us, most enjoyed the flavor but all thought it was a bit dry. The gravy was wonderful! I may try this recipe again but not cook it as long.

This was a delicious meal and very easy to prepare.  I made it as is and cooked it on low for 7 hours.  I will probably cook it a little bit longer next time because it wasn't as tender as I was expecting it to be but it was VERY tasty.  I also thought that the tomato soup was going to taste a little weird but all of the flavors blended nicely together.

This is REALLY good and VERY popular with my church dinners. I used regular London broil, rather than flank steak. I thought it would be overly salty using all that canned soup, but it isn't. It makes an incredible gravy, so make extra mashed potatoes!! Also can be easily doubled.

I'm giving this one three stars only because I made a change to it and allthough the meat was falling apart when I cut it, it wasn't moist at all. That said it could have been the meat that was the problem. However about an hour and a half to 2 hours before it was ready to serve, I decided that the recipe was lacking something. The texture wasn't creamy enough for me, so I added 8 oz of cream cheese and portabella mushrooms. The gravy was WONDERFUL over mashed potatoes! I'll make again, but next time I'll try a different cut of meat.

I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup and added sliced onions in the bottom of the crock before placing the meat.  Added a handful of baby carrots about 1 hour before serving (perfectly done, not mushy!).  Served with brown rice to make use of the gravy.  I wanted to love this one, but even with the tomato soup, it was ordinary.  Seems that slow cooker beef always has that same stringy texture.  Might try this again with a pork roast.

We really liked the taste of the sauce. I used golden onion mix and did not find it salty at all- and I used the reduced fat cream of mushroom soup. Next time I think that I will use a cheaper cut of meat. To me most beef turns out the same in a slow cooker.

I just didn't love this one.  It was fine, but not something I'd make again.  There are a number of great slow cooker recipes out there that I'd make before I'd ever consider doing this one again.

Superb!  I made this exactly by the recipe directions, and it turned out wonderful, and was so easy to make.  I don't understand the complaints by others that this tastes too salty, my family loved it.  I guess the sodium content is high due to the canned soups and onion soup mix, but it is yummy!

My husband and kids absolutely LOVE this recipe, and so do I because of the ease of cooking it!  The sauce/gravy it makes is great to dip a nice piece of toasted french bread into.

I love this recipe, but in a move toward economy I tried it with 2 lbs boneless shortribs.  Browned them first, added 1/2 red wine and a bay leaf.  Still 5 star taste at 1 star price.  This sauce rocks!  thanks again!

Good recipe. Easy and tasty. Four stars for taste and five stars for the prep time. I managed to elimate on of the steps. I mixed the soups together in the crock pot and then put the meat and 1/2 a package of onion soup mix.  Kept me from having to wash and extra dish :) Thanks for sharing this recipe.

My family had their doubts when I made this but it turned out pretty well. I would use reduced sodium soup as it was a little salty, but not unbearable. It tastes great over mashed potatoes or rice.

I tried really hard to like this recipe because of all the great reviews and how easy it is to make. However, mine didn't seem to make as much gravy as everybody else's did and it was rather salty. Because the meat was so tender, it fell apart into a sort of shredded beef stew looking blob at the bottom of the slow cooker.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS and soooo easy to prepare!  Literally 3 minutes in the crockpot and voila! Eight hours later - YUM! Will make again and again.

This was delicious! The meat was so tender. It should get extra stars for the ease of preparation. I was a little unsure about tomato soup and cream of mushroom mixing together, but with the beef it makes an excellent gravy. I stirred the onion mix into the soups and added a little Worcestershire before pouring it over the beef. My flank steaks were frozen and came out perfect cooked on low for 8 1/2 hours. I added fresh mushrooms an hour before it was done. We had ours with mashed potatos and it was the perfect combo. I will definately start making this regularly.

GREAT Recipe Merri!! My family loved it. Was very tasty. Only used 1/2 of onion soup as others said. Gravy was great over mashed potatoes. It is a keeper at my house

I loved how tender it made my cheap cut of meat (2lbs of bottom round steak), and, as all the other reviewers have said, the gravy was delicious over mashed potatoes.  Four and a half stars.  I'll make this again.

Delicious!!!!The only adjustment I made was I didn't use the entire packet of onion soup mix. I only used about half. This is super easy to make and absolutely yummy!!!

This was ok, but the onion soup mix taste gets blah after a while.  Its not something I am going to make again.  Nothing special.

I feel bad giving this only 3 stars after all the rave reviews.  I have mixed feelings on this one.  The meat just fell apart, which I really loved.  And the flavor of the sauce is great, but my meat turned out very dry.  I might try this again though, and shorten the cooking time.  My kids ate it with no gravy, and with ketchup instead and they loved it.  And my husband smothered it with the sauce and said he thought it was a 4 star recipe.

Very easy to make and makes the house smell great. I put in 16 oz frozen beans 20 minutes before it was done and turned up slow cooker to high to make it a more substantial (and easy) meal. Very flavorful.

THIS RECIPIE MAKES A REALLY RICH GRAVY WHICH WENT WELL OVER EGG NOODLES BUT WOULD BE JUST AS GOOD OVER RICE.  VERY EASY TO PREPARE.  MOIST & FLAVORFUL.
