I omitted ALL of the salt, since that much isn't healthy and I let everyone salt their own.  Otherwise, the flavors were wonderful.  Marked it as 3 stars due to the extremely unhealthy salt content--1 tbsp. would have been more than enough for my entire crockpot, let alone 7 (since I halved the recipe).

Fabulous recipe.  I use high quality sea salt so there isn't much sodium and you get a lot of wonderful minerals.  This is by far the best broth recipe I've found. Thank you for sharing.

I scaled this to 6 servings and used the carcass with meat and skin from a rotisserie chicken. I put 1 tsp of regular salt and used all minced garlic and no garlic powder. I also left the celery leaves on. I let the whole thing cool, put in the fridge overnight and then skimmed all the fat off the top. It came out great.

Excellent! I am never buying canned broth again! But, I will use less salt next time. Otherwise it is awesome.
