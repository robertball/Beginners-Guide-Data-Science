Wow! This was really good and a complete departure from the typical "bacon and egg" wrap I'm used to for breakfast. I cut the recipe in half to give it a try and was pleasantly surprised. Along with the pineapple I added some sliced strawberries and blueberries I had on hand. This was a great way to use cottage cheese and it has a nice crunch from the granola complimented by the sweetness of fresh fruit. Very easy and very tasty!

I was a little uneasy about this one. Didn't know how the cottage cheese would taste with everything. It was so tasty!!!! Perfect for an easy breakfast!

I love cottage cheese for breakfast, so I was very intrigued with this recipe.  I did sub strawberries for the pineapple, one- because I had them and two- because I'm not real big on pineapple and cottage cheese together.  This was a great filling breakfast.  I would make them again the same way.  I feel you could omit the brown sugar and it will be just as good.  Thanks Katie for a new breakfast idea.

I thought this was such a great idea! I got the cottage cheese with the pineapple in it (I love that, but seldom get it so it was a treat!) and I made one for myself on Saturday - no one else in my family would care to try this - and the second on Sunday without the brown sugar - I don't think the brown sugar is necessary but that could just be me. I can't wait to try it with berries too like in the picture!

I thought these sounded wonderful. Added some  chopped strawberries like the pic showed. Served them this  morning to my 4 and 6 year old who love all these ingredients.... didn't go over well. They didn't like the combination. Ended up picking out the fruit then eating the tortilla seperate. Thanks anyway!

The first time I made these, I omitted the sugarand replaced the pineapple with mixed berries. It was ok. The kids were kind of picky about them. The next time, my husband made them. He is the type to grill EVERYTHING so, of course, he tried to grill these. Definitely an improvement!! He made them without the sugar as well and replaced the pineapple with blueberries. I will definitely be grilling these again.

Personal preference, I left out the bananas and brown sugar..  Substituted raspberries.  Loved it.  Nice easy way to eat breakfast on the go.

Quick and easy and a nice twist on breakfast! Left out with brown sugar and added strawberries instead. I will definitely be making this again.

This one went over like a lead balloon with out household. I thought it was okay, but the rest said never again.
