I brought this recipe to a potluck where the theme of the evening was "curry".  Everyone at the potluck loved this recipe.  There were NO LEFTOVERS!  This was the first time I came home without leftovers.  It was easy to prepare and easy to clean up.  Keep in mind that every brand of curry is a different combination of spices.  So, each time we make this recipe, it will taste a little different.

These were okay but the Olive Cheese Melts (on this site) are way better. Same basic idea but with mayo.

Mmmm tasty!!  I left out the black olives (I had none) and used a Monterey Jack blend and they were great!

We liked these, but I felt they needed a binder like some mayo or something. Still good though! Thanks for sharing. :)

We have been making this in our household for over 35 years. I cannot impress the importance of toasting the english muffins enough. These will be mushy if the muffins are not toasted prior to spreading on the mixture.  Also:taste, taste, taste! The olives and curry make this extremely salty. Extra-sharp cheddar can add to the saltiness, so I always use mild. You can almost halve the curry without losing the flavor, if curry isn't your favorite.

These were quick and easy to make.  I thought they were okay but my husband seemed to really like them.
