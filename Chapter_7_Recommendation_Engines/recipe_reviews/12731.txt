This would be a five star recipe if you use a different fish and don’t use the drippings to make the sauce.  If this recipe looks good to you but you don’t like fishy tasting fish just make these small changes. Either make sure you are using DOVER SOLE (only sole that is not fishy!) or use Orange Roughy. Or just any white fish that is extremely mild. And to make the sauce double the lemon juice mixture and use half for cooking the fish and the other half for making the sauce. Then the sauce is excellent (on lots of things) and there is no fishy tasting anything!!!! You can also replace the shrimp for crab if you choose.

This was very easy to make. A nice way to use sole. The only change I made to the recipe was adding a bit of red pepper to the sauce. Very tasty.. will make again.

Simply amazing!!!  This recipe is so easy to make, and tastes absolutely amazing! My partner is a frenchman, and very fussy about food, and he loves this dish...as do several friends we've had over for dinner! Tastes great just following the recipe, or you can adjust the wine or the lemon, or any of the ingredients for that matter, to suit your tastes.  Fool proof and one worth adding to your recipe book!!!  5 Stars definitely!!

This recipe was a little hard to make. It did taste very good though. The only think that I dident like about it was the strong after taste, other than that, it was very yummy!

We liked this.  I was in a hurry so did not make the sauce - but the fish still tasted great.  I also made a change.  Since I didn't have shrimp in the house, I made a filling out of canned salmon instead (1 can of salmon, 1 garlic clove, 1 tbsp lemon juice, salt and pepper).  We liked it!

Excellent: We had this recipe for dinner tonight . It was easy and took the same cooking time as boiling the new red potatoes. and DH said it was very good.  Next time I would spicy up the sauce with a bit of hot sauce or peppers.  Loved it. price wise - the sole cost 2.67 on sale and the shrimp cost 2.06.  Pretty gourmet for $4.73   lees

This fish tasted good until I put the sauce over it..then it was too fishy.  I wanted the sole because it had little fish flavor.  I don't like fish much.

Okay, but a little bland and dry. If I were to make this recipe again I would bump up the spicing considerably, perhaps with lots of fresh dill and thin lemon slices. Also, I would bake it for about 10 minutes less and then check for doneness. Overall, it is a "healthy" recipe that tastes "healthy".... in other words, there's nothing wrong with it that a few dollops of cream cheese wouldn't fix.

Simply the best.  I'm a male and I had no flour so I added a tablespoon of instant potato flakes to thick the sauce. My wife believes I am a great cook.

I did not have the shrimp so substituted a 6 oz. can of crabmeat.  It was good but a little bland.  I did add some crushed red pepper as suggested by other reviewers but it did not seem to help.  Might make it again, might not.  Will certainly try to add more flavor

This was really good.  I substituted white onion for the green (none on hand), and didn't really measure the other ingredients.  I had to cook and chop up some regular shrimp (what I had in the freezer).  I loved the flavors together, but thought that with a little basil, the sauce would have been even better.  I also added a smidge more flour to make the sauce a little thicker.  Great recipe.  I'll make it again.

This recipe is great for someone who doesn't have alot of experience cooking. It's quick and simple to make and it taste great. But if you dont like the fish taste don't make it because it does have a stronger taste then you would expect

As another reviewer stated, a little 'fishy'.  I am going to try this again and marinate the sole for about an hour or two before cooking, and then follow the recipe adding a few more of my favorite spices.  This recipe has great potential!

My family loved it, and will definately be doing it again. I did make a few minor modifications.  I used the seasonings listed, but also aded  adobo, orageno, and basil and used white zifandel for the wine. I also didnt make the cream base at the end.

This was okay but nothing special.  I was not able to role the fish it was too thick I guess.  So, I just topped the fillets with the shrimp.  I wasn't bad just not great...if you know what I mean.

I made it exactly as written, except used flounder because it was what I had in freezer and cut up large frozen shrimp.  It came out good.  The sauce was good, lemony and buttery.  I had forgotten the paprika but then added it right before the end.  It gives it a little color otherwise the fish is so white it looks underdone.  I put under broiler while making sauce.

Made this tonight with a couple of changes and it was really simple and great. Substituted vegetable broth for the wine and  I zested the lemon and sprinkled a little on top of the shrimp before rolling it up.After baking and pouring the sauce over I sprinkled the rest of the lemon zest over it and just a pinch of paprika. I used white pepper as well. Really good, filling,great flavor, husband loved it. I told him hey if we ordered this in a restaurant it would be a $50 meal at least ! Served with rice and broccoli.

Pretty good, but it doesn't look anything like the picture. I don't know what the green seasonings are, but it looked good. Taste was pretty bland, but there's a lot of hope. More garlic, use sea salt. I'll read through the reviews to see if there are additional seasonings to include.

For less calories, skip the sauce & wine, sprinkle with lemon juice & herbs. Before folding over to secure with toothpicks, add a generous strip of string cheese. Sprinkle tops with Johnny;s seasoning salt or red sea salt. The cheese gives moisture in place of the wine if you do not have any. Especially good with Tallapia fish or Dover Sole.      Bake at 400 degrees for 15 to 20 mins.

I made this and it was good, but missing something, needs a zestier sauce...a little bland, but I will still make it again and maybe thicken the sauce with cornstarch and ? for flavor

This was great! But I made one addition, I added a bit of softened cream cheese to the shrimp. Some leaked into the sauce, but that was good, as it made the sauce creamier. I wasn't sure how to cook sole before, but I think I'll be sticking to this recipe now.

A perfect example of the SUM BEING GREATER THAN THE PARTS! Would highly advise using DOVER sole (or as someone suggested, Orange Roughy) for its light and not-so-fishy flavor.  Only made two additions; a few red pepper flakes and also added capers after pouring the sauce on the finished dish. This is sooooooo good! Easy, too.

this was a fairly good recipe. i followed it exactly but used lime juice instead of lemon because i was out. the stuffing came out with a little too much of it, but i just added it to the sides of the fish in the pan. make sure you chop up your broccoli. next time i will also add more cheese. after it was done baking i sprinkled some garlic powder and paprika on top. defiantly helped out the flavor.

I agree with SIKESK - awesome recipe.  Will make again!  I used orange roughy, just as good!
