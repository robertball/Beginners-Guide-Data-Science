MMMMmm... delicious! A tip for easier coating, use tongs OR your left hand to dip in the egg, and let all the excess drip off before placing into the coconut mixture. Then use your right hand to sprinkle some of the coconut over the top and press down into it, flip and press down again. This method will help you avoid getting a battered and breaded "club hand", the term used by chefs for this problem! Line up the corn starch dip,  egg dip, coconut mix and then a plate ready for the finished fillets. You can do this "assembly line" process beforehand, then refrigerate till ready to fry. This also makes the coating stick MUCH better! A little resturant tip.

This really is an excellent dish.  I baked the tilapia at 350 degrees for about 20-25 minutes i believe and turned it twice to crisp both sides.  it turned out wonderful.  the apricot dipping sauce is excellent!

It turned out just like the picture, and the taste was very appealing.  I did end up baking it instead, 425 degrees for 10-12 minutes, and was pleased with the result.

This is a WONDERFUL way to cook tilapia! My family enjoyed it from the very first bite. It was very easy to make, yet elegant to eat. I made a few adjustments and it turned out perfectly. First, I cut the tilapia loin fillets in half (easier to work with) for 8 nice pieces. I used Baker's Angel Flake sweetened coconut, right out of the package (not finely chopped). It made the texture perfect and crispy (see my photo above). I used 1 whole, beaten, egg in place of the substitute and I put the cornstarch and tilapia pieces into a large ziplock bag and shook them to coat. Tongs were a great suggestion for removing the tilapia from the cornstarch baggie and dipping in the egg and coconut without a mess. To cut down on fat, I baked them in a pyrex dish sprayed with olive oil Pam (also a very light spray on top of the fish to help it crisp up!) @ about 350* for about 20-30 mins. I did not flip them or anything and they were perfectly cooked and crispy on the outside and moist on the inside without being greasy. 
The Apricot Dipping Sauce is amazing! My mom who ALWAYS and ONLY eats fish with tarter sauce said that "THIS was way better!" 
Thanks for this recipe, it is easy, elegant and super delish!   A new favorite in my house!

Baked in the oven as others suggested using a pyrex dish, no need to flip over during cooking.  Always looking for new fish recipes.  This one was easy, different and delicious.  The sauce went perfectly.

This was pretty good. I baked instead of fried and next time I will drizzle a little oil on the top. The fish was moist but the coconut was a little dry.

Really loved the texture the coconut gave.  Only could find sweetened coconut, so maybe a little too sweet for my taste.  Used one whole egg, which was just enough for a pound of fish.  The sauce is nicely spicy/sweet.  An easy meal that "feels" fancy.

This was fantastic!! My husband asked me if I made these or bought them that's how good they are! Even my son who strongly dislikes fish loved this! Few tips: I baked mine at 350 for 20 minutes and sprayed the fillets with pam to keep them from drying out; per another reviewer's suggestion. I think you could take the cornstarch down to about 1/3 cup (I hate wasting ingredients. I had leftover, after 5 fillets, that I just had to throw out.) I didn't have egg substitute so I beat 2 eggs with about 1 TBSP of water added. Also I almost had enough coconut mixture to do 5 fillets so I just eyed the ingredients and added a bit more to cover the 5th fillet. I didn't have the apricot jam or the horseradish sauce so instead I used about 1/4 cup of orange marmalade and 1/4 c of some home made jacked up peach pecan jelly and I used a packet of Arby's horsey sauce, and 1tsp sweet & Hot mustard from Trader Joes, but that made it a little too sweet so I ended up adding 2 tsp of spicy brown mustard and it was yummo!!! So I think the sauce recipe is a little forgiving if you want to use what you have on hand!

This was really good. I followed the recipe as is.  The second time I made this I utilized a set of tongs for coating the coconut.  Doing that made less of a mess on your hands. You could probably make this using shrimp.

Yum, yum! I was nervous as I made the mix, but the end result is tasty. I tried frying the first filet, and that did not go well. I quickly heated the oven to 375 degrees and put the other filet in the oven to bake. MUCH better result. I will keep this recipe, but will always make sure to bake the filets.

My husband and I love this recipe.  Its mild white fish covered in coconut and fried crunchy and then if that wasn't enough, you make a sweet spicy sauce with apricot jam and brown mustard.  I have never tried to change this recipe, you just don't need to.

Original review 2/1/12 - I made this cutting way back on the cornstarch and oil and used one regular egg instead of the substitute.  I used just about 1 T. cornstarch for the two filets I was making and cut the oil to about 2 T.  I didn’t make the dipping sauce as I had another dipping sauce on hand I wanted to use.  But I have made this sauce in the past for shrimp and I can say it is excellent!   A word of caution – watch your heat when frying this fish as the coconut can burn very easily.  UPDATE 5/8/16:  I made this again baking it in a 375 degree oven.  It was good, but if I decide to  bake this again, I'll only coat one side of the fish with the coconut mixture, as the bottom got a little soggy.  Still good though.

Yummy!  Wow, this recipe exceeded my expectations!  The only change in the recipe was with the sauce I heated up the ingredients on the stove and added 2 TBL of Orange juice to it.  It made the sauce a little sweeter and really brought out the spice in the mustard & horseradish.

Like other reviewers, I could only find sweetened shredded coconut at my grocery store.  However, I thought the end result was delicious just the same.

I baked my tilapia for 10 minutes at 425ºF without flipping sides.  Also, I used one real egg (beaten) instead of the substitute, and it turned out just fine.

It's ok, the dipping sauce is the best part - maybe needs a little more coconut.

The sauce was AMAZING! It made all the difference. Husband said the rating would be lower if it wasn't for the sauce. I would give it 4 1/2 if I could. I also baked it at 425 for 15 minutes.

This is an excellent recipe.  Husband and even my three year old loved it.  I forgot to chop up the coconut so it was flakier than the picture.  But still tasted great.  I used unsweetened coconut and Jamaican jerk seasoning instead of creole.  I also added some lime juice in with the egg.  And instead of the dipping sauce I used a mango salsa because I had mangos on hand, so it had more of a tropical feel to it.  It was great though and I will definitely make it again.

This was outstanding and I will be making this often! As many suggested, I baked this at 375 for 15-20 minutes. I didn't have the Creole seasoning so added salt, cayenne & chili pepper. It doesn't say what kind of coconut, so I used sweetened and glad I did. Thank you!!

Very impressive. I used matzo meal for the flour, regular eggs, and oven fried (oil, pan, 350 F, flip half way through cooking). I am not normally a fan of coconut, but ground with the apricot sauce, this was great! Family commented the apricot sauce was so awesome, it would be good on most anything. I used creamy horseradish.

I followed this recipe step by step, except baking instead of frying.  Frying would have made them much more crispier than they were.  I'll definitely make these again.  They were worth the effort.  Don't worry about making too much sauce.  The apricot dip makes an excellent pretzel dip!

Delicious. Love the combination of spicy with the sweetness of the coconut. Coating stuck well. Baked instead of fried per instructions, but it turned out beautifully (did not turn). Flavors of fish really pair well with tlhe sauce, which was about as easy as it gets (did not use horseradish as our brown mustard was spicy). This is definitely a recipe that we'll keep using. Much different than most fish recipes and an exciting preparation of a basic white fish.

I made this last night for dinner. I have to say that I was very dissapointed. I had had coconut shrimp at a southern restaurant before and was looking for that flavour. Unfortunately, I took other user's advice and baked it. Big mistake! Although baking IS better for you, I feel that in this case the fish should be fried as stated in the recipe. I will try this again, but I'll fry it and cross my fingers. My advice, don't skimp on the calories on this one.

LOVED THIS!  I didnt have cornstarch, (the kids used it for a science project) so I used flour and I didnt have appricot jam or horseradish...so I used peach jam and Bold and Spicy brown mustard. YUM! IT was sooo good and the kids at it all!

Everyone in my house loved this, even my daughter that doesnt love much of anything.  It took a bit for me to get the temperature right in the frying pan and the first half came out, what I thought anyway, burnt but everyone seemed to like the burnt as much if not better,  they said it wasnt burnt tasting at all but they sure looked it! haha I recommend frying over the oven even though its a bit more work, I dont imagine they would crisp up as well in the oven but I could be wrong.  I would highly recommend the right hand corn starch, left hand egg technique then pile them up and put them in the coconut right before you place them in the pan otherwise this can get pretty messy! My family loved this...I got multiple thank yous for dinner  last night...always nice!  a must have again meal for sure!

The dipping sauce is phenomenal!!  I liked the fish as well, but I wish I would have fried it - we baked it per another reviewer's suggestion to make this a little healthier, but it just doesn't crisp up when it's baked and that's how I really like it.  Next time we will fry it for sure!

I've been making this recipe since I first found it. Love it! I agree with so many others that it's better when baked. I always found that it burns easily when fried. Great recipe, thank you.

I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I baked it.  I found it bland overall, and the corn starch made the fish almost mushy.  My husband liked it, but he will eat anything.  I almost didn't finish it.  The dipping sauce was good, though.

AMAZINGLY GOOD!  I'm not much of a fish fan but I would have this every week if I could!  The only substitutions made to the recipe were two eggs for the egg substitutes and dijon mustard for the brown mustard.  I've written lots of reviews and this recipe is in my top ten favorites for allrecipes.com!

Delicious and easy to make! For those who want to spare a few calories but don't want to bake it try this: Turn the temp down lower, and in stead of frying it in canola oil, spray just a bit of cooking spray on the pan, then before you flip it spray the edges of the fish, where they're less likely to touch the pan.  I did this, and it turned out delicious, crispy, flaky, and was really easy to make. Thanks for the great recipe!!

This is great! It is important not to let the coconut coating cook too long. A few of mine did and got slightly burnt but even so, they tasted good. The non-burnt ones were fabulous. A real treat, and a great way to eat more fish.

This was awesome! I was looking for something different to do with my fish & luckily I found this recipe. I pulsed the coconut mixture in my food processor & that gave it the perfect consistency. I baked the fish at 350 for about 15-20min & it was crispy perfect. I also used the coconut to coat some zucchini, the fried it in olive oil. Yummy! I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Great recipe. The dipping sauce is great- I used pineapple/apricot preserves, and loved it. I did not have tilapa on hand, and used whiting filets instead, and it worked great. Will try with all types of light fish. Sure it will turn out great.

This turned out great! I baked it in the oven at 425 for 13 minutes and it came out crispy and perfect.

The sauce wasn't what I had hoped for so I think it's just a matter of finding a sauce that compliments this dish better and I would give it a 5.

Made this recipe 2 times. First time, used baker's sweetened flaked coconut. BIG MISTAKE. Second time, used finely shredded unsweetened dried coconut and brown rice flour. MUCH BETTER. Instead of creole seasoning, threw together our favorite spices. Cut up the tilapia into "nuggets" and also shelled shrimp. This was a marvelous dinner!

Really good, but be sure to use good quality fish.  We loved the coconut coating and the dipping sauce, but our fish tasted muddy and that sort of ruined the dish for us.  Not the recipe's fault though--it's great!

This was very tasty and fairly easy to make. It got kind of messy when coating the fish -  batter was sticking to my fingers. Maybe someone has a tip on this technique. Both my husband and children enjoyed this one. I used vegetable oil because it's what I had on hand.

I used the sweetened flaked coconut, made my own creole seasoning from a recipe on the net, used apricot preserves because that's what I had on hand,and followed Diane T's recipe exactly except I fried in Enova oil instead of Canola. This was awesome!  Even with the sweetened coconut, the horseradish and spicy mustard in the dipping sauce balance it out nicely.  It was crispy, tasty, and perfect with the dipping sauce.  Served with Jasmine rice and a nice white wine it made a very easy and excellent light dinner!  I've been looking for another different tilapia recipe and THIS is it.  Husband loved it!

This is an excellent dish. I made it just like the recipe stated and it was wonderful. My husband even enjoyed it! (He does NOT eat fish, but he loves coconut shrimp so was willing to taste this. Reluctantly.) He ate the whole thing and even said he would be happy to have it again! Score!!! If you have a picky eater in your family, this might be a winner. Oh, I didn't have apricot jam, so I used Orange Marmalade. It was delicious.

My husband loved this. I followed the recipe exact and used sweetened coconut flakes (hubby did the shopping and came back with it), while making it I was worried about the sweetness of the coconut but it came out great. The sauce was just perfect. I'm not a fan of horseradish but I didn't mind it in this recipe. Will definitely make this again.

Very different tastes! I never would have imagined this to be a good combination, but it is! I think it would be even better had I had the right ingredients for the dipping sauce, and maybe chopping the coconut would have more of a breading effect than simply leaving them in shreds. It had a sweet yet spicy taste to it.

FANTASTIC!  I made this for myself & two friends and they gave rave reviews too!  This one's a keeper for sure!  I didn't have the apricot preserves so made up another recipe from here that I'd made before for our dipping sauce.  Only differnce - orange marmalade instead of apricot preseves.

I have never cooked fish before in our 7 years of marriage and this was a great recipe to start with! It was delicious and my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I used tips from reviews, so here's some of the things I did....I cooked two fillets and split them down the middle...it did make the fillets manageable as stated. Instead of half a cup of corn starch, I put 2 tbsp in a baggie, placed the fillets inside and shook the bag. I tried 1 tbsp, but it wasn't enough for 2 fillets. Instead of a tbsp of creole seasoning, I used a tsp and it was perfect. I cut the coconut in half, using 1/2 cup, since I only had two fillets, and chopped it in my handy chopper. I think next time I'll use a little more coconut because it was barely enough. I used one egg but want to try just egg whites next time. I pan fried it in 2 tbsp of olive oil and it fried up beautifully, making the coconut nice and crispy. I have an electric stove and put the setting on "8", one notch down from high. I ended up frying it between a 6 and a 7, as the coconut began browning a little too soon on 8. It still tasted delicious and I can't wait to make this again!

Wow!  Delicious!  I did not fry it.  I baked it.  The "breading"  (coconut) stayed on very well. I loved it!!!  So did my husband, who is not a coconut lover!

This is a very nice way to make Tilapia. I took other reviewers' ideas of baking the fish and using non-sweetened coconut flakes. Next time I will add a bit more spice and squeeze some lime over it during baking. The apricot dipping sauce was very good along with the fish; however, I left out the horseradish and it seemed like I was just putting apricot jam on the fish. Not sure if the consistency would have been different with the horseradish in it, but it was still very tasty. I will make again, as my GF really liked it!

I have been looking for a recipe like this for a long time. This one was perfect. I used sweetened coconut and put it with the flour in my food processor to get the pieces of coconut really small. I baked the fish at 425 for about 20 minutes. I only did one piece so it was more than enough time.

This turned out fantastically! I followed the recipe exactly, except used an egg instead of the egg substitute and didn't measure out the cornstarch, but just lightly covered the fish fillets.
Pan-fried them in a little bit of oil, and in just a few minutes it was ready.  Great subtle coconut flavor (used unsweetend coconut) paired well with the sauce.  
Thanks for a great recipe!

This was some of best tilapia I've ever had. I didn't make the sauce because I didn't have the ingredients, but the fish was so good, it didn't need it. I also didn't have creole seasoning, so I made my own; left the coconut course and added a small amount of sugar to the mixture. I pan-fried in canola oil; came out nice and crispy...delicious! I can't wait to use this coating on shrimp!

I baked instead of fried and used cod vs. tilapia. The left overs tasted better than the 1st night. Maybe I'll try again, using the original recipe.

Delicous! Make sure to rinse the fish under cold water before breading it. It takes away some of the "fishy" taste. Also, I added a wee bit of curry powder to the cornstarch for one of the fish fillets. This added a nice element.

I opted to bake the tilapia rather than fry it to save calories.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I enjoyed it very much but my husband and son said it was just okay.  I'm sure they would have liked it if I had fried the fish.

I used Tilapia loins from Sam's Club, ind. frozen. Defrosted them, sprinkled lightly with creole seasoning, lightly with cornstarch then dipped in a mixture of coconut milk and whipping cream and dipped in the coconut, pressing well on both sides. I sprayed Pam on a baking dish, put in the loins and sprayed the tops of them. Baked at 375 for 20 min. so moist with a crunchy top. I had a dipping sauce ready to put on them but they didn't need it. We love coconut shrimp and now we have another great Tilapia recipe to enjoy too!

Too much creole seasoning - it was very salty. I'm going to cut that by half and hope that fixes it. But the amount of "breading" was perfect for 4 fillets. For the dipping sauce, I used 1/3 cup orange jam and 1 tsp german mustard. I think I'll go with apricot jam next time, but same proportions.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful. My Husband, son and wife really enjoyed this one. I'm not a big fish eater but I sure enjoyed this one.
The dipping sauce was good also.

Recipe turned out great!  I had this at a restaurant with a honey cream sauce so I tried to duplicate that sauce instead of the apricot sauce but the fish itself was wonderful.  It turned out very moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  My fiance liked it too - and he's not a "fish" person :)

This was delicious and so easy. I baked it at 375 for 16 min, and it came out perfectly flaky and moist. I used unsweetened coconut and topped the fillets with a bit of coconut oil. I might add salt to the coating next time, but that's just personal preference; otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.

This was FABULOUS!!!  I did use whole wheat flour and sweetened coconut.  Other reviews have said not to use the sweetened coconut but if you are using prepackaged creole seasoning (which is loaded with salt) you need the sweetened coconut to offset the saltiness and it turned out perfectly, IMHO.  I did use the canola oil for frying (medium high heat) and it turned out VERY light, crispy, and moist.  My filets were just over 3 oz each (5 per pound) and I doubled the breading recipe and it made exactly enough.  I was afraid that this would be like most dishes that are fried, you have to watch them like a hawk to keep it from burning.  But not so, just as one was finishing, I'd finished breading the next and was ready to drop it in when I removed the other so it was very smooth, taking around 40 minutes to do 10 filets.  This dish was very easy to do, it only took about 2 minutes per side to finish these filets perfectly (I'd remove them to a warm oven to keep while frying the next batch--fried 2 filets at the time).  I did add more mustard and horseradish to the dipping sauce as we like it spicy!  My family took one bite and said, "You have our permission to make this every single week!!"  And I just may!!

This is sooooooo good!  I do not care for fish, but my kids and husband do, so I make it once in a while.  Even the picky eater in my family (me!) ate an entire fillet!  The sauce was really tasty and went really well with the coconut/spice coating.  Thanks for the recipe!  I'm sure it will be made again.

This is a keeper.  I also used one egg which was just enough for six filets.  I made 1.5 times the amount of coconut mixture and that was just enough.  I baked it for a healthier dish and it turned out great.  Can't wait to share this with others!

This was amazing!! I used 1 egg instead of the egg substitute and baked the fish, turning once, instead of frying. This made the fist a lot healthier and it tasted great!!

This was a great meal that I will definatly meake again.  The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because my husband and I both liked it but neither of us could eat our entire piece of fish because it was a strong sweet flavor (we love sweet too) that got a little old.

I made this for dinner last night and wish I could give it 10 STARS!  It was excellent and we loved the sauce, even though I used peach preserves.  I recommend unsweetened coconut since the dipping sauce is sweet enough.  What little was left over reheated well today.  Thank you for one of the best fish recipes I've ever tried!!

This was wonderful!  My husband really liked it too.  I used 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut, and 1/2 cup sweetened coconut because I wasn't sure which one the recipe called for.  I will make it again that way because it turned out great.  Thank you!

This was excellent, so light and tasty!  The flavors in the sauce give you a fantastic blend of sweet and sour, and that paired with the coconut creole coating on the fish....Mmmmmmm! And it's so quick and easy! Thanks for the recipe, I'll definitely be making this again!  :)

I used white rice flour, recklessly mixed the ingredients in a hurry, and coated white bass. The apricot sauce was icing on the coconut cake.

This is so tasty.  Most of my my family is not fans of fish but they loved this.  I used 2 real eggs and added Creole powder and chili flakes.  I also used a bit more horseradish and Dijon to the apricot jam to make it less sweet.  Excellent recipe!

This was pretty amazing. I put the crust mixture the food processor to get it fine. And it stuck nicely to the fish for a crispy finish!   I also used coconut oil for frying. It turned out nicely! I will probably add cayenne pepper to it nice time as I enjoy a little heat!

WOW! Great tasting and so easy to make. Only diverted slightly from original recipe by spraying with oil after coating in coconut mixture , placed on a lightly  greased cookie sheet, and baked it.

Very very good. I would definitely make again. I try to follow all new recipes I try exactly but I had to use whole eggs, didn't have substitute. I don't think that would change a thing. It was "will make again" good.  Hubby says it's a keeper.  (After coating the fish I let it air dry for a few mins on a cookie rack. )
On the dipping sauce I had to use orange marmalade because that's what the fridge offered I'd definitely use the recipe sauce next time.

Loved the flavor of this dish (especially with the dipping sauce) but find the frying a bit of a chore for clean-up (plus the amount of oil left areas of my pan dry and some of the coconut flakes burned onto the pan). I'll try this again, making sure to remove stray flakes between fish and maybe adding a bit more oil.

Loved the sauce and will definitely try this method on shrimp and chicken strips. I chopped the coconut up fine but will try it larger next time as I used Pickerel and the fish overshadowed the coconut flavour. Watch your heat when frying this fish as the coconut can burn very easily. Next time I will try it in the oven,  425° for approx. 25 min. as suggested.

Easy and tasty--my two favorite things in a recipe!  I added the coating while the tilapia was still frozen and baked it in the oven a few minutes longer.  Turned out great.

The flavours were good, and the sauce spectacular. My non tilapia loving family said the coating and sauce masked the taste of the fish. ( even though tilapia is so mild anyway ). It is hard to know when fried fish is cooked though if you don't fry often and my hubby undercooked mine.  I would like to try baking it next time.  We used coconut oil for the frying.  Will make this again and likely try the sauce with chicken too!

This is another keeper, Hubby was amazed at another gormet creation, wink wink... i baked in oven like others suggested, put broiler on for last few minutes to brown it a bit. LOVED the sauce, i used sweet orange marmalade instead of apricot. and good 'ol Old bay instead of creole seasoning, oh and dont 4get a shake or few of "slap your momma" for pizzaz.

I'm really not a fan of fish but I know it's healthy so I try to incorporate it into our diet (occasionally) :)
When I saw this recipe I was excited to try it since I love coconut shrimp. I took the advice of others and used tongs as well as baking them at 350 for 25 minutes. I sprayed a pyrex dish w/ Pam and also sprayed the top a bit. 
Also I soaked the fish for 30-40 min in "buttermilk" (2 cups milk with the juice 1 lemon squeezed in). It helped get rid of any fishy taste/smell.
The sauce was amazing!!!! My husband said he felt like we were eating at Tommy Bahama :) I served it with steamed broccoli sprinkled with a little seasoned salt. We loved the entire dish, thank you so much for posting it!!

This dish was another crowd pleaser in my family.  My husband LOVED it!  The sauce was really good and the sweetness of the apricot jam stood out more than I thought it would once I mixed it with the other spicy ingredients.  In fact, I bought the reduced sugar version of jam, and it was delicious.  Instead of dipping, we poured it on top of the fish because it was that good!  I did choose to bake instead of fry, but all of the ingredients and preparation were left the same.

The fish tasted starchy from the corn starch - maybe too much of it stuck to the fish, but it was terrible. The coconut I used I think was in too large of strands. Might have worked out if I had skipped the corn starch and then blended the other ingredients in a food processor.

I'm still new to the world of cooking but this recipe was fantastic and simple! My boyfriend bought us a bag of tilapia filets and I wanted to do something different for us and when I came across this recipe I knew I had to try it. Thank you for sharing your yummy recipe. My boyfriend said it was the best Tilapia he has ever had!! eek!! ;)

The family loved it.  Be careful to not over cook the tilapia, cooks vary fast.  Also the 350 degree temp is a bit high.  One more thing, forgo the egg substitute and use the real thing, much better.  Garnish with julienne cut peppers (YUM).

It should be noted that I ignored the measurements given in the recipe and went by what looked right to me. I swapped out the egg substitute for real eggs and  skipped the horseradish in the apricot dipping sauce because it's a bit too strong for my taste.

Fabulous recipe. I had a hard time getting the oil temp just right so the fish was a little dark but it was delicious anyway.

This was really really yummy almost exactly like the shrimp from that restaurant!! I used corn oil instead of canola & it was surprisingly non-fishy!! Very very tasty alot easier than expected. Also this was my first time cooking tilapia. I will definitely make this again.

The concept of this recipe is good, but it needs some work in my opinion. However, I did have to make some substitutions based on what I had on hand. I used lemon pepper seasoning instead of the Creole with the addition of seafood/fish seasoning. Used regular eggs instead of the packaged substitute and replaced the horseradish with grainy Dijon mustard. The coconut did not come through taste or texture -wise; perhaps increasing the coconut to flour issue would resolve this... Also, I find that sweetened coconut has a stronger flavour, that would've cut through the "fishy" taste of the tilapia. Maybe the Creole seasoning is essential to the dish, but I do prefer a light lemon and garlic flavour to my fish. Onto the sauce... I did find it a bit overpoweringly sweet and though this did hide the "fishy" taste, it did not complement it that well. Maybe making the sauce a little creamy and sweet would be better; horseradish and creamed coconut with the apricot jam? Or skip the apricot and go for pineapple? This recipe is worth tinkering with, should I want to serve something like this again... not sure if I will though. This was liked by my fiance though.

This was an excellent, easy recipe.  In order to avoid canceling out any health benefits realized from the fish by preparing it in oil, we baked this on a greased pyrex dish for about 30 minutes at 350. I can imagine that it probably tastes better fried, but it's not worth the calories.   Also, I probably would have given this five stars if the 'dipping sauce' was more impressive.  For me, it just tasted goopy and uninspired.  I think this would be delicious with a mango or apricot salsa instead.    Over all though, it's a nice recipe and we'll definitely make it again.

This was really good!  I didn't have all the ingredients so I subbed a few things...eggs for egg substitute, a Cajun garlic seasoning for the Creole seasoning, and vegetable oil for the canola.  I used an assembly line type set up for the 3 different coatings needed.  Heated the oil between medium and medium high setting on my stove.  Fried each piece until crispy then flipped it over and continued until the fish was flakey.  I also didn't use the apricot sauce.  Instead I used the pina colada sauce that Red Lobster has made famous.  But after tasting the fish by itself, it really didn't need a sauce at all.  Very good : )

YUM! I swear I have never had a bad recipe off this website, they are all soooo good. This is no exception.  I would maybe not add as much as a T of seasoning. I could be a little salty and Im trying to cut down on salt.  Otherwise, very tasty!

I baked the fish instead of frying. The coating was too thick from the cornstarch, and even though I used sweetened coconut, I could hardly taste coconut on the fish. The sauce wasn't all that either.

I made this last night for dinner and it was very good. I did bake it in the oven as others had suggested, since I don't usually fry food. The dipping sauce was different and went with the fish well. It was a simple and quick recipe to prepare and the ingredients are things I usually have around so I know I will be making it again.

Very yummy!  A great fish recipe!  I did everything pretty much the same, except baked it instead of frying (did 425 degrees for 11 min and 2 min on broil).  Might try frying next time just to see the difference, but it's probably healthier baked.  Next time I am making it with coconut rice! (cook the rice in coconut milk) Also might add a bit less horseradish next time.  We loved this one!

YUM!  This is a great recipe for Tilapia, which tends to be a very mild and somewhat bland fish.  My family is not a fan of main dishes that are sweet, but the coconut on the fish and the spicy/sweet of the side sauce is the perfect compliment to this recipe.  We will definitely be keeping this in our 5* recipes for Tilapia!

do not know what happened but i think  tossing the tilapia in corn startch was not the way to go.  I would have tossed it in flour instead. it was wat to salty and had a bad taste. could not taste the coconut flavor.

This was so good. I made my own creole seasoning and didn't put as much cayenne pepper in as it should have to make it more kid friendly. (Although the extra spice would have been nice) I also used peach instead of apricot jam and added some plain yogurt to the dipping sauce. The best coconut shrimp I've ever had had a strawberry yogurt sauce with it, so I thought the yogurt would compliment it well and I was right.

I baked instead of fried. I used a real egg instead of the substitute and skipped the cornstarch. It turned out alright, just not as flavorful as I had hoped. I didn't make the dipping sauce.

This was so YUMMY!!  I made this for my family, which includes a 2 1/2 year old, a 9 year old, and my in-laws.  It was a hit!!! for everyone.  I try to incorporate a fish meal every week and I am so happy to add this recipe to my list.  Tastes great with orange sauce using marmalade.  I served it with tropical rice and a spinach salad.  Also great with spicy fries.

WOW, one of my favorite fish recipes ever! Tastes restaurant quality. The dipping sauce is amazing, sweet and tangy, and the fish was tender and moist with a light crispy crust. Though it may not be super healthy bc of the breading/frying, I will definitely make this again on special occasions.

I was so excited to try this recipe - lots of my favorite ingredients. :-)  I am happy to say that it turned out very good!  I made a couple of changes, based on availability/preference.. such as not wanting to waste an egg on just one tilapia filet (just cooking for me/one), so I made a mayo/lime mixture... not too pleased with myself there, but it kind of worked as the 'adhesive' for the coconut.  I also used brown rice flour, since I'm allergic to wheat flour.  I found unsweetned grated coconut, which I LOVE!  I started the filets off in the pan using a lot less oil, but then moved them to the oven for 20 minutes at 350F.  The sauce was also DEEEEELICIOUS.  I only had fig jam on hand, and substituted it for the apricot jam.  I will make this as directed, next time - as I'm sure it'll be even better.  Thank you for this great, easy, yummy recipe!

"Restaurant quality!" said my husband- This has become one of his favorite meals.  Olive oil makes this taste less heavy and broiling also works well..  Didn't have brown mustard so I used Dijon Mustard and the sauce was still fabulous.

We loved this dish...I'd give it 10 stars if I could.  My husband is not the biggest fish fan but fixed like this he would eat it every week without complaining.  Thanks for the great recipe!

good stuff! so, i battered coated created a bit of a mess, even with tongs. (but its all good, what a dish!) lightly pan fried for a second to get a nice little browness, and then baked for the remainder.
for the sauce however, i didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so i whipped up a orange marmalade, cayanne, and red pepper flake concoction. i loved it, boyfriend loved it and baby woke up hungry due to the smell! thanx for a good one!

This dish was awesome! My husband said it tasted like it came from a restaurant. I omitted the creole seasoning and just used paprika. I also did not use horseradish and I used honey mustard instead of brown. I also used whole wheat flour. Delicious!!

I love this recipe. My husband requests it.  I found that you can reduce the oil significantly and it still browns.  Also, to be careful when frying the fish because the coconut browns very quickly and will burn if you aren't careful.  I like to cover my pan while it's frying to help the fish cook more quickly.

This was very yummy and pretty quick to make.  My  whole family loved this and requested that I make it again often.  Would be a good meal to make for company.   Leftovers were wonderful and the sauce is really good and I will make that sauce for other meals too.

WE enjoyed this recipe.  It takes a bit long to cook the tilapia with the coconut coating, but it was worth the wait.  Also, I omited the horseradish because we don't like food to be too spicy and it was great.  The creole seasoning gave it just the right amount of "pizzaz" for us!
