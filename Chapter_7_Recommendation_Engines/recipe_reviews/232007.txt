Delicious! I shredded a 8 oz. block of cheddar instead of the American cheese , I did 1 can cream of chicken and 1can cream of mushroom. Then a 16oz. Bag of frozen broccoli, carrot and cauliflower. I used 1.4 pounds chicken to make 3 cups cooked! My kids loved this! The stuffing adds a good unique flavor to it! I will add a pic next time I make it. I forgot this time.

This was so delicious! My husband says "it's a keeper". I used cheddar cheese. I had frozen stir fry veggies and they were great! I couldn't figure out the size of stuffing box I needed, so I made 2 x 120 g boxes. (Canadian). My condensed mushroom soup was really thick so I added 1/2 a cup water to make it a spreading consistency. 
There was a perfect ratio of chicken, veggies, and stuffing. 
I baked for 45 minutes in my oven. Slight crust on top, juicy on the bottom.

I followed the recipe but it was runny and watery. Very little flavor, and I added some additional spices. I liked the crunch of the stuffing on top but the rest just wasnâ€™t up to par.

This was way, way better than I anticipated!  Come on - processed cheese slices??  However it was a Tuesday evening after a busy day and I didn't feel like cooking.  Had left over chicken from Saturday and needed to use it or waste it.  Just happened to also have the frozen vegetables, a stuffing mix  and  those cheese slices.  My picky grandson and his father devoured it.  I was lucky to get a serving for myself.  I will certainly use this recipe again.

Very easy to make. I baked the boneless skinless chicken breasts with kick'n chicken seasoning by Weber. I only had the garlic powder seasoning from the recipe but with the chicken already seasoned  it still had plenty of flavor.   I also did one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken.

Very nice recipe. Great flavor. Was somewhat dry. I used two cans of soup, one cream of mushroom and one cream of chicken, both were condensed. Maybe I should have added two cans of water or chicken stock also? The recipe wasn't clear about that. I'll try it that way next time.
