This is fabulously easy and quite a crowd pleaser! The paring of the salty bacon and sweet sugared onions is just perfect and plates beautifully. Thanks for sharing, this recipe has saved my "bacon"(naturally no pun intended), on several pop in guest occasions.

My husband told me this was a keeper after one bite. He said he definitely wants to see this for dinner again.
The sweet/salty/crunchy topping was delish!
Simple to make, too.
Next time I will flatten the chicken breasts out a bit to hold more of the yummy toppings.

I think this is probably in the top 10 recipes I've ever  made.  Cooked sliced up bacon in advance then used the same pan to cook chicken. Poured out some of the grease then added onions, sugar, bacon and diced mushrooms back into the pan. Topped all with combo of jack and cheddar. O.M.G!!

This recipe had the ingredients I had on hand and was a hit with me and hubby! I changed the order of cooking though... chopped up the bacon and fried it first, took the bacon out of grease, sat it aside and added the onions and cooked them til golden. Then took the onions out, sat aside and then cooked the chicken breast in remaining grease and there was just enough for the 2 chicken breasts. When chicken was just about done, piled on the onions, then the cheese and topped it with the chopped bacon. Covered for a few minutes, cheese melted with bacon bits mixed in. I also drizzled the top with some spicy honey mustard sauce. WONDERFUL...! We will definitely have this one again! And yes, I agree it might not be the healthly way to eat a chicken breast but you have to treat yourself once-in-awhile!

There is nothing more frustrating than reading reviews from people that totally change the recipe ingredients from the original recipes posted in here. You either like the recipe as it is or you don't so if you think your recipes are so much better then just send them in and see how many comments you will get........just saying!!

This was easy and really good. I will make it with pork tenderloin next time. I also added a can of sliced mushrooms to the sauce and onions and it was good!! I used Maple bacon instead of regular to make it even more sweet.

I should be horsewhipped for being too busy eating like a pig to rate or post a comment about recipes I love. But my darling Wifey raved about this Smothered Chicken so much tonight that I figured it would be a sin to not rate and comment on it. 

Fixed it just like the recipe except I used 3 flattened chicken breasts instead of 4. Used 1 very large fresh Vidalia onion, you could hardly have too many and I used sharp Cheddar cheese because that's what I had on hand. It was pretty easy and out of this world yummy. Texted a picture to our 2 girls in college just so they'd have an extra reason to come home to visit. Sure is great chicken!

I never log in to rate or review recipes, but I had to for this one - it was fantastic! One tip - I didn't use the whole onion because I'm not a huge onion fan... DON'T DO WHAT I DID! The caramelized onions are amazing and really pull the dish together.

When I made this, I was initially underwhelmed, but the leftovers the next day were great. I think it needed time for all the flavors to blend together. Next time, I'm going to try baking all the ingredients together in the oven, rather than cooking them separately on the stove. I think that will make it a more cohesive meal.

this was very good, but I did make some changes. I marinated the chicken in a homemade bbq sauce (basically a mixture of a few things I had in the fridge) then put them on a grill pan, browned them and popped them in the oven while I cooked the bacon, caramelized the onions, sauteed some mushrooms, whipped up some mashed potatoes and some steamed broccoli and carrots (which I sauteed after steaming with some red bell peppers and onions). I layered the bacon,onions, mushrooms & cheese on the chicken and broiled for a minute till the cheese was melted, then topped with some of the marinade mixed with some honey mustard (I had put some marinade to the side before pouring on chicken). this was enjoyed by all...Will make again, although it's definitely not the healthiest way to make chicken breasts...

My husband loved this, but then, who could resist bacon, cheese and carmelized onion with ANYTHING!?
I did add some fresh garlic, can't cook without it.
Definitely will be making this again, and loved the easy clean-up!

No kidding, this recipe is awesome! I too added mushrooms as some of the other reviewers did, and a bit of fresh garlic. We paired with roasted potatoes and green beans. LOVED THIS RECIPE...the bacon/onion/brown sugar combo was a delicious mix. We all raved and left nothing for tomorrow.

Since my wife, who is an Amazing cook, loved it, and I was able to get her out of kitchen and go sit and relax (which she's not too good at ??), I will make again. 
Instead of lemon pepper I used a homemade Montreal steak seasoning.  Plus at the end, when all things were assembled, I threw in 2 large handfuls of spinach to capture the essence remaining in the pan, and threw it on top. 
Very delicious!

This is a true five-star recipe:  it's quick, easy, doesn't require a lot of expensive ingredients, and is kind of a revelation in its own way.  You end up with this kind of sweet, smoky, salty, crunchy mass of goodness which (almost) everyone will love.

I recommend getting good bacon--I got some ends and pieces off of some killer stuff, and it worked fine.  Also, I brined the chicken breasts ahead of time and omitted the salt--seems to always end up better that way, imho.  I'd recommend slicing the onion really thin so you can get these kind of crispy amber candied onion strings.  Also, I used about half a cup of really packed (hard) brown sugar, and that was a wee bit too much.

Again, killer recipe--kudos to Brent BeSaw for sharing it!

I couldn't give it 5 star's because I didn't follow the instructions and made the following changes.  I did like others suggested and cooked in reverse. I also cut up my bacon prior to cooking,  then added my red onion when that was starting to get soft I added my brown sugar,  cooked for a couple minutes then added my mushrooms (we love mushrooms) cooked until well caramelized. Pulled and hold warm.  Added about a tablespoon of both butter & olive oil to fry my chicken. When it was almost done (about 5 minutes) I added back my bacon, onion and mushrooms. Just prior to plating topped we cheese, popped under broiler to melt cheese. P'S don't be shy with the lemon pepper!   Super yummy!!

Spectacular. It was a great hit for all who ate it. We had company over and I didn't want to spend all night in the kitchen, so I used this recipe. Truly easy and well worth the effort. One of the best recipes on this site.

This chicken was delicious! My Husband said it needed to be put in a Kaiser roll and it would be a perfect sandwich. Will surely make this recipe again...and buy some Kaiser rolls.

I was skeptic, brown sugar and onions this goes against the grain. who does this... a frigging genius that's who. I made this tonight and not only does it now go into dinner rotation but my husband moaned mmm with each bite. Thank you for sharing!!!! There are so many other possibilities for this... it doesn't have to stop at chicken. pork chops? Italian sausage? kudos to the chef :)

My husband took one bite and said it was the best chicken recipe he'd had in a while!  The onions came out perfectly sweet; I think they made the recipe.  I only changed the recipe by pressing chicken tenderloins into bread crumbs after seasoning.  Delicious!!

Superb recipe!  I went out to shovel the driveway while my seventeen year old daughter cooked a double batch of this one per the recipe, and it turned out Amazingly.  My wife doesn't eat chicken without rice and a side...until now!  I'd probably omit the salt and lemon-pepper in the future as they were overwhelmed by the bacon and later ingredients.

Loved this!  I used two skillets and cooked the chicken in one and the bacon in another to speed up the prep.  My husband loved it! Serve with corn on the cob.

I cooked the bacon first, poured out almost all the bacon fat, and cooked my chicken breasts in that. I also used a few tablespoons to caramelize the onion. Yum! I never use sugar to caramelize onions, caramelizing them brings out their inherent sweetness, not to mention we don't need all that extra sugar when I'm cooking in bacon fat! All in all this is a most delicious recipe and is definitely a keeper! Thank you!

I really liked this recipe. Excellent flavors, but I'm a sucker for caramelized onion. The only things I did differently were to use thighs (because that's what I had & I like the smaller portion sizes) and I made the bacon first, then caramelized the onion. I cooked the chicken in the pan with those flavors. Then I added the toppings still in the pan.

WARNING!!!!! I made this because it looked easy and my Fiance was at work. She now thinks I am a chef,  and for the foreseeable future cooking shall be mine. Biggest mistake ever. lol 

It's a super simple and great dish, works well with the red lobster biscuit mix/potatoes/veggies etc.

Delicious. Made as recipe states the first time.  It was good but needed a tweak.  The second try we skipped the lemon pepper & seasoned with salt, pepper & poultry seasoning.  We didn't like the whole piece of bacon on top so I chopped the bacon before browning. We tried different cheeses too.  Swiss & smoked provolone.  The provolone was the winner. We served it on a bed of brown rice & a side of green beans.  Love the addition of br sugar to set off those carmalized onions!  Next time we are gonna throw handful of dried cranberries in with the onions.  Yum, can't wait!

This was amazing! I followed the directions exactly,  but after I put it all together I stuck them in the oven on 350 until the cheese was melted. The brown sugar seems weird but it all comes together so good.

This rocked, super easy, though I did use 2 skillets and cooked the bacon while I cooked the chicken and made it go faster.  Would also flatten chicken before cooking or maybe butterfly them so the toppings stay on top better.  Used thick-cut applewood bacon.

Ohhhhh so good. I took the recommendation of others and flattened my chicken first to get them even. Chopped up the bacon and cooked it first, then cooked the chicken in the bacon grease, followed by the onion and sugar. Not the healthiest way, but worth it.

This was really good.  I made with 2 pounds of chicken.  The type of onion was not specified, so I used a medium sized yellow onion.  Next  time, I will double the amount of onion and use 2 medium/large yellow onions.  I cut my chicken breasts in half so that they would cook evenly without getting dry.   To cut down on the oil, I cooked the chicken in the oven. I also cut the bacon into  small pieces before  frying, as I find this gets it to crisp up nicer.   To get the cheese melted, I put the chicken on the bottom layer of a casserole dish, poured the onions on top,  then the bacon, and finally the cheese on top.  Cooked the whole thing on 400 for 5 minutes to melt the cheese.  I did have to substitute cheddar cheese since that was all I had.

This is great.  It is quick and easy and makes a nice presentation for guests.  I added some chicken stock, wine and a little bit of butter to the pan after everything was done cooking to use as a sauce over the chicken and mashed potatoes I had as a side dish and it was great.  This is sure to be something I'll make again in the future.

It was really good, quick and easy. If anything it's not the healthiest way to cook chicken, but it's a good occasional meal. The only change I made was to  cook the chicken last because I wanted to take full advantage of the flavour from the onions and bacon.

Excellent dish!  My prep time was a bit longer, as I had thicker breasts that I pounded thin and halved, but everything else was quick and easy.  I reserved a bit more bacon grease, and cut the brown sugar down a little, but I don't think it amounts to much difference.  The flavor was wonderful!  Thanks for sharing!

I was skeptical but it turned out wonderful.  My husband sez definitely a 5.  I added sauted mushrooms and some lemon juice and minced garlic.  Really, those were the only changes.  The bacon seemed to make this dish. Surprisingly.  Will definitely make this again.

I use precooked bacon slices and always have some bacon grease in my freezer so I change up the order of prep. I do the onions first and keep them warm while the chicken is cooking. It's quicker this way. The sauce is amazing, so I always double it so we can top our jasmine rice with it. It's one of the top five meals requested in our home.

Initially, I thought this recipe seemed a little strange but decided to try it based on the strong reviews and the fact that I had most of the ingredients on hand. The only changes I made were to use seasoned salt, as I didn't have any of the lemon seasoning and I put the onion mixture on the chicken before crumbling the bacon on top and then adding the cheese. I did put the cover on the pan to melt the cheese a bit. Delicious! My husband liked it so much that I swear he thought about licking his plate. Easy and delicious recipe.

The only thing I did differently was to brown the chicken very well, cook the onions with the brown sugar and I included sliced mushrooms. I also cooked the bacon really crispy and used pepper jack cheese. I put the chicken in a casserole dish, crossed the bacon on each piece, "smothered "with onion mixture,sprinkled w/cheese and baked
at 350 for 30 minutes. Delicious!

Delicious! The only tweaks I did was I didn't drain any of the bacon grease before caramelizing the onions, so I ended up with some bacon grease/brown sugar sauce on the bottom which added even more flavour. I also scooped the onions on top of the chicken then added the bacon before putting the cheese on top. Will absolutely make it again.

Loved the combination of flavors! Only things I changed were to let the chicken rest a few minutes, then sliced the breasts into 1/2" slices and  topped with the onions and bacon (which I also cut into smaller pieces). Presenting the dish with smaller pieces let the flavors really meld. Didn't have the right cheese, so sprinkled with a little blue cheese. Thinking I might like it with goat cheese.
Will definitely make this dish for a dinner party!

This turned out great, with a tweak and a suggestion. First, when using larger breasts like they sell at Costco, double the cooking time for the chicken. Plus I added the juices from the resting chicken to the cooking onions. I didn’t like the idea of whole bacon strips on top of the breasts, so I cut up the bacon after cooking and added it to the almost fully cooked onions. Then cut up the breasts, put them on a platter and then added the onion & bacon mixture on top. Finished that with the cheese, and it was a plate cleaner.

I substituted honey for the brown sugar, but stuck to the recipe otherwise. This is great and I would not mind serving it to dinner guests. The chicken remained moist since I used a covered skillet. We will add this to our regular recipe box cuz it's a keeper!

When we try a new recipe the first time,we always make it just as  listed in the recipe.  This one turned out great!   I may try a little garlic and perhaps a little more lemon pepper seasoning the next time, as we had a hard time finding the flavor through the sweetness of the carmalized onion.

This recipe was absolutely fantastic. It's more of a cheat day meal for my husband and I, but it is wonderful. The only "change " I made to this dish was not draining any of the bacon grease. I cooked the bacon, took it all out and just caramelized the onion and sugar in all it's bacony glory. I like my onions a bit charred, and it came out great. 10/10 will make again. It's more of a topping than a smother, but still yummy.

Incredible recipe!  I only used 1 strip of bacon for each serving and went VERY lightly on the cheese and was absolutely wowed by the wonderful taste of this chicken!  I will make this a go-to for guest dinners as well as a treat for my family. Thanks for this recipe!!

This is an excellent recipe. I cooked the chicken breasts in my cast iron and it was unbelievably moist. It reminded me of a place we used to eat a at in Missouri, where they served toombawhoomba chicken. The only thing I added was fresh mushrooms cooked in a little wine and butter. Will definitely be adding this to the menu.

Awesome.  Hit with hubby and kids.  Melted cheese over sweet onions and salty bacon and seasoned chicken.  Can't go wrong.  Easy enough for midweek meal and looks fancy enough to serve to to guests.

I made this last night for a family dinner. Everyone loved it!I didn't have lemon pepper seasoning so used a combination of lemon zest, salt and pepper. I also added mushrooms to the onions and brown sugar. Once everything was cooked I put the chicken in a casserole pan topping with the onion mix, bacon crumbles, and then the cheese. I placed it in the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese. Will definitely make again!

All Recipes to the rescue! My mother was recovering from emergency surgery with no appetite, and Dad was stressed to the max. I went through their food stuffs and put some of these ingredients into the All Recipes search filter. This sweet thing pops up. Sweet caramelized onions with salty bacon and cheese was a hit with my two picky elders. It's also super easy. They said they felt like they were eating in a restaurant. I served it with buttered green beans (from frozen) and rice, because that's what they had on hand.

I pan fried the chicken, baked my bacon (I always do this - it tastes better), used my bacon drippings with the brown sugar to caramelize the onions. After that I layered them as directed but I used sliced provolone cheese instead of shredded monterrey jack because that was all I had. Anyway, I stuck it back in the oven about 1.5 minutes to melt the cheese and that was that. I made some without the onions for my kids and they loved it. I think these would go great over some lightly toasted wheat bread, with light mayo, lettuce and tomato. Excellent recipe!

This was great, only thing I changed was the bacon concept. I cooked it then chopped it into bits instead of laying the whole piece on top. I also sprinkled the onions, bacon, then cheese on the chicken and broiled it for 2 minutes so the cheese was melted and kept all the toppings together. Everyone loved it

Loved it!  Made this for some friends.  I browned the chicken breasts and placed them in a 350 degree oven to finish while I fried the bacon and caramelized the onions.  I used a internal thermometer and when the chicken reached 155 , I put the toppings on and by the time the cheese was perfectly melted, the chicken was done.

My whole family REALLY liked this and want me to make it again soon. We don't always agree, so I was glad, since this is a very easy recipe! The only thing I did differently was to add shredded swiss and pepper jack cheese, since I didn't have enough Colby-Jack... Thanks for this one!

I am NOT a natural cook, but I am on vacation for 3 weeks and I wanted to make dinner for my boyfriend when he gets home from work each night. This is the first recipe I tried from AllRecipes.com and he loved it, as did I! I'm proud of myself, but also happy that AllRecipes has such amazing dishes out there with precise, clear instructions on how to make it in your own kitchen!

We really enjoyed this - the sweetness of the caramelized onions partnered with the chicken and bacon really well. I didn't have any Monterey Jack cheese so used old cheddar instead and it was great.  Definitely a keeper!

Keeper! I made extra "sauce", chopped up the bacon, added more brown sugar and bacon grease. Left out the cheese. This was delicious. Next time I would definitely add more onion since I used a small one. Everyone loved it and I will be making it again! Great recipe.

fantastic!  I didn't have colby cheese, so I used mozzarella instead and it was great.  I thought a whole onion sounded like too much so I used less and I was sorry because the toppings were so good!  better than plain old chicken breast for dinner.

This was very good and easy to make. I didn’t have lemon pepper seasoning so I substituted Penzey’s Seasoned Salt and Penzey’s Minced Lemon Pepper. I also crumbled the bacon. Loved the sweet and saltiness.

Great recipe. we make it often. The carmelized onion make this dish. 

As for people who review and change the recipe, I enjoy their comments. It is rarely that i make a recipe from here and not tweak it a bit. I have to make accommodations for a picky family and for what i have on hand.  Keep up the good work Allrecipes fam!

tasty and easy. I used turkey bacon, if I was a pork eater I think pork bacon would have been better. it especially good on day 2 after all the flavor from the caramelized juices set in.

This was fantastic!!  I had apple wood smoked bacon and vidalia onions.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was awesome!  The ONLY suggestion I will offer is to crumble the bacon on top of the chicken to make it easier to eat.  Definitely a DO OVER!!!

I didn't have any brown sugar, so I used honey instead. I did not saute in the bacon grease to save many calories and a lot of fat, too.  Rather, I wiped the pan with a paper towel for a second time, and sauted the onions and honey to a delicious brown. I made it a short time ahead, so I heated in the oven for 15 minutes at 350 to melt the cheese and blend the flavors  Delicious!I will make again...

This was a last second recipe choice and looked both easy to make and delicious; how could one go wrong with Pig Fat! 

I combined it's 'easy' ness with Chicken Tenders and used Sharp Cheddar instead of the Colby basically because that's the cheese I had... After adding in the Caramelized Brown Sugar Onions, it was, indeed, delicious and added to my favorites.

Great job, Brent

I always follow a recipe the first time them modify from there. I will make this again but probably sliced the bacon into pieces and fry it first. Save 2Tb of the grease for the onions and discard the rest. There’s enough grease coating the pan to fry the chicken. I’d also pound the breast so they are equal thickness. Use a big onion because it shrinks down a lot. You could use any kind of cheese, my next serving will have Swiss cheese on it. It was very good just hard to eat with the full strips of bacon.

This was very good, however, I reversed the order of preparing.  I  fried the bacon first so it could cool down instead of the chicken. Then I fried the chicken in the bacon grease for the alloted time. Then I  added a tad of butter to the pan and sauteed the onions and brown sugar.  I broke the bacon into bits as it is easier to eat that way.  After I put on the cheese, I put it in the broiler for 2 min to melt.  It was perfect.  Next time I will use less br sugar.

This is super easy to get together.  I didn't use the lemon pepper seasonings,  I used tapatio instead.  Also used sharp cheddar because I didn't feel like running to the store.  Next time I make this I will definitely turn them into sandwiches.  It would be really good with a grilled brioche and your favorite mayo or dressing.

I already had some cooked bacon, so I broke it up in pieces, and when I was done caramelizing the onions, I threw the bacon pieces in to warm them up. It was an awesome meal!! Tasted very good and will make it again.

I made it last night and was a little skeptical about the brown sugar, but it came out perfect! My husband is the chef in the family so he was guiding me through it. We also made roasted potatoes and zucchini and squash with it that seemed to compliment the dish well. My husband couldn't stop saying, "oh my God!" lol.

I was so looking forward to this recipe.  I made the recipe just as it was written.
Be very careful of adding too much brown sugar  into the onions.  It was overwhelming!!!
I will try this again, but with just a pinch of the brown sugar.

This is a keeper! I made it as is, but I had different cheeses that we each chose from - pepper jack, asiago, sharp cheddar and colby jack. I always cook my bacon in the oven at 350* - it keeps down the mess and can cook at the same time as other foods. Before the chicken was completely cooked, I added the onions and sugar in the middle of the pan and put the lid on my skillet to finish cooking everything. We all really enjoyed this - thank you!

This was pretty good, I did as others suggested fried bacon then cooked chicken in it and then cooked onions after I didn’t put as much brown sugar as it called for i just sprinkled a tiny bit over onions I didn’t want it as sweet. It was pretty good!

Cut the onions smaller and added 1 TBSP of brown sugar rather than a 1/2 cup. Trimmed and halved chicken breasts. Melted cheese in oven broiler for 2.5 minutes on low. Delicious!!

Delicious! I started with carmelizing the onions and then added some mushrooms as other reviewers had suggested, then added a couple tablespoons of brown sugar. Then I added some poached chicken breasts I had on hand that I sliced up along with some bacon I already had cooked up, sprinkled with cheese, and let it all warm up. Husband gave the thumbs up and it was quick because of the ingredients I had pre-prepared.

Great recipe! I added garlic along with the onion. I substituted lemon pepper for garlic powder (b/c I was out if lemon pepper ??) and a dash of poultry seasoning and something extra for some kick. Served it over mixed spinach salad and sauteed green beans on the side. My husband LOVED it!! Will definitely do it again. Thanks for sharing!!

I thought this was very good and super easy for after work.  It was like a sweet and salty dish....very tasty.  I pretty much followed the recipe.. bacon was done in the microwave so I used butter for the onions and brown sugar as well as doing it in the pan I fried the chicken in.

This is awesome! Did a few things different: I did the bacon in the oven and saved the grease. I then used the grease for the chicken and just browned it, I didn’t cook it the whole way through, but instead put it in the oven to finish cooking (350 for about 22 minutes). I also cooked the onions really slow and low (about an out on low, stirring often). It turned out AMAZING.

This is absolutely fantastic and easy to make! I did cook the bacon and then the onions in one pan while cooking the chicken in another to save some time. Also, I seasoned the chicken with minced garlic, salt, and pepper instead of the lemon stuff and topped it with shredded mozzarella instead of cheddar. Restaurant quality flavor!

I made this basically as it reads other than I cut the bacon up - and I had no lemon pepper so I just used sea salt and black pepper tiny touch of garlic - I was really hesitant on the brown sugar in the onions was nervous it would be super sweet but I did it.  I put the onions then bacon and cheese on each chicken breast and left in the pan covered until the cheese melted.  My husband and Dad are super picky and its always hard to come up with good recipes so I give it 4 stars because 1. no on said they did not like it 2. they almost cleaned their plates.  I thought it was very tasty not too sweet either - my husband said he liked you could taste every item and it was good together.  It would have gotten a 5 star if they both would have cleaned their plates LOL.

Holy cow, this was delicious.  I followed someone’s advice, cooked the bacon first, removed it, fried the onions and brown sugar (and added mushrooms), then removed that and added the chicken.  This part made it smell like I was burning down the house.  As the chicken cooked, the browned sugar started to burn and smoke, so I threw the chicken into the oven at 350 to finish it.  I then added all the toppings and threw it back in the oven to melt. It was so good...

i thought this was very good and I will make it again. I did however crumble the bacon and instead of using brown sugar I used honey(because I'm a beekeeper), as soon as the onions we're almost finished.

Yum! I even used precrumbled bacon from Costco (because I hate frying bacon) and cooked it with the onion. Then I fried the chicken in the bacon grease. Delicious!

Was a big hit. I did cook the bacon in the oven while the chicken was cooking to save time. I then shut the oven off and added the chicken to the sheet pan the bacon was cook on to keep warm while the onions cooked.

This was the best chicken breast I've ever had. The only thing I did different was that, after cooking the bacon and onions, I returned everything to one pan and put the cheese on top. I let everything cook a little longer on low until the cheese melted. It was delicious!

Was in a huge hurry making this so I forgot the lemon pepper, salt, and cheese.  But it was still awesome! I did follow other reviewers who cooked the bacon first, so maybe that was enough seasoning for the chicken. I’ll make this again soon, and next time I’ll follow the recipe better!

Made this with the ingredient search last night.  My original dinner planned didn't work out My 18 year old son said OMG that is delicious.  I took another reviewers suggestion and added mushrooms.  I also cut the sugar to about 2 T and crumbled the bacon on top rather than whole pieces.  So easy and so good!

The only change I made was to add some Brussels sprout halves that I had left over from another recipe.  My family loved it, even my 6 year old granddaughter who doesn't like much meat and my 12 year old grandson liked the Brussels sprouts (probably because the brown sugar made them a little sweet).  I will definitely make this again.

I cooked the bacon in a cast iron pan, when it was done, I carmelized the onions in the bacon grease. Removed the onions to a pan and added brown sugar while browning the chicken in the bacon grease plus  I added a little vegetable oil. My husband said the assembled chicken looked like something you get in a restaurant. It was also very tasty!

Made as is but way too few onions. There will be a next time as flavors there but will use at least one maybe more onion per breast- probably more. The chicken was good with the lemon pepper.  This recipe has absolute potential to be five stars. I will add garlic powder and way more onions. Sure to be five stars. Thank you for the base recipe

very easy, very good. I used some bacon I had leftover from another recipe, so I used butter to caramelize the onion instead of bacon grease but it was still great.

My family loved this! I did do it  backgrounds (starting with the bacon) and used bacon pieces cooked in butter, but it was still amazing. The bacon pieces were probably easier than whole bacon anyway. I might try adding some pepper jack for some extra spice next time.

This was great. I altered it only to use just one pan all at once. Cooked the bacon first, then the onions and brown sugar in the drippings. After they caramelized a bit, I threw the chicken in the pan with them (I also cut the chicken into bite sized pieces before cooking). I didn't have Colby Monterey Jack, so I used what I had - truffle cheddar from Trader Joe's. It worked well and melted nicely. This worked really well using my cast iron pan.

So good just as written. I wouldn't change it at all. It also tastes great as leftovers the next day. The onions were to die for!!

I made it exactly as recipe says but I used a 4 cheese blend, as I didn't have the Monterey Jack on hand.  The hubby couldn't stop talking about it.  Also, saying it would be a perfect camping meal as we usually take all the ingredients anyway.  The carmelized onions were the perfect addition.

Delicious! The combination of the sweet, salty and savoury tastes was pleasantly different and tantalized my taste buds. I made a few changes  though. I didn't have lemon pepper, so I used Italian seasoning, a dash off lime juice and black pepper instead. I also used white cheddar cheese.

Loved it! I'm on a low carb diet so I used only 1 T of splenda brown sugar, and I doubled the the recipe,l. So only 1T for 2 whole onions..  It was plenty sweet,  and the flavor combination was delicious.

We loved it! Very close to Outbacks Alice Springs Chicken. Here are the steps I took: 1. Did chicken as said. Meanwhile, I put a piece of foil, sprayed with cooking spray, and put in a 13x9.  2. Chicken on med-high for 7 min. Each side. 3. When done, placed in 13x9 and in oven at 250.  4. Cooked bacon as said. When done draining grease, placed on top of chicken and back in oven. 5. Cooked onions as said. 6. When onions were done, took out chicken, put on cheese and then onions- then more cheese. 7. Back in oven for 1/2 hour to melt cheese and make sure it was warm enough to eat! Fantastic!

Five stars for ease and taste.  I cannot imagine why I never thought to make this before seeing this recipe.  It is simple and the flavors really complement each other.  I actually made it all in one pot, omitted the cheese, and served on mashed potatoes.  Everyone loved it.

You can never go wrong with bacon. I accidentally doubled the sugar, which made the onions sooo sweet. I didn't mind it though. Served it with some whipped potatoes. Yum!

I seared the chicken then put it in the oven to finish cooking, left of the cheese and added mushrooms. I also added some lemon juice (to keep my chicken moist) then some worchestershire sauce to my onions. I don't know who ate more my husband,myself or my one year old!!! Saving this one for sure!

 I was skeptical with the ingredients but was thrilled with how it tasted... I like a little hot kick so next time I'll add some red pepper flakes.  Thank you!!

BANGING!!!!!!  I did 2 things to alter it:
1) I cut down on the brown sugar though, I only used not even 2 Tbsp. (didn't want it to be sweet). And it was perfect!!!
2) I did not use any salt.
I will make this again, and again, and again, and again....

Way too much salt, eliminate the added salt, change lemon pepper to pepper and lemon juice. Bacon has to stay because the flavor makes this a 5 star flavored way to prepare chicken breast. I did add mushrooms and will make again but need to cut back on the salt so much I only gave it 4 stars.

It was a delicious meal. My family really loved it. I added sauteed shrimp to mines because my kids really love seafood. The flavors from the bacon and caramelized onion were wonderful together will make this meal again.

This was outstanding.  After 1 bite, hubby said I can make this again.  The only addition I added was slice Portabella mushrooms.  I also changed the cooking order.  I cooked the bacon first, then the onions using rendered fat from the bacon, then the mushrooms and then chicken last.  I was a little leery of the brown sugar with the onions but, OMG, I couldn't stop eating them after I got done cooking them.  Thankfully I used a big onion.  LOL

I agree with another reviewer who said there were too many flavors going on at once. The lemon pepper does not go well at all with the sweet onions and cheese. Won't be making this again.

My wife gobbled this one up quickly. She didn't even want it topped with any cheese since the flavours were perfect as they were. Will have this again one day. Nice and simple meal.

My husband liked this more than I did. I cut down on brown sugar but still found onions too sweet. Bacon was a bit overpowering. I sautéed bacon and onions first, then sautéed breasts which I had pounded to about 1/2” thick. When I flipped chicken, I topped with bacon, onions and cheese. All was nicely warmed and cheese melted. Good but not great. My husband would have given it 4 1/2 stars.

This is amazing recipe. Very easy, fast and not that messy at all. I used red onion for this recipe and it looked amazing with the color and the taste was delicious! I have made this at least 3 times already!

Made this tonight and HAD to write a review!  First was hesitant when I saw brown Sugar but thought it was an interesting idea.  I had bacon left over from the weekend and saved grease so made prep easier: I chopped the bacon into bits for easier eating.  Also: I know people seem to get mad on here for “altering” recipes but honestly reviews have good advice, esp when short on stock, dietary alterations, or preference. I prefer garlic on meat, so that being said, I added garlic powder and some onion powder to chicken breasts. Then sprinkled on lemon pepper seasoning. It includes salt so did not add extra salt.   After chicken I added onions to the same pan with 3 tablespoons bacon grease 2 medium onions and 1/4+1/8 brown sugar (goal was to make more onions per 1 review plus I had more servings to fi). I fed 6 picky teens who “hate onions” and may have picked some out but They all LOVED the dish!  Served with garlic mash potatoes and green veggie.  So mostly prepare as written... add xtra seasonings at your taste level.. and enjoy! Great recipe!!!

So good it should be illegal. There were just 2 of us so I halved the recipe, but used the entire 1/4 cup of brown sugar, to give the onions extra sweetness. Also I threw it under a broiler for a couple minutes to melt the cheese. Otherwise, the recipe is perfect as is.

Not the healthiest dish I've made, but knew the whole family would love it and we did!  I cooked everything in a cast iron skillet beginning with the bacon, then drained it on a paper towel, then chicken, drained on paper towel, then onions and brown sugar.  After all were cooked, I stacked the chicken, bacon and onions in the skillet and topped with the cheese and put under the broiler to melt for a couple minutes.  I made a side of steamed broccoli and asparagus, but we all decided later that it was best warmed and coated in the pan with all the drippings!  Easy clean up too.

The recipe as written is very good.  We went for the crumbled bacon.  The onions were excellent, but next time I'll make more (personal preference), and cheese slices rather than shredded.  It is good enough for my two men to allow me to put it into the rotation of chicken breast meals.  Thank you Brent for the recipe.

Fantastic! Everyone raved over this dish and still talks about it! I'm thinking I could also make this casserole style by layering the items in order and cooking it until the cheese melts. This dish as listed is perfection.

Love this recipe. Even my finicky husband likes it. The only compromise I made for the kids is eliminating the lemon pepper. I also crumble the bacon a bit before I put it on the chicken.  Seems to make getting a bite of chicken, onion and bacon easier.

Soooo good! The only thing I did differently was cook the bacon first, then the onions, and then the chicken with some of the reserved bacon grease. I think next time I will slice another onion because they are so good. This is a keeper. Thank you!

Too many flavors all in one. Edible but not a keeper. Cheese wasn't an enjoyable addition, it just didn't seem to go with the recipe and the family usually likes anything with cheese. Lemon pepper lacked enough flavor to balance out the others.

01.18.17 ~ What a great dish! We liked everything about this dish, the ease of preparation and execution made it a good week night dinner. We thought the flavors blended well and DH loved the leftovers for lunch the following day. My changes were to only use a little bit of cheese and deer bacon. A meal worthy of repeating.

Hubbs LOVED it, and said so several times.  So nice to hear.  

Substituted jerk seasoning and a pinch of celery salt  along with a dash of lemon juice and black pepper b/c I didn't have lemon pepper on hand.  

I will chop the onions rather than slice them next time.  The rings were a bit unruly.

Used no cheese or sugar, instead added mushrooms and zest from one lemon,  Made it all in one large pan in this order: crisped bacon, caramelized onions, browned chicken, added sliced shrooms, lemon zest, cracked black pepper, added the cut up pre-made bacon, and covered pan. This made the brown sauce.  Next time will add a mashed garlic clove.  Goes great over mashed potatoes.

Very good! I did make it in reverse order, as others suggested. I prepared the bacon and onion first, kept it warm,then prepared the chicken. I melted the cheese under the broiler. Yummy!!

This was so good and I don't like onions. The brown sugar sauce was the star. Rave reviews by whole family.

I must admit, prior to make this I was rather concerned about how well these flavors would go together. Oh my goodness! It was absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe buthat used 2 onions instead of 1 because it was so small. Super simple to make, and absolutely delicious! This would be a beautiful and delicious dish to serve to company or a nice get-together.

This was delicious! I made minor changes to the seasoning. I used 1 tsp. kosher salt instead of 1/4 tsp.  I omitted the lemon pepper because I didn't have any. I used 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and 1/2 tsp. black pepper. This turned out perfectly and I've been making it once a week.

The flavors in this went together so well. The only addition I made was mushrooms, because I add mushrooms to everything. The brown sugar in the onions was awesome. I usually add white sugar just to sweet up onions after I sautéed them but the brown sugar was something else. It looked really pretty plated with all the different components. Was very quick and easy to make. This recipe is a keeper.

Yes I will make again. Only change I made was I cooked the bacon ahead of time and saved the bacon drippings. I used the drippings to cook the chicken instead of oil. It was wonderful

A recipe I actually essentially did not change! The only thing I did was mix pepper jack and medium cheddar for the cheese.  I probably used more cheese than the recipe called for, too. But that's just cause we love cheese. The chicken breasts turned out really moist and had great flavor!

This was delicious. I was halving the recipe but forgot to halve the bacon drippings so I added a couple of sliced mushrooms and when there was a lot of yummy looking crust on the bottom of the pan I added a little cream which made a delicious sauce.

Great mix of flavors. Cooked the chicken in a little of the bacon grease. Sauteed some mushrooms to go with it. When carmelizing the onion, I added sliced red bell pepper. Yum!!

I made this last night and it was absolutely delicious! I did make some modifications. I used Trader Joe's Everday seasoning and onion powder. Instead of 8 pieces of bacon I used 4 and cut them in half. Once the onions were done I put the breasts back in the pan, put the bacon and onions on top of them, turned the flame down very low, covered it and let it cook for another 10 minutes. I then turned the flame off, added a little pepper jack cheese on top and recovered the pan for about five minutes. The breasts were flavorful, tender and moist. 
A definite keeper!

This is awesome!  I gave it a four because it has you fry the chicken.  I pounded out  boneless, skinless breasts, grilled them, placed the fried bacon on them,  then poured cooked mixture of brown sugar and onions, sprinkled cheese, then baked for about 10  mins. to melt cheese. I will be making this again.  My husband also loved it!

Quick and delicious! I used chicken breasts from Costco, so because of their thickness I filleted them in half. I fried the chicken in the bacon grease like someone suggested, but I also covered it lightly with foil for part of the time to aid in heat retention.
Next time I might use a separate pan to carmelize the onions and not have to wait for the chicken to be done.
My husband and I loved the flavor and the chicken was tender and moist.  The leftovers would be great in a salad!

02/02/17:  DeWayne loved!!  Used 5 chicken breasts and 3 bell peppers in place of onions. Sprinkled seasoning right on top of chicken while cooking in pan, used the above amount on each side. Presentation is beautiful!!

Quick easy and yummy as is but   I am trying  this in a crock pot for tonight's  dinner.  I am doing it on low for 8 hours I'll  add the cheese when there's  an hour left.  After I thin slice my onions i poured the bacon grease and brown sugar on it  in a bowl and just mixed it together.  Then  layered it over the seasoned chicken breast with bacon on top.   I love having dinner waiting when I get home and tonight will be late cause I got errands after work.  I can't wait to get home.

After reading reviews, I had to try this and we loved it!  Not a piece left!  I did cut back on the brown sugar, crumbled the bacon into the onions, and put the chicken back in the pan with the onion mix to reheat before I scooped the yummy goodness on top and adding the shredded cheese.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  I will definitely be making this regularly.

If I could, I would give this more than five stars, it is that good! The combination of salty, sweet and gooey puts this over the top. I used chicken tenders for ease of cooking. I did the bacon first, then cooked the onions and brown sugar in the bacon drippings, took them out and cooked the chicken in the same pan to pick up more flavour. I used an oven-safe skillet so I could pop the whole thing in under broil to melt the cheese. Served with mashed potatoes for a delicious Sunday dinner. Thanks for sharing this!

I didn't cook any bacon with mine. Once chicken done, put on plate. Add onions and brown sugar. I added a splash of chicken broth and some of the juices that was on the chicken plate that had settled, sort of boiled it and added about a 1/2-1 tablespoon of flour. Add chicken and let simmer to warm chicken up and until my other sides where done, to keep it warm. Delicious.

This was super! The only change I made was to cook the bacon first, then cook the chicken in the bacon grease and skip the veg oil. Served with a roasted acorn squash for a side dish, and the flavors worked really well together. My fiance actually RACED back to the kitchen to get seconds.

I made this with the ingredients that were listed minus the cheese and  I used precooked bacon pieces from Costco..  It is an easy weekday dinner for the family.  I served it over ziti noodles and the family begged for me to make it again.  The 2nd time I added a little chicken stock for "gravy".  This is definitely a keeper

Loved this dish. It was very sweet with the brown sugar added. Only problem I had was after dinner, my husband and I went for a short walk. Came home to a hard stuck on plate from the brown sugar. Lesson learned...if you make this dish, clean the dishes immediately.

Delicious and as easy as they claim! I used barbecue seasoning instead of lemon pepper and kept everything else  the same. I'd suggest doubling the onions, as everyone gobbled them up!  Super weeknight dish.

Made this last night for my husband and daughter and they absolutely loved it!  Fast and easy with great flavor.  I substituted some honey for the brown sugar and it was fantastic.  My husband says it is better than his usual dish at Texas Roadhouse that is similar but "not as good"...his words exactly!  Definitely try this one, you won't be disappointed.

I've made this 3 times and everyone has loved it! I love the sweet and salty factor! I understand people's frustrations when reviews are left and they make changes. I am just like those cooks and I personally enjoy reading variations. But personally I've made this one just like the recipe because we love it just the way it is!

I made this recipe for lunch today and my entire family loved it!  This fast, easy recipe will definitely go in my monthly rotation.  To make it a bit healthier, here are the modifications I made:  I flattened the chicken breasts for faster, even cooking and then seasoned both sides with lemon-pepper.  I didn't measure it - just used a light sprinkle on both sides.  I omitted the salt, oil and bacon drippings.  I fried the bacon first and then poured out the drippings.  Using just what remained in the pan, I browned the chicken on both sides and then placed it to an oven-safe dish, covered it with foil and put in a 350 degree oven while I finished the recipe.  I added the onions and 2 T. brown sugar (half what is called for) to the skillet, along with 1/4 c. water to   steam off the stuck on bits and add that flavor to the dish.  Once the onions were caramelized, I crumbled the bacon and stirred it into the onions.  I then added the chicken back to the skillet, piled the onion mixture evenly on top of the chicken, sprinkled the cheese over the top and covered until the cheese melted.  YUMMY!

I found this recipe a few weeks ago - when searching for some new meal ideas.   I was skeptical about the various flavor combinations but decided to try it anyway based on the other reviews of it.   I was pleasantly  This is a KEEPER!  My family loves it!  It's a super easy recipe to follow.  Besides being a quick meal to throw together  on the stove top (bonus in the hot summer months when you prefer not to turn the oven on) all the ingredients are staples in the house - so perfect for the last minute dinner decision.  I typically chop the bacon up before putting it on the chicken. (Just because i think its easier to deal with when cutting the chicken it up at dinner). And i used sliced instead of shredded cheese when possible  (again just easier)   I have also used Swiss cheese on this and love it.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was a winner! I followed some suggestions and used more lemon pepper, used less brown sugar in onions, broke up bacon, and put in oven to melt the cheese. it will certainly be added to dinner rotation!

I did like this recipe, but found I needed a bit more cheese than the recipe called for, luckily easy fix!! Just add cheese to your hearts desire :)
However, when it came time to sauté the onions I found it was just a bit too sweet for me. So next time, I'd probably use half the amount of brown sugar next time, but it was yummy! So there definitely will be a next time :)

Tried to cut recipe in half as I had 2 pretty good sized chicken breasts.  Would be lighter on the lemon pepper seasoning next time but Hubby said it was a keeper and I liked it too.  The flavors enhance the chicken. Try it, at least, once. We will make again.

I was worried that the chicken would be dry  but it stayed very moist. I put it in a Pyrex dish and covered it with foil while I cooked the onions. I also used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon.  Will definitely make again thank you

This was an easy and quick meal. We had run out of lemon pepper so I used black and I substituted cheddar cheese instead of Monterey Jack. It was very tasty with rice and veggies. I would use the Monterey Jack next time and will get some lemon pepper.

Great recipe, very easy to make. I cooked the bacon in a seperate pan while also cooking the chicken,  so shortened the cook time. Fresh sliced avacado on top added color and flare! side of roasted corn and pasta shells rounded this out nicely.

I made changes and am not sure how to rate this. I added a sweet white wine to the Brown sugar mixture. I also added Zoodles into the pan. We were licking our fingers and lips when the meal was finished. Repeating this again for sure.

Delicious! I put it together in a 9x13 baking pan and baked it for 5 minutes at 350°F to melt the cheese. My family loved it! We paired it with a salad.

This was a great hit with family. My side dishes were Spanish rice and refried beans. I turned it into a Mexican dish I guess? I bought the white melting cheese at grocery store and drizzled some on side dishes and everyone went nuts for this dinner.

yes! yes! yes! This was really good. I did leave the cheese off however. The bacon and onions combined with the chicken and lemon pepper seasoning was really nice in the mouth and the tummy! I definitely recommend this recipe

This recipe is wonderful!  Both my 5 year old son and my husband asked me to PLEASE cook it again soon. I made one change - I baked the chicken while I cooked the onions & bacon to reduce time and calorie count.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to increase the seasoning on the chicken.  If you get a bite without onions/bacon/cheese, it's a little bland.

Very delicious. My boyfriend is a personal trainer so he's a healthy eater and said this was on point. I didn't add the cheese though. Other than that, I followed the recipe. We've had it 3 times in a week already. :-)

Delicious!  I cut my chicken breast in half long ways so they wouldn't be so thick.  Only change I made was I added fresh sliced sauteed mushrooms on top of the onions.  Bacon, onions, mushrooms and cheese!  Served with herb and butter flavored rice and green bean casserole.  YUM!  Hubby said "outstanding meal"!  I will most definitely be making this often.

Husband raved about this, kiddo liked the chicken plain and said the onions were "too sweet"... go figure.  I did it out of order, cooking the bacon first, the onions second, and then the chicken last.  I don't know if my instant read thermometer if off, but even after 20 minutes and several flips, it was saying nowhere near 165 - but I pulled it anyway.  (I can't eat dry chicken breast.)  It turned out nice and moist.  I might actually throw in an extra half an onion next time, since they were wonderful on top of the chicken, and possibly cut down the sugar a bit for my daughter.  Served it with oven roasted red potatoes (done with the onion soup mix/oil).  Really good meal!

This recipe was quick and simple, delicious and everyone loved it! This will be made again! I was weird it by the lemon pepper seasoning added but it was so good! I did fry the bacon first, poured off some of the fat renderings and then wilted the onion added the brown sugar and added one/two tablespoons of butter. Then I cooked the chicken slightly. Topped the chicken and finished it in the oven. It was worth making again and again! PS: My husband doesn't eat cheese so I left it off and he loved it!

Delicious!  After reading some of the reviews, I decided to combine a couple of the reviewers (CindyLou and KitchenMom)'s cooking methods and added a few tweets of my own. I cooked my bacon earlier that morning and refrigerated it and the fat, then at dinner  time,  I used that fat to fry up the onions , mushrooms and added the sugar once they were partly cooked. Once cooked, set them aside.  I then cooked the chicken and once fully cooked, topped first  with bacon, then  the caramelized onion  and mushroom mixture,  and finally sprinkled with cheeses and covered to melt cheese and voila!  Easy Peasy! Will make again, thanks for sharing!

Fabulous!  This is now my sons favorite chicken dish.  The only thing I did differently was at the end, after putting the cheese on top I put it in the oven for a few minutes so it would melt.  I don't happen to like onions, and I loved them in this dish!!

It really didn't need the sugar.I had to rinse my onions off. Other than that it wasn't to bad. And I did follow the recipe.

Yum! Made tonight with the following minor adjustments: added 2 cups sliced mushrooms  sauteed in olive oil, sprinkled with additional salt and pepper when assembled as it needed a little more flavor and finished cooking in oven at 400 for 5-10 minutes until bacon warmed (cooked bacon a few days before) and cheese melted. My husband I both thought it could use more caramelized onions as they were so tasty and not enough.

This was amazing.  Make as-is.  For a healthier version, you could consider turkey bacon, but then you'd have to add some oil or butter to cook the onions in.  YUM.

This was a really good recipe. I used sharp cheddar instead of Colby-jack as a personal preference. I didn't use as much brown sugar to carmalize the onions; I just cooked them a little longer until they began to carmalize with the drippings and what little sugar I used. I wound up making a sweet/tangy bbq sauce and put it on the side for dipping. The flavor of the bacon/onion/cheese and chicken with the sweet/tangy bbq sauce was perfect.  Served with steamed veggies and baked sweet potatoes, it was a very nice meal.

I made it according to directions except that I increased the onions to 1 1/2.  I think the onions would be too sweet if I had not increased them. I also used thick cut apple wood bacon.  My husband loved it!

Outstanding! Used beef stock instead of water and added minced garlic with onions.  Added corn and peas at the end.  The wine and stock added depth and super good.

I cooked the bacon and then chopped it so it was easier to chew as I was making it for someone that has issues with  that. I worked very well. I also used pepper jack on some of the pieces and it was delicious.

My husband and son went nuts over this recipe!!
Fast, easy and ingredients you already have in your kitchen, or easy to substitute.  I didn't have any lemon pepper, so used Mrs. Dash and replaced cheese with mexican -blend.  Plus, it looks beautiful plated!!  Will definitely be making again!

This was soooo  delicious!  The only thing I did was dredge the chicken in salt, pepper and flour before putting it in the pan to cook.  I didn't have any of the lemon pepper.  I also added garlic to the onions and brown sugar.  I am so excited for the leftovers!!!!

Excellent! Salty bacon with sweet caramelized onions and mushrooms can't go wrong with that! Tried it with pepper jack cheese and that was good as well. I will say that the lemon pepper seasoning seems to be out of place so going to try it with a berbere and brown sugar rub next time.

I only had thin sliced chicken breast and used that.  I made a little extra onion mixture and layered some between the thin sliced chicken breasts.  Covered it all with the remaining onion mixture and topped with the cheese.  Other than that I followed the recipe pretty much to a T.  The wife raved about it, I thought  it was good but was missing something.  Maybe some cayenne next time!

Use cooking spray to cut down on fat and calories.
Use 2% cheese to reduce the amount of fat and calories
Use bacon bits instead of 2 slices to cut down on fat and calories.

I followed the recipe as written for this  simple yet tasty recipe.  I did take another reader's suggestion for 'assembling' the  ingredients...I cooked the bacon first, then the onions, then the chicken.  After the chicken was cooked, I put the bacon/cheese/onions on top of the chicken while still in the pan.  When the cheese melted,  I put the chicken on the plates.   I will be making this again.

OMG this is amazing!  Definitely going into our top favorite recipes!  The combo of the slightly sweet sauce, caramelized onions, cheese, and bacon make the perfect combo!  I only used 3 med. chicken breasts and 4 slices of bacon to the recipe and it was the perfect amount.  Also I flipped flopped the recipe and made the bacon first, cooked the chicken, set aside, then added in the reserved bacon grease to cook the onions and finish it off by adding everything back in at the end with a lid on top to melt the cheese.  These would be great to serve with a light pasta and a salad on the side to have the perfect meal.  Thank you so much for this delicious recipe! It is a favorite!

Should've used ready bacon to save time. Plus next time I won't add brown sugar.

Made this for dinner tonight.  It's a new family favorite!  I followed recipe exactly as written except I didn't have lemon pepper.  I also added mushrooms and tried pepper Jack cheese on a couple of the chicken pieces.  Sooooo delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for dinner on Sunday and it was amazing! I'll be honest I was a little skeptical of making this because I didn't think it would have a lot of flavor but I decided to at least give it a try and I am so glad I did! 
The only thing I did differently to this recipe was I cooked the bacon first, saved the bacon grease, cooked the chicken, and then I caramelized the brown sugar and onion and added everything together and it was so delicious...I'll definitely be making this again!

Absolutely delicious!! I followed the recipe but changed the order of the cooking. First I cooked the bacon, then caramelized the onions in the bacon grease, then sautéed mushrooms with about three cloves of fresh garlic. Put all that aside, cooked chicken breast in the leftover drippings. Topped the chicken off with bacon slices, caramelized onions and shredded Colby Jack cheese. The sweetness from the onions and saltiness from the bacon mesh so well together!! Husband and four year old LOVED it! Had a side of roasted carrots and wild rice. Will definitely be on the menu more often!

I made the recipe exactly as written.  Hubby loved it and wants it again.  However, we both decided that chicken breast tenders would be best next time so that you get a mingling of flavors in your mouth all at once.  My husband thought there was just too much chicken and not enough of the other things.

OMG!! This is so good. I did change it up a touch because I was busy. I didn't completely cook the chicken breasts, just browned them. Into a casserole dish covered with the cooked bacon, onions, and brown sugar. I put it, covered, in the oven at 400 for half an hour then shut the oven off, added the cheese, and let it sit, covered, for 10 mins to let the cheese melt.  So tender, juicy, and tasty. My fussy family gave it a thumbs up too.

this was quite good.  It was quite easy to prepare and very tasty,  and like one reviewer said would make a great sandwich.  next time I might try  putting pancetta instead of bacon on.

Simple and fast, I substituted a half cup of Coke for the brown sugar,  I think it gives it a better depth of flavor. Served open faced on a buttered toasted baguette.

This is a great recipe. I only changed it up slightly as I didn't have lemon pepper seasoning but used a garlic herb blend instead. I pan-seared the chicken until nicely browned on top and bottom and then put the breasts in the oven at 375 degrees.  While the chicken baked, I cooked the bacon and then the sweetened onions. This worked well as I was then able to put the bacon on top of the chicken followed by the grated cheese while in the oven a few minutes before serving time which resulted in a crisp overall topping. The brown-sugared onions finished up the dish. Outstanding flavors and easy to prepare. I would not hesitate to serve this one to guests as I know it would receive rave reviews.

Excellent recipe. Pounded chicken first. Had some bacon already cooked and crumbled so I added to onions and brown sugar. Cooked in cast iron skillet so I could finish it in the oven with aged cheddar. Maybe next time would try adding chopped apples, dried cranberries and nuts to the onion bacon mixture.

I liked it, did not love it. However, my teenager and husband LOVED it! They said it was the kind of dish they could eat twice a week. As a result, I am adding this recipe to the monthly circulation. They are suggesting I make it for our next family get-together to get additional reviews. hahaha
I served it with green rice and it plated very beautifully.

I made this for an Irish friend and he said it was a Leprechaun's delight!
Firstly, I fried -4- skin-on, bone-in chicken breasts in 2 tablespoon's of vegetable oil, &  when skin was dark brown, set them aside and then fried 1 pound of cut up - pancetta, (frying it in 3 tablespoons of olive oil -  healthier that way), as I had no bacon on hand, then I fried the sliced Red onion  In that. (no yellow on hand). I then added 1 1/2 cups of shredded Dubliner cheese to melt.  A good dollop of sour cream made the sauce nice. This was then poured over the fried breasts....and served with mashed potatoes to make it all the more an authentic Irish dish.
Raves, raves, raves, even our dogs woofed the left overs down!

Love this recipe, the mix of onions and bacon are great, add cheese and it's a whole new flavor. I did the recipe as posted but I did add French's crispy caramelized onions on top for the last 5 min. to add crunch. My family ate it all and that does not always happen.

This dish was wonderful. I had to make it with the onions on the side b/c my son-in-law is allergic to them and they loved it. The sweet and salty was a great taste and this is one I will be doing again. My daughter wanted to take some for lunch, but there wasn't any leftovers.

Easy and delish!
I first cook the bacon and then drained off all but 1 tablespoon of bacon fat.  I pounded the breasts between two pieces of saran wrap to make a more uniform thickness and then dried them thoroughly with paper towels, cooked them at a pretty high heat until almost done, removed them from the pan, covered them with foil and stuck them in the oven to keep warm.  When the onions were done I  return chicken to the pan (with the liquid that had  accumulated on the plate) and finished cooking them.  They turned out extremely tender and not dry.

This was simple, and easy! I don't cook very often at all and never know what types of flavoring to put on my meats so it was a surprise to me that I can use lemon pepper/bacon and brown sugar!

It was beautiful and very easy to make. I added garlic powder to mine. My husband loves it. It's delicious. This is one dish that will become a regular for my family. Thanks for posting.

Totally yummy! Easy to make. Everyone loved this recipe! The changes that I made was to squirt the chicken breasts with a bit of lemon juice while cooking instead of using the lemon spice which I didn't have on hand. Also, I broke up the bacon into small chunks after frying it and added to the onions after they were fried simply because I wanted bite sized pieces of bacon instead of strips on top. Topped with a bit of mozzarella instead. Was terrific and super filling! Will certainly make this dish again.

Made it tonight.  We really liked it!  I was a little afraid it would be super sweet - but with the lemon pepper on the chicken, the saltiness of the bacon and the cheese - it was surprisingly good!  I did what another reviewer suggested and cooked the bacon and onions before the chicken.  I would definitely make it again and think it would easily be enjoyed by guests.   Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy and good.  Tastes similar to a syrup chicken that I make.  I had everything on hand. Will for sure make this again.

Very easy and quick.  Was a good recipe, only gave 4 stars because I felt the chicken needed more flavor. Overall, wasn't bad and husband said it was still tasty on the second day (left overs). I did flatten the chicken breasts out prior to cooking and followed all other directions as noted.  I would make again but would just add a few more spices for added flavor.

The only change I made was to substitute sugar free maple syrup for the brown sugar to make it diabetic-friendly.  Husband liked it even though he doesn't like caramelized onions.  More onions for me next time!

I followed the recipe as written. This is delicious! Since onions cook down, next time I will use two. I will also use a little less brown sugar. The chicken breast I had were very thin so it didn't take long at all to pull this together. Next time I sm going to put this on a hearty bun for the boys after football practice. I think it would make an excellent sandwich!

I rarely take the time to rate a recipe, but my husband was totally blown away by this recipe. He said this was restaurant quality and one of the best things he had ever eaten, bar none. He even wanted to know what to call it, so he could refer to it in the future. This will definitely make future appearances in our household.

This was such an easy dish that packed so much flavor that it sent my taste buds in a frenzy!! Family truly enjoyed this dish. Only difference we did is I used mozzarella cheese ONLY because that was all I had. Even so I had a slight change this dish STILL was amazing, we again enjoyed very much. We will make again ??

Super easy & fast to make, but still tastes gourmet with the mixture of lemon pepper, brown sugar & cheese. I only had sharp cheddar and it still tasted delicious!

Excellent!   I caramelized the onion in bacon grease first then cooked the chicken in the remaining bacon grease rather than veg oil.  Everyone loved it!

This is a great recipe to customize to your liking. I substituted garlic pepper for the lemon pepper and cut the brown sugar in half. I also added a pinch of cayenne to the onion/brown sugar mixture and used shredded pepper-jack cheese for my spice-loving family. The combo of spicy, savory and sweet is really delicious.

Made last night and it was delish! My kids even asked for seconds which is not normal. My husband HATES onions but these was so good he didn't even know what he was eating. I didn't have colby jack so I added strips of cheddar cheese and it tasted great. Will definitely make again with colby.

Fantastic! My 15 year old son who usually hates onions devoured it. I pretty much stuck to the recipe, with the exception of using shredded cheddar instead because it is what I had on hand. It was delicious. I think next time I will broil slightly to melt and brown the cheese.

This is an easy and great tasting recipe. I was looking for a quick and easy way to serve the basic chicken breast and found this recipe. I had to substitute ham for the bacon and mozzarella for the Colby cheese because that's what I had on hand.  Since I'm pan frying impaired, I cooked the breast on my GF grill. Also had to use butter to sauté the onions. It turned out great a very tasty way to serve chicken. I'm now anxious to try the recipe the original way. Thanks Brent for sharing this great recipe.

Made this with leftover rotissary chicken... Just reheated it in the microwave with the lemon pepper, but left out the salt.  I wasn't trying to save time, but that saved about 15 minutes. Otherwise i followed the recipe exactly.  The carmelized onions were wonderful, maybe the result of cooking in bacon grease.  I served it for lunch on toasted hotdog buns.

I made this exactly like written.  It was very good and my husband really liked it.  I am giving it 4 stars as I didn't think it was fantastic but it is worthy of making again.  It was very easy, good presentation and fast.  I think next time, I will cut the bacon up in pieces. Thanks Brent.

Absolutely terrific recipe, one of the best chicken dishes ever! Only changes were using cheddar cheese, since that's what I had...and only used three large chicken breasts. Also threw in some sliced mushrooms in with the onions. Next time I'll pound the breasts a bit thinner, since they took a while to brown. Don't skimp on the onions...as they end up being candied pieces of deliciousness. If you're looking for a chicken dish....you have to try this one.

Wow, this was delicious! I used (frozen) diced onions since I didn't have a fresh one to slice. Omg, the combination of flavors is insanely good! The taste was a mild but not bland chicken, smoky, salty bacon, mild cheese & ohhh those caramelized onions! When I scooped the onions out of the pan, there were strings of caramel as if I'd made candy. Anyone thinking of trying this, go for it. This is an impress your friends kind of entrée. Thank you for sharing it!

This dish was so unexpectedly good! The caramelized onions made the dish! I added a couple dashes of cayenne pepper and butter to the onions. Also, I substituted turkey bacon for regular bacon. My boyfriend said it's definitely a keeper and its placed in rotation!

I tried this recipe tonight, it was awesome.  I accidentally put the onions in the chicken pan, before the bacon but when I saw the color it turned the white onions I was thrilled! Nice deglazing the pan.  I set them aside to finish cooking them, while I cooked the bacon.  It was fairly simple a big plus.  Can make for company.

This was great and super quick and easy!!  My husband isn't a huge fan of chicken and is very picky and said this may be the best thing I have ever made. He refuses to eat leftovers and ate this again the next day for lunch!!!  The only thing I changed was i added mushrooms with my sautéed onions and I added more cheese.  This will be a regular. Thank you for the recipe!

Super awesome!  I used half of the cheese, sugar and bacon to cut calories and it still had tons of flavor.  I had to put the chicken in the oven a few minutes to get the cheese to melt all the way.  Delicious!

This difinetly needs to be put under the broiler to melt the whole thing right before serving . I also threw my breasts in some whole wheat flour and let sit for 10 minutes, then fryed. I always use @ 8-10 tbls of bacon grease vs. the 2 the recipe calls for, but then I fry my bacon in bacon grease.

This recipe was so delicious! The small change I made was to cut up the bacon before cooking it. I mixed up the bacon pieces with the onions and served the dish with mashed potatoes. Yum!

This was really good.  I followed the recipe with the exception of the lemon pepper which is a personal preference.  I would make this again.

This was pretty good! Don't be afraid to add a lot of lemon pepper for flavor. I was scared so it wasn't as flavorful as it could've been.

I was searching for something different to do with my chicken and this is a simple keeper. I didn't have lemon pepper so I used lemon rind and also substituted the bacon with turkey bacon. I tried to shave a few calories and no one noticed the difference.

Yum! Yum! Yum!  Wonderful as is, do not skimp on the onions, they make the dish- even if you think you don't love onions- you will.  I used chicken breast tenders, they're smaller & my family likes them better.  I always have cooked torn bacon peices in my freezer & this recipe gave me yet another use for them.  I put the chicken in a glass dish in the oven at a low temp to keep warm & completed the process, switched to broil to help melt the cheese. My daughter, who usually eats 2 bites of meat at a meal, ate an entire peice.  Hubby said, definitely a keeper!

This is a really good recipe, and we enjoyed it more than similar recipes that use BBQ sauce.  The sugar was a little much on the onions, and it caramelized into a bit of a mess; however, it tasted good.  Next time, I'll reduce the sugar and add it right before I take the onions off the stove.  The whole family devoured this meal, and I've added it to my rotation.  Thank you!
