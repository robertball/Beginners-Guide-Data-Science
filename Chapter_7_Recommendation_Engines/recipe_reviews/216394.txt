Changed a few things up and it was great.  Added crushed garlic to sausage while it was cooking then added fresh mushrooms.  I used shredded mozzarella cheese instead of parmesan and also used shredded potatoes instead of cubes.  This is a keeper for sure..

My family loved this recipe.  I made it for Christmas morning.  The next time I make it, I think I would use the maple flavored sausage.

Link sausages sliced in 1/4" slices pre-cooked in skillet works fine & may be cheaper than the crumbles but does add an extra step.  For a veggie version; omit potatoes but add 1 c. chpd zucchini, 1/2 c. each yellow onion & red & yellow bell pepper chpd.  Top evenly with 1/3 c. crumbled goat cheese & freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano chs; 1/4 c. fresh flat leaf parsley & 1/4 c. fresh basil, sliced.  Add 1 or 2 more egges plus add 1 c. heavy cream.  Bake in 9x13 dish ahead of time at 400* oven for 25-30 min. or until knife inserted in center comes out clean.  Serve immediately OR cover with foil & chill until the next day (I have also frozen this frittata for up to one month).  Re-warm in a 250* for 20-30 min.  Fresh goat cheese is better than the pre-crumbled kind but it works too.

This is actually how I make omelets too, but I always fire up the broiling coil while I'm heating the pan because I cook the egg mixture on medium-low heat until it starts to bubble and then I put the whole pan under the broiler for a few minutes until the top of the egg mixture cooks a bit. Then back to the pan and cook a bit more, loosen the edges and one more time under the broiler until it's slightly browned.  I also used some good loose breakfast sausage from the butcher instead of pre packaged brand name sausage.  VERY good recipe.  Thanks for posting it!

This was easy and yummy.  Even the kids liked it.  I added red peppers and a little milk to stretch the eggs.  Will definitely make again.

I don't see where it says to add cottage cheese to the recipe.  It says parmesan cheese.  I can't wait to try it this Sunday for brunch.

This was a great base recipe.  I used smoked bratwurst instead of sausage and since I had no potatoes I added chopped celery, onion, and more tomatoes.  Cooked for 15 minutes and it came out perfect!  Topped with shredded cheddar and bacon crumbles.  Yum!

My first time making a frittata and it turned out great. I used a little too much salt, which I don't recommend, but it was easy and flavorful.

This is really good. I changed a few things, added onion, feta cheese...instead of the parmesan and whipped the eggs with Philly Cream Cheese cooking cream. Then I baked it for about 15-20 minutes.

This is a great base recipe. Used mild Italian sausage, left over oven roasted asparagus, mozzarella and parm. Topped it off with some mild salsa.

This is very tasty, however I gave 4 stars and not 5 because I had to put my skillet under the broiler because after 17 minutes the middle of the skillet was far from done.  I put the skillet on my stove's biggest burner and it still wouldn't cook. When I put my skillet under the broiler to cook the top it came out wonderful.

I put my onions in the skillet while my sausage and potatoes cooked because raw onions on top just seemed odd.  Having them sautéed with the sausage and potatoes gave great flavor.  This is a great recipe because you can use it as a base and change so many things like which kind of cheese you use, adding veggies, etc.  I would even make this with ham cubes instead of sausage in the future.

I reduced the amount for two people and increased the proportion of potato, cooking that first. Used precook end sausage for simplicity sake. Served with salsa and a fruit salad. Great easy lunch.

This was pretty good.  I added some onions and mushrooms and was pleasantly surprised.  I expected it to have a stiff "crustiness" about the outside, but was happy to see that it didn't form one.

It was delicious! I didn't have Parmesan cheese on hand so I used a Colby and Monterrey jack mix. I think this recipe would work with whatever type of cheese you want to use.

I made a couple changes but this was delicious!  I turned this into a sausage egg "bake" and mixed all the ingredient's, including the tomatoes and green onions then threw it in the oven and baked for about 30 maybe 35 minutes.  It was so delicious!  Thanks :)

Used this as instruction to make my first frittata. I used different ingredients (spinach, feta, crab, parm) but instructions were great and it turned out perfectly. Also I topped with cheddar and melted quickly under broiler.

I used grated zucchini instead of potatoes, and bratwurst instead of jimmy dean. The other option was bacon. Either way, the recipe basics are great and adapts well.

This was easy and a nice Sunday morning brunch.  I followed the directions exactly and just added chopped fresh spinach and shredded Gouda cheese to the egg mixture.  It was a big hit.  Even my 4 year old twins loved it!

Yum!  I used feta instead of parmesan, skipped the butter and potatoes, and added some red and yellow bell peppers.  The flavor was wonderful.

Made this tonight and was enjoyed by my whole family, even the 3yr old!   Only change I made was to add 2 cloves of garlic to the sausage mixture.  Easy recipe that can be adapted: next time I will try ham and broccoli or all veggies.

I liked it, but the original recipe was a bit bland for me. I added onion. Still to bland. Next time I will add some red pepper to give it a bit of a kick. Also instead of using a frying pan to cook it (I knew it would be a big mess) I used a 10 inch pie plate and baked it in the oven at 400 for 25 minutes. Came out perfect. This is a keeper.

Well, I’m not much of a cook. It tasted good but it looked like scrambled eggs, which, of course, it was. I’m going to try another frittata to see if I can improve my technique. I’m 77 yo male.

I used Turkey Italian sausage and it came out dry.  Maybe It Missed the Fat  From Pork Sausage.  Probably Would Add Some Chopped Tomatoes Next Time For Moistness.

I left out the potatoes and got a really nice balance of egg to other ingredients.  The tomatoes and green onions on top add a lovely fresh contrast so it's not as heavy.  Everyone in the family loved it and we had NO leftovers.

It was a hit at our house. I used red pepper, mushrooms and onions and cut back on the potatoes.

This was such an easy recipe to make- I added green onion instead of green peppers- it was what I had! And I used 6 links instead of 4... next time I will add more! Was fantastic for our Christmas morning breakfast!

The first time I make a recipe, I make it pretty much as is, then put my spin on it next time. I had sausage crumbles leftover from breakfast burritos yesterday, so I diced up two small potatoes, put them in the microwave with a splash of water, covered and cooked for 5 minutes, stirring halfway through. Meanwhile, I had the sausage reheating in the skillet and mixed up the egg mixture. It's good as is, if not just a little bland, but we decided next time we will spice it up a little with a little salsa on top instead of diced onion and tomatoes. You could change it up to suit your mood.

Followed recipe exactly, except used cheddar cheese because it's what I had.  Cooked up great.  Family loved it. Super easy.  Will make again.

Made this while on vacation with another couple.  Perfect breakfast / brunch.  Made exactly as recipe called for and was loved by all.  It's another recipe keeper!  Tried and true!

Made a few changes to ingredients to suit what I had in the kitchen. Topped the whole thing with some warmed salsa. Went over great.
