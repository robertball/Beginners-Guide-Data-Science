I made two batches. One following the exact recipe, and one with all butter. Defenitely use all butter, the icing turns out just as nice and there is no shortening taste.

Great base recipe; I used all butter, no shortening. I used an extra teaspoon of vanilla and about 4-5 tablespoons of milk. I only used 2Â½ cups of powdered sugar and found it to be more than enough; I can't imagine the coma I'd be in if I had used 4! I used this icing on the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III (pictured) and I had some left over. The key is clearly to beat at medium to high speed for several minutes to ensure maximum peak. I do recommend this recipe provided you make some minor tweaks... I definitely suggest tasting as you go to ensure that you don't accidentally use too much sugar and have no way to remove the excess. Remember, the best recipes on earth still go through trial and error. =)

I liked this.  It had a milder flavor than other buttercream frostings I've tried, and I LOVED not having to cook it, and not using any eggs in it.  As another reviewer pointed out though, it's absolutely unnecessary to beat the sugar in one cup at a time.  Save yourself all that trouble and just pour all 4 cups in at once.  I also used about twice as much milk, but that was just my preference.  I suggest adding milk one tablespoon at a time until you have the consistency you desire.

In fairness to the recipe and its submitter, I prepared this exactly as written--in other words, had I used all butter (as so many others have) instead of half butter, half shortening as the recipe directs, it wouldn't have been this recipe, right? That said, I rated this recipe, as written, 5-star and perfect as written.  Would it be equally as good with all butter?  Probably, but that would be a different recipe to review.  THIS frosting is creamy, not too sweet, spreads easily, and was simply perfect on "David's Yellow Cake," also from this site.

This recipe *IS* the Wilton recipe.  Except that the Wilton recipe goes further, and specifies that this is the consistency to use for piping, not for spreading.  To thin it in order to use for spreading, you need to add up to 2 Tbsp of corn syrup or milk.  And that's not mentioned here.  That's also why it uses shortening -- to help piped decorations hold their shape.  The 50/50 ratio of butter to shortening is the compromise of flavour vs. practicality for decorating.    But if you're only using it for spreading, there's no issue with using all butter.  It will be a softer consistency, that's all.

Awesome frosting! I have made it enought o know that you do not need to put each cup of sugar in at a time though. It's a waist of time & unnessesary. You can put all the cups in one bowl at once and all of the other ingredients and simply mix. It takes less than 5 minutes.

I took others reviewers advice and used only butter. The key is to mix on high to get it to blend into icing. I put all the sugar in at once as well.  I used all 4 cups of sugar and it was sweet. I love sweet, but this is too much for me, will make it again but only use 3 cups

I was looking for a cake and icing recipe to make for my nephews sons' graduation party. I made a cake with this icing. I loved it. I found a recipe that takes one box Duncan Hines white cake mix and add a box of Jello White Chocolate pudding. I made the cake by the directions and just added the dry pudding mix with a 1/2 c. water. The cake is fabulous. I had my neice (mother of grad)come over and try yet another cake, and she went nuts. She loved it. She stated "this is the cake, this is the one, you can stop looking for recipes. The icing is fabulous. It goes great with the cake. It all just melts in your mouth. Oh I'm in heaven. This is the best cake I've ever had." And the grad himself even tried it and loved it. I sent half the cake home with them and they were fighting over who was carrying the cake as they were going out the door. LOL.  Well you have made all of us very happy. I get to quit baking bad cakes with so-so to nasty icing and my nephews son knows he is getting a fabulous cake for his grad party. Thanks so much. This was a life saver.

This was really good!  I took advise from other reviews and ONLY used Butter.  I did NOT use shortening.  I also increased the vanilla to 2tsp and reduced the sugar to 3 cups.  
Although no one else thought so, I thought it was a bit thick, and i think it may have been that my butter was not at room temp ( i had to warm it in the microwave.) When i make this again, i will make sure the icing is warmed properly.
Try this recipe!  It is really good!

I was very pleased with this recipe.  I have just recently started decorating cakes 
and this was the best icing I have made so far.  I cannot find the difference but it
tasted better than the Wilton's recipe.  Excellent!

I usually hate making home made icing.  Usually I just cheap out and buy the store bought stuff.  This year I decided to make sugar cookies with the kids and thought it would be fun to do some decorating as a christmas activity.  This recipie, to say the least, is AWESOME!!  I thought we were going to eat all the icing before we even decorated the cookies!!  I hate the taste of icing usually but this was so tasty.  I used only butter with no shortening and added a wee bit more milk.  Definitely will use this one again!!  THANKS!

I have been making this frosting for 28 years. It is the Wilton recipe. I make it just as written and it's great for icing cakes and cupcakes and doing piping work. When decorating a cake you may need to make a double batch. A 2 lb. bag of confectioners sugar is perfect for this. Dont worry about leftover frosting...it freezes well. I do not use all butter as some people swear by. I think the shortening adds some stability especially when doing a lot of piping work. The warmth of your hands around the decorating bag could make the frosting break down easier when using all butter. The taste is excellent just as written. The amount of milk needed may have to be adjusted slightly due to humidity and temperature. The only thing I do differently, is to beat on low spead so as not to incorporate too much air into the frosting. This creates a very smooth and creamy frosting that results in a  flawless finish to your iced cakes. A perfect canvas for adding flowers, borders and whatever else your creativity inspires.

This is a classic buttercream recipe, one I've been using for years.  The only difference is that I add a pinch of salt.  I also add the sugar one cup at a time to ensure that the sugar is completely blended.   Milk should be added until the desired consistency is achieved.  Paste food colorings work best. Many reviewers have omitted the shortening, which is fine and produces a beautiful, creamy frosting; however, when blended properly, the shortening gives the frosting an added 'fluff' that can't be achieved with butter only.  For those worried about the taste of the shortening, be sure to blend well.   For more options:  In addition to the vanilla, I add a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract.   For a chocolate buttercream, add 1/2 c of cocoa powder.  (more or less can be added to taste) Thanks for sharing and happy baking!

This is a very good, basic, simple recipe for cookie frosting.  It doesn't taste too buttery, and it is very sweet, but with just the right amount of frosting it adds a sugary kick to cookie recipes.  I used it with the "Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" recipe, since that one isn't very sweet, and it was a perfect complement.  Just make sure your confectioner's sugar isn't lumpy (maybe use a sifter) or else it won't spread smoothly and evenly like it does on bakery cookies.

I followed the recipe EXACT. Though the consistancy was perfect, I think it would have been better with all butter instead of half butter/half shortening. I would have liked more vanilla flavor as well.

this is a great recipe for decorating. It is actually the exact recipe found on Wiltons website. As far as different people using less sugar and more milk, this really depends on WHAT YOU ARE USING IT FOR. if you are simply frosing a cake or cupcakes it is great to thin it out for a softer creamier frosting. However if you are decorating flowers or other things on a cake or cookies with decorater tips it is necessary to use it thicker to hold the shapes. Hope this helps. To make a fabulous chocolate buttercream just add 3/4 C cocoa and an extra TBS or two of milk depending on how thick you want it.

Perfect consistency, flavor and piping quality. I've gone through several buttercream recipes in the search for my perfect wedding cake, and this is the one I ended up on. I have made it plain, as well as with lemon extract and about 4oz melted white baking chocolate, and both variations came out delicious.  I disagree with the reviews suggesting to omit shortening and use all butter. I've never liked all butter buttercream, because all you can taste is butter, it has a greasy mouth feel and poor piping consistency. I think a 50/50 shortening to butter ratio creates the perfect balance.

All butter recipes bleed and don't hold up as well as this recipe.  TRUST THIS RECIPE and use half butter & half shortening.  The only thing I have come to do different with this recipe is use whipping cream instead of milk.  A dearly-departed friend and I bonded over perfecting this recipe before she passed.  Whipping cream is the only difference we chose and both fell in love with this recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. Instead I used one cup of solid shortening and clear vanilla extract and add 1/2 teaspoon No-Color Butter Flavor(you can find them at your local crafts store) to make a pure white icing. To make it stiff for floral decorations, just delete 1TBS of milk. You can also substitute corn syrup or water for the milk. To color the icing, do not add food coloring, it will thin out the icing. Instead use color paste for icing which can also be found at your local crafts store in the cake decorating section.

Great tasting recipe!  Tons of compliments!!  Side note:  I used butter-flavored shortening, and tried to make light blue icing.  What I got instead was green, since yellow and blue make green!  Keep this in mind when tinting this frosting with food colors!

The reason it calls for shortening is too keep your color true if adding tint. If your not using color and you don't mind an off white appearance, than by all means use all butter-of course it will taste better. There is truth to some comments that it holds up better in the pastry bag if using it to decorate too. The butter breaks down easier from the heat of your hand while piping. Wilton even says to use all shortening if you want a snow white frosting. Hence, don't use margarine which has even more yellow color than butter. To cut the sweetness, you can add a pinch of salt to the butter while beating before the sugar, but beat well until it dissolves. Good luck!

I didn't have shortening, so I took the advice of others and used all butter. Reduced sugar to just 1.25 cups. It held up well (even in humid Singapore, so that's saying something), was stiff enough to pipe without refrigerating! Icing was smooth and creamy, and complimented my vanilla cupcakes well. Definitely a keeper.

I loved it! After reading almost every single review, I decided to stick with the original recipe of 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter, but I used heavy whipping cream instead of milk and added a pinch of salt, also only used 3 cups of sugar because I didn't want it to be too sweet and it turned out perfect!. I also used 1/4 tsp artificial butter flavor and 1 and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract, the clear kind.

This is a great recipe!  I made half of the recipe, which was the perfect amount to decorate 12 cupcakes. I only used unsalted butter -- no shortening, then halved the other ingredients.  I also added a tsp of Strawberry extract to it.  It was WONDERFUL!  Thank you!

Thank god I found this recipe!  I had a crisis with another buttercream icing (it was melting when out of the fridge for too long!) and needed a quick substitute.  I, too, used all butter in this and added a splash more of vanilla, and it turned out great.  I also omitted one cup of powdered sugar, it was borderline too sweet with just 3, which is why I only gave it 4 stars.

I've used this recipe for years.  It's wonderful!  I always pour the milk in slowly, alternating with the powdered sugar.  Sometimes I need all of it, and sometimes I don't.  When I double the recipe, I use a 2 lb. bag of sugar, which measures out to be about 7 cups.  Shhhhh, don't tell anybody, but I never refrigerate my cakes with this frosting either.

This recipe was terrible! I was very impressed at how it mixed together. It was not runny at all! But when I tasted this frosting, it was WAY to sweet and you could still taste the shortening and butter in it. I tried one more batch of this recipe putting less sugar but it was still terrible! DO NOT USE THIS RECIPE! I do not know why people are raving about this for?

I adjusted the butter to 3/4 cup and used 1/4 cup butter flavored crisco in the recipe and this frosting came out divine. I could have eaten the frosting without the cake it is that good!

I used this to frost a lemon cream filled chiffon cake.  I subbed cream cheese for the shortening (doubled the recipe) and I only used 6 cups of sugar.  It was very tasty!!  Not too sweet, and complimented the cake very nicely.  And licking the bowl and spoon afterwards was really good too;)

I made this recipe with all butter, as other suggested. If I make it again, I will definitely use less butter. 1 cup is wayyy too much. It was way too greasy. I'll use 1/2 cup next time and add more milk instead. Tasted good though!

USE ALL BUTTER! If you skip the shortening, this is a five star recipe. Also, I only used 3 cups of powdered suger--perfect.

I made this for the first time and iced my sons wedding cake.  It was four tiers high.  I was a nervous wreck.  The icing tastes wonderful.  I read the reviews so I subbed butter for the shortening.  Delicious!!

This is my favourite buttercream recipe, but I definitely suggest using all butter.  The shortening doesn't melt as nicely at body temperature so it leaves an awful film in your mouth.

THIS FROSTING IS GREAT FOR CHRISTMAS CUT-OUT COOKIES.  JUST THE RIGHT SWEETNESS AND A FEW EXTRA DROPS OF MILK MADE IT EVEN CREAMIER.  FOUR CHILDREN USED THIS ICING FOR THEIR COOKIES AND I HAD TO KEEP REMINDING THEM NOT TO EAT THE ICING!  I WILL NEVER BUY CANNED FROSTING AGAIN!!!

Made this twice in one week.  Made it once with shortening and butter and just butter.  The pure butter version seems a bit softer and it lacks a slight aftertaste and I prefer the pure butter version.  I also sub the vanilla extract for almond extract - mmm!  This is a GREAT butter cream frosting recipe!  I halved it to frost 12 cupcakes tonight and it wasn't enough because I piped it but if I had spread it on my mom's way I would have had plenty.

A nice, basic buttercream frosting, spreads nicely. I needed to make mine milk-free, so I used 1 c. margarine instead of the shortening and butter, and it worked well. Beware - some vanilla extracts will give the frosting a light brown tint. If you're coloring the frosting anyway it doesn't matter, but if you want it to be pure white, you're better off using vanilla sugar.

Used all butter as per top reviewer's advice.  Needed an icing that would hold up well for cake decorating plus still taste good, and this definitely fit the bill.  This recipe was SO much better than the canned icing I always use, and this is simple enough to whip up that I think I'll switch to using this recipe from now on.  Thanks for the recipe!

My taste buds prefer the bakery-style icing because that's what I grew up eating, so I don't find the shortening in this recipe off-putting. I made sure to cream the butter and shortening together really well before adding the sugar, and I used only 3 cups of sugar + 2 teaspoons (not tablespoons) of milk to get the consistency I wanted. (I had already added a bit of liquid food coloring by that point so not much more liquid was required.) It's quite sweet even with just 3 cups of sugar + 1/4 tsp of salt that I added, so next time I may try also adding tiny bit of lemon juice in place of some of the milk, which has worked to reduce the sweetness in other frosting recipes I've tried.

I cut everything in half and added pureed cherry jam for flavoring and almond extract to make it cherry flavor for the glaze/frosting.  It worked splendidly.  I love this recipe ... because it uses butter.  I used it for my Watermelon Cupcakes and it pipes beautifully!

first off, I wish I had followed everyone's advice-(use only butter- NO shortening). This is the first frosting I've ever made. I just made this for a cake that is baking in the oven. Followed the recipe exactly and turned out how it was supposed to. It tastes alright and looks pretty but it does taste, in fact,like shortening.  oh well. I like the texture and everything about this frosting... will make again WITHOUT the shortening!

I agree that this icing tastes better when you use all butter but the shortening melts at a higher temperature than butter does and therefore this recipe is better suited for decorating than an all butter recipe. Otherwise, if you use all butter, your decorations may melt into each other....but, it'll still be yummy :o)

I add a teaspoon of Almond Extract also. It adds a bit of a cherry flavor to the icing.

I love this recipe!  I follow it to the letter, with both shortening & butter. The nice thing is that you can then add other flavourings with minimal change to consistency.    Coffee: 3 Tbsp of left over strong brewed coffee, and 2 tsp heaped of instant coffee granuals.    I have also added 1 tsp of almond extract in addition to the vanilla which is brilliant on chocolate cupcakes!    The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that glitter and sprinkles do not stick very well to this icing.  Happy Baking! x

Wonderful, light, fluffy, delicious, delicate-- all of these adjectives describe this frosting to a t.  Only one problem-- I feel like I'm wasting it on the cookies that I made it for!
I did however add a few more tablespoons of milk for the extra creamy flavor and texture.  Truly the best icing I have ever tasted-- not too sweet or sugary, terrific texture!  I think it would be better for cake over cookies, unless the cookies absolutely melt in your mouth!

Great recipe! I usually opt for all butter buttercream but went to a BBQ out in 90 degree humid weather. I used butter flavored crisco and added a little bit of salt to combat the overly sweet. With some raspberry and lemon extracts it was awesome and held up in the heat.

This is the best tasting buttercream Icing I have ever had.  Everyone loves it and it is so easy to make.  I would recommend using the butter flavor shortening though.

This frosting is fantastic! I used all butter though because I don't like shortening. It's great as chocolate too, just add some cocoa powder :)

Very simple to make but I did not like the taste.  To me, it tasted more like royal icing.

Excellent! Unlike others, I followed the recipes exactly, using shortening and butter instead of all butter. Turned out terrific! Will definitely make this again.

I subbed another 1/2 C butter for the shortening, only used 2 C confectioners sugar and added 3 t of cinnamon. Even with the reduction of sugar, the icing was still very sweet and I only needed half of it to frost 24 cupcakes.

2 stars because it is easy to whip up but we hated the taste of this frosting. The texture is good but we need to work on the taste. Maybe if I used all butter it would be better. Add some lemon zest and juice to make it a lemon frosting. As is though....doesn't make the grade in this family and we love creams and frostings. Everything is home made in this house so I cannot compare it to store bought, maybe that's what it's supposed to taste like?

My changes:
Used all butter
Added a bit more vanilla
used liquid food coloring so between the vanilla and food coloring I needed more powdered sugar so I added 1/4 cup more.

It was perfect. My sister-in-law LOVED it and was eating the extra icing from the cup I saved it in. Nice 7 simple and totally versatile. I normally make a cooked butter cream icing but I needed a quick one and this worked amazingly!

Make this buttercream alot.  Tastes best when you add a touch of salt.  Try it and see BIG difference.  If you omit shortening, it will be a different consistency-the shorteneing is a great stabilizer, especially if you are piping onto your cake.  I store leftovers in freezer or sometimes use for graham cracker cookies (frosting sandwiched between 2 grahams-quick kid snack).

The icing is yummy but too sweet. I had to use three cups of sugar instead of four. I also used 2 1/2 table spoons of milk.

I did not follow the recipe rather I took the advice of several people on here and just used all butter. I used 1 and a half stick butter, 2 cups of confectioner's sugar and vanilla extract. I didn't measure the vanilla I just used my judgment. I put red and blue food colouring to make a dusty rose. I did not need the milk at all. It turned out wonderful! I think 4 cups will be appropriate if you were making a huge amount of frosting otherwise I think 4 cups of sugar is a bit much.

I love this recipe modified, but as is, it is TOO SWEET!  The first time I made it, I followed others suggestions and used more butter than shortening (3/4c to 1/4c) and half the sugar, and it was amazing!  This time, I used the even amount shortening and butter and 3c of sugar, and it was too sweet for me.  But, this is coming from someone that doesn't like 80% of the frosting/icings out there.  So, take it for what it is worth.

I made this frosting today for my daughter's birthday cake. It tastes very good after adding a few extra Tbsp of milk. It was too thick and would not spread easily. I did add another tsp of vanilla also. I do like the mixing of butter and shortening as it adds the perfect mix of flavor and texture to the frosting.

Great recipe! Much better than the traditional all shortening no butter that I have used many times before.  And, the bonus was how much easier the clean up is using the butter.

Wonderful vanilla buttercream flavor! Made this on a marble cake, and my in-laws loved it! I used all butter, as a previous review had suggested, and I was not disappointed. Only qualm: this didn't make a whole lot of frosting. I had to add four more tablespoons of butter and about 2/3 C of confectioner's sugar to get just enough, and even with the addition, it barely covered the whole cake with its three layers. Next time, I will add a third more to this recipe, or even another half, to get all the icing I need.

I used all butter and added 1 small jar of strawberry jam (no seeds) and an additional cup of sugar. It made A LOT of frosting, but we have a lot of cupcakes to frost.   I haven't tried flavoring it with other flavors, but imagine that other jams/preserves would be good.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I don't think the shortening is necessary.

I normally make the wilton buttercream recipe, but was out of shortening, and decided to try this as many reviewers were making it with only butter. It is warm out today, and the icing started to seperate 10 minutes after taking it out of the fridge. After 30 minutes on the counter it looks awful on my cake. I made it with the entire 4 cups of sugar, and it tastes wayyyyy to sweet.

I decorate cakes and I LOVE this recipe because it is half shortening and half butter. You get the benefits of both. I also use almond extract to give it more flavor (any extract would work). Just substitute 1/4 of the vanilla for flavored extract. It makes a very thick frosting, so unless you are making flowers, continue to thin until a knife just starts falling over when poked into the frosting.

I have 3 children with birthdays within 10 days of each other and the cakes are always a big deal. I made three custom cakes and 12 mini cakes in 10 days and used this icing on all of them. With minor differences in between. It is so simple and tastes great. It is very easy to change up also. I used strawberry ice cream syrup instead of vanilla on one and it turned out pink and tastey.

Perfect!  I've seen other posts that say this is a Wilton recipe.  I'm assuming it's an old recipe, because I'm in the Wilton beginner's class and there is NO butter in the recipe they have us make and it tastes awful.  They should go back to this recipe!! I tried this one this weekend for cupcakes and it was perfect!  Yummy flavor, great texture.  Of course, it makes a stiff icing, I had to add more milk/water for the kind of decorating I wanted to do with it.  I will use this recipe as a base for all my icings going forward.

Great icing recipe!  I made this for Valentine cupcakes for my husband's office, and they raved about the icing.  I made it both with all butter (based on reviews I read) and as it is written. I needed a second batch and didn't have enough butter and had to use 1/2 shortening that time.  Both were good, but the all-butter version was AWESOME!  If I hadn't tried it that way, I would have loved the recipe with 1/2 shortening, but the flavor is so much better with all butter.

Glad I tried it. I don't like very sweet icing so I tweaked a few things because of previous reviews. I ended up eliminating the 1/2 cup shortening and replacing it with butter,  2tsps. of vanilla, 2 1/2 cups of confectioner's sugar and 4 tbs. of milk. I was able to frost an entire bundt cake with this recipe.

3/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening would be better if you made this recipe to taste especially good. But I made this recipe for making buttercream roses which definetely need the shortening. I only used 3 1/2 cups (only!) but the frosdting was a little too thin for making roses. it tasted great though!

Though I do like this recipe and use it often, I'm surprised that it can be claimed as your own.  It is the buttercream frosting by Wilton.

One of the best buttercream icings I have ever made.  I iced cupcakes for my kids birthday party with this icing and everyone raved about it.  I even had a few say it was the best buttercream that they had ever had.

Perfect every time.  I don't know what the difference is in this recipe, maybe part of it is measuring correctly.  I've used this recipe for the last 4 cakes and even added fresh strawberries once and peppermint extract for Christmas. Always my go to buttercream.  Thanks for sharing!

This icing was perfect! I doubled it and used Wilton Gel Decorating colours with it. I also added some almost extract becasue it was an almost cake I was icing. Delicious and easy to use.

I doubled the recipe and it made the perfect amount to fill and frost a 12" layer and an 8" layer.  The only thing I did differently was to use a little extra vanilla.  I don't think I used quite 8 cups of sugar, and I didn't use 4 Tbls milk either.  I just tasted as I went to get the sweetness  and consistency I was looking for.  I like shortening in my frosting because it holds up better under fondant.  Frosting is hard to have an "exact" recipe because it responds differently depending on your environment.  I added a couple of cups of sugar at a time to make sure it didn't go too sweet.  Just taste as you go to get what you like.  A great base to build on w/ other flavors too.

I used all unsalted butter instead of half shortening/half butter.  It turned out fantastic.  I also swapped out 1/2 the milk for hazelnut creamer and gave it an awesome extra little after taste. :)  I'll be using this recipe again!

This recipe is most excellent! This was the second recipe that I tried for my cake. The first icing really tasted like merinque, and it just didn't do it for me. However, this recipe is the bomb! It was 10 times easier than the other one that I had to cook on the stove. Also, this recipe can be modified to your personal tastes. I used 1 cup butter, 2 teaspoons vanilla, 2 1/2 cups of confectioners' sugar, and 1 tablespoon of 2% milk for my icing. It turned out great, and it coated two 9 inch cake pans with no room to spare. I can't write enough about how great, functional this recipe is!

Fantastic!  The is the best icing I've tasted in years! 
As suggested, I used all butter, no shortening.  I also increased the milk to 3 Tbsp.  I used all 4 cups of the sugar and it was perfect.  It had a great consistency and wonderful flavor, not too sweet!  My husband & children absolutely love this recipe.  It is a keeper!  Thank you for this recipe!!!

This recipe is classic, easy to make and very tasty. The reason for the solid shortening, is to allow the frosting to hold up to the heat of your hands as you squeeze the pastry bag. All butter will warm and melt changing the color and texture of the frosting while you pipe the decorations on the cake. But all butter does taste better if you are only frosting a cake.

I made a few slight alterations to this recipe. I used butter in place of the 1/2 cup shortening, and I also used 2 TBSP water instead of milk so I wouldn't have to refigerate the cupcakes. Turned out beautifully! YUM!

I will defiantely try this. But wanted to add. If you use water instead of milk you can leave it on the counter intead of refridgerating. Also, the comments abotu the amount of sugar, you need a stiff icing when making roses and some other decorations, but if you are only icing a cake, I would probably reduce the sugar to your taste

So delicious and easy to make, it puts the store-bought stuff to shame!  I did use 1 cup butter (no shortening) and increased the vanilla to 1 Tbsp for extra flavor.  Made enough for a 9-inch round double-layered cake.  A new family favorite ~ Thanks!

Perfect!  I have had other recipes in the past that used either 100% shortening or 100% butter.  I don't like the flavor of the 100% shortening and though the taste of 100% butter frosting is great, it just doesn't hold it's shape as well.  Half butter, half shortening is perfect-good flavor with stability from the shortening.  I did cut the sugar a bit-didn't need it all to get the texture/thickness I needed.  Used about 3.5 cups.  Sifted the sugar even though the recipe didn't say-didn't want lumps!  This is the recipe I'll use from now on-tasted great, looked great, my daughter's birthday cake got rave reviews!

I really enjoyed this recipe. When it comes to taste I do prefer all butter, but when it comes to decorating longevity is key. I found that if you used 3/4 cup butter and 1/4 shortening you get a great frosting w/o the shortening taste. This one is staying in my recipe box.

I wish I could do 4 1/2 stars because that's more fitting! I found that I only needed 3 cups of sugar.  I also used a bit of Wilton's butter flavoring and gel food coloring.  Fantastic!

I love this recipe..  I love to bake and finally decided to give making my own icing a shot.  I doubled the recipe for a two layer cake, added one more teaspoon of vanilla, instead of milk I used heavy cream and then also added just a pinch of salt.  I let the mixtue whip for almost 12 minutes.  I checked it at 5, it was good, again at 8 it was getting better, at 10 was almost perfect and by 12 I had the lightest, most fluffy icing mixture I have ever come across..  EASY EASY EASY and what I like most is the ability to customize to your own liking.  I can't wait until the next time I make this..  I will add 12 oz of melted chocolate..

This is very similar to a recipe I got in a cake decorating class. The class ingredients were 1 cup shortening, 1 teaspoon extract of your choice, and using water instead of milk.  I use butter extract to get the butter flavor without the yellow butter color  (hard to control when coloring icing), and also to not get that sugar cringe when biting into it. Also if you use water and shortening, there's no need for refrigeration.

This is a good basic buttercream recipe. I typically use all butter to frost my cake, then use half butter and half shortening for my piping. It is important to use room temp butter. If you heat it in the microwave it may get too warm and your icing could seperate. You can whip for only 5, but if you whip for at least 10 minutes you will get a better texture.

So easy and sooooo good! Easy to work with too. I have used this recipe many times and it always gets compliments. Takes color very well and holds it's shape. I used this icing in a bag to decorate a pink pig with "stars" to make it look prickly. Three days and the cake is getting stale BUT this icing is still the best part! It does have a bite of sugary grit to it as some reviewers have said, but that's what buttercream frostings are about. If you want smooth icing, dump some sweetener in whipped topping and enjoy. But if you want ICING, try this one! NOT too sweet, NOT too buttery. Not possible! Just good old fashion buttercream icing-incredible!

I used all butter as others suggested and it tasted like a stick of butter. I even added more vanilla to mask the butter taste and it just didn't work. There are much better icing recipes out there.

Great base recipe. I've been playing with this one for over a year. I now use only whipped butter and less shortening than the recipe calls for. I also add more milk and 1 tablespoon of butter flavor. To make chocolate buttercream add 3-4 tablespoons of coco powder.

Never made butter icing before. This was so simple to make and tasted good. Used butter only as didn't have any shortening. Was difficult to spread so will add more liquid next time and slighlty less sugar as it was a tad too sugary. 1/4 of the recipe filled a 9inch cake with no topping.

This is one of our favorite icing. I used butter flavored crisco. I also like to use my whisk attachment on my stand up mixer and whip it up for awhile. It really fluffs up nice. I tried this again with all real butter and my family liked even better. I find the secret is still in whipping it really well. PERFECT!!!

this is an ok recipe.  I made it because I wanted something different than my traditional buttercream, but my usual recipe is much better!!  I follow the same recipe, just I use all butter, no shortening (the shortening had a bad taste in my opinion), and I add milk until I feel it's smooth enough (more than 2 Tablespoons).  I use Land O'Lakes Light Butter to cut the fat in half, and skim milk.  I dye with Wilton dyes or traditional food coloring.  It's great, tastes like the buttercream filling in buttercream chocolates!!

Perfect icing every time! I use 1/4 butter flavored shortening, and 3/4 butter. The shortening makes it super creamy and it always spreads and pipes perfectly. A new staple in my cookbook.

This is my favorite recipe for cake decorating, but I have also played with it a little.  For a light, fluffy, pipeable cream cheese icing, substitute cream cheese for shortening, lemon extract for vanilla, and lemon juice for milk.  You can do the same with orange extract and orange juice.  No greasy taste, and the longer you whip it, the fluffier and less grainy it will be.

I love to make iced sugar cookies but was never satisfied with my mom's recipe for icing.
This is the best icing I've ever tasted.  It is just like the bakery.  I made cookies for Christmas and Valentine's Day.
This recipe will certainly be a new favorite.

This was my first attempt at a buttercream and I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT: Because I used liquid food coloring to make the frosting pink, I didn't add any milk at all. I only put in 8-10 drops but didn't need any other liquid. The frosting was just the right consistency to pipe on some cupcakes. It was perfect! Co-workers devoured the cupcakes and loved the frosting! Raves all around!!! Definitely my "go-to" recipe!

I use margarine instead of shortening because it gives the frosting a diferent richer taste. Sometimes I also use chilled sweetened condensed milk instead of regular milk.

This is  my go-to recipe.
I use it for all of my cakes.
I have a Kitchen Aid stand mixer, so I throw all of the sugar in at once.
I probably add more vanilla than necessary (I seem to be a vanilla junkie lol)
I almost always add more milk than required.  It is  perfect for decorating or frosting with a spatula.
I have never tried it with just butter.  I always use shortening & margarine.
***It also stores well in the fridge for a week or two.  You might just have to whip it again after you leave it at room temperature***

This recipe is too sweet. I also feel like the shortening adds a wax like texture to the icing. If you're making cupcakes for kids I'm sure they won't mind the sugar but, for adults I would find a different recipe.

As suggested in the top review, I used only butter and loved the result! Prior to using this recipe I used another that called for shortening (even used butter flavored) and I didn't dig the shortening taste.

I wish you could give half stars cause this would have been about a 3.5.  For me, I could really taste the shortening.  I added more butter to make it a more butter to shortening ratio and it was better, but I could still taste it.  This wasn't bad, it tasted pretty good, I just didn't like the shortening taste.  The consistancy was nice and thick and would be good for decorating I believe.  Good recipe, just too much shortening.

This is fantastic!  The first time I made it according to the recipe and it was great!  But today I needed to make a raspberry buttercream, so I followed the advice of others and used all butter and I cut the sugar back (as the preserves are sweet as well) and it came out perfect!

I really wanted this recipe to work, but it didn't. Maybe the butter wasn't soft enough, but this recipe was grainy and it didn't work at all for me. Taste wise, it was great. Probably a user error on this one.

I am on a search for the ultimate buttercream frosting, this isn't it.  
I found it to taste too buttery, almost like eating a stick of butter. My family and friends liked it, but its back to the drawing board for me.

I used all butter and no shortening like the other reviewers suggested. I also forgot to add the milk. I thought it was good but my boyfriend said it was too sweet and he only ate one of the cupcakes I made for him.

really delicious. followed the recipe and used half shortening, half butter. Flavorful, like vanilla.
I'd use more butter less shortening to see if it's a little bit less greasy.
Regardless, still good even if you follow the exact recipe. thanks!

The best way to stop eating too much desert is to start making them!  I didn't know that icing was basically sugar and butter!  I guess that explains why it's so delicious... 

I made it with 3 cups sugar, 1/2 c butter, and a little extra milk.  I couldn't possibly use shortening.  It was divine.

Very good.  I substituted a little due to what I had on hand.  Used 1/4 cup of margerine instead of butter and coconut milk as my milk substitute.  It was yummy!!

I needed an egg-free frosting b/c my kindergarden granddaughter is allergic to dairy, eggs, and peanuts. I used her Earth Balance butter substitute and her Spectrum Shortening (no trans fat). It is a shortening that is safe for all the family to eat.  Shortening has moved on from Crisco, it's not your grandmother's shortening. That being said, I added some butter extract which can be found online and some supermarkets. I used only 3 cups of sugar following the reviewers' suggestions.  The taste was very good and so was the texture. A keeper.

I really liked this recipe. Easy enough to make even without a mixer. I did use butter flavored shortening because I didn't want the original shortening taste. Used this recipe to make Wild About You Cupcakes.

I've used a variation of this recipe (found elsewhere) off and on for almost five years. It is very flexible and works well with several extracts. I prefer water to milk for my version.

Great, quick recipe. I used 1 cup butter instead of the shortening, and only 3 cups sugar.  I have a crazy sweet tooth, but I tasted it as I went along and 3 was plenty! It covered about 12 cupcakes using the 1M tip for me. Will used this recipe from now on! Thanks!

This  cookie was good, it had good flavor. But Its probably my own fault making this with my 4 year old and 2 year old. we had to roll it out a few times extra than I would normally. but they were quit chewey and crunchy.  It was ok. But I have made better before. If I did make it again I would make a double or triple batch because it didnt makle very much.

Just made this, and it was a success! I did as directed and found nothing wrong with this recipe. It was easy and quick! Delicious too! I did add 1/2 tsp of almond extract and it tastes even better! Just because I love almond

I changed this just a little bit because I only had butter. I used just under 1 cup of butter (that is all that I had left) and 3 3/4 cup of powdered sugar. I also added a splash of rum and lots of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg because I was using this to frost my rum spice cookies. I put everything in my food processor and it came out amazing! I am so glad that I won't have to buy my frosting at the store now.

5 Stars for the recipe is as. Change out the shortening for another stick of butter and it's a bit better.

This is the best buttercream frosting I have ever tasted! That's saying a lot because I hate frosting. I made the following changes: 4 tablespoons of evaporated milk, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract and replaced the shortening with butter. Delish!!

I made a half recipe to frost some Christmas sugar cookies with. At first I wasn't sure if I would like this recipe since it does have some shortening in it, but I didn't even notice it. I really liked the flavor and how it wasn't as sweet as other buttercream frosting recipes. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used all butter and no shortening. This is my go to icing for everything. The only bad thing it starts to melt after sitting out an hour or so.

I normally use an all-shortening buttercream recipe so I can get it truly white, but I wanted to try Wilton's "Frozen Buttercream Transfer" technique, which requires the buttercream to be at least half butter so it will freeze properly.  I was very happy with the texture and flavor of this buttercream and it worked perfectly for the transfer.  I'll definitely keep this one in my recipe box for whenever I need to make the frozen transfers.

This is an amazing recipe, I own a bakery and have been looking for an easy buttercream for my employees to recreate flawlessly. 
I plan on serving this at a fourth of July BBQ so I didn't want an all butter buttercream because it would have melted before I even got there! I would definitely mix in the confectioners' sugar a third at a time, it creates a smoother frosting and keeps you from being covered in sugar!

Nice, easy recipe.
I made this with my  12 y.o. niece who is just beginning to try her hand at cake decorating.  We downsized the recipe to 10 servings for her to practice  making roses.  Came out light, fluffy and tasty!  She was very proud of her work1

I have been using this buttercream on my sugar cookies FOR YEARS. It is a huge hit! Orders all year long for this simple and delicious recipe. Not judging everyone but why do you customize the recipes then give it a rating? Rate the original recipe so everyone can get an accurate view. TY;)

Very good and the taste was great!  I also used just 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar and it was almost too sweet.  It worked great with my son's firetruck cake and everybody loved the flavor.

This is a very professional recipe wonderful tasting recipe. If you want the icing to hold its shape longer ( out of the 'fridge) then its important to use the shortening.You can up or change  the flavoring if you think you can taste the shortening If you want to make very white icing then substitute white margarine for butter.

Incredible! I, too, halved the sugar, doubled the milk, and used all butter. I cannot believe such a simple recipe could be so good. I am never buying store-bought frosting again. This was amazing!

Made this for my daughter's bday cake.  Have made buttercream icing many a time.  To the reviewers that said it was too sweet and would use less sugar next time:  less sugar will not make it less sweet, it will only change the consistency.  Just add a pinch of salt and perfecto!

LOVE IT. Its so sweet and yummy. Make sure to mix everything well. If it becomes too stiff add more milk. I've made multiple cakes & cupcakes with this and it always comes out great. Not so great for stuffing cake in someones face cuz the frosting doesn't really come off :) its tradition in my family to shove cake in the bday persons face.

This is definately a really good recipe, but I suggest use crisco butter flavor shortening, and try it with almond extract instead of vanilla, the alomond gives it that wedding cake taste, also,  try it without the milk, it makes it a little thicker, more creamy, and easier to spread

my wife tried to make some other buttercream recipe, but it turned out gritty and gross...she was all stressed out about it, so i looked this one up and it turned out really good. I did however use 2 1/2 cups of sugar like another reviewer had suggested. It turned out smooth and tasty. Everyone at her office raved about it..YAY!! score one for the husband!!!

I use butter instead of the shortening for a better taste. Used this recipe in a decorating class to exhibit mechanical icing bags. Held up well and tasted delicious afterwards.

I've used this recipe for years only with all shortening.  Recently, after learning about "trans fats" which is basically shortening, I threw away all of the shortening in my cupboard and only use butter now.

I made this as directed. I really didn't like the greasy feel and taste of the shortening; I wanted to scrape my tongue. I guess if you were just going to use it for piping it would be perfect, but I won't frost a whole cake with it; I'll stick with my regular all butter real cream recipe. So sorry, Sharon. :(

I thought it tasted like butter and powdered sugar, not bad but not great. My husband liked it and since it was his cake that's all that mattered! I would use this recipe again. Made a double batch for a 2 layer 9" round cake and had a very small amount left over.

Good basic white frosting.  You will need to adjust the amount of powdered sugar you use.  I don't use shortening - replaced it with all salted butter.  I also add a teaspoon of almond extract.  You can experiment with different extracts to it instead of vanilla - orange is good...tastes like a creamsicle.

AWESOME!  I did substitute 1/2 cup unsalted butter for the shortening and I made a chocolate batch by adding 2/3 - 3/4cup unsweetened cocoa and reducing the confectioner's sugar by this amount.  I piped this onto cupcakes with no problem.  DELICIOUS! Thank you!!!

I always use this recipe and everyone loves it. I usually use water instead of milk so that the cake does not have to necessarily be refrigerated. I also just add teaspoons of water until its the consistancy that I want. I whip this in my mixer so long until people have commented that it tastes like ice cream. They absolutely love it!

This is an excellent recipe. I wouldnt change anything, as the other reviewers have. I think the shortening allows it to hold up better, and from a professional standpoint this is perfect to decorate with. Thanks!

Okay - let me just say i'm never going back to Royal Icing again! Well - at least not any time soon. I am attempting to learn how to do some cake decor - flowers, leaves, etc. Royal icing was so hard to work, so I tried this as suggested in the Recipe exchange. This icing was so simple to make, and easy to experiment with. I think I've found a winner! Tastes great too.

I made this icing for some cupcakes that I made for the kids. I used all butter and only added 3 cups of powdered sugar (which I thought was plenty) and used heavy cream instead of milk and added a little extra to get the consistency that I wanted. The kids loved it and the cupcakes disappeared quickly.

I love this recipe....although I altered it quite a bit it turned out great! I used 1 cup butter, 2 1/2 cups confectioners sugar, 2 tsp. vanilla extract, 1 tsp. almond extract, 3 tbls. milk, 2 tbls. marachino cherry juice and a little red food coloring paste. It turned out nice and fluffy and easy to spread. I made an angel food cake and wanted an icing that would complement it rather than taking over. Perfect!

Great recipe. I used it for my daughters birthday cake! My suggestion is to use water instead of milk and heat it up.  Add some salt to this water to dissolve and add to frosting.  This will cut down on the sweetness of the frosting alot.  I also add a little bit of almond extract.

Very easy recipe, however, I am not a fan! This buttercream is BY FAR the sweetest I have ever tasted, WAY too sweet for me and everyone else who ate the cake. I will make this again, but I plan on using about a cup less of confectioners sugar and all butter instead of shortening as the shortening is just not needed.

Very yummy, this frosting has a smooth texture that goes great on sugar cookies.  Make sure you use butter-flavored shortening though, or you'll lose out on flavor.

Pleasantly surprised!  Especially considering that I had no shortening, no vanilla, and leftover confectioner's sugar from last Christmas!  My trick: 1 1/2 sticks Imperial margarine, 1/2 tsp. almond extract, 3 1/2 cups confectioner's sugar, and 1 T. of 1% milk.  Not only was this version less greasy, but it has a very rich flavor and tastes like the icing my grandmother used to use on her cakes!  An easily adaptable recipe!

Made this frosting for a heart-shaped cake and of course, tinted it pink! I decreased the shortening by 1/4cup and increased the butter by same. The trick, as noted in other reviews is to let the mixer run and run! Very smooth and creamy frosting. It gets 5 stars for taste and ease of preparation. Makes a ton.

this recipe is good for cookies; after an hour or so, it dries enough so that cookies are stackable but stays soft inside so it's not crunchy like royal icing.  i added 1 tsp. almond essence & an extra splash of milk to make it more spreadable to frost the "best rolled sugar cookies," also from this website, and they tasted delicious.  note: if you're going to add sprinkles or other decorations on top of the icing, make sure you put them on immediately after spreading, or they won't stick.

I love this recipe and so does my whole family. The first time I made it it was too runny but still tasted good. Since then I have learned to use little milk as it calls for and wait before adding more. Makes a better spreading consistency. It is easy to color also.

This is the easiest, most delicious icing recipe I have ever tried.  It tastes so yummy and it is very easy to spread.  Using regular shortening makes it very white in color.  I would pass this along to every one I know looking for a great icing recipe!

Wow you guys weren't kidding.  I was looking for a better icing for my sugar cookies and came upon this recipe.  Two hours later I had 4 1/2 dozen iced and decorated cookies that probably won't last til tonite!!  The vanilla is correct in the recipe now at 1 tsp. and just add the sugar all at once.  Couple more Tbsp of milk makes it just perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a delicious icing.  I used only 2 cups of 10x sugar, 2tsp vanilla and 4T milk.  Not so sweet, but a great consistency.

This is the most amazingly close to professional frosting.   I used unsalted sweet cream butter,  gave it a little more sweeter taste and added fluff.

I first used this recipe for a 50th birthday party slab cake. It is light and fluffy and is the right consistency for professional looking cakes/cupcakes. Excellent icing for making roses. If you don't like the taste, cut down the shortening by 1/4 cup, while adding same amount to icing sugar total. Eliminating shortening in favour of all butter will make consistency of the icing soft. I have also replaced 2 TBSP icing sugar with cocoa powder to change from vanilla to chocolate icing.

Pretty good! My boyfriend loves buttercream frosting, so I was looking for a simple recipe to replace the usual canned frosting on my cupcakes. The texture of this was perfect, not greasy or too hard! I do think next time I'll either add a little salt or use salted butter--I know frosting is supposed to be sweet, but this basically just tasted like solidified powdered sugar. I think a hint of salt would complement it nicely.

It was no lie when the poster said that this taste JUST LIKE the frosting at the bakery.  I made 5 frostings in one day because I have nothing better to do and get tired of trying to figure out which frosting to make as the cake is sitting there sort of like a taste test thing.  Anyway, this is just like that frosting a lot smoother than some in my opinion.  It was good, did not add any color or any other flavor other than the vanilla. This was quick and easy and had a good balance of not too buttery or too greasy tasting.

It's came out pretty good, but as others recommended here I used shortening, but I replaced half shortening with cream cheese as we love it. So I ended up with 50/25/25% butter/ shortening/cream cheese. I also used half sugar (and for me it was still soooooo sweet:) ), and doubled vanilla extract. As I was going to decorate my cake with grass, I also found that adding 1 tsp of cream of tartar helps my cream to hold better.

I have used this recipe countless times and each time it comes out great!! I have used as written and I have used all butter which I like the best. When I use all butter I only use a little milk in the recipe like 1 teaspoon. It retains its stiffness to decorate with and holds up longer... I recommend a stand mixer and let it go for at least five minutes to make it fluffy and smooth ... also mix at high speed. Also, I add all of the sugar at one time and just mix. I mix it before adding the milk and then only add the little bit to make it smoother.

It's truly a buttercream frosting.  I made the recipe exactly as it appears and just made sure to use my Kitchenaid mixer and mix it for a long time.  It whipped to the right consistency.  I "liked" it but I was not thrilled with it.  I guess in my mind I was thinking that if I made buttercream frosting from scratch it would have a little more of a Homemade taste.  But it's just exactly the same as a bakery cake frosting and that's why I rated it a 4.  I agree with a previous poster that if you are going to rate a recipe, you have to rate it as is.  If you make all these changes, then it is YOUR recipe and not the person's who originlly shared it with us.

this is a great frosting that works for cakes.. add more milk for fluffier and less dense frosting. or keep it stiff for piping.

This is a great icing recipe.  For a twist on vanilla icing, substitute almond extract for the vanilla extract.  SO good!  If you want to make chocolate icing, just add 1/3 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder (and stick to the recipe as published).  Thanks!

I did not care for this recipe.  It's greasy, overly sweet, and has an unappealing taste. The only plus is that it does have a nice, creamy consistency.

I thought they were easy to make but extremely sweet. I would have done it with a little more vanilla and less sugar (maybe 3 and a half cups). They are good and creamy the first day but the next day the frosting becomes very stiff and u can feel the sugar a lot. So do it to eat the same day!

I did the recipe exactly how stated except I used coconut oil instead of shortening and add the sugar in 2 cups at a time. I mixed at high also. I had a few lumps but using a spoon to smash them I got most of them out. I probably had lumps because of the cocnut oil, I'm not sure. It was pretty good just a tad bit sweet to me so I'm thinking I'll probably use half the sugar next time.

Perfect frosting recipe.  Followed the recipe exactly and I prefer the butter/shortening combination.  Not too rich or too sweet.  Great on the One Bowl Chocolate Cake recipe from this site.

I gave this recipe five stars... The shortening was not too steong tasting to make it worth subing all butter... I live in Arizona and this buttercream did not melt on me when a warm breeze hit  it.

DE-LIC-IOUS!! I couldn't believe how simple this recipe was! The change I made was to the amount of sugar added, I only added 2 cups. This is definitely a keeper!!

Really good, easy to spread, tastes great, easy to make. Used just butter instead of the other 1/2 cup of shortening.

wooooo!!! This recipe is so easy to work with. Ive always cringed when clients ask for buttercream decorations because I find fondant much easier to use, but this frosting might be just the thing to finally make me learn buttercream roses (maybe).

I also changed it up a bit by using only unsalted butter 1 cup and no shortening.  Instead of using milk I used 1/2 & 1/2.  This turned out wonderful. If you are going to make cookies, don't skimp on the frosting!!

My first time making icing....SO easy!!! I used the 4cups of sugar...too sweet for my taste....will make another batch for my daughter's class but will only use 2.5 to 3 cups. The other reviews are SO helpful because I would never "tweak" a recipe without input from others with experience!

This frosting was really great. I am in sugar overload !  I did as one reviewer suggested and used all butter, no shortening. I also used heavy whipping cream instead of milk.

Word of caution though. If you are frosting a 2 layer cake, you need to double the recipe.  I made this with 4 cups of powdered sugar and it was not enough to frost my homemade checkerboard cake. I only had enough to do the top of the cake.  I was out of butter and so for a finish, I made homemade ganache and poured it over the whole cake.

This icing has the perfect texture to work on a cake with, nice and soft... and the good part is it stays soft even after a night in the frig. It is a tad sweet though, nothing a glass of milk doesn't fix.

Tried this recipe today for my grandma's birthday cake. how embarrassing! the obvious flavor of shortening was really terrible. it tasted like bad store bought frosting. i really don't understand the high ratings for this recipe. i am assuming people just changed the recipe and gave it a 5. i followed it exactly how it should be and was very unhappy.

this frosting worked really well for a rapunzel themed birthday cake i made for my daughter's 5th birthday.  i used the shortening and butter mix as the recipe called for, despite many reviewers recommending all butter.  i think the consistency was perfect for piping and decorating as written.  i quadrupled the recipe, which would have called for 16 cups of sugar - i only used 12 and it was PLENTY sweet.  i can't handle the instant toothache of most frostings, and even as i made it i thought it could have done well with less sugar.  regardless, it held up really nicely for decorating, and my kids definitely enjoyed the taste.  thanks!

I have been trying to find the perfect buttercream icing that is good for decorating as well as icing. If anyone has one and would like to share that wopuld be great!!!!!!!!!!
   This wasn't it. I had to put the cake in the fridge so the icing wouldn't melt off. The taste was OK it tasted more buttery, verses my old recipe that tasted like all sugar. I did use all butter and no shortening which probably made the taste better
   I also need the perfect birthday cake recipe. I have been using a butter cake, but it is really dense and not really a cake for kids. If anyone has any suggestions that would be great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Following the recipe exactly leads to a very sugary icing - I would recommend reducing the amount of confectioners sugar by half if not more.   yeah.  Overall the ingredients list is nice and simple and it comes together very quickly.  And I also recommend using all butter.

I only gave this three stars, because even though it tasted great, using all butter caused it to melt fast when trying to pipe it. The heat from my hands was turning it to liquid quick. I had to keep freezing it and putting the cake in the fridge to prevent it from running, and many of the details on the tips did not show, like for the edge ripples and that. Great for a simple frosting but I don't suggest it for piping or decorating with bags at all!

Its a Really good frosting however i went all butter too; and used less sugar and a tiny bit of vanilla for flavor. For a little kick i added a bit of lemon zest like about one teaspoon (around there) and it tasted great. For a chocolaty experience add some cocoa like maybe 1/2 cup to a full cup. Gr-eat recpie however if i were you i'd go all butter it's better and shortening is pigs fat so its not as healthy!

Great icing recipe. I got a lot of compliments on the taste of the icing. I made the recipe with half shortening and half butter. I think the shortening helped it to stand up better to piping. It took the color great too. I will use this recipe again and again. Very easy to make and use.

I tried this recipe with the butter only, and it didn't taste like I thought it would. It could be my fault for assuming it would taste different, and I used some food colouring that changed the flavor also. A little bland..

My goodness!!! This recipe is amazing!!!!! I have to say that I couldn't make the recipe as is. I used almond milk instead of regular milk, since my daughter doesn't do well with cow's milk, and it is WONDERFUL!!! My husband hates butter cream icing, but he loves this! so glad I tried it.

I cut the recipe in half, as I was using it to make chocolate chip sandwiches.  I also used only butter. Turned out delicious!

Since I cut the recipe in half, I used a LITTLE less than 2 cups of confectioners' sugar, as a lot of the reviews said it was really sweet.

Will definitely use again!

This was easy, but the end result was way too sweet as written.  It actually crunched a little when biting down due to all of the sugar.  I made it exactly as written, except I replaced the vanilla extract with vanilla bean paste (you get flecks of vanilla bean when you use this).  To save it and cut down on the sweetness, I added 3 more tablespoons of butter, a pinch of salt,  and 2 teaspoons of lemon extract.  I'll try another buttercream in the future.

Easy to make and tastes great!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fantastic!  I divided the batch and added melted and cooled chocolate chips to half of it for a chocolate buttercream which was also great!  This is my new 'go to' frosting recipe!

Awesome buttercream Icing!  I don't like using shortening, but I really don't like how over sweet & rich my usual buttercream was using all butter.  This is great if you like piping nice piles of beautiful frosting on top of your cupcakes & don't want the overwhelming rich/sugary flavor.  Thanks so much!!!

This recipe makes a yummy buttercream frosting that holds it shape perfectly and is great for piping.  I didnât think it needed any adjustments.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of sifting the powdered sugar.  This is a great go-to frosting.

Loved this icing! After reading reviews, I was tasting as I went with the powdered sugar. After adding three cups the icing tasted a little too sweet for me. I added 2 tbsp more milk and about an oz of cream cheese, just my personal preference. It turned out great. I used it for David's yellow cake (from this site) and colored some for piping. Delicious and versatile, thank you!

I love this recipe. It's easy to make, tastes great and looks perfect on my (wilton) doll cakes. I made the recipe as is, my shortening was butter flavored and I used a 1/2 cup of butter. I was able to pipe flowers on the doll cake as well as frost it. Perfect!! BIG THANKS!!

Terrific lasting, very light and easy to work with. 
I used all butter in mine, only 2.5 cups of sugar, a small drizzle of milk. I also added in 1/2 cup of melted chocolate chips amd it turned out fabulous. If your looking for light fluffy easy to work with icing, you've found it.

I thought the person who gave this a bad review was lying since everyone else rated it good, so I decided to give it a try...bad mistake. I don't know if it was the shortening but it had a bad taste. I would never make this again.

I also used all butter each time I made this.  It's a family favorite.  By the way, we only have skim milk at our house and it works great.

I made this exactly as written but needed a little extra milk and I put this icing on a dark chocolate cupcake. My kids both thought the combination tasted like an oreo cookie. Wonderful!!!

I am making a giant care bear cake for my daughter's birthday tomorrow. Originally I started out making cream cheese frosting- but I ran out of cream cheese, and I needed another batch of frosting. I am about to pipe this on as the final layer. Just to compare the two- this recipe is much sweeter. I added the full 4 cups of powdered sugar, and one more tablespoon of milk. Oh- and I used all butter like others have suggested. I don't like the "flavor" of shortening in frosting. This is a great frosting recipe- the flavor is good as well as the consistency. I would however, still use the cream cheese variety, this recipe is a tad bit sweet to have my vote. But it is great tonight, I needed this recipe and it didn't fail me. Thanks for a great frosting!

Great Icing w/a little tweak. I found that when using a icing gun, two tablespoons of milk was not enough to keep the icing creamy enough when tubing. So I just added more milk until it was the consistency I wanted. Tasted great and looked great.

Great recipe - very easy and quick.  I used all butter just because I am not a fan of the shortening after-taste and it turned out delicious.  I split the recipe in half after it was mixed and mixed in about 1/4 c. Trader Joes Org. Choc syrup and the other about 3 Tbs. Raspberry preserves and piped them on our cupcakes.  Very yummy and the light mocha and light raspberry colors together made for a pretty presentation.

Its hard to rate this actual recipe because I modified it quite a bit based on some other reviewers comments.  But the end result was very yummy.  I used only 2.5 cups of sugar.  I doubled the vanilla because we love it.  I used all butter instead of shortening.  It took a lot more milk as well.  I used approx. 4 Tbsp of milk.  Beat it for quite a while to get a nice smooth and light consistency.

I followed the recipe/directions exactly and it's perfect! i dont think it's too sweet like the canned icing that you buy at the store, but thats a good thing! i've tried a couple buttercream recipes before and this is the best. its great for frosting and its stiff enough that you can pipe it and it wont run all over the place. i also added some cinnamon for my cinnamon cupcake and it was perfect.

I liked this, although I did tweak it a little. I put 3 cups of powdered sugar and 4-5 tablespoons of milk. It turned out wonderful for a cake.  I did use both the shortening and butter and found that as long as you mixed it really well, it didn't have any funny taste to it.

Easy recipe, delicious results. ...well i used margerine since i didn't have shortening; just make sure neither of them are too soft that they melted a tiny bit. i thought it wouldn't make a difference , but it did. No problem, just tasted a little too buttery, my fault though.  4 *'s

NEVER put shortening into a buttercream recipe! This recipe is good if you use all butter but as is with the shortening. Shortening gives the icing a greasy texture & flavor.  I wish I would've listened to my brain before making up a batch.  If you already made it but don't want to waste it, add some flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and a couple eggs and make soft sugar cookies.   I'm usually have such good luck with Allrecipes, but this one was so disappointing.

I took the advice of using all butter instead of using some shortening.  I also added more sugar (1/4 c more) to cut down some of the butteriness of the frosting.  Thank you for sharing a great buttercream frosting recipe!

I made this icing for a red velvet cake. Let me tell you one thing. This was not a good choice for me and here are my reasons. One, the ingredients listed were not enough to coat a 3 to 4 layer cake. Two the icing would cause the cake to break up into little bits and the cake would eventually fall to little bits. Third the icing was to sweet. 4 cups of confectioners sugar was way too much and way above the limit. This is a one star and i would never make this again!

I loved this icing.  Made it for cupcakes I took to a party today, I'd call it a success.  I did add a little almond extract and because of the little bit of extra liquid I added an additional 1/2 cup of sugar.  This is going to be my new go-to icingrecipe.  Thanks!

I added two more TBS butter, deducted two TBS shortening.  I want a firmer frosting so I added only 1 TSP milk.  Very good frosting!

This is the only butter cream frosting recipe I use. I recently discovered that if you use sweet cream butter instead of regular butter,  it tastes even better! I couldn't believe the difference the sweet cream made! If you like a sweet frosting you have to try it.

I make this probably once a week and it is always perfect! I do use all butter and leave out the shortening when using it on cupcakes -  When decorating cakes, I use half shortening half butter. awesome recipe, thanks!

This was such a wonderful buttercream icing recipe! I followed the recipe exactly, except I reduced the confectioner's sugar to three cups. I  used the shortening/butter mix, instead of all butter as many reviewers suggested and thought the taste was great! I think even with the 4 cups of sugar, the taste would still have been wonderful. It's just a matter of how sweet you want your icing. I just have to say that I will NEVER ever look at the prepared icing again after this recipe. I tossed all the ingredients in at one time into my mixer and it was DONE in a few minutes! Thank you so much!

This is perfect!  I did use all butter instead of shortening, just because I like the texture the butter gives it.  It fluffs wonderfully and sets great on cookies!

this is the recipe I use in my cake business, just on a larger scale.  It is very good, not too sweet and my clients prefer it to traditional American Buttercream.

This is my go-to frosting for vanilla/yellow cakes. I absolutely love it, and my friends rave about it and make me put it on everything I bake :). I follow the recipe exactly, wouldn't change a thing! Pipes great and tastes amazing!

I just used this recipe to frost applesauce spice cupcakes and this frosting is the best I've ever made!  My mom had me add a small pinch of salt to the mixture.  I used only butter, no shortening,  and added 3 cups of sugar, not 4 (thanks to all of the reviews I read here today).  I added 1.5 tsp of vanilla extract and ended up needing 2 tablespoons of milk to make the frosting the perfect consistency for my little plastic gizmo from the dollar store that allowed me to pipe out stars of frosting all over the tops of the cupcakes.  I put a Craisin in the center dollop of frosting (I uploaded a photo today, too) and my cupcakes look bakeshop ready if I do say so myself, ha ha.  My dinner guests this evening are in for quite a treat!  I will definitely use this frosting in the future.  It's spectacular!

If I could give it more stars, I would. I only had butter flavored shortening, so I couldn't make white (or off-white icing), but between the butter & the butter flavored shortening, there was such a LUSCIOUS and RICH flavor here. I used less sugar than called for, and I made a chocolate version as well, subbing chocolate powder for part of the sugar measurement I was using. I sifted my powdered sugar, but I'm not sure it was necessary, because I whipped it so long with the hand-mixer anyway that I think there would not have been lumps even so. It sets up nice, and stays soft and delicious (in covered containers, not refrigerated). I had no idea I could make such a delicious frosting at home! Thanks very much, I'll use this many more times!

This recipe is quick to make and delicious. I recommend using whole milk, I've done it with 2% and the icing with whole milk was much better. I also don't like my icing very fluffy, and if you don't either I suggest letting it sit after mixing it for about 1/2 hour before spreading on cupcakes (or whatever you're making).

Great recipe!!  I added about 2/3 of the recommended sugar, and used all butter (rather than butter/shortening)...and everyone loved it!  Consistency was great & taste was very smooth.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe!  I did make a few changes after reading other reviews.  I did 3/4c butter and 1/4c shortening and added cocoa powder because my daughter wanted chocolate frosting for her cupcakes.  It was sooo good.  My son begged for another spoonful after I let him taste it.

For the recipe, I didn't have any shortening so I just used all butter. I found that the recipe needed a little more vanilla, so I added a half a teaspoon more. I also agree with some of the others and felt that it was a little too sweet. Next time I am going to use 1/4 cup less sugar. But overall, great recioe. And I will probably use this recipe again.

Curiosity made me interested in this as I had never made a buttercream with shortening.  Definitely will not ever do again.... buttercream frosting is much better with butter only.  Only good thing about this was that it was fluffier than if made with all butter.  It had so much of a shortening taste, that I added cocoa to make it a chocolate frosting instead.

This was the perfect recipe to use on my cupcakes which I took to a park and left sitting on a picnic table for over 6 hours in low 80s temperature.  No melting because of the shortening and it still tasted good with the butter in it.  It was even better when I added cocoa powder to the butter/shortening to make a chocolate buttercream icing.

This is a really good basic recipe. Personally, I have to disagree with the top reviewers about omitting the shortening. I've made this both ways, but yesterday I decided to follow the advice of the top two reviewers and use all butter. I was highly disappointed. The shortening is a must if you're looking for that bakery icing taste!!!!!  Four cups is a lot of sugar, so depending on how sweet you like your icing, this can easily be adjusted. I opt for 1.5 tsp of vanilla. Adding more milk causes this to be runnier, and if you're using it for decorating, I'd hesitate to do it.

I used all butter because I did not have shortening and it turned out wonderful.  It is so good after it sits on the cake overnight!!  I added some unsweetened cocoa to ice a chocolate cake.

I get a little tickled reading the reviews that find this icing "too sweet". Isn't icing supposed to be sweet?  ;)  Anyway, my family loved this icing.  I followed the recipe as stated, and it turned out very similar to bakery icing.  The texture and taste was terrific.  Kudos for a great recipe!

This is the absolute best icing!! It is very easy to make and my 12 year old even made it herself.  She doesn't like store bought frostings but she does like this icing.  The only one I will be using from now on.  Thanks to whoever put it on here.

Very easy to make & tasted delicious. It had a milder buttercream taste which we loved. I've also tried this using various other extracts (cherry, lemon, etc.) & they were wonderful as well.

I made a few changes: used all butter, reduced the amount of sugar (only used 3 cups) and doubled the vanilla (2 tsps).  Halving the recipe made enough for 24 cupcakes and still had a little left over.  Will be using it again definitely, thanks!

I tweak it a little by adding half a capful of orange extract.  It balances out the flavors and gives a nice citrus-vanilla flavor.  This icing is hard to get perfectly smooth but is great in a pinch and the ingredients are easy to keep on hand.  It also pipes really well and if you use 1C shortening, instead of 1/2 shortening 1/2 butter, you can make perfect roses that do not "wilt".

I halved the recipe but followed it to tee. It was too sweet and all you could taste was the fat. I made this for my son's 1st birthday party and it was not well received. The kids didn't even touch the cake and the adults scraped the icing off. Will not make again. I would recommend looking for another "buttercream" icing recipe.

I used this icing for a friends baby shower cake (pictured) and it turned out fantastic. I was a tad bit sweet so i think i might cut back the sugar a bit next time but other then that. I also used all butter but for those that want to use the crisco, they do have a butter flavored which would go really well with this recipe! Thanks so much!!

This was great! I used all butter like others suggested and everyone in my house loved it! My brother said it was like eating warm vanilla ice cream, best frosting he'd ever had :)

awesome flavor.  Mixed for at least 10 min and that made a huge difference in taste.  Used 1/4 cup shortening, 3/4 cup butter.

This recipe is AWESOME! I used to work for a bakery and wanted a recipe just like the one they used for their butter cream ... THIS IS IT! I used all butter, no shortening, only 3/4 the amount of sugar, and only half the amount of milk. The butter cream turned out quite smooth, fairly white, and just tasted amazing. Thanks!

Great buttercream recipe, I only needed 1/4 of what this recipe called for so I adjusted accordingly. I scooped the finished product into a candymaking melting bottle and melted the icing a bit and then decorated a giant chocolate chip cookie with it. Worked perfectly.

The best buttercream icing. It is fail proof. I mix the coloring in before adding the liquids. ( I am in Europe and you can only get liquid food coloring). I also add orange or lemon zest. The kids love it. Great for school.

This recipe whips pretty nicely, but it's far too sweet in my opinion.  Should've followed others recommendations, but I like to try to do the original recipe first to give it a REAL rating based on the actual recipe that was given.  I know buttercream icing is supposed to be sweet, but this was a little much I think.

This recipe is very simple. I use this on my 3D stand-up cakes, and every birthday cake. I do use real butter. I have tried using margerine, and it is not that great. I don't change the amount of sugar, because it has a perfect taste at 4 cups. I would suggest to double the recipe if you are using it on a 3D stand-up cake. That way, you will be free to work with as much as you want.

This has been my go to frosting recipe for years.  We've noticed recently, that since the "no trans fat" trend, Crisco changed their formula and this frosting doesn't come out the way it used to.  I'm going to try the all butter version today to see if that helps with the consistency and spreading problems we've been having.  Otherwise, I'm going to have to find a new recipe after 20 years of using this one.

The buttercream icing was great but with 3 1/2 cups of sugar was really sweet so I just didn't use the other 1/2 cup and it was on point.

I love this recipe.  It's the one I turn to whenever I need to make a cake, cupcakes or cookies.  Everyone loves it.  I usually use less powdred sugar than is called for though, or it is way too sweet.

Typically I don't review recipes if I change ingredients, but I had to this time! This was the yummiest buttercream I've ever made!! These were my changes - only butter, Silk instead of milk, and a little bit of marishino cherry juice. Yu-hu-hum! Half a recipe is more than enough to frost 6 jumbo cupcakes, so I would assume 12 regular ones.

I prefer this recipe with butter only, I didn't get all of the 4 cups of sugar in it. I agree with using heavy cream instead of milk. It gave it a much smoother consistency. I love the flavor. I made my cake and ate the rest of the frosting on graham crackers. Makes a great treat for the kids!

Very good icing for what it is....super easy to make!  I used only 3 cups of sugar (no need to beat after each cup) and doubled the amount of vanilla.  The end result was perfect for icing mini valentine cupcakes for my son's daycare!

Yummy! I used this exactly as the recipe says except I used heavy whipping cream instead of milk. (I love cream.)I needed 6 tablespoons to make it nice and fluffy. I divided the cream and added coacoa powder to one bowl to put in the middle of my cake. It was delicious, will definitely use this recipe again!

This recipe is on the wilton baking website!  It is fantastic.  I usually use vanilla sugar instead of extract beacuse I like the taste better.  You can add more milk and use it to glaze yeast coffee cakes. I recommend to whip it for as long as you have patience so it will be nice and fluffy.

This is Wilton's Buttercream Icing Recipe.  It's a classic, and it's good.  The Crisco is important, it definitely helps with smoothing.

This is a very nice frosting. I really played around with it. First used it as a thicker frosting to spread on cookies, then divided it into cups, colored each different with a couple drops of food coloring and thinned each one out. I used juice from a fresh orange to thin one, juice from a lemon for the other, this gave the frosting a zingy and different flavor and I was able to 'drizzle' the thinned frosting over the cookies. The thinned frosting doesn't set up as firmly, but I left it thick enough to firm up just fine for the cookies not needing stacking.

This recipe is easy and delicious. I used crisco butter flavored shortening and it was perfect. Great flavor and consistancy. I will definitely use it again and again.

I'll never understand why people completely change a recipe and then rate it. I gave this 5 stars based upon the actual recipe. I found the consistency to be perfect. Fluffy while still having great presence and really complementing the cake. Not overly sweet...pretty much a really solid frosting recipe. One that could easily be flavored with other extracts if desired.

Loved this recipe. So easy! I made a half batch using only butter no shortening like others suggested. It was also a great recipe to use with cannabis butter!

Used this when making cupcakes for a Christmas party.  
Like a favorite recipe I used years ago and was hoping to find again.  Success.

I made the buttercream frosting recipe, but used a full cup of butter and used no shortening. I used the paddle attachment on the mixer and beat the butter and added the vanilla extract and also added the seeds of an entire vanilla bean - scraped. I sifted all four cups of confectioners sugar into the bowl - whew! It seemed like it would be too much, but my family and friends went absolutely crazy for the frosting. It pipes easily and smoothly and looks beautiful with an open star tip. It's a recipe that can be easily modified for different flavors - it's my new favorite frosting!

It worked really well as a base recipe, but it's really sweet for my taste. Also, I had to double the milk because I didn't want my icing to be too thick. It was pretty good overall, I would just suggest less sugar if you aren't very sweet tongued.

I have made this recipe many many times.  It's not overly sweet like recipes that do not have butter in them.  I also suggest using all butter instead of some shortening; however, it you're in a high humidity area, use the shortening as it holds up better in those conditions.  Time to make more frosting!

Very respectable little buttercream that came together in no time!  I added a pinch more vanilla to counteract the confectioner's sugar taste.

This is the best recipe I've ever used for butter cream I use the exact recipe. I have always had an issue with the frosting setting up the same each time this recipe is fool proof. I have made it three times and now I add different extract to change the flavor. My family has dairy allergies so I use almond milk for a substitution worked perfect

I made the recipe exactly as directed except doubled the vanilla. It came out perfectly. However to frost a layer cake (by my standards at least) would will need to double this or at least add 50% more. Texture and consistency were perfect. Next time I think I will add a little almond flavoring to mix it up, would make a great wedding cake icing. Super easy! The recipe didn't specify but I did sift the sugar.

Used all butter and added a little more milk. Super yummy and great on the birthday cake I made! Only thing is that I barely had enough frosting for my entire 9 in cake. I think doubling the recipe would've given me way too much, but maybe adding half more would've been perfect.

100 stars!!! Followed it to a T except I put extra 2 tsp of milk just because I wanted it thin... Makes enough for two 13x9 pan size cakes. My whole family LOVED it will definitely use this from now on, I HIGHLY recommend!!!

First of all... I don't like buttercream frosting, my husband on the other hand LOVES it!  He asked for a cake tonight so I was looking for a simple quick easy recipe.  I read the reviews for this and thought I'd give it a try.  I was concerned about the shortening thinking that might make it greasy or heavy... MY mistake!  I used about 3 cups of sugar instead of 4 and it is awesome.  I just frosted the cake and was actually eating the leftovers off the spatula, remember I said I didn't like buttercream.  I loved this!! It was quick, simple, easy and absolutely yummy.  Thanks so much :)

This was wonderful!  My previous attempts at homemade icing had not gone well, but this recipe came together perfectly with no tweaking.  I've used it on cupcakes and to make sandwiches out of homemade graham crackers.  It takes my baked goods to the next level when they have homemade icing.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I was hesitate about making my own icing, but this was super easy and a huge hit. I was able to easily ice my cake and make my first decorative flowers for the top (thanks Youtube). Will be saving this recipe for future cakes and cupcakes. I followed the recipe as written.

I followed this recipe exactly and loved it! I wanted to frost 24 cupcakes. I wasn't sure if one batch would be enough so I doubled it and had waaaay to much. One batch would have been plenty. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

A-MA-ZING.  I followed this recipe exactly the way it said and I LOVED the outcome.  I used salted butter and I don't taste the shortening at all. Seriously, I could sit with a spoon and a bowl of this frosting and just go to town.  It's that good.  And to think I bought mass produced tub icing for so many years; this is SO much better and SOOO quick and easy!!  This will be my go-to recipe when I need frosting for anything!!

THIS WAS THE EASIEST WAY OF MAKING IT.... Very yummy... Those who want to just be lazy and throw it all together go ahead... But I followed this way and used country crock and it was awesome....(JUST REMEMBER YOUR BUTTER NEEDS TO BE ROOM TEMP...):-)... Thank you !!!! Will try more soon...:-)

I have made this recipe as is and using all butter, as recommended by other users.  I like it both ways; however, I prefer it with 3 cups of powdered sugar per batch rather than 4, otherwise it tends to get too sweet.  If you are icing a cake, you will need to at LEAST double the recipe!  My choice was 4 or 5 stars, and 5 stars is much more accurate than 4...I would probably rate this at 4.5+ stars.

I tried the recipe and followed the ingredients an steps as asked!!! WOW! It was amazing I tastes and looks like the Pillsbury Whipped Icing.... I actually whipped it instead of just blending it and it taste much light and it is super Good... I've read that for some of you'll it seemed runny and not smooth as long as you follow the steps trust me there is no way you cant get it right; and its good for cupcakes, cakes, etc. So Yeah I give this recipe a Five Star Rating

Tastes just like the local cupcakery's buttercream. I used all butter, and it tasted great. My only problem is it is not thick enough. It may be my fault for nearly melting the butter, I'll have to try again.

An easy recipe. If your live in the tropics it is better to use the exact recipe to avoid melting or use pure butter flavored shortening. Add cocoa powder or instant coffee or both for other flavoring.

I made a double batch for a large scale baking project. I have used all butter recipes for buttercream before and it's just too sweet. That is why I picked this one to try. I didn't wind up adding as much milk for a double batch. I also did half vanilla and half almond extract because I didn't want the taste of vanilla to be too strong either. I used this for  both spreading and piping and it was fine. I also find that if you sift the confectioner's sugar before you mix it, it gives a smoother consistency. I used this recipe to frost some cupcakes and a small 9" cake for my son's 4th birthday. He liked them just fine! It goes well with the heavenly white cake recipe!

Great recipe, though I prefer all butter instead of half shortening. Also, I use evaporated milk (though regular is fine too).

I really like it, but I used less confectioners sugar.  I have a problem with my sugar.  Using less made it very easy for spreading.  I also made it another time and put some cocoa powder in it for a chocolate flavor and it was great.

This is my go-to frosting recipe. I have done it both ways, with shortening and all butter, and for my purposes - just a thick layer on a cake, nothing fancy - I like it better with all butter. Definitely beat it on high for a couple of minutes to make it fluffy, too. Terrific!

This recipe is great.  If you use all butter it's definitely richer, but it's still really good.  I did it the half and half way and everyone at work really liked it because they said it wasn't too heavy.  If you're just making a flat 9x13 cake, half the recipe, otherwise you'll end up with a whole lot leftover.

Following the recommendations of others I used all butter (1 stick salted, 1 stick unsalted) and followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it turned out really good but a little too sweet.  I will definitely make this recipe again but I will start with 3 cups of sugar and add more to taste.

I love this recipe!!!  I used all butter and added 1/2 teaspoon almond extract as well as the vanilla.  Next time I will either use no almond extract or less because it overpowered the taste.  But still - very good icing!

This is my go to frosting now, not too buttery but you can taste it. I have used it on cakes and cookies alike, I have tweaked it for a stiffer frosting as well. I love it.

Spot on and perfect.  I did it very close to recipe.  I put in 3 cups of the sugar and added from there until I reached the consistency I was searching for.  Huge hit with the kids and I made it Gluten Free.

Made with all butter. Double vanilla. 2.5c sugar. 1TB milk.
--My hot hands make the frosting "melty" but not so bad that I couldn't get "average" piped flowers.
--Taste is not bad, I sortof like it. Less "buttery" though might have been better tasting.
--Just wish it could stay out, fridging makes it bit more harder.

tastes good but horrible. made it exactly to a T. Way to soft and runny. Very sweet and didnt want to add more sugar. added flour. still way to soft. I'm dissapointed because a good cake for someone's birthday got screwed up. I've decorated cakes for years.. I've never had a problem with icing before.

Great recipe! My cousin manages a bakery at a local grocery store and she even asked for the recipe. Said it was just like the buttercream Icing at the store. Only thing I changed was used all butter instead of shortening as the reviews suggest and I doubled the milk. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is one of the easiest buttercream frostings - I rarely use milk tho preferring to use water instead. I also do a split of 1/2 tsp vanilla extract & 1/2 tsp butter extract for a pleasing combination.

4 c. sugar is indeed too much.  I thought even 3 was too much.  The buttercream I am used to is much smoother and not so sugary.

Used 3 tblsp heavy whipping cream instead of milk, all butter (no shortening), 2tsp of vanilla extract, and 2.5C of sugar and thought the frosting was AMAZING- 5 stars easily... but I'm only giving 4 because the amount of every ingredient had to be changed!

Excellent icing.  Easy to spread.  Stiff enough to use for decorating.  Doesn't have to be refrigerated.  This is similar to a recipe that I received in a cake decorating class.  The main difference was the one from the class used less vanilla extract and added other flavorings.  It called for 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, 1 tsp almond extract, and 1/2 tsp lemon extract for this amount of frosting.

This recipe would be great if I had went with my gut instinct and used all butter, instead of half shortening/half butter. The flavor was terrible.  The texture was great though, very visually appealing.

I'm not sure why people changed this recipe (which by the way makes it no longer this recipe) but I thought it was really good!  I'm not a huge icing fan but this is one I will make again in the future. They only let you rate up to 5 stars but I give it 10 stars!

I started off using only butter but didn't think that the amount would be enough for my cake (I was wrong) so I added to it and didn't have any more  room temp butter so decided to use shortening and I liked the texture and the flavor was still very good.

Wonderful recipe!  I did use all butter instead of the shortening simply because I don't like shortening.  However, I think either way would be fine.  This frosting is easy to make and has a wonderful old fashioned taste.  I also used it to decorate the cake with a decorating bag and tip and it worked great.  This will definitely be my go-to recipe for butter cream frosting.

This is a great recipe- except for the sweetness. I used all butter, and other than that, I made it according to the directions, and once I tasted the icing, it was far too sweet. I ended up adding a lot more butter and milk until it was a little less sweeter. Add more milk for a fluffier mixture. I added a vanilla bean to my icing. It was great on my Simple White Cake (also from this site). I would suggest cutting the sugar down by 1 or 2 cups, and using all butter.

I've made this icing several times now. I use half butter and half crisco. And about 3 cups confectioners sugar instead of 4.  Tonight I made it for cupcakes and added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of baking cocoa to make chocolate icing. Tastes very good and the kids approved! This recipe is a keeper! Thanks Sharon! :)

This was an easy recipe. I took the majority of the reviews decision to use all butter and no shortening. It came out awesome. I made a 18x20 sheet pan and 3D duck. I used the servings configuring tool, and I wasted a lot of frosting. It is better to have too much than too little.

Super good...not too overpowering.  I will definitely use all butter next time.  I just threw all ingredients in together and whipped away (slowly at first...didn't need a face full of sugar, lol).  It was easy and quick...what could be better?

I made four batches of this to frost a TON of cupcakes for a large baby shower and it was great! I piped it on the cupcakes and it set up and held its shape perfectly. Yes, it was sweet, but it tasted the way good quality frosting should, IMHO. Thanks for sharing an easy but wonderful recipe.

This recipe is fantastic!!  I used it as icing for mini cupcakes for a birthday party.  Was so creamy, and easy to pipe onto the cupcakes.  Everyone raved about it.  Will definitely be using this as my go to icing.  The only thing I would do differently is maybe making a half batch as it makes enough to probably decorate at least 3 dozen cupcakes.

I made this recipe to use for decorating and sticking fondant onto my cake. It worked ok..I just wish it was a little thicker. Also I was disappointed when I tried to add the food coloring(paste type) that it didnt blend well...the butter cream icing had a marble coloring effect..I think I will try another recipe next time

This was too sweet for us as is.  I added some cream cheese to cut it a bit and it was really good, creamy and still held up to piping.  I will try this again using more cream cheese in place of the shortening and cut the sugar back.

I used this recipe for my first attempt at making my own homemade icing.  I took the advice of some others reviewers and used all butter, no shortening and only 3 cups of sugar. My family thought the icing was too sweet. I think next time I'll do butter and shortening like the recipe calls for and stay with using only 3 cups of sugar.

So easy and quite delicious!  I doubled the recipe and had more than enough to frost 48 cupcakes.  I also used all butter and only 7 cups of confectioner's sugar.  Dyed the icing dark purple and it is delicious!  Can't wait for the party tonight so everyone can taste them!

This recipe is creamy with a silky mouthfeel.  I used all butter (what I had on hand) and half and half instead of milk (again, what I had on hand).  I also only used a little over 3 cups of sugar, since my cupcakes were very sweet by themselves.  This recipe made enough to frost 24 cupcakes and had extra leftover.  Good enough to eat right off the beaters!

This frosting tastes great.  I did use 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter because I wanted the frosting to hold its shape and look great as I was giving cupcakes as Valentine's Day gifts.  It looked fantastic.  The taste was very good but yes, it was a little 'waxy' because of the shortening.  So, if you don't need the frosting to hold its shape and look great, use butter and it will taste slightly better.  But with shortening it will taste slightly waxy but excellent taste anyway and look great.  One more thing - I used only 3 cups of sugar.

I got loads of compliments on this frosting so I will definitely be using this recipe in the future.

I made a half batch of this with all butter, an extra 1/8 cup of sugar and a couple of large strawberries. It came out a lovely pink with mild berry flavor. So nice to not have artificial colors in your "happy cakes", as my toddler calls them.

OH MY GOD. AMAZING! I use this recipe any time I need a great icing for my cupcakes, and it's perfect. I didn't use the shortening and instead used all butter. It's really easy to put any type of colouring in, and I recommend it to anyone who needs a perfect, easy, and fast icing recipe.

Use all butter, as many reviewers apparently recommended.  As a stand alone recipe, two stars, it is entirely too dense to work with.  I does not spread and tastes just like powdered sugar (which by itself I do not care for).  Other recipes call for significantly more milk and less sugar, which I will do next time.

This recipe is great and so easy! I followed other reviewers recommendations and used all butter instead of shortening - fabulous. Otherwise, I prepared it exactly as written, and it was great. I don't know what's up with those other reviewers, using less sugar because it's "too sweet." That's crazy talk! It's icing, for crying out loud. It's SUPPOSED to be sweet. And yes, it is very, very sweet, but it's wonderful. Made icing my cupcakes super easy. This was my first try at making my own icing, and I'm so glad to have found a winner from the get-go. I will never buy canned icing again!

i used all butter, and substituted about 1/4 of the icing sugar for brown sugar (and added a dash of corn starch). i never measure my vanilla, so i'm not sure how much i put in, but i know i added extra.  this icing is so buttery and creamy. i love it!  although the brown sugar gave it a mocha color, it colored easily with food coloring. This time, I am making a jack-o-lantern cake, but if i were to use it for a normal cake/cupcakes, i wouldn't use food coloring at all! the color was quite nice.

Great recipe for cake decorating. I made my son's Spongebob birthday cake with this and it worked beautifully. I used the butter flavored Crisco in the can, andI was out of vanilla and used almond extract instead and it was still delicious!

This icing is tasty and easy to work with! I added a little bit of almond extract to give it a little more flavor. I found that if you're going to color this icing it becomes a little too soft if you also add the milk. The second batch I made I doubled the recipe, but only had to use about 6 1/2 cups of powdered sugar to achieve the desired consistency.

Sooo good!  I agree, all you need is the butter, skip the shortening.  Used the icing for chocolate cupcakes and they were awesome!

This was so easy to make, and was pretty tasty. Not the best buttercream icing I've ever had, but when you're just looking to throw something together quickly, this one will definitely do the trick!

This was my first time trying homemade icing. I followed other reviewer suggestions and used 1 cup of butter and it turned out awesome. I had enough to icing 24 cupcakes with 2 layers of icing on each. Will definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe, but I had to cut on the sugar. I used 2 cups of sugar, all butter and doubled the vanilla.  The only downside is that because I used all butter, icing stated to melt. So I am thinking to use 1/4 cup of shortening next time to see if that holds it together for longer, I will use then 3/4 cups of butter. I also added one extra tbsp of milk and 4 drops of coloring, it turned out perfect!

This is the very same recipe that I was taught to use in my cake decorating class.  Make sure your shortening is fresh and not over 6 months old.  I usually buy a small can of shortening before I make this recipe.  It's hard for me to not eat several spoonfulls of it.  :-)

I think that this recipe is GREAT! It tastes great and frezzes and defrosts well. I used it on some cup cakes for a pot luck and added a little coloring and it looked BEAUTIFUL!!! Great texture, didn't dry out very easily, super easy to make!

Since reading other reviews, I agree..cut out the shortening! It leaves it creamy and extremely easy to work with. I had made 2 batches and with one batch added cocoa, it was perfect. :)

Perfect, much? I had to quickly throw together some sort of icing for a chocolate cake. This was the first icing I stumbled on, and what luck! I added the milk in a little too early, and I shrunk the recipe by half. Otherwise, I could not ask for anything more.

This was my first attempt at a buttercream frosting, as well as my first attempt at baking a cake from scratch.  I tried the Simple White Cake recipe submitted by SCOTTOSMAN.  It all turned out perfectly!  I didn't agree with some of the other reviews that the frosting was too sweet...although for some other cakes it might be.  I used the full 4 cups powdered sugar, added another teaspoon vanilla, and used 1/2 cup margarine because I didn't have real butter handy.  I did use the shortening as the recipe called for, and it tasted great!  I think the shortening helps keep the frosting from separating. For anyone concerned about the flavor, just use butter flavored shortening.  Thanks for sharing the recipe...will definitely make again!

Awesome. I used all butter and halved the recipe for 12 cupcakes. I used 3 cups as the base for the sugar, so I used 1 1/2 cups for half of the recipe.

I used raspberry instead of the vanilla because I was making a cake with raspberry filling.  Needed to add a touch more of milk so it was easier to spread over the two layers of cake.  Everyone loved the taste of it and I loved how easy it was to to make!  Thanks!

This ButterCream Icing is out of this world! it is the easiest Icing out there! and the Taste is incredibly delicious! Very sweet! I would recommend this type of Icing for Birthdays or Cupcakes or for anyone who's looking for a very sweet Icing. For more taste you can go ahead and add extra vanilla extract depending how much you like vanilla!  I by nature have a sweet tooth, so if you or your kids love sweets this is a perfect recipe if you don't like sweets much then this isn't a good recipe since it's so sweet, but by adding less confectioner's sugar and a bit more milk it should take some of the sweetness a way, but not fully. I love this recipe!!!

Absolutely fantastic! I can never find a good buttercream recipe but I was very pleased with this one. I listened to all the reviews and used all butter instead of shortening. I also used a bit more vanilla and a little less milk and the consistancy was perfect.

This is the wilton recipe for butter cream frosting, and although it is good, it is much better with all butter. I use this recipe for all of the cakes I make.  I make character cakes, wedding cakes and you name it. If you use all butter it is  great tasting and great for decorating!!

This recipe saved my daughter's first birthday cake!  I had bought some pre-packaged "just add water" buttercream icing, which promptly dripped off the cake... I made this icing, and it was the perfect consistancy.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Easy and so deliciously good, tastes like out of a jar! I like making my own icing because store bought has soooo much trans fat! So with this recipe insted of using 1/2 cup crisco and 1/2 cup of butter I just used 1 cp butter flavored natural crisco and left out the butter. Turned out great!!!

This icing is wonderful. I usually just use a cream cheese icing when I make a cake but I wanted to actually decorate the cake so the cream cheese icing wouldn't work. My husband who hates icing, loved it. He cleaned out the bowl and wanted more. I did make a couple of changes. I tasted the icing after adding 3cups of icing sugar and it was more than sweet enough. Also I tried to find white vanilla cause I didn't want the brown vanilla to colour my icing. But I couldn't find any so instead I used coconut flavouring and it works awesome. If you want a change for taste I recommend trying it with the coconut flavouring.

I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I could!  I used it on my son's 3rd birthday cake, and it was fantastic.  It was yummy and easy to frost with and pipe.  Per my mom's method, I added a tiny bit of lemon extract in addition to the vanilla to cut down on the shortening-y taste.  Also, added cocoa powder and additional milk to make chocolate frosting.  It held up in the Florida heat and humidity very well!

This was a really nice buttercream frosting. Good consistency and flavor. I also used only butter (I don't really get using shortening in a "buttercream" frosting), and colored it with regular food coloring, using a bit less milk because of the extra liquid.

I agree with those who recommend all butter.  I just wish this was not called a buttercream.  I've seen it listed as just "Powdered Sugar Butter Icing".

This was a very easy cake icing recipe.  I used 1 cup butter, and no shortening.  I also added about 1 Tbsp. of cinnamon, because I needed to make a cinnamon vanilla frosting.  It came out really good.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

This recipe was so easy!  It worked perfectly for the cupcakes I was making for an easter party!  I piped the icing on using a metal tip and a plastic freezer bag!  Being able to throw away the bag made it a lot easier.  I made 2 batches and could ice around 50 cupcakes! Thanks for a really good, and easy recipe!!

I had been using a different butter cream recipe from this site but was unhappy with it. So I decided to try this one. I am in love with it. It pipes beautifully. The recipe made alot, enough to fill cupcakes and frost them for stuffed cupcakes.It came out really thick at first, I used alot of milk to thin it out, more than the recipe called for. I just did it a little at the time for fear of making it too thin. I freezing the cupcakes so hopefully it will freeze okay. Definitely my new go to buttercream recipe.

Taking a star because the all-butter version is much tastier! I feel so much freedom in using this recipe, since it is as forgiving and basic as you can get. Thanks! I never dreamed making icing would be this easy. :)

I love this recipe!!!  I refuse to use shortening, so I used all butter, but I followed everything else exactly according to the recipe.  I'm not a big icing person, but I couldn't stop sampling this one!  I used a large star tip & piped onto french vanilla cupcakes for a family birthday party.  My mom & stepdad said they would split one.  By the time my mom looked over, my stepdad had eaten the whole thing.  This recipe is a success!! Thank you!!

This icing is excellent, and SO delicious! I'm definitely going to use this from now on! I had to restrain myself from eating it all right out of the bowl, it was so good! Not too sugary and sweet, which I find is the case in most recipes. I added a bit of extra vanilla than what was called for, and used all butter instead of the  butter/shortening mix. I also halved the entire recipe, as I was only making a dozen cupcakes, and it was the perfect amount. This is one of my new staple recipes.

Terrific buttercream icing for my chocolate cake. I also used all butter [it IS buttercream, after all] & doubled the vanilla. Whip it well with electric mixer. I use my microwave on DEFROST to slightly soften hard butter first. Yummy.

I tried this recipe using the standard recipe and using the recommendations of other users. When I used only 2 cups of powdered sugar the icing was very thick and buttery, when I used 4 cups it was a lot more fluffy. I might go in between next time. But great either way! Thanks.

Definately listen to the other reviewers on not using shortning. The first time I made this (according to recipe) it came out horrible. The shortning is way to overpowering, no matter how much extract or sugar is added, you still cant get rid of the taste. Next, i used 1 cup butter and followed the rest of the ingredients and i added a little rasberry extract and came out really good.

I have a very impatient 5 year old that likes to help me bake and cook. This recipe was unbelieveably easy!  She got to help add ingredients, and because there was no cooking or raw eggs to play with she got to help me and try the finished product really fast. And it tastes GREAT too!

Love this!  Sweet and fluffy.  Works nicely on cut-out cookies as it sets up without getting hard.  I've made it with both butter and margarine, and I prefer it with margarine - just a personal preference.  Tints nicely, too.

Great for piping if you follow the recipe.  If it seems a little stiff, just add a few extra Tablespoons of milk at a time until you get it to the desired consistency.  If you put too much milk in it, the icing won't set up well for decorating with details.

This icing melts in your mouth and is a great complement to the recipe for The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies. I only used 3 cups of the confectioners sugar and it was plenty sweet. I also used all butter, no shortening.

I followed the directions exactly as written and this made a delicious frosting for my yellow cake.  I topped it with shredded coconut for our favorite cake.  Excellent recipe!

I am giving this 5 stars, but I actually made the icing using all butter, no shortening.  I also sifted the 10x sugar.  It was creamy and delcious and the perfect consistency to use with decorating bags and tips. This one is a keeper. Thank you.

First time making this recipe, and I followed the advice and used all butter instead of butter and shortening. Tastes yummy, but after I colored the icing, it started to separate and got a real gritty look to it. Also, by the time I piped my second color, the icing was so runny, it didn't hold the detail. Next time I'll try the shortening and maybe refrigerate for a short time. Problem might have been that I used margarine instead of real butter, but I don't know.

This is hands down the best buttercream that I have made. I made some adjustments. I used all butter and two cups of sugar (I don't like it too sweet)and I used 1/3 cocoa powder. I needed to frost some chocolate cupcakes. Oh, I halved the recipie so doubble the cocoa if you are making the whole recipie.

Very good and easy to make.  I think it would have been sweet enough with just 2 cups of confectioners sugar.  I have a huge sweet tooth and this was a very good icing, it tasted like a local bakery's icing here in Texas.  I used this to frost sugar cookies and it went great with the cookies!

I made this recipe the first time with all butter, but the consistency didn't hold up as well with all butter. I made it with butter flavored crisco the second time and it worked much better for my cake. I love this recipe. It is so good and the best buttercream icing by far!

I did not have enough sugar but I see through some reviews that others used the same amount I did.  I did not enjoy it as it tasted to buttery.  And the texture was not to my liken.  But again, I used less sugar and more milk and vanilla as per one review.

Great icing, made this for cupcakes. Didn't have a problem with using liquid coloring. I halved the recipe and it frosted 12 large cupcakes. I also used butter in place of the shortening too.

This is a great base recipe! I used all butter, as I hate that waxy taste of shortening, as well as three tablespoons whipping cream.  Added half lemon/half vanilla extract for a little kick.  Would definitely do again.

I used the tip about using hot water with a dash of salt, 4 cups of powdered sugar and one cup of butter instead of shortening.  I was tickled to find that one recipe frosted three batches of cupcakes (I frosted them by hand)!!  I really thought I would have to make at least two batches of frosting.  I will use this recipe again.  Thank you!

Sooo good. Instead of adding milk, I used heavy whipping cream.  I whipped it pretty well and it made the icing light and tasty. Definately will use it again.

I like this recipe. I also adjusted the recipe as previous reviews suggeested. I used 3/4 cup butter and 1/4 butter flavored shortening. We added food coloring and a tad more powdered sugar. It was easy to work with and tastes great!

This was a great icing recipe.  I used it with "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookie" recipe from this site and it was delicious.  It was easy to use when decorating the cookies and firmed up enough for me to stack the cookies.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

Used this icing on cookies for Christmas and everyone raved over the icing.  Every cookie was gone by the time the party ended.

Excellent, no-fail buttercream icing. I used it to ice some "themed" cupcakes for a bridal shower recently. I colored it with a couple of drops of food coloring and it turned out beautifully!

The icing turned out great and worked really well with the Whipped Cake II recipe.  I didn't use as much shortening as some people suggested and it came out great.  The consistency was perfect.

THE BEST!!!! I always forget how much I LOVE buttercream icing until I make it (which isn't very often). YUM! My aunt used to have her own (very successful) cake decorating business. This is as good as she used to make! DELICIOUS!!!!

perfect icing! I can't believe how great this icing is, one of the best I have made. I would never go buy icing again! Remember to sift the sugar to make sure there is no lumps.

Very easy and tastes wonderful!  I followed everyone's suggestiong of lessening the crisco.  I used 1 cup of butter and a 1/4 cup butter flavored crisco.  Don't eliminate it altogether, the crisco helps keep it smooth while mixing and spreading.  It tasted just as good as what you get from a bakery and the texture was wonderful.  This recipe makes enough to generously frost a 2-layer cake.  This will become a classic for me!

If you are looking for a delicious but very simple white icing recipe look no further!  this is great, I now use it for all my frosting instead of chocolate icing.  It is great for dying and decorating with.  I tried it at first with the half teaspoon vanilla extract and half almond extract and it tasted good but I recomend just stick to the original recipe.  All around GOOD folks.

Wonderful!  Perfect texture, perfect flavor.  I didn't have crisco on hand (& was concerned about it being too greasy), so I actually used a stick of margarine in place of the crisco and it came out great.  I also used 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract.

I gave this one two stars because the texture and look of it was nice, but the Crisco taste was overwhelming to me.  I added twice the vanilla to try and mask it but it was still there.  So if you don't mind the taste of shortening then you may like this one, but I will stick with all butter recipes from now on!

The consistency was so easy to spread and frost. However, I did not give it 5 stars because I cannot get rid of the shortening taste for the life of me. I added quite a bit more vanilla to mask it but to no avail. I don't know...maybe I did something wrong but I checked my measurements twice to make sure.

Not my favorite. Used these on sugar cookies, and it took forever for them all to be eaten. Maybe this frosting would work as a deterrent for those trying to lose weight. It just seemed more greasy than creamy.

I put this icing on the "best rolled sugar cookies" and they tasted great together! I was able to stack them about 5 minutes after they were iced. I kept it covered so it wouldn't dry out and I used a little less than 4 cups of powdered sugar.  It was a little difficult to spread because it was thick, but nonetheless it stayed moist on the cookie and didn't get crusty.

This is a great buttercream recipe.  A little sweeter than I am used to (sugar could probably be cut 3 1/2 cups), but still outstanding.  I have been looking for some time for a maple walnut icing to compliment my maple walnut cake and had no luck.  Now I just take this receipe and add 2 1/2 teaspoons of maple extract and it is perfection!! Thanks Sharon.

This has an excellent flavor and is super easy!  It's more like your bakery icing but better tasting.  I used it on gingerbread and the whole family loved it!

This icing was really easy to make and my daughter loved.  I have been looking for an easy, homemade buttercream icing to ice wedding cakes with and I have found it.  It's not too sweet but very creamy and rich.

Tastes delicious. 
Modifications:
I use all butter, no shortening. 
If decorating, and needing small, defined lines, use the 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening.
For cakes, I use all vanilla extract. 
For sugar cookies, i use 1/2 vanilla extract & 1/2 almond extract.

Followed the recipe. I think next time Iâll use 3 cups of 10x and a little more milk. Didnât seem as creamy as I wanted it. Hubby loves it though!

This is a good recipe but I made some changes.  I used all butter as I don't care for the taste of shortening in the frosting.  I also added two teaspoons of vanilla instead of one.  I like a frosting less sweet so I used less confectioners sugar.  I also added two tablespoons of milk to make it easy to spread.

This is perfect if you need the stiffness the shortening provides for piping and decorating. Otherwise I use a different recipe with all butter for the frosting :)

Used this recipe for some cupcakes for my wedding. If you're looking for a stiffer, richer frosting, I added an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and I only used half the milk. Worked great!

I was pleased with the texture of the frosting, but made a modification as I was making it.  I stopped at two cups of sugar because it was getting too sweet for me.  I added a pinch of salt and a load (that's an official measurement) of vanilla flavoring.  Wound up adding more sugar because it wasn't thick enough.  Hopefully, the sweetness of the icing will balance out with the cake (red velvet).  I wonder if it would be worth exploring using a sugar other than confectioners.  Perhaps using regular sugar that's been run through a food processor.

The worst icing I have EVER made. Seriously this was a disaster. Itâs in my kitchen now all over my counters and Iâm dreading cleaning it. Itâs runny as hell!! Itâs more liquid than water. I followed this very simple recipe to a T and wow terrible. My advice for this one DO NOT listen to others saying to use 1 cup of butter. Either use the butter and the shortening or use 3/4 cup of butter. 1 cup is gonna make it runny. Also is you want a tad bit of something different add a few drops of almond extract. If yours comes out runny as well you can freeze the icing for 2 hours and hope it comes out normal. But keep in mind to keep the consistency youâll have to keep the cake refrigerated at all times.

great recipe that my family loved.  "way better than store bought kind" they said ??  I did the 50/50 shortening/butter, but doubled vanilla flavoring as some suggested.

SO EASY!!!
I followed the recipe (which is really simple) and turned out professional bakery quality frosting. This buttercream tastes soooo much better than storebought frosting.
It took about a half hour to make two batches .  
*tip: the recipe calls for softened butter. I used room temperature butter because I assumed it was the same. It took some additional hand whisking to beat out butter lumps. Use softened (warmer than room temp but no where near melting) butter.

the best buttercream recipe I have found so far. I did alter it a little by using all butter  instead of 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening. I also made it a few times using 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 almond extract. The flavor was awesome, everyone loved it.

I made 2 batches, one just like the recipe. It was good. So I decided to try changing it up a bit. I used all butter. and added buttery vanilla and pecans ( was putting it on butter pecan bars.

I made this buttercream icing because needed a frosting recipe for a cake. Decided to try this one. The crisco part which is shortening discussed me. I think next time I will skip this recipe and try a different one that doesn't require that. Otherwise it tasted great.

Itâs definitely very sugary, google said powdered sugar is the same as the sugar listed above and so thatâs what I did, I think thatâs how itâs supposed to be but it tastes good and is nice and fluffy

Perfect frosting!  I made two batches.  I may have used 3 cups of sugar instead of four.  Canât remember.  It was last week. Ha.  And I did add almond extract with the vanilla to compliment the cake I made.  Perfect consistency.  This will be my go to icing when I want a butter/shortening combo.

I have made buttercream in the past using only butter and I thought it was to thick and heavy. I came across this recipe and I practically doubled it: 1 cup of butter (2 sticks) and 1 cup of butter flavored shortening (1 stick) and about 5-6 cups of powdered sugar (taste test as you go along so that itâs to your preference of sweetness.) I wanted to make strawberry buttercream so I kept this as a base and added 1/3 cup of sweetened frozen strawberries (with the juice) at the end and it tasted amazing!! This came out beautifully for Valentines Day cupcakes.

Tastes amazing! This butter cream works so well for piping and making frosting flowers, but if you want to pipe you will have to add more milk. I use 4 tablespoons of milk instead of 2 when I make this recipe.

Loved it.  I followed the suggestions and reduced the sugar.  For 12 cupcakes, used 1/2 cup butter, 1-1/4 cup sifted powdered sugar, 1tsp vanilla, and 3T milk. Then whipped it on high for 30 minutes.

Tastes Great
 I normally make a cream cheese icing for the cakes that I bake, But a friend told me that he hates that type of icing and asked me to become a cake so I tried out this recipe. I could tell right away that there was too much sugar in the recipe. By the time I added the 3rd cup the mixture was way too hard. Even when I used the electric mixer it was still too hard. I tasted the mixture after I combine all the ingredients and it was very very tasty. But to get the consistency I needed I added to a table spoons of light cream and 2 tablespoons of coconut rum, since I was making this icing for a coconut rum cake. The icing taste absolutely wonderful. Thank you for posting.

Very easy to make. Are used all butter instead of half shortening. I substituted Almond extract for the vanilla extract. I added a bit more sugar as I was mixing it because I wanted a stiffer icing. Turned out great and tastes great!

I am not a baker.  I made this with all butter, extra vanilla, and less sugar per other reviewer's suggestions.  I was so happy with the outcome!   I did pipe my frosting, but nothing super fancy.  I can see that if you wanted tall peaks it might be a bit too heavy to hold.  For my needs, this was perfect and will be my new buttercream go to!

I made this recipe exactly as written and found that it didn't stick well to the cupcakes, nor did sprinkles stick to it. The sprinkles just rolled right off.   Very odd? I would not make this one again.

This is a nice simple buttercream. I use all butter, no shortening. The mix is a little "softer" but you can pipe it on your cake / cupcake and put in fridge. I find shortening  leaves an off taste. I also only use Madagascar bourbon vanilla extract for any recipe. Imitation vanilla is a huge no no in my book. I use sandwich ziploc bag to pipe buttercream on. No huge mess to clean up.

My 15 year old made this.I never buy that weird stuff called shortening.. !
So, she used all butter and doubled the milk as she had 12 regular size cupcakes and 24 mini ones to frost and wanted to stretch out the frosting..
I would say that the amount of milk stated is fine and the amount of frosting is plenty to generously frost 18 regular size cupcakes.

Adding the two tablespoons of milk made it too soupy; had to add almost three cups more of powdered sugar, then more butter, to get the mixture smooth again.

It was extremely sweet because I put it on banana cake.  I also added caramel sauce.  But the recipe was extremely easy and tasted so good.  I'll use it again, just not on a SWEEEEEET cake.

I am a high school teacher and I made this for the frosting for cupcakes that I took to prom.  One student told me that she could never buy store-bought cupcakes again.  Upon returning to school after the weekend was over, my students asked me when I was going to bring more!

It's spectacular - when piping decorations, I leave out the milk to keep it nice and thick.  Also - I used SALTED butter for the best taste.

I made this icing for my daughter's gender reveal cake. It worked great and tasted fabulous! The only change I made was to add 2 tbs of light corn syrup to it to help with spreading.

I substitute cream cheese for the shortening and it makes an awesome cream cheese buttercream.  I use this recipe when I need a nice stiff frosting for decorating cupcakes and holding toppers in place without sagging should the cupcakes need to sit on a table.

This was perfect! I followed the recipe and doubled it. No changes required. Someone posted that you had a cup at a time and that's made all the difference.. the buttercream is smooth and has a beautiful silky texture yet it holds it shape. Will be my go to recipe henceforth.

This frosting is very good, not too sweet and easy to make.  I did use all butter since I was spreading the frosting on a 9x13 cake.  I also used 3 cups powdered sugar instead of 4.  It perfectly complemented and nicely covered my homemade banana cake.  I am certain this will now be my go to buttercream icing.

I too just used butter.  Much better taste than shortening, in my opinion.  I also just used 2 cups of sifted confectioner's sugar.  I am already in a sugar shock. I can only imagine  4 cups is WAY too much sugar.

After reading reviews, I used all butter.  However, upon tasting the frosting, all that came through was butter.  I ended up adding more sugar to balance the overwhelming taste of butter and sweeten it up to where  frosting should be.  I ended up with much more frosting than I needed as a result.

Used all unsalted butter (no shortening) and added 1/4 t salt. Delicious. Made enough to frost a 13X9 cake.

This tasted great but it was never really "firm". It was hard decorating it on top of the cupcakes. But it tasted great!

Very good but I am not a fan of the taste or mouthfeel of shortening. I used only 1/4 cup shortening and added an additional 1/4 butter.

I also used all butter- I wanted a different flavor so I used 1 tsp of lemon and 1/4 tsp of pure orange flavoring. I wanted a thinner frosting so I added more milk--it was amazing!! Light and citrusy!! It will be wonderful on my husbands almond (flavored) white birthday cake!!!

used all butter as others suggested and only needed 1 tbsp of milk.  i did mix after each cup which is why i believe the consistency was so smooth & easy to spread.

Not a 5 star recipe for me. But will work on it. I keep my baked goods refrigerated to keep fresher longer. Icing broke up when slicing my cake....icing too thick. Will thin down more and hopefully will be better. Cut sugar down to 3 cups (plenty!) and used all butter. Don't use margarine....read up on that folks!!

I took others advice and used 2 tsp vanilla extract, 3 c icing sugar all at once. Didn't bother doing it one at a time.  Ingredients must be at room temperature. 

I didn't have butter or shortening so just used margarine.
Becel made it quite liquidy but it was good.

Very good! I used Kerry Gold grass-fed butter (no shortening) because I was out of my regular baking butter (cheaper stuff). Wow it made it amazingly rich and full of flavor! Everybody at the party loved it and I saw people licking it off the top.

I was looking for a good buttercream frosting and this sounded good. I used coconut oil and coconut flavoring instead of the shortening and vanilla. It turned out great. I'll definately make it again.

I considered making this with all butter, but I only had about 3/4 of a cup of softened butter, so I used that and the rest (1/4 cup) Crisco vegetable shortening. 

I used 5% cream instead of the milk, and didn't measure, just added what seemed right for consistency. I didn't have to whip it long to have really smooth fluffy frosting. I love butter frostings, I hate the oil-based frostings, but butter-sugar frostings have a tenancy to be too sweet or sometimes gritty. This one was neither. I loved it. This will be my go-to.

It was the perfect amount to fill and frost an 8", 2 layer cake. Would be the perfectly generous amount for a bundt or 9x13 cake too, but would not be enough if you also wanted to do a layer cake with piping, such as borders, decorations, etc. that would require a 1.25 - 1.5 batch.

My grandma who doesn't eat frostings even had some, and my 2 year old son left the cake part perfectly in tact on his plate but had licked every drop of the icing off of it. I think it's a winner!

Too much powdered sugar for our taste! I should've read the reviews first. It would've been good with just 2-3 cups max, but maybe it's the brand I'm using. Great with cinnamon over pumpkin cupcakes!

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used all butter and reduced the powdered sugar to 2.5 cups. It was sweet enough without being overly sweet.  Perfect frosting for my daughter's cupcakes.

Halved it. Used only butter. Dumped everything together and beat until smooth. Added milk until the right consistency to spread. Spread on sheet cake. Good proportions. Will definitely use again.

I would decrease the powdered sugar to 2 1/2 cups, use all butter no shortening, and increase milk to 5 tablespoons.  With these changes it's a great recipe.  I followed the advice someone else posted.

I made a half batch of this recipe with dairy free butter and almond milk and it turned out great! This is the best buttercream recipe I have found yet and will use it from now on. It frosted 13 cupcakes with little icing left over.

This frosting was too sweet and i only added 3 cups instead of the 4 suggested in the recipe. I also added extra milk because it was too thick to frost a cake and since i didn't have shortening, i just used all butter. i will probably use this recipe again because it is very easy.

This recipe was wonderful. I made it for some cupcakes and everybody loved them. I added just about a tsp more milk because when I first mixed it it came out tough. The extra milk made it fluffy and smooth. It worked perfectly for both spreading and piping. This recipe is definitely one I will keep!

I didn't have any shortening on hand, so I used all butter.  And I used almond extract in place of vanilla b/c it went better w/ my cake recipe.  YUM!

I loved this! I wanted something easy as I was making it with limited time for some the youth at our church.  I did use all butter as I didn't have any shortening. I spread it over devil's food cake. I added green food coloring and sprinkles for St. Patrick's Day. Definitely will use again and added to my favorites. THANKS!

I made this and it is super light, fluffy and delicious! Perfect for icing and decorating! But make sure to beat the butter enough, otherwise your icing will be chunky, have butter specks in it and it will not hold the shape you pipe it into.

Fantastic and easy to make. The only modification I made was to use butter-flavored shortening because several people had made comments that the icing had a little bit of a shortening flavor to it. (I wanted to pipe the icing instead of spreading it, and the constancy was perfect!)

This is the only frosting my 6yo will eat because I make it strictly with butter.  Also, because of this I can make it without any flavouring at all, if I want, or change the flavouring to suit the base cake/cookie.  Thanks for submitting this!  (BTW, this is NOT the Wilton frosting.  The proportions are different and Wilton only includes shortening in their buttercream frosting, which, technically, can't be called "butter"-cream without butter!) :-)

This was my first time making buttercream frosting ever. I followed the direction with the addtion of a pinch of salt and instead of vanilla I used almond extract. Not only is this frosting super easy to make its also very light, fluffy, not too sweet, and it taste great.  I'm not heavy when frosting so  this recipe was just enough for me to frost 72 mini cupcakes.  This is now my go to for frosting.

Very good recipe. I only used three cups of sugar (two cups of confectioner's, one cup of caster sugar) and it turned out extremely sweet. I recommend only using two or two and a half cups of sugar.

Wonderful!  My family loved it!  I did ad an additional 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 2 tablespoons of milk.  It made it fluffy and easy to spread, plus was easy to pipe!  This recipe is going into the real recipe box!!!

Made as posted, do not like the greasiness of the shortening. Made with all butter, came out perfect. I did add 4.5 tbsp of milk to get to a spreading consistency. Used it to frost a layered birthday cake.

I have to say that I am not very good at homemade things because I fell out of practice. For my daughters 2nd birthday I made this recipe. I didn't like it at first, because I tasted the powdered sugar. But after it set and I mixed it a bit more and it turned out to be a hit.

This was a very tasty recipe! I am pretty new at cooking, so I accidentally mixed up confectioner's sugar with granulated sugar... *sigh* Once I got the ingredients to do over, the process went very smoothly, much like this icing! ;) It is, however, VERY sweet, especially by itself when you taste it during preparation. I put mine on chocolate cupcakes, so that helped dim down the sugariness, but if you can't handle the sweetness, you must either adapt it, or this recipe is not for you. I would certain

I made it exactly how the recipe says except for the milk I used heavy whipping cream instead. It came out great. It's just a little too sweet. I also added peach gel coloring  since I need peach colored buttercream. Thanks again it was super easy especially since it was my first time making homemade frosting.

I love this recipe. It is the best frosting I have ever made!! I put a little over 3 cups of powdered sugar and it turned out perfectly. Most of the frosting that I have made in the past was too sweat, but the modifications I made to the sugar was the best decision. Everybody loves the cupcakes I made with this buttercream on top, they would eat them all if I didn't limit them to 2.

This was wonderful, especially after adding vanilla bean paste instead of vanilla.  Made a white butter cake with the vanilla bean paste also.  Blue Bell needs to make this flavor ice cream.

Great for decorating, but not as tasty as I would have liked.  I made as is, and next time will try the all-butter version. Since the recipe here calls for shortening, I'm rating the recipe based on how it's written, not how others have suggested making it better.

Easiest and best frosting!!  I used straight butter, no shortening and 2 1/2 cups of confectioner sugar, which was plenty sweet enough.

This icing is FANTASTIC!  I made it EXACTLY as the recipe was written.  I've never made buttercream before... but this is so easy and so good, I honestly don't think I'll use canned icing again if I have time to make it!  I used this on cupcakes to be eaten outside on a hot summer day - it held up beautifully!  (Those who say they've gotten a funny taste from the shortening must have done something wrong - it tasted fabulous!)  I used half as it was, and added a Tablespoon of cocoa to the other half - equally as delicious!

This was perfect. All I can say is that all the one star ratings did something terribly wrong because mine came out better than store bought. The only change was that I used all butter instead of half shortening because I just don't like how shortening tastes.

Delicious! Easy to make. Needed to add a little more milk to use for cupcakes so it would hold it shape when piping.

I always make choc cake w/ choc frosting but was making a decorated cake for my daughter's graduation party (because every bakery I called uses partially hydrogenated oil!) so I needed a white frosting to able to decorate it. This worked great and it was SUPER easy to make! Great white frosting!  :o]

This recipe -- exactly as written -- was a complete hit! Used small doses of this sweet icing on birthday cupcakes and opted to freeze the rest for the next birthday in a few weeks. Thanks for sharing this. (I would have included photos but the cupcakes didn't last long enough!)

Great recipe! I'll be using it again for sure. And thanks for the tip from other reviewers: I wanted a chocolate icing so I added 1 cup of cocoa powder to replace the fourth cup of sugar and it came out great!

It was okay. It tasted like a stick of butter, but it worked well for decorating. Not the worst, but there are defiantly better recipes out there.

Great frosting recipe. As I was using it simply as a frosting for a coconut cake I did use all butter as others have suggested. Swapped coconut extract for vanilla and sprinkled coconut on top of cake when I finished frosting. Used this over a vanilla cake mix cake that I added coconut extract to and it totally tasted like a scratch made cake. Frosting makes the difference.

Wanted to make this recipe vegan so used 1/2c vegetable shortening, 1/2c coconut oil, 4c sifted icing sugar,  1 tsp vanilla and 4 tbsp soy milk.  Turned out great.  Whipped a little longer so it was really smooth.  Great taste as well. 
Iced it ready for fondant and had some left over.  Definitely will make this icing again. Can't wait to try the rolled fondant recipe you have on the site. Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe tastes alright and has a good thick but creamy consistency. It's too sugary and it lacks taste and the butter flavor is very minimal.

The recipe is good for making fun designs on cakes or cupcakes.  I added a little bit more icing to make it more stiff. I don't like the taste, its way to buttery to me.

Awesome! Perfect cupcake frosting!  I swtiched out the vanilla for almond and actually felt it needed more than what the recipe called for. I also added some butter extract in too. I added a dash of salt and it made it perfect! Perfect frosting consistency!

This frosting is delicious.  Instead of adding milk I added some heavy cream which made it whip fluffier.

Fantastic! As long as you beat it long enough it has a nice whipped soft texture.

I made this frosting to with a white cake with raspberry and blueberry jam in between the layers. It's pair perfectly. I doubled the recipe and other wise followed the recipe except I ended up 1 cup short on the powdered sugar, it was not a problem it was sweet enough without it.   I would defiantly make this frosting again.

You know,  I have made various versions of frosting before,  usually using all butter because I assumed it was the superior flavor to shortening. Well,  wrong I was. This combination of butter with shortening is perfect. The flavor is light & the consistency is perfect. You absolutely don't need all butter for it to taste "better"

LOved it. I actually switch the shortening to butter flavored shortening and added the butter, and used whipping cream instead of milk. Tastes sooo good:) I kind of wanna try it wihtbout the butter and just use the butter flavored shortening next.

I made it with all butter but it comes out thick and hard to spread. I added 4-6 tbsp of milk to it. That makes it more smoother.. I love this recipe.

This icing was creamy and easy to spread and my whole family loved it! We have some picky icing eaters here, but this recipe was over-the-top with goodness. I also recommend it with strawberries.

Wonderful, easy recipe! It has the flavorful attribute of butter and the shape-holding consistency of a bakery-style shortening icing. I did add a couple of dashes of salt to replace the salt that would normally be in that other stick of butter. Also, mine was much too stiff, possibly because I used heavy cream, so I had to add more for proper spreading consistency.

I only give it a 4 star because I didn't follow the original recipe exactly. As per reviews I used all butter, 2cups icing sugar and 3tbsp milk. Super easy, and delicious! Can't imagine using 4 cups of sugar but maybe when using the shortening you'd need it.

I had a rather large cake so I made two batches of frosting. One with all butter to use as a crumb coat and filling, and one to use as the main frosting and piping. The all butter was lovely and wonderful and I will make it like that again. And honestly, the batch with shortening was kind of gross, didn't spread nearly as well, and I'm truly disappointed. It piped okay, but what difference is a pretty cake if it doesn't TASTE good?

I prefer to use heavy whipping cream instead of milk. It seems to add a richness to a very discriminate palette.

LOOOOOOOOOVED this recipe!!!! I personally cut down the powdered sugar , but that was only because I mistakenly ran out, and it still turned out super! I doubled the recipe and am with naples 34102 on this one and used it along with David's yellow cake recipe from this site. A mega hit at the birthday dinner it was served at!

i use pure Almond flavoring instead of vanilla - it tastes delicious!  Unlike some of the reviews - I use 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter - if I need white icing then use all shortening

I really liked the recipe but I did change it up. I only used 3 cups of sugar instead of 4, added extra vanilla and used all butter since I didn't have shortening on hand. I made this with Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate cake and oh my goodness, it was SOOO incredibly good! (I know some people don't agree but I like to read reviews that say what they liked/disliked about the recipe, how they changed it and that helps me to make the changes I think would work the best for our tastes....just sayin!)

I used all butter and thought it came out very well. *Update 2/18/17- I've made this a few times now, always with all butter, and it comes out perfectly for spreading. Today we put it on homemade doughnuts.

I have made this many times! Sometimes I only use butter-- it doesn't matter that much, just whatever is easier.  I just dump all the ingredients in a blender.  Super easy.  One note that I always have is to add more milk.  It's very sweet and I don't like overly-sweet icing, so I end up doubling (at least) the amount of milk.  Also, you can omit the vanilla if you want.

I made this exactly as recipe called for and it was fine.  I will use all butter next time, I think the flavor will be better.  If I didn't have the butter I would make this again as is.

I followed the recipe exactly and when I tasted it I thought there was was way too much vanilla  I was expecting a more light taste, but overall it turned out okay

Like others, I did all butter and only half the sugar because I wasn't decorating, just spreading. This makes a delightful, light frosting- even my husband, who doesn't care for cakes or frosting, enjoyed it very much.

this recipe "IS" the wilton recipe that is found in the first coarse of decorating by wilton. it is a great recipe for piping, and the taste is great if you dont go nuts with eating to much. the only thing to remember is that if you are going to do piping dont over beat it. it will cause the icing to become to soft to do things like roses.also use hard shortening vs tube for best results

Use this recipe all the time, but it tastes much better when you use all butter, and heavy cream instead of milk.  I find I need to add more cream than the recipe calls for, but I add it a little at a time just to get it to the consistency I like to work with.

Made recipe as stated. Very easy to frost a cake, and was good tasting as well. Would need 1/2 again as much to frost a double layer cake with filling. Didn't try decorations, so I have no idea if it works for that purpose.

I followed the recipe exactly and honestly I think it is too sweet- I think next time I will just used 3 cups of sugar instead. Looks pretty and held up well for my piping which was perfect!

SOOO good.  Even my daughter who doesn't like icing at all, LOVED this icing!  I used 1 cup of butter and no shortening.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was really good.  I might have been a little generous with the vanilla because I could taste the vanilla goodness in it.  I got so many compliments about how good it was!  BTW, I used the Simple White Cake recipe by SCOTTOSMAN from this site with the icing.  Delicious!

Just what I have been looking for in a buttercream frosting.  I didnt have any shortening, so I used all butter and it turned out fantastic considering the fact that I halved the recipe (because I wasnt too sure how it would turn out and I didnt want it to go to waste) I was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful it turned out. I managed to frost 40 mini cupcakes.just be sure to beat the frosting at high speed until it becomes really fluffy. A keeper, most definitely! !!

I added some lemon juice to this and made a lemon icing. It was great! And the icing tasted good 72 hours later. Perfect for cupcakes or cakes that are made the day before.

Perfect buttercream frosting. And I realize that purists will disagree that this should even be called buttercream but if you use the butter-flavored crisco you can't tell the difference and the frosting sets up better when piping. For those who are just going to use it as a frosting spread then by all means, use all butter. But this recipe really is delicious as-is. Not too sweet, fluffy without wilting and the end result looks great. Am using it again today for my twins' birthday cakes!

Ok this is the sweetest icing I ever had. Like nauseatingly sweet. So I did give it 3 stars only cause I don't like wasting food so I added about 1 cup peanut butter and it turned out pretty yummy after that. So if you like peanut butter and like me thought this was far too sweet. Throw some peanut butter in, it will make it eatable. Sorry I don't like leaving bad reviews. No hard feelings Sharon, super-sweet just isn't for everyone. Obviously there is tons of people on here that love it that's great, for those that need it fixed peanut butter it up.

Terrific buttercream frosting! I made a double batch yesterday,using this exact recipe, for our 4th of July BBQ cupcakes. Everyone loved the cupcakes, the kids wanted to eat just the frosting. My daughter said that this frosting is better then bakery frosting. Thank you!

i love this recipe, I have used it repeatedly. I often add a little more milk than it calls for if I am piping it onto cake or cupcakes as it does "dry" out- meaning that it is hard to pipe BUT it is still creamy and oh so tasty. I sometimes add cocoa to make it a chocolate icing.

I was surprised at how disappointing this frosting turned out. I doubled the recipe and used approximately 5 1/2 cups of sugar and 2 cups of unsalted butter. It was too buttery and sweet. I added 1T lemon juice which helped a little. It was very easy to spread (I used white cake recipe from this site) though and tasted okay. But there are other recipes which are better than this.

This recipe is in my head! I make it ALL the time! It says to beat the powered sugar in one cup at a time, you REALLY need to do that or you won't get the right consistency. I know because I just dumped it all in one time ( yes, I got surrounded by a cloud powered sugar) and it didn't turn out right. Also, make sure to use a good quality shortening. Don't use anything to oily, like crisco. It make the frosting to melty and you have to add more powdered sugar, which makes it WAY too sweet. Great recipe!!!

I tried this recipe and, although it was delicious, I didn't much care for the mildly gritty texture. I look for butter creams that are smooth and fluffy like whipped cream.

I think this is pretty good icing. After I prepared this icing i divided it in half and made some chocolate icing and some peanut butter.  Although i made this adaption there was quite a lot of  taste testing with the product before my small adaption.Me and my fiance had a hard time keeping our fingers out of the mixing bowl.It was not to sweet for us. Even if one less cup of sugar was used it would still be delicious( tasted it after adding 3 cups of sugar). Next time i make a cake I am pretty sure I am going to use this icing. It is going to be great on a strawberry cake.

Overall easy to make and good recipe but way too sweet.  I only put in 3 cups of confectionary sugar and it was still too sweet for my taste.  Next time I will only use 2 - I also used all butter as others mentioned.

I decided to make this recipe exactly as stated--to be fair. I was less than impressed. It was too sugary--as others had stated. It made a beautiful cake, and it was easily spreadable. However, taste is where it lacked. My boys (who love sweets) were even less than impressed. If I decided to make this again (not likely), I would use less sugar--way less.

I used to make either an all-butter buttercream or an all-shortening fluffy white frosting, depending on what I was using it for. Now, it all will be this recipe, with half of each. DELICIOUS! I follow the recipe as written, and use it all the time.

This is delicious.  I used this recipe on the A-1-Banana Cake.  I made the recipe using all butter, but next time will make recipe as is.  When I made it with all butter, I liked the flavor, but the icing texture was not what I wanted -- it needs just a little shortening, so I am going to make recipe as it is given next time.

Followed the recipe exactly, but used only half the ingredients.  This was enough to spread on 60 mini-cupcakes I made for a party.  If planning on this icing for piping, make sure not to overdo the milk and measure it out.  Otherwise, you will lose the peaks.

The icing was great!  I might cut back on the sugar next time though.  4 cups seems like a lot.

The best recipe I've found so far, that has the "buttery" taste and has enough stiffness to decorate a little with. A tad too soft for flowers though. I tried more confectioners to stiffin it, but then you change the taste-a little too sugary. I like adding imitation butter flavor to mine.

nice bright white icing for cupcakes.  followed the original recipe then added an extra splash of cream and beat it again to make it even fluffier.

I agree, all butter is the only way to go.  I think those who do a lot of intricate decorating like the Crisco because it holds up a little better, but butter has such a better flavor.

I had my first attempt at making homemade icing last night with this recipe, and I have to say, it was extremely easy!  I have always used purchased icing to use on my sugar cookies, but not anymore!  I did use only 3 cups sugar as recommended by other users.  I will definitely use this one again!

I really liked this recipe. It is the Wilton Buttercream Frosting I used to make as a child. I didn't use shortening because I didn't have any on hand. I doubled the butter instead. It was tasty, but not as good as the one I remember from Wilton. I think the shortening may be the missing link. Nonetheless, it was really tasty.

I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted VERY strongly of shortening. I would never make this again. I might try it with just butter, as other reviewers had suggested.

We love baking and making homemade icing. I have to say this is truly the BEST icing recipe we have ever come across. It is the perfect combination of a buttercream and royal icing. This is the best way to discribe this recipe. To sum it all up in one world PERFECTION!!!!

Hi I used the recipe today to frost a cake for my daughters birthday and did not use the shortening due to the fact it had partially hydrogenated palm and soybean oils in the shortening.  I doubled the butter Ingredient.  It turned out very good.  It was think and when i frosted the cake it tore the top of the cake a little.  So I either should have made more or added maybe a little more milk to unthicken it.  Next time i will experiment more.  Thanks for the recipe =)

This frosting is amazing!!! I too used all butter and made a regular butter cream for some cookies then made another batch without the vanilla but added cocoa and mixed until it was fluffy. I piped it onto some ice cream cupcakes and they were bakery worthy. :)

What a wonderful frosting. I took everyones advise and used all butter and some extra vanilla.  I made 2 batches and it generously frosted 60 cupcakes. Lots of compliments at work today.

I am not an icing person, but I made a chocolate zucchini cake yesterday and made this icing for it and loved it.everyone complimented me on it. I used all butter for this recipe instead of half butter half shortening.This recipe will sure be a staple recipe for me now when baking cakes.

If you liked the good old buttercream icing they used to have at grocery stores like Safeway or Lucky(that was more than a decade ago), then this is exactly the recipe you need. The shortening really is the key ingredient and brings out that nostalgic buttercream flavor.

Great tasting icing, but too sweet if you use all 4 C powdered sugar. I used 3 - 3 1/2 C powdered sugar and it was plenty sweet. Just add powdered sugar to taste.

Didn't have enough (good) flavor, and still had that greasy shortening feel/taste.  Everyone has such a different idea of what good frosting tastes like.  This didn't work for us.  The family described the flavor  as "weird."  Did crust nicely and was easy to decorate with, though.  I think there are recipes out there that taste good (to my family) AND hold up well to decorating, and this is not it for us.

This icing was delicious! I only added three of the four cups of sugar, and I think next time I would go ahead and add the fourth cup.  However, despite that, the recipe was just about perfect and I will definitely use it again.

My mom and I have been making this frosting recipe for years. It is in a old Pilsbury cook book. They call it wedding cake icing. I is delicious and always gets rave reviews when I use it on birthday cakes. (Which is almost always) It is an easy frosting to use to decorate with and colors easily too. LOVE IT!

I always use this recipe for cakes and cupcakes. I replace the shortening with butter and it has always turned out wonderful.

This is a great decorator icing!  Perfect for piping.  It is important to use the shortening so that the icing does not become too soft and melt off your cake.  I find that with mixing the sugar in 1 cup at a time produces a smoother icing.  The other trick is to sift the confectioners sugar.  Will be using this again.

I read all of the reviews before trying this icing, and I must say that I dont see where people got where they liked this icing. I made two batches (I dont add milk unless I see that it is to thick) which in this case it was. I added the milk thinking that it would loosen up a bit, but this stuff was super glue. So thick I could barely spread it let alone pipe it. Luckily I used this recipe on a practice cake and lets say it did not make it it the finish because I will not be using this recipe

Used all butter since that's all I had, 2% milk and almond extract instead of vanilla.  Soooo yummy!  Perfect for frosting the White Almond Wedding Cake from this site.

I made this frosting in my quest for the perfect tasting decorator's icing.  I loved the "ice cream" taste achieved by adding some concentrated lemon flavor (oil based) and replacing the milk with water to make the leftovers last longer in the fridge.  It was a hit.  I even used it to frost a cake before applying the fondant.  The cake was delicious even 3 days later.  The problem is that the flavor made me want to eat this by spoonfuls :).

TASTE WAS OKAY, I FOLLOWED RECIPE AS RECOMMENDED. 1 CUP BUTTER 2 TABLESPOONS VANILLA, AND 3 CUPS OF SUGAR. COUPLE TBSP OF MILK. FROSTING WAS VERY WATERY, SO ADDED MORE POWDERED SUGAR. HAD TO PUT IN THE REFRIG TO HARDEN UP TO BE ABLE TO SPREAD. WILL LOOK FOR MORE RELIABLE RECIPE.

Excellent recipe; just be sure to use all butter for a richer taste. I used home-made butter (no bright yellow dyes) and clear vanilla extract to make white wedding cake frosting, and it got rave reviews!

Yum!  I did have one problem, but it was my fault. Make sure the butter or margarine that you are using is softened and at room temperature. If not the frosting won't be fluffy.  The taste overall was good and the texture was also nice and soft.

Perfect for what I needed, 4 stars because I had to modify it a little. After reading reviews, I used all butter, added an extra tsp of vanilla, and decreased the sugar to 3 cups (and it was still pretty sweet :). Also had to add an extra tbsp of milk to get the right consistency. Make sure to beat well and this is good for piping. I used with Simple White Cake from this site. UPDATE 3/10/11: Just made this to use with Giant Chocolate Chip Cookie from this site. Today was humid, and I only needed to add 2 tbsp milk, and it came out great!

I used all butter and heavy whipping cream instead of milk. Milk is too thin. The heavy whipping cream keeps it a nice consistancy. Overall a good recipe.

This icing is great! The only change I made was that I used all butter. I also just put all of the confectioners' sugar in at one time. Next time I will go for a light butter. I don't like my icing too sweet although it was beyond great. My husband can't get enough of it. I gave it five stars because now I will never buy store bought icing again.

This makes a really easy icing. I also followed lonarific's suggestion and used only butter cause I don't keep shortening. But you need to watch how much milk you add. I only have skim milk which is more watery than 2%. So I had to add an extra cup of icing sugar (bringing me up to 3 1/2)  to keep a thick and creamy consistency and an extra teaspoon of flavoring to trim down the butter taste. Next time I'll try with half/half cream and see how the texture and flavor changes.

Way to sweet with the sugar even though I had used less. Everybody avoided the cupcakes with icing opted for the plain chocolate cupcakes I made from this website. Using less sugar also made the icing less firmer to apply to cupcake with pastry bag. Despite my negativity I will try this again with some changes.

I actually wanted almond frosting but needed a basic buttercream recipe.  I still used 1/4 tsp vanilla but also used 3/4 tsp almond extract.  I thought this frosting was delicious and will probably use this as my buttercream frosting recipe from now on.

Wonderful recipe!  Nice and light and not too sweet.  I used all margarine in the recipe.  It works very well for piping onto cupcakes.

Not the best I've had, I think it was the shortening. I prefer an all butter buttercream. The search for the perfect icing continues. . . .

I made this recipe exactly as stated. It was very, very sweet, but it still had a pretty good taste. I did have to add about 1 tbsp more of milk to get the correct consistency. Next time I think I will cut down about a cup of sugar. I made it to frost an eggless chocolate cake called crazy cake (also from this site)..

I made this recipe today for my daughter's birthday party. I guess I ended up making 3 double batches, which ends up being 3 bags of powdered sugar!  Needless to say, they loved it!  They probably all left on a sugar high!  I wondered about adding the sugar a cup at a time. I wish I would have read these reviews before I made it. It would have saved me lots of time just dumping it all in at once.  I will definitely use this again!  By the way, I made so much because I let the girls decorate their own mini 6" cakes!  Icing was everywhere!

Following the directions of other reviewers, I used 1 cup of butter instead of 1/2 cup each of butter and shortening. I think my boyfriend's reaction sums it up pretty well... "The cake is good, but this icing is AMAZING!" This icing will harden slightly after a couple of hours. I actually found this very handy for transport, and the inside of the icing stayed nice and moist. Very tasty.

This is a great recipe for buttercream icing. It's not quite as good as the local cake bakery around here but close! I added an additional 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract and that really gave it the extra flavor it needed! yum!

I don't normally follow recipes for icing. I just whip up my own judging its suitability based on its texture, appearance, and flavour. So I attempted this recipe, and my icing came out lumpy. Not hard lumps, just lumpy in appearance, and won't subside with more sugar.

I have made this recipe so many times and every time I make it I literally *always* get asked for the recipe.  I make it exactly as written and I find it does not taste like shortening.  It is definitely really sweet, but if you're looking for buttercream icing, you're looking for sweet.  My husband just takes a spoon and eats it right out of the bowl (who needs the distracting cake part anyway, right?). HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE.

I agree with Jacki; definitely use all butter so that it doesn't have the shortening taste.  One problem I find with a lot of bakery icings.   Great basic icing that can be colored and flavors.

was hoping this wouldn't turn out too sweet as i have tried several recipes and all are WAY too sweet. i used all butter (as recommended) and started out with just 2 cups sugar (also recommended) and tasted very buttery. added more sugar and as soon as the butter taste disappeared it became VERY sweet. had to add some cornstarch to cut the sweetness a little. used it as a filling in a cake. not right for frosting. won't make again.

The Taste; AMAZING! What I did was used French vanilla coffee creamer instead of milk & the icing came out with a beautiful sweet smell. The icing was smooth & soft but the problem was that this icing is only good if you can have refrigeration. When the icing is at room temp its very loose & wet because the butter & shortening separate.

I used this icing for my daughters 4th birthday cupcakes. I usually just buy the icing but I wanted to try something that tasted good and worked well for decorating. This recipe was great! I forgot to buy shortening so I just used butter. It tasted so good!! I had lots of compliments from guests.

This is a perfect recipe for piping lots of frosting on cupcakes. I was skeptical because I have never used shortening in frosting before but it actually tastes good! I added some neon pink and neon purple gel coloring and the butter was not completely soft and that makes the frosting thicker and easier to use while decorating. Thank you for posting an awesome recipe!!

dont use shortening... it just makes it taste all greasey and weird in your mouth. I used margarine because that was all I had but I highly recommend using butter (which I normally do). Great recipe but just dump and pour the sugar and butter togehter to your liking.

This recipe is amazing!! It was perfect. I used it to frost cookies so I thinned it out with two more tablespoons of milk. However, if I were piping it out, I would have kept it as written. Very good taste surprisingly since it uses shortening. Yummy!

After reading some people's reviews I was a little worried but it turned out great! I modified it a bit though I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla, 3 cups of sugar, and I also used butter flavored shortening! I also added a dash of almond extract! Awesome I will make this again for sure :)

I love this recipe! I didn't use shortening, so like many others did, I used extra butter. This icing starts out quite liquid-y, which makes easier for pouring on cakes and then hardens in the fridge. I made a snickerdoodle cake with this. Wonderful!

Okay..I'm not sure how to begin this but here it goes. I had a baking disaster! I used "light butter" and "skim" milk. I think that was my first mistake. Second, it was hotter in my house than I realized and the butter was a little to "softened". I was mixing and mixing and the icing would not thicking.. it was like soup! I had enough ingredients for 1 batch. Thank goodness my parents live 5 houses away, my mom came to help. I was able to salvage the icing with help from my mom and the icing tasted great..I think given the correct inredients this would have tasted even better and would be so simple to make!

Excellent. I scaled down to 5 serves and it was the right amount to frost 12 cupcakes (I don't like too much frosting on each). I used all butter, and the milk was the perfect amount (I may have added like 1/2 tsp more). It tasted great (not too sweet, I added a pinch of salt - a must), and was very easy to work with for a first-time froster like me!

This icing was an ok place for me to start in my cake decorating quest. It was the first buttercream frosting I've made and I just did not like how greasy it was. Made my lips all slick and just tasted like butter and sugar. It was a dream to frost with though.

The taste was good however, after adding the milk I could not get it to fluff up. Then I added 1 1/2 more cups of powdered sugar and still could not get the right consistency.

This is similar to the recipe my mom always used. Small difference was 3TB milk instead of 2 and 1/8tsp salt. It's exremely sweet but better when you turn it into chocalate. To do that, just add 2 squares of chocolate. its on the back of any unsweeted cocoa. Best chocolate icing I've ever had!

This is a quick, easy and delicious recipe! I used this to decorate a big cookie I made for Valentine's day so it gets plenty thick.  I used all butter, only 3 cups of powdered sugar and roughly 2T of heavy whipping cream- because I was out of milk, believe it or not! I do think using just milk would be fine though. The cream seemed to just thin it out a bit. I also think the next time I make this I'll only do 2 1/2 cups of sugar- three was sweet and I can't imagine what 4 would be like!

I made the recipe as per the instructions and it's a bit greasy to me. Very little taste to it, maybe it's from the shortening. I will try this again with all butter and no shortening.

Best icing EVER, I used 1 cup of butter and omitted the shortening and used almond extract, I found I had to add more then the 2 tbsp of milk but it turned out better then any icing I have ever made. I will never again buy the ready to spread icing, this recipe is just so easy and soooooooooo good!!!!!!!

Great base recipe!!  I followed another reviewer's advice and doubled the vanilla, used only 2.5 cups of sugar, 4 T of milk, and 1 cup of butter (no shortening).  This frosting is delicious with the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III recipe from this site!

I used all butter, turned out great. I will try it with shortening next time just to compare. MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW BEATING DIRECTIONS EXACTLY!! Otherwise you won't have a creamy texture. I use my kitchen aid mixer, SOOOO much easier. I love this as a base recipe to add my own flavoring to! Thank you for sharing!!!

I used all butter and instead of milk I used a fresh squeezed lemon.  It turned out wonderful, a light lemony taste.  I used it as a crumb coat over a yellow butter cake before using fondant.  Will give it a wondeful taste.

I wanted to use the icing the bakeries use, and this is pretty close to some I like! I will be using only butter next time, as other reviewers suggested. I made this as a prototype to see if this will be a hit. I'll be making cupcakes for my son's birthday in school in a few weeks, and this frosting will be on them!

This is the first homemade frosting I have ever made.  I did use all butter rather than half butter, half shortening.  I've made it twice now and love the flavor and the ease.  Thank you.

I was looking for something basic but with good reviewes. This one got mixed reviews so i decided to give it a try anyways. I did use half butter and half shorting, just what the recipe calls for. Turned out great. And let me tell you, its even better the day after!  Very easy to make.

I loved this icing! Very easy to make and delicious. I did follow some of the suggestions from other reviewers such as using all butter, using only 3 cups of confectioner's sugar and using 2 tsp of french vanilla extract. I also used 1 tsb milk and one water. It spread great and it was fine for piping as well. Will definitely use this recipe again and again.

This was my first time making icing, and I thought it was a good recipe. I used all the sugar, and it was VERY sweet, so maybe i'll try less sugar next time? All in all, it was a great icing, It's a keeper!

I think this tastes the same as the "almost-professional" icing (both good!), but this recipe was a much better consistency and looked smoother and was better for frosting. I used only butter, 3 Tbl. milk, and 2.5 tsp. vanilla.

This icing in fantastic!  I, too, used a cup of butter rather than 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of shortening.  The icing was nice and firm.  It spread well and stood up to being piped through a decorating tip.  It's definitely a keeper!

Delicious!  Did use half shortening / half butter, but I cut down the sugar to 3 cups (per other reviewers).  I think next time I will try it with the full butter (no shortening), but I really thought it was great the way it was. Thanks for the recipe!

The first time I made this icing it came out perfect!  When I made it the second time it didn't turn out as well, it was really thick and I couldn't blend it properly. You definately have to have really soft butter to make this.

I have never had the nerve to make buttercream frosting...Alton Brown makes it seem sooo complicated. I only have a hand mixer and I whipped this batch up in about 5 minutes...It was fantastic...This will be my recipe from now on.OOOH I used only butter no shortining, and the second time I made it I used almond extract...very good.

Great basic recipe. After reading other reviews, I started out by adding 2 1/2 cups of sugar, which I upped to 3 for the correct consistency. It would have been far too sweet for me otherwise. With this change, it was just the perfect amount for icing 2 separate round cake layers. Also tinted nicely for a child's bday cake decoration, and sets up well when it's refrigerated.

This is a great decorator's frosting that can easily be adjusted, depending on the nature of your cake.  I made mine as follows:  One and half cups Crisco, 1/2 cup butter (softened), 2 t. vanilla extract (clear), 1/2 t. butter flavoring, 2 lbs. powdered sugar (8 cups), 6 T. heavy cream, and a pinch of salt.  I added the extra salt to balance out the heavy sweetness of the sugar.  If you want a stiffer frosting (suitable for making roses and other decorations), just reduce the amount of liquid.

We used this recipe to decorate cut-out ocokies.  Since we only had 1/2 cup butter available and  did not want a huge batch, we only added 1/4 cup  shortening and 3 cups conf. sugar plus 1 Tbsp. milk and the vanilla.  We  had to play around with it to get it the correct consistency.  It was okay and sweet enough but still needs to be perfected or tried again with success to warrant a 5-star rating.

I needed a recipe for frosting cupcakes for a friends birthday and decided to use this.  It was scrumptous!!!!  I will never do store bought icing again. I varied from the recipe by using all butter, but followed everything else to a "T". It was so creamy and the taste was outstanding. Thanks for sharing!

Very quick and easy to make!  I used it to decorate my daughter's Little Mermaid birthday cake.  It was delicious!  I used all butter rather than the shortening and I wouldn't change anything else!

This icing was a little thick when I made it which made it hard to pipe onto my cupcakes but maybe I didn't measure it as closely as I needed to.  It came together very fast and I had all the ingredients on hand already.

This recipe got lots of compliments on my daughter's birthday cake.  I tasted after adding three cups of sugar and found it to plenty sweet, so I stopped at that!  I also only used 1 T of milk.  I used the food coloring gel to tint the frosing...it turned out perfectly!

The Crisco wouldn't dissolve so when I went to ice my cake it was clumped with it on the cake.

Great icing. The only thing I changed is using water instead of milk. That way I can keep it longer in the fridge. That works better for us since our family members have birthdays back to back and this way I can make a double batch and keep it.

I only used 3 cups of sugar because that's all I had left and I think it's enough. I also forgot to add the milk and when I realized I did and added it, it made a HUGE difference. Don't forget this step! It cuts the bite of the sugar.

Very good.

-I have a birthday cupcake cookie cutter, which is just a cookie cutter in the shape of a cupcake with a candle on top, and I used an icing on the candle part along with the bottom part of the cookie (where the bottom of a cupcake would be wrapped), and then I used this on the upper part of the cupcake to make it look like a real frosted cupcake; while really, it was a cookie.

I like this recipe alone or as a base for other frostings flavors. To get rid of that shortening taste I use 1/2 ts. vanilla extr. and 1/2 tsp. lemon extr.

Easy to prepare. I used this icing on a Birthday Cake. It spreads easily, and you can decorate very easy using it.I used food coloring also to make designs, It worked out perfect for me, and the cake looked and tasted great. Thank You for sharing this great recipe.

Thank You! I used this for my mother's Mother's Day cake although after I stored it away(in the fridge) before it was put on the cake it didn't see to set when it actually was used for piping. However I had many compliments for the cake as a whole and my aunty is still nagging me to make her a cake so thanx alot!

I was disappointed in the taste of this icing, it tastes "store-bought", the texture was great though, so I gave it 3 stars.  I will go back to using only butter.

This recipe for frosting was excellent.It went really well with some rolled sugar cookies from this site. I read some other tips/reviews and I decided to use butter flavored crisco (1/2 C)instead. It tasted really nice.Thanks for a great recipe. I can't wait to make some cupcakes or a layer cake with it next time.

I used butter flavored shortening, in addition to regular butter and I put lots of extra vanilla extract and almond extract.  Still, it tasted far too "shorteningish".  I should have believed all the other reviewers who said this.  Finally I put it on sugar cookies and it ended up tasting just "okay".  I think if I put some chocolate sprinkles on it or something, it will taste more "okay."

Eh, it worked after adding alot more powdered sugar then it called for. I didnt have any shortening on hand, maybe that was my problem? But to me, it wasnt anything special but everyone liked it on my christmas cookies. Ill try it next time with some shortening.

I used this for a 9" round layer cake that I made for a baby shower. It turned out great! Everyone raved and wanted the recipe. It was not too sweet/rich, but just right. Nice and creamy too. Thanks for the recipe. This is a keeper to use on any cake or cookies.

An excellent buttercream recipe.  The combination of butter and shortening gives it the perfect texture and flavor.  It did not make quite enough to frost a layer cake as thickly as I would like - next time I'll double the recipe.

I love this icing.  Most sugar cookies have that hard thin powdered sugar icing and it ruins the cookie.  This is perfect for big fluffy bakery style sugar cookies.

I like this recipe, it is not the best icing, but it is very good none the less.  I am going to use it for my wedding cake (wedding in october/04)
Super easy to make and you can add any flavouring you like.

I really liked this recipe... I didn't give it a 5 stars b/c I have tasted better but it was very easy to make and spread, even the kids loved making it and all the cookies were gone the next day.

Dangerous stuff! I couldn't stay away. I used on "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" also on this site & they turned out great. I also used butter flavored shortening.

Perfect icing for the heart-shaped cookies I made for Valentine's Day!  (I colored it pink.)  Very buttery and sugary, too!  I substitued almond extract for vanilla extract, since I love almond flavor.

Great recipe.  Used it on Valentine cookies.  Iced well.  Made beautiful light pink color with red food coloring.  Complemented "Dora's Christmas Cookies" well (even for Valentine's Day).  Thanks for sharing, Sharon.

This icing is sooooooo good! I read that someone else had to tell their kids to stop eating it, but I had to make myself stop. Also I used butter flavored shortening like another review suggested. All I can say is WOW! So good! Thanks a lot!
