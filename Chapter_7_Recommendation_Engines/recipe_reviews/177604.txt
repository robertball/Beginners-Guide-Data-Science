It was a very simple recipe, but the stew is much too tomato based for me. I like having tomatoes in my stew, but having tomato sauce be the base was just too much.

Something's missing...not sure what.  Isn't very "saucey" for a stew using all of the egg noodles.  If I make again, I won't use an entire package.
