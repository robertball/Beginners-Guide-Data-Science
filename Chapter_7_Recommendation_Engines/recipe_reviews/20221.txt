I doubled this recipe BUT I divided it between my two kids and I. I used two large frozen bananas in this smoothie and skipped the ice. Delicious, we all enjoyed it.

Modify modify!  No honey and silly stuff like that needed.  The OJ and pineapple is sweet enough.  Cut with vanilla yogurt and it is perfect!  Don't forget the crushed ice!!

I’ve been making this recipe all summer for years with countless variations depending on what is on hand. This recipe is very flexible and seldom tastes the same twice in a row.  I always make it with a cup of orange juice OR a cup of milk, but not both.  No need to drain the pineapple. I usually throw in an egg to add creamy richness.  I frequently throw in a few frozen strawberries or blueberries.  It can be sweetened any way you want, I often use brown or white sugar when there’s no honey (but maple syrup tastes weird). Sweetened coconut milk is a wonderful addition.  Enjoy!

This is fabulous! I made it exactly as stated in the recipe, but only made one serving. I used fresh pineapple since I had it on hand. I will definitely make this one again!

Great! I made it just like the recipe said to. Sugar would make it taste better, in my opinion, but honey is healthier :)
Made it for DH's b-day supper- he really enjoyed it. Thanks

Daughter loved it! I made it as written and I think it just needs a little bit of splenda.

Excellent tropical smoothie! I usually don't add sweetener to a smoothie until I've tried it and then determine if it needs any. For me, this was perfect and no additional sweetener was required. As I usually do, I added a few scoops of vanilla protein powder and ground flax seed. I also added a 3.7 oz mango probiotic juice that needed to be used. As suggested by another reviewer, I added close to 1 cup of milk which kept it not so thick. I skipped the ice because most of the banana I used was frozen. Thanks for this keeper of a smoothie recipe, BRAT87, that I'm sure to make again!

I thought this tasted pretty good. It had more pineapple than I typically like in this type of smoothie and I realized, after I made it, that I had only measured 1 cup of it and that worked fine. I used a frozen banana as I prefer a colder smoothie. I don't have crushed ice in the house so when a recipe calls for 1/2 cup I add 4 ice cubes and 8 for a full cup. It comes out more than the measured amount but makes them colder like I prefer. I dislike measuring out honey, because it is sticky, so I just subbed 2 packes of Truvia. TY
