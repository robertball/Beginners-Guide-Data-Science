Thanks so much for posting this--I used to make this with my grandmother. A tip if you want to color the taffy:  add 5-6 drops of food coloring at the very end, and it will mix through the taffy as you pull it.  Also, pull the taffy until it is flat (not shiny) and very difficult to stretch.

This stuff is delicious!  The vinegar idea turns most people off, but don't let that deter you.  It's really very good and doesn't taste like vinegar.  My mom used to make this for us as kids and split the batch into thirds and we'd each help her pull the taffy.  Make sure to cover your hands with butter before pulling.

Oh my goodness! I grew up on vinegar taffy! Then I made it with my children. This is even good if you don't pull it. and just drop it onto waxed paper in little globs. Here is a tip. you can roll the pieces in a bit of powdered sugar to keep them from sticking together or from sticking to the paper you may have wrapped them in. Delicious!

This was a good recipe, but it tasted kind of weird. I put a half-teaspoon of vanilla extract to flavor it, but the strange, citrusy-vinegar taste was still prevalent. Maybe next time I'll use more extract, if I ever make it again.

When I tried this recipe the first time it didn't turn out, The second time it turned out very well it was tasty and REALLY FUN to stretch!!
 
It did taste a tiny bit sour though.. And a big problem is that after stretching we cut them into little pieces and put them on a plate to eat.. A while later it all melted into globs on the dish and we couldn't get them off :( 
I also sent a nice bunch to my grandma and by time she got around to eating them they were all melted and stuck together..

Happy to see this recipe here. 
I have made it for years. The recipe has been passed down from my grandmother. It is always a big hit during the Holiday season. Fun to make and fun to pull. The whole family can enjoy making it and pulling it. 
The BEST TAFFY I have ever had. Nothing can beat this one.

Works great. 1st taffy attempt. It is a bit tangy ang would probably make a great orange or lemon flavored taffy. I didn't have those but used almond and butter flavor extract to add some flavor.

I love making candies, but I'm no good at it lol. I made this and it turned out great! I even split the recipe between 3 different cooling trays and used three different flavoring oils!! FANTASTIC!

Thrilled to find a recipe I grew up on here. An elderly woman used to make this every Halloween and we couldn't wait to go to her house. Great family fun recipe to involve kids!

This taffy tasted DELICIOUS!!! But don't let the title deter you. You can not even taste the vinegar! This was my first time making any kind of candy, but it worked perfectly. Try it!

Awesome tasting but hard to pull. We did it but I'm not sure we did it right, which I know is really our fault not the recipe's.  We used red wine vinegar which tasted amazing but gave it the color of raw chicken. Lol we will color it next time.  I'll get online to research pulling taffy next time.

I have made candies and taffies before but even after 2 attempts, this candy ''globs'' together. The second attempt I brought it up to hard ball stage to try and get it to harden , still a giant glob was found the next day...I used pure cane sugar. I am at a loss. This is December in Canada weather can't explain the results either.... 
The 2 stars is for the taste that is lovely (tangy like citrus candy) just like candies from my childhood.

This was delicious! My mother used to love this taffy as a little girl, but hadn't had it since she was small. I made it for her for mother's day, and she couldn't believe I'd found a recipe for her favorite candy. It turned out exactly like she remembered. Easy to make, simple recipe. Five stars!

This was DELICIOUS. We made it just as written, using apple cider vinegar. My kids wanted to make taffy after reading about a taffy pull in “Raggedy Andy Stories,” and this was closest to the method in the story (e.g. no corn syrup). A little lemon extract would make fantastic lemony treats. One tip: follow the recipe and wrap your taffy pieces in waxed paper. We tried rolling them in powdered sugar and leaving them on a plate, but they lost their shape. Wrapping them up as the recipe specifies is the way to go. Thanks! We will make this again! My kids had so much fun pulling taffy.

I just made this with 80 high school chemistry students before X'mas and they all loved it. The kids had a blast pulling the taffy, and it came out delicious. We either added lemon extract or vanilla. The taffy with lemon extract added tasted just like lemon taffy and the ones with vanilla tasted like vanilla yogurt.

Wonderful recipe!! Just like my grandpa used to make...Just a personal opinion if you want a different flavor use a different vinegar like raspberry vinegar (My favorite is Apple Cider Vinegar) don't add any flavoring.  This is VINEGAR taffy not salt water taffy.

This turned out pretty good for me. The taffy turned out a little firm but VERY chewy after you give it a minute. I should have known that the vinegar DOES leave a taste which will affect some flavors. I choose peppermint as my flavor, but the vinegar gave it a kinda fruity taste with only a hint of the mint, it's really weird but good. (maybe I didn't use enough peppermint?) My taffy didn't exactly turn "white and porous" either. It became a little lighter in color and started to shine as I kept pulling it. This is quite a bit of a workout if you decide to pull the taffy alone.

My mom used to make this recipe and I lost it long ago.  I am so grateful that you posted it because it was a joy to watch her after nearly 25 years of being gone in my children's eyes as they pulled and pulled on that taffy.  It was as I remembered it from my own childhood.  Thank you so much. We did colors and flavors for the holidays :)

I loved making vinegar taffy with my mom as a child and then with my children, but something important is missing from this recipe.....1/2 tsp vanilla stirred in after the syrup is removed from the heat.  Takes this fun treat up to the next level!

Decent. It tastes odd; not bad, just odd. I won't be repeating this, but if you want the vinegar taffy taste, it's pretty good.
