I made this with one change. Instead of guacamole I used about half a pound or more taco meat. It was AMAZING.

Loved this!! With such few ingredients it was surprising how good it was! My husband loved it too. Didn't take very long either to make. I definitely recommend this!

This is very good made as the recipe is written.  The recipe is easy and hard to mess up.  I like layer dips because you can change it depending on what you have on hand and what people like.   So, I have made variations of this recipe that are very good also.  Sometimes I leave out the guac or use salsa instead of tomatoes.  I have also added lettuce as the top layer.

I made this for a holiday potluck.  It was super easy to make and was a huge success.  I used bean dip instead of refried beans, used Mexican shredded cheese mix and added can of diced chili.  Did not change anything else.

Great version to use when you have vegetarians in the crowd.  I added chopped tomatoes and green onion as an extra topping.  Definitely a keeper ... Delicious!

Yes, I used organic refried black beans, fresh guacamole, organic sour cream, Mexican cheese blend grated cheese and used diced green chiles instead of tomatoes. YUM!
