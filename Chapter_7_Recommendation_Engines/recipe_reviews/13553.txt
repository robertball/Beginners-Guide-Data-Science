I have made something similar to this at Christmas for many years.  I start with a softened 8oz. cream cheese and mix it well with the condensed milk.  Then add a can of pineapple and the cherry pie filling and cool whip.  It is always a hit!  Very sweet, but wonderful with ham or ham balls.

I also add pineapple and walnuts, do not even consider leaving out the sweetened condensed milk as this will leave you with a sloppy mess.  The SC milk is what thickens it.  It will last days in the fridge without becoming runny.  It takes just minutes to make and items can be kept on hand for an easy dish to bring to any event.

I have made this recipe for years and it's a hit everytime I make it. It's so simple just throw together and it's done. I also add pineapple and a few nuts for crunch. It's also excellent with raspberry pie filling.

Made this for a picnic and loved it. I added pineapple tidbits and fine walnuts. It was so easy to throw together. I'm making it for a funeral this weekend.  Will definitely become a regular recipe when I don't have time to bake.
Next time I'll use strawberry pie filling, bananas and peanuts.
Thanks for the recipe!

I make this every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. It never lasts long because everyone loves it! I always add a small amount of crushed pineapple and it gives it an even more interesting flavor! You will not be disappointed with this easy recipe!

My mother in law gave me a wonderful cherry salad recipe over 20 years ago. But she also added canned pineapple chunks to it. Just get a can of pineapple chunks in its naturally sweetened juice and pour off nearly all of the juice and just add the pineapple to the cherry salad. You don't want to add too much juice or else it will make the cherry salad too thin. It tastes even more delicious because it now has a bit of pineapple tart in it to offset the sweetness. YUM!

This was really good. I used a little less than 8 oz. of whipped topping. I thought there was a lot of cream and not enough fruit, so I added 2- 15 oz. cans drained mandarin oranges. It was rich but yummy. Thanks Jennifer!

I have been making dump salad for more than 30 years.  I add to this l large can crushed pineapple although you can use pineapple tidbits, 1.5 cups flaked coconut, 1.5 cups pecans and sometimes 2 cups of miniature marshmallows.  Our family love dump salad during the holidays/other times also.  Can also sub the cherry pie filling with strawberry pie filling.

I loved this added chopped pecans and marshmallows. Used light cherry pie filling - it was a big hit on Thanksgiving - going to make it for Easter - perfect color and super yummy.

I had ingredients on hand, so decided to try. It was ok, my children had mixed opinions as well.  Very sweet with a strong condensed milk flavor, needs something more - like pineapple, nuts or marshmallows to give it some bulk. I probably will give it one more try with the extra ingredients. I personally would not take this to any special occasion.

My mom has made this recipe for years.  I highly recommend.  Everyone always asks me what's in it.  Really great for office parties.

I made the recipe as written but we did not like it. It is very sweet. This may be good as a filling for a freezer pie or even as a sweet dip for graham crackers or cookies but alone , not so much. By itself it needs something to balance the sweetness.

This was too sweet.  Like other, I added pecans and pineapple tidbits to try to cut some of the sweetness.  Even used reduced sugar cherry pie filling.  It was very good though.

I took others advice and done a little different myself, I used a 16 oz. container of cool whip, and used 1 can of DRAINED crushed pineapple. I also made a graham cracker topping by melting 1 stick of butter or margerine then I crushed up 13 nabisco honey maid grahams and mixed till moist but still (sort of like the consistancy of graham cracker crust). I then placed 1/2 cherry/pineapple mixture in one of the large square ziploc containers(I was taking it for a reunion) then sprinkled the graham cracker topping over the top, then the other half of cherry/pineapple mixture and covered the top with the rest of the graham cracker topping. Everyone loved it and it was gone in no time at all.

I made this for a dessert for Christmas Day. I added pineapple chunks and walnuts as it initially was very sweet. however I made it 36 hours prior to serving...I think the extra time that it was in the fridge and stirring occasionally helped get all the flavors together. This recipe was very well received at Christmas by my family...so thankyou. this was the first time I used this app for a recipe

I made this for my son's college graduation party.  I will just say, people came back for seconds and thirds.  They practically licked the bowl.  It's sweet though--very sweet.  And yummy.

This was way too sweet without a lot of flavor. I tried adding pineapple once I tasted it and that did not help.

I have been making this for many years. I add a small can of crushed pineapple and about 2 cups of mini marshmallows. My kids and grandkids have always called it "pink stuff".

I just made this salad earlier today, as is.  The overwhelming flavor that comes through is the sweetened condensed milk.  I love cherries and the flavor is overpowered by the milk.  Next time I will do as others suggested, and add cream cheese.  I may add maraschino cherries as well.  This recipes is so simple but needs adjustments for my taste.

So yummy! My 5 year old daughter needed to make something for her class as a project and I chose this recipe because it was different and had a few ingredients. The whole class loved it!!!! I added pineapple and mini marshmallows as others suggested.  I will definitely make again.

Awesome! I did add some pineapple pieces(drained) and half a bag of mini marshmallows. I did use peach pie filling instead, cut up the peach pieces and mand. oranges with marshmallows as well. Make sure the oranges are drained. My husband liked the peach kind better. I have made this four times already. Will keep making over and over!

I thought this was great!!! That being said, I would omit the condensed sweetened milk (uneccesary calories in my opinion) and maybe just add a couple drops of the liquid sweetner if you like things real sweet. I also think I would do two cans of pie filling and then the coolwhip! Great recipe thanks!

This has become a Thanksgiving staple with my family.  We add a small can of mandarin oranges and a can of crushed pineapple (both drained).  It is quite sweet, but that is what makes it yummy.

I wanted to like this but as the recipe is written, I don't see how anyone could serve this. Way too sweet. I could see using this as a pie filling (use a Graham cracker crust). I ended up adding heavy cream, skim milk and cinnamon to turn it into a chilled cherry soup.
