This was so yummy!  I also had fun with the rolling but make sure you aren't in a hurry and are in the mood to cook.  They really weren't difficult at all to do.  However, I would suggest that after the noodles are done boiling, drain and seperate them and then let them cool for a few minutes before rolling.  

I added chopped mushrooms and very finely chopped onion and garlic to the cheese mixture but I can't seem to make myself cook without garlic and onions!Personally, I think the onions especially added to the taste.

To give people making this for the first time an idea of how many lasagna noodles you need, I used 18 noodles in a 9x13 pan.  I had three rows of six noodles.  Also, I put a small handful of cheese mixture in each noodle.  

I'm always looking for recipes that work well with two people in the kitchen and this is definitely one of them!  My husband and I chatted and drank wine while filling and rolling the noodles.

Great starter recipe, but needed more 'bang' in flavor.  I've made this quite a few times now and always add chopped fresh basil, 1/2 (10 oz.) box thawed frozen spinach for more green/health factor, dash of nutmeg to ricotta mixture and salt/pepper to taste.  But the tofu addition is SUPERB (use soft or medium firm- breaks up easier). Great way to add more protein/vitamins for the kids and my kids love it because each roll is a perfect serving size- and pretty too.  Just remember to go easy when spreading the filling on the lasagna, too much and it won't roll. I've made this for company, always get raves.  It's a pretty dish and guest are always impressed that they can't taste the tofu and that the dish tastes great.  Try it Moms!

Loved it!  For those with family members that do not particularily enjoy tofu, I suggest crumbling it as you mix it in.  It will blend in better with the ricotta.

Excellent!  I swapped out the tofu for whiskey and omitted the other ingredients.  Also instead of a mixing bowl I just used a shot glass.  A big hit!

I made these with my boyfriend and they were lacking flavor a bit.  We decided to make them again but added a variety of peppers and more seasoning and they were better.  We even added meat for one batch.

My family loved this. We had leftovers because it was very filling, but they were gone the next day. You wouldn't even know there was tofu in it either. The textures blend well together. If it seems hard to roll up, let the lasagna noodles cool a little so they are tacky instead of slippery and/or use less filling. The filling would go great in large shells too.

Nice change of pace from lasagna. I left out the tofu and they turned out great. I didn't have the problems that others had with rolling up, perhaps the tofu is the difference?

I made this recipe and found a very easy way to do the roll ups. Just lay all the lasagna pieces edge to edge on a large piece of aluminum foil and push the mixture on as if you were doing a sushi roll, leaving 1" at the end of the lasagna. Spread the pasta sauce over the whole lot just like the mixture, and roll each one individually, took only a few minutes.

I added some spices to the cheese mixture (basil, thyme and oregano), it turned out very well.  I was disappointed with the spinach I purchased though, so make sure you have top quality spinach to start with.

This is a great idea for a recipe. I thought the cheese blend left a little to be desired in terms of taste, so next time I will liven it up by adding garlic powder, maybe some different cheeses and something like marinated artichoke hearts. But really good idea, and they look really neat. Worth the time it takes to prepare -- spent mostly on the rolling of each noodle.

These were easy to make, easy to freeze, and very filling.  I used whole wheat pasta to add more fiber.  They turned out great.

I chose this recipe with a very picky eater in mind and she loved it.  Great out of the oven and 
and fantastic reheated as well.  I would definitely make this again.

I like the concept of these a lot, but I made them quite differently. My boyfriend and I used ground beef instead of tofu and added chopped mushrooms, onions, garlic, and a variety of fresh herbs (Italian parsley, basil, oregano, thyme) and added crushed fennel seeds and red pepper flakes which always makes ground beef taste more like Italian sausage. We made our own tomato sauce because jar tomato sauce is always kind of bland. It turned out marvelously and much more like tranditional lasagna.

A bit more involved than just layering, but the result were just as good if not better than making regular lasagna. I followed the recipe but added ground meat cooked with onions and chopped garlic. Also chopped fresh spinach instead of frozen, and sprinkled in some Italian herbs to cheese mixture. Sprayed the casserole dish really well to prevent sticking, and they came out beautiful, and not nearly as messy as regular layered lasagna. I asked my kids how many stars they give this recipe and they say 20! I agree!

Awesome with ground beef or extra fine tofu. Use two jars of sauce rather than 1.

I enjoyed the recipe! However, I added one egg (the mix was a bit dry and wasn't binding together), and I added a bit more ricotta.

I used medium-firm tofu (froze before crumbling - it was WAY easier that way!).  Also added chopped garlic and onion to the cheese mixture.  Instead of rolling (because I was pressed for time) I just made lasagna, and it turned out beautifully.  Even my husband, who prides himself on his meat lasagna, liked it.  And tofu is his least favorite!  Will definitely make again!

These are great!  Pretty time consuming to make, but I put them in the freezer for quick meals later on.  I let the noodles cool before rolling them- being cold and sticky is easier.  I only got 12 rolls with the filling, but maybe I filled them more than I should.  Will be making again!

This was ABSOLUTELY delicious. A little messy to make, but fun and worth every second. I added oregano, basil, minced garlic, and minced onion, to give it an Italian kick, and it did just that. I also used Ground Italian Style Turkey, instead of tofu. PERFECTION! The only thing I would recommend is, to wait at least wait until there are only 3 minutes left on the rolls, and then sprinkle will cheese! PS. I also used Fire Roasted Salsa! ;)

I had a ball rolling up the lasagna strips.  It was messy and imperfect -- exactly what I needed to free me up after a hard day at work.  Next time I will add some basil, parsley and oregano to the filling.  I stood the rolls on their ends so each roll looked like a rose -- a very pretty dish.

Still not used to the texture of tofu, but I still enjoyed this recipe. my 4 yr old helped crumble the tofu, and I did all the cheeses. I didn't have enough mozzarella or parmesan, so I did supplement with cheddar. Still tasty, and I only boiled 12-15 noodles. some had started to tear, and only 12 fit in the 9x13. My kids enjoyed eating the leftover noodles so much, they didn't really eat more than one rollup.

These went together much quicker than I anticipated and both my girls loved them even with the tofu.  It made nice portable rolls for leftovers for lunch the next day. I would definitely make again.

I used pork sausage. I blotted out most of the grease so that it was not to runny and fall apart. That made the texture better and the flavor. I also used fresh spinach with added a little extra some thing to the dish. I immagine frozen being to soggy. This recipe was amazing!

Excellent the first time I made this (subbed ground beef for the tofu).  Made a few changes the next few times, and now I sub ground beef for the tofu, add mushrooms, and add Romano cheese.  Everyone loves it.

These were really good & not as hard as I expected.  In my opinion you do need to double the sauce (we like extra).  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was so much fun to make!  My boyfriend and I love cooking together and this was a great dish to have a partner.  We used fresh spinach instead of frozen, and let the noodles cool a bit before we rolled them.  We had no problems rolling at all.  Since we both love spicy food we did find this a little bland.  I had added some crushed red peppers, but I think it could've used some pepper, oregano, and some fresh basil.  We'll definitely try to add more kick next time.  And there absolutely WILL be a next time!

Very good, but so hard to roll! I kept burning my hands on the hot noodles and they were so slimy!

This recipe is really great! My husband loves this especially when I use variations of sauce. I like to use Knorr Creamy Pesto with this or just a Pesto sauce. I will cut up muchrooms and zuccini and cook along with roll-ups, and its great! It gets easier each time, well worth effort!

This was way too hard to roll up. All the filing squeezed out at the end. The only way I could get them to stay together was to wrap each one individually in plastic wrap. Then I wrapped in Tin foil and froze. Tasted OK but not worth the effort.

I made a close version of this recipe last night & it was a hit with my husband who is very picky. This is a great basis of a recipe you can follow & then add whatever you like to the recipe. I did not use tofu & added more italian spices to it because that is our preference. You could also add meat if you like or use meat sauce to cover it. Simple, easy and tastes very good. I will definitely make it again. I will also try to make it with an alfredo sauce version which will be very good.

ridiculously good.  I was a little skeptical about:  1) rolling up the lasagna noodles (it was easy) and 2) taste of tofu blended in (combined with cheese and was sooooo good.  I am keeping this recipe and making it again.  My husband loves it too.  It is healthier than regular lasagna, but you do not miss the taste or flavor.

Used whole wheat noodles to kick up the health factor! Used ground turkey in place of the tofu because I was too chicken to try it out on the 3 kids! Very, very good recipe. Love the spinach in it. Thanks for the recipe :)

I made it with ground beef instead of tofu and it turned out alright. To help with rolling I found that if you leave about an inch at the beginning of the noodle to help start the rolling process. I ended up only making 12, this was the most that would fit in my 9x13 pan and I was able to put all the cheese in the 12 for a slightly larger roll. I think that next time I make this, I will add some oregano, basil and an orange pepper to the cheese mix for more flavor.

Fantastic recipe!  I made this last night and my boyfriend and I loved it.  The ingredients were easy to get a hold of and the preparation time was reasonably quick.  I made a few alterations which I think helped to adjust the flavor to our liking.  (1) I used one pound of ground turkey instead of tofu (I didn't have tofu on hand).  (2) I used two bottles of pasta sauce (it was rather dry with just one bottle being used).  (3) I added one tbsp of onion salt and two tbsps of italian seasoning.  (4) I added some chopped onion and green pepper.  (5) I used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Even though I used ground turkey instead of tofu and fresh spinach instead of frozen spinach, this still turned out to be a delicious dish.  This is a definite keeper and I'll be adding it to my rotation of recipes!

I added Italian sausage instead of tofu per my husband's request and he raved.  A novel take on a traditional dish. The crispy noodles make it yummy! It takes some time to roll all the noodles but not more than 30 mins.

I omitted the tofu and substituted italian sausage. I added basil, salt, garlic powder, oregano and italian seasoning grinder to the ricotta. I omitted the spinach and just made a baby spinach salad with tomatoes and croutons on the side.

Very eye appealing and delicious. Super easy as well!  I only used about 8 lasagna noodles and I left out the tofu. I felt like I could have almost doubled the contents that get rolled in.  Overall very good. And I will make this again making little tweaks along the way.

Excellent! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I made some changes. My husband and I prefer to have ground beef in our lasagna so I substituted ground beef with Italian herb seasoning for the tofu and I ended up serving the spinach on the side instead of in the roll ups. Like others have said doubling the sauce helps keep it moist. Great for freezing and I don't have to soak my pan for hours like I usually do with lasagna. The roll ups are the perfect size for serving. I'll be telling my friends about this recipe- or better yet I'll invite them over for dinner the next time I make it and recruit their help, my husband and I enjoyed assembling them together :-)

Made exactly as stated and there was enough filling to do 2 boxes of noodles in our house.  First run with only one jar of sauce came out a little dry.  So when I made the rest of the mix with larg shells the next day I doubled the pasta sauce... YUMMY!

I needed almost 2 boxes of noodles, since this made 24 rolls (and I thought 2 rolls was a perfect serving size). I added lots of minced garlic and oregano and some black pepper to the cheese mixture. Soft tofu blended right in to the cheese mix. Whole wheat noodles added fiber, and reduced fat ricotta helped reduce the fat a little. The teenagers loved it, and one of them swears he hates tofu. I would have needed more sauce if I wasn't freezing so many of them the day I made them.

Great recipe that my spinach and tofu averse 2 year old even loved! I'd definitely recommend adding your own spice combo. though- I used Italian seasoning with an extra dash of parsley and dried minced garlic. I only cooked my roll-ups in the oven for 20 minutes and found the cubed extra firm tofu easy to crumble with a fork. Delicious recipe- thanks!

SCRUMPTIOUS!!!! Super Easy to make! I did exactly as directed and this came out so yummy! Hubby has NEVER had tofu nor would he give it the time of day. I told him there was tofu after he was done eating 2 servings and he was stunned that he couldn't taste it!

Pretty darned good.  I felt the jarred pasta sauce needed boosting with some extra herbs - added oregano, basil, thyme and Rosemary.  I didn't use the tofu - replaced it with ground beef which I browned with garlic and onions and added it into the cheese, spinach mixture.  I was making the recipe up for 100 servings and the quantities are surely out of whack when working that kind of number.  Too much pasta left over - 3 boxes and I still made up 132 rolls - slippery little devils trying to roll those things up but all in all it went quite well.  Another reviewer suggested more sauce and I quite agree.  I certainly ran short - My recommendation is to double the jars of pasta sauce, putting a good layer in the pan before the rolls go in.  
I had quite a few pieces of lasagna pasta scraps that I couldn't use for the rolls - broke while cooking or fishing it out of the water - so I made a regular casserole using the broken bits: layer of sauce, layer of pasta pieces, layer of the filling, another layer of pasta, covered with pasta sauce, cheese, baked it - delicious.
One beef I have is with the pictures that accompany the recipe - the pic here looks like the sauce was mixed in with the filling, which is NOT what the directions say to do. Leads to expectations differing from results.

This was much easier than I anticipated but it is time consuming initially.  I added black beans and a touch of cumin and we all loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe.  Each roll is the perfect serving size for guests.

I used gluten free lasagna noodles and it turned out wonderful. So for everyone who can't eat gluten you can use the gluten free pasta and get the same wonderful taste.

The recipe is yummy, I added a bit of Italian Seasoning as it was a bit bland for our personal taste, I also added 1lb of lean ground beef and elliminated the tofu as I could not find it in my store.  very simple to make and actually the rolling is fun if you have the time and are prepared for it, if not you could just layer it in a dish.

These were pretty good.  A little messy to make but easy to portion out.  I only made a half batch with less than half a box of lasagna noodles.  I really just wanted to finish out my noodles.  I used cubed tofu that I had, but I would probably next time put that through the food precessor with the ricotta to for a better texture, the cubes didn't break up well stirring.  I used my own pasta sauce the entire 10 oz of spinach even though I onlt made a half batch.  I'd make these again probably adding a clove or two of minced garlic.

My family loves this recipe. Instead of tofu, I use a mixture of browned hamburger and hot italian sausage. I also use a 12 oz. container of cottage cheese instead of ricotta. Great dinner to make with little hands! Really cost effective and it's great to personalize with your own homemade marinara/spaghetti sauce.

I'm giving it a five star because of the flavor. However, it was a lot of work. Regular lasagna is just fine with me.

I've always been afraid to try tofu...this made trying it very painless.  It also made a wonderful comfort food enjoyable with half the guilt. I will fix this again.

Nice, relatively easy recipe.  I added italian seaoning to the cheese mixture as others had noted.  I also used shredded chicken breast instead of tofo.  I made half the recipe, since I only cook for 2 and it made approx 9 roll ups.  Very good.   Easier to serve than traditional lasagna and the pan seemed to be less messy in the end.

I was nervous to try tofu for the first time but these were actually really good. I agree with some of the other reviews that they could have used a bit more flavor.

overall a good recipe. i chose to add ground turkey instead of tofu and fresh cooked baby spinach instead of frozen. it added to the prep time, but i think it was worth it. i also cut the amount of mozzarella in half and didn't add any sauce to the inside of the roll-ups. i took the advice of another reviewer and rinsed the lasagna noodles in cold water then laid them out on a cookie sheet so they didn't stick together.

WOW!!! Is all i can say.  i made a low-cal version and got tons of compliments from a crowd of 10 people.  I did use my own sauce instead of jar.  i used firm lite tofu, cottage cheese instead of ricotta and cut all the other cheese in half.  i also used whole wheat noodles.  With my modifications these rolls were 3 pts each with weight watchers.  that was using 1/8 c of cheese and about 1/8+ cup of sauce per noodle.  It made 24 rolls.  i will be making these again and again!!!!!!!  Thx!

VERY GOOD!  I added oregano, parsley, and basil to the cheese mixture and skipped the tofu.  I did not add sauce to the noodle layers because I prefer it without.   (I used the extra sauce on top.)   I only wish I had saved some of the mozzarella to sprinkle on top with the parmesan.   It was VERY GOOD and I will be making it again.   Thank you BETTIE for sharing your recipe!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  Was not crazy about the tofu, so subbed browned ground meat the second time I made it. Don't know if I'm being stingy with the filling, but I had a decent amount left over both times.  Froze it to use in a future pasta dish.

Very good! I use whole wheat noodles and fat free ricotta to make it healthier. The first time I made it I added a little chopped chicken breast instead of tofu and the second time I made it (which was just a few days later, for when company came) I didn't add anything and the flavor was still remarkable. However, there is a discrepancy in the amount of filling to the amount of noodles. I reduced the mozzarella in the filling by half and there was still some of the cheese mixture left over. If you don't want the filling to be "bland" like some other reviewers have said, add 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper. But overall, this is a great recipe! The only thing that I've ever made with spinach in it that my older brother ate without groaning. Bravo!!!

Delicious! Even 2 thumbs up from my 'lasagna hating' daughter.  I left out the tofu (we had tofu the previous night) used zucchini, onion & garlic which I pan fried and then added to cheese mixture. I had to double the cheese mixture to get 12 roll ups. Not sure what I did wrong there. Also added oregano, parsley & fresh basil to mix.
Such an easy, delicious recipe. Thanks!

This was not as messy, nor as time consuming as I thought it would be.  Did not use the tofu, nor the ricotta because I don't like either.  Used cottage cheese instead.  I also found the 1 lb mozzarella a little misleading.  Used 2 c shredded as another reviewer suggested.  Might use 3 next time.  Forgot to add the spinach, but it was still good. Added sauted onions, garlic and basil as another reviewer suggested. 

Cooked the noodles just until almost done.  Kept them laid out in cool water until I needed them.  Laid each one on a paper towel, dried the top surface with a quick swiped of another paper towel.  Starting about an inch from the end, laid a strip of filling down the center third of the noodle stopping about 2 inches from the end.  This gives the filling room to expand as you roll without squishing out the end.  Topped the ridge of the filling with a thin row sauce.  Think snow on a mountain top.  Folded the starting one inch of noodle over the filling and rolled.  No squishing out the side, nor out the end.  

Put four roll-ups in a small glass dish, topped with more sauce and mozzarella for dinner that night.  Placed the rest on a flat pan sprayed with Pam and froze.  (Made 16 roll-ups total!)  Now I can take out as many as I need.  Very good recipe, extremely versatile!  Thanks for sharing!

Good, but as others have indicated, add some Italian spices. If you rinse noodles in cold water, this keeps them from being gummy or not as sticky as others have indicated. Also, as directions indicate, don't fully cook the noodles!!

I crumbled the tofu to hide it from my boys. They LOVED it, and so did I. (I'm not typically a tofu lover) I plan on chopping fresh spinach instead of using frozen next time, but it was still amazing.

Very good.  I did adapt for myself though.  I wanted to reduce the dairy, so I omitted the ricotta and double the tofu.  I also used soft tofu instead of firm.  Finally, in standard fashion, I added garlic powder and Italian spices to the pasta sauce.

I was actually a bit surprised at how much I liked this.  It was a little messy to put together, but it wasn't difficult.  And it was so convenient to take for lunch as leftovers.  I will definitely keep this in mind.

*Made this again yesterday with a friend.  We used ricotta this time and soft tofu again, but we reduced the mozzarella cheese by half and the parmesan by about that much.  With these reductions, we still had more than enough filling.  We were all very happy with it again.

*Made it yet again.  Turns out I didn't have any spinach, so I used frozen shredded zucchini instead.  And I used the original recipe's amount of everything else.  It made double the filling I could use.  I think I prefer it with extra tofu and less cheese, but it was good this way too.

Great recipe. I added some romano cheese and some spices, but otherwise didn't change anything. My husband wouldn't touch it because of the tofu in it, but he eventually gave in and actually liked it! I will definitely make it again!

Great recipe! The tofu really helps add substance to the lasagna, and the cheese blends well with it.

This was the first time I've ever used Tofu in a recipe, and I was surprised at how much we liked it.  I did add a bit of garlic and onion powder as well as oregano and basil to the cheese mixture.  The recipe was still a little bland and my husband says it needs "something".  I think next time I prepare it, I'll saute some chopped veggies to add some more flavor.   Overall, I think this is a very good recipe.

I made this last night... only I got lazy and didn't feel like rolling each one... so I just made regular lasagna.  I used those no-boil noodles, which also helped the process! Quick and Easy.  The cheese filling tasted great!  I didnt use tofu, instead just added 2 whisked eggs and it turned out fine.  So the individual rolls I am sure would work/taste the same, just takes more effort! ha

I made it for the first time yesterday, very yummy! It was also my first time cooking with/eating tofu and it just blended right in with the cheese. I have to agree with some of the other comments though, get soft tofu instead. I got the soft instead of the firm, and I still had a hard time breaking it apart and getting it to mix in, so I can't imagine what it would be like with the firm tofu.  Also I would say to half about all of the ingredients used in the filling. I tried to be generous with the filling but even after I filled up a 9x13 dish with the lasagna roll ups I still had half a bowl of the filling left over.

Excellent! My family has never stuck tofu in their mouth until tonight, they didn't even know it was there. My tip, get more sauce than 28 ounces unless you like it light. Also, don't be stingy with the filling or you will end up with extra. Loved it and will make it in the future. It is enough to fill up four people for two nights in my house. I am going to make some for the holidays as a snack, but they will be miniature with sauce on the side to dip it in! This recipe just made lasagna fun and less stressful! Thank you Bettie!

These are SO good!  We're carnivores (and I can never get past the weird tofu texture!), so we subbed in lean ground turkey, and it was EXCELLENT!  Great recipe, and a wonderful, quick alternative to traditional lasagna!

I didn't think these were too much work---rolling them up is not too difficult and they looked really nice nestled up in the pan.  I did alter this recipe in that I made it without the spinach or tofu.  Even in this more plain fashion, they were quite tasty, looked very nice in the pan.  I am thinking about making them as a "side dish" of sorts to a party or family gathering, just for something different.

Very nice. Add bell peppers and basil for a nice touch. Perhaps less spinach is good.

So good and worth the time; I didn't find them messy to make at all, but as someone else said, you have to be in the mood to cook and to enjoy it. I found it helpful to crumble the tofu first by cutting it into large cubes and then using a pastry cutter on it and cutting the rest of the cheese etc in. I added chives, garlic, Italian parsley, and mushrooms to suit it to my tastes. As for the rolling, just be sure to have a little assembly line set up, press the filling flat with a spoon before rolling, and it's smooth sailing. As concerns the yield: I found the filling made enough to fill a full box of noodles, around 24, but only 18 fit in the 9x13 pan, so I cooked the rest separately. Just makes more to freeze! Thanks for this recipe.

Delicious! I followed other reviwers suggestions and used nutmeg, fresh basil, fresh and dried oregano, minced onion and garlic sauteed in a little olive oil to the ricotta mixture. I recomend to make sure you have everything ready before you start assembling the rolls.In my opinion they are not difficult to make at all! Definately a regular in our monthly rotation. Thanks Bettie. Elvira Silva.

This was good, but not GREAT until I changed a few things. The first time I made it I followed the directions exactly, and it was pretty good. But the filling mixture REALLY needs some flavor, so I added garlic, salt, and pepper, and also some fresh green onions. The sides of the pasta get dry and rubbery if you don't use enough sauce on top, so really smother them in a generous amount of sauce- I used a jar and a half total. I would say definitely use the tofu, it adds substance and nutrition, but you don't really notice the flavor. I will skip the spinach next time- it gave it kind of a "dirty" flavor that was a bit overpowering. I had no problem rolling them as others did- but I rinsed the noodles in cold water and dried them before rolling. I love this recipes- With a few changes this is GREAT, I will make it often!

The first time I made this as recipe is written.  Since I have used the same filling in a traditional lasagna, without cooking the noodles first.  Turns out great.  Is especially tasty with whole wheat lasagna noodles.  The whole family loves it and I make it at least 2 times a month.

This was pretty good.  I added onions and pizza seasoning.  Per other reviews I let the noodles cool and separated them so they were more tacky than slippery.  I think issues with rolling them might come from over cooked pasta or trying to roll them too tightly.

This was delicious, a wonderful way to incorporate tofu.  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and pulsed it in the food processor.  I also added fresh thyme, onion powder, and garlic powder.  Next time, I plan to add fresh onions & garlic.

Delicious!  If I was the only one eating this I would have left the spinach in but since BF is picky we omitted the spinach.  That was the only change I made and these still came out great.  I used a roasted garlic pasta sauce.  I will be making this again!

Followed the directions on this recipe exactly; however I had to add a few ingredients.  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and added italian spices which this recipe certainly needs or else it will be very bland.  I also added some turkey sausage because my DH loves meat in his lasagna.  I love the way the lasagna looks all pretty and rolled up!  You can't even taste the tofu--hubby loved it with some homemade garlic bread!  This will be the way I do my lasagna from now on--so easy!  Thank you!

My whole family LOVED this. I made it when my parents came for dinner. My mother is a picky eater.. So i didn't tell her there was tofu in it until she took a bite. I didn't want her to get it in her head that it wouldn't be good lol. She loved it!!! I added a few things to the cheese and tofu mixture. some Italian spices. It was very yummy. This was the first time I had ever had tofu... I tasted a lil bit of it before i put it in. I was surprised to find that it has almost no smell or taste. I will be adding this to our menu :)

I gave this 4 stars because I LOVE the idea of the rolled up lasagna vs the layers! I think as written, the filling is a little too plain for my taste, it seemed to need a little 'something'. Also, I think that the noodles need to be closer to fully cooked before you roll them. I cooked mine a minute longer than recipe stated, and they were still not quite done in the finished dish. I will, however, use this recipe/idea as my base for lasagna from now on. I can't wait to add meat and veggies to the filling to spice it up a bit. Filling and rolling was easy!

This was great!  We added two eggs to the mixture as well as fresh mushrooms, onions and spinach.  For half of them we added sausage (not my half!).  I didn't add quite as much cheese as the recipe called for and didn't miss it one bit!

I made this recipe exactly how is says and I gotta say I should have added some other flavors. People were right when they said it lacks flavor. I'd make it again but I'd take out the spinach and add meat and other flavors. To each their own I guess.

Cheese mixture was great.  My boyfriend did not like all the spincah so  I used sun dried tomato and chicken instead and we love it.

Thes are fantastic but I did change it to adjust to my family's taste. Instead of tofu, I used ground beef. I omitted the spinach and threw in diced onion and some garlic powder. Served them with garlic bread and a salad. YUMMY! I also made these while I was pregnant to freeze. They freeze great! After the baby with all the chaos. it was so easy to grab these out of the freezer for a delicious meal minus the work!

pretty good.  I added ground turkey cooked with onion.  But NOTHING beats the traditional style lasagna my mom and dad make with sausage and wine.

Excellent! I did make some changes, but this is a great base recipe. I used fat free cottage cheese in place of the ricotta, used a blend of shredded Italian cheeses instead of just mozzarella and parmesan, and added garlic, parsley, and black pepper to the filling. These were delicious and really easy to assemble. Thank you!

I like this recipe, but I made it as both a roll-up and as stuffed pasta shells the next time.  It was REALLY tasty in the stuffed pasta shells.  You can't even tell that there is tofu in it!

We added fresh baby spinach to all of the roll ups and lean ground beef to some-- omitted the tofu, it's not really needed, with the beef and ricotta mix there was plenty of filling.  These were absolutely delicious and a great way to spend time with your special someone!

I halved this recipe and had to use cottage cheese in place of the ricotta (because I looked at the container wrong)! Instead of using jarred sauce  I used the recipe "Best  Marinara Sauce Yet".  These were VERY GOOD!  Don't know if using the sauce is what made it a 5 since the sauce had fresh herbs and wine in it.

These were okay. I don't think there was enough sauce for the dish and the ricotta flavor kind of overpowered it. The whole family (kids and all) ate it up, but the leftovers had to be tossed because no one was interested in eating it again.

It's a little extra work but so much easier to serve and freeze.

I did not use tofu but did add Italian sweet sausage for extra flavor to the cheese mixture instead.

Also used extra sauce and cheeses on top.  Next time will add fresh chopped basil in the roll up.

Since I only had 9 lasagna noodles left in the box, I made some adjustments: used only 8 oz mozzarella, no tofu, and only 1 cup of Parmesan. All other quantities the same. Used an 8x8 pan and it came out GREAT. I also added dried oregano, basil, garlic powder S&P to the cheese/spinach mixture. It was very tasty, will make again. Laying the cooked noodles out flat and allowing them to cool a bit (as suggested by others) before rolling really helped.

this is a great way to use up spaghetti sauce when you don't have a lot on hand. i used cottage cheese, parmasan, and one egg, plus mushrooms and thin slices of havarti inside each roll. found out you have to cut down all the veggies and meat, because it IS hard to keep the filling in! i put a layer of sauce and cheese down first as well, with sauce and cheese on top. Delicious!

A good, solid recipe to start from. I read that some thought this recipe lacked "zing" and judging from the ingredients, I can see why. I saute'd some onion, green pepper, and garlic to add to the cheese mixture, plus used some home-dried basil and oregano. Instead of tofu and spinach, I included some finely chopped broccoli florets. The instructions and cook-time were spot-on, so I felt confident in using this as a base, and adding my own touches for extra flavor. I used whole wheat lasagna noodles. One note: I originally tried using regular lasagna noodles, but they shredded into oblivion while boiling in the pot after only 5 minutes! I had to go back out to the store and buy new noodles! I figured the whole wheat would be heartier and more stable, and boy I was RIGHT! they are very reliable- try whole wheat noodles for this, as they stay strong during boiling and rolling (And they're healthier, duh!)!

This recipe was fairly easy and came out well. One recommendation I would offer is to double up on pasta sauce. I cooked the recipe as directed, and added oregano, basil, and garlic for spice. I suggest layering the bottom of the baking pan with pasta sauce, placing the roll ups on the sauce and then covering the roll ups with plenty of pasta sauce and sprinkling with Parmesan cheese. This will probably keep the roll ups from coming out too dry as mine did. Can't even taste the tofu for the tofu haters

Wow! Very easy to put together and no one realized there was tofu in this. I made one batch for dinner and froze the rest individually so I could pull them out to thaw in the morning and have an easy dinner for a weeknight.

LOVED this variation on traditional layered lasagna--I think this will be my new go-to recipe! I used ground turkey in place of tofu and arrabiata pasta sauce, and it turned out wonderfully. My husband and I enjoyed the leftovers for days!

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I made it for my friend's family and myself.  The kids helped me make it and were disturbed by me adding spinach and tofu into the lasagna.  In the end they enjoyed it very much.  The family I made it for happens to be Italian also, use to making lasagna they said it was a different spin on it and they enjoyed it very much.  I would definately make it again.  Though honestly I didn't measure out everything like I was supposed to.  And at times I didn't follow the instructions 100%, for instance I messed up on adding the Parmesan cheese.  Regardless for this being my first time, it was awesome!

I made this last night and it was GREAT! I did make a change by adding chopped artichokes, italian parsley, green onions, and italian seasoning to the mixture. It really added to the much needed flavor. As per other reviews, letting the noodles cool a bit, before rolling with mixture, was a great idea. It sounds time consuming but it held together with no trouble. We (my 17 and 14 year daughters) even added a little more to some of the rolls. I dotted the leftover mixture over the rolls, once I placed them in the sauced pan. I added more cheese over the rolls 10 minutes before taking out of oven (Cook time:45 minutes @ 400 degrees). This is a keeper!

This was a great dinner - paired it with a Caesar salad.  I substituted tofu for mild Italian sausage, and it gave the lasagna a nice kick! I cut the ingredients in half, trying to make for two people with leftovers, and it was still fantastic. Excellent recipe - will definitely use again.

I thought this was pretty tasty, I did add some italan turkey sausage. I didnt end up using all the noodles but i might have over-filled mine! It was enough for a good meal for 4 with leftovers in the freezer for another full meal.

I just made this yesterday.  This was sooo good!  I halved the recipe and used browned ground turkey in place of the tofu.  I love that this is in "single serving" size!  Perfect to pull out of the freezer and have a meal in about 30 minutes with no cooking.  The presentation is amazing as well.  Awesome! Especially for those of us who are just cooking for one.  Thanks for sharing the recipe and the great idea.

GREAT AS IS!! I don't really like spinach or tofu but you can't even tell there is tofu in it (so don't tell picky eaters, they will never know!! I am one myself and only can tell it's in there because I made it). Very delicious, everyone liked it. The only minor change I made was to sprinkle some mozzerella on top at the end. Will definitely be making this again!

Pretty good! Left out the tofu, and added my own 'toppings'- pepperoni in some for my husband, just spinach in some and some with spinach & mushrooms. Added some garlic, onion, paprika and oregano to the cheese mixture for added flavor. Will make again and experiment with new 'toppings'.

Great starter recipe, and after reading other reviews I did make some changes.To the cheese mixture I added a 1/4c. of chopped onions that I sweated in a little olive oil until translucent. Spice wise I added a 1/2tsp. of italian seasoning,between 1/8tsp. to a 1/4tsp of kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. I did leave out the spinach just b/c my family doesn't like it in their lasagna. To my sauce I added mushrooms and roasted garlic. First time my family and I had tofu and it was great and I didn't tell my family. I took the advise from one of the reviews and used the soft tofu and it mixed really well. It made enough for dinner and another pan to freeze for later in the week. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe!  A good change from traditional lasagna. Very easy to put together.  I laid out a couple noodles on a long piece of aluminum and spread the mix on the noodles in batches.  Had no problems with rolling, just don't roll too tight or press too hard or the filling will come out and let the noodles cool a bit before rolling.  I could only fit 18 in a 9x13 so I prepared the two leftover and froze them.   I made these a couple hours ahead of time and all I had to do was pop the dish in the oven when guests arrived. There's a lot of room for alterations in this recipe which is nice, but I made it exactly as written and it was awesome!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow, what a great variation of traditional lasagna.  Ever have difficulty cutting up nice slices of your own famous lasagna, this is the solution!  I pretty much used the same recipe but utilized an italian sausage/ground chuck mix instead of tofu and my home made sauce.  It turned out great - the crowd made it vanish!  Making again for the second time in two weeks tonight!

This recipe is delicious! It does take some time though, definitely not the 30 minutes as described, more like an hour. I took some advice from readers and added a few extra spices to the sauce, oregano, basil and parsley.  I also used an extra jar of sauce to pour over the top of the roll ups.  The time spent on this dish is well worth it, can't wait to have left overs tonight!

Wow, really good recipe.  I cooked the noodles the night before and threw them in the fridge then put it together the next day.  I actually only used 1/2 pound of mozzarella because I had so much filling.  I actually made one 9x13 pan full and then an 8x8 pan to freeze for later(you may need extra sauce to do this).  I would recommend you not use tofu in water, buy the dry packaged stuff if you can otherwise it has too much water.  I loved the recipe because the tofu blends in with the other ingredients so you don't taste it and though I love tofu my boys don't and they couldn't even tell it was in there but it lightened up the dish and made it healthier.  Like I said, I used only half the mozzarella and added pepper, parsley and thyme.  I would make this again and if you are trying to sneak tofu or soy into your families diet this is a great recipe to try.

I gave it 4 stars because without my additions, it would have been very bland.  My family is not much on tofu, so I left that out.  I added freshly ground salt & pepper to the cheese mixture, as well as some onion and garlic powder.  When rolling up the noodles, it is best to let them cool for a few minutes first.  Everyone loved it, especially the spinach!  The second time, I browned some ground turkey, and added it to the cheese mixture.  Very much easier than stuffed shells or lasagna!

'Lasagna roll-ups' were not only delicious it was a great way to 'present' a lasagna dish. I made it for company and everyone raved about it.  

I did substitute a few items:
- the tofu with 1/b of ground turkey sauteed with onions, garlic, minced black olives and Italian seasoning.   
- I used dry curd cottage cheese instead of ricotta
- I used fresh spinach leaves laid on the meat sauce & cheese then rolled them up.

At the end of the cooking time, I topped them with grated Havarti cheese and broiled it for a couple minutes till bubbly and brown.  

It was yummy!

This recipe was easy to make and really delicious. I did make an adjustment and swapped out the tofu, replacing it with some ground Italian sausage which definitely added to the flavor. I will definitely be making this again!

Very good, but I used browned sirloin with diced onion, Italian herb and fennel for the filling.  On each noodle I layered the ricotta mixture, meat mixture, sauce and finely grated  Italian 6  blend cheese instead of mixing this with ricotta and Parmesan. I also lined the pan with some sauce to avoid the pasta roll ups from sticking.  This made 3 dinners for my husband and I, needless to say I have frozen meals to pull out for a quick meal night.

Skipped the tofu as I can't eat it.  Very good without, will definitely make again!  Use a sauce you like this one is easy to modify if you want too but not necessary at all.  I did lay the noodles on parchment and leet them cool for several minutes as suggested by others and it was easy to roll. If you use too much sauce on the cheese mixture it will overflow and make rolling difficult.  Go easy, it doesn't need much you can pour it over the top of your wraps once in the pan.

Was great! I also added to the ricotta mixture: a pressed garlic clove, half an onion sauteed, garlic salt, basil, oregano, pepper. Next time, I'll add sauteed mushrroms. I also used a mix of mozzarella and parmesan inside and parmesan only on top.

This is a great meal to do with the family especially kids. I took out the tofu and used lean ground beef instead. I mixed the cheese, ricotta, Parmesan, and spinach together and set aside. Then I mixed sauce and cooked ground beef together. I seasoned up the beef to my liking and added spices. I layered the cheese spread first and then the meat sauce. Didn't get to messy but the kids loved helping out mixing things together. Will definitely make again.

This recipe is a great starting place - tailor it to your personal preferences (and whatever is in your fridge/pantry) and it easily becomes five stars. The filling definitely benefits from a few more spices, maybe some mushrooms for texture. The tofu was a surprisingly good addition to the filling, but if you're averse, it seems like you could substitute cottage cheese or just leave it out altogether.

This was a hit in our house, and I have picky eaters.  I don't think tofu would go over well so I used ground beef instead.  I bought a spaghetti sauce that already spinach mixed in so it was super easy. Will def be making this again!

I cooled my noodles slightly before rolling them up. My family is not a fan of tofu. We used the idea and used sweet Italian sausage on the next go around. Looks liked you fussed a lot, but very easy.

I made a half recipe (made nine rolls) and added salt, dried basil, dried oregano and powdered garlic to the spinach/cheese/tofu mixture. Made my own sauce from canned crushed Dei Fratelli tomatoes, garlic, onion powder, sea salt, basil and oregano with a splash of Burgandy cooking wine. Also used fresh basil, thinly sliced on top of the rolls with the mozzarella (added during the last ten minutes of cooking). The results were delicious and I would definitely make this again :)

Really appreciated this recipe for the guidance. I decided to saute zucchini, garlic and summer squash, blended it, then mixed it in the cheese mixture instead of the spinach/tofu suggestion. This made a ton and everyone devoured it (including the 2 year old)! Thank you for sharing.

When I make these, I eliminate the tofu.  I made it once with, but ultimately, the bulk it adds isn't needed.  I keep half of the mixture meat free, and add browned Italian sausage to the other half, to please both the meat eaters and the vegetarians.  I use double the amount of pasta sauce called for.

Hot tips on making rolling super easy.
1. After cooking pasta, let it dry on paper towels.  This helps a lot.  
2. DITCH THE SPOON.  I tried all of the different methods I read in the reviews, but really, just wash your hands and smear the mixture on.  It's ten times faster and easier to get better coverage.  It's messy no matter how you do it, you might as well do it effectively.

My husband usually doesn't like lasagna but said "this is the best lasagna I've ever had!"  We loved it!  But I did use a lot more sauce than was called for.  I think the quality of the pasta depends a lot on the sauce you use.  I added some Italian seasoning, but I think with the sauce I used, I could have went without and it still would have been pretty great :)I also didn't roll-up the lasagna as it was messy and added an extra step.... I just made it like regular lasagna.

Great idea and you can really play this one quite a bit.  Didn't have Tofu, so went "meatless" instead.  I sauteed about 1/2 cup of mushrooms and 1/2 cup of onions and my only (small) yellow squash (chopped in small cubes) that was ripe in my garden (what else to do with a "lone" squash for a family of 4?), added the jar of sauce-I only had a vodka cream in the cupboard, but any would work fine.  I really didn't measure most of the cheeses and used mostly Romano and less of the Parmesan & Mozzarella.  I know, it seems that a made an entirely different recipe, but for those that are afraid of trying something on their own-you really can't mess this one up.  I poured most of the sauce on top just a light coating on the noodles, use your fingers for spreading the cheese mixture and sauce on the noodle-you're getting messy anyway with the rolls!  Topped with a little garlic powder, and added some Mozzarella and Romano/Parmesan toward the end and this is now in the "Top Ten" in my house!!  THanks for the inspiration Bettie!

These turned out great and you could put any sauce with them or make them less healthy but just as tasty by switching up the stuffing.  A friend of mine used italian sausage instead of tofu and alfredo sauce instead of marinara.  I froze the ones I made and took them out one at a time to bake for an easy, no prep dinner.

The is a great base for a great lasgna, but I think it needed a little more spices.  I also did not add any soy, because I avoid all soy except for fermented soy due to the fact that it mimics hormones.  I added some italian sausage and mixed an egg into the ricotta cheese along with some italian seasonings.  Topped with some fresh parsley and it was a well liked at the Boy Scout camp out.

We loved these! I did leave out the tofu because I didn't have any but what a quick meal that looks like you were at the stover longer.....very yummy. I would mess around with this one next time and possibly put other things I like in the filling.

This was a good recipe but it DEFINITLEY needed some spicing up.  I added garlic, basil, salt and pepper.  I also used ground beef instead of tofu (only b/c the DH won't eat it!)  I will definitely be trying this again!

Made a few changes to this recipe, but all in all loved the concept. Omitted the tofu and spinach. (there are two things my husband will NOT eat...liver and spinach) In place of the tofu, we used 1 pound ground beef and 2 cups cottage cheese. With a tear in my eye(i love spinach) we did not replace the spinach. Then made to recipe specs.  I loved the fact that these could be personalized (thus Momma getting her spinach next time) and can be frozen single servings to boot. I had extra filling left over as we only needed to prepare 6 rolls.  They turned out amazing. Very good indeed.  WILL be making these again. Be sure not to roll to "tightly" as the filling will ooz out if you do.  My 10 year old loved how messy it was to roll them.  But with a little practice and care it's fun to do.

I changed the servings to 24, so I had a TON of this!  I wish I would have put more of the tofu/ricotta mixture in each noodle, because I ended up with so much left over that I kept making more and more...I ended up using 5 boxes of lasagna noodles and 8 jars of spaghetti sauce!  Good thing my family loved it :-)  I just filled up my freezer with the six 9x13 pans I had after we ate one of them!  Thank you!

What a great idea! I hate making a pan of lasagna as my husband and I can never eat the whole thing. This allows me to make just enough for us two. Of course, it is very easy to modify to individual taste.

This was a fun and different way to make lasagna. I left out the ricotta cheese and cooked the spinach a little so I could add seasoning. Everything still turned out great and everyone loved it.

very good! Used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and it was great! Also, instead of tofu, I used mushrooms, which was also very good. I think that we will use veggie meat next time

Yummy. I gave it 4 stars because I had to change it a bit to fit our families tastes. I took out the spinach and the tofu, and added an egg to the cheese mixture to hold it all together. I made some with just cheese, and added beef to the others for DH. Will defiantly make this again.

I used this recipe as a guide for my own version of lasagna roll ups. I used ground italian sausage instead of tofu and didn't use spinach. I didn't use cottage cheese. But for the cheese mixture I did use ricotta and grated mozzerella with a little milk to make it creamy. This is a great recipe that you can sub in and out ingredients and make it how you like it.

These are really good and pretty easy to make.  I halve the recipe but still use a full 28 oz jar of pasta sauce.  I subbed cottage cheese for the ricotta and found that I needed to cook the noodles until they were completely done - al dente ended up too crunchy for my tastes.  Leftovers freeze and reheat really well.

I made as written, just adding salt and pepper... and I used homemade spaghetti sauce. This was tasty...and really not as much work as some have made it sound like. I think this would be a great lasagna recipe for company, as it looks very pretty when plated...rather than a mess on a plate, which tends to happen. I might play around with this recipe in the future, adding more spices to the mix to kick it up a bit. Overall, great! Barely notice the tofu with all the cheeses.

These worked out well. Like others, I was able to make about 14 before I ran out of filling.  We added some Italian seasonings and ground beef, but otherwise the recipe worked out fine as is.  Don't scrimp on the sauce -- it helps make everything bubbly and hot!

Very good. After reading the reviews I made a few changes. I substituted the tofu for veggie grounds, added 8 oz fresh mushrooms, Italian seasoning, garlic, salt and pepper and 2 eggs to help bind everything.   I was able to make 15 rolls before I ran out of stuffing.  My kids enjoyed helping to mix and stuff. Thank you.

My husband hates tofu and he enjoyed this lasagne.  My kids devoured it.  I didn't have frozen spinach ans used canned instead(one) - no problem.  I accidentally put the entire jar of sauce into the mix - again, no problem; it didn't end up too "soupy".

My guests liked these a lot.  They were much easier to serve than regular lasagna that often falls apart.  I omitted the tofu and added some pepperoni.  I took the advice of another reviewer and froze the leftovers individually on a cookie sheet and placed in a freezer zip-loc bag.  All in all a very clever way to make lasagna.

This lasagna is awesome!  I used fresh spinach, ground beef instead of tofu (I made the mistake of telling my boyfriend about it before I started cooking), and added some sliced mushrooms.  This took two 13X9 inch baking dishes.  EVERYONE couldn't stop talking about how good it was.

These were wonderful.  I used the Best Marinara Sauce Yet from this website, a teaspoon of Italian seasoning and a pinch of nutmeg to the tofu cheese mixture and my spicey food loving family did not think it was in the least bit bland. I didn't have any problem rolling them up.  Favorite for Shabbat since it allows for a dairy dessert and that's the only time we have dessert.

Very good! I didn't have tofu on hand but sauteed some mushrooms up. I used homemade sauce and some garlic and basil in the cheese mixture. I think I actually like this better than regular lasagna. It is SO easy to serve as each rollup is a portion!

Great! Takes some effort, but really good, with a few changes...we aren't tofu fans so I just made meat sauce with ground hamburger and a jar of spaghetti sauce, and because of this I needed another half a jar of spaghetti sauce to pour over the top of the noodles in order to completely cover them. I also didn't have any ricotta cheese so I used Mayonaisse as the binding agent to create  a paste out of the other cheeses and spinach, it worked great and tasted delicious. Don't use Miracle Whip, it doesn't cook the same as mayo!

Ooooh!  These were really good!  I had made these for hubby and a friend of his who's also very picky (his words, not mine).  They both raved =-)  I used the homemade recipe from this site, "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" and it turned out wonderful.  I can't wait to try the leftovers...

loved the idea! very easy. i didnt find it to be messy at all. I omitted the tofu and added some ham and sausage to some rolls and some mushrooms in the rests. I split the recipe in half (making 8 rolls) which was plenty for just me and my boyfriend! although he did eat 4 of them in one sitting :-)

Delicious recipe.  I sauteed an onion, a few garlic cloves, and some fresh mushrooms and added them to the sauce.  I also added some Italian seasonings and garlic powder to the cheese mix.  This recipe makes a ton of food, I have six rollup that didn't fit in the pan that I left uncooked in the freezer and ten more cooked in the fridge after we had dinner! The two of us barely put down two each.  I used soft tofu instead of firm, a mixture of fat-free and skim mozzarella cheese and fat free cottage cheese instead of ricotta. (I didn't tell the boyfriend about the tofu, btw, and he didn't know it was in the mix!).  I will be making this again if we ever run out of the leftovers.

I made it for Easter. When I'm having a crowd for dinner, I like to make as much as possible ahead of time so I can enjoy my time with my guests. This fit the bill perfectly. I prepared it the night before and everyone loved it. BTW- we didn't taste the tofu at all.

I made this dish for my house warming this past weekend, and it was a big hit. I subbed feta cheese for the ricotta, left out the tofu, and added turkey pepperoni. It was very tasty!!

This was really good after adding some things to the cheese mix.  I added lots of garlic and some oregano and basil. Although it was very good, I still think it could be improved a little. But wow, way easier than lasagna and a fantastic way to work tofu into my diet.

It is delicious! My kids love it! I put all the Parmesan in the filling with a cup of mozzarella. Sprinkled remaining mozzarella on top of rolls. 
I’ve made it 3 times already and passed this recipe on to family. It’s a keeper :)

Using a marinara sauce recipe from my late Mother allowed me to spice it up a bit (lots of garlic and fresh basil). Seasoned the cheese mixture as well...turned out to have good flavor.  I like fresh mozz in this case to mix w/ the ricotta (part skim) and tofu (squeeze it dry on paper towels). Nice individual portions to fit your appetite and they freeze well.

I loved the texture and taste of this dish.  Next time I think I will use a little more sauce.  This freezes great and makes a lot. A bit more effort than regular lasagna but well worth it!

Yes I added some sauce to the cheese/tofu mixture rolled them up then topped with sauce as the recipe called for. I also added some fresh spinach in with the frozen spinach.
This really added more taste for us.

We made this with non-gluten and gluten ingredients, separately of course, no changes as is. 3 adults and one Picky eater, all agreed Very Good meal.
Next time we make this, we will acquire a counter top tilt top mixer as the fairly dense cheese, tofu, etc can be a little hard on the hands and wrists. I have carpal tunnel injury.

I make this every so often.  The kids like it and it's a nice meatless dinner option.  The only update I would suggest is adding seasoning to your taste.  I add salt, pepper, onion and garlic myself.

Really tasty simple recipe! Like most cooks we have preferences so I added fresh garlic into the tomato sauce before assembly. I did also decrease the mozzarella and parmesan cheeses by half to reduce fat and calories. Will make again. Thank you!

Fantastic! I love that I can that I can put different things in each roll-up for different tastes, and that one is one portion. No messy cutting, just scoop and serve! These were a huge hit. I'll be buying lasagna noodles more often!

I liked the idea of the roll ups but the amount of time it took compared to making a regular lasagna is not really worth it.  The noodles were a bit difficult to roll up and to get them to stay together.  I didn't use the the tofu.  I used a sausage and processed the meat in a food processor to make the small crumbles.

I had to chop Broccoli,  because I only had string beans in my fridge,  but it came out  DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!! I will make it again with spinach and maybe not use the tofu, just to see the difference.  I also added ground turkey to my sauce. It was a great meal , thanks for the recipe!

Followed the recipe as written and got great results.  I could have boiled the noodles just a few more minutes longer, but was concerned that they'd end up being too difficult to roll then.  Don't be stingy on the pasta sauce while baking them either.  Will definitely make these again!

These were amazing. Non tofu eaters loved it!  I browned the tofu and some yellow peppers in some PAM.  
Maybe I used too much of the cheese mixture in some of the roll ups so I needed to make more.  Rolling them was easy ...just take your time.  I used 3 jars of sauce. The company I had couldn't get enough

While the recipe was easy and tasty, we won't make it again for several reasons (at least without changing the recipe a lot before doing so). The filling was bland, and needed more  seasoning. The measurement of filling was on the minimalist side, so the rolls dried up a bit - or the pasta dominated a bit too much for us. And I would definitely use more sauce to add flavor and also keep the rolls from drying out when baking in the last phase. Overall, instead of changing the recipe that much, I'll try other great recipes. As a fan of tofu there are a lot of options in All Recipes.

Great recipe! I wasn't sure if it would work out for me, but it came together beautifully. I prepared it as written except I made my own sauce so I would have plenty of extra to serve hot on the side. I also added one egg, garlic powder, and dried basil to the cheese mixture and I squeezed the moisture out of my tofu (as well as the spinach). Thank you, I will definitely be making this dish again!

really good, family loved it!  Luckily, we have an italian deli that makes lasagna pasta sheets and that made this recipe really easy!  I did add some shallots and herbs to the cheese mixture and used fresh spinach.  I layered the pasta sheets, rolled and then cut.  Agree with spraying the caserole pan, mine stuck a little bit.  Making this again for Halloween!!!

I made this dish for a person who does not eat meat and prefers bland food. This dish is so bland that she commented on how it needed "more flavor".  Result was definitely not worth the time and effort.

I made this yesterday. I made it into a regular lasagna. For the tofu I put it in a food chopper with the spinach and chopped it all up, then added the ricotta cheese and shredded cheese with spices. I made homemade lasagna noodles. I added sliced baby Bella mushrooms and zucchini as well. It was so good. I will be making lasagna like this from now on.

I've been making these for years!  Use any combination of lasagna ingredients you like, they'll be delicious. One of the advantages for a family is that each person can have a roll up made just they way they like it.

Yummy! 1/2 recipe makes 1 9X13,  Made with cottage cheese I squeased and drained, added meat to the red sauce, about the same amount of work as a lasagna but it's different.

Added garlic, oregano, basil and roasted red pepper flakes to the cheese/tofu/spinach mixture. Turned out amazing and they freeze great too! Rating 4 stars because I think without the added spices it could have been a bit bland.

The concept is great! I use this for the extra cheese mix I have after I make my lasagna. My lasagna mix is different, but a great idea for left over cheese mix.

We thought this was fantastic. We like tofu at our house, but if you have someone who doesn't, make this recipe and they will never know. Like some others, I found the filling to be a little bland, so next time I probably will add some garlic powder to jazz it up. I'm not sure where the recipe submitter got the idea that this could fit in a 9X13 pan; with a full pound of lasagna noodles, it yielded that much plus an 11X7 pan I put in the freezer for another time.

I made these for the family tonight and they GOBBLED them up!  I replaced the tofu with a pound of ground italian sausage (drained on paper towels).  I used 2 cups of mozzerella in the filling, still not exactly sure how much cheese it called for.  If you go by weight, 1lb = 16oz which equals like 4 cups! That seemed like way too much.  2 cups is enough in my opinion.  I also didn't use quite 2 cups of parmesan, more like 1 1/2 cups.  This does take some time to assemble, but it was worth it! My only issue was that I wasn't sure how much filling to put in each roll, so of course I overstuffed the first couple rows and ended up a couple short of filling the pan. Next time I will try dividing the filling into 3rds and then plan on filling 5 with each 3rd. I still ended up with 13 rolls which was plenty even with two teenagers and a bottomless pit hubby! :) Ty for the great recipe!

Loved this recipe! I opted to have no tofu. But added oregano, basil and crushed red peppers to the pasta sauce and let it heat up on the stove before spreading on the pasta. Was a big hit at my party and it's much easier for people to grab their own servings!

This was great! The kids really enjoyed it. They prefer "meatless" lasagna. I added minced garlic to the cheese mixture, and we had a tofu malfunction so we didn't get to use it. I was disappointed because I was looking forward to introducing the kids to tofu this way. We'll definitely add it next time.

I'm giving this recipe only 4 stars because I used other reviewer's adjustments to get more flavor. I added a palm full of Italian seasoning, some onion powder and some minced garlic to the cheese mixture and added ground beef to the sauce (I used a homemade spaghetti sauce). It was DELICIOUS and made a ton! The left overs were just as yummy. So, great starter recipe, but a little bland on its own. Just needed a bit of pizazz.

I exchanged the tofu for italian ground turkey because we are so not tofu fans. After tasting the filling I threw in a little garlic and some minced onion. Both my boys had 2 helpings and begged me to make it again tomorrow night.

I was looking for a recipe to use up a partial box of lasagne noodles so I cut this one in half.  Next time I'll make the full recipe....it was delicious and easy to make.  I substituted my own sauce though as I don't care for the sauce in a jar.

This is a great recipe. I made half the recipe to use up some lasagna noodles and ricotta.  I was able to get 8.5 rolls in an 8x8 dish (I cut down one of the noodles to make it fit perfectly in the pan.) I left out the tofu and doubled the spinach.  The edges of my noodles got a little crispy, but that could be resolved by adding sauce or covering for part of the cooking time.  They were wheat noodles, so that may have been part of the issues. Awesome dish for my sister the vegetarian that the rest of us can also enjoy!

My family and I have never really tried tofu, and being that I am just a starter cook, I wanted to play it on the safe side.  Instead of the tofu, I substituted 1 lb. browned hamburger and this recipe turned out great with only that amendment.  Rolling the noodles was actually fun and they turned out so nice looking.  My boyfriend isn't really a big spinach eater either but actually didn't mind it in this recipe.  Overall, a very good recipe.

This was OK, but not spicy enough for me.  I liked the concept of rolls up instead of making regular lasagna.  Next time I will jazz it up a bit with some spices and I will probably like it better.  I would definitely make again.

This was very easy to make and very tasty, the only changes I made was to leave out the tofu, and in place of that I put a pound of ground beef in its place. And I always use extra sauce when I make Lasagna, so I added extra sauce and some canned tomatoes it was awesome!!! Would make again.

These were pretty good. I omitted the tofu and found them easy to prepare. My kids gobbled them up.

This was good, easy and made a lot so it's a good freeze and reheat recipe.  I did think that it was lacking something so next time I make it I'll experiment a little bit.  All in all very good.

I loved this recipe. I didn't put them into rolls but made it the normal lasagna style, but the flavor is all that matters, and it was excellent!!  My fiance decided he didn't like it before even trying it because of the tofu.  But after I made him try it, he loved it as well!  The tofu blends in with the ricotta cheese, so you don't even know your eating it.  The left overs were great as it didn't seem to dry out much..or maybe that's because the left overs didn't last very long!!  Will definately make again!!

YUM!!  These are soooo good.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  Love it love it.  It's a little messy but nothing too crazy and preparation was fairly easy.  Highly recommended!

Great overall receipe - though it can be sloppy to make!  I did add chopped mushrooms, chopped zucchini, fresh basil, fresh orenago and fresh thyme.  It is delicious and this will definitely go into the rotation of dinners!!  Thanks!

My family never knew there was tofu in this dish. They ate it up! I think I will add a little onion to add to the flavor.

This dish was very good, but like others, I did add seasoning to give it more flavor.  I added a tablespoon or so of italian seasoning and salt to taste to the cheese mixture.  We loved this, and it makes enough to eat on for days!

Very good recipe! I used shredded chicken in place of the tofu.  I also spiced up the cheese mixture with garlic and Italian seasoning. I ended up making only 12 rolls and tossed the rest of the unused lasagna noodles. But it all fit nicely in the 9x13 pan.  I will definitely make this again!
