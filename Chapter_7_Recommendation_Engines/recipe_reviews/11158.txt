I agree that these are misnamed as 'crisps', mine came out about the same concistincy of snickerdoodles, chewy. But they, in my opinion, are scrumpylicious.

This recipe is brilliant, I use it as the basis for all the cookies I make just by changing what I add at the end, and they always come out perfectly crispy round the edge and a bit squidgy in the middle.

These didn't turn out crispy for me for some reason. I followed the directions exactly but the cookies came out chewy and a bit floury. It did have good maple flavour, though.

I made these cookies today exactly as described. But, it had very little flavor and was not sweet enough for a cookie. Next, I will increase the Maple extract to 1 tbsp, increase the white sugar to 2 cups, instead of 1 cup. If you want the cookies crisp, place your cookie sheet on the bottom rack with no foil underneath. I also think that using a hand mixer for this recipe is unnecessary. Perhaps that is where I went wrong? In any case, it's not a bad recipe,  but it needs tweaking. There just very little flavor and it wasnt sweet for a dessert cookie.

It was good.  My daughter liked them because she likes anything with maple.  Thought I'd tried this out since I had all the ingredients on hand.  These were like a cross between sugar cookies and pecan sandies.
