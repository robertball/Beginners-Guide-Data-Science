I'm the one that submitted this recipe and I just wanted to add a little note: If you can't find lemongrass, most stores carry lemongrass paste. It's not as good as fresh lemongrass, but at least you will get some of the flavor. Also, I've discovered that adding basmati rice that is a little toasted or crispy adds another really great element to this soup. One more thing, my recipe calls for minced lemongrass because we like the texture and crunch of it. However, some people might not, so you can just put the whole stalks in a take them out when ready to eat. Thanks for all the great reviews!

EDIT: My recipe calls for 2 teaspoons of curry paste because I used incredibly spicy paste. Lately I am not able to find that particular brand and most red curry pastes on the market are not very spicy. So add to taste and according to how spicy the paste is that you have.

This Was So GOOD! I Added Chicken Instead Of Shrimp (Let The Chunks Of Chicken Simmer In Chile Base For 30 Min, Then Let Simmer WIth Coconut Milk For 45 More Minutes So The Chicken Would Infuse WIth Flavor And Be Tender). Also Added Rice Noodles (I Suggest Boiling Them Separatly, Then Adding Them To A Bowl With The Soup Placed On Top- The Noodles Will Suck Up The Broth If You Add The Dried Noodles To Cook In The Soup.)

So Good, Could Also Add Bean Sprouts Or Anything Else You Can Think Of!!!

Holy smokes, this was AWESOME!!!  My boyfriend snarfed it, and I loved it, too.  My sister wasn't too hot about the chunks of lemongrass.  I liked them, but if they bother you, you can always buy lemongrass paste, I suppose.  Anyways, this was fast, easy, and total comfort food.  Great recipe!

I used only 2 cans of coconut milk and this was still too much (I love coconut anything). Next time I would only use one and would also add waaay more lime juice (to give it that sweet and sour Thai flavour), more lemongrass, and possibly some lime leaves and fresh Thai chilies. I also added two heads of bok choy to make it more of a meal, which turned out well.

UPDATE: I have a new way of making this soup that has put it in regular rotation. Skip the oil, slice the ginger and lemongrass and throw all ingredients in the left column, plus 4 cups water in a large pot. Let simmer for a bit while you prep the rest, then scoop out the ginger and lemongrass with a slotted spoon. Add regular mushrooms (not shiitakes) and 1 can of coconut milk. After mushrooms have softened a bit add a package of vermicelli rice noodles. When the noodles are done, throw in a small package of whole snap peas, prawns, and lime juice and turn off the heat. Let it sit for a couple of minutes until the prawns are cooked and the peas are bright green. Top with cilantro and serve.

Like many people here I get tempted to tweak recipes. Not this one. It rivals a favorite local Thai restaurant that my Sweetheart and I go to so I resist the temptation to tamper. Some folks might like or expect it to be spicier but for us this is perfect. I wish i could give it more stars.

Absolutely fabulous!!! Because fresh lemon grass wasn't available, I used the tube lemon grass. You need triple the fresh. But oh so yummy!

This was SO good!!!! Here are some of the changes I made though:

I cut the lemon grass too small and it's hard to pick out/ literally hard to eat, so I'd cut 2 stocks in bigger pieces
I used like 4 Tablespoons of red curry paste haha
I used 1 T of fish sauce, I don't like it too fishy 
I used Light coconut milk
used white mushrooms cause I think they're way better :)
I also shredded a rotisserie chicken instead of using shrimp and squeezed 4 whole limes in.
I also added broccoli, green beans, little corns, bock choy, green onion (all at the end), and choped half a yellow Onion that I put in when the chicken broth was boiling so it gave flavor/ got really soft. Thanks!!!

We love this soup! I added 1 chicken breast sliced thin in bitesize pieces while the soup was in the simmer because when we get this at our favorite Thai place, this is how they make it! We had never had shrimp in it before, but what a great addition! I did not use Shitake mushrooms because I had white mushrooms, but it would be fabulous. Can't add too much ginger so don't worry about the amount listed in the recipe. I grated it using a microplane. My other additions were galanga and dried red thai chilies 'cause HE likes it hot. I used about a tsp of the tube lemongrass (cause fresh is sometimes hard to find here in the"sticks".) I made the entire recipe and we ate most of it in one sitting. There's just enough for me for lunch today. (YAY!)

Awesome, authentic soup! Tastes great over brown basmati rice with a ton of fresh cilantro on top. Very filling and tastes just as good the next day. This soup has so much flavor. I will make this one again and again!

So good!  I added a little curry powder and about a tsp. of lime zest.  I was amazed to see the difference in brands of canned coconut milk.  I picked up several cans of it on the aisle with the powdered and shelf life milk.  Then I saw it in the chinese food section labeled Thai Coconut Milk and bought several there.  Upon opening it was clear that they were different.  The Thai product was creamy and thick on the top  ( I have seen that referenced in other Thai recipes)  The Thai product was clearly superior.  Look for it.  I will make this again.  It was great without noodles or rice, very filling in and of itself for a meal for me.

This recipe is the bomb!  Exactly what I was hoping for.  Taste just like the soup at a Thai restaurant near our home.  My husband and I had been trying to figure out what was in theirs, and couldn't figure out what the red spice was that was floating at the surface of the soup - it was the red curry paste!  I ran to a local Oriental food store on my lunch hour today, and picked up a can of it for 99 cents.  Only used a little bit of it, so I froze the rest in an ice cube tray and then in individual cubes for future use.  The only changes I made to this recipe were that I left out the lemon grass (the red curry paste actually has lemon grass in the ingredients - so I don't think it jeopardized the flavor at all leaving it out).  The only other change I made was that I used chicken instead of shrimp.  We just had shrimp the night before, and I had 1 raw chicken breast left that needed to be used.  I just sauteed the chicken with the oil, red curry paste and ginger until no longer pink, and then continued on with the recipe.  Hubby, daughter and I all LOVED it.  Served it with Pot Stickers and Korean Cucumber salad (from this site).  YUMMO!

This was wonderful! So rich and flavorful, and fairly easy to prepare. I could eat the delicious, rich broth by itself, but the shrimp and mushrooms add a wonderful flavor and texture. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used veg broth. Next time, I'll add either red pepper flakes or more curry paste to give it that Thai kick.

Great soup!  I have been trying to get as close as possible to the local thai restaurants version of this, and this is about as close as it gets.  Though I added water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, baby corn (must have), and slices of sweet red pepper.  I omitted the shrimp because the thai restaurant does not use it, and it was perfect.  If served my way this is a huge hit with vegetarians.  In order to make it completely vegetarian I used mushroom broth instead of chicken and it does not affect taste, since flavor comes from the curry, coconut, lime and herbs. It tasted exactly as the restaurant makes it!

BEST THAI COCONUT SOUP EVER! I followed everything with the four following exceptions: 1. I used chicken thighs. I baked them while my soup was simmering, and then cut them into chunks before adding them to my soup. 2. I used the lemongrass from the tube. You need to use about 3 tbsp. 3. I used 1 tbsp of curry paste for added flavor. 4. I used portobello mushrooms versus shiitake. Once I added the lime juice I let it simmer for another 10 minutes to make sure the sauce was creamy and not oily spots. Along with everyone else I served it with brown rice.

My client loves this, I've made it several times for him. To amp up the spice I use hot chili oil instead of the vegetable oil, and if you really like the heat you can use siracha. Using light coconut milk dials down the fat and calorie content without affecting taste. I usually serve chopped cilantro, lime wedges, bean sprouts, and sliced green onions as garnishes.

Fantastic recipe with a broth just bursting with wonderful flavors. We generally stayed with the recipe other than adding about 3/4 pound of sea scallops, quartered and switching 2 out of 3 cans of regular coconut milk to the lite type to moderate the amount of saturated fat. Jessica, the recipe’s author, suggested in her review that some people prefer whole stalks of fresh lemongrass be added to the soup rather than mincing it, and we would do that in the future as the crunch from tiny pieces didn’t do much for us. We would also follow her lead to increase the red curry paste. While all the steps in the directions call for stirring the soup as successive ingredients are added, it doesn’t indicate to do so after adding the shrimp. It was only stirred once, and that was a mistake as some pieces of shrimp were a bit tough probably because of hot spots from using a gas stove . . . next time, the soup will be stirred often and possibly lopping off about 1 minute of cooking time during this next to last step. Jessica, you rock!

I've made this three times making slight variations so I've figured out what works for us.  Most of the changes I make are due to a lack of availability of ingredients in this part of the world -- like lemon grass is something I have to buy in "the big city" at the Asian market -- it's frozen & chopped.  I use slightly more red curry paste (May Ploy Thai Red Chili Paste, frozen) because we like it spicy,  and 3 cans of chicken broth, and only 2 cans of coconut milk (low fat if I can find it) because we don't like it as creamy.  I can't find fresh shiitake mushrooms so I use the dried kind, soaking them before I begin cooking.  I don't skimp on the fish sauce often adding another TBSP for good measure because it adds so much flavor!  I have tried adding chicken and tilapia pieces and must say, the fish tastes best.  I also use a tad bit more lime juice.

I added lime leaves to give it more flavor and omitted the chicken to make it vegetarian. Pretty close to restaurant quality Tom Kha, but not quite there.

This is a four star because I consider it a great base and very easy to adjust ingredients to what is on hand. Using red curry paste, I more than doubled the paste, but still was a pretty mild dish. Next time, I'll either add some spicier curry paste or perhaps some thai chiles or at the least cayenne pepper to kick it up a notch (or several). Also will probably substitute sliced chicken as shrimp is never a big hit in my house. Cook longer to allow flavors to meld. Try chopped bell pepper too.

How about 6 stars?!  We loved this recipe, it was very authentic.  My 3 year old could not stop eating it!  For my lemongrass, I decided to cut it lengthwise, I actually used 2 4" stalks (it is like a bay leaf and you just have to find it to pull it out), we do not care for the fibrous texture.  I used chicken and sauteed it in the curry mixture before the broth was added (per another review).  Instead of rice we used rice noodles (cooked separate and added to the bowl to pour the soup over).  I also added bean sprouts, thai basil and an optional side of chile paste on a side plate for additions.  As the poster of the recipe commented on, the curry paste is definitely better more than 2 tsp., we actually did a bit more than a Tbsp by the time we were done tasting it.

I'm a thai foodie. I was expecting from the reviews the kind of soup that's served in thai restaurants, which has a unique taste, both sweet and spicy. From the recipe it looked tasty, but unfortunately there is way too muck coconut milk (is it really 3 x 13.5 oz ? One can of 398ml would probably be enough). I tried to save the recipe by adding more red curry and more chicken broth, but still it wasn't enough.

great soup! I bought the thai lemon grass already chopped up & boiled with the ginger then drained the lemon grass & ginger like another person wrote. Someone else wrote about thai coconut milk which does make a big difference.I also bought by gourmet garden thai herb & spice blend (lemon grass, ginger, cilantro, garlic, & chili pepper) I added 1Tbsp. Instead of just using shitake mushrooms I used a mix of baby bella, shitake, & oyster. I added chicken, broccoli, sugar snaps, sweet bell pepper, green onions, & rice noodles. It came out great!

I'm sorry, but I thought this was rather bland when compared to my favorite local Thai restaurant's recipe. I won't be making it again. Thank you for sharing!

GREAT RECIPE!  I didn't have lemon grass so I substituted green onion (cut on the diagonal for presentation) and added carrots - as well.  I did only use ONE can of the coconut milk because I personally find it too overpowering with more.  It was easy and so delicious!  I served it with spring rolls as a side.

This was very bland. I tried to add flavor with extra curry paste, basil and red and green pepper but it was still disappointing. On the other hand it seemed a lot more healthy than what they sell in Thai restaurants.

This soup is perfect. I did not add any sugar, and did not need salt. I couldnt afford shitake mushrooms, so I used those cheaper ones in the grocery store. I added peas and carrots. YUM!!!

At first it tasted bland- something was missing. I added 2 tablespoons of rice vinegar and it was JUST like the restaurant! When looking back, I added the lime juice too soon and it boiled out... This is one of my FAVORITE Thai treats to order in the restaurant and now I can make it at home!

I agree this is the best Thai Coconut Soup.  So much better than any restaurant around my area.  I omitted the shrimp only because I didn't have any and used regular white mushrooms.  I also used the Lemongrass, Ginger and Cilantro that comes in a tube from the produce area.  The soup was awesome.  The only thing I would change is to use a lower sodim chicken stock as this was a little too salty.  But I will most definitely make again and again.  Thank you for this recipe!

Waaaay too much coconut milk! If you use this like a curry (e.g., only a little bit of liquid) I suppose its ok, but as a soup soup, I wouldn't recommend it. Good flavor from the non-coconut elements, but the coconut milk weighs it down (and kills any nutritional value). I would modify by adding only 1 can of coconut, chicken and shrimp, and doubling the chicken broth.

This one of the BEST red currys I've had!  I like to also add bamboo shoots, different types of peppers and chicken.  I've tried the reduced fat coconut milk and found that it doesn't thicken up as much as I would like.  It's so easy and so good - I would definately recommend it to anyone!

My boyfriend loves to get this whenever we go out to a Thai restaurant, so he made me try to make it at home. This recipe tastes very close to the original and it's our new favorite. I changed the shrimp to chicken and cut them into small cubes and then cooked them in the olive oil with the red curry paste and lemongrass. I used regular mushrooms instead of shitake, but I want to try and find the specific mushrooms that are usually in this soup. Overall, loved it and am constantly refining it to make it more and more like the restaurant version!

This is the closest soup to Tom Yum Soup I've found, but without the long list of special Asian ingredients.  Delicious!  I did only use 1 can of coconut milk to decrease the fat content, and it was still delicious.  I added extra lemon grass and lemon juice 'cause I like the citrus flavor (you can use just lemon juice if lemon grass or paste isn't available).  Also, to increase the vegetables, I put in diced carrots with the chicken broth, and put chopped, fresh spinach in the bottom of the bowls just before serving, and poured the soup over the top.  The taste was amazing, but healthier by decreasing the coconut milk and adding more veggies.

I don't know how I neglected to review this for so long, as I've made it so many times.  It is wonderful!  Better than any restaurant version I have had.  One small tip, take the stems off of the shiitakes if you want all the mushrooms to have a nice even texture.  The stems are a little tough and don't absorb as much flavor.

This soup was amazing!  Since my husband is vegetarian, we tried this with rice as other suggested instead of the shrimp.  Also added a little bit of tabasco.  Next time will try adding some bell peppers, cashews and pinapple.  Though it was amazing as is.

Yummy, this is exquisite! I had everything on hand to make this except for the lemon grass and the shitakes. Ran up to the market, chose the lemon grass paste in the tube and had to settle for baby bella mushrooms.  Next time I make it I will cut back on the brown sugar. So good, thanks for sharing this one!

Very tasty! Boiled down 3 chicken legs and made the stock for the soup. I used the meat from the chicken legs instead of the shrimps. Added an extra spoon of curry for a little stronger flavor. Because I wanted the soup to be for dinner I added some mungbean sprouts and spinach at the last minute for a more filled soup. I took the lemongrass out before serving but I think I will leave it in next time. Definitely worth making again.

So, I made this recipie for the crew at my fire station, and it was a hit.  I substituted chicken breast in place of shrimp, sautéing it in coconut oil and red curry sauce with finely chopped cilantro stems from the cilantro bunch.  I had difficulty finding lemongrass, so I just added the zest of one lemon.  It was truly spectacular.  Side note... should you decide to add rice noodles to this soup, you should probably reconstitute them in additional chicken broth separately.  I added a package of mei fun to the soup just before serving, and when I lifted the lid five minutes later... Ta-daaaa... it became The Best Thai Coconut Noodles, sans broth.   I added bean sprouts to the noodles and mixed it in, along with the cilantro and lime juice, and topped each bowl with crushed peanuts.  It. Was. Amazing.

It was OK.  I was hoping for more flavor but it turned out kind of bland.  It was not spicy and I even added 1 serrano pepper.  I used chicken instead of shrimp and added a red bell pepper.  I probably won't make it again since it lacked flavor for me.

1 can of coconut milk and it's great! I think whoever submitted this recipe accidentally put 3 cans of milk on the list. This seemed like a lot when I read the recipe, so with the suggestion/replies of other people I started with one and tried it and it was good. Any more would be too much. Also, as the submitter suggested, I added 2 teaspoons more red curry paste. No salt, since I only used one can of milk and the broth is salty enough. Next time I will add bok choy or  bean chutes.

Meh. I was looking forward to this recipe, but I was somewhat let down. I expected more flavor, I suppose.

I made this without mushrooms, added chopped carrots & celery,  scaled the size down a bit. So easy and delicious, both kids finished every last drop.  More comforting than chicken soup with our current terrible head colds! Thank you Jessica!

I feel  that there was way too much coconut milk and not enough spice.  The soup overall was very thick and bland.  I used chicken instead of shrimp, but the problems were with the "broth," which was too thick to really be called a broth, anyway.  I may try it again with less coconut milk and a lot more seasoning.

There's another Thai soup on this site by Chef John that has similar ingredients to this one, but is much better in my opinion. First, I personally feel that the hard crunchy pieces of ginger and lemongrass take away from the soup. In the other recipe he simmer's them in the chicken broth then filters them into the main pot. There's also more lime, chicken thigh instead of shrimp, garlic and red onion, which  adds much more flavor. Overall, this soup is ok, but the other spicy Thai from Chef John is better...check it out and try for yourself

It was SO GOOD! It was a first time I cooked a Thai food, and it was wonderful. Thank you very much. I also had added some sliced chicken and sautéed it with mix of ginger, lemon grass and carry past, before I added a chicken broth. I believe that it made my soup even more testy.

*****
I've had many versions of this soup, even in Thailand, but this one is the best!  Instead of mincing lemon grass, I *bruise* the stalks before adding to the soup.  Also, I prefer kaffir lime leaf (2) to the lime juice and remove them before serving.  Many thanks!!

Pretty tasty.  I let it cook on the stove a little too long and the coconut milk almost started to curdle, so watch out.  I added green peppers and red onions.  I think I'll substitute sweet white onions for the red next time.  Definitely added more red curry paste than the recipe called for.  Will make again!

When I was pregnant w/our 4th, I craved coconut soup & could have saved the family $$ if only I'd had this recipe a year ago!  This is restaurant style, for sure.  I suggest pulling out the shrimp in the leftovers so that it doesn't get too fishy sitting in the fridge.  XOXO

Absolutely delicious.  This is the first recipe I've tried from the AR site (recent convert from another site) and it was the best.  We added a heaping t. of shrimp paste and added chicken thighs.  Do not skimp on the lime - made a big difference.  Can't wait to make it again.

This soup is sooooo yummy that it's all I ate for an entire week-end.  The only thing I couldn't add was the lemongrass.  Next time I will try with chicken instead of shrimp.

Weak sauce. For the amount of liquid vs. spices, there is not enough depth of flavor. If you are a true Thai lover you will date and see that you need to multiple your seasoning at least 3 fold.  I suggest tasting as you go for sure.

As a LOVER of Tom Ka Gai (a Thai coconut soup),  My husband and I were always tempted to go out just to get a bowl.  I found this recipe and decided to try it out to have our favorite soup more often.   I've made it about 4 times now and my husband and I LOVE it.  It is very fast, easy and can be made with many variations.  I made it different every time based on what ingredients I had on hand and my favorite variation has the following:  Shrimp, 2 cans coconut milk, and baby bok choy in addition to the other ingredients.  I've made it with chicken too, but like it best with seafood.  Also the shiitake mushrooms are much better than the regular kind.   I usually serve it with rice so it is a heartier meal.

AHHHHH, my tummy is SO happy!!! Added very thinly sliced chicken instead of shrimp, regular white mushrooms (couldn't find shiitake), peas, carrots and then fresh spinach at the very end instead of cilantro. Oh, and chili oil to spice it up a little. Ridiculously delicious! Thank you!!

It was alright. I've been going to a local Thai restaurant for years and always enjoyed their coconut shrimp soup. I thought this recipe was the closest to the one they make. I really didn't like the idea of cilantro... It's like WHAT? It's a Mexican spice, has nothing to do with an Asian soup. I'm sorry it takes away from it for sure. What happened to red onions? You gotta put red onion in your coconut soup! One more thing. Thai kitchen is famous for its spiciness. You gotta use jalapeno peppers or cayenne for sure. Also, I must agree that 3 cans of coconut milk is too much.

A very popular Thai restaurant near us makes this and I loved it so much I looked it up and found this recipe...and it does NOT disappoint, it is just as good!  The first time I did mince a stalk of lemongrass, but the second time I just used the paste to save time (and wasn't thrilled about the chuncks of lemongrass in the soup).  I also use the tube of ginger paste, and it was STILL excellent!  I used the cilantro the first time, but the soup is sooo good I felt like the cilantro overpowered the taste so I didn't use cilantro again.  
The restaurant near us uses chicken instead of shrimp, so I'm going to try that too!

This was amazing and not very difficult. I did change out and use grilled sea scallops instead of shrimp, which was quite tasty! This makes a great appetizer or side dish, but is not terribly filling for a main dish.

so good!  I couldn't find lemon grass- or the paste- so I added 2 finely chopped tablespoons of leek.    I also used small pre cooked frozen shrimp. The flavor was great but next time I will buy lemon grass and fresh shrimp!  yum. yum yum.

i personally thought this was a good recipe, not great.  i didnt care for the grated chunks of ginger.  i would use the ground ginger next time, not fresh.  i suggest making it with at least one can of lite cocunut milk or it is real heavy.  thanks for the try!

I was really worried my two teenage daughters wouldn't eat it, simply because the smell after adding the fish sauce.  They admitted they were worried too!  However, after letting the ingredients do their thing-my daughters and I thought this was super tasty!  Definitely will make again sometime, but will be adding some hot Sriracha sauce to my bowl.  Could have done without the lemongrass pieces, but overall-very good!  Thanks.

This soup was the first Thai dish I have ever made that came out just like the restaurant.  I made a stock by boiling the shimp shells, lemon grass and a few slices of ginger in the chicken broth for 20 minutes.  I then strained it and made the soup as directed except for the chopped lemon grass since I had the flavor in the stock.  A real winner!

Very good, tastes just like it does in the restaurants even though I had to sub some ingredients. I didn't find any curry paste, so I used 1Tb curry powder and extra grated ginger, garlic, tomato paste, lime zest; doubled the lemongrass; used only one can of light coconut milk; used a can of straw mushrooms instead of shiitakes, and tofu instead of shrimp.... sure sounds like I made an entirely different soup, but it's not so because I used this recipe as the base and it was a terrific place to start. I'm sure it would be wonderful as written, I just had to edit based on my pantry/preferences. Do try it.

This is absolutely fantastic, delicious creamy and ooh so suculent. My husband was on cloud nine eating this. I added Tunisian Harisa and  fresh Italian Basil as it was the only equivalents I had. I didnt need to fret as the outcome was "ooh la la formidable" a true delight for the senses. Thank you sooo much.

Excellent authentic-tasting dish. It tastes just like what you get at an authentic Thai restaurant. I added some fresh Thai chilis for more heat (I like it 5 stars or hotter). Chili paste is also good with this. Thank you for the great recipe!

This soup is absolutely delicious! It is full of flavour and spice which will keep me making this over and over! 
For a stronger lemon flavour I added an extra lemon grass stalk and lime, I replaced the sugar with honey to make it slightly healthier, and instead of shrimp I used chopped fresh fish fillets.

I am not a big soup fan, but I do love Thai food so I took a chance and made this. I have to say that it is without a doubt the BEST soup I have ever eaten, and it will definitely become a regular in my home. I only made a few small changes, 1 less can of coconut milk (and I used "light" coconut milk) to lower the calorie count, and only 1 tbsp of fish sauce because my kids don't like it. Other than that I followed the recipe letting it simmer a bit longer to let the flavors be enhanced...fantastic!

This is better than restaurant quality. No FRESH ginger available so I used powder instead (about 1 tablespoon in powder form). I had to add double the curry paste (only because it was not spicy to me, and I like that extra kick). I also added 1 thai chili pepper, chopped. Lastly, added chopped green onions (about 1 stalk). No salt and pepper needed. This was FANTASTIC!

PHENOMENAL flavor! Followed exactly as directed except subbed chicken for the shrimp.  I only had 2 cans of coconut milk (one regular and one light) and it came out fine.  Tastes just like it's from my favorite Thai restaurant! I found my lemongrass @ Whole Foods at only 1.99 lb. Not bad!

Great recipe! Very filling soup though...I added a small hot red pepper because I like my food spicy. Turned out great! My friends loved it. It's such a shame that lemongrass ("citronnelle" in french) is so hard to find in France....

I would rate this a 5 star after the changes I made.  My husband & I like our Thai food spicy, so I added 5 Tbsp of red curry, about 1 tsp or more of red pepper flakes and 1 tsp of cayenne pepper.  I also added less then a 1/4 cup of chopped fresh Thai basil and about 8 Lime leaves.  I didn't have any shrimp so I added cooked chicken instead.  I didn't have any fresh shitake mushrooms so I added dried and put them in when the soup had to simmer for 15 minutes to soften them up.  We served it over Basmati rice - it was excellent.  Better then in a restaurant!

Yum! Per other reviewers, I cut the coconut milk down to 1.5 cans and doubled the red curry paste and added tofu and bean sprouts. A great meal. I'd double the recipe next time as well, I used this as a main course for four people and we ate every last drop - next time, I'd like some leftovers!

Awesome!! I am so happy to know the secret of making this absolutely fantastic soup. I didn't even have the lemon grass (I used the paste) or fresh ginger (I used powdered) and it still turned out better than any restaurant that I have tried!! Because we have a vegetarian in the family, I just sauteed the shrimp and added to individual bowls.

WOW! This recipe will save me $$ fulfilled my Thai cravings! Restaurant quality. I made it vegan with veggie broth and vegetarian fish sauce. Left out the shrimp and added extra mushrooms and cubes of tofu. Mixed in mung bean noodles for a hearty soup! Used lots of cilantro and sprinkled with crushed red peppers.

I swapped some fish for the shrimp, cut the amount of mushrooms and added some sliced onion, minced garlic, red pepper, and some edamame.

If the title of this is up your alley you will not be disappointed. I made basmati rice separately and added when serving. I separated the lemon grass sleeves but didn’t chop.  Also tweaked lime, curry paste, and ginger at the end by taste. Soooo delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

This soup is so tasty and versatile. I added more vegetable- bok choy, green and yellow peppers, mushrooms, sweet peas. I could have added more bok choy, bean sprouts, carrot bits, and more. It is so good. The toasted basmati rice might be good, too, if you wanted to add something of that nature.

We thought it was delicious! Only info I have to share is:
1. Two teaspoons of the red chili sauce wasn't spicy enough. I used only 2 teaspoons because a reviewer said it was too hot. We disagreed.
2. It's not a half hour of prep time, and 15 minutes max. The grocery shopping was more time consuming!
3. Be careful with the fish sauce -- I thought it tasted a bit too fishy, but my husband disagreed.
4. Rice isn't a necessity, although we did include it.
5. Lots of expense with unusual ingredients we didn't have, but still think it was worth it.

Overall, very easy and delicious!

This soup lightly spicy, packed with flavor, feels good going down. It's creamy, but not in a stick-to-your-ribs kind of way because it's coconut milk, not dairy. (BTW, I have no dairy issues). This is comfort food.

I used the full 3 cans of coconut milk (2 lite and 1 full fat). I would chop the lemon grass up a little more coarsely next time and I added red pepper flakes. It was absolutely amazing! My husband is sitting next to me just devouring it!!!!!

Really tasty!!! I substituted 1.5 cups of cashew milk for one of the cans of coconut milk to reduce calories, suspect I could get away with substituting two cans if I used coconut beverage (30 calories/cup rather than 400 calories/cup)! I couldn't get to the Asian Market to get the lemon grass, and it was still flavorful and delicious! Definitely going to make it again!

this was wonderful.  followed the recipe almost exactly.  didn't have it with me shopping so bought crimini rather than shiitake.  minor error but didn't think it made a difference.  also watched a tutorial (youtube) on lemongrass for soup which was very informative.  (this recipe says "mince" - i didn't like the reviews). i followed the video - chopped off both ends, cut middle part in two, pounded both parts with my rolling pin and put them in as per the recipe.  once you got to the adding coconut milk, i took the lemongrass out with tongs and discarded.   it was excellent without the shrimp but i had them to add so i did.    i also agree with another reviewer that the thai brand coconut milk is the best.  i shook it and it was much thicker than any other brand.  it did make a difference.   didn't have cilantro (forgot to buy it).  would i make it again?  definitely!

This recipe is delicious. My only suggestion is to cut the lemongrass in half, cook it in the soup and remove it at the end. Lemongrass is delicious and adds important flavor elements but it is a little soapy and tough when you get a bite in the soup.

The whole family eats shrimp but my youngest so I added rotisserie chicken. Let's be honest, our local grocery market makes their whole chickens better than I ever could. Lemongrass & Ginger paste are your friends. They hang out in the produce section. Canned Thai Coconut Milk unsweetened is creamy. Don't get it twisted with Coconut Cream. Add any veggie & you're good. I don't stick with tablespoons or cups, I size by smell and taste. I used baby bellas, brocolli, and fresh lime.  Thai curry paste was perfect but like the reviews I did it X's 4 with no real spice. Add thinly sliced fresh jalapeno in there if you desire some heat. My family loved it and had seconds. I had more than enough leftover for lunch the next day.

Excellent soup.  Didn’t chop the lemon grass just simmered in stock and removed.  Added a bit more of the curry paste and noodles at the end to make a full meal for me. Would make again  for sure.  Can’t wait to try it out on family.  Thank you for sharing your recipe and all the reviews.

Simple and delicious! The only modification I would recommend is to only use one can of coconut milk and add a couple extra cups of broth in its place. I used two cans the first time I made this soup and even that was too rich, and not in a good way. I'm not afraid of a rich creamy soup.

This was terrible. Mincing the lemongrass only makes for little sticks in your soup, and there was too much fish sauce. I tried pureeing the soup, didn't help. I simmered it for a while then strained it through a metal mesh strainer. This made it salvageable. I added some extra broth to dilute the fish sauce and then it tasted good.

Family loved it! Followed a few of the reviews. Lemon Grass cut long and strained out before adding the coconut milk. added extra curry paste as we like it spicy. Topped with a little lemon grass siracha...fabulous!

I have made this multiple times. Every time I get rave reviews and people ask for the recipe. I use the lemongrass paste from the Asian store instead of lemongrass. Otherwise I make it exactly the same. I’ve used boneless chicken thighs, a whole chicken, drumsticks, tofu... it’s very versatile. When using the chicken, I boil the chicken to make a broth, adding three whole cloves of garlic. When the meat is falling off the bone, (or falling apart if boneless), I just add the ginger, lemongrass and curry pastes directly to the broth without frying in oil. Comes out great! When using tofu, I use veggie broth so that my veg friends can eat it. Again, turns out great.

Absolutely delicious.   I cut the lemon grass as finely as I could and used a "tea ball" to infuse the flavor without the texture of the lemon grass.   Will definitely make again!    Though delicious as is, I may try other versions that some suggested (to just change it up):  using chicken instead of shrimp; adding bok choy, pea pods, bamboo shoots, and/or water chestnuts.

Way too much Coconut milk!  I thought 3 cans sounded like a lot, but I decided to follow recipe anyway.  It was bland and too milky.  I had to add heaps more Thai red Chili paste and add water  to dilute.  After several attempts at tweaking, I finally arrived at a decent flavor.  However it was a total waste of money using all that coconut milk.

Tastes pretty good. My family loved it. They asked that I make it again. I added both shrimp and chicken (I cooked thin cut chicken strips for 5 mins and then added the shrimp and cooked for another 5 mins) also added some cayenne pepper powder and turmeric. I made some rice on the side. My pot is almost empty!!

Great recipe- I accidentally used 2 tablespoons of red curry paste instead of 2 TEASPOONS. Needless to say we loved it anyway but our entire faces were on fire (in a good way). I appreciate recipes that allow me to try new types of food and aren't complicated to make- this met both for me!

Perhaps it's because I didn't use plain chicken broth (I used Knorr's Chicken Flavor Bouillon), but it didn't taste so great for me. The fish sauce flavor was too much for me. I also think the coconut milk is too much considering that there aren't many solid ingredients. I felt like I had made a broth and not a soup.

This was great after a few tweaks. The fresh lemongrass adds great flavor but does keep a sawgrass type firmness that I preferred strained out. I plan to crush the leaves whole to release the flavor during cooking of the broth then remove them or use lemongrass paste instead next time. I added onion and garlic during the first step for extra flavor and it sure did. I also like a deeper curry flavor so with the 3 cans of coconut milk found that much more curry was needed otherwise it tasted more like coconut milk. To serve i topped with fresh basil and drops of siracha. It was gone by my family in an hour and turned out fantastic!! I agree with some above comments that 2 cans of coconut milk would be fine....just less soup to eat.

Made per recipe except sauteed mushrooms in oil first.  It was edible but tasted thin, not flavorful/meaty enough, and probably too much fish sauce too.  Ginger & lemongrass were still a bit raw-tasting.  AWFUL lot of broth for the amount of shrimp & mushrooms.  Might be better with pork or chicken as well as shrimp, but honestly I wouldn't make it again, so that's beside the point.

Made to the T. My husband and I thought this was just ok.   It was very heavy with all the coconut milk.  I think I would try using fresh coconut milk next time, but think there will not be one as it was not our favorite.  On to something else that suits our desired tastes.

The flavor is great but the liquid volume was out to lunch.  The picture looks like to soup is loaded with ingredients such that they stack up above the liquid level.  I will make it again but next time I will cut down dramatically on the liquid ingredients.  I am anticipating half the chicken stock and only one can of coconut milk.  Everything else will be unchanged.

After looking at some pictures online, I added slices of lime at the very end. This was a mistake. Sadly, this ruined the whole pot, giving the soup a bitter flavor. Its not inedible, but its definitely not at all tasty. Plans to remake the broth and salvage the shrooms and shrimpies are in the works.

Very good as written. Don't be afraid to add some heat in the form of crushed red pepper or some  other type of pepper if you like spice. Very authentic. Will make again.

I would say this deserved 2.5 stars. I do not think this had the creamy coconut flavor I expect. It also had VERY little going on in the soup itself. It needed more veggies for sure!  We have a wonderful Thai place near us so everything gets compared to it. I will find another recipe to try next time.

My husband and I agree that this was terrible.  The fish sauce made it smell revolting.  I don't know what the other reviewers liked about it.  We threw it out.

This recipe has great potential. But it is missing something. The flavor was almost there, but it tasted way watered down. I'm going to work with it and try it again.

Pretty terrible.  I don't think the lack of lemon grass made the difference. The lime juice was a complete mistake. Too much fish sauce. Awful awful awful!

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars only because it is a very thin soup. It is extremely flavorful, but I like a thicker soup, so I added a cup of brown rice/quinoa blend and a spinach/kale blend to thicken it up. It went from really good to wow! But again, that's because i like thick soup.

Update: Don't use Goya brand coconut milk. It breaks and doesn't taste as good in this soup.

This soup is amazing. I used 2 cans of light coconut milk and 1 can of regular. It was creamy and delicious (I probably wouldn't have liked it with 3 cans of regular). Added some chopped white mushrooms as well as the shiitakes.  Next time I'll add a little cooked rice and cooked chicken (plus extra prawns) for a heartier soup.  But this soup doesn't need any changes- great as is!

Chicken stock to coconut milk ratio was way off. I ened up adding an extra cup of stock and it's still not enough. Tom kha is my favorite soup, so comforting and full of flavor, and I have it at least twice a month. I regrer choosing this recipe, my soup came out way too heavy and disappointing.

I did not like this at all.  And I even spent the extra money for good coconut milk and spices.  Husband liked it even less, but maybe that is just our taste.

Good, not great. Too fishy for me, and I made it exactly like the recipe except I used chicken and not shrimp. I might still make  it again, but would use 1/2 the fish sauce suggested.

I went to the local Asian market to get some of the ingredients I didn't already have at home. I should have watched the video first because I didn't chop up my lemongrass fine enough. It was still delicious! The lady at the Asian market gave me some lemongrass to grow in my garden for next time I make this....how cool is that! I will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe as written, but doubled it to make a huge batch for a large group potluck.  First of all, the pot was scraped clean, with many folks coming back for seconds and even thirds.  Second of all, I served this to my mother-in-law (gluten free, health-nut, etc.)  She had just had a version of this soup at an excellent Thai restaurant in town and said that my soup was better.  Also, I can't count how many people asked for this recipe, including mother-in-law. Next time I make this for my family I will cut the curry paste a bit- my kids don't like spicy foods- but for my husband & me it was just perfect. Try it. It is excellent.

Good flavor.  However, I like a lot more stuff in my soup.  I'd double the mushrooms and shrimp.  And, there is almost no kick.  I'd use more like 2 tablespoons of curry paste next time.  I used lemongrass paste in a tube which was all Kroger had for lemongrass.  Folks who disliked the chunks might try that instead.

Great soup base recipe! I made a few substitutions, based on what I had on hand - used homemade beef stock instead of chicken and added tofu instead of shrimp. Otherwise, followed the recipe. Super good, quick, and easy. I'll definitely be keeping this recipe on hand.

This is now my favorite chicken soup!  I used homemade chicken stock and a ready-made lemongrass-ginger-cilantro-chile paste I found at the market which worked perfectly, but also mixed in a little mild red curry paste.  I also added a few lime peels to the broth as it simmered (in lieu of kefir lime leaves) and used pre-cooked chicken breast instead of shrimp. I only made half the recipe this time -- will definitely be making this recipe again and again.

I made this recipe as it was written minus the shrimp.  It came very close to the soup we get at our favorite Thai restaurant.  We thought this version was not quite as light and fresh as theirs but still a winner.  In my own bowl I added a little extra cilantro, fish sauce and a little red pepper paste to kick it up a notch and it made it even better!!  I very much recommend this recipe.

Absolutely delicious! Made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it! Only changes I made we're using light coconut milk in order to lower calories and used strips of chicken breast instead of shrimp for same reason. We also added par cooked rice noodles to make it a full meal on its own. Absolutely fabulous!

This is a fabulous recipe.  So easy and so good!!!  Will make on a regular basis.  I added thinly sliced baby bok choy, as well as sliced water chestnuts for a crunch.  I also used 2 stalks of lemon grass.  I scored them so the flavour of the stalks would infuse easier into the broth, then I cut them into 3 inch pieces so they can be easily identified for removal when serving.  I poured the soup over rice noodles to make it more filling.  Thanks so much for this awesome recipe!

I use this recipe all the time.  I use soy sauce instead of salt and leave out the the fish sauce, just because I don't care for fish sauce at all.  When I use the red curry paste from the Asian store, the amount in the recipe is fine.  However, when I use the "over the counter" stuff from the supermarket, I need to up it a lot (like by 5-6 times) to get the same flavor.  I add a spinach/bok choy/chard mix towards the end of the cooking time and sometimes also use chicken instead of shrimp.  Also I sometimes only use 2 cans of coconut milk.  It works fine without mushrooms (for people with mushroom allergies).

This was great --I followed the recipe as written and it was yummy, then the next day, with the leftover soup, I tweaked some ingredient amounts more to my liking (I like more lime juice, chili paste and chicken) and I diluted it with water to match the soup at my favorite Thai place. Awesome. 
This recipe is a great template for a great soup that you can adjust to taste.

Stunning!  My hubby said it was the best meal I've made in years!!!  Doubled it, subbed 4 chicken breasts for the shrimp and used the mushrooms I had on hand.  Don't skip the lemongrass - it truly makes it.

I played it straight on most of the ingredients except I had to use lemongrass paste. It turned out awesome. I was seriously impressed. Super exotic and strange and delicious. Except I love my Thai food crazy hot, so I had to add around 15 dried Thai pepz

Took this to a soup party last night. Everyone loved it. Only changes made includes doubling the red curry paste, added 3/4tsp chili flakes, and one tsp siracha. The curry paste just wasn't adding that level of kick that I thought the soup needed. Turned out great. Thank you for the great recipe.

My pregnant wife had been craving Thai coconut soup and purchasing it from the local Thai restaurant. After I made this she said it was better than the restaurant and others tried it and were hooked. Very authentic, just add some more spice such as cayenne for a good kick. Also, the lime juice was too great of a quantity, so use about half of the recommendation from this recipe.

Adding to the other positive reviews, this soup is excellent.  It is really fun to make.  You'll definitely want to prepare all the ingredients before you combine everything.  I prepare all the ingredients and put them in little ramekins and add as I go.  This is a really fun recipe.  It tastes delicate and complex.  One of my favorites!!!  I also make some jasmine rice to go with it.

I have a dairy allergy so I LOVE this recipe.  It allows me to have a creamy rich soup with tons of flavor so I don't feel like I am missing out.

Really, really good. I was surprised to find it tasted just like restaurant Thai soups I've enjoyed in the past! I added about double the red curry paste (I used Thai Kitchen and I find their brand has very weak flavours) and I added Thai Basil, green onion and tofu. I also used half the amount of mushrooms. While it was cooking I added the herbs and reserved some for garnishing. This added a nice depth of flavour to the soup! Great recipe!

Also I used this advice from about.com on cooking with lemongrass
Simply cut the yellow stalk into 2-3 inch lengths. Then “bruise” these sections by bending them several times. You can also create superficial cuts along these sections with your knife, which will help release the lemon flavour. Add these bruised stalks to your soup or curry. When serving, remove the lemongrass pieces, or ask your guests to set them aside as they eat.

I made this last night and it was really good. The only thing I did different was used chicken instead of shrimp (didn't have any shrimp). I sauteed the chicken in the lemon grass, curry paste, fish sauce, and ginger. My only complaint was about the fish sauce, yuck! I live on the coast, I love seafood, but that was disgusting. Luckily, there is only a hint of the flavor, so it didn't ruin the dish. But, I certainly will leave it out next time. I will definitely try again, without the fish sauce.

When followed exactly, this recipe is fantastic and rates 5 stars. I've also added to and subtracted from it with great results. I've used left-over cooked chicken, green curry paste instead of red, added green onions and sliced summer squash, used soy sauce instead of fish sauce, omitted the lemon grass -- it always turns out delicious and I get many compliments.

Whooooooa.  This soup doesn't SEEM like it could possibly turn out that great when it takes, what, 30 minutes? But then, all of a sudden, it does. Word of warning: This stuff is RICH. You will inevitably get yourself a giant bowl because you tasted it and it's SO good, then you'll be in a food coma halfway through. This is not a bad thing. Just something to be aware of.

AMAZING RECIPE.

This is a great recipe with true authentic flavor.  I'm not sure why some other reviewers are complaining about hard or crunchy pieces of ginger and lemongrass--the recipe clearly states to grate the fresh ginger and mince the lemongrass.  If that is done properly, there are no hard, crunchy pieces.  The soup is rich and filling.  Next time I might try using the lite coconut milk to see what difference it makes in the overall presentation.

Best flavor!  Closest I've ever come to my favorite Thai restaurant.  I tried it with a couple changes as well to make a meal of it.  I added a chopped chicken breast and a 1/2 cup of rice.  It was delicious and also froze well.

I made the recipe to serve 5. Used 1 reg can of coconut milk and one light. Perfect. Did not mince lemongrass and crushed the ginger.  Added a little more shrimp (1 lb) and mushrooms (white button).Best Thai soup I've ever made.  Served with jasmine  rice.

This is a nice dish with several modifications.  Reduce the coconut milk to two, potentially even 1 1/2 cans.  I used two and it was a bit much.  I cooked two lemongrass stalks in the soup and then removed them before I served the soup.  Mincing one stalk is simply too little flavor.  I amped up the red curry paste, adding 3 tsp.  Next time, I'll add even more.  Next time, I'll add more mushrooms and some kind of green, probably bok choy.

I made this according to the recipe, but used chicken instead of shrimp due to an allergy and added dried kaffir lime leaves. I tasted it as I added the ingredients and it was the best after the first can of coconut milk. I ended up adding all three, which I now regret, but if I make it again I would just use one. This should help the fact that the soup was too broth-y; with three cans of coconut milk it needs more "stuff" in it--more mushrooms, baby corn, etc.

Perfect Recipe that I've combined with the Tom Yum Recipe on occasion, with fantastic results.

A pet Peeve of mine, is this:  When cooks put "Salt to taste" on their recipe.  I've had extensive surgeries and lack the 'human' range of taste, so if I salt it to how I like it or WHERE I can taste it, it'll be a great mouth-rinse for everyone else but a terrible dish.  So please, put an exact measurement when you post a recipe.  

Anyway, for this dish I put 1 tsp of salt for that volume of liquid, came out perfectly.  ALSO I added 1 tbsp of Lime.  This dish is so packed with flavor that it doesn't need too much salt to make it wonderful... but Salt is a necessary evil ;)

I have made this many times and I absolutely love it.  It is so easy, all in one pot and everyone into the pool kind of cooking.  I use the lemongrass in a tube when I can't find the real thing and it works perfectly.  I have also substituted chicken for shrimp and portobello mushrooms for shiitake with great results.  Today I used all of them together and loved it.  I keep thinking I don't like mushrooms and them remember how much I love this.

I used this recipe to make a healthier version of a Thai soup. They are usually laden with fat and salt. My substitutions are just a heaping tablespoon of Thai & True Red Curry Paste (mail ordered from Food Fight in Oregon - lower salt and ungodly good), low salt chicken broth, 2 cans of low fat coconut milk. I also use a T-spoon of the paste lemongrass because that's all I can get. I have been making it with both shrimp and chicken. It has been pronounced as "restaurant quality" by everyone fortunate enough to try it. It also doesn't seem to take anywhere near 35 minutes to prep. 5 stars but I'd happily give it 10!

This soup was so TASTY! My only complaint was the chewy bits of lemongrass. The next time I make this I would cut the lemongrass in 2-inch pieces and then remove them before serving. I didn't follow the recipe to a tee as I wanted to use up 3/4 cup of leftover coconut milk. I cut all the other ingredients in half and the soup was still super TASTY!

This tastes exactly like the soup from my favorite Thai restaurant. I crock-potted everything, adding the shrimp late in the cooking process, followed by the coconut milk about a half hour later (be sure to do this on low as that stuff will curdle if you get it too hot). Thank you so much to Jessica for posting this. You rock!

I made a vegan version of this yesterday. It turned out great. Substituted veggie broth for the chicken broth, no shrimp, soy sauce for the fish sauce, and added some chopped tomato and red pepper in with the mushrooms. Really yummy! Also, I cut the lemongrass into quite large chunks - that way, anyone not loving it could easily identify it and remove it before eating!

5+ STARS AS IS! To condense the 100+ reviews I read which most were;t anything but praising the original recipe from Jessica which I do wish she gave the name of curry paste she uses (I will mine-it's awesome) here we go:  (1) for a richness and depth like no other, if you can find dehydrated sliced shitakes (I get mine at a regular grocery store but also have at my local Asian market) or I've also used brown cremini in a pinch, rehydrate them and use the water with bouillon base for a more complex broth; (2) to make it more of a meal, per others I threw in at the same time as the broth a bag of broccoli florets with baby carrots; (3) I buy the A Taste of Thai 1.75oz (7-1tsp svgs) and use the whole package of red curry paste and it's perfect for my family heat preference which tends to be on the hotter side than some people; (4) I've never compared side by side Thai coconut milk vs coconut milk but others said there's a difference (Thai is thicker they said).  I buy the Thai coconut milk full fat and I'm an RD - some things are better (like real butter) for taste sensations but lite I'm sure is fine - I used 2 cans and 22cups extra broth and soup was still rich.  (5)  I wasn't sure if I'd like the lemongrass chopped texture so as author later recommended and others added, I threw in a whole lemongrass stick that I "bruised" first with blunt end of knife and took out before serving.  (6) I've subbed chicken and ground pork after trying with original shrimp - ALL are gr8!  Thx!

It was good but it didn't wow me. I served with rice and scallions on the side and threw the leftover rice and onions in the leftover soup. The next day I cut up some potatoes and cooked them in chicken broth. Added them to the soup and with the rice and potatoes it was more like a stew. Much better but still needed more flavor.

Excellent soup!!! Thanks for sharing it! As good Or better than the restaurant variety. I didn't use curry because it's not my favorite flavor (plus I wanted it to be whiter in color). So good.

YUMMY in my tummy!! It definitely reminded me of my favorite Thai restaurant's coconut soup. This really is a good recipe and I didn't even have all the ingredients and it was still delicious. I used shrimp paste instead of curry paste, I didn't have lemongrass so I settled for lemon juice and I used green onions instead of the cilantro. Next time I will get all the ingredients, because I know it will probably be even better. This one is a keeper!

Great recipe. Ended up using 5 teaspoons of red curry paste to get the spice level I wanted. Served over brown basmati rice I cooked in coconut milk and chicken broth. Amazing!

Very tasty.  I did not use lemon grass, but I did use all of the other ingredients needed.  A complicated thing to make, but most definitely worth it.  So delicious, and it impresses others easily!

In google I simply typed "best thai soup" and this page came to the top, fitting as this recipe is my idea of the perfect Tom Kha.  This was already my favorite dish but now I can make it at home and my family love it.  There is absolutely no reason to tinker with the recipe we just simply add additional slices of chicken breast which makes it more of a meal.  Now to find the perfect Thai Green Curry.

SOOOO good!  This is one of my favorite foods and I have always thought I could never make it as good as a restaurant and never tried it.  I was wrong!  Its perfect and I didn't even have any curry to put in.  I also used chicken.  I have a lemongrass plant and a lime tree so the fresh ingredients helped a ton!  Def don't skip the fish sauce.  I found it at H.E.B.  Great recipe and a new staple on my menu!

I don't think I've ever had all the ingredients at one time, but this still always turns out great! Lemon grass and fish sauce are ones I've never had -- I substitute green onions and lemon juice for the lemon grass and half soy, half worchestire sauce for the fish sauce. Love it!

Having been to Thailand many times myself and done Thai cooking classes there I was skeptical about some of the ingredients in this recipe. I still used glanagal instead of ginger and used 1 1/2 cans of coconut milk instead of 3, but what a winner! It tastes so authentic and is absolutely delicious!

I combined this with the Thai Curry Soup recipe on here by adding some Pad Thai noodles and a bit of spinach.  My husband thought it was good but he likes things spicy, so I added more red curry paste (cooking it by adding a bit more onion then adding it to the soup) and about a tablespoon of curry powder.  Super!  Served over white rice (if you have the noodles, white rice not needed, but it tasted great over the rice).

I made this recipe vegan and it turned out great.

Instead of using shrimp and mushrooms (fiance doesn't like them) I used carrots, broccoli, bok choy, baby corn cobs and bamboo shoots. I also used soy sauce instead of fish sauce and for the chicken broth I used a "chicken flavour" bouillon that is made from all vegetable ingredients. I also used the lemon grass paste as I went to two different grocery stores and could not find fresh at either. 

I felt after adding 3 cans of coconut milk (I used light coconut milk) that a lot of the great intense flavours got lost, that being said I had to add a lot more lemon grass and curry (I used green curry) and a bit more sugar and soy sauce. Next time I would probably reduce it to two cans. I also added some cayenne pepper and chilli flakes for spice. Overall, the soup turned out great.

Made this for the a family of 5, 4 of us loved it so 4 stars. 3 people don't like shrimp so I used chicken instead, also added toasted rice. Very nice soup, my 10 year old loved, loved it! I added extra lime to mine and totally agreed. Thank you!

Absolutely fantastic! Even my 9 year old told me this is the best thing I've ever made. We don't like shrimp so I did cook the chicken with the curry paste. I had spinach and it just felt right - so I added it at the end until it was wilted. It was so great to make something everyone enjoyed so much! Thanks!

This soup was amazing. Of course I love veggies so I put in half the shrimp and added onion, leek, green beans, and shredded cabbage. I used veggie broth ("Better than Bouillon" is what it's called)instead of chicken.  I could not find fresh shiitake mushrooms so I used a crimini and white mushroom mix. I put in 3 Tbsp of red curry sauce and it turned out perfectly!

This soup is AMAZING!   I only made a half-recipe, so used just 1 can of coconut milk.  I also used regular mushrooms & red peppers instead of shiitake mushrooms & shrimp, but will try with shrimp and/or chicken next time.  For the sake of convenience, I used the lemongrass that you can buy in a tube...just squeezed some in, didn't measure.  I thought this soup was so great, I took some in to work to let my co-workers try.  One of them asked for the recipe and made it later that week and could not get over how EASY it is to make!  It definitely does taste like it should be more work.  ;o)

Wonderful.  I used green curry paste and chicken instead of shrimp, then added carrots and bell pepper to make a chicken green curry and it was fantastic.  The broth is just as good as your favorite thai restaurant.

Husband loved it.  Very creamy and good.  I would chop up the lemon grass even finer next time.

The name says it all. As good or possibly better than the restaurant. This one nailed it. I used Galangal instead of ginger and chicken instead of shrimp but I'm sure it's just as good. Great recipe!

I was excited to try something new and different. This was good but I ended up adding more lime juice and a few drops of sriracha (Thai hot sauce) to make it more flavorful. Would probably add some asian vegetables if I make again. I served over basmati rice.

This was amazing! It is very close in taste to a local fancy thai restaurant's coconut soup, and next time adding a bit more curry paste will make it exact. I did use lemongrass paste, as I couldn't find fresh, and I used a bit more mushrooms and shrimp than called for. I will be making this again!

This was fantastic and very easy to make.  It was nice that most of the ingredients were those I had on hand or was easily able to purchase.  This turned out so tasty and would be a coconut soup I'd expect to buy at a restaurant.  I made some rice noodles (like those used for pad thai) on the side and added the soup to it, which made it incredibly filling.  My husband gobbled this up and we'll be adding this recipe to the recipe box so we can make it again.

Love this recipe.  Great tasting soup (VERY similar to the one at a local resteraunt) yet the ingredients are pretty easy to find and inexpensive.   Two thumbs up!  Thanks!  I've made it twice, once the origional recipe and once with chicken substituted for shrimp- either way it's great and doable in the crockpot (I added coconut milk the last 30min-hour in fear of scorching).

This soup is AMAZING!! The fresh and clean flavors are spot on. I did add ALOT of fresh Thai chilies, as I enjoy food as spicy as possible, increased the red curry paste, and even added some cayanne,  reduce the coconut milk to 1 can, (only to reduce fat/calories, as I am so addicted to this soup I could see myself gaining some serious weight otherwise! ) Such a delicious and healthy  soup, this is a definite fav. Oh, and do try to find fresh lemongrass, it really makes a difference and is easily found in most asian markets. The kaffir lime leaves I could not find, but used some grated lime zest, and as I mentioned, it was fab!!

I love this recipe.  It's just as good as the soup from the thai place down the street.   I can't find lemon grass stalks here so I add lemon grass in a tube that I buy in the produce section.  I add about two tablespoons.

We loved this soup!  We made it a vegetarian version:  Replaced shrimp with firm tofu and chicken broth with vegetable.  Added sliced baby bok choy to the bowls. The heat was too light.  Next time I will double the chili and add rice to the bowls before serving to make it more of a meal.

the title of the recipe says it all. It is the best. Only tweaking we did was add a little more curry paste (because we like it spicier) and instead of lemongrass which I couldnt find that day at local stores - I added about about 2 tsp of lemongrass paste/gel - this can usually be found in produce section around the containers of fresh herbs.  I froze leftover soup, and when reheating, added some fresh mizuna leaves to give it extra texture and punch.

Fantastic soup! I tweaked the recipe slightly and I think I enjoyed it even more: I used only 1 can of coconut milk to make the red curry flavor stand out more; couldn't find lemon grass but added bamboo shutes, red pepper, and green onion for nice flavor and texture and also tried the recipe with chicken instead of shrimp. If you decide to go with chicken, simply pan fry thinly sliced pieces of chicken breast and add to the pot at the same point where the recipe calls for the shrimp. For a more Vietnamese "pho type" dish I poured the soup over 1 cup of cooked vermicelli rice noodles and then topped with fresh cilantro and bean sprouts for added crunch. This dish tastes even better the next day! Check out my photos and happy souping!

Awesome soup! Everyone I've made this for LOVES it and has at least two bowls -- even my husband, who's very much a steak and potatoes, "no weird food" kind of guy. I've made it with shrimp once and I've made it with bay scallops, cooked about 2 minutes in their juices in a saute pan, then drained and added to the soup toward the end. It was absolutely wonderful, and I'll be making this soup with scallops from now on I think.

Excellent soup.  Very close to the Coconut soup that my local Thai place makes.  It was quite easy to prepare and tasted wonderful.  Perfect for the cold and flu season.

Brilliant!  I didn't have enough coconut milk so I made up with sour cream and creamed coconut.  Wasn't hot enough for me so I added some cayenne pepper at the end to finish it up.  The flavour really is excellent

Great recipe for awesome soup.  I suggest omit the red curry paste and use ground white pepper to give it a bite.  The coconut/lemongrass/ginger/lime is plenty of flavor and the red curry paste doesn't really add to it.  You can also make it with chicken instead of shrimp and its just as good. I sauted diced chicken breast and added that at the start instead of the shrimp at the end.  It is really important to add the chopped cilantro as a garnish when serving- you do not want the cilantro to cook in the soup. The flavor is exactly perfect when you add it at the last moment when serving.

This recipe is awesome and boyfriend approved! Next time I would simply put the inner yellow stalk of the lemongrass in the soup and remove it after cooking, to minimize the stringy pulp. I found a you tube video helpful in learning how to prepare lemongrass for soups.

Fabulous!  After eating some delicious soup at a well-known Thai restaurant in Atlanta, I wanted to try to duplicate it.  None even came close until I tried this one.  I had already roasted the chicken so I added both chicken and shrimp.  The only problem is that I should have doubled the recipe!  I also took the OP's suggestion and toasted the rice.  This was a fantastic way to serve it.  Even one family member who is not fond of Thai food loved this soup.  Thank you for adding this recipe.  It will go into my files under Favorites!

Good! I ended up only using 2 cans of coconut milk after tasting the broth - we like it strong and spicy. I also added bamboo shoots, yum. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a winner of a recipe that I've relied on a few times now! So easy, and makes for a REALLY tasty soup. I pretty much follow the recipe closely except for a few alterations. I've left out lemongrass for no reason other than I haven't felt like buying it (I've only found it in huge quantities in the store so far). I have made this with chicken, tofu, and snow peas instead of shrimp/mushroom. I also only use 2 cans of light coconut milk because the first time I made this, that's all I had on hand, but I've stuck to it since because I feel any more would make the soup too bland for me. I like a heavily flavored soup so I had a little extra of all the seasonings, especially the curry paste-- 2 teaspoons just does not cut it for me and my boyfriend. But overall, thank you for showing me how to make an AWESOME soup. I'm sure I will make this again and again.

MM MM Delicious!!  I made this almost exactly as written except for a doubled the amount of curry paste that the recipe called for.  I also used regular mushrooms since I did not have shitake.  Also I read on a different recipe--typically you don't eat the lemon grass it's for flavor and smell.  I cut the stalk in big enough chunks so they could easily be avoided. =)  Really unique flavor!

This recipe is FAB! Every time I make it, everyone loves it. I love it! It's so hearty and delicious. I do use the lemongrass whole, and remove before serving. I've also made with other kinds of mushrooms, if I can't find shitake. Honestly, it's hard to get it wrong. I pretty much stick to the recipe, besides adjusting head level and not dicing the lemongrass. My hubby says he likes it more than our local thai restaurant.

I have been looking for a good recipe for this soup, and this one made the cut!!! I made a few changes, i doubled the curry paste, just because i like it a little more spicy and i added potato chunks and quartered onions, because that is the way our local resturant makes it.  Fantastic!!

This easy recipe made a delicious soup.  I didn't mince the lemongrass but bruised it and cut it into big chunks.  I put these and some kaffir lime leaves into the pot while the soup simmered, but took out the lemongrass and lime leaves before adding the fish (I used skate wings and scallops instead of the shrimp).  It was an excellent meal, and I'm really glad I found it here.  Thanks for posting it.

The best soup I've ever made.  My husband &  I loved it.  My daughter liked it, but was a bit too spicey for her.

Very delicious soup. I substituted chicken for shrimp, and added in some red peppers and it was still great! Had a nice lingering warmth in the mouth.

This is a VERY similar recipe to something I threw together off of the top of my head. I change things occasionally just by a little bit: I personally prefer a little more curry, so I increase that just by flavor. Anyone familiar with curry would know you add it to your liking. Also, I like to add those thin, translucent rice noodles? I can't remember the exact name, but if I don't feel like rice, those noodles cook so darn quickly and blend perfectly with the soup.

I made this over the weekend.  I did a couple things different however.  I make all my soups on my grill for that delicious smoked flavor.  The other thing I did differently was I used my wife's homemade chicken broth, which I use on all my soups.  Delicious meal, but forgot to take a photo.

This is a hard one for me. I made it just as directed. I would double the curry paste next time and add 3 times the lime juice. It just tasted very bland. After adding these items, it was more flavorful.

Best recipe for authentic thai coconut soup. I use cremini mushrooms, and shredded chicken instead of shrimp. Since I am not a fan of oyster/fish sauce,  I replace it with soya sauce! Served with toasted bread (any type) is a taste out of this world!

This was completely delicious!  I had to make some minor changes due to available ingredients but it still turned out great. 
Substituted: shiitake mushrooms for portabella, lime zest for lemongrass, and green curry paste instead of red.  
Would definitely make it again.

I used 2 stalks of lemon grass & 2 cans of coconut milk & chicken, instead of shrimp. It was delicious! Yes, I would make it again. However, I would be more careful to try & choose more tender stalks of lemon grass. I might also add a little garlic & some rice noodles.

This is a great recipe!  I made this for a big potluck of foodies and everyone loved it.  I doubled it and made it just as is the recipe states the first time as I feel you really need to do that before making changes.  Now, having done that, here are the tweaks I will make next time:

It was soooooo good!   I made it with shrimp. I think, when I make it again, I will use at least one more teaspoon of the curry paste and another teaspoon of brown sugar.

Oh wow!  This is such a great recipe.  Excellent taste!  I used a bit more mushrooms because I love mushrooms and I doubled the red curry and the lime juice for extra spice and flavor.  Can't thank you enough for this recipe!

I was hoping this would be amazing but we didn't really like it. Bummer because it made a ton! I'd just leave the lemongrass stalk whole, maybe use only 2 cans of milk, way more curry paste, add veggies.

Pretty much followed the recipe and it was good.  I have a more elaborate recipe that I make with chicken and that will still be my go to recipe, BUT this is easy and we enjoyed it.  I would add a little more heat next time and maybe some bamboo shoots, but it's a good basic tom kha gai (the chicken version) recipe for those who are unfamiliar with Thai cooking.

I have made this a few times now and it is one of my favorite soups (and meals). The flavor is unique and layered; it reminds me of the soups I have had at my favorite Thai restaurants. I have followed the recipe exactly (for once) so far but I am going to try it without the shrimp next time. I like it with the shrimp but I have a hunch they are not necessary for the flavor that I enjoy. I use pre-cooked/peeled shrimp so that might make a difference. The mushrooms are a must though!

this soup is so delicious! it is full of flavors! the only thing i do is i put the chopped lemongrass in a small bag that i remove at the end because i do not really enjoy eating bits of the lemon grass. plus i added half of a spicy thai pepper it makes the soup even better!! this is the best thai soup!

Turned out delicious!  Amazing recipe.  Added only 2 cans of Thai coconut milk (one light and the other regular), instead of 3.  Like another reviewer, I also added water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, baby corn, and bean sprouts.  Doubled red curry paste.  YUM!!!!

This is the best thing I have ever eaten!!!! My family of four including my 10 and 13 year old agreed. I served it over basmati rice per suggestions. I couldn’t find lemongrass or lemongrass paste at my local country grocery stores so I used lemon zest per google substitution  suggestion.  I don’t feel like it’s missing anything and the flavor is very robust. Quick prep and a wonderful family meal

I would make this again but I would change it. First, somehow I missed the first paragraph that suggested serving with rice. Since it was called a "soup" I took that  literally. Feeling it was missing something, I quickly made some rice noodles which saved my dinner. The other issue I had is the shiitake mushrooms I bought were chewy. I am not sure if that is the nature of the mushroom or poor quality. Next time I will get them at Whole Foods, not Safeway or use button mushrooms. For us it wasn't hearty enough. Next time I would consider adding, scallops or calamari, maybe fish balls and serving with basil and jalapeno slices.

Subbed cooked chicken instead of shrimp for kid preference and Jasmine rice instead of rice noodles because I didn’t start soaking the noodles early enough.  Followed everything else to T. Tasted just like the soup at our Thai restaurant. Will try with shrimp and noodles next!

It was ok, but not great. I made it exactly according to the recipe, but it lacked flavor. Probably won't make it again.

It was good, super easy to make. I did not make any changes except I used regular mushrooms and kept the lemongrass whole. Not as much flavor as I would have liked but it was still very good. Next time I will add more curry paste.

The lemon grass and cilantro are the perfect balancers for this savory soup.  The nutty flavor of the shiitake mushrooms make it a perfectly smooth warmth.  I will definitely make it again.

Very good soup. I’m not experienced in Thai cooking so the fish sauce really scared me. It stunk so bad I was almost afraid to try the soup. Ha! Had to get lemongrass in the tube and used quite a lot. I like spicy and it wasn’t very spicy so I added more curry paste towards the end. I also added the juice from entire lime which was close to twice as much. Curious how it would be without the fish sauce because the smell really almost ruined the experience for me but the soup is really yummy!

This is really a delicious and easy version to make. While I love making authentic Asian recipes using ingredients purchased from Asian markets, I made this elsewhere where we didn't have all the fresh ingredients.  I didn't have any red curry paste on hand, so I substituted chili garlic sauce instead (the unsweetened variety). Although the red curry paste would have been more authentic, this worked out beautifully. I subbed fresh lemongrass for the lemongrass in the tube at most grocery stores but used a really fresh, juice knob of ginger root. We chopped some large shrimp and put it in the bowls before serving. I added brown oyster mushrooms and fresh shiitake as well.  I used a whole lime because adding it too soon diluted it when we were ready to serve.

Delicious!  I added more shrimp because hubby likes protein!  And then I added a bit more chicken broth and lime to account for it.  Unfortunately, I didn’t have fresh lemongrass or ginger so I had to use paste - I can’t wait to make it again with the fresh herbs.  You have to make this dish!!

I added carrots, onion, bok choi and 1 tsp salt to broth at the beginning of cooking.  Left out the brown sugar.  Used mahi mahi for the fish.  Just before serving, I add tofu shirikaki noodles.  
Leave out the fish and add more shiitake mushrooms for vegetarian.

OMG! The name of this soup in right on point! I made this according to directions except for using the tube of Lemongrass Paste as others recommended. The spiciness was perfect for almost any but the fussiest of palates. It was easy to make and so wonderful served on a be of fluffy basmati rice! I will definitely make again , probably as a company dinner.

I don't understand all of the rave reviews for this recipe. It tastes like sweet coconut milk with shrimp in it. Very little flavor or nuance. If you like a ton of sweet coconut milk with some shrimp in it, well, this is the recipe for you.

I followed the recipe, except that I used lemon grass paste instead of the stalk, and increased the fish sauce, brown sugar and lime juice to taste.

It turned out delicious, so this recipe is a keeper.  I plan to make it again this week.

ZOMG!  SOOOO good!  My new favorite.  I used baby bella mushrooms because shitakes aren't in season, and I didn't want to spend $5 for a ¼ oz of dried shitakes.  Also didn't use any lemon grass, and didn't see the note about lemon grass paste until after I got home from the store.  Next time I make this I will probably also increase the curry paste and grated ginger to embolden those flavors a little.  Last note is that rather than vegetable oil at the start of the recipe, I used sesame oil.  Seemed like it would be more authentically Asian that way.

We enjoyed this soup over jasmine rice. I will make a few changes next time I make it. I like more curry flavor so I’ll double the curry and cut the fish sauce in half. I added rotisserie chicken cut in bite sized pieces instead of shrimp. The chicken really soaked in the flavors well.

Excellent recipe! I did want it more spicy, and although the red curry paste I found said very spicy, no matter how much I added, it wasn’t enough. So I added “Hot Chili Oil” by Dynasty. Ended with the perfect spice that I was looking for.

Delicious recipe. It is good as is or you can add other veggies/meat. My wife and I love it with chicken (sear with the ginger/lemongrass/paste and then make as per the recipe) and butternut squash chunks. Makes a huge batch too so we usually freeze some :)

Bursting with flavor.   I didn't have lemon grass, so just left it out.  Also I don't adore mushrooms, so I substituted about 1/2 of a zucchini, sliced.  Added 4 small scallions because I wanted to use them up.  Otherwise I followed the recipe closely.  Delicious.

I enjoyed this recipe very much! I added extra ginger, lemongrass paste, fish sauce, and red curry paste. I would definitely recommend tasting as you go and add as needed.

I cut back on the coconut milk and used one can and used vegetable broth instead. Then I doubled up on the red curry paste. And added jalapeños to the oil as i fried the ginger and lemon grass. It was delicious and the people I made it for loved it!

I used Mae Ploy red curry paste and you do need at least a generous tablespoon. To make a plant based version you can use mushroom or vegetable broth and skip the meat. The soup is still totally delicious. To be fully plant based you would need to use something like coconut aminos or soy sauce, but the flavor is not as good with that substitution- still pretty good.

Delicious! I love Thai food and I am happy this was a simple recipe. I had to make a few tweaks for my own diet and it was still delicious. I had to leave out fish sauce bc I could not find it in the store. I also omitted soy sauce bc of high sodium and I can't have soy in my diet :( It was still amazing! i also added fresh lemongrass during the cooking. I cut back on the coconut milk to 2 cans instead of three and. I highly recommend fresh shrimp for this. Frozen will be disappointing.

I added 1 tomato cubed in 1" pieces and a handful of carrots.  It needed more spice so I added some red pepper, but would better to add a thai chili instead.  Only used 1 can of regular coconut milk

Love this soup! I didn’t have shrimp, so just omitted them. Added two chopped green onions and two chopped seeded jalapeños from my garden (mostly for color) but otherwise made as written. Served it with some hot chili oil and it was amazing!!

Wouldn't call this a soup; it's simply a shrimp curry! Used basil instead of cilantro. The curry base would work well with mussels or cod.

Great recipe. I've made this three times now & one of my favorite easy go to's. A must try. I do change it up a bit or add more ingredients. Last week I added chicken instead of shrimp. I have sassal in my garden so I use that instead of lemon grass. But sooo yummy!!!!

I think overall this was good.  I did find it to be a bit too fishy.  Adding extra lemon did cut down on that some.  I would probably cut the amount of fish sauce next time.  My husband really liked it, as it was, though, so that is probably just a matter of preference.  There are a lot of choices in fish sauce, also, so maybe a different one would have been a little better for me.

I changed the recipe based on the ingredient I had at home. I used chicken instead of shrimp, no lemon grass, and no mushrooms. I did add zucchini, carrots, and bell peppers. It turned out great. Sometimes you've got to work with what you have. It's a very flavorful dish. I will be making it again.

Easy to make and company worthy!  Authentic deliciousness!  Tip:  check the freezer section of  your Oriental market for "minced lemon grass".  There is also a squeeze bottle with ready to use minced ginger.  I find fresh is best though.  Enjoy!

Great starter kit to Thai soup. I added more shrimp and crab legs... along with extra veggies ( red and green peppers, green onion, puréed based of tomato, garlic and ginger) to make the soup more filling. Also I doubled the amount of curry because we love spicy. It was perfect held out on the fish sauce because I thought I had some while shopping for ingredients but realized I didn’t later. Did nothing my soup was still so amazing my wife couldn’t believe it. Make it your own. This is a good starter recipe as I mentioned!!! Thanks!!

The flavor of coconut milk can be very heavy & overpowering. I wanted a lighter version of the soup. I only used 1 can full fat coconut milk, used 6 cups chicken broth  and almost doubled the amount in water. I did not mince lemomgrass or ginger; left portions and strained out later after infusing broth.  After adding much more fluid that the original recipe called for, I Increased red curry paste to 1tablespoon to maintain flavor & kick . Also added cubed eggplant.  After modifications I would make this dish again.

Unlike most of the other comments,  I would use one cup less of the chicken broth and one cup more of the coconut milk.  This was delicious and very authentic.

Oh My...  Love, Love, Loved it.  This is one of my fav's. and I always order this at my favorite Thai restaurant.
I added: shredded chicken breast  (rotisserie), lime juice to taste  (we love citrus), shrimps w/ tails on  (more flavor), 1 1/2 cans light coconut milk  (to reduce fat content; although I am sure it tastes richer w/ regular coconut milk), and red chili flakes.    Follow the recipe...
Once you get all the ingredients together the soups comes along very fast.  Delicious -  5 Stars

Didn't last long enough to take a picture -  yummy.

This was great. I found the coconut milk over powering so I doubled the curry paste and added a bit more ginger.  I have a pretty small selection in my small town so I substituted oyster mushrooms and it worked out well.  Also added sprouts and vermicelli noodles.

Great Thai coconut dish flavor! Husband and son loved it. I only had jumbo shrimp so I used it, but in the future I'll buy medium shrimp so it's bite sized. Thanks for a great recipe!

Not a fan of shiitake, I'd say just use baby portebellos, and slice them up and put them in after the soup is done cooking, they are so good fresh in the soup. Also the taste overall didn't blow me away.

Was very good, would make again without mincing the lemon grass. The texture of it was too hard, it made it hard to enjoy the soup when you always had hard pieces in every bite. Next time i will crush and leave the lemon grass whole, and remove it from the soup before serving.

The base dish itself really lacked the punch of flavor I was hoping for, coming out rather bland. However when I doctored it up with extra red curry, black pepper, garlic, and lemon it ended up being really delicious. I wish I could rate it based on that, however the base flavors were lackluster. Not bad, but not great.

I followed the recipe the 1st time I made it. Since then I have made a couple tweaks. I aded carrots when i got it to the 15 minute simmer, i added water chestnuts and red pepper at the end. I also upped the ginger, lemon grass & red curry paste. This is a staple dinner in our home.

I think it definitely needs a little more red curry paste. But this recipe is a great base for making it how you would like this Tom Kha. Some variations you can try are; When I order this soup at restaurants, they often have whole lemongrass shoots in the soup along with whole bay leaves. Another variation is adding tomatoes to the soup. It adds a little depth to the flavor. When I made it, I used chicken instead of shrimp, but you should put the chicken in sooner than they say to put in the shrimp, so it has a chance to cook longer. Also, just on it's own, it is a little bland. Thai restaurants usally have this marked as a hot/spicy dish, so add that thai chili sause to ramp up the heat. 

But like I said, this is an excellent base to make this soup your own, which is the spirit in which I believe this soup is meant to be made in.

I made it exactly as directed and it is delicious. If you don’t love coconut, then I’d suggest using less coconut milk. Otherwise, it’s perfect.

WOW! This soup is fantastic! I don't believe in tweaking a recipe the first time so the only thing I did different was use fresh lime leaves instead of juice. If you process the lemongrass in your food processor it brings out the flavour and makes it easy to eat. A new favorite!

This is an easy and delicious recipe.  Instead of veg oil I sautéed everything in coconut oil and  I added more curry (about 2-4 oz) than listed in recipe b/c I wanted the most flavor to come through and I’m glad I did. I couldn’t find fresh lemongrass so I used a tubed lemongrass which still tasted awesome.

really good! heavy on the creaminess though so its hard to eat a lot of it by itself. it would be awesome on rice! next time I think I will add a tad more curry paste and some chili flakes to add spice. it would also be really good with more veggies mixed in.

A little sweet at 1st but full of coconut milk flavor.  2nd helping after 2 hrs had a nice kick.  VERY DIABETIC friendly. Probably less than 15-20 carbs per large serving.

Great stew. I added a small can of lobster bisque and some partially cooked cod when reheating the stew the next day. Even better. Also recommend chopping the lemon grass very fine.

 Finally something my husband and I agree on!  (I used oyster sauce instead of fish sauce bc that's what had in my kitchen)

I made this into a vegan soup so I eliminated the fish sauce and shrimp.  It turned out great. Yesterday my husband and I tried it for lunch before serving it to guests tonight. I added some chili pepper flakes after having it for lunch yesterday and tonight before dinner I added some bok choy. NICE!

Followed the recipe to a T.  It looked exactly like to photo but the overwhelming flavor was fish sauce.  It may be just my taste buds but I don't think I will make this recipe again.  It sounded so good; maybe I will try without the fish sauce

I like coconut a lot. But this was too much coconut flavor. Like many other reviewers, I would suggest at least one fewer cans of coconut milk and another 2 cups of broth. Depending on the strength of the curry paste you buy, I would increase the amount by 50% to 100%--ditto for the lime juice. I made a shrimp stock for this, but next time I will try it with chicken and chicken stock with the modifications I mentioned before to get a Tom Ka Gai taste for the soup.

Delicious! A few changes: I used DOTERRA lemongrass essential oil.  (4 drops) It was very good. One chicken breast diced and sautéed with the red curry paste & ginger. The red curry paste I bought wasn't spicy at all so I used 3.5 teaspoons. I used one can reg. coconut milk, one lite and added more chicken broth. It was the perfect coconut flavor. Not too strong.  I toasted (in a skillet) 1 cup of jasmine rice and added it with the mushrooms & simmered a few extra minutes . Added a little bit less shrimp b/c I added some chicken. Also added some chopped cilantro into soup with the lime and let it simmer.  It adds nice color. Definitely will make it again!

We didn't have all of the ingredients required, so did make a couple of substitutions and additions.  We used lemongrass paste since our local store didn't have fresh lemongrass and substituted a tin of hearts of palm for the mushrooms since one of our group does not like mushrooms.  Also added some asparagus tips and likely way more cilantro than required!  It was delicious and enjoyed by all.  We also added some leftover grouper to the soup the next day and it complemented it nicely!

I will definitely make this soup again.  We made a few changes such as using two cans of coconut milk instead of three and swapping out shredded chicken for the shrimp.  Next time I will make it with shrimp because I love shrimp, but a few of my guests did not, thus the chicken.  The chicken was very good though.

I didn’t have any fish sauce so I put in some worcestershire sauce instead. A little anchovy paste or mashed anchovy would have worked, too. Soup was more delicate than I expected -still delicious! Timing recommendations worked perfectly. Don’t skip the rice: spooning this over a side bowl of hot rice is heaven!

Very good! I sautéed the mushrooms before adding them to the soup, just because they looked kind of blah beforehand. I don’t know if it actually added anything...but it looked better going in!

Followed the recipe. Only difference was use of lemon grass paste. 
Lime juice and cilantro brightens it up.

First off, lemon grass is tough and woody.  Sautéing it, makes it tougher.  Doing some research afterwards, I found that you should peel the lemon grass, take the thickest piece and smash it.  Then toss it into to flavor the soup, not eat it.  That is why I’m giving it a 3 stars. Good flavor, but tough woody lemon grass ruined it as described in this recipe.

This was very good and we loved it.  Yes, it is rich but not too much so, in our opinion, and is very filling.  Made as written with lemon grass paste as I didn't have any fresh on hand (the store that supplies the fresh is across town and the we rock the lazy chef approach).   Used approximately 2 tsp of the paste in place of one stalk of fresh lemon grass.  When it came down to the final taste test, we decided to add another tsp more of lemon grass paste along with 2 TBLS of fresh Thai basil.  Served over sticky rice garnished with additional basil, cilantro and more fresh limes.  Would also be great with zoodles and other veggies or just on it's own.

Followed recipe exactly and added a tablespoon of chopped garlic to rue as well.  Personally, I think the garlic tied the room together, but I do love garlic.

Made this and didn't make any changes. Very good flavor but I,  personally,  would have liked it with more heat. I added siracha to my bowl along with extra red curry paste and it was delicious.  Will definitely make again!

This soup was amazing.  I did reduce the amount of coconut milk and the fish sauce.  I of-coursed increased the curry paste and added some dice potatoes instead of mushrooms.  The texture and flavor of this is really good, as good if not better than restaurant verities and I know exactly what is in it.

I server it over rice noodles.  Delicious and will definitely make it again.

This soup  was excellent.  It was easy and fast to make.  I only gave it four stars because I remember the soup having a slightly more robust  flavor.  To be fair, I used a lemon grass paste since I didn't find any fresh lemongrass. It is possible that the restaurants make their own curry paste. Next time I will add more shitake mushrooms as well as curry paste.
I will make this again.

Best thing I've ever made!  I used 3Tbs lemongrass paste in place of fresh, 3Tbs Thai roasted red chili paste in place of the curry paste, added about 1.5Tbs curry powder and reduced the fish sauce to 2Tbs.  With the chicken broth, I added cabbage, julienne carrots, & broccoli.  I also used 2 cans of lite and 1 can regular coconut milk.  I served it over thin rice noodles and topped it with sprouts, cilantro & green onions.  Amazing!  I've never made anything twice but, I just might have to with this.

I couldn't find lemon grass so I looked I looked it up and substituted with 1t/stalk lemon zest.  Also, I couldn't find red curry paste so I also looked it up and substituted with 1t. red curry powder and a little thai chili sauce.  It was very tasty and my husband and I both enjoyed it.

Excellent. Maybe just 1 can of  coconut milk and some chicken broth to up the volume. And for the reviewer who claimed cilantro is only used in Mexican dishes.....wrong! Cilantro is used extensively in Asian cooking.

I had to use powdered ginger and cut the recipe into 1/3 because I was home alone last night. It was just delicious! I will try to remember to get the fresh ginger next time - probably will get 5 stars from me then!  I did put the chopped lemon grass in a cheesecloth bag, by the way. The stalks were extremely woody and I couldn't imagine them tasting good. Thanks for sharing a really tasty and simple recipe!

Loved this recipe! I didn't have everything, so I did have to make a few alterations. 
tube lemon grass for fresh lemongrass
soy sauce for mushrooms (google suggested it) 
lemon for lime

Seriously the best soup I've had and LOVED having it with rice, it was an easy stress free dinner that I was not expecting to love, but loved!

This is a very addictive soup!  Incredible recipe. I tried it with different proteins like shrimp and chicken,  This will forever be in my recipe box of goodies.  Thank you Jessica!  I did put some minced fresh garlic in for another dimension of background subtleness.

It needed more flavor.  I kept adding more and more red curry paste (probably 2 T to get some flavor).  I think some green onions might have added flavor.  I also added a clove of minced garlic.  It just needed "something more" and never quite got there.

I tweaked it. I use 2 tables spoons paste or more sometimes. Don't have lemon grass till summer. Don't use fish sauce don't need the extra salt. Sometimes I put sugar in it. I use 2 cans coconut milk and about 4 cups broth or to taste. I use little more broth than I like but, stretches the meal out. I change it up at times, sometimes adding coriander or turmeric, nutmeg. I used this recipe and couple others as guidelines. I gave 5 stars though I never made it exactly according to this recipe. I make curry about once a week .

I make this and have been for 15 years...this is a really good version but mine is vegan with a little more kick as it should have.
 
You don't need fish sauce
I use an entire jar of red curry paste
1/2 cup of brown sugar or to taste the paste and sugar need to be a perfect balance

Try adding 
3-4 potatoes (cubed and boiled)
1 red onion sliced very thin
2 cloves of minced garlic
1 each red, green, orange and red bell peppers sliced very thin
2 - canes canned tidbit pineapple (drained)
2 - water chestnuts (drained)
2 cups shredded carrots
1 - can bean sprouts (drained)
6 - cubed roma tomatoes

THAI  brand red curry paste is the only one to use...the other brands just don't cut it.  (You can get it on Amazon)
Canned coconut milk
Vegatable broth...

This recipe is excellent even if some ingredients are skipped and is very simple.  I have left out lemon grass and lime and we prefer the reduced acidity.

This is so good! We added bamboo shoots, a little sriracha, and used chicken stock instead of broth. We also boiled the shrimp peels in the stock before adding the broth to the main pot to give it some extra flavor.

Never had anything remotely like this before - gave it a go.  Everyone liked it.  Great for cold days.  I followed the recipe except used stalk cut up and then removed as per other reviewers.  Should have added more red curry paste - I didn't read Jennifer's follow up - oops.  So to correct it I added some ground fresh chili paste.  Also will add some brown rice to give it more texture.  Glad we have plenty left over for lunch tomorrow.

Might have been a 5 star but no curry paste. Boo. I didn’t use curry powder as substitute because that’s wrong.  Took me longer than 35 minutes to prep.

FABULOUS!!  Restaurant quality!  I doubled the amount of shrimp for my hungry family and yet the amount of liquid was able to handle it with plenty of broth left over.  Two family members told me to omit the cilantro next time-not fans.  My lemongrass stalks were chewy so I may put lemongrass paste in next time as well.  The flavors were so sophisticated.  I even added some slices of lime like the main photo for presentation--so pretty.  I served the soup with a packaged "Asian-Inspired" salad that included a dressing.  Note:  later this same evening I watched a YouTube video on how to prepare lemongrass stalks, so I may try the stalks again.  This was my first time.

Was so good!!! I cut in half (just in case we didn’t like it).  Added like 4x the amount of curry paste as once the milk was added was pretty tame.  Think I will add chopped bok Choy next time as well

I love this soup and have made it a few times now. It taste so much like the Thai restaurant that inspired me to try and make one. Strong flavours and husband likes it a lot as well. We add onions because onions go in everything we make lol I mix it up sometimes and add noodles; also had salad shrimp leftover from another dish and used them once and that was a good choice.

Was pretty close to our local Thai place. Made it in a Ninja Foodie. Used chicken and added white mushrooms, baby bok choy, baby corn and snow peas. Served with chicken satay and mango sticky rice, was a hit! Great recipe.

I only used 2 cans of coconut milk and I used regular white mushrooms, those were the only changes I did and this turned out fantastic! A keeper for sure.

This was so good! I doubled the amount of: ginger, lemongrass, curry paste and sugar. i used the juice of 2 limes, plus the zest of one. and i used chicken as my protein - i added this when i added the broth and let it simmer in the spices and coconut milk. i used the full amount of both fish sauce and coconut milk and wouldn't change a thing. i also added red onion, sliced very thin, when i added the mushrooms. finally, i also threw in some thai basil at the very end because my local asian market had some for sale today. this was very good and i will definitely make again!

It’s good. Doubled the red curry paste and cilantro. Would probably like more ginger, too.

This was really just mild red curry with shrimp, but it was pretty  good.  I made it exactly per the recipe, which is literally the same as many Thai curries.  Good.

Delicious! I didn't have any lemongrass but I substituted the zest of a lemon and a lime, as well as added extra lemon juice.  I also added small heirloom tomatoes and green onions. My husband loved it and will definitely make this again.

Very tasty! Just simmered with the full lemongrass stalk (cut into 3 pieces, and slit down the centre) as don't like the crunchy bits of minced lemon grass. Other than that, didn't change a thing!

The flavor was decent but there wasn’t much to the soup.  I added zucchini to give some depth, should have added other items.  Otherwise it’s just shrimp, broth and mushrooms.

Very good recipe. I doubled the red curry paste, cut back on the fish sauce by 1 Tb. I didn’t have cilantro so added Thai basil instead. We like spicy, so added a birds eye chili and half a jalapeño. Also, added snow peas. I would probably cut back by 1 cup on coconut milk and replace with chicken broth next time.

Made this dish and it was great. My wife does not like shrimp so I subbed out with chicken thighs. I also made some tweaks to make it keto friendly. Pretty much just used coconut oil, chicken thighs, and swapped the brown sugar for Swerve brown sugar.

This was really good, but a little too sweet and coconuty for my taste, so I added almost double the amount of curry paste, and added siracha for a kick.

I had only two cans of coconut milk, and I added about twice as much red curry. I would absolutely make it again. I used frozen raw shrimp. There were no leftovers!

Very good recipe. For us it was a little mild, so added some red pepper and turmeric. But the recipe as written was good, aromatic and flavorful. Also looked better than what you get in most restaurants!

I did this recipe with chicken and it was amazing.  I also added a sliced jalapeno for just a little tiny kick - just right - and used a few drops of lemon grass essential oil instead of lemon grass.  Saute the chicken in the oil with the ginger,  remove and cube while the curry is cooking with the ginger, then add it back, stir to coat and then add the the rest of the ingredients. delicious!

This soup is so simple to make and sooooo good! I sometimes substitute chicken for the shrimp. Also found that I can freeze the lemongrass and use it later. I don't mince the lemongrass, I just cut it in thirds and throw it in like a bay leaf

This was delicious! Even our picky 16-year old emptied his bowl. I used 3 teaspoons of curry paste, added 1/2 cup of rice during the initial 15 minute simmering, and I added 1/2 pound of sliced chicken breast...it was wonderful, fragrant and filling.

Absolutely one of the greatest soups you will ever have!
I have made this many times and it is great with chicken too.  (In place of shrimp or in addition to) Excellent recipe!
Use chicken Breast or thigh (Boneless/skinless).
Cube or slice into small pieces, brown and set aside. 
Add the chicken to the broth and coconut milk and simmer for 10 minutes. 
Also, I add Kaffir  lime leaves to give the soup that extra exotic taste. Enjoy!

So easy to make and delicious.  I used a tablespoon of dried lemon grass instead of a stalk.  I also added a can of sliced water chestnuts, carrots and a potato because I had some veggies I needed to use up.  Love the flavors, especially after they simmer for a while.

This recipe was great but I made some alternations like adding onion, garlic, half of a lemongrass (not grated), rice noodles, different  mushrooms, 2 tablespoons of red curry and only one can of coconut milk. It had a ton of flavor.

I used a homemade fish stock instead of chicken and substituted the shrimp with a haddock, even though shrimp would have been better but my son won't eat them.  It was still really good.  I also made my own red curry paste to add, and froze the rest for future use.

The family loves this. I overcame the grainy lemongrass by combining it with the ginger and red curry paste along with two tbsp of olive oil in a food processor on high for half a minute.

Will do again! Rarely make changes the first time out, but this time, I had green curry instead of red and used it. Milder, but still very good. I was sharing with someone I don't usually feed, so milder really was better..

This is a great easy recipe! When sauteing the lemon grass and ginger, I also added minced garlic, chopped green onion and red bell pepper.  Very flavorful! Hubs and I loved it!

Love this recipe!  For a little extra Asian flavor, I use sesame oil instead of the vegetable oil and also I add one thinly sliced onion.

Made it and love it! We are mushroom lovers at our house, so I doubled the the mushrooms. Couldn't find lemon grass at our local grocery store, so had to leave it out. It was a huge hit at our house. As with all Thai dishes (I've learned through experience), don't skimp on the ingredients. Get high-quality curry paste and fish sauce, even if they cost more--it'll make all the difference!

Fabulous and autentic. I used 2 tbs of red curry paste and it was muy caliente let me tell you. I loved it but I almost burned my husbands face off. Maybe I will stick to the recipe so I do not trumatize my hubby and 4 year old(I just added sugar to my little girls (to balance the hot) and she ate it no problem!)

This was delicious but I did have to add much more fish sauce and ginger than what the recipe recommended.  In my opinion, this was required to get a rich, deep flavor.  Also, I recommend cutting the lemon grass into bigger pieces so you can fish them out after.  Finally, I added bigger strips of ginger as well as minced so that I could get a nice bite of the spice with my spoonful every once in awhile

This soup was just ok to us. Followed the recipe, but it seemed to be lacking complexity, and while it definitely tasted Asian, it did not seem like the other Thai soups I've had at restaurants. I won't make this again.

I nixed the mushrooms, added lobster and scallops, and added a dash more coconut cream. This soup was delicious and even pleased my mom! The best part, it’s appropriate for Celiacs’ diets!

Delicious! I added more shrimp and mushrooms to this recipe because I had extra that needed to be used, though it was a little more stew than soup because of it, and served it over Jasmine rice. Hubby and I both enjoyed it. The only change I'll make next time will be to add about a quarter teaspoon of crushed red pepper, just to add a little kick, and to use a food processor to blend the lemongrass, ginger and curry paste. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing.

This is delicious and now part of my normal cooking.  I actually use the already minced lemongrass that comes in a tube and it is great.  You can also add chicken if you don't like shrimp.

I just would like to put my review for people who doesn’t have right ingredients :-) this recipe is amazing for alterations ! 
I had green curry paste so I used that instead, but I wanted that red oily speckles on top so used some annato seed oil instead of regular oil. I used shrimp paste in place if fish sauce and sautéed all these with some lemongrass stalks, gibger and minced carrot and garlic paste. Thinned all these with chicken stock and after briefly simmered, added shrimp coconut milk , glass noodles and Korean green onions. 
Turned out amazing so please do not put away this recipe away and read other reviews too people were very creative and substitute bunch if stuff but everyone raves how amazing he soup turned out to be!

so incredibly delicious.....Made a couple of minor changes which only made the soup more hearty....& added to the amazing flavor.  Will be adding this recipe to my regular "go-to favorites":
-included extra ginger (& more salt due to potatoes)
-diced a few potatoes
-thinly sliced a couple of carrots
Added both to the soup along with mushrooms.

This is an excellent soup. I would add more mushrooms next time and add more cilantro to the soup itself rather than garnish. The shrimp flavor kind of got lost though. Next time I may use ground pork.

Made as instructed, except I only had a tablespoon of ginger to grate and I used 2 tbsp of fish sauce - this is absolutely awesome! Just the flavor from the mushrooms and broth was great, but adding the shrimp & lime puts it over the top. Will most DEFINITELY make again! Really made me feel better on such a discouraging cloudy day!

This is a bi weekly meal for us! We love spicy so I always double the red curry paste. I also add green peppers & reduce the coconut milk. We always eat it over white rice!! But it’s also amazing by itself.

My husband had 3 bowls of it! Very good flavor. Unfortunately, I could not find lemon grass so I added some lemon juice. I'm sure it would've been even better with the real deal. I also added a diced yam and some bok choy. You could add any vegetable you like, really. This will be a mainstay meal for my family.

We are following a mostly new pant based diet with some pescatarian days. Oh, MY!!! This was sooo amazing! Hearty, warm spice, robust burst of the lemongrass and other flavors was delightful! We’ve eaten A LOT of raw foods, which we also enjoy, but this was a comfort-food departure that will become a definite go-to!

Better than a restaurant!!! This soup was amazing!  My whole family raved about it.  I changed a few things....I did not have lemon grass so did not include it, however next time I will add it in.  I used a turkey/chicken/duck broth which was fabulous and added an 1/8 tsp of red pepper flakes. I had some Italian sausage and cooked that up and added it to the soup along with the called for shrimp (but I used prawns).  I also used soba noodles which really rounded out this dish.

I used one pound of chicken breasts instead of shrimp and increased the lime juice to 6 tablespoons.  I also used coconut sugar instead of light brown sugar and increased the amount to 4 teaspoons.  It was delicious!

Will def make again. However, I prob doubled the ginger and used equal ammt of the lemongrass tube (the kind that you get in the fresh section at the grocery store). I also added thinly sliced onion and orange bell pepper. Also,  I used 1/2 reg and 1/2 lite coconut milk. Rice noodles was a good addition.

Love it,!!  I have made it several times.  I doubled the shrimp and shitake mushrooms so I could have some in each spoonful.  Has become a staple in my diet.  I once tried adding octopus but the contrast, in chewing feel was too great.  I may try adding scallops or Dungeness crab in addition to the shrimp.

I got the lemongrass from a friend’s yard. I also could only find the paste in the grocery store. I did not find the red curry spicy at all. I will add more next time. This would be good with jalapeños too.

I made a lot of changes based on what I had in my fridge. I only used 1.5 cans of coconut milk, no fish sauce or lemongrass (my red curry paste had them in it). I used chicken in place of shrimp and added tomatoes and spinach just before serving, over rice vermicelli noodles. Delish!

I did coconut oil vs Vegetable and I did a ginger red curry chicken for the protein. In a frying pan I did coconut oil, 1 tsp of red pepper curry, and 1 tbsp of friend ginger (did that on accident when making the soup so tossed in with chicken, turned out great. The lime juice added the best zing at the end

This is a killer coconut curry Prawn dish! I use coconut cream instead of coconut milk to make it even richer and add some yellow curry powder to it.  As well as a dash of Sriracha sauce. I also added Chinese greens at the end with Bean sprouts! 

I love prawns and love curry and coconut! This is  ideal to serve with rice or quinoa. And works well with the Thai Beef Salad I made. Perfect match!!!

This is a great base recipe!  It’s so easy to tweak it to what you like in your soup. I made a few alterations to it and have made this twice now. The first time I only made a half recipe and it went so fast that the next time I made it I doubled it.

Excellent!  Very tasty!  Will definitely make it again but will either replace the shrimp with fish or just add fish to the mix so hubby can enjoy.  He cannot eat shrimp.  He did enjoy the flavors of the broth.

Great, authentic thai flavor, though very mild.  Recommend adding fresh thai or other chiles for more heat, the paste doesn't cut it.  Added some extra mushrooms, served with a side of rice.  Also, don't mince your lemon grass unless you make it very fine.  It's better to cut lemon grass in diagonal slivers that are big enough to eat around or you get small pieces of lemon grass in every bite.

Love this recipe!! I added another teaspoon or two of red curry paste as I found it tasted a bit too coconut-y, it helped give it a kick! I also added green onions when the mushrooms went in, I simmered the lemongrass stalks instead of mincing them, and added vermicelli rice noodles when the shrimp went in (but cooked them first seperately so they didn't soak up the broth).

This was super easy and yummy. I used chicken instead of shrimp only because chicken is nicer when reheated for leftovers. The curry paste we used wasn’t that spicy so we added Thai chilies to it with the mushrooms. Also, instead of grating the ginger we used chunks. This is a little more traditional so that you don’t have deal with eating the ginger. Also galangal could be used instead of ginger if you can get it. For the lemongrass we also just chopped into 3 inch segments and bruised them. Again this was for ease of eating.

I love his soup! I definitely recommend to cut the lemongrass into pieces big enough to avoid. It’s not fun to chew on. The flavours really come out the longer it simmers. I’ll make his over and over!

This is easily one of my all time favorite soups!! I love mushrooms and shrimp so I add 1lb of each. I just don't feel that what the recipe calls for would be filling enough as an entree otherwise. So delicious!!

I made this soup as written except using palm sugar ( a more traditional sugar in Thai cuisine.)    There were sincere accolades from my foodie friends   Thai dishes are always a welcome change in flavor and ingredients. This soup was a show stopper and highlight of the meal.  Be adventurous make it.

This is the best soup!  I was unable to find fresh lemon grass but I did find dried lemon grass in the spice section.  You just re-hydrate it before using.

I made this last night.  It was awesome.  I didn't have the lemongrass so will definitely get that for next time which will probably take this to a 5 star.   I made with shrimp however today I'm putting leftover chicken (we ate all the shrimp) as we have enough for another meal with the broth.

Good,  but my soup was thin, lots of broth compared to the mushrooms and shrimp. I kept adding more red curry paste to bump up the heat. However, I didn’t add salt, although I love salt,  I felt this recipe didn’t need any extra added.

Tasty sweet recipe! I used 2.5 cans of coconut milk (still a bit too rich ) I'd use less next time and had to triple up on the chilli paste. I've never used lemongrass before and didn't know you had to peel the hard layers off - as a result there are crunchy bits in my soup. Next time will be better !

Way too much cocunut milk in the recipe so I followed some other reviewers advice and cut it down to just one can.  It was great and filling.  I also used button mushrooms to be more budget friendly.  Next time I think I'll add some spinach to wilt in there.  
A winner!

This was very easy to make.  The only thing I changed was that I used Stevia instead of brown sugar.  My husband said it was so good I could charge money for it.  I've made several curry soups before but this definitely was the most flavorful.  Next time I would add some chili sauce for a little more spice.

This is really good.  I used chopped lemon grass from a plastic jar as that is what I could find locally .... I used 3 tablespoons.  The little tiny pieces are not very nice, but were too small to catch in a sieve so next time I will buy paste online.  I used 1 tablespoon of red curry paste  and it was what I would call nicely mild-ly hot that I think most people would be okay with.  I only used 2 cans of coconut milk because that was all I had.  I only added 1 tablespoon of lime because it can be over powering and I didn't want it to be the star of the show, and 1 teaspoon of salt.  At the end I added green onion and a little Thai chili minced.

This is bomb, so good everytime. This is the second time I have made it. I halved the recipe, this works well and makes a perfect portion for 3 people. I made it by the recipe up until you simmer for 15 mins....during this time I sautéed yellow onion, and mushrooms (I just used crimini) for about 5 minutes, then added chopped green beans and bell pepper and sautéed for another 10mins....added the coconut milk and KING CRAB (so good! But you could use any seafood...simmered until warm then added the sautéed veggies.

Great as is and the whole family loves it. I switch it up by adding rice or rice noddles at times. We also sometimes switch the shrimp for chicken. Tonight we topped with chopped peanuts which half the family liked. Lots of possibilities. I do prefer to slice the lemon grass and then remove it before eating.

Really good basic method to follow. 
However, only one can of coconut milk is really needed, if not less, add in 2 more teaspoons of red curry paste, another tablespoon of sugar, a splash more fish sauce and try it with a mixture of scallops, prawns and squid.Even frozen packs work very well.  Also cooking with sesame oil, rather than vegetable, though not very authentic, adds a lovely flavour. 
oh, and lashes of lime juice.

This was great even though I had to make some substitutions based on availability.  Instead of red curry paste, which I couldn't find at 2 different stores, I used green curry paste.  Also, my store didn't have shitake mushrooms so I used portabello which are good, but chewier.  I couldn't find lemongrass and didn't know I could used the paste.  Instead I used lemon zest and then since I had a zested lemon, I used lemon juice instead of lime juice.  I also used cooked chicken instead of shrimp.  My husband loved it and I will definitely make again.

I can't get enough of this soup. I make a vat of it and eat it for every meal for a couple days. I add other veggies that I may have on hand - broccoli, snow peas, etc. Delicious and difficult to mess up.  Ginger makes it spicy. YUM!!

Awesome soup!  I read about 100 reviews and followed a lot of the advice, thank you to everyone who gave great tips.   Here's how I tinkered with the basic recipe:  used only hot sesame chili oil, about 3-4 T, to soften one diced sweet onion, one diced green pepper, about 4 cloves of crushed garlic, and 8 oz. fresh sliced mushrooms (cheap kind, which when sauteed in this oil have plenty of flavor); used 3 T lemon grass paste; 4 T of the red curry paste; only one can of Thai light coconut milk; 1 T Thai basil; 2 T rice vinegar; 1.5 lb. shrimp.  Added basmati rice, which has nice nutty flavor and cooked the rice in 1/2 water, 1/2 light coconut milk.  Rather than adding to soup mix, I squeezed lime juice into bottom of individual bowls, added whole, fresh cilantro leaves, & added rice; then poured on the soup.  Except for these changes, I followed the rest of the basic recipe.  This is a medium spicy version of the recipe.  Second time I made it I used brown basmati rice cooked only in water.  This rice has very different flavor than white basmati.  But tasted good in this soup recipe, and because it is heavier than white basmati, it stretches the meal.  One last tip about shrimp:  I bought raw shrimp, the biggest size I could afford, and steamed it, shell-on, then peeled.  A lot of work but extra flavor.

Delicious soup!. Although it takes some travel planning, I remain dedicated to shopping at authentic Asian markets at least four times a year to lay in a supply of essential items for my "go  to" recipes.  Since I use a lot of fresh ginger and lemon grass, I rely on having a frozen supply on hand.  When needed, I remove a frozen piece of ginger and/or lemon grass and use a microplane to create "snow" for my recipe --  about a tsp of each--then return the frozen piece to the freezer.

This soup was so delicious! I made a few changes. I used one less can of coconut milk, added sliced carrots, cauliflour, green beans and thai basil. I used about 2 tablespoons of the curry paste. Garnished with sliced fresno peppers and cilantro. Yum!

Amazing recipe. It’s pretty spot on as is. I add 3 tablespoons of Red Curry Paste because I like a little more kick. I also just add the entire stalk of lemon grass instead of chopping it up. I’ve found it tastes best with Goya coconut milk. Serve over fried or steamed white rice. It’ll change your life!

Great base recipe. I’ve made it several times with several variations. My husband favors it with chicken, but today I made it with any and all vegetables that I had. Delicious!

I made this soup and really liked this recipe, although I found that mincing the lemon grass was a bit to woody having the hard minced pieces in the soup.  I suggest just cutting and pounding  the lemon grass into large pieces and flavoring the soup that way. Thank you for the recipe and thank you Allrecipes!

We LOVE this recipe.  I use the red curry pace brand:  Thai Kitchen.   I have not had any trouble locating it in my local supermarket.  I also use the ginger and lemon grass that is in a tube located in the refrigerated vegetable section.   I use regular sliced white mushrooms, fresh green beans and carrots and then ladle over brown rice. When the green beans and carrots are crisp-tender, soup is done.   We add quite a lot of veggies, to make it a "one pot" dinner.  My husband refers to it as one of my specialties -- it is YUMMY and easy to make.  Will feed a crowd--is great with chicken or shrimp or a combo of both!!!

I made this. I though adjusted it a bit. Since I had to use chicken broth, I cooked chicken, which I used in the soup, The lemongrass... even though it says chop and cook, it's impossible to have it in the soup as it's not chew-able, so I cooked  and then removed , placed it in the cheese cloth and had it in the soup while cooking, I also had hot pepper added too.

Was very simple to make. Noticed that broth would over take mushrooms and shrimp so I double mushroom and added 1/2 more shrimp according to 8 servings. I also made 1 serving of rice as a base to add Thai Coconut Soup. Great taste and rich broth.

Full disclosure: I am NOT a great cook. I look for easy, delicious recipes to make. This was incredible! I messed up and put in 2 tbsp rather than 2 tsp of the red curry paste, so I had to double a bunch of the ingredients. I doubled the chicken broth and brown sugar, as well as the lemongrass, which I cut into 1/2 inch pieces. I used 1.5 pounds of chicken sliced thinly rather than shrimp, added a lot of broccoli, used 2 tbsp ginger (the dried spice rather than fresh), and only used 2 cans of full-fat coconut milk and 1 can of "Lite" coconut milk. I used 1/2 lb of fresh shiitake mushrooms, and I  also added some scallions because I had them in my fridge and they were going to go bad soon. This soup was AMAZING!!! I will definitely make it again!

Excellent recipe, every time I make it, the reception is amazing. I took the advice of many, I don't mince the lemongrass because it is easier to remove in the end. Otherwise I follow the recipe as it says, splendid taste overall. Highly recommended!

Wow this soup was amazing!!!  This was my first time cooking thai food and everything came out fabulous.  The soup was even better as leftover each day.  I used 1.5lb of shrimp but next time I will add in more mushrooms.  Just depends if you like more substance to your soup, but all in a fabulous soup that I will surely make again and again!

Made this tonight for dinner and it was fantastic. I think I'm in love! I used dry shitakes and threw in the leftover soaking water for extra flavor. Someone said they thought three cans of coconut milk was too much, and I think two was perfect, with no need for extra salt. I thickened it with a little cornstarch, just cuz. Served it over brown rice. Hubby was hesitant but after sampling he loves it (though not as much as I). SOOO YUMMY!! Tip: To shorten prep time I'm  going to pre-mince and measure the ginger, lemongrass, and curry paste and store a few in the freezer in tiny plasticware.

i have nothing to reference this to. but i followed the instructions as provided except for 1. i didnt add any lemon grass, 2. i used a extra tsp of red curry powder. This came out WONDERFUL, except the texture of my shitake mushrooms was not that appealing, ill need to find thing to do with them to fix that issue. also, simply cooking the shrimp in the broth alone leaves you with just pink shrimp sooo you may want to grill a prawn and place at the top for presentation . as far as flavor tho... this is amazing. i kept wanting to add more things to do (a crunch texture) but i need to remind myself this is a second course at best... and with that in mind. it was almost perfect. i will be tweaking this and adding this to my stable of recipes

I made this soup and used green curry paste instead of red (that's what I had on hand) added only one can of coconut milk, used veggie stock instead of chicken and added snow peas, red bell peppers and it was delicious.  I would not mince the lemongrass but cut them in larger pieces so you can pick them out. as they are harder to chew/eat. I topped it with lots of cilantro. It was easy and my family enjoyed it. I will definitely make this again.

It was a bit bland. I agree with the other poster who said you don’t really need 3 cans of coconut milk. 1 or 2 will do it, and I love coconut. I used lemongrass paste because lemongrass wasn’t available at Publix. I probably wi7not make again.  Also I used Thai Kitchen brand red curry paste and it wasn’t spicy at all. It could have used more of a kick. This recipe has potential, I’m just not sure how to tweak it.

I loved it.  I made some changes. I was raised on Asian food and I like spice.  I added an extra tablespoon of Fish Sauce and an extra teaspoon of the red curry paste.  I also added the juice of 1 1/2 limes (freshly squeezed) towards the end. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I also used half shiitake mushrooms and half baby bellas (thinly sliced).  It was perfect for my family.  The next time that I serve this, I will cook the shrimp separately and put it in the bowls right before serving.  When the shrimp sits in the hot soup it keeps cooking.

Really good! I didn't have lemongrass so substituted with lemon zest and a little extra ginger. I also used more red curry paste than the recipe called for because I couldn't taste it well. Great flavor overall and pretty simple.

This is wonderful.  I made it according to the recipe other than adding 4 small diced red Thai chillies for heat, and doubling the red curry paste out of habit.  Served with Jasmine rice, this is restaurant quality.

Excellent recipe! Tastes very authentic. I made a couple of small adjustments. I used 2 cans of coconut milk (lite) and used a zest grater to prepare lemon grass.  Included shrimp, scallops and crab meat and served with Thai noodles. It was A big hit with the family. I'd rate it 5/5. DELICIOUS!

So tasty! I did make some substitutes. I couldn't find lemongrass at my local market and instead used lemon zest. I also used soy sauce instead of fish sauce. It was still delicious and easy to make.

I couldn't find lemongrass anywhere locally, so I shaved 4 long strips of lemon peel off a lemon without the white pithe and tossed them in and let them simmer in it for awhile and then removed them. I also added some pod peas from my garden and a can of mini corn. It was the non dairy comfort soup I've been hungering for! It is packed with flavor!

It was yummy but I ended adding more mushrooms, a red pepper and green pepper and a lot more red furry paste and a dash of cayenne to spice it up! Delicious!

for my first time, yeah! otherwise, wasn't as good as i hoped for.  the question is did the coconut milk out of the frig case and veggie broth instead of chicken broth make a difference?  Is canned coconut milk an absolute must? i opted for the veggie broth because it has less sodium.  ok gang, let me know.  thanks.

This was delicious!    I added extra spice to the leftovers & it was even better the next day.   I only used 2 cans of coconut milk & straw mushrooms.   I will definitely make this again!  Thank you for the recipe!

I adjusted the recipe to include chicken instead of shrimp, and used only 1 can of coconut milk plus 3 tsp of red curry paste. My Thai husband is loving it served with basmati rice.

I changed it up just a bit because I didn't have some of the ingredients and sometimes I like to see what I can add to my dish from other recipes but next time I'm making it the way is recommended. I used cod instead of shrimp and added few very thinly sliced potatoes. Added Star Anise too. My kids ate everything too.  I added a spoon of white rice in the bowl before I poured the soup over.

Good recipe, only thing I would recommend is less coconut milk (I usually love coconut milk but I find it too much in this recipe, possibly one can would be enough).

Added some yellow squash and zucchini slices to the soup and served it over white rice. Couldn't find any lemon grass so we omitted it.  The whole family loved it. Will definitely make again.

I would've given this recipe 5 stars but there is some tweaking that needs to be done. I'm no seasoned cooker  - so for all the non-cookers out there, this rating (or warning) is for you. 
1) Unless you like little chunks of ginger inside your soup, please remove them before adding liquids or your gonna have to strain them later. 
2) The cilantro adds flavor, but, I wasn't a fan of the texture. (Imagine leaves sticking to your tongue and teeth).  1/4 of cilantro is waaaay too much! 
Other than that, I loved the soup. I used some regular mushrooms, and it was delish. I will have to strain my whole soup  - to keep from scraping the whole dish.

This is absolutely delicious. I changed the chicken broth with some of my homemade veggie broth, added a bunch more lime juice and a little bit of chili oil. It was amazing.

Thanks so much for the great recipe.

This soup is seriously delicious. I added more lime juice than called for- approximately the juice of 2 small limes. Also sprinkled red pepper flakes on the finished product for extra spice (I like some heat, and didn't feel the soup was spicy enough as written). Served it over brown rice.  If you are craving the coconut soup you'd get in a Thai restaurant, this will satisfy! Will definitely make this again!

A really yummy soup!! I did add an additional teaspoon fish sauce and only 2 cans of coconut milk. My son doesn't like coconut and 3 cans would have been too sweet. I also added two cups more chicken broth. Enjoy!!

I made this but I didnt have the Lemongrass as I couldn't find it anywhere....UGH. I substituted Lemon Zest. I also used chicken as that is what I had on hand. I hated paying $10 a bowl at the local Thai Restaurant....I think this is very close, but I would like the flavor to be a bit stronger, I am just not sure what to increase. Any suggestions are welcome. I didn't give it a 5 star because I did expect the flavor to be a bit stronger. Totally making this again and again.

This was really good. Since it was only the two of us we cut the recipe to 1/3. We did it with one chicken breast, and added   6 large shrimp. It was plenty  for the two of us.

We found frozen grated lemongrass (had to ask for it) which sped up the prep.

Now we know we can serve it to guests.

I made this for a dinner  party for twelve people.  Absolutely everyone loved it.  Several asked for the recipe and made it at home.  This was so easy and fast to make but it tasted like it was made by a 5 star chef at a fine restaurant.

My family loves this soup.  My teenagers even request it sometimes.  This is as good as the soup from my local Thai place. I only use two cans of coconut milk. I also double the curry paste because I like the stronger flavor.  I am not able to get lemongrass at my local grocery store so i use the paste and I add it generously. My family likes lime so I am very generous with the lime also.  A staple in my home.

I used green curry paste instead and didn't add mushrooms. Instead I added sliced Ba Choy and shredded spaghetti squash. It's the shrimp and coconut milk that makes this dish.

I couldnt for the life of me find Lemon Grass, so I swapped it for some lemon zest (1 lemon) and it did the trick. I minced  2 serrano peppers (without seeds) for spice and chopped up half an onion 1-2" pieces into the mix as well.  I think in the future I'd just do 5oz of shitake mushrooms instead of 1/2lb which seemed slightly excessive.  I love mushrooms though so its not a serious complaint.   Overall 5/5, just as good as I remember in Thailand.

Very tasty! I substituted Hearts of Palm for the mushrooms and added bokchoy for more to chew. I also, sprinkled unsweetened coconut on top which also added to the texture and taste of this great soup.

Very good and will def make again.  My only alteration was to double the curry paste from 2 to 4 tsps, because our family likes it spicy.  I like how quickly this cooks, with a bowl of steamed rice and a salad this is a healthy and easy dinner.

The soup was fantastic!  It tastes as good as you could get in the restaurant.  

I made this recipe almost exactly as the recipe states except that I added canned bamboo shoots (shredded), canned baby corn, and some fresh bean sprouts in the bowl.  I just wanted to add a little more bulk to the dish and thought that these Asian ingredients would do the trick.

this soup turned out way better than I thought it would. the only thing I did different was I used leftover rotisserie chicken instead of shrimp (didn't have any shrimp). next time I will half the amount of fish sauce though, it's a bit stronger on that flavor than I like

Made it as stated and it tasted delicious but needs much more fresh lime juice (I used Santa Cruz in a jar).   It doesn't look pretty though bc I used Goya coconut milk,  which indeed does separate as another reviewer said.  Also, reduced coconut to only one can.  It is a rich taste.

As a garnish when serving a bowl,  add sliced red bell pepper,  cilantro leaves,  slices green onion, sliced jalapeño rounds without the seeds, lime wedges.

This soup is soooo flexible!  I read up on all the comments and combined lots of the ideas.  Used tofu instead of shrimp (sautéed first), didn't use lemon grass because I didn't have it, used only one can of lite coconut milk + about 6 cups veggie broth, added a zucchini and a few carrots, and sliced the ginger instead of grating - and removed after it boiled in the broth for about 15 min.  It was so yummy!!!.

The taste was fantastic, but I would skip the lemongrass next time.  Every spoonful, I was spitting out chunks of lemongrass.  Ugh.
Update:  Changed to 5 stars after realizing I can just put the lemongrass in a tea bag or something and discard it afterward.  Duh.  :)

Delicious! I left out the lemongrass because I couldn't find any, but I bet it would be even better with it. I also only used 2 cans of coconut milk. I felt like 3 would be too much liquid.

Delicious!!!! I had to double all the ingredients, except for the oil, coconut milk and broth. I wanted a more robust flavor and I got it.  I wish it was spicer, and doubling the paste didn't work.  I served it over Jasmine rice.  It was so goooood!

Lovely recipe, very well  balanced flavours.  Just for a change once I tried to add shrimps and shitake mushroom at the very end, but previously sautee it in a pan with few drops of sesame oil, smoked garlic and a bit of ginger, but following the original recipe is always a win ??

We loved it! Made as written, but couldn't find lemongrass so substituted with the paste. Wasn't sure how much to use so I went by another reviewer who used one tsp. Also added bok Choy and served over rice noodles. Next time I would increase the curry paste for more spice and use larger shrimp and maybe baby scallops.  Would definitely make again

This is my favorite soup recipe of all time! Perfect blend of fish sauce, coconut milk and curry paste. The only change I made is, since the lemon grass is so tough I put it in a mixer and made it super fine texture so this way it will blend into the soup even better. I also made 4 servings and only used 1 coconut milk since coconut flavor is overpowering sometimes. It came out perfectly. Thanks so much for that awesome recipe!

Came out great!!  Added chicken instead of shrimp, used about 3 tablespoons of the (a taste of thai) curry paste and only 2 cans of coconut milk, and added a LOT of veggies (baby corn, spinach, snow peas, enoki), and a little bit of minced garlic (1 clove).  Surprising how much the lime really brings out the soup's flavor.

I doubled the recipe, used unsalted chicken stock ( 2 cartons), used only 1 can regular coconut milk and 1 can of light coconut milk, added 2,large garlic cloves minced, and used Argentina shrimp. I also added more curry paste than called for and served with Siracha, cilantro and lots of lime. I will make this often! Thank you Jessica for this wonderful recipe!

I liked this very much, and so did my husband. I would add more red curry paste for a little more heat; I didn't taste it using the amount called for in the recipe. Also, I never leave lemongrass in food to be eaten. I pound the stalk, cut it into short enough lengths to fit the pot and then remove it before serving. It seems too fibrous to eat otherwise.

Great flavor - served over some brown jasmine rice. My husband loved it too!!  I might add some extra veggies next time - like red pepper, onion or baby corn.  It tastes light and fresh. I had never bought lemongrass before. Found it at our local Asian market and watched a youtube video on how to use it. Found everything else at the regular grocery store. The shiitake mushrooms are awesome - never bought them before- don't substitute other mushrooms!!  Oh, and I only used 2 cans of coconut milk, one lite and one regular.  Seemed to be plenty of liquid with all the chicken broth  as well.

Amazing flavors. This is one of my favorite soups. can't go wrong with ginger and coconut milk. I made the soup base for future use as well. I could used a lot more heat possibly a dash of Cheyenne
    Today I made the soup over spaghetti squash and of course a splash of Sriracha. Next add ins: baked chicken and brown rice noodles in my attempt at healthier options.

Pretty good soup!  I would do 1 less can of coconut soup,added kale to make it a little thicker, also switched out for enoki mushrooms,  and added double curry paste and double lime juice.

This was great! Changed a little (didn't have lemongrass unfortunately) made a smaller amount so I only used one can coconut milk to 4 cups broth, which tasted perfect to us,  felt it needed more curry paste (about 1 TBSP) and less fish sauce (1 -2 TBSP) I added celery, broccoli, garlic paste, spinach, additional lime juice.

This is fabulous.  I didn't have fish sauce or a lime and it still is probably the best soup I ever had.  Thanks for  this sharing recipe and thanks to all the reviewers who left comments.

I really enjoyed this.  After reading the reviews, I cut back on the coconut milk so only used one-third of recommended. I think that was a good broth to milk ratio. Next time, I'll use larger pieces of lemongrass since wasn't a fan of the small crunchy bits. It's also really tasty with udon noodles added.

the soup was excellent.  I added rice noodles to make it more filling and wish that I hadn't done that.  The soup would have been find on it's own.  I also added a clove of garlic because I can't cook anything without garlic.  Would definitely add that again next time.  I also think that I'd add only two cans of coconut milk and not chop the lemongrass, just put it in whole.  lemongrass is very chewy and fibrous.

Yum...I love the depth of flavor in this soup! I substituted tofu for shrimp and it tasted fine. I found that just 2 cans of coconut milk made it creamy enough.

I have been trying to perfect my Thai coconut soup recipe because I love it. I have probably tried 7 different recipes and this is the best recipe by far! I did make a few alterations but it would probably be great on its own - and it depends on your taste. 
Alterations I made: 
• Chicken Thighs cut up into pieces instead of shrimp (but now I'm going to try it with shrimp too) & 3 large dried galanga pieces - put in when you add chicken stock
• Add 2-3 tablespoons of brown sugar
• Add half of a sweet onion
• Add can of diced tomatoes
• Could add 1-2 tablespoons of lime juice 
SOOOOO GOOD!

Very, very good! I used Lemongrass paste instead of a stalk, about 3 Tbsp. as another member had mentioned. Also, I doubled the red curry paste. Used coconut milk from the dollar store since it can be spendy. Soup seemed a bit thinner than I prefer but I just mixed 1 Tbsp cornstarch with a small amount of hot water then added to the soup and cooked for about 4-5 more minutes. Thickened perfectly for my taste. Added some chopped orange bell peppers and used regular crimini mushrooms. Turned out beautifully. Am definitely saving this one!

It's ok. If you're looking for a more Thai restaurant taste, I would skip on chicken broth and just stick with coconut milk. The broth made it too salty and not as authentic

In the middle of "storm ageddon" I decided this would be a perfect recipe to make. Unfortunately a few ingredients were not available to me. This recipe is not only delicious but forgiving! Substitute green curry paste for red, no problem. Throw in some bok choy if you want to up the nutrition level. Don't substitute the coconut milk or fish sauce though!

I didn't care for the oregano in the recipe.  I thought the flavour was too strong for a coconut soup.  Next time I make it I will use some Thai basil instead and just regular white mushroroms so they're not so rubbery.  Some vegetables (snow peas, grated carrot, bean sprouts, even deep fried tofu), to give this watery soup some substance.

This was delicious!  Everyone in my family loved it. The only change I made was the addition of baby bok choy to the soup and may add diced potatoes next time or other extra vegetables.  So easy too.  Highly recommend.

Oh. My.  Loved this! Great flavors that really come together well.  I sliced the lemon grass into 2" pieces because I don't like them diced; they're too fibrous for my taste.  I didn't serve this over rice but that would be really tasty. I did add some sliced red bell pepper which complemented the flavors nicely. As other reviewers have suggested, other veggies would also go well in this.  Hubby loved this too, we are Thai food lovers and this was very authentic.  I didn't make a full batch because I didn't have quite enough ingredients. Next time I will make sure I do! :)  Thanks for sharing Jessica!

I've been looking for a Thai soup recipe that holds the same quality and texture as the coconut soup at my favorite Thai restaurant. I have finally found it! Other than adding a little more curry, I didn't change a thing. This soup deserves all the praise! I will be making this again and again!! Fantastic!

This is just a sensational blend of flavors!   I'm not a big curry person, but this is my first time using red curry paste and I didn't find it overpowering at all.    I followed the recipe to a T.  Simply amazing.   The 2 T of ginger seemed a little scary, but no, not at all.  Perfect flavor overall.   I ladled my soup over a bowl of quinoa, because it just happened I had a bowl of leftover quinoa already cooked and ready to use.   It was good, but I think basmati rice (as recommended) would be better and make it heartier.    And because I just love shrimp, I would add a lot more next time.   Thanks for this excellent recipe!!!

Made this according to the recipe with no changes.  Very good flavors but way too much coconut milk.  I would limit to 
(1.5-2)13.5 oz. of the coconut milk or other ingredients just overwhelmed by the amount of broth.

Very close to restaurant style I love.  My 5 year old loves it and took it in her school lunch thermos (she is picky).  This soup inspired her to try more items at our local Thai restaurant.  It is her "favorite yummy" soup.

So yummy! I added a little extra lime and red chili for heat, but those are personal preferences. It was fantastic before I added those ingredients. I'll be making this again and again!

Used mint and lemon zest instead of lemongrass, left out fish sauce and cilantro and mushrooms and put in some chicken and rice noodles at the end.  Turned out great, very versatile base.

This is to die for.  It is equally as good as the fine Thai dining establishment I frequent.  I boil the ginger and lemongrass in a little broth first (for about 30 minutes) to infuse the flavors and then remove them, since lemongrass especially can be very tough. Good with tofu, chicken or anything else you would like to add.

This was phenomenal. I made minor changes but without a doubt the base recipe is 5 stars as is. I wanted to give it authentic Tom Ka Gai flavors so I used Galanga instead of ginger. Used double parrot brand fish sauce but was looking for Tiparos. Doubled recipe to freeze some and give some away and was very glad I did even though it was a lot. I added almost the whole jar of curry paste as it needed more heat. Aside from needing more curry paste, it was the perfect balance of Spicy-Sour-Salty-Sweet. Starting with Salty-add more fish sauce if more flavor is desired. If too Sour-add more sugar. If too Spicy, or if more creaminess is desired-add more coconut milk. If not Spicy enough-add more curry paste. DEF will Make this AGAIN. I braised chicken thighs rubbed in sofrito then finished slow cooking them in the soup-very very good. I let the soup simmer for a while just because I had the time. I used bone broth because I had it on hand. This was very filling (2 bowls). Oh! I wanted to add veggies so purreed ALOT of steamed broccoli along with sautéed red pepper with some coconut milk and added to soup and you could not see it or taste it at all. If I would not have added it all myself I would not have believed how much it was or even that it was there. Which is a win because both my kids loved it. I even tried adding some sautéed spinach to a bowl just now and that was good too. NOTE TO SELF FOR NEXT TIME: after smashing lemongrass, cut into 2 inch pieces so they can be easily r

Second time making this and this time it was perfect!  Few changes: 1) used olive oil instead of vegetable oil 2) used 1 tablespoon of red curry paste to give it more kick 3) used chicken breast instead of shrimp.

Honestly this would have been 5 stars if it had more vegetables and heat.  It was a great starting base for my variation. Here is what I added:  Tripled the amount of red curry, added cayenne pepper, and salt.  I also added bamboo shoots, baby corn, water chestnuts, and bell pepper with the mushrooms (I used fresh mushrooms instead of shiitake).  This recipe  is a keeper.

So, this soup is AH-MAZING! I made it for my family tonight and it was a huge hit! Aside from the rice, it's basically a one-pot wonder. I tweaked the recipe a bit and added a tablespoon of garlic. I also increased the amount of red chili paste and fish sauce to taste. It was not complicated to make and the directions were very easy to follow. Yum!

I've eaten in some pretty fabulous Thai restaurants, but this is probably the best Thai soup I've ever had. Fabulous recipe. I doubled it for our large clan and substituted Red Curry Sauce as I couldn't find paste. Also, I only had dried Lemon Grass. It was still getting applause on the third day of leftovers!

Great recipe. I added twice the amount of red curry paste and a few drops of Thai pepper oil (needed some more Thai heat). Next time I will use different mushrooms (shiitake in soup have a slimy texture to them), also I will butterfly the shrimp so they open up better and absorb some more of the flavor.

This was PHENOMENAL. Tastes just like the Thai soups from the restaurant! I added a dash of garlic powder and also added fresh basil leaves. Also, I used seafood stock instead of chicken broth. VERY GOOD.

I would give this 10 stars if I could. I altered the recipe slightly (2 cans coconut milk,coconut oil instead of veg oil, little more ginger, and I think I used chicken not veggie stock). Regardless,   Best soup I've ever had. Tastes blend perfectly (side note - don't use the dehydrated lemon grass stalks). I had this for dinner and breakfast and dinner and breakfast... you get the idea. :)  Don't hesitate to make this; it is so good.

This was AWESOME. If I was served this at a restaurant, I would spend the next week telling everyone to go there. The only change I made was to leave the lemongrass whole because we like the flavor but not the texture. Bonus to that, shorter prep time.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did tweak it a little bit. I added two pouches of 14 ounce coconut milk, which was plenty.  I also added some peanut sauce to taste, which made it even better.

This soup is really good, but I will make a few tweeks the next time.  I noticed other people talked about the ginger and lemongrass being pick out.  I used a microplane grater for both.   I also put pad thai noodles in it, and made it a soup.   Next time, I would try only adding one can of coconut milk, and maybe add more red curry paste.  We like things a little spicy.  YUM!

Loved it! Per other reviewers we added bamboo shoots. I prefer my coconut soup on the sweet side, so we probably quadrupled the sugar. We also added about 4 t chicken bouillon (or enough to make 4 cups broth, depends on the brand.)
I was nervous about how this was going to turn out. No reason! Absolutely delicious. Even my 10, 11, and 14 year old boys ate it right up.

It was VERY good, but... not as good as the FL Thai's restaurant.  Only put in 2 cans coconut milk(1 light and 1 regular).  Added the zest from 1 lime and the juice from 2 smaller limes.  Stirred 1/4 C. ch. cilantro into soup at end.  Made 4 C. chicken broth using only 2 bouillion cubes.  Didn't buy any lemongrass, but did put in maybe 1 tsp. dry lemongrass. Made brown rice, but it in the bowl first and then spooned soup over it.

Recommend that you cut the lemongrass and ginger big enough to remove when the soup is done. I did it in small pieces like the recipe said so and almost every spoonful of soup I would get hard and odd flavor lemongrass and ginger on my dish ??...

Delicious recipe, a little too spicy for my parents but I'd rate it mild by my standards with the red curry paste! I would strongly recommend making this recipe it's absolutely wonderful! (It can also be put into a slow cooker which I did for many hours)

Made exact to recipe with omitting the mushrooms because I don't like them and half the coconut milk (it just seemed like too much). Very tasty with the exception of too much fish sauce/salt. I'll reduce to half next time. I cut the lemongrass and ginger large enough that it was easy to fish out. I made a double batch and froze the broth (no coconut milk/veg/meat) and I'm looking forward to an even quicker soup next time. Spice was a little mild straight from the pot but perfect the next day.

Used 3x as much curry paste *I used Thai kitchen and it was bland :( 
1 Tablespoon extra fish sauce

I added an extra teaspoon of curry paste and a whole habenero pepper while simmering. Turned out superb.

Family favorite and I have picky eaters!  I couldn't find lemongrass so I used lemon grass paste. Will look for it at a local Asian store as I would have like to have the texture. Reduced coconut milk by one can. Family review was that it needed another pound of shrimp. I served it over a spoonful or two of jasmine rice. Will definitely make again!

This was a huge hit. I made two batches. I used three different types of mushrooms and firm tofu as well. Added red chilies for some extra heat, too. I like this recipe because you can adapt it to your own preference and it's hard to mess up. Served over basmati rice. Delicious.

Fried baby bella mushrooms before and added to the soup instead of the pricey shiitake. Also added more of the red curry paste. Finished it off with red pepper flakes for a little more heat.

This recipe is awesome and so easy.  I only made minor tweaks for my own tastes.  Based on other reviews, I only used 2 cans of coconut milk.   I also added two Thai chilies that were sliced lengthwise because I do like things spicy and 2 Tbsp of Mae Ploy brand red curry.  I just squeezed a whole lime worth of juice into it at the end.  I have Thai basil in my garden and added that when serving along with sliced green onions and cilantro.  I served it over rice noodles and it sooo good!  I made the first batch with chicken and just made second batch in the same week - it's that good! - and used tofu this time.  YUM!!! Thanks for posting and sharing your recipe!

I struggle with getting outside my comfort zone with cooking....but we had a shrimp curry soup last week that was amazing..therefore I looked at all the reviews and decided to go for it. It was fabulous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I followed  the directions exactly,  except only had half the ginger in the pantry. I did add more veggies by slicing carrots thinly, scallions and green onions. I also added egg noodles right at the end. This made a hearty meal! Next time I will spice it up more with the curry paste and red pepper flakes!! This is a keeper!

Great soup. I served it on its own , not over rice..it was awesome. I agree with some of the other reviewers that it benefited from more lime juice. Overflowing with wonderful flavors and not dominated by any of them. I will definitely make this again!

My kids say they love this soup. I used about 1/3 of the coconut milk, water and a veggie stock cube and dried mushrooms instead of fresh. Next time I'd like to try adding more substance to it with rice or noodles or something.

This is just as good as, or better than some coconut shrimp soups I've had in Thai restaurants. Easy to make and very flavorful. This will be my go-to when I'm craving Thai. I added a little chili oil for more heat, the juice of two lines since I like it a little more tangy, chopped scallions and cilantro for garnish. Wonderful!

This was sooooo good! Just like the restaurant version. The only thing I did differently was use green curry paste instead of red since that's what I had. Also added half of a diced red bell pepper since I wanted a veggie in it. I'll definitely be making this again.

Fantastic!  I made a few tweaks based on reviews and personal preferences and it was so delicious.  I omitted mushrooms and added sauteed red bell peppers, green beans, and chicken, and only used 2 cans of coconut milk (3 would have been way too much liquid and would have diluted the flavors too much).  I will make this recipe again and again!!

I love this soup. Almost exactly like Chef John's with chicken. I chop/slice red onions, jalepenos, basil, limes, cilantro and green onions for garnish. Sometimes I make rice for the side. Most Thai soup I have had are far too sweet for my taste this one is just right. OH! I double thre mushrooms.

Was tasty on the first day, but was super delicious the second day. I  purchased lemongrass paste, but will try using the real thing next time.  I had to use almost half the tube.

This was so good and easy to make. I made recipe exactly as written, just let the soup simmer for hour before adding shrimp. This is the closet taste to my favorite tom kha soup!!! Definitely going to make again with other proteins like chicken, scallops. Thank you for posting this recipe. Simple
& amazing

Great recipe, but don't make the mistake of using light coconut milk! It's just not the same. Also used chicken instead of shrimp that I sautéed with some curry paste prior to making the soup then adding it later. Recommend not chopping up the lemongrass if you don't like a green onion sort of texture. My husband picked them out, hee hee. But this recipe tasted delicious! Thanks!

So good! I doubled the curry paste and added a couple diced chili peppers... I like it spicy :) Used a 33 oz carton of coconut milk so a bit less than called for. Also used low sodium broth. Served with sticky rice...YUM

This was a pretty good recipe!  Although I tripled the lime juice I added into this.  It could be because I didn’t' use fresh lime, I had the readymade lime.  Also, one can of coconut milk was more than enough.  But I added more broth.  Four cups of chicken broth leaves you with barely any soup.  I would totally cook this again.

This recipe is way easy and super tasty! I'm never ordering this soup at a thai restaurant again! I tweaked mine a little bit. I live in the boonies so regular white mushrooms is all I had. I also added a can of Asian mushrooms and baby corn. At first I followed the recipe to a T but found it to be a bit bland. I also like it a little spicy so I added another tablespoon of curry paste and another tablespoon, maybe 2 of fish sauce. I did not use salt at all since the fish sauce took care of that for me. This is a great recipe. You can pretty much use this broth and throw in anything you like (i.e. Chicken instead of shrimp). Thanks for sharing!! This is a keeper :)

Used 1 can light coconut and 1/2 can full fat - could go with all light next time. Used lemon grass paste (could have used a little extra). Shrimp were raw and deveined, easy enough to peel. Prep while it's simmering - was done in about 40 mins. Could try chicken - add early so it soaks up flavor. Served over rice. Yum!

My children and I really  did like this.  My husband, not so much.  Now, if I'd followed the recipe and really used *shrimp*, he might have.  But I used fish.  He hates fish.....  Personally, I'd add more red curry paste, more lime and sugar - and some garlic.  MODS THIS LAST TIME?  We only added one can of coconut milk (it's all we had). We used.... lemon grass powder!? It smells really nice.... who knew.  But fresh is better. We also  added two onions.  My daughter made it, and she didn't cook the onion quite through.  Remembering some more northern U.S. styled soups with half cooked onions in them, I was dubious, but in this soup, it was very nice.  The onions were sort of crisp-tender, and very sweet.  A nice offset to the soup as it is written.  Will toy with this over time.  A nice, quick, easy meal!  Thanks, Jessica!

This is delicious! I couldn't find lemongrass or lemongrass paste so I used a few drops of lemongrass oil. Works just as well. I will be making this again!

Excellent soup! I served it over basmati rice.  I used half a tube of lemongrass paste  and half a tube of ginger paste (my store didn't have the fresh version of either one....however, this worked well and was EASY, so I will use the pastes again next time). I would use more red curry paste next time to give it a "kick" - you couldn't really taste it in here. I also doubled the amount of lime juice.  My hubby isn't a fan of coconut anything, but he raved about this soup!

great basic recipe. I found it called for way too much coconut milk and used only one can. I adjusted spice and flavors to suit our tastes, we like things spicy.

I have made this several times, and it is always a big hit with my family. I prefer coconut oil, both for the flavor and to keep the dish healthier.  Also, I sub fresh basil for the cilantro.  For this type of cuisine, I feel it compliments the dish better.  I include it after the shrimp, allowing a few minutes to let it soften.  It adds just an extra something to the dish.

I will definitely make this soup again. Huge hit with all of my family. I followed the recipe for the most part, except I only used one can of coconut milk (lite) and used two large boxes of chicken broth. I also added 1/2 tablespoon of hot chili paste. I garnished with fresh cilantro and jalapeno slices.

Really liked it. I can't attest to whether it's authentic or not, but the flavors were great. I only made one change. I have a slight allergy to shrimp so I substituted with a large skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into thin strips. It was delicious. Will definitely make this one again!

Very good! Easy to make. I put in clams with the shrimp and added only 2 cans of coconut milk. I added 1 more cup of broth and 1/2 more of ginger. We like ginger. Will make again!

Husband and I enjoyed it.  Kids didn't.
Next time I'll leave my lemongrass sliced much bigger so I can pick them out easier and I'll add rice noddles.

We make this soup at least once a week and it makes enough for dinner for two, then lunch, and then some.  As the submitter states, you will probably need more curry paste if you purchase it at the grocery store. I use what would be equal to half a hand full to make it spicy and flavorful. I haven't used lemongrass but I use ginger paste at the beginning. It's easy to store and use, plus I only like a little ginger in mine.  I use chicken instead of shrimp and add sliced baby bellas and bamboo shoots. I add LOTS of fresh cilantro at the end. Delicious and easy to modify to taste!

Made this for my husband and teenage kids, everyone really enjoyed it! Poured it over "sticky rice"  very good!! Added a little more red curry paste( as stated by submitting chef, some curry paste spicier than others , actually could have put in even more?!) I also used paste of ginger, cilantro and lemongrass, even more lemongrass would have been tastier as well. Definitely going to make it again!!!

Amazing!  Loved this soup!  I made it exactly as the recipe said. It did have a lot of coconut milk which is fine. I used light coconut milk and regular. I was able to get lemon grass which made it perfect. I recommend this recipe completely.

Very good. Double the curry paste and add more fish sauce and lime for extra tang. Be sure to add cilantro since it makes a big difference.

Very good! Will definitely make again. It's better when it cooks/simmers longer though so the shrimp or chicken (whatever you use) has time to absorb some of the flavor of the broth. The broth is amazing and to manage calories I used light coconut milk and it came out awesome. I like my food spicy so garnished my bowl with some Sirracha and that even made it better!

WOW. Seriously, wow! I'm a great soup maker if I say so myself, but this recipe was over the top delicious! Yes, curry pastes vary widely in spiciness so initially you should add the amount per recipe (a conservative baseline) & then more to your taste - I ended up using 1/2 a jar of rather un-spicy paste to get it where I wanted heat-wise. I too used fresh lemongrass paste (found in tubes in produce aisle) as my store didn't have stalks - worked great. The recipe makes tons, so after serving it to some very appreciative company my hubby & I were still able to have it for dinner the following night. Did I say yum? And wow? And thanks for the great recipe! ??

An easy and delicious soup that the whole family loved. I used  half of the coconut milk, added green onion, red pepper, and broccoli - would be great with other veggies also.  For heartier soup, pour over some rice.  Will definitely make this one again!

I really did love this soup. It's the first time I've ever attempted a Thai dish besides pad Thai. I used garlic infused chicken broth and also lemongrass paste and it was so tasty. Without salt it's pretty bland but once I added salt it was perfect!!!!!  I also used lite coconut milk..... To cut some calories.

No changes, absolutely delicious!! I'm not sure why some say the coconut milk is overpowering, they should try lite coconut milk if that is a problem for them. I have also made this with chicken instead of shrimp, it was delicious that way too. I also loved that I didn't have to use kaffir lime leaves or anything that my local grocery store doesn't carry--I will admit to buying the lemongrass when I see it, washing and cutting it in half, and freezing it for later though because the store doesn't always have it. I also leave the lemon grass in a stalk without chopping, it imparts its flavor but not its texture that way. YUMMY!! I make it often, serving over jasmine rice or accompanied with fresh spring rolls.

This was amazing!! My Vietnamese husband actually said "It's good" (this means something when the usual language is "I'm not eating that", or "it's ok"). There wasn't quite enough shrimp, so I boiled 1 lb of chicken and chopped it up to go with the leftover broth. I used twice as much fish sauce and next time will do twice the curry for a little extra spice. You do not need to use shiitake mushrooms-we were able to get by with the cheaper white mushroom. This deserves 5 stars. It does indeed compare to restaurant curry.

I gave this a 5 star rating even though I could not find lemongrass in my local store. It was very good and my whole family loved it but I have eaten several versions of this served by authentic chooks and the lack of lemongrass in mine made a real difference. It was still very good however a definitely worth making even if you can't find lemongrass in your area.

Very nice! Thank you for posting this. I ended up using like twice as much curry paste though but I also just really like curry flavor. Also, to take out the animal products, I used vegetable broth instead of chicken, replaced the shrimp with more mushrooms, and left out the fish sauce. I was worried that leaving out the fish sauce would be noticeable but I loved it and my father who eats meat loved it too.

Just made this - excellent!  Added about two cups cooked chicken, two heads of baby Bok choy, diced red pepper and rice noodles. I also left the lemon grass as long pieces and removed them once veggies were cooked. Keeper for sure!

This soup is very good and obviously You can adjust it to your tastes or add different vegetables (shredded carrots, red peppers, bean sprouts, whatever) The broth also stores well so you can freeze it in smaller batches then throw it in a pan and add shrimp and rice when you need a quick dinner.

I love this recipe! I tweaked it a little as I really wanted the pungent flavor like the Thai restaurants have.  This is what I changed... I switched to white mushrooms, only used 2 cans of coconut milk,  used 2 stocks of lemongrass and about 5 tablespoons of fish sauce. I added in chopped green onion too at the end. It's an easy and wonderful recipe!

Excellent blend of flavors, not at all spicy. My family raved about it and definitely want me to make it again. Because my daughter doesn't like the texture of mushrooms, I pureed a can of mushrooms in the blender and mixed it in instead of the shiitake mushrooms. I also added some carrots, green beans, and green onions to the broth, cooking the carrots for a few minutes before adding the green beans, then about 3 minutes later adding the shrimp and green onion for the last minute or so.

Really liked this soup and how easy it was to make it! I added more spices to it because I like mine full of spices. I served it over rice noodles but it was impossible to eat it without getting it splattered everywhere, I would recommend eating this over rice. This recipe is a keeper!

Great recipe.  I think I'll add more than 1 lb. of shrimp next time.  Pour this over a bed of rice and you've got an easy, gourmet, family-friendly comfort food.  My two-year old LOVED it and she's going through her super picky phase right now.  I used lemon paste instead of lemon stalk (2 T. paste = 1 stalk).

This soup is absolutely delicious!  But yeah, as someone else suggested, One (1) can of coconut milk is plenty.  I didn't make it with the 3 cans called for, so I can't comment on that, but it is plenty coconutty and delicious with just one. I also substituted cubed chicken breast for shrimp - I added the raw chicken along with the chicken stock before  the 15 min simmer.  I also used regular sliced fresh mushrooms.   My guests said it was the best Thai soup they'd ever tasted!

Excellent!  You can modify this recipe a lot to satisfy your tastebuds.  I used the lemongrass paste so it took me a while to get it to where I wanted it to be, maybe 2 tablespoons.  You may want to at least double the chili paste or you won't have any heat.  I highly recommend adding a dash of hot oil.  You will get those bright red droplets on the top that you often see in Thai dishes and it will add some heat.  Next time I am going to double the shrimp and add some spinach!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutely, I'll make this again! I haven't worked with a few of the ingredients, but this recipe was so simple once you have all your ingredients prepped! 
I made a few changes:
-For the lemon grass, I decided to chop it into 3 inch length pieces, and bash it with a rolling pin to let out the juices. 
-Instead of using shiitake mushroom, I substituted for a package of enoki. 
-I added a 3 large handfuls of bok choy after the mushrooms cooked for about 3 mins. 
Next time, I think I'll add some scrambled egg and let it cook a bit before I add in the mushroom and bok choy! :D

This  was super tasty!!!  Only complaint is the lemon grass being very fibery. I didnt have a way to mince it and i think that was my prob.  I will look for the paste next time or use a lemon as substitute.  But it is an amazing dish. Might add chicken next time.  I didnt add the exact amounts, addded more brown sugar, more fish sauce  more cilantro and paste.

If you like creamy tomatoe soup you will love this.  Not at all spicy but im ok with that.

Served this over some jasmin rice.

Wonderful.  i made a couple of changes, additions.  I added:
1 cup shredded fresh spinach with the mushrooms.  i cut the shrimp down & added  4 oz of fresh Alaskan Cod, in 1/2" slices with the shrimp - cooked about 4 minutes, i used green curry paste instead of red, 'cause i had it on hand - will try the red next time.

Was a huge hit with 2 out of 4 family members. Was a bit too "lemony" for half. Gave it 4 stars for the ease of preparation and the flavor profile. If you are a fan of Southeast Asian food, this recipe is perfect.

This recipe is outstanding, but I did make several adjustments. I used the broth from the tom yum soup that I made yesterday as the base, and boiled it down with fresh galangal, lime zest, strips (not grated) of ginger, and chopped up lemongrass; S&B brand oriental curry powder because it was the only curry powder that I had. Brown sugar was substituted for coconut sugar. Two cans of coconut milk were used opposed to three, because I normally only use one can for everything else and felt like three was just too much. I didn't have mushrooms or shrimp but I did substitute these for Chinese chives, chicken, and added Thai basil, mung bean sprouts, about a tablespoon of tamarind paste, and garnished with Thai basil, cilantro, ground Thai chilies, and a squeeze of lime. Served over a bed of Thai Jasmine rice and quinoa. If I could give this recipe six stars, I would!!

People are very impressed by this, considering how easy it was. I made it twice already in two weeks. Both times I used veg stock because I don't eat meat. I used a variety of mushrooms the second time which I think added interest (shiitake, cremini and enoki). I used 3 stocks of lemongrass in the second batch and bruised them first to help add flavour. I recommend doing this, it wasn't overpowering at all and I have seen other soup recipes that use 3 stalks of lemongrass. I also added crushed dried red pepper flakes for more heat.

I followed the recipe almost exactly. I did add more lime juice, cause I love limes.  I made this last night, and  just had it for breakfast.  It is amazing!  I was doubtful that I would find lemon grass but my Korean grocer had it.  So awesome.  I'm having it for lunch as well.  I will make again for sure.

Divine!  Rivals other Thai restaurant soups I've had.  I was liberal with the fish sauce, curry paste,  and lemon grass.  The blend of flavors was spot on.  Paired well with the rice, but wasn't necessary, as the shrimp and mushrooms added quite a bit of bulk.  So delicious and easy to make.  Lemongrass can be expensive at $10 at lb at health stores and I found the fish sauce at an Asian market.  But, comparatively, to what you would spend at a restaurant, I would say that making this soup is more cost effective at eight servings per recipe.  Definitely will make again.

It was great. Hubby would have liked the veggies in the broth to soften a little. 32 weeks Pregnant and I think it was the lemongrass that gave me extreme cramps afterwards.

A very good recipe. I made this and added lobster along with the shrimp. I steamed the lobster and added it to the finished soup very tasty thanks for this one.
Oh also added only 1 can of coconut milk.

The recipe is very tasty! I have made it twice. However, this should be made sparingly because coconut milk can have over 30 grams of fat per serving--and it's a main ingredient of this soup. Otherwise, use the juice of a whole lime. For extra spice, try more curry paste. The lemongrass is an integral part--and I added cilantro while the soup cooked to extract its essential oils and flavors.

I really liked this soup.  The only changes I made to it were some grated carrot, finely sliced sweet onion,  finely sliced red pepper and some crushed chili paste for a bit of heat.  The overall taste of this soup was very nice but for me needed some more heat.  Thanks for creating this recipe.

Wonderful! Makes a lot of broth so definitely nice to serve with rice and adding bok choy helps too. If you like cilantro don't do without because it is the bomb! I have extra broth so for an extra meal I'm going to try the chicken in there , add extra mushrooms and bok choy and make another meal out of it!

I used chicken breast and added some red bell pepper.  I felt that three cans of coconut milk was too much.  After eating some last night, i cut the remainder with some chicken stock.  Next time I will delete  one can of coconut and sub with chicken stock.

We really loved this dish. You just need to be sure you have all of the ingredients. I might add another teaspoon of red curry paste next time for a little more zip. And do make sure to really mince the lemongrass. Having really great fresh shiitake mushrooms was great but I think you could use dried and it would be good too. I served it over basmati rice. I will definitely make it again.

Great recipe! Thanks for the lemongrass paste tip! I made this but added green onions and fresh jalapeños for some spice. And with the coconut milk, I only used about 2/3 of what the original recipe calls for, and added more lime juice instead. Yummy!

Unbelievably easy and unbelievable delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It is perfect.  A light, bright combination of ginger and curry.  Sweet, lightly creamy coconut milk.  I feel like the lime is essential, so don't skip that part.

I doubled the recipe because I had two (2) pounds of shrimp, but it made more servings then I anticipated.  You won't need to worry about having enough to serve guests.  Love the one pot approach and the fact that the mushrooms and shrimp go in raw and cook in the liquids.  Fabulous slightly spicy soup!

We love this and make it frequently.  We are avoiding sugar and used stevia.  Tonight I used canned chicken because I was in a hurry.  It was still delicious.  We usually make it exactly as written with shrimp.  Just scrumptious.

The whole family enjoyed this recipe. Though I can't say I know what "authentic Thai" tastes like, it didn't matter much when it came to flavor...Just Amazing!

Some substitutions: I used Tamari in place of fish sauce because we never have fish sauce on hand (don't care for it.)

I used ground ginger spice instead of fresh ginger. I added a bunch of other veggies (snow peas and other mushrooms I had on hand) 

Finally, I used homemade stock (around twice as much as what the recipe called for actually) and it was just the right amount of coconut. My husband does not care for coconut and he loved it.

I subbed shrimp for chicken and tofu and added green onions and 1 jalapeno. Used button mushrooms instead of shiitake. This was amazing. It will definitely be a staple in the rotation of monthly recipes. Highly recommend.

I think this is pretty good, but I ended up adding much more curry paste and ginger than the recipe called for. I also used rotisserie chicken instead of shrimp. and I added bay leaves and another stalk of lemon grass while the soup simmered

I used chicken instead of shrimp and buttons instead of shitake. Also added the juice of three limes and a large yellow onion! Was terrific!

It was really good.  I used about 4 teaspoons of the red curry paste.  I also used low sodium chicken broth and lite coconut milk and it turned out amazing.

I've always really enjoyed this soup at Thai restaurants but NEVER dreamed of being able to make it.  There's nothing to it. Just follow the directions. I also watched the video, it helped but I could just as easily have accomplished it by reading the directions alone. 
Thai restaurants I've ordered from normally ask me how spicey I prefer my dishes (on a scale of 1-10), I normally answer a 7. That will usually get a bead of sweat running down my nose, but I enjoy it. My wife on the other hand, a spicey level of 1 achieves the same reaction. That said, if I were making this meal just for myself I would easily add another 1-3 tspns of the red curry paste. 
Often times I find Asian cuisines leaving me hungry again about 30 mins later. So I decided to add a 10oz. bag of Japanese Udon noodles, it "helped" maintain the cultural flare (at least they weren't italian), and made this more of a meal than an appetizer. I also went heavier on the shrimp (1lb.) and mushrooms. I made this for my family (wife, 4 yr. old, 2 yr old). Wife really enjoyed it but she also thought it could have used just a little more hot sauce because it seemed a little sweet (that's saying a lot, coming from her).  By adding the noodles (although that's not traditional), there was enough to feed about 5-6 adults, healthy servings. So I've got left overs and looking forward to it for lunch tomorrow. One last thing, I added Sriracha hot chili sauce to my bowl to give it the extra dose of chili it was missing. It

I love this soup. I always make two pots, one with more curry paste and one milder. I usually use boneless, skinless chicken breast sliced very thin instead of or in addition to the shrimp. I like to add lots of Red Boat Fish Sauce, more mushrooms, kale, snow peas, sweet peppers, and scallions. It's a big hit among my friends and family.

Love this! I have made a few times and tweaked for personal preference. I add chopped red pepper, flatten the lemon grass and tie in a knot so I can retrieve before serving and always add some spinach. It's just delicious anyway you like it

Great recipe!  It is better than a lot of restaurants, and lemongrass is a lot easier to find than it used to be, so pick some up and give this a try if you like Thai.

I made some changes to the original recipe and it turned out AMAZING!!!

I added:
3-4 tsp. cayenne pepper,
2 cloves minced garlic,
1 tsp. onion powder,
1 tsp. garlic powder,
1 chicken bouillon cube.

Items I omitted:
I only used 2 cans of coconut milk, rather than 3.
NO fish sauce or lime juice. It turned out amazing, the cayenne pepper added the right spiciness I was looking for, and the rest of the seasonings made the soup much more savory. I will definitely be making this again.

This soup was right on the money! This recipe tasted just like how they make it in Thai restaurants. I prefer the soup to have a little kick of spiciness so I added Sriracha sauce, red pepper flakes and some red chili paste. Don't skimp on the lemongrass because that is the key to this recipe. If you've never worked with lemongrass before you can youtube how to cut it and there are many videos that will show you how. I used low sodium chicken broth since the recipe didn't specify and it came out great.  Can't wait to make it again!

This is so good!  I added in tofu with the shrimp, and next time I would double the solid ingredients or add more vegetables because we ended up with a lot broth and we like to eat it over rice like more of a curry.

This soup is so so so so delicious! I have seriously found my favorite soup recipe! The sweet and sour combination is perfectly balanced. I honestly can't say enough good things about it, just that you should make this! It seems like it could be served hot or cold (I served it immediately out of the pot). I only had two cans of coconut milk on hand instead of three, but two was just enough for me. Since I only cook for one (myself), there is plenty of leftovers. I am one very happy girl!

WONDERFUL recipe! I had almost none of the ingredients, so I substituted green onion for lemon grass and peppers for mushrooms and chicken instead of shrimp. I also doubled the curry paste because I like it with a bit of a kick :) Wonderful flavour, super easy, and crowd favourite!

I don't rate recipes but this is fantastic. I use 1 tsp dried lemongrass and make my own organic coconut milk in the blender which costs approx 1/8 the price of canned milk. Use 1 cup coconut chips per 2 cups not quite boiling water, blend 2-3 minutes then strain the coconut fiber. Definitely worth looking up if you use a lot of coconut milk! Oh and we use chunked fish instead of shrimp, cheaper and amazing!

Enjoyed this quite a bit! I looked at some of the recommendations for this and did this with chicken instead of shrimp. I also used only 1 can of coconut milk and half a can of coconut cream to make this and that seemed to be enough to get the level of cream we wanted. Very happy with this dish!

Huge success!! One suggestion though, if you don't have all of the ingredients, don't make it. You can taste every flavor used and it is soooo worth it. I had to use lemongrass paste. Someone wrote they used 1t. After tasting, I added another and that hit the mark.

Oh, good grief! This was a brilliant soup! I used the Thai Kitchen red curry paste, so added probably 4 times more than the recipe called for because Thai Kitchen is so wimpy. Other than that I made it as written and thank goodness I made enough for my lunch tomorrow. Thank you, Jessica, for sharing this beautiful soup recipe with us.  : )

My husband and I love the coconut soup at the Thai restaurant we go to so I found this recipe to make at home.  It is so good.  I like my soup a little thicker and spicier so next time I am going to reduce the chicken broth and increase the pepper paste.We used shrimp this time but next time I am going to try chicken.

This was easy and delicious! I used lemongrass paste since I was unable to find lemongrass.

Loved this soup! I more-than-doubled the red curry paste & shitake mushrooms since I like it spicy (this didn't make it too spicy as my husband doesn't enjoy food when it's too spicy, and he had 2 big bowls!) I used only 2 cans of cocnut milk. I also added a couple of fresh quartered plum tomatoes when I added the shrimp.Don't forget the fresh squeeze of lime before serving; the acid really compliments the rich coconut broth.

This recipe was great!  I have a pretty picky husband, so when he helped himself to seconds and thirds - and happily ate leftovers - I knew it was a good one.  It didn't turn out spicy for me at all, though.  I think that's because of the brand of red curry that I bought?  I'll have to play around with that.  :D

So delicious! I tweaked only a smidgen. I added Galangal at the beginning, used the suggestion of lemongrass stalk, substituted one can of regular coconut milk for light coconut milk because that's all I had, added an extra tbsp of curry, and a couple red pepper flakes. It seriously is one of the most delicious soups I've ever had! Thank you for the recipe!

Needed some tweaking.

First, next time I would cut down on the coconut milk.

Second, none of the Thai restaurants around me use shiitake mushrooms for this soup. If you are a big fan of shiitake mushrooms then go for it, but around me I've always had it at restaurants with regular old button mushrooms. The shiitakes added a very strong smokey shiitake flavor to the broth.

Third, I needed to add more sugar for it to taste like the stuff at the restaurant. After serving I just added some regular table sugar until it tasted like what I get at the restaurant.

Fourth, I have never had this soup from a restaurant with the lemongrass minced in. I have always had the lemongrass in 1-2 inch chunks that you can pick out. If you want to chew on lemongrass, mince away. I left mine in large chunks just because that's how it's always been served to me.

And finally, the recipe as written is very mild. I ended up adding some garlic chili paste to mine at the table. A bit of spice really helps offset and cut through the heavy coconut.

With those tweaks it ended up VERY close to restaurant quality, and very easy! Love it!

This "The Best Thai Coconut Soup" was good. My husband and I frequent the three Thai restaurants in our neighborhood and love coconut soup. My husband thought this was as good as any of the soups we have had in the restaurants, but I disagree. Aside from that, there is such a variation in different brands of red curry paste, and unfortunately I had to buy the brand from the supermarket because the Asian market was closed. I think it is very important to have a good quality red curry paste to make Thai soup. I ended up using 4 tablespoons of supermarket red curry paste (instead of the 2 teaspoons called for in the recipe) and still didn't get the flavor I was after. Regardless of the red curry paste, and although this soup was good, I will not likely make it again. I am looking for a recipe that tastes like the one from my favorite Thai restaurant. Thank you Jessica for sharing your recipe.

I made this and lived it but during tasting as it cooked i found i had to add 6  teaspoons of the curry paste to get it to have some curry flavor and and extra spoon of brown sugar. Not sure why i needed so much extra curry paste but when done it was delicious.

My husband and son really enjoyed this soup. (I don't eat shrimp, so I just made it for them.) We didn't have lemongrass, so I skipped it, but they said it was extremely good anyway. (Next time we'll use it to see how it goes.) They also requested a bit more curry next time.

This recipe is stellar.  The flavor is perfectly right as is.  Based on others' comments, I, too, added some chicken sliced thinly, during the simmer.  

The only thing I might do differently next time is to chop the lemongrass and ginger in large chunks, then tie them in cheesecloth so that they can be easily removed when the soup is done.

Delicious. I sautéed the mushrooms with some chopped cabbage first, then continued with the recipe.  I quadrupled the red curry paste and also added some soy sauce in place of the salt at the end.  And then I topped it with some peanuts for a little crunch.

I loved the flavors in this soup! Getting some of the ingredients felt like an investment, but I have happily used them for other Asian recipes. I used tofu and chicken in place of shrimp.

Very good, though I was worried whIle it was cooking ... was kinda stinky! I used veggie broth and used tofu instead of shrimp and was super yum-yum! I also cooked the final step a little longer than the five minutes mentioned. I'm not a huge fan of curry, but the amount here just gave a little heat, not too much flavor, perfect for my taste!

I've made this a few times. It's so delicious and easy to make! I used fresh minced ginger in the simmer instead of ground and I cut down on the fish sauce this last time, suits my families taste a bit better. All in all a really tasty recipe. I had never used lemon grass before this recipe, it's great. I keep most these ingredients in the house all the time so I find myself wanting to make this every week. Love it.

Great recipe, and if yo have the seasonings, you can make all kinds of additions/substitutions, and just use the recipe as a base. ie, I didn't have shrimp, but I had tilapia. I didn't have mushrooms, but I added shredded carrot with the fish, and then spinach at the very end. So good in the winter time, warming inside and out!

I am fortunate to live across from an Asian market. I have all the ingredients but added one kafir lime leaf from my tree.  Also, be sure to use a grater or a microplane for the lemon grass so you don't struggle with the texture like some reviewers mention.  I'm not a fan of spicy foods but the combination of these ingredients are so spectacular I would make again and again.  Also,  be sure to use this as your 'go to' recipe.  I would suggest for those that have trouble finding these ingredients, order them online so you can make this exactly as written and have them on hand.  Lastly, I used an Asian vermicelli noodle and pan fried in peanut oil.  So crispy to add to the top and the broth softens it when time to eat.  Well done Jessica!

This is a delicious soup! Unfortunately, I could not get hold of red curry paste, so I used a ton (est. 2 tbsp) of green curry paste and a pinch of curry powder; it still did not taste like curry at all, though. Nevertheless, the soup was fabulous with a nice deep coconut, lemongrass, ginger flavour. I added glass noodles, 1 tbsp of thinly sliced white onion, and chunks of extra-firm tofu to the recipe, in order to make more of a meal out of it. I decreased the fish sauce to 1 tablespoon, because I don't care much for salt or fish sauce - I found 1 tbsp plenty. I added the coconut milk one can at a time, and found that 1.5 cans yielded a soup that is plenty creamy - Any more and it would have been too rich (and high calorie) for me. I very finely minced the stalk of lemongrass and did not notice any chunks or hard bits. I loved the way this turned out! Next time, I hope to use red curry paste. The soup is great the next day, when the flavours have had time to meld together.

Tried this about 3 days ago and i loved it. Changes made-->did not use lemon grass, used 3 tsp of the red curry paste, used 2 cans coconut milk (3 would have been too much i think as others said), used 3 tbs of lime juice in the bottle, used 1 1/5 tbs ground ginger instead of fresh ginger. I also used 1lb large shrimp deveined and sliced in half. Added 3 thin sliced chicken breast chopped into bite size. Did not use fish sauce but used soy sauce instead. Chopped some scallions and 1 celery stalk. Didn't use mushrooms. The chicken broth was low sodium and fat free. I served it with thin rice noodles, added directly into the each bowl of soup. I would definitely make this soup again!

First this recipe is good, only I'm a bit surprised at the lack of substitutions. 
I added chicken, I fied it mostly though out in the first step. Then I put it in the pot with a couple of cups of cooked rice and brought to a boil then immediately removed from heat.
This worked amazingly we'll.

So good and savory. Like some, I only used two cans of coconut milk and I increased the curry by 1 tsp to make it spicier. Amazing.

I love, love, loooove Thai Coconut Soup. I get it at every Thai restaurant I have ever been too.. and that is quite a few. This is THE best I have ever had. I do tweak it a bit for my preferences. Chicken instead if shrimp.. I love spicy, so I add 8-12 Thai (birds eye) peppers. This recipe is honestly amazing. I'm very grateful for having this shared. I found it a while back and literally made it once a week for 4-5 months..and that was just for me!! Lol. This truly is THE BEST THAI COCONUT SOUP recipe out there!!!

This was really easy and delicious to make. i didnt have any fish sauce so i used soy sauce. I also doubled the curry paste since i like the thai dishes rather hot. Still it needed a bit of more heat (for our taste of course)

I loved this recipe. I just finished it today! I tweaked it a little to fit my family, by taking out the mushrooms, and adding fresh baby spinach and split peas. I also used two pounds of shrimp to make it meatier. I finished it off with jasmine rice . This will be a regular at my house! Thanks

Love the recipe. Makes lots, so great for leftovers/large gatherings. I basically stick to the recipe with the exception that I add cherry tomatoes and rice when making.

Very flavorful! I did forget to add the lime and I used green curry paste instead of red as that's what I had.
 I added 2 lb. of shrimp and I'm glad I did because even so, there was a lot of broth and not a lot of "stuff".  I did add brown rice as well.

This soup was amazing. My guests walked in and immediately started talking about how good it smelled! A light soup with bold flavors and a beautiful presentation. And I didn't even have the lemongrass! I paired it with veggie spring rolls (provided an assortment of julienned veggies, basil, peanuts, sauces and let everyone "roll their own.") I'm making it again this weekend for more guests and look forward to another excellent meal!

OMG YUMMY!!!! This is truly THE BEST soup!!! If you don't believe me, this is some of what my 7-year old said about it:
"Mom, this is THE best soup EVER!!! OMG, I think I'm going to die right 
now."
"Could there ever BE a better recipe??"
"Mom, we have to call the cops, it's illegal for anything to be this good!!" 
(no lie)
"OMG....MOM....did I say, this is the BEST SOUP EVER???!!!" times like 20. 
"Mom, this is so good I think my head is going to explode!"
It's easy, no fancy cooking, just maybe sorta fancy-ish ingredients.All can be had at the Harris Teeter though, if y'all have those!

OMG!!!! This soup is UNBELIEVABLE. i added other veggies to this like shredded carrot, spinach, snap peas and it just added that much more to this great soup. I also added way more red curry paste to the degree of my taste, around 3 tablespoons. Also i used coconut cream rather than coconut milk and lemon since i dodnt have lime. Oh man, the flavors!!! Truly a winning recipe that is versitle.

Yummy! I made a few modifications to make this recipe vegan (veggie broth, omitted shrimp and added veggies), and I also added some Thai chillies/sambal/Sriracha to make the soup spicy. Also added rice noodles, which turned out great. I would also recommend using coconut oil instead of vegetable oil!

Absolutely LOVE this recipe. No complaints from anyone. I only changed a couple of things. One, I live in a small town so they don't sell lemon grass (or the paste) so I had to leave that out. I also added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper, because we love spicy foods! I also am not a fan of shrimp so I left the shrimp out but instead added a package of rice noodles. I boil the noodles first, then run them under cold water so they don't stick, then add them to the soup. Delicious!!

I found this recipe to be on the right track for the flavors I was looking for...but those flavors were just not bold enough.  I doubled the red curry paste, lime juice, and brown sugar.  Extra fresh cilantro too.  I really appreciated this recipe because it was very simple and it  did get me very close to the Tom Kha Gai at my favorite Thai restaurants.  I found dried lemongrass in a jar on the Asian aisle and that has worked very well when I can't find fresh.  I have learned though, you cannot replace fresh cilantro and fresh lime juice...ever.  Thank you so much for sharing this because e I crave this stuff all the time!

Wow! This is one amazing recipe. I used raw chicken breast cut into smaller pieces instead of the shrimp - I added it at the same time as the shrimp was supposed to be put in, brought everything to a boil and let it simmer for about 6 minutes. I also cooked up some rice vermicelli separetly which I added to the soup right before serving. I will make this again and again.

I made the soup more like Tom Yum Gai soup and added onion, bok choy, chicken and, most importantly, tomatoes. For me tomatoes are the perfect balance to the curry and coconut. 

It was great and will become one of my favorite dishes in the winter. Thanks for sharing!

Good enough to satisfy my crazy craving.  Added more curry paste and cayenne pepper because I like mine very spicy.  Will be making it again.  Comes very close to what they serve at my fave restaurant.

Everyone loved this soup. Did add more curry paste, shredded chicken and  cooked basmati rice, since didn't have any noodles. Also used two cans of coconut milk, three would have been too much. Fabulous flavors. Next time will add more veggies. Will make this again & again.

I just finished making this soup and the flavor is awesome!!!  I did have one problem though, I went to my Thai store and bought the lemon grass; an ingredient I have never worked with and I asked the owner if I should leave the LG in my soup or take it out.  He said, "cut small and leave it in".  Well, I don't know if my LG was old or what, but it was like chewing on straw..  So, after 1 hour of simmering and no change, I removed it before added the rest of my ingredients.  After that, it was all good and worth making!!!!

This soup is amazing!!! There is this fancy restaurant in Paris where we eat this delicious soup and my husband loves it. I was looking for a recipe for it and after I found this one i decided to give it a try. It came up exactly like the one in Paris! It's absolutely divine, rich in so many flavors! Thank you for sharing!

This recipe is fantastic. I used lite canned coconut milk, and I couldn't taste the difference. I'm not sure why people are saying three cans of coconut milk was too much--it was delicious if made as the recipe was written. My husband usually stops at one or two bowls when we have soup, and he had three full bowls of this stuff! He's a big foodie, and loves trying new flavors, and he said this recipe is a new favorite. I also used lemon grass paste instead of lemon grass stalk as Jessica suggested in her follow-up comment, and it was great. I can't say enough good things about this recipe. Thanks for submitting, Jessica!

Excellent soup! Tasted very similar to the soup at our favorite Thai restaurant. Sauteed 1 TBSP curry powder with 2 shallots, 5 or 6 cloves of minced garlic and 1 TBSP of chili sauce instead of curry paste. Also didn't have lemongrass, substituted with grated lemon peel at the beginning with the ginger and curry. Added red and yellow pepper, also swapped chicken for shrimp!

Very good - used coconut water in place of chicken broth; use the whole amount of curry paste or it's not hot enough; used tofu for Daniel fast

This is so easy, I can make this in much less than the estimated time given. This is a 30 min meal for me.
I usually add thin rice noodles (about 200 grams for 2 adults and a toddler) and more veggies - bell pepper or baby corn works well - to make it more of a main meal.
Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, I have made it with chicken breast (sliced very thin, just add it to the hot soup and the slices will cook in 3 min) which also tastes delicious.
A great recipe to me is a forgiving recipe, and this is it: play around with sugar, ginger, thai curry levels, it always tastes good.
Easily augment it with additional favorites, too! 
I also dislike the chopped lemongrass, etc, so after the first step of simmering all the spices, I just remove the lemongrass and ginger pieces (that way I don't have to grate anything, just chop roughly), by simply pouring the soup through a sieve and the back into the pot again. Sure, it requires an additional dirty dish, but its so much faster than spooning/fishing all the bits out.
Update: still a favorite of ours, especially in the cold winter months.

This recipe is amazing!!! I don’t often review, but this one deserves more than 5 stars, if that were possible!  It’s pretty versatile. I followed the recipe when I made it last night, minus the lemongrass (which I didn’t have). I subbed lemon juice instead.  I added garlic and extra curry paste. I used chicken instead of shrimp, and used coconut oil in addition to olive oil.  I also use REAL chicken stock instead of storebought stuff, which really makes it super-healthy, especially in the cold weather! I served it over rice noodles. No matter how I vary it, it is so yummy every time I make it! Definitely a standard at our house now!

Absolutely delicious and easy to make. I added a bit more curry paste to taste and otherwise wouldn't change a thing.

Had to add more paste.  But I just get a generic brand so it may be more bland than some.  Other than that: fantastic.

Absolutely Fabulous!  I added 4 tsp of Thai Chili Garlic Sauce and used low sodium vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  No salt needed.  Make sure to chop the lemon grass up very fine to achieve a lovely crispy-crunchy effect.

Great!
Though the lemon-grass doesn't cook so you need actually to remove it before adding the coconut milk.

I loved this soup. I did add more curry paste and a bit more fish sauce. I like my foods to have a lot of zip. Instead of brown sugar I used maple syrup. (It's better for you.) I served it with rice that we put in our bowls with the soup. YUM!

This was absolutely delicious! I made it as specified though I didn't think it was spicy enough and I generally don't like anything too spicy. I think this could be due to variations in brands of curry paste like the author said. We kept adding a lot of Sriacha sauce as we were eating it.
I think I'll try less coconut milk next time, not so much because of the flavor but because of the fat content. Yikes!
Also - this was the first time I had grated ginger and it takes more ginger than I thought. A good work out too! The lemongrass was much more difficult to cut than I expected, very dense and pulpy but what a lovely flavor it adds.
I'll definitely make this again, especially as a treat for guests. Sure to impress.

Getting ready to make it again, but with chicken and chunks of tomato. It is better than what we have had in several Thai restaurants! We also serve it over/with Thai style rice noodles which gives us a more authentic experience. Thank you for this wonderful rendition of a favorite dish :)

I made a one change to make it pescetarian friendly, but I believe it was still amazing!   Instead of using chicken stock, I used water and vegetarian "Better Than Bouillon."   So, I used 4 cups water to 2 teaspoons of Better Than Bouillon.  The Bouillon is very salty, so I didn't need to add any extra salt in the last step (and I love salty foods!  So, if you prefer less salty food, use less of the Bouillon.)  Also, I made some rice noodles and they were a great base for the soup.  I will definitely make this again!  I loved it!!!!

Simply amazing,I have had this recipe in my bookmarks for over a month and I just finally finished cooking it and it simmering while I'm filling out my report.
 
I love this style of cooking it just hits to the soul were my body can detect this is real food, but with that knock you out punch of flavor.

The recipe gave me the foundation for my sauce mix, but I added more chicken broth flavor because the liquid broth was too plain so I then added the concentrated bouillon to my flavor and BOO_YAH its a HIT thanks Miss for this recipe. 

Cant wait to show off and send my mother in law a bowl of this over some rice she's going to think now I see why my son married her lol Im taking all credit !!!!

Amazing!  Even though just used white champignons and not oyster mushrooms.  After my third time making it I got this just the way we like it. I used 4 tbsp of mild curry, 4 tbsp of lime/lemon.  My husband's favorite soup now:) yay!

Thank you so much, Jessica, for posting this recipe! I have made homemade tom kha kai (my favorite food in the world) twice before from two different recipes, both much more complicated than this one and both disappointing.  This recipe is AWESOME! I tried to stay as true to the original as possible, but I had to make some adjustments for health and convenience purposes.  I used unrefined coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I substituted 2 grated carrots (added at the same time as the ginger) instead of brown sugar. I used 1.5 lbs of chicken instead of shrimp and 1/2 lb of portobella mushrooms instead of shiitake. I also had to substitute 1 can of coconut milk by using "SO Delicious" original coconut milk (it's like using Sunny D instead of real orange juice) and 1/2 lemon peel, grated, instead of lemongrass. Regardless, this soup was to die for, and this is a great base recipe. I think the coconut milk to broth ratio was perfect, and I will make this again and again. You could definitely add assorted veggies (thai chilis, savoy cabbage, bamboo shoots, bell peppers, sliced carrots), but this recipe gives you the jumping off point for an easy but tasty tom kha kai. Thanks again!

I also add crunchy spaghetti squash...Cut your raw squash in half lengthwise...run a knife around the outside of the seeds then take a spoon and scrape out all of the seeds in one big scrape...place your squash cut side down in 1-2" of water...cover with wax paper...microwave the squash half for only 7 minutes...while I am cooking the second squash half I run cold water on the back of the first one for about 1-2 minutes...this permits me to quickly, without further steaming, scrape the long strands our of the squash leaving it still crunchy...I add this to the soup at the last minute.

Very tasty. Completely pleased. Not spicy at all. Love the cilantro.  I added curry paste to taste. I made double batch and much went to waste, only because it yielded too much. Its appetizer like. This is not a dinner soup, this will not fill you up.

I really liked this recipe, but Jason wasn't a huge fan of the mushrooms.  Get the dried shitake ones in the asian aisle.  Would like to try again with lite coconut milk.  Added baby corn and would like more vegetables next time.  Could be spicier  Used the pre-cooked salad shrimp  Will make again just so I can use the fish sauce.  Kept the lemon grass whole and just retrieved them after simmering and grated the lime peel right into the soup also used ginger instead.

I am SO happy to have found this recipe.  The broth tastes exactly like the Tom Kha Kai soup I used to have at my favorite Thai restaurant.  I've always wanted to make it, but all the recipes I looked up had crazy ingredients like galangal or lime leaves.  I love that this recipe has ingredients that are easy for me to find without sacrificing any of the amazing taste! 

I did end up adding about three tablespoons of red curry paste to make it spicy enough, and next time I will definitely just throw the lemongrass in whole and then take it out...I wasn't a fan of the little fibrous pieces.  I used chicken instead of shrimp and added water chestnuts.  Next time I'm going to make a vegetarian version using this broth with tofu, carrots, broccoli, snap peas, baby corn, water chestnuts and mushrooms!

No leftovers = fantastic recipe!  I accidentally got two cans of coconut milk instead of three so substituted one can of whole cow milk and I have to say I think it was good that I did because the coconut milk was so rich even with just two cans that it may have been overwhelming if there had been three.  I added quite a bit of extra curry as well as mixing green onions with the cilantro for a garnish.  It was so good!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was AWESOME! tonight served in a bowl over steam fried noodles  with dutch crunch rolls on the side. I split the lemongrass stalk in 4 pieces and then removed it just before serving as the recipe submitter suggested in their review.  This soup was amazing! Easy too and next time, definitely more red curry paste. Thanks so much for sharing.

I love this recipe.  It is really easy.  I added a little more ginger, cilantro and some fresh basil.  I love those three fresh ingredients and could not help myself.  My husband and I cannot stop eating it.

Very yummy soup and fairly easy to throw together. My local grocery didn't have lemongrass and I ran out of time to drive across town to the more gourmet one but it was fine without it. Added a bunch of extra curry paste because I know the brand we buy has very little spice. Would definitely make again, maybe adding a few more veggies (red pepper - not sure what else.)

This was wonderful! My family loved it. I used the minced fresh lemongrass just like the recipe and thought it was good. I did actually finely minced the ginger rather than grated slices, and thought it was really great (but mincing was time consuming). At first I thought it wasn't hot enough with 2 T curry paste, but after simmering for awhile it was actually just spicy enough for my family ... served with red pepper flakes for my husband (who likes EXTRA SPICY everything) ... but he didn't use it and liked it as is! I did use all LITE cans of coconut milk instead of the regular and we thought it tasted wonderful, but saved on the calories.

This is a good basic recipe for this dish. I don't eat meat so I sub veggie broth for the chicken.  I make a garnish plate with fresh lime, cilantro, green onions, and fresh slivers of jalapeno. It's great over rice, by itself, or with rice roodles. I don't usually buy shitake mushrooms, I just use basic white or cremini, but I can guarantee any type will be delicious. Oh and add extra mushrooms, I prefer twice as many mushrooms as shrimp.

My family loved this recipe! I doubled the recipe to freeze the left overs (works great by the way). The first thing I did was use chicken instead of shrimp and mushrooms. I put three breasts whole in to cook and soak up the flavor. Second I let this simmer slow and low for about 3-4 hrs to really set the flavors. You don't have to do this but the chicken starts to fall apart and it really brings out the spices. I tried stalk lemongrass and tube lemongrass the different times I made this, and I find the tube adds more flavor. But if texture is what you are looking for then you might want to go with stalk. My family also really likes heat so I added 1-2 tsp extra of curry and 6-7 tsp of chile paste  e.g. sambal oelek (keep in mind that's total for two batches at once). The end result is heaven. I served on some rice noodles I boiled separately, but this isn't neccesary since the soup is pretty filling on it's own. I didn't add any salt since the fish sauce had more than enough to flavor the dish. I get about 14 servings out of a double batch.

This recipe was fast, easy, and delicious! I added shrimp to mine. The only thing I would change: make a horizontal cut in the lemon grass, and before serving take it out.

Great soup.  Everyone loved it.  Spice factor depends on the type of curry paste you use, and mine DEFINITELY added a whole lot of spice.  I ersonally thought there was way too many mushrooms in it, but maybe I just sliced them too thin(?).  Didn't deter from the taste though.  Great recipe, thanks!

This was absolutely delicious with so many layers of flavor.  I didn't have fresh cilantro, so substituted thai basil and served over bismati rice to make more of an entree.  My husband and I both loved it for dinner, and I have to confess that I had more for breakfast the next morning!

This is super yummy! Just as good as any I have had in a restaurant. 
But, on a side note- I got kind of sick to my stomach after I ate it. I don't know if my body just isn't used to the amount of fat in the coconut milk or what. Who knows- but it was delicious!

This soup was so delicious and relatively easy to make. I was missing a few things, so I substituted olive oil for vegetable oil, white sugar for brown sugar and I did not have any cilantro. But it was still incredibly delicious! Just like the soups I crave in the little local thai restaurants.

I thought this recipe was a really great one.  I did of course change it up a little.  First thing I did was add a couple of scallions to the base.  I limited the lime juice just a bit and I added salmon pieces into the broth at the end instead of shrimp.  The biggest change that I made though was adding rice noodles, which I put in the same time as the salmon. (let simmer about 4 minutes before serving to soften or pre-soften and just toss in).  Thanks for a great recipe!

This soup is excellent!  I use the coconut milk broth as a base, and add an subtract items based on what I have available, e.g., mushrooms, pumpkin, squash, sweet potato, tofu...  Always turns out rich, creamy and satisfying.

Wow.  This was SO GOOD.  Like many others, I used lemon grass paste.  I also used sushi type ginger because I had some I wanted to use up.  I don't know what it would have tasted like if I'd used those ingredients fresh but I can't imagine it tasting any better.  The only thing I would change next time is maybe add some more red chili paste to give it a bit more of a kick.  It wasn't very spicy at all.  But TERRIFIC flavor.  I woke up this morning and had to resist the urge to eat it for breakfast!

My modifications because of limited availability: white mushrooms and tube lemongrass.  Added bean sprouts just because I love them.  Taste wise this was good.  My only reservation was that my soup looked VERY white(much like photo 4)  Was a bit off putting if you're somewhat of a visual eater.  Will probably use reviewers suggestions on tweaking this recipe

This soup is so very tasty! I did rate it 4 stars (instead of 5) because I feel that it was missing something. Next time, I will definitely be adding snow peas and baby corn. I didn't have fresh lemongrass, but the tube worked okay. I added about half a can extra coconut milk as well as grated carrots. I found some Jasmine rice at the grocery store and served it with the soup. It tastes wonderful!

Absolutely delicious! I added chicken and sliced red potatoes and served over rice to imitate a soup I had eaten at a Thai restaurant. The whole family liked this and I will definitely be making this again, over and over! Great flavor!

I added carrots, onion, green pepper, and chicken instead of the shrimp.  Pretty tasty.  Next time I will be adding more curry.  Not quite enough kick for my liking.

I've made this over and over again, and everyone that tries it is amazed about how good it is. I like to add some cayenne pepper for more spice.

This was absolutely fantastic.  I think it was better than what I've had in Thai restaurants.  I was unable to find lemon grass, so I substituted a Thai paste (from the produce section) which included lemon grass, ginger, cilantro and garlic.  I also used button mushrooms instead of the shiitake.  And, I didn't want to pay the price of a fresh lime, so I used a fresh lemon.  Wow!  I will make this again and again! I'm not sure how Allrecipes arrived at the time involved in this recipe.  It sure didn't take an hour to make this great soup.

Simply awesome.  Easy to make, great flavours, and surprisingly refreshing for a hot/mildly spicy soup - even in the summer this is a great dish!

This soup is excellent! I couldn't find the lemongrass or lemongrass paste in my grocery store so I had to omit it. However, the flavors were very authentic and comforting. I'm allergic to shrimp so I added cubed firm tofu instead. My 3 year old and 20 month old surprisingly loved it as well. I'm glad I found this recipe! I will definately be making this again!

This was exactly what I was craving!  My variations: I used chicken instead of shrimp (added a few minutes after the chicken broth so it cooked for about 10 minutes), a small can of bamboo stalks instead of the mushrooms, and a generous tablespoon of curry paste (could have been spicier for my sake, but it was just right for my kids), and I left the bamboo stalk whole and took it out at the end.  I was worried about the amount of fish sauce, but it definitely doesn't taste fishy.  I have made curry without it in the past and it's just not the same.  In the future I think I would garnish with fresh Thai basil, but the cilantro was okay.

This soup was wonderfull. I used homemade chicken broth with left over chicken instead of shrimp. Had leftovers so the next night I added cooked lobster and scallops that I had frozen in the freezer in a white wine and garlic sauce. All I can say is WOW.

I used chili oil instead of vegetable oil, added 2 chopped scallions, and doubled the mushroom and lime juice. Also used shredded chicken breast instead of shrimp. My husband had two big bowls, and he generally dislikes anything but meat and potatoes. Will be adding this as a staple dish in our household. Yum!

This is a tasty recipe. I think next tme i will use veggie stock. The chicken stock took over the taste of the coconut milk. I also added thai hot sauce to make it spicy.

This was a really good basic recipe. I had to increase curry paste to 6 teaspoons and sugar to 3 tablespoons for my palate. I couldn't find lemongrass at my grocery store so I substituted lemon zest. Zest is a much closer substitute than lemon juice is. We are not cilantro people, so I garnished with basil and chives. Next time I will increase chicken stock and use only 1 can of coconut milk. I will also put in some garlic and sliced onion. More "stuff" in the soup. I served with a scoop of jasmine rice in the bottom of the bowl and soup poured over.

I would have given this 5 stars since my husband loved it so much, but I'm just not a big fan.  He actually ate his bowl AND mine!  It was a very interesting blend of flavors, though it could have been spicier.  This was my first time cooking with coconut milk too, so don't let my opinion steer you away!  I served this with Thai Chicken Bites with dipping sauce from this website...but I wrapped them in lettuce leaves instead of serving as an appetizer.  Definitely edible, but not my favorite recipe...sorry.  Thank you for a very interesting dinner! :)

This soup was absolutely incredible! I used a lot more red curry paste and added broccoli, red pepper and green beans. The extra vegetables added a lot of extra texture and flavor. I will definitely try this soup again! I've eaten it over rice and noodles as well as on it's own. THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE!

This was good!!  I did double the curry paste and even added red pepper flakes to it as well(we like it hot!) I also added a couple chicken breast and some sliced sweet onion to make more substantial. Then I also doubled the lime juice, gives it more zip!  I serve it with Jasmine rice.  I will make again with my changes.

Absolutely fantastic! I made with chicken instead of shrimp and mushrooms. I sauteed the chicken on low in the oil, ginger, lemon grass & red curry paste. I then added the other ingredients and cooked on lower heat for longer. The flavours were absorbed by the chicken. My husband almost passed out when he ate it (he thought it was so good)! Next time, I'll add bamboo shoots.

Loved it! I did substitute chicken for the shrimp, added an extra tsp of curry paste, and a pinch of cayenne pepper for a little zing. Those changes are just personal preference, it would've been a 5 anyway.

I am not a fan of this kind of soup but my husband and neighbor are huge fans...this is one of the best recipes they have ever had. I made it for a dinner party and everyone raved about it. Two of the couples were Thai so that says a lot!! Thank you and happy cooking!

Loved this recipe!!!  I am sad to say I did not have some of the traditional ingredients but I really wanted to try it so I got creative.  I substituted lemon juice for the lemon grass and red pepper flakes instead of red curry paste.  It was delicious over brown rice and leftovers were just as tasty.  I will definitely try this again when I have all the ingredients.  A keeper for sure!

Loved this soup.  We added the rice and it was scrumptious.  Next I want to add noodles.  The shrimp were plumb and succulant.

My husband and I made this soup tonight and loved it!!!!  The only thing we modified was we added 2 cans of coconut milk instead of 3 and doubled the curry paste.  We also added cayenne pepper to give it more bite.  It was DELICIOUS!!!  We'll be making this soup again that's for sure!!

This is really good, but not enough substance (too much liquid).  The taste is great, but it needs something else...potatoes and/or snow peas perhaps.  Will make again.

Absolutely fabulous!  I stuck to the recipe exactly.  It was definitely on the spicy side, which I love, but it was a little too spicy for some...so just keep that in mind with the red curry paste.

This was really, really good. I completely forgot lime at the store, so I just omitted it, and I used half freeze dried mushrooms and half fresh  because shiitake mushrooms are so expensive. My store also didn't have lemon grass, so I followed the paste suggestion and additionally I added a few scallions with the mushrooms to get a little more color in the soup. I also took the rice suggestion and made brown basmati instead of the regular white--delicious!  Thanks for the recipe, it totally hit the spot.

Delicous & easy recipe! Only used two cans of coconut milk instead of three (on accident) & it still tasted creamy and good, plus it cut out some fat. I'll definitely be using this one again.

This tastes very good.  The flavors all mesh well. Though I didn't have any lemongrass, I'm sure it would have been great in it.  The one thing I'll say is that it's much thicker than I'd expected.  It doesn't seem so much like a soup I'd eat on its own, but would be great over rice (as I now see is mentioned in the description).  So, my rice is cooking and then I'm going to enjoy!

Enjoyed this but made some changes. I used light coconut milk and would definitely use the stalk of lemongrass istead of chopping it up; I didn't enjoy the chrunchy texture. I like the idea of rice, as previously mentioned. I sauteed the mushrooms in the beginning to add more flavor, used fresh garlic, and added the shrimp later because I used pre-cooked shrimp.

I've made this several times, following the recipe exactly.  When I made it today, I used Lite coconut milk, just to cut down on the fat a bit.  We were not disappointed.  The flavor was excellent, and the slightly thinner broth still packed a solid flavor punch!  This is one of our favorite soups.

It was pretty good.  I subbed Thai culinary stock for chicken stock, only used 1 tablespoon of fresh ground ginger, forgot the lime at the end and added a stir fry veggie mix instead of just mushrooms so my mother would eat it to.  It needs more spice and probably the lime at the end but overall a fun recipe that I will play with to make perfect!

This soup was FAN-TASTIC!!  Tasted just like what I've had in some of my favorite Thai restaurants.  Served it to guests and boyfriend last night and it received raves from EVERYONE!  And it was SO EASY.  The only substitute I made was swapping out shrimp for chicken (guest preference).  I cut up boneless/skinless chicken breasts and sauteed them in just a bit of coconut oil before adding to the soup.  Chicken was tender and the entire dish was just so doggone delicious.  :-)  Will definitely add this to the repertoire.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is by far the best Thai Coconut Soup I've ever tried. I used dried shitake mushrooms rehydrated of course and added 3/4 teaspoon of salt at the end. Also threw in a can of small shrimp, as I was making tempura battered shrimp too. This recipe makes alot, but you won't regret it-OMG,it's unbelivable!

I'm a culinary novice who likes to try out new recipes.  I made this recipe tonight and my fiance and I loved it!  It was easy to make and very flavorful.  But: 1) I used curry powder instead of red curry paste... I live in Los Angeles and went to 3 grocery stores (one of them an Asian market), and no luck!!  It was still great, but I'll try Whole Foods for the paste next time. 2) I used 2 cans of light coconut milk. 3) There was about 1/3 too many mushrooms! 4) We weren't fans of the crunch, so next time I'll cut the lemongrass in larger chunks and strain them out. All in all, great recipe, I can't wait to try it with red curry paste.

Very good.  I added some tofu, and it was very nice.  Couldn't find lemongrass ANYWHERE, and it definitely was missing something.  Later found some at a specialty store, will use it next time.. and there WILL be a next time!

This soup was amazing!  Very mild in the beginning, but has a bit of a bite with the ginger towards the end.  Its very authentic and I will certainly make it again.
