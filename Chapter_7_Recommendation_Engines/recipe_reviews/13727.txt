Very good.  I didn't have red onions, so I used yellow.  I also used chicken broth instead of the liquid from the oysters.  I took this to a Christmas gathering and it got rave reviews, even from those who don't like oysters.

excellent recipe.  The only changes I made was I added a can of chicken broth and doubled up on the corn bread and the white bread.  Made it juicy, but yet not runny

This was my first time every making dressing at all.  Instead of the red & green onions, I used 1 yellow onion. I chopped the onion and celery up very fine.  For the soft bread cubes, wasn't for sure what it meant, so I tore about regular loaf bread slices for it-you can see them in it, one thing I didn't like. And I used chicken broth instead of the oyster juice.  Someone also told me to use the instead of the cornbread not the edges or bottoms.  It's delicious! Can't wait for the rest of the family to try it!  Thanks!

I make this dressing on the holiday's. I boil turkey necks and when cooled I pull the meat off and add to my dressing. I also add the giblets to the dressing. Great basic recipe for oyster dressing. I learnes it from my grandmother and it took me about 4 years to get it to taste like her's. Wish I would of had this one to get me tarted years ago.

1.21.15 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/13727/southern-cornbread-oyster-dressing/ ... First time making oyster dressing.  First time having it, too!  'Made "Oyster Dressing" by Erika Michael, too.  Both are good.  I like this one a bit better because it doesn't have any ingredients to detract from the oysters - 1t salt, 1/2t black pepper.  It's subtle, but so good!  I subbed a regular "ole yella onion" here.  Also added half cup chicken broth since I'm one of the group that likes moist dressing as compared to the crouton type.  :D  My container of oysters was 12 ounces.  I poured the whole thing in - didn't reserve & measure.  This fit in a 9x11, but could've gone smaller.  Moistness thing again - I covered half an hour then uncovered for fifteen more, 350. 'Really glad I tried it.  Thanks.
