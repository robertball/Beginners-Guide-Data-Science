WOW! I LOVE different kinds of sandwiches like this! I did lightly drain the tuna (I used and Italian oil-packed tuna) b/c I didn't want it to be too runny, and I'm glad I did. I only had regular cheddar cheese and Italian bread on hand, so I used those. Oh man, this is a seriously delicious sandwich! Great blend of flavors and textures. Be sure to keep a stack of napkins on hand, this is a messy one, lol! I will def be making this again~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

If you stop after the addition of cheese and leave it as an open-faced sandwich without the cream cheese or top bread slice, you have a tuna melt. The recipe as it stands is definitely not. Tuna melts are easy. Make your favorite tuna salad recipe (classic New Jersey diners add a little celery, onion, and a touch of mustard with the mayo, nothing else), cover two slices of toasted bread with tuna salad, spreading a little thinner than usual. Rye bread is traditional, but whole wheat is nice, too. Top with your favorite cheese (Cheddar, American and Swiss are all traditional), and broil until the cheese melts and begins to brown. Serves 1.

I used tuna in water and it turned out good. I would drain the tuna next time because it's a little runny which makes this very messy to eat.

Love this recipe! Make it all the time. I have IBS so I use sourdough bread and leave out the onions. If I don't have dill pickles, I sub 1 tbsp of relish. If I don't have cheddar, I use colby. Also add a little salt and pepper to the tuna mix. Love this sandwich either way!

An absolute favorite in my household. I can't quite figure out the least messy way to make this but the mess is worth it!

I thought it was good but I didn't have cream cheese on hand so I used more mayonnaise instead. Next time I will use the cream cheese. The only problem was too much filling for only two sandwiches and the filling spilled; out of course it was still good so I didn't care.

I never used mustard in tuna but it was good! I didn't use irish cheddar or whole grain bread.

Good, but SOOO rich - way too rich for our taste. I prefer simple tuna sandwiches, but it was fun to try.

I have been wanting to make something like this a long time, and found this recipe. Conceptually it was great. What I found with this recipe is it is missing a binding, either egg or some type of flour to keep the patties in patty shape. Next time I would add a bit of both. Served it over lettuce with rice. Very good.
