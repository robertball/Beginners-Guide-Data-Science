Sooooo good & soooo easy. Th only things I skipped were the  pepper & mushrooms simply because I don't like them & oil because I didn't feel it was needed & it wasn't.  The loaf was moist & tender, held its shape & tasted yummy. I'll be repeating this experience again.

I made this, delicious! Changed it for my fryer, no oil or mushrooms and used crushed crackers.. Split meatloaf into 4 equal balls. cooked it at 365f for 8 minutes, then coated with catsup and cooked for another 5 mins, perfect.

i made meat loaf in the air fryer and I couldn't get it up to temperature (165 degrees) so i had to throw it out.  when i researched cooking meat loaf in an air fryer, i discovered that the only benefit of cooking this way is that it reduces cook time

This recipe cooking in an air fryer was truly one of the best meatloafs my husband and I have eaten in years!   I used Panko bread crumbs and did not use the mushrooms but lighly wiped olive oil on top -the top of the loaf was brownish black and DELICIOUS!

Time/Temp was off, burnt the top and didn't cook the middle. May try again but will have to make adjustments.

I tried this for the first time tonight. I love salt, but it was way too salty! I will definitely cut the salt by half next time.  I omitted the oil and mushrooms and didn't feel it  was missing anything. Also, I cooked it for 30 minutes instead of 25 and it was over cooked. My mistake! Lol.

Next time we will set oven to 390 degrees F because I could not set it to 392 and put it on 395. The top was too dark but the family loved it anyways.

I didn’t put onion (my husband can’t eat), but added onion powder.    It was great, but won’t cook as long.

Outside black and inside still not done. I am not thrilled with the look but it tastes ok (after scraping off the over cooked edges. Recipe seems ok. Don't see advantage in using the air fryer as cooking time almost the same as oven time.
