WOW! Contrary to the other reviewers, this was great, and much easier/convienent than going to the story and paying a lot more money than it's worth for it.  I did change the recipe to what I had: instead of cream, I used milk, and I used chocolate chips only instead of a baking square with it (I added 1T chocolate chips for each square.) THANKS SO MUCH! My little brothers loved it.

EXCELLENT!  I made this according to the recipe and realized it never told you to add the vanilla extract, so I didn't.  It was a wonderful chocolate fudge topping.  Hubby said to please keep this recipe.  He loved it!  Knowing his favorite flavor is mint chocolate chip, I added some peppermint extract to some of the left-over sauce and asked him what he thought.   "Absolutely a winner!"  Either way, this sauce is EXCELLENT.  It is truly a 5 star recipe in our book!!  Thank you Kathy for sharing this EXCELLENT recipe!

I didn't have the cream on hand, so used canned condensed milk.  It is exactly the right thickness and consistency.  It was so quick to make and so-o-o-o-o delicious, I'll never buy hot fudge sauce at the store again!  I can't wait to invite my grandkids over for ice cream sundaes!
