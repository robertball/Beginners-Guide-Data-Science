I only gave this three stars, because while this is good with some modifications, if you follow the directions exactly it's not really worth eating.  The first thing you need to do is add more mayonaise--three tablespoons just isn't enough to make it creamy.  I also used sweet pickle relish instead of the dill pickles.  The sweet pickle relish mixes better, adding consistency and flavor throughout the salad.  I would suggest adding the ingredients to your own tastes, and not following the suggested amounts.

Very good "basic" chicken salad that you can but in your own additions based on your tastes. I made this for my husband to take to work, so no additions needed. I used a bit more mayo and used a bit of onion powder vs. onion. And, like others I used sweet pickle relish vs. chopping dill pickles. I put this into a tortilla along with some lettuce, tomato and a couple of slices of bacon for a really good wrap sandwich.

I made this chicken salad again, this time for a wedding shower.  I used Kraft Real Mayonnaise, Vlassic Baby Dills, and ONE yellow onion in the recipe.  I used my food processor to chop all the ingredients and spread the chicken salad on wheat hoagie buns (cut them into 5ths).  Every lady at the shower has asked for this recipe and what exact ingredients (BRANDS) I used.  I made sure they all knew I only used one large yellow onion and not 6 onions like the recipe called for in the scaled to 50 version.  It was the hit of the shower as far as the food selection.  EVERY sandwich was eaten!  I scaled the recipe for 50 servings and spread generous amounts on each hoagie bun then cut the sandwiches into 5 servings per bun.  This is by far the BEST and most easy, tasty chicken salad I have ever made or tasted.  I highly recommend using this recipe.

For those of us who are obsessed with celery, dill pickles and chicken, this is the dish for us! My family totally loved this one, but not as much as I did. And Angel, 3T of mayo is just perfect for a small chicken breast or two small halves. I didn't change a thing, except I didn't want to deal with a half chicken breast so I used it all (but it was small).I also used red onion for color. Your measurements are perfect! This is a keeper. We loved the subtle taste that the dill pickle and onion provided. For those of us who love savory over sweet meat and poultry dishes, this is a definite keeper.I served on a bed of red leaf lettuce and garnished with thin rings of red onion. YUM! Thanks Angel.

I don't get it. To all of those that rated this recipe down then said to use sweet relish, not fair. I am one of those that does not like sweet meat salads (there are a few of us out there) so I was purposely looking for one that does not have sweet relish and here it is! Perfect the way it is! No gloppy mayo salad, just enough to hold it together and the dill pickles are prefect!!! That is what this recipe is and if you are more partial to sweeter salads, look for a recipe that suits your taste instead of bashing something that isn't what you want. This is a wonderful recipe!!! Thank you Angel!

Ohhh yahhh!!! Not sure how much chicken I used (made a roast chicken earlier in the week and used the left overs), roughly 2-3 cups. I used 2 celery stalks, 4-5 Tbsp Miracle Whip (to account for the extra chicken), 1/4 cup sweet onion, 2 dill pickles, 1/4 tsp garlic powder and salt and pepper to taste.  I chopped everything really tiny just because I like it that way. It lets you get a little of everything in each bite. I LOVED IT!!! I asked my husband if he liked it and he said, "it's oniony". As other reviews stated, I guess it's a matter of personal taste. It was super quick, super easy, and super good. We had it with Chicken Ramen Noodles. Nice, easy meal, almost no clean up. I'll make this with all my leftover chicken.T hanks Angel.

Basically the same recipe I've used for many years. For a change, you may wish to use sweet pickles or bread&butter pickles. Chopped green onion can be milder than regular onion and, of course, the amount of mayo will vary according to the size of the chicken breast. Also, don't be shy to add some leg or thigh meat to the mix.

You're an Angel. Toasted chicken salad sandwiches and a bottle of light beer is my favorite lunch. The ingredients don't overpower the chicken itself. I'm a big fan. This one is in my recipe box. An emphatic thanks!

Thought this was very good.  I used all ingredients listed but used less onion and more dill pickle.  (See photo)  All I can say is yum!  Thanks Angel

This chicken salad was very good.  I don't eat celery, so, I did not add it.  I did add, however, about a 1/2 tsp. of dijon mustard and a little extra pepper, let it sit in the fridge for about an hour and toasted up some bread.  It had a very good consitancy and was very pleasing..thanks.

I made this chicken salad and served it on small rolls for a baby shower.  It was a hit!  I omitted the pickle (personal preference).  I will be using this recipe again!  Thanks!

This is actually my first time making chicken salad, and I'm quite proud of myself! This recipe is really yummy! I used dill relish instead of pickles because another review said it mixed better, and I used green onions instead of regular so it wouldn't have such a harsh onion flavor (personal preference). I also added about half a can of black olives, quartered, which helped cut the celery taste. (We made enough for about 6 serving) Served on toasted wheat bread with a slice of cheese, my boyfriend thought it was great! I added some fresh spinach leaves and a couple slices of tomato to my sandwich-wonderful!! Thanks, Angel, for helping me out. This recipe is a great basis to work off of!

This is now the only chicken salad that I make.  This time I baked 3 bone in, skin on chicken breast.  I rubbed them with olive oil, salt, pepper, and dried thyme.  They baked for 30min @ 350.  Excellent!

This is how chicken salad should be done!! lol It is one of my all time favorite foods but the ones I buy in restaurants or grocery stores are far too sweet for my taste. The only modifications I made to it were to skip the pickles. Not a pickle fan! lol I also increased the amount of chicken and mayonnaise and added pecans and a small amount of white grapes for a slight sweetness. Served it in pita bread and I was in heaven!!

I used ground turkey i/o chicken since that's what I had on hand.. and shallots since raw onions are usually not my thing. That worked well too.  This recipe has great consistency. Can't wait to try it with chicken.

I made this last night and my husband and I both loved it! It was especially good to me because I am not a miracle whip / salad dressing / sweet pickle person which so many use in their chicken salad. Thank you for this great recipe.

Great recipe!  I was too lazy to shred the chicken, so I used a can of chicken instead.  It was still really good.  I'm sure it would be even better with fresh chicken breast though.  It tastes even better the next few days after you make it!

This is a fantastic recipe - with a little modification - I would use 2-3 large chicken breasts, decrease to a 1/4 onion and add only one pickle.  A little salt and pepper and this is better than any chicken salad I find in restaurants!

I thought this was very good. It tastes the way I think chicken salad should taste. I did change the amounts of some of the ingredients, based on personal prefs. Quick, easy, and tasty. What else could you ask for?

This chicken salad has nice consistency and pretty good flavor.  It needed one more think in my opinion and luckily for me the chicken I used was already marinaded in a honey mustard.  That added a little extra flavor and it worked well.  Thanks for the recipe.

I use whatever kind of pickles are in my fridge at the time (if I had pickle relish I would have used that) and canned chicken.  Very good.

This is the exact recipe for chicken salad that has been in my family for years except for the dill pickle and what a great addition that is, wish I'd thought of that. I suggest using more mayo as other reviews stated. This is a five star recipe but I am only adding a note.

Sorry to say my family didn't like this chicken salad.  Made my hubby a nice big sandwich with lettuce and served it to him, he took a bite and went yuk, so I had to make him a P & J instead.

Mmmm... this was so good. Exactly what I think of when I think chicken salad. Didn't change anything but the addition of sweet pickles instead of dill. Fantastic! I didn't measure the mayo, I just mixed it in until it was creamy enough for me.

I loved this chicken salad.  However, I pressure cooked a whole chicken, instead of one chicken breast.  I also only used one stalk of celery.  If you use only one chicken breast, two dills, and 2 celery stalks it is way too crunchy.  I prefer mine with more meat to it and less crunch.  It is all in what you like.

I followed the recipe except that I substitued one tablespoon of the mayonnaise with the gourmet kind that contains wasabi and horseradish because my husband likes spicier food.  It added an excellent flavor for my taste, but after being in the refrigerator for awhile, I couldn't taste it as much.  Next time I'll try two tablespoons of the wasabi/horseradish mayonnaise.  In any case, it's a wonderful recipe, much better than any I've tasted at restaurants. I will make it often.  Thank you for sharing.

I used sweet gherkins instead of dill pickles, but I've had a similar recipe with dill pickles too--and both are very good.  The garlic powder is a critical ingredient.  Adjust mayo to suit your consistency preference.  This is a refreshing and tasty chicken salad.

First time I ever made chicken salad and it was very easy to make and tasty. Dill pickles were a great touch. I did add more mayo and thought there was a bit too much celery in it though.

This was a good chicken salad base recipe but I ended up adding a little ranch and sugar to help with the flavor...Also, it was a bit too much onion for us.

Chunky and really good.  Nice crunch.  We tried it with healthy brown buns, which were kinda small.  Next time try it with bigger buns :)  Good recipe!

I liked this recipe very much.  The garlic powder gives it a lot of flavor and it's a recipe that's easy to adjust to taste.  I didn't have any dill pickles on hand so I used some sweet pickle relish instead and it turned out great.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Terrific and easy, although, I did substitute scallions for the chopped onion (since I'm not real big on raw onion) and lemon pepper for the garlic powder.

so I doubled everything and found that I needed about 9T of mayo, rather than the 6 that doubling would have called for. I also added more garlic powder (twice what doubling would have called for). It needed something extra so I added 3/4 diced green pepper. Might try a yellow or red pepper next time, but overall, good.

This is the best chicken salad recipe! It's easy and has the perfect amount of seasoning. I went to the grocery store and bought a small rotisserie chicken because I was in a rush, $4.99 and very juicy. It made the best chicken salad with this recipe that lasted for a a couple lunches, dinner and a snack with crackers. Yum!

This recipe is alright but there is WAY too much celery. If you just cannot get enough celery in your life, then this recipe is perfect for you. If you are not as huge a fan, cut the celery in half.

I love this recipe and use canned chicken most of the time. I add about 1/3 cup craisons and that takes away the blandness but doesn't make it too fruity. It's a good change of pace sandwich!

This was so simple and super good. I baked the chicken and refrigerated it overnight. The only change I made was to add a little crumbled bacon and some chopped pecans for garnish. So yummy. Thanks for the great recipe!

First DH and both boys (2.5 and 4 year old) liked this...always a HUGE plus.  Since I didn't make this exactly, I didn't feel right giving it 5 stars.  This is definitely a great starting point.  I didn't have the right amount of chicken, so I used the ingredients mention in the recipe, but just not the exact quantity. I didn't have dill pickles, so I used dill relish.  Worked out just fine.  Also, DH and I couldn't figure out what was wrong with the flavor until I added the salt and pepper.  Not sure why, but that made a huge difference.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Added to the list!

I love this recipe... I have been making this for years...As far as adding sweet pickles, no way! Some of us only like sugar in our desserts. But to each his own.... Thanks for the post.

Fantastic!!!! I have never made chicken salad before, but as a first timer this was amazing. I picked the chicken off of a whole chicken that I cooked in the crock pot, (About 2 cups of shredded chicken), added about 1/2 cup low fat mayo, 3 stalks celery, 1/2 large onion, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, 1/4 tsp. garlic pepper seasoning, and 3 TBSP sweet pickle relish. Mixed it up and it was sooooooooooooooo GOOD! Try this one you will not be dissapointed!

I made this for my husband and boys for lunch today.  I finely chopped all the ingredients before mixing in the mayo. (more than the recipe called for)  I only used 1 piece of celery and 1 pickle spear.  I also didn't have any onion in the house so I used onion powder instead.  My husband said it tasted like a pickle and mayo sandwich.  My 2 year old (tomorrow!!) only took two bites but he's not a pickle fan.  However my 4 year old loved it, which is why I gave it 3 stars.    I will probably make this again just omitting the pickle.  Thank you for sharing, Angel.

I have mixed feelings about this recipe..my husband really loved it! I didn't mind it so much. My suggestion to those who are going to make this, DON'T use Miracle Whip! Use real mayo, i think because i used Miracle Whip and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours, something bad happened to the miracle whip. Other than that it had nice texture and flavour,  i'd make it again, except with REAL mayonnaise!!

This was good.  Your best bet is to cook and chop the chicken then add stuff according to your tastes.  I thought it was good, my wife thought it needed more chicken, so I think it depends on who's eating it.

My family and I loved it.  I'm a seventeen year old, and it was a nice quick thing to make that was healthy enough for my parents.  I used about 1 and a half tablespoons of mayo and added cashews- YUM! Someone else mentioned grapes, so I added those too and everyone in my family commented on the nice sweetness the grapes added.  It went well in a mildly toasted pita. Loved it, will do it again!

This is a good basic recipe. I'd definitely increase the mayo, and maybe use scallions instead of regular onion. Then it's just like my local deli chicken salad that sells in droves for $8 a pound.

I am addicted to chicken salad but don't like the grapes or dried cranberries that a lot of recipes call for. Omitting them leaves the salad bland and lacking. This recipe was fantastic! The garlic and especially the PICKLES really took it up a few notches. Half an onion and 2 whole stalks of celery seemed like a lot but it was perfect. I did add some chopped nuts because I like the texture but it was totally the pickles that made the dish. Excellent! Hubby asked me to make it all the time.

You definitely need to use more mayo than this recipe calls for. I also used sweet relish instead of pickles. This was an okay chicken salad recipe. I would use it as a base recipe and add your own chopped fruits or nuts of choice.

This turned out fine with a nice flavor but it wasn't anything special. We might do it again if we were low on time but it wasn't something we'd look forward to. It would be fun to tweak it, though, so you should try it.

A little too onion-y.  I would have only given the recipe three stars but I shared this with my co-workers and they raved over it.  I will probably make this again but only use a fourth of the onion that it calls for.

WOW! What an amazing recipe! I made it exactly like the recipe called for, although I used left over roast chicken instead of chicken breast. It tasted amazing! I was very impressed, and will certainly make this recipe over and over again.

This recipe was so easy!  I made this for a baby shower and served it on croissants with romaine lettuce - was a HUGE hit.  I adjusted the recipe for 14 people and then did the onion and pickles to taste - it called for 3-1/2 onions - YIKES!  I baked the chicken breast with poultry seasoning, garlic salt and pepper then shredded and chopped a little.  Instead of using garlic powder I used the claussen dill pickles that have garlic in them.  I will definitely make this again.

by itself I'm sure this was great, but since my pregnancy hormones are everywhere and I was craving some roasted red bell peppers and a little spice I modified a bit. I boiled the chicken with roasted red bell peppers, the ends of one celery, garlic powder, pepper and sea salt. For the salad I pureed one big roasted bell pepper strip and 3 cloves of garlic with pepper and italian seasoning. In the bowl I mixed the puree, 1 celery stalk chopped finely, 1 tsp of sweet relish, 1 dill sandwich stacker chopped finely, 1/2 of a red onion chopped, and about 3 tbsp of mayo, I stuck in the freezer for about 20 min to chill it and then served it on croissants with tomato and avocados, it was delicious. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe without it I wasn't sure where to start but with it I made something great and something that I will have to keep making bc the baby loved it.

I have made tuna salads since I was a child and I used this recipe along with some additives to compliment this in similarity to the tuna. I didn't measure my ingredients out. It's more by taste. I added in some mustard to give the flavor some kick, and some egg whites for some more texture. I also substituted yellow, sweet onion in place of the red onion, and scaled back on the celery and pickles.  They sure do want a lot of green in this salad. Overall, I'm glad to have used this recipe for a base to the outcome. I always make extras to store in the fridge for a quick lunch sandwich. It's delicious and I will be making more in the future. Thanks Angel!!

I don't believe in writing a review of someone else's recipe and changing everything about it! Post a new recipe! Anyway, this was a GREAT! I used a rotisserie chicken I got from my grocery store and it was AMAZING! First time I ever made chicken salad so thank you for this recipe!

This is a great recipe with a few changes. I used both dill pickles as well as the small amount of sweet pickle relish, did not add the celery(personal preference) and definitely needed extra mayo, I didnt measure, I just added until I had the consistency I was looking for. I also added extra garlic powder. Yummm! The whole family loved it! Thank Angel!

Most people could Not have rated this recipe based in its "as written" form.  As written, this was not good IMO.  Not enough mayo, too much celery and the dill pickles over powered everything else. Will not make again.

This was a good basic chicken salad. I didn't use a measuring T for the mayo I used a big table spoon, but not like heaping, so I had enough mayo but it was bordering on the dry side. The celery I had on hand wasn't crisp so I used celery seed instead (1/4 tsp of each) and onion powder since I don't like the real stuff. This was decent and aside from being too pickley I thought it was okay. Maybe next time I'll try sweet relish and less of it or pimento instead? I didn't care for the dill/chicken combo, but it wasn't bad, just not my preference. Thanks for sharing, this is a great base recipe!

Loved it! Didn't change anything except adding a little more mayo. It was fine w/ 3 Tbs, but I like mine a bit creamier than some might. Very, very good. Thanks!

Good recipe.  Some tweaks I made and enjoyed were the following:
-good sized chunks of chicken
-Used 2 tbs dill pickle relish instead of getting whole pickles
-I'm an onion fan, but used only 1/2 of a smaller onion
-Sprinkled only some garlic powder & pepper
-Used no salt

I also ate it with white bread, which didn't affect the enjoyment.

Very good. I used store bought roasted chicken and chopped dill hamburger slices since that is what I had on had. Used less salt since the chicken had enough seasoning. Great on hard french rolls!

Really good recipe but needs some tweaking IMHO.  I used less celery & it was still too crunchy for my taste so nest time I so will try using 1 rib per breast next time.  Also the amount of onion is WAY WAY too much (& I love onion).  The salad tasted great but  the onion left such an overpowering aftertaste I think I will try to 1/2 the amount next time. The garlic is a key ingredient.  All in all this is a really good recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a pretty good chicken salad mix.  I get that it is supposed to be savory rather than sweet like some chicken salads, but I do think I would have enjoyed it more with sweet pickles rather than dill.  I'll probably make again with sweet pickles and Miracle Whip rather than mayo.

This is a fairly standard base for chicken salad but it needs customization for your own tastes. We add finely diced Fuji apple and walnuts and occasionally halved grapes to it to add crunch and a sweet note. Occasionally we replace half the mayo with Miracle Whip.

Turns out great. Obviously you can adjust based on flavor you like. I added a little more mayo and garlic powder.

Absolutely delicious!  I used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  I left out the pickles and added a bit more mayonnaise.  I will definitely make this again.

Love this very forgiving recipe.  
Since the high mercury level in tuna has now prohibited tuna sandwiches, this sandwich recipe is my favorite on toasted whole wheat.
As I said, very forgiving.  You start with this and vary the amount of the ingredients to suit yourself.
I prefer the sweetness of Miracle Whip to mayo, I also like to use sweet relish and prefer the 'salad cube' type pickle relish as it is the larger bits of pickle without having to mince it myself.  One can even add fruit and nuts if that's the way you are feeling this week.

I hadn't had a good chicken salad sandwich in awhile, so I tried this recipe! It hit the spot!! I, too, added a tbsp or so of mayo to it, and the consistency is good!

This chicken salad recipe is good with dill pickle relish, fresh garlic, chopped grapes and pecans, and Old Bay seasoning in place of salt and pepper. I used rotisserie chicken, and used the rest to make chicken stock.

Just what I was looking for! Simple ingredients, nothing too fancy. I used chicken breasts that I boiled the day before, and didn't add any onion to the mixture. This was delicious!

Delicious recipe!  However I did make some modifications.  I used a sweet onion, no pickles, added some tomatoes, and used a little bit of dried basil.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

This was a delicious recipe with a few additions. I cubed the chicken prior to cooking it. Seasoned with about 2 tbs of Lemon Pepper, Poultry seasoning and black pepper (i love seasonings) then chopped it added about 5 tbs of mayo (bit more creamy) used a purple onion and zesty dill pickles with some paprika for a beautiful color scheme and DECLICIOUS result :) thank you for sharing your recipe

I made this with left over chicken breast from dinner and it was delicious!  I followed the recipe as written except for just a little less onion and I added a few raisins for a little sweet surprise here and there.  Everybody loved it, and I will definitely make this again.  Thanks Angel for sharing!

Great recipe.  Perhaps the reviewer who had to modify recipe by using sweet relish used Miracle Whip instead of mayonaise.

My husband asked me what he was eating.  I didn't say at first, finally -- after he was done, I told him chicken salad.  "No Way."  He doesn't like chicken salad.  Ü  He said, "Keep that recipe -- it's the best I've ever had."  Praise GOD!  I'm so glad -- it's easy with left over chicken in the fridge.

I think this is an awesome recipe! I made it for the first time yesterday and it came out great. I made some changes... I added small apple chunks, used chicken breast tenders, and basically added all the ingredients to my taste (just threw everything in slowly and added more/less as I saw fit), I only used one dill pickle (because I know they have a suck strong taste), and probably less onion and celery than the recipe called for and I was very happy with it. I also used Light Miracle Whip for the mayo, which gave a kind of zesty taste and put it on toasted wheat bread with lettuce. The end result, I feel, was still missing that special something that really makes it pop, but overall... great recipe! Very basic and I think anyone would like it, you can't really go wrong. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe to start with and easy to tweak to one's own tastes if needed.  The amount of mayo is just right to hold all the ingredients together.

Absolutely delicious! My husband and I LOVED it! I did mine with 4 thin-sliced,skinless, boneless chicken breasts since that's what I had on hand and swapped diced red bell pepper for the celery; also, I found the onion slightly overpowering so I will use a bit less (like 1/4 onion) next time. I sort of just 'eyeballed' the mayo (I used light Hellman's mayo) and kept adding it till the chicken was slightly creamy but not drenched. I scooped it on toasted multigrain bread and it was hearty and filling! A definite lunchtime or quick dinner staple @ my house from now on!

I used canned chicken for ease and added a chopped apple. I also used dill pickle relish. Had a very good flavor. I usually make Carols chicken salad from this sit but this is an excellent stand in when we just want something different.

This was very yummy and easy to make. Most recipes I've seen for chicken salad use relish, and I'm not a big relish fan...so when I saw pickles in this recipe I was very eager to try it! I used a can of chicken breast, some green onion, one chopped dill pickle, 2 celery stalks, real mayo (just kept adding until it looked right), then seasoned with pepper and a little poultry seasoning. I'm very glad I didn't add any salt, because the pickle and poultry seasoning made it just salty enough. Next time I will add a chopped boiled egg also.

I did use sweet pickle relish cause I didn't have any dill pickles but other than that followed it exactly. It tastes great right now and I've put it in the fridge for the next couple hours and expect it to taste even better.

This was very good with a modification.  I doubled the chicken, onion and mayo, plus an extra tablespoon of mayo for more creaminess, also added a touch of pickle juice to mayo.

I scaled this down for one person (me)
and used a leftover thigh from KFC, minus the skin. 

Only thing I did different was add pepper. Everything else was left the same. I thought it had a little too much mayo, but that might have been because I didn't use a chicken breast. Other than that, I liked the added crunch from the other ingredients. It was quick to put together and used all ingredients that I usually have on hand.

Good basic recipe.  I think it needed some oomph.  I added more salt and after adding the dill pickles I added some pickle relish for some zing.  Just a personal preference.

This was good. I changed the portions a little though. I used half the amount of pickle and celery. I was craving chicken salad and this hit the spot. thanks

This recipe was great on croissants. We served it at a baby shower. We didn't add the full amount of dill pickles. We only added half of what the recipe called for. Delicious!

I just made this for my hubby. He loved it! I did use a little less onion because I know his tastes, but this is a great recipe. By the way, a great addition is some cherry or grape tomatoes if you like. Thanks for the recipe Angel.

This was good, definitely something you can tweek to adjust to your own taste.  I actually used some canned chicken breast, added some cilantro, bread and butter pickles- which I chopped up pretty well, and used two tablespoons of light mayo and one regular so it would taste some what normal.  Nothing too out of the ordinary and extra special, but with the add of some personal touches it definitely can be.
