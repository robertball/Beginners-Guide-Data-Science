Loved the recipe, as did most of the guests.Had read in some reviews that it came out a little bland, so I added the garlic only when I blended the vegetables and the kasha/bulgur mix to keep a stronger flavour and I used dry mushroom soup mix instead of plain salt  in step 3.Very nice!

This is great! Even my meat-loving husband loved it - and that's saying something. The only criticism is that it is a teensy bit bland - it could use some spice of some type or another. But this will definitely be going on our repeat list.

My meat and potatoes husband loved this shepherd's pie.  I cooked the veggies in a large cast iron skillet then mixed in the kasha mixture and spread the potatoes over it all.  The skillet went right in the oven and left less dishes for me to clean.  I'll add more vegetables next time, but otherwise this recipe is a keeper!

This is one of my favorite recipes, although it does take a long time to prepare. Well worth the effort. This appeared in The Vegetarian Planet cookbook.

This was edible, but don't think I will make again.  To be fair I used rice milk as I try to avoid animal products.  Can't imagine that one thing would make it much different though.  It was better with "Punk rock chickpea gravy" from Vegan with a vengence cookbook.

Yikes! I made this and it tasted A.) like i was biting into soft buckwheat and B.) bland. i tried to add more spices or salt, but everything i tried to add was not helpful. In the end, we fed it to the chickens. They liked it.

Promising recipe but definitely on the bland side. I added in more veggies -- celery and a red bell pepper -- and some indian spices, nutritional yeast, and veggie bullion with the milk. It needed even more, maybe some thyme or sage to give it more of a savory flavor? Also I think the kasha was unnecessary and I might just use all bulguhr in the future.

It was good. It turned out to be a little more labor intensive than I had planned on and we ended up having to cook it quite a bit longer than the recipe suggested. If I were to make this again I would definitely take some suggestions on how to spice it up, it was kinda bland though very filling.

My boyfriend and I are meat eaters and I'm trying to give us more vegetarian meals so I was hopeful about this recipe. We did not like it at all, so much that we didn't eat it and threw it all in our compost bin.  I'm not sure if it was the kasha or bulgur (I think kasha) that has the odd taste but that's what put me off. If you've had kasha and like the taste/smell, then you may like this.  But it just wasn't for us.  And the grains were all mushy so the overall texture of the dish was bad to me.  This may be a good option for existing vegetarians or those who like kasha/bulgur already but don't think this is a dish you can serve to unsuspecting meat eaters and have them enjoy it.  It may be true for some but it was gross to us.

Lentils or soy sausage added to the veggie mixture was nice.

There were some doubters in the house.  We wanted to have an all-vegetarian week, and picked this out.  It was great!  Everyone loved it.  It did take a bit of time, but not too bad really.  Only thing to watch out for is that it makes A LOT.  It took about three tries for us (2 adults, 1 kid) to finish it all.  Have a salad with it.

delicious!   Have made this twice now and while it was good the first time, the key for me was to season the bulgar and kasha a lot and cook it in vegetable broth with garlic and onion.  I had ever cooked with either of them so it was a fun and yummy experience.  I also added celery.  It was a hit with my family and pretty hearty.  It is veeery time consuming, I will only make it on the weekends from now on.

Finally a Shepherd's pie to replace the sadly missed meat version!  My 2 kids (12 & 4) gobbled it up, and my husband had a sore belly he ate so much!  I added some veggie stock with the flour and put a bottle of alfredo sauce in combination with rice milk to make the 1 1/2-2 cups of milk.  I also used 1 cup of bulgur wheat cooked in 2 cups of water on low for 15 minutes instead of using the two different kinds of wheat.  Thanks for an awesome recipe, this will be one of our regulars!
