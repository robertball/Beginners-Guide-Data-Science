Wow. Just wow. Don't add anything. Don't subtract anything. Don't change anything. This is silky, chocolate bliss to perfection, and there is nothing any reviewer, in my opinion, could suggest that could improve upon this. WHY would I ever buy store bought again, with all it's fake additives and preservatives, when I can have fresh, homemade, perfect hot fudge in a couple of minutes with ingredients already on my pantry shelf?  This stuff needs nothing--not even ice cream.

I've tried other hot fudge sauce recipes but this one was the only one that had that thick, fudgy consistency that a good hot fudge sauce is supposed to have. The only thing is that I doubled the recipe and next time, I'll use 6 unsweetened chocolate and two milk chocolate or sweetened milk chocolate. If you like a sweet dark chocolate taste, you will love this. All in all, it was a 5-star recipe for ease, texture and taste. I'm happy because bottled fudge sauce can be expensive and this homemade version makes a good batch for less $$...and best of all, it tastes delicious! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Very good!! I had to cut the recipe in half because I did not have enough bakers chocolate, but it was still amazing!! My husband ate it up and he usually is not a big fan of hot fudge!! I would not change a thing!

Woah. This is great. I'm glad I re-read the recipe - I thought it was 4 squares of unsweetened chocolate - glad I caught it's SEMISWEET! Although it could stand to be a little less sweet. I might try with bittersweet chocolate next time. But there WILL be a next time! Yowza!

Truly a "fudge" sauce -- stays nice and thick on top of ice cream and cake.  I used Bakers Reserve Dark Bittersweet Chocolate!  I cut the recipe in half because I knew it would be good and I knew I would eat it all.  I did!

Great hot fudge sauce!  I was looking for something without granulated sugar dissolved into it, because that type of hot fudge often gets grainy.  This one was perfectly smooth and really easy!  I'll definitely be making this a lot.

This was the first time I have tried making hot fudge sauce (rather than using store bought).  I followed the recipe to a T, except for I used the microwave to melt everything (used the Medium setting and stirred after every minute, it didn't take long.  It was very good!  It didn't taste like Dairy Queen, which is what I was looking for, but it was still good enough to eat with a spoon on it's own.  Thanks for sharing!

All I can say is I will never buy the stuff in a jar EVER AGAIN!  This is amazing and tastes just like what you get at an ice cream shoppe.  I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate squares which made this heavenly.  We used this for hot fudge sundaes complete with chopped peanuts, whipped cream and cherries.

This is great as written but I prefer to use six squares of bittersweet chocolate.    Also, do not cook too long, that is what makes it gummy when it hits your ice cream.  I like to remove it from the heat before the chocolate is all the way melted, just keep stirring and it will melt but it won't cook too much this way.

WOW! So good! It's perfect and SO simple to make. The only problem I had was, where I live, I only find 11oz cans, so I used 1&1/2 cans.  I used 2/3 cup chips instead of ounces and in the microwave at 80% power for less than 2 minutes. My chocoholic daughter ate this like soup.
The only change I would make for next time is DOUBLE it!!

I think this is the most delicious (and easiest) fudge sauce I've ever made. I used low-fat condensed milk and a combo of bittersweet and semisweet chocolate chips, because I did not have baking squares. While it was still warm, we spooned it over Blue Bell Vanilla Bean ice cream and topped it with toasted pecans and were in heaven!

Actually, I would rate this a 4-1/2 if possible. It just misses getting 5 stars from me because the flavor, while good, isn't blow-your-mind fabulous. Whereas I used good chocolate, the sweetened condensed milk contributes its own, unmistakable taste and over-the-top sweetness. We prefer something that doesn't have a tendency to induce diabetic coma! That's why I never buy commercially prepared hot fudge, which is so sweet as to be nauseating. I have a recipe that has a far superior flavor, which uses Dutch cocoa. That said, the texture of this is silken and creamy, the color is coal-dark and when it makes contact with something cold, it becomes properly thick and fudgy. Try serving refrigerated strawberries for dipping if you're looking for an elegant but very easy dessert. That's the other virtue of this recipe. By storing just a couple ingredients, you're always just minutes away from a taste treat. Even if like most people you don't use butter often, consider keeping a stick, cut in quarters (a quarter stick is what you need to make this,) in your freezer. In order to remedy the excessive sweetness, the next time I make this, I will use 1 or 2 oz unsweetened chocolate in place of an equal measure of semisweet, which should make it more palatable for us. Will report the results when I do.

Is it so bad for a pregnant woman to eat hot fudge sauce....by itself? (cause that's what I was doing) So delicious, and super easy. It barely took any longer to make than heating up a jar of the store bought stuff.  I didn't have semisweet chocolate squares, but fyi,  2/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips is the same thing.

Great recipe!  I was all set to make some hot fudge using evaporated milk, but realized I was out.  I did have sweetened condensed milk on hand, however, so I looked up a recipe using that and found this recipe!  I used fat free condensed milk, and omitted the salt, because I used salted butter.  This was soo easy to make and sooo good, I think I almost made myself sick eating so much of this last night with vanilla bean ice cream!  Yum!  In fact I think I have to go get a spoonful from the fridge right now.  This one's a keeper!

Sadly, I didn't like this one.  First, I recommend melting the chocolate first and then slowly incorporating it in with the milk.  I never could get mine smooth.  Second, it just wasn't fudgey enough.  It was just a really sweet sauce with light chocolate flavor.  I'm glad I bought Hershey's Hot Fudge sauce at the store as a back-up plan.

I just made this recipe.  It was so good I scraped the pot so I didn't miss one drop!  Homemade is always so much better tasting and fresher than a bottle that has sit on a store shelf for who knows how long!!

I didn't have any squares of semi-sweet chocolate squares on hand, all I had was unsweetened and bittersweet.  I read online that 3 tablespoons of semi-sweet chocolate chips equals one ounce square of semi-sweet.  So I used the semi-sweet chocolate chips that I had on hand and it was still an outstanding recipe.

It made one pint jar full of hot fudge sauce.  I know that it will not last long!  I plan to use it as a topping on a peanut butter pie tomorrow then what is left in the jar will be used on vanilla ice cream or hot fudge brownies later.  

This was very quick and easy to make; I like it better than the bottled sauce sold in stores.  In fact, the last bottled well known hot fudge sauce that I bought in a store, once I got it home and opened the jar, it was molded on top and it was not expired yet!  So at least by making this sauce homemade, I know for certain when it was made and how fresh it is!!

This was a good sauce, but not as fudgey as I like.  Next time I will use unsweetened chocolate instead of semi-sweet.  Also, mine never did get smooth.  Next time I will melt the chocolate first and then incorporate the milk.

This sauce is pure heaven! It's thick, creamy, rich in flavor and it takes me only 10 minutes to whip up! The taste and consistency resembles that of Sander's hot fudge (minus the corn syrup)- which is a real treat for me because you just can't find their chocolate outside of Michigan. Thank you so much for sharing! It's not very often I come across a recipe in which I feel absolutely nothing should be tweaked!

really delicious!!!  made it as written, except I used a 4 oz. bar of Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate, as I had one in the pantry.  I think it worked out WELL as far as balance, since condensed milk is so sweet on it's own. tasted like a great homemade fudge sauce, but I think next time I'm going to experiment with adding things (coffee, dark rum) to take it over the top! great recipe!!

Excellent hot fudge sauce.  I didn't have the squares of chocolate so I followed the reccommendation on the Hershey's Cocoa can and used the equivalent for 4 squares.  I used lower fat sweetened condensed milk but used real butter.  Yummm.. and the vanilla at the end sent it over the top!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe, it's so easy yet so delicious.

Don't know why I waited so long to make my own hot fudge sauce.  Mere mortal words cannot describe how delightful and delectable this is -- easy to make, too!  Honestly, I thought it would require a lot of fuss or usage of a candy thermometer (which is my culinary Lex Luthor).  Now I know differently.... Too bad, really... now I'm gonna need stretchy pants.

Easily 5 stars. I used unsweetened chocolate and I added about 2 TBSP strong cold coffee at the end, to thin it out and add that rich flavor that coffee brings to chocolate. Fantastic! EDIT: You should use this the same day you make it. It thickens a LOT in the refrigerator. I may get around this next time by adding additional butter to thin it out in the first step, but I can't recommend that without having done so already.

This recipe is just amazing.  For months I've been trying to duplicate the fudge served at my favorite ice cream parlor. Now I've found it. This fudge taste the same, but the texture is even better.  I serve this on top of HDazs cherry vanilla ice cream/vanilla, melted fluff, whipped cream and a cherry on top.

This was sinfully delicious!  Very creamy and smooth with a nice consistency.  I do think I will follow Alesiagirl's lead and use fat-free sweetened condensed milk the next time I make it to cut down on the fat.

Thank you, Priscilla, for sharing this with us!

This didn't really me as happy as it did other people.  I thought it was a bit too sweet.  Bottom line, it lacked a depth of flavor that a great hot fudge sauce should have -- not bad, but not great from my household. Guess I'll have to keep searching!

I had such a craving for this sauce. I had to use chocolate chips because I didn't have the semisweet chocolate squares and it came out great.

I'm giving this a good SOLID 5 stars.....make as directed "IF" you like sweet.  I used a 4oz. Ghiradelli unsweetened chocolate bar and it's PERFECT!  Not to dark or to sweet.  To make it "darker" just add some instant expresso powder and that will darken the flavor up.  But, however you like your sauce this is THE BASE recipe.  Many thank you's for posting this!  It's a keeper.  **thank you to the reviewer who suggested turning of off early and just letting the chocolate melt** GREAT TIP**

Very quick to put together and had all the ingredients on hand, but it was not what I was looking for in a fudge sauce. The flavor was not as rich as I wanted, and I would have preferred a thicker consistency. Will work if you are in a pinch.

Far to sweet for my taste. I used 70% cacao and this was still too sweet. The consistency was good, though, so I might consider making it again with unsweetened chocolate.

Consistency was great and it was so easy to make. It was a little too sweet for my tastes, so next time I will use bittersweet chocolate instead.

Very simple to make and simply delicious!  I subbed a heaping 1/2 cup of bittersweet chocolate chips instead of the semisweet squares, but otherwise followed exactly.  We loved it and will not be buying store bought sauce anymore!!!  Thanks for an awesome and decadent recipe!  So yummy!

I really wanted to like this... it's super easy and based off ingredients I always have on hand, but it really lacked a depth of flavor that I was hoping for. Perhaps I'll try one more time, using dark chocolate and maybe a shot of liquor... but as written, I was disappointed.

My husband says this tastes like heaven. I like it best with dark chocolate, he likes it best with milk. It is amazing with every chocolate that we've tired. Giving it as Christmas gifts this year with a half teaspoon of peppermint extract.

A rich, thick, delicious hot fudge sauce! Mmmm! Sweet and chocolaty, it's a perfect topping for ice cream, mud pie, or brownies a la mode. I tripled the recipe and filled five jelly jars for gifts. Gets as thick as fudge when cold, so reheat gently before spooning.

My daughter and her husband were over for dinner.  For dessert, she brought brownies, I had ice cream, but no chocolate sauce.  Looked for a recipe and found this one.  I had all the incredients, so we made it and was very impressed! I could just eat it off the spoon! Reheats well in the microwave. Great Recipe! Thanks!

Oh my this was exactly what I was looking for!  Very very fudgy!  If you are looking for the type of fudge that is almost "chewy" when you put it on your ice cream, this is it!  It tasted exactly like the hot fudge at DQ!

This is quick/easy, has a very good flavor, and reheats well.  Unfortunately, my sauce came out slightly grainy instead of perfectly smooth.  This may have to do with the fact that I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of baking chocolate.

I love this recipe for its ease. After preparing it as directed, I thought it was a bit sweet and cloying, so I added 1 tablespoon of cocoa and a pinch of salt. If you use salted butter, that may be enough salt for some people, but I like a salty edge in my desserts. With these two simple additions, you can't beat this recipe for its combination of flavor, texture, and ease of preparation. No need to buy hot fudge sauce again.

I plan to sub the choc with 5T cocoa + increase butter to 3T... I prefer the darkness of cocoa. I also skip the vanilla and add a 1/2 shot of coffee or liquer to accentuate the chocolate taste. A pinch of salt is a must.

This is a really good sauce. It doesn't quite seem like any hot fudge I've had before, but it's still very good. I used it on top of the Double Chocolate Brownie cake recipe from this site along with vanilla ice cream. I was trying to recreate a local restaurant's Hot Fudge cake and it actually turned out pretty good...not quite the same, but still good. I recommend this recipe as it is very easy to prepare.

This is so sweet yet very good tasting. It tasted like a melted piece of fudge. I usually make the hot fudge or dessert recipes from the scratch recipes with cream, butter, etc. This one was so quick for a change. I don't care for sweetened condensed milk but it worked in this. The only downside is it kind of slides right off the ice cream and down to the bottom of the bowl. Although, it is very tasty so I can handle that.

Wish I could give it more stars! Absolutely amazing. I only has unsweetened chocolate so I added 6 tbsp of corn syrup to make it into semisweet. Worked perfectly. Comes together quickly and I have a feeling it won't last long.

Super simple, and much better than store bought.  I made a chocolate cake with strawberry ice cream in the middle and just poured this over the top to serve.

This turned out awesome! All I had was unsweetened chocolate squares, so I added 1/2 cup brown sugar into the milk and chocolate. I also added a pinch or two of salt... it just added that extra touch. So good, so quick, and so easy! =)

Fast, easy, but a bit too sweet. Didn't have that dark, rich, fudgy quality until - I added about 2 TBLSP of unsweetened cocoa powder. Became like a delightful rich, sticky ganache! Makes about 2 cups.

I decided 5 minutes ago that I needed a hot fudge Sunday, but my kids are in bed and the Man is at work.  What to do, what to do? Make this recipe.  That's what to do. I used a half bag of chocolate chips b/c that is what I had it turned out perfectly. Okay, I gotta go eat the sauce with a bit of ice cream now.

This hot fudge sauce is easier and faster to make then going to the corner store to buy.  And it tastes so much better and doesn't have all the artificial fillers.  Just be sure to keep these few ingredients on hand.  I personally think the semisweet chocolate is a little too sweet and will experiment with a dark chocolate next time I make this...  which will be real soon judging from the fact I can't stop eating it with a spoon from the fridge!

I absolutely did not have the correct ingredients (i.e., I had to use half a bag of Hershey's kisses leftover from November - it's now July) and this still came out just fine in a pinch for what I needed.  No one else knew the difference.  I look forward to making it another time with the correct ingredients - maybe for Christmas gifts.

A good starting recipe that needs tweaking. It has a good taste if you use good chocolate, but it was definitely too thick. I think next time I will add a little more chocolate or cocoa powder and like 1/3 -1/2 cup (or more) whole milk to thin it and get away from the condensed milk flavor. But I like that using the condensed milk doesn't make it grainy or make the sugars crystalize the next day.

I just finished making this and it is delicious!  I promised my daughter she could have a hot fudge sundae after dinner tonight, so I decided to try this recipe.  Fantastic!  It took all of 3 minutes to make.  I'll never buy the premade hot fudge sauce again!!

Very delicious! I made minor changes: 1 squares unsweetened, 2 squares semi-sweet, and because I love dark chocolate, added 1 tablespoon dark cocoa powder. YUM! Thanks!

This was a great recipe that I used to top a friend's birthday cheesecake the other day. The only change I would make is to not wait until the chocolate is completely melted next time, or maybe chop the squares up to melt faster. I think it sat on the burner too long. The flavor was intensely rich and dark, and everyone at the party loved it!!

I made it exactly like the recipe called for.  I made a cake mix divided it in two & put into two 9"x13" cake pans.  Baked for 25 minutes.  When cooled I put on this Hot Fudge recipe and then poured over melted vanilla ice cream and put it in the freezer and it made two 9"x13" birthday cakes for my son.  EXCELLENT!!  Much cheaper than store boughten!!

Reasons to love this recipe:  It's easy, it's made with ingredients you probably already have on hand, it's quick, and it is delicious!  Thanks for a winner!  My family lapped it up on vanilla ice cream and we will definitely be making it again.  I did substitute semi-sweet chocolate chips for the chocolate and it worked perfectly!

I made this to use in chocolate fuge frosting.  It's very good.  It's an excellent alternative to store bought fudge sauce.  Thanks Priscilla:)

Way too thick and kind of jelly-like consistency. Also had problems with it being lumpy. Use a recipe with evaporated milk instead.

This is a o.k. version but worth the effort to make the real thing!  Use the hot fudge from the recipe Buster Bar Dessert by rochele99 for the real thing!!

Oh my goodness. Chocolate heaven. I had never made hot fudge sauce before, this came out perfect. It was a thick sauce, I was able to reheat it in microwave several times as we had a lot left over after making it.

This sauce is really the best I have come across.  Easy, great chocolate flavor, not grainy.  It also clings nicely to ice cream, which is the first sauce I have tried that does that.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is AMAZING!!! The only thing I did differently was use 2/3 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips because I didn't have bark on hand.  It is creamy & delicious.  I'll never buy fudge sauce from the store again. THANK YOU FOR SHARING!!!! W.O.N.D.E.R.F.U.L!!!!!

This is excellent.  I used a Ghirardelli seme-sweet bar (4oz) and it was rich and thick.  I might try bittersweet next time to compare.  It is sweet but hot fudge sauce is supposed to be! This one is a keeper.

Delicious!  My husband and Mom rave over the flavor of this sauce over vanilla ice cream.  I used the fat free sweetened condensed milk and cannot imagine anything better.  Also, it goes a long way - still have some in the frig.

I thought the sauce was just okay, but gave it a 5 star rating so not to skew the overall score since I did not use high quality chocolate.  I used 2/3 cup Toll House semisweet chips (which I normally think taste pretty good) and Nestle Condensed milk.  I tasted the sauce and there was hardly any chocolate flavor at all.  I kept adding more and more chips, about 3/4 of a bag and still wasn't pleased with the level of "chocolately" flavor.  All I could taste was the condensed milk.  

I don't think I would try a condensed milk based sauce again. Not sure if a higher quality chocolate would have been any better.  I prefer store bought Fran's for sure.

On the plus side, it had a nice smooth consistency, but unfortunately, this sauce was much too sweet. Used bittersweet chocolate and still too sweet due to the sweetened condensed milk. Also, it did not have a strong chocolate flavor. Will not make again.

Wow. I had everything but the butter on hand, so went out and bought a pound of unsalted. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this. Should go great as "pizza" sauce" on the giant cookie pizza I'm making my husband for father's day.

I used Ghiradelli semisweet 60% chocolate.  SO good!  I doubled the recipe and stored it in a large mason jar.  I'm thinking about making this in pint jars for teacher Christmas gifts!  I used about 3T of sauce and stirred it into a cup of hot milk.  Incredible hot chocolate!

Absolute best hot fudge sause and could not be easier to make.  It is thick just like your favorite ice cream shop and no funny after taste like the kind that you buy in the jar.  I have made many, many hot fudge recipes, this is by far the best.

Sooooper simple!! In less than 5 minutes, I was topping ice cream with hot fudge, amazing! I had exactly 6 oz of choco chips, so I used that and also added 2 TBL of cocoa powder to cut the sweetness a bit. Excellent!

The flavor is great, but the sauce cools very quickly and becomes difficult to serve. Even keeping it on the stove on low heat requires constant stirring. Maybe that's just the nature of fudge sauce.

Fabulous sauce!!! Make sure it doesn't cook for too long because it get's too thick really fast.  The second time we had this (out of the fridge) I added some water to it & that helped the consistency.  The flavor was very very good!! Thanks for the recipe!!! :)

I added another 3 oz semisweet chocolate chips (total 7 oz) and it was perfect.  Couldn't  believe how easy this was.  Yum!  Had to print out the recipe for our guests.

The yummiest hot fudge I've ever tasted. Perfect as is and much better than any stuff from a bottle. The only trouble I had was my family fighting over who got to lick the pot...LOL

This recipe is excellent.  I used store brand sweetened cond. milk.  Very good on it's own, but I liked even better with  approx 1 teaspoon cocoa.

Delicious and tasty!!  The sauce is nice and thick like a hot fudge sauce should be!  However, ... when putting the sauce on ice cream, it immediately thickened up into globs and dripped off the ice cream.  Still good, but not nearly as appetizing to look at or easy to bite with the cream.

Easy peezy.  My 10 year old put this together herself, with minimal stove/can opener help from me.  And it was great!  Rich, creamy, smooth.  It's exactly what I was hoping, based on the reviews.  The recipe photo doesn't do it justice - it's really quite thick.   I think I will also try this with dark chocolate and bittersweet, just to see what kind of variations I can get.  I really didn't expect anything fantastical from 4 simple ingredients...but sometimes being wrong tastes goooood.

MMM...velvety, chocolaty hot fudge sauce. What more can you ask for? It really is a bit thick but it is so good! I stored it in the refrigerator and it hardened up. It was easy to scoop out some though and I microwaved it for a few seconds to get back the sauce consistency. Worked perfectly! Thanks for sharing.

Not at all like what I think hot fudge sauce should taste like--I had just been to an ice cream shop and had the most amazing hot fudge sundae and wanted to try to recreate it, but this was not it.  The consistency was gloppy; I had to add milk to make it smoother, and even then, once it had cooled slightly it just wasn't right.  And it didn't taste very chocolately, either.  I will be trying a different recipe next time.

Yummy!  Made this for a summer barbecue. I made the Quick and Easy Brownie recipe from this site and the fudge sauce.  It was a breeze to make.  My teen son was thrilled.  The brownies with vanilla ice cream and this fudge sauce was a perfect ending (and my son's favorite!).  I plan on making this many, many times.  It will make great gifts.  Thank you for this great recipe.

This hot fudge is only as good as the chocolate you put into it. I used store-brand semi-sweet chocolate chips (2/3 c.) as other reviewers suggested. To me, it just tasted like the chocolate chips, which weren't that great. The consistency is right-on but I was disappointed in the taste. Next time I'll try again using very expensive, dark chocolate.

I agree.  This sauce has the perfect consistency. I ended up with a little graininess, but a stick blender smoothed it right out.  A keeper.

OMG!! This fudge sauce is perfect.   I used 3 sq unsweetened chocolate and 1 sq German sweet chocolate only because that's what was in the cupboard.  This recipe will now replace my old favorite of 20+ years...easier, faster, gooder (as my grandaughter would say).  Thanks!

Absolutely fantastic. Hard to believe something this easy is so delicious. I used the microwave for 1 min at 50%, stirred and repeated. I also used 2/3c chips and it was not grainy at all but, from previous experience with chocolate, I made sure not a drop of water or condensation got into the chocolate.  I don't know the chemistry behind it but that can cause a grainy texture.

This is absolutely wonderful.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the baker's chocolate and it turned out smooth, creamy, & chocolatey.  What a great treat and it was so easy to make.

Oh, so super yummy, and really, really quick and easy to make!! The thickness and consistency is perfect...not too thick and not too thin. Will never buy store bought hot fudge sauce again!  This would make a great little gift for teachers, neighbors, etc...pour it in a Mason jar, put a pretty ribbon around the lid...but be sure to make a double batch so you can keep one for yourself! So good!

This was super good and so easy!!  I don't think I'll buy hot fudge sauce anymore.  This is way better than Hershey's and it's almost and good as Sanders (for any other Michigan people who know about it). YUM!!!

I made a delicious hot fudge sauce from this site before and couldn't remember which recipe it was.  So I tried this because I had all the ingredients.  While it wasn't near as perfect as the one I was looking for, this was pretty good.  I used unsweetened chocolate and it was the just the right sweetness.  I have this four stars because if I use semisweet as the recipe calls for it would have been too sweet.  Also, the texture is smooth but it's thick even when warm, not a sauce you could drizzle from a spoon.  But, yum!

I LOVE this recipe!!! My local ice cream shop keeps running out of fudge and now I have the prefect replacement.  I even use fat free sweetened condensed milk and sugar free ice cream so I don't feel as guilty.  It kinda tastes like a darker version of McDonald's hot fudge sundae sauce but way better because I know what's inside of it.

WOW!!  This was so good that I was finiding ways to eat it even after we ran out of ice cream.  I even put it on bread. I got a funny look from my husband when I did that and I just told him that it was like American Nutella. He wasn't impressed but that's becacuse he never tasted how amazing this very perfect hot fudge sauce is!!!!!! -- WAY too good to be this easy to make!

I LOVE this sauce!  I made it as is and thought it was perfect . . . loads of creamy clean flavor.  I made it a second time and added a touch of coffee crystals and loved the mocha flavor.  Great job!

This is an amazing sauce!! I made sundaes for my kids and they ate them like they were the best thing they had ever eaten!  I had some sauce left over that I warmed the next day and we used as a fondue sauce for strawberries which was equally amazing!

WOW!!!! So glad I gave this a second chance!! I misread the recipe first go round and only used 1 square of bakers chocolate. It was not impressive so I went back and read the reviews again - they were too good for the sauce that I made. Ooops 3 ounces of chocolate makes a HUGE difference :)  Round 2 met the reviews! Absolutely LOVED IT after I let it cool completely in the refrigerator.

All I can say is I will NEVER buy hot fudge again!!!!!  I used bittersweet chocolate vs. the semisweet so it wasn't overly sweet when served over brownie ala mode.  The family loved it!

This was pretty good. I didn't have any semi-sweet squares so I used semi-sweet chocolate chips. Tasted sort of like a liquified brownie. lol. It did get gummy on my ice cream tho. I heated it before serving on vanilla ice cream. Also made the butterscotch topping from this site and paired it w/this recipe and made sundaes. YUM

Very simple and quick.  I did add 11/2 teaspoons of cocoa powder to add a little more chocolate and cut back the sweetness.  Since I added the cocoa powder after tasting the initial recipe, I did have to whisk to get the texture smooth again.  My hubby suggested adding the cocoa, so it was too sweet for a guy, also.

I was apprehensive about the sweetened condensed milk, as it seems to always overpower with it's own flavor, but I couldn't tell it was in this sauce.  The consistency was excellent and the taste was very good. And the fact that it came together in less than 5 minutes...an extra star for that alone!

When I suddenly discovered that I was out of Hot Fudge sauce, I decided to try this one.  It is yummy and easy to make, even though I ended up substituting cocoa for half of the chocolate squares. Thank you!

Absolutely fantastic, easy and fast!!  I used 3 squares semi sweet and 1 square unsweetened and it was just right in terms of sweetness.

So simple, so easy, so good. The picture doesn't do it justice -- it is a very velvety, pleasantly thick sauce.

Very good. Not what I consider to be the "true" hot fudge sauce at ice cream shops, but still very good. I was a touch sweet for me on its own, but I putit on my ghiradelli dark chocolate  brownies (and topped mine with mini reese pieces. it was the best I think I ever had as far as brownies go)...amazing. I did add a little bit of dark chocolate chips to the mix to give it a richer flavor. I'll make it again for my brownies.

Simple, easy, and very very good! This turned out fudgy and thick and so fast. I even forgot the vanilla and its still great. Next time I'll put in the vanilla and I believe this is the basic easy hot fudge recipe that I can experiment with. I suppose you could add an extract of another flavor and it would be awesome if you like that sort of thing. Also- I think any 4 oz's of chocolate will do. I had to improvise. I had two squares of unsweetened baker's chocolate and so I also added about the equivalent of two more squares of chocolate (I had nestle's swirled white/dark choc chips). I figured that added the bit of sweetness that the unsweetened squares lacked. I love this easy recipe. I'm printing it off to tape onto the inside of one of my cabinets. That's where I tape a select few good, basic recipes that I use.

How could this recipe receive less than 5 stars!? It's great when something is incredible tasting and so, so easy. My family was licking the spatula, the pot, even scraping up the drops that dripped on the counter! Don't change a thing, just make this recipe and enjoy!

No changes needed!  This is the BEST hot fudge recipe I have ever tried.  Wonderful smooth consistency! We tried this using white chocolate and adding peppermint extract.  It was FAB!

I will never buy hot fudge sauce again!  This was excellent!  I used this for banana splits, also used the strawberry syrup from allrecipes and together they made a fabulous banana split! Thanks for sharing such a great and easy recipe for hot fudge.

I'm not completely convinced by this recipe. I liked it - it was nice on my cake and good on my ice-cream - but it wasn't really fudgey. As a self-certified fudge addict I was expecting something that tasted like the real thing. It just tastes like sweetened chocolate to me - but it was nice nonethless.

I needed a recipe that would use up half a can of sweetened condensed milk, so I halved this recipes and tried it out.  The sauce is delicious.  I used a combination of 60% cacao chocolate squares and some semisweet chocolate chips to get a good chocolate flavor without it ending up too sweet.  I will definitely make this sauce again!

Excellent recipe, but it is quite sweet.  I made a little accidental discovery though.  When I was reheating it another time to put on ice cream, I left it in way too long.  While putting it on top of my ice cream wasn't possible, it was good by itself, almost cake-y.

Wow, I wouldn't have believed such an easy recipe would be so good.  Hubby accidentally bought chocolate syrup instead of fudge for a recipe, so this was a lifesaver!  Really good, will definitely make again.  I might try bittersweet because I like dark chocolate, but still, I thought this had a great balance for milk and dark chocolate lovers.  Nice and thick too!

Excellent and easy, the key is to use quality chocolate.  We love this at our home, it beats store bought sauce hands down!
