I love the dressing - so simple and delicious!  I didn't have raspberry vinegar, used red wine vinegar instead.  I changed the ingredients of the salad a little:  I used mixed baby greens with spinach, red onion, sliced almonds, crumbled blue cheese and raspberries.  Perfect!

This is a great recipe with a dressing that's too much, and too sweet, for my taste. I dropped back the oil to 2 tbsp., the vinegar to 1 tbsp., and the jam to 1 tsp. I also added a pinch of salt. Then I used about half of the dressing and tossed well. For my taste, the changes were just right. My husband says "it's a keeper."

What an AMAZING salad! The raspberries and almonds perfectly complement each other, and the dressing was so good I made an entire bottle. My husband never eats fruit on his salads, and he really enjoyed the raspberries and kiwi. The only thing I changed was I used field greens instead of spinach.

I really liked this salad, however, I dont think the onion is necessary.

A nice combination of flavors!  I left out the onion (too many people are picky about onions) and croutons (didn't have any), and I used half raspberries and half blueberries.  I also used mixed baby greens instead of all spinach.  Next time I would be a little more cautious about dumping all the dressing into the bowl at once -- I hadn't measure the greens and it was really more dressing than I normally like.  Nice flavor, though, and no one else complained.  This is definitely a keeper during berry season!

Not bad. We tried it with fresh peaches instead of kiwis since that's what we had. The whole family liked it! Will be making this again!

So Awesome. Followed the directions exactly and even family members that claim not to like salads, went back for seconds, thirds and fourths! The dressing was a perfect complement.

This is the BEST salad ever!  I did omit the onion however. I brought the salad to a potluck and it was loved by everyone.

This salad was pretty good. I just made it for an easy dinner for myself. The kiwi paired realy nice with the tartness of the rasberries. I used sugar free jam, olive oil and apple cider vinegar because that's what I  had on hand. I added a generous tablespoon of blue cheese and used walnuts in place of almonds. I will make this again on a hot summer day before I go to the pool for a light, refreshing lunch.

I served this to friends who believe salad should have a viniagrette made of mustard, oil, and red wine vinegar. I was nervous about it but they went nuts! They were scared of the sweeter elements in the salad but they ended up requesting the recipe!

I have to agree with other reviewers that this salad is just fantastic! It's healthy and beautiful with a wonderful blend of flavors and textures, plus it was a good excuse to add a new vinegar to my collection. The only downside is that fresh raspberries are pricey here in FL, unless you hit a good sale during the summer.

Very tasty, and healthy!  We didn't have kiwi, so I added strawberry instead.  Also, used red wine vinegar instead of rasberry vinegar.  The mix of flavors was delicious, but my wife and I both thought it could use a bit more variety of flavors -- maybe some feta.  Good recipe!

Awesome, and so easy!  I used 4 kiwis instead of 3, and omitted the croutons (just didn't think they went).  I didn't have raspberry jam, so I substituted strawberry jam - wonderful!  Note that the raspberries 'bleed' on the kiwi and almonds after a day, so be prepared to eat it the first day.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a hit at our BBQ this weekend. The vinaigrette was just right on sweetness, while tossing in fresh raspberries adding that hit of colour that made everyone go for seconds.  Awesome!

Amazing summer meal! I used jicama rather than croutons because a box of croutons would just stale in my cupboard. Totally wonderful... I ate a huge salad bowl of it and felt totally satisfied, but not full. Thanks to this recipe poster!

I just made this salad for this afternoons bbq and it's wonderful!  I love the dressing and we did not pour on the entire salad, just used as much we each wanted, which worked out well.  I'll be using this dressing for all of my salads!

I'm not a big fan of people that change up a recipe, and then give it a low review because it didn't meet their expectations. That being said, the ONLY change I made in this was to use spring greens rather than spinach, because it's what I had on hand. FANTASTIC! Yes, the dressing is sweet but I didn't feel it was too sweet by any means - I did use sugar free jam, so I'm not sure if that made a difference at all. I don't feel that the kiwi is a necessity, I didn't notice it much in this. I saw someone else said the onion was not needed - I would beg to differ, it added a lot. This is a keeper!

WOW! is the first word that comes to mind.  We added extra almonds and croutons (didn't actually measure - just dumped) and it was the first salad gone at the potluck.
