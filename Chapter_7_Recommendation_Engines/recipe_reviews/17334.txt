Having read the previous comments about the watery batter, I doubled the flour to 1 C and baking powder to 1 t and the salt to 1 t. I also omit the teaspoon of oil. 
They turned out perfectly - light and crispy. The kids loved them dipped in Ranch dressing. Thanks for all the helpful comments and an original recipe with so much potential!

I am not normally a broccoli person, but this recipe turned me.  I tried this as a recipe for my husband who loves broccoli and cheese, in return i found and easy and quick recipe that every one loves. One thing to keep in mind is that this recipe uses a lot of oil so make sure you have adaquete room to drain. I used a cooking cooling rack. Places napkins on the rack and below and served on a plate with multi colored napkins to brighten up a bit green and yellow do the trick :)      Michelle

This was a very good recipe for the experienced cook. You do have to work with the batter to get it just right. Cutting back on the liquid, adding more cheese. But once you have it it is great. It is worth the effort for a different appetizer. Don't cook too long and have you oil hot hot hot. Best if eaten immediately.  Leftovers tend to be greasy.

Overall this is a good recipe. However, I thought the batter was too runny. I thickened it with more flour. I dipped the broccoli in the batter and also dredged the broccoli in a dry corn muffin mix to give it some texture and flavor and it turned out great.

This was tasty. I did add less milk and increased the cheese and flour a little. That helped keep it together. Nice recipe for a change of pace or a party.

This has been a favorite for us, anything that can get my 2 year old to eat broccoli! It took a couple of trys to get the batter right, but it was worth it.

These were pretty good. My batter didn't seem to want to stick to the broccoli. I added extra flour which seemed to help. Besides that, everyone loved them.

My guests gobbled them up quickly.  They were very tasty and I was asked for the receipe! When you cook them, I would suggest dropping from a teaspoon; otherwise, they are too big and resemble a potato pancake.

Awesome! The only three things I changed were to increase the flour to 1 cup, the baking powder to 1 tsp. and the salt to 1 tsp. because someone in these reviews suggested it. They came out absolutely perfect and go great with the honey mustard dip. I made them for tonight's New Year's Eve party and I think everyone will like them. The only problem is stopping myself from sneaking them while my boyfriend is in the shower. I've got to save them for the party!!

I took the advice of some other reviewers and added less milk and extra flour so that I could ball them. After balling, I rolled some of them in bread crumbs to see if they would be crispier or whatever; both with and without bread crumbs are good. I also mixed cauliflour with the broccoli too. The mixture definitely needs spices added to it or you get rather bland tasting balls. I added some salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder. A little ground mustard was yummy too. I also used Pepper Jack cheese to give them a little kick.

Thanks for allof the suggestions! I guessed on how much flour to use after I mized the broccoli, cheese and milk mixture together. I also made my rolls with wet hands so they would not stick to me...then I rolled them in dried bread crumbs. VERY YUMMY!

A really tasty recipe which we made for Fat Tuesday dinner.  My mom didn't like that the batter was so runny, though, and she ended up just pouring the whole thing in the pan and dividing it up as she turned it over.  In any case, it was delicious, especially with the sauce.

I wanted to follow this recipe as is but something just seemed wrong to me.  I wanted cheese bites like they serve in a restaurant.  I had this runny oozy mixture (probabaly because I also used thawed, previously frozen florets).  i did not see how the ooze would become a bite.   So I tweaked. Add more cheese, I added some pepper jack because it melts well.   Add more flour until you can ball these up.  Roll them into little logs, dip in beaten egg, then cover in seasoned bread crumbs, then deep fry.  I tried them with and without breading and the breaded ones were superior.  I gave the recipe four stars for a good start.

I found, like many others, that the mixture was too watery and I had to add to it to make it all stick together. Otherwise they were lovely and I will be making them again - with a little more cheese as well.

Guests at my house always like this recipe.  I like to add some crumbled bacon or bacon bits to the broccoli and cheddar mixture for a different taste!

I myself am not a big fan of broccoli...but this recipe sure got me into eating it! I suffer from low iron intake, and my doctor was definitely pleased when she found out that I was eating more green vegetables. We didn't have cheddar cheese on hand, so I grated up half a block of marble, and they still turned out well! Thank you for sharing, Kristen!

These are awesome! I made these for my friends and our kids as an appetizer and everyone gobbled them up, even the kids! I did add extra flour (about 1/4 C.) to thicken the batter a bit more and used a teaspoon to drop them into the oil. I will definately make these again!

These have the potential to be very good. I gave it 3 stars for the good flavor, but that is the extent of it. They fell apart when they hit the oil. I guess I should of used more flour for the batter. I don't think I will make these again because they turned out to be too much trouble.

We tried these twice and neither time were they all that great. Once in a skillet and once in a deep fryer. Coating just didn't seem to stick well to broccoli.  I think cauliflower would work better.

I prepared this as an appetizer for our Thanksgiving dinner.  They were a big hit! I changed the recipe according to HOMERMC's suggestion, but did not use all of the mix. Simply coat lightly and deep fry. They were perfect.  (A little salt was added also.)

We decided at the last minute to make these  - we had all the ingredients on hand!!  They were DELICIOUS!!!  We did however need to add some bread crumbs because the mixture was a little soupy.  This is a keeper!

I quadrupled this recipe for a large crowd watching football and served with other "finger" foods.  First drop in the pot of oil, batter was too funny and it completely separated.  So, I added some more seasoned flour until I thought the consistency was right, and they turned out great!  Served with Ranch Dressing and the Honey Mustard suggested here and a great hit!

So tasty!!  I followed a suggestion and used only a 1/2 cup of milk.  The batter was still a bit runny but it held up, next time I'll probably up the flour as well. Unfortunately, mine were not nearly as nice looking as the ones pictured. Will definitely make again!

Great.  Made these for our game night group and they were a big hit.

Following others' suggetions, flour, salt and baking powder were all doubled.  We made 2 batches, one with broccoli and one with cauliflower.  The latter was my favorite.

I love the Broccoli Bites from Bennigan's, and I was hoping this recipe would replicate them, but I was disappointed.  Perhaps it's because I baked mine instead of frying, but they were very doughy and not at all like the ones from the restaurant. I think if you go into it *not* expecting it to copy the restaurant, they are ok.

Pardon the pun, but I thought it sounded pretty cheezy at first, but it was easy to make and my husband and kids RAVED about them!!!!!  (I HATE broccoli, and even I thought that they were really good!!!)  I cook them on a griddle in a lot less oil and told the kids that they were broccoli pancakes.  Guest love them too and I've been asked for the recipe over and over.

Very, VERY good.  But I also thickened the batter and baked instead of fried.

It took a little longer than I thought, but it was really worth it - they're yummy.  But, my mixture was a bit watery...I added about a cup of bisquick to get it the right texture.  My 7 year old loved them!

I made this for a birthday party and it was a hit.  My father couldn't stop eating them.  I really enjoyed them dipped in sour cream.  One comment from everyone is they needed more salt.

Very good. I did have the same problem with it being a bit runny, so just added about a 1/4 cup bread crumbs. Came out perfect. Thanks!

i did as another suggested & doubled the flour, salt & baking powder. i'm personally not fond of greasy food, so i couldn't eat very many of these. my 21 month child on the other hand, LOVED them! he tried the honey mustard, but mainly used ranch dressing. we have a lot of broccoli ready all at once from our garden right now, so we're eating it at about every meal. thanks for the interesting idea to switch the menu up a bit!

These were good and I'll make them again.  Instead of chopping them, I just fried individual pieces of broccoli.  I also ended up having to use a lot more oil, even though I have a small deep fryer.

I tried to make this even though I had no way of telling exactly which temperature I was frying it at. I fried it on the stovetop. It must not have been hot enough because they came out too gooey. They were still tasty with the honey sauce. But I was very disappointed because there wasnt any way for me to tell how hot the oil was. Is there some special tool that I could use next time? Because anyway I can get my family to eat brocolli would be great.

This was an experiment from the start. We weren't sure how this was supposed to turn out, so it was fun to try them. They were tasty and it was a nice change from steamed or raw broccoli. I'd recommend serving them hot though... when they chilled they were a little oily, but hot, they were great!

I ate several that a friend of mine had prepared today.  I told her that these broccoli bites were absolutely delicious and that I had to have the recipe.  She told me where to find it and here I am.  Can't wait to make some and to share recipes.

I had high hopes for this but the batter did not stick to the broccoli and it ended up mushy and greasy.  Since it is not a healthy type dish I think it would be better to go all out and deep fry.

Awesome!!! I doubled the dry ingredients as other reviewers suggested, and added more cheese, as well as some shredded asiago cheese. They were a huge hit at Thanksgiving! Perfect as an appetizer served with ranch dressing as a dipping sauce.

My husband and I love these - we were sooo tired of the same old broccolli with garlic and lemon.  My 2 year old lvoes it too - but my 3 year doesn't like them so much.  What a great way to serve as an appetizer!

Very disappointed.  Not what I expected. Thought bites would be round but batter spreads in the oil more like a small pancake with broccoli. In order for all the batter to cook the "pancake" has to continue cooking until the outside is nearly burnt.

I really liked this! Instead of frying it in the oil to reduce the fat some I baked it at 375 degrees in the oven for 30 minutes. It then had the consistency of a thicker omelette but was very very yummi! I will make this again many times!

Easy to put together except that when I spooned the mix into the hot oil to fry it did not hold together. It was to liquid.  What a mess!  Plus the 1/2 cup of oil was not enough to fry in.  It stuck to the bottom and didn't fry on top. Also, one could not taste the cheese even w/o the sauce.

I served this recipe at a progressive dinner, the appetizer course.  It was a major hit.  I did find I had to add considerably more flour than it called for.  The ones I fried with the original amount fell apart.  Everyone wanted the recipe.

These were good, but they sure didn't look like the ones at restaurants.  They did have a good flavor.  I also added some mayonaise to the dipping sauce to tone it down and make it creamier.

After reading recipe and reviews decided to make waffles. Added onion, garlic and sriracha for a little more flavor. After first waffles added about 2 tablespoons flour a teaspoon of baking powder and a little more olive oil so they were puffier and easier to remove from waffle iron.  Recipe would have been fine as is.  Will make again

I followed the directions exactly, but my mixture was way too soupy.  Didn't know what else to do so I added bread crumbs to give it the consistency to stay together. Once fried, they were delicious.

I wish I had read the comments before I made these. Mine were also runny and did not hold together well. When dropped into the oil. I also had to add more oil for frying. The taste is good

Great! Based on other comments, I doubled the flour, baking powder & salt. Also added garlic powder. Family loved them! Husband suggested using zucchini or ham next time. Quick & easy!

Maybe if the measurements were corrected, it would be ok.  1/2 C. oil for frying?  Are they supposed to be deep fried? Or just browned in a frypan? Mine were very loose, messy, not worth the effort.

My kids adore broccoli and they really didn't care for this.  Think I will stick to steaming it w/some butter.  Batter didn't really stick and really oily.

These were good, but I'm glad I followed other reviews and used 1 cup of flour instead of 1/2 cup.  I can't imagine the batter being any more watery.  Although, I did use frozen broccoli. You can also use self-rising and omit the salt and baking powder.

listened to everyone with the recipe. added less moisture and more flour. to me they are light, and definatly not greasy, but are way too bready.
gotta add more cheese and broccoli to offset the increase of drieds.

This was good, not great but good.  I too modified the recipe according to other's suggestions after making the recipe as written and seeing how runny the mixture was.  However, when doubling the flour and baking soda, it would've helped to add more cheese, too, as I felt that flavor was lost.  I would also add something else to spice it up a bit, they were sort of bland.  I did like the honey mustard sauce with it though.

like someone said before, these definitely have the potential to be good, however the batter wouldn't stick so we were basically just eating broccoli. The sauce was a bit too sweet as well so I had to add a lot more mustard. I like the idea of these so I think I'll try making them again but add more flour.

A good start but these seem to be lacking some flavor.  I did double the cheese and used one cup of flour as suggested by another reviewer.  Next time I will try adding some seasonings for more flavor--maybe some garlic or onion.  I loved the honey mustard dip and I also made a dip with one half fat free sour cream and one half low fat ranch which was just as tasty! (some of the party-goers didn't like mustard)!

My husband loved these I thought they were ok. For me I thought you couldn't taste the cheese and I used mature cheddar. The sauce was great though. Think I might make these again because husband liked them so much. Thanks.

THESE ARE THE BEST! I MADE THEM TO TAKE TO A GATHERING AND THEY DISAPPEARED RIGHT AWAY AND THEY WANTED MORE. I DID ADD I CUP OF FLOUR AND A BIT MORE SALT. VERY EASY TO MAKE.

This mixture was extremely thin.  I didn't want to add more flour just in case, though, because I was afraid to mess up the recipe.  It didn't hold together and the whole thing ended up not great, but the people I served them to said they tasted good anyway.  I am sure the person who submitted the recipe knew a lot more about what she was doing than I did!

The mixture was so watery and it was hard to fry them, I didn't quite like the honey mustard sauce but overall the taste was okay.
