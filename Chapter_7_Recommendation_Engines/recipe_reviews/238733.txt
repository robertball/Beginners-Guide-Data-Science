I used to buy this years ago in a Middle Eastern Grocery store and this tastes just like it! I made it exactly as written using eggplants from my garden and HOLY MOLY this is AWESOME! NO CHANGES NEEDED! We little a little kick to it so I added in some Turkish ground red pepper! Loved it! I served it on little crostini's with Ricotta cheese since that's all I had however this is MUCH BETTER served with goat cheese! Yummmmm
