Awesome cookies!  I like to try my best and make the recipes the first time exactly like they are written but I had a hard time finding dark chocolate chips.  I substituted the left over 2 ozs of bittersweet chocolate from the 4oz bar, chopping it into 1/2 inch pieces.  I used good chocolate, fresh ground black pepper and opened a new jar of cayenne.  I baked them on parchment at 350 for 12 minutes, cooled on the pan for 5 minutes and transferred to the rack.  I had a "warm" cookie and one that had set a couple of hours.  I preferred the one which sat as the flavor was much better.  Oh and it was so good with a cup of espresso.  Thank you so much for the recipe!  BTW this is my first review after trying many, many recipes.  They were that good!

I made this recipe just as Chef John said to, right down to the grinding of the black pepper.  But it was that pepper that made me rate this a 4 rather than a 5.  We thought 1/2 teaspoon of the black pepper was just a little too much, and for that ingredient in a cookie, that is more important than if this were a main dish of some sort.  I would suggest trying only 1/4 teaspoon.  I loved how the cookies retained their shape and how wonderfully chocolatey they are.  I baked them on parchment for 11 minutes and that was perfect---just a little underdone in the middle.  It was hard to find the currants, but Sprouts had them!  I got about 30 cookies with a 2-tablespoon scoop.  I'll definitely make these again with my adjustment.  Thanks, Chef!

I was fascinated by this combination even though I have tried other similar recipes. I followed this exactly, except for omitting the currants in one half. For my taste, I found the amount of cayenne pepper too overpowering against the very strong taste of the chocolate. I also preferred the batch without the currants. The video presentation was most helpful, but I wished I had watched it first because I beat the eggs and sugar until thick and it made the cookies 
too puffy. In the video version,chef John just blended everything with  a whisk. Further, the currant mixture as well as the chocolate 
can both be done in the microwave, making this a very easy and quick recipe.

Awesome cookie! Very rich and decadent with complex flavor. I made a few changes- used cranberries instead of currants, 2 tbsp very strong coffee instead of kahlua, halved the black pepper, doubled the cinnamon and used 3/4 tsp freshly ground dried chilis instead of cayenne. I also topped each cookie with a small chunk of candied chili pepper before baking. Will make them again!

OMG - These cookies are WONDERFUL!  I've pinned them on Pinterest, posted them on Facebook and am giving out batches in my annual cookie offerings.  I've rated them "PG-13" because small humans may not appreciate the way these wonderful cookies bite back, but I promise it's just a little nip - just enough to let you know there's some pepper in there somewhere.  I followed the recipe exactly and they all came out perfectly.  The hardest part was making them uniform in size and shape, but I was more than happy to eat the "misshapen" cookies ... I'll be make another batch before the 2012 holiday season is over!  YUMMMMM!

Excellent recipe. A crowd pleaser. Currants are hard to find in our area, so I used dried cranberries which add a little hint of tartness to the cookies.

The cookies are fabulous. Not inexpensive, but fabulous. I don't substitute ingredients in a recipe, so what you see is what you get. Did I say fabulous? Fabulous.

I tried this recipe but without the Kahlua because I can't take alcohol. The recipe was good but it was too much chocolate for my taste.  I would add 1 cup walnuts instead of more chocolate chips.  Other than that, I thought it was really good. I love the pepper and the cayene pepper in it.

Now THIS is chocolaty ! Loved the "2 steps" expansion of the taste in mouth : 1st the chocolate and when you think it's all over then the pepper araises to tickle your senses - actually a kind of sexy cookies indeed ! ;-)
 Skipped the coffee flavour when making them again and liked them even better (that's why only 4 stars).

Made these and expected "cloud-nine"..but I think mine were too dry, could be that my oven is hotter, I'll drop the baking time by 2 minutes and i think I'll love them more.  The flavour of the pepper with the sweet currants was so nice though!!

Yum!  My only deviation from the recipe was cookie size, ending up with 3 dozen, baked for 10 minutes.  They came out perfect.  We all loved the bit of bite the pepper gave.  It wasn't too strong, but you knew there was something special going on.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Huge hit with everyone who didn't specifically say they hate spicy food. A few very sensitive souls said they didn't like the heat, but everyone else loved them. Such a great combination of flavors.
I didn't find "dark chocolate chips" but semi-sweet worked fine.

The cookies came out fudgey, soft, and delicious. They were about the texture of a brownie and the chocolate chips and currants were nice. After taking a bite, it takes a second for the subtle spicy flavor to kick in, it's a nice surprise.

DECADENT. If you love dark chocolate, these are for you. The only chocolate I used was a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips (11.5 oz, divided). It worked out superbly, in my opinion. (I didn't have a stainless steel bowl so I melted, slowly, in a glass bowl in the microwave.) I didn't have currants so I used dried cranberries, and I didn't have Kahlua so I made a small batch of homemade; it wasn't authentic, but it was DELICIOUS, and boy did it enhance these cookies. (I had a little rum I'd bought for Chef John's pineapple upside cake, and Wikipedia says Kahlua is made with rum not vodka.) The pepper gives you a little surprise only after you've had a few bites. I recommend eating these the next day--after you've given your mouth time to recover from licking the bowl! (Or maybe resist licking the bowl.) I'm sending these to my daughter at college who loves chocolate chili candy bars. PS. The recipe is on this site twice. The other one says to whisk the eggs and sugar in a separate large bowl. This one says to use a small bowl. USE THE LARGE BOWL. The other one also says to use room temperature eggs. I did that. No idea if it matters. (Now I'm off to make more recipes with that homemade Kahlua!)

This recipe was very unique! When I first made them and the cookies were warm I was not too impressed, but after they cooled off and the next day YUM!! They were amazing! I think next time I make them I will try adding another 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper per recipe. I made a double batch and that was a good amount to bring into work and to keep some home, so if you plan to bake them to share I would recommend a double batch. I also did not have regular Kahlua and only had Spiced Cinnamon Kahlua and it worked out great. I will be keeping this recipe for sure!

I've prepared recipes similar to this without the black pepper and really enjoyed the wonderful interplay of the red chile powder and the chocolate; but adding the black pepper really ups the complexity of this cookie, making it extra special!

I made this recipe and followed the directions.  They had a really nice chocolaty flavor but to me, they just aren't chewy enough.  I just didn't get the raves I was expecting.  The recipe was expensive and a lot of work. I wouldn't know how to make a cookie chewier.  Any ideas?

I love Mexican chocolate cake so was eager to try this recipe. It was kind of fun wielding all those saucepans, bowls, measuring utensils, etc. My tiny kitchen counter had not a square inch of space showing when I finished. I started washing up while the first tray was in the oven and when I got all the bowls, etc., cleared away--there was the little prep dish with the baking powder, salt, paper and cayenne. The cookies are great without them but I look forward to trying them again, this time with ALL the ingredients.

I am always on the look out for recipes with dark chocolate, because of a milk allergy in our family    -  I think Kahlua might have milk in it  - think I will try with other liquor   - maybe orange?    I love currants and have not found lately  - will try Sprouts or try cranberries   - thanks!

I don't think anybody knows what a currant is where I live, so just used golden raisins. Haven't used a double boiler since I realised that setting the microwave power down to 70° does just as well.
Of course I did something wrong because my dough was thick, so I've created the new Zippy spice brownie cookie. And good...yes sir.

I enjoyed the dark chocolate taste and although no coffee was added, I felt it tasted like it was. Simple to make and a small enough batch that I can them gone in short order by my family.

These are perfect for the chocoholic! Be sure to watch the video before you make them. Also, despite the pepper, these are not spicy so have no fear! Enjoy!!

They were delicious.  Something a little different from your average chocolate cookie. Keep in mind that they do not spread out much, so whatever scoop you use, flatten and shape them. I made a double batch and got 3 dozen cookies. They won most creative cookie at the exchange! thanks!

loaded down with chocolate.  even though there is sweet chocolate in the recipe there is still a bit of a bitter taste. the amount of  pepper is hardly noticed. you may want to beef up the pepper if you like peppery foods. at our church coffee / snack table these went over very well.

I was looking for something out of the ordinary and am so glad I found this recipe. It's fabulous.  I made them exactly as written. The cookies are so smooth and silky and the currants add a nice bit of texture. As mentioned, the heat isn't really that noticeable, but becomes an interesting lingering note to a wonderful chocolate cookie. I recommend watching the video as it gives you a good overview of what to expect during the process. I will definitely make these again!

Made them as directed except I used craisins in lieu of currants.  Meh.  Glad I had a trial run before taking them to the Cinco de Mayo party. Will not save this recipe but I LOVE YOU, Chef John.

Only change - had no currants so used dried cranberries. These are REALLY good! They were almost more like a fragile brownie in texture than a cookie.The ingredient proportions are perfect for lending subtle heat at the finish. All flavors work together to make for a complex, very chocolatey adult treat and nothing overwhelms.

Oh my....Here is how the first bite goes... a little, slight crisp on the outside...soft and slightly chewy on the inside...then suddenly your whole mouth is full of one of the most chocolatey, almost brownie like, almost truffle like, bites you've ever had... and then your eyes roll back in your head.... and then you close your eyes just so you can shut off that sense so that you can experience the texture and flavor even further...and then just as there are just a few tiny little morsels of happiness left you get teased with a just a tad of the tingly, sensuous heat on the back end. I served them at the end of a Chili Fest and asked if anyone would like cookies to take home... "YES!!! The chocolate ones!!!" was the combined answer! Chef John, please thank your wife for that experience for me. I am making them again soon! These are certainly a Dish of Delish!!!  (From Wish, posting on her husband's page)

Best chocolate cookies ever! Used Craisins instead of currants because that's what I had.  Baked about 10 minutes until cookies were shiny and top was beginning to crack. They were  soft inside and very chocolate-y.  Substituted 4 oz semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the bar. Otherwise, I  followed the recipe exactly. Couldn't taste the pepper but theflavor was rich.  I will definitely make these again!

Made exactly as shown/written and this recipe is a keeper! Made twice in 1 week and everyone loved them. The chocolate, currants, and pepper spices play so well together. Will definitely make more especially with the holidays coming up.  Another winner from Chef John (and wife)!

So delicious. My changes were to double the cayenne. In future, I would probably continue to double the cayenne and reduce the black pepper a little. Fresh out of the oven, the black pepper is the overwhelming flavor. After they've cooled, it isn't quite as strong.

This is my third year in a row baking these cookies! Both my family and my employees are obsessed with them and look forward to me including some with the hundreds of cookies I make each Christmas. I follow the recipe exactly because, honestly, Chef John's recipes are the best.

I’ve made these for a few parties over the years and they are always a hit!  The flavors are wonderful, and the little kick of spice enhances them even more!
