Great recipe, with a few modifications: omit the 1/2 cup of sugar, as the condensed milk makees it plenty sweet enough. Add 1 tsp dry mustard, and 1 TBS paprika. I also added 3 chopped hard-boiled eggs once, and it tasted great!

I made this macaroni salad for my daughter's figure skating competition.  It was served to the coaches and judges.   I have already gotten two requests for the recipe and I haven't even gotten my bowl back!  One parent liked it so much, she took the rest home.  I cannot stress how great this macaroni salad comes out. It is pefect for those occasions where you are requested to bring something, and you just don't know what to bring.  TRY IT!

THE SWEET CREAMY TASTE was such a nice surprise when guests had their first mouthful of this salad! I did the lazy version---used a bag of frozen vegetables that included broccoli, red sweet peppers, sugar pod peas, etc.  Then, I diced up some red onion and added shredded carrots.  So simple ---but so good!  I can't wait to bring it to another "shared dish" event so I can graciously accept all the compliments!

Made 120 servings of this salad for a large picnic - took forever to do all that chopping but it was worth it!  Excellent salad. Someone described it as a cross between macaroni salad and cole slaw - appropriate description. I decreased sugar to a little more than 1/4 c and it was plenty sweet. The dressing was fantastic!
Update: I've made this a number of times since my original post and I've decided you could put this dressing on cardboard and people would eat it! I've yet to have anyone who did not like it.

This was very good big hit at the neighborhood barbque. I did leave out a few things like the carrots and green bell pepper.  Will definately make again.

Awesome.  Just perfect the way it is.  Next time I may leave out the white sugar for a tangier salad.  Just a tip, don't rinse the macaroni with cold water.  Under cook it slightly, drain the cooking liquid and throw the hot noodles in the sauce immediately.  That way, they will absorb more flavour and won't get mushy.

Since this is only the 2nd time I ever made macaroni salad (and being 50+) I knew I had to trust the reviews.  I admit being very skeptical about the sweetened condensed milk, but figured I'd try it, as I always trust the reviews here.  I eliminated the additional sugar altogether, as others said it was fine without it.  Although I liked the "sweet-sour" tartness to it, I wasn't sure about how others would feel. I didn't have the option to let it set overnight to let the flavors blend better, but found it still very good. I used red and yellow bell peppers, celery, hard boiled egg and chopped up some small shrimp; a sprinkle or two of dry mustard and paprika.   My daughter-in-law said she doesn't usually try macaroni salad, but she liked this one. This morning, my husband took leftover salad for his lunch and raved how great it was.  The macaroni absorbed any excess moisture and the flavors melded together beautifully.  HE LOVES IT.  Great compliment coming from a man who's mother was a terrific cook!!!   This has now become a salad I will make for EVERY OCCASION.

This recipe is one of the best I have ever tasted! I have made it four times in two weeks, and everyone loves it. I left out the 1/2 cup of sugar, added two squirts of yellow mustard and about 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. My friend tried the sauce on potato salad and her husband said it was the best he had ever eaten. This is a real keeper. Don't let the can of condensed milk throw you off. I was reluctant to try it, but I'm sure glad that I did.When you first mix it up, you will think that you have put too much sauce in it. Within about two hours, all of the sauce has been absorbed by the pasta. It is much better (if that is possible) the next day!! Each time that I have made it, I've added new ingredients. I have tried frozen green peas (thawed), shredded cheddar cheese,grated/shredded Parmesano Reggiano cheese, bacon bits, dill weed, 4 chopped hard boiled eggs, fresh broccoli flowerets, one can of drained and rinsed black beans...all of it is delicious. The dressing is what makes it so good!!

This is the BEST BEST Macaroni Salad EVER!! The only change I make is that I don't use all the sugar the recipe calls for.  Every time I take this to a gathering, people always ask for the recipe.  My husband asks me to make this frequently and it keeps well.  

A word of caution; my husband asked me to make this using tomatoes and cucumbers.  It tastes good, but breaks down very very quickly and can't be made ahead it has to be made and eaten the same day.

I think you will be fine with this as long as you add the sweetened condensed milk a little at a time and do like grandmothers did, use your personal taste to judge how sweet you want it.  I did omit all of the sugar.  This was great.  Tripled the recipe for a crowd of about 60 people and the bowl was clean at the end of the reception.

I made this recipe today (5/4/13, going to have this with fried Chicken that I'm going to cook once I finish this review. I did not let it set in the refrigerator overnight, but, I had it resting in the freezer, and every hour I took it out to give it a stir so that the flavors can blend together for about 4 hours. I really did not wanted to use a whole can of sweet condensed milk in it, but I did (not knowing what to do with the rest of it).  I also added sweet Pickle Relish to the dish because that is something I was use to having every time I had either macaroni salad or potato salad, also added paprika to the top of the dish. Very good dish, very colorful.

Loved this salad! My husband said it was the best macaroni salad he's ever had. It has an awesome flavor. The only change I would recommend is to exchange peas for the celery. Thanks for the great recipe!

I am not one to review recipes very often but I could not in good conscience not review this one.  People you need to make this recipe.  I did make some changes however I don't feel it changed the overall recipe.  You can make that decision. 1) I used macaroni salad noodles instead of elbow. 2) Replaced green onions for the red. 3) Used yellow & red bell peppers (instead of green & red). 4) I didn't measure out mayo, just spooned but came pretty close to recipe measurements. 5) Omitted sugar all together & used 1/2 can (7 oz.) condensed sweetened milk (husband diabetic). 6) Used several hefty shakes of rice vinegar instead of white. 7) I did add the carrots, celery & salt/pepper per recipe. I made and refrigerated overnight for maximum flavor.  Boy was it flavorful.  I don't usually get excited about or even serve myself this type of salad but this one was just way too good to pass on.  I doubled the recipe for 50 people and happily finished off the little teeny bit that was left.  Do yourself and family a favor and make this.

Excellent recipe! I was afraid that it would be too sweet, but this turned out to be delicious. If the initial impact comes across as a bit to sweet, simply add more salt to bring out the vinegar flavors! I made this for a Fourth of July cookout...but after tasting it, I saved a quarter of it for home! This is the best kind of recipe...simple, easy and delicious!

This recipe was great. I did make some changes. I used a 13oz box of lowcarb elbows and I left out the sugar and used 2tbls of sweetened condenced milk along with 1/4 cup white vinegar and lowfat mayo to taste. This was still plenty sweet and tangy

Only giving it 4 stars because I agree with general reviewers' consenus that it's too sweet with both sugar and sweetened condensed milk.  I like the tangy/sweet combo, espcially with the peppers.  I will definately make this again but next time I'll leave out the sugar.

I didn't have sweet condensed milk on hand and made this anyway.  Instead of 1/2 cup of sugar, I only used 1/3. It was sweet enough as is.  Omitted celery and used lemon cucumbers.  It turn out very good. Prehaps for a more creamier consistancy next time I will add the condensed milk.

This was great! I love that it's not as tangy as other macaroni dressings. I left out the sugar but made it as directed adding sliced olives, yellow bell pepper & peas to it. At first it may seem like a lot of dressing, but allow at least a few hours to chill and the pasta will soak up some of the dressing. It keeps well for a few days after too.

It came ot too soupy and overly sweet. Had to add some mustard to help balance the over sweet taste. Did not include the sugar in the recipe and it was still too sweet.

Really good. I did omit the added sugar because the sweet milk was plenty sweet enough and I also added a cup of water to make it creamy. You could add milk but that's just adding calories and fat. Once the salad cools, it may thicken, I add more water to thin the sauce. This is the only macaroni salad recipe I use. Thanks!

Horrendous.  It was WAY too sweet before I added sugar (I didn't bother).  I should have trusted my instincts just after reading the recipe.  I don't know anyone who eats this way.  It's like something kids would invent; certainly only a kid would eat it.  Do yourself a favor:  read the ingredients and ask yourself--"Why would this be anything but 16 servings of cloying slop?

This is really good.  I did add a couple of eggs and I didn't use the sugar.  Eagle Brand milk has plenty of sugar in it. IMO.  The salad was a nice change from the usual. Wouldn't make it often, but a nice different salad.  BTW, the recipe is huge, I cut in half and still had enough for 8 people with leftovers (and that included a 16 year old boy that eats like a horse).

This was amazing!!  I used 1/2 the sugar, and probably won't use any next time since the condensed milk adds enough sweetness on its own.  My mother-in-law even liked it and said she wanted the recipe!!

Spiderella, this was So good! Worth 10 stars but only 4 for my changes. I only needed a little salad so I halved the recipe, I used chopped black olives instead of the peppers, that was what I had on hand. I like to add sauces to hot pasta so I did not rinse the macaroni ( just drained) and added it to the sauce, this causes the pasta to absorb the dressing. Thank you Spiderella, this is on the top of my mac salad list now!

Excellent. Like other reviewers, I thought it was too much sugar so I left it out completely and ended up adding in a small amount of splenda.  There was a lot of dressing compared to macaroni, so I only used about 2 thirds of it, and once it was all blended I thought it needed a few extra tablespoons of vinegar.  I also added some cubed ham for my husband who's a ham fan.  Very yummy- a keeper recipe for sure.  Next time I might try adding chopped boiled egg for added protein and a flavor twist.

This is good but very sweet, even though I left out the sugar. I added some extra seasonings like garlic powder, salt & pepper, horseradish and a few drops of Louisiana hot sauce. I also added shredded cheddar cheese, a couple hard boiled eggs and I used extra pasta, there's a lot of sauce. I left out the carrots. It's quite good but I prefer the Amish Macaroni Salad recipe on this website.

This is the best macaroni salad I've ever had. I usually like macaroni salad, but always find I can't have too much of it because the mayo is so overpowering. Not in this! It is wonderfully dressed; sweet but still tangy. 

The only thing I omitted was the sugar and that was after I tasted it just before adding the pasta. Like many others I found it perfectly sweet with just the condensed milk. 

I used garden rotini for the color factor. I only needed 3 carrots, personally, but I didn't think they were overly large, I just think four would've been a lot after I shredded them. I only used half of a red onion, but I think I could've used the whole thing and been fine, but I did have some fresh sweet onions from the garden I needed to use up so I had about a 1/4 cup of that. I used red, green, AND orange peppers, again for color. The celery is the only thing I measured, but would probably add an extra half+ cup more of it next time.

I might try olives next time, but I don't care too much for them. Other than that, I think you can use whatever veggies you would like and have no problems. The dressing would probably be good on a regular salad, too, or even a sandwich, it is THAT delicious!!

This recipe is really good with a few provisos.  First and foremost cut the sugar by at least half.  It is way to sweet with a half-cup sugar.  I also use Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise. Next, there is no way you can make this in 30 minutes time.  It takes me several hours at least to chop up all the veggies.  I make up the sauce first, add the veggies as they are chopped up, and then cook, cool, drain, and add the pasta.  I use rotini instead of macaroni.  The sauce sticks to it better.  This is a very tasty salad.  Try it, you will like it.  Just be sure to cut the sugar by at least half.

This was a good recipe!  I like the sweetened condensed milk...it added the flavor I have been missing in my old Macaroni salad recipe.  I rated it 3 stars because I changed some things.  I only used 1/2 can of the sweetened condensed milk and left out the white sugar as it was sweet enough already. I added a bit of onion powder and chopped fish cake.

Oh my!  This is an amazing mac salad recipe.  My husband said it's the best macaroni salad he's ever tasted.  My son loved it as well. Honestly, I was so afraid it was going to be too sweet especially when I sampled some before refridgerating.  It's important that it sets overnight in the fridge.  Just the right amount of sweetness with an extra kick from the onion.  Delicious!!!!

This was too sweet for me- I prefer a tangy mac salad so after making this I tried to salvage it by mixing in 1/4 c vinegar/3 TBSP mustard/ 3/4 tsp Celery Seed. Next time I will make Classic Mac. Salad from this site- also a side note- I only used 1/4 can of sweetened cond. milk- and it was still too sweet!!

I tweaked just a little but yes the best ever and I'm very picky when it comes to mac salads!  I didn't add the veggies, instead added ham and cheese.  Didn't add the sugar and put in a little mustard.  Yummy!  Also received rave reviews from co-workers!

Really great recipe.  I didn't add the sugar because the sweetened milk is enough.  I added a little pickle juice to offset the sweetness, and it came out perfect.  Guests wanted the recipe!

For us this was a 5 star ONLY if you cut out the sugar!!!  When I read all the reviews the majority said that it was way to sweet so I decided to trust them and completely eliminated the sugar.  Even without the sugar I thought this was still a little too sweet so I added a tablespoon of dry mustard.  That did the trick for us - a little heat with the sweetness - I will make this again.  All the vegatables in it was great. - Oh - this makes a lot.  I had cut the recipe in half and there was still ALOT of macaroni salad.

Wonderful salad.  I usually don't rate things I change but I did omit the sugar as suggested by another comment, but it was still a bit sweet.  I added Dijon and more vinegar and after it set overnight it was tremendous!

It's pretty good.  Glad I read the reviews first.  Had a can of condensed milk that needed to be used up, so decided to try it.  Glad that I reduced the sugar to 1/4 c.  It was still plenty sweet.  Made way too much dressing.  I have lots of dressing on this salad and still plenty leftover.  Thought I might need to add more today, but don't.  I think I prefer the Amish Macaroni Salad recipe on this site, better.

Made this for Christmas luncheon at work. Left out the white sugar. I am not a fan of onions so if I make this again, I will leave out the onion too. I will definitely use the sauce mixture again. Just the right combination between sweet and tangy.

This was indescribably good. My whole family enjoyed it. I wouldn't change a thing. I did cut back on the sugar (by half) the last time I prepared this recipe and the reduction in sweetness was not even noticed. This is definitely one of those go-to recipes when you need a side dish that is going to bring rave reviews.

I made this salad for the first time yesterday, and it is wonderful!  I always have trouble getting the dressing right for macaroni salad, and this one was so easy.  I followed the directions completely, no additions or deletions.  I usually put tomatoes and cucumbers in my salad and I could have done that, but even without them, this was great.  Highly recommend!

This was awesome. There wasn't a single bit left. I'm glad I read the reviews, I didn't add the extra sugar as others mentioned and it was perfect. Everyone wanted to know what was in it. My father in law said it was the best macaroni salad he ever tasted. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.

I made this for my partner who loves Amish Macaroni salad that has some sweetness to it and he loved it!   I omitted the sugar and added 3 tblsp of spicy brown mustard and sliced up  1/2 can of black olives...It was perfect.  Im not into sweet salads myself but I thought this one was pretty good.

This salad isn't something ill make again...however it is edible,I left out the sugar and was still way too sweet,maybe use half the can of condensed milk but then what do you do with the other half? I also think way too much mayo!!!!just didn't enjoy eating a fat and calorie filled pasta salad..there's wayyyyyyy better recipes out there then this one.

Made this for a bbq, halved the recipe but shouldn't have.  Everyone loved it.  I always make the recipe exactly the way as written 1st time and then change as I see fit but would not change a thing with this, even adding the sugar.  My mother raved over it and that's saying something.  Thx for recipe!

I used unsweetened evaporated milk 1/4 of a cup and 1/2 tsp of sugar, because I know my own taste.Vinegar also was reduced to a 1tsp.Sometimes you have to use your head when following a new recipe.I kept the bell pepper green,red onion,celery,I also added cup of shredded cheddar cheese.Very good the way I made it.

Amazing! I add diced ham, shredded cheese and a little extra salt to balance the sweetness. It looks like there's too much dressing but after sitting overnight the noodles soak it all in and it is just the right amount.

I followed the recipe as written, and didn't read any reviews prior to making (which is a first).  The salad turned out fantastic.  Definitely makes a difference if it is made the evening before serving.  All the neighbors raved about it.  Will definitely make again.  Good job Mom!!!

Between the sweetened condensed milk and the sugar this recipe is way too sweet.  Macaroni salad is not supposed to taste like candy. 

I used the condensed milk and not the sugar and it was still too sweet.

This is an awesome recipe, but you can cut down on the calories by doing these few steps and it still taste amazing. Use light mayo, only 1 cup, use condensed milk 1/2 the can or less, omit the sugar add raisins or craisins, very delicious!

Love this recipe!  I modified it to what my family likes: took out the bell peppers and replaced with frozen peas.  Also, after reading other reviews, I left out the sugar.  I figured I could add it later if need be.  It is perfect without it!  Highly recommend giving this one a try!  YUMMY!!

I almost passed up on this recipe even with all the good reviews because of the condensed milk addition but I am so glad that I chose to make it.  Like many others, I do not think the sugar is necessary so I left it out.  Upon tasting the salad for the first time, my palate was in shock then came that old familiar desire for another bite and another bite and yet another bite.  It's so good you don't want to stop eating....this takes Macaroni Salad to another level.

I have made this MANY times. However the first time I followed the instructions to a "T" and the result was way to sweet, now when I make it I Omit the 1/2 cup sugar it still has a nice sweetness from the condense milk.

I made a test batch for an upcoming cater event.  I omitted 1/2 the sugar and added black olives.  I will be making this for 250 people this weekend and I'm sure it will be a big hit!  Thank you for the recipe!  Delish!!!

As a vegetarian I am forced to be a connoisseur of side dishes and this one rocks!  It tastes like it's from a great deli.  Based on other reviews I didn't add any sugar and it was perfectly sweet and delicious.   I was scared how it would turn out because I ran out of real mayo so used miracle whip instead.  I think it may have turned out even better because of the tangy-ness of miracle whip.  LOVE IT!!  I will definitely make this for our next pitch-in or bbq instead of buying it.

Surprisingly sweet, even sans the sugar. Even more of a surprise was how much my guests liked it. I will make it again, but will omit the condensed milk and replace it with a bit more mayo, and some whipping cream to see how that goes over.

It was better than I expected, but still a little too sweet for me.  My husband, who is a picky eater, loved it though.  I'd cut the sugar in half if I made it again.  I also didn't add the celery (don't like it) or carrots (didn't have any) but will make sure they're both included next time.

I was looking for a macaroni salad that I could add pineapple to so I made modifications to this one.  I decreased the condensed milk and sugar to half the recipe. Then I added crushed pineapple to taste, shredded cheddar cheese, and a 1/2 chopped jalenpo pepper.  I wanted to add boiled egg, but didn't have any but will do so the next time.  Next time I might spice it up by adding Old Bay Seasoning.

Great recipe with a few modifications for my family's tastes. I omit the peppers, using two cucumbers instead. I cut the sugar in half; it is way too sweet as the recipe calls for. I also add cubed sharp cheddar cheese.

This is simply the best macaroni salad recipe that I know.  I used to buy the pre-made store bought stuff and decided to try to make it on my own.  I had a party at my house with about 60 guests and everyone that tried the macaroni salad wanted the recipe!  The only modification that I made to this recipe is that I used about half of the prescribed amount of sugar.  I have a "handy chopper", so that made the veggie chopping simple and quick!  Thank you for posting this recipe!!!!!!!  Gary Moyer

This was THE BEST!!!  It deserved a full 5 stars in my book. It reminds me of a store brand that is no longer made. It was perfect in every way.  This recipe is a real keeper... many thanks.

After reading all the reviews I too only used 1/3 can of sweetened condensed milk and about 1 tbsp of white sugar.  I also added 1 tbsp of bick's green relish! This recipe is a real keeper! A new favourite! This makes a huge recipe and my family loved it!!! They even would eat it in the fridge late at night for a snack! You will love it!

Too sweet for my taste. My children weren't too excited about it, either. The dressing recipe strongly resembles bottled Marzetti's, so if you are like me and do not like Marzetti's pasta salad dressings due to the level of sweetness, you won't like this.

Very good! My family loved it. My husband doesn't care for pasta salads but he liked this. Said it tasted like coleslaw. So I think the dressing would also be great for coleslaw. I did not add the 1/2 cup of sugar, I think it would have been way too sweet. I also cut back the may to 1 1/2 cups. I only used 2 large carrots and it seemed like plenty. I will be making this again!!

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars! I didn't have macaroni on hand but used spiral.   I used 3 cups mayo instead of the 2 cups as it was alittle too sweet for me.  I also put in 8 oz bag of Kraft cheese crumbles that had different cheese in (I'm sure you can cut small cubes of cheese of your choice in.  I made it a day ahead as directed and kept about 1 cup of sauce out and put it on right before I was ready to serve it.  It was a hit!!  This is the best macaroni recipe I have ever made!!  This is a KEEPER!

The best mac salad ever.  It is a must at every family get together.  I use spiral noodles and yellow peppers instead of the green.  I omit the celery and add cucumbers to it.  Very good...

Really loved it! I didn't have any condensed milk so just used the sugar and kept everything else the same. And I thought that was really good. Can't wait to try it with the condensed milk, I might cut down on the sugar a little then. I also really liked how the shredded carrots looked in it, looked like cheese, but without all the extra calories. This ones a keeper!

This recipe is out of this world. Everyone loved it!  I actually made a double batch, which was a huge amount.  It still ALL went!  I just stopped to leave a review because someone else just emailed me for the recipe.  I used my vidalia onion chopper thing, and I had all the veggies chopped in no time at all.  I used bow tie pasta and it was really pretty.

If you aren't sure if you want to try this or not, please trust us!!  Don't forget to leave it set overnight.  Although, we always eat a bowl, yes, a bowl, right after we make it.  I make 32 servings of this salad and put it in the fridge.  Within two or three days, my fam has eaten all of it.  It is just amazing.  Change up the veggies if you like, but don't mess w/that dressing!  Thank you so much for this recipe.

This is a excelent dish, I have made it a few times and brought it to family gatherings. I made only a few alterations which don't change the original layout of the recipe. 
1. I used pasta shells instead
2. I added some smalled cube chedder cheese and peas.
3. I cut down on the sugar and vinager, condensed milk is pretty sweet and after letting the mixture sit over night the pasta really absorbes the liquid I didn't want it to sweet.

Such a good recipe I probably wont try another one. Maybe some time I will actually use the macaroni instead of small pasta shells!

This was quite good.  I did follow other reviewers suggestions and completely left out the sugar and used less sweetened condensed milk.  I just added some, tasted the dressing, added some more, etc.  Ended up using only about 1/4 can.  It also made more dressing than we needed.  I scooped half the dressing out of the bowl before addding the salad ingredients and added the rest as I stirred.  I ended up w/ at least 1/2 cup extra.  I did not need to add it later either.  I left out the carrots and added frozen peas.  I think one of the biggest keys to a good macaroni salad is leaving the macaroni very firm.  I will make this again, thanks.

I made this for our annual Memorial weekend at the lake house.  I left the sugar out due to other comments.  I really don't like macaroni salad, but my fiance loves it, so I made it, I now love macaroni salad.  I had so many compliments on it, and have been asked to bring it to the Father's Day cookout!!  I love that, thanks so much!!

This recipe is GREAT!!
I added half the sugar. I recommend not adding any at all. It was too sweet so I added a little mustard and a jar of peperoncini and OH MY GOD it went from great to FABULOUS. It is perfectly sweet with just the right amount of spice.  Thanks for the recipe

I waas searching the net for this recipie. My ex mother-in-law made this wonderful salad, and since my divorce I have not found it. The only difference in her salad was she used a can of evaporated milk instead of condensed milk, I think this simple change makes the salad perfect. Just the right amount of sweetness *smile*

My family and I loved this macaroni salad. The first thing I heard out of my husband's mouth was, " Oh my God this is delicious. It's the best macaroni salad I've ever had." The only change I made was to reduce the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup. I followed everything else as written. If your tired of eating your basic ordinary macaroni salad, your in for a unique treat with this recipe. This salad definitely lives up too its name. Thank you for sharing your recipe with us. It was a big hit !!!!!!!!

We didn't like this at all. It sounded sickeningly sweet, so I only used half the amount of sweetened condensed milk and sugar called for.  It was still sickeningly sweet, even to my hubby who has a huge sweet tooth.

We liked this macaroni salad, but only after I took advice of others and cut way back on sugar & condensed milk.  I can't even imagine the end product if I hadn't of done this, as it was very sweet with the modifications.

This is by far, the best macaroni salad recipe I have found.  This is a great sweet NY deli style macaroni salad.  I always receive requests for this recipe when I attend picnics and BBQs.  I do not deviate at all from the original recipe.....I make exactly as shown.

I thought the sugar plus the sweetened condensed milk would make it almost inedible so I read reviews beforehand...I’m glad I did! I chose to omit the sugar and add only about a quarter can of condensed milk. It was still too sweet. I added some extra mayo and more vinegar which helped a little.

I had forgotten all about buying condensed milk for this and while I was adding things in, I added 1/2 cup of sugar even though I don't think a macaroni salad needs sugar.  This step made me cringe but I did it.  THEN saw it wanted me to add condensed milk.  OMG why is there so much sugar in this dish? I did add the CM but only because the dressing on seemed running and I was hoping the condensed milk might help that a bit somehow.    But had I noticed this in the beginning I would never have added the 1/2 cup sugar and only would have done the condensed milk  Holy cow this thing is to sweet to eat.  The flavor it is good but this might give you full blown diabetes LOL.  I am gonna have to throw this out.  If I ever attempt to make this again I will be making a TON of changes.

I typically do not review...but this recipe is GREAT!  It is the perfect compliment to a BBQ with a bunch of salty food like baked beans and chips.  I also omitted the sugar and it was perfect.

I bet I have made this 20 times with no modifications except I added small cubes of cheddar cheese.  

This is my go to Macaroni Salad!!!

I do have a hard time when people take the time to rate a recipe but change the essence of the recipe, delete things or add so much that the original is unrecognizable.

I've been making this macaroni salad since I found the recipe 16 years ago. It's my absolute favorite and everyone loves it! I usually add sliced black olives and I don't add the 1/2 cup of sugar because it is more than sweet enough without it... so make sure you taste the dressing before adding it.

I've added black olives in mine and every time I make it I get the same feedback on how amazing it is and if they can have the recipe... even get calls days following the event i made it for.  No one believes me that I followed a recipe online! This is a great recipe :)

made this on 8/4/14 as written with the exception of not adding the 1/2 cup of sugar due to others suggestions and it was great perfect amount of sweetness so in my recipe I am writing optional next to the 1/2 cup of white sugar I agree that the sweetened condensed milk makes it sweet enough great recipe love it

Made this yesterday and served it today. Fiance's exact words, "That mac salad was amazing. I think it's the best I ever had." I'm not a huge mac salad fan, but he is. And I did like it too! I was scared by the amount of sugar this recipe said to add. I did as many other reviewers did and omitted the sugar. In fact, I didn't even add all the condensed milk! I added probably 2/3 of a can. I added a lot of pepper and salt and it was delicious! My recommendation would be to go light on the milk and no sugar, then continue to add to your taste. One other note, it's very "soupy" when you first make it. Stir a few times during the next 8-12+ hours and it really creams/thickens up nicely! Def make a day ahead of time as the flavors really come together well!! :)

This is the best macaroni salad I have ever eaten.  Every time I make it people ask me for the recipe.  You can actually cut the sugar in half and it's still delicious.

I have used this site for over 10 years and never wrote a review. I had to for this recipe. Absolutely delicious macaroni salad. I brought it to a potluck, and I had 8 people raving about it. Several said it was the best dish they ever had at a potluck and asked for the recipe. I made two changes. I used 3/4 of the can of evaporated milk, and I omitted the sugar (it was the perfect sweetness without it). Make this dish!

Addictive. Didn't add the extra sugar. May put a teensy bit more vinegar next time to make it more tart. Will also try with a lower fat mayo. Used bag of Aldi stir fry vegetables. They were PERFECT and eliminated the chopping. The bag even had water chestnuts and little baby corn. Yum yum yum!

This was okay, nothing terrible, nothing great, just kind of bland.  I added 1 tsp. of dry mustard, 1 Tbsp of hot paprika, 1 Tbsp of sweet paprika and 3 chopped hard-boiled eggs.  I STRONGLY suggest you taste this before you add the sugar- it is already sweet and the sugar addition completely overwhelms it.  This can be made the night before and it keeps beautifully.

Great easy recipe.  I do not add the sugar as it is already sweet enough.  I also prepare it a day ahead of time so the flavors can blend.  Big hit with my family and friends.

Way too sweet!!! I didn't use the 1/2 cup sugar either. I thought it sounded too sweet using sweetened condensed milk, but it has such good reviews I wanted to try. To try to tone the sweetness down I added 1/2 cup more mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup more vinegar. It was still too sweet for my taste and I do like a mildly sweet macaroni salad. Anyway I served to my weekend guests, they said it was ok, but nobody came back for seconds.

Way too sweet.  I read other reviews and omitted the sugar, added 2 TBSP spicy mustard and 1 tsp paprika. Still so sweet I ended up rinsing the entire bowl and starting over without the milk and sugar.

As written, this is was way too sweet, even after I eliminated the sugar and only used half the sweetened milk.  I think a quarter can would be about right.  At least that is how I plan to make it the next time.

Did not add the sugar, used fat free condensed milk and 1 1/2c lite mayo. I used a bag of veggie spiral pasta 14oz bag.  I love all of the veggies mixed in. will defiantly make this again!

Totally awesome salad.  I hate when people rate a recipe and then change everything about it so I probably shouldn't do this but I didn't put any sugar in it.  It was plenty sweet just with the condensed milk. My family gobbled it up.  I put tons of veggies in it to help me feel less guilty about all the mayo.

This was ok, but not my favourite. I found there was not enough acid / tang to counteract the sweet. I completely cut out the sugar and also added a bit of pickle juice to see if that would help. Maybe I will try again with less condenced milk.

BEST EVER!!!!!
This is the best macaroni salad I have EVER had... I am not a fan of mac salad as it is usually too mayo-ee.. But this is just perfect. I made it the first time to bring to a dinner party, and got RAVE reviews. Now, mu husband asks for it weekly... Great recipe!

I would give 5 stars but I didnt use green peppers or red peppers. I always use carrots, and black olives and sometimes I switch it up and do cucumbers and tomatoes, but the dressing alone is great and if u eve want it less sweet do less sugar or omit it due to the sweetened milk it gives the sweetness wonderful idea thanks

I was never a big macaroni salad person it always seemed too dry but this was an awesome recipe and everybody raved.  I was sceptical about the sweet milk but that is what made this dish so delicious.  Thank you for sharing it.

Pretty good recipe! I did a little tweaking though. The things I changed were : instead of celery I added fresh chopped cucumbers, & when it came to the vinegar I used equal parts apple cider & white vinegar, I also added 1 chopped hard boiled egg, & I topped off with paprika & bacon bits  ** (also my fiance is a diabetic so I used a sugar substitute instead of regular sugar, & I committed the sweetened milk. I did however add 2 drops of honey to it ( I made a HUGE bowl of it so I knew it wouldn't affect a diabetic's blood sugar even nearly as much as using regular sugar would but would still give the same taste) My fiance loved it & I loved it as well! Also, I would add a little more mayo if you like it on the creamier side =)

I used a food processor to make this awesome macaroni salad. It was easy and taste great. My family loved it. I will definitely used this recipe again. As an alternate, I used red, yellow, orange and green peppers. It was very colorful and tasted great

I just made this salad and it is amazing, but I did tweak it a bit after reading the reviews. I left out the sugar, only used half of the onion, and most importantly...cut the dressing in half! Even after a night in the fridge there was plenty of sweet creamy dressing but the other flavors had room to come through. Love, love this! Thanks for the recipe!

I did not care for this. It was sweet but I guess sweet macaroni salad is not for me. I won't make this again. The sauce was more for coleslaw.

All I can say is Sweetened Condensed Milk; who would have thought.  This is the best mac salad I have every had.  Did reduce sugar to 1/4 cup.  AWESOME!  Prepared for teachers appreciation cook-out and got a call 1/2 an hour after function was over -  to request recipe.  Wow how impressive is that.

EXCELLENT Recipe! Since I didn't have sweetened condensed milk on hand, I added the sugar instead. My husband said it was the best Macaroni Salad ever! Not sure how different the taste is by using the condensed milk and omitting the sugar, but we (and everyone else) loved it with the sugar and no condensed milk. This recipe is certainly a keeper!!!

hmmm, very yummy . I tried this today at 11:30 am , leaving out the sugar as i thought it was sweet enough after adding the milk. Used red alcoholic vinegar instead as i didn't have any white one at home. As we couldn't wait overnight we had the salad after two hours of chilling and guess what ... compliments all the way ..It makes me wonder what it will taste like after about 8 hours. I am definitely adding this to my list of favs. Thanks for posting. I left out the one star to rate after trying it later and leaving it overnight. lol

Made this salad for my daughter in laws baby shower. It was a HIT! All the ladies loved it! One lady insisted on knowing exactly what was in it! Bell peppers, she said, I don't like them, but this is delicious! Thanks for sharing this recipe. This one is a keeper! Oh, I left out the onion(don't like it) and the 1/2 c. sugar(was afraid like others that it would be too sweet) :)

Though this recipe is time consuming the results are worth it. This is my go to recipe for BBQ's, parties and pot lucks. It does make a lot of food. When I make this recipe . The milk makes it plenty sweet. With the sugar it's too sweet for my tastes.

Way too much sugar. With all that sugar in the sweetened condensed milk one doesn't need more sugar. I'd advise everyone to taste before adding any extra sugar. 1 cup sugar? I don't think so.

I liked the color and taste all the veggies give this dish.  However, the next time I make it I will taste it before adding all the sugar as it was too sweet in my opinion.

I made this recipe for a work function and it was a hit!!!  I actually doubled the recipe but I omitted the sugar since I read from other reviews that it was too sweet and I also only added only 1.5 cans of sweetened condensed milk.  I also added 1 cup of lowfat milk to make it creamier and I think it came out great.  This will def be my go to salad to make for functions. I also did not rinse the macaroni I added the dressing in while hot so that was def a time saver as well.

Made this when we went camping, I was really hoping it would be good because it was the salad I was to bring to the table for two nights.  I made it 24 hrs ahead, didn't add the carrots, 1/2 the sugar and soaked the red onion in water for about 5 mins before mixing the salad to tone down the onion flavor.  Was awesome, my husband asked why I don't make it at home, now I will! :)

Just made this last night for a bunch of working contractors ... Came home to rave reviews ... "Wow-I don't usually like pasta salad, but this one was great, what is the secret ingredient!"  Thanks for posting.  The only two things I changed was put Vidalia Onion for Red Onion since I didn't have one.  I also took out the sugar as suggested by someone.  I will ONCE AGAIN make this for another function!  Ilove allrecipes.com, I can always find a great recipe!

Way too sweet and drenched in mayo.  Half the dressing would have been better.  Also, if you make this I would recommend dicing the carrots, not shredding them, or using only 2 cups of shredded carrots, not four

YUMMY!!  I was invited to two cookouts this Memorial weekend and took this macaroni salad to both.  I made it with the sugar and then without (based on the reviews).  Each were great and well received, but I have to say I like it much better without the sugar.  The condensed milk alone provides just enough sweetness so it's still tangy.  I've already been requested to make it again for the 4th of July!  I'm going to be making this macaroni salad for many years to come!

I only changed one thing, I added 6 hard boiled eggs and that seemed to cut down on the sweetness. I thought chopping would be a problem but wasn't, well worth the time. Great recipe highly recommend. I don't usally rate recipes  but this one I did.

ok this was fantastic. I did change some things up tho, just because I didn't have ll the ingredients. Instead of the peppers, carrots and celery- i used chopped up black olive, dill pickle, sweet vidalia onion, an tomato. The amounts are really whatever you like. I didn't add any sugar, the sweetened condensed milk is sweet enough for this. I used red wine vinegar instead of white, because it was what I had on hand. I would never have thought of using the sweetened condensed milk in macaroni salad, but it was great. Thanks for this recipe, I will use it often!

By Far - The Best - Macaroni Salad!  EVER! I used both a whole green and red bell pepper.  I also omitted the sugar (its not needed).  Added about a cup and a half of frozen peas and about 3/4 cup of water to the mayo mix to thin it out some. wonderful! Fantastic!

yummy!! I changed up the pasta and used a scoobi-doo pasta (spiral).  I also used a carrot slaw mix (carrots/broccoli/cabbage) along with green/red peppers, red onion and celery.  I didn't use a half can of condensed milk. and less than half a cup of vinegar as well as the 1/2 cup of sugar.  My family & friends loved it!! Many thanks to the creator of this recipe.

Tried this recipe for a xmas get-together and wasn't too crazy about it. Too sweet for my liking..I like mac salad that is a little more on the tangy side... Although my daughter-in-law said she liked it but maybe she was just being nice?

Nice change to the standard Macaroni Salad.  I tried the recipe for a catering event last weekend.  I did double the amount of pasta, skipped the sugar and added more mayo.  This gave it a hint of sweetness but, not overpowering.  I did receive many compliments and requests for seconds.

The only thing I changed was less condensed milk and sugar. I would do little by little and taste. Other then that it was AWESOME. I made this for my casual wedding and there wasnt a noodle left!

I did some "tweaking" to the recipe. Completely left out the sugar. Cut the sweetened, condensed milk down to just a 1/3 of a cup.  Cut the amount of raw onion in half.  Everyone LOVED it!!! Wonderful taste.  Fabulous recipe.

This is just way too sweet with all that sugar and the sweetened condensed milk.  Nobody in my house(including my husband and 2 kids) would eat it.

I made tis the night before for my son's birthday party thinking people would gobble it up! I had over a pound left (made 2 lbs.) I omitted the sugar like some of the other people had suggested. I didn't find it to be the best tasting salad, maybe it was the condensed milk.

This was my first time attempting a macaroni salad and it got rave reviews.  I only rated it 4 stars because I used less than half the amount of sugar the recipe called for, based on the reviews.  I made this the day before I needed it, and stirred it every few hours.  It definitely tasted better that way because the flavors had time to blend together.  This recipe makes enough to feed a small army, so I'll probably halve it next time.

I am not a huge macaroni salad fan, and I really do not like mayo. BUT.......! I made this for a "tiki theme" birthday party and everyone loved it! They kept asking me what I put in it. Some people could not get enough of it. I ended up using LIGHT mayo and it turned out amazing. Great recipe and I will use this every summer!

This salad received many compliments when I brought it to a picnic. I did not add the sugar - the sweetened condensed milk made it plenty sweet. I did add leftover lemon asparagus that I had in the fridge.

This is way too sweet and I left the extra sugar out.  I had to keep adding vinegar to cut the sweet.  Will not make this again.

This was WAY to sweet!!  Holy cow.  The sugar is really not needed, and I'm not even sure I care for the sweetened condensed milk.  Next time I'll probably use a recipe that uses mayo as the base.  On the positive side, it was easy to make (because there are no eggs) and I did enjoy all the vegies.

Everyone, I mean EVERYONE went back for more!  I had more requests for this recipe than ever before!  Like other reviewers, I cut the sweetness back just a little (omit sugar or if doubling/tripling, one can of milk).  I also tripled the recipe- worked great!  THIS IS A KEEPER : )

Love this macaroni salad.  Made it for my son's pole vaulting team.  They loved it.  We put in broccoli that was blanched, grape tomatoes and some cheese.  They at it all!

Absolutely the best macaroni salad I have ever had!! I'm not a big fan of red onion so I used green instead. I also didn't have celery but added some cucumber. Also used green, yellow and red peppers. This was a huge hit with all of my friends-- Even had one steal all of the left overs. This is my go to recipe from now on! Thank you so much for sharing it!

1st time making a macaroni salad, my mom wanted to make one for this past 4th of July and we found this is one, everyone love it, I read some of the other reviews and found that eliminating the sugar and using 3/4 can of sweetened condensed milk made the the sauce right on point...Great...... even for the mayonnaise haters..

Made if for the 4th of July for a bunch of picky teenagers - THEY LOVED IT. The only change I made was instead of the green pepper - I used red and yellow peppers which made it more colorful.

I experimented with family on Father's Day!  It was a hit! I didn't have celery on hand, so I left that out and after reading some of the reviews, cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup.  Everyone was surprised that sweetened condensed milk was used.  I only had a about 1/2 cup leftover which I ate last night.  While it was good the first time, after sitting overnight it was even better! I made mine Sunday morning.  Next time I'll make it the night before. AWESOME!

Have made this many times.  People go crazy over it.  I add frozen green peas, shredded cheddar cheese, crumbled bacon, tomatoes....really whatever you like in a pasta salad...go wild!  The dressing is what makes it so darn good.  Try the dressing on potato salad, just don't use as much.  I also add 5 t. yellow mustard to mine.  It has gotten rave reviews every time I have made it.  I made it last night for an event at school tomorrow.  I always make it a day or two ahead so the flavors have time to blend.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  It is in my file FOREVER!

Mmmm! This is really good! However...I cannot imagine how sweet it would be if you ad the sugar. I left it out all together and Im glad I did. It  still borders on too sweet...but its really good. I will cut the condensed milk down a bit next time I make it.

In the past 2yrs I have made this pasta salad 8 times. I make the dressing as is. But peppers are big bucks at times. I have added roasted red peppers, hot giardiniere for some heat and frozen sweetpeas and corn. I do not add the sugar. it is sweet enough. I had to start making dbl batches because people eat it all till it is gone.the basic drissing recipe is the key. add what you have on hand fast and very easy.

Two things: 1) Definately make the day before and  2) don't use all the sauce.  I did about 2/3 cup mayo (not salad dressing) 2/3 cup sour cream, and about 2/3 of the can of s.c. milk and NO sugar!  It was plenty sweet and creamy, and not soupy.  I thought the peppers and onions were a little over powering the day of but they mellowed out after sitting overnight.  Overall very good!  I substituted a few veggies (peas are good) and added mock crab.  Pretty versatile recipe and good for cook outs or large parties.  Thanks!

The salad would be good if you leave out either the sugar or the condensed milk. With both, it's just too sweet.

I really liked this, it was very different.  However, my husband and kids thought it was too "sweet" so I won't be making it very often.

I tripled this recipe for a baby shower. Instead of 6 cups mayo, I used 4 cups mayo and 2 cups sour cream and I used less carrots. I wasn't too sure about this after making it because it was super sweet, but after sitting overnight it was excellent and not over sweet. Excellent recipe!!!!

My family loved it! Did not use the milk the first time and doubled the sugar it was still very good. Second time used the milk and halved the sugar the trick is in the milk, yummy!

Like most I was a little timid to try this recipe but it was simple. If I had a food processor it would have been way easier. I havent let it sit overnight yet, but I always sample what I make right after and so far.... AMAZING!! It is a little sweet (for those without a sweet tooth -- yes cut down the sugar) but like someone else has said in the reviews it makes it stand out! GREAT recipe! Thank you for sharing it!  Oh and the condensed milk, never used it until now. Opened the can was a little scared but went with it anyway, and it looks amazing! Same with the vinegar a little timid about the vinegar when I mixed all the ingredients other than the mac and veggies but again it tastes great so far!)  The spouse is a little bit of a picky eater but he said he liked it too so far!!!

I have made this twice and we both absolutely love it.  I made it as written the first time and the second time with 1/3 cup of sugar.  It is sweeter than most macaroni salads but that is what we like about it, that it is different, that it stands out.  It is very good, very colorful and pretty and will be "my" macaroni salad from now on.  Thank you for the recipe.

This is a great recipe.  I only used about 2/3 of the can of milk, and deleted the 1/2 cup of sugar.  I absolutely love it.  I'm bringing it to a party tomorrow, so I will see what kind of comments I get on it.  Great idea to add the condensed milk!!

I made this recipe for the 4th of July.  It got raves from everyone!  I did omit most of the white sugar, although I did use a pinch.  I also tweaked the veggies and added cauliflower and broccoli florets.  My sister couldn't believe I made it from scratch - she said it was too pretty and it looked like I bought it from the deli!  Great salad.  Will make again and again!

I was unsure of this recipe because of the ingredients but I wanted a new twist on a favorite dish. I omitted the carrots (we're not into carrots, it's a personal preference) but followed the rest of the recipe as it is. Tasted it right after mixing it all together. Something was missing so I added paprika, dry mustard, chopped hard cooked eggs, and bacon bits! It helped but still not sure of taste so I put it in the frig to let the flavors blend. When we had with our dinner later on that day it was GREAT! the secret to this recipe for the best tasting flavor is to let it sit so the flavors can blend. The result is so worth the wait! I will definitely make this recipe again! Thank you so much for sharing such a great recipe!

UPDATE!
Since making this recipe it is now a requested item for me to make! I'm asked "Can you make YOUR Macaroni Salad?" I'm happy to oblige and so thankful I found this recipe!

I was a very skeptical about this recipe but decided to try it and I am so glad that I did.  My skepticism was all the sugar so the only change I made was adding only about 1/4 cup of sugar and it turned out great.  I will definitely be making this again and don't worry if it seems a little soupy at first it thickens up nicely.

Just too sweet for our taste.  I will try again leaving out the sweetened condensed milk instead of as many reviewers suggested, cutting out the sugar and maybe add just a little garlic powder.

Really delicious!!  It is sweet, but this is just the type of macaroni salad we like.  I served this to friends and they asked for the leftovers!  When that happens, I know it is a 5 star recipe.  Husband suggested adding some lump crab meat next time.  DELICIOUS!

I made this recipe for a pot luck at a square dance and it was inhaled.  I really think that it is the best macaroni salad I have ever made or tasted.  I did change a few thing though.  I only added a pinch of pepper, no salt and 2 tsp of minced garlic.  I only used a half can of the condensed milk and used some paprika as a garnish.  Also no sugar was added.  Came out great.

A big hit at work luncheon. I left out the sugar and added all other ingredients to taste before pouring over macaroni.  It seemed to loose some of its sweetness the next day, so I stirred in a bit more of the milk. Seemed to do the trick, although next time I'll probably be more generous with the milk to begin with.

Ultimate yum!  My husband, who doesn't like macaroni salad, tried it.  Then he had more.  And said, "Five stars.  This is the best.  You can make it again." The only change I made was less onion.  I made a double batch and took it to a big party and people gobbled it up!

I love macaroni salad, but am very picky. There was only one mac salad I would eat and for years searched for a close recipe, and this is it. I leave out the red pepper, and the sugar, and it is perfect!!!!! I make this all the time, and everyone loves it! Thank you!

Even though I omitted all of the sugar, this was still way too sweet for me. I added extra vinegar to try and balance out the sweetness which helped, but not entirely. I decided to doctor it up with lemon juice from 1/2 a lemon, 1 can of corn, and about a tablespoon of curry powder. The only thing it was wanting were some green olives, but I didn't have any.

This recipe was just to sweet for me.  I left the sugar out and just used the condensed milk.  I think if I make it again I will use less than 1/2 can of milk.

My husband and I really liked this salad.
I did leave out the sugar and 1/2 can of the condensed milk was just right to me. I added some cheese crumbles and later, to increase liquid, added some regular milk.  It is definitely better the next day.  Not something I will make to often due to the sugar content, but will be great for our monthly church dinners and family get togethers. Thanks so much for the recipe.

This recipe is on the sweet side but you can definitely curb that by adjusting the ingrediants if you like.  You DO NOT have to double up the dressing, it makes plenty.  I didn't even need to use all of the mayo.  It tasted great and I really enjoyed it.  I'm fairly picky when it comes to macaroni salads.

Tastes best when fully chilled.  Something we will make again and definitelye experiment with different veggies.  Colourful and perfect for a picnic or potluck event.

I took this to a family BBQ the first time I made it.  Everyone loved it.  I listened to the reviews and omitted the sugar it was sweet enough.  It makes alot of salad but it went quickly:)

Very tasty! I did cut the sugar in half thinking that I could add more, but it was sweet enough without being too sweet. Great for a potluck dinner!

I omitted the sugar in this recipe and it turned out great.  I think the sugar would make it too sweet.  It was just perfect - the right amount of sweetness from the condensed milk!!!!!!!!!!

I made this recipe for my family this past weekend and they absolutely loved it. The one thing I did was to eliminate the sugar, we found it delectable without it. Thank you for this fabulous recipe, now I have another alternative to the one I have made for years. AWESOME!!

I love this recipe!  I did not add any sugar though and plenty sweet for me.  I did everything else the same except substituted cucumber and small pieces of cheese instead of peppers and celery.  I'm sure it's great no matter what veggies you add.

This turned out great!  I took the advise of the past reviews and only added about 1/3 of the condensed milk that it called for.  I also didn't add the celery because I'm not a big fan of it.  Everyone loved it!

I love this recipe!  I have made it a number of times and almost always get rave reviews for it.  I only use about 1/3 of the sweetened condensed milk though, otherwise it is too sweet.  Other than that, I add my own spices.  GREAT, GREAT Recipe!!!!

The first time I made this recipe, I halved all the "sweet" ingredients and the vinegar.  (apple cider instead of white)   I let it sit after several hours, it was still reeeeally sweet.   My initial thought was to throw it away, but I didn't.   A couple of days later, I tasted it again, needed something still, so I gave it a shot of mustard----I liked the addition.      The couple of days really meshed the flavors and we ended up with a keeper recipe.   With the hot weather now, it's a great cool side dish for any kind of smoked meat, BBQ, roast chicken.... Play with the proportions---the condensed milk ads a unique flavor--we're all sold on it over here!  Use more mayo if the pasta absorbs too much of the dressing ingredients.

After reading the reviews I cut back on the amount of mayo, sugar, vinegar, and especially the condensed milk I added to the recipe.  I only used about 1/3 of the can of condensed milk.  With these modifications the salad was still a tiny bit soupy, but tasted really good and plenty sweet.

I gave it two stars for tasting "ok" when I first mixed it together. After it set overnight in the fridge it was horribly sweet. We ended up throwing it away :(. If you decide to try this, use half of the milk first to see if you like it.

This macaroni salad is the BEST one I’ve ever made!  Every party I make it for my guests can’t believe i made it and always ask for the recipe.  It’s just the right amount of sweet and salty and the condensed milk is the key ingredient..def a party favorite!  Only thing I change is maybe using a little less of the sugar because the condensed milk is sweet enough.

This is my go-to macaroni salad recipe.  I use ditalini instead of elbows.  I also use pre-shredded carrots since I find that shredding the carrots fresh adds too much moisture.  It's excellent!

I’ve searched for a macaroni salad recipe like this for years...I am so thankful to have found this one! 

I did substitute my favorite red wine vinegar in place of white, added red peppers along with the green, to even out the colors since I left out the onions and carrots, but everything else I did exactly as the recipe suggested and it turned out perfectly! This was exactly what I was looking for. It doesn’t dry out after a day or two in the fridge like most other recipes I’ve tried. 

I would recommend making it the night before though so the dressing portion has a chance to set up. To be quite honest, it’s good either way (although even better the next day, if that’s even possible!) but it will be fairly runny if you don’t wait long enough.  

Thank you so much for the great recipe! I swear I must have have made this 6 times over the course of August and September because it was that good!!

This macaroni salad is a hit every where, every time. I have had sooooo many request to make it for some events and sooo many request for the recipe. My finance eats it by the bowls when I make it. I like to add paprika to my salad it does not alter the salad at all just another layer of flavor. I definitely recommend. make this salad as is, do cut out or short the measurements of anything unless you don't like a lot of veges (lol)

I've been making this salad for several years. And it's delicious.  The most striking surprise when you first make it is the amount of dressing!  Sure explains why most traditional macaroni salads get quite dry, often by the first serving.  (How often have you found yourself adding mayo at the last minute?)  This salad stays moist through multiple servings.  For those who find it too sweet with the condensed milk...I often substitute a 16oz container of SOUR CREAM  for the condensed milk.  Making this simple substitution tips the sweet/tart  taste more towards tart but still maintains a nice balance while creating a slightly more traditional overall taste.

It is good but a little  too sweet for me but I will finish it. . I tasted it before I put the sugar in and it was really good. I should have left it out I thought well I will try original recipe first. I will try again without the sugar.

I have made this dozens of times. The only changes I made is I omitted the sugar, and soaked the cooked macaroni in cold water for 30 minutes(I find the soak allows for a smooth salad) I also don’t use green peppers (I don’t care for them) I use red, orange and or yellow peppers.

I made this recipe and it is a keeper for sure! I only made one change and cut the sugar out. Condensed milk is sweet enough. I left everything else and my company loved it.

Make this all the time and have shared it countless times.   Everyone raves!  I use two whole peppers, delete sugar entirely and use a sweet onion instead of red, which is very strong.   Also add extra celery so it's very vegetably!   Awesome recipe!   Thank you!

Agreed with most people that this definitely does NOT need the added sugar. I even thought of maybe trying unsweetened condensed milk (evaporated milk) next time because it’s still on the sweeter side than I would like. I doubled this recipe when I made it so i think if it were a can of each then it would be perfect. I also added the dry mustard powder and smoked paprika. So so good!

SUPER EASY! 
I separated into 2 different ones. I know too many people that won't try anything with Onions. I also added Black Olives., which took away some of the sweetness

Easy recipe but the only change I would make is cut vinegar and sugar in half...It was to sweet for our family, for others I am sure is not. Added garlic, paprika....Great easy recipe of the classic homemade

I followed the recipe exactly except I lowered the amount of sugar to half. Both my son and husband had seconds. It was better the second day, since I did not have enough time to let it sit before serving.  Overall, a great recipe that I will make again!

I have gotten lots of compliments at potlucks when I bring this. It is much too sweet if you add sugar as well as the condensed milk. I add most of the condensed milk (not quite all of it) and it is plenty sweet for me, so adjust according to your taste buds.

Turned out exactly as it tasted over 20 years ago when I first tried it at a potluck. I am not a mayonnaise lover but tried it and loved it since then. Thanks for sharing the recipe. ??

I am not a big fan of macaroni salad but this is my go-to recipe for any large get-together or pot luck because it is not only delicious but it makes a LOT. I always get great comments. I love the crunchies so I cut up the entire bell pepper and add it. The only down-side is this is not a low calorie dish.

I made this for a golf-league potluck.  I wanted to try something new for a summer supper.  At first, I was a little uncertain about the sweetened condensed milk, but I decided to trust the recipe.  I did skip the addition of the white sugar.   My golfing pals went nuts for this salad and all of the wives wanted the recipe as soon as they could get it.   Thank you, allrecipes, for making me a hero!

Inedibly sweet. I omitted the white sugar and reduced the sweetened condensed milk by 2 ounces, but it was still sickeningly sweet. I added a couple more tablespoons of vinegar to try to salvage it, but it was no use.

This is a sweet macaroni salad and, the recipe feeds a lot of people. It is easy and affordable to make. I suggest that you make it the day prior to your event and,  omit the sugar in he recipe. The sweetened condensed milk sweetens the salad enough. Really glad that the author shared this recipe. Thank you, author. Your recipe is delicious.

i am not a mayo person but take care of the church kitchen, the ladies suggested mac salad as a side for our annual bbq dinner and i found this one. just as easy to make a batch for 200 as for 10.  helpful tip if you are making in large quantities you can order from GFS veggies pre chopped & shredded.

This recipe is fantastic!  I added 5 oz. of mild cheddar cheese cut into small chunks, about 8 -10 small sweet  pickles sliced, 4 hard boiled eggs sliced, 1 small cumcumber cut into small pieces, and paprika.  I sliced some tiny tomatoes and laid them on top of the salad.  BTW, I didn't have the correct milk, so I took a can of evaporated milk and added half a cup of sugar to it.  Worked fine.

So good. I omitted the sugar because I figured the sweetened condensed milk would sweeten it plenty, and it was absolutely perfect. Definitely let it chill the full 8 hrs or so...the pasta soaked up any excess liquid and the next day it was thick and creamy. Perfect consistency.

I thought this was tasty, though a bit too sweet for me.  Thesweetened condensed milk adds a lot of sugar to the dressing.  Next time, I think I’ll cut the added sugar in half, or maybe skip it altogether.  Also, I think I’ll use Apple Cider Vinegar instead of white vinegar.

I got rave reviews on this at my Memorial Day Celebration. Like others, I also reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and only used about 1/2 a can of the condensed milk initially. Once it sat and soaked up the moisture overnight, I was able to moisten it with a little of the left over condensed milk. I would say that I used almost a full can by the next day. I made two batches and I have to say that the batch that sat overnight was the best tasting! I was worried about having too much left over, because of some people cancelling but that didn’t happen. People commented on how good this was and I was giving the recipe out left and right!

My husband (picky) said it was the best macaroni salad he’s ever had.  I only put a little bit of white sugar in not the full amount. Thank you for sharing!!

I left out the sugar, so it had just the right sweetness. Overall, this was nice. No, wait... not nice... amazing. Ok, I’m revising this from my first post... If you let it sit for a couple days in the fridge, it turns into a taste and texture that makes you want to do that thing in all food commercials where they slow mo close their eyes with their first bite while as sunshine pours down on them out of nowhere. Initially, I ate it after only letting it sit for a couple of hours, and although it was good, it wasn’t perfect. Now it’s perfect. 

FYI: This makes a TON. Wow, it was heavy when it was done.

Much too sweet and thick.  Look for the macaroni salad recipe that uses evaporated milk instead.  This is very bland also.

Loved it. Omitted the sugar to taste first. I didn't need it, but it is a personal preference thing. Also, I added almost all of the sweetened condensed milk. Saved the rest for my cappucino. Yum.

This was my third time trying to make macaroni salad and I finally found one that everyone likes. The only change I would make is less sugar. Besides that, it’s DELICIOUS!

I liked the idea of a creamy dressing, so decided to give this a try. I didn't add any sugar, added sliced black olives, cubed cheese chunks, and cubed ham chunks, for more of a main dish salad. Even with the elimination of the sugar, it was much too sweet for my taste. Also, I allowed it to sit overnight, as suggested. While some of the dressing may have been absorbed, the portion that wasn't was very liquid like.  This is one I won't make again.

This is a wonderful pasta salad. Fresh and crisp and delicious! I did add black olives because I love them, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I took another reviewer's advice to not cool the pasta before adding the dressing. I coated the pasta well, then added the veggies and gave it another good stir and into the refrigerator to chill.  Just fabulous!  I was asked to bring a salad for a reception and this is it. I will be making this one often. Thanks for the great recipe : )

Suggestions/variations: Use only ½ cup sweetened condensed milk. (4 oz., not 14!) Omit the sugar. Do make this a day ahead. (On the 1st day, the vinegar flavor predominates; it recedes into the background overnight.) Use small elbows, not large. Try ½ cup of chopped scallions (green parts) instead of red onion. Use 3 or 4 seeded/diced fresh jalapenos rather than bell peppers. Use 1 cup of grated carrot (grated on a box grater). Use 1 rib of finely diced celery. (Slice the rib lengthwise 2 or 3 times before slicing thinly crosswise. If you adore celery, add a 2nd rib!) Mix a Tbsp. of Dijon mustard & a tsp. of ground black pepper into the dressing. Add a 10 oz. box of frozen baby peas (thawed & drained, or very lightly blanched, shocked in cold water & thoroughly drained). Add 1 to 2 cups of shredded chicken breast. Or add up to 1 lb. of uncured hot dogs, first sliced into coins & boiled with the elbows to reduce their high sodium content & to extract some of the fat. Add ½ cup black olive slices.

I changed the recipe a bit, I'll go to my local supermarket and buy a fresh rotisserie chicken and debone it then chop it up, added 4 hard boiled eggs diced, 1 teaspoon paprika, 1/2 tsp black and white pepper each ,one red apple diced and reduced the sugar from 1/2 cup to adding sugar to taste. and its been a hit.....

Enjoy...

Could this recipe really call for condensed milk and not sweetened condensed milk? I loved the amount of veggies this recipe called for and thought I could cut down enough on the sweetness by only using only 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup sweetened condensed milk, along with the 1/2 cup vinegar. It was still WAY too sweet. Next time, if I can't find my old recipe, I will eliminate the sweetened condensed milk altogether or use half a can and no sugar. Or maybe there won't be a next time.

Best macaroni salad I've ever had in my life, and I've tried many variations over the years. I add small chunks of sharp cheddar to send it over the top. Every time I take this somewhere people want the recipe. Better if made at least a day ahead. If the macaroni absorbs too much of the liquid and seems dry, add a little water the next day and stir. Perfect!

Fantastic!!  Will replace my usual recipe for macaroni salad from now on. I did as others suggested and left out the sugar. I also kept about a cup or so of the dressing  aside and added it just before serving. I added some cut up mini tomatoes and cucumber just before serving as well.  Unbelievable positive comments from everyone with requests for the recipe. A real keeper!!

This salad is a huge hit at all the gatherings. I read the reviews and dropped the sugar since the condensed milk adds just the right amount of sweet. Follow the advice of preparing the night before. I dropped the celery and added yellow pepper. I get compliments and requests for the recipe.

Needed something to bring to a church function, this was great, fast, easy and most everything I had already.  A big hit and super easy to make.  I didn't have the peppers so next time I'll add them too but it was fantastic even without them.  Thank you!

I made this with some modifications, using my available ingredients.  First, I did not use the condensed sweet milk.  I figure they put that in for the texture, so I added sour cream instead (1 cup).  I dropped the carrots and peppers (didn't have them).  I used one full cup of chopped celery and 1 full cup of white onion.  I used Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise.  I used the recommended amount of sugar and vinegar.  I added chopped pickles (maybe 10 chips) and sliced olives (maybe 8 oz.).  I used about 1/4 teaspoon celery seed.  I sprinkled some homemade bacon bits (cook bacon until crispy and chop it up).  I think it was amazing.  Some people say this recipe is too sweet.  First, macaroni salad from all my local delis is very sweet.  My advice is make it.  Add ingredients like pickles or olives, etc to balance the sweetness.  If you love macaroni salad, I think you will like this.  If you don't like sweet food, maybe macaroni salad is not for you.

The best macaroni salad I have ever made. Rave reviews from my family. It makes an awful lot, so those of you who cook for one or two, you may want to reduce the quantities. Only change I made was I used half of the sugar called for. The dressing for this is very delicious without it.  I went easy on the salt and pepper - can be added to taste individually. Yummmmmmmy! Oh, by the way, I didn't spend half the day chopping, I used my small food processor, just pulse till the size you want.

Did not rate 5 stars as I omitted the sugar and used only 3/4 of a can of the sweetened condensed milk.  And it was plenty sweet and a little tangy as I used apple cider vinegar because I did not have regular.  Would make this again.

This salad is delicious.  The only thing I did differently  was add  a little bit of prepared mustard.  Husband loved it!

Amazing macaroni salad! I make it all the time! However!!!! I do not put the sugar in. If you put the sugar in it is way way too sweet. I do everything else the same but I do not add sugar. Perfect that way.

I used half the sugar and mixed regular Hellman's w/ Hellman's Light, but otherwise followed the recipe to a tee.  The dressing is sweet, but not overly so...    My family thought the texture and flavor of the salad was excellent.

Love this recipe!! I too did not add the sugar- it did not need it! I made it for Mother's Day and it was completely devoured.  I added a touch of dill and paprika to spice it up some more. Delicious!

I made this for a family gathering. I used 1/4 cup of sugar instead of the 1/2 cup it called for. The rest of the recipe I made as stated.  The family loved it. I will be making this again. Thank you so much for the recipe.

I only used the can of condensed milk and it was WAY too sweet. Not at all what you'd think a savory macaroni salad would taste like. I am glad I didn't add the rest of the sugar. In order to tone the sickly sweet taste down I added a few chopped pickles, 1/4 c. dill pickle juice and some fresh dill. Turned out much better that way.  Could easily add other meats to it now including shrimp, chicken, ham, etc.

I'm not a huge fan of pasta salad, but wanted to make a batch for Easter dinner. This was close to the only one I like, but missing the cheddar cheese. So, I made it and thought  I used to much onion, as it was a little bitter. I held back on the condensed milk at first due to others comments.
I dislike recipe's that have random amounts, ie.. 4 carrots, 1 bell pepper etc. because it's to subjective.
I doubled it (to suit number of guests) and added one cup of sugar in place of the condensed milk, plus one bag shredded sharp cheddar and a second bag of mild cheddar cheese. 
At that point it became very bitter. (to much onion? I only used one large red). So giving in, I added half a can of the sweetened condensed milk. Still it seems something is missing, which accounts for the 4 star rating. I think its a very good recipe, but lacks that wow factor. I will try it again and experiment a bit. Thank you for sharing your good, basic pasta salad recipe with us!

I'm so sorry, but this just wasn't for us. It was way too sweet even though I didn't add the table sugar at all. Yes, I did let it marinate in the fridge a whole day. Even the next day ( as left-overs) the sweetness didn't even out for me.  I did enjoy the veggies, but  the flavor just didn't work for me. Also, if I did want to try this with changes next time, it needs more sauce ( i will be omitting the sweetened condensed milk)I will stick to my tried and true chicken  pasta  salad that calls for sour cream, mayo, olive oil, italian dressing, mozza and parma cheese,  pizza herbs, garlic,  etc... and boiled ( pre-seasoned) chicken fajita breasts.

This recipe definitely does not need that 1/2 cup of sugar and I ended up needing 3 cups of macaroni (dry)..the mac/liquid ratio was all off. And it would be helpful if you used cups of macaroni (dry) instead of ounces. I will make again with a few modifications.

Made as described and I found it to be okay. Could have done without the extra sugar, however my mother-in-law really enjoyed it. If you find it to be too sweet the first time, you will most likely enjoy it without the extra sugar.

This is a great recipe base. I have made this recipe a few times and it is always a hit. I have made a few adjustments though to accommodate my family's taste. First I do not put in the sugar, the condensed milk adds more than enough sweet and I use apple cider vinegar instead of white. I also like to add cubes of ham or crumbled bacon and green peas and corn to the rest of the veggies.  My husband is not a fan of green bell peppers so I use one whole red or yellow pepper instead.  But this is definitely in my go to box for potlucks and parties. Everyone loves it.

This is a hit everywhere I take it!  I cut the sugar in half, otherwise follow the recipe exactly.  The balance of sweet and vinegary is perfect.  Like so many things, it's best when made a day ahead, making sure to stir it a couple of times so that the noodles absorb all the wonderful flavors.  I get more positive comments as well as requests for this recipe than any dish I make!  Highly recommended!

Very good salad, the first time we made it just as the recipe says, it makes a ton for two people but delicious enough that we ate it all over a couple days. The second time cut it in half but changed it up a bit. Left out the condensed milk and used sour cream instead (less sweeter that way but still keeps it thick) then added kalamata olives, artichoke hearts, banana peppers and a dill pickle and some small cubed sharpe cheddar cheese to give it more depth in flavor, also used red wine vinegar instead of white vinegar . As someone that cant get enough noodle salad this is by far one of my favs

Delicious salad....I will make this for my next pot luck! Gave my neighbours a sample and they want the recipe. The first time I made this salad I listened to other reviews and reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup. I will reduce it further next time to 1/8 cup. I will increase the macaroni an extra 1/2 cup since there was lots of extra sauce.

This is delicious ! I got rave reviews from the guests at our 4th of July party. The only change I made was to skip the sugar, and halved the amount of sweetend condensed milk. That amount left is plenty tangy enough. This will be my go to Mac salad recipie !

The only change I made was that I used half the sugar in this recipe because the sweetened condensed milk makes it super sweet.  I have substituted stevia in here a couple of times and that works well also.

A good recipe made better with a few tweaks. Omit the sugar, cut the sweetened condensed milk to 1/2- 3/4 of a can, swapped out mayo for a vegan mayo, and omitted carrots. Showstopper at bbqs this summer. Not a bite was left behind!

I made this surprisingly delicious macaroni salad for a church meeting last week.  It easily fed 20 people and was a huge hit! Like other reviewers, I omitted the sugar.  I should also stress the importance of letting the salad sit in the fridge for several hours - or overnight - for the flavors to meld. The consistency will also be less runny if you do.  I also diced my veggies versus chopping, and will add more next time..  And there will definitely be a next time!

I would definitely make this again! I did alter the recipe slightly due to the ingredients I had on hand and the suggestions of previous reviews. I added half the sugar it called for but next time I would definitely only do about a fourth of the requested or none at all as it is very sweet even with half the sugar. I didn't have a green bell pepper on hand, only the red, and it was very good. I believe it would've been very good with the green pepper, too. But only having the one on hand still added the perfect amount of bell pepper taste. I would consider not adding ALL of the dressing as it is very creamy for my liking. I prefer mine slightly drier. But to each their own on that one. I added a teaspoon or so of dry mustard and would've added paprika had I had it like another posted suggested doing. I would not put eggs in this recipe. This is a very good summer recipe and I will be sure to make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

It does not need the additional sugar.  It is perfect without it..
Bought a package of already chopped up tri colored peppers and red onions.  By the time I would have purchased the the peppers it would have cost me just as much.  And that made this recipe a snap to make.  Loved this macaroni salad made it twice in the past 3 weeks.  Thanks for sharing....

I agree with all the praises! This was by far the BEST macaroni salad I have ever made or had! The first words out of my husbands mouth was, "this is the best I have ever eaten". I will make this again and again with no changes! I am glad I found it! And be sure to make it at least one day ahead of time. Cut back on the milk if you want it less sweet, but it calms down by the 2nd day.

I did not add the sugar. This salad is wonderful and I've been asked to bring it to a 4th get together. I am going to add some  chopped, pickled peperoncini peppers, just for a little kick. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Pregnancy made me crave the perfect macaroni salad, and this was it with a couple tweaks. I used evaporated milk instead and only a couple tablespoons vinegar. Fulfilled all my needs!

This is the BEST pasta salad I've ever had!  You can add any veggies you like.  I add cucumber, celery, chopped baby carrots, broccoli, cubed cheddar cheese, and cherry tomatoes.   Oh, and celery seed because hubby likes it. I use truvia ( 1/4 cup) instead of sugar and apple cider vinegar instead of regular.  I also prefer the bow tie pasta. I seriously can't keep from opening the fridge to sample it before supper is ready.

Great recipe!  I left the half cup of sugar out, as I felt it was sweet enough without it. I like to make my pasta salad with onions, bell pepper, peas and grape or cherry tomatoes quartered.

The fact that you're adding raw carrots, bell peppers and celery to this delicious recipe keeps me a true fan. I have made this colorful salad many times, each time another group of friends ask for the recipe. There are many substitutions you can use to make it healthier, i.e. Raw honey, gluten free pasta, organic apple cider vinegar, etc., whatever your passion! I love it!

This is a very good recipe and I will make it again. I doubled the pasta and veggies, but used just one can of the condensed milk and DID NOT add any sugar and it was still sweet enough.  I also did not rinse the pasta after draining and allowed it to come to room temperature by just tossing it every few minutes. I learned that by allowing the starches to remain on the pasta after draining the dressing adheres better and seems creamier as a finished product. Also the shredded carrots added a nice texture and vibrant color and I also added most of a spring onion to the mix.  This, plus red and yellow peppers and celery finely diced made for a beautiful looking and tasting salad to bring to any gathering.  My batch served 35 with leftovers. Enjoy!

This is a wonderful macaroni salad recipe.  I made it a day ahead for a dinner party and it was absolutely delicious . I followed the recipe exactly but did add 1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard and one can of niblet corn (398ml).  It was very creamy but still had a crunch to it. Thank you for sharing this recipe....it's a keeper for summer salads!

I made this today and truly couldn't believe how good it is! I had everything on hand except the carrots so I left those out. I cut the recipe in half and wasn't certain how much sweetened condensed milk would actually be needed since I live in Mexico and everything here is in metrics, so I decided to add everything else first and then add the milk to taste. It was already so good that I decided not to bother opening the can of sweetened condensed milk after all. GREAT recipe! Thanks for sharing it, Renee!

I have never made macaroni salad though I love it.  In searching for a recipe (needed to make a dish for a church supper-don't laugh)...anyway I came across this..read the reviews & decided this was the one to make.  Got it ready & could not wait until it had chilled 8 hrs .. had to taste right away....it is divine...and it makes a lot.  Will admit when I saw the condensed milk it made me wonder...but it just made the salad so creamy...Some had indicated it was too sweet so I did not add the sugar.. very very good....will definitely make again.

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I used the amount of sugar to taste (which I recommend you do too). My husband liked it around 1/4 cup sugar, so I stopped adding it after that. The recipe was a HUGE success. I think using the condensed milk is key to making this recipe creamy and delightfully different than the salads you can purchase at the grocery store.
I made the recipe again today, and omitted the sugar all together. Husband still likes it. So like I said, add the sugar per your personal taste.

I loved this so much! I added sliced black olives, as shown in one of the pictures, although they're not included in the actual recipe. I also added small chunks of cheddar cheese after eating the first half of the salad without it simply because I love cheese, not because the salad truly needed it.

To sweet. Too much sauce. DO NOT MAKE THIS!

Update: I only added carrots too the macaroni salad. This doesn't make a difference. But sweetened condensed milk? Really?

this is exactly what I was looking for.  I left out the peppers and added 1 cup cubed longhorn cheddar.  Reduced sugar perhaps a few tablespoons.  Very good recipe.  As stated before it is the dressing that makes this so good.

I made this recipe today for a family dinner of 6.  In Canada our sweetened condensed milk is 300 ml. the equivalent to approx 10 oz, so 4 ozs less than the receipt called for.  I added 1/8 c of sugar to make the difference & loved it plus so did everyone else & there was very little left over once my mom took some for their next meal.  I also did what one person said & that was to make the macaroni el dente and not rinse it as the sauce gets more absorbed & it worked. My sister in law wants the recipe.  This is one that I will use over and over again.  Thanks Spinderella!  From Saucykats

This is amazing! I followed the recipe and yes, I did add the 1/2 cup of sugar. It was NOT TOO SWEET! I made it on Sunday for a picnic on Monday - it was perfect! It was even better on Tuesday; I took some in for a co-worker to try and she loved it. I added a can of black olives because I always add black olives to my macaroni salad, and I used the bow-ties to make it purty!  I will use this recipe from now on (as written!) Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

Huge hit in my house!  I didn't even get it into the fridge before my son n law started snacking on it.  He raved about the flavor of the sauce and wanted to keep eating it.  I had to cover it and put a padlock on it to keep him from eating it all before our bbq. I didn't use sugar at all, and I added mustard.  Love it!

This is soooooo darn good.  I made this for the 4th of July and my family loved it.  It was pretty sweet and I would omit the sugar next time.  This was a big hit and my family is very picky.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent and just what I wanted.  I don't like those macaroni salads with a dressing that is just bland mayo.  My only changes were to (1) fail to make it 8+ hours ahead of time (thanks, chest freezer, for quickly chilling my salad!), (2) to follow the other reviewers in omitting the sugar, and (3) to use one green bell pepper instead of half a red and half a green. (Personal notes:  1 cup celery = 4 stalks.  Maybe up the pasta to everything else ratio.  Boil pasta in LARGEST pot, make up veggies and dressing in largest red bowl, drain and rinse pasta and return to pot, transfer dressed veggies to pot to mix, then return everything to red bowl (before or after chilling) for presentation.  Red bowl is large enough to hold, but too small to mix.)

12.24.13 - Made half a batch for garbage plates, left out carrot (as that doesn't keep well in this salad), and doubled the celery.  (You can freeze the other half of the can of sweetened condensed milk.)

02.02.14 - Made a whole batch for garbage plates for a party.  White onion (out of red), more celery instead of carrots, 1 red bell pepper instead of 1/2 green and 1/2 red.

04.27.14 - Half a batch fits nicely in the 8-cup storage containers.

At first when I read this recipe, I thought that there was too much liquid in it. I reread it and watched the video, and made the salad...
There was too much liquid and it is really sloppy. I still have it in the fridge and will check it tomorrow to see if it is still runny. 
I wonder if it could be that I live above 5000 feet in SLC...

I love this recipe but took the advice of other reviewers and omitted the sugar altogether. I'm also not a fan of raw onions so I left those out. This recipe is definitely best when made the day before you plan to eat it.

People were haggling over the leftovers when I took this to a potluck. It was the "WHO made THAT?" dish. I don't need another macaroni salad recipe. To save money I limited it to green peppers, and I suggest making it a scant half cup not a very full one. So delicious! We're making it, and I know I'm going to have to control myself, because it's too good!

I really liked this a lot. I was not sure about the sweetened condensed milk, but it was really good.  The mayo sauce could be used for many vegetables...broccoli, slaw, peppers, very good recipe!

This was good, but way too sweet.  I made the recipe completely as written for a family bbq.  It was not a failure, but I was expecting huge raves which did not happen.  I dont think I would make this again.

I made this again today, for the 5th time! Love this recipe! It's so fresh tasting and the vegies make it nice and crisp. I do omit half the sugar and only add enough dressing to moisten nicely (I usually have some left over) but to each his own. A keeper!!!! Thank you for sharing!

Way too much sugar!!! I would omit nearly all of it and just add to your taste. I ruined my fist try because I followed the recipe and then tasted. No way to cover up that much sugar.

I made this twice and both times it was delicious. However, the first time I used half the sugar in the recipe and I still thought it was sweet. So the second time I eliminated the sugar and it was perfect. The best thing about it is that since it has no cucumbers or other veggies prone to slime with time, it lasted several days tasting as good as day one.

Made this for first time yesterday.  Very good recipe and thanks for sharing. I have a very sweet tooth, but found this  too sweet. (Not sure why there is  added sugar when condensed milk is sweetened....) I think next time I will try "evaporated" milk instead , as I often add a splash of regular milk when making my usual recipe, to keep the salad from being too dry after cooled.
Was nice consistency.

What a surprize!  I honestly wasn't sure that we would like this one, but we LOVE it!  The sweet mixed with the tangy is really a great combination! 

 I skipped the peppers because we didn't have any and used a pack of frozen peas and carrots which I add to the boiling macaroni for the last minute of coooking.

Loved this recipe! I didn't use the white sugar and am glad I left it out because it was sweet enough. Actually could of been a bit more savory for my taste but we all loved it. This will be my macaroni salad recipe for ever. And it looks pretty too will all the veggie colors!

I substituted frozen peas (thawed) for the carrots.  And added cubed cheddar cheese.  It is the dressing in this recipe that is so good.  Sweet and tangy.  The rest can easily be adjusted to your family's taste.

I made this Macaroni Salad and tasted it before I added the Condensed milk. It tasted great.  I added the condensed milk and now its to sweet:( Next time I make this I will either leave out the 1/2 Cup sugar or the condensed milk.

I mostly hate macaroni salad.  This recipe made me fall in love again.  I took some of the other advice about reducing the amount of sugar.  Still was great.  I say play around with the ingredient amounts and make this Keeper Recipe!

Portions were good of veggies to macaroni but dressing was way to sweet and I only added one can of sweetened condensed milk and no sugar.  Had to modify by adding sour cream and fresh lemmon juice.

Best macaroni salad I have ever had! I even had leftovers 2 days later and it was still not dried out like many macaroni salads become. I took other's advice and left the sugar out completely, it was still plenty sweet.

Good recipe but way too sweet. I omitted all sugar and just added the 14z can of condensed milk and it was still too sweet for us. I will try it again and play with maybe adding 1/2 call on condensed milk and maybe 1/4-1/2 sugar.

Way to sweet..I omited the sugar just from reading the other comments and it is still plenty sweet. The color is great, but it needs more of a tang to be considered a macaroni salad, in fact, you could replace the veggies with fruit and call it a fruit sald and keep it sweet.

I have been searching for a macaroni salad with that sweet/tangy taste for some time. Have tried many without much luck - untill this recipe. THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE! I thought that 14 oz condensed milk was a bit much but added the whole amount. Cut the white sugar in half and added frozen peas. Very good!!

Very good, I did make a few modifications though.  I didn't spend much time chopping veggies as my favorite mac salad is simpler.  I only put in chopped carrots, seeded diced tomatoes and fresh chopped parsley.  I also did not use condensed milk, I added a 1 1/2 cups skim plus milk and a few more tbsp mayo, and rather than sugar I used splenda and only 1/4 cup.  It was creamy and not too sweet.  My family loved it and I plan to make this more often.

This is the first pasta salad i've ever made and it is DELICIOUS! I left out the sugar like so many other reviews mentioned, and it's just perfect. Crunchy, sweet, tangy. I used 1/4 cu white wine vinegar and 1/4 cup white vinegar just because I like white wine vinegar. I only used about 3/4 of my onion as well. Will 100% make again!

I could crawl into this bowl and die happy! Just finished making this for my son's bday party tomorrow and will have a hard time keeping out of it, it's so good.  I also skipped the sugar, as the sweetened condensed milk was sweet enough, oh and I added bacon......just for fun. It really didn't need it tho, I just had it ready to go, so I crumpled it in.

AWESOME salad!!  This is the first time I've ever made a mac salad and I have to say, I don't need to search for another recipe!  This was fabulous and SO easy!  I prepared it exactly as recipe called minus the celery b/c I was out.  
I refrigerated it only a good 5 hours before our picnic and it was perfect.

Looking at the excellent rating that this recipe gets, I know that I am certainly in a small miniority.  I was just shocked by how sweet it was.  Wow!  I even double-checked because although I am experienced in the kitchen, I thought I must have done something wrong.  Not the case.  I hate a vinegary too tart macaroni salad, I prefer them creamy and this one certainly is, but, as I say, it is just so sweet.

This was good, but definitely wayyy too sweet. I will make it again, but next time will try less sugar. I really liked the creaminess.

Yay!  So excited to find this recipe!  I had this salad once at a family reunion and didn't get the recipe and I have been searching for it since!!  It is very sweet but I think the sweetness goes so great with the peppers and it is a wonderful egg free version of macaroni salad!  Now the macaroni salad can stand out at a picnic instead of just being the not so impressive companion to the potato salad!!!  Thanks!

Loved this recipe.  I followed the suggestions of other reviews and omitted the sugar.  It's definitely not needed.  I would also use just a 1/2 of a large red onion.  Can't wait to bring it to the BBQ!

This is very good but was just a bit sweet for me so I added a litte more mayo and like another person commenting added some eggs, dry mustard, and paprika.

I think this is a good recipe... with a few modifications. I made it almost exact the first time. It's just too sweet. Even when I added some spicy brown mustard and paprika. Omit the sugar because the condensed milk is plenty sweet. Add spicy brown mustard, and paprika to taste and I think it's perfect.

This was delicious, but after eating it for awhile, it started to get a little too sweet for me. I even took out 1/4 of the sugar, 1/4 of the vinegar and a lot of the veggies. Just to many. I added more mayonaise later and it was really good. It would also improve if eggs were added.

Great macaroni salad. You really don't need all the sugar. Mushrooms are a great addition,also in addition to the green & red peppers throw in a little more yellow & orange peppers. What a pretty & very tasty salad. Thank You for thr recipe!

Very, very sweet - even without the sugar.  Next time I would add about 1 TBSP red pepper flakes to the dressing so it would be sweet and spicy, not just sweet.  If I even make it again....it was just okay for us.

This dish was great but I did leave out the sugar and only used 3/4 of the SCM. I made it a full day ahead of time and let it flavor up.I served it in an orange bowl and it looked beautiful too.Lots of compliments.Thanks Spiderella !

This was really great! I used whole wheat pasta, cause that's what my family likes, and just omitted the milk all together, leaving the sugar and vinegar the same, and it worked out wonderfully.

This was a HUGE hit. I cut the sugar and it was perfect. It is plenty sweet even when the sugar is cut in half. When you are not sure if you should serve cole slaw or macaroni salad, this is a great compromise. YUMMY!!!

Way too sweet.  I made the mistake of serving this at a BBQ without trying the recipe in advance.  The high rating was quite deceptive.  Looking forward to trying this recipe again with the recommended changes.

Kept the main ingredients to just a few changes... I used 1/2 an onion, about a 1/3 cup of condensed milk, did not add the sugar, instead of 1/2 cups of white vinegar I used 3 tablespoons... now this is the kicker!!!! instead of the salt and pepper... I used a new seasoning introduced to me by a co-worker "Don Sazon for Chicken" by now you are thinking 'WHAT!!!!! is she crazy? (well I thought of the same thing about myself) but let me tell you... it came out looking and tasting delicious... you may find Don Sazon at Food City stores in Arizona...or ?  Thank you for sharing your mom's macaroni recipe.

I have to say, I was very leary about making this when I read Sweetened condensed milk.  I couldn't believe taht it had so many stars... well THANK GOODNESS I tried it, it was GREAT, and I am SURE it will be a huge hit tomorrow at the PIG ROAST.  Thank you for the recipe.. Totally a KEEPER.  PS, I tried the sauce, prior to adding sugar, glad I did.  I personally don't feel it needs the sugar so I left it out.

delicious and slightly different than most. Nice and creamy.  It might be a bit sweet but you can reduse or omit the sugar or maybe use just condensed milk with sugar.

I had high hopes for this one. I used less sugar like most reviews suggested. The sweetness wasn't the problem-this dish had a strong onion taste & I even used half of the suggested amount of onion. I brought it to a bbq & one out of 10+ people liked it. :(

Made this for a friend; I've never done macaroni salad.  It tasted great!  As per a few of the reviews, I used half the sugar.  Great recipe!!

Sorry, this was way too sweet for our liking.  I eliminated the white sugar and used less than 1/4 of the can of sweetened condensed milk, as other reviewers suggested, but it was still really sweet.  I added some lemon juice for tartness, and that made it edible, but I would not make this again.

I made this salad for 50 people for a family reunion and everyone just loved it.  After reading other reviews, I did omit all the sugar because the sweetened condensed milk made this salad sweet enough.  Definitely would make this salad again!!

I was looking for a great macaroni salad to take to a soccer potluck, and this was it! I needed 24 servings and it was so easy to recalculate the amount on this site. I read the other reviews before making it, however. I also added dry mustard, paprika, green onion, and NO SUGAR. I suggest tasting the sauce before adding sugar and adjusting to preference. This salad is lovely and I'm sure the soccer families will love it.

One of the best macaroni salads out there.  Great for large gatherings and refrigerates well for 3 or 4 days.  But DEFINITELY reduce or omit the sugar.  I took it out all together and the salad was perfect.

this salad is great. made it last  night and I added the carrots this morning and gave it a stir and it is delicious. I added some crab and used only 1/4 can of the condensed milk and no sugar and it tastes really good, this one is a keeper. Thank you.

Excellent pasta salad!  I didn't have a green pepper, but used black olives and diced pepperoni instead.  Like others, I left out the sugar and it was pleanty sweet without it!  This is just the recipe I was looking for - far better than italian dressing pasta salad.  Great to make a day ahead of time.  Thanks!

Terrific. All the fresh veggies made this a winner. I did leave out the sugar; the sweetened condensed milk added just the right tough of sweetness. Also, I chopped in fresh roma tomatoes. We loved it!

I Brought this salad to a work pot-luck and got rave reviews. Only thing I changed was not adding the extra sugar and, the salad turned slightly orange from the carrots.

very good recipe, but I cut way back on the evaporated milk.  It was much too sweet with all that.  But the way I served it, it was very well received!

This is a delicious salad, it is very sweet though. I think the sauce would be ideal for cole slaw. Made with the right dishes though, this salad is perfect.

This was so yummy.   Everyone that tried it wanted the recipe but I decided since we all travel in the same circle not to give it out because then the salad wouldn't be "special" unless I make it.... silly as it sounds.  The most important part of the recipe is to let it sit overnight.

I made this salad for my in-laws birthday party.  It turned out great and everyone went back for seconds and thirds.  I thought that I'd end up with a lot to bring home but didn't have any left.  The potato salad that someone else had brought ended up going back home with them.  This was really easy to make, a big plus for me with two small children running around!  Thanks for the recipe.

I used reduced-fat mayo to lighten it up.  Also peas instead of carrots and no onions. Also listened to other reviews and left out the sugar.  It turned out great, will definitely make again.  Expect it to be sweet, but it was definitely not too sweet for me when I left out the sugar.

This was like a deli Amish macaroni salad to me. I cut the sugar in half and was kind of freaked at how sweet the dressing was but once it sat overnight (as recommended in the recipe) it all mellowed into a delicious macaroni salad. My only adjustment other than cutting the sugar was to add celery seed. Definitely worth trying!

One of the best macaroni salads I've ever made.  People go out of their way to call me later for the recipe.  And very easy, too.  Just remember to use a dry-measure measuring cup for the sugar, and a wet-measure measuring cup for the vinegar.

This is really good if you like your macaroni salad to taste sweet.  It is too sweet though, next time I will add 1/2 the sugar or less because the condensed milk is also extremely sweet.
