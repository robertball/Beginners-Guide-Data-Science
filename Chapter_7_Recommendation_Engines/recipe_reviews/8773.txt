There's only three words to describe this, Terrible, Terrible and more Terrible. My husband thought it was so bad, he threw it in the trash. In another review someone said the onion overpowered it, they were right. Everything is wrong with this recipe. Yuck.

Oh boy.  There is something wrong with this!  When I was compiling the soup, chicken, etc. mixture, I was so excited anticipating that the end result was going to be true comfort food.  But, I felt like I was eating a  "crunch casserole" instead.  If I were EVER to attempt this again, I think the fix is to precook almost everthing instead of just the chicken.  Even after baking longer than what the recipe called for, the celery and onions weren't anywhere near done.  Sorry!

Very good casserole.  Served it to a ladies group along with salad and dessert and had a lot of positive feed back along with several requests for the recipe.  I'd definitely serve it again.

Yummy!  Very good chicken cassarole & one that's a hit with kids -and- adults.  Only thing I changed, was to reduce one of the cans of soup by a half and instead, added in the same amount of sour cream ;-).   Excellent mix of ingredients Barb!

I have made this many times and we love it.  I usually don't add pimentos as I never have them in the house.  Also my hubby does not like mushrooms so I omit those but I add extra veggies like carrots or fresh red pepper.  I also only use 1/2 to 1/3 of the butter called for for the stuffing and add chicken broth to make 1 cup.

This was a very tasty dish.  I found that I needed to bake mine a little longer than the recipe stated, but it was still delicious.  I don't have children so am unable to rate it for kid friendliness.  It will be made many times in this house.

So, So. I don't think I will be making this one again. To much onion, it overpowers. A half an onion would be enough. Very salty as well.
