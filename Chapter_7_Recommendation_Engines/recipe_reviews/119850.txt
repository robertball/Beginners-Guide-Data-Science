I made this as written and it was very bland with not enough chili.  After adding an additional can of chili, a generous amount of chili powder, and garlic powder and onion powder (instead of the dried onion) and salt, it was very good!  We sprinkled cheese on top of our servings.  As written, it would only honestly be 2 stars, but if you spice it up it's more like 4 or even 5.  We liked it a lot and I'll make it again with my variations.  The cream soup is a great addition I wouldn't have thought of.  Also instead of dirtying 3 dishes (why?), I cooked the macaroni in a pot, drained it, then added the other ingredients to the noodles in the pot and heated it through on the stove without baking it.

Very easy, quick and budget friendly. We were nearly out of food with no money for groceries when I saw this recipe, and thank goodness I did!   Changes I made: I added a can of corn, some taco seasoning, and some chopped garlic when heating the soups. I stirred everything together and served that way (without baking). So quick and tasty for what it is!

This was a great recipe. Easy and fast and kids friendly. I just used my left over chili the can of cream of mushroom, cheese and minced onion. I also sprinkled some Parmesan cheese on it.

The kids looooved it! I didn't bake it. Just mixed it all together in a big saute pan. It tasted slightly bland so I added a little tomato sauce and salt/pepper to taste. Speedy!!!

I made this last night and we thought it was pretty good. It's not a company dish, but great kid friendly dish. The only changes I made were to add a can of kidney beans and used "wagon wheel" shaped pasta.

My kids devour this.  We use low fat cream of celery soup, turkey chili, and whole wheat pasta to try to keep it a tiny bit healthier.  Everyone eats it up!

I've got to admit, when I first looked at this recipe I didn't think it looked very appetizing. But, it was late, boyfriend and I were really hungry and I'm really trying to avoid takeout/restaurants. I'm really glad I tried this!  Like others have said, it's not gourmet or something you'd make for a dinner party, but it's very quick and very tasty, and the ingredients are usually sitting in the pantry. I used a chicken chili with beans, because that was what I had. I don't think I used a whole cup of cheddar cheese; I didn't really measure. While mixing the chili mixture I added liberal amounts of garlic and onion powder, just because that's what I usually do.  I have a feeling this will pop up again soon!

We love this recipe.  It's perfect for my three children, 7, 4, and 2.  No one fusses about it, and we usually don't have any leftovers.  Thank you!

I have attempted a chili mac before with basically a box of mac & cheese and a can of chili.  It was okay.  When I found this recipe I thought I would give it a go and it was very good.  I used a Chunky Grilled Steak Chili which I think really perked this one up.  It is definitely a good recipe when you don't have a lot of time or when chili and mushroom soup are all you have in your cupboard!!  :D  Very yummy.

Good recipe.  Like the previous poster, not fancy, but very good and easy.
