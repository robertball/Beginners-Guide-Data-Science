This is almost identical to my mothers recipe, the only real difference is that she adds a little onion powder. Mom boils the potatoes "with their jackets on" the day before and then uses a large dice instead of slices... Super delicious!! Thanks for the recipe :)

I cooked these home fries in my cast iron skillet. I actually added two tablespoons of bacon grease to the skillet with the butter when I sauteed the onion as well as a good amount of fresh minced garlic. I sprinkled the potatoes with Johnny's Seasoning Salt instead of plain salt. The boys flipped over these home fries. I served them with "Egg Flipped Over" and homemade vanilla-glazed chocolate doughnuts. The great thing about home fries is a) they're really hard to mess up, b) they almost always make for a heartier breakfast, which is key when you're feeding a husband and two growing boys and c) you can totally make them personal to your family.

Wow -- just saw this same "type" of recipe featured on PBS 'Breakfast Special" and they showed a restaurant in Westerville Ohio I believe it was called Best Sandwiches (?) and the owner said the secret to the home fries is to put bacon drippings on them...made the difference!! thanks for sharing!

I have done this many times with left over potatoes. For true diner type potatoes I would also add color and flavor with a pinch or two of paprika or season salt and garlic powder.  And, half the butter can be subtituted for half oil for an even crispier hashbrown.

Similar to how I grew up eating them~but we used bacon drippings instead of butter.  The key, I think , is a perfectly seasoned cast iron pan. Nothing healthy about this recipe but they are good!

thanks so much.  this is the best "secret" to know i have now gotten so many raves at brunches.  hubby always asks if i am "baking extra" when i do potatoes now.  i season them with a variety of spices or herbs depending on what they're to go with.  i've also done fresh grated parm cheese, and one fine leftover day we used them to make chili cheese fries: stellar.

Exactly what I was looking for. I had leftover baked potatoes that I wanted to use up. I did add a sprinkle of garlic powder.

Delicious!  Easy to prepare.  Good, nourishing, home-style cooking.  Like several of the others, we used bacon fat saved from cooking bacon.  We sliced the potatoes a bit thicker too, works either way.  We also made a MAYONNAISE-SOUR CREAM-RANCH DRESSING-GARLIC SAUCE TO PUT ON TOP OF POTATOES AND TO DIP ACCOMPANYING SAUSAGES IN.  I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THESE DELICIOUS POTATOES.

Good basic recipe.  Whenever I make baked potatoes I always bake a couple of extra potatoes so we can have Home Fries the next day.  If you enjoy them extra crispy, like me, add some shortening to the skillet.  "Bacon grease" is a must if you've made bacon, too.  Use a combo of any BG, shortening and butter and you can't go wrong.  (I don't use vegetable oil, as it tends to make the potatoes bland and "heavy" tasting.)

I thought these were just okay. I tried to make it exactly as written. The potato slices were a bit fragile when frying, and either I didn't use a full 2 T. of butter, or I needed more, because I thought it was much too dry to fry properly. Since the results were somewhat bland, I added a few drops of habanera sauce after I plated these potatoes. They were okay, just nothing special; I think I'm partial to crispier, slightly wetter/greasier potatoes.

These were pretty good.  The baked potatoes were a little mashed when I was cutting them.  Must have cooked for too long.  I had 4 in the microwave and so increased the time to 7 minutes each side...next time I'll stick with the 5 min.

Be sure you refrigerate the potatoes till you use them. They can spoil just like any food left out too long. These are so good diced, sliced, or shredded.

the secret, which I never knew, is to bake the potatoes first (in the microwave is a great time/oven saver) and cook them on medium in an even amount of bacon grease and butter!

Been doing this for AGES - this makes the BEST home fries ever.  If you are doing one of those oversized farmer's breakfast (which we all need once in a while for comfort food!), you can do this in a tiny bit of bacon grease for flavor - just pour a little off the bacon and into your home fries pan and spread so that it is sparing.  You can also bump it up in a big way with green or red pepper along with the onion, chopped ham if you have leftovers, shredded cheddar cheese ... use your cabinet and fridge as inspiration!

To make this recipe easier and just as tasty, slice your  baked potatoes and place in plastic bag with olive oil, coat and  place on cookie sheet lined with non-stick foil, season and bake at 375 -400 until crispy. Enjoy!

This is almost identical to the way I have always made them.  Just bake extra potatoes while you are baking for another meal and refrigerate the rest until ready to fry.  Leave the skins on for added flavor and color.  Thanks!

I do this often, ever so good.  My Mother would cut up raw potato's and fry, I find they taste so fresh and they don't take long to do.  Add oil and throw in some sliced potato's , they DON'T  have to be in a single layer.  Keep flipping them until they are golden brown and most of them are crisp.  I sometimes will add chopped onion just before they are done, otherwise it will burn.  Use a med-high heat for the potato's.

All the years I made breakfast hash browns from scratch I could kick myself. This is the only way I do hash browns now. My family isn't a big fan of onions with breakfast potatoes so I leave it out. When I make hash browns for another meal I not only add the onions but red peppers as well. I'm not a fan of cooking in a microwave so I always bake extra baked potatoes in the oven. This is so simple. Thank you for a great tip!

We had some leftover grilled potatoes, (recipe from this website)! and i used those for this dish the next day. I made sure to use my cast iron skillet as that makes charring the potatoes to a crisp super easy. I dont mean burning the potatoes, just getting some of the little bits nice and crunchy, and it was good that way.

We really loved this recipe. I wanted mine a little rustic so I caramelized the onions in a little avocado oil , Earth Balance and just a pinch of sugar to speed up the process. I choose to roughly chop the potatoes instead of thinly slicing them and seasoned with just a little Mrs. Dash.  This will be a repeat at our house. Thanks for sharing.

I was looking for a way to use leftover Greek lemon roasted potatoes from this site and came upon this recipe. It's delicious and a great starting point! I cooked the onion in a combo of butter and bacon grease. After the potatoes were about half done frying, I also added just a bit of seasoning salt, smoked paprika and garlic powder along with the salt and pepper. Now I want go get some potatoes just to make this! Excellent recipe, Gowins!

I've been making home fries for years and they are delicious when made with bacon grease instead of butter, and, (if you can tolerate) with extra onions. Never tried with baked potatoes, but will now. Thanks for the great recipe.

Simple and good.  As you can tell by my picture, I used red potatoes - just a personal preference.

This has become a weekend breakfast menu item in my home.  My husband and I miss our NJ diners living in the south.  He loves these home fries and reminds him of a diner in NJ! Delicious!  This morning I added a little garlic and paprika.  Just perfect, thank you for sharing.

Well thanks Gowins for making my taters look bad!! My family went nuts on these! And if I'm perfectly honest, I'll have to admit that I liked them too. I did add a clove or two of garlic, which I thought made them perfect. I think this is a good base. You can add herbs and spices to make these wonderful potatoes yours. I love recipes like this!!

Even better use leftover salt potatoes cut in to chunks. Have used for homefries in different kitchens I've worked and customers have gone nuts over them

Delicious.  I have been making this for 50 years, but I add chopped bacon and some chopped green pepper to the potatoes while frying in butter and oil. (or chopped chili pepper for a Southwestern diversion - Mary J.)

I used onion flakes ans some red pepper to give it some kick.  I have a little one, and she hates onions, so I have to sneak them in where I can.

This is a good way to use up extra baked potatoes.  I recommend peeling them first.

Have made my potato's this way for years and like my Mom, the key is to use bacon grease.  Crispy outside and tender inside.
