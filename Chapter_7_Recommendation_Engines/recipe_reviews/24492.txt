Nice flavor combo's...I used Seagram's and Midori, but felt it was necessary to double the pineapple juice.  Would make again.

A great mix of flavors, Once the whiskey ran out, I used some leftover vodka and the shots went down even smoother! Great shots for a party!

Loved this--the whiskey is strong at first sip but it mellows out at the end.  It's very tasty and my husband dubbed this his new favorite cocktail!
