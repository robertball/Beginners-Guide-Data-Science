This recipe is hands down the BEST ever! I'm not much of a cook, but when I made this my fiance called me "The Chicken & Dumpling Queen". We like ours nice and thick, so I used 3 cans of the Cream of Chicken Soup, 3 cups of chicken broth, and cut the veggies into small pieces. I made my own dumplings because I don't like the box stuff.
Take 1 3/4 cups of all purpose flour, 1/2 tspn baking soda, salt,3 tablespoons of veg. shortening, and 3/4 cups of low-fat buttermilk. Add all ingredients, stir til you get the consistency of dough.  roll out dough and cut into 2 inch rectangles. Add to boiling stew and simmer for 10-15 minutes. It's really good on a cold night. It Rocks!!! Thanks Claire..I couldn't have impressed my fiance without your recipe!

Very, very bland!  Before adding the dumplings, I tasted the "stew" and couldn't believe how bland it actually was.....  I used chicken broth, in place of the water (next time I'll use chicken stock vs broth for more flavor), added another can of cream of chicken w/herbs, 2 tsp of onion powder, 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1/2 tsp of garlic salt, 1 tsp of black powder and 2 tsp of poultry seasoning.  Helpful hint:  DO NOT "drop" your dumplings to close together ~ to cook properly they need room to breathe and the liquid needs to bubble up between them.  Better with the listed changes.  This recipe has potential, but definitely needs spicing up!

Cut the potatoes into 8ths (they don't cook well if you don't). And be certain to chop the carrots and onions into bite size pieces -- you will spend your time eating cutting the pieces with a fork if you don't do this.  Be absolutely sure the stew is boiling before you put the dumplings in (they will be soggy if you don't).  1/2 the dumpling recipe is plenty (recipe on the side of Bisquick box).  You can reheat the stew the next night and make new dumplings.

Great comfort food!  I would recommend making less dough for the dumplings than what is called for in the recipe, unless you are cooking in a really wide pan.  I had made the full amount of dough and had way too much, so I made biscuits while the stew was cooking.  For those that have never made chicken and dumplings before, do not drop too much dough on the top, the liquid needs to simmer around the dumplings in order for them too cook properly.

The ratings don't lie!! This recipe is easy and makes your house smell yummy and wow!! It's really declicious!! I have made this again three times and it's great comfort food for the winter!! Don't change a thing! But if you don't have baking mix you can make your own with 2 cups flour, 4tsps baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 Tbl butter (soften first), 2/3 cup milk. Drop by tablespoon in the stew, cover and it will 'bake' for ten minutes or so. YUMMY!!

This is definately a keeper.  Instead of making dumplings, I used refridgerated biscuits and tour them into small peices, then dropped them in the soup the last 10 minutes.  I added one can of chicken broth (gives it the missing flavor) and omit the pea's.

This was unbelievable! I made it last night and that only thing different that I did was add about a 1/4 teaspoon of basil and about a 1/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper to add a little heat. All I can say is....it was a huge hit in my house. Hubby asked....are there any leftovers? Needless to say...that is what he took for lunch today. My son had two bowls and asked if I would make it again next week...smiles. This one is definitely a keeper. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I made this recipe for the first time last night and thought it was just okay. Too many potatoes and not enough chicken flavor. I ended up adding 3 chicken boullion cubes, an extra can of cream of chicken soup and a can of chicken broth and it still seemed to need more "chicken flavor".  I think I'll try to make it one more time and use a bag of frozen mixed vegetables instead of the potatoes. The dumplings came out great and you definitely have to use half the amount the recipe calls for because it makes way too many. Also I followed the Bisquick box intsructions and cooked them uncovered for 10 minutes, then covered them for an addtional 10 minutes and they came out perfect.  My daughter really liked it and she is usually pretty picky. The best chicken flavoring to use is L.B. Jamison's Soup Base and I guarantee it's the best base you will ever use! Do not buy the sodium free, to me it's just not as good. I usually don't need to add any salt to my chicken soup recipe either.

I have been looking for an easier version of chicken and dumplings that still tasted good.  This is it.  I got to use chicken breast!  I would suggest cutting the chicken breast in pieces before it cooks, and cutting the potatoes small.  Use a BIG pot.  The dumplings pushed the lid off of my medium soup pot.  Add a can of chicken broth if you want a soupier meal.  The kids actually ate this.  This will feed a big family!

I found this to be a very wonderful dish, very much in the "comfort food" realm (how can you go wrong when there are dumplings!!!).  My dinner guest was suitably impressed and satisfied. Thanks for sharing!!!  I think next time I'll cut the onions smaller and use more salt and pepper, but that's strictly a personal preference.  I agree with the others, dumplings don't keep well; make just what you need, save any leftover "stew", and make new ones when you re-serve.

Excellent Stew!  Instead of going to all the trouble of making the biscuit dough, just by any brand of buttermilk biscuits in the can like Pillsbury (or Store Brand).  Cut each biscuit into eights with a pair of scissors right into the pot of broth and simmer with the stew for another 15-20 minutes.  Turns out wonderful!

My whole family loves this recipe.  I was in a rush one day and this was the request for dinner, so I bought a rotisserie chicken from a local market removed the skin and the bones and added it.  I also sauteed the carrots, celery and onion before adding to the pot.  This took about an hour off of the total cook time and it was very flavorful.

Perfectly fine basic chicken ana dumplings recipe, but what makes it "Irish"? Do the chickens have to cluck with a brogue?

so disappointing. please DO NOT rate a recipe 5 stars if you made a bunch of big changes and then enjoyed the dish. based on this recipe with no changes, this was very bland and the dumpling made with bisquick were pretty awful. the leftovers just sat in the fridge - in a house of 7, no one wanted them.

I have made Chicken and Dumplings for over 20 years and all of my friends and family request it every winter.  This is better than my original recipe!!  I used MARTYSTARS dumpling recipe (Take 1 3/4 cups of all purpose flour, 1/2 tspn baking soda, salt,3 tablespoons of veg. shortening, and 3/4 cups of low-fat buttermilk. Add all ingredients, stir til you get the consistency of dough. roll out dough and cut into 2 inch rectangles. Add to boiling stew and simmer for 10-15 minutes.) and it was perfect!!!

We loved this recipe. I did make a few changes though. Instead of using water, I used vegetable broth and I omitted the potatos. I cooked it in the crock pot on high for about 6 hours. The dumplings I did in boiling water on the stove then transferred them to the crock pot during the last half hour.

So easy for a weeknight if you do it in a slow cooker! The dumplings were a little too much, I would use less as it was pretty much all dumplings with those measurements. Next time I'll try doing biscuits on top like someone else suggested. The chicken though was outta this world!!! This is one of the few time I didnt and wouldnt change a recipe. I would make this as a stew too and add over rice. I added a little more salt. I read other reviews that said it was bland, this is not the case! A recipe is only as good as your ingredients, dont use knock off soup and expect it to be great. Spend the extra fifty cents and spring for the campbells!

This was an excellent version of chicken and dumplings (and I have not previously had any success with dumplings).  The only suggestion I would make is to cut back on the dumplings, because the amount called for in the recipe completely covers the top of a 4 quart dutch oven and there doesn't seem to be enough room in the pot for all of them.  I have made this twice and it is very tasty--even the kids (6 and 4) love it.

This is definitely a fabulous comfort food!  My fiance loved this.  Make it only when you have a lot of time on your hands.  The longer you cook this, the better it tastes.

I made some modifications to this recipe.  I used a "can" more water than the recipe called for.  I didn't have any poultry seasoning so I used garlic powder and Mrs. Dash.  I also added tons of salt and pepper gradually.  

My fiance LOVES chicken so used a bunch of those frozen boneless chicken tenderloins from the wholesale club (Tyson).  I did cut it in chunks like the other reviewers suggested.  I am not sure how much I used.  With the tenderloins you only have to do step 1 for 30 mins instead of the 1 hr 1/2.  Along with the frozen peas, I added other mixed veggies (carrots, corn, green beans mixture).  Lastly, for the dumplings ... I used the dumplings recipe on the Bisquick box.  It's 2 cups of Bisquick and 2/3 cups of milk.  Yum Yum!

Nice, warm meal to eat on a cold, rainy day. Based on reviews from others: I used 3 cups of broth instead of the water and used 3 cans of condensed cream of chicken soup. Great texture and tasted even great as leftovers. Enjoyed by all the family too.

This is a great recipe!  I took the other reviewers advice and diced the onion and celery and used more pepper.  I also cut the potatoes smaller and simmered for a longer period of time than the recipe called for.  In addition to the 3c. of water, I added 1 c. chicken broth.  It was just the right amount of liquid.  I also used the dumpling recipe on the box.  Wonderful!!

Great recipe!  My son-in-law loved it and my husband who normally doesn't like stews loved it too.  I did make some changes...instead of onion I used leek and I used 2 white potatoes and one large sweet potato.  I also cut the chicken while still raw to avoid shredding.  I will make this again!

Excellent!  Even though my dumplings came out a little mushy (which it most likely my fault) we really enjoyed this recipe.  Next time I will make the dumplings really small because they grew to be double the size when they cooked a little.  I wasn't expecting that to happen.  Overall, this was a great dinner.

Completely delicious! I had tried several chicken and dumplings recipes previously, and was never pleased with the results. This one had everything I was looking for--delicious, comforting flavor, creamy broth.sauce, doughy biscuits, and tender veggies. It takes awhile to make but is very easy and appropriate for both experienced and inexperienced cooks. I bought Jiffy Baking Mix for the dumplings and was very happy with the way they turned out--fluffy, soft, and floury. I garnished with some high-quality dried parsley, and it added just a bit more to the flavor and made this dish look even prettier. This one is a keeper.

This is an excellent jumping off recipe. I used a whole chicken I had on hand and stewed it in 6 cups water. I only used one can of soup mix. I also made homemade dumplings cuz I have no biscuit mix. Very tasty indeed. Thanks!

I kinda feel bad rating this cause I changed it so much. I added an extra can of cream of chicken soup and a can of cream of celery. I also left out the potatoes. I used a different dumpling recipe (the one from Chicken and Dumplings III) cause I didn't have any baking mix on hand. That said, this was very good and I will definately make it again. The whole family loved it. Thanks for sharing, and sorry I had to change it up so much!

This recipe was the best ive tried!! Even better than my moms (but I wont tell her that :) ) Being me I did make a few changes, I used a pacakge of cut up whole chicken and boiled that (bones and everything) until I could peel the chicken off the bone.  To me using this kind of chicken adds more flavour!! I added some poultry seasoning and to the chicken as it cooked. Then instead of using water I used the broth that the chicken made. A great recipe!!

I really like this recipe.  It's a great variation of an old time favorite.  I don't make the dumplings from scratch...I just tear biscuits into peices and use them instead with wonderful results.  My hubby isn't too crazy about this dish and neither is my grandfather.  When he was in the service many many years ago, they made this quite a bit and he found chicken feathers in his bowl.  That completey ruined it for him.  Sorry Pape...I guess that just means there's more for me.  Thanks Claire.

For a real meat 'n' potatoes meal, this is quite good. It's hardy with lots of vegatables and very tasty. I'd suggest using more celery, onions and carrots and fewer potatoes, though.

DELISH! This is SO simple, filling and comforting. I'm not sure what's Irish about this (maybe the potatoes???), but after eating every last drop of the large bowl in front of me, I really don't care. :) I just wouldn't call this chicken and dumplings.... To me, this is chicken stew. Whatever it is to you, know that it's super yummy! I've been battling a terrible head cold all weekend. A bowlful of warm stew was exactly what I needed. :) This recipe is pretty flawless as is, but I do have a couple of suggestions to make it even better. First, instead of water, substitute 3 c. chicken broth or add a few chicken bullion cubes or granules. Second, to speed prep, substitute baby carrots for sliced ones (FYI, 5-6 baby carrots = 1 medium-sized one). Third, cut your potatoes into eighths rather than quarters (they'll cook faster). My only other suggestion is to add 1 t dried parsley flakes (or your favorite spice) to your biscuit dough. It REALLY improves them. As other reviewers suggested, only make HALF the biscuit dough. Using my large (3T) PC scoop, I got exactly 6 biscuits out of mine - and they puffed to perfection. I can't imagine making the full amount of dough called for. The formed biscuits need space to simmer properly (they won't if touching). I barely had enough space for mine and I used a HUGE 6 qt. LeCreuset Dutch oven! All in all, this was a WONDERFUL meal. Thanks for sharing your recipe, CLAIRELLEN! :-)

So delicious that my picky 13 year old had thirds! I was skeptical because I usually steer away from recipes with canned/boxed ingredients and I frequently make chicken pot pie from scratch so I didn’t think this would impress me. BUT....I was super wrong and this was insanely good!! Make sure to add plenty of salt and pepper since those are the primary spices and there are a lot of bland ingredients (chicken, potatoes, etc). Also check seasonings before adding the dumplings and make sure it is rapidly boiling before dropping them in.

This soup has a WONDERFUL flavor.  I did as other reviewers suggested and cut all the vegetables and the chicken into bite-size pieces (I actually diced the onion).  I'll make this again for sure.

This,was pretty good. I added a few items based on others reviews: one more can of cream of celery, one tsp of lemon pepper, 2 bouillon cubes and. 3 tsps of lemon juice. I only used 2 cups of bisquick with one cup of milk and an added tsp of garlic salt.  It was more than enough dumplings. 
Nice Sunday night dinner.

So Good!!!  I made a few changes only bc I didn't have time to 'test' this meal first!!  I could only find a 16oz bag of peas, I added a half tsp pepper, upped the poultry seasoning, and added about a tsp each of oregano and basil.  It was really good and my revisions didnt change the base of the recipe thats why I gave the full 5 stars!!  Next time I plan on adding an extra can of soup and maybe an extra cup of water so there's more juice to do more dumplings... bc the dumplings are SO good!!  Just not enough room to add all that dough!!  I did it in sections.. maybe 10 dumplings, then as I dished it out I added more!!  I'll use the extra dough for biscuits!  Thanks so much for sharing!!  This recipe is a sure keeper!

Absolutely adored this stew and hubby raved a "10"!  Followed the recipe with the exception of added spices/herbs like fresh parsley, celery seed, and more poultry seasoning.  I did not use the dumplings, served over hot biscuits.  Just wonderful.  Great base for chicken and noodles, next time I will skip the taters (I think that's the Irish!) and add kluski noodles.  A keeper and a winner.  Thanks, CLAIRELLEN.

Not that you need another 5 star review but I have to tell you, if there were more stars, I'd be all over it!  I made this yesterday for 2 sick grandkids and a mommy who had to work late.  I used my 1 can cream of chicken soup and one bouillion cube, didn't have peas, used 6 chicken thighs. Added a pinch of salt to an increased amount of baking mix and a lot of black pepper.  This made a 4 quart Dutch oven full of chicken and dumplings. My daughter took what was left to work; about 3/4  cup for her lunch.  I'm doing it AGAIN today for my mine and hubby's dinner.  This is totally delicious.  Great find and a terrific save! Thank you.

Tasty!  My late Mother-in-Law made the best Chicken and Dumplings, but my husband liked this one almost as much.  I put everything but the dumpling ingredients in the slow cooker and let it cook while I was at work.  The first time I tried using the baking mix and turning it on high, but it made a mess.  The second time I dipped out some of the broth and cooked the dumplings in a seperate pan.  The consistency was fine that way.

This recipe turned my husband into a Chicken and Dumpling lover. I've made this many a time and my favorite way to make it is with a pound of baby carrots, 3 (diced)potatoes, minced garlic and home made dumplings. Thank you CLAIRELLEN!

This was so good!!  The only thing I did differently was subbed corn for peas, only because my son doesn't like peas.  One of the best parts was how it smelled when it was cooking. I have been told by my family that they want this as a staple this winter.  Thanks Claire!

This was GREAT!! Like others, I used broth, but didn't add any extra... I prefer it to be thick. Used i can cream of celery and i cream of chicken, omitted potatoes and doubled up on carrots. Subbed frozen green beans for peas. I love salt and pepper, so i added it liberally at the end, but it was good to begin with. Will make this again and again... it's for sure a keeper!NOTE>>> if you like dumplings, be careful as the dumplings will eat up all the broth. I've had better luck doing the dumplings on the side in a separate pot of broth

This was a really simple and tasty recipe, just like a traditional Pennsylvania Dutch dinner!  I used fat free chicken broth instead of water, and reduced fat cream of chicken soup.  In order to save time, I also used a roll of Pillsbury refrigerator biscuits, cut into quarters for the dumplings.

Like many of the other reviewers- family of 4 with 4 opions and 4 thumbs up (a really big thumbs up from my hubby!). My daughter said- "Mom, this is just like Thanksgiving in a bowl!"
I did change a few things- but mostly beacause I didn't want to go to the grocery store. I only had one can of cream of chicken so I used one can of cream of mushroom too. I only had a bag of mixed frozen veggies (you know the kind-corn, green beans, peas and corn)- so I used that plus the fresh carrots. Only had one good onion left and 2 stalks of celery! But I did add - in addition to the poultry seasoning- fresh thyme and fresh rosemary and used fresh rosemary in the dumpling recipe (I used the "from scratch" one in the bread section- just type in "dumpling" in the search and choose only the bread section- it's the only one that came up! Super easy and YUMMY.
It did benefit from more a bit more salt and pepper at the table, but it was REALLY YUMMY. Can't wait to try it again with all the onion and celery it is supose to have.

I made this for an Irish potluck at hubby's work (didn't even know chicken and dumplings is irish) and doubled the batch, all except the dumplings, as I read others thought it had too much dumpling mix.  I also used a bit less potato, and diced them into bite size pieces, as with the onion, to make it easier to eat.  The flavor is great, very homey.  Definitely a mellow dish, and not heavy on the spices, but a nice meal for a cold rainy night....I'll have to try it during the winter!  Thanks!

This was our first time eating dumplings. The flavor was really good. My kids said it tasted just like really thick chicken noodle soup but they liked the soup better.

This was a HIT! My boyfriend absolutely loved it. My only complaint....The dumplings absorbed to much of the broth...Next time I will cut the dumpling mixture in half and maybe add 1 can of chicken broth...

Wow!!! I read all the reviews n made my own twist on it... my whole house loved it and the kids asked for seconds,which was amazing! Even my picky eater! I put it in the crock pot with:two cans of cream of chix with herbs, 1 1/2 cans of chix stock, 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, 4 or 5 shakes of crushed red pepper flakes,1/4 teaspoon of poulty seasoning, seasoned the chix tenderloins with parsley,poulty seasoning,salt,pepper, a lil ground garlic, then put them in the crock pot, I also added 1/2 cup of celery,chopped baby carrots, 1/2 onion, let that all cook for 5 or 6 hours then I made dumplings with bisquick mix (follow directions on box) then added ten dumplings (bout the size of a golf ball) into the crock pot with the lid off for 15 mins, then covered it n let cook for 1hr. Then 10 mins before serving I added canned sweet peas, oh boy was it YUMMY! Will definately be a recipe I make more often....5 stars by far!

I was craving some comfort food, used the Bisquick dumpling recipe, and the result was WONDERFUL.  Thank you for a great recipe.  Can't remember the last time I made chix and dumplings, but it was a looong time ago.  Glad I found this.

Perfect dinner for a cold rainy day.  I read the reviews and tweaked it a bit; chopping my potatoes into smaller, bite sized cubes , using a combination of herbs for the poultry seasoning as I didn't have any on hand.  (I used a sprinkle each of paprika, rosemary, thyme, parsley and basil.)  Oh, and I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breast meat...again....what I had on hand.  I followed the dumpling recipe on the Bisquick box (2 cups mix and 2/3 cup milk)  It made 10 dumplings and they came out perfect....light and fluffy.  Not sure where others have had problems.  My dough was a bit on the stiff side and I used a dinner tablespoon to portion it out into the pot.  I did add an extra cup of water because I used more potatoes as I needed to use them up.  I had plenty of liquid left.  I saved this one to my recipe box.  Yummy!

Delicious, comforting & satisfying! I modified the recipe as follows: I prepared it in my slow cooker on high. I used only 1 onion, which was plenty. Next time I make this I'm going to chop them up a little smaller though, as I don't care for big chunks of onion. Instead of water I dissolved 3 rounded tsp. of chicken granules into 3 C. of water to make a broth and omitted the 1 tsp. of salt called for in the recipe. Next time I'll reduce the amount of broth as it came out on the thin side and I like my 'gravy' a little thicker. Even though I'm a total meat 'n potatoes gal, I left out the taters because I figured the dumplings would be enough, and they were. I used fresh carrots and frozen peas. I also halved the dumpling/milk mix and added garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and parsley. After mixing, I dropped the dumplings by heaping tablespoon into my crockpot and cooked for approx. 30 mins. Perfect! Will definitely make again!

Was looking for something that was was a cross between chicken noodle soup and chicken and dumplings....this was perfect.  Used the chicken stock I made cooking a whole chicken instead of water and biscuits instead of making dumplings.  Very good!

Ilm 62 years old and have never made chicken and dumplings.  I made this for my son and daughter-in-law when they brought they're new baby home.  We all loved it.  I personally can live without poultry seasoning, so next time I'll omit it...but I definitely had no trouble making a pig out of myself over the recipe as is.  Thanks for sharing...it's a keeper.

My family loved this dish. I will use chicken stock next time instead of the water like suggested. I cooked this in my dutch oven on my stovetop. I made the dumplings according to my baking mix directions and they turned out great. My 3 year old loved the chicken and he never eats anything with a gravy or sauce so I was thrilled.

This was okay. Easy, but overall takes along time.  Bf raved about it, but no one else really seemed to love it.  Edible, but will not make again, or if I do, I won't be adding dumplings..maybe make biscuits on the side.

This was good.  Not great.  Good.  Especially after letting it sit a few days.  I like cooking meals entirely from scratch, so I normally won't use recipes that call for canned soup, but I needed an Irish dish with chicken in a hurry and this one sounded good.  Definitely use chicken broth instead of water because like another reviewer said, the dish just isn't "chicken-y" enough as is.  Nevertheless, I'll probably make this again using chicken stock, and I might even try my hand at making a homemade condensed soup base.

This is fantastic!  My grandma always used to make chicken and dumplings, and this brought me right back to my childhood.  And it's a cheap meal!  I made a couple of changes: since my husband hates peas, I added corn instead; and instead of baking mix, I used the dumpling recipe from "Polish Chicken and Dumplings" on this site.  The dumplings came out better than I could have imagined.  Will make again and again this winter!

I followed this recipe as stated.  The flavor was good, the vegetables need to be cut in smaller portions, and two onions seem a bit too much ( I only used one) Next time I make this dish I will make the dumplings smaller and add to the stew.  Once cooked then pour the dumpling mixture over the chicken and vegetables.  The stew needs to be close to a med. boil and not simmered.  My dumplings were not cooked in the 10 minutes covered.  Uncovered turned out the same, I had to keep turning the dumplings to cook them.  Hope I get better results next time. Looked and sounded like a great dish!!

This is my first review!  My husband does not like ANYTHING with a "cream of..." soup in it, ever.  I made this tonight - couple small alterations for what I had on hand - no carrots, added corn, used chicken broth instead of water, otherwise as written.  I actually made it tonight for dinner tomorrow, and once it was done, I couldn't keep my husband and daughter away from it!  Just a really good, easy fun recipe using mostly kitchen staples.  Still took some time and babysitting of the pot, but that's the fun part.  After about 4 compliments from DH I asked if he even realized it had cream of chicken soup in it.  He had no idea and it didn't change his view of the recipe.  Next time I would definitely add carrots for color, but really if you use what you have on hand it's very adaptable.  Thanks a bunch!

Delicious!  Very hearty and homecooked taste.  For the broth, I used 3 cans of cream of chicken soup and 3 cans of chicken broth - the consistency was great!  I also seasoned the dumplings with sage, thyme and garlic before dropping them in the soup.

Heaven!  So melt-in-your-mouth good.  I added 3 cans of soup and 4 cans of water and instead of poultry seasoning, I used italian seasoning.  Also I used a homemade dumpling recipe for fluffy, yummy dumplings.  1 3/4c of flour, 2 tsp baking powder & 1/2 tsp salt all sifted together then 4-6 tbsp of butter cut in then 1 cup of milk.  YUM!

Personally, I think this is the best chicken and dumplings I've ever had! I will definitely be making this again in the future.

My husband thought it was very good, but he did think it was a bit too salty for his liking.  I thought it was perfect.  
Another thing that may be helpful is that it isn't necessary just to use cream of chicken soup. I didn't have any on hand, but I did have cream of celery and cream of potato. I used that, and only used 3 potatoes because the cream of potato soup had some potato chunks in it already. I also used 2 cans of chicken broth in place of the water. 

This meal is so incredibly flavorful! You can't go wrong with this recipe! It was so easy to do, as well. Just throw the stuff in the pot and let it cook slowly on the stove until it is time for the dumplings to be added. It took a long time to cook, but I think it adds to the flavor. All of the ingredients meld together to produce one wonderful meal that appeals to all of the senses!

I made this last nite and it was very tasty.  After reading the many reviews, I did make a few changes.  I used 3 cups low sodium chicken broth instead of water.  I chopped the onion and potatoes into smaller sizes than the original recipe states.  I omitted peas due to pea allergies here.  I made 8 dumplings using 1 cup of baking mix, 1/3 cup milk, dash of dried thyme, and 1/2 tsp. dried parsley; drop into bubbling liquid, cook 10 minutes covered, 10 minutes uncovered.  Served 4 with leftovers.  Everyone agreed this was a delicious 'make again' recipe.  Thank you!!

THIS IS A KEEPER! I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken because I don't like the little chicken bits in that soup.  I also added a can of chicken broth and milk.  This was my first time making dumplings. They turned out a bit flat, but with practice I'm sure I'll get the feel of making them! I added all the veggies with the chicken in the beginning. I used canned peas. I added milk to thin as it simmered and thickened.  I used Old Bay Spice in place of chicken spice because I don't know what chicken spice is. As another member suggested I added Old Bay Spice to the dumpling dough.  I used Bisquick. My end result is a creamy & savory supper with leftovers!!

This is a winter staple. So yummy, I'd eat it if it were 80 degrees outside! I used 2/3 cup milk, 2 1/2 cups chicken broth, and 2 cans cream of chicken. I diced my chicken  instead of shredding it. I don't like onions or celery, so I replaced the onions with 1/4 cup onion power, and a teaspoon of celery salt. I used 4 cups of frozen mixed veggies and three medium sized potatoes, peeled and diced. I used the dumpling recipe from the "low fat Bisquick" box. I seasoned the dumplings with salt, white pepper and basil. A bit of advice: when you drop the dumplings in, you can't walk away. You have to stir the stew constantly, otherwise, they'll stick to the bottom and burn.

This recipe is awesome and so easy!!  I did make a couple changes though - no potatoes - thought the dumplings were enough - I did use the dumpling recipe on the Bisquick box as those aren't as doughy.  This is definately a keeper!! I also doubled the recipe in order to be sure we had plenty!!!  Thanks for a new favorite dinner in our house!!

This is an excellent dish!!  I did make some changes, however.  Instead of plain Cream of Chicken soup, I used Cream of Chicken with Herbs (and did not use poultry seasoning).  I also used 2 cups chicken broth with 1 cup water instead of 3 cups water.  Also, instead of adding sliced carrots, I poured in a bunch of baby carrots -- no slicing needed!  I did not use peas (because I forgot to buy them -- I would have otherwise), and added a can of diced new potatoes.  As you can tell, I prefer the easy way! It came out terrific.  I totally recommend this for a cold winter day.

This is probably the single best recipe I have ever gotten off All Recipes!  It is by far the best chicken'n'dumpling recipe I've ever used...  My hubby ate himself into a stupor, and I even ate the dumplings, which I rarely do.  Brava!!!

I read most of the other reviews and made some of the suggested changes.  I substituted with 1 can cream of celery.  I used 1 1/2 cans of chicken broth, 1 can of milk, and 1 can of water.  Used 4 "smaller" potatoes.  I used Bisquick, and added a pinch of salt, pepper as well as 1 tsp both basil and parsley (mostly for appearance).  The final result was perfection.  My oldest son has requested it for his school lunch two days in a row now. We havn't even gotten through the first pot, and the kids are demanding that I make it again.

I don't know what we did wrong but this was not at all worth the time needed to put into it to cook. It was a very starchy dish and the dumplings overwhelmed the rest of the dish. Won't be making this dish ever again.

I used this recipe for the chicken and sauce, but used the incredible dumpling/kluski recipe in "Polish Chicken and Dumplings" by Linda - fantastic combination! Other adjustments: added enough water to one can chicken broth for a total of 3 cups liquid; only cooked the chicken in the broth with spices and vegetables for about 15-20 minutes, and I don't think that compromised the flavor at all; thickened the broth/sauce with a flour/water mixture to a gravy-like consistency; didn't add peas simply because I don't like them; next time will not add the carrots or potatoes because it just seemed to be too much with the chicken, dumplings and thick sauce - would serve on the side instead. Thank you for a great recipe!

I made this recipe for my family.  I did add a few bullion cubes as we like lots of flavor in our food.  Everyone loved it.  My husband ate a few bowls of it.  My 14 month old triplets ate a bowl a piece.  It is even good warmed up.  I do have a add some water when I nuke it but even I, who doesnt do leftovers, eats it.

This tasted fine, but the "dumplings" really overpowered the chicken!  I guess I'm more used to the dumplings my grandma made that were more like big noodles -- so as a comfort food, this didn't cut it for our family.  More effort than it was worth for me to make it again.

Oh my, this was so tasty! I used chicken broth in lieu of water and eliminated the salt, as the soup has plenty on its own. I too halved the dumplings and did add more liquid to my slow cooker. My husband LOVES these kind of meals and the kids gave it a MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM....Good job Claire!

I knew when I saw the amount of liquid that 3 cups of baking mix would be too much so I used the dumpling recipe on the box, which calls for 2 c. mix and 2/3 c. milk.  Even that was too much.  It immediately absorbed all the liquid.  It still tasted delicious but I will dilute the leftovers with broth.  In the future, I would only use 1 c. baking mix and 1/3 c. milk when adding the dumplings.

This recipe was SO good!My husband loved it and he's very picky.  The only thing I'd do differently next time, is cut the amount of dumplings in half.  There were too many in the pot and it soaked up quite a bit of the gravy. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I did kind of screw it up because I didn't use a big enough pot so when I went to cook the dumplings they stuck to the pot cover!  I was able to "fix" the dish so it was not a total loss.  I will definitely try it again as the flavor was excellent.  Definitely a hearty meal.

Made this for St. Patty's day and it was great! I agree it was a bit bland and chicken broth would be better than plain water, but otherwise very tasty. If you're anti canned cream of chicken soup, its really easy to make home made cream of chicken soup, in fact Allrecipes.com has one that i made a week ago... so no processed food necessary. Today I ate leftovers, added some butter and salt and it was delicious, husband ate leftovers too which rarely happens... here's my pic...

WOW!!! When I was in grade school one of my favorites was chicken on a biscuit. I'm 44 years young and haven't found anything close to the small meal!!!! I have a picky 16 y/o.....she will only eat pizza, tacos or ranch chicken. And then complains she's tired of eating the same things all the time. So according to her tastes I added the poultry seasoning, salt and pepper to the soup and water base and added 1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder. After, I made an 'Upside down chicken Shepard's pie.' I sprayed a 13×9 pan with Pam spray followed by a layer of mashed potatoes, corn, shredded chicken n gravy...and on top I made two boxes of "Red Lobster" biscuits and spooned them on top. Baked it for 45 minutes at 350°. Preheat your oven! ??

This was delicious!  Really tasted like an Irish dish and smelled wonderful!  I didn't have poultry seasoning, so I just kind of winged it.  Next time I will use the poultry seasoning.  I did substitute chicken broth for the water and used herbed cream of chicken.

Decent recipe.. started to follow instruction but then quit after it looked like too much carrots, potatoes, etc for my taste.

It was bland, so I added a little of what a few people had mentioned, some garlic, oregano, lemon juice gave it some zing....

I handmade the dumpling according to somebodys post on here, but they didn't rise, so I take it the recipe for that was screwed up.

Too me the soup tasted like a pot pie only liquidy, it was ok... but I wouldn't make again probably

I am not sure what makes this "Irish."  Is it the Bisquick or the Cream of Chicken Soup?  I made this for St. Patrick's Day based on the "Irish" part of the title.  This food was really not good at all. To each his own.

I grew up with a much simpler chicken and dumplings recipe (just cooked chicken over rice) but married a man who was not a big fan of chicken. I looked for something a bit different that he might like better and this was it! Wow, it's delicious. It's like a peppery chicken stew over rice with dumplings, you can't get much better than that. I cook it as is but add 8oz green chilies to mine and then serve it over 1-1.5 cups of rice. I can't say anything about the dumpling portion of this recipe though because I always use our own family's recipe for that part.

My family loved this dish...  Made it for St. Patty's Day and it was gone. Took it to my family gathering at Christmas and everyone loved it! Makes your home smell good also...  Highly recommend for a easy, wonderful meal...

Followed some commenter's advice and added garlic salt and extra poultry seasoning. I had large potatoes so I cut them into smaller pieces so they cooked faster. My family loved this recipe though so I'll be making it again soon!

Delicious! I wanted it thicker, so I only used 1 cup of water, but because of this had to cook the dumplings in a different pot. I also added other seasonings because it is a little bland. Next time I'll use fewer potatoes.

Why Have I not ever had this before???  It's amazing! Not a quick dinner on the fly, but something to throw on the stove while the kids are outside playing!
I followed other suggestions and added a little red pepper flake and some Oregano.  I threw the extra dough in the oven while the stew cooked on the stovetop.  Worked out great!  I will definitely be making a smaller batch next time though!

It's a good recipe. But if you enjoy slightly more flavor consider adding in a little garlic, substitute some of the water with chicken broth and add some thyme.  I also think you could double up on the current spices in the recipe.  Maybe adding in a little of the same spices into your biscuit dough mix.

I used this recipe for my leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  It's better than my mom's (which is saying something, especially for comfort food)!  I did take a tip from other reviewers and used 2/3 chicken broth, 1/3 water as well as added onion salt & onion powder for flavor.  Go easy on adding any extra salt; with the broth and the soup, my batch really didn't need it.

This was so GOOD!  I did not cook the chicken for 1 1/2 hours though.  I threw the vegetables and chicken together and cooked through then added the soup--did use 3 cans of soup. I made the entire amount of dumpling mix.  I'm glad I did because there was a lot of stew leftover and I reheated to boiling and made the rest of the dumplings to go with it. Very, very delicious!

A bimonthly staple in our house. Hubby loves it! I omitted the salt and used 2 cans chicken broth and 2 cans cream of chicken soup as one other person suggested. Absolutely delish!

This is delicious comfort food at it's finest. Absolutely though, take the hint from reviewer DHILLY and reduce the dumpling mixture by about half. I used a home made chicken soup mix and biscuit mix for this recipe, both of which can be found on this site. So much better to remove the msg and other additives by doing that.

Made this for supper this eve. Tasted great. What I did a little different...3 cans of soup, 4 cups of chicken broth, maybe 3/4 t of cumin, 1lb of baby carrots, 1 lb of frozen mixed vegies. Made my own buttermilk dumplings. Very filling and soooo good.

I made this according to the recipe and it wasn't great. WAY too much water! If I make it again, I would put in only 1/3 the amount of water but would use broth. As others noted, it is very bland as written. I wound up putting in more chicken seasoning and a few dashes of curry and bouillion (since I had used water). I guess it's a starting point, but it needs quite a bit of work, so as is, definitely not more than a 3-star recipe.

I did this in the crock pot and had no need for adding extra soup or liquid. I used cream of celery soup since that is what I had on hand. I halved the recipe since there are only 3 of us  and we still got 2 meals out of it....so this makes a lot. GOt 4 stars because the meat/sauce was very good. The biscuits are "eh". Will use my own dumpling dough next time.

Very tasty! Thanks for sharing!We don't like peas, so I omitted them. Next time, I may reduce the potatoes a bit and make sure I have enough stuff for dumplings before I get to that step! ;)

Wonderful!  I have never made chicken and dumplings but I have used this recipe twice.  It is sooo good.  I love the added vegetables, but don't always add them, at my husband's request (he's picky) or just don't have them on hand. He has suggested adding corn; so I will try that next time.  The only thing I suggest is following the measurements for the dumplings on the box instead of in this recipe.  Thank you for the recipe!

Great base recipe.  Excellent flavor and consistency and VERY easy! Have made it both with and without potatoes and we prefer without as it's less starchy.  Also we substituted canned biscuits chopped into small pieces for the dumplings.

Perfect. Like others. I lost track of my own recipe with the correct measurements and this was pretty close to what I remember. It came out wonderfully. I added a bunch of potatoes and left out the carrots. Perfect for a cold rainy day. Tasty stick to your ribs comfort food!

This was awesome.  The only thing I would change is to add another can of cream of chicken soup and 1.5 more cups of water, if not double the liquid in the recipe altogether as about halfway through the liquid was completely gone.  I'm still rating this 5 stars because it was THAT good, and needing to cook up some more liquid for tomorrow's leftovers is a minimal extra step to having it again.  I also agree with other reviewers in that the dumpling recipe should be cut in half - I only used half the recipe in my large soup pot, and the dumplings took about 30 minutes to cook because they all clumped together.  Even with the changes I mentioned above this will become a staple in our house - thanks so much for posting!

This was one of those recipes that appears like you spent all day on it, but was actually really easy.  I had shredded left over turkey in my freezer that I used in place of the chicken.  Everything else I kept the same except adding some "Chicken Soup Base" spice seasoning.  I like things extra spiced, so that's just personal preference.  I've made this twice already and it's a keeper!

I used this as a guide more than anything. It turned out great. My family loved it. I used chicken broth instead of water. I used three cans of soup and 4 cups of chicken broth and increased the seasoning slightly. I used bisquick for the dumplings. Very good. will make again for sure.

So good!! My first try at C&D and they were awesome!! I followed other advice and used 3 cans of cream of chicken and used chicken broth instead of water. And I just used Bisquick for the dumplings (shame on me I know, but I had that on hand and actually didn't have the stuff for the homemade ones). I'm so excited they came out well!

This was delicious. I cheated by using pillsbury biscuits torn up and instead of adding fresh carrots, I added 10oz of frozen mixed vegetables. I did use chicken stock instead of water, as several reviewers suggested. 
I'll definitely be making this again and again.

I enjoyed the dish and so did most of my family. My only concern is with the dumplings. The directions weren't specific about how to make them, so I just added the 1 1/3 cups of milk to the 3 cups of baking mix. The mix was very sticky and couldn't just be dropped by the spoonful into the soup. I had to add more baking mix. I probably ended up adding a whole additional cup. It may have been my mistake, but the results were good.

Really good, but the dumplings soaked up all the liquid. So add some extra broth or soup or water.

So amazing! This is by far the best chicken and dumplings I have ever had. I followed the recipe as is and I was not let down. The poultry seasoning soaks into the potatoes making them so delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

OMG! This is fabulous!! If I could give it 10 stars I would. I made it for dinner tonight and we loved it. The perfect winter storm dinner. This one is definitely a keeper. The only I changed was I only used half and onion and diced it fine (we're not big onion fans), and I cubed the potatoes. Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

I used one can of cream of chicken and another of cream of celery and it was excellent, next time i might try cream of mushroom or cream of asparagus.  Easy chicken and dumplings!  The only thing it needed was a little heat.  This will be my chicken and dumpling recipe from now on!

I think that this was perfect for a chilly day. I threw all of the ingredients into the slow cooker before I left for work. I even but the chicken breasts in whole. When I came home I transfered it into a pot, so I could bring it to a boil for the dumplings. While the stew was cooking, I shredded the chicken and put it back into the pot when I was finished. This is a great easy meal for a week night.

I used the ingredients as directed, except I added a bit less water because I wanted it more like stew and I used a leek instead of onion because I had fresh leeks on-hand.  It was really delicious!  Mine burnt on the bottom of the pot a little, and I found that there were too many dumplings (and BOY do those little buggers ever EXPAND!!) but overall the taste was great.  In the future I might use 1 can of Chicken soup and 1 can of mushroom soup, simply because I prefer the flavor.  I cut the chicken (only 2 breasts, but I should have used a bit more) into pieces and browned them a little with the leek to speed up the process.  The whole thing took only 1 hour.

Used bone-in breasts and baby carrots as a substitute.  Recipe doesn't state to peel the potatoes,  I think I would prefer this.  My son doesn't like peas, so left them out.  Also, to save time I used store bought refrigerated biscuits with similar/same result.

This soup is one of my favories - I have made it a number of times and it is always delicious.  A few modifications: I follow the other reviewer's comments and cut the potatoes into smaller pieces, like 1/8ths, I use 1/2 water and 1/2 chicken broth, and I recently started adding 1-2 sprigs of fresh Rosemary when adding the potatoes and carrots.  It adds a really hearty flavor that I felt was missing when I made it previously.  Perfect for chilly Sunday nights.  Thanks!

This was just an ok version of chicken and dumplings.  My husband is a big potato lover and he absolutely hated that this dish contained potatoes.  Also it was a little bland and I wish I would have taken a previous persons suggestion of adding a little chili pepper to heat it up.  Also could have used a little more chicken and way less on the dumpling mix.  Next time I'm going to use a can of refrigerated biscuits and pull them apart for the dumplings.  Will use 6 chicken breasts rather than 4 and will chop up into chunky pieces rather than shred.  Will leave out the potatoes altogether and add a little cayenne or chili pepper for flavor.  I think that would make this dish perfect.  Otherwise it was decent and my husband did eat the leftovers the next day without complaint.

followed recipe exactly the first time and found it to be most tasty stew, but quite thick and little room for the dumplings.  Okay by me though, next time I just threw the whole thing in the crock pot and served with hot from the oven biscuits!  Delicious and hearty.  Thanks.

Yum! I did make a lot of changes, but used this as an "outline." First, I used three cups of vegetarian "chicken flavored" broth and simmered the cut up veggies in that. I left out the chicken. I made a roux with 3 tablespoons of butter and 3 tablespoons of flour and then added 1 1/2 cups of milk and let it simmer until bubbly because I don't like all of the preservatives found in canned cream soups. I then added that to the soup (once the veggies were cooked thoroughly) and let it simmer a few more minutes. I added the biscuits as directed. This was a TOTAL crowd-pleaser and when my husband took leftovers to work the next day, all of his co-workers came in to ask what smelled so good! I am currently making it for the second time in less than two weeks. I'm definitely adding this into my usual fall/winter/spring rotation!

For those of you not familiar with this kind of recipe, think of it as the inside of a chicken pot-pie.  A few tips to make it easier: I did not simmer for the entire time listed; feel free to "rush" the recipe a bit.  The onions seem to disappar, so don't bother chopping them too fine.  You can get away with frozen ingredients that aren't the freshest.  This is a good stick-to-your-ribs kind of "manly" dinner.  I suggest a piece of crusty warm bread to go with it.

The recipe was the BEST dumplings over my mother's. Even though I screwed it up a little with the stages, it still worked out great. I cooked the chicken on medium for an hour until it was done - to save some cook time. I will definitely make again.

First of all, this recipe is amazing! I bought 2 delicious already baked chicken breasts from my local deli, which I almost always do for recipes like this, pulled off the skin and shredded them by hand. I didn't add shredded chicken to the stew until the last 10 mins of cooking, just before dropping in the dumplings, which I made from scratch. I used a can of chicken broth instead of the suggested 3 cups of water, I also ended up adding a cup of water to thin it out a little. I used only one onion, which a chopped instead of quartering, and I used only two russet potatoes and I'm glad I only used two because it was plenty. I loved that this recipe included so many great veggies! Easy recipe; not too time consuming, for me anyway.. just some chopping and shredding chicken while veggies are cooking away. Thanks this recipe.. I'll be using it often:)

Yum, yum, yum!  My husband and I LOVED this recipe.  It was perfect for a cold, snowy night.  We will definitely use this again.

I took another reviewer's advice and used 3 cans of cream of chicken soup, and made homemade dumplings.  I only used 1 onion, and minced is rather quartered.  I also only used 1 1/2 potatoes and 3 carrots with no peas.  Otherwise I think it would have been too much.  Also I used some corn starch to thicken it.  Perfect, perfect, PERFECT!  Thank you so much for this recipe.

Really good base recipe, but had to make a few alterations.  The most important alteration was timing!!!  This does NOT take a mere 2.5 hours, people --- you need to clear your calendar for about  3.5-4 hours to make this properly!!!  The main problem is the potatoes.  Perhaps if you added them earlier it might be ready in 1/2 hour, but you really need a good hour or so (over low heat, obviously).  Also, the dumplings took much longer than the 20 mins as suggested by the author - it was more like 40 mins.  That being said, the recipe itself was fantastic, and I only added some celery seed and more salt to it.  Also, I made chicken pot pie with the leftovers!!!  It turned out delicious as well.  Just unroll a pie crust into a pie plate, add leftovers, seal the top, cut slits (so heat can escape), brush with egg wash and pop in a 375 oven for about 40 mins.  Excellent the day of and several days later.  This is definitely a keeper!!!

This recipe was absolutly fantastic.  My whole family enjoyed it.  The only problem I had was that I had no idea what this baking mix was so I used another recipe to make the dumplings.

Comfort food at its best - almost as good as my mom's.  I followed the recipe *almost* exactly.  I didn't have any poultry seasoning, so I sub'd in savory and thyme. I also didn't have any cream of chicken soup, so I used 1 can of cream of potato and one can of cream of celery; I also didn't use frozen peas, but canned instead.  The only other change I made was to make my own 'baking mix' by combining 1 cup of flour, 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt and 1 Tbsp of shortening (cut in with a pastry blender).  I tripled this and used about 1 1/2 cups of milk - the end result was light, fluffy dumplings.

This was good, not excellent though. I listened to other reviewers and didn't add the chicken broth, BAD idea! The bottom of the pot burned and there was not enough liquid. Next time I will cut te chicken before cooking it and I will add less potatoes. Thanks!

This was pretty good on a cold, frosty winter night. I substituted stock for the water, and large diced the onion instead of quatering so that it spread more throughout the mixture.

It was a little light on seasoning so I had to go a little heavier on the salt & pepper, but it was still very good over all.

I would give this recipe five stars except for one thing---I ended up with WAY too much dumpling mix than I needed.  I remember having this same problem when I tried out this recipe a long time ago.  It's very good, but it almost seems like the proportions are off---I had to add 1 1/2 cups extra broth in order to fit in all my veggies & chicken---and that was before I added the dumplings!  Still yummy though...

I had never made chicken and dumplings before so I was a little concerned about how watery it seemed as soon as it was done (more like soup with dumplings on top) but it definately thickens as it stands and is even better the next day.  I think it is a good idea to use chicken broth instead of the water however I didn't do this and it was still the best I've had.  I will the next time - and there will be a next time!

I've made this many many times, thhink of this as chicken pot pie with a dumpling topping instead. I do add a tsp. of poultry seasoning to the dumplings too. I use the chicken breasts straight from the freezer. It saves thawing time that way and it always turns out great.  It does require a LARGE pot otherwise it will just barely fit after you get the dumplings in. A favorite here at our house! This is wonderful, Thanks so much for sharing.

I just had to reiterate what everyone has already said, this dish was amazing.  I had a huge dilemma when my husband asked me to make chicken and dumplings for him.  I have memories of this dish from when I was a kid and my Mom made it.  I remember it being the grossest, most bland, boring, mushy meal ever and usually would go without dinner whenever she made it.  Well, this is not my Mom's chicken and dumplings nor does it look like it.  This was delicious!  I even ate the dumplings!  It was so creamy and flavorful!  I was really impressed, I will be making this dish for my family for many years to come.  My picky 11 year old and my 2 year old ate it all up and even went for seconds.  My husband was in dumpling heaven and told me that I would have to make this one again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was fantastic. My whole family loved it including myself and I generally dislike this dish. I had it for my midnight snack! Instead of water I used broth and milk. I also placed the soup in a 9 x 13 pan and then dropped the dumplings in. cook 20 min.350 oven. A little easier for me.

This recipe should be renamed The Best Irish Chicken and Dumplings EVER!!  My husband has been requesting chicken and dumplings.  This was my first attempt and so glad I picked this recipe.  I used 1 can of cream of chicken with herbs and 1 can of cream of celery.  I used 3 cups of chicken broth instead of the water.  The dumplings cooked perfectly.  It didn't take long at all.  Perfect comfort food!

Oh, my, was this delicious! I made it in my slow cooker and it worked just great.  I used one can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of celery soup (didn't have fresh celery on hand).  I omitted the 3 cups of water and added one can of reduced fat/salt chicken broth instead.  I also used one can of sliced carrots instead of fresh.  I omitted the potatoes.  This will be a family favorite from now on.  Thanks, Claire.

This is the most amazing chicken and dumplins I've had!!!  We're talking incredible! I did this on the stovetop the first few times and then in the crockpot.  I like it better in the crockpot, since I could fit in all the dumplings mix.  I cooked it 6 hours, adding the bisquick 40 minutes before it was ready.  Some changes: I used 2c. chicken stock and 1c. water in place of 3c water.  I also doubled the poultry seasoning and used 1/2 t. salt (stock has salt).  I will increase the amount of chicken next time as well. I was only able to use 1/2 of the Bisquick mix, as my stock pot was too crowded.  I didn't use carrots or peas.  Thank you!!!  This is our new family favorite!

Great recipe! I had a small chicken that I boiled with onion and celery for about an hour. I then  took the meat off the chicken and placed it in the pot with the other ingredients. I added the carrots with everything because I wasn't paying attention. I then added the peas and then added the dumplings - but I used Reames dumplings. I added too much water so I just added another can of cream of chicken soup to even it out. This got rave reviews from my husband (who is not wild about chicken n dumplings) and also his daughter. This is going in the binder! Thanks for sharing!

This was so simple to prepare.My family thought was more of a stove top pot pie with all the vegetables. We all loved this! I added some poultry seasoning to the dry biscuit mix for the dumplings. Next time, I'm going to try it without the carrots, peas, and potatoes because the flavor is fabulous and a keeper for sure!

This was my first attempt at chicken and dumplings and it turned out really yummy. I took some of the other reviewers advice and used chicken broth instead of water but I did ended up adding about 2 more cups of broth because it was very thick. I also made a mistake at the store. Instead of getting the premade biscuits I accidentally grabbed crescent rolls but it still turned out fantastic. Maybe even better than if I had used biscuits! Excellent comfort food. Might even make it again next week!

Very good ... takes a while but basically easy to make.  I used Campbell's 98% fat free cream of chicken soup and reduced fat Bisquik.  Makes for a no guilt comfort food dinner.  :)  Thanks

This recipe was far too thick to add any dumplings at all.  I ended up putting 2.5 extra cups of water in the stew and it was still too thick to add the dumplings.  I would suggest if you make this dish, make it with extra water (or chicken broth would probably work, too) and serve it over rice as a thick stew.  This is not chicken and dumplings...

We thought this was very good. Great for a very rainy day. Only changes I would make is leave out the potatoes, dont see the need with dumplings and increase the liquid by maybe 50%. I also substituted chicken broth for water.

This truly is comfort food.  Because you lose some flavor with boneless chicken breasts, I would suggest substituting chicken stock or broth for the water.  My family loved this.

I thought this recipe was very good. very easy to put toghether. My whole family loved it. I used jiffy mix biscuts for the dumplings. turned out very well. I think like others said I will be adding more poultry spice and a little garlic and salt and pepper. I did use 1 can of low fat cream of chicken and 1 can of low fat cream of celery soup. I will be making this again!

This is a delicious recipe. My boyfriend and I loved it.  It was very easy to make, prep time was minimal.  I did not make the dumplings in the recipe, I used refrigerated can biscuits instead.

Excellent excellent recipe.  Be careful when dropping the dumplings in the mixture, if you make them too big (like I did) it will take them longer to cook.  I ended up adding about a half hour to the cook time.  Thank you for a great recipe!!

Delicious!! I changed a few things but kept most the same. I used reduced fat cream of mushroom and one can reduced fat cream of chicken. Then I followed the recipe exactly. For the dumplings I used reduced fat bisquick. The whole thing was great and very very low in fat. It does make a lot though. In the future I might make a half batch. Certainly worth making again.

Mmmmm... good.  I made a few small changes, but I am sure the original recipe would be as delicious.  My family was hungry NOW, so I microwaved and shredded the chicken breasts while the root veggies were simmering.  I have no poultry seasoning, so I used fresh thyme, dried marjoram, and a bay leaf. I used broth instead of water. I skipped the potatoes. Also, because Bisquick dumplings aren't my fave, I couldn't resist using the recommended "Dumplings" recipe (in the bread section) and those were delicious. Added fresh chives and parsley to those.  A delicious soup!

This is very tasty.  The cooking time was very long though,so start it on a day that you are home and can tend it for 3 hours.

I was looking for a great meal for a sleepy, cold winter's day and what I found was a good recipe with some flavor.  I used the dumplings recipe "Dumplings Submitted by: Carol" and found it a bit bland.  I have never been a fan of these types of dishes (which is probably why I did not find it to my liking), but my wife really enjoyed this.  I would not make it again, unless she asked me to.

This was delicious & comforting!  When I first decided to try the recipe I was unsure how it would turn out with cream of chicken soup as the base, but I wouldn't know this recipe started that simply if I hadn't made it myself!  The only adjustments I made was to cut the salt in half (so folks can season to their own taste) and made my own dumplings from scratch.  Yum!!!

Very, very  good!  To save time, I used thin-cut chicken breasts, which cooked faster and shredded easily.  The dumpling recipe I used was found here on All Recipes--simply called "Dumplings". I added cilantro and minced mushrooms to the batter and they were fluffy and fantastic.  Also, I finished the soup with a bit of buttermilk, which smoothed it out and made it creamier!.

This was very good and definitely qualifies as comfort food. I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom & chicken. I diced my chicken breasts up along with all the other veggies and added everything but the potatoes to simmer for 1 1/2 hours then added the potatoes and dumplings around the same time. Like other reviewers I used the dumpling recipe on the Bisquick box and boiled them uncovered for 10 then covered for 10. They weren't at all soggy and the whole thing had a really good flavor. Oh, I also added 1/2 tsp thyme and 1/2 tsp basil. Consequently the recipe mirrors my recipe for chicken pot pie only is slightly easier to prepare and a little less flavor overall. Not bad and went down easily tonight as it's 35 degrees outside!

I made this recipe a while ago (I'm a little late with the review - oops), and it truly was warm-up-your-soul, curl up with a blankie comfort food.  I absolutely LOVED the flavor of the broth.  My only problem with the recipe lies in the dumpling department - 1st of all, I didn't get the consistency quite right.  2nd, I live alone and dumplings don't really seem to survive well in the fridge when they're sitting in liquid.  The next time I make this recipe (which will be the very moment chilly weather arrives), I think I'm going to portion out the soup mixture into individual bowls for freezing/refrigerating, and then make the dumplings on a case-by-case basis when I reheat the individual portions on the stove.  I ended up having to waste a bunch of this glorious soup because of my dumpling mishaps, and I'm not going to let that happen again!  Thanks for the recipe.

The chicken mixure was outstanding!  I used bisquick for dumplings and they came out like glue.  For some reason I just can't make dumplings.  Great filler for a pot pie, tho!  Yummy!!!!

Family Favorite! I did use the recipe on the bisquik box for the dumplings and also cut he poultry seasoning in half. I added 1 chicken bouillon cube and it was perfect! I also used only 2 large potatoes.  We had the left-overs over my husbands homemade perogies! Will make again for sure!!!!

In my book this is a winner. My boyfriend says it is more like a pot pie and not the way his momma made chicken and dumplings.  He still liked it.

This was a nice recipe, although not outstanding.  I think there were too many dumplings, soaked up much of the gravy.  The family enjoyed this and I'll make again.

My husband asked me to cook 'chicken & dumplings'.  I did not know the first thing about how to cook it.  I looked it up on this sight and found this recipe, the whole family wanted more than just one plate full.  We will be having this more often.

Delicious!  This was my first time cooking Chicken and Dumplings. Changes: I cooked the chicken for 2hrs, added the veggies and cooked another 1hr, then added the peas and cooked for another 30min before adding the dumplings.  Everyone loved this recipe!

My ten year old son and my husband loved this.  My teenage daughters and a boyfriend thought it was okay.  First - no one liked the large chunks of potatoes.  Second - I had a hard time with the dumplings.  They were too large and there didn't seem to be enough liquid in the pot to let them cook properly.  If I make again - I would make differently.

Made this for St. Patrick's Day (complete with food coloring enhanced green dumplings!).  This was excellent.  Even the kids loved it.  (Suprise!)  I did a couple of things differently though.  First, I substituted chicken broth for the water, then instead of cooking the breasts then shredding them and replacing the shredded meat.  I just chopped the breasts into very small pieces BEFORE cooking, and tossed them in to save a step.  This was a big hit and I'll definatly try it again.

My husband had never had chicken and dumplings before.  It was a perfect winter meal for him.  I actually added diced cooked leftover turkey from Thanksgiving, gravy, and frozen carrots and peas to the mix just before dropping in the dumplings.  The dumplings did not puff well until I raised the heat to boiling, not simmering. Drop the dumplings on something solid, like pieces of food, rather than directly into the broth.  Leave the cover on a bit longer, until the center of the dumplings are fluffy, then take it off the last 10 minutes of cooking.

YUM!  When I made this, my husband said honey, I want you to cook this at least once a month!  Great recipe.  There's only two of us so next time I'm going to cut the recipe in half since we had a lot left over even though we pigged out on it.

Wonderful recipe.  I had a whole chicken cooked and deboned, so just simmered step 1 for 30 minutes without the chicken, then added chicken in step 3.  The flavor is excellent, can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight.

This is a tasty meal.  The dumplings were a bit thin and need a few minutes to thicken before adding to the stew.  It tasted great the next day!

Delicious!! Note to self: use 3 cans cream of chicken/mushroom. 4 chicken thighs was perfect. Use dumpling recipe from Nee Orleans cookbook & season them heavily with pepper, garlic powder & paprika.

Can you say....LOVED IT?!  We used to drive 2 hours to a reataurant that made the best chicken & dumplings. Now we can make it at home. We have 5 kids so we made more (not quite doubled). Delicious! Everyone loved it!

I am rating this recipe low because I took many suggestions from others who changed or added to the recipe to make it better and it was delicious, but it also changed the recipe.

Excellent!  My family isn't big on onion so I substituted minced onion.  They were excellent.  Used chicken stock in place of water.  Yum!

I loved this dish, but I didn't use Bisquick to make my dumpings.  I made my own from scratch which I prefer as I find Bisquick to be a bit sweet.

Turned out wonderful! I used less dumpling mixture as suggested ( 2 cups mix with 2/3 cup milk ) and it was the perfect amount!

This is my second time making this dish. I made some modifications based on my first (failed) attempt and some comments from previous reviews. 

First, I didn't have celery, since I live in Turkey and it's hard to find here, but I didn't miss it a bit. We don't have Bisquick here either, but dumpling dough is so simple to make.

Second, I used chicken legs and thighs, which were cheaper and more flavorful than boneless skinless chicken breasts. They are quite easy to de-bone after cooking for that long.

Third, I left out the potatoes this time around; last time I found them bulky and flavorless, and there were so many of them there wasn't room for the dumplings! 

Finally, I added two chicken boullion cubes and left out the pre-made soup. I didn't have poultry seasoning either, so to spice up the dish, I added 1 tbsp of dried rosemary, 2 bay leaves, 1/2 tsp of cumin, and 2 cloves of garlic. 

With these modifications, it was the best chicken and dumplings I've ever eaten (not to brag ;)).

I loved this recipe. I pretty much followed it as written, except for two things that made it a little bit easier. First, instead of removing the chicken and shredding it, I cut the chicken breasts into little pieces in the first place with kitchen scissors. This step probably saved me a ton of time. I also followed others' suggestions and used refrigerated biscuits. These steps made it really easy to make and my whole family loved it.

Made this as written...sorta lol.  I did have to add an extra can of cream of chicken soup and water.  I diced the potatoes and used about half of what it called for.  I used the Bisquick dumpling recipe and still had some left over.  Very, very good and WILL make again!

Are you kidding me? This is the first time I have made chicken and dumplings. My mom used to make them when I was a child. Snowing today, it sounded amazing. This recipe is to die for! I would never rate a recipe that I didn't follow to a T,(I find that so obnoxious) but because I didn't have peas, I left them out. And the potatoes, because we had scalloped potatoes last night. Delicious! Next time, I will add the peas and potatoes. But wow! I followed everything, without those two things, and I couldn't be happier! So good. Saving this recipe. I usually try a few variations of things before I pick a go-to. Not this time.

This is a great recipe. I made my own condensed cream of chicken (I can't stand the store stuff now :) and instead of dropping dumplings I baked drop biscuits. I have teens and they are in and out in the evening so this way they can add a biscuit when they are ready to eat! It was AWESOME! Thank you.

This was pretty good.  My husband and I really liked the flavors of the soup itself and the dumplings were very delicious (actually, I didn't use the dumpling recipe given, instead, I used croissant rolls broken into pieces) However, we were highly disappointed that not all the potatoes were cooked all the way through, even though I cooked the soup for about three hours all total.  I followed the directions and simmered it on a low setting the entire time, which I probably wont do again.  Next time, I'll probably increase the heat to medium and add just a few more seasonings because it turned out to be slightly bland.  But we did like this recipe enough to definitely try it again so, three stars.  (3-22-12)

Made this for St. Patrick's Day.  Made as was except a few things.  I was only me and my bf, so I reduced the serving size.  One can of soup, two cups water, 1.5 cups celery and carrots (wanted lots of those), about 3/4 onion (next time I may add a whole one), some Adobo, black pepper, parsley, 1 tsp. garlic, two chicken breasts, peas in half (bf doesn't like), three potatoes.  I did not to the biscuits on top.  My bf doesn't like it like that so I just made some pre-made biscuits separately.  Cooked #1 for an hour.  I forgot to take the chicken out and shred it.  Only problem is, I think the amount of water has to do with adding the baking mix, so mine was more soupy, but REALLY good!!  Since I forgot to cut the chicken, I put that on a plate and then the "soup" in a bowl.  I combined mine, bf didn't.  However he ate it all, which is unusual!  Only thing I will change is probably reducing the amount of water, but I almost liked the broth because it was sooo good.  I'm not sure if I'll get the right consistancy without making dumplings in it.  That's ok though, it's so good!

Made per recipe directions. And, ended up with a pot of mush. A complete let down and waste of time.  I should have read the reviews first! Like others I would suggest cutting the dumplings recipe in half AND use less milk.  The flavor was great! But, What a complete MESS!

Very good! Kids and hubby say this is a keeper. I did make a few changes according to some previous reviews. Made homemade dumplings instead of a mix. Also sautéed onions and garlic before adding to the soup mixture and added a couple of chicken bouillon cubes. Will definitely make again!

I used chicken stock instead of the water in this recipe, and added some seasonings to make sure there was enough flavor, based on other reviews.  I also wanted homemade dumplings, so I used this recipe instead of the Bisquick:


SOOO comforting and good, and way easier than I thought it would be.  YUM!

I really wanted to like this, but ugh, where do i start. There was not nearly enough liquid to make dumplings, but I tried anyways. It is now mush mixed in with ingredients with burnt mess on the bottom of the pot. It was on low the whole time.

Very good recipe! Here are my changes:

Double the pepper (a full teasooon); an extra dash of poultry seasoning; sliced baby portabella mushrooms instead of potatoes; chopped fresh chives added to the biscuit mixture.

Enjoy!

I used a can of flaky pilsbury biscuits and only simmered the chicken for about 40 minutes because it overflowed all over the stove after about 30.  The final results were delicious, though.

Delicious!  Although by preference we think it can do without the potatoes.  I also added a little more water and we loved the dumplings.  Thanks!

I made this as is and found it flavorful and comforting. It is a nice, quick and easy dish to cook up.  I did have to half the recipe as I fix it for just myself.  Thanks for sharing this delicious dish.

This gets 4 stars from me because i thought it needed a bunch more spices in order not to be bland!! i added garlic salt, and way more pepper to the recipe. just taste test to your own liking... also I made this in the slow cooker, high heat for 5 hours, chicken was soooo moist an yummy!! didnt add the second tin of soup as this made a whole lot of stew! also used chicken broth instead of water which i boiled before putting in the SC. Dumplings were fab! This is a keeper!!!! and so easy !!!!!

I made this last night for my very picky family.  The only changes I made were, one from a previous reviewer that substituted chicken broth for the water, and therefore I omitted the salt since there is plenty in the broth.  The meal was loved by all, a very rare occurance so this is a definite remake!

This turned out great!  I started with two cans of cream of chicken and one of cream of mushroom (because that is what I had on hand).  I also used and entire box of stock, or four cups and four cloves coursely chopped garlic.  Most importantly I added my chicken frozen and simmered for two hours.  I halved the biscuit recipe, it was the perfect amount and I have a large dutch oven.  Make some fresh biscuits the next day for left overs.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly, it was great, but next time I may slightly reduce pepper,  I thought that it may have been a little too much for my children (three and fifteen months), but they both ate it anyway!  Enjoy!  Also, I added two mushrooms that were about to go bad.

WOW! WOW! WOW! This stuff was the bomb! I made it with a few changes as I had leftover roasted chicken and potatoes from the night before. So I used those with canned chicken broth instead of water, and added the potatoes at the end with the frozen peas. Other than the few changes I followed the recipe, and the whole family just stuffed themselves. One warning, it sits like lead so go easy and it  went well with a good white wine. Loved it this goes into the rotation hands down!

We LOVE this in our house! End up having to cut it in half! The first time I made it it FILLED my large Le Crucet pot! Think its enough to feed 6 football players! My husband loves the fact that it has potatoes in it (meat and potatoes at the dinner table and he's happy)! Thank you!

I didn't quite read the recipe right and accidentally threw in the carrots with the rest of the veggies at the beginning, so I cooked it at a little higher temp for less time, then threw in the potatoes (again, less time - I HATE overdone potatoes), didn't have a whole bag of peas so I did half a bag of peas and half a bag of corn, doubled the poultry seasoning (I love that stuff) and used buttermilk in the biscuit mix to finish off some I had leftover.  So far, the smells emanating from my kitchen are heavenly!!  I think we may have a winner! :)

This was a wonderful slice of heaven.  I added my own chicken stock, red onion, and a handful of chopped parsley (in the dumplings).  I also cooked this in a dutch oven at 350.  Super!!

Very easy, especially my way.  I used a can of peas and a can of sliced carrots and added them at the end.  I used a whole skinned and deboned rotisserie chicken, and since I didn't need to cook the chicken in the soup, I simmered the deboned carcass to add some richness to the stew, and added the cooked chicken at the end.  I didn't feel the need for 4 potatoes when you have dumplings, and diced only 2.  I halved the dumplings, and this was thick and rich and fabulous!

Just spectacular, and quite a good amount of food! It lasted almost a week for the two of us. I made it in a 5 quart dutch oven and it nearly overran the pot! I'd suggest something a bit bigger. All in all a great recipe. Thank you, Clair!

(I'm only rating the stew since I used a different recipe for the dumplings.) However, this stew was awesome! So EASY while tasty and filling to boot! I love recipes that don't require a bunch of steps for meat prep and this definately fit the bill. This has become a permenant part of my monthly meals menu. Very good! (I used the 'Herbed Dumplings' recipe fromt his site and everyone loved it. Baking mix is a tiny bit easier for dumplings, but it is an overwhelming taste. The other version took about 3 minutes longer to prepare, and were 10 times better.)

My family loved this recipe! I used one can of condensed soup and more broth since that is what I had on-hand and it turned out wonderfully creamy and 'comforting'. My hubby says I can make this for him every Sunday. Thank you!

Very bland even though I added more salt and poultry seasoning.  It also needs more liquid because the dumplings soaked up most of the liquid, so there wasn't much to pour over the dumplings.  Way too much time for a mediocre meal.

Turned out good, but most of the moisture boiled out so I kept having to add water. I probably wont make it again just because it wasn't worth the amount of time it takes to cook.

I made the recipe as is and it was amazing.  I didn't have baking mix and believe it or not, I couldn't find it anywhere here in Egypt.  I'm sure there is a recipe on here somewhere for baking mix, but either way, it's easy to make.  Thanks for the Recipe.  I hate to admit it, but it may actually be better than my southern chicken and dumplings I make.

Really delicious!  For the dumpling I did 1 3/4 c. flour, 1/2 tsp. baking soda, 3/4 c. milk, 1 TBS. vinegar & 3 TBS. shortening. I think the dumpling part is a take it or leave it for me, but the soup part is delicious!

My husband made this and actually made a lot of mistakes but it was still fantastic! Easy and hearty! I followed other reviewers and cut the baking mix and milk in half and it was perfect for the pot we used. WONDERFUL---- (my husband said it was better than his mothers recipe and that doesn't happen very often :)

My whole family loved this!!  Definitely a great comfort food.  After reading several reviews I made just two changes.  First, I used chicken broth (made from boullion) instead of just plain water.  And second, I don't care for baking mix dumplings so I took the advice of another reviewer and used the dumpling recipe from the Polish Chicken and Dumpling recipe here on this site. NOTE:  I only made half of the dumpling recipe and only used half of the batter that I made, and I had plenty of dumplings!  Just remember that the dumplings get HUGE after simmering!  I'm always surprised when I take the lid off and see how big they've gotten!  It's rare that I make something that everyone in the family likes (there are 6 of us) so I will definitely be making this again!

This was an amazing, flavorful dish.  I made a few minor changes, due to what I had on hand, but nothing that dramatically changes the recipe.  I used chicken broth in place of water and didn't have poultry seasoning, so I substituted seasoning salt.  A few suggestions, though.  For one, the onion and potatoes quartered make too big of chunks.  They should be diced into smaller bite size pieces.  Also, it is important to use a large, wide pot for the dumplings to have plenty of room.  Good recipe.  Makes me think a little of chicken pot pie.

Delicious.  The only slight change I made to the recipe was the use of five Yukon Gold potatoes, instead of the four requested, and I cut them each into six pieces vs. the quartering in the original.  When you're ready to add the biscuits, don't fret if the potatoes aren't quite done--they'll get there by the end.  Use a tablespoon to ladle on the batter, but be somewhat generous in your portions.  Served in bowls on a cold, rainy night and it was a big hit.

Great recipe! I made this for the first time last night (actually started it mid-day) and it was wonderful! I followed the recipe for the most part but did use frozen chicken breasts (turned out just fine) and added parsley and cayenne pepper (just a dash each) to add a little more flavor. I also added a little extra water after it had been cooking for quite awhile - seemed thicker that what I was looking for. I too would recommend cutting up the veggies into smaller pieces and the biscuits were amazing! Don't need that many - didn't all fit in my heavy wide pot. Anyway, I personally have never loved veggies so much as in this dish and my 1.5 year old picky eater LOVED the veggies and biscuits too!  I think I cooked it longer because the potatoes didn't cook as fast. Next time we make this, we'll cut into bite size pieces and try it with 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 water.  Thanks for the recipe Clairellen!!! Yummy!!!

Wonderful! The ultimate comfort food! In my version, I brown cut-up boned thighs with the chopped onion and celery (and sometimes sliced mushrooms) then add 1 26-32 oz box of low sodium chicken stock (instead of water) and seasonings. After simmering about an hour, I add the soups (cream of anything works) and a bag of frozen peas and carrots. After returning to the simmer, I do the Bisquick dumplings using the box recipe. Reheated leftovers are great, too.

Good recipe that is easy to tailor to your own tastes.  I usually leave out the peas (husband does not like them) and the potatoes.  It makes the dish not as heavy since there's less starchy items in it.  I also like to use one can of cream of celery and one can of cream of onion instead of the cream of chicken soup since I don't like the canned chicken pieces.  By cutting out some of the starch and using the reduced fat soups, this is a great way to have a hearty meal that is not too fatty.

Today is the second time I have made this dish.  While the weather may be too warm for stew, hands down, this is the best recipe I have come across.   The first time I made it, I followed the directions exactly, but found that due to the long cooking times, the liquid was reduced greatly, which caused the dumplings to make the stew so thick, you could insert a spoon in the pot, and it would stand up straight.  Very flavorful, but I had to add water (a lot!) to thin it out. Tonight, I have used 3 cans of chicken broth along with 3 cups of water to start, and prior to adding the dumplings I have added another can of broth and another can of water.

I doubled the recipe for the dumplings because I was scared there wouldn't be enough and it soaked up all of my yummy gravy/juice. Obviously I should have just followed directions. Delicious.

Delicious!  I didn't cook for the full 1 1/2 hours- just boiled the chicken, then chunked, then started from there.  I'd say it took about an hour altogether.

Great recipe!  My modifications were: 3 cans of cream of chicken, one onion and used my own biscuit recipe rather than box.  Will make this again and likely reduce the onion to 1/2 an onion.

This was very yummy.  I did change a few things.  I actually made my own cream of chicken soup from scratch (just  a cream soup base with chicken bouillon).  No peas.  Added a bit of garlic/herb season mix.  Added sour cream - yummmmy.  No onion.  Also, unfortunately I didn't have the resources to add dumplings, so no dumplings.  However, I made a bit of rice to go on the bottom of the bowl and some toasted garlic bread.  :)  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it!

This was so good!!! I couldnt stop going back for more. I did not follow the directions on how to cook it excatly but I did use all the ingredients called for minus the celery. This is a great variation on chicken and dumplings to get some veggies in...kinda like chicken and dumplings meet chicken pot pie...yum!!!

Made this tonight and loved it!  It was so easy and tasty.  I used cheap canned biscuit cut or torn in small pieces and that made for really good dumplings.  Will definitely make this again!

This isn't going to be the world's most helpful review, because I departed from the recipe in several key ways.  (I normally try to follow them as written, at least the first time.  Sigh.)  Anyway, I used all of Clairellen's proportions - carrots, spices, etc. - but substituted one sweet potato for the white potatoes, because it was all that I had.  I also used homemade chicken stock instead of the water.  The big difference, though, was that I didn't use the condensed soup.  Instead, I added the equivalent amount of water (about 20 oz), simmered everything for a half hour, and then whisked a few tablespoons of flour into a cup of half-and-half, added that to the stew, and cooked until thickened slightly.  The result was probably a little thinner than Clairellen's original, but still very tasty - a credit to her flavors, because I didn't use the condensed soup!  I'm giving this one four stars because the cooking time seems long for skinless, boneless chicken breasts.  Thanks for the recipe and the inspiration!

Have not tried this recipe.  However when I cook it, and I've tried it both ways, instead of mixing bisquik, just add canned bisquits and do same.

My mom's recipe at its finest. Of course different amounts, so i bet its the best cause it sure is for us also. Now you can even add some cheese, your choice, and serve over bisquits or toast, always a hit no matter who you are.

Instead of adding peas, I added green food coloring, it gave it a green color, and it doesn't affect the way it tastes.  I also added a can of chicken broth.  It is excellant.

This is a homey dish great for when it's snowing outside. I added extra thym, basil, and sage.  I also used 2 cups chicken broth and 1 cup of water, instead of 3 cups of water.

I followed the recipe as-is with the only exception being that I sauteed the carrots, onion, and celery before adding the rest of the first addition of ingredients.  My whole family LOVED this!  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks!

These were the best Chicken and Dumplings I made so far. The only thing I changed is used chicken broth instead of water. It made more than 6 servings, but neither me nor my husband are complaining. We had leftovers for a few days and it was delicious. Would make again and again and again. Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

OMG.  Hands down the BEST chicken and dumplings I've ever had!  I've made this several times, and it turns out perfectly.  I'm a bit of a health nut, so the only modification I make is I use reduced fat/fat free soup.  Other than that, I follow the recipe exactly.  You won't be disappointed!

my boyfriend loves a "thick" soup, and I have known as long as I've been cooking for him that Chicken and Dumplings is the best way to satisfy him. I have used several base recipes from this website, but tonight we had this one, and I have to say that out of all of them I've tried this yielded the most (enough to satisfy four with GIGANTIC appetites) The Cream of chicken soup gave it an amazing flavor! I did make several changes that I think were key to my own success, although I KNOW that the recipie on it's own deserves the 4 1/2 stars.  First of all, instead of water I used Chicken broth. This gave it a much more dynamic flavor. Also, I used an entire chicken (cut in 8 pieces and then shredded later) and cooked it for the regular time. I used far more vegetables than the recipe called for. I cooked it very slow (probably about 2 1/2 hours on a lower heat) and I added the carrots and potatoes in the first stage of the cooking.  I also used the dumpling recipe found in the very first review and they were phenomenal! Every time I make chicken and dumplings from now on I'm going to use this recipie!!

This was amazing! Even my husband, who refuses chicken in all forms ate 2 bowls of this. I made the mistake of doubling the recipe. Normally there isn't quite enough for everyone, this made a huge pot. Good thing we all liked it lol. It's going to be dinner for a few days.  I did add a few things though. I cut the onions up a little smaller, and the chicken as well to start off with. I also added a bay leaf, some thyme and a little roasted garlic powder to it. It would have been good without it though too. Also I didn't make the dumplings with a box mix, because I didn't have any I used my grandmother baking powder biscuit recipe, and I don't think it made a difference either. This one is more about the stew. So yummy. Will sure make this one again!!!

I'm sorry, I really wanted to love this Recipe, but it just isn't happening. There was way too much Dumpling Dough, I could only use about half of the Amount stated. And you should really use diced Potatos instead of cutting them in Quarters. They were too big and didn't cook all the way through on the Low Heat. I ended up having to cook them a lot longer than it said. The Flavor was good, but not great. If I ever make this again, I will use way more Water or Broth to make it more soupy and add more Salt and maybe some Rosemary.

My husband and I enjoyed this on a cold winter night.  The kids (4 and 6) thought it was gross.  I cooked it in the crock pot and the chicken was very tender.  The potatoes took about an hour.

Wow. I'd never made chicken and dumplings before, but this was amazing. I didn't have biscuit mix, so I used the substitute recipe, and since my son doesn't like potatoes, I omitted those. (I meant to serve mashed potatoes on the side, but this smelled sooo good cooking that I just wanted to get it to the table!) My normally picky kids absolutely LOVED this, and have asked that I make it often. Thank you so much for sharing. This is definitely comfort food at its best.

I had to add water at the end because it got too thick and use less of the dumpling mix, but the end result was excellent - my family loved this one.

This recipe is our family favorite! The only change I started making is to double the soup for extra gravy. Thank you so much for sharing this!!!

Everything was on the right track with flavour until the potatoes were added.  You need to add an extra can of soup or just 1 cup of chopped potatoes, otherwise when you get to seconds you have no gravy left and quite alot of the flavour was replaced witht the flavour of the potato.  I also tried the recipe from this site for herbed dumplings...just follow the advise from the reviews...was fantastic.

My family really liked the chicken and dumplings the only earson I gave it 4 stars was that the broth was a bit thick for my taste. It seemed more like gravy.  I will add chicken stock next time to thin it out a bit.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

There really wasnt much taste to this recipe. I did use 3 cups of chicken broth instead of water and didnt put the dumpling in as I made homemade biscuits. It was a good soup but nothing that I would say I have to make again.

Really very good, but save this one for a Sunday when you plan on cooking all afternoon. It is time consuming, although as my boyfriend exclaimed, "worth the wait!" I thought so too, but this recipe could be made quite a bit faster with a few adjustments. I have made this several times and now throw the chicken in my pressure cooker for about 15 minutes then add onion/celery/seasoning and cook about 20 min. Then add potatoes/carrots and cook 30 min. Then do dumplings.

This was very good, and yeah - quite a big time investment.  It took about a half hour longer to cook the potatoes than the recipe states and the dumplings took longer too.  I've got WAY more than 5 servings, so there's leftovers.  Good thing it was really tasty.

Very good!  I put the potatoes and carrots in after an hour of cooking so they would have an hour to cook, which they really needed (a half hour isn't enough if you want to get really soft potatoes.)  I also replaced the celery with broccoli because my family doesn't like celery, though I think it overpowered the chicken flavor.  My family really liked it!

My hubby's English and he really likes (what I call) "cosy" food.  This was super easy to make and a real hit with my DH!  I halved the recipe and left out the onions, but subbed with 3 (large) cloves of garlic.  It was delicious!  We'll probably try some sage in the dumplings next time, maybe wine instead of the water.  It was perfect as is, though.

I was looking for a stew recipe and came across this.  Other than using chicken broth in place of water and choosing to have buscuits on the side instead of in the stew, wow, so very good!  The soups gave it a creamy rich tasting gravy that we just loved!  Made the house smell good for hours!  Thanks!

Excellent and easy to sub lower calorie ingredients.  I divided the recipe in 1/2 and made it *mostly* as written.  I used Healthy Request cream of chicken soup, Heart Smart (I think it is called) Bisquick mix, threw a bouillon cube into the cooking water and left out the potatoes.  I'm almost wishing I'd made the whole recipe as my husband was caught eating the rest of the stew out of the pot!!  Easy, filling... really cozy comfort food! Thank you for such a great idea!

This was a nice change from the regular chicken and dumplings. I made homemade dumplings and added about 2 cans of chicken broth. It was very hearty and great comfort food.

This is a fantastic and easy to follow recipe...thanks!  I of course had to tweak it a little to reflect what I actually had in my kitchen!  I used one can of low sodium Swanson's chicken broth, 5 cubes of chicken boullion and 5 cups of water. Since I was improvising I also squeezed half of a fresh lime into the broth (I read that citrus 'brightens' any soup!).  Anyway...the dish turned out fantastic and my VERY picky husband ate himself silly!  Even the kids loved it!  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

this recipe is better than mom's homemade. Its perfect for a rainy weekend. it is thicker than the normal chicken and dumpling soup, it is more like a stew. But a wonderful stew.

I used only one can of cream of chicken and one can of chicken broth and about 1/2 cup of water. I had more of a gravy sauce rather than soup. I made a smaller batch as well and didn't really measure anything out. But I did use all of the ingredients except the pease, I felt that the carrots, celery and potatoes were plenty. Also, I don't have poultry seasoning so I just used fresh rosemary from my garden, thyme and salt and pepper and it was awesome. My husband said it was the best thing I've ever made!

My kids just went nuts over this!! I was worried since I had not made it before but they just loved it.  I had leftover rotisserie chicken from the other night, then at the grocery stores' frozen dept. they had frozen dumplings.  I never noticed them before, so it gave me the idea.  Came home and searched the ususal allrecipes!  I only used 1 can of crm chix soup, 1.5 cans of chx broth, the peas/carrots and just 1/2 can of cubed potatoes instead of dicing whole ones.  Besides have you noticed the price of potatoes?? Thickened it up w/ corn starch plopped the dumplings on and WAH-LAH! Probably better on a night thats not 80 degrees, but very good!

Great, wholesome recipe.  Very comforting...  I made it on a cool, cloudy fall day and it truly hit the spot.  I didn't have baking mix, so I made homemade dumplings using 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 egg, 1/4 cup milk and parsley.  I also didn't use the cream of celery soups and instead used chicken base and thickened the stew with corn starch.

I have had this recipe for years and it is one of my most requested. I add 3 cans of cream of chicken soup/with herbs in it and it is FANTASTIC! I do add a few additional spices but it is just a matter of taste. If you have not tried this one, once you do, you will be hooked!

I threw it all into a slow-cooker and cooked on high for 4 hours. It was very good, but I made the dumplings separately on the stove. Next time I won't add as many vegetables- mainly potatoes, because they kind of overtake the dish. Then again, it probably wouldn't be "Irish Chicken and Dumplings" without all the potatoes.

I won't lie, this was pretty darn tasty.  The first time I made it, my brother and I split the huge batch into two portions and ate it all.  Sooooo good.  Also, if you're worried about being a bad cook, stop, because you CAN NOT mess this recipe up.

Great taste; next time I will cut the baking mix part in half.  I got way too much dumpling.  Also will add some broth to give a little more liquid.  Very good though!

THIS IS THE FIRST CHICKEN AND DUMPLINGS THAT I MADE THAT TURNED OUT AND IT WAS YUMMY. USED FROZEN BISCUITS THAT THAWED DURING THE COOKING PROCESS AND CUT THEM HALFWAY HORIZONTALLY THEN CUT THAT INTO FOUR EQUAL PIE PIECES. USED CHICKEN BROTH INSTEAD OF WATER OMITTING THE SALT. DIDN'T COOK AS LONG AS SUGGESTED. INITIALLY COOKED FOR 1 HOUR AND COOKED POTATOS AND CARROTS FOR 20 MINUTES.

This really is a great comfort food.  I cooked exactly as directed except I used chicken broth inplace of the water to boil the chicken and veggies.  Next time I will not cook the chicken for so long on low as mine became a little rubbery and I will only make half of the dumpling mixture, I would prefer this a little more soupy.

This is an excellent recipe.  It is very time consuming to make, but it's not difficult.  I used cream of mushroom the last time I made it by accident, but it was still very good.  I also chop my potatoes into smaller pieces instead of just quartering them.  I used a roll of biscuits from the refrigerated section to make my dumplings.  This is much easier and just as good.

The flavor was good but there was not nearly enough liquid, I would add at least another can of soup and more water, the dumplings cooked quickly but had no taste, I made buttermilk biscuit dough. For the amount of time and effort it was just not really worth it, it's just like chicken pot pie filling.

SAVORY--Fantastic flavor.  I grew up on flat dumplings, and my husband likes the refrigerated biscuits as dumplings.  This is a great compromise, and actually we like it better.  I didn't have potatoes or carrots on hand(only a can of mixed vegetables), so I did not add the 1 teaspoon of salt.  Without potatoes, no need for additional salt since it already had 2 cans of soup.  Whole family had a bad cold--this was very soothing and comforting!  A++

I gave this 5 stars because I really didn't have anything to compare it to - but we really enjoyed it in our house (even my 3 1/2 yr. old) I used 3 cups of chicken broth,1 can cream of chix, 1 can cream of celery and didn't have any problem with it being dry - i overused the celery but that isn't a big deal - and i just seasoned it extra with poultry seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder and didn't find anything bland about it. Also just used a generic biscuit mix package - put some garlic powder and paprika in that and dumped them in (the stew was at a full boil) they turned out good.
so overall, i would make this again and found it to be filling and satisfying.

Saw the recipe this morning, and had it for a late lunch. Excellant! My husband really enjoyed it. Very hearty, and wonderful on a cold/sick day. True comfort food. I did use chicken broth instead of water, and used Martystars recipe for dumplings. A+ Recipe, will definately keep using.-Jess

Delicious! My wife and I love this recipe. The main thing I change is to leave out the potatoes and use chicken stock instead of water. I make a large batch and freeze it in meal size containers. Great on a cold night.

Oh my goodness this was amazing!  I've never had chicken and dumplings before, but as I put it all together, I saw it looked a lot like chicken and biscuits - so I kept the potatoes out of the stew and served it over mashed potatoes.  It hit hte spot!  I didn't have poultry seasoning so I added some garlic powder, crushed rosemary, basil and a bay leaf. I added the carrots at the begining of the cooking time, and they were nice and tender.  For the dumplings, I followed someone elses advice and used 1c. of bisquick, 1/3c. milk, some fresh parsley and some garlic powder.  The only difference in the recipe I made was to use 1 onion - all I had on hand - and used 2 cans of Cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom, and used chicken broth instead of water.  I added a little more water at the end of the recipe, as I was afraid it would be too thick to cook the dumplings in.  So delicious!  Will be making again and again!!!

This recipe is great!  I altered it a bit to make more of a thick soup because I was a little worried that there wouldn't be enough liquid.  I used 6 cups of chicken broth as opposed to the 3 cups of water, and then added 2 more cups of water just before making the dumplings.  I used frozen green beans instead of the peas and added some sliced mushrooms in place of the potatoes.  I found the ratio for dumpling mix to milk to be a bit off... I used about 3.5 cups of mix to make the dough more stiff.  I added 2 tablespoons of fresh rosemary to the dumplings as well.  All in all, this was easy and tasty.

I altered the recipe a little and the taste was spot on. I did NOT alter the dumpling part and it didn't turn out right at all. I should have listened to other reviewers and done something different there. WAY too much dough!

I've been craving chicken dumplings for a while now so I had very high hopes for this recipe. Since past reviewers stated it was bland, I used 3/4 tsp of pepper and poultry seasoning and only used 2 potatoes cut into bite size pieces. The chicken shredded beautifully and it really did smell good. I cut down on the dumplings like reviewer Suemck recommended, but I still had a big blob on top. I was able to break them down during the cooking. My 16 month and I ate it and really enjoyed it. My 3-1/2 year old forced himself to eat it and wasn't too happy. My husband didn't even touch it. I picked out all the dumplings from the leftovers and am planning on making a potpie with them. My family might enjoy it more in that form. This was good, but I think the "stew" would be better in a potpie since it wasn't very liquidy after you add all the dumplings.

The flavor of this was really good, but like other reviewers, I found there to be way too many dumplings and too many potatoes.  I had to add more water to compensate, and my dumplings all kind of glopped together.  I have another chicken and dumpling recipe that I think I prefer, but I'm glad I tried this one anyways, thanks!

The seasonings I used were sage, thyme, parsley, garlic (fresh cloves, chopped), & pepper. I think egg dumplings would have been better...the milk ones don't hold up well over a longer period of time. Was a huge hit though!!

This is wonderful! My grandmother is from Bantry, Co. Cork, Ireland and this is identical to her famous recipe except we add mushrooms to it! This was my first time making it...I did use 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom and canned biscuits, which probably could have cooked just a bit longer, but it still turned out great:)

Was sooooo yummy! Added the 2/3 cups of milk suggested and added two chicken bouillon cubes to pot. Also when doing the baking mix,I used bisquick. But found that after it cooked the first 10min.with lid on, it just wasnt cooking right. So,I put it in the oven on 325 degrees for the remaining 10min. came out perfect. The best dumplings I've had in a long time.Thanks for a great recipe. Wil be a keeper in this house.

I love chicken and dumplings and this recipe was easy and SO good!  I put my potatoes and carrots in at the beginning and they were still a bit crunchy after the two hours, but they got done eventually.  Very yummy!

Excellent, My husband is a very picky eater and is always skeptical when I make new recipes, he loved it! The only changes I made was that I used 2 cups chicken broth replacing 2 cups of water, I used red potatoes, and I used the recipe for the dumplings on the Jiffy Baking Mix box. It was really good!

I have never had Chicken and Dumplings, but I went ahead with this one becuase it seemed simple.  It was and it was delicious.  The only questions I had were - Was there enough liquid in the soup for the dumplings and veggies?  YES!  At first the soup seemed really thick, but it did thin out by the time I added all of that.  And my other question - would the biscuits be cooked all the way through or soggy?  They were cooked all the way through and to perfection!  The only changes I made were, after adding the soup and water - I added 2 chicken bullions for some extra flavor.  

GREAT recipe.  My Husband LOVED it!

ehh...not impressed. A lot of trouble, too. Bland. Too many potatoes. Plus, they were not done in 30 minutes- even though I cut them fairly small.

This was great!  My whole family had seconds.  I couldn't find a good deal on breasts, so used boneless skinless thighs instead.  Also I only had one can of cream of chicken so I used cream of celery for my second can.  I think this dish could've used a little more salt, but that's just a personal preference.

Wonderful!! Used 2 C broth and 1 C water. Cooked in a crockpot all day and then moved to the stove to cook the potatoes, carrots, and then the dumplings. Made dumplings from another recipe. Delicious and very easy to make. Family loved it. Will make often. Thanks!

Very tasty!  I used refrigerated biscuits and 1 cup of chicken broth in place of 1 cup of water.  Would have been nicer to have the "gravy" thicker.  Next time maybe I'll thicken it.

The flavor of this dish is really good, however I do not like the mixture of potatoes and dumplings.  I would prefer dumplings only, because they are soooo good with the bisquick!  Thank you for sharing.

this was good, but I would use less dumplings next time.  It might have been the baking mix I used, but I thought it was too much.  I took most of them out for leftovers.

Delicious, and with the leftovers, I added some more chicken broth and egg noodles and it made an awesome chicken noodle soup! My husband who isn't a big chicken fan loved it!!

Wonderful!! Exactly like chicken and dumplings 'should' taste.  I had to leave out the poultry seasoning, and I cubed 5 red potatoes (about 1" chunks) instead of quartering (mine were huge).  I also made my own baking mix (1 cup flour, 1 1/2tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 TBS shortening).  I doubled that to make 2 cups baking mix and that was plenty. The chicken was ssooo tender.  Mine stuck to the pan a bit, I will make sure to stir it more often next time.

I liked this recipe but it didn't blow me away.  I think I'm a little prejudice against condensed cream of chicken soup and Bisquick for that matter.  I don't have any to die for recipes using either product although I know they are both very popular.  I just wanted to make chicken and dumplings so I tried it.  My husband liked this.  But I guess if I'm going to spend hours cooking I want to do something REALLY from scratch.  We'll definitely eat the leftovers w/ a smile.

I'm giving it three stars because I loved it and my wife hated it.  If you like chicken and dumplings and are looking for a solid recipe, (and I assume you are because you've gotten this far) this is it.  If I ever get divorced, I'll make it once a week.  Nice job Claire!

I was worried about the amount of liquid in the pot when it started cooking, so I ended up adding 2 cans of water to the mixture. I did not use peas.I also used less potato. I chose the less sodium variety of soups, and used cream of mushroom and cream of chicken. My boyfriend wants me to make it again because he didn't get much of the leftovers! I even enjoyed it and I'm not a chicken person.

My family loved this! I bypassed shredding the chicken and just diced it before cooking, to save time and it came out great! I also used frozen carrots as well and cubed the potatoes smaller so they would cook faster! Very good for a cold evening!

Loved this version of chicken and dumplings. Great on a cold day!! The cream soups gave it great flavor.  I also found that the bottom burned a little when I added the dupmlings. I would suggest stirring lightly after adding.  Otherwise, GREAT~

I made this last night for company and they adored it!  I replaced the potatoes with button mushrooms, because I thought the dish would be too starchy with potatoes AND the dumplings.  I also added some dried rosemary and thyme. Add a salad and some crusty bread, makes a fantastic dinner for guests!  Thanks!

My family just got finished eating this meal, and we thought it was really tasty. I followed the advice of previous users and replaced the water with chicken broth. I also quartered the potatoes, but next time I will use less potatoes and cut them into bite sized pieces. I recommend halfing the recipe on the Bisquick box for dumplings too! It made just the right amount for us! I will most likely make this meal again! Thanks Claire!

Very good recipe and we will definitely have it again.  My husband thought that it was a little soupy, but I disagree.  I followed the recipe exactly, and thought it was fine as is.  Chicken and dumplings is not an extremely flavorful dish anyways (it's simple, warm and comforting), and I thought this was a wonderful version.  It was very easy.  Warning:  when it came time to add the dumplings and bring to a boil, I did not stir it and some veggies got stuck and burned on the bottom of the pot.

Excellent flavor.  One of my new favorites and it was just as good as leftovers.  I will probably cut the onions and potatoes a little smaller than only quartering next time, they both seemed big compared to the rest of the veggies.  But regardless, it was an excellent meall  Thanks for sharing!

This was a first ever attempt at Chicken and Dumplings, which has been a personal favorite for twenty years. I would've never imagined how simple this recipe was. I would recommend cutting the potaoes to a bite size. this will be a recipe cherished by me for many years to come, Thanks!!

Wow.  Hearty, delicious, and surprisingly easy.  It's good the first day as chicken and dumplings, and equally as good as leftover chicken stew (I take out the dumplings before storing in the fridge, so they don't get soggy).  This will be a new winter favorite for us.

This recipe was a disaster!!If you look closely the recipe calls for only two cans of soup and 3 cups of water.  There is no way that all that chicken, veggies and biscuit dough can cook in that amount of liquid.  The measurements in this recipe seem to be way off.  Not only did I have to add another can of soup and 1 cup of water, but when I went to add the dough for the dumplings I had to turn up the heat so it would boil, which resulted in everything burning at the bottom of the pan!  The 3 cups of bisquit mix and milk make way too many dumplings for this dish.  I could only use about have the batter -what a waste!  Definately would not make this again.

Really easy and very delicious.  I did use cream of celery in place of cream of chicken soup, as that's what I had.  I also used canned biscuits in place of the dumplings.

This was sooo good! It was snowy and windy last night, and this was the perfect dinner. My mom makes this dish w/o vegatables and lots of pepper, but I loved the addition and the flavor of the veggies (I left the peas out though). I added more salt, pepper, and poultry seasoning than the recipe called for and I used a whole cut up chicken then took the meat off the bones. It was great. Next time I will try using low fat soup to make the dish a little lighter.

I can now say that I have made chicken and dumplings. Good flavor but I added additional salt, fresh ground black pepper and poultry seasoning. Also added garlic powder and used a package of commerically prepared dumplings that were cut in half. Kids ate their portions when I picked out certain veggies. Served with corn muffins and a salad. Made a lot. Tasted good and warm to the tummy but I doubt I will ever make again.

I made this recipe for my cousin and her boyfriend, and they loved it. I ended up having to add about a cup of a flour/water mixture to increase and thicken the soup. I added mushrooms with the peas. I used refrigerated biscuits torn up for the dumplings (they were great!) I chopped up the onion and potato smaller than quartered, but I may want them smaller still, and although I like onions, maybe just one big one would be plenty. I think I will skip the peas next time--I'm not a fan. Otherwise, it was a great cold and rainy day dish!

So so good.  I did cut the biscuit recipe in half though and it still overflowed!  I make this repeatedly and there is never any leftovers.

WE LOVED THIS!  My husband and older daughter love chicken & dumplings but I'd never made them before.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out soooo goooood!  In fact, during dinner, my husband said "This gets an A+!"

This dish was great the only thing you will have to do is thicken the gravy it is way to thin I used a flour and water slurry also I added some diced green onions to the dumplings for more flavor other than that it is a great dish

They said this was good and they are right!  It's hearty and tastes great!  It isn't difficult at all, just a lot of waiting time. Next time I will only use half the dumplings because I was dodging many of them to get to the liquid and the potatoes.

This was delicous! The dumplings made it sooo yummy. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. Even though it takes a while you dont really have to do much. My family also enjoyed it. Thanks for a tasty dish that serves us well on a cold night.

Very good! Husband and daughter love it.  I used my own dumpling recipe and double the salt amount and add a dash of cayenne pepper.  Also, be sure to chop the potatoes and onions to bite sizes as suggested by others.  I didn't have cream of chicken soup so I used cream of mushroom instead.  Still turned out great.

This was actually a 5 star recipe, but when I got down to the baking mix and milk, it made nothing but mush.  I followed the directions on the Jiffy Baking Mix box, and only used 2 cups baking mix and 2/3 cups milk.  It turned out wonderfully after I fixed the dumpling recipe.  It's a keeper!

This recipe is wonderful.  It takes quite a bit of time to prepare though, and I didn't have a lot of room for the dumplings in my pot. But tastes fabulous either way.

My family liked this, and for my kids that's a real compliment!  They are extremely picky - I had to leave out the peas or they never would have touched it.  I used low fat soups and it came out great!   I cooked it for 30 minutes on a Sunday, and finished cooking it on Monday.

Very good and very easy.  Keep in mind that once you put the dumplings in it will become more salty, otherwise, it can become too salty very easily.

My first attempt at chicken and dumplings, I made this for a cold winter's lunch. The kids absolutely loved it, and the wife who generally loathes "dumplings" was converted, raving about how great this recipe was.

I made this for St. Paddy's Day and it was a HUGE hit at our house!  I'd never made dumplings before, but these were SO easy.  I used only one onion and cut both the onion and potato pieces a little smaller than called for in the recipe.  I also cooked the dumplings a bit longer.  Wonderful!  A great alternative to the traditional Corned Beef and Cabbage.

Excellent, my husband & I both loved it.  I didn't shred the chicken, but cut it into small chunks which worked quite well.  This recipe will definitely be a keeper!

Made this (along w/ Irish Stew) for our St. Pat's dinner.  Man, this was the bomb!  Spending the afternoon cooking was well worth it when the results are devoured!  The 'sauce' was so tasty and the chicken was great but the next time, I think I'll add more carrots and cut the potatoes just a 'leetle' bit smaller (my chunks were too big).  Definitely a 5 star rating!  Sierramum

This has become one of my favorite recipes. It's not difficult to make and is so good. After making it the first time, I have made it many times and it is a permanent part of my recipe box. Very hearty, tasty and satisfying. Hint: The dumpling recipe is way too big. I cut it in half or use my own recipe for butter dumplings.

this was an ok recipe-but there wasnt enough soup in it.  I ended up adding another can of soup and 2 cans of water and a lot more seasonings.  After that, it had a good flavor-it was very satisfying and yummy-made a whole lotta food-the dumplings were excellent!

I made this for the first time this past St. Patricks Day and I am throwing away the old Corn Beef and Cabbage recipe!  This is the most tastiest recipe and easy. I added 4 cups of soup and next time I will be adding more carrots.  This recipe moves to the top of my list. I can not tell you how good it is. Great for a cold day or just a nice family gathering!  5 STARS!!!

This dish is easy to prepare and tastes great. It was a bit saucy, so next time I will make less sauce. I used one extra chicken breast, but I did not shred the meat. I cut each breast half into 4 pieces. We enjoyed having hunks of chicken meat in the dish. I also used 6 potatoes instead of four. Even with these additions, the dish was very soupy. The biscuits were great. I did cook them for a total of 25 minutes, just to be sure they were fully cooked. This is definitey a make again!

Excellent tasting, not too difficult to make, a great crowd pleaser.  The only thing that I changed was to omit the peas, but that's a purely personal preference!

This was a yummy dish. It needed seasoning, but that was easy. Try adding McCormick’s Perfect Pinch vegetable seasoning to taste. I also cut the veggies smaller and added a little less milk to the dumpling batter.  We LOVED it!

Absolutely loved this recipe! Super simple but delivers delicious results - my wife couldn’t stop talking about how much she loved it. Followed some of the other comments and used chicken broth (unsalted) instead of water and also tossed a smashed garlic clove in. I cut the potatoes into bite sized pieces and think the smaller chunks definitely helped them come out tender (used russet and cut into 16ths). I used Martystar’s dumpling recipe and it couldn’t have been easier. I followed her instructions and also added in a pinch of black pepper and about a 1/2 tsp of dried thyme. Can’t wait to make this again!

Well first of all, I learned this recipe from my mother.  Both of my parents, and myself are from Ireland.  Its such a comfort food.  My mom would actually make it as a shepards pie, and put mashed potatoes on it and put dish in oven until the potatoes were slightly browned.  Its a great meal for a big family, or even a small one, because the leftovers are delish.  ty for sharing!  Im making it as I type, lol.  My mom always let it simmer a long time so, at my age old habits are hard to change.  I put the chicken mixture in dutch oven and let it simmer on low for hours.  Turn it off.  Then make the potatoes.  and put back in oven.  Im not changing original recipe, just giving other ideas on how to use the delicious base of posters recipe

I killed my dumplings by mixing them in before they set but this dish was amazing, And it's better the second day! I had no celery but celery salt is a staple in my kitchen and we only buy almond milk , and used canned peas and added canned chicken cause again it's what I had, my family, neighbor and friends helped enjoy this recipe
Thanks very much! Enjoy

We absolutely loved this recipe! It's my new "go to" for chicken and dumplings! I diced the onion and celery and sauteed them in a bit of butter, and I used a 32oz box of chicken stock instead of water. Just delicious, thank you for sharing your recipe!

As others have said: The dumpling recipe, as written, makes way too much. The dough covered the entire surface of my stockpot, so none of them were able to cook. I had to scoop out some of them, separate the remaining ones to give them room, and cook them at least ten minutes longer. Also, could not keep the lid on, because my large pot was not large enough. You need to use a really large pot for this full recipe. Mine overflowed and the dumplings pushed the top off. 

With all of that said, the flavor was good. I did not have cream of chicken soups, so just used 5 cups water and 5 tsp of Chicken-flavored Better than Bouillion. I thickened it up with a little milk and corn starch mixed in a cup and slowly added to the boiling stew. It worked well. 

The only other thing I changed was to add a sprinkle of garlic salt. I didn't think it was bland at all. It tasted great - just had issues with the proportions and the dumpling recipe. So, next time, larger pot so it all fits, and half the dumpling recipe so they have room. This dumpling recipe was a bit gooey for dropping into the stew. I may use the good 'ol Bisquick one next time.

Thanks for helping with dinner! I do love chicken and dumplings, and I prefer the biscuit kind to the noodle kind.

I made this with cream of chicken with herbs, chicken broth instead of water and use biscuit dough for dumplings. I tear small pieces, sprinkle with poultry seasoning and roll into little balls. Fantastic recipe.

Love this recipe.  I love the dumpling part of Chicken and Dumplings so I did not put the potatoes in.  I figured the dumplings provide the carbs so did not need the potatoes.  I did use chicken broth rather than water.  Was very good, will use again and again.

Justed used the dumpling part. Used whole wheat flour and one egg. Since I used an egg I added an extra cup of flour and got a slightly bigger batch. Also added some baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon.
For the broth I used water, boneless thighs (pre boiled for about 20 min), some carrots, and yams.
Simmered 10 min covered and 10 uncovered as per.
Two of my daughters were visiting and they really liked it.

I made this tonight and it is a great starter.  Of course I made a few changes (I always do).  I used chicken broth instead of water and increased it to 4 cups.  Did not have frozen peas so used frozen mixed vegetables. I cut the chicken up and sautéed it in olive oil.  Then added the celery and garlic and onions cut up to the same pan.  Then I added the seasonings listed plus many of my favorites.  When all was browned I added it the pot that I had simmering with broth potatoes and carrots.  I will definitely only use half the dumpling mix next time and am willing to try the recipe for homemade ones another poster listed.  All in all a nice recipe.  Much quicker than my “boil the whole chicken all day recipe” I normally make.

This dish was fantastic! Instead of chicken breast, I bought two rotisserie chickens and stripped the meat. The combination of white and dark meat was just delicious. I used my own dumpling recipe. My husband loved it and I’ll be making this again.

Yum. I didn't have peas and only used half an onion. I also used broth instead of water after reading the reviews. I also made half the dumplings.

For dumplings I used Mary B’s dumplings (frozen), otherwise I didn’t make any substitutions, but added some red pepper flakes, it was very good, and the main important thing, my husband loved it! Thanks for the recipe.

No doubt about it... awesome comfort food!  I made this recipe twice. The 1st time I followed the recipe exactly and thought that it lacked a little depth in the taste. Also the dumplings absorbed too much of the broth in the cool down. So there was enough broth for the first night, but the on the next night for the leftovers, I added Chicken stock to the stew.  The 2nd time I made this recipe, I used Chicken stock instead of the water. That gave the dish a more robust flavor, and I cut the amount of dumplings in half and the remedied the absorption of the broth issue. Overall its like I said earlier, Awesome comfort food!

It was decent. Could use more seasoning and it tasted like it was missing something. Over all would make again.

This recipe was very easy to make and tasted just like I remembered my Irish grandmother would make when I was a kid.  It is a good basic recipe and can be modified to suit personal tastes.   

I'm not a fan of dumplings but these came out the way I thought they should.  After the first meal, I removed them from the dish and  when we reheated the chicken for a second meal, I put the dumplings under the broiler to brown them.

In place of chicken breast I heavily seasoned and roasted a whole chicken and used the drippings in the soup base.  Very good recipe!

This was very disappointing. It had no flavor. As others suggested, I used chicken broth instead of water. I can't imagine what it would have tasted like with water.

Followed recipe precisely. Was very tasty, but different than old style chicken and dumplings. I will make again, however will add some cornstarch maybe for thickening purposes.

Wow!  Delicious!  I added chicken broth base and about 3 cups more water to the recipe because I like a lot of soup. I like to add the powered broth base so I can make it richer. I cut up the chicken and threw everything in the pot together.  I let it come to a boil and then cooked it on low for about 30 minutes more before adding the dumplings.  I thickened the stew with a few teaspoons of corn starch before I added the dumplings.  One of my favorite recipes and a lot like the one my dad use to make.

I never use biscuit mix, bisquick or anything similar, so I used a different recipe from scratch. 
The chicken part was ok, but the basic recipe sounded boring so I added a touch of chili powder, my own spices, potatoes, and  chicken stock instead of water.

I'm not a huge chicken and dumplings fan so have little experience in what is good vs is not. That being said, this was pretty flavorful. I used all chicken broth in place of the water and everything else as written with salt and pepper to my taste. I can see why this recipe gets good reviews overall. My only concern for this recipe is that it was like eating pot pie filling with dumplings. When I make this again I will likely omit the potatoes all together because they made it very crowded and with dumplings I don't think I will miss them. A hearty meal for sure though and worth a try, even if you find most chicken and dumpling meals bland like I do.

This recipe is great, except for the dumplings.  The second time I made it, I used the dumpling recipe in MARTYSTARS review. They are really good dumplings and easy to make. so don't be afraid to try making your own! I took off one star for the dumplings.

Instead of 2 cans I used 4 cans of Campbell's Cream of Chicken soup gave it more of a stew consistency. Omit the water all together. Then I kicked up the seasoning by adding 5 Tbsp's of Montreal Chicken  by McCormick. WOW! Punched it up and added a 5 star rating from my dinner guest. Without the changes  this is a very plain and boring recipe. My  opinion

I don't know how in cooking for over 40 years, I never made chicken and dumplings. Good recipe and I made it as written. Next time, I will increase the veggies and use less meat (preference) and add a little more of the same seasonings to the milk before stirring in the baking mix. The dumplings while good were a bit boring. None of this will go to waste, though - haha - it might go to waist.  Yummy and thanks for sharing. * have also used chicken stock/broth instead of water which bumps up the flavor a bit. Also good, but not "necessary."

I liked this recipe a lot because it was easy to adjust to what I had. I also read previous reviews and added chicken bouillon equal parts with the water for chicken stock.  My cream of chicken was actually from another recipe I made with cream of chicken that served like a gravy in my crockpot. I had so much left over that I totally saved it for this recipe which is probably where all my bonus flavors came in. I used frozen corn instead of peas. Some frozen tater tots instead of the potatoes and one can of refrigerated jumbo biscuits. Each buiscuit cut into fours. I'm such a cheater, but this is what I had

I used another receipt for the dumplings.  I also seasoned my dumplings.  It was great.

Dumpling recipe:
To Make Dumplings: In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt. In a small bowl, mix together 1/2 cup of milk and 2 tablespoons of oil. Pour into the dry ingredients, stirring just until moistened.

Absolutely perfect after a few small tweaks! My boyfriend is quite picky but even he called this a masterpiece! This will be my go-to chicken and dumpling recipe for years to come. 
My changes: 
-Doubled the water to 6 cups. It still turned out thick and creamy. 
-Didn't use onions due to my boyfriend's pickiness. I personally love them but this was delicious even without. 
-Raised temperature to medium-low for the long simmer. 
-Used three potatoes instead of four, diced rather than quartered. I didn't fancy the idea of a stew with large chunks of potato. 
-Once I added the peas, I raised the temperature to med-high in order to bring to a boil. After the dumpling dough was added, I lowered it to med-low.

It was a little bit thin for my tastes, but loved it otherwise! Made the boyfriend a happy man on a cold winter evening. Thanks!!

There were only two changes that I made to this recipe.  1 - I cooked everything in my Pressure cooker and I used 2 - the Bisquick dumpling recipe.  Also I tossed out the peas which I hate with a purple passion.  I did take the advice of two of the other reviewers and diced the carrots, potatoes, celery and onions - and added an extra teaspoon of poultry seasoning.  Other than those changes - this is a great recipe.

Delicious. I used 2 chicken breast and I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper,  and complete seasoning while boiling the chicken. Followed everything else as instructed and it came out great.

I made exactly as written.  Way too much dumpling.  It ends up like a giant dumpling with a little chicken and veggie in it.  With half as much, it might be ok.

I made this with left-over Thanksgiving turkey earlier this week. We absolutely loved this new recipe! My husband even hollered from the kitchen (I was still in the other room.) "THIS IS A KEEPER!!"  It has enough seasoning for a rich flavor but not too many to overwhelm a newer cook. I gave it 5 stars because it met all my expectations; used much of what I already had on hand, including left-over turkey, not complicated, rich & satisfying flavor, my whole family loved it, I could substitute a quicker method (Phillsbury and rotisserie chicken if need be) and the left-overs were even better!

*Substitute the water with chicken broth. (It makes all the difference in a recipe to use stock/broth in a recipe. There's a variety at your grocery store; chicken, beef, vegetable, turkey, etc..  fyi:Vegetable broth in a vegie stew/soup of any kind adds so much rich flavor.
*I added 1/4 tsp. celery seed. (It gave a hint of the flavor my kids love; my chicken pot pie gravy.)
*I used Philsbury Biscuits from the tube for my dumplings because I was in a hurry. Cut each biscuit in six pieces (even smaller), trust me, the dough will swell. 
*Next time I will 1.5 times the gravy.
*Makes the yummiest left-over next day!!

My husband hates dumplings so I ate the dumplings and he ate the soup and chicken.  

I added a can of chicken broth (low fat), diced up chicken breasts, added frozen peas, and a lot more onion and minced garlic.  More basil and pepper too. Hands down raved about by hubby.  He ate the entire HUGE pot of soup minus what I ate and wants it again!  Dice up more potatoes than called for too, and throw in some carrots...great stuff!

This one I am making at least once a month...

Great recipe. I used fewer potatos and substituted two cups chicken broth and one cup water for the three cups water. I changed up the spices a little, added some basil and garlic salt. Using refrigerated biscuit dough is fine, just make sure there's enough room around the dumplings to cook. I love this recipe and will definitely be making it again.

I cut up the chicken breast and cooked them in olive oil then added the celery, onion and spices.  I also used chicken broth instead of water.  Added sweet potatoes as well.  So yummy

This is a keeper!! I was looking for another way to use up chicken from a rotisserie (family of 5 on a budget, making a second meal from leftovers is a must!).  This was great! I added chicken broth instead of water and my own dumpling recipe but kept everything else the same. This will be making the rounds again.

I made this dish last night and it was delicious. I made it almost as written except I used homemade stock and only 1 can of cream of chicken soup (as I cut the recipe down). I also used canned peas as my hubby hates frozen ones. I also used boneless/skinless chicken thighs. I will definitely make this again as my picky hubs loved it.....

Normally I would not rate a recipe unless I had followed it exactly.  However I believe that since I did use the basic recipe and only omitted the peas, potatoes (didn't have any on hand), and dumplings (only due to an unforeseen time restriction) that my experience is still valid.  Having said all of that, this is a delicious  creamy chicken soup.  I loved it!  My kids told me they would have liked either rice or noodles in it.  I'm sure they would have liked the dumplings too, so I will try that next time and update my review.

For more chicken favor use chicken on the bone, not boneless skinless chicken.  We also like a mix of white and dark meat.

This is going to be a weekly treat for the rest of my days!  Like some others said, I cut the vegetables into smaller pieces.  I omitted the peas.  I hate peas!  Instead us using a mix, I made my own simple dumplings from this site and added parsley flakes.  A little more pepper than the recipe called for, and it was perfect!

This is a good base recipe for chicken and gravy using ingredients that most people will have in the house and will taste quite well when done.  I added a bay leaf and corn to the chicken while it stewed instead of the potatoes.  I would also add thyme to it the next time, but I would make this again

Excellent. Definitely use more spices and less dough, but other than that - perfect. It's like a pot pie without the carrots! :)

Hearty and warming. Made the equivalent of 3 cans condensed cream of chicken soup from scratch. Used broth instead of water, 4 cups instead of 3. Chopped the onions. Added minced onion too. 5 chicken breasts. Used the All Recipes "Dumplings" recipe with whole wheat flour instead.

My late grandmother was a horrible cook, but one of the few meals that she made well was chicken and dumplings. This was almost a carbon copy of hers. It gave me such a sense of nostalgia that it made me miss my grandmother terribly.  Thank you so much for this.

I did not use canned soup. I used chicken stock instead of water. Used cornstarch to thicken. Also added corn cut off the cobb. Seasoned to our taste, this was awesome.

My family loved this, me too. I did tweak some things per others recommendations. Used three cans of soup, Healthy Request, and did not have any chicken broth so I used 2 cups water and 1 cup of white wine. Added spices and cut back on potatoes.  You can cut back on the dumplings, I made a little over half a recipe, plenty!  Will definitely make again.

Made this for Sunday dinner, and has become a favorite.  There is a good balance of flavors, the soup adds a creaminess to the gravy while the vegetables were soft while still retaining a good texture.

This was excellent.  My only changes were to use chicken thighs instead of breasts, stock instead of water, frozen mixed veggies, and omitted the potatoes, 'cause I figured there's enough 'starch' in the dumplings.  Changes that I don't believe compromised the rating of this recipe, with maybe the exception of the stock instead of water. Still worth the 5 stars.  Thank you.

Overall pretty good, although time consuming, recipe. Kids loved it. Sauce needed to be thickened a bit and I doubled the poultry seasoning and added more pepper and garlic powder. Used chicken broth (2 cans) instead of water. Mixed veges instead of peas. Boneless skinless chicken thighs. Used about 2/3 recipe of the dumplings.

I cut the chicken into chunks before adding it in. I only used half of a big white onion. I used 1 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1 1/2 water. And used a pillsbury biscuit for the dumpling. It was awesome.

As written, this is three stars.  First problem is that 3 cups of water are not nearly enough to boil 4 chicken breasts and still have enough liquid after evaporation to have enough broth left for the soup.  I had to double the water to make it work.  I know it's an Irish dish, but even the Irish used spices in soups.  Salt isn't really enough.  It needs basil, maybe even marjoram, but at the very least it needed some garlic.  

With the above additions it was a wonderful dish best served on a cold and rainy night,

Good basic recipe.  Carrots, onions and potatoes should be diced to smaller pieces if cooking as directed.  I added garlic , soy sauce and a lot of my own spice preferences and used chicken broth in lieu of water.  I have always needed to put the dish in the over to finish the biscuits at the end.  I don’t mind them a bit doughy, but they should have some body and slight firmness to the top.

Chicken and dumplings are one of our family favorites. We enjoyed the addition of potatoes in this version. I suggest adding a little garlic, and increasing the seasoning a little. I always use a mini-scoop to place the dumplings on top of the stew mixture for a more uniform appearance. If possible, I use a dry cream soup substitute (for less sodium and fat) which I make ahead and store.

Wonderful, hearty, comfort food! As suggested by other reviewers I did add some extra seasoning (chicken bullion powder, garlic salt, cayenne pepper, fresh ground black pepper) and a third can of cream of chicken soup (we like our dishes creamy). I made the dumplings according to the recipe on the side of the Bisquick box and it was plenty for the first round. When I reheat the dish for leftovers night I plan to do another round of dumplings as they were all eaten up. I accidentally forgot to add the peas, the dish was good without them, but I will add them next time--and there will definitely be a next time!!

My family really enjoyed this. I had never made chicken and dumplings before but this recipe is great. It was so good in fact that I made a large stock pot of it and it was gone in two days! I used chicken thighs because it was all I had the first time but it was so good I'm just going to use thighs from now on.

I was surprised with how good this turned out.  I think a big part of it is to dip the dumplings into the soup with the spoon, allowing them to fall as evenly as you can place them so they are able to cook through.  Dropping them seems to be the biggest complaint about them coming out doughy and uncooked so I avoided that and it came out great!

Family loves this recipe.  I omitted the carrots and peas because they won't eat them.  I made my own poultry seasoning from Google search.  Plus I used dark meat!  I never had potatoes in a chicken n dumpling recipe, it made very good addition.

I adore this recipe! It is definitely my go to when I'm needing some comfort food. The only thing I do different is use chicken broth/stock in place of the water. And I follow the recipe on the box for the dumplings. Sublime!

I may have added a little more pepper and poultry seasoning than this recipe actually calls for, but OMG was it delicious! It made a lot for only two people but we ate all the leftovers and it was probably even better the next day. A new favorite recipe for us!

I recommend some Thyme and perhaps a bit of rubbed sage.  Also this is a great thing to do with a left over Costco chicken. If you use one (or any already cooked chicken) combine step 1 & 2 and cook for only 30-45 minutes. Notice that doing this makes it an easy weekday recipe. Especially if you prep your veggies and potato the night before. Just cut them and place I a plastic bag, with water to cover. (Measure the water and use it as part of the soup) Come home, start the liquid with the veggies. While it's getting to temperature take the meat off the chicken adding right into the pot. All that's left is to add the peas and make your dumplings. EASY

I substituted chicken thighs for the chicken breast. The recipe turned out great. So great in fact that my husband said we had to add it to the family cookbook that night!

Very yummy!!! I used cream of celery and cream if chicken, chicken bullion instead of Water, used frozen mixed veggies, and followed the dumpling recipe on the box not the amounts followed in this recipe. Turned out delicious! Would make again!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was super super thick. I usually don't follow the recipe exactly, but did since this is so highly rated. Though not awful, it was more dumplings than anything. I don't mind spending a long time in the kitchen, but "as is" this is not worth 2+ hours in the kitchen. My boyfriend liked it, but wasn't wowed. Next time, I'll probably try a different recipe or try some of the modifications suggested here.

Absolutely wonderful! I used canned biscuits instead of mix due to lack of ingredients, but otherwise, I didn't make any other changes aside from substituting chicken broth for 2 cups of water and adding a little extra season per my taste. Will definitely be making this again!

This was really good! I left out the potatoes because we like to eat it over rice and that would just be too many carbs. I doubled+ the poultry seasoning and the pepper. I also  baked my own chicken to get both dark and white meat and also boiling the carcass when doing step 1 gives it a lot of flavor. I also used 4 cups of chicken broth instead of the water. A good basic recipe. The bisquick dumplins are the best imo.

This was really good, served it to a family of 4 with second helpings and still had a lot left over! The only thing I did different was add a third can of cream of chicken while I had the chicken breasts out for shredding. I wanted it to be a bit thicker and this gave it the perfect consistency! Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

This is really good stuff.  I gave it a 4 because I did have to tweak it a bit after tasting the broth before adding the soup.  I added some chopped garlic and lemon pepper along with the seasonings above.  Like another reviewer, I used 3 cans of soup and I made the Bisquick dumplings but followed the recipe on the side of the box.  Came out delish.  Very comforting food! Thanks for sharing!

I found this chicken and dumplin' recipe to be pretty good but in the South we do not put canned cream of chicken soup in our dumplins at least no one in my family would. I cooked a whole chicken in my slow cooker with 2 fresh cloves of garlic and a couple of bay leaves. Once tender I took it off the bone and shredded into bite sized pieces. I strained the juices off the chicken and added to the water, carrots, onion, potatoes and sans the peas. I also added 4 chicken bouillon cubes for added flavor. I used a bit of flour water to make the juice a little thicker. I made my own biscuit dough for the dumplins and after 20 minutes per the directions everything turned out great! This is the first time I added carrots and potatoes to my dumplins and was really happy with the results. Only 4 stars because of the cream of chicken soup...not anything I'd consider putting in my dumplins. Thanks for this recipe it's a good start for a great recipe.

I love this recipe. Was not bland at all.. I made a few changes. I used cream of mushroom soup , one onion,plus the celery, one potato.. I added carrots and a small amount of peas...then I added sliced mushrooms and I made the dumplings.....I was trying to stay away from to much starch.. Very good.

This is so delicious, all of my four teenagers loved it.   When I make it though, I make one and a half times the broth ingredients so there's lots left over after the dumplings soak up some.  This is simply yummy.

This is my standard chicken and dumplings recipe that I grew up with - and I'm of Irish descent :) But I don't find it to be especially Irish. I was hoping for something more creative that I could change up my approach to this dish

Very good. I'd recommend using chicken broth or stock instead of water. Also, there are just two of us, so I only add peas and only cook enough dumplings for the portions we are eating that night. Then I add the peas and cook the dumplings for the other portions as I reheat them.

I liked this recipe, but I have to work on the dumplings. I used gluten-free baking mix and they came out quite dense, so we will have to come up with a better way to do these gluten-free.

We've made this recipe several times and absolutely love it!  Made one "enhancement" by adding 1/4C chopped cilantro to the dumpling batter for color and a little added flavor.  Also suggest using russet potatoes so they hold up better in the stew.

What a great dish for a cold or rainy day with plenty of leftovers for money saving lunches at work or a quick dinner.

O I love this recipe! I do my own spices depending on my mood usually the poultry seasoning then add pepper, basil, garlic powder (lots of garlic powder), and some other stuff... never ever use peas and I don't measure any of my spices. I like to add at least 2 packets of the chicken flavor boost if I don't have any stock on hand. Don't just use water it will not taste good in my opinion. And do halve the dumplings. Awesome though love all the veggies!

Very good! I used a store bought roasted chicken and added poultry seasoning to the dumpling batter, very good flavor. Next time I will cut the onions and potatoes smaller, quarters are too large for my liking.

We absolutely LOVED this. I added a can of Cream of Potato and a can of Chicken Broth. I omitted the Peas (YUCK), lol. I also added about 2 more cups of water with a chicken bullion cube, a tad bit of basil and I just used a can of Buttermilk biscuits instead of making my own dumplins'. I thought this was super yummie and all of the kiddos gobbled it right up. I will definitely be making this every few weeks during the Winter..YUM YUM!

Yummy! Subbed one can of creamy chicken soup with one can of chicken broth (and one cup less water) and I followed the dumpling directions on the bis quick box. I also used my own version of "poultry seasoning" as I didnt have any prepared.

I changed this up a bit.  It would be quite bland with just water so I used homemade stock, and added a chicken flavor boost for a more chickeny taste.  I don't usually cook with canned soup, so I only used one can although I think I might make homemade cream of chicken soup next time and add more, as It did make it creamier.  I made "Dumplings" from scratch from AR. We loved all the veggies in this, but I chopped them up in bite size so it would be easier to eat.  It was kinda like pot pie.  This is a great stater recipe, Thanks for posting.

Was good-I substituted chicken broth for the water (2 cups anyway) and left out the peas.  Lots of flavor and easy to make.

This is excellent!  Just make sure your chicken mixture is boiling before you drop biscuits...If not, you will just have a layer of biscuits on the top :)  whole family liked it, it's definately a keeper!

Awesome, my picky husband loved it.  I did take some suggestions from other reviewers.  I used 3 cups chicken broth (I was using chicken I had roasted previously), 1 tsp pepper and 1 tsp poultry seasoning.  I did eliminate the salt and potatoes.  I followed the rest of the recipe and loved it.  Next time I think I will try a previous review that used a 9x13 pan and cooking the dumplings on the top for 25min at 350 degrees.

I followed recommendations and used chicken stock instead of water.  I made the chicken stew per instructions and then transferred dish to 9x13 baking dish and put the dumplings on and cooked for 25 min at 350 degrees.

Next time I will replace the water with chicken broth for a bit more flavor and will try using biscuits.  And will definitely cut the recipe in half, it makes a lot!  Great comfort food and makes the house smell great!

This comes out really well, and is really easy to make. I did make a few changes, in part due to a lack of certain ingredients, and in part due to other reviewers. I used chicken broth instead of water, and used about a cup more than what the recipe called for. I also used a package of frozen mixed vegetables instead of the peas as I didn't have frozen peas, so I omitted the carrots. (My mixed vegetables consisted of peas, carrots, sweet red peppers, and corn.) And I cut up my potatoes a bit more than just quartering them and only used three.  Three potatoes were plenty, and cutting them up more meant they weren't absolutely huge chunks. I'd say make your own judgement call on how much to cut them up and how many based on the size of your potatoes.

Finally, I made my own dumplings (Mom's Simple Dumplings on this site) as I'm not huge into using baking mix. It turned out really well, and was a huge hit with my family. Why four stars? Well, I think homemade dumplings turned out better than baking mix ones would have, and I think the chicken broth really helped make it instead of just water. But I'd definitely recommend this recipe as it was really good and even with the changes I made it was still really easy to make.

I thought the stew portion was delicious, but I think I'll skip the dumplings next time, as I believe they caused the bottom of the stew to burn badly (I never knew soups could smoke). Biscuits on the side would work just as well.

This was just okay. I followed the recipe exactly except I cut down the dumpling recipe as suggested. We thought it was very bland. It does make a lot and is very filling. Next time I think I'll try a different version.

This was a wonderful easy filling recipe.  I used leftover turkey legs from Thanksgiving so I was able to save time on this recipe.  I did add paprika on top of the bisquik mix and browned the top in the broiler for the last few moments for a crispier crust.  I also halved the recipe and it made enough for a nice dinner for two with a green salad and left overs for both of us the next day.  It will stay in a regular rotation for using left over poultry for a quick meal.

the only change I made was to use chicken broth in place of 2 cups of water. My family loved it! I tried to double batch for freezing for days I have school the second time I made it and still every drop was eaten!6 members of our family eat meat...it is almost impossible to find something they all aggree on....includeing my picky 8 year old!

This dish is amazing and has become a regular in our winter meal lineup! I do add the carrots and potatoes earlier than recommended to ensure the entire dish doesn't overcook. Otherwise, I don't change a thing.

Excellent on a cold day. I cut up a whole chicken (approx 2.5 pounds) and simmered the pieces for about an hour before shredding. I also used 3 cups of chicken broth rather then water to up the chicken flavor, doubled the pepper and seasoning, and totally cut out the salt (the broth and seasoning had enough). I also used my own dumpling recipe rather then baking mix.

I liked the look of this recipe and thought for sure my kids wouldn't touch it.  I didn't care...made it anyway for me.  Well, turned out they loved it.  They didn't love the leftovers the next day, but I did!  I made it exactly minus the salt.

The flavor is very good. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because there is not nearly enough liquid for the amount of other ingredients the recipe calls for. We ended up eating very dry dumplings mixed with chicken slop. It tasted good, but definitely needs more liquid!! I will make this again, but next time I will add some chicken broth, and will also make a different kind of dumpling.

This is a very good recipe i had to make a few changes because i didn't have every thing on hand and had no time to go to the store, I used 8 chicken thighs and caned peas instead of frozen. I also used refrigerated biscuits. It turns out great and will for sure make this again it was very tasty!!

This is a hearty, tasty one dish meal.  I substituted low salt soup and low fat baking mix and  it turned out great.  Thanks to a previous reviewer, I did not use the whole dumpling mix in the pot (made drop biscuits with the rest).  My dumplings came out perfect because they weren't crowded in the pot.

The other half of my household will eat anything but seldom compliments new recipes - this one is a keeper. I didn't have cream of chicken soup on hand, but I did have a jar of fat-free Homestyle Gravy (turkey). It was very tasty and cut both the fat and the calories of this dish. Thank you!

I understand what other reviewers have mentioned about the lack of chicken flavour but I think this is a great stew none-the-less. Lots of good veggies and the dumplings are the best.. thank-you L.M. Thorne for the easy dumpling recipe. A nice gentle stew that you could flavour with extra spices as you like. Mmmm.

I'm not much of a cook, but this turned out really well! My only complaint was that it was a bit onion-y, and I only used one onion! I also really like onions, but even still they were too overpowering. The dumplings were a lot easier to make than I thought, just make sure that it is good and boiling. (if you're going to have leftovers, then take them out of the stew and store them dry in tupperware. Then just pull them out and heat them up in the oven so that they don't get too soggy) I also didn't understand the point to cook it over low heat so long. Unless you're putting a whole chicken in there and trying to boil some flavors off of the bones, there is no reason to cook it for so long. Next time I will cut the chicken up first as it was too hot to handle later. I will cut the cook time, and use less onion!

Really good and really easy!  I threw everything in my slow cooker before I left for work in the morning.  When I got home, all I had to do was shred the chicken and make the dumplings!!

I followed this recipe exactly other than cutting the dough down as recommended by others.  I actually followed the dumpling recipe on the side of the Bisquick box which called for 2 1/4 C biscuit mix and 2/3 cup milk.  I don't know what happened, but everything stuck to the bottom of my All-Clad dutch oven horribly.  I had a thick crust of burned on soup on the bottom.  Ugh.  The soup was also rather bland.  This seemed to have happened after the dumpling dough was added.  You can't stir after adding these dumplings or the dough will come apart.  And yes, I did add the dumplings only after I brought the soup to a boil.  Sorry, I won't make this again.

Tasty dish--a bit time consuming--had my husband cutting vegetables which helped.  I would add less pepper next time--it was bit too hot with 1/2 tsp.    I spooned off some of the broth before I put the dumplings on top so they were on the vegetables and not in the broth--didn't have baking mix so I made a recipe for dumplings from the BC cookbook.

This is an excellent recipe, easy to make and full of flavor. I did make my own dumplings using Martystar's review and they were top notch! If you want a great chicken and dumpling recipe you will now be disappointed!

This was a very tasty and filling recipe.  As several reviewers suggested, I used a can of chicken broth for 2 of the 3 cups of the water.  I also used 1/2 breasts and 1/2 thighs because it's what I had.  I cut the potatoes into chunks because quarters were just too big and I used my own biscuit recipe for the dumplings.  Cutting up all the ingredients and shredding the chicken was fairly time consuming but it was worth it.

I found the recipe to be too thin for true Irish Chicken and Dumplings.  I had to add mashed potatoes to help thicken up the broth.   I also thought it was lacking in flavour and ended up adding bouillon cubes and onion powder.  The amount of dumpling mixture was too much and so I halved the amount and it came out just right.

Biggest complaint I saw was it takes so long to make. Here's how I shortened it up and it was fabulous! 2 cans of chic breast 2 cans cream of chic soup + 1 can cream celery soup 2 cans of sliced potatoes 3 cups frozen veggies Onion flakes in place of onion chunks.  I simmered meat, soup, and onion for 15 min, then I put in frozen veggies for 20 min, added biscuits and it was done. Didn't like it with store bought biscuits, for this Bisquick is much better! My mom totally cheats at it though. She uses canned chunky chicken noodle soup and adds 1 can of cream soup and biscuits. It doesn't taste the same as this recipe.

It didn't have the chicken taste going on, so I added more poultry seasoning and thyme.  My homemade version is better.

This recipe was excellent. Our power went out so I had to modify to shorten the time frame. I microwaved the potatoes whole until soft and then quartered. I sauted the celery, onions, carrots, and chicken in a pan till tender. I seperatly heated the soup and water. I combine the ingredients, adding everything else the recipe called for. Total cooking time was closer to 45 mins. This recipe will go into our favorites.

Very, very good.  Instead of using water, I used chicken broth since other reviews had said it didn't have much chicken flavor.  I really think this would be good served over hot, halved biscuits instead of the dumplings.

Needs lots of tweaking but still worth making.  Needed way more liquid than the 3 cups of water so kept adding chicken broth throughout the cooking.  Used low sodium chicken soup and only half a teaspoon of salt - still plenty of flavor.  Bisquick made waaay too many dumplings.  Put the vegies in at different times than called for.  Used a sweet potato and cut into large cubes.  Didn't shred the chicken, was fine.  Also, cooked for less amount of time but used higher heat.  Added thyme.

Tried this for St Patrick's day. It was delicious. Just note that the recipe calls for a large, heavy pot. Make sure it has a wide opening. My dumplings overflowed the gravy. Other than that - it was yummy!

This was great. I did need to make changes, but not in the ingredients as I had leftover cooked chicken breast to use. I combined all the ingredients except the peas, chicken, milk, and dumplings, and cooked until the potatoes and carrots were almost done, then added the peas and chicken (in chunks..sorry), brought it to a boil, then added the dumplings. I will make this again. My husband loves those baking mix dumplings! Oh, I forgot the milk. I was just reading the directions and never saw when it was added..when it looked a little thick, I just added some water..guess that's where I needed the milk!

Extremely tasty dish that pleased the whole crew on St. Patrick's day.     I substituted 1 cup of chicken stock for one of the 3 cups water called for, and also added garlic and thyme as suggested by another reviewer. It came out great - I wouldn't change a thing next time.

My husband doesn't like corned beef and cabbage, so I had to find another recipe for St. Patrick's Day.  This is by far the best recipe I have found for chicken and dumplings!  Will surely make again!

Made this for St. Patrick's day and it was FANTASTIC!  The aroma in the house was wonderful!  I had to hurry the cooking along b/c I started cooking too late, so I just cubed the chicken before I put it in.  The chicken was so tender and flavorful!  I also used red potatoes as they tend to cook more quickly.  I probably needed to make my dumplings a little smaller, but that sure didn't take away from the flavor!  The only disappointing thing was that the weather was sunny and warm the day I made it :)  It will be even better when it is cold and rainy...THE PERFECT comfort food...oh, and did I say it had great flavor!

This was basically a chicken pot pie with the biscuit mixed in.  None-the-less, is was indeed tasty.  It made much more than I expected though, i had to start removing some of the "chicken" part to make room for the dumplings, and even then couldn't fit it all.  It fed my family of 3 for more than 2 meals.

Very good!  This was a hit with the family...followed others advice and added an extra can of soup, some bouillon, and a bit more poultry seasoning for some extra flavor.  Have "orders" from my son, who I didn't think would touch this with a ten foot pole, to make again very soon...especially the dumplings...

This was pretty good, but a little bland in taste.  I would suggest adding more spices to kick up the flavor.

I've never written a review before and I have found many recipes on this site worthy of glowing comments, but this recipe gets great reviews from me, for how simple and tasty it is!  Even my children loved it! Thanks so much for sharing.  The only stray from the recipe was taking another's advice and cubing the chicken before putting it in the pot.  Yum!

Apparently, I do not like poultry seasoning.  Didn't even finish the recipe.  If you do not like poultry seasoning, leave this out of the recipe.  I may try it again, just omitting that seasoning.

Excellent! In a house full of picky eaters, this was a treasure. Picky eater #1 doesn't like meat. I added more 2 large cans of chicken bouillon and one more cream of chicken soup can. Picky eater #2 doesn't like potatoes, but everyone else does. So, cooked potatoes on the side and mashed them. Did not add potatoes into the brother. Picky eater #2 also LOVES rice, so cooked rice separately and served this as a gravy.  All picky eaters are iffy on dumplings so left those out entirely. So we got three meals out of this -- one for a semi-vegetarian, one for someone who like spotatoes, one for someone who lives rice! This recipe rocks!

After all the rave reviews, I was really disappointed with this recipe. There just wasn't anything special about it. The flavour was good, the veggies were good, but there just seemed to be something missing. This isn't a keeper for me unfortunately.
UPDATE: Today I added a little garlic and thyme to the leftovers and it was sooo much better!

This is now one of my favorite cold-weather comfort meals!  I used one can of cream of onion and one can of cream of chicken soup.  I used the Dumplings by Carol recipe on this site as well.  Deliscious and one of those rare meals that EVERYONE in the family loved.  Thanks, Clairellen!

Smells wonderful!  After reading other reviews I used chicken boulion paste to make stock rather than using water.  Also, I added a touch of crushed red pepper, basil, and almost a full teaspoon of poultry seasoning.  In addition to the listed veggies I added fresh mushrooms and omitted the potatoes.  The whole house smelled amazing.  This definitely makes more than 6 servings - lots of leftovers!

The carrots and potatoes definitely need more than 30 minutes to cook.  I cooked on low for about 45 minutes.  Also recommend to cut everything into bite size.  I added a can of chicken broth as others suggested.  This came out great!

the timing is alittle off. i suggest playing it by ear. and once the chicken cutlets were cooked i put them on the side with some of the sauce and didnt put it back in the pot until i added the peas. also i used 1/2 box of frozen peas and 1/2 a box of frozen corn. over all a big hit in our house.

Amazing recipe.  My family loves it.  I only made two small changes from the recipe posted: 1) I cooked in the crockpot so it would be mostly ready when we came home from church 2) added about 1/4 tsp more chicken seasoning.  I barely fit all the dough for the dumplings, so next time I will reduce that some.  Wonderful, wonderful food!

VERY TIME CONSUMING, HOWEVER I FOUND THAT INSTEAD OF MAKING YOUR OWN DUMPLINGS I JUST DROP IN BISCUITS THAT YOU CAN BUY FROM THE STORE. ALSO YOU CAN HEAT EVERYTHING ON HIGH AND CUT YOU COOKING TIME IN HALF!  MY FAMILY LOVES THIS DISH

I love this recipe and have made it several times.  The last time I made it I cut the vegetables in uniform size because I wanted to make chicken pot pie out of the leftovers (minus dumplings, of course).  I reheated chicken mixture in the microwave until just warm and used packaged pie dough for the bottom and top crust.  I baked the pie in the oven until golden brown. Voila!!!Fabulous!!!  My family loved both meals...cooked once and served twice.  They didn't even realize it was leftovers.

This is an awesome recipe.  My 12 year old daughter made it tonight, and it is fantastic.  We made our own baking mix, which we think adds alot of flavor.  We also had fresh celery out of the garden.  This will become a family favorite for sure.

This was the best chicken and dumplings ever! Just don't let your 'glass' pot get burnt on the bottom cuz it'll ruin the whole batch!

This recipe is wonderful.  Very simple and easy to make with FANTASTIC results.  I had a ton of people to feed so I doubled the recipe.  I did add a few less veggies than are suggested and more chicken.  It was a hit.

This recipe was awesome! My husband told me not to lose it :) I did cut the cooking time down by adding in my potatoes 1 hour after I started cooking the chicken but I also made them smaller than quartered. Also, instead of adding just carrots I put in a bag of mixed veggies. The chicken was so tender I didn't even have to shred it. It was already falling apart. I have a feeling we will be making this one again soon! Thanks for the beyond awesome recipe!

this is great comfort food! i used chicken thighs instead of breasts, cooked them until they were falling off the bone (about any hour), used chicken broth instead of water, omitted the salt (the broth has enough salt in it), used less carrots, potatoes, and peas than called for, omitted the celery, cut the onions and carrots into bite sized pieces. used my own recipe for the dumplings. next time, i will add some broth to make it a little more soupy, and i will play around with the spices.

I really liked this! Although it came out a bit thick, but that is an easy fix. It can be altered to add more of what you like (i.e. celery) or omit things yo do not (i.e. peas!)Good recipe, I liked!

This is, hands down, my favorite chicken and dumpling recipe. Ever. I do agree with those who say the dumpling recipe can be cut in half. (I used the remaining half of my batter for pancakes the next morning) I also omitted the potatoes, mainly because I didn't have any at the time but I think the dumplings provide the perfect amount of "starch" for the dish without the added potato. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T and it was fabulous. We are making it again tonight and I don't expect to have any leftovers!

Very good meal subsituted corn instead of peas.  Not a big fan of peas.  Still was extremely good.  Very easy clean up.  Listened to the rest of the reviews and cut the dumplings in half.

Nice recipe, although it comes out very thick. Next time I make this I may add in a little more broth to thin it out. I used frozen dumplings instead of making fresh.

VERY good!  Leftovers were just as good if not better!  I might try in the slow cooker next time.  I did have to boil the potatoes and carrots to get them cooked which I think took away some flavor from the dish.  I added 3 cans of cream of chicken and used some chicken broth seasoning to boost the flav.

Great recipe, I used the herb dumplings from this site to replace the dumplings this called for, however based on the ingrediants for the dumplings here, as others said its just too much.

This is exactly how my Irish grandma used to make chicken and dumplings... I do like them with the refrigerator biscuit dough as well, but that makes a more noodle-ish dumpling... also very good, but I prefer the more biscuit type dumplings like grandma made :)

I may have done something wrong here.  I'm a pretty good cook, but somehow this just didn't turn out right.  I think I just expected something else though.  Without the expectations, I think I would have thought more of this one though.  Makes for a decent make ahead meal for the busy family though.

First attempt ever trying Chicken & Dumplings. I was pleased with the outcome. I used canned refrigerator biscuit dough as someone else suggested. That worked great. Will make again without adding any additional salt. I thought the final dish was a bit too salty.

Very good taste but I agree with other reviewers.  If you follow the directions exactly it is way too thick & way too much dumpling mix.  I will make again with some changes as the overall result is well worth it!

I followed as written and took the tip to par-boil the potatoes before adding to cut down on cooking time while in the stew.I cooked this while coming in and out while pulling my garden apart and what a treat at the end of a long day!!! It got raves from my family and I will certainly make again- it's well worth the longish cooking time.

This was a big hit. I think almost any cream style soup will work as I used cream of mushroom. To cut down on the cooking time, I parboiled the potatoes for about 10 minutes and added them after the first hour and 15 minutes along with the carrots.  I also followed the dumpling recipe on my baking mix box, but still cut it in half. Will make again for sure.

After four hours on the stove, I swore I would never make this again.  Then my family tasted it.  My 5 year old said it was the best thing he'd ever tasted.  My mom (who loves chicken & dumplings) said it was the best she'd had, and my husband said "It's a keeper!"  So I guess I just have to figure out how to reduce the time it takes to prepare.  Next time I'm going to use frozen peas and carrots.  My only change this time was to reduce the dumpling recipe by half, which made 6 large dumplings that filled the pot perfectly.  I also added a little garlic powder to the dumplings.  I think I will add some Italian seasoning to the stew next time, along with extra broth.  Oh, I did add 3 tablespoons of chicken bouillon to the 3 cups of water that I simmered the chicken, etc, in.

Well, I think I undercooked the dumplings because they were doughy.  Overall the family gave this one the thumbs down.  M.Keddie, Cambridge, Ontario

Very tasty recipe.  The dumplings seemed to be overwhelming the pot, so I made drop biscuits out of half of the dough.  My picker eaters wouldn't touch this with peas, so I left them out.  I will definitely make this again on a cold rainy day!!

I made this recipes AS IS without alterations. I found felt the soup was bland and not worth the time it took to make it. IF I make it again, I'll season the dumpings, add more salt and seasonings to the base.

This is a fantastic recipe! My husband is a huge fan of chicken & dumpling was a bit of a skeptic when he saw the potatoes & peas going into the pot. Boy was he surprised when he tasted this dish; as was I. This is going to be part of my winter recipes for sure!

This turned out delicious! I used bone-in breasts (to add some more flavor) and had to add some chicken broth as it was a little too thick when going to drop the dumplings in. I had doubts about "baking mix" for dumplings, but they actually weren't bad due to soaking up the flavorful broth. This is a keeper!

Delicious! My first time making chicken & dumplings. I omitted the potatoes (didn't have any), used herbs de provence instead of poultry seasoning, and used thigh meat instead of breasts. The end product was absolutely perfect. Silky/velvety soup, carrots cooked perfectly, dumplings light and airy, and most importantly moist chicken. Husband said it was the best chicken and dumplings he has ever had. Definitely will make again.

This was a very solid recipe. We thought it was very good, and since we like dumplings we enjoyed how many there were. It does make a lot of everything so you can have leftovers.

I made a few changes to this recipe so that it is hard to rate.  The result was absolutely delicious.  I started out with a 4 pound cut up chicken.  I covered it with about 3 cups homemade chicken broth and water.  I also added about 1/2 tsp ground allspice.  I used a 2 cups Bisquick with 1/2 cup milk. Otherwise, I followed the rest of the recipe; however, like another reviewer, I cut up the potatoes into small cubes.

I was expecting more from this recipe based on all the reviews.  My husband and I both thought this tasted like the Chicken Pot Pie IX recipe on this website but without the crust (dumpling topping instead) and not as good.  There was a lot of dumpling mixture and it just all cooked together on top.  I don't think we'll be making this again.  If you do like this recipe though, you will love the pot pie recipe.

Really good!  Didn't make the dumplings but served over Grands biscuits.  I left out the potatoes, added onion powder, chicken boullion, rosemary, sage and parsley.  It was definitely not bland.  Will make again!  Thanks for sharing!

I ended up making this in the crock pot last weekend.  I cooked it on high for 6 hours.  Then, I dropped the dumplings on top and baked it in the oven for about 10 minutes.  I thought it was delicious the night I made it, but didn't really care for the leftovers.

Made this for St. Patrick's Day meal. Very well received. Added parsley and poultry spice to the dumplings mixture. next time might only make 3/4 of the dumpling mixture - soaked up all of the liquid and wasn't enough to cook the top all that well. Saw suggestions to use chicken broth substitution - will try that next time. Served with soda bread, steamed cabbage and colcannon; finished with Irish cream bundt cake muffins! Yum!

This took some time, but it sure was worth it. The flavors were great making it a great comfort food. Perfect for cold days and would be great to make for someone who is sick. Makes the house smells wonderful too! I followed the directions exactly. Only change I would make it to not make so many dumplings. Maybe cut it down to 2 cups!

Excellent!  A meal in itself.  Made just as recipe stated and I found it could use a bit more liquid toward the end.  But my husband enjoyed it very much and we'll definitely be making it again.

I make a recipe that is very simalar only i use a lot of water. i take the water add boneless chicken and simmer for two hours. then i shred it and add the peas, carrots, onions and seasonings and cook for a while. after that i add two cans of chicken broth and two cans of cream of chicken. i let that simmer for an hour then make homeade dumplings and simmer for 15-20 minutes. mine is simalar, but yours is very good too. oh and i also add a stick of butter.

It was very tasty....it just seemed like it was missing something for some reason.  I think I'll try to spice it up next time.  The dumplings however where fluffy and warm....perfect to come in from the cold to.

Makes a great dish, but I will be adding more spices to taste in the future.  I used the dumpling recipe given by the highest rated review and thought that it went well with the stew.

I used the tip to cut up checken breasts before cooking- very good ides. I hesitated between 3 and 4 stars. I felt it was rather bland, but my husband really liked it. Our teen said it tasted like chicken pie filling-he thought it was ok. I used 99% fat free cream of chicken soup- maybe it would be better with regular? It was easy to make. Not sure if I would make again;maybe it's just personal taste. I looked in the James Beard cookbook and he said Chicken and Dumplings should be eaten once or teice per year, no more!

I used low sodium cream soups, so it was a little less salty than I would have liked...but I believe that was my doing. DELISH.

This recipe was great!  We skipped the peas and instead of 3 cups of water..we used 2 cups of water and 1 cup of chicken broth.  I made so much and had a lot of leftovers so we had seconds the next day and it still was yummy.

I'm giving this five stars with the caveat that I meddled with the recipe.  Like others, I used chicken broth instead of water and bumped it to four cups.  I also used the cream of chdicken with herbs soup to include a little more flavor and with chicken thighs instead of breasts, because they're better suited for soups and stews.  The chicken thighs did take about 45 minutes longer to cook than the recipe called for.  I also made the dumplings from scratch and included Italian seasoning in with the flour.  I also added a couple teaspoons of corn starch when I added the peas.  I was grateful for the extra broth because most of the liquid boiled away by the time it was done.  It was extremely yummy!

Adequate, however, for my family it was too bland and flavorless.  I can't figure out how to improve it, so will probably never make it again.  This is the first recipe on AllRecipes that I have been disappointed with.

Wonderful recipe! The only thing I did differently was leave out the peas (don't like them) and made my dumplings from scratch instead of using baking mix. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the best recipe.  We have an annual "International Food Day" where I work, and after I brought it the very first year, it became a yearly request to be made.  I would triple the recipe and cook it up on ia big plug in roaster so as to give all 150 employees in our group a decent serving.  Always lots of requests for the recipe!

Very good recipe. I used a combination of herbs and used my own biscuit recipe with additional milk to make the dumplings. It was a bit bland so next time I will use some of the suggetions in other reviews such as using canned soup to replace water.

This recipe is good, but really not a favorite of my family. The broth has a good flavor and the chicken turned out really tender, but I didn't like how chunky everything was (and I thought I cut things up smaller than suggested).

This was very tasty, my hubby said the taste was very good. On the 
other hand it was a mess, the dumplings were overwhelming and turned out to be a monster they took over the  dish and made it a thick gloopy mess. The gravy vanished after the dumplings were added and cooked. I used a biscuit mix like the recipe called for and they disintegrated. So in hindsight next time I will make it with more water/stock and make homemade dumplings. I did add a lot more spices, such as fresh thyme, garlic, Italian seasoning etc. and used Campbells lowfat cream soups. The taste is undeniably good.

Yummmm!!! I don't like bland food or soup that isn't soupy, so I changed the recipe a bit. I added a can of cream of celery soup, an extra can of cream of chicken, and substituted chicken broth for water. To cut down on fat and sodium, I used reduced fat and sodium soup. For more flavor, add garlic, fresh basil, fresh rosemary, fresh thyme, and a little lemon pepper.

Very Very delicious! But...very very thick. i'm not used to chicken and dumplings being so thick. It tasted almost to the tee like a chicken pot pie all mashed up, pie crust and all. I almost wondered why i spent so much time on something that tasted just like something that's frozen and stuck in the oven.   But again, very delicious :)

Easy and Delish!!  This is the perfect cold weather comfort food.  The only change I made was to use chicken quarters, because it is what I had on hand.  I have 2 picky daughters who LOVED this recipe.  I made the dumplings according to the recipe and they were perfect.  I think the secret to keeping them from being too doughy is heating the stew to a rolling boil before adding the dumpling dough.  Definately will make this one again.

With 336 excellent ratings, I probably don't need to add another but I will...This is a great recipe!  I never would have thought to add cream of chicken soup to my chicken and dumplings but I will from now on.  This was so tasty.  I didn't add the carrots and peas b/c I didn't want my kids to turn up their noses before even taking a bite.  I'm happy to say that they loved this dish.  I wan't sure b/c I served it in bowls and their first thoughts were "I don't like it" because they're not used to soup looking dishes.  After the first bite though, they changed their minds!  I will be making this again and again.

This recipe is great.  I used only two boneless, skinless breasts and I had only one can of soup on hand.  Also my family likes noodles so I substituted those for the potatoes.  It was delicious.... too bad this particular dish (regardless of recipe) doesn't keep well.. better if you can eat fresh and hot... my husband gets home from work late and the noodles always suck up a lot of the juice.. might not do it so badly with potatoes. I will definitely make this again.

This was great.  I've been looking for an easy and good chicken and dumplings recipe for so long and I think I found it.  The only changes I made were adding 1 tsp. of bouillon granules to the water, using 1 onion and cutting the potates into 1" chunks.  I may try with different dumplings next time but this was great as written...

Great recipe - the reason for the 4 stars is that I altered it slightly per the suggestions of some other "raters." I used three cans of soup and chicken broth instead of the water. Also added a splash of white wine and some garlic. As for the dumplings, I used a different recipe from scratch. It turned out beautifully and perfect for a cool fall supper. Husband said it was the best dish I've made so far!

I made this for friends who are not the easiest to cook for and they loved it. The only change I made was I used 3 cans of soup instead of just 2. I wanted to make sure there was enough liquid so  I also used 2 fat free crm of chicken and 1 crm of celery. I only used 1 onion because I'm not a huge onion fan. I also added parsley and chopped chives. Everyone loved the idea of the potatoes. I used Mary B's dumplings and added them the last 4o min. What a easy meal. Will use this again.

This was really pretty good however we did find it not "soupy" enough to suit us.  Perhaps I added too many vegetables or something.  Also my dumplings weren't quite done but I'm sure that was my fault.  Must not have had the stew boiling hard enough!  All in all it had pretty good flavor.  Will probably make again.

Yummy! The only changes I made were to cut down on the cooking time so I used fresh chicken tenders cut into bite size pieces and cooked separately in a frying pan. I also used one can of peas and carrots instead of fresh carrots and frozen peas, and boiled the onions and celery in the 3 cups of water. I also omitted the  potatoes as I felt the biscuits were enough starch. The flavor was fantastic and my family loved it. Making it this way reduced the cooking time down to half.

The ultimate comfort food! I used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of celery. I added a teaspoon of chicken boullion and a heafty sprinkling of garlic powder. I only used 1 cup bisquick and a third a cup milk to make 9 dumplings, which turned out wonderfully! I sprinkled the dumplings with a bit of paprika, too. I do wish I had a few more... Next time I will add a bit of cornstarch to thicken the broth up, but this was wonderful!

It was good but I can never seem to get the dumplings to cook all the way threw. I usually end up with about have dough- like. Will keep trying though.

This meal spends a lot of time on the stove and needs either constant attention or more liquid to prevent burning to the pan. I've also tried this recipe in a crock pot and it turned out great--just finish off on the stove or by baking in the oven once you add the dumplings.

Love this!  It takes a long time but is worth the effort.  Very yummy and I was surprised at how tender the chicken breast is by cooking it with this method. I made the buttermilk dumplings suggested in comments.  My husband and children raved about this meal.  Thank you so much.

I added about 2 cups more water and used boullion cubes instead of salt.  To thicken the increased broth, I added 1 can of the soup in the beginning and added 1/4 cup flour to the 2nd can and added that at the end.  After it thickened, I topped the pot with prepared Hungary Jack biscuits and then cooked them the same as the recipe states for the homemade dumplings.  My kids enjoyed this!!

A HUGE hit with the whole family.  Even my 6-year old "picky eater" liked it.  I think next time I make itm I'll add a little more liquid and a little less dumplings.

My family greatly enjoyed this recipe, but with a few modifications, I used broth instead of water and added an extra cup. I made my grandmother's egg dumplings because we prefer them to the biscuit topping (we generally serve the chicken and dumplings over biscuits). It was pretty good, but even when only adding 3 chicken breasts I felt it was a bit heavy on the chicken. I can't say I would see why this is a 5-star recipe, however, as isn't necessarily a stand out flavor, and I have had better.

Personally, probably one of the best recipes I've pulled off of this site! It was EXACTLY as I'd hoped it would be. Proudly served it for St.Paddy's Day and impressed everyone. Was a little worried about one comment about the dumplings having to be stirred continuously or they'd fall. I made sure the liquid was boiling when I added the dough - worked fine.The dough cooked on the surface No stirring needed. There was alot of Dumpling and that was just fine.. 
Will absolutely, definitely do this one again - BEFORE next St-Patricks day.

This was just like my Aunt Natalie makes!  I reduced the amount of peas just a little and used pre-cut carrot chips.  I also used two thighs in place of two of the breasts.  This turned out great and everyone loved it.  Aunt Natalie uses a whole fryer chicken cut up and skinned.  Definitely a comfort winter food!

I had never eaten or made Chicken and Dumplings before.  That being said my family thought this was great.  I followed the other reviews and halved the dumpling recipe and had just enough to fill the top.  I did add some lemon pepper to the stew part to add a fresh flavor.  But overall a great tasting comforting meal.  My hubby said he thought it would make a great potpie too.  How did that turn out Mandy?  Thanks Claire for the great recipe!

To save time, I sauteed the veggies in olive oil until they softened up.  I used chicken stock and simmered them in the pan for a while, too.  Then combined with other ingredients.  It shortened the cooking time to about an hour.

I think this was excellent tasting before the dumplings.  That was just too much.  And I pitched the leftovers since it was just a huge blob after sitting on the stove while we ate.  I'd give a solid 4 stars before the dumplings.

I would have to say this is pretty good, although the potatoes, we thought, were way to much. Next time I wont add the potatoes as the biscuits were just enough. Also, I did not add any salt, as the salt content in the soup is high enough. We all enjoyed and will make again!

This is yummy!  Took advice of other reviewers and used canned biscuits that I cut into bite sized pieces and dropped into the soup mixture in place of baking mix.  Next time I will use a bit less onion but that is just my personal preference.  This is even better the next day.  Thanks!!

My brother is an exhausting and picky bottomless pit, and it filled him to the brim with one serving AND he was in love with it.  My husband had it for breakfast the next day!  As far as it being called "bland," it just leaves enough room for everyone to personalize it to their specific tastes.  I like that in a recipe.  We added thyme and celery salt, and 2 chicken bouillon cubes at the start.  It will be a regular at our table.  Thanks for the recipe :)

This is wonderful. I have never liked chicken and dumplings but I do now! Matter of fact everyone on the block loved it. It was easy to make and the house smelled wonderful all day.

I was dissapointed it came out so similar to a chicken potpie without the crust. I have a great chicken potpie recipe that is half the work, tastes just as good, and I prefer a crust to dumplings. Will not make again.

THIS PASSED MY EXCELLENCE TEST.  GOOD BASE FOR SOUP AND POT PIE, TOO.  I DIDN'T HAVE SOUP ON HAND.  SUBSTITUTED TWO PKGS OF CHICKEN GRAVY MIX, PLUS 4 CUPS WATER, AND OMITTED THE SALT.  THIS IS GOING IN MY "KEEPER" FILE.

Good comfort food.  Hubby and I agree it's missing something, but maybe just because it's not "fancy."  Will keep in my recipe box for sharing with sick friends!

It was good.  My chickenndumplin hating husband enjoyed it.  We both agreed it was too bland/boring for our tastes so i wouldn't make it again without modifying it.

This was very easy and VERY delicious! I followed the recipe exacty and I only ran into 1 problem: the pot I used (5 qt.) was *just* big enough for the soup to not spill over. So next time I will use a bigger pot. This also caused there to be too much dumpling mix, and they wouldn't cook right so I had to remove some after 25 minutes or so of cooking them. I will definately be making this again, I might try using broth instead of water just for a little something extra. Thanks for the 5 star recipe! :]

My husband and I really liked this, but I wasn't crazy about the taste of the dumplings.  Might try making homemade next time instead of the Bisquick.

I think I would give this 4-1/2 stars. I was really hoping the broth would be a little more flavorful and a little thicker. I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of chicken broth in addition to 1 cup of water. Maybe next time I would use a can of cream of celery as well. But, all in all, this was WONDERFUL. My husband helped himself to 2 big bowls and raved about it. And don't listen to the cold weather comfort food thing; I made this in Las Vegas July weather!

I love this, eating it for leftovers right now!  I used reduced fat bisquick for the dumplings and turned out great.  Next time to add some more flavor I will add chicken broth and milk.  But this was absolutely delicious!!

My family and I loved this dish.  It brought me back to when I was little and my grandmother used to make it.  I did add an extra can of broth and 2c milk.  I used a whole chicken except for the wings.  This is a very filling meal, perfect for a cold winter evening.

First time to make chicken and dumplings and they were great. I did make a few changes as well. I used two cups chicken broth, one cup water, one can cream of chicken and one can cream of celery. I cook the chicken breast in all this all day in the slow cooker, then add the onion, celery, carrots, potatoes and peas and cook for about an hour. I only used two potatoes. Its wonderful!!!

I am sure that I am just repeating what everyone else has said, but this is amazing! It's a perfect meal for a cold night and everyone that I've made it for has raved. I always make extra biscuits when I heat up the leftovers.

Delicious with the cream of chicken soup for a base.  Changed things up a bit..used boneless/skinless chicken breasts and thighs and left the pieces larger.  I added salted herbs and spices, fresh veggies as well as added my own homemade dumpling recipe.  A real scrumptious Winter dish...thanks...

This was wonderful!  I used the "Easy Biscuit Mixture" recipe on this website to make the dumplings.  I didn't have chicken breast halves, so I just used a package of chicken legs and thighs and removed the bones during the cooking process.  This is one of my favorite chicken recipes now.  Thanks for sharing it.

This is the best. My daughter was asking for chicken and dumplings ever since she had them on vacatoin. I tried this once and it was great and it's added to our whats for dinner favorites. 
The only thing that I did change is I use all chicken broth instead of water and it turns out great every time. I also chunk up the potaotes smaller but I have young children.

Thanks for posting this. I appriciate that you shared.:)

I loved this recipe. Next time, however, I will add some chicken broth as it got too thick. The next day for leftovers, it was more like a casserole!! But it still tasted great!!

It was great.  I will use chicken stock instead of water and add more seasonings next time.  I used dark meat because we prefer it.  This was good at altitude and there was no time differance

i wanted to make something that made us all feel warm & fuzzy on new year's eve (it was our first rain here in san diego!) so this was it...i made the mistake of using a can of cream of mushroom along with the cream of chicken, it tasted totally off so i added 3 chicken bouillon cubes and it turned out perfect...the only other changes i made were adding some garlic salt, some butter to make the sauce a little more luxurious, a little lawry's seasoned salt and used a can of chicken broth in place of one of the cups of water.  i used bisquick for the dumplings (the stew was so tasty the plain dumplings were perfect as they didn't compete with it and instead soaked it up as they were cooking).  we all loved this and i will definitely make again, adding some mushrooms and leaving out the peas as my kids just picked them all out anyway.  definitely 5 stars!!!!!

My family loved it. It's a little time-consuming, but worth it. As others had, I went with reduced fat soup and bisquit mix.

This was terrific - the kids are begging to take leftovers to school for lunch tomorrow!  I made just a few changes:  added more liquid, as it got pretty thick (used chicken broth), used 1 can each cream of chicken and celery as suggested by someone else, also reduced the amount of dumplings by thirds and still had plenty.  Overall a terrific dish, great flavors, and will become a staple here on cold nights!  Thanks Claire!

Excellent! I made this for some friends who had just moved into a new home and hadn't unpacked anything yet. We brought it over piping hot off the stove. They loved it. My husband and I tasted it before we brought it to them, and now he wants it for dinner tomorrow night! (Have to get my big pot back from our friends first!) Thanks for a permanent addition to my recipe collection!

Great recipe!! A real comfort food for a chilly night or even a pot-luck. Even my 7 month old loved it ! I used 1 can of  fat free soup, so it was a bit thin, so I just thickened it with some cornstarch.A good change of pace from pot-pie.I would make the dumplings smaller next time(bite-size),Also I had no poultry seasoning so I used a bit of parsley, sage and a bayleaf.

My husband and I both loved this.  He said it was the best chicken & dumplings he's had, which is definetely a compliment since his mom is quite a cook.  I took other suggestions and didn't use potatoes at all.  Didn't have a problem with thickness, maybe because of lack of potatoes.  Delish!

Pretty tasty and creamy. I forgot to purchase potatoes but I added mushrooms.  The dumpling batter was a bit hard to handle. I would use non biscuit mix next time, the dumplings were not cooked all the way through and was very dense.

My family loved this!  My son even ate the veggies which he usually picks around.  I only used three chicken breasts instead of four.  The only thing I would do different next time is cut the potatoes into bite-size pieces instead of quartering them.  Delicious!  Put me in the mood for Fall.

I didn't care for the seasonings but overall it wasn't bad.  Perhaps, I overcooked it a bit however I think I'll stick to the good ol' Bisquick recipe for chicken and dumplings

Not really whatt i expected... but still good.  I felt that it wasn't as soupy as i would have liked and it reminded me of chicken and biscuits.  I cut down the recipie to 2 carrots, 1/2 a bag of peas, 2 potatoes, 3 chicken breasts and 1 onion and i felt that it was still really thick,,, however it was really good and filling. comfort food.  So it still gets 4 stars

very good, I made this for St Patty's instead of the traditional corned beef and cabbage for my very picky sister and her equally as picky roommate, they both loved it, so did my teenage daughter, who mind you ate leftovers and finished off all of the biquits.  I did however, use refridgerated  grande biquits cut into 1/4's and rolled into balls, then dropped into the pot to cook.  Next time I 'll be adding all the dough.  I'd rather have too many dumplings than not enough!

This was delicious!  The only change I made was to use Reduced Fat Bisquick, following the directions on the box.  That made 9 huge dumplings,which was plenty for us.  This is like an inside-out potpie.  Great comfort food!

Not quite sure what makes this 'Irish'.... But it was very good none-the-less! I cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces, and also diced 2 medium potatoes so they would cook quicker. I didn't have any poultry seasoning so I added lots of freshly ground black pepper and some Cavender's Greek Seasoning. I followed others' advice and halved the dumpling recipe on the Bisquick box. It was my first time making dumplings this way, and I thought they were a little bit strange... Anyway, great recipe. Thanks, Claire!

i didn't find this recipe to be all that good. it was a bit bland and seemed to be missing something. also was way too runny and i had to add water/flour to thicken. not my favorite dish.

this was amazing. I used 1 can low sodium cream of mushroom, 1 of cream of celery. Used boneless/skinless chicken thighs. Instead of carrots and celery I added - mushrooms, green beans and corn. Is a delicious meal, and husband loved it. Made homemade dumplings with it. Will definitely make again.

we LOVED this recipe!  i made a couple of changes- i substituted broth for the water and canned biscuits for the mix for convenience and it turned out great.  my only complaint is that it was a little too salty, but that was my fault- i should've realized that the broth would do that.  if you use broth, don't add more salt until the end if you need it.  i also used broccoli instead of peas, because my husband likes it better.   we ate it two nights in a row (made new dumplings the second night). i really expected this recipe to be harder than it was. i'm going to my parent's house next weekend and plan to make this for them!

This was good....just a bit on the bland side.  I added some fresh garlic, salt and pepper to give it a little more "umph"!! I thought it made way more than 6 serivngs, the first time I made it we had leftovers forever!!!  I made it for guests and they really enjoyed it.  It's a very good "rainy day" meal. I'll make it again for sure!!

I too accidentally skipped the milk, but these were still sooooo good and I had plenty of broth for the dumplings.  I used a different dumpling recipe though, so I can't say how good the ones listed here are... as for the soup DELICIOUS!  Definately will be doing this one again!

Recipe seemed to make alot more than four-six servings, made enough for dinner for four and a lunch for the next few days. I didn't cook the recipe as long as it called for at least by 20 mins. Was a good comfort meal. Next time I'll make it on a cold fall day and add a salad.

Just wonderfull! My family isn't exactly keen on dumplings but they devoured this dish. Only thing is I waited a little longer before adding the peas. Definitly a worth while try.

I just wish that I had added more chicken.  The flavor was wonderful.  I used chicken broth instead of water so that it was more "chickeny".  I made the dumplings from the back of the baking box.  It came out perfect!

Wonderful & easy dish!  Left out peas (we don't care for them) and added 1 can of chicken broth for hubby.  Adjusted salt and pepper a little, but great and satisfying.

This recipe is wonderful.  It tastes like chicken pot pie just better.  I used chicken legs instead of breasts.  I didn't have to remove the chicken to shred because the meat came right off the bone.  I just had to pick the bone and chicken cartiledge out and that was easy. I used canned peas instead of frozen and mini carrots to avoid the slicing.  I didn't have enugh room in the pot either for the dumplings.  I guess next time I'll have to use a small spoon or a larger pot.  And I will be using this recipe again. Thanks!  Keep the Irish recipes comin'.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written and found it to be an absolutely wonderful dish! I wouldn't change a thing about it! And it wasn't complicated at all, just follow it step by step and the results are a fantastic blend of flavors you're sure to want to make time and again! Thanks so much for this wonderful addition to my recipes!

Good stuff!  I did make a different recipe for the dumplings with this.  The only change I'd make next tiem would be to cut back on the pepper just a little.  It had a bit of an overwhelming pepper taste to it.  Other than that, it was great, and I will probably make it quite often this winter!

This was a great recipe--everyone loved it.  I did think it turned out a bit soupy.  I prefer mine to be a bit thicker.  Also, I didn't have two cans of cream of chicken, so I used one chicken and one cream of celery.  My kids really liked it, and my fiance even finished off the leftovers two days later.  I would recommend this though.

This was a great recipe until the dumplings were added. Way to much of a doughy texture. Next time I'll do the dumplings seperate.

Good, stick-to-your-ribs comfort food. I made the Bisquick recipe dumplings as suggested and it turned out great.  Couldn't quite shake the canned soup taste, but I used low-sodium and next time will try the regular kind. Takes a while to make this but it's worth it on a cold day!

I liked this (4 stars from me), but not a hit with my family (1 star). I made 1/2 the amount of dumplings which seemed fine. My family prefers noodles over dumplings.

Very nice comfort food.  I definitely recommend it...especially if you're cooking for picky eaters.  It's a sure thing, easy to make (how can you go wrong with the Bisquick dumplings), and filling.

Very tasty. I used canned potatoes and added the water from the can to make a little more liquid. Better than regular chicken and dumplings. This is a keeper.

I made this for St. Patricks Day and also served a garden salad and Irresistible Irish Soda Bread and had the family over.  I received many, many compliments and my mom, who never had dumplings, loved it!  I was definitely a hit.  I also added an extra can of soup, omitted 1 onion and omitted the celery, since I didn't have any.  Wonderful!

We aren't big on onions so I omitted those, and I was out of carrots. I put celery seed in instead of the cup of celery. And it was still very good! My kids complained but they complain about anything that is casserole like. (mixed together)They picked out the chicken and filled up on that. Over all, I'll make it again but maybe with some noodles or something on the side to get the kids to eat more.

Needed way more salt than called for.  I found I had to do alot of "doctoring" to get it more flavorful.  My 17 yr. old said it was just okay and hoped dad liked it so he didn't have to eat it again the next day.  So I won't be making this again.

This recipe was ok.  I agree that there's not enough soup in it.  I'm a southern gal, and it's not the kind of chicken 'n dumplings I'm used to.  Worth trying, but definitely not my favorite chicken 'n dumplings recipe.

This was all right. Very hearty. Things went a lot quicker with pre cut veggies.  Be aware this is a very large 4-6 servings recipe, more like 6-8. Overall I'd make it again.

My family really enjoyed this dish.  The only thing that I will do differently next time is:  I will not shread the chicken, I will leave it in large chunks instead.
