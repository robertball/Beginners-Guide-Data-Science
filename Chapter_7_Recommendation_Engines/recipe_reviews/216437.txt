I'm a bit of a new cook, so I ended up burning the pan when I added the flour. I didn't blend the celery well enough, and the soup was entirely too watery, which may have been because I refused to add the rind, and, in getting rid of the rind, I lost a bit of cheese. Despite all this, it ended up being -really- good, which is where all the stars come in. My mom tried it and commented that it seemed unflavorful, while my uncle said he liked it. I, myself, find myself wanting more right now. Imagine how good it would taste if it made it RIGHT! So, I intend to make this again, properly, and then to write a better informed review

3.5. Really yummy, but I think it could use more celery. Also used vegetable broth, herbs de provence, garlic powder, tumeric, and salt. served with sliced baguettes.

I added garlic, tarragon, thyme, 2 bay leaves, and red pepper flake. I also finished with julienne sliced green apple and some crisped fake bacon (Morning Star Farms) instead of the peppers. They were a great contrast in flavor. It was fantastic! Served it with a green leaf/apple salad with a lemon vinaigrette. Great meal.

I've made this three times now.  Each time I used vegetable stock out of preference and white rice flour due to health issues.  I tried it with less cream the first time because I was afraid it would be heavy due to the amount of fat in the brie, but it turned out to be lighter than expected.  The second and third time I used the whole amount as instructed and in fact, it was lighter than a usual "cream of vegetable" soup.  The first time I used a popular industrial brand of brie and it was somewhat bland and somewhat bitter.  In my next attempts I used a local, organic brand and found it much tastier and less bitter.  The third time I added a large bunch of fresh spinach when sautéing the onions and celery and it is to die for!  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe.  I would never have thought of this on my own.

Wasn't sure what to expect with this soup - it was like eating melted brie. My husband actually preferred it as a "dip" - thick & creamy. If you like brie, you'll want to try this soup. It's a great base & could go in so many different directions depending on your tastes. Will be making this one again & trying different variations.

I had some Brie that was getting quite mature so I cut off the rind as it was bitter.  I didn't have enough celery so I added a carrot, some garlic, herbes de Provence, omitted cream and didn't bothering puréeing. Served with julienned apple and crusty homemade bread. Yummy

This was the epitome of comfort food.  The flavor was like a cream of chicken soup with no real flavor of Brie. But in this case that was not a bad thing. I did add some ground nutmeg and cardamom which added to the comfort food experience. Instead of the peppers, I followed the lead of another reviewer and used diced apple and a dollop of hot pepper jam as garnish. My husband actually licked out the bowl with his finger. He has never done this before in my 40 years of cooking for him.
