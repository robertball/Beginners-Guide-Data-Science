This was far better than I even anticipated and will definitely make this again.  I used 3 cans of beans instead of dried-red kidney, great northern and black and it could have used one more. It was so quick and easy to make as well.

I didn't have liquid smoke, but the ham was smoky enough for me. As per the directions on the 13 bean soup bag, I added a can of diced tomatoes and some chopped cabbage, We loved it!!

This soup was awesome!  The only variation I made was to add 8cups of broth. It was very thick with just the 6. Perfect with the 8. Iâ€™ll definitely make this again!

Delicious. Thanksgiving (Canadian haha) ham bone , fresh garden vegetables, onion, garlic, garlic scrapes,  carrots, fresh beans from the garden, bay  leaves, canned beans, black, mixed , navy . Simmer a hour to release the bone flavors. Added a  tbsp. of apple cider vinegar to release the  calcium from the bone...

Loved it! I didn't add the mustard or liquid smoke, it still turned out very tasty.  I had the ham bone from Honey Baked ham from Easter so maybe that helped make it very good.  I had to boil the beans then soak for an hour before cooking since I forgot to soak them overnight.  The beans were perfect.  Anyway, try this out with your next ham bone.

My family loved this. It was amazing on a cold day.. It was too watery for what I wanted. I added cornstarch to the broth to make it a little thicker consistency....more like a stew and not like a soup. That was my only change. I would definitely make this again.

Delicious!  I used a whole ham bone (from a spiral honeybaked ham) and it was wonderful!   Will be making this again and again.
