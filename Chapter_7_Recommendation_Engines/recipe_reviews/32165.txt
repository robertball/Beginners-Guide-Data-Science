I used Pillsbury refrigerated pizza dough, and didn't need to punch it down & let it rise, etc. Just rolled it out, added sauce & toppings, sealed, and baked. Easy! Instead of pizza sauce, I used garlic & onion cream cheese (I heated it in the microwave for about 20 seconds to make it creamy enough to spread), and it was delicious. I also sauteed the onion & mushrooms and let them cool for a few minutes before layering them in. I sprinkled the top of each stromboli with garlic salt and grated Parmesan before baking, which made it more like a flavored pizza crust. Awesome recipe, and very versatile; thanks!

The kids flipped over this! Once assembled, I brushed the top of the dough with evoo and sprinkled with garlic and onion powders and Italian seasonings. Pillsbury pizza dough works incredibly well with this. Thank you Heather!

Yum! This was so easy & really good. Nice change from pizza. I made a couple changes based on what I had on hand & personal preferences. I reduced in half for our smaller family & made one big stromboli rather than smaller ones. I only put half the sauce inside & saved the other half for dipping. I used salami, pepperoni & Italian sausage because that is what I had. And I slightly sauteed the veggies with a little olive oil & Italian seasoning. That is the great thing about this recipe is there are so many ways to change it up. The possibilites are endless. Thanks for a great recipe! Definately added to our rotation.

This was really tasty and very easy.  We had way more than two people could eat, so we ate cold stromboli for days-it was great!

LOVE stomboli but this recipe did not suit me too well. First off, I only used one package of dough and that was enough (16oz). Next, I rolled the entire dough out and layered all meats and sauce. I rolled it up in one motion. I did not have to seperate into four layers, seems to make it more work than anything else. This recipe gave me ideas, but I ended up using my Mother's advice. Thanks anway.

This recipe was fantastic! I made it and it was absolutely perfect! I added olives and replaced the sausage with hamburger and replaced the refrigerated dough with dough I got at a pizzeria. The crust was perfect! The stromboli was so thick and filled with meat that I had to use cheese to hold it together, which by the way made it even better! MAKE THIS RECIPE. LOVE IT. SAVOR IT. DESIGNATE A HOLIDAY AFTER IT. :-)

I make a version of this stromboli once a month instead of getting pizza for the kids.  I use frozen bread dough instead of the pizza dough (sure their about the same).  My kids don't like mushrooms so we skip them.  Instead I put in roasted red peppers for the veggie.  My family LOVES stromboli!  It's very easy to make and have taught my kids how to make this.

Great recipe!  I made it for an appetizer at a holiday get together and there was nothing left!  Everyone loved it!  I got the dough at a local pizza store so it was all ready to go.  I just left out the mushrooms because my husbands doesn't like them.

Great.  I omitted the sauce and served it on the side as a dipping sauce.  A suggestion from a friend was to add a little yellow mustard to the dough before laying everything else on.  Surprisingly the mustard gives it a good taste.

I use a 1 pound package of fresh bread dough from my local bakery.  Cut it in half and roll out 2 pieces.  My husband likes plain toppings and I like a ton of toppings.  For his stromboli I add pizza sauce to half, pepperoni,crumbled bacon, sliced mozz and sliced provolone (3 slices of each), folded it over, pinched the dough closed and brushed on EVOO and sprinkled italian seasoning.  The next one I put sauce on half, pepperoni, crumbled cooked bacon, black olives, bananna peppers, sliced mozz and sliced provolone (3 slices of each). Again, brushed with EVOO and sprinkled with italian seasoning.  Cut 3 slits in each.  Put them on their own cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.  Cooked at 425 for 30 min.  These are out of this world good.  (I rotate the stromboli in oven half way through cooking).  Whats great about this recipe is that you can make an individual stromboli for everyone and stuff it with whatever they like.  Make this all the time.  Love this as an easy dinner.  It is even better the next day cold.  Try it and enjoy !!

We used to make stromboli at least once a month when the kids were young. I just remembered these and was so excited to find 1 pound balls of frozen pizza dough at Walmart.  The crust was excellent! Much better than the frozen bread dough or rolls of refrigerated crust we used to use.  I had leftover homemade marinara, and used both provolone and mozzarella and lots of veggies with turkey pepperoni.  So good!!  I'm going to stock up on those pizza dough balls so we can make these, calzones or pizza whenever we get a craving.

Great way to give each family member what they want and it is SUPER fast to make. I also brush the top with oil and sprinkle Italian seasoning on top.

The sauce should be served on the side; the sauce should be a marinara sauce, not a jar of spaghetti sauce. If you do use spaghetti sauce you should look at the sodium levels because spaghetti sauce can be salty. Most pizza sauce has less salt than spaghetti sauce.

I live in California and everyone I know here hasn't ever heard of Stromboli.  I saw it on Man VS Food, it's one of his favorites and thought I should make it since no place sells it around here.  I followed the recipe exactly and OMG it was good!  Had a bunch of unexpected company and they hogged it down like it was the last thing on earth, got compliments from everyone!  Was a major hit.  Only thing I did differently was I made one huge loaf instead of dividing it up.  Will make again, many, many times.  Thank you so much!  :)

This was great! Very easy...I eliminated most of the meats and just used spicy italian sausage and pepperoni.  I also used the packets of crust (just add water) instead of the refrigerated one.  Lastly, I pretty much eyeballed the ingredients rather than measuring everything out which also made it quicker.  It was delicious-I'll definitelyl make it again!

This was pretty good.  I used pilsbury crust in a tube (no rising needed), and pepperoni & salami were the only meats I had on hand.  Veggies used were red onion, banana peppers & black olives.  Baked for 20 min at 400.  It would probably be better with better dough, and with some ham or another less greasy meat to balance out the grease.  Great base recipe though.

Really good...I used some ground turkey and it kinda made it into a calzone because of the balls of meat.  I also used turkey pepperoni...Green peppers, onions, mushrooms, Parmesan, garlic, salt, pepper, basil, and italian seasoning...folded...brushed with garlic butter and baked at 425.  Turned out GREAT!  I see how the pepperoni and salami and sausage help it stay flat to be more of a sandwich.  I'll make it more like the original recipe on the next run.  Love it though!

Make sure not to roll the dough to thin, turns into a BIG mess. Picking the stromboli up after filling it is kinda tricky so I would suggest transfering the dough onto a cookie sheet, filling it, then flipping it onto another sheet. In the oven right now and smells good so far. Not sure I will make this again, may just go with regular pizza next time.

Very good, but I don't use nearly the amount of sauce as the recipe says.  I just "eyeball" it.  I also like to saute my veggies a little first.

I made this for my boyfriend Tay, and he loved it... I used cresant rolls instead of pizza dough (by accident, I opened the wrong roll :{) but it was super good, I sauteed the onions green peppers and mushrooms with a ton of garlic and butter...so super good!!!

I also used the refrigerated Pillsbury pizza dough, like a few suggested. It made it a quick and easy meal that my whole family loved.  I left out the veggies....because I have a very fussy family, and put a thin layer of yellow mustard on top of the meats, because that's how I remember having in PA when I was young. Great recipe!  Thank you!

This is a great appetizer or dinner when paired with a salad.  I make my own dough (use a pizza crust recipe) but even then it is incredibly easy and fast to make.

This was so good!!  I did make a couple changes, I did not use spaghetti sauce, but a homemade pizza sauce, and could not find the Capacola Sausage, so I used Jimmy Deans hot crumbles instead.  I will make this recipe over and over, thanks!!

Really great easy stromboli recipe. The pizza dough was stretched too thin in sme spots, causing the cheese to leak out onto the sheet, but not enough to distract from the great flavor! I do not car for green peppers so I just skipped them!

My kids went nuts over this!!  I used homemade marinara as a dipping sauce instead of putting it inside the sandwich due to a messy three year old.  They are already asking to have this again on pizza night.

My husband (who doesn't generally cook) wanted to make Stromboli.  I didn't want him to use refrigerated dough, so I made homemade pizza dough (to reduce the salt content). He omitted the ham but otherwise kept the ingredients the same.  Recipe was good.  I would've like to use homemade sauce just to reduce the salt a bit more but I didn't have any made.  Thanks for quenching my husband's craving!

LOVE this recipe!!! This was so easy to make.  I also liked using the dough balls from Wal Mart.  I like that I can make it for my family to suit their own personal tastes.  This is much better than ordering different pizzas and paying more.  This makes for a awsome lunch or dinner.  This is one of my most favorite recipes so far.

I made this using Pillsbury Hot Roll mix instead of frozen bread dough.  Super easy to make and took less than 5 minutes to prepare the dough.  One change would be to not add tomato sauce to the stromboli, but serve it on the side to dip into when eating.  When we order this out there is never sauce inside, and now I know why...it makes the dough on the bottom of the stromboli soggy.  Next time I will leave it out.  I made my own sauce using a can of tomato sauce, seasoned with oregano, basil, onion powder and garlic salt, a dash of salt  & ground pepper, delicious!  Stuffed ours with green peppers, mushrooms, salami, ham, onions, black olives, pepperoni and asiago cheese.  Be sure to fill the center of the dough all the way to the ends then fold over, otherwise you will end up with super doughy ends.  I seasoned the top of the stromboli with a little oregano, basil and parmesan cheese and baked it 25 minutes in a 425 degree oven.  Delicious!

Really liked it. Next time I will cook the vegetables a little longer to soften them more. Also an extra side of dipping sauce is my suggestion.

Delicious. I did brush the top with melted butter and sprinkled parmesan cheese on top for a golden finish. Even my 3 year old loved it!

I only needed one can of dough. I made this twice and both times the bottom burnt. Not sure what I am doing wrong here. Per the pizza dough directions, the pan needs to be greased, if not it will stick to it. Either way it burns regardless.
