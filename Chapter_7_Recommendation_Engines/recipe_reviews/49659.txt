I am from Germany and did not care that much for this one! Back home we use not just any beer to make this kind of drink. We use Hefeweizen! Can also be made with banana juice or Coke!!! 'Banane Weizen or Cola Weizen' Coke and Sprite (lemon soda) are the only things we would add to a normal beer like pilsner or export. Coke makes it a "Dirty Beer-Dreckiges" and mixed with Sprite it is called "Radler" In Germany, Beer is SERIOUS BUSINESS :o)

I did try this recipie when I was also in Germany and it does remove the normal taste of the beer reguardless of who made the beer.  In Germany the beer is stronger and the taste is stronger, and this removes the taste

I guess I just love my beer naked because this didn't really do anything for me. A couple of my guest thought it was pretty good, but too sweet.

I drink this often - but when I can't find cherry juice - I have found that diet cherry pepsi and beer are FANTASTIC together.

I JUST tried this with a bottle of Miller Lite and 1/2 cup of cherry juice from some homemade canned cherries (dark, rich juice).  It really does cut down the beer flavor/ kick part.  I think a 1/4 cup more of cherry juice could give it a more sweeter cherry flavor, but then again, I like sweet! Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

oops, i misread this recipe (not unusual for me!) and put in half a 12oz bottle of beer with 1/2 c of cherry juice.  i'm not a beer lover and i'm desperately searching for recipes with beer bc we have 3 cases or some other crazy number of cases in the house--and we're not beer drinkers!  i don't know how to get rid of all the beer we have, so i thought i'd give this a shot.  it does remove some of the taste of the beer, but i can still taste a small bit of it, so 1/2 c of cherry juice to one bottle of beer wouldn't do it for me, but this is fine.  kind of tastes like seltzer water with a hint of cherry.  thanks for the recipe!

As a serious German beer drinker, this should only be done with a Heffeweitzen.  Then it is delicious on the patio on a warm summer day.

Another thing we had when we were in Germany - Kinderbeer.  Wonderful.  You can use  a good shot of Roses Lime Juice or any Lemon Lime Soda

3.18.18  Didn’t have a Hefeweizen, so I used a lager and sour cherry juice.  You still know you’re drinking a beer, as that’s the dominant taste, but with a subtle cherry taste in the background.  There are all kinds of fruit-flavored beers in the marketplace now, but I’m sticking with an IPA when I want a beer.
