Wished I would have made more!  The family loved it.  Since we all don't like rosemary, I used a teaspoon of basil leaves.  The kids would not have liked balsamic, so I sprinkled some grated Parmesan at the end.  Will definitely make this again since I have more zucchini than I know what to do with.  I would probably use only 1/2 teaspoon salt next time.

My husband tried this recipe when his zucchini patch started to produce great quantities of squash. We wanted something that wasn't pan fried with cheese on top, like we always prepare it. This was fast, easy, healthy, and delicious. He didn't change a thing in the recipe.  The flavor complemented the grilled pork we were eating. Since we always have the ingredients on hand, even the fresh rosemary, I saved it to my Recipe Box. We did use a good quality balsamic vinegar to ensure a great flavor.

This turned out a bit sweet, I know the balsamic vinegar is sweet, but the zucchinis have enough natural sweetness that the combination was cloying. I think that just a bit of lemon juice with the olive oil would make a good difference. Makes a very pretty presentation.

This is by far my favorite "healthy" recipe. We double the oil mixture and spread it over sliced eggplant and have an amazing, healthy dinner, all cooked on the grill in no time!

This turned out AWESOME!!!  I used Basil because I didn't have Rosemary, and used a suggestion someone else said, to add some Romano Cheese on top after taking off the grill.  Mmm Good, It was almost gone before everyone got firsts, should have made more.

Somehow I managed to forget the Balsamic and this was still delicious. I tossed the zucchini in the basting sauce before grilling and then basted with the remaining sauce. I can't wait to try again with the Balsamic added.

I made this for a dinner party in the summer. This grilled zucchini along with cedar-plank grilled salmon (added sprigs of rosemary inspired by the zucchini dish) was absolutely delicious. My whole dinner party gobbled it up and said that it belonged in a 5-star restaurant.

We used a rub that we found on this site from a pork tenderloin recipe. We had the rub already made, so we tried it. It was fantastic. I think you could use just about any seasoning you wanted for different effects. Slicing using a mandolin made these easy to manage on the grill and made for a nice presentation when plated

We also forgot the balsamic but it was still terrific.  Doing the low starchy carb thing so we just had the zucchini with grilled steak.  Did not have fresh rosemary so I used 1/2 the amount dried and it worked just fine. Very good and healthy.

I'll me making it again, but most likely marinating the zucchini in the oil with more garlic and rosemary.  It was pretty bland by itself, but once you put the balsamic on it it was really tasty!

All I can say is wow!! My husband & I both LOVED this! Made just as directed except I didn't feel like firing up the grill, so I pan fried it in a very hot skillet.  Make sure the pan is hot & dont over cook it or it will get mushy.  Will definitely be making this again.  Also, I brushed the olive oil & spices on about 30 minutes before I cooked them to let the flavors soak in. Great healthy recipe!

Best way to eat zucchini EVER!  Very gourmet.  and easy.  No tweaks required.  Absolutely perfect - proportions, flavor, everything.  Balsamic drizzle, after grilling, adds just the right amount of sweet/savory with the spices.  Highly recommend.  Will make this again and again.  Thank you!

This was different than other grilled zucchini recipes I've tried. Loved the  flavor addition of fresh rosemary!  I used basil infused olive oil.

We love zucchini and balsamic vinegar so this recipe was right up my alley.  I used basil as hubs isn't a fan of Rosemary and I couldn't get small zucchini so I had to go with larger ones but I don't think that it made a difference in the taste. Because of the amount of oil in the recipe I did get some flare-ups and in future I will probably marinate instead of brushing the oil mixture on.  I served these with grilled salmon filet  and a wild and white rice mixture.

Easy and delish. I prepared it in the morning, and let it marinate all day, which resulted in loads of flavor. I cut the oil to 3 T. (which was plenty), and since I don't like rosemary, I used thyme and basil instead. The adults and older kids couldn't get enough of it, the little kids wouldn't touch it - as expected.

Didn't need to change a thing. Delicious. Only wish I could get my husband to at least try a bite.

Was a nice change for zucchini.  I love zucchini, but husband not too fond of it.  He liked this version for a change.  Grilling added a nice smokey taste.  Will make again, although will either cut into thicker slices, or grill for shorter amount of time. Didn't really taste the balsamic vinegar,so may add it to the bowl with the other ingredients. We both love the taste of balsamic and there just wasn't much balsamic flavor.  This easy marinade would be good on other vegetables or even meat.
