Came out good. I skipped the olives as we do not like them and added sweet peas drained and rinsed. Came out great.

2-20-2016  ~The truth be told, I made some tartar sauce yesterday for a dinner that never materialized and this pasta salad put it to good use.  Mayonnaise, dill pickles and red onion – all set and ready to go!  I did add more chopped pickle, however, since the recipe seemed to want quite a bit of it.  Yes, it was a little dill pickly, so good thing Hubs and I are pickle lovers.  I backed off on the Dijon by a third, and it was just right – more than that and I think it would have been Dijon overkill.  I added some green peas just because I knew it would be good. Overall, I liked this well enough.  Good, not great.

I did not add the black olives but substituted frozen green peas.  My family loves this recipe.

I'll be honest and say that I used this recipe for a base. It is a great base. The only thing I left out was the ham and then I added a bunch of fresh dill. I sitting here eating it now and I can guarantee that my son will take it for school lunch tomorrow. Thank you for the recipe.

Yummy! Made this to go with dinner one night. Good way to help clean out the fridge. I used leftover ham from Easter and black olives I had. I like a sprinkling of Salad Supreme on top. Thanks
