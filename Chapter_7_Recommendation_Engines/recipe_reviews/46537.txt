I didn't see that anyone else had suggested this, but I did this recipe in my slow-cooker. I put the sweet potatoes on the botom, since they take the longest. Then I put a layer of onions and apples, then the chops, then another layer of onion and apples. On each layer i lightly dusted with salt and pepper and then sprinkled with a brown sugar/cinnamon/nutmeg mix - probably used double-triple the amt of brown sugar called for. I cooked it on medium for about 5 1/2 hours. It turned out GREAT. The pork really soaked in the flavor since it was sandwiched between the onion and apples(used golden delicious, by the way, sliced thick, and the texture was perfect). The flavor of this was perfect for an autumn evening - I love this combination!

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would - but that was on my second try.  The first try was a bit of a disaster but still tasted terrific.  I'd like to pass on what I learned:  The amount of ingredients were on the mark, except for the pepper.  1)make sure you slice the onion and sweet potatoes very thin - they will then cook within the hr. 2) Cut the apples thicker - not too thick - since they take a shorter amt of time to cook (if too thin they will turn to mush)  3) Use the "GRANULATED" brown suger (I used the old fashioned kind the first time and it wouldn't melt - the pepper got stuck in the sugar - I had to mush in down - not a pretty sight!).  I also cut back on the pepper the second time - we love pepper, especially on sweet potatoes but found that 1 tsp. was sufficient).  I cooked this in a corningware baking dish with cover and the second time it was a pretty presentation and everyone loved it.  It is fun and easy to prepare.  One pork chop per serving is not enough in my house!!!  Believe it or not - it is a light meal.  You might want to serve a salad with it since some were looking for a third chop!  The pork really picks up the juices while it is cooking.  This is a keeper and a really quick meal - thanks Ashbeth.

My family enjoyed this recipe a lot. Instead of sprinkling the chops with salt and pepper, I used Morton's Seasoning Salt, which is a nice blend of seasonings. I did mix cinnamon with the sugar and made a little more than what is called for. Next time I would not use the onions. My family did not think the onions blended well with the sweet potatoes and apples. I also did not season the casserole with the 2 tsp. of pepper and the 1 tsp of salt. Somehow I didn't think that would go well with the sugared potatoes and apple slices. I would suggest that if you make this recipe, you microwave the sliced sweet potatoes for a couple minutes to give them a head start in cooking. I found the potatoes were a little hard and the meat a little overdone, following the recipe. I think if you started the potatoes, you could cook this recipe for about 45 minutes and get juicier chops.

We Loved this.  I browned the chops and onions frist. Then I whisked balsamic vinegar, maple syrup, brown sugar and mustard then poured it over everything. I also nuked the sweet potaoes for 2 min before I put them in the dish to give them a head start.  I cooked it for 30 min.  delish.

I added a half cup of water to the pan before baking so the pork chops wouldn't dry out, and they were so moist and tender.  Also, I had to bake them for an extra 15 minutes or so because the potatoes were still crunchy.  I recommend tossing the apples, onions, potatoes, and seasonings together before putting them over the pork chops because all of the seasonings stayed on the top and I had a layer of veggies/fruit that were way too seasoned and a layer without seasonings.  Last thing, add a little bit of garlic powder to the pork chops before putting them in the pan, it really adds a nice flavor.  This was a HUGE hit with my family and they beg me to make it over and over again!

This was an excellent use of both pork chops (in this case, boneless loin chops) and sweet potatoes.  I did adapt the recipe slightly, partly based on earlier comments, and the result brought raves from my non-pork-fan husband.  First, I dredged the chops in a flour/salt/pepper mixture and browned them in a small amount of margarine in the frying pan.  I then layered the onions, potatoes and apples twice, dusting each layer with salt, pepper, brown sugar and cinnamon.  I sprinkled the top with nutmeg, and drizzled 1/2 - 1 cup apple cider over all.  I then covered the pan and slow-baked it for slightly more than 2 hours at 325 degrees.  The result was a fabulous dinner, with tender meat and perfectly done potatoes and apples.  We were very happy with the experiment; my husband's final comment was, "Well, this sure is a keeper!"

This was so good, even my fiance who doesn't like sweet potatoes ate it up.  Here are the changes I made:  1) I placed the chops in a glass 9 x 13 dish 2) I cooked the whole sweet potatoes in the microwave (after washing and poking holes) for about 4 minutes, then peeled the skin off and chopped 3) I only used 1 onion 4) I put the sweet potato, onion, and apple in a big bowl and mixed it with the brown sugar, a small bit of pepper, and a few good grinds of sea salt.  The aroma of this cooking was amazing.  This was a great dish for the first day of fall!

We loved this recipe.  It was a breeze to put together and was simply delicious.  I did brown the chops before baking.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

The only reason this got four stars was because it simply served as a "spring board" for me in creating an awesome autumn dinner.  I took this basic idea and completely  modified it for a slow cooker. First, I mixed the onion, apples (chunked instead of rings), 1/2 cup dried chopped cherries, and two stalks celery with 1 teaspoon cinnamon, Â¼ teaspoon nutmeg, and 2 Tablespoons brown sugar.   Next, I layered the sweet potatoes at the bottom of the slow cooker and lightly sprinkled them with some more cinnamon and brown sugar. I poured half of the first mixture over the potatoes.  Salt and pepper pork on both sides and lay atop the apple/onion/cherry/celery mixture in the slow cooker. I poured the remainder of the apple/onion/cherry/celery mixture on the top of the pork. Finally, I dumped about 1 cup of apple cider over  the contents of the slow cooker and cooked on low for about 6-7hours. This assembly took only 15minutes and I had an amazing, juicy dinner that was perfect with a huge hunk of challah bread from the local bakery to soak up the sweet/savory juice.  My mom was shocked that she had arrived at my house after a 6hour drive before me since I had work until 7pm, and at 7:30 I had such an awesome dinner on the table.

I tried this one last night and it was a hit, HOWEVER, I had help from 2 grandchildren (6 & 13) who were in charge of the brown sugar - also added cinamon, nutmeg, ground cloves - then were surprised when the apples tasted like apple pie!  There was none left and there were only 3 of us!  Will definitely make again when they are here and if they can remember their part of the recipe (smile).  Grateful grandmother.

I'm sorry, but the pepper on this awful.  It was so hot, we ended up eating cereal for dinner.  I think if you put MAYBE 1/4 of the amount called for, you would have an "OK" meal.

This was absolutely fabulous!!   It was perfectly simple.  I just added salt and pepper to the chops then layered the apple, pots and onions and sprinkled each layer with brown sugar and cinnamon.  The pork chops were super tender and delicious. also I did slice the veggies thin so that everything was tender and juicy after one hour.  this will def. be on our table often

I took the advice of another reviewer and dumped all of these ingredients in the crockpot. I cooked it on low for 6 1/2 hours. Was delicious!

5 stars when you tweak it a little to make it your own! I will definitely make this again. I followed the recipe pretty closely the first time, though I did take the suggestion to nuke the sweet potaotes about 2.5 minutes and toss the apples, potatoes and onion (I only used about 1/2 an onion since that's all I had room for) with the seasoning before adding to the skillet.   The pepper was too much, so I'd cut back on that next time down to about 1 tsp total and I wanted more of the brown sugar flavor so I'll add more of that next time, and maybe a little more seasoning (garlic, etc.) on the pork chops. Otherwise YUMMY! It was nice to have something a little different, and the potatoes were SO nice and tasty coming right out of the oven. It makes a lot of its own juice, and I just drizzled a little of that over the top of everything for some of the sweet flavor. The apples are great in this. I used one gala and one granny smith. Definitely cut them a little thicker so they don't just turn to mush - they're perfect with the pork. Hubby wasn't thrilled with the onion in this dish, he liked the focus on the sweet and didn't think they meshed so we'll leave that out next time.

Used sweet yellow onion and the flavor was great. To the pork I added italian herbs and garlic powder. Cooked the potato slices in the microwave for 2 minutes. Tossed the brown sugar and season with the apple, onion and potato, also added small amount of water and cooked in a glass square dish. Everyone loved it!

I definately will make this again. I substituted honey for the brown sugar and used granny smith apples because they are a firmer apple.  Added greens as my side dish.  Very nice dinner quick and easy too.

Simple to make and delicious. I use a casserole dish and follow another reviewers advice and layer sweet potatoes, then onion, apple, pork, onion, and apple. Also I use honey instead of brown sugar.  Just plain delicious!

I had high hopes for this dish, but it did not turn out well.  The pork was over cooked, the vegetables were undercooked and the apples were the only thing that turned out well.  While I liked the flavors together, the pork didn't absorb any of the flavors from the pan drippings and ultimately I was disappointed.

I used a pork tenderloin in a casserole dish.  I cut the potatoes into about 1/2 inch slices and microwaved about 3 minutes first.  Put the sweet potatoes, apples and onions (only used one and that was plenty!) on top.  I think more apples would have been good.  Didn't taste the brown sugar at all, very subtle.  So if you want it to taste sweeter, add more.  My 2-year old ate and ate and ate.  He really loved it.  My husband liked it too.  I cooked it at 425 for about 30 minutes covered and then another 5 or so uncovered.  Everything was perfectly cooked.  Will make it again!

I did this one in my slow cooker as well and it turned out great.  I took advice from a few others and put the sweet potatoes on the bottom.  I fried the onions and browned the pork chops in olive oil.  I layered half the onions and apples (sliced thick) on the potatoes and sprinkled them with brown sugar and cinnimon.  Then placed the pork chops and then the rest of the onions and apples sprinkled with more brown sugar/cinnimon.  My house smelled like baked apple pie all afternoon.  The pork chops were so tender they fell apart, and were very flavorful with the apples and onions.  The sweet potatoes cooked down to almost nothing so I did have to make a rice side dish to have with it.  But all in all it was a great dish and I will definatly try it again.

This is a solid base recipe, meaning that you should use it as a jumping off point. We made this tonight and it was delicious, but we made a few changes after reading some of the reviews. We too browned the pork chops (sprinkled with salt, pepper, and a spash of balsamic vinegar). I put the browned chops, sweet potatoes, apples, and onions in a Dutch oven and then we poured 3/4 cup of apple cider over everything to help keep everything moist. Finally, I whisked some brown sugar, balsamic vinegar, and maple syrup (about 2-3 Tbs each) and poured that over everything to finish it off. I put the lid on, baked for 1 hour, and it was great. Next time we'll add less apple cider and we might decrease our cooking time, as the chops were a bit tough (they were boneless so they need less time).

Almost 5 stars, but not quite. The flavours of the onions, potatoes and apples were fantastic, but the pork chops were bland and overcooked (even though I took them out after 45 minutes). I also cut the amount of salt and pepper in half because I knew that would be too much. I will definitely make again, but with a few changes. Next time, I'll season the pork with some herbs and/or spices as well as the salt and pepper. I'll also take the pork chops out after 30-35 minutes and cover then with foil to keep them warm and then put everything else back in to cook for another 10-15 minutes.

we liked this alot. The only thing I changed was I sauted everything before I put it into the oven adding a little pepper and brown sugar then and the rest when I baked it. It made a lovely sauce at the bottom of the pan. Next time I will either cook for a shorter time or cut the sweet potatoes into larger pieces, they were slightly over cooked. Otherwise VERY VERY TASTY! And looks pretty on a serving dish.

Made this in the slow cooker like first comment on page.  It was a little sweet and cooking it on high for six hours made it too mushy.  Next time we'll try cooking it on high for only 4 hours.  I also sprinkled a little nutmeg on the top and, when it was all done, I put sage on the potato/apple mix.

Easy and comes out extremely delicious - hard to mess up! I followed the advice of some fellow reviewers - tossed the onions, sweet potatoes and apples in about 1 tsp of brown sugar individually before putting on top of porkchops. Used a ceramic baking dish and it turned out great! Also poured 1/2 cup of water into the pan before putting it into the oven. Kept everything moist and delicious! Amazing taste, great recipe, would definitely make again!

I am on a quest to finish up the last of the sweet potato bounty from the garden and found this recipe. Very nice comfort food! I followed the suggestion of CookinNurse and made this in the slow cooker. It came out great, the chops were juicy and moist, the vegetables were cooked perfectly. The only thing I added was about a half cup of apple cider to the pot. Served some cornbread stuffing on the side. We all enjoyed this.

Comfort food at its best! My husband and I both loved the wonderful medley of flavors. I quickly browned the pork chops in my oven-proof skillet and then layered the other ingredients on top. Like others, I reduced the pepper (a generous few twists of the pepper mill). I also sprinkled nutmeg and cinnamon over the top. I'm glad I took the suggestion of thinly slicing the sweet potatoes. They were perfect. The onions weren't as soft as I'd like them. Next time I'll add them to the pan when I brown the chops. All in all, the sweetness and flavor blends were just right. And I was thrilled with how fast the dish went together. This is a winner!

I followed the directions exactly and this was awful. The pork chops  were so overcooked and dry. The sweet potato's were not cooked. I sliced them really thin to help them cook but they were not near done. The only thing edible were the apples and onions.

I took the suggestions of browning the chops, omitting the onion and pepper. I added fresh garlic and cranberries. I will serve with baby greens and a balsamic vinegar. Come to think of it cold left overs served on a bed of greens and walnuts and balsamic will make a yummy second day meal. I gave 4 stars because it was a great back drop to a yummy meal.

I love recipes like this... Where the delicious to difficulty ratio is really high. Its really simple and has interesting flavor. A great fall meal for us. I cooked in a glass casserole and I added balsalmic to the butter sauce. Also I assembled the night before, and it was no worse for the wear. Fabulous!

We love this combination but find it is much better to brown the chops in a little oil on each side- otherwise they tend to taste stewed and much jucier this way.

Used the slow cooker as well with a few modifications for a sweet/sour flavor. Bottom layer of sweet potatoes along with about 1/4 cup of cider vinegar. Next added pork chops seasoned with salt and 1 tsp of black pepper. On top of chops layered sliced apples and onions sprinkled with granulated brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Finally another splash of cider vinegar over the top apple/onion layer. Cooked in the crockpot on high 5 hours. Flavor was awesome! 4 stars vs 5 stars because the pork chops were a tiny bit dry. Will probably try loin chops instead of center cut next time.

Fixed it last night & it was a hit- no leftovers! The only thing I did different was brown the chops in a large skillet, then added all the other ingredients plus a cup of apple juice & let it simmer. Came out very tender and lots of flavor.

I followed the recipe and other advice on here, and found the pork very juicy and the meal delicious. I browned the meat first and added nutmeg and allspice over the top of the stacked chops just before placing in oven. Using a Mandolin slicer made it really easy to cut the potatoes thin enough (1/8"). Even though I sliced the apples thicker, 1/4" was still too thin because they turned to mush. So keep the apple slices really thick or maybe add them later. My method of browning worked with the recipe's stated baking time of exactly 1 hour. The chops were 1" thick.

Recipe tasted fine, but end result looks unappealing. The next time I make it, I'll first brown the chops so they are not grey when done. In addition, I'll put the apple slices in during the last 15 minutes so they are not so mushy.

This dish was awesome! I modified it by using two big chunks of pork roast which I seasoned with S&P and garlic powder. I browned them in the skillet with two Tbsp. oil. Then I put them in a 9x13 pan and surrounded by  thick slices of yams and onions. I used the juice from one can of chunk pineapple mixed with 1/4c. brown sugar and a 1/8tsp cinnamon to pour over the top. Cover tightly and bake for about an hour. then I added the chunk pineapple and the apples and baked  for additional 20 mins. This dish was outstanding.

This was a very good fall dinner. The only problem I had was that my pork chops weren't as tender as I would have liked them but it might have been the cut. I will make this again.

I loved it! Because onion is an issue with one of the people I was cooking for, I left it out. I also threw in a little orange juice and some cinnamon. It definitely does help to precook the sweet potatoes a little. I did microwave them for 3 minutes first (which makes them hot to peel, by the way!) but even longer would have been better.

Love this recipe. I followed previous posters advice and precook potatoes. Then I brown chops in my cast iron skillet with the onions. When they're done browning I put potatoes and apples on top and then put the whole thing in the oven. Delicious!

Very good recipe.  I did as others suggested and microwaved the sweet potato first and also mixed together some maple syrup, balsamic vinegar, mustard and the brown sugar and coated the potatoes and apples in it.  I also kept the apples a little larger.  Then I baked it at 345 degrees for 45 minutes.  Will make this again

My spouse and I loved this! I tweeked the recipe a little bit, as I like to experiment.
I chopped 1 onion, fried  1/2 way then added a little margarine & water then added my pork chops (until 1/2 done, recommend it for speedy cook time.) and sprinkled pepper, salt and rosemary.
Chopped and thinly sliced my sweet potatoes and microwaved them for 2 mins. ( I recommend this as it helps w/ the cooking time)
I then got my 2 qt casserole dish and sprayed it w/ non-stick cooking spray, added a little water to the bottom just to cover it (made the pork chops juicy and tender Mmm) preheated the oven to 375 then put in about 7 pieces of onion from the frying pan, then added the 4 pork chops, then layered the sweet potatoes on top, then topped with the 2 apples (peeled, cored and thick sliced; thick slice them as they cook very fast and will be mushy otherwise) topped with  brownsugar, cinnamon, and maple syrup. I found this was perfect..I am glad I didnt use the recommended p & s, or the extra onion. Would have been toooooo much. The Rosemary (which I have a love affair with) was a perfect added touch!! 
I let it cook for about an hour, let it cool for 10 minutes and it was amazing. Lots of flavour and is Def. a keeper and will be having it on a regular basis. :) YUM!

For sweet potato and apple lovers, this is a perfect dinner!!  I agree with another reviewer to place the apples, onion and sweet potatoes in a large bowl and stir together with all the spices, along with a small drizzle of olive oil to help the spices to stick.  also, .i left the apples unreeled and they he led keep their shape, not to mention saving the extra nutrients.  Make a pan sauce with the liquid left in the pan and dollop each serving with sour cream.

Wonderful blend of flavors in this recipe!  Culled some suggestions from other reviews such as omitting some of the pepper and adding some cinnamon and loved the way it all came together.  My family thinks it is a winnner!!!!

I made this with the maple syrup, balsamic vinegar, mustard, and brown sugar sauce that another reviewer recommended, and that was the best part. I cooked it covered at 375 for an hour, but the sweet potatoes (sliced less a 1/4-inch thick) and the onions (even thinner) were still crunchy. If I make it again, I will microwave the potatoes and onions for a few minutes first.

This is delicious but I would recommend that you slice the sweet potatoes thin, maybe a quarter inch and separate the onions into individual rings. and cut the apples about 1/2 inch thick. This way everything is done at the same time.  I browned the chops before adding them to the pan seasoning them with the salt and pepper, first (I only used about a teaspoon of pepper). Once in the baking dish I poured a teaspoon of maple syrup over each chop, and gave them a light sprinkling of cajun seasoning.  I then layered on the onions, sweet potatoes and apples, sprinkled on half of the brown sugar then repeated it for a second layer.  I drizzled more maple syrup over the top and added a small amount of water to the baking dish.  This is a wonderful recipe and you can easily put your own twist on it and still have a delicious meal in a bowl.

This was great, I added 1/2 cup orange juice so it wouldn't stick to the pan, but I didn't need to, it made its own juice. It was great.

HOLY !  This was so good.  I'm such a lush for sweet veggies and sweets with pork that this was the perfect meal for me.  AND, it's even better since it makes your house smell so festive, Fall-ish and super yummy!

My husband and I loved this. I  followed the recipe exactly. Everything was nicely done in one hour. Would give it a 5 but, it does take time with all the peeling and cutting.

I tried the recipe as is and it comes out very bland all of it the porkchops, the sweet potatoes, the apples, everything. 

I should have taken the other reviewers suggestions and added some other spices (cinnamon/nutmeg)--but I didn't and ended up with a blah, barely edible meal. I would try it again but I think the family would run away.

Outstanding!  I peeled the yams.  I added a little more brown sugar and also some cinnamon.  My apples were done sooner than the rest so I removed them.  Chops were very juicy.

We loved this!  It is very simple, but the combination is delicious.  I had trouble with the sweet potatoes being undercooked and dried out the first time and had to microwave them the rest of the way.  Now I slice them thinner and put them near the bottom and outside of the pan. I also used a very dark brown sugar, much darker than regular store brands so it had a deeper molasses flavor.  The type of apple makes a big difference also.  We prefer a middle of the road apple as far as sweetness.  The Granny Smith was a bit too tart, but can be balanced with more brown sugar.

I had just cooked another pork chop recipe from this site--"Broiled Pork Chops"--a few nights ago, which was received with raves by my family, so this recipe had a lot to live up to!   Fortunately everyone liked it very much.   I didn't modify the recipe by much.  I cooked 6 chops instead of 4, and only used 1 apple (that was all we had).  I chose to use 1 onion as that seemed like more than enough after I'd arranged it all on the plate.  The only thing I would recommend to anyone else is that you may want to add an extra bit of brown sugar--the consensus was that it could've used a bit more.  Also, it took about an hour and a half to cook instead of an hour (oven is new, so probably related to the altitude) so for anyone who's going to make this, you may want to start it a little early just in case!  I served it with Mexican Corn, also on this site, and it was a nice complement to have something spicy with the sweetness of the brown sugar and yams.

I tried this recipe last evening.  It was simple and good but we were looking for more of a brown sugar coating so I would probably add more brown sugar and maybe a pat of butter and some cinnamon.

Great complete meal all in one pot! I seasoned and browned boneless thick chops. Instead of rings, I halved the onions, potatoes and apples before slicing (potatoes thin, apples thick and onions in the middle). Divided in half and layered onions, apples, potatoes, seasoning & sprinkled brown sugar, then repeat with remaining half. All were done evenly in about 45 min.

This was bland, the flavors didn't not meld together.  I even added some cider and a mixture of fresh herb as it seemed odd there wasn't any as part of the recipe.  I would not recommend making this recipe.

I tried this recipe as it's written. I however thought it was too sweet. So I tried it again without the sugar and found that it was delicious with just the natural sweetness from the ingredients. Especially if you use walla walla sweet onions.

This gave the pork chops great flavor.. however in order to cook the sweet potato I ended up over cooking the chops and they were a bit dry.  Also I would decrease the pepper.  I will absolutely try this again... only I'll cut the sweet potato thinner and smaller

Great quick dinner! After reading the reviews I decided to brown the chops (seasoned with salt and pepper) and onions first in a little butter and evoo and microwaved the sliced sweet potatoes for about 5 minutes (just until they started to get a little soft).  Using the same ovenproof skillet, added the rest of the ingredients, cutting way back on the pepper and then baked it at 375 for 35 minutes...it was perfect! Chops were moist, potatoes and apples tender but not mushy. Served with green beans drizzled with a little balsamic vinegar.  Will definitely make again.

I loved this!  I took others advice and microwaved the sweet potatoes for about 3 minutes before cooking the rest and it worked great.  I also agree 2 tsp. of pepper is way too much, as is a tsp. of salt.   The combination of pork, onion, sweet potato and apple is so good and simple.  Super easy too!!

YUMYUM!  I followed the suggestions to toss the apples, sweet potatoes and onions with probably 2 TBS of brown sugar as well as add about 1/2 cup of water to the pan.  I used my mandolin for the onion and sweet potato and my apple corer/peeler/slicer for the apples.  Everything was about the same thickness.  I only used about half of an onion, 3 small apples, and 1 large sweet potato.  Delicious!

Like others after reading the reviews I decided to do this in the slow cooker.  I added celery and red onion and about 1/3 cup of apple juice to remove the pan drippings after browing the chops. I also added the apples on top of all other ingredients after they had been in an hour, this helped keep them from becoming to mushy...My husband raved about this and he is usually pesimistic about new recipes.  Thanks for a good recipe.

I've used this recipe several times and now it is definitely one of my "go to" recipes because of the easiness and convenience. I use a cast iron skillet to cook the turkey chops in (yes, I use turkey and it is just as good!) and then I layer the apple, onion and sweet potato on top, cover with foil and put the cast iron skillet right in the oven. Yum! Thanks for this one, also the simplicity makes it easy to add or modify.

This recipe is similar to one I have already, but I liked the idea of adding sweet potatoes to the mix.  So I tried it in the crockpot, as someone else suggested...and REALLY loved it.  I think to keep the chops juicy, it's best to brown them on both sides first.  But then, I just did the layers as suggested and it turned out great.  Red onion actually works the best in this recipe, IMHO, because they are sweeter and less 'oniony' when cooked.  So those who don't like a potent onion flavor should try just using red onion and maybe cutting back on the amount, a little.  Really, the red onions add so much.  Served this with a side salad and it was a big hit!  NO LEFTOVERS!!

I have made this a couple of time now using Jonagold apples each time. The FIRST time I used the method and recommendation from âCookinNurse.â Using the slow cooker, putting the Sweet potatoes on the bottom as they take the longest. Then I put a layer of onions and apples, then the chops, then another layer of onion and apples. Dusting each layer lightly with salt and pepper then sprinkled with the brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg mix. After peeling and coring the apples I cut them into large bites/chunks. I cooked it on high for about 4 1/12 hours and it was wonderful. My husband has asked for these again and said they may be the best chops he has ever had. My teenage sons liked the pork chops and apples; they donât care for sweet potatoes.   The SECOND time I used this recipe I did it in the oven because it was too late in the day to use the slow the cooker, it was still good but not as impressive. I definitely recommend using the slow cooker.  It is that much  better.   Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Very Good!  I cut the amount of onion in half and seared the pork before baking as seen in other reviews.  Next time I think I'll try a tenderloin and throw in some dried cherries!  This is an easy, all in one great dish!

My husband doesn't care for sweet potatoes but he really enjoyed this recipe! I saved time by using canned cut up sweet potatoes, added equal amount of apples cut up.  I added the brown sugar and some cinnamon, mixed it together with the apples and potatoes, then put it on top of the boneless pork chops. I also did not use salt on pepper.  Very, very easy! Quick and delicious!

Absolutely delicious!!!  

All the flavors are unique and not for everyone, but if you're curious, then go ahead and make a batch!!!

I was skeptical at first but you should try it at least once.  I held back 1 sweet potato and 1 onion thinking there was enough but I was mistaken.

I took the advice of some of the other reviewers by using less pepper and zapping the potatoes in the microwave.  We also added a little cinnamon to the mix which was quite tasty.  The only other change I would recommend is maybe a little less onion.  It was just a little too much for us.  Otherwise this recipe is definitely a keeper.

Great recipe!  I marinated it in apple juice and white wine, then also added this when I cooked it in the oven. It came out very tender and juicy!

I made this in the crock pot. It was good but messy. I would rather have mashed sweet potatoes, homemade applesauce and pork chops all separate. We did like the flavors.

I actually microwaved the potatoes for three minutes prior and additionally browned the meat very quickly with the onions and put the apples in a bit later - but after 50 mins, the meat was really overcooked and the potatoes were still hard.  Next time I'd prepare the potatoes entirely differently and roast them on their own, (I think they have a better flavour roasted rather than cooking in the meat juices which means they don't crisp up).  I'd also only cook the meat for 30 mins - with the apples and onion.  I also agree more sugar is needed...I added more than it said and it still wasn't enough.

This turned out great! I followed the other suggestions with the thick apple slices, thinly sliced SPs and some cinnamon and nutmeg. I did have to add a little water during the process (and I cooked it in a casserole dish) but it was delicious. I would also recommend browning the pork and softening the onions first in a pan together first. Yum. Eating it at the computer right now.

Like many of the others I made the recipe adding additional brown sugar as well as cinnamon and nutmeg and far less fresh ground pepper.  I also browned the chops for additional flavor.  My pork chops were quite thick so weren't done with the apples and sweet potatoes so I removed the vegetables and continued to cook the pork chops alone.

The next time I make it I will use the regular cut pork chops and sectioned, rather than sliced apples.  I will also quickly carmelize the onion slices.

All in all with some variation it's a wonderful recipe and definitely worth the work to customize.

This was a great success. I did however sear the chops before baking. The meat just fell off the bone and the combination of apples, onions and sweet potatoes was awsome. I topped it with some more butter and brown sugar and put it under the broiler for a few minutes before serving. Everybody loved it. Michael

Quite delicious!  I found myself looking at clean plates from every family member - even the kids!  

That said, it has 5-star potential.  I increased the amount of sugar and added pumpkin pie-type spices as recommended by another reviewer; it definitely made the dish better than originally written.  Also, despite cutting very fat chops and very thin sweet potatoes and onions, I still had to remove the pork from the pan about ten minutes before the rest of the dish was ready.  Next time I will precook the onions and sweet potatoes a bit while browning the pork.

A very successful dinner, one that my family has already asked me to make again!

With a few modifications recommended by others, this is easy and quite good.  I quickly browned the chops after dusting with salt and pepper. Use thick chops. Add some cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also add some garlic and extra brown sugar. I have found that by cooking for about 1 hr. 20 minutes everything is cooked well.

After reading some of the reviews I almost didn't try this dish--I can't stand bland food!  So, I made some changes/additions upon the advice of previous reviewers.  First, I seasoned the pork chops with onion salt and garlic power, dipped them in flour and pan fried them.  When I added the onions, apples and potatoes I did them in two layers; each layer I sprinkled liberally with brown sugar, cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg.  I had some leftover chopped pecans so I threw those on top, which added a nice texture.  It turned out very well--next time I would cook it less than an hour since I sliced everything very thin and it got slightly mushy.

I tried this with Cortland apples and found it was too strong of a taste. Macintosh's work best with this recipe and my family's tastes. We like to mash the apples over top of the pork and eat it that way. The others weren't kidding when they said to fine slice the sweet potatoes either. If you don't they'll be crunchy. Good recipe and easy too.

This is fast,easy and exquisite. I used three pork loin chops, each 3/4" thick. On top of them I added three sprigs of fresh Rosemary. The only other modification was some butter crumbled on top of the brown sugar. It is a perfect marriage of scent, texture, taste and satisfaction.

I did not make any changes. You have to like sweet potatoes to like this dish. I don't really like them I found out. My 95 year old aunt does. My mom does but my dad wouldn't touch it. He did eat the pork chop though.

Terrible recipe. It might have been better had I sliced the sweet potatoes very thinly, but by the time the apples, onions, and sweet potatoes were cooked, the pork was over cooked and the entire dish was very dry.  I would never make it again, nor would I recommend it to anyone.

This was super easy and delicious! I made a few adjustments: I first seasoned the pork chops with salt & pepper then browned them in a skillet. I sliced the sweet potatoes (using a mandoline) very thinly and the apples and onion thicker.  I think because I browned the chops first, they didn't need the full hour so they ended up a little dry, but the overall dish was delicious. I will definitely make this again, but test the temperature of the chops sooner.

Really yummy on a cold January night. We did microwave the potatoes for 4 min as suggested. We mixed the peeled, chucked potatoes with the apple wedges, rings from 1 onion, 1/4 C brown sugar, 1 teaspoon nutmeg, a sprinkle of kosher salt, and 1 can drained sauerkraut in a medium bowl.  Then we layered the fruitand veggies on top of the pork chops. (I meant to sprinkle the chops with a little pepper but forgot. We didn't miss it). Since we didn't want to take the time to brown the chops, I poured about a cup of apple cider as the last ingredient on top of the veggie/fruit layer. Covered it with foil and baked for 1 hr in a stone ware 9x13 baker and enjoyed.  Our chops were bone in and about 1/2 thick.  The only thing we will change next time is to use thicker chops.

Scrumptious!  I put layers of brown sugar and cinnamon and left out the large amount of pepper.  That just didn't sound like it would blend in well.  Great Fall dish!

I didn't have a lot of time so I read through all the reviews and used the following suggestions - I microwaved the sweet potatoes for a few minutes and then did the apples separately.  I browned the pork and set aside and then browned the onions.  I layered them all in a dutch oven pot and then I whisked brown sugar with balsamic and maple syrup and poured all over the top - covered and baked for about 40 minutes.  
I also did a veggie version - substituting tofu (I browned it just like the pork) and following all the same steps.  Both were delicious!

Yes, we tried the recipe, followed it to the letter and the dinner was delicious.  We cooked it for 1 hr 15 mins, perfect, the chops were moist and the fruit and vegetables well cooked.  I would recommend this recipe as a great change for pork chops.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe. I followed CookinNurse suggestion to cook this dish in the slow cooker.  The vegetables, fruit and meat were so tender. I would add more salt to the meat next time.

I have made this twice now - once for myself and the second time for my family both times it turned out great.  I did slice the apples and sweet potatoes thicker the second time and they were not as mushy.  I think with a little flour the broth would make a nice gravy.

I'm still getting used to "sweet" dinners, and I'd eat this again and again! Based on others' recommendations, we cooked a little longer for the potatoes, but I think it was a little too long for the pork - so I might recommend slightly pre-cooking the potatoes.  We opted to chop all onions, apples, and potatoes, which I think I would prefer to layering big onion rings. We also used yellow onions, which I think provided the perfect balance.  White onions may have been too strong.

This is just like another recipe on here, but the other recipe is in a slow cooker and has sauerkraut with caraway seeds.  If you are feeling too lazy to core apples, try using a can of apple pie filling instead.  I think this recipe (and the very similar slow cooker recipe) works best with boneless pork chops or pork tenderloin.  I didn't like it as much with a pork shoulder roast.  But overall, very good recipe. Everyone I know loves it.

I made this exactly as written.  I used bone in chops and only one sweet potato because it was large, but 2 apples and 2 onions.  This was a great one pot dish and I think I would make it again with some adjustments.  I thought it could have used a little more spice.  It was a little heavy on the pepper as written, but I adjusted for our taste.  I think next time I might add a little bit more of the brown sugar and maybe a touch of maple syrup being careful not to make it to sweet.  My chops and potatoes were completely done in the hour time frame and the chops were pretty moist and tender which was a bonus for us.  Thanks Ashbeth for the recipe I'm sure I will make this again.

This was soooo tasty!!  I didnt have pork chops so I used chicken breasts instead and it was still really good.  I only used 1tsp of pepper.  There was a ton of juice left in the bottom of the dish. No need for water with the chicken.

WOW! This was DELICIOUS! This is definitely one of my new favorites. After reading the reviews, I made just a few changes. Before placing the pork loins in the dish, I put about a 1/4 cup of water in the bottom to make sure they didn't dry out. I added garlic salt to the pork loins, and sprinkled cinnamon on top of all the ingredients before putting in the oven. I didn't see that the apples were supposed to be cut in rounds until I had already cut them all into slices. This worked just fine. I cooked this is glass cookware and used aluminum foil with holes poked in it for the cover. This was so easy and came out so great! I will make it again and again. Next time I will try it in a slow cooker!

I wasn't such a fan of the onion in this recipe so I ended up  just pushing the onion to the side. The rest of the tastes were great! I ended up cooking my pork chops in a 9 x 13 glass dish since I don't have any oven-safe pans. I put about 1/4 cup water in the dish, seasoned the chops with a little salt & pepper and placed them in the dish. Then in a bowl I put the onion, apple, and sweet potatoes (I used canned, drained) in a bowl and added the brown sugar and a little cinnamon. I then put the apple mixture over the chops and covered the dish with some foil and baked in a 375 oven for 45 minutes. The consistency of everything came out perfect! I would definitely make this again (minus the onion). Good meal for a rainy day or cool Fall evening.

I liked this. The flavor of the onion, sweet potato and apple was really good. The apples were a little mushy for me so next time I might add them later so they'll be a little firmer. I added much less pepper. I'd like to try this in the crock pot. Really good one pot meal.

I actually didn't try this, but I made it for my husband when I was out one night and he said, "eh." Nothing to write home about, apparently. I was bummed because it sounded healthy. I think it needed more spices to it.

Very good but the pork chops were a little dry.  Next time I will brine them first.  Great combination of flavors and add a salad and you have a complete meal.

This receipe was fantastic.  I fixed it last night with fried yellow potatoes and it was a big hit.  My husband has high bp so I have to go easy on the salt,  so added some italian spices and the flavor just popped out.

I did not like the onions, and won't add them next time. Since I like using a clay cooker, I would not slice the potatoes but chunk them up.  I was disappointed with the apples, because they turned into apple mush.  I'd also brown the chops before baking, so as to cut down on the time needed to get the chops cooked properly.  Yeah, I'll make it again with these additions to see if I can make it turn out better.

Not good at all. The onions (I only used one) and the sweet potatoes were not cooked enough. They were thinly sliced and I nuked the potatoes a little before cooking. I baked it for 1 hr plus. My husband hated it. We ate the pork and that was it.

I wasn't sure how the onion would go with the sweet potatoes and apples, but the flavors combine beautifully.  I did however, cut back to just one onion.  I think if you just salt and pepper the pork chops as you normally would and omit the pepper on top of the casserole you will have enough seasoning. I had to leave my casserole unattended for about an hour and a half, so I cut the oven temperature back to 350.  The apples were a little overdone, but I can't fault the recipe for that.  This is a great fall flavor combo and I'm looking forward to having it again when I don't have to fool with the time and temperature.

My family loved the combination of flavors this had. I didn't add the pepper and salt on the top and that was fine. The pork was a bit dry, so next time I'd try cooking it in a Dutch Oven or a crockpot. I did have to turn the sweet potatoes frequently so it didn't dry out. I'd definitely make it again.

This recipe was ok, I didnt like the taste the apples left on the sweet potatoes.  The pork chops were good but if I made this again I would cook the sweet potatoes seperate.

This was great.  I made it just for my 8-year-old son and me, so I cut the recipe in half.  Next time I make it, I'll make the whole recipe for leftovers the next day.  It was simple, quick and easy to prepare.  Then I just put it in the oven, set the timer for an hour, and it was ready...  a complete and healthy meal.  The pork chops were tender, even though they were rather thin.  I was a little heavy-handed with the brown sugar, and some of the pieces of cooked apples and sweet potatoes were a bit gooey/chewey...  in a really good way!  Also, I added half of the ground pepper the recipe called for, in the form of freshly ground mixed peppercorns.  I will make this again!

Just didn't do it for me. There was too much stuff to not enough meat (and I'm not a real meat lover). It sounded good, but didn't turn out well at all. 

My hubby didn't mind it, though, so maybe it's just me.

My husband and I loved it. I used pork chops pre-baked in the oven. I cooked cubed sweet potatoes covered in the microwave for 9 minutes with a few tablespoons of water. While they were cooking I browned the onions added the apples cooked until nearly tender. While they were cooking I add Tony Chaucer's creole seasoning to taste(probably about 2 tsp) and about six turns of the pepper grinder. Once the onions were somewhat tender I added some water and reduce to a simmer. By this time the sweet potatoes were nearly done I mixed them in with the onion apple mixture increase the heat briefly added the brown sugar and little more water. I sprinkled a little more Tony Chaucer's as I stirred after about 4 minutes. During this process I added few tablespoons of a sweet white wine. I removed most of the mixure from the skillet I left the liquid along alot of onions and a small amount of sweet potatoes and apples. I did this to avoid making the mix mushy while the pork chops were heating.  My pre-cooked pork chops were cold so I heated them in this mixture. Once warmed I added the rest of the mixture back in the skillet.  I reduced the heat to a simmer and covered. They simmered about 6-8 minutes. We really loved it! If you worry about spicyness. There was just enough sweet/spicyness once it was done. My husband is sensitive to spicy food and felt it was just the right balance. Be sure to leave out the the salt if you use the Tony Chaucher's creole seasoning.

I modified this recipe quite a bit for my daycare kids, but they lOVED it! I omitted the onions first. Then I cooked the whole thing on the stove in a fry pan with a tiny bit of oil. I cut the potatos paper thin, the apples paper thin and put them in  with the pork chops in the fry pan. I then covered it.  I let it simmer awhile, then I sprinkled pumpkin pie spice  over it all and added about 1/4 cup white sugar (out of brown LOL). When the pork was done, I took it out and cut it into chunks (kept it warm on a covered plate) and added about 1 cup of chicken broth to the potato apple mixture along  with some flour to make a gravy.  The kids LOVED it! A great idea!  I think it would also all be good over brown rice :)  It's MUCH faster on the stove, the whole thing was done in less than 1/2 hour. :)

Sorry, but I thought the chops were too dry.  I liked the flavor of the onion, apple, potato mix but the meat just wasn't that good.  I might try it again with pork tenderloin, but not pork chops.

This was a very tasty dish and easy to prepare!  I used a cast iron skillet (in the oven) to cook with sliced the sweet potatoes no more than 1/4 inch thick.  I also reduced the pepper to 1 tsp instead of two and lightly sprayed the top (before baking) with a little butter.  Excellent recipe & will definately make again!

To me it wasn't a 5-star recipe, but it was very good indeed.  I was surprised that my children were eager try pork chops this way, but they were willing.  I used tart apples, and after sprinkling the brown sugar, I followed others' suggestions for adding cinnamon and nutmeg... and I even sprinkled a small amount of allspice.  The end result was such a soothing winter-warming meal that didn't leave you feeling weighted down afterwards.  The sweet potatoes came out resembling the taste of sweetened or glazed carrots.  The chops I used were very thick and created excess juices, but that was ok.  I made yellow saffron rice as a side and it went perfect with the whole dish.

This dish was good.  I did not put the sweet potatoes on top, instead I made the Thanksgiving Sweet Potato recipe from this website, to go with the dish.  The apples and onions were a great touch to the pork chops.  I'll definitely make this again.

made this for two.  I came home later than expected one night and found what I had planned to be 2 pork chops for dinner turned into only one.The ingredients and flavors were exactly what I was looking for!!! I had one very large boneless sirloin chop and one very large sweet potato. Cut them both into 1/2 inch chunks. I mixed salt and pepper togethr and tossedthe pork cubes in it. Sauteed the onion(reached a little carmelizing point) and potatoes (browned outside, but not done) and pork (patially browned), tossed in the apples  to saute quickly. Topped with the brown sugar. Put it all in the oven for 1/2 hour. It was great!!! Served it with steamed brocolli.  Nice colors and flavors!!

Made this for my family when they were in town.  I adapted the recipe a bit...used tart green apples, and baby red potatoes instead of sweet potatoes (we don't like sweet potatoes) and also no brown sugar (Put on a cinnamon, nutmeg, maple sprinkle I use for desserts with a smaller amount of sugar. It cut down on the sugar and made it healther).  I found that the cinnamon/nutmeg mixture went well with the potatoes and onions, and it cut down on the sweetness and brought out the flavor of the meat. The rings of onion and green apples made it aesthetically pleasing...would do it again.

This turned out SUPER!! I used MacIntosh apples, and only half of the pepper; I also drained out the watery fat halfway through baking. Oh, and I used regular potatoes since that's what I had.. this was AWESOME!! The meat was so tender and tasty, and the apples and onions blended rather nicely... This is *so* easy and good this will be in my "easy weeknight favorites" rotation!!

I love this combination of flavours. I try to drain off some of the liquid a couple times during the baking, because I find that when pork chops simmer in juice, they get a bit tough. But the onion, sweet potato, and apple topping was just perfect, and it was so easy to throw together!

I was VERY pleased with this recipe.  In fact, I just joined Allrecipes so that I could write this review.  The only problem I found was that there was entirely TOO MUCH pepper.  I mean, my boyfriend and I LOVE pepper on just about everything but this was simply overpowering.  Next time (and there will be a next time!) I'll be sure to cut it in half, at least.  Otherwise, the pork chops were super tender and the veggies made a great side dish.  I served with corn bread per another reviewer's suggestion and it was a healthy and tasty hit.  Thanks Ashbeth!

Yum!  I used thin sliced pork chops (8 of them) and as suggested sliced the sweet potatoes super thin so the cook time was around 50 minutes.  I had some Braeburns lying around so I busted out the trusty apple corer and ended up with nice wedges that cooked up just right.  And the extra brown sugar/cinnamon was a great touch!  I'll be making this again.

There is not one thing we didn't like about this recipe!!  I made it with a tenderloin and the flavors were perfect for each other.  I made sure that I followed the advice of the other reviewers by slicing the sweet potatoes thin and they were super tender.  It got rave reviews from all around!  We definitely have found a new family favorite.

I made this recipe with pork sausage instead of pork chops.I used real maple syrup instead of brown sugar and not as much salt because of the sausage. Like some of the other cooks I added a nice sprinkling of cinnamon. It was the perfect meal for a cool fall evening served with corn bread and butter.My family loved it. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is easy and good!  My husband and I both enjoyed it - the girls liked parts of it, but you know how kids are - I imagine they will like different parts next time :)  I revised the recipe to make it ( In my opinion ) fit into Stage Two of the South Beach Diet.  The sweet potatoes are a "good carb", I think that apples are ok in moderation, and I just left the brown sugar out entirely.  There are probably other spices I could have added since I took that out but I didn't have time  and it was good with just the salt and pepper.  Great!

We enjoyed this recipe. The combination of apples, onions and sweet potatoes I can even see going on their own as a side dish!

This was awesome. My boyfriend has never wanted pork chops - until now. The chops were a bit dry, but that's my fault. Please remember to cover the dish!! I think next time I'll sear the chops before I put them in. The potatoes were perfect. I even threw in some button mushrooms after 45 minutes. Yum!

We liked this recipe and will be using it again.  The chops were moist and tasty, loved this combination of fruits and vegetables. I did add about 1/2 cup of spiced apple cider just because I like the flavor.

I gave this recipe five stars after my husband told me "this is a winner." I followed the advice of one review by replacing the 1/2 cup of water with apple cider. I placed the apple cider and spices along with the sliced sweet potatoes and apples in a bowl to mix well. I also dredged the chops in flour and browned in a skillet before placing in the oven. The chops were so tender and tasty. I will definitely keep this recipe in my favorites.

Easy to make, good for leftovers.  The video showed adding 1/2 a cup of water to keep the pork chops from drying out while the written recipe does not include the water. I added the water which worked well.  Rather than bake in a skillet, I used a regular baking dish and it worked fine.

I followed another reviewers suggestion about cooking sweet potatoes in microwave for 2 min... good idea.  I also followed another suggestion about whisking together some balsamic, mustard, brown sugar and I added a little bit of chick broth. Poured over casserole, covered and baked... yum!  Would make again but would season the sweet potatoes with S &P and rosemary before combining in pan.

The recipe and taste were definitely 5 star, but my pork chops were not very tender.  I intend to try again and either use pork tenderloin or pork roast.  My only change was some not to be  named person ate the apples, so I used one just slightly under ripe pear. And I cut back proportionately for just two.   Delish!

Anytime I can combine simple ingredients and pop it in the oven, it's a winner for me! I substituted sweet potatoes for new white potatoes, but other than that, followed the recipe. Great dish, easy & quick to prepare.

I made this twice, as the first time when I shopped the apples got left behind at the supermarket. Both times the boneless pork chops were overcooked and dry. I tried reducing the cooking time by 5 minutes the second time and the sweet potatoes weren't done and the chops were still overcooked. I think it's a good idea for a recipe, but you need to preheat or partially cook the sweet potatoes or get tick cut pork chops or something. I'll update my review if I can fine tune the cooking time/instructions for better results.

Did not care for the flavors in this recipe. I made as directed and agree with some of the other reviews about the onions not being compatible with the other ingredients. I cooked my pork chops only 35 minutes and they were a little overdone.

This was delicious.  I  used  2 chops.  In my Dutch oven I pre browned the seasoned pork chops (onion, garlic powder, salt n pepper),  removed them from the pot. I layered the sweet potatoes,  onions and apples.  Seasoned them brown sugar,  salt n pepper. Added the chops and layered the remaining  sweet potatoes, onions and apples. Added about 1/2 cup water. Cover with lid and baked at 375Â°F for 1 hour. Potatoes were too soft.
Next time I will bake the pork chops for a half hour, then remove them from the Dutch oven and follow the procedure that I did above.  Definitely will be a 5 star then
Note: Dutch ovens heat evenly and hold the heat therefore cooking a bit more quickly.

Not a winner.  Pork chops were dry and sweet potato wasn't fully cooked, even though it was sliced to 1/4" thickness.  Onions were also undercooked after an hour and meat was already overcooked.  Liked the apples though!
Won't make it again.

Sweet potatoes, apples and onions tasted great.  I made recipe as directed except added 1/2 cup water.  The pork loins were tasteless and over cooked.

A nice early autumn meal!   A great base recipe.  Can be spiced up to suit different tastes.  I browned the chops in olive oil in the cast iron skillet prior to adding the rest of the ingredients.  Also sprinkled cinnamon on top and dotted with a little butter.  Covered with foil and cooked in the Breville Smart Oven Air, using convection, at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  Delicious!

Very simple and easy .  It came out great!  Next time I may add a little tumeric or cumin to kick up the flavor a bit but that is my taste.  I used Ambrosia apples and Vidalia onions.  It made a tasty combination.

It smelled delicious. It was too sweet for me. If I make again I will reduce brown sugar to 1 tablespoon.  Pork chop was tender and great pairing with sweet potato.

This was very simple and easy to make.  I layered the porkchops, thinly sliced sweet potato, onion, then apple into a cast iron skillet then walked away to let it cook.  I gave this 4 stars based on ease of cooking.  I think I would prefer mashed sweet potatoes instead, though.

Next time I will cook in the slow cooker. I did wait until the last 30 minutes to add the apples.  I was afraid they would be mushy. Pork chops were tender and flavorful.  The video said add half cup water but the writer recipe didnât mention it.  I added the water but it was to much.  I would only put maybe a third cup.

Just disappointing and awful.  I read the reviews, reduced the pepper and followed the directions, but it was terrible. Pork ended up overcooked while the potatoes  (very thinly sliced) were still raw.  Everything tasted the same, and the whole mess ended up in the trash.  I don't recommend this, and won't try it again.

It was very tasty, however,  the sweet potatos and apples were to soft.  I needed to cut the slices thicker - and I would use just one onion - two was too much and they were Texas size too! 

I will definately make again - it's worth perfecting. Very easy!

Was so tasty! Followed the suggestion of a few reviews and only did a tsp of pepper on the apples, sweet potatoes, and onions. Also, I cut the onions and sweet potatoes very thin so that they would cook in an hour. I mixed all of the toppings in a large bowl with the brown sugar, salt, and pepper, and mixed it all together before topping the pork chops.

Did it exactly as recipe, except my husband does not like sweet potatoes cooked this way, so I used half sweet potatoes for me and half regular potatoes for him.  ;-) We really enjoyed this meal!

Too much pepper so season according to taste. Can take a bit more than usual as the apples are sweet.

Use apple juice or apple cider instead of the water. Thicken after cooking to make a apple cider sauce.

These were very different ingredients that I have ever put together but so worth it.
I didn't change a thing and will make this recipe again. My husband loved it as well and he'll take the next shift when making it again.

Thank you for submitting such a tasty recipe.

I used my dutch oven which I love. First browned my chops and steamed the sweet potatoes a bit to soften them up. I used McCormick's Garlic and herb instead of the black pepper. I also poured apple cider, as someone else suggested, over the mixture and cooked for 45 minutes (sufficient to cook chops).

Super easy and a great flavor combo. We only had room in the pan for one sweet potato, so we definitely needed a few sides to make a full meal.

I should have read the reviews first because I should have started the layers with the potatoes, and then the pork chops on top.  Also I would probably double the apples.  When I try it again I hope I can give it a higher rating.

Delicious combination of flavors.  I did eliminate the extra black pepper and  added a  tablespoon  or 2 of Boiled Apple  Cider which is available online at the Vermont Country Store.

We had to add another half hour because the sweet potatoes took a bit longer than expected.  Otherwise it was great.  We'll be making it again.

I have made this several times and absolutely love the combination of flavors. I have made it in the oven as well as in the slow cooker on low. I actually prefer the slow cooker because the meat just falls apart and tastes so much better.

I followed the recipe as written and found it a bit dry. The flavors were really good and the potatoes melted in the mouth.  Next time I will add some water to the pan and reduce the time by 10 to 15 mins.

This turned out wonderful,  I had to cut the ingredients in half, as only my husband and I were eating it. We did however add parsnips to the recipe. If you haven't tried this, you need to. So delicious.

I made only one change. Seasoned pork chops with a small amount of salt,pepper, and garlic combined before layering in pan. Sweet potatoes were sliced thin. My family love this dish, My great grands gave the dish a special name: G G's Special. This recipe is too simple! The flavor is awesome!

I tried to use this recipe in the slow cooker but cooked it too long. I  set things up as instructed with layers of sweet potatoes apples etc. And put the timer on low for 5 hrs. but cooked it to pieces.  Next time I will try for 4 . But other than that it was really good.

Loved that it was so easy to put together but the chops got a little overdone and tasted dry. The recipe calls for what I thought was  a lot of salt  so I cut back. It actually needed more than I used so I guess don't be shy on the salt! Potatoes, apples & onion were quite good.

I omitted onion and used onion powder instead. I also used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar. We liked it and I plan to make it again. I would think it would be even better with the brown sugar for those who use regular sugar.

I didn't change anything, but will make it again without the brown sugar.  It did nothing but make the meat sweet as well as the broth that accumulated.  I think it would be good without the sugar.  Who wants sweet port and sweet gravy...I don't think so

This recipe was delish!  My husband is not a big fan of sweet potatoes so I used baby carrots instead.  He loved it!  The only thing I will do different the next time I make it is take the cover off about 20 minutes before I take it out of the oven to allow it to brown a bit.

I will make this again but not add the amount of pepper it calls for. 2 teaspoons is way to much seasoning. All you could taste was the pepper and it ruined the favor of the rest of the food.

This was hearty and I Love the sweet and savory aspect of the dish.  I just eye balled the brown sugar, probably was a little more than called for.  I also added onion & garlic powder to the chops with the salt & pepper and fresh time, added a splash of worchester and about 1/2 cup or so beef stock.  Only thing I would do different next time is to cut the sweet potatoes and the apples into much larger pieces I was so concerned about them being soft or tender enough that I made them a little too small.  Great for the crock pot. I used 5 bone attached pork chops, center chop regular cut, not thin or extra thick.

I made as written. Would not change anything. Took suggestion of pre cooking the potatoes in the microwave for 3 minutes. Served with green beans and cucumber salad. Definitely a keeper.

The flavor of this dish was delicious, but I wasn't happy with the look and texture.  I prepared exactly as directed but reduced the amount of sweet potato & onion.  The result was VERY watery and everything was kind of the same color.  It needed slightly over an hour to really be done enough, so I would make this again but probably remove the cover for the last 15-20 minutes.

We made this for supper and seasoned the bone in pork chops with sea salt and black pepper. Sliced the Granny Smith apples, onion and sweet potatoes with brown sugar sprinkled on top in a Corning Ware dish covered with foil and baked for 1 hour. Was amazingly delicious.

Instead of using pork chops 1st time, I used 1.25 lb chuck steak (thick cut) and it was delicious.  The aroma from the meal while cooking is truly mouthwatering and the sweetness of the veggies permeated the moist tender meat. (also I used only 1 tbsp raw sugar, not 1 tbsp + 1+ teaspoon brown sugar)  I did use thick cut porterhouse pork chops for 2nd try.  They were also very good but I do PREFER  the CHUCK STEAK version.   This veggie combo would work with any sort of meat I think e.i. chicken too.

Quite tasty. Made this in slow cooker with same ingredients and meat melted off the bone. Cooked on high for 5 hours.....
Probably could have cooked it for less time as apples and sweet potatoes were a bit mushy.

After reading other reviews I cut back on the black pepper and only used a sprinkle. I made this in a casserole dish and had to bake it longer.I also added an extra apple. This made the dish a little sweeter.  My family so enjoyed this meal.

This was a good, easy one pot meal. Because sweet potatoes take longer to cook I cut those thinner than the onions and apples. The apples I actually used a corer/slicer tool, leaving them in the thick slices.  Even that way they still came out a bit mushy but still decent enough. I would definitely recommend keeping the apples sliced very thick. I canât imagine how mushy theyâd be if sliced thin. The pork chops were boneless and about 3/4 of an inch thick. I did not brown them first. It all came out beautifully. Really, the only reason itâs not 5 Stars is because of the apples being mushy but I will definitely be making this again!

I loved this recipe! Very simple to make, and very tasty, even for a kitchen disaster like me. Instead of regular sweet potatoes (which I don't like), I used purple Japanese sweet potatoes, and they were fantastic. Since they are milder than normal sweet potatoes, I think you could probably use regular russet or new potatoes and still have a great recipe, since the brown sugar already adds sweetness. My only complaint is that the apples didn't seem to add any flavor, they were barely distinguishable from the potatoes in the final product, but it didn't take away from the overall flavor.

I also don't have an oven proof skillet, so I roasted them in a 8-inch round cake pan covered in foil and had no problems there.  I halved the recipe since I only cook for myself.

I made this first time for dinner last night.  I added small bit of chopped celery and used regular potato because I was all I had on hand.  Reduced the amount of pepper and added thyme.  I desolved the sugar in a cup of white wine and poured over the top. It was delicious and my child who hates pork chops ate it all. New family favourite

This was delicious and hearty meal, just the right combination of savoury and sweet.   Other than adding a tablespoon more brown sugar,  I made it as directed.  The video differs from the recipe in that it recommends adding 1/2 cup of water to prevent the pork chops from drying out and is something I included.  The result was a moist pork chop with a bit of sauce that I spooned over my plate.  I served it with roast baby potatoes....yum!

Made this in the slow cooker using CookinNurse's recipe.  Layered everything and seasoned between layers as she did, using about 1/3 cup total brown sugar/cinnamon/nutmeg mix along with a few grinds of salt and pepper between layers.  Lightly sprinkled the (boneless) pork chops with garlic powder before laying them on the layered fruit/veg.   Poured about 2/3 of a bottle of Redd's green apple ale down the side of the crockpot at the last second before I put the lid on.  Cooked it 6 hours on high, and it was absolutely wonderful....hubby loved it!  All was fork-tender, 10 stars!

After reading other reviews, I browned the pork chops in a pan and sliced the onions and sweet potatoes very thinly. I tossed all the vegetables with salt and pepper, about I tbsp of sugar and some of the rendered fat  from the pork chops. Then laid the pork chops on top and placed in the oven at 375 for an hour. It was great.

This was really good but I made a couple changes. First, I did it all in one large fry pan on the stovetop with boneless chops. Second, I used a little bit of pureed garlic instead of onion. To me, that goes better with the sweet potatoes, apples and brown sugar. Third, I only used a small amount of pepper. Really good. I generally also make with some egg noodles to sop up the pan sauce.

I haven't made this yet, but will tomorrow. 2 teaspoons of pepper seems a little excessive. ( I know I could not eat it) Is this a mistake? I will add a half a teaspoon only. This sounds like it should be wonderful !

Works real well with, 24 hr marinated, Venison Tenderloin.  I made A LOT more and added whole baby carrots.  6 people, 4 of them hungry men, I needed more.
Enjoyable meal for all on Rainy, Cold Sat. night.

I added a little extra brown sugar, cut the apples, onions, and sweet potatoes into chunks, added a teaspoon of butter and just a pinch of cinnamon.

I browned the pork chops  to seal in juices and I admit  I was concerned about sweet potatoes and apples so I microwaved them  in Apple cider vinegar for 5 minutes.  Other than that I followed recipe.  Perfection!!

I made this pretty much as written save for the salt and pepper amounts - I put much less in, so I would say to taste would be better there. I used boneless loin chops, which I browned first in a cast dutch oven with a bit of olive oil. I put all the other ingredients on top, with a little fresh grated nutmeg.  It cooked perfectly in one hour.  Actually, so many people said it would not that we weren't ready to eat, and it held nicely on warm in the oven. This will definitely be made again and again.

Easy and good.  I used boneless pork chops and they were moist and tender.  I used 1 pkg (1 lb?) of fresh cubed butternut squash instead of sweet potatoes.  I skipped the salt and pepper.  I browned the pork chops in a pan first as recommended by someone else. I sauteed the onions in 1 Tbsp butter before adding to the baking dish.  I didn't peel the apples.  Just used an apple slicer and put in large slices.   I used a 9x13 baking dish covered with foil and cooked as directed. My pan would have held up to 5 boneless chops and wouldn't need to increase the veggies.

I also made this in my crockpot and it turned out great!  I put a layer of sweet potatoes first, then pork loin, and then the apple and onions while sprinkling a salt, pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, and chili powder mix on each layer.  I'm trying to stay paleo so I used maple syrup instead of brown sugar.  I just poured it over the pork layer after the spices.  I cooked it 6 hours on low and it turned out great!  The only drawback to using the crockpot is the presentation wasn't great but it tasted awesome!  I wouldn't have thought of this combo but everything complements well.

We loved this dinner! I read the reviews so I cut way back on the pepper - I just sprinkled it over the layered ingredients, and microwaved my sliced sweet potatoes for 2 minutes first. I also added 1/3 cup water, used a glass casserole dish and baked it at 350 degrees for an hour and a half . My husband likes his pork chops Shake 'n Baked - every time - and even he said he loved this!

I followed someone's advice and added apple cider vinegar for moistness.    BIG mistake.     Way too strong and probably not needed.     Will try again without.    Meat was great.   Worth another try.

We liked the simplicity of this recipe, but it just didn't do it for us. My husband made this recipe as is, except he ended up reducing the amount of black pepper from 2 tsp to 1 tsp. This was because he felt like it was going to be far too much pepper as he was adding it. Otherwise, the recipe was made as is. I honestly do not feel the extra 1 tsp of pepper would have made a difference as the dish, overall, would have simply tasted like pepper. I much prefer variations of caramelizing apples and onions separately and pouring over the pork chops to finish baking in the oven or to even finish cooking the chops in the pan with the applies/onions.

I took the advice of others on the site and added in some cinnamon with the brown sugar. I also omitted the salt and pepper in the cinnamon/brown sugar mixture. I sprinkled the chops with garlic powder, celery salt, and white pepper before covering them with the onion, sweet potato, apple mixture. I cooked the sweet potatoes a bit in the microwave beforehand and cut the apples into chunks, not rings. I doused the entire dish with 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar and cooked it in a casserole dish covered with aluminum foil. I served it with fresh green beans and a Romaine and goat cheese salad, and it was a huge hit! Will be making again!

I browned the chops, tossed the veggies with the brown sugar and a few sprinkles of cinnamon, added a 1/2 c water to pan when baking. It came out delicious in the perfect amount of time. The chops were slightly dry. I'll try thicker chops next time.

Delicious.  I dredged the chops in some flour seasoned with garlic powder, salt and pepper and browned them in EVOO.  I layered first the sweet potatoes in the slow cooker, seasoned with about 3 T or so of brown sugar and salt and pepper, then the chops, then the onions and apples, which I tossed in about 3 T brown sugar, salt and pepper and some additional garlic powder.  I added about a 1/4 c of water and a 1/4 c of apple cider vinegar, which I think adds a nice zip, as did the garlic powder.  Without those 2 ingredients I think it would have been too bland.  Will make again!

I also change up the recipe a bit. I omitted the 2 teaspoons of pepper.  I then mixed 1/2 cup of apple juice with 1/4 maple syrup and a tsp of yellow mustard, stirred and poured over the brown sugar.  I placed a couple of pads of butter on top, covered and baked as directed.  It was delicious!

I liked the combination of onion, Apple, pork and sweet potatoes, But I added raisins to provide a natural sweetness. And instead of a skillet I used a casserole dish and cooked 11/2 hrs. I also tenderized the chops before adding them. My husband and myself loved it.

I'm not sure why anybody wouldn't give this 5 stars.  It is so simple and absolutely delicious!  I have an apple slicer that slices the apples very thin so I added those the last half of the baking so they wouldn't turn to mush.  I found that I got busy doing other things and it ended up cooking for probably an hour and a half.  Everything was done perfectly!

I made this for my family, and we LOVED it!  I browned the pork chops in flour, and added a little water like someone else suggested. I also microwaved the sweet potatoes to soften them some before putting in the oven. It was fantastic.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing this.

It was delicious, however, I changed it somewhat, so I gave it a 4!  I browned the chops in 1 TBSP olive oil(sprinkled with sea salt, pepper, paprika and garlic powder). Buttered the bottom of an oblong glass baking dish.  Topped with sliced onion, then thinly sliced yams and sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon. Added 2 peeled, cored, length-sliced pear with a tbsp butter into each pear with a little brown sugar. Poured about a cup of Golden Sherry on top, covered with tin foil, and baked for about 1 hr 15 min.  Absolutley delicious!

I loved this. I almost always tweak the seasoning for my taste. I am not a fan of black pepper or real sweet main dishes , so I used less brown sugar and 1 T of Chachere's. This combo of fruit, veg, and meat is awesome. I will make more next time, what can I say? We like it hot! Some don't.

This is a wonderfully different way to make pork chops. My kids even enjoyed this dish. I was appreciated the tip on slicing the sweet potatoes thinner and the apples a little thicker. That worked out very well. Thank you for a great recipe.

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  Like other suggested I browned my pork chops and cooked the onions until just softened.  I also added a little additional brown sugar and sprinkled with cinnamon.  I will definitely be making this again.

The recipe is one that is good on a winter's night, but it took a while to make and bake in the oven, so make sure you have plenty of time.

I cut the onion way down & browned the chops before baking. The flavor was *okay* in my opinion. May or may not make again.

Very delicious.  The sweet potatoes were wonderful.  Be sure to cut the apples thick, or they turn into applesauce when you scoop them out.  I browned the pork loin chops, and will add more spice to them next time.  I like some of the suggestions of garlic.  The onions came out perfectly golden - carmelized really.  I might make this as a side dish without the pork next time.

I LOVED this meal!!  I will definatley add it into my weekly rotation.  It is easy to make and is delicious.  The only thing I would change next time is to put less pepper it.  It was a little to spicy for my child, even though I liked it.

I did not like the way this turned out!  After 6 hours of cooking, everything was not cokked through and the sweet potatoes and apples were still hard and crunchy.  The flavors did not blend well either.  I will not make this one again.

Definitly delicious, but the recipe needs to be adjusted to the size of the chops. For four chops there is way too much extra on top. Baking time should also be adjusted. Keep your eyes on the yams, once they're done, so is the rest of the recipe. But, as I said definitly delicious!

I added some extra salt, pepper and brown sugar...the veggies turned out tasty but the meat (which was on the bottom) was still a bit flavorless.  Next time I might try putting a layer of onion under the meat in hopes the meat will soak up some of the flavor.

This recipe is simple and very good!  To make it healthier, I added some carrots and used 2 tbl. Splenda and 1 tbl. of brown sugar.  I also sprinkled cinnamon over everything.  Cooking it for 1hr 15 min made everything a little too mushy.  I think it depends on how small you cut everything up.

This dish was really disappointing.  The aroma when it is cooking raises your expecations for excellent flavor - but it turned out to be extrememly bland.  I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a boring flavor and dry pork.  I will not make this again.

I followed this recipe exactly, except for adding a little more brown sugar. It was pretty much tasteless... the chops absorbed a bit of the flavour, but it just tasted like apples. Everything baked perfectly, the onions, apples, chops and potatoes were all tender, but there was about an inch of watery apple/fat on the bottom of the dish. We were all pretty let down, because it smelled delicious. We give it two stars because it was edible.
