I followed this recipe exactly.  The filling wouldn't stick together and I had a very large bowl full of the filling, but it wouldn't spread or stick together.   It was awful !

This was a very nice cake that my family enjoyed. However, they found that the frosting wasn't right for the cake. Instead, I used my grandmother's butter cream frosting, which added an extra richness. I also added a bit more nuts, which complimented the butter cream frosting. A definate keeper, though!
