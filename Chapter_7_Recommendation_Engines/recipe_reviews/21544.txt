I use a frozen deep dish pie crust.  Flash bake it for 10 minutes at 350. Add an additional egg and use 1  cup half and half. Sauteed a minced clove of garlic with the onion.  Add salt, pepper and a little thyme.  8 slices bacon. I've tried it with Swiss and Cheddar and both are good.  Cook at 350 until set and a little brown and knife comes out clean.  Fanstastic!!  Reheats really well too.

The filling for this recipe is delicious.  However, 450 degrees is way too high a temperature in which to pre-bake the crust.  The edges burn.  The second time I made this recipe, I pre-baked the crust at 350 degrees and had a much better result.

I love this recipe and made a large batch to sell in my church's coffee shop. I followed this recipe, for the most part,with the exception of increasing the eggs to 6 and adding another 1/2 cup of milk. I used a combination of 1 lb sage Jimmy Dean Sausage and 4 slices crumbled bacon. I also added a light sprinkling of Garlic salt along with the 1/4 tsp. salt and I used 2 cups of mild cheddar and some left over colby/cheddar mix. I did toss the cheese in 1 TBS flour.I used a large 9x12 commercial pan and used the "No Roll Pie Crust II" from this site, doubling the dough to fit the pan. This was the first item sold out at the coffee shop and I only made one pan. I have made this Quiche as stated with outstanding results. This is also a good recipe to add your own goodies and flair! I prepared it the night before, pre-baked the pie crust at 450 for 8 minutes, poured in the mixture and then refrigerated until morning. With the oven at 350 I baked it for 35 minutes then I topped off with more cheese and crumbled bacon for 5 minutes. It was perfect! Try different cheeses and do not be afraid to experiment. This recipe is foolproof.

I used a pre-made crust, used 4 eggs and only 1 cup half and half, and used cheddar because I didn't have swiss. I upped the temperature to 375, as other people had suggested, and it cooked in about 45 minutes. It was great! Everybody loved it. I would recommend putting the pie plate on a cookie sheet when you put it in the oven so if it overflows a little the mess is easier to clean up.

Great recipe... but if you are using a frozen crust already in a pie pan, make sure you get the deep dish crust.  This recipe made WAY too much filling for a average size crust.  Yummy quiche though!

Wonderful recipe.  I, too, made suggested moderations of using more bacon, 4 eggs, and instead of milk, I used 1 1/4 cups of half and half.  It came out perfect.  This was the first quiche I have made and it won rave reviews from the family.

I made 2 different quiche's from this recipe: one bacon and cheese and the other was a spinach and mushroom (and cheese). I didn't use swiss cheese, i used colby jack (for both) and instead of using 3 eggs, I used 5. I also used skim milk. I cooked the bacon first and then set aside the bacon grease; used some of it to cook the onions and then the spinach and mushroom as well- that really adds a great flavor to it! i took it to a baby shower and it got rave reviews! Will definitely make again!

This was so YUMMY - a big hit at my Mother's Day brunch. I made alterations based on other commentors. I added 4 eggs, used 1 1/4 half and half, and 8 slices of bacon (love bacon!) and used a Vidalia onion which added a slightly sweet flavor to the quiche. Next time I'll go back to 3 eggs and use 1 cup of half and half because it was too much for my 9-inch store-bought pie crust. Can't wait to make this one again!!!

Excellent!  Impressive and pretty darn easy to make!  At 325, though, 40 minutes was NOT enough time baking.  I increased temp to 350 after the 40, then 375 cuz i couldn't wait anymore... about 1hr15min baking time for it to set.  So next time, I'll start at 350.  Delicious!  Thanks Lynn!

Very easy recipe to follow. After reading a couple of reviews, I made a few changes:baked the pastry at 350 degrees F, 4 eggs & 1 cup of milk & 2 cups of cheese - 1 cup old cheddar plus 1 cup of aged gruyere. Would make again.

I am rating this 5 stars based on my family.  I made it and had to go to work. My kids are picky so I new I'd have some when I got home.  Unfortunately for me it was gobbled up immediately. It must have been good!

Great recipe. Classic Quiche Lorraine is even simpler -- no cheese, no onion. Just bacon in the custard, pepper, salt, and nutmeg or mace.   But what makes Quiche so handy is the scope for improvisation: use grated or shredded Gruyere, Swiss, Parmesan, Romano, Cheddar, Provolone... substitute ham for the bacon, or pepperoni, or sausage; make it lean (lowfat milk) or decadent (heavy cream) or in-between (whole milk or half-and-half): it always seems to be in  the ratio of one egg to a half cup liquid. Use onions, leeks,  shallots, scallions, chives. Prebake the crusts first brushing with a glaze (one yolk, a teaspoon water,  & a half teaspoon
powdered chicken bouillon. Remember to have a cookie sheet on the rack below... believe me! Serve with a nice white wine... a Chardonnay or Gewuertztraminer, depending on ingredients. Although the classic simple S&P and nutmeg/mace is always great, you could also add savory, sage, basil,
marjoram, chervil or finely minced celery leaves.  Chopped cooked spinach is excellent, as are broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes (peeled, seeded & dejuiced), peppers, mushrooms (shiitakes, porcini, chanterelles, oyster mushrooms -- especially prepared as Duxelles), even olives. And in place of ham, bacon or sausage one can use crabmeat, shrimp, lobster meat... In short, one is limited only by imagination, availability of ingredients, and one's budget.

Excellent. Used 4 eggs and 1 cup half and half. Upped bacon to 8 pieces. Also prebaked frozen crust for 10 min at 350 and baked quiche for 50 min at 375. Would definitely make again.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did take advice from several of the reviews and made some alterations. I used 1 1/4 cups milk and 4 eggs. I also added a clove of garlic with the onion, and baked it a 375 degrees for 35 minutes. When I combined the eggs and milk, I whipped them together well with a whisk. The quiche set up nicely.

I have been making this quiche recipe for several years now.  I usually buy a good deep dish pie crust instead of making my own, and it tastes absolutely wonderful.  About a year ago I started using egg substitute to cut down on the calories, and my husband and kids couldn't tell the difference.  I usually make two at a time and it is always gone fast!

This recipe was really easy to follow, and I was extremely pleased with the way it came out.  After reading some helpful tips, I made a few alterations.
I flash baked the deep dish pie crust for 10 minutes at 350, added an egg, and used a little less than a cup and a half of whole milk.
I caramelized the onions in a little bacon grease, which tasted delicious but got a little greasier than I like.  Next time, I think I'll put them on a paper towel before I put them in the filling.
Baked at 325 for close to 50 minutes, until it was nice and brown.
It set up really well, and warmed up even better the next day.  I will Definitely make this again.

Very good recipe.  It's a good recipe that lends itself to experimenting with different types of cheeses.  I've done the recipe as is and it came out good.  Best quiche I came out with is using this recipe and using gruyere cheese which took this way off the charts!

I used eggs the first time I made this dish and Egg-beaters the next (both times I cut down the milk and added an extra egg).  This came out great with the egg-beaters; I did not notice a difference.  I used mushrooms, red onions, spinach, and smoked salmon.  This is very impressive for guests or a pot luck.

I was looking for something similar to the quiche lorraine I used to make a couple of years ago and this was it :)  Even my boyfriend liked it, and he wasn't into the quiche idea.  The only thing I added was a pinch of nutmeg into the egg mixture!

SO GOOD!  Did what everyone suggested - 1 cup milk and 4 eggs.  The flavors meld beautifully, texture is rich without being overly eggy.  This was quick and easy enough for a mid week meal.  Use Pie Crust IV from this site.  It's just as easy as this quiche and comes together in about 10 mins.

Loved this quiche!  I used turkey bacon and it was very tasty.  I followed previous reviewers advice and used 4 eggs and 1 cup milk. I bought a pre-made Pillsbury deep dish crust and the filling fit perfectly.  Very yummy, dh and I enjoyed it for Easter lunch.

Really good! Next time I will use several different kinds of cheese. I thought it was too much milk so I will use 4 eggs & a little bit less milk next time. Thanks so much for sharing!

This was easy to make and tastes great. I doubled the recipe, and had too much filling for two crusts - used the leftovers to make crustless "quichlettes" by pouring them into a sprayed muffin tin. They came out great! Will be good for lunches, or could all be made that way for individual servings at a party!

Excellent recipe although I lowered the blind bake to 425°.  450° is a bit high for that I think.  350° as someone mentioned is way too low for a blind bake but is what you would bake the pie at after the pie shell has been filled.  At 350° you'll have one tough pie shell once it is finally cooked enough to fill it.

Have made this several times and it always turns out perfect.  I have followed recipe exactly and, sometimes I use up half n'half with skim milk and I have never had it turn out badly.  Gotta fess up that I do use a store bought roll-out pie crust, mostly b/c I don't want to make the crust from scratch but I have used scratch crust too with mostly the same results.  This is a good basic recipe...TY =)

This tasted great and had the consistency I like in quiche.  I made it without a crust, and  I used 3/4 cup whipping cream and 3/4 cup 1% milk, but otherwise made as directed.  My only beef is it took a lot longer than 40 minutes to cook.  Mine took 1 hour 10 minutes at 325 degrees.

This is a great foundation for a good quiche. You can make adjustments to taste. I should warn that this is definitely a DEEP dish recipe. I used store bought deep dish crusts and still had too much filling. For alternative options you can try mozerella, cheddar, feta, or a combination or cheeses, 1/2 tsp thyme and or basil, sausage, ham, 1 cup frozen thawed spinach, 1/2 c. chopped mushrooms, etc. The options are endless. Also, I should add that I prebaked the crust at 350 for 10 minutes and then for two quiches to set it took closer to 50 mintues at 350. Happy Baking!

Like other reviewers, I also found that this quiche took far longer to bake than the recipe stated. I think mine ended up somewhere around 1 hour and 10 minutes and it still wasn't set quite as well as I would have liked. (We took it out due to impatience. It smelled so good!) Even slightly underdone, it was so delicious that I know I will give it another try. Next time I will bake at 375, add an additional egg, and reduce the milk as others have suggested. (I also had the problem of too much filling and too little pie crust, resulting in some spillage. For this, however, I blame the so-called "deep dish" crust I used, not this recipe.)

This recipe works generally well and is quite tasty.  I used a frozen deep dish pie crust, poked holes with a fork in the crust 1/2" apart (which prevents it from over rising), and skipped the foil step -- turned out beautifully.  For the filling, I substituted 6 pieces of ham deli meat for bacon and added mushrooms, spinach, basil, and parsley.   I only used 1 cup of shredded swiss, 1 cup of milk, 2/3 tbsp of flour, and no salt.  In the future, I would probably reduce the milk even further so that the filling is less watery. I did not cover the crust with foil for the first 40 minutes of baking, as I like my crust to be browner.  I started baking the quiche at 365 degrees for 40 minutes and, when it still didn't set, I increased the temperature to 375 for another 8 minutes.  Note: This recipe does make too much filling even after reducing the milk and cheese amounts... I would probably cut everything to 2/3 cup in the future and reduce to 2 eggs.  Overall, a really tasty recipe!  I would make it again!

This is really delish!  I didn't have Swiss cheese so I used a hunk of smoked gouda and it complemented the smokey bacon very nicely.  Also, instead of chopping the onion, I ran it against a box grater and then sauteed it in the leftover bacon grease.  The onion flavor was throughout the whole quiche but wasn't overbearing.  So yummmmy!

Easy and delicious! This is the first time I've made quiche and was crossing my fingers that it would turn out, and my family would like it because what a fun addition to our meal menus. Of six children, all had seconds except for the 6 year old twins. The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars was the crust was a bit soggy. Maybe the onions need to be cooked down more? Maybe skim milk isn't the way to go? Maybe the crust needs to be prebaked longer? Not sure, but I will be experimenting to see if I can find the solution. Also, I based on other reviews, I did increase the baking temp to 350* and they were done in about 50 minutes. Other than those minor issues, a VERY tasty dish that I will be making again.

This is a great base quiche to expand upon - we left out the cheese and added some fresh spinach to make a lighter (albeit totally inauthentic) version that even non-quiche lovers enjoyed.

My first time making a quiche and boy it was FANTASTIC!  I did end up leaving it in my oven for about 65-75 mins until I thought it was done.  I also didn't end up using all the liquid because it would of over flowed over the crust.  Other than that, EVERYONE LOVE IT!

Tasty.  I made this last minute and I didn't have a crust so I just made it as a casserole without the crust and it was great.  I added a little nutmeg and some thinly sliced tomatoes and bell peppers on top.  It did take a little longer to cook.  Husband ate it up.

make sure to make all of the changes that others have made - this was simple and VERY good.

this overfills the pan so make sure to have a tray underneath so that you don't end up with a mess.

I used a frozen pie crust that was already in a tin and it tasted great.

I make some small adjustments but this recipe is excellent with my husband asking for it when we have overnight guests. I do use 4 eggs rather than 3 and instead of mild I use half and half. I have made this several times with wonderful presentation and flavor.

My boyfriend and I really liked this recipe. I used a pre-made pastry crust, 4 eggs, 1 1/4 cups milk, added a large clove of garlic and used turkey bacon rather that regular. I also sauteed the onions and garlic in regular margarine. It came out great!

I made this today as part of our Easter Breakfast, unfortnitly I didn't realize that no one else likes quiche.  Needliess to say I was the only one who enjoyed this.  I did as others suggested and used a premade pie crust, the 4 eggs, 1 cup half&half, and baked at 375 for about 35 minutes.  It set up very well.  I bought a deep dish pie pan for this, but I wasn't needed, a regular pie pan would have worked just fine.  I used chopped ham in place of bacon, cheddar & mozzerella cheese, instead of an onion I used dried minced onion, dash of garlic salt omitting the regular salt, and a bit of dried rosemary & italian seasoning.  Next time I'll be adding some fresh veggies.  Thanks for the gr8 recipe.

Awesome! I used only 1cup of milk and substituted left over ham for bacon, 1cup 5 year old white cheddar plus 1/2 cup mozzerella for the swiss cheese. Baked in a tart pan and the amount of fillling was perfect.

So good!  I accidentally used half and half because I was making another quiche that called for that ,and it of course turned out great. It just might be worth the calories!  I also added a hint of cayenne pepper! Great recipe!

This was my first Quiche and it turned out fantastic. I made a few changes. Instead of bacon I did an italian chicken sausage diced (Adelle's or similar brand) I also used Mozzaralla cheese and some cheddar, because I didn't have Swiss on hand. I only put 1/2 an onion. Mine didn't overflow like many reviews said, but after baking it at 350 for 35 minutes it needed much more time, so I upped the temp to 375 and baked it for another 30 approx. minutes. Basically until it stopped giggling in the center and a knife came out clean. Delicious! My Mother's Day Brunch crowd really enjoyed it.

A nice basic quiche recipe which would no doubt work well as written, but like others, I followed suggestions to use four eggs and a cup of half and half instead of the milk.  Also,  I chopped and fried up turkey smoked sausage in lieu of bacon and also added in a three or four good shakes of italian herb seasoning. I would say next time I will go with 2 cups of swiss cheese as well. I went with the frozen pie crust and prebaked it by package instructions, taking care to cover the edge with tin foil before baking and while baking the quiche itself. I went with 350 for the baking, but I will say that ovens vary, so I like to start checking the pie at least 10 minutes before it is supposed to finish and go by appearance.  Really, this is one of those recipes that can be changed in many little ways and still work out well, but do consider adding the herb seasoning if you have some. They go very well with eggs.

This was so delicious!  Next time I will try adding some veggies to go along with the bacon.  I did use five eggs instead of three, otherwise I didn't change anything.  Yum!

Good quiche recipe. The crust stuck to the glass pie pan when serving so I would recommend greasing and flouring the pan before baking the shell. I used 8 slices bacon, 4 eggs and half & Half instead of milk.

I love this quiche!  I use colby/chedder mix instead of swiss, just because that's what I had in the fridge.  I also add chives and, of course, more bacon than it calls for.  Great basis quiche recipe that you can change up to suit your needs -- never fails!

Very nice quiche!  As suggested, I used 4 eggs and only 1 cup of "liquid".  I used half and half in one and milk in the other.  Really couldn't taste a difference.  I made one with swiss cheese and the other with a mix of cheddar and mozarella.  That mixed cheese quiche was more popular, although I liked them both.  Since there aren't a lot of ingredients in the quiche itself, I think it's nice to have a strong cheese flavor.  Very easy and sure to impress!

A very good basic recipe. I didn't have enough milk, so I just added an extra egg. I also added chopped ham to make it a Quiche Loraine. The cooking temperature was too high and my crusts burnt, so like the other reviewers, I'd recommend reducing the temperature according to your oven's settings. My boyfriend slowly reheated it a second time in the oven and it was just as delicious, but when I took the leftovers to work and reheated it a 3rd time in the microwave it was awful.  I don't recommend this method for reheating unless you enjoy rubber bacon balls! :)

I was desperately looking for a "finger food-main dish" for my potluck, and decided to make this. At first, I was slightly turned off by its high-fat content, but I knew that quiche is high in fat in nature. To make it healthier and also more flavorful, I made some changes:
1. Used only 4 slices of turkey bacon instead of 12 slices of regular bacon.
2. Omitted cheese (didn't have any)
3. Added about 6 mushrooms, sliced and sauteed in olive oil and garlic.
4. Threw in some frozen corn sitting in my freezer.
5. About two handfuls of frozen spinach, thawed and drained.
6. Some freshly diced tomatoes.
People enjoyed it very much, and raved about how pretty it looked. I think I will keep the changes I made in the future, because I think it's definitely healthier and tastier.

This is a great recipe. I did alter it a bit to suit my family. I used 10 slices of bacon, 5 eggs, 1 cup of 1/2 & 1/2, 2 TBS. flour and I also added a 10 ounce box of chopped frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed dry. The temperature stated seemed a bit too high, so I baked the quiche at 375 degrees for one hour. It came out perfect. Will definitely make again.

This was the first quiche I ever made and it was wonderful! I followed the advice of a few other posters and added some extras: 2 eggs and another 1/4 cup of milk, 2 extra slices of bacon and another 1/4 cup of swiss, and made 2 quiches instead of one. I still had a little filling leftover, so I baked it in a pan and made a neat little crustless quiche for breakfast at work. My husband even liked it and he is THE pickiest eater I have ever seen. This one is going in my favorites file!

I'm giving this a 5 because my husband said "This is F*****G amazing" THREE times. But I changed a bunch. I used 4 eggs. I used 1 and 1/4 cup of half and half. I used some cheese blend. I know it had sharp cheddar and a couple other things. I put in about a cup of sliced mushrooms, about a 1/4 cup of chopped green onions, and I used less than half of an onion. I put in some nutmeg. I used cubed ham instead of bacon. I used a frozen pie crust, and I baked it at 375 for.. Hmmmm 55 minutes? It spilled EVERYWHERE. luckily I had it on a cookie sheet. Yeah, I changed too much. It's getting a 4.

I made this last night using ham and cheddar since that is what I had.  It was delicious, even the "real men" svoured every bite.  I made one with broccoli for the vegetarian in our house and it wasn't nearly as tasty. I used 4 eggs and a little less milk as I had read in previous reviews.

I used less milk and added some broccoli I had lying around, and it was great, probably would have been a little bland without it. I baked mine at about 400, still took about 35 minutes. Will make this again.

I thought this tasted really good; I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 b/c I followed other reviewers comments and changed the recipe a bit.  So, the rating is based on these changes:
used 4 eggs, 1 1/4 C milk, 7 slices bacon, premade pastry crust, and sauted onion in butter and garlic salt.

I'm sure the original is great.  The changes made a great quiche too.  I didn't even notice the part of the recipe that says "Reduce oven temperature to 325°F." - oops!  So mine cooked at 450°F for 40 minutes which worked just fine.  I covered the crust edge with foil while baking so it didn't burn.  I may reduce to 425°F next time, just for kicks.  Thanks for the recipe!

this turned out really good but I made a few changes.  I used evap. milk instead of reg. milk (sounded watery to me) and I used 4 eggs.  I also sautéed a garlic clove with the onion.  As others suggested I did heat the oven to at least 375 to make it cook faster.  Good basic recipe you can adapt to your tastes!!

It was superb although, it took much longer to bake than 40 minutes.  Our oven is actually 10 degrees hotter and it took an hour and twenty minutes.  It was well worth it though.  My husband LOVED it!  It would also be good with some mushrooms and spinach in it too!

It is really delicious...modified for 2 pies (although fell a bit short on liquid).  Used 3/4 cup half and half, 1 cup 2% milk, 10 strips smoked bacon, a caramelized onion with a pinch of nutmeg, sautéed baby spinach, an quarter teaspoon salt, a cup of gruyere shredded with the tablespoon of flour,  and 5 eggs.  I used frozen whole wheat pie shells, which I thought would ruin it or make it even better.  Poked a few holes in the defrosted shells and pre baked for 10 minutes in a 375 oven.  Added custard to hot pie shells and baked at 375 for about 45 minutes.  The wife flipped out over the taste and, honestly, we ate an entire pie in one sitting!

We really enjoyed this quiche. I added an extra egg and used just one cup of half n half. I also brushed my frozen pie shells with egg white and prebaked for about 5 minutes. I used gruyere cheese about two cups and baked it for 50 minutes. Came out awesome! I let it cool for 20 minutes and served it with a chopped green salad with italian dressing. Complemented the rich quiche perfectly. Hubby raved and said he wants the leftovers tonight. Definately a keeper. I also used an entire package of center cut bacon. No wonder we liked it so much lol.

I took the suggestion to pre bake the crust and use the half and half.  It was so incredibly good!!  I can't wait to make it again.  The entire family enjoyed it.

SO Good! I also added an extra egg and instead of half and half (I was out) used 4 tbsp melted butter and enough milk to equal 1 cup. I upped the bacon as well to 8 slices. Cooked on 350 for about an hour. This was great and came out just right.

Yet again, another winner from AR!  This recipe is excellent as is, but I was trying to use up an abundance of spinach from the garden so I add a couple of handfuls, chopped. Also, I didn't have swiss cheese so I used cheddar (which I know is quiche sacrilege, but it worked.)  I was concerned that there weren't enough eggs, but this cooked perfectly and I will be skeptical of recipes that use more than this in the future.

Love this recipe! It does not last long in my house so I make two at a time. Also I omit bacon sometimes for a package of thawed/ drained chopped spinach to make Quiche Florentine!

I changed the ingredients up a bit, due to what I had on hand, but this was my first attempt at quiche and it turned out great. I used half red onion, half green, a few mushrooms, and a mixture of cheddar and mozzarella cheeses. The only issue I had was that the egg seemed to separate to the bottom, while everything else floated to the top. It was still very rich and yummy. I followed others suggestions and only heated my oven to 350 for the first baking of the crust, then lowered to 325 with the filling. Thanks for a good, versatile recipe!

This is the best quiche I've ever made.  I used a couple different cheese simply because I didn't have enough swiss on hand but the additions I believe added wonderful flavor.  I used a swiss, cheddar, and gouda combination.  Be sure the bacon is crispy so it chops well into fine pieces.  I recomment mincing the onion as you want to make a quiche, not a casserole so the more finely chopped the ingredients the better.  WONDERFUL recipe all around though!

This recipe is DELICIOUS! I added a box of thawed and drained frozen spinach, and it added some extra vitamins as well as good flavor. It is time consuming, but it is definitely worth it. I will make this again and again, for sure.

Yum! I used 1 cup half and half instead of 1-1/2 cups milk and it did not overflow in my regular pie dish. Not sure why some people are complaining about the recipe not having greens--I have never had a Quiche Lorraine with greens.

Turned out awesome, however the filling mixture overflowed the crust.  I shall use a deep dish crust next time.  Also I dislike swiss cheese and used monterey jack.  Very good!

Very easy recipe to change to your taste by adding different veggies, cheeses and proteins. I make large batches then freeze them after baking. Just thaw and bake for about 20 mins or until heated through for a quick meal. Thanks for sharing!

Where's the green stuff that's in the photo??? I made this according to recipe but with 1 extra egg and a package of thawed/drained/chopped spinach. As others have noted, use your math to determine how much milk/egg is needed for your dish size. I used a deep dish and a ready-made crust and had room for an extra egg plus the spinach.

This was a good quiche, but needed some adjustments. I used 8 slices of bacon, and half Monterey jack cheese and half swiss cheese. I also used 4 eggs. After it was done I tasted it and still felt like it needed something. I sprinkled cheese on the top to make it look a bit prettier and then served each slice with a dollop of sour cream and a slice of avocado. That really did it and my guests really enjoyed the taste as well as the presentation.

First time making quiche and it came out great! I used a ready made crust and it came out just fine. I added one extra egg per other suggestions but it gave me a little too much mixture, no big deal though. I mixed swiss, cheddar and some parmesean cheese and put in 8 slices of bacon. It was so good and it set perfectly! I did cook for an extra five minutes. I will definetly make this again!

Im sure this recipe is delicious without my modifications!! BUT I used 1/2 cup milk, 1/4 cup heavy cream. I used regular pizza cheese since it was the only thing I had and also used 4 eggs instead of three!
I used 8 slices of bacon to make my brothers super happy :P 
This was the first time I made a pie crust and it was very yummy.. I made it with butter because there isnt shortening where I live, or if there is I dont know how to translate it! 
DELICIOS!! 35 minutes in the oven and it was ready

I've made this recipe at least 8 times since I discovered it, varying the ingredients occasionally but for the majority of time making it with bacon and onion. Its foolproof! 

Tip: Use your freezer! Have all ingredients on hand all the time. That way you'll have enough ingredients to make the quiche without having to run to the store at the last minute. 
1)Freeze your bacon in individual slices layed out on plastic wrap then put them in a freezer bag. Pull out as many slices as you want.
2)Buy frozen pre-baked pie shells
3)Dice/chop some onions and freeze also
4)Buy or grate swiss cheese, put in freezer
5)Eggs and milk are usually always a staple in refrig along with flour in the cupboard.

This recipe was pretty good. To make it lower in fat I used skim milk 1/2 cup less than recipe asked for. I also used egg substitute. I added some sauteed broccoli and cooked the quiche about 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for.

Great basis for a recipe, but I made some changes. I added a package of cream cheese for some richness. I also subed the swiss cheese for some good aged cheddar. LOVED it! :)

Excellent recipe....easy to make, especially with a ready made pie crust.  I also used pre-cooked bacon.  It was frozen, so 10 seconds in the micro and then cut into small pieces.

Overall a very good recipe, however I will make a minor  change next time. Do not saute the onions in the bacon grease, it made the dish incredibly greasy. I would saute them alone. I did make a few adjustments based on other reviews....I added an egg and reduced the milk to 1 1/4 cup.

Delicious! I used fake bacon instead of the real stuff - to make it vegetarian, and it turned out very good. It also reheats well.

Very good recipe. Added some shredded parmesan cheese on top before baking and also a little ground nutmeg in the main mixture for little extra something. Great with a salad for a ladies luncheon.

This is precisely the rich decadent consistency and flavor I was hoping for. I substituted half and half for the milk because I like the extra body it adds, and real pre-cooked bacon bits because I am lazy and didn't feel like cooking bacon (if you wanna be lazy with me they are in the salad aisle - make sure to get REAL bacon bits, not bacon flavored bits). The crust stayed flaky for as long as the quiche lasted. The bacon tasted just right despite being a shortcut. This recipe is a keeper.

Outstanding!  Even my husband, who turned his nose up when I told him what we were having, ate two big pieces.  I lowered the fat by using turkey bacon, evaporated skim milk, egg beaters, and 1 1/4 cup reduced fat swiss cheese.  I also added 2 chopped plum tomatoes.  Delicious!

I enjoy making this easy to make recipe. I make this for myself at least three times a month. Sometimes I'll share it with a neighbor or relative, but it freezes nicely. I prefer using ham over bacon, but there are times when I use them both. Use a mixture of milk and cream, whipping cream or what ever I have in the fridge. Thank you for one of my favorite things to eat.

My friend Linda made this for a gathering and I loved it!  I made it tonight and should have looked at all of the suggestions...This is what I SHOULD have done- first- I would prick the pie crust with a fork BEFORE cooking.  I didn't do this as the recipe didn't mention it and my crust was all puffy. I think this would help contain the filling when it is poured into the pie crust.  Second- increase the temperature to 350.

I made this over the weekend for my first guests in our new home in France and it came out really good. The crust was burnt so I will be more careful next time and cover it with foil or pre-bake it for less time. I'll be making this again. Merci!

Just not a hit with my family.  Also, watch the pre cook on the crust, it can fall into the pan as it warms.

I had to make a vegetarian quiche lorraine for Easter.  I made this with tofu bacon.  The quiche was so good that the fake bacon didn't even matter.  It took quite a long time to make, but it was well worth it and delicious.  I will try again sometime with real bacon.

Our Family loved this, it's so easy and so tasty.  I used 1 c mozzarella and 1/2 c pepper jack in place of the swiss cheese.  I didn't have swiss, but I'm sure it's good with that too!  We will make this again!

This was my first time making quiche and this was a great recipe to start with.  I took the advice of previous posters and added an egg.  I also increased the temperature of the oven the second time I made it because it took too long the first time.

Excellent recipe. Like one of the reviewers, I used 1 cup of half-and-half instead of the milk. Very nice flavour and ready after 35 minutes at 350. Will definitely make again!

Excellent!!  I haven't made quiche since high school home economics class (too many years ago to mention) and this recipe was just as I remember quiche tasting.  I will make this again for sure.  It was a hit with the family at a birthday brunch - even my husband ate it, which is something!

Heaven in a pie pan!  This was absolutely delicious.  I used a pre-made pie crust. Before cooking the pie crust,  I buttered the sides and bottom of my glass pie pan.  I don't like swiss cheese so I used a mix of moneteray jack and mild cheddar.  I also like a more custardy type of quiche, so I added one additional egg.  I followed the recipe to a "T" otherwise.  My children, husband, and I all LOVED it!  Thank you LADYNUSS for such an amazing and versatile recipe!

Too much milk and baking times were way too high.  I added quartered artichoke hearts to mine and it was amazing!  Will make again - with less milk and lower temps.

Delish!  Easy too!  I did make some adjustments per other reviews and also based on what was in my house.  I did not mix any of the ingredients into the milk/egg mixture beforehand.  I put some small, raw broccoli florets in the bottom of the pie shell, added the bacon, onion, and cheese (only 1 c.), omited the flour, and then poured the egg/milk mixture on top.  I used 4 eggs, 1 c. 1% milk, and 1/2 c heavy cream.  I baked it at 350 for about 50 minutes or so.

Well, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was straight forward enough. It took considerably longer to bake, though, than in the directions here.  Make sure you like Swiss cheese a lot before making this one. Only one person in our family ate it (I actually spit mine out), and he said it was so-so.

Fantastic recipe.  I didn't use the onion because I don't like it.  Instead I diced up one garlic clove and sauteed that in the bacon drippings instead.  I tried two cloves the first time around, and the garlic taste was too strong.  One clove was plenty.

I made it to celebrate the Bastille day. It turned out just great. Both my husband and I love it. To reduce  cholesterol, I used 1 whole egg and 4 egg white and unsweetened soy milk instead of milk. I also added some spinach. We brought the leftover to work on the next day, it still tastes great.

i found this recipe to be very good the only problem i had with it is that it reminded more of eating a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich then a quiche. this recipe definitely works better with diced ham.

Excellent recipe. I used a frozen deep dish pie crust and added two extra egg yolks I had left over from another recipe. Also used half and half instead of all milk. Turned out great baked at 350 degrees and reheated well too.

I give this recipe 4 1/2 stars.  It was yummy, the proportion were right on, and the prep-work was easy.  My mom was impressed (I made it for her on Mother's Day) since it was my first quiche ever.  I added green onions and sour cream as a garnish and I will definitely make this recipe again.  Yummy!

This was my first time making a quiche, and it turned out terrific!  I used store bought pie crust and it was delish!!  I also didn't have any pie pans, so I used my 9x13 and used the 6 egg suggested in one of the reviews and it was very tasty!  I took it to church for our Women's breakfast and it was a hit!!!

Excellent! I used precooked bacon (that you can fry in frying pan for 30 seconds and then just added a bit of butter for frying the onions. Also added sliced mushrooms. The only complaint I had was that my so-called deep dish ready-made pie crust wasn't deep enough (thankfully I had placed a foil lined baking sheet underneath!).

This is awesome - only a tiny bit left out of 2!  Even our super fussy son had seconds.  The only problem I had was the crust sticking to the pans (1 was glass and the other was a disposable).

This was one of the best quiches I've ever eaten. And the best part was it was to make! I was delighted I found this recipe. I served the quiche at brunch, and everyone raved about how good it was (except my fiancee, who doesn't touch eggs or onions!). Oh, and I added one green pepper and a handful of chopped fresh chives, for a little more zip. Yum!

thsi was yummy... but you need to put foil around the edges from the beginning to avoid burning the crust.

Nothing but rave reviews from my co-workers. I did adjust the receipe a bit. I used 10" pie pans, a full pound of bacon, 1/2 of an onion and 4 eggs instead of 3, and an extra 1/4 cup of milk.

Nice tasting recipe and very easy to make.  Made too much filling for my 9inch crust though, next time I will add one more egg and 1/2 cup more milk and make two.  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe & so quick to make. I adjusted the recipe slightly by omitting the salt, adding 2 eggs (enough to make 2 quiches) adding about 1/4 tsp nutmeg & 1/2 tsp fresh ground black pepper. I was a little nervous as I've never made quiche before but it turned out great! Thanks!!

I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I could...the leftovers were really good.  I followed the advice of others and used 4 eggs and cut back on the milk.  It was still really full - thank goodness I had a cookie sheet underneath or I would have had a huge mess!!  I didn't have any swiss on hand, so I used up some cheddar and munster, which was really good.  I would cut out the added salt next time - it was already quite salty from teh bacon and the cheese.  I will definately make this again!

Love it!! I lessened the milk to 1 cup, used 4 eggs, and slighly less onions. I also mixed in some other cheeses I had on hand one time I made this recipe. It's great both ways! A family favorite! Thanks!!

This dish was a hit with the family. I guess hubby isn't a "real man" because he does love quiche, however, as unfortunate as it is, he doused it with catsup. How insulting!!!! Yummy Lynn and thanks!

I used a deep 9 inch pie crust which could not hold all the ingredients without over flowing.  I would definitely use less milk IF I tried to make this again.   My toothpick came out clean, it smelled great and looked done, but the  texture was like very soft pudding.

This easy to make and had good flavor.  I added mushrooms to the onions when I sauted them (used the idea from another review to use butter instead of the bacon grease).  It was too salty for my tasted so next time I will omit the salt.  I think it gets enough from the bacon.

excellent.  I didn't bother with the foil during the pre-baking of the pie crust.  Also, I used seven pieces of the pre-coooked hormel bacon (so I just cooked the onion in butter.

A terrific recipe for basic quiche Lorraine - can do no wrong.  Use the "Never, Never Fail Pie Pastry" recipe for the crust.

Pretty good...I only used 1/2 an onion and  sauteed it with butter and a garlic clove.

Next time I might add a little more salt.  My husband LOVED it!

Absolutely delicious!  I used 8 slices of bacon instead of 6 and only half an onion (to suit my tastes).  I also took the advice of another reviewer and used half & half instead of milk.  It was a huge hit!  Thanks!

Nice results with this recipe.  I wanted to use up some leftover ham so I substituted it for the bacon.  I found that mine needed to cook a lot longer than what the recipe called for.

This is almost the exact same recipe that a friend of mine, a French exchange student, made for me.

When I made it, I didn't have bacon on hand, and I cut the cheese down to 1/2 cup (also used a little asiago cheese with the swiss). I didn't bother with the crust either. In any case, it turned out well--I'm sure the original recipe would be equally as delicious

This was wonderful.  The swiss cheese adds such a nice flavor and covering the crust was also a good idea for those of us that like our crusts not very dark.  Even my husband liked it and he's not a quiche fan. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious, but I did have to make some adjustments to the baking time.I used a thawed pastry and took another reviewer’s advice to cook at 350 degrees rather than 450.Also baked quiche at 350 for 55 minutes rather than 325 for 35-40 minutes. Even after all that time, it was still a little runny in the middle, but after it cooled off it hardened enough to eat.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.

I wouldn't review a recipe unless I made it exactly according to existing ingredients and instructions. The only change I made this time was to use a homemade crust. This quiche was delicious and since there are only two of us, I was pleased that it was equally good the next day.

This is a very easy recipe. I made a double batch of the base and made one with spinach and bacon, the other with ham and mushrooms. Both were delicious!  I will definitely use this recipe again!

I use this recipe as a base for pretty good quiches. Ive swapped out the bacon usually for cubed ham or breakfast sausage, comes out great tasting every time. 
I would recommend using 1 cup milk instead of 1 1/2, the quiche will overflow otherwise.

I have made this twice. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly. The second time, I tweaked it. In addition to the onion, a added 1 small shallot. Instead if using milk, I used heavy cream. Lastly, tobasco  sauce was added to my taste. My husband liked the second one better ! That’s as good as it gets for me !

Generally I make a recipe the first time the way it was submitted. Then later, if I want to tweak it, I'll read the reviews. This time I wish I had read the reviews before making it. First, the crust pre-bake was too hot and too long. Second, I am very tired of quiches for which the recipe makes too much filling for the crust, as with this recipe. I see a previous reviewer called for recipe submitters to state the size of crust they used and I agree with that. It would help a lot.

Instead of using a pie crust, I used sliced sweet potatoes and it tasted wonderful. There was the sweetness of the potatoes added to the flavour of the eggs, onion and bacon. Make sure you use cooking spray on your glass pan and then spray your potatoes lightly as well. I saw this done on a cooking show. I won’t ever use a regular pie crust again. It’s a 10 out of 10.

I made a deep dish pie and had to increase liquid (2 cups cream  and 3 eggs) and cheese (2cups) by about 25%.    Also added some sweet & hot-pickled jalapeno slices for added kick.  Custard- cheese mixture very  creamy and rich.  I  did not pre-bake crust and it was fine.  baked at 400 for 12 minutes and then finished at about 350 for another 50 minutes.  Definitely make again after I work out for about 3 weeks , very high fat but oh so good.

I followed a few suggestions. I baked the crust at 350 for 5 min and removed the foil for another 4 minutes. I did 4 eggs and 1 cup of half and half. I sautéed the onions with a clove of minced garlic. I used 8 pieces of bacon (I used precooked bacon and heated through before adding in). I didn't end up having to foil the crust while cooking and it took 40 minutes (but I cooked 2 at a time). I used Swiss in one quiche and cheddar jack in the other. I prefer the Swiss but the cheddar jack was good too (almost a sweeter taste than the Swiss so may be better for kids). YUM!

I LOVE this recipe!  I sometimes substitute ham for the bacon and it's good as well - mainly because I usually have some cubed ham in the freezer and it's easier.  I also add a little garlic to add some flavor.

Excellent recipe, but I cooked my quiche at 325 degrees for approximately 40-50 minutes.  Also beware that different manufacturers make different sizes of deep dish pie shells! PetRitz Brand are 12oz,  One Great Value Brand (at Walmart) is 15 ounces, another GV Brand is 16 ounces, Pillsbury was 16 oz. And Trader Joe's Gourmet  deep dish pie shells were 22 ounces! This will greatly make a difference of how full your pie shell is after adding the filling! Recipes submitted should state what brand/size pie shell to use. If you don't follow the recommended pie shell size, and the liquid doesn't fit, or overflows, it's not the recipe creators fault!

My husband had never had quiche, so I made this for a light Sunday supper. It was delicious, although I admit I made a few substitutions. I used my favorite recipe for a one crust pie shell and used ham instead of bacon, because I had some leftovers to use up. I reduced the milk to 1 1/4 cups and used four eggs, in keeping with some of the reviews I read and let it rest for fifteen minutes before serving it. This would be marvelous on a brunch menu and definitely fit for company.

I made this exactly as written, except I used half and half and added about 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. The whole family loved it. Served it with a salad and blueberry muffins. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for a great recipe!

Simple, very tasty quiche. Substitute bacon for Trader Joe's chopped Pancetta - cook 'til crispy. Use Trader Joe's Gruyere and Cheddar combo cheese. I also add about one cup of chopped spinach.

Made this dairy free and it was great! Used 1 C almond milk, 1/4 C canned coconut milk, and 1 C Daiya Mozzarella Style Shreds. I also used deli ham in place of bacon, and 2 C frozen defrosted spinach (with excess liquid squeezed out). To prebake the crust, I followed the instructions on the frozen crust package (Wholly Wholesome)

Very yummy. Had to cook it longer than the recipe said. And the premade pie dough slid down as I was trying pre bake it.  Otherwise good flavor.

This dish is excellent! It is one of the better quiche recipes I have tried, and really simple to make. I opted to add Morning Starter tofu-bacon instead of the real thing, and the dish still turned out great! Thank you for this recipe. I'll definitely be making it for picnics and brunches.

Fantastic flavor!  I use a premade crust and turkey bacon.  I use onion powder instead of an actual onion, and it has turned out awesome every time!

Great recipe.  Used suggested changes from others: increased eggs to 4 and raised temp to 375 for 30 min.  Personal changes: added garlic powder and made homemade pie crust.  Used regular milk and added extra tablespoon of flour to help thicken and used cheddar/colby mix of cheese.  Turned out beautiful and tasty.  Thanks!

Wonderful, creamy results. Since this is Quiche Lorraine, it would be helpful to include spinach in the ingredients and instructions. I wilted mine at the end of the onion cook, about 1/3 a bag.

The recipe needs to state up front that you will need deep dish pie crusts or you will waste precious and expensive ingredients like I did.

Good, easy recipe.  I didn't have Swiss so substituted Sharp Cheddar and it was delicious.  Also, the cheese I had was already shredded so there was no need to add the flour.

This was just ok -- rather bland. Also, I didn't appreciate the flavour of the sweetness of my store-bought pie crust with the savouriness of the filling.  I used 4 small eggs and 1 cup of milk, and this made the perfect amount to fill the deep dish pie crust nicely, with no spillovers. I prebaked the crust at 350 for 10 minutes, covered with aluminum foil. 45 minutes at 375 degrees after filling the pie, as others suggested, yielded the perfect consistency.

This is surprizing light tasting quiche.  I forgot the salt, which does take from the flavor ~so don't miss it! I agree 450 degrees is too high.  They browned a bit too quickly.

I used 3 jumbo eggs. I had a peice of fresh brocolli smaler than my fist and cooked it with the onion. Did not add salt, and baked it at 350 for 45 minutes in a prebaked deep dish pie crust that was store bought. Hubby likes it a lot as do I. This will be one to make over & over.

I only found this when looking for oven temps. I make the short crust pastry myself. Line a 9' pie dish and add all the ingredients above or play a bit which is fine, mushrooms and italian sausage work well, bake at 430 for 30 ish minutes......NO PRE BAKING OF THE PASTRY. lovely cold the next day with a salad.

I added nutmeg, as the traditional french recipe includes nutmeg. Next time I will try veggies, like mushrooms. I seem to have a problem with the pie crust fluffing up on me. In France, where I live, the crust comes already with a paper you are supposed to include instead of aluminum foil.

This recipe is delicious. I followed others' suggestions and used 1 cup milk and 4 eggs. I added extra bacon. I wish I had made twice the amount - I am eating it so quickly.   The only thing I wish is that there had been some guidance around what recipe to use for the crust.

This was quite good. I didn't make my own pie crust -- I'm just not that energetic in the morning. It took a little longer to set up in the middle than the recipe said. Solid recipe overall. Will make again, maybe try some of the alterations mentioned in other reviews.

Great Quiche.  Very easy and quick, just what I need with a 2 year old and a 5 month old!  I added extra "spices" and bacon and also used 4 eggs and 1/2 cup of milk as others suggested.  Turned out great!

Very good recipe! I didn't have time to cook the shell fully before adding the ingredients. I cooked it for about 5 min at 375. I needed it to cook quickly so I didn't have time for 1 1/2 c. of milk to evaporate. So I put in a total of 6 eggs and only 1/2c. milk. It cooked completely in 35 min. at 375. Will definitely do that again next time, worked great!

A nice base from which to build.  Added ingredients based on family preference.  Varied up the cheese to include Swiss, pepper jack, NY white cheddar, etc.

This was amazing.  We added a few more slices of bacon, which was great for flavor.  However, it did take longer to bake, and we eventually upped the temp of the oven.

Very soft and delicate--much nicer than I expected. For a firmer quiche, add another egg and decrease the cream/milk. Changes I made: I sauteed mushrooms, spinach and some turkey ham in with the onions, and sprinkled with salt and pepper. I used 1 c. half-and-half instead of milk, and sprinkled salt into the egg mixture rather than using a full 1/4 t. I also used a combination of swiss cheese and mixed shredded cheeses (cheddar, monterey jack and mozzarella) to give it more flavor. Lastly, made my own pie crust--see "Pastry for double pie crust"--which was very flaky and made it very good.

Makes a great thin 9" Quiche. To save time try frozen French Picnic pie shells, organic, w/ butter, and follow the a. foil procedure. Two for $10. makes 2 fast quiches! Or fill 1 w/ apples and caramel and make a fast tart. I brought eggs to room temperature and beat lots of air into them for a super creamy and light texture. Putting the salt onto the cooked onions brought out more flavor.

I served this for Christmas breakfast along with the Spinach quiche from All Recipes.  This was so delicious.  I sauteed the bacon and onions the night before and saved it for the next morning.  I also added a little minced garlic and mushrooms to the mix.  Everyone loved the quiche.  I will make next year too.

I started using this recipe over a year ago when I was first learning how to cook. I like that it is simple and doesn't require a lot of ingredients. At the same time, I love experimenting and adding different things like ham and mushrooms.  I have served this to guests at  dinner, including my picky French boyfriend, and all loved it. Just be careful this tasty dish is not safe left alone.. my roomate always steals all the leftovers. The only reason I didnt give this recipe 5 stars was that is does require more eggs than stated. Yet it would be hard to mess it up as you can see many reviewers do it their own way and adjust to their tastes. I never have a problem using skim milk but would recommend using good quality cheese, no fake processed stuff.

I wasn't crazy about the flavor & neither were my guests.  I did increase the amount of bacon by a couple more strips & one additional egg.  I will try a different recipe next time, I think.

Loved this quiche recipe but I had to tweak it a bit.  Didn't use the bacon as I had leftover ham.  I sauted the ham, onion and a bit of fresh broccoli that I had leftover also.  I did use the 4 eggs and the liquid was 1/2 cup half and half and 1/2 cup skim milk.  This was because it was all I had in the frig.  But it turned out great.

I made this for my mother for mothers day and she loved it.  I had two pie crusts that I wanted to use so I made a double batch.  Doubles well.  I ate the second one with my boyfriend... reheats in the microwave well.  He still is begging me once a week to make this recipe!!

Ths recipe was a hit! I cut the amount of milk on the recommendation of the other reviewers and it set nicely. I found my oven seems to bake at a lower temperature than indicated so it took 40 mins at the recommended temperature, then I upped it by 40 degrees for another 30 mins. Made it with my favourite scratch pie crust from the Re-Bar cookbook and it was great!

This was great! I followed other's advice and used 4 eggs and more bacon.  I also sauted the onions in butter not the bacon grease. And I used 2 different chedder cheeses instead of Swiss and it was still delicious!

This was awsome. Reminds me of my mom's cooking. I didn't have any milk (I drink soy) so I added a can of condensed milk and left out the flour.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made it for dinner and my family loved it. I added a half package of spinach to it, if you like spinach. I used the No Roll Pie Crust recipe too for the crust, also found on this site. Very good. I will make this again...

This quiche was great!!  I wasn't able to find shredded swiss cheese, so I used monterey jack instead.  Next time I will shredd some swiss cheese so we can try it out that way also.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  We will definitely have this again.
