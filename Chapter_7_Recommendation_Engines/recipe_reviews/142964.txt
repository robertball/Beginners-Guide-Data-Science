I only made 1/2 a batch of these cookies and i made a few changes. I added 1/2 a cup of root beer instead of milk, more peanut butter then called for and the chunky kind, all sugar was brown and I added about 1/2 cup of peanut butter chips. After they cooled and I tasted one I freaked out because I could have eaten a whole batch to myself! They were so so so good! I will be making these again for sure! If using my adjustments on your recipe, keep in mind that i only made a 1/2 batch , you would need to double my adjustments.

I needed an eggless recipe for Valentine's Day treats and I had to make a couple of last minute changes: I used 6 Tbsp. cocoa powder for richer chocolate flavor and SIFTED with dry ingredients, also about 1/2 C. creamy peanut butter was pretty good, and here is a trick for super moistness and a bit of tang: place 1/4 C. sour cream in a liquid measure and add milk (this works great with water too) until it reaches the 1/2 C. mark, mix this to break up sour cream, a few small lumps is no biggie, then add alternately with dry flour mixture to creamed butter mixture, at this point I added about 3/4 C. mini M&M's and 3/4 C. semi sweet choc. chips, ROUNDED TABLESPOONFULS, baked for 13 minutes and allowed to cool about 2 minutes on the pan- these came out like moist little chocolate cakes and everyone gave the thumbs up! This is a great recipe - but don't be afraid to play around and adjust to your liking; the beauty in this one is the versatility it brings.

These are good for an eggless recipe, but didn't have enough cocoa or peanut butter for me.  Next time I'll at least double the peanut butter.

These are fabulous when you have a sweet tooth, but no eggs and no desire to go to the grocery store.  Great flavor, very easy to make.

These are really good!  And pretty easy too.  I was out of eggs and wanted to make cookies.  They really came out great.  Nice chunky cookie and they taste really good.  My step-daughter's boyfriend is allergic to eggs and after tasting my finished product I immediately emailed her the recipe.

Like alot of others I was out of eggs and needed a quick cookie for a 4-H meeting.  I used this recipe and was really quite delish.  I made half regular and then added some white choc chips to the other half. Both were good and slighly soft in the center.  Nice

Love this recipe. i did make a few changes to it. I use peanut butter instead of butter and add flax seed. I also added chocolate chips and used soy milk instead of cow's milk. They were yummy!

Like others, I doubled my peanut butter and I added Reese's peanut butter chips. The cookies turned out just "OK". There was nothing so great about them that I'll ever attempt to make them again.

I made a few tweaks due to lack of ingredients: I added 2 parts of butter and one of margarine, because I ran out of butter. I added 2 tablespoons of chocolate syrup, since I didn't have cocoa powder and added chocolate chips. Something went wrong. Tastewise, they were pretty bland. And they expanded a lot and it was hard to place them in the cooling rack, so a few fell apart. Next time I'll stick to the recipe as is.

Somehow Christmas Eve came around and I didn't have any cookies for Santa...  I scaled this recipe down to 2 servings and got 8 small cookies out of it. I was skeptical (because of no eggs and scaling down a recipe is always tricky...)! I used about 1/16 tsp each of baking soda, powder, and salt. I definitely used more cocoa powder and PB than the recipe called for, but I'm a personal fan of both :) They came out of the oven and OH MY GOSH!  I wasn't really expecting to be able to taste the chocolate or PB, but it was SO GOOD! Oh, and I mixed the cocoa powder with the dry ingredients, not the butter!

These were just ok.  I didn't have quite enough butter so I used a half cup butter and added a little extra peanut butter.  They came out surprisingly flavorless and dry.  Won't be making these again.

Great base recipe. However, I doubled up on cocoa, milk, vanilla and peanut butter. I also added white chocolate chips.  These cookies are dynomite!  Cake like and moist! Everyone is giving rave reviews!  My boyfriend is allergic to eggs and lactose intolorent so I also used lactose free milk.  yum yum yum!

we were in the mood to make cookies last night but were saddened to see we were out of eggs.  We found these cookies and made them.  Very good cookie!  

I added a tad more cocoa powder and vanilla in mine, also added milk chocolate chips.  Made it with lactose milk due to milk allergies and was excellent.

I was desperately craving cookies, so I came on here looking for a recipe I could make with what few ingredients I had. I had everything for this recipe except for the cocoa. I added 1/2 cup of oats and a sprinkle of cinnamon. I'm going to double the peanut butter next time. I got my cookie fix, and I'm happy. =)

It is a very nice recipe! I used only white sugar but it works out fine. I think it is peanut-buttery enough, but the chocolate flavour is lacking. Maybe adding some chocolate chips would make it devil enough.

Following suggestions from other reviewers, I used 1.5 cups brown sugar (instead of white), 1 cup peanut butter, and 1/2 cup cocoa powder. Also added 3/4 cup milk chocolate and 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (would use a bit less next time). Cookies were delicious!

This was a great recipe!  Thanks for the idea! My daughter is allergic to eggs so I'm always looking for egg-free recipes.  I made the following adjustments: reduced the butter to 1/2 c. and substituted pb for the rest, used all brown sugar instead of white, increased vanilla to 1 tsp. and used vanilla yogurt in place of milk.  Added 1 cup of chocolate chips.  Found this made about 4 dozen modest size cookies!

I made these last night with Earth Balance and soy milk.  I omitted the brown sugar because when I opened mine it was a solid brick.  I had planned to add a touch of chocolate syrup to make up for that and add chocolate flavor but forgot.  I made 24, like the recipe said, but with probably almost a cup leftover dough.  I baked for about 15 minutes and they were soft, cake-y, not overly sweet warm from the oven.  Cooled the next day they are fluffy and soft, but I wish they were chewier.  I will be making again.

Per other reviews, I doubled the cocoa and vanilla and opted to use 1 1/2 cups peanut butter and left out the butter. I also used all brown sugar. I had to add a little water to get this to incorporate but it turned out nice.  Next time I will add some of the butter back in.

These were great, my guests had no idea that the egg was missing, now I'm wondering why I even use eggs in cookies because these were even shaped well. Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies are so yummy. I think I'm going to make a chocolate moose to put in the middle to make them like Lil' Debbie fudge rounds. Thanks for the recipe.

Rummaging around the kitchen for something sweet...I know! I'll make cookies! Uh oh...no eggs! That's when I looked up this recipe and was delighted that it turned out so well. Like everyone else, I added a bit more cocoa, peanut butter and vanilla extract. Yummy with a glass of ice cold milk (whichever kind you like!)

Came upon this recipe when I needed something sweet and had no eggs. They came out perfect! After reading reviews, I added a tbsp of cocoa powder to the dry ingredients, as well as a few dashes of cinnamon. They were the perfect sweetness for me (stuck to recommend sugar and used natural peanut butter). Will definitely make these again (even if I do have eggs)!

For me, these are just OK. I halved the recipe, but then as others suggested, doubled the milk, cocoa, peanut butter and vanilla. They still turned out quite bland. It could be because I used unsalted, unsweetened peanut butter. I used all white sugar as it was all I had on hand. I thought the use of all that sugar would help balance out my bland PB, but it didn't! I don't think I would make these again.

I made no changes- made it exactly as the recipe is written. It was just okay- again, fine if you have no eggs, but if you have them, make something else. The way some of the reviews read I was expecting it to be awesome, but it was just so so. Texture was a bit bready, but still like a cookie...chocolate was okay, could not taste the PB at all....made me kind of sad that I wasted my good PB on it. It satisfied a craving, but I won't be making again.

The dough was better than the cookies. Like others, I increased the peanut butter to 1/2c and I added mini semi sweet chocolate chips. Dough was great (and edible since no eggs). Cookies were dry and kind of tasteless. I’m also not sure how the recipe created the cookies in the picture as mine didn’t spread at all while cooking so they cane out looking almost exactly the same as when they went in. I made these simply cause I wanted cookies but didn’t have any eggs in the house. If I was making them for someone with an allergy, I may try to increase the peanut butter to 3/4 or even a cup and possibly increase the brown sugar too. If I didnt need an eggless recipe for an allergy, I’d probably never make them again. The only other positive thing I can say is that at least since they aren’t that great, I don’t want to eat them a dozen at a time. They were ok as a slightly sweet little treat with my coffee in the morning.

me and my family really enjoyed the flavor of the cookies. the only problem was that it didn't really bake good. it didn't  get the crispness i was looking for. but the recipe was still amazing. i even added a few chocolate chips to add more flavor.

I made this recipe. I'm 14 years old. It came out great. But instead of putting in the milk after and kneading it into the dough i poured in the milk as I went along. My siblings destroyed them.

Good cookie!  Turn out great even though I screwed up and didn't mix it correctly.  Almost melted the butter vs softening it.  Forgot to mix it blend it with the sugar and ended up adding it after I had mixed all the wet items.   Included all the ingredients in the recipe as listed.
Still turned out to be delicious and good looking cookie.  Will mix it correctly according to recipe next time.
Also liked the understated taste of the peanut butter.   Could almost not tell it was there.  Didn't miss the egg at all.  Family approved!

They turned out very good, you can't really taste the peanut butter so I would suggest putting in more. And instead of milk I used half and half.

I added a little extra peanut butter and also chocolate and peanut butter chips and was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. At first, when I checked the cookies at 11 minutes they were falling apart so I had to cook them a little extra, closer to 15 minutes but in the end they are delicious.

This recipe is great!  I used 1/2 c coconut oil and 1/2 c natural peanut butter, substituted oats for the flour, omitted the brown sugar, and used almond milk instead of regular milk.  Also added some white chocolate chips - these cookies are delicious!  Made 2 dozen cookies with this recipe.

My son is allergic to egg whites and milk so I used 2 yolks and omitted the milk and used just a splash of water.  I used homemade pb.  3 out of 4 of us loved these… the son who is allergic not so much.  I baked mine for 11 minutes and let them cool because I prefer cookies soft not crunchy.  They are still a little gooey but will finish cooking as they cool.  I think I gained 5 lbs because I couldn't stop eating them!

Excellent! Just made them and I'm sold!  I was looking for a recipe for cookies, didn't have any eggs but had cocoa and chunky p.b.(love this site for that) I did have to improvise because I only had about 2 1/2 tbl. of butter left so I added in a couple tbl of canola oil and they came out fine.  I also added a little extra cocoa powder and p.b like someone else suggested.  Excellent recipe that can easily be adapted depending on what you have/haven't on hand! will definetly make again!

Love this recipe! Myson can't have eggs so it's great to find a recipe where I don't have to use substitutions.  I doubled the recipe, but ended up with about 100 cookies instead of 48. I used a tablespoon-size scoop, so I'm not sure why, but I'm not complaining about extra cookies. :-) I used 1-1/2 cups each of butter and peanut butter. The peanut butter was just right but we all agreed a little more cocoa would be good next time.

This was a a great eggless base for cookies. I thought It sounded a little dull so I changed it as follows: Subtituted instant choc pudding mix for the cocoa. Added two Tbls sour cream. Added all sorts of add-ins such as 1/2 cup oatmeal, 1/2 cup peanut butter chips, 1/2 cup coconuts. So amazing, don't miss the egg at all.

Had a really big sweet tooth and my guy suggested peanut butter cookies...decided to find something untraditional. This recipe was so simple, the batter very fluffy. They tasted way better than I anticipated!

These are really good! My toddler is allergic to eggs and rarely gets to enjoy baked goods. I'm always on the lookout for egg free recipes so that he can eat what everyone else is eating. I added 1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips to these. Yum!

Liked the recipe but the cookies tend to flow out and result is thin fragile cookies. Wondering if less milk or more flour would help? Would try puting more flour next time. Taste was good.

Very good! I was hesitant at first, but I went ahead and made it. I took another reviewers suggesting by adding extra cocoa and extra vanilla, and they are delicious! You'll need a good size glass of milk, cuz they're not the moistest cookies I've ever had, but they definitely satisfy a sweet tooth and are a good back-up plan when you don't have eggs in the house!!!

These cookies were VERY good.  I am not a big fan of peanut butter, unlike my husband and son, but with the added cocoa they were a bit different.  I also added just under a cup of white chocolate chips to the mix.

This was pretty good to eat and easy to make. The second time I switched peanut butter to almond butter and added 1/2 cup of crush roasted almonds, omitted cocoa powder and cut down some sugar. It was delicious!

I added another 1/3 of the cocoa called for and a tad bit more peanut butter.  A really good cookie for when you only have the regular staples in your kitchen.

These were yum. I rolled mine into balls and squashed them down. I just prefer the round look as opposed to messy dropped look. Turned out great. They plumped up like tiny cakes. I didn't taste too much peanut butter but over all it was fab. Thanks.

I was a bit skeptical of this recipe, but we needed a simple, egg-free cookie recipe. They were easy to make and surprisingly delicious. I used natural peanut butter (the one you need to stir before using) and  it turned out great, and possibly less sweet. I also transferred them to a wire rack for cooling and hardening as soon as I removed them from the oven. The best part is: you can lick all the batter you want!

Pretty awesome for not having eggs! I used half and half instead of milk and added about a cup and a half of peanut butter chips. I'd be a little more liberal on the vanilla - go ahead and add in double.

I really wanted to make cookies and had no eggs, so I looked this up. They are delicious. I didn't have milk either so I had to use water (worst substitute, I know). I can definately see what milk would add to it. Fir my personal preference I think less peanut butter, but I'm not a huge fan of peanut butter to begin with. I'll remember these if I ever bake cookies for something, and will especially reccoend these to other people!

these are very tasty and simple to make. they tasted better the day they were made but I think a longer cooking time would help.
