A quick dinner for busy weeknights! I used large bone-in chops and they came out super tender. There is no oil in this recipe (not sure if that's intentional) but I used about 1 tbsp to brown the chops and then added a bit more once I added the onions and garlic since the pan was a bit dry. I used diced tomatoes as those are easier to work with than whole tomatoes. 1 tablespoon of rosemary seemed like a lot so I halved that and it was plenty. The only other thing I would suggest is if you don't tolerate spicy foods very well to cut back on the red pepper flakes. As suggested I can see the sauce being delicious on pasta but I served mine with veggies. YUM!

I followed the recipe,  the 8 large cloves of minced Garlic was over bearing.  Also no a real Rosemary fan think I will delete that next time and cut the Garlic in half!  But will definitely make it again!

Very much like Pork Chops Pizzaiola. Tasty, simple and can be  served alone or with pasta, potatoes, vegetables, etc. 
Reduced the amount of the garlic and red pepper so as not to over power the dish. Also dded a splash of red wine.
This one goes into the recipe box!

This was wonderful! i used boneless pork chops because they were very economical and they were amazing. My only change was adding a large can of Mushrooms in to the mix! Wonderful flavor and the chops were tender and juicy. I served it all over a bed of streamed green beans. Great Low card meal!

I followed this recipe pretty much to the T other than using boneless skinless chicken breasts and allowing the breasts to simmer in the sauce for about 20-30 mins to completely cook through. I served it with pasta and some freshly grated percorino-romano cheese. Will definitely make again.

Delicious! A reminder that sometimes simple recipes are so satisfying! I didn t have chips but boneless back ribs. I put about a quarter cup of white wine and about 1/2 cup of H2O and allowed it to stew for about 45 minutes on low. We served it on mashed cauliflower.

We reduced the red pepper to one teaspoon which was still plenty spicy. If you are feeding someone who doesn't love spice I recommend going down to only half a teaspoon.

Followed recipe. Chops were bone-in so thought if anything they'd come out a little more on the rare side but they finished really dried out all around the edges even though they were smothered in sauce. Think I'd reduce either the temp or time next go-around. The sauce tasted good. Go liberal with the caper juice. Adds a lot of depth to the flavor.

I will definitely make this again it s the first recipe with pork chops that my husband has ever liked. I didn t add as much red pepper flakes and removed some of the capers I didn t want it to be too spicy. The meat was also very tender. Thank you for this recipe.

Very quick and easy used 1 inch thick pork loin chops and added a good splash of dry vermouth. Served over crushed boiled redskin potatoes and steamed asparagus.

We loved this sauce. I did deglaze the pork chop pan with a bit of red wine and along with the onion & garlic. My pork chops were a bit tough first time so the second time I made this I stewed it a bit longer and then let it set overnight. The pork fell off the bone and the flavor was amazing!
