This would be the recipe I lived on while pregnant.  My daughter and I still eat pasta this way all the time.  It is fast, simple and children love it.  Experiment with the type of cheese you use.  If you can find it, Myzithra cheese is the best.  Keep in mind this recipe is designed for those that can't or don't cook.  If you were looking for something to wow the taste buds and send you into convulsions of pasta pleasure, you probably need to try something a little more complicated.  If you are looking for fast, simple, and easy go with this.

Heather, this seriously is one of my favorite comfort foods. And like Taylor said, I prefer it with garlic powder and just a bit of catsup mixed in. And no, I didn't drink a whole bottle of peppermint schnaps; I believe it was bourbon. Thank you!!

I was just cooking for myself tonight and was planning on just eating buttered noodles, but I stumbled across this recipe when the noodles were boiling and opted to try it out!  I used 4 ounces of bow tie pasta and added a bit over a cup of frozen corn (was finishing off the bag) right before the noodles were finished cooking. While they were draining in the colander I put 1 T leftover garlic butter (light margarine mixed with garlic powder and dried parsley), 1 T leftover white wine and 2 T milk in the pan I'd used to cook the noodles and let that simmer for a minute or so.  Stirred in 1 T freshly grated parmesan (I have one of those little zester graters).  Stirred the noodles and corn back into the sauce along with a healthy dose of pepper, poured it on a plate and grated another tablespoon of parmesan over it.  It made quite a large plate of pasta (could someone seriously eat 8 ounces like the recipe says?) and was delicious!  Better than plain buttered noodles and quite delicate.  I don't think it was too unhealthy, either (the light margarine had 5 g fat, the parmesan had about 4, then whatever fat was in the noodles and corn).  I really liked the corn with it, too.  I will definitely make this in the future, thanks for the idea!

gotta say, I lived off this in college too! Even works with the cheese from a green can, if necessary (it's cheaper). Throw in some cooked frozen broccoli to make your mom happy, too!

This was alright... a little plain. We added onions and ham, trying to spruce it up a little, but not to much avail.

My family rates this recipe as 5 stars.  I do recommend doubling the sauce for a pound of pasta.  (We like to dip our bread in it;-D)

Pretty dang good for being so simple! I followed the recipe as written except I only cooked up about 8 oz of pasta...definitely double the sauce if you plan on cooking up the whole 16 oz. Next time I think I'll thicken the sauce with a bit with flour, as it was a little runny, and I'll use garlic powder instead of garlic salt; it made it just a tad too salty for my taste.

My 15 year old daughter wanted to make dinner last night and we found this recipe.  I was shocked how great it tasted and how easy it was for her to make! We didn't have garlic salt so she threw in a little bit of Kosher salt and some garlic powder.  It really was fantastic...a very pleasant surprise

If you add a little olive oil, it takes it over the top. I have been eating angel hair this way for years, but always add a little garlic.

Pretty tasty.  :)  I don't know if I would consider it "gourmet" LOL or not.  :)  I doubled the sauce and am glad I did.  I had a feeling it would be too dry if I didn't.  Also, I used whole wheat spring pasta.

This was tasty and simple, perfect for a no-frills cook like me. I was worried about the pasta tasting too salty, so I used garlic powder per one of the reviewer's suggestions. It tasted very good, and it's a superb alternative to the same ol' red sauce. Next time, I'll add a few veggies.

Used 8 oz. Pastina, added our usual garlic and onion powders, subbed ketchup for the milk and had a lovely little lunch with Linda McLean, who ate about 18 Deep Fried Oreos and drank an entire bottle of Peppermint Schnapps while I was slaving over this favorite recipe of hers. I think next time I'll lock the liquor cabinet and use the milk instead of the ketchup... or take her out to lunch instead. Thanks, Heather:)

This recipe was a little too easy. It was a little blah, so I decided to add a little more salt and some peas and broccoli. It turned out a little better that way. I like how this recipe is very adaptable, and it great how you can throw in your own choice of vegetables or meat!

Family loved it :)  I doubled the recipe for one box of penne.  Whisked in 1 tsp flour to milk/butter mixture, to thicken it slightly.  Also added steamed broccoli florets and 1 sliced, pan-fried chicken breast (I pounded it flat, seasoned w/ salt/pepper and browned in olive oil) If you love garlic, put in full amount... I personally could use a little less.  It was DELISH!

Mmmm.  So easy and declious.  Definitely not gourmet and that's what we loved about it.  The kids ignored the pork and veggies and filled up on this.  That's okay, we'll just make it once in a while.  Thank you!  :-)

In college I did a similar recipe all the time. I used a little olive oil, parmesan cheese (from the green can), fresh ground mixed peppercorns (easy to find in the spice section with a grinder built in the bottle), and garlic salt. I also used whole wheat pasta a lot. Chicken would also be a good add to this recipe.

I thought this would taste like "Pasta Roni's Parmesan Pasta", but it didn't have the same flavor. I only used 7oz. pasta but kept the milk and cheese the same. I might have overcooked my sauce because my pasta took forever to cook. I made this for my kids, one out of two ate it. I don't think I would make it again. It would be better if you added some herbs to it. I only used one tablespoon butter for the sauce and used the other tablespoon to toss in the pasta when it was done (good thing I reserved some of the plain buttered pasta for the kid that wouldn't eat it!)

Definitely not enough sauce for my liking.  And I tend to like my sauce thick.  It was also too garlic-y.

This was the first good recipe I've found that doesn't require much cheese.  I used soy milk and a tablespoon of soy cream cheese instead of the parm due to dairy allergies.  Everyone loved it!

I've made this for years, I just called it Poverty Pasta because we usually make it before payday. 
The only thing I do differently is leave out the milk, and use garlic powder, not salt then add the S&P separate.
It's super quick when you are limited on time, too. Add frozen peas to the pasta water when cooking and then you have your veggies too.
Another reviewer had it right, this isn't meant to be "gourmet",just good when you need it.

This was a good starter recipe.  It needs double the sauce and triple the garlic.

So simple, and just delicious.  I made the following modifications.  I did not have garlic salt, so I used garlic powder and added a bit of salt and pepper.  I also doubled the parmesan and recommend using a good parmesan (not the green container stuff that has been sitting in your fridge).  I only had skim milk on hand and it was fine, but next time I will use half n' half.  This is so much easier then my usual alfredo and really just as good. I suggest tossing it with some tortellini and pairing with a green veggie and some kielbasa. THANKS

I didn't actually make this exactly as described. I added 1 egg yoke(for a creamier texture) and about 5 times as much parmesan. Instead of garlic salt, I used 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder and 1/8 teaspoon of salt. I also added cracked pepper before serving. It was pretty good. I'l be making it again since it was so easy. Took me about 10 minutes to make it.

So quick and easy.  Great side dish.  All five of my kids loved it and it's hard to get all five kids to like the same thing.  Will serve again.

This was alright...a little too milky tasting for me, I tried adding some shredded cheese to give it some more flavor but it didn't really help.

A very basic carbonara without the ham.
