I liked that it wasn't terribly sweet, as many daiquiris are, but I couldn't taste the banana flavor enough.  If I were to make again, I'd most likely double the banana and increase the triple sec as well.

We thought this was good! I chunked up my bananas and froze them to eliminate using the ice and watering down the drink, which works perfectly. The flavor was good, but I took the advice of the previous reviewer and added more banana than called for to get a stronger banana taste. This will be great for the summertime! Thanks for sharing. :)

I omitted the sugar, instead I added 1 ounce of vanilla coffee cream.  Instead of ice I used frozen bananas topped it with whipped cream and a cherry,

I was using up some baby bananas,  so it may have shifted the flavors but I found it a bit bland. Second batch I shifted to Gossling's dark rum and added a splash of stone's ginger wine which seemed to bring out more banana flavor.

Only so-so. I followed the recipe exactly but it was too sour. I added another whole banana and more sugar, which made it drinkable. The lime juice was too overpowering.
