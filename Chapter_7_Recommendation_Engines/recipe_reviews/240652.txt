I can never follow a recipe straight so here are the changes I made. 

I marinated the paneer in yogurt and Tandoori Masala and fried it in butter with the bell pepper.
I made the gravy pretty much the way described except I cooked with vegetable oil and added a little honey to it and finished it with Kasoori Methi. 
I added the paneer and peppers at the end.
I also added a little heavy cream at the end (instead of half and half). 
I will make it again. Good recipe. It actually looks like a restaurant dish.

Not bad for a basic recipe. I would suggest cooking the pepper, onion, and garlic for a lot longer, until the onion is golden brown. I also added about a 1/2 tsp of sugar, and could have added more. That was a big key to getting it to taste like a restaurant version.

This was excellent.  I accidentally left out the cashews (but it didn't make a difference in my opinion and saved some cash).  I added some peas and an extra bell pepper to give it something other than paneer and sauce.

Gobsmacking good. My vegetarian wife wanted to lick the skillet clean. Added 1/2 tsp. turmeric just cause never saw an Indian recipe like this that didn’t have it. Generous in my measurements on the other spices. Could not find paneer, so substituted queso and tofu, which I think was the only tiny drawback. I’m going to make paneer next time, which will be very soon.

It is a good recipe, that is very easy to cook. I made it several times now and rate it 4 stars, not five because I have made some adjustments to improve the recipe. I had to double the amounts of

Perfect! Instead of chicken, I used paneer. I also added chopped jalapenos and green peppers with the onions. Great recipe! (It's spicy!)
