This is a nice refreshing summer side. I used red onion for contrast and light sour cream to lighten it up. I felt it needed a touch of salt but otherwise it was good as written. I served it over a bed of greens with cherry tomatoes scattered around.

Needs lots of salt& pepper. Add an extra cucumber & extra vinegar, otherwise bland. I used 1/2 of an 8 oz container of sour cream & was still too much.
