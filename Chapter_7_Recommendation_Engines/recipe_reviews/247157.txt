I have been searching for a recipe similar to what we enjoy in a local Vietnamese restaurant. I liked the idea of letting everyone top their noodles as they preferred, so I set out bowls of shredded veggies (carrots, cabbage, green onions, etc) coarsely crushed peanuts, fresh chopped cilantro, diced cooked meat (beef, chicken or shrimp,etc) and a bottle of sriracha sauce for extra flavor and heat. This is a fun meal to serve! Also, I have served the noodles in a spicy broth, with same toppings. Either way, itâ€™s wonderful.

Fresh and delicious! I used soba noodles because I didn't have any glass noodles. This recipe is perfect for a buffet style meal so everyone can pick and choose the ingredients and their amounts as desired. The sauce is delicious as is, then I added a bit of rice vinegar, fermented bean paste, and hot chilies to the sauce. Thank you for the recipe.

This is delicious!  It's kinda like a fresh spring roll without the roll.  I added shrimp and pork to make it a little more filling.  I think it could have been improved with a different sauce that was thicker and richer than soy sauce -like some sort of teriyaki, stir fry or peanut sauce-, but as is, this is really really good.
