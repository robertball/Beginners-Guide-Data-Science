Very delicous, it was simple, yet elegant. Although there was a little overload on the peppers, and too little tomatoes. I also used ranch dressing instead because it tastes better. This recipe isnt really anything special though.

My mother used to make this with cucumbers instead of peppers.  It was always one of my favorite side dishes!
