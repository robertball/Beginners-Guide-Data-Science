I make this about once a week now.  It is absolutely delicious.  I do not cook the onions, I thin slice some of one raw.  Getting a bit of everything in one bite is heaven.

This was tasty and not nearly as garlicky as I thought it would be. I used blue cheese because I had it on hand, but next time I'll use the feta and add some oregano, as well as more onions. I used raw, shredded beets, and I added red wine vinegar to pump up the flavor a bit.

I just tried this recipe and my husband and I loved it!  I will definitely be making this again.  I just eye-balled the amount of feta as I think that's more based on personal taste and I didn't add any salt because the feta had enough. Thanks for this tasty and easy recipe!

A great way to kick up a plain old can of beets! It's quick, with few ingredients but tastes like a lot more time went into it. Don't be afraid of the onion and garlic -the flavors totally mellow once cooked. This makes enough for 4 small sides. Nice presentation. A keeper.

I have made this recipie several times. It tastes great, but I would recommnd leaving a little of the beet juice in the mixture because it gets a little dry.

BEST BEET SALAD!!!  I have to admit changing it to my taste though.  I prefer herbed goat cheese to feta and I served it over arugula.  This combination, with the herbs from the cheese, required no additional seasoning.   GREAT SIDE DISH and very festive looking for holidays.

I made this and was a little disappointed. It was okay but not great. I don't think that I will make this again.

Was very disappointed. Thought this would be good, but it just wasn't. I served it on a bed of shredded lettuce for extra color which looked pretty. We added some vinegar for extra flavor, but it still needed something. Won't be making this again.

I did not care for this recipe. Is the amount of garlic shown incorrectly?  It had many good reviews so I am a little mystified.

Very good salad.  I made a slight change.  I added a little balsamic vinegar.  Any mild vinegar would work.  Just gave it a little zing.  I did use freshly baked beets instead of canned.
