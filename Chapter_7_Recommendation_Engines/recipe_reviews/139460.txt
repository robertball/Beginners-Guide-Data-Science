This is a great martini.  For those who don't know what a lychee is, it's an asian fruit.  To me, it tastes like grapefruit and pears, with the texture of a canned pear.  The peach schnapps goes great with the lychee.  I didn't have the white cranberry juice, so I just used all lychee juice.

I used 3 oz of vodka & omitted the peach schnapps. I also shook it w/ crushed ice instead of cubes because it'll make the drink a bit thicker & frostier using crushed ice. Took a sip & then added a tsp or so of simple syrup (equal amounts sugar & water boiled for a couple of minutes to dissolve the sugar...allow to cool). That not only sweetened up the drink but brought out the flavor of the lychees.  Thsi went great w/ Bobby Flay's Chinese Chicken Salad...thanks for the recipe!

These are quite good. I didn't have peach schnapps, so ended up adding a bit more lychee juice. This helped keep it from being too strong, as the Vodka I had on hand has quite a distinct flavor on its own. I also didn't have white cranberry juice, but used the regular red kind. It ended up a nice light pink color.

I think I might try this with gin, by adding a bit of lychee juice to a gin and tonic, and adding a lychee for garnish.

I had a lychee martini at a Thai restaurant in Chicago and fell in love!  This recipe tastes exactly like theirs if you omit the peach schnapps.

As I read this, I am imbibing a lychee martini (well, actually, I only had the can of lychees and some cheap vodka..lol) but technically, you're supposed to use fresh or frozen lychees, not canned.  Still, love these things!

Very good mix! I tried another simple recipe for lychee martini and thought it was too strong. So I referred to this one and ran back to the store to get the extra ingredients! It was great!

This was the favorite among the various martinis we tried. I substituted Patrons Citronge for peach schnapps, and red cranberry instead of white cranberry  - this gave nice rose tint to the drink. I also garnished it with a mint leaf. Excellent!

This are yummy, but very strong. I added an extra half shot of cranberry juice and a little grenadine to tone it down.  I highly recommend!
