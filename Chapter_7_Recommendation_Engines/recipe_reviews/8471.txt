I love this cake.  I crave it.  After reading the reviews stating that the ricotta layer falls to the bottom of the cake, I decided to plan for it by using a bundt pan instead of a 9" x 13" pan and made half the ricotta mixture (and added almond extract to the cake mix as well as 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 almond extract to the ricotta mixture), spooning it all over the top of the cake mixture.  Baked as directed in the recipe, inverted onto a plate after it had cooled a bit and then sifted powdered sugar over the top after it had cooled completely.  It makes a gorgeous cake, 1/2 moist yellow cake on bottom and 1/2 delicious ricotta layer on top.  Yum!

This is SO easy and SO delicious.  The ricotta settles to the bottom, so don't be alarmed--that's what makes it so good!  I get raves no matter where I take it.  My husband likes it warm right out of the oven, but I prefer it cold.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!!

Excellent!  I like it so much that I've made it 3 times in the past month.  The first time I only used half the ricotta mixture & thought it was great.  Then I followed the recipe & it was incredible!!  The 3rd time I added some fresh blueberries (put on top before baking).  The blueberries made it look wierd, but once cut it looked good.  I'm addicted!  Thanks to other reviewers for the warning that the ricotta mixture falls to the bottom.  I invert it on a platter after baking so the ricotta is on top.  Yum!

I've been making Ricotta Cake for quite awhile now, it's one of my husband's favorites. Recently I miss placed my recipe for it, and while trying to replace it came upon this version, and as far as i can tell it's identical to my previous one. However since it had been awhile since i last made this i wasnt thinking, and of course didnt properly read the recipe so i made the mistake of mixing all the ingredients at the same time... i was worried but decided to try it... it didnt turn out too bad and i would recommend this method for anyone who wants to avoid the "wet cake" texture. My mistake turned out a cake that was slightly more of a sponge consistency, but still retained the ricotta flavor, I perferr the traditional method but this "oops" was also good... and saved quite a few steps, all ingredients mixed in one bowl and then into the baking dish... alot less clean up too!

Our family has made this for years with Marble cake mix.  and we add Almond extract instead of vanilla.  I think you have a mistake though in your recipe:  It wouldn't be an additional 4 eggs, but only 1 additional egg (to the ricotta mixture), the other 3 are in the cake mix.

Ok so I made the cake as directed (using 3/4 of the ricotta listed and 3/4 of the eggs listed and added a litlle more vanilla to ricotta mixture).  The cake came out great but I learned the hard way that you have to place a cookie sheet underneath the cake pan to catch the overflow that caused a brief smoke party in my oven.  After scrubbing out the bottom of the stove, the cake baking was back on track.  The cake was getting dark after about 45 minutes so I turned temp down to 305 degrees for 30 minutes and back up to listed temp for another 5 minutes.  I tried it warm (cooling for 15 minutes) and it was great.  I actually iced the cake with store bought icing and placed in fridge and it was even better today.  I would definitely make again.

Excellent!  I only used half the ricotta mixture (that's all the ricotta I had in the house).  I made it in 2 small pans instead of a 13x9 & it cooked in 45 minutes.  I brought it to a picnic at my parents house- everyone (ages 2 to 90)loved it.  Nice for a hot day, not too sweet.

I can think of a thousand ways to fancy this cake up for company or a holiday but...it's perfect just the way it is. My husband also loved it warm right out of the oven. I'm thinking a thickened pineapple or apricot fruit sauce would be wonderful. Going to try making this using a chocolate cake mix.

This is a wonderful cake.  The ricotta mixture does sink to the bottom of the cake but it is delicious.  I actually tasted this or a similar cake at a dinner party and wanted the recipe.  I was so happy to find this.  Also it is so simple to make.  I will definately make this again and again!

This was aweome!  Super moist!  I have made similar cakes using sour cream, but it doesn't compare to the ricotta!  I only had half the ricotta the recipe called for on hand, so I halfed the ricotta mixture and it was still fabulous!  I recommend this cake to everyone.

This cake is good as written but, is delicious if you add fruit on top of the ricotta mixture, I added crushed darained pineapple to half of the cake just to try it both ways, I brought it to a family brunch and everybody loved it and agreed that the half with pineapple was ten times better. I also followed other reviewers suggestions and added one tsp. of almond extract to each the batter and the filling.I WILL DEFINATELY MAKE THIS AGAIN but will definately add pineapple maybe next time I'll try blueberries...This is a 5 star recipe with fruit, try it you wont be disapointed, sooo yumy.Thanks Sandy for sumitting your delicious recipe.

Exceptional and made with a chocolate cake mix it is devine !. When I make this cake I use instant pudding prepared with directions on the box and add about 1 cup of cool whip..Fold in the cool whip after the pudding sets a little and then use it for the icing-WOW.. can't beat it- Chocolate for the Chocolate ricotta cake and vanilla for this one..

When, I think, Duncan Hines first brought this recipe out many years ago it became a favorite of my mother's and one I often enjoyed also. I had lost the recipe and could not remember it entirely -  am very happy to be reunited with an easy and yummy cake! We used to cut very small pieces and serve in multi colored cupcake liners for a festive party dessert. The cake is very rich and dense so you don't need to serve a regular sized piece. Can vary your flavorings also, for a twist on the taste.

Try Lemon cake mix, also chocolate!  It's DELICIOUS and EASY...and always gets loads of compliments.  I've been making this cake for years and years....love it so much I wanted it as our wedding cake but was too moist to hold up in tall layers.  Does not need icing, powered sugar over a doily makes it very pretty.  Keeps well in the refrigerator and is always yummy to the last bite.

This is pretty yummy... it's best made with the full-fat ricotta and eaten cold. Resist the temptation to use a bundt pan (disastrous). Pieces cut out of the 9x13" pan, while boring to look at, were so much more moist (not soggy) and consistent in textures. Ridiculously easy as well...

This is a delicious cake and exactly what I was looking for! It is definitely different than just any old cake. I used my springform cheesecake tin lined with parchment paper. Some changes I made: I added the zest of one orange and chopped, toasted, walnuts to the ricotta mixture. When the cake was done, I flipped the cake so that the ricotta ended up on top. I topped it with a mixture that included 4 tbsp of apricot jam and 2 tbsp of brandy. Instead of walnuts you could also add toasted, chopped, or shaved almonds. This is a perfect dessert if you don't want something too sweet. It's just too good!

I like this cake because it's very versatile.  And as usual I had to substitute for what I had on hand.  This is what I did:  Used a Lemon cake mix with 1lb. ricotta cheese and 8oz. softened cream cheese. Then I used lemon extract instead of vanilla.  The results were wonderful and because I used half cream cheese it didn't have any standing moisture in the bottom.  I also used the Lemon cream cheese frosting off this site as well.  Next time I'm going to experiment with strawberry flavors!  So glad you shared this recipe!

Excellent!!!! This was my Italian grandmas favorite. The reviews are right on..DO NOT EAT UNTILL COLD(NEXT DAY)!  I could not wait and was dissappointed at first, but finished the cake in a few days...mostly alone. I used yellow cake mix as stated, but will for sure try lemon or orange mix next time and pineapple pieces would great as suggested above. I will not be making this for a long time b/c I know I cannot resist it!

This cake is great! My brother and I are always looking for unusual recipes and we like to try the ones we find durinf holidays and special occassions. I made this one for his birthday.  The first time I made it using the yellow cake mix. I used 1/4cup of sugar instead of 3/4cup. This made the cake very mild and not overly sweet. Everyone really enjoyed this. The second time I made it I use a chocolate cake mix and the 3/4cups of sugar. I also set out a warmed fudge topping that some used to drizzle over thier slice. Oh my goodness this cake was amazing! I was going to take a photo but it was gone before I had a chance to snap a photo.   Cool vs Warm: This is a matter of preference really. I liked the yellow cake best warm but the chocolate one I perfered more cooled with the hot fudge drizzle. Either way this is an amazing cake.

Love ricotta so I tried this cake. It is wonderful. I made it when I had company because it is a very rich cake. I also added mini chocolate chips in the cheese. Everyone loved the cake so much they took home a extra slice. Would recommend this to everyone.

OK .  I had to changed this quite a bit due to substituting the sugars for "sweetners".  
Keeping that in mind,  I started with a 'scratch cake" (Allrecipes Cake Mixes from Scratch and Variations) only used 1 cup of ricotta, 1 egg, tsp vanilla, and 1/4 tsp of Almond extract and a little bit of sweetner.  I did little spoonfuls all around the cake. The cake was done in abt 1/2 hour. OMG! What a yummy cake.  The ricotta didn't fall to the bottom (fyi) I think a 16oz container would be the perfect ratio for this type of cake. A definite keep..... Oh, cupcakes.... gonna try it with cupcakes!  To be continued....  :-)

First I want to say only use 4 eggs total, 3 in cake mix and 1 in ricotta mix. The owner of this recipe should make this more clear, the ricotta mixture ingredients do say "eggs".

This cake us awesome. I altered none of the recipe. Why?

I must be the only one who didn't think this cake was fantastic. I thought it was OK but nothing great. I did have a huge amount of the ricotta mixture left over so if I do try it again, I will make only half of that.

Everyone asks for this cake!  If its a holiday, birthday or just a get together...friends and family want this outrageously delicious cake. It's so easy to make and you don't have to change a thing to the recipe. I wish I had a dollar for everytime I'm asked for this recipe.  I even had a woman from Italy ask me for the recipe! That's when I knew this was the "real" thing!!  (I also make a lite version:  fat free ricotta, egg substitute and sugar substitute.)

I made this cake for the first time on Easter. I made it the night before and served it chilled. My guests loved it.  I read the other reviews about the ricotta dropping to the bottom of the pan so I made mine in an angel food cake pan and when it cooled I inverted it on a serving platter. It was perfect. I made the recipe exactly as it was written. I always make goody bags for my kids when they are leaving and they all asked for some of the ricotta cake, I guess this will be a new addition to my holiday tables :)

I have been looking at this recipe for months.  We are not big fans of ricotta, but I thought we would give this a whirl.  Remember that you cook your cake mix according to the directions for me this recipe took a total of 7 eggs.  The ricotta mixture is more like an egg custard then a cheese cake.  If you like egg custard you will love this cake.  The flavor is delicate and I liked it.  I can see why people love this with a fruit topping.  This cake would be the perfect foil for that.  Next time I will NOT do this in a bundt pan.  Although the presentation was pretty I did have issue with it getting out of the pan.  Also, it took a lot longer to bake- almost 30 minutes more.  I also think this is one of those recipe where you want to use good quality cheese and cake mix.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  I love to try new things and can not believe that I have never had this.

This was awesome and more like a breakfast pastry in my opinion with a lot of creamy filling!  I tried first in a mini-bundt pan by making 1/4 of the recipe and baking 30 minutes.  It was awesome so I went ahead and made the remaining 3/4 recipe in a normal size bundt pan and baked for 1 hour.  My family enjoyed this cake too, even the ones that aren't typically ricotta fans.  I had tried a chocolate peanut butter frosting on the mini cake, but found it didn't really go and the cake doesn't need a frosting with it's creaminess (it's like the frosting is built in!)  EXCELLENT!  Only things I changed were to use unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil called for on the cake mix package and used 1 egg white in place of each egg called for.  I used low-fat ricotta and had 22 oz total rather than the 32 oz called for.

Made this for company this week-end, and it was delicious! Used lemon cake mix, and it was light and moist. Followed other reviewers, and made it a couple of days ahead of time, and the flavor of the ricotta filling was outstanding! A definite keeper.

This is the exact recipe that I've been using for years, except that my recipe states to bake it for 1 hour.  I've never had it run over the pan. I chill it when it's cool, then cut it in squares and serve it, dusted with powdered sugar, on cupcake papers. Although it's NOT lo-cal, it's light and cool, kind of like a cream puff. I think I'll make it for company this week.

Save this cake for the next day! Like the other reviews suggested, I made these the night before a party. I made them as cupcakes, and rolled the tops in powdered sugar. They were gorgeous, moist, and seemed like they were filled with cheesecake! I um...might have eaten one for breakfast the next day too...they are delicious!

AWESOME!!!! I used a white cake mix, and used almond extract and burbon vanilla as others had suggested. I also baked the cake in a bundt pan and used only half of the ricotta mixture. Any more the cake would have overflowed from the pan. I filled the middle with strawberries and fresh mint before dusting with powdered sugar. I also served a strawberry champagne sauce over the cake once we sliced it. It was a little tart so it balanced out the sweetness. There was barely any left!!!!

this cake was good though I did change the recipe a bit.instead of using yellow cake mix I used a marble cake mix and instead of using vinilla extract I used Anise extract to give it a bit of a kick. Came out good very moist. i kept it in the fridge for it to get a bit more firmer. I will definatly try the original recipe only because I had the marble cake instead of the yellow cake. Good evening dessert for the family...Thanks for sharing...

Like other reviewers, I mixed some of the ricotta mixture in with the cake batter, then laid the rest on top when it was time to put it in the oven. I made a strawberry sauce to go over it and served it with ice cream on the side. My husband and guests loved it. Thanks!

I made this cake exactly as stated in the recipe and it turned out perfect.  However, for me, the ricotta is just a little too grainy even tho I beat it in the mixer for a while.  It was moist and kept well in the fridge.  I did make a cream cheese icing for it and that helped.

This cake is certianly a crowd pleaser!!  Everytime I take it somewhere, people ask for the recipe!  I like to add a little cinnamon (about 1/2 tsp.) to the ricotta mixture.

Definitely enjoyed this cake as did my friends! I wanted something to do with the left over Ricotta and this recipe did the trick!  I only used 1 pound of Ricotta and added 1/4tbs of vanilla to the cake batter and ricotta mix. I made a bundt cake and had a good amount left over to experiment with. I halved the left overs. With one half I added Ghirardelli cocoa and created a marble cake. Both cakes turned out well but the little marble cake was the best, wish I had marbled the bundt cake as well.  I powered the bundt cake but didn't care for it that much so made a chocolate glaze and it was excellent. You can still see remnants of the sugar dusting in the picture.

Almond-Ginger-Orange version.  Thanks to the tips re the ricotta sinking, I decided to take advantage of that.  I prepared my pan with butter spray and then laid down almond slices much like you would pineapple for a P-upside down cake.  I knew this would end up on the top after flipping and be held in place by the ricotta.  You could probably use slivers or even whole almonds.  As another reviewer, I used 1/2 of David's Yellow Cake from this site for the base.  I then used the egg whites for the ricotta to use them up and make this lighter.  I add the grated peel of one orange to the ricotta and some ginger.  Perhaps 1/4 tsp?  I think next time I will add some almond flavoring and 1/2 tsp ginger to this.  I used lite ricotta and added 2 Tbs. of flour too make sure I had good body for this layer.  It flipped beautifully and the almonds stayed pretty well in place, so you could do a design.  Even sprinkling with powdered sugar didn't hide them.  This is a nice snacking cake and my version is easy to pick up with the fingers.

I made it with "David's Yellow Cake" from this site, instead of a cake mix. Since the yellow cake recipe calls for 8 egg yolks, I mixed the ricotta with 8 egg whites instead of 4 eggs. It came out great.

very disappointed- made for family Easter gathering and only one person liked it - very bland-nothing special. Even tried topping with blackberries- ended up just eating the berries- not worth the calories to eat the cake

I really like this recipe.  It's not too sugary sweet.  I start by adding crushed (drained first) pineapple to the bottom of the pan, then pour the cake mix on top.  I mix the cheese mixture right into the batter.  After it is finished baking, I freeze it over night.  This keeps it extra moist.  I invert it onto a cookie sheet, cut, eat and enjoy.

Very easy, simple cake.  Got worried after I put it in the oven that I had put in too many eggs, that the 4 eggs in the recipe also included the 3 in the cake mix, as the ricotta/eggs mixture was quite soupy, but 7 total eggs total seemed to do the trick after all!  I added blueberries on top of the riccotta on half the cake and they sunk down with the cheese mixture.  While both sides were good, I preferred the blueberry side, but that is just a personal preference. Will definately make again.

I make often as it's a favorite.  I make as is.  Because you refrigerate because of the cheese it's good for the summer. Discovered this cake when a friend made and I wanted her recipe.  Didn't even know it was ricotta.  Im actually making for fathers day this wkend.

This cake was a little too rich for my taste and I felt that it was more like a light cheesecakse with a cakey base rather than a crust. That being said I enjoyed it more while it was cold rather than warm.

This cake was not for me. Sorry! I really enjoy cheese, but the yellow cake and ricotta combination did not work for me or my family. Very disapointed after reading so many wonderful reviews. I will not be making this again.

This is a great cake.  I made it with a lemon cake mix and it turned out well.  I did have to pull it out 15 min earlier than suggested.  I'd suggest keeping an eye on it rather than go by the baking times.  Thanks for a good recipe!

This cake is excellent. I've made it several times, from the standard recipe and several times with a few changes. I've added organge zest and a splash of orange liquor to the ricotta. I've also added Chambord liquor and fresh raspberries, almond flavoring and ground almonds- the possbilities are endless. My next cake will have ground hazlenuts and Frangelico liquor!

The bottom half is really good. It is so moist, but the top just tastes like dry white cake. If there was a way for the ricotta cheese to stay even within the cake than it would be a 5 star cake. And its expensive to make for the ricotta cheese. Just eat the bottom half and its worth it.

This recipe was okay - but not great.  It just tasted too cake-mixy for me.  One tip - I cooked it through - the complaints that the ricotta is too "eggy" in texture is likely because the cake wasn't cooked long enough.

This is a fun, easy recipe.  Mine took an extra
1/2 hour in the oven though, and I turned temp. down to avoid getting too dark.  I'm thinking a fruit glaze would be great on this.

I have made ths recipe several times and have used different flavours of cake mixes and they have all turned out wonderfully!!  We love this cake and I will continue making it.  Some of the reviews said they added fruit (i.e., blueberries) and I think I will give that a try as well.  Love it!!

Made it for a party yesterday...it was nice, moist, but nothing as great as the other reviewers seemed to think.  I think, if I make it again, I would add a flavoring to the ricotta mixture, other than vanilla,  perhaps some Sambuca or almond extracts...just to jazz it up!

My whole family loved this cake. It is very moist and has just the right amount of sweetness. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added a teaspoon of almond extract to the ricotta mixture, and served with whipped cream and fresh berries. The ricotta did not fall to the bottom for me, but fell to the middle which was perfect.

This is quite good, but not exactly what I was hoping for. My ex husband's Italian Grandmother used to make a Ricotta cake that was better, but sadly I didn't get her recipe before she passed away. Hers was lighter and fluffier, this one was quite dense.

Delicious and beautiful and easy to make!  I used a bundt cake pan with half of the recipe for the ricotta portion, because that's what I had on hand.  I filled the center to overflowing with sliced strawberries and dusted powdered sugar on top - it was stunning!

I have always thought cake & ricotta should get married, so I was all over this recipe when I saw it. SO good! Definitely better the next day. I halved the recipe for the ricotta mixture, used a white cake mix (using 2 whole eggs & one egg white), and added at least a teaspoon of almond flavoring instead of the vanilla. Delicious with fresh strawberries! I will do the same next time, or try it with chocolate cake mix & use vanilla.

Wonderful desert served cold.  Tried it straight out of the oven and had no flavor to me.  But the next day, after refriderating over night, it was awesome.

very good cake, even my husband and his friend that were reluctant to try it loved it. i tried it with the yellow and devils food cake mix. ppl said it tasted like a creamy brownie. o and at first when it came out of the oven i tried it, i thot the ricotta mix a lil bland, but after it cooled it was more flavorful, so let it set for a lil while and you'll like it even more!

This cake was just ok. It didn't have much flavor at all and the ricotta just added a creaminess to the bottom of it and that's it. If I make this again I will definitely add a lot of my own ideas to make this better.

I'm sorry, but this cake had little flavor. It was soggy, and mushy.  I followed the directions exactly.  I can see if you used maybe half the cheese mixture, with the full amount of sugar how it might be better.  We ate this hot, then decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and tried it cold.  It was marginally better cold, but still didn't have much flavor.

I'm not sure what all the rave is about. The only thing I did differently was add fresh blueberries to the cake mix. It's hard to describe the texture, and the taste was like eating bread. I was expecting more of a cheesecake flavor. Not so impressed with this one.

This was wonderful!  It got brown fast but then stopped browning!  I followed the recipe as written and tried it warm - SO good!  I had some pineapple ice cream topping and on my second piece (!) I put some of that on the plate - yummy, but I think it's best on it's own! 
Thanks for the great recipe - SO easy!

Although my guests and my son (6) enjoyed it as a birthday cake, I expected more.  I did not reall all the reviews and did not realize the ricotta would fall to the bottom.  Also, it says to drop it by spoonfulls into the cake.  I found that very difficult to do since 2 pounds of ricotta mixed with the eggs is enough to fill 1/2 of a 9x13 cake pan on it's own.  And also, the recipe should also say to add the extra number of eggs as required for the mix.  I had 5 eggs on hand and the recipe called for 4.  But the cake mix called for 3 on it's own so it was really 7 total.

I've made this several times and always get raves! It's so moist. Try cutting the cake into squares and serving in paper cupcake liners. People will think they come from a fine bakery!!

I did not care for this recipe.  The ricotta filling collected in the center of the cake and had a very "eggy" consistency, instead of smooth and creamy ricotta.  It also did not seem to blend at all with the cake, so the result was a basic yellow cake with a grainy, eggy, ricotta filling.  Perhaps this would work better with fewer eggs, but I think in the future I'll just go with a traditional ricotta pie.  Sorry!

I made this exactly according to recipe and it cooked up properly and looked great. I think it turned out the way it was supposed to but I just did not think it was very good ---  quite bland warm or cold. Also it is rather expensive with the 2lbs of ricotta and 7 eggs so it should be spectacular. I think I will stick with cakes that infuse cream cheese or sourcream like the "too much chocolate cake" recipe found on these forums.

I'm so happy with this.  As a diabetic, I used one of the new sugar free yellow cake mixes (actually I halved the recipe), and substituted Splenda for the 1/4 cup sugar in the cheese mix.  Many thanks for the great recipe.

With 1/2 tsp almond flavoring in both the batter and the ricotta---YUM!!  Good served with fresh fruit.  A little bit too much batter for 2 9" round pans.

Very quick and very easy! Moist and keeps for a few days no problem. You can cut the pieces smaller than a regular cake because it is very filling with the huge amount of eggs in this cake! Mmmmmm!

I have been looking for a recipe like this and am so glad I found it.  THis cake is not too sweet, but is totally delicious.  We used the recipe for Sicilian Ricotta Cheese from Allrecipes that we made for my son's science project.    We will do both again.

Absolutely wonderful.  I only used 1 pound of ricotta and 2 eggs, baked in 2, 8x8 pans and it was delicious.  Next time I plan to throw some blackberries in the bottom of the pan first.  I served with whipped cream and it was so yummy.  I will buy ricotta next time just to make this instead of waiting to have leftovers.

Cake is surprisingly moist; however, it had no flavor the day it was baked. Rather than throw it in the trash, I covered it and in the refrigerator it went. Day 3 was a totally different story. The cake was DELICIOUS and very tasty! In fact, I went back for seconds and thirds later that evening. Using allrecipes calculator, I halved the recipe for two people. It took some figuring, though, when it came to measurements for half a pkg of 18.25 oz classic yellow cake mix. Used 1/2 c + 2-1/2 Tbsp water, 2-1/2 Tbsp veggie oil and 2 eggs. Since this was the first time I used ricotta, I had no idea what to expect for the taste. When cake first came out of oven and cooled down, I thought maybe the Ricotta had gotten bad as it stayed sealed in the frig for about 6 months. Topping cake with (French Vanilla) pudding/cool whip mixture, as Super Chef suggested, made this cake a KEEPER! Thanks for the challenge.

I've made this a couple of times already. It's a fabulous recipe: it's easy, it looks impressive, tastes great (not too sweet), and keeps well for a few days.  I've also made it using chocolate cake mix and actually like it better! The chocolate one comes out with a dark layer and a white layer, and another very thin dark layer.  Looks cool. My family ate it plain, but I dusted it with powdered sugar for guests.

Absolutly great!!!!  I made this as a birthday cake and it was a huge hit.  The ricotta bakes into a creamy layer that goes so well with the cake, like a baked in icing.

I was skeptical of this recipe because of the amount of ricotta and eggs used. But...it is sooooo good! I followed recipe exactly except for adding blueberries on top before baking and everyone loved it. I served it with the vanilla sauce recipe on this site and they went very well together. I can't wait to try this with chocolate or maybe lemon cake mix. YUM!!

I halved this recipe and used a small Jiffy yellow cake mix. It made a 9" round cake.  I also used Splenda in the ricotta instead of sugar; then topped it off with fresh blueberry sauce made with Splenda.This is a very tasty and moist cake, a combo cheesecake and yellow cake. I loved it.

I made this cake a few hours before my company arrived and it was a hit. I used  1/2 the amount of ricotta and sugar and dusted the top with cinnamon before baking. A sprinkle of powdered sugar right before I served it gave it just the right amount of sweetness. I cannot wait to try this with lemon extract/zest.

This was fun and we did enjoy the cake; it wasn't as flavorful as I expected, and the texture is a little odd, with the grittiness others describe. I agree that a fruit topping, or maybe the marvelous buttermilk syrup (another all.recipes recipe, we found it on the German pancake recipe) would be good with this. It needs more flavor. I wonder how it would be made with peaches or pineapple like a pineapple-upside-down cake? Or maybe with a chocolate sauce.

Delicious! and easy!  I use only 1/2 cup of sugar in the ricotta mix and also cover with foil half way through baking so the top of the cake doesn't brown too much.

This is a cake my mom always makes and is always a hit. It is so simple and I feel it is perfect as is. The best way to serve is to sprinkle the top of the cake with some cinnamon sugar and then you have an instant hit!

I didn't have a "yellow cake" (I assume that means madeira or butter cake) but I did have a coconut/orange syrup packet cake.   I also used what I had of ricotta (about 3/4 the amount).  It does taste rather eggy - I like that.  My version was just great warm and I will use the syrup from the packet cake to serve over the cake for dessert.  It is the cake version of bread and butter custard.

Made several changes but this was a big hit at my Bible Study class this morning. Necessity is the mother of invention and waste not want not is my motto - needed a dessert for Bible Study class today - only had 1-1/2 cups ricotta but also had 7 oz. cream cheese spread which I mixed together with 4 eggs & flavoring.  Kinda runny but don't worry.  Duncan Hines Lemon Cake mix with 1/3 cup melted butter & 3 eggs.  Kinda thick? forgot the water.  Now combine runny egg & cheese mixture with cake mixture (minus the water lol) pour into greased & floured large bundt pan and bake for 1 hr. - Had some cream cheese frosting left which I put over the top.  RAVE REVIEWS AND NONE LEFTOVER. btw, I do realize this is a completely new recipe but I'll keep it.

Oh my, this is so wonderful. It's light and delicious. I made it in two 8" square pans and only used 1/2 the ricotta mix, as I didn't want it to bake over the tops of the pans. I added 1 tsp almond extract to the cake mix, and and sprinkled some fresh blueberries over the cake mix. Then I combined almond, lemon and vanilla into 1 tsp and added very well drained crushed pineapple to the ricotta mix. I'm sure it would also have been 5 Stars without my changes. Thank you, Sandy!

The ricotta didn't sink, instead it seemed to evaporate? What little was left stayed on top. The cake layer dried out really bad. Thankfully I put chocolate chips in one side and berries in the other, the added flavors kind of salvaged it. Kind of. Wasn't horrible but I wouldn't make it again.

Delicious.  So easy to make. Didn't change a thing.  My husband dies not like ricotta so I didn't tell him it was in there. He just asked.  Why is this so moist and I said cheese.

This was excellent! Even my picky husband, making fun of me for using ricotta( which he hates, and I had bought to make manicotti with, but he quickly vetoed that!)liked this- I used a tres leches mix by Duncan hines and added the sweetened milk topping, that comes with the mix to the cake with holes poked in the top, while still warm. With a sprinkling of nutmeg, this was delicious! Almost like an English "sticky pudding" Will make again and again, with theses changes!

I gave it a 3, but it was better than okay. Not sure I did it right because mine didn't look like the picture. It was hard to determine when it was done.

I made this cake the first time and baked it exactly as directed and it was very dark on top.  The second time I took the suggestion of cooking it at 350 then lowering to 305 and this worked out well and made for a better looking cake.  We italians often add chocolate chips to our ricotta creams in desserts so I added mini chocolate chips to the ricotta both times....delicious!! AND SOO  easy!!

This was good, but I think could be better... I used a bunt pan and inverted after cooking. Also I smooshed some frozen blackberries and put on top of each piece before serving, which was super yummy. Feels like the recipe is missing something, just haven't figured it out yet...

Perfect recipe EXCEPT baking 90 mins would have been ridiculously too long. Thank God I set timer for an hour and checked it then. Toothpick was already clean and probably would have been 10 mins before. I made exactly as written, only used lemon cake mix cause we love lemon. Really really good and I’ve had a lot of ricotta cake in my day.

Yes and I thought it was very good but instead of using a 9 x13 cake pan, I used two large muffin pans with foil  liners. Baked them for 55 minutes, Only used a little more than half of the Ricotta cheese filling. Will use the rest on next batch. I did find the yellow cake in the box to be a little too sweet so I will make my own cake batter next time. As we know that the Ricotta sinks when it bakes but the cake has a chance to cook a while before it does so the cheese ends up in the middle of the muffin. It produced 12 large cupcakes.

Very, very delicious.  I used white vanilla cake mix.  Used less sugar, more vanilla and a splash of lemon juice.  This was superb.  Excellent recipe.  Tastes like something from a gourmet bakery.  Made it for Easter.  My Italian mom loved it.  As did my husband and kids as well.

I follow this recipe exactly and I was somewhat disappointed because I felt it tasted like a box cake mix that have been in the refrigerator and with almost no flavor in the ricotta filling.

This is the best cake recipe ever.  I used a Duncan Hines Yellow Butter Recipe cake mix.  Baked it in a disposable 9 x 13 foil pan just under and hour and a half.  It was delicious.  Everyone loved it.  Easy but delicious.  Note:  The 4 eggs in the recipe are in addition to the eggs that the cake recipe calls for.  Some people online were confused about this part of the recipe.

I made this yesterday for my sister in laws birthday and it was delicious. I made it in a bundt pan like someone else did and followed their adjustments. The only problem I had was part of it didn’t want to come out of the pan. It’s time for a new bundt pan. Mine has been over used and abused. Therefore I did not take a picture of it even though once I put powdered sugar all over it it didn’t look too bad. Will definitely make this many many more times.

I have never written a review, but I just had to for this recipe. Love, love, love it! It's a hit wherever I've taken it-- I'm ALWAYS asked for the recipe-- even from people who warn me that they don't like ricotta cheese before they try it! I call this my "breakfast cake" because of all of the eggs, but I eat it any time of day. My friends who love to work out have asked me for the recipe specifically because of the protein in the eggs. The only thing I do differently is sprinkle the powdered sugar on top while it is fresh out of the oven; it sometimes melts a little bit but becomes crunchy deliciousness later. I have made this cake about 15 times in the past year for family, friends, work, and church, and not once has anyone who tried it not liked it! Thanks so much for this recipe!

I put mine into a bundt pan but only used half of the ricotta filling for the cake (yellow cake recipe from All recipes) as it was too much for my pan.  Made the remaining half into a ricotta cheese cake with a graham crust.  Served both with mango puree (also from All Recipes).  Served warm with a little whipped cream it was very rich and filling.  So yes, this is a denser cake even though I strained  the cheese of excess liquid overnight.  This bundt cake took 1.5 hours to bake through.

So delicious!  A hit after Christmas Day.  I had a yellow cake mix that was 2 Ounces less than the one called for. I'm still not sure how Many eggs to add to the ricotta cheese mixture.  The cake called for three, this  recipe looked like the cheese required 4 more, which seemed too much.  I used 3, think 1 or two would ben sufficient, Also, it said to bake for 1 and  a half hours, my cake was done in 1.  I also added some chocolate chips. But even with these variations, this cake was fabulous!  I will definitely make it again, I will try adding blueberries, raspberries or blackberries.

I used a lemon cake mix and topped it off when chilled, with whipped cream and red raspberries dusted with Splenda. 

I also made an orange cake version and topped with whipped cream and mandarin slices from a can. Delicious.

However, that bottom layer is not getting completely mingled with the cheese portion as it should. It says to spoon it over the cake portion..... and the cheese mixture is much too fluid to "spoon" over it.

an hour and a half was way too long, I checked it at 50 minutes, and then again every 5 minutes. Total cook time was about an hour and 5 minutes. The taste was good, I couldn't wait for it to cool off! Id probably make it again if I had leftover ricotta, don't know if it was good enough to run to the store for ingredients....

This is a hit. 
Make sure you don't get confused about the eggs- the cake mix calls for eggs and the 4 listed in the recipe are for the ricotta filling. 
I didn't have to cook it for the hour and 1/2- it browned quickly , so watch it. I cooked it for 40 min.
Great recipe for company ! Everyone loved it. Make sure you refrigerate it, although it tastes great right after you take out of oven

Well I totally goofed this recipe, I added 1 egg to the ricotta mixture instead of the 4 called for.... It was still super yummy, I will absolutely make it again (with 4 eggs  :-)  ).  I used a French vanilla cake mix and almond extract, cut way back on the sugar in the ricotta, still seems sweet to me, how about others? A bit over sweet to you?   P.S. - how do I store this???

I love this cake - not too sweet and very moist. Just pay attention to the recipe's cooking time. An hour and a half is way too long. I would suggest following the baking instructions on the cake mix package.

Great cake! I sprinkled sliced almonds and fresh blueberries onto the cake mix before adding the ricotta
mixture.
I also added 1 and1/2 tbsp vanilla and 1 teaspoon almond to both mixtures.
I used 1and 1/2 tubs of light ricotta, with 1/2 cup sugar, and 1 egg.
I also sprinkled a generous amount of sliced almonds on top of the ricotta mixture to finish it off.
Delicious and moist. Will definitely make it again.

Omg!!! Loved this cake. Making another one this weekend. Very easy to make.The only change I made was a half tsp. vanilla extract and half tsp. of almond extract.  Otherwise I left the recipe as is.  Can't hardly wait to savor this comfort food again.

Made this for guests last night and it was a huge success. I had concerns because at least one doesn't like cheesecake or ricotta. They all asked me to make it again. I followed the directions, using 3 of the eggs in the cake mix and one mixed into the 2-15 oz containers of ricotta.  I resisted the urge to reduce the sugar and was glad because the sweetness was perfect. I also baked it in an Angel Food cake tube pan and added a cup of fresh blueberries. Didn't need to adjust the baking time or temp. Let it cool in the fridge while I made dinner, sprinkled powdered sugar on top and it was beautiful. The blueberries were scattered throughout, not at the bottom (top once flipped out of pan).

I found the directions difficult to follow. I am happy with how mine came out all in all, but I will still search and try others on this recipe.

I made the recipe as is except I used a lemon cake mix.  In case there is any confusion, I used a total of 7 eggs.  3 in the cake mix and 4 in the ricotta.  I made a simple blueberry sauce to server over it.  The cake is moist and delicious.  Raves from the crowd!

I make a small improvement to this cake too.  I, too, only use half of the ricotta cheese amount but I also make this change.  Ten minutes before the end of the cooking time, I mix 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar with 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and sprinkle this mixture over the top of the unfinished cake.  Then I put the cake back into the oven to finish baking.  This is a nice little addition to a vanilla cake.

I was extremely disappointed after making this cake.  I followed the recipe exactly and used a Betty Crocker yellow cake mix.  Warm out of the oven I thought it was very bland and my husband agreed (and he LOVES yellow cake).  Gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried it the next day, but only marginally better.  Maybe less ricotta and more vanilla might have helped, but next time I'll just stick with plain yellow cake.  Will not be making this again.

A little too bland for me. It was a hit or miss with others.

This is a yummy cake.  I made it twice.  The first time I followed it to a "T".  The second time I also followed the recipe BUT made my own home made ricotta cheese (found on this site).  It was even better the second time.  The home made ricotta is simple to make.  You may want to try it the next time you bake this cake.

i made a berry topping for this.  And used 3 eggs in cake mix and one in ricotta mix.  Think there was typo in amount of eggs to be used as previously suggested by another review.  Wonderful cake on first day. Soggy next day!

Dude, this was crazy tasty. I made it because I found ricotta on a super good deal, but didn't know how I wanted to use it. SO glad I chose this recipe. I made it exactly according to the instructions, except that mine only needed to bake for about an hour. I just kept an eye on it and took it out when it was ready. Also, I dusted some cinnamon sugar on top about halfway through the baking. This was so moist and flavorful, not to mention EASY. Will definitely make again.
