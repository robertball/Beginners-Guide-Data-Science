So far this is the Monte Cristo Sandwich that we like the best.  There are several to choose from this site.  The only thing I did differently was to use a high moisture, fresh mozzerella cheese instead of the shredded. I also cut down a bit on the nutmeg.  Thanks for the post.

This is VERY good - just the right blend of sweet and spicy.  I used smoked deli turkey for the meat, and served it with a dusting of powdered sugar.  Highly recommended - my husband and son loved it!

This was great. It's not quite like Bennigan's but we don't have a bennigans anymore and this'll do. PLUS it's much healthier than bennigans. I did have to change it a tiny bit because of what I had on hand. I used sliced honey turkey breast, provolone cheese, which I think was better than swiss and I used cranberry chutney for dipping. I was very disappointed when I didn't have raspberry preserves but after tasting the cranberry with it, I'll never go back. It complimented the sandwich well. Thanks for the recipe!

These were good, but I was hoping for a recipe similar to the way restaurants make them where they're completely encased in some kind of batter.

All the family agreed this is a good sandwich. I would add more cheese next time.

These sandwiches were very very good. I did make a couple of ingredient substitutions for what I had on hand- used boneless chicken thighs and sliced provolone cheese. Followed the rest of the recipes exactly as written and I will definitely make these again.

According to my husband, who is a very picky eater, this was, "Awesome". Instead of chicken I used turkey and ham. Everything else stayed the same. Was very good. I would make this again.

I am very picky about Monte Cristos and after substituting Swiss for the other cheeses and sprinkling  powdered sugar on the finished sandwich, it was awesome. I dip the bread in the egg mixture, put it on the griddle, then make the sandwich. I dip the other piece of bread and put it on top (dipped side up). Super easy!! Also, I don't use much honey mustard since it overpowers the other flavors.

Really tasty! I made mine with black forest ham, american cheese and shredded mozarella/provolone, and used Dijon mustard because I didnt have honey mustard. I did make one with sourdough, and one with whole wheat bread, and the sourdough is definitely the way to go. It soaks up the egg/milk batter, and yet retains its firmness, for a great tasting sandwich.
This recipe is a keeper!

Some Friends and I made these, and they turned out very tasty. Good for a light meal and full of flavor. Plus the cook time is very fast which is great!

I've had the most FABULOUS Monte Christo sandwiches in restaurants.  These were OK.  I think you really need a deep fryer so you can deep fry these to get the best results.  I used my George Foreman grill with mediocre results.

It's  the day after Thanksgiving had to start getting rid of leftovers . Used ham,  turkey, American cheese and swiss cheese. Dipped it in egg, milk and a little sugar, sprinkled with powdered sugar put a little jam on the side. The best things were used up leftovers, didnt have to leave the house. I appreciate the basis from this recipe.

These were good - used slices of fresh mozzarella instead of the shredded which I would definitely recommend.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great sandwich!  Tasty and easy on the budget for lunch as well.  I dipped the sandwiches lightly in flour before I "egged it".  Very Good!

wonderful recipe! Simple, quick, and loved by the whole family. I served it with a cup of strawberry jam (all I had on hand) and dusted the sandwich with powdered sugar. Delicious!
