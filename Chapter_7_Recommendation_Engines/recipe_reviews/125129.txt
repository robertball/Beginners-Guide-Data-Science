These turned out terrific!  I had originally picked this recipe so I could put the dough in the fridge overnight, but ran out of room.  So what I did was to roll the dough in to 72 little balls, put them on a baking sheet in the freezer and once frozen, put them in a freezer bag.  On the day I needed them, I put three balls of frozen dough in 2 muffin tins about 3 1/2 to 4 hours before baking, covered them to rise and they were perfect!  Stuck them in the oven for about 10 minutes and everyone loved them.  Absolutely will make these again and perhaps just keep the little balls of frozen dough in my freezer for when I need it.

These are so good! I wanted these to be healthier, so I should note that I used all 100% whole wheat flour--no white flour--and they still rose and tasted wonderfully. I will definetley be making these again, and again, and again!

I love these rolls.  Just a hint for mixing any bread dough...combine half the flour and half the water/yeast first until consistant.  Then add more water and more flour a bit at a time until the minimum amount of flour is used up and all the water is gone.  This will prevent having to use all of the flour and will give you lighter rolls or loaves. 

I let the dough rise a long time over an hour *oops*, and I got 36 good size dinner rolls out of the recipe.  They took another 40 minutes to double and filled a large cookie sheet.  Very good!

I lost my "base" recipe for WW rolls, and tried this one! It was great, the only thing I changed was: I dissolved the yeast in 1/4 cup of warm water, and substituted 1 3/4 cups milk (scalded and cooled to temp) to add to the proofed yeast mixture. This made for a much tender roll in the end. 
The 2nd time, I added thyme, basil, caraway seeds and some minced dried onion to the hot milk while it cooled for an "herb-flavored" roll. Very nice!

Twice I followed the recipe as written choosing not to refrigerate the dough.   So easy letting the Kitchen Aid mixer do most of the work.  Delighted with the rolls.  They look and taste so wonderful.  Two of my children are begging for more as I type.  That's a testiment in itself.  In the past 12 years when I have tried a different roll recipe, they just tell me to make my recipe next time.  This will be only the second roll recipe to make it into my personal recipe book.  My family And I appreciate you sharing this recipe Sharon.

These were amazing. I will say they had me a big nervous at first. The yeast proofed beautifully, dough came together perfectly... but after letting them sit in fridge overnight, they showed no signs of rising. So I let it sit in there overnight and all the next day - then I let the dough come to room temp, formed into rolls (some I rolled into balls and popped into buttered muffin tins, others I shaped into sandwich roll shape), let them rise a little, and baked. Perfectly light and great texture. 

I will say that next time I make (soon,I'm sure) I'll likely cut back on the sugar as they were too sweet for my tastes. I might also add some herbs to make them a little more savory. I used butter in place of the oil, and will likely continue to do this. Thanks for the great, easy recipe!

Incredibly light rolls with an amazing amount of flavor. I love how much this recipe yields. Coupled with the fact that the dough keeps for a few days refrigerated, you're set with fresh rolls daily with little effort.

I made these rolls for Thanksgiving and loved how easy they were to prepare! All I had to do was mix up the dough and put it in the fridge. It rose beautifully overnight, and was easy to form into rolls. They rose quickly before baking, and baked up a beautiful golden brown. I brushed the tops of the hot rolls with melted butter, which gave them a nice flavor. I received lots of compliments on these rolls, and they dissapeared quickly! Thanks for a great and easy recipe; I will make them again!

The absolute best rolls ever!  So light and fluffy.  They stay moist and soft for days stored in a ziploc bag.  Note:  I used less all purpose flour than was called for.  I just knead it right in the mixing bowl, which may cause the reduction in the amount of flour.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

These were really good, not heavy on the wheat flavor.  Felt it could've used a little more salt though.

Oh YUM! I cut this recipe in half to get 12 rolls. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast (two "envelopes", only because I've always had issues getting whole wheat flour to rise so I just threw them both in) with warm buttermilk (instead of water) and sugar for ten minutes, then I added one whole egg, melted butter (I'm low on vegetable oil right now) and all the dry ingredients. I did flip-flop the white flour and the whole wheat flour. I used 2 1/4 cups whole wheat white flour and 1 cup organic AP flour. I did need just a touch more flour than the recipe stated to get it to form into a ball and jump on the bread hook, just under a quarter cup. I kneaded it in the Kitchen Aid with the dough hook for about five minutes. I set it to rise in a greased bowl on my heating pad for an hour, then formed them into rolls and plopped them into greased muffin tins (1/4 cup for each roll), covered them and set them to rise on my heating pad until they doubled. Right before baking, I lightly brushed them with a little melted butter. 400* for about 10 minutes was absolutely perfect. These baked really fast for me. I was thinking fourteen but they smelled done right at ten minutes. Absolutely GREAT whole wheat roll recipe and really can make it all in one day, if you so choose. I'm quite happy with this recipe.

These were awesome! Very easy to make and a great base for making different varieties. I made mine with 100% white whole wheat flour with some added vital wheat gluten to help with the rise and they came out wonderful Delicious!

I used all Whole wheat flour.  I baked half the dough and froze the rest for another day.  Great rolls, thanks.

I just tried this recipe and they were great!  This is even my very first time ever making rolls, as my mother passed away a few months back and I was determined to make homemade rolls for Thanksgiving!  Now I know I can!  I didn't refrigerate them, however, but probably will the next time I make them!  Thanks for a great recipe!

A very average roll if made by this recipe.  Using lard instead of oil helped these rolls tremendously.  I also added two tablespoons of honey to this recipe.  Using sea salt instead of just any salt also gave them a much better flavor.  With all these changes it’s basically a new recipe.

These were beyond a five start rating.  Easy to make, really light and tasty, will definitely make again.  The combo of flour that I used was 3 whole wheat to 3.5 white.  Just perfect.

I really enjoyed these rolls. I let the dough rise for about 45 minutes and then placed them in muffin tins (I rolled three separate balls and placed them in one muffin hole to look like the picture). I let them rise for about an hour before I baked them. I made similar white rolls, but the whole wheat rolls are a lot better.

Really yummy roll! Though my husband prefers white dinner rolls best, I made these and he really liked them.  I think this will be my #2 recipe when I want to get more fiber/whole grains into my family's diet:) 
I didn't refrigerate them but just let them rise and they turned out beautiful! Very impressed.  I did some tweaking of my own with these.  I added about 1/2 cup of non-fat powdered milk when I was adding the sugar.  I let the yeast activate in the hot water along with a TBSP of sugar, then added it to my Bosch.  I followed up by adding the sugar, egg, vegetable oil, salt and let that mix.  Then I added the 2 flours until it was the right stickiness and let it knead for about 5 min since the Bosch does all the work!  I think the powdered milk or you could use milk in substitute for some of the milk makes it more tender.

This was my first attempt at making rolls in my entire 28 years on earth.  I followed the directions to a T and my rolls came out yummy.  I did a test batch before the real show on Thanksgiving and I know my family is going to love these rolls over the Rhodes frozen ones I normally use.  I can't wait to show off my baking skills!!  Next time I might use more whole wheat flour or 100% whole wheat flour. Also, my mom (one of my taste testers) said she couldn't taste any butter, even though I brushed melted better over the top of my rolls. I'm going to use butter instead of oil next time.

I have made these several times since last Thanksgiving and  now make the following changes: Halve the sugar to lessen the sweetness Use only Whole Wheat flour to reduce starch Use honey butter when serving - whip two sticks unsalted butter with four tablespoons of dark honey.  Fantastic!

Delicious and so handy. My husband and I struggle to eat a whole batch of rolls all at once. Since I can make these a little at a time over a couple of days it works perfectly for us.

These are so great! I followed another reviewer's suggestion to use 1 3/4 cups scalded milk with 1/4 cup warm water to dissolve the yeast. I have made these twice now and I will not be buying rolls from the store again. These are so easy, wholesome and tasty!

These rolls were great! This coming from a first time bread maker. They were easy and turned out perfect.  I did modify the recipe slighty just by halving the sugar and substituting all wheat flour (turned out I only needed 5 cups total to get the right consistancy).  I will absolutely use this recipe for many years to come, myself, my husband and kids loved it. Thank you Sharon for the great recipe!

These turned out great! I made a half batch and used 1/4 cup flax meal and mostly wheat flour. On a whim decided to have some for supper that day, did a first rise of about 2 hours and then the second rise and popped some into the oven. Will definately make again! And next time I'll make a whole batch, this is the Thanksgiving roll good enough to serve to guests that I've been looking for. Thanks!

My family really liked these with Easter dinner.  I added 1/4 cip each of sunflower kernels and oats to add a little more texture.  Very easy to make, very good flavor.

These were fairly easy to make, especially since I used my Kitchenaid mixer to do most of the work.  The only flaw is that these rolls are somewhat on the dry side.  The great thing is that you can make the dough the night before, and all you have to do is bake the next day.  Overall, these worked great and went over well with our soup dinner.

Delicious!  I used olive oil for the vegetable oil and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  My only complaints were that these were a bit sweet (will try less sugar next time) and seemed more like white rolls (will do half ww flour and half white flour next time).

I'm new to bread/dinner rolls. This was very easy. I used King Arthur's white whole wheat flour for everything. Our whole family, who aren't fans of whole wheat, LOVED them. I used my mixer with dough hooks and wasn't sure how long to "kneed it." They turned out great.

I ended up only using 4 cups total of all-purpose flour.  The dough rose beautifully in the fridge overnight, and I shaped them into rolls and put them back into the fridge until an hour before baking.  Shortened the 2nd rise to 45 min with a pan of water and a warm oven, and then baked 12 minutes.  Golden and yummy!

These have become a staple in my house. I use more whole wheat flour and less all-purpose. The family loves them.

These were quite good, but I think they need a bit more salt. They were very, very yeasty, too, which is not necessarily a bad thing, just distinctive. Definitely the best homemade bread I've ever made - I usually find that it tastes flat - and I like that they were whole-wheat, but I think I'm still looking for the totally amazingly perfect dinner roll. Thanks!

These did not rise for me, unfortunately.  I used wheat flour for the entire recipe, and as I read in another review, I probably should have doubled the of yeast.  I think I'll give it another try.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very nice rolls and they did rise very high.  I halved the recipe and put in bread machine on dough cycle. I made them into clover rolls in a cupcake pan.  I think, I could have made about 18 rolls instead of the 12 that I made.  Good flavor and easy to work with. Used half white wheat and half AP flour.

Well, 1st time I followed recipe, it didn't work out putting in frige. It rose nicely the 1st time but failed to rise again. My 2nd attempt I replaced 1/2C WW flour w/quick oats. I used brn sugar & bread flour vs A/P flour. Olive oil vs vegetable. Proofed yeast in 1/2C warm water with 1 tblsp of honey for 10 minutes. I chose to use milk (scalded) vs remaining water. I thought the milk cooled enough and added 1 tblsp vinegar to make more of a buttermilk...eeeee gads, a clump of cheese formed, LOL. I removed that and ended up with whey. So, I added in enough milk to get 1-1/2 C. Oh, I did use a K/A stand mixer but didn't let it do the kneading. I pulled it out while fairly sticky & kneaded in about 1/4C AP flour until I could form into ball for 1st rise. Got sidetracked & dough rose for 2 hours - holy moly, it got huge! After deflated, I cut chunks off, rolled into balls, placed on large baking sheet & covered with plastic wrap & froze. I ended up with 37 dough balls. Upon using, I decided to stick 2 together (flat sides) and placed in reg size muffin cups - let thaw & rise (took about 3 hours). Even with my blunders...they turned out perfect! I wrote review so I will remember what I did as I will be making again! These were the BEST rolls EVER & will duplicate in same fashion.

I cut the batch in half and make 1/2 now & raise the other 1/2 in the fridge for fresh rolls later.  That way I can have fresh several days from the same batch.  Love it!

These rolls were really fast, and easy...it tastes much better to substitute half of the flour with whole wheat, as suggested by earlier reviews--I've tried both ways, and regular flour is a bit bland--but still a FAST, DELICIOUS recipe for a mother in a hurry!

These were really delicious! I halved the recipe but otherwise used the ingredients as listed. Only catch is I wanted to use my Kitchenaid stand mixer instead of hand kneading. I started with the whisk attachment to mix the first ingredients and then switched to the dough hook. After dough pulled away from the sides, I continued to mix on Level 2 for about 2 minutes (in place of the kneading). It seemed to work well! Also, I was anxious to get the rolls in the oven for dinner, so I'm not sure I let the dough fully rise each time, but again it all turned out great. I don't think you can go wrong with this one!

My daughter made these rolls by herself one day... They turned out amazing!  She put more whole wheat flour in than it calls for (I don't know the amount) and lessened the sugar.  These are keepers!

These turned out really well. The only changes I made was using half whole wheat and half white flour and brushing the tops with maple syrup (I love doing that to rolls and biscuits, it adds a really nice touch of sweetness). These will be my go-to rolls from now on.

Very yummy rolls but the recipe calls for to much all-purpose flour.  That's the only reason why I rated it a four.  I only used 3 1/2 cups and that was plenty!  I also put a little cheddar cheese on top of them before I baked them and it was a wonderful addition! This is now one of my staple recipes.

These were SO good.  I made them for Thanksgiving today, and was worried that my husband wouldn't approve because of the whole wheat flour.  He loved them though.  I think he ate three (in addition to all of the other Thanksgiving food).  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I am definitely a novice baker but had no problem following the recipe. My critic is my wife and she really liked these rolls. They came out of the oven soft and chewy with a mild sweet flavor tasting very good.

Super easy and great tasting recipe!  I've made it three times and use 3 cups whole wheat flour and 3 1/2 all-purpose flour.  I also don't refrigerate overnight to rise, I just make it the same day. Delicious.

We like rolls at our house and having dough in the fridge is very convenient!  I doubled the recipe so it will last more than 2 meals.  Yesterday, before the second rise, I added garlic powder, extra salt, fresh ground pepper and the last chunk of sharp cheddar lurking in the fridge (grated).  They got rave reviews from the family.

This is a good roll recipe- and convenient to have it rise overnight in the fridge.  I do prefer recipes made with butter, though, because I think they are a little more tender.  But there were still really good.  I let them rise about 1.5 hours the day after before baking.  Perfect.  I made mostly cresents, and a dozen round rolls in a cake pan.  I got 4 dozen, but they were all different sizes.

Used 100% white whole wheat flour (no all-purpose flour).  These were EXCELLENT.  Absolutely wonderful texture.  Whole family loved them.  As written, these are pretty sweet.  If I was going for savory, I'd cut out most of the sugar.

The dough came together so easily, and the texture was very nice, even for someone like me who usually ends up making rolls like hockey pucks.  The flavor was good as is, but I can see where a touch of honey would make these even better.  The dough produces a very light wheat roll that even my whole wheat-hatin' husband enjoyed!  Will be a regular in my house for sure, and I'd like to try some of the other suggestions - using milk for some of the water, brushing with melted butter and definitely using honey for some of the sugar. Very nice recipe - Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe for the working bunch! It allows you to premake it when you have time and still be able to have fresh bread on a day you work. The flavor was delish, definitely a keeper in my recipe box! Thanks!

Absolutely amazing. They are very sweet! May reduce the sugar next time and add a little honey. This will be a new staple!

This is the best whole wheat bread recipe that I have ever made.Just a few ingredients and easy to put together. I made a loaf of bread out of what I had left in the fridge and it stayed soft and tasty and did not get hard and crumbly like most bread does. I made mine with olive oil because that is all I use and it worked fine.

I'm not sure why this recipe hasn't been tried by more people - this bread came out awesome and I didn't have to change a thing in the recipe. These are definitely worth the time and are a great healthy change from what you buy at the grocery store.

This is probably the best bread recipe I've made!!  It's so soft when kneeding it!  It rises so well and quick really.
I made the clover rolls the 1st time and my family just LOVED them.  We had tuna sammys with them the next day!  I made a pan of clover rolls and two large pans of mini rolls with this recipe.  The mini rolls were good but because they were so small I couldn't really make sandwiches for the next day or anything really with it.  So I'm going to buy another muffin pan for this purpose.  
I used the same recipe today and made 2 loafs of bread.  It worked out PERFECT!!  I totally recommend trying this bread!!

I tripled this recipe and made them for a Golden Age party at church and received many compliments on them along with a white dinner roll that I also got from allrecipes.

These were great.  I made (to keep everyone happy) knots, regular rolls, and cloverleaf shapes and they were enjoyed by all.  I've got half a batch in the freezer, and they seem to be reheating well.  A home-made honey butter was marvelous on these rolls.  Plus, the whole wheat flavor wasn't extremely strong, so they didn't know it was healthy.

They looked better than they tasted.  Very doughy tasting.  I followed recipe exactly and made the same day without refrigerating the dough.

These rolls were great!  I made some white rolls at the same time that did not rise in the refrigerator.  These wheat rolls actually rose better than the white ones!

I took a suggestion from another reviewer and shaped the dough into balls and put in my freezer. When I was ready for the rolls, I let them rise for about 5 hours. Next time, I will let them rise a little longer because they weren't very fluffy. However they still tasted great!

Rather bland. Had lots left over. My family likes rolls that are tender, a little sweet, and can eat without butter.  Tastes like store-bought wonder bread out of the bag.

Very good.....so easy! My kids didn't like them because they have a strong yeast flavor. I am not sure if this is because of the overnight refrigeration or just the yeast I used, but I loved them!

I'm SUCH a novice baker and these turned out great. And they are better for you. I used more wheat flour than white. I will definitely make these again!!

I tried 1/2 recipe with no other adjustments.  It made 16 nice size rolls.  They were GREAT!  I even froze some and stored some to use within 2 days.  The results were just as expected.  I will definately use this one again.  Thank you!!

Perfect amount of sweetness and whole wheat taste. I left the dough out on the counter till it doubled, rolled balls (1.5" diameter)into muffin tins and was able to get 21 buns (I made the recipe for 12). My 4 year old, 2 year old, husband and I thoroughly enjoyed them this evening. Thank you.

Not bad. I added flax and wheat bran for a little extra fiber, and cinnamon and raisins to make them more of a breakfast roll.

Wonderful recipe!  Thank you for sharing it.  These rolls are hearty, delicious, and excellent with a stew or chowder.  I served it with my chicken corn chowder and it was a huge hit.
