I loved this recipe with a few time saving modifications. I used Bisquick instead of flour & baking powder. I also used about twice as much cinnamon as it called for because we really like it and left out the ginger because I didn't have any. I also skipped the the syrup because I forgot to buy apple cider. They were delicious with regular syrup. Next time I'll probably add more brown sugar because not quite sweet enough for me. Otherwise a great recipe! I'll probably make on Thanksgiving morning.

Love the syrup! But I felt the waffles were pretty dense. I have a belgin waffle maker and they took a bit longer to cook vs. regular waffles...so don't take them out until the top is getting browned and crip. I followed the recipe to the T and they were pretty good...I might add more sugar if I plan on having the waffles without the cider syrup, but together they are WONDERFUL!

This was awesome.  I couldn't make them fast enough to keep my kids happy.  My 5 year old said they were the best food he's ever had.

The syrup is very powerful so you only have to use a little bit which helps cut out a lot of sugar we normally have on waffle mornings.  

The kids asked if we could have this every morning.

I made a few changes this time from the 1st couple of times I've made them. I used 1 tsp of nutmeg and 1 tsp of clove in place of only 1tsp of allspice and a hair more pumpkin. It's really important that you whip your egg whites long enough so they do have peaks and fold in gently so the batter will start to get light and fluffy/airy feeling you'll see it start to change, othewise they are too dense and will sit in your stomach like a rock. I found too they do need to cook longer than regular waffles, but also try a little higher heat setting if yours adjusts like mine, normally set at a 3.5, put up to a solid 4 and worked much better.   For the apple cider syrup I use water and fresh cut up apples instead, less white sugar, add brown sugar and nutmeg. Delish! Have also made apples w/ less sugar and then just drizzled real maple syrup over waffles and apples before serving. That also got rave reviews.

I just made the syrup- I'm sure the waffles are amazing, but I made pumpkin pancakes and heard of apple cider syrup so I wanted to give it a go.  I forgot to add the butter at the end, but didn't miss it!  Amazing, easy, for the people that didn't make the syrup- just try it.  Its worth it!

Even my vegetable hating son loves these waffles! I agree with the previous reviewer that they should be cooked just a little longer than regular waffles. They also freeze really well.

Original review- October 2011: Thank you Jeanette for an incredibly delicious waffle recipe.  We altered the recipe to suit our toddlers' taste:  instead of whole milk we substituted 
2 cups of whole milk and 2 T of white vinegar (allow to sit for 10 minutes, it's a buttermilk alternative).  We used 1 T cinnamon and 1 T pumpkin spice for the spices.  Instead of 2 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, we used 1 C whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups all-purpose.  The next time we make these, we'll substitute white whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour.  These came out fluffy, moist and slightly sweet.  These made 10 Belgium waffles, we froze the left-overs and will have a quick treat another day.  Thank you again Jeanette.
Update- March 2013:  We are still making these, in fact they are our go to Belgium waffle batter.  We sometimes use pureed roasted sweet potato (and if the puree is a little less than 1 cup, we add a mashed banana to make up the difference).  Today our big change was using sweetened vanilla almond milk instead of regular milk- it made it a little more moist, but delicious!  Thank you again Jeanette.

I just made the Apple Cider Syrup and it was AMAZING!  A perfect compliment to the pumpkin.  My husband LOVED it, and wanted me to make an entire jug of the syrup so he can have it on a daily basis on his morning waffles.  Just make sure you boil it long enough in order to thicken it up.

This recipe made nine 6" Belgian waffles.  I liked the waffles and I liked the syrup, but I'm not sure I'd serve both of them together again.  If you're planning to serve all of the waffles, you will not have enough syrup.  This apple cider syrup is seriously good, but by the time that it cooks down to a serving consistency, it has reduced quite a bit in volume.  Do yourself a favor and double the syrup recipe because it's worth the effort, just delicious.  The waffles have a nice blend of spices with a subtle hint of pumpkin, but when served with the apple cider syrup, it just overwhelms the pumpkin flavor.  In the future, I will serve the pumpkin waffles with maple syrup and serve the apple cider syrup with "regular" pancakes, waffles, or french toast.  One additional comment.  This is a fairly time-consuming recipe, so get prepared and start with a clean kitchen. Trust me, you'll have a kitchen full of dirty dishes once you've made this.  Start the syrup first because it takes some time to cook down.  Then just keep it warm until your waffles are ready to go on the table.  None of these comments are meant to be negative because IMO, this is a very special meal, but it's also a lot of work.  Most likely for me, it's one that will be served mostly for special occasions.  Thanks Jeanette for developing this outstanding recipe.

Yikes. I do not get what all the fuss is about. I followed the recipe exactly. It was not flavorful. I would say in fact that it was bland. The waffles were dense even though I definitely added the egg whites correctly-- I can only imagine what they would have been like otherwise! Also, there are so many dried spices added that the flavor is almost chalky. I need to stop writing this review before I change it to a 1. Thinking about the texture is really bothering me!

All four of my kids LOVED these! I did add more brown sugar than called for (about 1/2 c + 2 TBSP) and we used regular pancake syrup. YUMM!

Very tasty!  Due to the thickness of the batter I had to leave them in the waffle maker slightly longer than usual, but they turned out great.  The syrup tastes just like the syrupy juice from an apple pie.  A great Halloween breakfast!

This review is only for the waffles, as i didn't attempt the cider syrup.  I really enjoyed these waffles.  I adjusted the spices to our tastes (mild) so i just used a dash of allspice and no ginger.  I also added a T or 2 of extra sugar.  Others had said theirs turned out mushy, but i cooked mine till they were extra crisp and i didn't have a problem with the texture being soggy.  My toddler gobbled them up.  I served with homemade vanilla syrup and chopped walnuts.  Will keep on hand for the fall!

These were wonderful! I doubled the brown sugar and used 2 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. Next time I will try 3 tsp. The syrup was wonderful too. Next time I'll also add chopped pecans. YUM!

Good, but need more flavor.  Make sure to cook long enough because they are quite dense.

Spiced perfectly and the texture of the waffles were fluffy and light with a light crunch on the outside. The syrup is delicious.  I had fresh pressed cider (pressed 1 day before making these) and the flavor was incredible. Slightly tangy, sweet and the right consistancy. Thanks for sharing!

REVIEW ON APPLE CIDER SYRUP ONLY: I have no clue where I put my waffle maker so decided to just make the syrup with the 'Pumpkin Pancakes' recipe here on allrecipes. (also a great recipe) and it was GREAT. At first I thought the Apple Cider overpowered the sugar and it was too tart but after I added the butter it's just perfect! Only change I made was added a PINCH of nutmeg although I'm sure that made little difference. DO NOT leave this stuff on the stove to boil unattended because mine was thick enough for use almost immediately after it started to boil (Maybe 1 minute TOPS of boiling) and make sure to follow instructions and add the cornstarch in with the other dry ingredients, otherwise you will probably have clumps of cornstarch in your finished product and it probably wont thicken as well. Next time I will probably try adding thin chunks of fresh apple. GREAT SYRUP RECIPE. TRY IT!

I gave this two star because the description for one star was "could not eat it". We can eat it, but it's not anything I would really want to waste my calories on. I made as instructed, I did add 3 teaspoons of cinnamon per a previous review to increase flavor with spice and not sugar. Dense as can be! almost like a banana bread that is dry, it has a bitter after taste (could be the cinnamon), each waffle (mine are Belgian style) weighs about half a pound and does make 6. This has the flavor of a "health food". I did not make the syrup. I feel this require a lot of energy for something "blah".

So delicious!  I had to make substitutions because of missing ingredients. I used 2 ts of pumpkin pie spice instead of allspice half n half instead of milk and white sugar. And I only had apple juice but I can't wait to try apple cider in it. The waffles were good but as a pair this was so yummy!

I made this recipe this morning for a special fall breakfast despite the Indian summer we've been having. I used whole wheat flour instead of white. I didn't have allspice so I substituted 1/2 t. cinnamon, 1/4 t. clove, 1/4 t. nutmeg. Make sure to melt the butter in a separate bowl. I tried to skip dirtying another bowl & melted the butter in the large bowl then added the pumpkin, egg yolks & milk but the butter hardened up from the cold milk. I recommend using an electric hand mixer for the egg whites, a lot easier than using a whisk. This was really, really good but a lot of work & a lot of cleanup.

These were good but not the best.  My 3 year old loved the waffles, she ate at least 2 whole ones.  Husband thought the syrup was note worthy.

Very tasty. I think next time I will add real apples in the syrup.

I love this recipe!  I only made the syrup because it sounded like an awesome pair with my Trader Joe's pumpkin pancakes and waffle mix.  This is the perfect breakfast for the fall!

These were fairly good. They are dense, but do have a good flavor and a great way to celebrate the Fall season.  For me, though, this was a lot of work just for a waffle.  I don't think I'd make them very often and if I do make them again, I will make a huge batch so I can freeze some for later.  My baking powder had expired so the only change I made was I used Bisquick for the flour and baking powder.  The syrup was good also, but for me personally the cinammon was very strong.  In my book, a little cinammon goes a long way so next time I'll try reducing the cinammon down to 1/2 tsp.  Even if I don't make the waffles again, would definitely make the syrup again for everyday pancakes and waffles.

These are amazing! The apple cider syrup is what makes it for me. I love to make extra for regular pancakes later on. I have made this recipe for a long time, but was looking for a recipe that didn't require egg white beating, to save time. Couldn't find a better recipe, and today it occurred to me why. Adding pumpkin makes for a dense waffle, so you need to add the whipped egg whites to counteract that. That's what makes this recipe perfect. Also, if you want this waffle to taste more like pumpkin pie on its own, just add more sugar. The purpose of making them like this is that you are planning on pouring syrup all over them, so you don't want them to be overly-sweet to begin with. Love these, crave these!

Tasty and unique! The apple cider syrup was amazing, although I might cut the sugar next time as it was too sweet for my taste. And it thickened so quickly! I was less impressed by the waffles; the pumpkin flavor didn't really come through.  Mine were a little dense (probably I didn't whip the egg whites enough) and didn't crisp up even though I left them in longer than normal.

I used half whole wheat flour and added a little flax.  The waffles had a good texture but they were pretty bland.  I didn't make the cider syrup so maybe that was where all of the flavor was supposed to be.

I thought this was a great recipe.  My only recommendation is to decrease the amount of apple cider.  It overpowered the entire meal!  Next time I make this I will try only half of the apple cider.

I disagree that these were dense.  If you beat the egg whites into soft peaks and fold in correctly, they turn out fluffy and moist!  I wasn't planning on making the syrup but found out we didn't have any so I substituted the apple cider with orange juice and made it anyway.  Delicious!!!

Great waffles, not too dense... just right!
Syrup is excellent, but you need to at least double the syrup recipe.  Some in family thought that the syrup could use less sugar, as it is very sweet

Delicious recipe. The waffles were a little too cakey for me even still, it was still plenty goo to satisfy my pumpkin craving. I didn't like having to use so many different bowls to make these waffles. LOTS of dishes for first thing in the morning. The syrup is AMAZING! I'll make it again to go with my regular waffles.

I was looking for a pumpkin waffle recipe and chose this one because it used so many eggs.  I used freshly ground flour and only 2 T rapadura instead of the brown sugar.  I do wish they had more pumpkin - I will probably try to add more next time - but they did turn out nice and light and the spices were good but not overwhelming.  I did not make the syrup.

I did not make the syrup just the waffles but they were delicious.  I used cinnamon and nutmeg for the spices because I didn't have ginger or allspice.  The waffles were so good that my boys were eating them faster than I could cook them.  I put some chopped apples, cinnamon, little bit of maple syrup, and spoonful of pumpkin in a saucepan and cooked it up as a topping.  This combination (the topping and these waffles) actually tasted really good cold as leftovers too :)

Yummy!  I didn't use quite 1 cup of pumpkin and I subbed canola oil for butter.  Otherwise followed the directions and these were delish!  It was a little time consuming to whip up the egg whites, but I think in the end it was worth it.

These had a good flavor, but I didn't think they were extraordinary. Even though the outside was all cooked, the inside was still a little runny. Could have been my waffle maker though. The syrup was delicious!! I would make that again and pour it over regular pancakes or waffles.

One word...Yummy!!! I followed the recipe by the book, except for one thing...I accidentally added the entire can of pumpkin (about 2 cups) - they still turned out awesome and the pumpkin wasn't overpowering at all.

The syrup is incredible!   5 stars.  The waffles were very, very good! 4 stars.   Add a bit of ground nuts to make them a 5!   Make sure to "thin" the batter out a bit, it is too thick!

Made this for breakfast - the waffles were yummy but the Apple Cider Syrup was phenomenal! I had some Spiced Apple Cider from Trader Joes in the fridge which already had cinnamon and lemon juice in it, so I omitted those.  You don't get a ton of syrup and at first I thought there was no way that amount of syrup would serve all of us - but a little goes a long way and it definitely did.  My kids devoured it as did my hubby and I.  Thanks!

These had excellent flavor but the batter was more like dough (very thick) and they were a bit dry.  Next time I'll add a cup or so of applesauce to the batter.

Just made these this a.m.  To be honest I was afraid they would not be good. Wow was I wrong! These are very tasty! My husband said they taste like fall. I followed the recipe to a T and it was great. I put my wafflemaker on a higher setting because the first one was kinda soggy but after turning it up hey were perfect!!! This is a must try!!

So yummy! The syrup is a bit too sweet. I have made these a few times and cut back on the sugar a bit each time. These waffles cook up perfectly and are so yummy! I don't find them too time consuming but they do dirty a lot of dishes.

These were great!  I think that the syrup is the real winner.   I substituted one cup of the flour with whole wheat flour,  but other than that followed the recipe as written.   My husband,  who doesn't really like pumpkin,  ate four waffles in one sitting.   We froze the leftovers and had them for breakfast the rest of the week.   We doubled the syrup recipe and my husband plans to use it on his toast for breakfast when we run out of waffles.

I liked them a lot, super easy to put together.  I did however cut down on the cinnamon, because there was quite a bit of it in the Syrup. I felt it would take away from the pumpkin flavor.

The texture of these waffles were mushy.The batter stuck to the waffle iron on the outside and the inside was still almost raw.  I tried the batter on the griddle for pancakes without much success.  The inside of the waffle had the consistency of pumpkin pie filling.  The taste was good, and instead of mixing the spices, I used 4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice.  The Apple Cider Syrup is fantastic and a keeper!

Loved these waffles! My kids said they were the best they have ever had...and my kids are very picky! The only drawback was the cooking space needed due to needing three separate bowls plus the the waffle iron. Other than that, I couldn't have been happier with the results. (I used whipped cream as an additional topping! So yummy!)

I really liked this recipe, and my husband and his friend really enjoyed it too. It really was delicious, followed the recipe exactly. I think my only flaw I found was that I used fresh pureed pumpkin, which is a lot more "liquidy" than regular canned pumpkin. Although the consistency was right, I found that the waffles were kind of flat (didn't puff up quite like waffles should!). Anyway, they're still amazing and I'll make them again, but just those using fresh pumpkin take head on how it turns out, that's all. :) Enjoy!

These were delicious.  I made belgium waffles, and they turned out great.  (I used half white whole wheat flour.) The syrup was a huge hit - makes the waffles even better.  I had some fresh cranberries, so I added them in with the apple juice, and left out the lemon juice. (I also reduced the butter)  Yummy!!!  I made a double batch of waffles, and needed a triple batch of syrup.

Just had these for breakfast today and DH "loved" them! As another reviewer suggested, I doubled the cinnamon in the waffles to 4 tsp. and because I did not have any allspice, I used ground cloves. DH is diabetic so I used Ideal brand sweetener instead of sugar, brown in the waffles and white in the syrup. Because this sweetener is formulated for baking, it tastes much better than other sweeteners in recipes like this one. We like these so well the recipe is being added to our weekend recipe rotation, although next time I will use half whole wheat flour and half unbleached flour to increase the fiber content.

LOVED THESE!  I actually made the first batch gluten free using an all purpose mix recipe in place of the AP flour, but I'm dying to try it "regular" for myself since the GF version was even good!  The Apple Cider Syrup was to die for! Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't make the syrup - disclaimer! The waffles were great. Did all the stuff that waffles are supposed to do, crispy outside, fluffy inside, light pumpkin flavor. My substitutions: I used pumpkin spice flavoring, 3-4 tsp, in lieu of all the rest of the dry seasonings except salt. Easy peasy. The pumpkin batter isn't too sweet, which makes the waffle a great vehicle for syrup, whip cream and caramel sauce, which is how we ate it. Yums.

The syrup really makes these amazing.  I just wish there weren't so much butter and sugar involved  - I always put less than called for and usually no butter in the batter and it's great.

Awesome waffles that whole family loved! I added 1/2 cup of extra milk- the batter was just too thick. It worked out great.  I did use self- rising flour and no baking powder, which always works for pancakes and waffles. LOVED the syrup!!!

Love these waffles. Light and fluffy. I like to add a 1/2 tsp more of the cinnamon, allspice and ginger just to give more flavor. The syrup is really good on plain waffles too.

Followed the recipe exactly except I added slices of apples I needed to use up and they were sooooo tasty. What I was most surprised about was that it actually made 6 servings like it says it does.

Great recipe!  I opted not to make the syrup because I love the flavors of pumpkin and maple together.  I did, however, sautee some apples in cinnamon to put on top.    This made a LOT of waffles.  Our waffle iron makes big waffles (we can only eat one each), and we got 6 large waffles from it.  We're going to freeze the leftovers.

Delicious!! I made mine with whole wheat flour, we don't use white flour in our house.  They turned out fantastic.  I tried some of the waffles with regular syrup, and some with the apple cider syrup. The apple cider syrup makes all the difference! It's the best!! Great recipe!!

Love these. So yummy. I have made them by the book and made them with extra brown sugar and do like more sugar. I have also forgotten to separate my eggs and beat the whites and just dropped them in whole once, they still turned out great. The syrup was such a huge hit too that my boys want it all the time.

Syrup is awesome!! I was hoping for a stronger pumpkin taste in the waffles, but they were still good. My 5-year-old, who is super picky, loved the waffles!!

First of all, your house smells wonderful while you are fixing these!  My batter was too thin so I had to add some flour and my syrup was to thick so I had to add more cider.  The syrup was a little stringy so I may have cooked to long.  The waffles were very cake like, not like a usually waffle, but they were very tasty.  I will make again and possibly will give it 5 stars next time.

Rating the Apple Cider Syrup only:  I made the syrup to go with pumpkin pancakes and it was excellent!  A nice change from maple syrup.  It looked good and thick even before I added the butter - I might even try leaving out the butter next time.

I am rating only the Apple Cider Syrup! So good and so simple to make. I made Pumpkin Pancakes from this site as I wanted pancakes instead of waffles. Will definitely be making this again!!

MY STARS!  I love, love love these waffles.  I make them with fresh milled Spelt instead of AP Flour.  I serve them with Nutmeg Whipped Cream.  A definite special morning treat :)

This is the second time I've made pumpkin waffles. This recipe is much better than the first recipe I tried. I used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour. I added another 1/2 cup pumpkin and reduced the milk by 1/2 cup to compensate for the added moisture. I also left out the ginger just because I didn't have any. I also added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and an extra 1/2 teaspoon of allspice. These were amazing! The recipe for the syrup made just the right amount for the waffles. I will definitely be making these often!

This was pretty good. it could have used more pumpkin and I don't even like pumpkin that much. I used a cinnamon syrup instead. it wasn't crispy but it was soft and i liked the consistency. I might try to make again and add more pumpkin.

These waffles had an ok taste but were not a good texture.  I like my waffles crispy and light and these were heavy and floppy.  I cooked for as long as possibly without burning but could not get them to crisp.  Did not get a chance to make the syrup.

I too have a Belgian waffle iron & they took longer.  I couldn't really taste pumpkin & found them a little dense in my stomach. Won't make this recipe again but I will add that they cooked up beautifully.

We had friends over for breakfast and made these pumpkin waffles with buttermilk syrup.  Everyone really enjoyed them.  They were surprisingly light for having pumpkins in them.

I didn't get to try the apple cider syrup (no apples or cider...), but the pumpkin waffles were sooooo good! Very delicious! It makes a lot though. My little heart waffle maker only holds 1/3 cup of batter, so we froze some and will have them tomorrow too!

The pumpkin waffles were good.  I prefer heavy dense waffles with whole grains, so that will be my change for next time.  The apple cider syrup was very tasty!

The waffles were delicious but the syrup was out of this world! I didn't have allspice so I increased the cinnamon by 1/2 teaspoon and added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg to the batter. Also, I didn't have apple cider so I used apple juice in the syrup. I don't know that the change in spices in the batter made much of a difference. Using cider as called for would probably give the syrup a little extra zing. As I made them, though, they were sooooo yummy. My whole family ate them up and licked the plate! This one's a keeper.

Great recipe, although a bit time consuming with the eggs and all.  The syrup is very good but also very strong, so it overpowered the waffles a bit.  I'd still recommend making it though!  My son loved these and had 4 of them, which is a lot for a 5 year old!

I used a waffle mix instead of flour and baking powder. I also sprinkled sprouted pumpkin seeds onto the batter once on the waffle iron. This made toasted pumpkin seed in the waffles which I though was delicious!

These are delicious! However, I read the instructions and said out loud, “Yeah, that’s not happening.” I beat the egg whites a bit with a whisk but not til they had soft peaks. I also didn’t bother mixing everything so carefully (1/3 of  this and 1/4 of that) just mixed wet and dry ingredients separately. They turned out great and were the perfect consistency. I was carefully not to over mix the dry and wet ingredients. I also didn’t make the syrup. I was just too hungry!

The waffles didn't really have the pumpkin flavor so using pumpkin just made the waffle more dense. Next time, I would just make a regular cinnamon waffle with this recipe and add pumpkin to the syrup instead. The corn starch amount in the syrup could be halved.

Great changeup for morning waffles! For time savings, be assured there is no need to separate the eggs and beat/fold in the egg whites. I actually forgot to separate the eggs and feared the waffles would be too dense, but I just whisked the wet ingredients well, and the waffles were just fine!  I think next time I'll increase the spices a bit, but otherwise the recipe is great!

Very nice, I didn't make the sauce to go over it. I just used whipping cream and a dollop of syrup.

Flavors were good, not overly strong like everything labeled "pumpkin spice" these days.  We didn't do the cider syrup.... Next time for sure will try that.  Maple syrup with some cinnamon over mascarpone cheese made for a delicious topping.  I may mix a little corn starch into the batter next time for more crispness, as I do in my basic waffle recipe.

A great recipe to usher in Fall.  The recipe is dense, so a little goes a long way.  The syrup is delicious and the use of cider & lemon juice make it a nice contrast to the waffles.  One critical omission is having whipped cream to top them.

I just made this today for breakfast and it was GREAT!  Now I did follow one review and added a tad more pumpkin (maybe a couple spoonfuls more than the 1 cup it called for).  Also I used another tip and used 1 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice and 1 tablespoon cinnamon instead of the ginger and allspice combo.  YUM!  Yes the batter is a bit thicker than normal waffle batter I make, but I cooked longer and they turned out perfect.  Also to the reviewer who said this is a 'messy' recipe; I make waffles from scratch all the time and this is no messier than normal.  Maybe I'm just a slob!  I will say the waffles are not sweet per say, but the dynamite syrup makes up for that.  I did not change a thing when I made the syrup.  Follow it as is (including the butter at the end) and you will not be disappointed!

Doubled batter, quadrupled syrup. Have been lusting after this since it first arrived by email! That leftover thanksgiving cider was just taking up room as it’s original form. What a transformation most definitely a keeper! Never folded egg whites into waffles but I’m thinking it added to their crispyness, no oil, butter or margarine in batter mixture!

The waffles did not come out dense like some reviews said, but I found I did need to add a little more milk to make the correct consistency. The waffles were pretty good, however, the syrup was fantastic and was what made this recipe wonderful.

The wife loves this, and is fantastic with a bit of whipped cream on top. I did find that I had to cook these a bit more in the waffle iron than normal waffles, but that's just a small adjustment.

Followed the recipe, but I adjusted the spices just a bit (didn't have them all so used pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon), waffles turned out light,  fluffy and very flavorful.  Great recipe!

I halved the recipe, since I only had a half cup of pumpkin.  I also used 3/4c almond flour, 1/2c white flour to lower the carbs and increase the fiber.  They were delicious! I will definitely make this again!

I followed the recipe.  I mixed the dry ingredients and made the apple cider syrup the night before to speed things up in the morning.   They were fantastic, everyone loved them.  There were six of us and I had enough leftover waffles to freeze.  Hopefully, they will freeze well as waffles usually do.  I doubled the recipe for the apple cider syrup and glad that I did, it  was delicious and can be used on pancakes or maybe even on a plain sponge cake.    I will definitely make this recipe over and over again.  Some of the other reviewers complained of dense waffles - mine came out very light and fluffy, they were actually moister than waffles usually are.

So admittedly I did not make the syrup as we did not have any apple cider in the house. So maybe that makes all the difference. But these "pumpkin" waffles did not taste like pumpkin waffles to me. They were good. But my family and I could not taste the pumpkin nor could we taste any of the spices. We are big pumpkin fans so that was a total let down. If I were to make these again, I would definitely up the pumpkin and spices. But I will probably just search for a different recipe instead as I'm not quite sure how increasing the pumpkin puree would impact the fluffiness of the waffles themselves.

I made this for two different retreats this fall. The syrup is perfect in taste and consistency!  I also had leftovers that I took home to give to family members and the waffles , that I had frozen, heated up nicely in the oven still wrapped in the tin foil.  I didn't put in the ginger bc I thought it would be too much spice going on so I did add a little more cinnamon. I made mine in a Belgium waffle makers, not sure if that makes a difference for others. The pancakes were light in texture and taste but the flavor really came out when adding the syrup. A very special part of our brunch. Will do this again and again!

Ok, the apple cider syrup is worth 5 stars alone!!! It’s like liquid apple pie!!! Would be amazing on SO many things!

That being said, the waffles were good, but as many other reviewers stated, they were fairly dense, even when folding in the whipped egg whites. It must’ve been the pumpkin purée. I also couldn’t taste any pumpkin, but it may have just needed a little more of the spices. Like I said, they were good, but it was syrup that definitely made them!

I made this for Christmas day breakfast.  The directions of mixing the dry with the wet seemed a bit confusing - not well written.  The egg whites were whipped to  stiff peaks instead of soft.  They were good but I felt the waffles  tasted in even better after frozen and warmed in the toaster!   I saved some time and measured the dry ingredients the day before.  

The apple cider syrup was perfect -- added a great flavor to the waffles.  Then a dalop of whip cream on top! yum

Yum!! These are great breakfast waffles! I made a few healthy changes. I put half a cup of oatmeal to fill in the flour, but I still put half a cup of flour! You also can put  a cup  banana to fill in for the pumpkin completely! You only have to make one change to make it banana muffins. Also, you can only use half a cup of banana and half a cup of pumpkin to make a mix waffle.

Followed the recipe exactly. Whipped the egg whites and all. They turned out great! Very fluffy waffles. We even used a Belgium waffle maker which normally produces deep crisp waffles, this  recipe turned out fluffy and light. This recipe has good flavor but doesn't over power. Unfortunately, we didn't have anything on hand to make the apple cider syrup with. To replace that though I made a cream cheese type filling but cut back on the sugar. Amazing.

Fantastic recipe!!!  I made no changes and encourage others to do the same.  I was appreciative of Allrecipes adjustment for number of servings, saving me from doing my own morning math.  The waffles and syrup are just delicious.  "Best waffles I ever had!" Said my wonderful, appreciative man.  Just make them and enjoy!

This actually made a nicer pancake than waffle, we thought.  Waffles took so long I dumped some mix on a griddle!  I didn't try the syrup, but hope to sometime.

These are amazing!   This is one of those take a bite, put down your fork and savor the moment recipes.   I followed the recipe exactly but did make a couple of rookie mistakes following simple instructions, as per my usual.   In spite of my efforts to ruin this recipe, it came out fantastic.   The waffles are light and tasty.   Not too much pumpkin, not too little.   The syrup is delightful.  Creamy and not too sweet.   My only thing that is wrong with this recipe is that for my tastes, it doesn't make enough syrup.   I feel like the syrup portion of this recipe needs to be doubled.   Thank you for a GREAT recipe.

Great recipe. Wonderful flavors. The syrup is perfect with the pumpkin waffles. The only substitution I made was to add slightly more cinnamon to the recipe and replace the lemon in the sauce with orange and orange zest. The orange flavor is a perfect fall compliment. My only complaint is that the waffles never got crispy and cooking time did not make a difference to change this fact. I cooked these for 4-5 minutes. We'll make these again!

I have made this twice now, but used the "Buttermilk Syrup" recipe instead of the provided recipe for syrup. Also, I had no ground ginger so I added a pinch of mace. After mixing together the dry ingredients, I mixed in all the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients instead of mixing them separately, and also made it more simple by using 4 eggs and not separating the eggs and the yolks. Very good recipe!! But I don't see the purpose behind separating everything and creating more work. It is truly a great recipe without the additional steps!

This was a really great recipe. I'm not too into the separate the eggs type, and I unfortunately had a yolk crack into my egg white bowl, so I never got fluffy peaks to fold in. That being said, I still got a nice waffle out of it. Not dense, but hearty. I liked it a lot. As for the spices, I have a HUGE container of pumpkin pie spice in my cupboard, so I omitted the spices (ginger/allspice/cinnamon) for slightly the same total measure of pumpkin pie spice. It came to 1 1/3 tablespoons, I just used 1 1/2  tablespoons for the same servings and it turned out great. I also just double the whole recipe and used 1 can of pumpkin since I saw no point in wasting it. The waffles turn out great, but the spice still almost felt underwhelming UNTIL I added the cider syrup. Changed the whole dish. The whole family chowed down like nobody's business, my toddler went back for thirds, and I still had some to freeze for quick weekday breakfasts by doubling the recipe. Definitely in Sunday morning rotation

I used 4 teaspoons of Pumpkin Spice instead of all of the individual spices.  I did add 1/4 cup of sugar because I was afraid they were going to be bland like some other reviews claimed.  I don't know if it made that big of a difference.

I love this recipe!! It is very good. I accidentally changed it the first time I made it by adding a whole can of pumpkin puree, almost double what the recipe called for. After trying it the way it is written I liked my accidental changes better. It makes it more flavorful. I also like to make waffle batter the night before so I skip the part about whipping the egg whites and folding them in afterwards. It  makes the prep time a lot faster and the waffle still turn out nice.

My family loves these waffles so much that they have become a regular for weekend breakfasts all year. I adjust the spices to our taste but otherwise make them as the recipe states. They are a hearty waffle that will fill you up, not light or insubstantial, and that's one reason I like them. I haven't tried the Apple Cider Syrup yet because I like the Maple Syrup that is made/sold in my area. They are also delicious with cream cheese or homemade cream cheese frosting on top! Thanks for the recipe!!

I LOVED these waffles! I did take the advice of others and add more sugar, but everything else was done as is and came out PHENOMENALLY!! Fluffy, savory - ALL OF THE ABOVE! I made so many, I froze some and have breakfast for the week.  Thanks again for a dynamic recipe!!

Doubled the batch and made these for Sunday brunch yesterday. Few modifications after reading the other reviews. Since others mentioned a bland taste, I tripled the seasoning and sugar which gave it a nice but subtle flavor. Some said the syrup recipe was not enough for the waffle recipe so I tripled the measurements and had more than enough. Waffles were good alone but really good with the apple cider syrup. They were dense and did need to cook longer in the waffle iron - some almost got burned but it's all good. This is definitely a recipe I will make again.

We used fresh pumpkin for this and it was wonderful! I think it is the sauce that really makes it though. The syrup was incredible!!

These were absolutely delicious! I did use bisquick instead of flour also added a lot more cinnamon and a 1/2 cup of brown sugar I didn't make the syrup instead I drizzled light agave and topped it with some crushed walnuts mixed with cinnamon and sugar

This review is only for the waffle. My kids did enjoy it but... I was not comfortable eating it because it was a little too gooey on the inside for my liking. I cooked them longer that I should and they were still gooey.

Used 2 cups of white and wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups of buttermilk, 1 less egg and added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. It was crispy (although it cooked longer than normal) and not too heavy. I folded in the eggs and let the batter sit. I also used white chocolate chips in the batter so I didn't need any syrup. I added vanilla to the syrup after removing it from the heat. The syrup tasted good but would have been better with the waffles. The syrup was to thick so I'll use less corn starch next time.

Tastes pretty good! I just increased the spices and added some vanilla extract. When my company wakes up tomorrow, we'll just toss these into the toaster to crisp them up. Thanks for the recipe!

Outstanding. The favor combination of apple and pumpkin is wonderful. Not to sweet. Perfect. I really enjoyed this and will make it again for TG morning breakfast. Thank you.

Made it for out of town guest for All Saints Day: sublime.  The Apple Cider syrup sets-off the pumpkin waffle.  Our new Autumnal favorite, perfect for the upcoming holiday season!

Divine! My mom and I made this over the weekend, the whole family fell in love.  We adjusted the waffle batter to be gluten-free, and I toyed with the idea of doubling the syrup recipe because it didn't seem like it would be enough, but as-is the recipe yielded the perfect amount. Delicious and perfect for the season

This is a wonderdul recipe. I doubled the brown sugar and added 1/2 t  pumpkin pie spice. I also added nutmeg to the syrup. Excellent flavors, although I would have liked a little more pumpkin in the waffles. I will definitely make these again!!!

The syrup is amazing! I give it a three because the waffle was bland, tasted just like a whole wheat waffle to me. If the waffle had more of a pumpkin spice taste, pared with the syrup and maybe some chopped walnuts this would be to die for! Syrup is a keeper, keep trying on the waffle.

While I have not made the pumpkin waffles yet, I've been using this cider syrup recipe for over 20 years!  It was in the February 1990 issue of Gourmet magazine.  It calls for half teaspoon each of cinnamon and nutmeg. My 21 year old daughter to this day still calls it her absolute favorite!

ours was a little dry but I substituted 2 1/4 cups of whole wheat flour instead of any all-purpose so I think I could remedy that with adding a bit of applesauce or yogurt next time- so tasty! We also used fresh pureed pumpkin- yum!! Perfect fall dinner! :)

Delicious!  Didn't make the syrup, just the waffles, but I loved them.  Blended the remaining pumpkin from the can with 1/2 cup softened butter and 1 Tbsp brown sugar to make a yummy topping.

We loved these waffles.  I subbed buttermilk for the milk and used just a bit more than the 2 cups called for. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written.    They were light and fluffy and not dense at all. Maybe the buttermilk helped.  I did not make the syrup.  Served with maple syrup and butter and they were delicious.

The syrup was great, would definitely make it again for regular waffles.  You definitely need to cook the waffles longer than usual.  I thought the waffles were pretty blah - not much for flavor even with the spices.  Texture wasn't great either.  I will stick with my regular waffles from now on.

I took the advice of other reviews and added more cinnamon and brown sugar. I agree that these waffles do not cook up quite as crispy as others, but it was not a big deal to us. I got way more than 6 waffles! A double batch made over 20. The apple cider syrup was GREAT! I did not have apple cider so I used apple juice and it was still fantastic. I agree with others that these waffles were not super flavorful. We could not tell that they were pumpkin at all, but we still enjoyed the flavor. I did not expect a super sweet waffle.We might make the waffles again, but I think I will surely make the syrup again.

This was a hit with our family of five!  It was a welcome change from the usual. I followed the recipe and we weren't disappointed.  The waffles were crisp on the outside and warm and tender inside. I kept the finished waffles on a rack in a 200F oven to keep them warm and crisp.  The syrup was very good! I will definitely make that again, but next time I'll double the recipe!

I just made the syrup for some other pumpkin waffle recipe that I made. It is delicious. I used raw cane sugar and spiced cider mix because I didn't want to go to the store. We liked it so much that I made a large batch and am giving it for Christmas Gifts.
Thanks Jeanette B this is very good!
Also very good on Schawn's Apple french toast stix

I only made the Waffles and used regular syrup. The pumpkin taste was not as rich as I had hoped for. Still pretty good

Wow, these were soo good. I have to admit, I did change it a little. I used 1/2 cup ground flax seed in place of 1/2 flour. Used 1 cup buttermilk, one cup regular milk and added a touch of nutmeg.The syrup was fabulous on these. Not dense or hard to cook at all. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was fabulous.  The waffles were full of flavor and the apple cider sytup was out of this world good.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  We will make this often.

I definitely agree that the fabulously intense apple and cinnamon flavor will overwhelm the pumpkin waffles--and they are still freaking awesome!!! I actually had a less-than-my-favorite jug of apple cider, so I boiled it down by about a third to give it more oomph. Worked great. Might try 3/4tsp of cinnamon next time (and I'm a cinnamon junkie). I also want to say about the idea of the syrup overwhelming the pumpkin flavor--how much are we ever really tasting the pumpkin flavor of pumpkin breads anyway over the cinnamon, cloves, and ginger? Do you ever really find yourself saying "what a great squash flavor in that bread"?

My 5 yr old son's favorite!! He tells everyone about the "yummy pumpkin waffles my mom makes for me". I freeze leftovers between sheets of wax/parchment paper and warm up in toaster for a before school breakfast treat. Tasty with just plain maple syrup - but if you have time, the apple cider syrup is fantastic!

This was awesome!  I added about 3 tbsp extra pumpkin, one apple finely chopped, and about 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  I also reduced ginger and allspice to 1/2 tsp. each.  My entire family gobbled it up, even the picky 3 yr old.  Lots of leftovers for freezing, too.

These were great! Made a few changes..added 2 TB sugar and 1/4 tsp fresh ground nutmeg to batter.  Then to syrup added 1 TB Myers dark rum and 1/4 tsp fresh ground nutmeg.  Also used boiled cider (1 TB per 3/4 cup as per KAF site). Concentrated flavor was excellent! Had to double syrup. One recipe was not enough for 10 large Belgium waffles the batter made in my All Clad waffle maker.

Very good! flavorful and definitely not dense. My kids (and I) ate a ton of them! I gave them one big waffle with syrup and then they kept getting more and eating them plain! Which for my syrup loving kids is saying a lot! I didn't make the syrup but will definitely make it the next time.

I made these waffles for brunch over the weekend and agree that the waffle itself is lacking a little something. It really is not that pumpkin-y. I did make the syrup to go with it and everyone seemed to enjoy them so I will make them again but will definitely try to up the flavour somehow. Also, if you're using a Cusinart waffle iron, I found that setting it on 4 was perfect (5 left them burned). If you're planning to make and reheat/toast later, I would cook them at a 3.5.

Good waffles and syrup.  To have light waffles, you have to whip and fold in the whites like the recipe states.

These were super yummy! I didn't make the syrup this time.  Because I had store bought Apple Butter syrup, which had all the same ingredients.  I also added a splash of vanilla to the waffle recipe.    The waffles were delicious and the syrup I used was perfect for them.  I bet the homemade syrup would have made them amazing.  I will defiantly plan ahead next time and make the syrup.  This recipe is a keeper.

So yummy!  I made these for my husband and kids for breakfast, and they loved them.  I will say that the servings listed must be for teenage boys, because this recipe made a LOT of waffles.  I doubled it, so I would have a few extra to put in the freezer, and ended up with 12 waffles left over.  Good thing my boys loved them!  Do make the syrup, it is LOVELY poured over the waffles, and really makes the dish.

These were a big hit on Halloween morning! I used some pumpkin spice in place of the ginger and allspice, as well as used a dash of red food coloring just to bring out the fall feel.   Just a suggestion as well, if you like fruit on your waffles, try using apple sauce and carrow's corn syrup in place of the cider. Its also delicious with some cinnamon and whipped cream  I was also asked to make these on thanksgiving morning. Definitely a favorite recipe.

These were excellent waffles! Our whole family enjoyed them for Halloween breakfast. So smart to use the folded in egg whites to keep a dense batter light.  I used pumpkin pie spice in place of the allspice and a dash of cardamom. Didn't have the apple cider syrup, but will next time.

Great recipe!  After wisking dry ingredients, I just dumped the wet ingredients in, and wisked until mixed in ( I didn't separate eggs, just  wisked them together before I added them).  Excellent texture.  The syrup was the star though.  You can use apple juice.  Gonna try it on vanilla ice cream next!

I have 1.36L of Apple Cider leftover from an apple festival which I didn't know what to do. The Apple Cider syrup in this recipe is delicious!  I have doubled the recipe and it worked great. I may make the rest of the liter to this syrup. Awesome for pancakes, too!

I haven't tried making the syrup but this recipe makes a very nicely flavored pumpkin waffle. My 3yr old asks for them often!  They are a dense waffle. They need to cook a little longer than plain waffles for the outside to become crispy.

Yummy!  This was great.  It made 8 good size waffles in my belgian iron.  When I got to the melted butter part I realized I was out of butter and they were still scrumptious.  So, if you are trying to cut the calories a bit just leave it out!  No one was the wiser.

The sauce was really neat, I left out the butter to make it a sauce instead of a syrup.  I have other pumpkin pancake recipes I like better.

We couldn't resist these. They barely made it to the table. Very tasty , very good texture. Added a little more sugar and whipped the egg whites by hand (about 3 mins.). They were simply the best waffles that I've made so far.

I just made these for our New Years Day breakfast and they were great.  The syrup is wonderful and would taste great on most waffles and pancakes! I did have to cook these a little longer than usual, but well worth the extra minute!

A festive holiday treat.  The waffles are in need of a little more sugar and spice.  I added 1/4 cup of agave syrup, and decreased the milk by 1/4 cup. I used whole wheat pastry flour and replaced the butter with about 1/8 cup canola oil. Out of necessity, I had to replace some of the pumpkin with roasted sweet potato.  If you have problems with the waffles tearing apart when you open the lid, try turning down the temperature and cooking for longer; I've also found that Pam for Grilling spray works better than regular cooking spray.

This could stand to be more pumpkin-y and sweeter as a waffle by itself. However, coupled with the apple cider syrup... it's awesome. I made it exactly as it said, and it turned out great.

yummy. I didn't make the syrup. Instead I made pumpkin butter to put on top, which was great. Also I used the splenda brown sugar mix, and I didn't have any allspice so I just added up all the amounts for the seasonings and substituted pumpkin pie spice.

Not pumpkin-y enough for me... I think I will tweak the recipe next time to make the pumpkin taste really stand out. Other than that, the recipe was great.

Yummm...we didn't try the syrup this time, rather used our old standby which is a cinnamon syrup from a chocolate chip pancake recipe on this site.  We scaled the recipe to 9 servings and got 12 Belgium waffles. Crispy outside and creamy inside...delicious recipe that we will use over and over.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent waffle/syrup combo! I wasn't sure about making the syrup, but it was so simple, and I can't imagine the waffles without it. I'm sure they would need the tweaking other reviewers have mentioned if you decide to skip the syrup, because it compliments them perfectly. I made everything exactly as the recipe calls for, except I substituted 1.5 cups of whole wheat flour. Very, very good, and I was able to make 5 large Belgian waffles from the recipe. Cooked on setting 5 on iron.

These were delicious. Very filling, great texture. I only gave it a 3 because I think the serving size is a bit off: It definitely makes 8 servings, not 6. Also, I did not use the cider syrup, so I felt I could not give it a higher rating. But, the waffles themselves are wonderful. We'll be making them again.

These waffles are wonderful.  My family loved them.  I even made a pumpkin cream to go on top of them, oh my goodness.  A keeper and really good for a cold winter's night.

These are really, really good.  A great way to sneak nutrition into waffles.  The syrup was kind of hit-and-miss here but everyone liked the waffles.  I liked them even better this morning when I reheated them in the toaster.

This was a very different waffle and wonderful!  Loved it.  the syrup was a little bitter, but different was good.
