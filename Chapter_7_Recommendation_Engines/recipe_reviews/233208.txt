This was an awesome recipe. Our family is so accustomed to BBQ ribs - we never try anything new! The brown sugar and pasilla sauce paired well together. It's a mild sauce so even the kids were able to eat and enjoy it. I used three fourths of a jar instead and we still had plenty of sauce to cover them all. We'll definitely fix this again in the future!

I couldn't find the bone-in beef ribs so I made this with boneless. My husband asked me to save the recipe; so this one is a keeper in our house. we plan to try it on other meats. Simple and tasty. Think I will try using less sauce, as the previous reviewer did, as mine did not turn out as thick and I would have liked it to.
