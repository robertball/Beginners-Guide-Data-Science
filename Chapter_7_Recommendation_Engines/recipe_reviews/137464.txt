Your recipe is great! There are many different things that can be included or omitted in paella and the recipe changes from one region to the next.  I use 3 times the amt of saffron and omit the curry.  Good job on your recipe. Thanks!

This was my first attempt at Paella and it turned out wonderfully!  I read somewhere that turmeric can be used in place of saffron--although not the same it is definitely less expensive BUT beware...a little goes a long way!

Great recipe - to answer a previous user the trick to "yellow" and colorful rice is the saffron!  Add more as another user did (even though it's red) it will make the rice a beautiful yellow color.

This was our first time making Paella.  I substituted crab for lobster, but otherwise followed the recipe.  My son, the picky eater, even enjoyed it.  Next time, I will not choose to butcher my own chicken....I would use skinless/boneless thighs.  Also, mine was not as colorful as the picture...very white / light colored....not sure how to get such rich colors.  In looking at other paella recipes, I may choose to add some tomatoes to this next time around to brighten it up.  Overall a thumbs up....My son said, I can make this again.....

I spent the summer in Madrid and this WAS the most authentic recipe I have made.  I changed a few ingredients...More shrimp, no mussels, lobster or clams. However I did add diced 4 oz.can of octopus in garlic oil and I used diced chicken breasts--mainly because I had them on hand!

Delicious recipe! I pretty much made it as directed. I did double the saffron and added about 1/2 tsp of turmeric. It tastes as good as those packaged yellow rice mixes but no artificial ingredients! I did not use any seafood. I used a cut up whole chicken. I browned all the pieces set them aside and proceeded with the recipe. I also used chicken sausage cut into rounds (also cooked them in the pan before adding the rice and liquid) and some cooked pancetta. I used brown rice and I did reduce the liquid to about 4.5 cups total to take into consideration the juices that would come from the chicken. It needs to cook much longer with brown rice. I think about an hour and half. I am using a large enameled cast iron dutch oven to cook everything. It is really delicious. I've added a generous amount of sea salt since I seasoned all the chicken with salt and pepper and added at least 1/2 tsp to the "liquid seasoning" part of the recipe.

Flavor was incredible I only added 3/4 tsp turmeric one more cup of peas and 2 sliced young garlic stalks. My fault was using brown basmati rice which took forever to cook and bad quality frozen lobster tails from Safeway. I'll definitely use this rice recipe again for chicken next time.

I bought a paella pan in Spain and was a little skeptical about how well homemade paella would turn out. I was amazed at how fast and easy this was. For the protein I used shrimp tilapia chunks and canned clams. Other than the rice to liquid ratio I just eyeballed measurements. The dish can easily be adapted based on what you have on hand and what you like. I didn't have saffron so just used a bit of turmeric for color. I don't give many 5 star recipes but this one totally earned it.

I really liked this recipe. Like other users I also would suggest to add more saffron or curry to make it nicely yellow. I must say that I had to adjust the cooking time as my big burner over the stove is not as big to warm up a larger surface of the paella pan. I had to rotate it several times to be able to cook the rice evenly. I also used live mussels but boiled them first before adding them to the rice after the rice started to boil. I also had to cover it with aluminum foil to compensate and even out the heat distribution....the rice came out delicious!

Literally the worst thing I have ever eaten. Followed recipe to a T but it ended up tasting like my mother's gumba garlic gulag soup (which does not taste good at all rest her pathetic soul). I honestly am quite disgusted with this recipe. I would much rather fry some bologna and pair it with a glass of expired over diluted kool aid than try this terrible recipe again.

I'll definitely make it again. I had no lobster but I had a package of Dungeness crab legs I added chorizo since many recipes call for it but used Mexican chorizo instead of Spanish chorizo. I think I may just use some sliced up link sausage next time (maybe some Andouille sausage!) Maybe saute the seasoning mix in the olive oil before adding anything to help infuse the food better. I had to settle for pre steamed frozen clams (oh the ignominy of living in the desert!) And frozen precooked shrimp but it still came out good! It was my first attempt at Paella and the R ce was not QUITE Al dente but almost. This is a very good beginners recipe I think while still being REAL Paella!
