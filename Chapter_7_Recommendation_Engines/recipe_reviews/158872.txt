I would give this four stars, but it needs some tweaking.  It was really runny, like cream of wheat or soft polenta.  Next time I will use 1.5 to 2 cups of chicken broth and omit the butter all together.  Its not necessary.  The flavor of the cauliflower and cheese combination makes this taste a lot like mashed potatoes.  You could probably trick the kids for sure.  I will definitely make again with these changes.
NOTE** Ok, I think I figured it out.  I used about 1.5c chicken broth, simmered for 15 mins, added 1/3c sour cream, 1c parmesean cheese and 2tbsp butter.  I mixed with my hand mixer until I had a blended but slightly chunky (like country smashed potatoes) texture.  LOVE IT>

Yum! I've made this several times before but couldn't quite figure out what was missing.  I think cooking the cauliflower in chicken broth is key...I used chicken broth with roasted garlic and added a little extra garlic.  I pureed the cauliflower in my food processor.  I only used a little bit of the broth as I didn't want them to be too runny.

This was quite yummy and my husband has requested to have it often.  I steamed the cauliflower instead of boiling it in chicken broth and added a few tablespoons of sour cream.  After using the potato masher, I switched to a hand-held mixer.  The consistency was not runny at all.

Cauliflower will never be mashed potatoes and this preparation will fool no one into thinking so.  But as a virtually carb free substitute this was pretty darn good! While I cooked the cauliflower in chicken broth, I drained it completely before adding the cheeses and butter and had no problem at all with its being too soupy. If you like cauliflower in the first place, you'll like it prepared this way.

With a few changes this is a good recipe. I steamed the cauliflower in the chicken broth with a couple tsp of bottled garlic. When it was done I drained the broth into a bowl. Then used my wand blender and added a little broth at a time until I had the thickness I wanted. To get the "mashed potato" consistency I added a couple tablespoons of heavy cream. You could use half & half, but I didn't have any. Of course this adds cals and fat, but gives a wonderful consistency! To cut down on the cheese I used crumbled gorgonzola (about 3 T) instead of the cheddar and parm. Fabulous if you like that taste!

Good stuff, but with some healthier modifications -- no cheese, just a touch of chicken stock, drizzle of olive oil and lots of garlic.  Kept it simple and flavorful - took a while for my boyfriend to warm up to it, but he ultimately liked it.

This actually isn't too bad. I say that because I don't like cauliflower.  At all.  But I had two small servings of this one.  Doesn't get five stars though bc of a few things.  It was pretty difficult to mash the cauliflower, so I plopped it all in the food processor to smooth it out, although the texture was still a bit grainy.  Also, there is a ton of liquid.  I drained as other reviewers did,but added about a tablespoon of broth back in.  I did use the amount of butter called for but didn't add any salt and used less cheese.  I also subbed feta for the cheddar and added roasted garlic.  With all these changes, it was good.  Otherwise, would have been very runny.  Thanks for sharing.

This was good the second time I made it. I steamed the cauliflower instead of boiling it-so it wont be runny, also I used olive oil instead of butter to make it a little healthier.

Reduce the liquid by half. Boil with bay leaf and onion, then discard when you wish to smash cauliflower.  Add 2 mashed potatoes to mashed cauliflower.  At the end stir in about 2 Tbsp more butter than called for.  Add 3 Tbsp powdered milk to broth for more flavor.

This was amazing!!  I did follow another reviewers advice and did the following.  1.5cup chicken broth, 1tbs butter, and when adding the cheese I also added 1/3cup plain greek yogurt.  A really great substitute to mashed potatoes! *UPDATE*  I have made this now several times and tweaked it each time, try adding about 3-4 cloves minced garlic when you put the cauliflower in the broth for a more garlic mashed taste.  Also, be sure to drain any excess broth before mashing, that is key to preventing it from being runny.  This is truly a staple in our house now and an excellent substitute to mashed pots.  I will be serving it again tonight with Roasted rack of lamb and asparagus.

I thought this recipe was very good, I followed someones advise and drained the liquid. It came out too dry and I added some milk. I also did not add the cheddar cheese, I added more Parmesan. I use Pecorino Romano, which I find is a more creamier and less salty taste as other grated cheeses. This is served at many local restaurant in my area, this recipe is close to, but not as good. Thank you for a the recipe

i'm giving this a 4 for a great starting point, but i am love with how i have adjusted this recipe.  i boil the cauliflower in the broth for flavor, but drain off all the broth when the florets are tender.  i mix in 1/3 or 1/2 cup or so of sour cream, s+p, and a cup or so of shredded cheddar (no parm).  then just mash as you would potoatoes.  i don't think you need all of the broth, as it would be very runny that way.  i served this at xmas dinner and there was none left!  very yummy!!

I made this, but as basic as possible (because I didn't have some of the ingredients, and hey, its healthier!) In my version, I added a bag of cauliflower to a pot of salted boiling water, and let it boil till till the florets were very very tender. I then drained into a colander, and this is important- carefully smushed them flat while in the colander to drain out the excess water. When no longer dripping, tossed them back into pot with 3tbsp margarine, 1tbsp garlic, 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper, and smashed until smooth with a potato masher. :) Now its one of my fave vegetable side dishes!!! I'm excited to eat a vegetable that's so cancer-fighting and awesome! Woot!

Great recipe.  But with all recipes of this type BAKE the cauliflower whole, wrapped in foil.  This eliminates the unwanted extra moisture common to so many recipes.  This also enhances the veggies flavor.  When mashing add a sachet of dried chicken bouillon.  I also added fried onion and some bacon bits.

Incredible substitute for mashed potatos! My boyfriend loved them as well. I did cut down the chicken broth to 2 cups. When boiling the cauliflower I added garlic. When the cauliflower was ready I added 2T butter, fresh pepper, sea salt, parsley and 2T of half and half... and everyone wanted more!!!

Tasty even without the 1 cup of cheese.  I just used 1/4 cup of fresh grated parmesan cheese.  I also added 3 cloves of garlic to the pan with the cauliflower.  I used one can of chicken broth and made up the difference with water. I poured off all but a 1/2 cup or so of the liquid when the cauliflower was almost soft and let it cook all the way down.  After mashing in the pan, I continued to cook the cauliflower to get out the extra moisture.  I finished the dish with a little butter, sliced green onion tops, and black pepper.  Will definitely make this again.  To get a texture even closer to mashed potatoes but without all the carbs, add one quartered potato to the recipe and cook and mash along with the cauliflower.

I love cauliflower, so I figured I'd try this out. I didn't want to boil the cauliflower, because it would make the cauliflower too soupy. So I steamed under some veggie stock for about 5 minutes, reserved the stock, and combined everything as per the recipe. I slowly added some stock until I had the consistency I wanted. As others have said, added a couple of potatoes will give you a fluffier cauliflower mash, but I like this as is.

I do not understand why this recipe is being touted as healthy, figure friendly etc. It sounds good, I will make it, but I doubt it is healthier and lower in calories than plain old mashed potatoes due to the butter, cheeses etc.  Who are we kidding?

I did this but it was runny (my mistake, not a big enough cauliflower)  so to fix it I threw in just enough instant potatoes to thicken.   Fantastic taste though.  Will try it again but properly.

I don't like cauliflower all by itself, but like this its good. I found it a bit salty but that could have been me; I thought maybe it was the parmesan cheese but not sure. Either way this is a nice way to eat cauliflower especially for low carb diets.

My 15 year old and I LOVE this stuff!  We steamed the cauliflower then put it in the blender with some milk, parmasan cheese, a bit of butter, salt and pepper.  She thinks it tastes like mashed potatoes--one of her faves.  Mine too.

Just me and hubby for dinner so I cut this down.  Used fat free, reduced sodium chicken broth 2 cups.  Added in some minced onions and simmered for 15 mins.  Strained the cauliflower and mashed.  Added sharp cheddar cheese and parm cheese.  Forgot the butter but it didn't need it.  Added pepper but zero salt.  Perfect side dish for the potato alternative!

Way too watery. Separated upon smashing into an odd consistency. Do not add any salt, cheeses and parm are plenty salty. Does not feel 'figure friendly' when eating it, felt way too heavy. Could barely eat a half cup portion.

Thank you JAMVS for this simple but delicious recipe. I knew from the directions that this was going to be a little on the wet side but went ahead and followed it anyway because I was craving for gravy (it's Thanksgiving). It tasted really good and looked perfect on the plate with a couple slices of spinach, cheese and sausage stuffed pork loin roast.

I cut back the chicken broth to 1 3/4 C and it was still runny. I also made the mistake of trying to mash it with a hand blender and that just didn't work well. Next time I will use the food processor. The flavor was good but needs some work on the texture and consistency. Will make it again though. Thank you

Tastes like cauliflower, nothing special.  I added milk, and extra butter.  Next time I'll add more butter, this is a good low carb substitute for potatoes.  And although it is good, nothing can really compare to potatoes, so don't get your hopes up too high.

I tried another reviews edit to this recipe (by adding half the chicken stock and adding sour cream). It was delicious ! It was literally gone in seconds.

My family was divided on this recipe.  At first I really liked it, but then as I ate more the cheese flavour was really getting to me.  If I make this again I'll omit the cheese altogether as others have suggested.  Hard on the tummy :(

The taste is alright, it's just the texture that I don't really find appealing. Just don't expect this to have the texture of mashed potatoes.

Don't be fooled, this is not to be confused with mashed potatoes, even with children..but it's still a very good side.  For those cutting carbs, or just looking to add a tasty veggie side, this was a good one.

Tasted fantastic, but I didn't care for the consistency.  It was a little too mushy.  I'd like to try one reviewers suggestion and a little heavy cream to it - that would probably help.   Or perhaps I just overmashed them.

a good basic recipe to work from...I didn't follow the recipe as didn't have the right ingredients but the gist of it is good!  Try it once and then suit to your likes: I steamed the cauliflower til very soft and added: 2-3 T concentrated chicken broth 3 T powdered milk mixed with just enough water to make it a paste  garlic 2 slices American cheese (it was all i had in back of fridge!) Tried to mash it but was too watery/hard so blended it in my mini-food processor but was still too blobby, so used my hand wand (not easy w/o too much liquid) and the texture taste was close to mashed potatoes!!!  really!!  (but keep your expectations realistic!) thanks for the idea, is worth some more tweaking!

Maybe I did something wrong, but I really followed the directions! The liquid didn't reduce to half, even after 20 minutes. There was still a cup of liquid in the pot.

I love mashed cualiflower, we eat it very often.  Here are a few changes that I made, to make it a little healthier.  I steam my cauliflower, then mash it with my ricer.  I like the texture like this, but many don't.  If you want more like whipped potato, use the food processor to mash.  Also, rather than the butter and the cheese, I use 2 or 3 oz of low fat cream cheese(neufchattel), and then I season it with garlic powder and pepper.  My kids love these "twice baked".  After mashing, I put them in a baking dish, top with a little bit of low fat cheese, and some turkey bacon bits.  It goes under the broiler until the cheese is melty.

This is so good!  I drain the broth after the cauliflower has softened as they seem a little runny otherwise. I highly recomend this as a side dish!

I followed another reviewers recipe and did 1 1/2 C chicken broth with garlic, 1/3 C plain Greek yogurt, salt & pepper, 1C cheddar cheese, maybe 1/4C parm. (didn't measure) and 1T butter. Next I put the cauliflower in the food processor and pulsed it a few times before adding the rest of the ingredients. I also added 4t of the chicken broth while processing to smooth it a bit more. It turned out smooth and creamy just like mashed potatoes and my skeptical kids actually liked it! I will definitely make again!

This is so delicious once you can figure out how to get the right consistency. I would recommend halving the liquid and then draining and saving it after the cauliflower is done steaming, adding back only as much as you need to get the right consistency. After taking some cues from other reviews, I used veggie stock to keep it vegetarian and cut it in half but it was still soupy. Luckily I had another head of cauliflower that I was able to steam up and add to the original pot. That was perfect. I used 2 tablespoons butter and 1/3 cup sour cream. The flavor was amazing!

Way too much chicken broth. I removed my cauliflower from the broth & add 1/2 cup & it was still too much. Next time I will not add any chicken broth to the mix & spoon it in as needed.

I agree with previous reviews that it turned out a little runnier than the consistency of regular mashed potatoes. Also, I decided not to add the cheddar cheese and instead added the just the parmesan cheese. But doing this only made the cheese melt in a stringy and gloppy fashion. Also, next time, I would only add have the amount of butter.

What a delicious side dish, especially for low carb-ers! I used one 16oz bag of frozen cauliflower, and only 3tbsp of butter, and it was perfect. I also used the regular orange cheddar cheese, and omitted the Parmesan because my picky hubby doesn't like it. When he tried them, he said they're better than mashed potatoes! And he is the stereotypical meat and potatoes kind of guy! WOW!

This was delicious! Even my 3 1/2 year-old and 22 month-old were asking for more!  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and just cooked the cauliflower in the chicken broth until tender and then drained it (I reserved the broth in case I wanted to add some back in, but I didn't need it). I only used 2 TBS of butter and I also added some fresh minced garlic.  I didn't have any parmesan on hand, but it still tasted terrific!  This was the perfect side dish to serve with the "Best London Broil Ever" from this site.

I read other reviews and agree that it would be too soupy with 3 cups of chicken broth.  I used 1.5 cups of broth and just over 1 tablespoon of butter was plenty.  Also, I had to substitute mozzarella cheese instead of white cheddar.  It tasted great.

This is a great and easy recipe! Like other reviewers, I simmered it for 15 minutes instead of ten and then strained out the remaining liquid so that it wouldn't be runny. I added fresh garlic and didn't use any butter with all the cheese, I didn't think it was necessary... it came out perfectly --not at all runny and super tasty! It certainly isn't mashed potatoes, but it's a good alternative. I will definitely be making this again!

This was okay.  I could definitely taste the cheese and cauliflower but those were the only two flavors.

I read the reviews saying it was too runny, but then some said they drained it and it was too dry. So I drained a lot of the broth when the cauliflower was done cooking, but not all of it. I should have drained all of it as it was still a little runny. I thought I could mash it with a fork, but it was pretty hard so a potato masher is a good idea. I used some Greek yogurt instead of butter and vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I also added chives. Overall pretty good. Tasted better leftover the next day actually.

Try it with Greek yogurt, I can't believe it's not butter steam the cauliflower in the over wrapped in foil for 45 mins then puree it. MUCH MUCH healthier and thicker and has a more potato taste ith greek yogurt

Very tasty, with tweaking. The recipe calls for way too much liquid; this should be reduced by half unless you like watery mash. To solve this problem I used cornstarch to thicken it to the right consistency, as I hadn't read any reviews prior to making. I also added some sour cream as another reviewer mentioned, changed the amounts of cheese to half a cup of each and a little less butter. I chose to use mild white cheddar and grated dairy product (contains Parmesan and processed cheese) since that is what i had on hand. This is definitely healthier than eating potatoes, and since cauliflower has been on sale here frequently I'll be adding this to my rotation.

I've actually made a much simpler version of this by just steaming the cauliflower, adding the butter and parmesian because I didnt have any other cheese. It tastes almost as good as the original recipe- and is kid approved. My 5 year old who hates mashed potatoes loves smashed cauliflower.

I ended up steaming the cauliflower with the chicken broth then adding the cheese, no butter, some garlic powder, and 1/3 cup sour cream then smashed it with a potato masher. Turned out pretty good and got rave reviews from my family.

I thought the cauliflower turned out a little runny.  Next time, like some of the other reviews, I'll reduce how much chicken broth I use, and some of the other suggestions that Brooke006 suggested.

I really liked this version. I remember my mom making these a while ago and they had no flavor. These had wonderful flavor! I did cook until almost all the liquid was gone. It still seemed a bit runny. Also, I didn't have white cheddar. used a bit more parmesan and just a sprinkle of mild cheddar.

I agree with other reviewers to drain before mashing. I didn't have to add any liquid and they were fine. Really liked the recipe and will use again, but will play around with the cheese and butter content. For personal reasons I would cut down next time on both items as it was a little on the rich side for a week nite meal. Try this recipe it;s a nice change from mashed potatoes!

This was pretty good!  I did not expect it to fool anyone but it did - both of my picky teenage boys commented on how much they liked the *potatoes*! ;D  I did drain the cauliflower completely as it would have been very soupy otherwise.  Added a little dried parsley over the top for color.  We'll be having this again!

Drain the cauliflower of almost all liquid.  Three cups broth will not reduce in half that fast and this will be mushy slop. I make my cauliflower just like mashed potatoes. You can add shredded cheese once mashed.  Does not even need mlk added.  Yummy

i gave 4 stars b/c i didn't follow the recipe exactly.  but it was super duper yummy how i did it.  i sprinkled the cauliflower with garlic powder and microwaved steamed in boullion till soft. then i processed adding small amount of liquid (probably little less than 1/4 cup) and about 1/3 cup shredded parmesan, approximately a tablespn butter (smart balance), salt & pepper.  we loved it!  very tasty and we thought it really did taste like mashed potatoes.

While I certainly wouldn't mistake this for mashed potatoes, it was a very nice (and easier!) cheesy and buttery alternative to baked cauliflower with cheese sauce.  I did think the recipe needed a bit more color, however, so I used a cheese blend and added a few shakes of paprika on each serving.  And one other suggestion I might make is to drain the cauliflower and reserve the chicken broth.  Then add as much back as you need for the proper consistency and texture.

YUM!  I used less of the reduced chicken stock when smashing than called for, and used shredded co-jack as we didn't have white cheddar, but it was very cheesy and tasty and we will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this once when I wanted mashed potatoes, but was out of potatoes. We loved it! I followed the suggestions and only used 1 1/2 cups of broth and even then I drained off some before mashing.

I boiled the cauliflower in the 3 cups of broth, but them poured out half of it before mashing it up. I think the butter could easily be omitted. I will definitely make this again. It was great with steak and green beans, and a nice alternative to mashed potatoes!

I've been trying to hard to eat my vegetables, even though I don't like them.  This dish looked like mashed potatoes and smelled really good, but the texture was definitely still cauliflower.  I will perhaps try a food processor and puree it next time.

This was very good. After reading reviews, I decided to drain all the broth before mashing and am glad I did. It was still a bit runny. I can't imagine leaving all the broth in. Very delicious though and will make again.

Yum! This recipe tastes "better than the best mashed potatoes!" It has a great cheesy flavor and texture. Its best if you drain most of the liquid, not all, after cooking the cauliflower, before adding the butter and cheeses. This makes it not too runny. I mashed it until the cheese was melted and then blended it in a blender, giving it a smooth texture. I used cheddar and asiago cheese. Everyone loved it and appreciated how healthy it is. Great recipe!

Very tasty, but super runny! 3 cups of chicken broth is way too much if you like chunky or even slightly chunky texture. Next time I will try half of the chicken broth.

This recipe is very tasty! It is a good sub for mashed potatoes but has a very different taste and texture. I used only 2 c. chicken broth and drained off the extra after it was done cooking. I also added some minced garlic to the cauliflower while it simmered. I added a big dollop of fat free plain greek yogurt and not as much cheese as the recipe calls for, mashed it up by hand and it turned out great! My boyfriend said he likes it better than mashed potatoes!

Tasted good.  Healthy.  But too wet and too salty.  I added a grated potato to thicken, and some dried milk too. Right idea tho.

The flavor of this was very good, however like other reviewers, I found it to be way to runny and I had to drain it after adding all the cheese. I will definitely make this again and only use 1.5 cups of broth. I also used regular cheddar and it worked very well. I found that no salt was needed because there was plenty of salt in the cheese

2 bags frozen cauliflower and make sure to let enough water evaporate, or just use less when making broth from bullion. Delicious!

This recipe did not work out for me.  It turned out more like a cheese soup.  Too watery and too much cheddar cheese.  Won't try it again.

This is good. Will probably make again. Kids ate it without complaining, that was exciting! I might try different cheeses in it & add more butter.

Very good, first time trying it and I as many other reviewers stated made some changes. First I threw in 4 cloves of garlic ( I love garlic)  also drained all of the chicken stock when it was done cooking. added in onion powder, garlic powder salt n pepper and a little bit of heavy cream for good measure :). Enjoy

Very good with the reduction of the broth to 1.5 cups. Be careful with the liquid, as it will turn mushy very fast. I served this with the Creamy Chipotle Chicken slow cooker recipe from this site and it was a nice low-carb meal. Thanks for sharing!

Mmm... I have to say I did alter the recipe, but found it delicious! I cooked the cauliflower as directed, but then drained it completely. I then whipped it with a hand mixer with the butter and cheeses and added in a little half and half to get the right consistency. Definitely not low-fat, but delicious. Will be making this again!

Good recipe, however I took the hints from other reviews and I tweeked it just a bit. Instead of the chicken broth, I used 2% milk. It really made it a little creamier and it tasted alot more like mashed potatoes that way. The milk blended better with the cheeses and the butter element. Other than that, GREAT idea, will use from now on, good substitute for mashed potatoes

good idea, but way to runny. You need to drain the cauliflower before you mash it.

This is so delicious!!! After I was done boiling the cauliflower I removed some of the chicken broth so it wouldn't be too watery. I also used regular shredded cheddar cheese. SO GOOD! I was pleasantly surprised.

Kids were clueless this was cauliflower and ask for it often. I use 2 heads of cauliflower and 4 cups broth. It is important to let it simmer until the liquid has reduced to half. Instead of using the vermont white cheddar I thicken it with Idahoan White cheese instant potatoes. It solves the runny problem and the fact I can't find that cheese any where.

We really enjoyed this.  I used less broth and cooked so the it was mostly gone, either that or you would want to drain before adding remaining ingred. and finishing the recipe.

I took the advice of several other reviewers and cut the chicken broth back to 1 1/2 cups and the butter to 2 tablespoons. I also added garlic and some other seasonings to taste and 1/2 cup of half and half.  I used a little velveeta and sharp cheddar because I forgot to get the parmesan and it was delish!  Not sure why people are saying they drained the cauliflower.  I just let the liquid cook off while I added the cheese and half and half.

It was great.  For what it's worth, I typically eyeball recipes, which I did for this.  I drained the broth after cooking and probably added 1/4 cup back in.  I didn't use that much butter.  I didn't have the white cheddar cheese but threw in a slice of pepper jack.

The adults liked the flavor/texture; the kids did not. They wouldn't touch it after one bit. But they're kids, so we take their critique with a grain of salt! Definitely use the blender on this one to get it to the right consistency.

I thought this recipe was absolutely delicious!  However, like so many have posted, it tends to be runny.  After reading the various reviews, I made it a point to drain all of the broth but it was still kinda runny.  I added 1/2 c. of low cal cream cheese and that improved the consistency somewhat.   I used an immersion blender and the end result was like a very, very thick sauce, but not like mashed potatoes.    I'm wondering if it's not the fact that cauliflower, when fully cooked, retains a lot of liquid.  Next time I may cook it to just tender and see of that makes for a thicker consistency.   The flavor was phenomenal.

The only complaint I have it looks more like lil tiny pieces of coliflower not the smashed patato  look can any one tell me how to make it look more like mashed patatos I have used the kitchen aide with the paddle but that seem like it did not work too well

my picky cauliflour-hating husband even liked it. I used a hand-blender to make it smooth, and found that that made it less runny than the time before when I just used the potato masher.

This is super yummy and a great substitute for mashed potatoes. We like garlic so I added that to the cauliflower and broth and then I used an immersion blender to smash the cauliflower and that kept it from being too soupy.

When mashing the cauliflower, I added a couple tablespoons of the hot chicken broth that the cauliflower cooked in. I made this a baked dish by adding half of the cheddar cheese to the mashed cauliflower, then I poured the cauliflower mash into a greased baking dish and sprinkled the remaining cheddar cheese and the parmesan over the top. I baked it until the cheese was crusty and melted on top. We loved this dish, even the boys. NO leftovers.

Tasted pretty good but only got mediocre reviews from family members. May have been that they are just not cauliflower lovers. It doesn't quite take the place of potatos but would be a wonderful addition to an otherwise complete meal.

This was pretty good. I used a bag and a half of frozen cauliflower and boiled it in about half the amount of broth called for. It wasn't runny at all, but a skosh bland.

I actually used this recipe as the topping to a shepherd's pie and it was awesome!  The perfect addition for that.  However, I gave it four stars because I don't think it would be good by itself as a mashed potato substitute.  Will have to try again though.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Tasty, but too watery. Next time I will strain the cauliflower before adding the butter, cheese, etc.

This is smashalicious!!! I used a really large head, and so used only a half-cup less broth than called for. Everything else was followed exact with scrumptious results! This one gets carded. Thanks for sharing this!

Thanks to all you tipsters for the warning about being runny. After cooking, I drained the liquid into a bowl and gradually added a small amount of it after mashing the cauliflower and cheese. Still did not have the right consistency, so I threw in a large handful of potato flakes-that did the trick!

This recipe is pretty soupy. I liked the suggestion about taking out the broth and then adding it back in till you get the desired consistency. Taste is great though!

Tasty with the cheeses and I think the broth gave it a nice flavor but as others have said it came out too runny. The next time I will used less broth probably by half. I didn't use the butter.

YUMMY. I used it for shepherds pie instead of mashed potatoes; therefore I did not mix in the cheddar cheese, but I put it on top of the whole dish.  I omitted the chicken broth, because I was worried it would be too salty and runny and I didn't have any on hand anyway...  I simply steamed the cauliflower in the microwave and it was a nice texture.

I drained and kept the broth, adding a little as I mixed the cauliflower.  This was wonderful, everyone LOVED it.  I've made this a few times already and will continue making in the future.

Yum! I had smashed cauliflower at at a restaurant recently so was anxious to try making it on my own. I used about half the amount of butter and stronger tasting cheeses (extra sharp cheddar and romano) so I could use less cheese to lighten it up a bit. The chicken broth didn't reduce much. I could tell there was still a lot of liquid in there, so I drained it most of the way before adding everything else. Next time I'll probably drain it completely b/c the finished dish was pretty soupy. Still giving it five stars b/c it was so yummy and that's easily fixable. Great recipe, a keeper.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish, although I made slight changes based on another recipe I have seen and what I had on hand: I only used 1 cup of chicken broth and subsituted the butter and cheeses with 1/4 cup of the following cheese blend (parmigiano, feta, one mashed garlic clove and 1tbsp of milk). Wasn't soupy at all!

Enjoyed this. A little too cheesey for my taste so I will use less cheese next time or use a milder cheese. I did not have any Vermont white cheddar. Used mild cheddar instead. My  2 y/o son loved it.

My  husband and I don't like cauliflower but this tasted good. I didn't use any of the cheddar cheese and only about 1tbs of butter. I also added a little sour cream and roasted garlic. It was definitely a little watery. Next time I'll use less broth or more cauliflower. It only made about 2 servings with the head I used.

I really liked this and I'm not a califlower eater.  I agree that it seemed a little runny but I added 2 tablespoons of cream cheese and put it back on the stove on low for about 5 minutes and it was perfect.  I will make this again!  Thanks!

It's ok.  I've made it twice -- followed reviewers advice the second time, and it still tastes like runny cauliflower with cheese.  It doesn't taste good.  Just not what I was expecting.

It was great to have another recipe for cauliflower that was not a casserole.  This was yummy -I cut the cheese in 1/2, eliminated the broth and added some fresh chopped olives (I was not trying to pass it off as mashed potato)..will make it again.

This is definitely going to join the rotation. While the consistency was more like grits than mashed potatoes it was very tasty. I experienced the same issue reported by many with respect to it being too moist. To resolve it I used the good old corn starch/cold water thickening agent. Although it adds some carbs ( I used only about a Tbsp) after removing all the moisture ( n

Mine turned out spectacular.  Had a small head of cauliflower, so added 1 cup of broth.  Drained broth, added a pat of butter, 1/4 cup of white cheddar, 1/4 cup parmesan, a dash of roasted garlic powder, some salt and pepper an smashed it all with a tater masher.  YUMMY GOODNESS! I think I'll make a big batch for the Thanksgiving potluck!

I made this recipe but took the advice of reducing the amount of broth. I did 1 3/4 cups of broth and it still did not reduce enough, so I drained the excess. I added only 3 tbsp of butter and also added garlic powder, grated and shredded Parmesan instead of the cheddar (because I didn’t have it). It came out good, but I’ll probably still tweak it more the next time I make it. Good start to my keto repertoire.

Did you ever get a cheese with the thought that you’ll try it... only to have it sit in your fridge for months? Well, this recipe called for white cheddar and Parmesan cheeses. I had no cheddar!... but I did find a chunk of “Prima Donna Mature Red” in my cheese drawer. I had no idea what kind of cheese it was but after a quick Siri search I discovered it is a different/replacement for Parmesan. Oh my, it was hard to cut, but I did finally find some soft cheese in the middle of that rock-hard wedge, and I didn’t even nick myself in the process! The cheese had a tangy, robust Parmesan flavor, so I added it to the drained, boiled cauliflower, in the food processor with a pat or so of butter and a spoon of Greek yogurt, and no-salt (I’m watching my sodium), pepper and a sprinkle of garlic powder.
The result was that it was smooth and creamy and absolutely delicious!
 Yummy-freak’n-yummy!
So, the cooking technique for the cauliflower was spot-on, as well as the seasonings, and I did add yogurt as a previous reviewer  suggested.

OMG!! I didn't imagine that I would like this as much (if not more) than mashed potatoes. And super healthy!
I make this often and I like to substitute some of the cheddar with smoked gouda just because that's my favorite.
You could really explore with different cheeses.
Even my husband loves it and he is definitely a potato guy!

Not bad.  I steamed it over the broth instead of boiling it in the broth.  I let it steam a very long time and used only the drained cauliflower, not any liquid broth, in the finished product (since it had steamed a long time, a lot of moisture was already in the cauliflower - adding any broth would have made it too soupy).  It mashed up well using an ordinary potato masher.  I did add a little powdered chicken soup stock and sour cream.  With all of the cheese, butter, and sour cream this is probably not all that healthy - maybe next time I'll cut back on those ingredients and see how it comes out.

This was a great way to substitute a starch with a veggie! Next time I'll use less broth (too liquidly).

Exceptionally yummy!  I made this for the family for New Years day.  Even those who don't care for cauliflower loved it! If you follow the recipe exactly and cook the cauliflower until the liquid boils down to half it is definitely not runny.  I think the other reviewers must have missed that step This was a big hit with everyone and I followed the recipe exactly.  I will definitely make this again!

This was a winner. My only modification was to drain the chicken broth off of the cauliflower before adding in the other ingredients. My family loved this.

This was so good, fast, and easy to make. I strained the cauliflower after it boiled, so it wasn't runny. I forgot the butter, and it was still good. This will definitely be my go-to substitute for mashed potatoes.

I needed to drain some liquid because otherwise it would've been too watery and mushy. Once I drained it and finished preparing it, it was delish! My guests couldn't get enough of it :)

Was very good but i steamed the cauliflower with about 4 cloves of  garlic in the broth. I did not have the white cheddar cheese so I used more parmesan.

Great recipe!  I ended up boiling in beef broth, then drained.  While draining, I used a masher to get all of the liquid out.  After that, I followed the recipe minus the butter, and subbed onion and chive cream cheese.  Beat with a mixer.  Delicious and a huge hit!  Sorta satisfies that mashed potato texture, but is very flavorful.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was awesome. Whole family loved it! I ended up draining about 1/2 cup of liquid before smashing, figured I could always add it back in but it wasn't needed. I used sharp cheddar instead of vermont white cheddar becuase it's what I had on hand. Will definitely make this again!

It was way too wet, and with the amount of cheese and butter used it ceases to be a healthy dish. I'll have to try some of the suggested variations to see what makes this a healthy alternative to mashed potatoes.

I made two servings of this, to try out before unleashing it on the whole family. The first few bites were nice, but this quickly became heavy in my tummy and made me queasy.  I would have to cut back on the cheeses and butter if I made this again, and then it wouldn't really be the same recipe, so it's not for me.

I loved it!  I did some changes, I used half of the recommended broth and added at simmer time 1 1/2 tsp of minced garlic. After simmer I drained out liquid, mashed the cauliflower and added 1/4cup parmesean cheese,  1/2 cup of weight watchers mexican blend cheese and pepper to taste. I loved it.

We loved this cauliflower recipe, however, I didn't add the cheeses as I didn't want to add extra calories, but this tasted amazing with just the butter (I used low calorie margarine) alone.  Update:  made it with the cheeses and it's delish!!!

5 stars!! Next time I would us about a 1/2 cup less of the broth but only because I skipped the chedder cheese for dietary reasons so it was a bit thin. I also added a bit of cajun seasoning for a little zing.  SOOOO good!

The first time I made this it was VERY soupy. I added instant mashed potatoes to thicken and it saved the dish :) it had great flavor so I wanted to try again. This time I drained off all but a little bit of liquid before I mashed and it turned out perfect! Rave reviews at the thanksgiving table. Great dish!!

Delicious!  We did not have white cheddar so used a cup of mozzarella instead since it was white along with fresh parmesan.  We added a chopped yellow onion and a tablespoon of garlic.  We added the onion and garlic towards the end while the cauliflower and broth were reducing.  We let the mix reduce down longer than 10 mins and only drained off a small amount of the broth at the end as others recommended before mixing in the cheese and butter and it was more like a whipped mash (we used a hand masher). Tasted amazing and will definitely make again without changing any of the above.

TOO MUCH LIQUID! This is way too runny as written. I wish I had read the other reviews first but I followed the recipe to the letter. If I had drained the broth it would be good. As it was I wound up adding cream and just having it as cauliflower soup. Very good taste.

I was doing a no potato thing for a while and this was a great substitute.  Not that anyone would be fooled in to thinking this was smashed potatoes, but this was a great side dish.  I could almost eat it as a main dish.

This is an awesome dish...will definitely be making it regularly for family/friends! Followed suggestions from others to drain broth so it wasn't runny.

Easy and super good. I left out the cheese and added green onions because I had a ton. Even my meat-guzzling man had seconds. I wish I had more cauliflower, because I would make this dish again right now.

I made this with veggie broth and added light sour cream and fresh garlic.  Not mashed potatoes, but yummy when trying to reduce carbs or have something to pig out on without feeling guilty.

This is a wonderful recipe!  Very flavorful, I love the texture.  I prepared this just as written, however; for the future I would halve the chicken broth so it isn't so runny.

I thought this recipe was very interesting, as Smashed Cauliflower was a completely new way for me to prepare cauliflower. I wasn't sure if I would like it, but discovered since the cauliflower can soak up the flavors of the broth, butter, or whatever else you decide to add to it, it is the prefect vehicle for imitating mashed potatoes! I give this recipe 5 stars!

Used some of the modifications suggested by others, like draining and adding back the broth to achieve the right consistency, adding garlic, and trying different cheeses.  Good, just not my favorite.

This was great! I used much less butter, added low fat sour cream and omitted the cheese completely. My husband is a die hard mash potato man, so I didn't think this would go over, but wanted to try it. He loved it, went back for seconds.

I really liked this - but my family didn't care for it (I think the texture got them).  I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand - I added some cream cheese and heavy cream.

I followed the recipe to the letter and it tasted great, but was very soupy. I added instant potato flakes to it and it did bulk it up but changed the taste a bit. I will make this again, only I will drain and reserve the broth and add it as needed while mashing the cauliflower.

This is kind of like runny potatoes.  The cauliflower does not whip like mashed potatoes, but it tastes like them.  I would reduce the amount of broth to 2 cups next time since the cauliflower itself releases some liquid.  Maybe that would cut down on the "runny-ness."  Otherwise a great way to sneak in veggies.

Instead of Vt cheddar, I used about 1/4 cup of sour cream and onion dip (like Utz or Heluva Good) and reduced the butter to 1TB.  I pulsed it in the food processor and it was absolutely fabulous!

I thought this was very good - I skipped the broth and just used water, cooking until tender, then I drained, leaving just a little cooking liquid,  and mashed with the butter and cheese.  I also stirred in about a tbsp. of light sour cream.  Although this could never pass as potatoes, it's a very good side dish.  I like cauliflower anyway, but I can also see where people who aren't crazy about it would still enjoy this yummy, cheesy dish.

Good! My husbad HATES cauliflower, but will eat this. I keep the broth the same as what the recipe says, not what another reviewer suggested, and then add about a half a cup of potato flakes. Great and healthy.

This was soooo good! It's my new favorite vegetable recipe. Next time I'll double it since we didn't have enough left overs. Also, I used 2 c instead of 3 c broth. It was still a bit runny so even less would be good, although I didn't mind it runny. The best part was my 1 yr old loved it...she eats like a bird so I love finding things she scarfs.

Good taste - 1st recipe where I tried out parsnips.  Husband really liked it - I thought it could use a little more zing. Drained cauliflower so as not to have the soupy texture like others.  Did not get the mashed potato texture using a masher - will use the food processor next time.

I followed the recipe on this one, with one exception.  I did drain it b/f mashing.  It would have been soup otherwise.  I liked this recipe ok, however I like cauliflower.  My family did not.  My husband set a good example and ate it in front of the kids, but if we had been alone I don't think he would have eaten it.

We have quite a few friends on low carb diets. So we tried this out and it was yummy.  I did drain out the chicken broth and added some seasonings to it (was a little too bland for us).  But unless someone told me it was cauliflower, I would not have believed them.  YUMMY recipe!!!

This was good, though I did make some changes based on other reviews.  I drained the cauliflower and reserved the liquid.  I put the cauliflower, cheeses, and butter in the food processor and added the reserved chicken broth as needed (about 1 1/2 c.).  Also, I used 2% cheese and only 2 T. butter to lighten it up a bit.

this was pretty good. the texture was a little hard to swallow but the taste was yummy. it's a great alternative to mashed potatoes. i did, however, drain ALL the broth after it got done cooking. i am happy i did because it would have been way too runny if i wouldn't have.

This is a great substitute to mashed potatoes. I suggest using regular cheddar rather than white cheddar for more taste, but overall... defintely making this again. Also found it better after it sat a day.

I followed the advice of another reviewer, and used only 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth. Also, I didn't have any parmesan cheese on hand, so I just added 1 1/4 cups of cheddar. The butter really wasn't necessary--I only added about 1/2 Tbsp. This is just delicious!

My family really liked it!  Based on the previous reviews, I used 2.5 cups broth, added 2 cloves garlic about halfway through the cooking time.  Cooked for about 30 minutes total because I was too lazy to get out the food processor. Used 1/3 cup sour cream, 2 Tbsp butter, and mixed up cheeses to make 1 cup.  Very yummy, I'll make it again.

This was very delicious and something I'll definately cook again.  I did add too much juice so it had the consistency of grits, but was still tasty.  I'll definately be more careful with the liquid next time.

This was a really good recipe.  My kids really liked it.  The only thing though is that I added some cream to it and a little more cheese.  It just seemed to be missing something.

Great recipe!  I only used 1/2 the broth and drained some of the excess.  I added sour cream to the recipe and used my hand held pureer to mash it.  Will definately use this again!

So GOOD!!! I didn't put the butter in, but it was not lacking any flavor. Really does taste like mashed potatoes.
