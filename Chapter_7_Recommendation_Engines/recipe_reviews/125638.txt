I am giving this recipie three stars because of the fact that it is so easy. I have a five year old that loves mac and cheese but the store variety is just terrible for you. I am keeping the idea of the blender but I changed the recipe a lot. Overall: Thank you for the wonderful idea of blender mac and cheese!

The flavor is good, but not very cheesy.
I doubt I'll make this again. I think I'll mix some tuna into the leftovers.

Loved it with a few tweaks!  I use a whole 1lb box of pasta and double the cheese sauce part.  Except for the flour, I felt that much flour made it too pastie.  We also prefer it w/o the worcestershire.  I have made it many times and the family loves it!

Quick and easy.  Added a minced jalapeno and some chopped cooked bacon to the macaroni mixture.

I've made this several times, but  I made a few changes in this recipe. I eliminated the worcester sauce, I don't know what kind you use, but the kind I use is Lea and Perrins, and it s sweet and does not compliment the flavor. I also used a sharper cheese, for more cheese flavor, and left out parmesan cheese as well as adding more of the mustard powder which enhances the cheddar flavor, and 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to give a little zing. I also like toasted garlic and butter crumb topping.  My family just loves it, including my extended family. I love to bring this to family reunions, its the first to go.
