This is a five star recipe IF you simmer the sausages for about 10 minutes before placing in the slow cooker. If you don't the grease is extreme!

nice flavors with very tender meat. this is the way i normally make hot sausage except for the slow cooker (why didn't i think of that before?). i did boil my sausage for about 20 minutes ahead of time to remove some of the fat. thanks jelly!

I used this recipe as an idea ONLY. I cannot imagine the grease factor with sausages in a crock pot for hours on end. I used bulk sweet Italian sausage, crumbled into smallish almost walnut sized chunks and browned in a bit of olive oil. I did not use vegies to appease the family's different preferences, I used canned sauce spruced up with a bit of Oregano and Basil. I simmered the drained cooked sausage with the sauce on top of the stove for about 30 minutes. I used 2 pounds of sausage and one jar of sauce, I added a bit more sauce when reheating the leftovers the next night. It was even better leftover. I served it on hard rolls then smothered in cheese{provolone and mozz.}I then placed them in a hot oven{450}for about 10 minutes to soften the inside, crisp up the outside and melt the cheese. I gave this recipe 3 stars because it was a great idea, just not a very good method in my opinion.

I did not expect much of this recipe but made it because it was easy and I thought the guys at work would like it... HOLY COW! This makes an absolutely delicious sausage sandwich on a hoagie with lots of shredded mozzerella. I added one clove of garlic and I only had 6 sausages, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

Perfect!  Easy and delicious.  My husband dreams about it at work when he knows it'll be waiting when he gets home.  We've had it over rice, mashed potatoes, and spaghetti, then in rolls the next night.  I use two onions, two peppers and sweet sausage.  Love it!

So easy and so delicious! Plus it's a great way to beat the summer heat on nights when it's just too hot to grill. I would definitely brown the sausage first to avoid a bunch of grease in the crock pot. I also sauteed a green and red pepper along with a vidalia onion in a bit of olive oil and a bit of garlic just until tender crisp. I had some "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" frozen in a small container so I thawed that and added it vs. using Classico Sauce. I cooked it for 6 hours on low and added the veggies the last hour so they didn't get mushy. When it was done I served it on crusty Italian rolls topped with shredded Parmesan and Romano cheeses - YUM!

This recipe is really dependent on the sausage and sauce used, so make sure you get something you like.  As other reviewers mentioned, it was really saucy...you could probably double the sausage, onion, and pepper without doubling the sauce.  I served this over rice, but I think I'll cut up the leftover sausage tomorrow and serve it over spaghetti instead as it really seemed more like a meaty pasta sauce to me.  The taste was good and I'll probably make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used homemade spaghetti sauce plus 1 cup of water, added green peppers and sliced onions. I did boil the sausages a few minutes before placing in the slow cooker to release some of the grease.  Very tasty!

Delicious! Extremely easy. The sausages practically melted in my mouth. Nice and tender. I didn't have any bell peppers and I added a couple of fresh garlic cloves, toasted our rolls prior to filling and topped with fresh grated parmesan cheese. My whole family loved them.

Do not pass this recipe up for fear of too much fat in the sauce.  I made this tonight for the first time using a jar of Newmans Own sauce, a bag of frozen blend of stir fry peppers and onions, and a package of Johnsonville italian sausages and OH MY was it GOOD!  My only complaint was that I didn't double the recipe!  We ate them on hoagies, which were gobbled up very quickly!  Three hungry boys ate these and loved it!  Will put this one into the rotation, double it, and use leftover sauce over rice the next day or noodles.  Husband is already asking me to make it again!  It's a keeper, so thanks for the recipe!

In order to rate this 5 stars I made sure to get the grease out of the sausages! Poke them full of holes and simmer them, then prick again and brown them. Towel off any remaining grease. I added a small can of petite diced tomatoes as the jar sauce is "too rich." I doubled the green pepper and the onion and added 4 crushed cloves of garlic and a teaspoon or so of sugar. I didn't have time to low cook it so I cooked it on high for 3 hours. It was great, except I would chop the onions next time. They were a little chewy. Our home care aide did the sausage prep for me and I sliced the veggies while sitting at the table. She is not with us weekends, so the slow cooker provides our weekend meals. I am 81. My husband is 92.

This was so easy my husband loved it.  I did add a small can of tomatoe paste to thicken the sauce, kept the sauce the same used 2 lbs of sausage and 2 red peppers and 2 green  still had tons of sauce left over.  Used it about week later and made spaghetti with it! I did boil the sausage for about 20-30 mins to release the grease.  Thanks for the great recipe.  Will be making often!

I make Italian sausage like this all the time and the family LOVES it.  I put the peppers and onions on the bottom of the crock pot, put frozen Italian sausage on top, then pour sauce over everything.  The sausage comes out so tender every time! And I love that I don't need to thaw out the sausage first!

Loved this recipe. First, browning the sausage in a pan before throwing them in the crock pot is a must.  I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of pasta sauce. I found that the dish comes out too sweet with pasta sauce.  I also added a bunch of fresh garlic, pepper and italian herbs.  I toasted the buns in the oven with provolone cheese and some seasoned salt.  Served the sandwiches with "hot gardinera" peppers...just like they would back home in Chicago.   Always a hit. I thought my pregnant sister was going to eat the whole thing by herself!!!

i actually used Turkey Italian sausage. It was very good. I boiled it for about 20 minutes, then put it in the crock pot on high with the spaghetti sauce cooked it for about 3 hours. I sauteed the peppers and onions, added a little bit of garlic salt for flavor and added it to the top of the sausage once in the hogie rolls. (My husband HATES the taste of both, but i love it!) they were really good!!! Thank you for the recipe!!! :)

I grew up on this dish. However, I normally brown the sausage on the stove and saute the onions before putting them into the slow cooker with a variety of peppers. I love to eat it just out of the bowl with a crusty bun dipped in the sauce.  Along with the peppers, I have also added eggplant and zucchini to this dish and it's fantastic!

Simple, quick and easy. When cooking meat in a slow cooker, I usually put the meat in by itself with a half cup of water and allow it to cook for a couple of hours, either on high or low.  Then I drain the water and grease from the meat and add the rest of the ingredients. I've done this for years. It eliminates the need to cook anything on the stove top, less steps to take, less clean-up and gets rid of most of the grease from the cooked meat.

I make a similar recipe quite often (easy for pot lucks) passed down from NY italian family. When you cook sausage a long time as in a slow cooker the sausage loses flavor and becomes dry and mealy. I have always made this in the oven in a roasting pan with foil on top. You can also snip the sausage into quarters with kitchen scissors for bite sized sausage for pot lucks. The sausage has so much flavor you don't need to start with jar sauce. It's so easy. We use crushed tomatoes way more onions, red and green peppers. Don't over cook the sausage it's done when no longer pink inside. We add a little basil parsley salt and pepper. I have never had a problem with grease but 
some sausage is better quality than others but you could pop them in the oven on a low sided pan for a while to brown first if you need to. Sadly the grease is where the flavor is but to much is yucky.

Awesome Recipe. I first had this at a picnic I recently attended. I had to have the recipe. There was one change I need to make and this refers to a comment about the grease and for better flavor and the advice of the person who gave me the recipe. Before you put the sausages in the crock, put the sausages in a skillet and brown them up, and as you are browning, punch each sausage with a fork in 3 areas and finish browning. The sausage actually has a lot more flavor, without the fat and grease. Of course drain the excess grease from pan before you put in crock. I also smash them a bit to drain even more of the grease. Let me know what you think! Another piece of advice, these are really good if you grill the rolls right before you serve it. Always make sure you have the freshest bread, it makes a difference. Enjoy!

Loved the ease of this and was really hoping to like it, but for us it was just okay. I pre-boiled my sausage for a few minutes before putting in the crock pot with the sauce and onions, since I didn't have any green peppers on hand. Served them on hoagie rolls at the end of the day, with more sauteed onions and peppers that I had picked up. The sausage was almost too tender and kind of flavorless, maybe something I did wrong??

I hate to rate this recipe so low, cause I had high hopes for it.  The sausage lost so much flavor by cooking it for so long and was crumbly.  It was bland and the peppers and onions were mushy.  I will stick to making sausage and peppers in the oven or on the grill.

Don't know why you'd bother w/the slow cooker. It can cook in the skillet in maybe 20 minutes...30 tops.

This recipe is simple and amazing! I doubled the meat and took the suggestions of others and boiled the sausage in an inch of water first. When the water evaporated, I browned the meat. I had to pierce the casing with a toothpick before I could get the grease out. I then dried and squeezed them in paper toweling to remove as much grease as possible. I added 2 sliced onions, 2 sliced green peppers, and 2 tsp. minced garlic to the sauce and cooked according to directions. When the cooking was done, we ate the sausage on hoagie rolls and then I cut the remainder in half. I froze those along with the sauce for another meal served over pasta. Delicious! Thanks for sharing. My husband is still talking about them.

What a great dish!  I boiled the sausages before their trip to the crock pot, to get rid of some of the fat, and served this on a bun that had been toasted in the oven with garlic butter.  I topped it (open faced) with shredded cheese....... my family LOVED it :)

This is super simple and perfect for a busy day.  The only changes I made were to use chicken sausage therefore I didn’t need to precook the sausage, and peppers from my garden that I had frozen so they were chopped, not sliced.  If I were to use pork sausage I would definitely precook the sausage to eliminate the grease.  Very easy and very good.

This is exactly how my husband and I make our sausage.  The only difference is that we fry the sausage in a pan until they are slightly blackened on the outside and then we add the sausage to the slow cooker.  It's hard to believe that a regular, basic jar of spaghetti sauce can taste like that just by leaving sausage sit in it all day.  We also prefer hot sausage vs. regular but if you don't like a sauce with heat, don't use hot sausage.  Use regular as the submitter of the recipe does because the sauce does have a lot of heat if hot sausage is used.  We typically make extra sausage so that we can have it with rigatoni for dinner the first night and the leftovers on hoagie rolls as sandwiches, just like the submitter of the recipe, for dinner the following night.

Flavor was okay but I find when you cook already prepared tomato sauce for a long time, it gets kinda slimy.  It is meant only to be heated up.  The texture of this sauce ruined it for me.

Awesome! Will definitely make again. My hubby said it was the best sausage sub he's ever had and the recipe is a keeper. Did follow others advice about cooking the sausage some before starting it in the slow cooker to avoid all the grease and added cheese. The meat was tender and the flavors were well infused.

I have been making this for the last 2 years and always get rave reviews when I do. I do cook the links (usually grill them) prior to adding them to the slow cooker to cut the amount of grease. I suggest using Prego original sauce, it just seems to work best for this recipe. Also I have made it with Brats, Italian sausage and Johnsonville Hot Links and sometimes all three when feeding a crowd and they are all delicious. I also make them with yellow and orange peppers as my family is not a fan of green peppers. Be sure to use lots of onion and peppers though as they cook down considerably.

I tried this recipe, the long cooking time made the sauce a little too thick and a mite slimy. I made another batch for football Sunday making my own sauce, (your recipe of course), and family were estatic. Hint: Fresh hoagie roll, slice baby swiss  or provolone cheese, side dish lettuce, olives and pepronchini, etc., etc., and you are queen for a day.

Cooking this as the recipe says leaves and inedible greasy sauce.  I really meant to do as everyone said and cook the sausage in a pan first to release its juices then throw in the slow cooker.  I ended up pulling the sausages out and rinsing them off cause they were so greasy and making heating up some spaghetti sauce on the stove to serve with this.  Sorry for the 1 star but this was a mess.

Since I wasn't in a hurry to make it, I made it the day before needed.  I refrigerated the crock insert and the next day was able to remove any of the fat.  The fat usually forms in thin sheets and is easily removed.  I can remove more grease this way than when it is hot.  The sausage was even more flavorable because it "sat" in its own juices longer.  I served it over "curly" noodles. Since we are a family of two, I froze some . Very good.

I hate to say that I love this - but that I changed the recipe.....but I cut slits into the sausage and quickly fried them in a pan with very little oil before putting them in the slow cooker. That's the only change I made to this recipe - but I feel it made it much better.

This was super easy and good as well. I did brown my sausage before placing in the slow cooker to cut down on the grease. I also add a bit more onion and pepper and some fresh garlic. Toasting the hoagie buns helps them not to get soggy as well. Super easy recipe, thanks.

Sure, this recipe is simple. That's what makes it good. I have made it several times and used turkey sausage with cheap spaghetti sauce. I suspect the turkey sausage is why I had no oil problem.  I have tried frozen and fresh bell peppers/onions. The surprise is that its all good, the slow cooker does the magic on the lovely sauce. In a word, delicious.

Very Good! Nothing is better than football and hot sausage.  I did simmer the links for 15min to remove some of the fat prior to placing them in the crock pot. Sprinkled shredded mozzarella and served with cucumber salad for a light side.  Thanks!

I used Jennie-O hot Italian Turkey sausage. I split the casings so it was only sausage, added double the onions, a bag of frozen tri color pepper strips (C&W/Safeway)  and a very good brand of low sodium prepared sauce. BTW frozen pepper strips are economical and conveniently on hand. Fatty Italian sausage is good for grilling, but turkey sausage is scant fat and works just fine.

Wonderful! One look at the photo and I knew this was going to be great. I used 7 mild Italian sausages. They were not a brand name but the kind that is  packaged by the store where purchased. I had no greasy/oily problems at all. Perhaps the grease factor can be attributed to using sausages that contain more than just meat. I was amazed at how the meat held the flavour of everything and at how incredibly soft they were. Everyone commented on this. So very good on a bun! For the sauce I had to combine ingredients I had on hand. Using tomato paste and a tomato sauce (Hunts Original) did mean that some seasoning was required to bring the flavour up to what I thought would be in the, called for, spaghetti sauce. Simple additions like: basil, Parmesan, S & P, oregano etc. These brightened the plain sauce nicely. I even added some pepperoni and mushrooms chopped up very small. As I found myself on a bit of a roll (pardon the pun), I made AR's Burger or Hot Dog Buns by Sally, found on this site. Such simplicity with delicious results. Thanks for the recipe. It's one that I will enjoy again and again. **Update -> I did have some sauce left over which I put on chicken burgers with sliced mozzarella cheese. Wow! The sauce gets even better.

Great surprise!  I used jalapeno sausage, fire roasted tomatoes and diced tomatoes (blended) and a little onion.  My husband doubted that it would be good, but couldn't stop eating them!  He put parmesan cheese on top for a little added flavor.

Made this recipe the other day. I thought I had Italian Sausage but did not so I used Brats instead...Left out the peppers because we dont like them but added artichokes, fresh bannana peppers and mushrooms...I did brown the brats first...Threw everything in teh crock pot and left it. IT WAS GREAT. The meat was sooo tender by the end of the day and the brats absorbed the flavor of everything around them...We threw it over some whole wheat pasta. It was delightful. Will make again next time with Italian Sausage!

Perfect just as written!  I can't see eating these any other way than on a hoagie roll.  We butter the rolls and throw them on the griddle then sprinkle the sausages with bit of Parmesan Cheese.

Excellent.  Best sausage and peppers we've ever had.  The sausage is so tender.  Thicker slices works best with the vegetables -- the first time (of many) that I made this, I chopped the vegetables too thin and I might as well have pureed them. With thicker strips they were still strips.

So easy, so yummy!  I only added some seasonings to the sauce, onion powder, garlic powder, basil, salt and pepper.  Great for football Sundays!

Just made this over the weekend.  I read the reviews before trying this out so I did boil the two packages of "Perri brand" sausages for about 15 minutes before adding them to the crockpot.  I covered the sausages with two bags of frozen peppers and onions and two jars of "Victoria" brand pasta sauce.  SO easy! Set on high for three hours instead of six hours on low. Family LOVED this.  The sausages were tender and tasty.  Served on toasted rolls and put provolone cheese on top.  This is a definite keeper.  Glad I doubled it because these went fast.  This would be a great pot luck dinner.  Thank you so much for the recipe :)

Don't know what I did wrong, but this turned out horribly for me. Sausage was tasteless, sauce tasted burned, and pepoers and onions just melted, and not in a good way. Sorry for those of you out there that loved this, but it's off my cookbook forever now. :(

Love, love, love this recipe. Super simple and a great hit with the family! The only thing I did different was putting the slow cooker on high for the first two hours and turning it down to low for the other four hours. Turned out great! The sausage almost fell apart. Will definitely use this one again!

Perfect recipe.  Easy to put together and delicious to eat.  I toasted the hoagie rolls with some butter and garlic first.  We also used some shredded mozzarella on top.  Great meal!

It's good, of course it's going to depend on your sauce and sausages.

I made one seemly natural change, I served it on fresh garlic bread heated in the oven to throughly warm the bread and toast the crust - how else to eat an italian sausage in spaghetti sauce?

I made this using just two hot Italian sausage links.  I scaled back the other ingredients accordingly, but used more bell peppers, a mix of green, red and yellow, along with the onion.  After reading the reviews I decided to boil the sausages to help eliminate the excessive grease others mentioned.  I should have remembered that they would instantly turn an awful shade of gray once plunged into boiling water, so I pulled them out of the water and browned them in a skillet.  Returned them to the boiling water for about 5 minutes.  After all that I didn’t get much grease from my sausages at all, so I’ll skip that whole thing next time.  This was good.  I meant to add fresh basil at the very end, but forgot.  I served this over bow tie pasta and we enjoyed it.

Very good and very easy to put together on a busy day. I followed the recipe and just put the sausage in the slow cooker raw, I didn't have a problem with my sauce getting greasy. I think it really depends on what brand of sausage you use. I used my grocery stores sausage that they make in house. Also added some garlic and Italian seasoning. Tasty. Thanks for the recipe.

I've made this recipe a lot and it's always a hit.  I use Roma hot italian sausages and have never had a problem with too much grease.  I do add a bit of salsa to the jar of spaghetti sauce though, just to give it a bit more of a kick.  Served on a fresh ciabata bun with provolone cheese is amazing!

So easy and so good!! I actually pureed about 2 cups of zucchini, the onion, and one link of sausage into the sauce (because my kids are so picky and always pick out the veggies) and everyone gobbled it up!! We served it over noodles.  Will definitely make again!

The Italian sausage came in a 12 pack so I cut up 8 links and left 4 whole.  I added 1 green pepper, 1 red pepper, 8 sliced garlic cloves, 1 large onion and some basil.  Served over spaghetti it was delicious.  I have 2 spaghetti meals and put the whole sausage with some sause away for another meal on buns.  We will be making this over and over.

I usually par-boil the links, skin them and cut into bite sized pieces.  I also use 2 peppers and 2 onions.  Very very good!

I have made this for years, since college.  I use the 5pk Johnsonville sweet Italian links, 1 jar of traditional sauce, 1 green pepper, 1 yellow, and 1 red, and a medium onion.  The extra peppers just give it a rounder flavor.  I serve them on crusty rolls, cut up and over pasta, or plain.  They're so good, I never had leftovers or complaints! :)

Well, I've got to say, I didn't expect this recipe to blow me out of the water, and was pleasantly surprised when it did! The sausages were very tender. I did double up on the onion and boil the sausages for 10 minutes before throwing them in the crockpot (to cut down on the grease), but besides those minor changes, this is excellent as is! Who would figure so simple could be so good?

Unbelievable! The simplest dish I have ever made, and incredibly, one of the tastiest! Instead of store-bought sauce, I used homemade spaghetti sauce, for our own heartier version. I can see why those that made it for the Super Bowl did, and I can imagine the response!!! One poster mentioned it was too greasy; I did spoon oil off the top before final stir and serving, but it wasn't much. Overall, I would not consider this a greasy dish. I have rated a lot of dishes on this site as five stars, but if I could rate this 7, I would!!!!

Delicious and NOT greasy at all. Instead of using a jar of sauce, I use 1 can of tomato paste. Sausage, some bell pepper strips and Italian pepper strips and onions.mmmm-delicious! I don't know where 1 reviewer thought it would be greasy form the slow cooker- not at all.

OK, so this was the easiest recipe that my family went crazy for.  I served the sausage on toasted hoagie rolls.  It was a bit greasy, so next time I might brown them before hand, and rinse off the grease before putting them in the crockpot.

Made recipe exactly as written. I will have to add another green pepper next time. It made the house smell so good all afternoon. Easy and quick dinner. I served on toasted french bread rolls with melted mozzarella. Left overs were thrown on some pasta the next day. 2 dinners in one!!

Delicious and easy!  Kids didn't even realize they were eating vegetables.    Boiled the sausage for 15 min to drain some of the fat.  When I checked the crock pot after 6 hours, there was quite a bit of grease floating at the top, but I blotted it with a paper towel and it was fine.

My husband grew up in north jersey, where everything is DELICIOUS. Esoecially sausage and italion food.  I cooked this like it said, but instead of a whole onion, i sprinkled dried onion and also added dried basil and dried oregano.  Used ragu traditional pasta sauce, added an orange pepper, and he absolutely LOVED it.  It made the house smell incredible, and i used fresh made pork sausage from whole foods.  He sai it was tender, and wonderful.  (i am a vegetarian so i didnt try)  I am cooking our sausage and meatballs like this from now on.  He ate it with a side of red pesto spaghetti and home made garlic bread.  Thanks for the recipe!!

OMG...so easy and soooooo delicious!  I ended up using Johnsville bratwurst as I could not find the italian sausages.  DH was thrilled with this recipe.  Thank you for sharing such a fuss free meal.
Just wanted to add a little more to this review.  We used the same sausages (cut up) and the sauce over spaghetti a couple of nights later and we discovered a great new dish.  Sooo full of flavor.  I almost never want to go back to ground beef in the spaghetti again.  Thanks for a new way to make spaghetti totally delicious.

very quick, very easy, very tasty. Only thing I do different is make my own sauce with crushed tomatoes and whatever herbs I feel like putting in (usually 2-3 cloves fresh minced garlic, fennel seed, oregano, basil, and parsley).

My husband's Italian. I made this and we both loved it. I usually pass when he fries sausage for dinner. This was EASY, and EXCELLENT. I used Classico Tomato & Basil and Jewel Foods house Brand Sausage. The only thing I did was to add 1/2 jar of Trader Joe's "red pepper and artichoke tappenade"  We served it over pasta. I'm looking for an excuse to have company so I can serve this. Some nice crispy garlic bread would've make this absolutely perfect!!!

This recipes really depends on the sausage and sauce you use - I used some wine and feta flavored bratwurst and a nice garlic cheese tomato sauce and it turned out great! I cut mine up and served them on top of noodles.

After being a memeber of Allrecipes for the better part of 7 years and knowing how I cook, I NEVER follow a recipe to a "T" until this one. This can't be improved. Being a loyal at the local meat market, I always get my sausages there and have had them many ways. This is divine. Double up on the recipe, and you have hoagies one night, pasta the next. They get even better the next day. Thanks so much for such a tasty supper.

A very easy and simple recipe.  I fished the sausages out of the sauce about 30 mins. before serving, sliced the sausages and returned to the sauce.  I served the dish over pasta.  I also added sauteed mushrooms to the mix.  With a glass of red wine and some Italian Bread, we had a very nice meal!

I can't believe how tender these sausages were.  Made the recipe just as written.  There was NOT a lot of grease.  My husband loved them.  Will make this again and pass it on to others.

I really liked this but it was too soupy.  I think I would cook longer than 6 hours to evaporate some of the liquid next time.  Will try again.  (Tried chicken sausage - the family didn't know the difference)  Should I cut up the links when serving?

Nice recipe and so simple to prepare. I only had five sausages, mild flavor. Added a teaspoon of sugar, a little bit of minced fresh garlic, some dried basil and served on hoagie rolls. Perfect for a busy day when you still want to cook but don't have the time.

I have made this recipe many times - I never have problems with it being greasy as I use top quality sausages- I sometimes also substitute diced tomatoes, onions, mushrooms and garlic for the spaghetti sauce. It depends on what I have handy.  Because of the quality of the sausages I combine all the ingredients then place my frozen sausages on top and let it cook. Approximately an hour before serving I break apart the sausages into small pieces.

To my surprise, this was quite good for minimal ingredients and effort. I was looking for something easy to be ready for a packed lunch in the morning without sitting over a stove. To top, I had everything in the house. I purchased some home-made sausage at the Farmer's Market and had gotten home to realize I was accidentally given some type of non-flavored variety. I didn't know what to do with it. Although, I am typically not a fan of jarred pasta it works here. I used a basil flavor from Classico. I added at least a cup extra of water to thin it out some. I also, for the first time tested crock-pot liners. Loved using them, no clean-up! My sausage package had 4 in it. I de-cased the sausage and cut it into about 1-1 1/2" slices. At the time, I thought to stretch the meal with some pasta or rice. I then realized I only had about 1/2 of a large green pepper left so I used that much and it worked fine. I added the sliced onion and then my only addition was a couple pinches of garlic powder. I cooked it on high, instead of low, about 4-5 hours. ty

So easy, based on other reviews I boiled the sausage for about 10 minutes prior to adding to the crock pot. I added basil, black pepper, crushed red pepper, and garlic to the sauce.

This was pretty tasty .  I used sweet sausage links , made with pork and chicken .  Did not pre-cook , and had no problem with a lot of grease .  Doubled the peppers and onions , kept the sauce the same . Served on toasted rye buns , and sprinkled some mozz. over all .  Put some of the sauce on left over mac and cheese . Easy to do at 4:30 a.m. , (on low ) and was done at 4:30 p.m. , when I got home .  Will make again . Thank you for sharing .

Great recipe! This was so easy to prepare and tasted very good. I used this on a bun and also with pasta. I did boil the sausage a little to remove some grease but there was not that much, will just add to slow cooker next time. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good basic recipe. Always pre-cook the sausages (prick the sausages with fork, then simmer in water on stove for about 10-15 mintues) so there won't be as much grease. Using different flavors of spaghetti sauce will also change the final outcome of the dish. I also add a little red pepper flakes for some heat, depending on who I'm feeding at that time. Delicious!!

I thought this recipe was very good.  I will admit that I did follow the recipe as directed and found that the sauce thinned out because of the grease, but the flavor was awesome.  It may be a good idea to boil before placing in crockpot.

In the treadition of Allrecipes I'll say that I liked the recipe but added to it for my own taste preferences. Needs 1 bell pepper chopped or sliced, 1 brown or yellow onion chopped or sliced, 1 or 2 cloves of garlic minced, a sprinkle of crushed red pepper. Made my own sauce, If you have a lot of sauce. One of my kids liked it on a hoagie smothered in sauce like open face then eats it with a fork and knife but not until lots of provolone melted on top nd then sprinkle some pamasean cheese.

So easy and delicious.  It is made even easier using a chicken sausage (our local grocer makes them fresh with parsley, so they have nice flavor but no fat!) This is in my regular rotation.

This was ok.  I used chicken italian sausage.  Boiled them like some recommended to reduce the fat.  Maybe I should have used real italian sausage...  Didn't care for the consistency and it made the roll really soggy.

I boiled the sausages on a skillet for 15 minutes, then sliced them. I used 2 jars of spaghetti sauce, 1 red and 1 green pepper, and 2 onions, sliced. Also, added 6 cloves of garlic and some dried oregano and basil. It's a really great recipe for a Sunday to serve over mashed potatoes, with some parmeson sprinkled on top. Wonderful the next day to eat any way you want. I recommend this recipe!

Loved it!! I did boil the sausage for about 20 minutes before to get some of the fat off. I also added more bell pepper than it called for and added fresh sliced mushrooms and served over spaghetti squash! It turned out great! Thanks!

This is very good if you cut the sausage into bite size pieces and boil them first to get some of the fat off.  We've served at several get togethers at our office.

I cheated. First I poked and browned the sausage, which left me just enough oil to saute 3 small onions and 4 minced garlic. I sliced the sausage and added the onions/garlic, some red and yellow peppers and maybe 1/4 to a 1/3 cup of red wine.   The sauce I used was Bertolli's which to my taste is a bit too much but it was the remaining jar left in the pantry. I had just asked my wife not to buy anymore sauce so we can make our own. If I had done that, I could control the taste more. I am a beginner cook, but an expert eater.  It all depends upon the sauce (well, and the sausage). We used sweet Italian sausage but I think the Hot would be great too. Sounds weird, but we are long on cornbread and I used that as a base and it worked just fine.

This was great! I used 10 hot sausage links, 3 green peppers, 2 onions and 2 jars or plain old spaghetti sauce. Cooked on high for 4 hours, and served over brown rice. It was a hit, and I will make it again.  I did not find it to be overly greasy as some had stated. There was a tiny amount of grease, but that's where all the flavor is!

Fabulous and oh so easy to make.  I had some home made pasta sauce in the freezer so I used that, I only used 1/4 cup of onion and I added 1 green bell pepper but also added about 1/4 cup of red bell pepper.  I also added about 1/4 cup of red wine and 1/4 cup of beef broth.  And finally I added red pepper flakes.   My boyfriend and I ate with pasta.  I can't wait to make this again. The sausages were so very tender.

Here is a little more figure-friendly idea.  I use a box of 8 large TURKEY Italian sausage links.  They are only 110 calories each and 4g of fat.  Then I use a whole bag of frozen peppers & onions.  They are sold as "stir fry" vegetables.  Just add a jar of your favorite sauce and turn on the crock pot on Low for the next 6-8 hours. The sausages come out so good.  I can throw this together in a few minutes before I leave for work.  My family loves it.

I've been doing this for years.  I use fennel sausages or sweet italian, cut them into bite size chunks, cut the onion and peppers in large pieces and cook in tomato sauce on low for 6-7 hours.  I serve these instead of meatballs as an appetizer at parties, I never had anyone complain about grease and.....I never have any leftovers either.  If I want to use this for spagetti sauce, I season the tomato sauce as I would my spagetti sauce and serve over fettucini noodles w/grated parmesan cheese, yum

I have made this a bunch of times. First I boil the sausage for 20 minutes to remove most of the grease.  Then follow the recipe as written.  Great every time!

If you use chicken sausage, you lose the fat that would make this recipe oily.  This is delicious. I've been making my sauce this way for ages. Great way to cook it!

This is one of our standbys.  One of hubby's favorites.  I cut the sausages in bite size pieces, then brown in a skillet, add water and cover for about 10 minutes and drain, then blot on paper towels before putting in slow cooker.  This takes care of the grease problem.  Sausages come out very tender and flavorful.  We serve it on linguine.  Five stars!

I have been making italian sausage in the crockpot for years.  The only thing I do differently is I grill the sausage first to get rid of some of the grease and brown the sausage.  Then put in the crockpot with the peppers and onions.  4-6 hours later...delicious!

This was a great way to make Italian sausage.  like previous reviewers, I boiled the sausages for about 10 minutes prior to putting them in the crockpot to avoid having a lot of grease.  Great served on buns.

This is totally delicious!! Please only boil the sausage 10 min. at the most or you are boiling away the flavor. With me some animal fat is okay, but I use no sugar added sauce and eat them on very low carb tortillas. Simple and totally delicious is the only way I can describe this dish!!

This morning I was trying to figure out what to make for Sunday dinner so I typed in recipes. all recipes came up I clicked on it and joined. the first page that opened up was this one I thought sauage in a crock pot what the heck! I thought that doesn't even sound good. Then I read reviews and saw pictures I thought well maybe I will try I got Turkey sauage in freezer, sauce, other ingredients I'll try. (I get up at 3:30 am) and can have made by the time I return from church, if it doesn't work out I will make something different. to my surprise it hasn't even been six hours my family woke up and wanted to know what smelled so good! Oh My thank you for the ideal time saving great smelling all recipes suggestion. :-) using Turkey sauage didn't have all the grease they talked about either, I am not a beef or pork eater. Thanks so much again. I am sure I will have just as much fun eating as I did making it.

I have made this twice. Once with turkey italian sausage and once with turkey bratwurst. The turkey bratwurst were very, very good. They seemed to soak in the sauce. My 3 boys don't care for onions or cooked peppers, but they didn't mind them in this recipe. Very easy recipe for busy moms or dads.

This was delicious!  The aroma filled the house, everyone could not wait to dig in.  I made extra, for a party, and with the leftovers, I cooked some penne, put it in a casserole dish and added all of the remaining sausage, sauce, onions, peppers.  Added mozzarella cheese and baked for a bit. Awesome!

I completely agree with Bob in Houston regarding the rating system. Melis did not even try this recipe before submitting a review. She tore it apart and revised it. That is in no way a rating. The recipe that JELLYKO submitted is super simple and delicious!

I did the original and then made several variations primarily using different sausages and adding different herbs and spices to dress it up.  Slow cookers take at least 90 min. to reach full temp which is a gentle even heat so stop worrying so much about the grease factor. Use a skinned sausage to help with that as well. I tried polish sausage and added some rosemary (1/2 tsp dried then crushed). Also used smoked sausage and added 1/2 tsp each dried thyme and marjoram for a more southern flavor. Also used smoked sausage and 1/2 tsp ground cumin and 1/4 tsp ground corriander for a more Tex Mex flavor. 1 oz of Mexican Chirrozo added to the sauce really kicks up the heat factor. A whole host of cheeses used as a condiment and a variety of rolls can make this simple basic recipe a real launch pad for experimentation.  As a cook with more than 50 years experience cooking for myself and others (up to 300 folks at a time) I gave this 5 stars for being a good recipe that gave me an adaptable base for numerous variations. Thank you Jellyko for a good easily adaptable place to start or simply to enjoy as is.

This is how I have been cooking my sausages for a long time.  A good friend of mine gave me this recipe.  The easiest and best way to make your sausage tender and delicious!  If you use hot sausage the hot flavor permeates the sauce.  MMMM good.

I have been making my sausage this way for years in the  crockpot and have to say it is the best way to go.  When time to eat it is all in one, and everyone loves it this way I never have any left over, the meat is so tender.

These were delicious, but I prepared them a little differently. I sauteed onions and peppers in a pan with a little olive oil until tender. I then added the sauce and sausaged and simmered until heated through. After that, I placed sausage, sauce, peppers and onions in hoagie rolls, sprinkled with shredded mozzarella cheese and broiled in the oven for a few minutes. Turned out great. My only sugggestion would be to use brat buns instead as the hoagie rolls were a little big.

Really tasty & so tender.  I used homemade sauce and served on hoagy rolls.  I put the sausage into the slow cooker frozen & cooked on low for 8 hours.  I think I cut the onions & peppers too small, they really shrunk from all the cooking.  Next time I will leave larger chunks.

Good and easy!  I used chicken Italian sausages. I put the sausages in frozen and left ALL day - came out great!! Wonder where some of all that sodium comes from?  Start reading the bottles and cans of tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste....you will be surprised!!!!!  You can find low sodium options - but you have to read a lot of labels!!!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This is the best and easiest way to make your italian sausage.  Made it for 4th of July celebration and everyone loved it.  The grease sits on top so a few times I skimmed it off. I will make this my standard recipe for cooking sausage.

This was ok. I think it would have been better with sweet Italian sausage instead of plain..

The sauce was AWESOME. The way that the sausage added to the flavor of the spaghetti sauce was great. I loved the sausage and how it just fell apart in your mouth. My wife didn't care for the sausage but that was a result of the sausage I purchased. I served on toasted hoagie rolls and the leftovers were just as good.

Family really liked this.  Used a 40 oz jar of Ragu spaghetti sauce and doubled the meat (hot sausage), also sprinkled garlic powder to taste because we love it so.  Very good recipe.

We thought this was quite good, although not particularly original.  I added a can of diced tomatoes with herbs and used only 5 sausages.  I also pierced and boiled the sausages for a few minutes before putting them in the crock pot, in order to lower the fat content.

This made really good sausage pepper and onion sandwiches. Use good sauce! The sausage came out so tender and juicy, much better than the sandwiches at the Italian festival even!

This really is one of the simplest, delicious recipes that I've found.  I love it.  The sausage is melt-in-your-mouth tasty.  I've served it over rice, couscous and orzo with great success.  The sausage and sauce combo also makes a very tasty sub or open-face sandwich.  It's worth taking the extra time to boil the sausages for a few minutes to get rid of some of the grease.

Hubby and I both enjoyed this.  I'm not fond of italian sausage usually, but it was good and very tender in this dish.  As someone else suggested, I boiled the meat for about 20mins last night to get rid of some grease.

Delicious, made on stove instead of crockpot. I did boil sausages first to cut down on fat as suggested by another reviewer.

Yummy!! I do not use pre~made sauce. I make my own "gravy" all the time. This is what most Italians refer to it as!! Though, for this recipe I tried it with "Nanny's spaghetti sauce" (a recipe on this website). I made the sauce separate & poured it on the sausage. I did not make it with rice, just with bread on the side. I am sure that you will enjoy this just like I do!!

This was very good!   I added a little extra onion, but maybe thought that it could have used less sauce (since I was serving it on hoagie rolls with topped with Mozzerella cheese)It ended up kinda watery in my crock pot.  I fed my husband, my kids, and my neighbors, and they all liked it.  Simple enough, that is for sure!

Very yummy!  I am not a huge fan of Sausage, but I really liked it (enough to go for seconds).  We had it over rice and I like it that way.  The sausage fell apart and we didn't even need knives.  I added quartered fresh mushrooms.  My sauce came out rather watery since I did add water like the other ratings mentioned.  Next time I wont do that.

This recipe was great!  I was going for more of a sausage and peppers recipe so I added an extra pepper, and I used red peppers, not green.  I did boil the sausage beforehand and everything was excellent.  I'm adding this one to the recipe book.

5 Stars from me!  I did boil my sausage as others suggested for 20 min, sliced it up in big chunks (I used mild Italian in a package of 6, so I didn't use the 8)... a bottle of Prego Ricotta and Parmesean spaghetti sauce, a sweet onion and bell papper.  Threw it all in the crock this a.m. and put it on a hogie roll with melted mozzerella cheese. YUMMY!!!  I ate two for dinner!!  This is a definite keeper!!

This was slow cooker night #3 for us...DH and I been working nights and having a meal cook itself while we sleep is wonderful. This recipe was yummy, quick and flexible! We ate it with sour dough bread, but it would be lovely with pasta, potato or even cooked greens. I made a few slight alterations- I used sweet italian sausage and added a cup of pepperoni slices, extra oregano and chopped garlic. To offset the spiciness from the pepperoni, I added a bit of sugar. I garnished each plate with a dollop of sour cream. The flavor was so savory. I was especially impressed by the smooth texture of the sausage- not grainy or chewy like typical fried sausage.  My finicky son ate two bowls! We will be having this again for sure. I'm a fan of sweet & spicy combinations, so I'm going to try this recipe with apple sausages...I can't imagine it would be anything short of fantastic!

This recipes seems to easy to be good, but looks can be deceiving.  It is the best hot sausage recipe.  I have used turkey sausage as well to cut down on fat. After cooking the sausage is extremely tender.  This is one of my favorites, easy and delicious

I used 12 sausages and added extra sauce. Everyone ate up the sausages and I had all this sauce left over. I skimmed off the fat from the chilled sauce, added some vodka and served it hot over fettucini. Yummy.

I made this last week, and the sausage turned out very well, it was so done and moist it was falling apart.  The sauce, however, was clumping a bit and burning a little.  I don't know if my crock pot is extra hot or what.  I would also recommend not cutting the peppers too thin, mine turned out very tiny and mushy (and a bit slimy)by dinnertime.  Overall, though, good for a quick and easy meal.

This recipe has been in my family for several generations using 8 oz cans of Del Monte Tomato Sauce in place of prepared sauce.  Before placing the sausages in the crockpot, pierce them with a fork and boil in water for about 10 minutes to rid them of the excess fats. Trying it with prepared sauce was a new experience for me...it turned out very well!

Wasn't my favorite but there was nothing wrong with the results.  The sausages were so moist and had a different look than when I cook them in any other way.

I followed the recipe as written. It was tasty but I thought the sauce was a little thin. I did simmer the sausages for 10 minutes prior to cooking which definitely did cut down on the grease in the slow cooker. I will make this again as I found it easy and convenient and it tasted good. I think I will use some of the leftovers for pasta tomorrow night.

EASY VERY GOOD  this is enjoyable on a bun for a change.
I made extra and it made another good meal over rice. Add peas
or whatever at that point if you want. I would always treat
sausage before putting in Slow Cooker to remove grease. I 
roasted in oven. Very nice. Make again.

I browned the sausage first & then cooked in the crockpot.  We had them on wheat rolls with smoked mozzarella cheese.  Quick & easy dinner.

Wife loves it! So that is good enough for me! Only change I made was to use a mushroom based sauce and cut the sausages into 4 pieces like meatballs kind of.  Awesome Game Day food!

Browned sausages in a pan first for around 10 minutes; used 1 green and 1 red pepper, and 1 or 2 onions.  Saved the extra for pasta sauce

Made again and boiled for 10 minutes before adding to crockpot, excellent and not greasy

This was great! I opted for a healthier and less greasy version, by making it with mozzarella and roasted garlic chicken sausage from Sam's Club. I added diced onions, green peppers, and celery, that I had on hand, and the spaghetti sauce, and cooked it on high for about 2-3 hours. I served it in a split top bun. Yummy and super easy! I will be making this again.

I used turkey Italian sausage and browned them a bit prior to putting in crock pot. I also kept out onions and added mushrooms, yellow,red and orange peppers. Gave the family the option to serve on roll or over angel hair pasta....very easy!!!

Made as written for sandwiches and my fam did not like this. Suggestion from them was to cut up the sausage and put it over rice. Well wouldn't they choose that option.  LOL. Maybe I'll make it that way next time.

This is a great recipe with a few modifications. I browned the sausage links to release some of the grease & fat. I used homemade sauce and cooked on low for 6hrs. The onions &  peppers were mushy so next time I will sauté them separately and add right before serving. Served on toasted sub rolls with melted provolone cheese. Very yummy!

It was great and very easy! You definitely want to fry or boil sausages for 10-15 mins before adding them to the slow cooker. Like other reviewers mentioned, the meat was surprisingly tender!

Great tasting recipe for something so simple.  I used a local hot Italian sausage and did not have any problem with there being any extra fat on the surface of the sauce.I did pierce the sausage before putting everything in the cooker.  Served on hard rolls.  Will make again.

Added about 1/2 cup of Sherry to thin out the sauce a little and served over pasta.

I used Giant Eagle Italian sausage and homemade sauce. I browned the sausage first and then put everything in the crock pot. Cooked on low for 6 hours.Delicious! NO grease whatsoever. My husband is raving about it. It's 0 degrees here in Ohio and this was a perfect meal to come home to after work! A keeper!

I have previously made this before but I did boil my sausages before putting them in like other reviewers said.It came out very good! However,today I used Cajun Sausage and I did not boil it. It did give off a little excess grease which I just spooned off the top. Was not that much. Instead of rolls we used some Parmesan pasta and used the sauce and sausages over the pasta.Topped that with a mixture of "Italian cheeses" It was very delicious!!! Other than that followed the recipe exactly and added my own seasonings because my family likes spicy food! Thanks for a delicious super easy recipe!

Easy, fast and the whole family loves it.  This is one of those great go to recipes for busy days.  The kids are actually eating vegetables and don't know it.  I simmer the sausages to remove some of the extra grease.

This was really good and super easy. I used frozen turkey sausage hot and mild. Two bell peppers and one onion and LOTS of garlic. A couple of jars of sauce and some Italian spices. Set the slow cooker on low and dinner was done when I came home from work. The house smelled heavenly and they were AWESOME on toasted sub buns. Will make this again for sure. Thanks for the recipe :)

This was more 3 1/2 stars. It was all eaten, but I felt it needed more  flavor- and even using 2 onions and the bell pepper- I felt like I lost my peppers and onions in there somewhere. There weren't leftovers, at least, so it's not terrible. It can easily be tweaked into a very good meal though.

Delicious. I was a little skeptical these few ingredients with no extra seasoning would make such a flavorful meal but the sauce and sausage must have made it. I did use chicken sausage so I had no issues with grease. I added three peppers which was a good amount over noodles, but if I were making this for sandwhiches I think the written amount would make just enough for topping. I know I'll be making this again, thanks so much for sharing!

This was delicious! I, too, boiled and browned sausage before slow cooking. For fear of too much sodium in the jarred spaghetti sauce, I used 6oz tomato paste, 8oz tomato sauce, one can (15 oz?) crushed tomatoes, one can italian style diced tomatoes, black pepper, red pepper flakes (about 1/4 tsp), 3 cloves minced garlic, and about 1/4 c chopped fresh basil. The slow cooker really created an intense sauce flavor! yummy! oh, and I only cooked 3.5-4 hours on low and sausage was tender. Followed the recommendation of more veggies, too!

I can't think of a reason to rate this less than a 5. I didn't boil my sausage, but I used Johnsonville, so maybe its less greasy. 

This is a great one dish meal that is better for leftovers. The sausage was tender and served over brown rice, fairly healthy. I added one extra pepper (red), but made no other changes. Will make again.

Good overall, the brand of sausage is key as a cheaper brand can make this dish taste overly salty.  Recommendation would be to check ingredients for sodium content.

We loved the sandwiches we got from this recipe.  All I did was put frozen Al Fresco's Chicken Sausages in the slowcooker and pour a jar of Trader Joe's Roasted Red Pepper Marinara over the top and let it cook on low for about seven hours.  I put a little mayo on some fresh store-bought rolls and grilled them nicely, added some pepper jack cheese, and some red onion.  This made a very delicious sandwich which was perfect for a busy day!  Thanks for the idea of this!

I thought this was very good and a huge hit with family and guests. The house smelled awesome and it was definitely a feel good comfort food. I browned the sausage links before adding and sped up the cooking time by turning the crock on high for 3 hours and low for an hour. Served over rice. Definitely a winner!

Very convenient, very good.  I did nothing extra to the recipe.  I did simmer for 10 minutes to get some of the grease out of the meat, which I think made a difference.  I will make this again when I want something very good and very easy.

Yum! This is one of my most requested slow cooked recipes! I've been making a similar version of this for years. My recipe is pretty much the same as JELLYKO's, but I do a couple of things differently. I add 1/2 T (or to taste) of grated Parm cheese AND half of a 6 oz. can of tomato paste to my sauce. I usually use Ragu sweet tomato basil sauce (personal preference), but any sauce will do. The biggest difference between my recipe and JELLYKO's is that I brown my sausages REALLY well in a tiny amount of water FIRST (usually as per the directions printed on the packaging my sausage came in) until almost done. You can also boil your sausages - it's really a matter of preference. Either method will remove a considerable amount of fat (and keep your sauce from becoming greasy as many reviewrs have warned). I personally like to brown my sausages because they present nicely this way, but do what works best for you. A prepared deli salad and chips are perfect (and EASY!) sides. Thanks SO much for sharing one of my favorites on here, JELLYKO! :-)

I made a different.  I used crushed tomatoes, two tomato pastes and some water.  I added garlic, different color peppers, and I used kangaroo sausage.  It turned out great.  The aroma just called to you, and the taste was great.  The sausage came out moist and tender.

I made this last night and it was a huge hit. I did make some changes. I went with 2 jars of Emeril's garlic spag sauce and added a red pepper. Also, I browned the sausage in a little olive oil before putting in crock pot. I also sauteed the peppers and onion first but i didnt put them in the crock pot till there was about 45 mins left and i chopped them up big. I also added some finely shredded mozzarella cheese upon serving. It was great

I've been making this simple recipe for years, but the grease in this method would be awful. We always cook the links to near done on the grill first. You could pan fry or bake them also. Just get that heavy grease out of them! After hours in the crock, they will still be tender as can be.

After cooking for 4 hrs. the sausage lost a lot of texture, was almost mushy. I will cook the sausages on the grill or frying pan first, and add them to the sauce for only a few minute before serving. At least and thanks to the tip about simmering first it was not greasy.

Awesome recipe.  I browned the sausage first and used pizza sauce in place of the spaghetti sauce.  Tons of peppers and onions and mozz cheese on top.  Toasted the buns.  Delish!

Due to time constrants, I threw the sausages into the crockpot frozen.  They were very yummy and tender but the sauce was very thin.  so I was not able to use the sauce on the buns.  This problem is no reflecting of the recipe so I still gave it 5 stars.  In the future, I would thaw and brown to drain some of the liquid before cooking.

this is a good base idea. we found the sausage to be way to mushy. i added the onions and peppers in the last hour and they still got too mushy. i think i will keep the recipe. however, next time i will either grill the sausage or brown it on the stove for the extra flavor and for the crispiness. and saute the onions and peppers then add everything to the sauce on the stove.

DELICIOUS over pasta if you just cut the links up first and brown them before throwing into the crock pot.  Such a good and EASY alternative to meatballs. Perhaps on low they should cook for 6-8 hours and on high from 4-6

Great recipe - I used turkey italian sausage and removed the casing (I find the casing to be too tough to eat in a sandwich).  This was delicious and there was plenty of sauce for spaghetti sauce the next night!

Delicious! I didn't have much of a problem with the grease factor, I just let it cool a bit and laid a paper towel over it to absorb it. I wouldn't boil the sausage before hand like other members have. That would take a lot of flavor away. This recipe is perfect as is!

It seems odd there are people like melis who didn't even cook this and rate it low. The method is fine and this turned out great. I have slow cooked sausage many times before, even without browning and there is NO grease factor.

this was a great recipe, i did brown the sausages first then pat them with paper towel so there was no excess fat. i also added mushrooms and garlic and we had them in hot dog rolls, they are now a favourite in our house! thanks

Extremely easy and sausages were VERY tender.  I only had 6 sausages to use, and I found there was WAY too much sauce and it really felt wasteful.  I did add a couple cloves of fresh garlic to the crock pot.  I did boil my sausages for about 20 minutes before adding to the crock pot.  I served on toasted french rolls with mozzarella cheese for Italian Sausage Sandwiches.  I just didn't find that the flavor was all too great.  Very bland.  Next night I served left over sausage and peppers along side Lasagna Alfredo Roll-Ups (AR) and I enjoyed the sausage and peppers MUCH better!

These were good...but salty.  We liked it even better the next day with the sausages cut up and the sauce served over noodles.  GREAT!

Well this invited me through my front door after a long day at work....the smells was like walking into an Italian resturant. The aroma was intoxicating. I doubled this recipe because I had huge package of Walmart brand Pecan smoked sausage links and when I put all of it in the slow cooker, I thought man that's not enought sauce, so I added a 3rd can....I should have left well alone, because I had way to much sauce this evening....there was a lot. But that's okay...because I have enough left over for a 2nd nights meal and going to serve it again this time over rice or pasta. the meat was so tender and flavorful and the peppers and onions still amazingly had their bite. I so will make this again. Yum-a-ruin-eee!!!! This was awesome!!!!

I think in order to rate a recipe you should actually FOLLOW the recipe. :) I did...and it turned out fine. I didn't chop, slice or crumble the sausage (b/c it didn't say to!). I sliced the sausage after it was cooked and served over spaghetti. It's not fancy...it's a quick thing to throw in before work and come home to a dinner everyone loves. If you use Italian sausage it shouldn't be greasy. Mine wasn't at all and the whole family loved it. It's a "keeper" in my house.

These sausages were amazing! I steamed them for 10 min first, put them in a saute pan and cover sausages 1/2 way with water, cover and boil/steam for 10 min.  then put in slow cooker.  This cuts down on grease. They were so tender you could break them with a fork! Will always cook them this way.  I diced peppers/onions and doubled sauce and served over pasta! Yum!

YUMMY! I'm not a big fan of italian sausage, but my family loves it so we make it a lot.  I tried this recipe, and it was the best I've ever tried.  We made it into sandwiches, but it would also be good over rice, too.

Incredibly easy and delicious!  I made it  with sweet sausage, because it was for a group.  For us, I'll make it with hot sausage - yum!  I also doubled the amount of sausage, so I upped the cooking time to 8hrs.  It was perfect!!

YUMMY AND EASY.  This is exactly what I need something delicious and easy since I am not a cook.  I tweaked the recipe using red bell peppers instead of green, added 2 cloves of garlic, tablespoon of red wine, salt to taste.  I served it over pasta and it was great!  It does create a lot of grease, I skimmed it off the top but will try the other reviewers recommendations to simmer the sausages first.

How easy can this get?  I used a bag of frozen Red, yellow, green peppers with onions in my freezer made by Kroger.   Thank you for a great recipe!!!  Loving these crockpot meals for busy winter evenings.  Everyones looking for a nice warm meal.  EDIT...after tasting it myself (my kids and husband tried it first), I find that the sausage was very greasy.  Unless you use a low fat sausage, its not a heaalthy meal.  Or, you can boil the sausages (to get rid of the grease/fat) and then pan fry them for browning...then putting into the crockpot.  This way, its not such an easy recipe anymore.  It would be just as easy to add peppers/onions in the frypan.

This was surprisingly good considering how simple it was to make. I left out the green peppers because I didn't have any on hand. I will make this again.

Okay I made this dish first as a hoagie style sandwich (not bad but a bit messy) and then next day over noodles. That is the best way to serve in my opinion.  My family really enjoyed it and I used Johnsonville Italian mini sausages. Some people have mentioned large grease factor but I had no grease or oil floatingin my sauce whatsoever.  The sausages came out tender and the sauce is so much more flavorful on the second day.  I used Jar sauce  the chunky garden style and this is a great way to get your kids to eat more veggies. They may pick out the bell pepper chunks but what kid doesnt. I will use this recipe again.

Love crockpot cooking and the less ingredients the better.  So this dish fit right in.  We loved it!! I had to use two rings of polish sausages, no Italian sausages sold here.  Mixed in large jar of Ragu Robusto ( chopped tomatoes, olive oil, and garlic flavor) with the bell pepper and onion.  Served with brown rice and mixed vegetables.  Family thought it was a great meal!  Thanks for sharing the recipe. One change I think I will try next time is to cook the sausage ahead and drain to cut down on the amount of grease consumed.

Great as is!  I only altered the ingredients because I didn't have any spaghetti sauce.  I added an extra pepper, half an onion, 4 cloves of garlic and a beer.  Took out half the sauce and took the boat motor mixer to it to thicken then mixed with the remaining sauce.  This made it more of a "Ball Park" version.

Delicious and easy!  The only thing I would change is to decrease the cooking time as we found that cooking on LOW for 6 hours made the sausages mushy and fall apart.  Next time I'm going to try it with spicy/hot sausages.  Definitely a keeper. :)

I have been making this for years. It works very well with the spicy Italian sausages as well. I also always saute the sausage on top of the stove first.A favorite in our house.

I gave this 5 stars for the idea. I make a very similar recipe with 3 packages pork Italian meatballs, a can of tomato juice, Parmesan cheese and some blended Italian spices (all to taste). I serve this on hoagie buns and top with mozzarella cheese. This is awesome and tastes just like our famous Italian take out place. Even better because you can make them the way you want them. Slurp!

Have made Italian sausages like this for years.  The recipe is pretty much like I have done.  I usually prepared the onion and green peppers alone, but will try this.  This meal was planned for dinner tomorrow night for guests already since it is such a "no fuss" meal. Thanks for sharing your version.

Made this meal for my family of four. It was delicious & my family loved it. I had enough for leftovers the next day. Instead of reheating & making more sandwiches I added a bag of frozen tortellini, sliced the remaining sausages and added about a cup of water to thin out the tomato sauce. Cooked it on high for about an hour in the slow cooker. Made a delicious soup. Now I have a recipe for two meals instead of one.

Awsome! I used lean Italian sausages and a low-sodium sauce to cut back on the fat and salt content, and it was delicious!  I also boiled the sausages for a couple of minutes to get rid of some of the grease- served them over rice and the family loved it!

Oh ya, this is really that good.  We first had it over noodles, then on buns later in the week with some motz. cheese melted on top.  If you don't like too much spice - use the mild sauce and mild sausage... it still has plenty of flavor.

Not good.  We used fresh medium-hot italian sausages from our local market and Ragu chunky veggie sauce.  I do not see us eating the leftovers.

This is pretty good for a simple slow cooker recipe. I think it does indeed depend on what sausage and sauce you use. I used turkey italian sausages and they were pretty good. I didn't brown them- I figured it wouldn't have much grease. I also added about 3/4 cup of water to the sauce and it was great. I put them on wheat buns and it was a more health conscious version of an Italian sandwich. My husband loved them, and I was able to stretch out the leftovers even more and used the rest of the sauce on top of pasta.

Of course I loved the sauce as it was our favorite and the sliced pepper and onions added just the right touch. However I didn't care for the sausage. It could of been the kind I chose. Next time I'll use a bratwurst or something similar. I'll will try it one more time. Wife wouldn't try it and because of my sausage choice I can only rate it a 3 star. (For now)

I made this recipe tonight and it was definitely one of my husbands favorites. I used turkey sausage, which cuts out alot of the grease. We eat turkey meat alot so we can't even tell the difference. I do have to say the only thing I did different was add more sauce. I felt like 1 can wasn't enough, but we really enjoy sauce.

I was really shocked in how good this was. I was worried that it was gonna be greasy or turn into a pile of mush..but I figured, What the heck ill give it a try. I used mild sausage and hunts mushroom sauce.(my fav sauce bec its not sweet) I did boil the sausage for like 5 mins. Than threw in the rest of the ingrients along with garlic powder, oregano, hot sauce and some chopped up green olives. I had this with spagetti with parmesan cheese on top. The sausage turned out really tender and it does melt in your mouth!!! Very Easy and Very Good. This is the only way Ill ever make sausage and peppers for now on:) Try this one People!!

We make this often at our house.  We use turkey sausage.  We manipulated it in many ways, using homemade sauce instaed of a jar.  Omiting the pepper or onion if there are none in the pantry.  The best thing(s) about this recipe is that my kids will always eat it and my husband can throw it together without calling me at work for advice/additional instruction.

The sausages came out very tender and delicious. However, I really didn't care for the spaghetti sauce. I boiled the sausages in beer/water before putting it in the slow cooker and poured some of the mixture into the sauce.

This was pretty dang good for the minimal effort it took.  I made this on the stovetop so I simmered the sausage in enough water to cover the bottom of the pan for 10 minutes, turning once.  Then I drained the water and browned them for 10 minutes, turning once.  Added the remaining ingredients and simmered for 20 minutes.  I served them on hot dog buns (what I had) that I spread with a mixture of 1 clove of garlic, minced, and 1 t. butter.  Then I sprinkled them lightly with parmesan cheese and then mozzarella cheese.  Broiled them for about 3 minutes and topped them with the sausage and sauce.  Really yummy!  I will make this again!

This recipe was so good!  It was so tasty and it was perfect to add on some fresh hoagie rolls.  I used Prego sausage flavored sauce along with the pepper and onions and it just had so much flavor to it.  I can't wait to make this again!

I love this easy recipe! I use turkey sausage when I am able and usually serve it over pasta, but I bet it would be great on hoagie buns as well.

Really good and easy.  We used Bratwurst b/c it's was all we had on hand and it turned out really well.  Boiled Brats first for 20 mins, then threw them in with sauce, onions, and green peppers.  Served over white rice but would also be good with buns.

Oh wow! This is very good!! The sausage was so tender, it melted in our mouths.  We didn't have any problem with grease whatsoever, as other reviewers were worried about. And we followed the recipe to the letter. I can't wait to try this with meatballs for meatball subs! Thank you sooo much for this recipe! Leftover's are also great served over spaghetti the next day.

I wasn't sure how sausage was going to turn out in the slow cooker but this was soooooo good. I left out the peppers since I don't like them. I just got a plain tomatoe sauce and added Italian seasoning, sugar, and garlic salt to it. Let it cook for 4 hours and then put them in hoggie rolls with mozzarella cheese on top in the broiler for 2 min. I was fast, easy, and delicious.

This receipe is so easy, even for the novice cook. I used sweet chicken sausage and browned it before adding it to the crockpot. This cut out alot of the calories, fat and grease. Thanks for the easy dinner!

We loved this recipe! To have a little less grease, I cooked the sausage in a frying pan and then drained the grease (I know, what did I need a crock pot for??) But we added the sausage, sauce and veggies to the crock pot for 6 hours and the sauce tasted amazing (I added a little more Prego). We had it over whole wheat pasta and gnocchi...very delicious. Thanks for submitting!

This was a "solid 5" according to my 8 year old son.  I took the advice of another reviewer and cut the sausage up and browned it before I put it in the cooker, just to remove some fat.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  This smelled so good while cooking, I usually can't stand the smell of the slow cooker all day long.  I also used much more than the 4 oz. of sausage that was called for, it was just over a pound of sweet italian sausage.  It made for a delicious and easy meaty sauce.  I'm sure I will make it often and can't wait to use the leftovers later this week over pasta!

This was really good.  So good in fact that while it was cooking, I made excuses to go into the kitchen and get a whiff of it cooking.  I second the post who said to use a sausage and sauce you like on their own.  For my taste, a bland jar of marinara would not have done this recipe justice.  It turned out great and I called all my too-busy-to-cook friends to give them the link.

I am the only one who eats sausage and peppers in my family so I made 2 meals out of this. The first night I made a sandwhich with melted cheese on top. MMM. The sausage was so tender it melted in my mouth. The second night I made some ziti noodles and poured the sauce on top. MMM. another great meal.Thanks for posting this simple and delish recipe.

I was not a fan of this recipe but my family loved it. A great and easy idea for sub sandwhiches. The peppers are a must because they add texture. I can see that boiling the meat first might help reduce some of the fat. I will do that next time. Thank you for sharing.

Super easy and super delicious!

I threw everything in my slow cooker at lunch time and when I came home after work my whole house smelled wonderful!

The only change I made was adding a 2nd green pepper because I love them.

Leftovers tomorrow night will be either turned into a soup or a sauce over spaghetti. (I had to limit the amount my dh ate in order to have any leftovers!)

This is "ok" and something quick to throw together.  I did as another reviewer suggested and boiled the sausage for 7 minutes prior to putting it in the crock pot to remove some of the grease.  I liked that suggestion.  I used an Italian sausage, can or bottled sauce is in the "ok" category for me and cannot replace home-made sauce for taste.  But having said that, for a quick, throw together meal, it's worth keeping. I would serve it to family--not company as it is still a 3 rating in my book.

Delicious exactly as written. I will make this many times but I will omit the hot sausage since it was too spicy for my tummy. Thank you for such a delicious and easy recipe!

Great recipe but too much sauce. Used only half the sauce and quantity was perfect, a lb. pack of 5 sausages, onions, poblano pepper and a tablespoon of cajun seasoning in a small 2 qt slow cooker.

Recipe is ok but a couple of changes that need to be made.  You need to sear off Italian Sausage or the sauce will be way to oily.  Don’t add the sausage in the very beginning or the sausage will be over cooked and mealy. If you do add them from the beginning I would remove them when they are cooked through and pull them out and then add them back in at the end. The flavor is good but make sure to use a good Quality Italian Sausage.

We make this all the time. Definitely simmer the sausages for a few minutes (prick them with a fork first) to remove grease. Alternatively,  use leaner italian style turkey sausages. We like them both! I also slice the sausages into coins  after cooking, throw them back in to the sauce and use it for pasta.

This was great. So easy and really yummy. My husband and son loved it. I too simmered the sausages to eleminate the grease. I did sprinkle garlic powder and Italian seasoning on top and next time increase onions and pepper for more vegies on the sandwich. Thank you. I will make again.

These were great. Get quality sausage and you won’t get lots of grease. Don’t use ground sausage that’s just not following the recipe. Extra peppers and onions and good the next day too.

This was great and so easy! I didn't cook for 6 hours, more like 4-5 hours.  Served these up on a split hoagie bun and topped with mozzarella cheese.  Threw them under the broiler @  450F for a few minutes to toast the buns and bubble the cheese.  Delish!

HELPFUL TIP TO MAKE THIS TOP NOTCH:  I never would have thought putting this in the slow cooker for several hours would result in the softest sausage ever.  The one thing that each of the kids and husband complained about is the hot dog bun needed to be toasted first.  It was a soggy mess b/c of the extremely hot sausage/added liquid.  So I laid the open buns on the frying pan until toasty, and it perfected this!

This is surprisingly delicious.  Just don’t leave in crock pot too long otherwise they’ll fall apart.

I lost the recipe and so glad to find it again.  Doubled it and used two Italian frying peppers in addition to the green peppers.  I did not double the sauce and there was still plenty of juice, however  add more sauce if you prefer it to be thicker.   Love this recipe!

The only thing I changed was less peppers and onions because we were using up all I had.. Used Paul Newman Marinara sauce and the 4 large links of Italian sausage I had just taken from the freezer. Cooked it on high for about 5 hours and  served over buttered rice. Very good and easy and even the skins on the sausage which my husband usually discards were soft and easy to eat. Would certainly make again.

Just made this and can’t wait to make it again. Only used a half jar of sauce because it was already open. Did NOT precook the sausage and it was fine. Next time I will add more onion. Used frozen sliced peppers.

This smelled SO good cooking today.  I was pleasantly surprised to see how plump, juicy, and FAT the sausages got.  This is an excellent recipe.

Awesome recipe & a great time savor than cooking it on the stove top.  Followed the recipe as it was stated, with the following changes; Used poultry sausage "dietary restrictions) & did not fry the sausage before.  Also added 1 1/2 jars of pasta sauce, 1/4 of cup of Marsala cooking wine, 1 tablespoon of dried basil, 1 tablespoon of dried oregano & 1 table spoons of olive oil.  Served on a bed of angel hair pasta, with garlic bread, oven roasted romaine salad & of course a glass of Chianti.   Thank you so much for sharing such a wonderful and easy recipe with us all.

I made this with five sweet sausages, one big green bell pepper, half of a very large onion, and a small can of diced tomatoes. I put everything in my slow cooker, added Italian seasoning, and cooked on low for seven hours. This was served in hoagie rolls. AMAZING! I invited a friend to dinner and she could not stop raving about how good it was! I will make this regularly. Delicious! I will add minced garlic next time, too.

Edit: Minced garlic makes it even better!!

Left this cooking in a crockpot as we went for a hike.
6 hours was a little to long as sausages fell apart as picked up.
Taste was amazing and even the lil one had 2 full sausage on a bun for dinner.

So good considering how simple this is. Made my own simple pasta sauce and pre-simmered the sausages to get rid of some the fat. Ate them on buns with mozza and spaghetti squash on the side to soak up the extra sauce. Will definitely make it again!

Amazing, easiest recipe ever!! I followed the other reviewers idea to brown and drain the meat before hand.  I sliced the brats up. I used Classico brand pasta sauce "basil and tomato" flavor. I had a bunch of random brats and ultimately chose to use 4 elk brats and 4 spicy italian lamb brats. A little salt, a little pepper, a dash of cumin and basil-BAM! So easy and amazing. My boyfriend loves me a little more after eating this sandwich haha

This was fantastic!! Easy and delicious. I made a few minor changes though. First I used New Orleans Sausage since I was out of Italian. I also took some of the other reviewers suggestions and boiled the sausage for 20 mins prior to cooking it. I used only 6 sausages and used a tad less tomato sauce then suggested. Served on a bun over a pile of shredded mozza cheese oh my so good!!!!

This method did cook the sausages well, and the peppers and onions blended into the sauce nicely.  The sausages didn't have any real snap to them, and they had no juice to speak of.  4 stars.

This recipe is simple, easy and delicious. I browned the sausages before placing in the crock. Then I sautéed the onions and bell pepper in the sausage grease. But I didn't add the veggies until the last hour of cooking so they weren't mushy. My son doesn't like sausage so I added meatballs too which were delicious.

I added a handful of jalapeños and a half cup of wine which made the "sauce" more watery and then threw in half a box of pasta after it was finished cooking and this completely changed the recipe and it became a pasta dish!!!

Used TJ's sweet chicken Italian sausages (in cellophane) and TJ Marinara.  Slice onions (not dice).  Browned sausage and onions in dutch oven then added rest and cooked on low x 6 hours.  Very good, very easy.

Easy to make because you used prepared sauce. I used chicken sausage for a healthier version. The sauce was not as thick as it should have been for sandwiches, even after adding tomato paste.

I had turkey Italian sausages, that I browned on the stovetop before adding them to the slow cooker.  I added the sliced peppers (plus one jalapeño) and onions the last 1 1/2 hrs. so they won't turn to mush.  I will do so again, the next time.  If you crack the lid during the last hour of cooking, it will help the sauce thicken up, a little.  We enjoyed this delicious dish over whole wheat pasta.  Served it with sliced Italian bread and 'Easy Broccoli Bacon Salad' from AR.

Really flavorful. I like to grill or fry the sausages for a bit to remove some of the grease. A touch of red pepper flakes and bay leaf adds more flavor.

Very good.  We have a local sausage maker whose Italian sausage is very lean and delicious, so greasiness wasn't a factor.

I was a little worried when I saw it in the end, but my family devoured it (a family of picky eaters)!!    So easy and smelled amazing!   I had to make double the amount for my big family but even stretching the ingredients did not effect the taste.   I will be making this again soon!

Since the price of meat has gone up,we decided to make our own sausage.   We made two kinds just to test it out,one with all kinds of cheese and the other one was stuffed with peppers and onions..this recipe was just what I was looking for.I used the progresso fire roasted tomato starter sauce.I added some froze peppers and onions. An hour before it was done,I cut up some fresh peppers and onions and threw them in..Hubby LOVED IT.Will make again.

This was a very easy recipe and it was delicious! I took the advise of other reviewers and boiled the sausage for about 30 minutes before placing it in the crockpot. It was the most tender sausage I've ever eaten! This is a keeper! Thanks!

Based on other reviews I browned the sausage first and poked holes to allow some of the grease to drain.   I added additional onion and two cloves of garlic.  I didn't find the dish greasy at all.  I served in hoagie rolls topped with cheese.  Family loved it!  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was simple and delicious. I did take the suggestion of piercing and simmering the sausage for about 15 min before putting them in the crock pot. I also used a garlic & onion flavored jar of sauce and a frozen bag of peppers & onions. I look forward to making it again!

My friends and family think I am the Bomb when I make this. One thing I tried differently was leaving the casings on and piercing the sausage before cooking many times to give it a bit of juicy tender flavor.

On the "easy" scale this is a ten.
 We quickly browned our sausage in a little oil & garlic.
 Used homemade sauce and added two pieces of Andouille for the seasoning. 
 Served over white rice this was a no fuss meal.

I made this in the crock pot.  I boiled the sausage first and simmered for 25-30 mins to get alot of the fat out and make the sausage tender especially for use on a roll.  i used that pot for spaghetti later so i didn't have to dirty another. I added1 tbs of italian spices, 1 tbs granulated garlic and  s&p to taste. next i stick the whole crock into the microwave for 10-15 mins on med to get it up to temp.  since the sausage is cooked, it now only takes a couple of hours on high for everything to mesh.

It was okay, but nothing to jump for joy over; maybe if I had used a higher-quality spaghetti sauce. Also, I think that the sausages need to be pricked several times to allow the sauce flavor to soak in. No

I have been using this for years and if you get decent Italian sausage you can't lose.  I use a large white onion and slice it into 1/2" slabs.

I browned the Italian sweet sausage in a skillet before putting in the crockpot.  I used about 2.5 lbs. of sausage so I added 1/2 of a second jar of sauce too.  Can never have too many leftovers!  This was the perfect dinner for a drizzly Autumn day.

I just made this recipe AGAIN last night and now i'm eating lefotevers for lunch. This reminds me of the sausages I used to get at our county fair, mmmmm so good! Like other reviewers, I too added a red pepper and browned up the sausage before sticking it in the crock pot. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I tried this because I had the all the ingredients and it seemed so simple to make - I tried the sauce exactly as written - can't see how people can be down on it when they fudge the receipe - anyway, it was very tasty - slow cooking the sausage gave the sauce such a deep taste - used remainder over spaghetti the following day - did add alittle garlic.

I make this all the time. It's my favorite way to make Italian sausage!! I add frozen meatballs to my mixture, cook all day in the slow cooker, then when I come home I simply cook up some whole wheat pasta and we have a delicious and hearty dinner!

I have been making this for some time. Yes, it goes fast! I use Newmans Garlic Sauce & add more fresh garlic as well! My family loves garlic! Any leftovers, if any, you can cut up the sausage & make it with spaghetti! Try it, it really is a hit with company!

To me, this was just ok. I think the sauce you use really makes a difference, I just didn't see anything special about this. But I rated it 4 stars because my husband absolutely loved this and ate at least 3 helpings. It was very easy to make, so that's a plus.

I use turkey or chicken sausage almost exclusively. This is a great way to reduce calories and eliminate all the grease you all commented on. My husband loves sausage bombers at restaurants and I could never duplicate them. This recipe was perfect!!

This recipe I made tonight when I got it in my inbox & it was great! Easy & quick! I cooked it with the lil beef link sausage & lamb sausage. The lamb sausage I boiled for 15 minutes first before adding to the cooker. I did add Italian seasoning, garlic cloves, onion powder, salt & pepper. And we served it over egg noodles, along with Hawaiian sweet rolls! Everyone is happy and stuffed! :)

This is a great easy meal. Nice to have ready after a long day of hiking or surfing. We used spicy chicken sausage in addition to the sausage the recipe calls for. Both work equally well. Nice on toasted rolls and with a veggie side.

Fantastic!  My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe, although maybe my crockpot runs hot because I only did this for 4 hours on high and it was so tender and juicy, and still fully cooked.  We toasted some sandwich rolls with mozzarella and then topped with the sausage and sauce.  We will definitely repeat.

I have made it this way as well as using canned stewed tomatoes.  Also- any leftovers get thrown into a batch of 15 bean soup- which is also equally yummy. I follow the recipe on the package of beans.

As others suggested, I boiled the sausages for approximately 10 minutes before tossing them in the crockpot.  This was a *HIT* at our house...the kids thought that "meatball subs" were great (even my picky eater didn't "yuck" it!!!), and it was super easy for a football night, PLUS we have enough leftovers that we cut up the remaining sausage within the sauce and are going to do spaghetti later on in the week!!!

My husband LOVED this.  Even my picky 11 year old said it was good (and she doesn't like sausage).  First time I made this, I used hot sausage and served over rolls with mozzarella.  It was too hot even for hubby and me, but we ate it anyway (because it was sooo good).  This time I used mild sausage, added some extra seasoning and served over rotini noodles (also with mozzarella). Will be making this again and again.

This was GREAT! Last night, I quickly browned the sausages in some olive oil and put them into the slow cooker. Then I added the peppers and onions into the same pan and sauteed them real quick and placed them on top of the sausages and poured on the sauce. This morning, before I headed out, I put them on to cook and when I came home the house smelled fantastic and dinner was about ready. These were so tender and flavorful and I will cook my sausages this way from now on! I don't really think that me taking the extra step to brown/sautee everything made a huge difference. I think they would have came out just as good if I had not. I just had some extra time on my hands this time, lol! Thanks for sharing. :)

Delicious as written. We used some sweet italian sausages, and some mild italian sausages. The family seemed to prefer the sweet sausages. Cut the leftover sausage into bite-sized chunks for spaghetti later in the week. We're adding this to our dinner menu.

My husband LOVED this dish. I am not a big one for sausage and green peppers, but I actually really liked this. The sausage wasn't difficult to chew and, having been cooked so long, it was full of all the fatty parts that usually gross me out.

This recipe couldn't be easier to make. My husband, who loves sandwiches and hoagies, was concerned after eating one for lunch that his brother would eat the rest and not leave him any for dinner.  I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Great recipe! I used turkey brats to try and keep things a bit lighter, and had to substitute a bit of spaghetti sauce with stewed tomatoes, but it still turned out fantastic! There weren't even any complaints from the kid about the veggies :)

I also boiled the sausage first to get rid of some of the grease.  After this was done cooking, it was the softest sausage I've ever had!  Very good!

I made this today and I was not too impressed. great idea if you have your own sauce I think. jar sauce does not cut it ( no matter who makes it ) to me. Also  should have used my tried and true sausage instead of whole Foods brand. no bueno. I will use the slow cooker idea and will use it again when I have my fav sausage on hand.

This was excellent. I'm not a huge sausage fan but I really enjoyed this. We doubled up the recipe and had the sausage & sauce over noodles one night and in buns the next. Even my 5.5 and amost 3 year old loved this. This is a new family favorite.

True, more of a method than a recipe, but still very tasty - and it's certainly not like I thought of it!  I played a little fast and loose with amounts - one and a half huge onions, 2 fresh red peppers plus the remnants of a bag of frozen ones, an entire jar of pasta sauce and a bit of water.  I used hot turkey Italian sausage and two pre-cooked chicken ones that I had leftover.  I didn't brown any off the sausage first, although I considered it, and it turned out to be fine that way.  Made a ton with all my additions.  We ate it on hoagie rolls with shredded mozzarella tonight and will eat it again over pasta in a few days.  Thanks!  EDIT:  Less good over pasta; the sauce was a little thin.  Soaked wonderfully into hoagie rolls but didn't do much for penne.  We'll stick to the sandwiches.

Great for a busy family meal to just throw in crockpot and forget.  I too browned my fresh, hot Italian sausages, then softened the peppers and onions in sausage drippings before adding to pot.  I used Leftover homemade marinara and about a teasp. red pepper flakes.  We put some smoked provelone slices on our sandwiches-YUM.  I have served the sausages & sauce over pasta with good results too.

I used smoked bratwurst sausages and left out the green pepper.  We had it on toasted hoagie rolls with melted mozzarella cheese.  I am freezing the leftovers to use as spaghetti sauce as others recommended.  This was definitely an easy dish to put together and the results were pleasing!

This is a great recipe.  I've done this one several times.  Once on the stove top and the other 2 times in a slow cooker.  I love it and look forward to having it when I can.

Just moved to Alaska and this was the perfect meal to come home to after a long day. I used a lot of garlic, red bell peppers, s and p, garlic powder, and a white onion. So So good. We ate it on rolls, and froze the rest to use as spaghetti sauce.. Try this one!!

My husband loves this. It's so easy although I do brown the sausage before putting it in the slow cooker. Lots of leftovers that are really tasty. Great over pasta and hoagie buns.

No leftovers!  And I used homemade saude from the freezer, but I am sure it would be great with the store-bought.  Absolutely delicious.

I loved this recipe!  I did boil the sausage for 20 minutes to get some of the grease off.  I added a bit more sauce as that is our preference and some additional green peppers.  It came out great and my husband and sister loved it!

Made it and it did not turn out well at all, the sauce had dried up and it was only as tasty as the sauce so I could've just used ground sausage and simmered on the stove.

It seems on this site that people throw 5 stars around if it is edible.  ???  I saved about 5 and a half hours by doing this on the stove top and I am sure that I didn't miss anything.  The taste was ok but sometimes some things don't need a slow cooking.  Edible yes, 5 stars NOT.

I changed the recipe as people recommended.  I boiled the sausage for about 30 minutes, then put everything in the crockpot.  I couldn't have imagined the grease had it not been boiled.  It turned out wonderful!  The sausage actually just fell apart.  My husband (who loves italian sausage) said it was "incredible".  Will definitely make again!

I love this recipe. It cooks the sausage just perfect. I use turkey sausage for it. Tonight I varied the recipe and used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the jar of spaghetti sauce. I served it to my husband over cous cous. He added some hot sauce and loved it. I served it to my 2 and 4 year old with white rice. they couldn't get enough. Next time I am going to throw some garlic cloves in also!

Wanted to make sausage and peppers but didn't want to do the whole prep thing.  Found a recipe on Allrecipes for my slow cooker and made it.  So quick, EASY and tasty!  Will make again, and tell friends.

This is a great, easy recipe.  Halved the amount of onion and added a little bit of garlic and oregano.  I served over instant white rice.  makes a great, fast meal.
