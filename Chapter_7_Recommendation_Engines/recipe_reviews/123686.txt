Very easy, using things I already had in my pantry. I made it in a bundt pan and baked it for 55 minutes- turned out beautifully!  I will make this again for sure!

I made this for a family brunch and everyone LOVED it.  I also ommitted the nuts since I didn't have any on hand, and used a spice cake since that was all I had.  I also changed the glaze because I don't like the plain sugar/water combo.  I used 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar, 
1 tablespoon cream cheese,
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, and 1 tbsp water.  I put it in a sandwich bag and piped it over the top. I loved the glaze, it really completed the cake!  I would like to try this again someday with a yellow cake mix as called for, and see which i like better.
YUM! thanks for the recipe

Fantastic recipe! Easy and sooooo delicious. I bought cinnamon graham crackers (instead of plain graham crackers), and a good thing too since I found I was out of cinnamon, but it ended up perfect in the end. The cake is so moist and delicious, and there's plenty of streusel (and I like a LOT of streusel, so that's saying something). The office thinks I'm a god for bringing this dish in to work. Cook it in an $2.50 disposable foil pan and it's perfect for bringing to work or pot-lucks. I cooked it the night before, then put it in a 200-degree oven the next morning for 30 minutes to warm it up again. It was great and moist still. It's rare I find a recipe that I don't want to tweak in some small way, but this is great as is!

I give this 5 stars because not only is it VERY tasty, but super easy.  The cake mix called for three eggs but I only had two.  I think by leaving one of the eggs out, it might have helped reduce the cakiness  (is that a word?).  I also left out the nuts since many don't like them.  For the icing, I just microwaved some vanilla icing with a touch of cream cheese and then drizzled it on.

My husband and I really liked this coffee cake.  It does seem more like a cake versus a coffee cake but it's still great for breakfast.  I used a white cake mix instead of a yellow one because that's what I had in the cupboard.  
FYI-one pkg of graham crackers is almost equal to 1 1/2 c. of graham cracker crumbs

I have been making this coffee cake for years and love it.  I add a powdered sugar drizzle with a touch of maple - a friend calls it "a little slice of heaven".  Delicious!

I love this recipe, it is so good!  I did not have a yellow cake mix, so I used a spice cake mix; and I used cinnamon graham crackers.  Every thing else was the same.  This coffee cake turned out wonderfully.  Thanks a bunch, I will use this quite often.

This is a great recipe and super easy.  Would not change a thing!!  The 1 1/2 cups of crushed graham crackers = one bundle in a box.  YUMMY!!

Wow, I made this with gingersnaps since I had them on hand and I used a box of golden butter cake (next time I will try vanilla, I avoid yellow cake mix since it really taste like box mix to me). I followed previous suggestions and used a full 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and I left out the glaze since I ran out of time.  I brought this to work and everyone raved, it was gone in minutes.

Made for carry-in at work.  Easy to throw together, and got rave reviews by everyone.  Used low-fat cinnamon graham crackers.

This is the absolute best coffee cake!!! I've made this recipe 3 times already and I am making it for the 4th time as soon as my butter softens. The only things I do different is after pouring half the batter I only put about 1/3 of the streusel on and save the other 2/3 for the top. I found if you if you do half it then it ends up being heavy and sinks to the bottom. The first time I made it I had an upside down coffee cake. I also omit the pecans as we no not like nuts in our desert. I add a little vanilla extract to the cake batter for a little extra flavor. Also let it cool for half an hour or so before you put on the sugar glaze and make sure it is not to thin. The first time I put it on when it was warm and it just dissolved.  Thank You... this is a great recipe!!!!

I have to rate this only 3 stars for several reasons. First off, the cake tasted like a yellow cake mix. There wasn't anything interesting about the flavor. Second, there is way too much butter in the streusel mixture. Third, I used cinnamon graham crackers as other reviews suggested, spending time crushing them. Waste of time. Buy the graham cracker crumbs and add extra cinnamon if you want to. Lastly, definitely not enough cinnamon for me and I used 2 tsps., PLUS the cinnamon crackers. I served this for brunch, no one asked for the recipe (which is a sure sign that it was nothing special), and with 8 guests, I still have half of it left. Perhaps it would be better with a spice cake mix, but as is, it tastes like a boxed cake. Sorry.

Made this for Easter and it was a major hit with my family and friends! They were literally oooing and ahhing with every bite! My changes were: I doubled the graham crackers, pecans, cinnamon and eyeballed the butter. Instead of the glaze, I opted to sift on confectioners sugar. Ridiculously easy but so amazingly yummy. Thanks!

I was looking for a fast coffee cake recipe to make this morning,  I had everything on hand to bake this recipe.  It came out wonderful, so moist with a little crunch from the pecans and graham crackers.  I followed the recipe exactly and only changed the glaze by adding a dash of cinnamon and vanilla to it.  
We have Christmas Eve dinner at our house, I think I am going to make this recipe in decorative loaf pans as a gift to our guests so they can have it with their Christmas breakfast.

I LOVED this recipe, and so did my family! The only changes i made was I added some instant coffee to the cake batter (just because me and my family love coffee so i add it to a lot of recipes) and i used my own icing recipe. But great recipe, very simple and delicious and i'll definitely be making it again!

I really was suprised at how good this was.  I made if for a breakfast for dinner get together.  I had several comments that it tasted like it had come from a professional bakery.  I made it in a bunt pan.  I put a small amount of batter at the bottom, a layer of the streusel, another layer of batter, another layer of streusel, and one final layer of batter.  I used cinnamon graham crackers and a yellow butter cake mix.  I baked it for 55 minutes.  Not only did it taste good, but it was very visually appealing with the two layers of streusel in the cake slices.  This is the first coffee cake I've ever made and I will definitely be making it again.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe.

LOVED THIS COFFEE CAKE!!!!!  I had some leftover yellow cake mix batter in the fridge from some cupcakes I had made.  Needed a quick breakfasty snack to serve family the morning my MIL passed away. So used the serving converter to decrease the recipe by half, used cinn. sugar graham crackers (all I had).  You should have heard the oohs & aahs round the table - thanks for helping me impress the in-laws!  This is MY coffee cake recipe from now on!

Simply fantastic, I made it with French vanilla cake mix and added brown sugar to the middle and top.  I may leave one egg out off the mix next time to make it less cake-like.

This was very good and definitely a crowd-pleaser.  I skipped on the pecans because most of my family isn't a huge fan of nuts.  Other than that, I followed it to a T and it turned out great!  Wonderful flavor and very moist.  It hardly lasted three days.

Delicious!  I left out the nuts for my hubbie and added 2 apples, peeled and diced (one in each layer).  
I only used 2 eggs in the hopes of getting a less 'cakey' result, so my only complaint may have been my fault...a little too fluffy and crumbly.  I had hoped removing an egg would work like (or opposite) adding an egg to brownies for the cake-like brownies recipe on the back of the box.

My mom had graham cracker crumbs that she wanted to use. I made this and she loved it! It was even better the next day!

I'm going to give this a 3 because I'm going to try it again.  My mistakes this first time were .... I used a bundt pan instead of a half sheet pan, and I tried to "layer" the streusal topping twice in between layers of cake mix and there simple wasn't enough cake mix to support the weight of the topping and all of the topping went straight to the bottom of the pan (which is the top of the cake) and it just mushed up the top of the cake instead of being nice looking layers.  But because the taste was nice, I will definitely try this again but I will use a half sheet pan and I will not try to make "layers" of the streusal.  Also I used a yellow butter cake mix and I think that made it too rich, I will use just a yellow cake mix next time.  I think this could work, I'm willing to try it one more time and see!  FYI ... for me, one and a half cups of graham cracker crumbs turned out to be a little less than one of the three individually wrapped packages in the graham cracker box.

Very tasty coffee cake! Almost dessert-like. I used organic yellow cake mix to avoid the hydrogenated oils/trans-fats and the mix isn't quite the 18.25 oz recommended. It was smaller than 13 x 9, but still very good and all of my friends liked it, too! Smells heavenly.

WOWZA!  Look no further for a crowd pleaser.  I made this in a bundt pan and cooked for as long as the box said for a bundt.  Turned out moist and everyone could not wait until it had cooled.  They watched it like it would do a trick.  Well it did, wow, will definately make again.  Use Betty Crocker pudding cake mix.

This is a very tasty cake!  I did use a spice cake mix instead of yellow since I had it on hand.  I needed the cake quickly (within an hour) to give to neighbors that were moving away.  I made 1.5 times the amount of icing.  I would like to try it with a yellow cake mix as we prefer that over spice.  I baked in two 8x8 pans so we could have half of the cake.

Yummy!!  This cake was so easy and delicious.  I even messed up and put all the graham mixture in the middle and didn't have any for the top and it was still great.  I did cut down the peacans to about 1/4 cup.  Next time I will remember to keep some crumbs for the top.  Great recipe, Thanks!!

This was a quick, easy and really good recipe! I added some vanilla extract to the cake mix to give it a more homemade taste and everything else I did the same. I baked it in a tube pan and it was finished in about 36 minutes. Loved it!!

this was such an easy and moist coffee cake to make.  the graham cracker crumbs add such a wonderful taste.  just as an added bonus, i tossed in about 1 cup of cinnamon flavored baking chips which made this yummy cake even more delicious!

This was great - I followed the directions exactly and it turned out wonderfully.  I sent some home with my mom to share with my dad and brother - they haven't even finished what I sent, and they're already asking me to make it again!

following other reviews I omitted one egg and then I used only a third of the streusel in the middle and 2/3 on top and I very carefully spread it in small amounts over the surface of the batter and it still ended up at the bottom. It was tasty even still but I'm going to keep looking for a coffee cake recipe where the topping stays put.

Great recipe!  Like others, I played around with it a bit.  Chopped 2 green apples and mixed them with 1 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. nutmeg and sprinkled them over the first layer of graham cracker crumbs.  Added 2 T. orange juice to the powdered sugar glaze instead of water.  Was a big hit at the brunch this morning.  Lucky I grabbed a little piece before it went out or I wouldn't have been able to taste it and give a review!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this several times now, since my family keeps asking for it! It's a perfect, easy, and incredibly impressive coffee cake. I switched out pecans for walnuts; it was just a personal preference. I also added a dash of nutmeg to the streusel. Sprinkling it with nuts after baking, with the glaze, makes it super photogenic. Another reviewer used a spice cake box mix, and I think I'll try that next time.

As written, the cake would have been very good.  Especially the topping!  I added one can of jellied cranberry sauce cut into small pieces just under the streusel topping, and it turned out quite yummy.  This gave it additional flavor and interest.

Sinful! I made this today with a few changes made. I didn't use a glaze. I felt it was sweet enough with all the streusel. I also baked mine in a Bundt pan, took just short of 60 minutes to bake all the way through. Popped out of the Bundt pan just fine. Slices nicely and tastes even better. Highly recommended!! Especially if you're a streusel fan...you will love this!

Just made this.... It is soooo delicous!!! For some reason I don't like full sized cakes so made them into 24 cupcakes instead and only baked them for 22 minutes. Also added 3 table spoons maple syrup to the glaze. Turned out great. Next time I want to try using a spice cake mix instead. But I will definately be using this recipe again soon!

Took 1/2 hour prep time. I used cinnamon graham crackers, one sealed cracker package was 1 1/2 cups. Added 2 eggs to batter mix (not three). I used an aliminum 8x8 pan (sprayed with Pam) to give to host, and enough mix left to make six muffins for me. It was really good, but not great.

I was a bit skeptical at first about how the ingredients would come together, but it turned out delicious!  Also made it as a bundt cake.  I skipped the glaze topping, but it still came out sweet.

I don't often cook with cake mixes, but I gave this one a try, and let me tell you it is SOOO good. After I took it out of the oven my husband was asking me for a piece for 15 minutes. He loves this and has asked me to make another one even though it was just finished this morning. Awesome!

Delicious and easy.  Kids love it and it's hard to let it cool as the aroma as it's baking is unbelievable.  Have made many times, but don't bother with icing - great without

very good. I made doubled the recipe and made 4 loafs for a church sale. We went through one after supper to ensure it tasted well :)  I ommitted the pecans as I did not have any. Did not change anything else. Will make it again

This was excellent!  When I made the cake mix, I used FF yogurt rather than oil and eliminated one egg (only used 2).  In the topping, I used 1/4 cup of butter, 1/3 cup of sugar, and 1 1/2 cups of graham cracker crumbs.   I think the changes to the cake mix made it very fluffy!  My family and I loved it that way... I liked this so much better than a heavy coffee cake.

Yum!  I made this recipe with animal crackers instead of graham crackers because they were all I had and it was fantastic!  It only baked for 36 minutes before it was done.

I made this last night on a whim but didn't have a yellow cake mix, so I used vanilla.  Delicious!  I had to take the pan away from my husband because I didn't want him to eat it all!

I've made this one several times, for friends, cake walks for the kids, company. It is always a huge hit. I have to omit nuts due to allergies, and it's still good. Simple and just soooo good.

THIS. IS. DELICIOUS! i loved this recipe. i have a hard time finding a good coffee cake. i took a suggestion from someone who previously reviewed this recipe, and used cinnamon graham crackers. i also made a little extra streusel because i like it to be well covered on top--other than those changes, i followed the recipe which was pretty simple, and loved it!

I have already made this twice. My dad said it's the best coffee cake. My whole family loves it, and now I keep the ingredients so I can make it whenever they are craving it.  Just don't make it with white cake mix. It's not the same as it is with yellow!

Good...but not "great."   It is still missing something to be great.

Wonderful! Very yummy. I did however omit the pecans just because I didn't know if the guests eating it would all like nuts.

This is such an easy and simple and yet delicious coffee cake to make.  I left out the nuts, used a white cake mix (only kind I had) and the whole family loved it.  I will definitely make it again.  Thank you

Fantastic and easy!  I found some gingerbread graham crackers at the grocery store that no one in my household (including me) liked.  I crumbled these up and used them so they wouldn't go to waste, and it turned out to be a great holiday treat!  The sweetness of the cake and streusel took some of the 'bite' out of the gingerbread and complemented the cinnamon wonderfully.  I took it to work, and it was gone before all my co workers could arrive.

WOW!!!  I made this recipe on Christmas Day and my family could NOT stop raving about it.  (We did not add nuts to it, but everything else was the same.)
