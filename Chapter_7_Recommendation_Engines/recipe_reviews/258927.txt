7.23.17  After I took the photo, I realized that I had some nice blueberries in the fridge, so I threw them in as well.  This has a really interesting blend of ingredients.  You have the sweetness of the fruit and honey (cut back the honey, personal taste preference), the little kick from the jalapeno in the dressing, and the lime juice introduces the tart element...simply a good combination of sweet-sour-spicy.  This was my first time using  Tajin® , and it just put this over the top for me.  A really nice break from a traditional, typically sweet,  summer fruit salad.
