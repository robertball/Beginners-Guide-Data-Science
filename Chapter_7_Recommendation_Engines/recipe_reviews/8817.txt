OMIGOSH THIS IS SO GOOD! YOU HAVE TO TRY MY VERSION! SOOOO MUCH FLAVOR AND NOT RUNNY AT ALL!!!!!! 

My version, for more flavor: 
4 boneless/skinless chicken breasts (frozen), 1/2 ( or 3/4) jar of spaghetti sauce (eye ball it) (I use Classico Cabernet Marinara with Herbs) 1 can tomato paste, 1/2 green bell pepper chopped, 1/2 diced yellow onion, fresh sliced mushrooms, 3 tablespoons fresh garlic, light-medium sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes, heavy sprinkling of oregano, light-medium spinkle of black pepper (can always add more later), and fresh basil leaves torn up. Cook on low for 7-8 hours.

I altered this recipe a bit to suit our family's tastes but the recipe still served as a wonderful basis for a great dish.  I used only 3 boneless skinless breasts (whole) as we don't really care for leftover chicken, and threw them right in there frozen as I've heard other reviewers say they've done this and I wanted to try for those days when I forget to thaw.  It was cooked to perfection, fork tender and juicy in approx 7 hours.  How wonderful!  I used whole fresh mushrooms since they're easier to pick out (hate em!) and sliced the onion into rings for those who don't like them.  I am big on garlic so I added about 4 big cloves, chopped, and also added some Italian seasoning and basil.  1/4 cup of wine, a can of diced tomatoes (flavored) and a can of tomato paste and voila!  excellent, excellent chicken.  My hubby requested I make extra sauce for dipping and such.  Will make again and again!

Using FROZEN boneless skinless chicken breasts in slow cooking will keep the chicken from turning to mush. Some newer slow cooker cookbooks warn against this, but I've cooked many chicken recipes this way and never had a problem.  I've never needed to lengthen the cooking time. Be sure to double-check the chicken for doneness before serving. Great recipe!

As written, I could see why some reviews were less than favorable. To me, boneless chicken breasts just don't seem to constitute "cacciatore". The flavor just isn't there, but then again, that's only my opinion. I used bone-in pieces of chicken, which I browned in a skillet first and added the flavorful browned bits to the crock pot. The whole family was very happy with this tasty recipe. Thank you.

This is a great basic recipe, but I found it a bit bland & watery. I tried again & scaled it for 4 servings, used a small jar of spaghetti sauce & a can of tomato paste, which made a nice thick sauce. I also added spices (oregano, basil, seasoning salt, pepper) and used dehydrated onion. It came out great the 2nd time!

This is a great recipe.  Use a good brand of pasta sauce, add lots of garlic and peppers and you'll have a restaurant quality meal.  IMPORTANT NOTE:  If you use boneless, skinless breasts (as I did), only cook for about 4 to 5 (max) hours on LOW or else your chicken's texture will be like canned.

Yummy - about 4.5 stars actually. I cut the recipe in half and cooked on high for 4 hours. You don't need very much sauce. I would recommend using half the sauce it calls for in the beginning. Then towards the end you can add more if needed, that way it's not too runny. Also, I added the mushrooms about 15 minutes before it was done, then they aren't mushy, just perfect. Another suggestion is to always just saute the mushrooms, onions and garlic (even bell peppers if desired) in olive oil and then top the chicken and sauce with it. Yummy dish, will make again.

This was sensational.  I followed a variety of reviews and used frozen, boneless, skinless chicken thighs, went heavy handed on some oregano sprinkles, added in a few shakes of onion flakes, red pepper flakes, garlic powder and a couple heaping spoonfuls of minced garlic from the jar.  I used a tomato basil spaghetti sauce along with a can of tomato paste.  Used 1/2 of a large green bell pepper (diced), 1/2 of a small yellow onion (diced).  I started this all at 6 hours.  An hour before dinner time, I added in sliced mushrooms and chopped up a zucchini, threw that in and left the lid off the final 20 minutes and my sauce thickened up very nicely.  Seriously, this was so delicious.  Served over angel hair pasta, some fresh steamed green beans on the side and a slice of garlic bread.  I'm more excited about the left-overs for lunch tomorrow!

My family loves it.  Fast, easy.  Be careful to cover chicken completely in sauce or the exposed parts will dry out.

I rate this recipe 4 stars. Someone ought to edit it to indicate the needed amount of salt (which has been left out of the list of ingredients). I added some Italian seasoning herbs and a small can of Italian-flavored tomato paste. The liquid was rather runny so I had to thicken it with some cornstarch.

Very easy and good recipe to come home to!  I used fewer chicken breasts (3) because I needed a smaller dish - turned out fine!  I added 1/4 cup red wine that added even more flavor. I wouldn't recommend cooking it over 7 hours though - chicken gets a "pasty" texture somehow.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good. I implemented a LOT of changes as other reviewers indicated. I started with bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, sprinkled on salt and pepper, and browned in 1 tablespoon of olive oil and set aside. I then added the minced garlic, cooked for about 30 seconds, and deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup of red wine. I added 14 oz spaghetti sauce to the crockpot, 1 pepper, 1 onion, 8 oz sliced mushrooms, and a healthy pinch of crushed red pepper and 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning. I then added in the red wine mixture, mixed it all, and added the thighs. I cooked for 5 hours on low, and took out the thighs one hour before finished, removed the meat from the bones, and added back to the crockpot. Once finished, I put it all in a glass pan, topped with shredded mozzarella, and broiled until spotty brown, then served over rigatoni. Okay, I sure made a lot of changes, but it was FABULOUS and will be going in the regular rotation!

I love to make this with some minor variations. First I use about 2 - 3 lbs of chicken legs and thighs to save cost and give it more flavor,  Then I add an addition 15 oz can of tomato sauce;  Finally about 1 hour before its done I cover the entire mix with a 1 pound box of dry thin spaghetti or fettucini.  This will absorb all the excess liquid, while giving the pasta a great taste.  Total irresistable - truly a man hearty meal.

I was looking for the slow cooker version of this favorite recipe and saw the comments about dry chicken. Use a whole bird or thighs, breasts are not the best choice for this great dish. Use all the veggies you like, but don't forget the ROSEMARY - that's what makes this so good, along with the garlic, of course. Use 1/4 teaspoon of dry rosemary at first, until you get an idea of how much you like.

I made this tonight for my husband and I, this recipe was absolutely delicious. Though I made some changes, I would never have thought this recipe would go into a slow cooker. Here is what I did: 1) I browned my chicken (used 4 thighs and 5 legs) with a light base of flour in a non-stick pan. 2) I added minced garlic from a jar while chicken was browning. My hand is heavy when it comes to garlic. I love it. I did not measure. 3) I sprinkled some pepper flakes, italian seasoning, and garlic powder and continued to let meat brown. ( I think I browned the meat for about 15 mins all together) 4) I transferred chicken to slow cooker. Added some Ragu Robusto spaghetti sauce. I then added all the ingredients that was included in the recipe. 
The sauce was thick and tasty. This recipe was in no way bland. My recommendation is ato add some seasoning to give it flavor.

Wow! I have been searching for a chicken cacciatore recipe that reminded me of my mother's, and this is it! Plus, it's way less work than she did to produce basically the same great taste. I used frozen chicken breasts, a jar of bertolli roasted garlic sauce, then I added tomato paste, and additional garlic and herbs. Close to the end of cooking, I added onions, baby portabellas, green peppers, carrots and zucchini...served over angel hair...SO good, everyone ate silently!! I will most definately be making this again!!

This was OK.  Benefitted from the addition of some herbs such as basil or oregano.  Sauce was kind of thin...next time I would substitute something thicker like seasoned crushed or diced tomtatoes.  Put the chicken breasts in frozen and it came out fine!

I just fixed this for dinner tonight. My fiance and my brother came over for dinner and both loved it. I will definetly fix this one again. I added 4 bay leaves to the prepared sauce, omitted the green peppers, and added a splash of white wine (experimenting!) and it turned out so tasty. I also had thawed the chicken over night and cooked it on high for about 4 1/2 hours.

This meal was great.  I made my own tomato sauce using Giadia DeLaurentis' recipe for Simple Tomato sauce found at www.foodnetowrk.com.  I also used 3lb of boneless, skinless chicken thighs, 11oz of sliced mushrooms, dried oregano, basil, red pepper flakes, black pepper due to other reviewers suggestions and cooked on low ofr 7 hours.  We served ours over whole wheat linguine and this recipe is definitely a do over for us!

I just love this recipe! I use 6 skinless thighs for more flavor and 2 to 3 chicken breasts also skinless. I prefer 1 red bell pepper cut up and I sautéed my mushrooms first so the recipe is not as watery. I first slice a onion and lay slices on bottom of crock pot, then I add the thighs, then breasts, pour your favorite jar of sauce ( I use Gia Russa hot Sicilian ) then on top I lay the sautéed mushrooms, 3 diced fresh cloves of garlic and then a red and green bell coarsely chopped. I serve with ziti or penne! Wow what a comfort food for the whole family:)

This was very yummy and I love recipes I can throw in the crockpot and forget. I only used 2 breasts, a 32 oz jar of Classico Tomato Basil sauce, 1 green and 1 red pepper, as that's what I had on hand, no mushrooms (didn't have any), but substituted sliced black olives, 1 yellow onion, and 2 cloves of garlic. It cooked on high for about 5.5 hours. The chicken was very tender and kind of fell apart while stirring and dishing, but that was fine. I will make this again and will definitely include olives whether I have shrooms or not!

What a fabulous, super easy recipe!  I followed others suggestions and used 4 frozen boneless, skinless chicken breasts, a can of tomato paste and added italian seasoning.  For the sauce, I used a jarred marinara with burgundy wine that we like.  About an hour before serving, I removed the chicken from the crockpot, pulled it apart into large chunks and then put back into crockpot.  My husband and two girls couldn't get enought of it.  I love how quick it is.  So many crockpot recipes require a lot of steps ahead like browning meat, sauteeing veggies, etc.  For this recipe you just throw it all in!  One word of caution- I used sliced baby bella mushrooms.  They got very dark, almost black, by the end of cooking.  They tasted fine, but if you were serving this to company, you might want to just use white mushrooms.

I made this several nights ago and it was delicious.  I used frozen chicken breasts, a can of diced tomatoes (with juices), some spaghetti sauce and a little wine.  No veggies this time.  Then served it over spaghetti noodles and both husband and I loved it!  Pair with a salad and roll and it is great!

They LOVED it!  The pickies, they loved it!  I only had a 4 pound Perdue seasoned oven roaster, I used that, added a 6 oz can of tomato paste.  I also subbed green beans for the green peppers,  (that is how my husbands Gram used to make it for him)  Next time I will use 1/2 boneless, 1/2 leg/thigh pieces, although it is a bit greasier that way, it adds so much more flavor.  I used Inger's Spaghetti Sauce (from this site) instead of jarred, because you really do need a good sauce for this.  Don't be afraid to add a nice flavorful wine either...yum.  I will make this again & again.  Thanks so much Rosie!!

Excellent!  I added two jars of Classico Spicy Red Pepper sauce for a spicy taste.  The extra sauce was wonderful over pasta!  Can't wait to make it for company!  Thanks, Rosie!

After making this once modified by using 8 chicken thighs with skin, adding a can of fire roasted tomaotes, sliced onions, black olives & chopped garlic. Layered sauce, and half the chicken, onions, peppers, olives,garlic. Repeat. Since the chicken was frozen cooked on high for 8 hrs.

Everyone loved this dish. Next time thought I think I will add a little chicken broth to the mix because my sauce diluted down to a very think texture.

VERY GOOD RECIPE. I ADDED OREGANO SEASONING AND SALT AND USED PREGO PASTA BAKE SAUCE AND IT WAS GREAT. I USED BONELESS CHICKEN BREAST AND SET THE CROCKPOT ON LOW FOR 7 HOURS AND THE CHICKEN WAS PERFECT. THIS WAS EASY AND TASTY SO I WILL BE MAKING THIS AGAIN.

After reading the other reviews, I made the following adaptations:  doubled the garlic, added tomato paste, oregano and rosemary and cut the cooking time to 5 hours.  The chicken was tender and the sauce tasty.  This was a keeper!

The first time I made this, I burned it!  I put the slow cooker on 'Low' and I knew it was strong, but Wow!  We tried to eat it and just could not get passed the burnt flavour...  I tried the recipe again and made a few changes - I cubed the chicken, only used 1/2 a bell pepper, used whole canned mushrooms and substitued the onion with a sprinkle of onion powder and the garlic with a sprinkle of garlic powder.  AND I put the slow cooker on 'Keep Warm' this time and it came out perfect :)  These were all personal substitutes for either foods my husband didn't like added, or just our personal preferences when cooking.  It turned out wonderful and I grated some cheddar cheese for on top and that worked out well.  One thing I would have changed - I used a jar of Ragu for the sauce base and I think I will use another brand like Hunt's or something.  Ragu tends to be a thinner sauce and I would have liked it a bit thicker.  So next time I will use a thicker spaghetti sauce and just add little water if necessary.  Great, simple recipe for the slow cooker!  And wonderful with angel hair pasta!

I followed reviewer "kmilti " advice. boneless/skinless chicken breasts (frozen), 1/2 ( or 3/4) jar of spaghetti sauce (eye ball it), 1 can tomato paste, 1/2 green bell pepper chopped, 1/2 diced yellow onion, fresh sliced mushrooms, 3 tablespoons fresh garlic, light-medium sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes, heavy sprinkling of oregano, light-medium spinkle of black pepper (can always add more later), and fresh basil leaves torn up. Cook on low for 7-8 hours. Excellent! Thanks for sharing!!

My husband loved this.  After making it the first time I found the chicken breast were very dried out and the sauce a bit on the wet side.  The second time around I used chicken thighs and add a couple tablespoons of tomato paste and had much better results.  I also added some fresh basil and oregano out of my window box at the last 20 minutes of cooking.

I have made this recipe a few times.  I also used tomato paste as suggested.  My grocery store has cut up veggies already for sale and that cuts down the time.  I put on in the morning when I leave for work and it is done when I get home.  I sometimes make rice with it or top it on a baked potato. I put in frozen breasts and they don't dry out like defrosted ones.  It is a excellent recipe.  It is definitely a keeper.

We loved this. I added 1 can of Italian-style stewed tomatoes and 1 can tomato paste as my breasts were big &  I some reviewers indicated they could have used more sauce. I also threw in one stalk of celery, chopped and a few chopped baby carrots (because I had them). Hubby particularly loved this recipe and has asked for it to be added to our regular rotation. Thanks, Rosie!

We enjoyed this easy to prepare dish on a busy weekend night.  After reading the other reviewers comments, I added some red pepper flakes to add some flavor and spiciness to this dish.  The next time I prepare this I think I will hold off on adding the vegetables until the last 1/2 of cooking time to avoid overcooking and will also add a bit of tomato paste to thicken up the sauce.  I served this over wide egg noodles.  A very tasty and  satifying dish!

This is a very good no fuss recipe.  I deleted the peppers for personal taste.  I added a can of drained artichoke hearts, more garlic, a bit of rosemary,  basil and black olives.  Served over whole wheat linguine.  Very tasty. Use a good quality sauce.  I also shortened the cooking time by throwing it in the oven covered at 350 for 1 hour.  Will definitely make this when on the fly.....maybe next time in the slow cooker.

The key here is to use chicken thighs, not breasts. I've made it both ways and it is soooo much more flavorful using thighs. I also add about 1/4 c. dry white wine and a handful of chopped fresh basil. Delish!!

This was very bland and the sauce was very thin.  It is a good start for a recipe, but it needs a whole lot of help!  Don't be afraid to be creative and add your own touch and flavor b/c this recipe needs it.

This was excellent!  The chicken breasts I had were rather large, so I only used four instead of six.  I used a large portobella mushroom and only had one and a half bell peppers, but that turned out to be plenty.  The spaghetti sauce I had was Hunt's brand Four Cheese flavor, which went really nicely in this dish.  I shredded the chicken into the sauce and served it over brown jasmine rice cooked in chicken broth with a little butter mixed in.  We'll be adding this one to our regular rotation for sure!

i use another version of this recipe. browning the chicken,onion, garlic and then adding to the slow cooker. i also had the sliced mushroom 45 minutes to ending the cooking or just on warm they add a lot of water. really good. add red wine vinegar or vinegar 1 tablespoon for a little more zip. i used potatoes instead of spaghetti, i think it would get really mushy otherwise.

I liked this pretty well, but I will tweak it more next time.  I added the can of tomato paste for thickness, and I think that I should have also added an envelope of the prepared dry spaghetti sauce mix to keep the flavor high.  I did add more garlic and spices, but this was all about "easy" for me, so I should have just dumped in a packet.  I do think the jarred sauce you choose makes a HUGE difference, pick one that is really top notch.  That all said, everyone ate it and seemed good with it, and I will make it again for sure with the extra packet.

This needed more flavor for our tastes, so I was heavy handed with the Italian seasoning the second time I cooked it. I also found a full day of cooking was too much, so I cut back on cooking time and thickened the sauce with corn starch before serving.  It was all gone by the end of the meal.  :)

This recipe is a big hit with my husband, so it is a big hit we me.  It made 
so much extra sauce that I froze the sauce, and the next time I made it all I
had to do was put the chicken in the crock pot, and pour the sauce on top.  I only
things I would like to correct is that the sauce is very loose, no thickness to it.
Thanks, Jessica

I did a test prep yesterday.  added 1 can of diced Italian tomatoes w/Basil,garlic,oregano.  A little juicy but added Italian seasoned bread crumbs to thicken.  Served over linguini...great!  Now I will expand the recipe to serve about 50 at  a Men's lunch group, using two large slow roaster cookers.
Will use a Marinara sauce as well as spaghetti sauce.

Very good for how simple it is to make...I added celery, 1/4c red wine, a lot of Italian Seasoning, pepper and fresh rosemary. After tasting it, I think it would have been in need of something if it weren't for the rosemary. I used frozen chicken breast tenderloins, which worked great, and cooked on low for about 6 hours. A great base to tailor to your own preferences - and super easy!!

AWESOME! I just fell in love with my slow cooker recently. This made my kitchen smell yummy. I used a lot of modifications: tomato paste, not so much sauce (it does kinda get runny), Italian seasoning sprinkled on veggies -- made a huge difference. Thank you all the reviewers!

I made this recipe with 8 chicken thighs.  I rubbed them with the minced garlic.  Added all ingredients, substituting 1 jar of vodka sauce and included 1 small can of tomato paste (as suggested by others).  My husband loved the recipe (definitely a keeper).  I liked using the thighs and de-boned them at the end of cooking time (only 8 bones to take out!).  So easy and so good!

This was soooo good. I made this while we were on vacation and it was a big hit!  I added cut up sweet sausage to mine and also added a little cumin and chili powder to give it a little kick. Will definately be making this again. Great Recipe!

I made as directed and served over noodles.  Good recipe, although next time I will use homemade spaghetti sauce (personal pref).  I liked that all the ingredients are staples in my house.  Thank you for sharing what will be made often.

Pretty good and easy....I added a little salt, fresh cracked pepper, oregano and dried basil leaves for more flavor. Served over whole grain angel hair pasta and steamed broccoli on the side. I topped mine with some grated romano cheese and hot ted pepper flakes. Next time I will add a can of tomato paste to thicken the sauce and maybe add some wine. Thanks!

Turned out great, I browned chicken first added onion, garlic and bell pepper. Put this and ingredients into crockpot.  I read many years ago to thicken a sauce just take the lid off on the last hour of cooking.  I cooked on High for 2 hours and it turned out great.

THIS IS A GREAT basic recipe. I followed recipe and added some of my favorite ingredients. Sprayed cooker with veg. oil,( makes for easier clean-up)then added frozen chicken. In skillet with olive oil sauted onions, minced garlic pepper and sliced portabella mushrooms & added a splash of dry red wine..Meanwhile mixed spaghetti sauce with small can of tomato paste and a can of Hunts fire roasted diced tomatoes with garlic. Added fresh basil, oregano, parsley and 1Tablespoon McCormick's Tuscan Italian Seasoning. Added to crock and cooked on low for 5 hrs. Chicken was VERY tender and not a bit dried out. Served over Rotini  whole wheat blend pasta. It's like Heaven for the taste buds. ENJOY

I invited over my parents and brother and prepared this dish for them. I followed the advice of others and added a 6oz. can of tomato paste. I also added roughly 34 oz. or so of spaghetti sauce (garlic and herb, and some tomato basil sauce) instead of 28 oz. Heavy on the oregano, parsley, basil and garlic. i didn't have a problem with the chicken being dry because i made sure it was all covered in the cooker. I cooked it on low for an hour, and high for 3 hours, and let it coast on low again for a remaining hour or so. it was a hit and there are lots of left overs which i'm very excited to eat!

Easy recipe but I did change it as it seems everyone else did too.  I mostly followed the suggestions of  KMILTI and it came out very good.  I'd give her version 5 stars.

I fixed this the other day and would make a few suggestions foe any one considering making this dish.  First I believe six chicken breasts are too many for the one jar of sauce.  The biggest problem though is the chicken.  If you follow the recipe the chicken no longer has any texture to it and just kind of disolves in your mouth.  I think I would reduce the cooking time down to 4-5 hours depending on the chicken.  I will admit the sauce is good with the added ingredients.

Recipe was great. I did flour and saute the chicken before i placed it in the crockpot. It helped thicken the sauce as it cooked. I also added a few more spices and used my own sauce.  The basics are great!!

My husband told me he HATES crock pot cooking.  This was the first recipe I tried, and did not tell him it was cooked in a crock pot until after he was done raving about it!  Excellent served over spagetti!

I just wasn't crazy about this.  It was ok.  I might make it again, if I have all ingredients on hand and need an easy crock pot, weeknight meal, but I think it just lacked something.  I sauteed my veggies b/c I prefer them that way in most crock pot dishes...esp the onions.  Other than that, I made it just as directed, and it just needed a kick.  I added some salt/pepper, and cayenne....but it still just needed a bit of something else.  Not bad, just felt like it was missing something.

I made this with bone in skinless ckn thighs & my own home made sauce. I added the green pepper about 1 hour before the dish was done.  Served with garlic bread & a tossed green salad.

This was a HIT! Followed the recipe to almost a tee; I only had four chicken breasts, and I did season and brown them before putting them in the slow-cooker. For the amount of wonderful sauce this makes I wish I'd had the six breasts the recipe calls for. It was extremely flavorful, not mushy at all, and quite easy to prepare. This will be made again!

So easy. Happened to have all the ingredients too. Could use a little more garlic and to kick up the flavor, perhaps some red pepper flakes or a couple peppers cooking in. But overall a good dish.

My 4 yo daughter and Hubby LOVED this!  First let me say - if you are any sort of a cook, this won't be bland as you'd know you would add your own spices to your liking.  That being said - I used a plain Trader Joes sauce with no flavoring.  I added salt and pepper to my chicken breasts and rubbed it in before putting them in the crock pot.  Then I added all ingredients (except I used sweet red bell peppers... makes a HUGE difference) PLUS italian seasoning, garlic powder, chili pepper flakes.  5 hours later when it was done, I took out the chicken breasts, shredded them (SO easy) and put them back.  I added some green olive juice (I didnt have enough olives to put in but wanted the flavor) and let it cook another half hour.  It was delicious!  Served over ziti. It was just like piccata I have eaten out.  I dont think I have ever had it with a huge chunk of chicken.  The shredding made it easy for my daughter to eat and got the flavor into the chicken peices. Thank you for the healthy recipe!

I used Newman's Sockarooni spaghetti sauce and red peppers. This was quite bland. If I'd thought about it beforehand, I might have played with it a little. I was busy today and just didn't get to it. My husband and oldest boy liked this, I thought it was okay with fresh parmesan. I doubt I'd make this again.

After reading the reviews I was worried that the sauce would be too liquidy, but I used a bottle of Vodka pasta sauce (all I had in the pantry), which was a little thicker and the crock pot switched down to warm after cooking for 9 hours on low - which may have helped thicken it too. It was GREAT. I also didn't have mushrooms but did have a can of artichoke bottoms - which were fabulous! I think next time I will add some capers too!

I really loved this recipe.  Simple and delicious and a real crowd pleaser.

I followed the recipe as written The only modification was an additional 3/4 of a can of tomato paste and I threw in 2 boneless skinless chicken thighs because they were available. The bottled sauce I used was 'Newman's Own'.  I made it on the weekend so I ended the cooking time at 6 hours and left it at 'warm' for the other 2 hours until the gang arrived.  I served it with Penne pasta (plenty of Parmesan over both the chicken and the noodles), salad, and wine.  

It fed 5 hungry men and no complaints -  Just a lot of eating. Believe me I would have heard about it if the food had been bad.

Good recipe.  The sauce was a little too runny though.  I might add a small can of tomato paste next time.  UPDATE: I made this again adding a small can of tomato paste and a couple shakes of Penzey's pasta sprinkle.  This was definitely an improvement, though it is still lacking something.  Perhaps this would be better with a combination of white and dark meat chicken.

Excellent-Only change I used Chicken thighs (bone in) removed skin.  Seasoned thighs with garlic and onion powder to taste then browned thighs in virgin olive oil, about three minutes each side. Then added to crock.
I had extra time so I used home made sauce.
Chicken fell off the bone.

This was a good slow-cooker recipe.  I added a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes with the juice and 1 Tbs. Italian seasoning....otherwise the recipe was fine.  Yesm the sauce was thinner than direct from a jar, but it still stayed with the pasta just fine.  A tasty recipe to come home to.

I thought this was very tasty and, like most slow-cooker recipes, very simple.  The chicken was so tender and moist you could cut it with a fork, and the flavor was excellent.  I appreciate the purist tendencies of the other posters as I tend to be one regarding baking, but to my mind this is a fine and expedient alternative to the traditional cacciatore preparation.

Very easy and very good. Just don't cook longer than 4 hours on low or the chicken will be like shoe leather.

Used 7 Drumsticks, 1/2 lb Fresh sliced Mushrooms and 1/2 sliced Onion, 1/2 minced Garlic.   All of the Above veggies and mushrooms I sauteed prior to putting into Pot. The rest of Fresh minced Garlic (1/2 clove) I added to the Sauce.    I Covered chicken with ALL THE LIQUID completely, by about 1/4 " above it, not more-to prevent THE  watery sauce afterward.   I only used Pasta sauce-16.5 oz and 1/3 cup of Chicken broth for liquid.  The Resulting sauce was very Tasty and great density !  But the Chicken itself was ALMOST TASTELESS. Next day, it tasted better, though.  When I Make it NEXT TIME,  I WILL SALT THE RAW CHICKEN PIECES PRIOR TO PUTTING THEM INTO THE CROCK POT, for about 30 min. I do the same, when making chicken broth.

Another thing I ALTERED, Was the TEMPERATURE REGIME:  FIRST I COOKED MY DRUMSTICKS ON HIGH FOR 1.5 HRS  and then- on SLOW for 2.5 HRS instead of 7 hrs.

I didn't use  green peppers.  With buttered Da Vinchi Spaghetti it was very good.

Thank you.

Delicious and easy.  Picky husband enjoyed.  I had chicken legs that were chewy when grilled and didn't know what to do with remaining as it was too much for one meal.  Placed legs on bottom of crockpot and added a couple boneless breasts cut into thick pieces.  I realized I was out of sauce so I used a 14.5 oz. diced tomatoes and small can of tomato paste (based on other recommendations). Not too watery at all.   Used frozen diced bell peppers and the other ingredients in recipe.  I also added Italian seasoning, basil, oregano, black pepper as well as the minced garlic.  You can use any seasoning you like.  I added a little crushed red pepper to mine as I like things spicy but family does not. Tender meat fell off the bone.  Served over pasta.

This is a good basic recipe.  The addition of crushed red pepper flakes will give it a little more zing.  I also add white wine to my recipe.  For the people stating that it was watery, it could be because of adding the chicken frozen..it tends to produce water as it thaws!  I usually cut up my boneless chicken, season it with salt and pepper and saute it quickly, (I do not completely cook it) to just sear the outside and then add to the crockpot!

I thought this was a little bland. I added more garlic, onions and Italian seasoning, also I like it with bone in chicken pieces and I brown them first,then add to the crockpot. It also needed tomato paste. Mine was done in 7 hours and it was Great! Love the slow cooker method, so easy and we are having a heat wave this week in Eastern Pa. so this worked for me! Thank you for the recipe.

I used this as a guideline for what I had on hand and it was perfect! I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs (2-3 lbs), most of a 32 oz jar of spaghetti sauce, a can of diced tomatoes, 2 small cans of mushroom pieces, some Italian seasoning, garlic powder and about 1/4 c dried onion. Soooo good!

I thought this was just okay. I've never made the "real thing", but I'd imagine it's a lot more complicated and this is a simple, quick version of it.  I made it exactly as written (couldn't find a 28-oz. jar of pasta sauce, so measured it out from a 45-oz. jar). I cooked it for the full 9 hours, and the sauce came out fairly watery (a common hazard of slow-cooking, I find). I served it over angel-hair pasta, as suggested. It lasted me for six meals. It's easy and fairly healthy, I guess, but it just wasn't all that impressive. I think that a thicker sauce and varied chicken pieces (instead of just 6 breast halves) might have made it better.

This tasted good but I was really disappointed the sauce was 'watery'. I didn't read reviews prior to making this, I usually don't. I only used 4 breasts and used a 5 qt crockpot which was very full. I didn't have spaghetti so I used fettucine instead. Will try again but will have to do something to make the sauce thicker.

Really flavorful for how easy it was. Added basil, crushed red pepper, and onion powder. Used 3 cloves garlic. We really enjoyed the sauce, and can use the leftovers for so much more.

I altered this quite a bit in the meat and tomato department, but I think the original recipe would be great also. I am not a fan of boneless/skinless breasts or jarred sauce, so I used chicken leg quarters and made my own tomato sauce with a large can of crushed, large can of diced, a can of tomato sauce and a small can of paste. I seasoned the sauce with about 3 Tbs of Italian seasoning, some fresh basil, sea salt and fresh cracked pepper. I mixed the sauce in a seperate bowl before pouring it over the chicken in the crockpot.  I also browned the quarters in a bit of oil before placing them in the crockpot, and then sauteed a diced med. onion in the drippings before adding it to the sauce. I used 5 quarters, and had plenty of sauce to cover them fully. Simmered on low for 8 hours, and the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender and juicy, and the sauce was great. I let the kids pick the pasta, and they choose tri-color spirals, which worked great, albeit not very Italian... I will make this again.

EASY!  This is a fabulous recipe!  Not sure why it has 4 stars..Cacciatore tradtionally takes a lot of time and this is a beautiful weeknight/slow cooker shortcut...served over rice, pasta or even a toasted italian or french loaf, like an open faced sandwhich, yummy!  we loved it!

This recipe is amazing!! I did a few modifications-I left out the mushrooms cause I don't like them, I added crushed red pepper, garlic powder in place of the minced, seasoning salt, onions, and onion powder. I also shredded up the chicken when it was done so with every bite of sauce I had chicken. Delish!! :)

This was pretty good. I felt like the green peppers were overwhelming, but that's a personal thing. I threw frozen seasoned chicken breasts, as well as frozen chopped onions and peppers in the crockpot.  I played with the seasonings to what we prefer, definitely easy to prepare and great to eat.

This is good, and smells great. It didn't wow me though but I think with some tweaks it could. I would absolutely use bone-in chicken though, versus the boneless breasts.

Very nice...very simple.  I did, however, make a few changes.  I cut the chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces, and added kosher salt, pepper, and some dried sweet basil, marjoram and parsely.  The dish was done after cooking about 6 1/2 hours on Low.  The chicken was extremely tender and juicy.  Thanks for a nice, basic recipe.

This was the first time I've ever made chicken in the slow cooker and it turned out amazing.  I did have to make some substitutions due to lack of ingredients.  I used 1 can tomato sauce and 1 can diced tomatoes in place of the spaghetti sauce.  I also served it over rice - fantastic!  Will definitely make again although next time I'll take another reviewer's suggestion to use tomato paste to thicken the sauce.

We really loved this chicken! I used bone-in chicken thighs and removed the skin. I also added a small can of tomato paste to the sauce, as others have suggested and it thickened up beautifully. It cooked for about 7 hours (on low) and was perfectly moist and tender. I served it with mashed potatoes and a salad. Hubby said he could eat this once a week...I wouldn't go that far,lol, but it will definately be in our rotation! Thanks for posting. :)

It lacked a bit and I think it was missing some thing maybe spices. Plain speghetti sauce just didnt do it. I should have went with my instinct and use half speg sauce half tomato then add my own spices, which cuts down on sodium anyhow. Next time will add spices and more oinion. Also kinda runny to put over speg noodles. Too long of a cook time had to mix it with rotini noodles. Overall a good base recipe but needs some adjustment to make it spectacular.

Nope, not for me!  I followed the recipe exactly without the mushrooms since I didn't have any.  The flavor wasn't there at all.  It could be that I don't like the way the chicken cooks in the crockpot.

OK I don't understand why anyone would rate this less than 5 stars unless they screwed it up, because it is wonderful. I did make some modifications. I don't like white meat, so I use dark mean (skinless-legs and thighs) and cut 2 peppers down to one large pepper.

Just made this tonight for my boyfriend and his friend who came in from Ohio and all 3 of us gave it 5 stars, with a few adjustments like so many others have made.  My package of chicken breasts came with 7 so I used them all.  I added 1 can of diced tomatoes, 1 can of tomato paste and used oregano, basil and garlic powder.  I cooked it on high for 1 hour and then 4 hours on low and it was so tender!  The chicken just fell apart when I tried to take it out of the sauce.  This is definitely a keeper!

This was bland, and I'm pretty good at adding enough salt to new recipes.  The texture of the chicken wasn't quite right either.

We love this I always make a big batch and send some home for my Mom and Dad who also love it. I use extra Mushrooms and no Bell Pepper but add Zuchini half way through the cooking. It's wonderful

I now have a Day 2 use for this recipe, We use it to make calzones the next day just using refrigerated pizza dough. Roll it out with some flour stuff with the left over chicken add some cheese and other extras you like. Seal and brush with egg wash. Bake 350 for 25-35 min.

This recipe was SO easy and very tasty. I used a jar of Ragu Light and, as a result, I didn't need to season it up too much. It already had lots of flavor. I used chicken breasts and put them on the bottom of the slow cooker. I layered the peppers, onions and mushrooms on top of the chicken and dumped the sauce on top if it all. 7 hours later the chicken was TENDER and the house smelled great!

Made this for my husband, who loves chicken cacciatore.  He loved it, but I thought the chicken was dry.  Next time I will cook for five hours instead of seven.  Also added tomato paste to thicken the sauce and it was still on the thin side.  Will definitely make again.

Needs some retooling...I don't care for green peppers, so I made some variations. 

I dredged the chicken in whole wheat flour, browned in a good olive oil, then put it in the slow cooker with a good bottled pasta sauce, minced purple onion and lots of garlic, pepper flakes, basil and oregano,and some sea salt and fresh cracked pepper.  When cooked on low for 5 to 6 hours, no additional liquid is needed-- this turned out just right, very juicy and tender, with a nice hearty sauce. I served it with whole wheat rigatoni, some fresh grated parmesean and a salad...even my 3 year old loved it! Mess around with this one, it's a keeper.

This is a great recipe for a busy weeknight.  Just cook some pasta when you get home and you've got dinner.  I only used 4 chicken breasts for this one, but we like a lot of sauce.

Very very tasty - not to mention insanely easy to make.  The chicken was SO tender, and stayed that way even after a few days in the fridge.  The leftovers heated up beautifully.  This is a definite keeper for us.

I actually made this 3 months ago and loved it, I forgot to put in my review until I made it again the other night. It is one of the tastiest and easiest cacciatore recipes I have found. My kids love it and there is never left overs, mostly if I have chicken legs in the pot.  I also add a can of olives since my kids love them so much.  And I love the fact I can come home from work and know that dinner is just about done, all I have to do is cook some noodles and make a salad.

This was so easy to prepare and the chicken came out so moist and tender. I would have given it 5 stars, however the sauce was a little bland. I added some italian seasonings but it was still lacking something. Next time I may add additional seasonings earlier and perhaps a bit a red wine.

Skipped the green pepper and mushrooms; added 3tbsp capers and about 1/2cup white wine. Lightly seasoned chicken w/ salt and pepper and quickly browned in a skillet before adding to crockpot. Good and easy.

This was very easy to put together, and I served it with angel hair as sugggested. I also made some homeade garlic bread. I didn't use jarred spaghetti sauce either. I used homeade. But all in all this really had no flavor. I am not really sure what it lacks. The chicken had no flavor whatsoever. I added a ton of salt to my plate. The kids only ate the pasta. Probably won't make again.

This made the house smell so wonderfull with all the onions and garlic slow cooking in the pot.  My dog was losing his mind.  I thought this was a great dish considering how easy it was to make.  Husband liked the sandwich I made the next day with it, topped the chicken and sauce with melted provolone cheese, used fresh sourdough bread. Great.

Very tasty! I substituted a red pepper for one of the green, and it was very good. My only suggestion is to add more liquid, otherwise it got a little dry.I added about a cup of water to the mixture, and it was fine.

I made this when I was visiting relatives.  We had minimal supplies on hand, so was glad it didn't require a lot of ingredients.  Made it with red peppers because that's all I had.  Cooked it for about 5 hours and it turned out wonderful.  Served it over pasta for a delicious meal.

As per suggestions, I cut the chicken breasts (into strips, not cubes,)added tomato paste and Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes. 
 I put sliced zucchini and onion on the bottom,then the chicken,followed by the sauce(premixed w/garlic and seasoning.)I added the peppers and mushrooms about 1 hour before serving.
 My boyfriend really liked it; while I thought the flavor was good, I thought it was too thin. BUT I loved that we had a tasty meal 
(made even better w/cheesy garlic bread!)from the crock pot--no oven and no grill during a HOT, HOT, summer!

Fantastic recipe, and you'd never know how healthy it is! I diced up the bell peppers and onion really finely, because my other half swears he doesn't like either, and they disappeared into the sauce just like I planned - and the other half went back for seconds! Of course, I made a few teeny modifications: I only had two large-ish chicken breasts on hand so that's what I used, but I shredded them into the sauce to stretch them a little further and nobody was the wiser. To keep this recipe from being too similar to another dish I make regularly, I substituted the spaghetti sauce for tomato puree (I dumped a 28oz can of stewed tomatoes into my food processor) and added half a can of tomato paste. I also added a healthy amount of basil, oregano, kosher salt and cracked pepper. I'll be making this again, if for no other reason than to keep sneaking vegetables into our food!

It was good, but I probably won't go out of my way to make it again.  It needed a little more flavor...

Amazing! I did the recipe as is, only added some spices. I used frozen chicken breast. I've done it twice already and it is succulent, the chicken is so tender. I have a slow cooker but I hadn't used it in years. I work from home a lot so I can  drop the ingredients in the AM and it's ready in 7 hours! Love this recipe.

I am giving this 4 stars since I couldn't make this to  letter.  I had to sustitute canned tomatoes and stewed tomatoes for the spaghetti sauce.  I also left out the mushrooms and green peppers since my hubby isn't a big mushroom and pepper fan.  I did put my skinless, boneless chicken in the crockpot straight from the freezer.  My chicken was cooked to proper temperature after 7 hours on low, and 2 hours on warm.  (My son put the crockpot on warm, per my instructions when he arrived home from school.) The chicken was tender, but not mushy.  I walked in the door after work and the house smelled like heaven!  We served this over egg noodles, with a fresh garden salad, and italian bread. Great meal for a workday.  Thank you for sharing.

I've wanted to make this dish for a long time and was pleased when I found this recipe. I also deeply appreciated the comments/advice from reviewers. It's not authentic at all, but it's a really tasty dish that's super easy to prepare. I followed the suggestions of those who said put the chicken in frozen. Good call!  Came out juicy, tender and perfect. When making the dish, be careful which spaghetti sauce you use. Because it's the base, it becomes the dominant flavor. We liked the dish a lot, but next time I think I'll try canned diced or crushed tomatoes and add wine and seasoning myself. May make it taste more authentic and less like jarred sauce with chicken.  It's a great foundation of a recipe from which to customize the dish.

The flavor of this dish is dependent upon the quality of the spaghetti sauce you choose. Add some sliced green olives for a tasty twist.

Loved it, used skinless legs and thighs.  After about 5 hrs I pulled out the chicken and took the meat off the bones and put it back in the sauce.  I made a roux out of about a 1/2cup of Merlot wine and about 2 TBS  of
Corn starch, stirred it in with sauce and cooked uncovered for about another hour.  It was perfect.  Served it over spaghetti and sprinkled with chopped green onions, with a salad and some artisan rosemary bread.

Loved this dish. I made it ahead of time and put it in the freezer until I was ready to cook it. It cooked beautifully. It was sooo easy to prepare. 
My husband accused me of slaving in the kitchen!! He doesn't know the simplicity of it all!

Great starter recipe.  I had to make modifications based on my crockpot and chicken breasts.  I have a large crockpot and only had 1 lb of partially frozen boneless, skinless chicken.  This means less cooking time. I used about 1.5 jars of sauce because I like a lot of extra sauce.   added a few splashes of red wine and some basil.

My chicken reached 160 degrees in 3 hours.  I shredded the chicken and threw it back in the pot on warm, for another hour and it was great.

No flavor. Couldn't tell a green pepper from an onion. Overcooked! I will make it again on my stove top. The veggies will be crisp and tasty.

Sauce was very thin and didn't stick to the pasta, even with less sauce than it called for.  Flavor was only so-so.  I did use less onion and pepper to accommodate my family so I upped the garlic and added some basil.  Didn't matter.  Chicken turned out slightly stringy and dry.  Really not my favorite texture.  Will not have again unless I can figure out how to make it better.

This was very soupy. I read others' recommendations to add tomato paste, but unfortunately I had none in the cupboard. Luckily, I had an extra jar of spaghetti sauce and mixed that in. Quick prep time, so even though its not my favorite, this will go into rotation, but not without tomato paste next time!

As written, I think this recipe would be pretty bland.  I tweaked it a bit and it's perfect for a heat wave like we've been having, where the last thing I want to do is turn the oven on!  I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces.  I also cut up a package of sweet Italian sausage and tossed that in.  I left the mushrooms out because we don't eat them and I added a bay leaf and some cayenne pepper.  I am serving it over egg noodles.

After not loving it the first time, I used the kmilti review but added the whole pepper and a whole jar of spaghetti sauce (what would I do with the rest?). I like left over sauce and made garlic cheese biscuits to dip in it too. I also only had 2 frozen chicken breast but it worked just fine! Great stuff!

Great recipe!  I gave it 4 stars because I felt like I needed to add more garlic, salt, pepper, basil and oregano for flavor, but it's still such an easy meal and the chicken comes out nice and tender!  Thanks for sharing!

My husband loved this tonight and went back for 3rds.  I also made some homemade bread and this was excellent with the cassiatore.  I followed some of the other reviews and added frozen chicken, but they were tenders.  I also added chicken broth instead of wine.  I will be making this again.

Fantastic. I did a trial run last night for my Sunday dinner for 11. I did use the tomato paste as suggested and even took the lid off the cooker for the last hour. So-so good. I'll make this often.

I used the electric skillet with chicken thighs and added sliced red,yellow,orange sweet peppers. Also, added 1/2 c of white wine and Italian herb spices. I browned the chicken to take the fat off and served it over penne noodles then added the sauce over it. Fantastic! I had sauce left for dipping or bruschetta.

UPDATE: MADE THIS AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME I ONLY GARNISHED WITH BASIL, ADDED A CAN OF WELL-DRAINED ITALIAN-SEASONED TOMATOES (IN ADDITION TO THE CHANGES I MADE THE FIRST TIME AROUND) AND COOKED MY (UNFROZEN) CHICKEN ON HIGH FOR 3 HOURS. THIS SEEMS TO BE THE "SOFT SPOT" FOR MY CROCK POT. MY CHICKEN WAS TENDER, JUICY AND OH SO DELISH!!! Meh. I've had better (and more authentic to boot). With kmilti's suggestions for improvement, this has promise. As kmilti did, I too used frozen chicken breasts (only 2 of them since it was just for my fiance & I) and Newman's cabernet marinara with herbs sauce (could not find Classico), added a 6 oz. can of tomato paste, a LOT of fresh garlic, red pepper flakes, oregano, cracked black pepper and several (torn) basil leaves. My only deviation was omitting the mushrooms altogether (we HATE mushrooms!). When I got home from work, my house smelled divine, but to my dismay, this didn't meet my expectations at all. For one, while the basil added nice flavor, I think it would have been better if used as garnish or dropped in the slow cooker right before serving (it was very yucky looking, but what do you expect after it cooked all day???). Second, I prefer to cut my peppers into strips as opposed to chopping them (which I did with excellent results - so I claim all the kudos for that!) Served over bowtie pasta with crusty French bread on the side. I don't think this will be a repeat with me, but thanks for sharing, Rosie. :-)

I made this as written. It had no flavor at all and was very runny. Also way too long to be cooking the peppers and mushrooms. Will  not be making this again.

I do add a can of tomato paste to thicken up the sauce a bit and also add some ground oregano.  I don't like bell pepper so I skip those.  Also I put some Italian cheese mix or mozzarella cheese on top once dished out onto plates.

This was really good. I finally made it after about a year and a half finding this.   I made it according to the recipe directions, and the only thing I will change next time is to serve it over fettucine, as my family didn't like the angel hair pasta - it was too thin for the meat.  Make this recipe - you will love it!

We really like this, I make it at least every other week (: I add a can of tomato paste, and some minced garlic (I tend to add garlic to everything)! The tomato paste really helps to thicken the sauce just enough,

Really easy to make... I used sweet banana peppers, instead of green pepper.  I also rubbed italian seasoning and salt into the chicken breast before putting them in the pot.  Used a full jar of sauce but did add a small can of tomato paste.  Plenty of sauce for the pasta!

I went with reviews and halfed the spagetti sauce,added tomato paste, diced tomatoes and italain seasoning. I still had alot of sauce which was great with sausage in the slow cooker. Only put on low for about 3 1/2 hours and it was done. I would make again but only once every 4-6 months.(had with spinach)

This is the best!!  I tried "KMILTI"'s version under reviews and added 1/2 cup cabernet or burgundy wine.  It made it even more rich with greater deepth of flavor.

This is so easy and delicious!  I'm not sure why others found it to be bland, maybe it's the kind of sauce they used, but I also added some oregano and basil, as I always do when using jarred sauces. I also added a small can of tomato paste to the sauce in the beginning.  I used frozen chicken breasts(4), and it took 4 hours on low in my crockpot.  The chicken was done perfectly and the veggies were cooked as well.  I will make this regularly.

very easy and good... to watery for my taste, next time I'll add some tomato paste to thicken and use dehidrated onions, also I will use thin chicken tenders instead of the large thick chicken breasts I normaly have, the thicker meat was blanf, the thinner parts was tasty.

Thought this was just ok. I started with frozen chicken tenders and was sure to cover them with sauce to prevent them from drying out. During the last hour I added frozen corn and a can of black beans. Served over brown rice.

This is very tasty. I think I overcooked the chicken, so it was a little dry and had a weird texture, but it still tasted good. Definitely use a good quality marinara. I just used a cheapie sauce and wished I had used something with better flavor. I would make this again!

Honestly, I didn't care for this.  My sauce came out with a really wierd flavor, and that put me off to this recipe -- I just couldn't get beyond it to try and taste the positives in the recipe.  I love my mom's cacciatore, so I was looking for a quick and easy way to make it, but this just didn't work for me.  We had lots of leftover sauce that sat in the fridge for over a week.  I don't plan on making it again.

I only used 1 frozen chicken breast and broke it apart after a couple hours.  I also added a number of ingredients (fresh herbs, tomato paste, garlic, chopped asparagus, spinach, crushed red peppers).  Definitely was good for as easy as it was!

Very good and so easy!  Put it in the crockpot before leaving for work and when I get home it is ready . . . love that!  I made a couple changes . . . instead of green pepper I added red pepper (only one) and added jared mushrooms because I did not have fresh mushrooms.  My family likes lots of sauce, so I think next time I will add another jar of sauce.

Cacciatore doesn't have white sauce!  This is a bood basic recipe but I added canned tomatoes because I like the texture.  For the person who said the sauce was too thick, maybe it was cooked on high, if you cook on low and add more liquid you'll have a soupy mess.

Good. Bf really liked it. I was disappointed in the sauce, which was very watery. I read the reviews, but it's been a while and I forgot. If I make it again, I'll follow another reviewer's suggestions to make it thicker.

I have to admit...I doctored the recipe as well, adding canned diced tomatoes, crushed red pepper flakes, Italian seasoning, and extra garlic.  I used a jarred Marinara sauce (on sale this week!), and serves it over Basmati rice.  It was delicious!  The chicken was nice and moist, the veggies done well, and since I'm not a mushroom fan...they were easy to pick out!  I will definitely make  this again!

this recipe was ok... Needs a little something.  Maybe salt?  I definately added it after it cooked. I served this with whole wheat pasta.  Maybe something rich like mashed potatoes would be better.  I'll make this again because it is so easy.  Did I mention I used frozen bell pepper and onion mix?  So you can imagine how easy this was... no chopping!

My family loved this, but I agree with other reviewers. It is a good basic recipe. I added 1 can of Italian styled diced tomatoes, Italian seasoning, and 4 oz. Tomato Paste. The recipe came out great! I would recommend cooking on low for 5-6 hours and serving over rice.

This was great!  My husband loved it and asked for it the following week.  Because of the chicken dryness comments, I used chicken thighs.  I also left the lid off of the crock pot the last hour to allow some evaporation of liquids and it was nice and thick.

My mother is very ill and can not cook for my dad any longer.  I was able to stop by the house while they were at the doctor put all of it in the crock pot and when they were ready dad boiled some spaghetti and mom ate more than she has in weeks.  THANK YOU!!

My sauce came out pretty thin even though I turned up the heat to high for the last couple hours.  Otherwise, the sauce had a nice flavor and the chicken was wonderfully tender. I served this over spinach fettucine and the kids gobbled it up.  Thanks!

To all the very busy people reading this, please make this you will be very happy you did. It took me no time and it was wonderful. I omitted the mushrooms and forgot the garlic, (the dog had to go for a walk) and it was still terrific. For those who have to make things for people that have a chewing problem this is wonderful. It just falls apart.

I have made this for work and am always asked for the recipe.  It's easy to make. As others recommended I added the mushrooms an hour before the end and also used thighs and breasts in order to get the flavor from the bones.  Melt cheese on top, and yum, really good.

So simple, the night before, I browned the chicken and put it in the crock pot, and Sunday morning, before going to church, I added the rest of the ingredients, and cooked it on low, and came home to the smells of a great meal!
The green peppers and mushrooms added something special to the sauce, I did add extra basil and italian seasoning to the sauce before cooking.  Great with a side of spaghetti and garlic bread.  Will make again.  Thanks!

Maybe it was my selection of sauce, but it tasted very bland.  It needs spices or something.  My family doesn't want me to make it again.

Very good!  I used chicken legs, that's all I had, added some Italian seasoning, tomato paste & extra garlic.  I also used canned mushrooms, I didn't have fresh -- and it was deeeeelish!   Thank you!

I made this for a dinner party and while it was easy to make it was pretty tasteless.  I would definitely suggest adding salt and pepper and more spices.  I also liked the idea given in another review of adding wine and tomato paste to thicken the sauce.  With a few alterations this could be a good recipe.

This was a good recipe, but I think the flavor of green peppers was a bit too strong. Next time will use red peppers.

Very good and easy! We really enjoyed this meal.  I was a little puzzled about the end result's flavor as I tripled the garlic called for; generously added Wildtree Herbs' Spagetti Sauce Seasonings; added a few dashes of crushed red pepper; added 1 can of tomoto paste; 1 can diced tomatoes; 1 small can tomato sauce; about 3/4 C. red wine...Despite the flavorful additions, it was more mildly flavored than I'd hoped.  I know the crock-pot mellows things, but it was remarkable how much.  It was very delicious...my 7 yr. old son went nuts over it.  Shredded chicken breasts in sauce over angel hair pasta with grated parmesan cheese and fresh ground peppercorns.  Will definitely do again, but I might add a couple of links of hot Italian Chicken Sausage to the crock at the beginning to boost the flavor.  I can't wait to reheat leftovers for lunch.  Thanks!

This recipe is a good family feeder, but not gourmet. I followed some other review suggestions. I added one can tomato paste, a can of diced tomatoes, and more garlic. For all my italian dishes, I add a generous amount of Tone's Spicy Spaghetti Seasoning from Sam's Club. It is wonderful. I used boneless chicken breasts. The meat was amazingly tender, just bland and flavorless. I could have used one more can of tomato sauce due to the diced tomatoes. We served it over angel hair pasta. I'll make it again becuase it is good and filling.

i love using my crock pot & enjoy the taste of slow cooked foods. this cacciatore recipe is good, the only changes i made (from reviewer recommendation) were to use frozen chicken breasts, add a can of tomato paste & a small amount of italian seasoning. my chicken stayed moist & was done in 7 hours plus the sauce was thick enough to serve over spaghetti. thanks rosie!

I loved this recipe! I didn't take everyone elses advice on adding tomato paste, and I should have, but it was still fantastic. I took out the chicken with tongs, to thicken the sauce a little, and it simply fell apart. I always have trouble with the times on my slow cooker, so check every so often. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This recipe was delicious...and so easy to prepare.  I added extra onions and peppers (red and green)along with fresh basil, rosemary and thyme. I also seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, paprika and parsley before adding the other ingredients.  The sauce was just the right consistency to serve with angel hair pasta.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Amazing! The chicken fell right off the bone! I used 2 chicken legs, 1 chopped up green pepper, 4 oz chopped up mushrooms, 1 can of tomato sauce and 1/2 onion. Also put a pinch of oregano, basil and garlic powder. Delicious served on egg noodles! My husband rated this a 10 out of a 5 :-)
Thanks for sharing!

What an amazing meal!!  The only thing I changed was omitting the mushrooms (I didn't have any) and adding some Italian seasonings.  The chicken just fell apart and had a great flavor.  I served it over plain fettucine.  My husband raved and raved.  It was delicious as leftovers the next day too!

I also added diced carrot and celery to the recipe. After cooking, I removed the chicken breasts and sliced them into bite-sized pieces, returned it to the pot and mixed it in.  I cooked it on high for three-and-a-half hours. My family loved it.

This recipe was relatively easy to make, but overrall, it was not that good.  I found the recipe quite tasteless, and I even added more spices, etc.  It would not be a recipe I would make again.  The chicken was tasteless, the sauce was just okay.  I would not recommend.

I just threw everything in the pot the night before, the chicken breasts were still frozen!  I added about 3/4 cup red wine since I was worried about it losing too much liquid but it didn't. It would have been fine without the added liquid.  We loved this over radiatore pasta, the chicken broke apart into chunks and made 2 chicken breast seem like alot more plus it absorbed the flavor even more.  Loved this!

This recipe is so simple and the results are delicious.  I only used one bell pepper and cut the chicken into chunks before adding it to the slow cooker since my young children would be eating it.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours (I got a late start) and it still came out very moist and tasty. My husband loved it. This will be a regular selection on our dinner menu.

This recipe does not have a lot of flavor. If I make it again, I will add more Italian spices.

This was really good and so easy.  I made it with what I had on hand and hubs had seconds (and a bite or two) before I could put it away.  Will make this again.

I don't use my slow cooker as much as I should so I looked for a recipe with chicken and found this. I had to substitute boneless thighs (what I had) but no other changes. Easy and very flavorful. Served with penne.

Easy to prepare. Chicken was very tender. I added crushed red pepper. We like a little heat added to the taste.

I made this because of the great time saver of not having to brown the meat first.  I was sadly disappointed as although the meat was cooked it had a strange consistency.  Also, I missed having more veggie additions...green/red peppers, mushrooms....I know I could have added them but when I try a new recipe I like to follow it to the letter.

This cacciatore is tasty if not spectacular. I was looking for an easy, chicken, slow-cooker recipe and this certainly fits that bill. I've made it twice with good results both times. Mine ended up a little watery, thinning down the spaghetti sauce more than I care for. My husband won't eat mushrooms so I left those out. That may make a difference in the amount of liquid, I don't know. But I'm no chef and it tasted good so I'm grateful for the recipe!

It was OK. The sauce was very runny and the breasts were almost dried. We had plenty of left overs.  May try again adding some tomato paste to thicken things up.

Very good. As suggested by other reviewers, I used frozen chicken breasts and a can of tomato paste (next time I might use two cans) in addition to the pasta sauce.

Needs additional spices as others have pointed out but its a great base. In my house growing up, cacciatore was not made using jarred spaghetti sauce. Sauce was made using diced tomatoes, wine, etc. It is supposed to be on the thinner side, not thick like jarred sauce. Also, my dad used a more flavorful cut of chicken such as boneless skinless thighs. :-)

I broil the chicken first to get rid of the fat and make it taste better. I use only red peppers because they are sweeter. I use tyme and parsley and garlic for flavor and I use homemade marinara sauce. No preserves in it so healthier. A big difference in flavor and healthier!

Turned out really well. I felt it was a little too runny but likely my fault as I used frozen onions which likely added water. I added a can of tomato paste and it thickened up some. Great taste and definitely make it again.

I love this recipe because it is simple and yummy. I put the chicken in frozen; it makes it super tender. And I add onions with the peppers and mushrooms. It's great for a weeknight dinner that's ready when I get home.

Plan to make this again. With a few adjustments I think this could turn into a family favorite. I used only 3 chicken breasts and also added a small can of tomato paste as others recommended. In addition to the original recipe I added 1/4 tsp black pepper, 2 tsp oregano, some basil, majoram, and bay. Over all we enjoyed it but felt it was missing some key ingredients to add more flavor. I will make it again but add red and yellow pepper and maybe wine. I think tomato paste with herbs would work better too. We like our food to have bold flavor so going to have to make a few adjustments.

No issues.  Used some tomato paste but ended up adding wine to make it watery.  Very flavorful, but I did use a good jarred sauce.

I loved everything about this recipe.  Made it pretty much as written except I tossed in the full jar of Marinara and also added red bell pepper in addition to the green.  Also, using smaller, fresh, boneless chicken breasts, it only needed to cook 4 hours.  It really is the perfect crockpot recipe; easy, little prep, big results, and the house smells awesome.

Super good, but I admittedly made a lot of changes based on suggestions. I added a can of spiced diced tomatoes, a small can of tomato paste, 2 tsp of Trader Joes 21 spice salute, 1/4 cup red wine, and only one bell pepper. I also added a few ripped up leaves of fresh basil during the last half hour. I shredded the chicken after 8 hours, since that makes it easier to portion and freeze. I think next time I will add more mushrooms and another pepper, and leave out one of the chicken breasts.

I really enjoyed this. It was very flavorful. I followed the directions and didn't change anything. I served it over angel hair pasta. We had leftovers and I mixed the pasta and sauce together, put in a casserole dish, topped with cheddar cheese and froze. I think we enjoyed the dish the second time, just as much.

Good recipe when you have spaghetti sauce and chicken breasts on hand and don't have much time to get dinner cooked the next day.   I only added one green pepper and should have added two as the recipe calls for.

This recipe was super easy to prepare but was watery, even with the addition of a 6 oz. tin of tomato sauce.  It also needed to be spiced up - perhaps oregano and basil.  With a little tweaking this will be a fantastic meal for the busy cook.

I tried this just this weekend.  I had to work all day and was looking for something fabulous that would be done by the time i got home.  This recipe is a home run.  I made it very close to the recipe, although I added more garlic and less mushrooms.( baby bella's.)   I used a Ragu Robusto sauce and I added about a 1/4 cup of wine. I find that frozen chicken breast work well in the crock pot. I used four. 
 According to my husband, it cooked nicely and smelled up the house something wonderful.  I asked that he stir it a bit around hour 4 or so.  When it was done, I noticed it was a tad runny. (maybe the wine?)  I think a thicker sauce would have been better.   Because of the consistancy i decided to serve it over some garlic butter rice instead of pasta.   Everyone loved it.  I will definitely make again.  Next time i'll try a thicker sauce and pair with pasta.

Very good. I had some extra green peppers, so I decided to give this a try and use them up. I used Prego three-cheese blend pasta sauce and added 1 TBS of oregano to the mix. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out very well. I served it over whole wheat spaghetti and my husband loved it. It's an easy dish to pull together and I'll definitely make it again.

This was good and I will make it again, but it will need some tweaking.  The biggest change I will make is to switch out the breasts for thighs.  I used big beautiful chicken breasts, and the were kind of wasted in this dish.  They didn't come out with any real flavor and they were kind of dry from cooking for 7 hours.  I think thighs would at least be more tender and not feel like such a waste because they are cheaper.  I think they are actually more traditional in cacciatore anyway.  Other than that, I agree with others that it was a little watery, so next time I will cut back on the spaghetti sauce and use a can of tomato paste as recommended.  I will also add more herbs (oregano, basil, pepper flakes, etc.) to kick up the flavor, and I will probably add a little red wine close to the end of cooking to add a little extra body.  I also think this needs more vegetables, so I will probably add some zucchini, eggplant, carrot, something, to make it more robust.  All in all, this is a nice slow cooker option that is great to dip into at the end of the day.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe for a Sunday dinner.  It was a huge hit.  My daughter came home from work just in time to sit down.  She remarked that the house smelled good.  I used Ragu Tomato and Onion sauce.  I was very surprised because I don't usually use jar sauce, but I know that Ragu is one of the better jarred sauces and it was delicious.  I will definitely be making this again.  I also raved about it to friends at work and they have asked for the recipe.  Sharing it today!!!!

This was pretty good and an easy meal to make for busy weeknights.  I just seasoned the chicken breast first with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning before I put it in the crock pot.

I usually do not like to criticize the recipes of others but this was a a waste of time.  The sauce is super bland (my husband is Italian) I added extra spice, but it tasted like chicken stew in red sauce.  I some of the reviews before I started, but we were disappointed :(

Really liked the ease of this recipe. It tasted good, but the flavor was missing something. I should have cooked for a little less time. Overall it is a good recipe and I will make it again with a few minor tweaks.

My family LOVED this recipe!  My 8 yr old son ate 5 (yes, FIVE) helpings so it's a keeper in my book!  I shredded the chicken breasts before serving and mixed them back into the sauce, then served over penne noodles, along with a salad and garlic bread.  Super easy meal and so good!

I got some great flavor out of this recipe, by using chicken thighs with the skin cut off and browned in a skillet. I made my own (easy) sauce by cutting up fresh tomatoes, garlic, and parsley, then adding sliced peppers and onions. I mixed a small can of tomato paste into the sauce, as well as some red pepper flakes and sliced black onions. In the slow cooker, I placed the chicken thighs first, followed by a layer of sliced fresh mushrooms, and dumped the sauce (chock full of fresh veggies) on top. Cooked it all on high for 4 hours. The meat fell off the bones, and it was super fresh tasting and yummy! My family loved it.

This was so quick and easy and smelled wonderful all day.  I used 4 frozen breasts. I added a can of tomato paste about half way through because it was a nit too runny. Turned out great.  Thought it was missing something - might try to spice it up more next time. I added about 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes - but that wasn't enough.

This just came out too bland for me.  I couldn't quite put my finger on what this was lacking.  I might try adding a few more spices (more garlic, some italian seasoning, and maybe a bay leaf or two).

I really really liked it and all the ingredients are things I usually have on hand. I added alot more seasonings (minced garlic, dried basil leaves, onion powder, and alot of oregano) and it came out delicious. The only reason why I didn't give it a 5 is because I didn't follow what other people said and shredded the chicken. My husband said that if the chicken was shredded it would have been better. I did do it with frozen chicken and let it cook for the 7 hours and the chicken pretty much shredded itself when it was done.  I will definately do this again.

Great recipe, if you add a can of tomato paste it is not as runny, plus i used more garlic and 3 tablespoons of italian seasoning and some parm cheese and its not as bland :)

I followed one reviewer's suggestion and cut down on the spaghetti sauce, adding 1/2 green and yellow bell peppers and using the spices suggested and it still was very bland and watery.  It definitely needs more spaghetti sauce.  Don't think'll be making this recipe again.

I'm giving this 4 stars since I found the recipe, chopped the veggies, dropped everything into the slowcooker within 15 minutes.  Super easy!  Cooked on high for 4.5 hours.  Came out pretty good for a last minute supper.  Chicken breast where rather dry, but there was plenty of sauce.  Served over brown rice.

I followed the recipe, with the exception that I used mushroom gravy mix instead of mushrooms (didn't have any).  I also think that I cooked it too long.  Regardless, to us it just tasted like chicken spaghetti.  Needs something else.  Maybe it will be better with other reviewers' modifications and starting with frozen chicken so it doesn't get so overcooked.

Very delicious. I did use frozen chicken breasts and just tossed them in the CrockPot with everything. By the time 8 hours went by, they were falling apart from being so tender. The sauce is great. I added a can of tomato paste to make it thicker but it was still pretty thin. I'll have to tweak something to get it just right. Overall, 2 thumbs up.

This was a really easy and yummy meal. I followed the recipe with a few changes. I added tomato paste as others recommended. I also used chicken thighs instead of chicken breast. I think next time I will add more herbs to add a little kick to the sauce. I will definately make this again.

After cooking for 7-8 hours, the chicken was falling apart & tender. I was hoping for something thicker, so poured into a pot on stove & cooked it down some(added cornstarch)...to no avail. I ended up adding the pasta-bowties-to the whole thing. Maybe using less sauce IS the trick.

This one really depends on what sauce you use, as that is what supplies a lot of the flavor. I use Classico Four Cheese pasta sauce, and I usually add a bit more garlic and some parmesan cheese.

It's alright.  I thought the chicken was a little dry and the sauce was too watery.  My wife loved it though so I guess this might be personal preferrence.

This recipe with the modification of extra herbs worked well, but I would also add 1/2 cup of kalamata olives and 1/2 cup of red wine.  Using a teaspoon of cornflour would thicken up the juice nicely.

I've never had chicken in the crock pot before because I thought it would be dry.  Boy was I wrong!  The chicken was so fork split tender.  I did follow advice of other readers and added tomato paste, basil, oregano & red pepper flakes.

This was so quick and easy and my family loved it! After reading all the reviews before I made it, I decided to make a couple changes to avoid the couple of negatives about this recipe.  So I added in (1) can diced Italian stewed tomatoes, used (3) chicken breasts rubbed with italian seasonings and seared until golden brown before adding to the crockpot.  Then I followed the recipe and this was delicious!

i liked this recipe much better than the top-rated chicken cacciatore recipe! here are a few simple changes that i made:
- use 2 pkgs of b/s thighs instead of b/s breasts
- add a can of diced tomatoes for extra juice
- add a can of whole black olives at the very end 
- serve w/a sprinkling of crushed red pepper and/or tabasco sauce

Sunday is slow cooker day in our house and I followed this recipe to the letter. Chicken ended up very dry and bland, veggies were under cooked. My husband didn't like it at all, which is rare since he tends to like everything! I'll be sticking to skillet chicken cacciatore.

This was GREAT, and SO fast to make!  I threw in 3 frozen chicken breasts (all I had), a 32oz jar of sauce, red bell pepper, and near the end, rehydrated mushrooms.  I also added calamata olives for a little zip. We ate all the chicken, so I froze the extra sauce for a later time. I will make this again and again.

The chicken was dry, the sauce was runny, and there wasn't very much flavor to it, even when I added some of my favorite spices and extra garlic.  We didn't even finish the leftovers.  It smells amazing, but just falls flat with taste.  Won't make this again.

Great quick meal idea. However, it needs some tweeking. Jar sause is too thick, so i added chicken stock, and added more italian spices. I decided to cut the chicken breasts into chunks to make it easier to serve.

We thought this had a little too much garlic. I also used some burgundy wine, and not sure if that made it taste funky, but we weren't that thrilled with how it tasted. We'll try this again, but will make a few changes.

I used Paul Newman's Sockarooni Pasta Sauce and it has peppers and mushrooms in it already.  I added the garlic and onions and cooked it for five hours.  I also added a small can of tomato paste, but, at the end I had to add a little bit of water because it was too thick.  I think it would have been just perfect without the paste.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it with a side of angel hair pasta.  Will definitely make again.  The people who needed extra spices must have used a very bland sauce.

This is a solid recipe, and very easy.  The chicken turned out very moist.  The sauce was a little too runny for my taste, so I added a can of tomato paste.

This is good! I didn't use a crock pot instead I cut the chicken in small pieces and cooked in the oven at 300 degrees for an hour. The chicken was very tender and flavorful!

This recipe is delicious!  The chicken breast was very tender and not dry.  What a great way to make a low fat dish that everyone can enjoy.  I will definitely make this again!

Smelled wonderful, but, quite bland (even with suggested modifications). That being said, I think a few trials of "a dab of this with a dab of that", it has a lot of potential. But right now I'm not experienced enough to know what it needs to really set it off.

Wonderful, I fixed this for a dinner party and everyone raved about it.  I traded the green bell peppers for 1 red and 1 yellow bell.  I also added 1/2 cup red wine to the mix.  When putting in the cooker I "lined" the bottom with thick sliced red onion, then the chicken, sauce and everything else. While cooking the aroma was to die for and when done the taste was simply delectable.  It's a keeper, for sure.

I prepared this for a large family dinner and everyone raved.  I decreased the green pepper to only one and used only 1/2 yellow onion.  I served with Angelhair pasta with marinated artichoke hearts and garlic.  Truly a grand slam hit!

A good recipe. Did come out runny as written.  My slow cooker tends to cook about 2 hrs faster then a normal one, even on low.  Added about 3x more garlic. Next time will try it with a bit less pasta sauce and use some tomato paste as suggested.

This recipe was just ok. It needed something ... I'd be fine with plain old Spaghetti Sauce(with hamburger) and Pasta. This didn't take very long but was too runny, even after adding the suggested 6 oz Tomato Paste. Maybe it will be better the second day, after having time to sit and thicken.

This is GOOD!  I forgot the mushrooms the first time, and didn't have mushrooms OR green peppers the second time and it was still delicious.  I start with frozen chicken tenders and only slowcook for 6 hours.

This is a great recipe.  I used a can of mushrooms, added tomato paste, and added extra seasonsings- garlic powder, oregano, and rosemary and it turned out great.  It was watery, but tasted great.  I will make again!

I followed a combo of the tips on this one and i loved it. I used diced chicken and added a ton of seasonings (italian, oregano, pepper, basil) and cooked in the crock pot for 1 hr. on low, 3 on high. I served it over spaghetti squash and had leftovers for 2 nights. Will def. be adding to the rotation.

I took everyone's suggestion and added a can of tomato paste, but wish I wouldn't have. It was very, very thick. Loved the ease of preparation and my husband really liked it. Added lots of spices, but thought it have more of a tang. I'll make again using the original recipe on one of those nights when I'm in a hurry. A good dinner over pasta with a salad and rolls, just not a 5-star "the best" in my opinion.

I added tomato paste and cooked on low just 7 hours as some other reviewers recommended, and this came out great.  Also, since my fiance is allergic to mushrooms, I used red peppers instead.  Served over angel hair pasta with garlic bread...this was easy and tasty!!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good.  Cooked in the crock pot for 8 hours on low and the chicken got dry for some reason.  Next time I'll only cook for 7.  Made the recipe exactly the way it's written.  Per other reviews, the sauce does get thin but then again I always thought that chicken cacciatore sauce was supposed to be thin.  Very easy to put together for us working folks.  Will make again.

Sorry - we did not care too much for this.   I added spices to the chicken and browned per the suggestion of others.  But I still thought it was just OK.  The meat did fall off the bones, which made a mess in the crockpot, yet the breasts were stilll dry.   I could see doing this in the oven so you can keep a closer eye on it.  Maybe I just don't like chicken in spaghetti sauce.  Either way, I probably won't make again.

Very easy recipe!  Great flavor.  Buy a good pasta sauce with lots of spices.  Most pasta jars are 24 oz. I bought two jars and used a small portion of the 2nd one to make 26 oz. Makes a lot of food if you have a small family.  Great for left overs!

This is a good easy recipe, I used 3 chicken breast and 5 drumsticks, I browned them w/2 tbsp of olive oil in a large skillet, then I placed chicken in crockpot first layered it with seasonings such as blk and red pepper, minced garlic, italian seasoning, and Mrs.Dash Tomato, Garlic and Basil & Mrs.Dash Garlic and Herb, then I used an 6oz can of Hunt's tomato sauce w/mushroom and Green pepper and then I topped w/the orig. recipe vegetables, and I topped w/Ragu Chunky mushrooms and Green Pepper, then about 4 oz mushrooms and a dash or two of minced garlic. I let cook on high for 3-4hrs.But halfway I shredded chicken breast.(tip to tenderize chicken or any meat spritz w/lemon juice or apple cider vinegar before adding salt)Very good recipe, my husband loved it, even my picky 4 yr old who dislikes chicken if it isn't nuggets-Thanx

I took another cook's recommendation and used tomato paste and less tomato sauce.  The sauce ended up somewhat bitter (even with the extra spices).  I might try it again, but use less sauce and no tomato paste.

I followed Kmilti's instructions, however, this dish didn't come out very good at all.  I used frozen chicken and the turn out was dry and chewy, I didn't care for the sauce at all!  My girls wouldn't touch at all, they wanted plain noodles.

This seemed a little bland.  Maybe using a different brand of pasta sauce or adding a little Italian seasoning would make a difference?  I think I will give it one more shot.  This time, though, I will definitely add less mushrooms; 8 oz. is a LOT of mushrooms, especially if you're not a mushroom aficionado to begin with.  My husband, who loves mushrooms, thought it was a little much, also.

A great place to start!  Hubby thought it was a bit bland and I definitely agreed.  Will try to liven it up next time with more spices.  I used Bertolli sauce...maybe I will try a different sauce next time.

What a wonderfully simple, delicious recipe.  I added a bit of red pepper seasoning to it.  I like spicy foods. The chicken was tender.  I forwarded the recipe to a couple of my younger friends.

I really like the option of being able to reduce the size of the recipe.

thank you.

This recipe was good- very good the next day if not better. But, it did taste like spaghetti with chicken. Nothing fancy, just like really good spaghetti sauce. I love the fact that it cooks in the slow cooker. Chicken always comes apart when it is cooked like that. I followed the recipe, except I didn't put in mushrooms. I wasn't sure if they would "go right" with the meal. I liked it better the next day. Thanks for the add.

I halved the recipe (except the veggies) and added a can of tomato paste like the others suggested.  I also added some dried basil and some Italian seasoning.  I served with mozzerella cheese.  I still feel like I was missing something, not sure what exactly...

My husband and I liked this recipe.  The chicken was a little bland so I will definately add extra spices next time.  The sauce was a little runny but adding a little tomato paste did the trick.  It was fabulous as a left over since the sauce thickened over night.

A bit simple for me, but good lazy day cooking I suppose. Would love to see a revised version with a full taste and a solid fix for the sauce volume and consistancy.

Super simple, super yummy!  Made this for dinner and it disappeared!  I also gave the recipe to my best friend who made it the night after I did, to rave reviews from her family.  My clan won't eat mushrooms, so sadly I could not include them, but it was still delish. I also added more garlic and used dried minced onion, as hubby won't eat the good fresh kind. I also used a jar and a half of sauce, as we are big sauce fans.  Still, I'm sure the recipe would be great as given, my adjustments were per my family's tastes, not because I thought the recipe needed adjusting. Thanks Rosie!

I guess I'm not a fan of tomatoes and chicken.

I give it 4 stars not for what I ended up with, but for what I believe it would likely be had I used a better sauce.

I made this with reviewer KMILTI's suggestions, right down to the sprinkle of red pepper flakes. 

I used two large boneless/skinless chicken breasts (not split), and it was done in four hours, cooked on "Lo". For the amount of sauce I ended up with, more chicken would've been too much.

I used Bertolli Summer something sauce. My husband and I did not like the sauce. Next time I'll use a marinara or anything but what I used. Adding 6 oz. of tomato paste kept the sauce from being runny, so that was a good thing.

I served it over whole wheat penne, because the sauce seemed too substantial for spaghetti. But now I think almost any kind of pasta would be ok. Or, maybe rice.

I'm glad I tried it, and I do recommend it. Just use a better sauce, and check your cooking time.

This was ok - we're trying the low carb diet so we didn't have any pasta or rice with it.  That probably would have made it better.

Made this for dinner yesterday and it was a big hit. Served it over corkscrew pasta and make a loaf of garlic and herb french bread in the bread machine while the chicken cooked. This one got a "Thanks Mom" from my teenage son! This one is a keeper!

This Cacciatore was just as good as my Mom use to make.  We enjoyed it so much.  You can put it in the crockpot in the morning and when you get home from work it is ready to serve.  Delicious!!

This is good stuff. Very easy and great flavor. The chicken was moist and tender and the sauce was very tasty (great for garlic bread). You must try it!!!

I have to add a lot of spices, because the water from the veggies waters down the taste.

This was a pretty good meal but rather bland.  I think next time I'd add some more italian type spices (basil, oregano, etc) to flavor it up a bit.

Super easy, I used a combination of boneless chicken breasts and thighs seasoned with salt, pepper, and Italian seasonings. Very flavorful.

We thought the flavor was good. The chicken was tender and shredded when cut. The sauce was thick. The only thing I would change would be to add another jar of spaghetti sauce.  There wasn't enough sauce in our opinion.  Adding another jar of sauce would make the final  sauce thinner.

So delicious! Instead of my trusty slow cooker, I used a Dutch oven. Chicken was tender as were the veggies!  I served with angel hair pasta, along with some Italian crusty bread.Will definitely make again.

It seemed like a fairly good recipe we had trouble. We halved the recipe and still had a ton of left overs. The serving size is not correct at all. Furthermore, it was runny and very bland. It was edible but wholly not that appetizing. We tried to doctor it up with some sweet hot sauce but even that couldn't save it.

So not nearly as spicy as I like, rather bland tasting. After doing the taste nest, the next day I added more seed in Jalapeno, Cajun seasoning and chile pepper and reheated for an hour or so. Now a nice little tang. I added some spinach separately in a serving to experiment and that was a nice touch as well.

When I made it I also added 2 oz's apple cider vinegar, I also had some spice to make Italian sausage so I added 1 tsp. I also added some season salt that I made 1 tsp. It came out very good! This recepie has a lot of vegatables and I love it!

Simple and yummy recipe! A family favourite! We’ve made it numerous times now and changed the recipe slightly. Our modifications: 1 or 2 jalapeños (extra kick), extra peppers (any colour, for extra nutrients and bulk), 1/2 can diced tomatoes, oregano, and crushed red pepper flakes

This was a hit! I used partially thawed, bone-in thighs. I also added red wine and tomato paste to the sauce as some others suggested. The chicken was perfect; not dry at all.

I used chicken breast meat, which we found a bit dry.  I would use boneless skinless thighs next time. I also added a bit of sugar to cut the acidity.

This is  a 5 star recipe. Its so easy and the flavor is fantastic. I was drawn to this with the simplicity of adding 1 jar spaghetti sauce. Reading the reviews, everyone customizes to their liking and this is guaranteed to turn out. Because Im a vegetable lover, next time I plan to add more veges that other reviewers suggested including zucchini or carrots. I bought the giant boneless/skinless chicken breasts and 3 of them weighed 2.5#. It covered the bottom of my crock pot and I put all the ingredients over the top.
Unbelievably tender.  And the leftovers were even more flavorful the next day. We loved this one.

I made this for the first time this week.  I did substitute 3 stalks of sliced celery for one of the bell peppers, otherwise I followed the recipe.  I do recommend reducing the oregano a bit, as I found it could become overwhelming of the other flavors.  My girls enjoyed it, and I will be trying it again with less oregano!

I took the leftover chicken, shredded it added BBQ sauce and made sandwiches out of it .

I liked the amount of meat and veggies in this recipe but the seasonings from "Chicken Cacciatore in a Slow Cooker" so I combined them.  I like a lot of seasoning.  Here's what I added - 6 oz. tomato paste, another tablespoon of minced garlic plus 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 1/2 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes and 1 tsp Italian seasoning.  Some of that was added to taste later because it needed more seasoning.  Oh, I used a jar of mushrooms instead of fresh which I added for the last hour.  I used 6 large chicken tenders.  It was delicious.  Next time I will use 8 chicken tenders and consider doubling the recipe - I like to freeze meal size portions.  Also, my slow cooker is a little slow so after 3 1/2 hours on low, I turned it to high for another 1 1/2 hours so the veggies wouldn't be crunchy.  It could have used another 1/2 hour on high.  Next time I'm thinking about adding the uncooked spaghetti to the crock pot for the last 30 minutes for a 1 pot meal.

We absolutely LOVE this recipe!! The only changes to the recipe I made was to pound the chicken a bit and add another jar of sauce( I used Classico Marinara & sweet pepper and garlic). We like more sauce and It stretched the dinner so we had leftovers during the week. It reheats perfectly!

Really enjoyed this dish.  Used thighs and reviewer kmilti's additional suggestions.  Used sliced fresh portobello mushrooms that held up very well.  Chicken was tender. Went with 7 hours closed, 1 hour open to thicken sauce.

I used 3 Chicken Breast (cubed) 1 jar of Bertolli Organic Olive Oil, Basil & Garlic, 1 can of Diced Tomatoes, 1 can of Mushrooms  and a jar of artichokes, (like someone had suggested) I had it on high for about 4 hours and topped with Parmesan and Provolone cheeses until melted. Served over spaghetti. This turned out awesome. Thanks for sharing this fast and simple recipe.

mine needed lots of salt, more flavor, and the sauce ended up too runny as the vegetables leached their water over 7 hours.

Good basic recipe, but with some changes to spice it up a little was a real guest pleaser:
Used boneless/skinless thighs, used a combo of red/green peppers, added at least a tsp. of oregano and basil and a sprig of fresh rosemary, and doubled the garlic, transferred to a baking dish lined with a pound of cooked penne and topped with some shredded italian cheeses then baked for 15 min uncovered. My guests raved over it! The pasta soaks up the extra juice and makes it really flavorful.

One of the best cacciatore's I've made but, I did somewhat alter the recipe. I didn't have much time so I cut the chicken breasts into large strips and browned first, seasoning the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic, oregano and sriracha spices (for a bit of kick). Threw it into the slow cooker with the rest of the ingredients. Also added a small can of garlic and olive oil diced tomatoes and some additional oregano. Cooked for 4 hours. It was amazing.

I added 1/4 tsp of dried rosemary, 1 tbsp of olive oil and used Ragu Chunky Gardenstyle for the sauce. Other than that followed the recipe as is. Turned out really good!

I made this with chicken thighs, jar of Ragu marinara sauce, onions, pepper strips, minced garlic, mushrooms, seasonings.  Put it over capellini pasta.  I found the trick for me was to cook it on low for 4 hours. Meat was moist and tender, delicious.

I used a red pepper and chili tomato sauce for extra flavour.  In the future I would add tomato paste to thicken and fresh basil for additional zest.   As others have stated the sauce was a bit runny.  Part of that could have been due to using frozen chicken breasts.  Mine was cooked in 6 hours with fairly large breasts.  Nine hours does seem excessive and I can only imagine how overdone the meat would have been.

Yes we will be making it again. We matched the chicken with fried rice in place of the white rice, and it turned out great.

It is quick and easy to prepare, but I think dark meat chicken would be better than breasts. The breasts were very tender, but still a bit dry. Also, despite using a premium spaghetti sauce, the flavor was lacking a little. I'd kick up the seasoning a little to give it more spicy kick. The chicken tended to rend out a lot of liquid, making the sauce runnier than it should have been. So perhaps a thicker marinara would be a better starter.

I made the recipe as listed, except I did use frozen chicken breasts as several reviews suggested, and it was a good idea.  The chicken stayed intact and tasty.  I will make this again, but I will add some more seasoning to the dish like oregano, basil, maybe rosemary, etc.  The family liked it too.  It was very easy which is always a good thing!

Love this recipe! IT was so good and easy! I love the pasta sauce rather then tomatoes from a can... better flavor & makes it thicker ..My chicken was not frozen when I put it in. Cooking slow and low... the chicken was tender!!!! I also added the fresh mushrooms & peppers in about 1 hours prior to cooking so they where not mushy!I added paprika, Mrs Dash Garlic & herbs, fresh parsley and basil. So yummy will make again!

Great tasting...I used marinara, little over 1/2 a jar, instead of spaghetti sauce and 1 can tomato paste mixed together!  Also added a little Italian seasoning, cooked on low for 4 hours, it turned out wonderful, family loved it!!

I made the recipe as stated. I don't care for mushrooms so I didn't have any around. I used a jar of Ragu sauce with peppers and mushrooms, added another pepper and a small onion. The sauce was thin but we didn't mind that. The chicken, however, was very dry. I love to use my crock pot since I work all day. It's nice to come home and dinner is ready.  I will try this again and make some of the changes recommended by others; adding more spices etc. I will also try putting the chicken in frozen and maybe cook for 1/2 the time. All in all a nice basic recipe.

An easy fast way to make chicken cacciatore, but was lacking to me. More spices needed. Also 7 hours I think is way to long to cook the chicken. I like my chicken moist and tender ( 165 degrees). I was concerned about 7 hours and checked mine at 5.5 hours and still found it very over done ( maybe my slow cooker? ). With that said I will try again,its a great base to start from. I will cook for far less time however and add some extra spices and veggies.

My husband and I thought it was OK. It needed more spice, and maybe some red wine for flavor. Having said that, it was very easy to make. I used frozen chicken cutlets, added onions, mushrooms and a jar of sauce. Then I let it cook for 6 hours on low. Served it over thin spaghetti. I may or may not make it again.

It lacked seasoning, so I added some seasonings that were suggested by other reviews.  It really made the dish!  I'll make it again but with the additional seasonings from the start.

We loved it ! Changes made where salt and peppered the cutlets before placing in cooker, added some red wine , Dried Italian seasonings, a can of tomato paste, Fresh basil and oregano from our garden, cut up plum tomatoes and a liberal amount of Parmesan cheese. Before serving put it on a oven safe plate topped with shredded mozzarella and sliced provolone, placed under the broiler until the cheese was bubbly. Better then some restaurants have to offer.

I prepare my own pasta sauce because I don't like the commercial jars of sauce.  On a rainy day, prepare pasta sauce and freeze in portions.  Pull one out of the freezer when needed.

One of my favorite meals as the weather gets cooler. I always use bone-in chicken (especially thighs), add two Italian sausages (sweet and hot) cut in chunks, and often add a little red wine and  zucchini which adds nutrients and melts into the sauce. Not traditional, but I like to serve it with brown basmati rice.

This turned out great. I did use thighs instead of breasts because that is what I had. I also added some red chili flakes because we like a little heat!  Yes, will definitely make again.

I made this and it turned out great! I first served it on spaghetti noodles and it was good. Then (for another meal) I served it on top of a baked potato. I added some sour cream and YUM! It was delicious! I used frozen chicken thighs, and by the time I managed to get to the store to buy the veggies, it was getting close to dinner time, so we chopped those and sautéed them, then put them in for the last half hour or so of cooking. It was really good.

It's a four instead of five only because it isn't quite the same as the original dish I'm used to.  But I definitely will use again.  I added one can Italian stewed tomatoes and decided to add a small can of tomato paste toward the end as it was more 'liquidy ' than I liked.  I like that you don't have to brown the chicken first and add flour for a simpler everyday dish!

This was excellent; I did add/ change a few things...I used a whole chicken (3-4 lbs), I used 1 jar of marinara sauce and 2 small cans of tomato paste (not runny at all).  1 green, 1 red pepper, only 4 ounces of fresh mushrooms.  I added little crushed red pepper, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper and some extra garlic.  It was amazing and made 8 healthy servings and some left over. I used linguine because I like a thicker noodle. I cooked it low for 5 hours and it was perfect.

The chicken was overcooked and too dry.   I had to turn off the cooker because the sauce was starting to burn.  My slow cooker must get too hot so I will adjust to a low setting next time.  I used half a bottle of sauce and 1 can of paste and 3/4 cup of chicken broth.  I also didn't have peppers but the sauce still tasted pretty good considering I was lacking all of the ingredients the recipe calls for.

I made very minor changes to this recipe - instead of dicing the bell peppers and onions, I sliced them lengthwise and used fettuccine noodles. I also used 
chicken thighs & drumsticks, in addition to chicken breasts. Based on others' recommendation, I added a can of tomato paste and lots of basil. 
The result was great! This is a great base recipe and I will make it again. My chicken was thawed so I cooked it on high for 5 hours - this was perfect.

Great easy slow cooker recipe!  I pan seared my chicken breasts in olive oil with the garlic. I used one green bell pepper and one yellow. I only used about half a yellow onion, and sautéed it in the oil as well, as I like a more mellow onion flavor.  I also used one can of diced tomatoes with the spaghetti sauce. I added about a tsp of Italian seasoning, a dash of oregano, and a dash of sea salt and black pepper. Turned out great!  Will definitely make again!

This recipe was good although a little bland so I added 1/2 cup red wine,  1 Tb Italian seasoning,  1Tb sugar,  salt and pepper, 1 can drained diced tomatoes and used skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts.  Served it over al dente gemelli. It was great. B would definitely make it again and it was super easy.

I just made this today for Monday night dinner. I haven't had chicken cacciatore in ages and this was a very good recipe with some of my own adjustments. First, I seasoned and browned some boneless skinless chicken thighs, thighs have more flavor. I cooked the onions and bell pepper in the chicken brown bits and added a 1/4 cup red wine. Added one large jar of Classico organic tomatoes & basil to the pot, slice mushrooms and 1 can of rinsed canilini beans to add more body. and some hot pepper flakes. All and all this dinner came out really good! even my toddler ate her entire dinner so I say this is a keeper.

Cooked w/chicken thighs- no cohesion of the spices whatsoever- tasted like chicken in tomato sauce.

It will be a long time before I make this again, followed the directions to the letter and it was nothing more than flavored thin juice, added 6oz. of tomato paste that thickened it up a little bit but the chicken cooked to shreds after 5 1/2 hrs. if it wasn't for the cheese it would have been tasteless.

I followed kmilti changes and it was pretty good. I did have to use a red bell pepper because I did not have a green one. One thing I will do different is season my meat a little more. I was hesitant on the salt due to the tomato sauces. I also threw some chicken legs in there. Also, next time I may not do for 7 hours on low. Actually I did about 5 1/2 and then put on warm for the remaining time. I may just do 4 on low and then the rest on warm OR I will try using the frozen chicken next time.

This is a keeper. Followed the recipe exactly.  Used Classico spicy tomato and basil sauce.  The sauce was the perfect consistency, served over angel hair pasta.

DELISH!! Used two turkey carcasses from freezer & omitted potatoes, cabbage,  worcestershire & tomatoes.  Added 1-1/4C barley, chicken broth instead of water  & extra celery & carrots.   Froze the leftover soup for a cold winter night.  
Will definitely make this again!!

I loved it!  I made a few changes I used a roasted garlic spaghetti sauce (Mezzetta brand), 3 oz of tomato paste, 2 bay leaves, oregano and basil.  I love peppers so I used 1 yellow and 1 red along with the onions and mushrooms. I also used less chicken breast a little more than a pound and put it in frozen as others have done.  I put the crock pot on high for the first 2 hours and then on low for 4 hours. I think it would be good served with parmesan on top I was out so I put a little tomato basil feta cheese which was good.
Perfect...I will be making this again.

I jazzed it up.  I used a whole cut up chicken and used one red and one yellow pepper sliced instead of the green.  Used one Jar Prego marinara and one can of crushed tomatoes, plus I cut up a can of pitted black olives.  At the end of 7 hours, I left the lid off for a half hour to thicken the sauce after others said it was watery.  Came out delicious.

Yum! My family really liked this and I love how easy it is to make! I added 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts and feel that was enough for us. I used chunky spaghetti sauce &  2 cans of mushrooms.

Thought this would be a fun and easy twist on regular jar spaghetti. It was not. I made changes as others suggested, tomato paste, oregano, red pepper flakes, etc. Surprisingly it was bland and not something I will make again.

Only changed chicken breasts to 2, no green peppers. Agree with other reviews that it was bland and sauce runny. Should have read reviews first. Next time I'd add the tomato paste and seasonings. Wonder why the mushrooms turned very black? Super quick & easy.

This was good. I would have never thought to do Chicken Cacciatore in the crock pot. I did add garlic and onions to the recipe and I used fire roasted red pepper sauce, and a sm can of crushed roasted red pepper tomatoes. I also omitted the noodle and poured it over white rice. It was very tasty!

Can't beat the ease of this.  Best advice was to add a can of tomato paste to thicken.  I think cutting chunks (not finely diced) of onion, mushroom and zucchini made it a meal. Best served with brown rice.  Set it at high for 4 hrs. NEW NOTE: This time I used leftover chicken so I didn't use the crockpot. I added a can of tomatoes in addition to sautéed veggies.

The recipe is very easy but, a little on the bland side.  The sauce was runny as well- not sure if that is because I added a can of tomatoes or what.  I think the next time I make this I will add more garlic and fresh basil.  All in all it was still a good dinner.  I cooked mine on high for 4 hours and the chicken easily cut up but not mushy or shredded.

I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor payout from this simple recipe.  The bulk of my time was spent prepping.  I chose to sautee everything before adding it to the crock pot.  I think it helped with the veggies.  I added carrots and celery, and b/c of my timing they remained just a bit crunchy still.  It wasn't a deal breaker though.  Browning the chicken was an unnecessary step since it made no difference after sitting in the slow cooker for that long (though still a waste of calories from the oil).  I made my own sauce, and found that adding sugar (white) helped with the tartness.  I've read that brown sugar works better though.  I used a whole chicken cut up...the white parts cooked faster than the dark parts and pieces adjacent the the bone remained a bit undercooked.  I think that with more experience with the slow cooker, my technique will improve.  B/c the sauce was homemade, I did not find it runny at all.  Overall, a good recipe.  One thing, my crock pot book says that if you use a frozen bird, make sure to add enough liquid to distribute the heat better.  So I guess this recipe is perfect for using a frozen bird.

Pretty good. I used 2 lbs. of chicken tenders & a 28 oz can of stewed tomatoes, lots of garlic, about a teaspoon of Italian seasoning,some fresh rosemary, and a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes.  At first it was very watery.  I added 12 oz of tomato paste to thicken it up & it turned out well in the end.  I cooked it for 5 hours on high (my crockpot isn't very hot), and it was done just right.

I was not thrilled with this.  To me it was not reminiscent of more traditional cacciatore dishes.  And I thought it was a little bland.

Just made this last week and it turned out wonderful.  I followed recipe almost exactly but added a few more veggies (yellow peppers/zucchini/red peppers) and it was awesome.  Very, very simple to throw together!  Cooked on low for almost 10 hours and chicken was really tender.  Veggies would have been better had I thrown those in later in the process but they were still good!

This was really good! I've made it both ways with chicken breasts and thighs. Love the fresh mushrooms, but prefer using my homemade spaghetti sauce if I'm not in a hurry and lots of garlic.I also used red bell pepper instead of green, it has a better flavor to me.

I served this over spagettisquash and it was great.  Try it instead of pasta or rice.

This was a good start, but added some more items from another that was similar. I didn't have chicken thigh but would like to try ck thigh and breast combo next time.  Used 4 cloves of garlic instead of 1 (we love garlic at our house).  Added 1/4cup of Italian dressing over the onions & garlic.  Added some baby carrots and peas cause I wanted more veggies.  Added fresh tomatoes instead of the can. Added a 1tsp of basil with the 1tsp of thyme.  Cover for 6 hours on slow and serve with angle pasta noodles. DELICIOUS!

This is a good recipe, I used my homemade sauce and bell peppers from our garden.  I make my sauce from scratch and used tomatoes from our garden too.  My husband loved it.  The timing depends on whether you use frozen chicken breasts or thawed ones.

The recipe as is, isn't very flavorful.  I browned my chicken first ad used thighs, both which made it more flavorful, and added some finely diced carrot, celery and yellow pepper.  I added basil and oregano to the jar of spaghetti sauce I used.  It would have been just as easy to use canned, diced tomatoes.  The sauce came out soupy, so next time I would add tomato paste.  Cacciatore in the crockpot isn't any faster than cooking it over the stove.  The main advantage is that you can start it early if you have something to do.

It's ok but not very Itlian. I diced 2 skinned chicken breasts then substituted 2-12oz cans of stewed/crushed tomatoes for the jar of sauce. I combined yellow with the green peppers, chopped a large white onion but soaked it in cold water for 1/2 hour (after chopped), chopped 3 cloves of fresh garlic, then added 1/4 cup of dry vermouth (could substitute marsala wine for sweeter taste), then added mushrooms and Italian seasonings.  I have a 6 quart Ham-Beach digi pot so added 1/2 cup water to bring everything up within 2 inches of rim then set it on low for 6 hours.  Came out pretty nice.  (you can substitute veal chunks for the chicken).

Not sure what I did wrong here. We did not care for this.  I added tomato paste to thicken the sauce as others suggested but followed the recipe exactly otherwise. We did not like the flavor of this at all.

I thought it was bland. I don't care for mushrooms but I included them because I made this more for my boyfriend than myself and he didn't like it either. I think adding more garlic, a bit more salt and perhaps a meat sauce would make it better... but still not great.

This is really good but depending on the sauce you use, needs some spicing up. I added oregano,a splash of chili powder and 1/4 cup red wine. Smells so good cooking all day. Will try with pork chops next time.

I rate this about a 3 1/2. The fiance loved it and it was one of the easy things I've ever prepared. Just added a little more galic, threw the chicken in frozen and doubled up in the mushrooms. I love mushrooms. But after 8 hours I found the chicken to be a bit dry and it lacked salt and pepper.

This meal was delicious and enjoyed by all members of my family. I had four boneless chicken breast. I did however add basil, oregano, dash and a little more garlic.  I also added a can of tomato paste and 1/2 cup tomato juice.  I cooked it for 1 hour on high and 4 hours on low.  It was perfect.  A great  recipe with a few alterations for our taste. A keeper.  Thank you for sharing.

This is a great slow cooker recipe, not to mention most of the ingredients I always have on hand.  I like to use bone in chicken instead of boneless chicken but that is just me.  I also like to throw in any extra veggies I have.  Great with hot noodles!

I also tried it with frozen chicken, tomato paste mixed with half the amount of sauce, a bit of wine and extra herbs. it came out very well. I served it on top of small pasta with Parmesan cheese.

I liked this alot, followed the directions, I thought this was great to come home to the smell of dinner already done since working all day.  I did make this the night before, so my chicken breast were frozen when I put this together, think this might of helped to keep the meat moist.  Very tastey!!!

Very good. I seasoned the chicken breast well with garlic powder, salt and pepper then I added minced garlic, basil and some oregano. I also used two jars of Ragu sauce because I wanted to toss it all in with some pasta. It was really good not watery at all and it had good flavor. It only took four hours to cook. I think six hours would be too much. I also only used four chicken breasts and it was quite enough. When the chicken was cooked I shredded it and then put it back in the sauce and added a box of cooked penne pasta. My family gobbled it up.

This was so incredibly good.  I made it a couple weeks ago and I STILL think about it!  I just 4 boneless/skinless chicken breasts and made a couple other small changes (like omitting the green pepper) but WOW it was tasty.

I wanted to like this recipe, I really did. Especially after smelling how seemingly delicious it was going to be but Whew! I had to do quite a bit of zazzing up. After cooking for 7 hours and sampling only to find almost zero flavor and dry chicken breasts I ended up shredding the chicken and letting it cook another hour in the sauce. I even used frozen breasts as other have recommended for moist chicken but it didn't work for me. I also added tons of extra spices (including more salt than I would normally like to use). In the end, the boys in my house ate every last bit so that's where the three stars come from. I will look for a different Cacciatore recipe next time around.

This recipe was very good. I did not have any spaghetti sauce, so I used a can of italian diced tomatoes, 2 small cans of tomato sauce, and 1 can of tomato paste. I seasoned the sauce with Mrs. Dash Italian Blend (very good). After cooking for about 9 hours it was kind of soupy, so I added whole wheat penne pasta and allowed it to cook until the pasta was done (about 45-60 min). It was great! Like a casserole almost. Add some cheese and viola!

This was really easy and tasty.  I didn't have any mushrooms but I don't think that changed the taste too much and I also used skinless boneless chicken thighs instead.  I browned the onion and peppers before I put them in the slow cooker.  We all liked it...even my 13 month old.  I'll definitely make it again.

very easy and delicious. perfect for a busy night and not much time to sit in the kitchen and cook. i used frozen bnls sknls chicken breasts. only took 3 1/2-4 hours on high, in a small slow cooker. watched it close so none of the chicken was exposed and so it wouldn't dry out. will make this again.

Excellent!  I used chicken thighs as they have more flavour and they didn't turn to mush.

An okay recipe, but needed more spices and was a bit watery.  I guess it depends on which sauce you use.  But a good simple recipe.

I started out with frozen chicken breast and after 9 hours it was perfect. I added a few shakes of oregano, and basil. My DH added some crushed red pepper to his portion. This is a great quick and easy recipe and it tastes even better the next day.

This is just okay. It's good for a quick meal and the left overs are decent... but it's not real chicken cacciatore. My husband wasn't too excited.

I was skeptical...but I loved it!  I followed the recipe as is and it was delicious, though I cooked it for 4 hours on high and then left on low for a couple of hours since I had to leave the house.  I'm not sure I would call it a Cacciatore but it's good base recipe and can endure plenty of adjustments.  I added a little more sauce to the spaghetti and spooned the chicken over it.  I mixed the leftover pasta into the crockpot and put the rest away for later. Thanks for the recipe! We'll be using it a lot!

We loved this recipe!  I used a jar of Ragu Super Chunky spaghetti sauce, a small can of slice mushrooms, 1 tbsp of minced garlic, 1 green pepper, and sprinkled some frozed chopped onion on top.  Served it over egg noodles.  Delicious!

I use a 29 oz. can of Tomato Puree instead of the canned Marinara Sauce.  I also use Italian Seasoning in addition to the Peppers, Onions, Mushrooms, Garlic to taste and 1Bay leaf.
I put my onions, Bell Peppers and garlic into a skillet and cook until they shrink to the point that they are cooked almost completely done before adding them to the cooker. 
My family, friends and I like mine the best.

Not cooked yet. But going to try. I think if you spice it up it, will be great. My husband and I work long hours so this one is going to be a winner for sure with us. Just all salad and got meal.

I have to say I was disappointed in this recipe. I thought it was bland, even though I had taken the suggestions from the other reviewers to heart. Certainly better chicken recipes out there.

It was just OK. Used many of the suggested variations. Kids wouldn't touch it. It was so easy and healthy I was really hoping to put it in the monthly menu but I don't think I will, too bland.

I didn't think this was anything special. I could have probably bought storebought sauce with the same flavors, and without the cleanup involved by using a crockpot. Won't make again.

The first time I made this I thought it was very good but could be improved.  For the next prep I added 1/2 jar of Basil and Tomato sauce (Classico) and 1/2 jar Marinara sauce. It turned out superbly! This is the easiest and best recipe for chicken cacciatore I have tried.

Overall this was good. To me it needed a bit of something else. It was plenty thick but I added some garlic salt and Parmesan cheese. The chicken was super tender. Will Make again.

I only gave this one 4 stars because I had to add some herbs and spices to keep it from being bland... added oregano, basil, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, black pepper, seasoned and garlic salt to taste. Very tasty!

I also had to add to this recipe, but it was a hit. I used marinara sauce and added tons of garlic, salt, pepper, oregano, basil, and balsamic vinegar. I cooked it on high and it took about 6 hours.  I did have to thicken it up some with cornstarch and I served it over mashed potatoes. Everyone loved it, My parents talked about it the next day, and my kids had seconds!

So easy.  I left the onion cut up when I left for work and my kids put everything else in and turned it on.  It was delicious and there was nothing left but the dishes.  Will definitely make this again.

This was a very good meal and very easy to make. I nixed the mushrooms b/c I don't like mushrooms, and added some diced onions. I served it with linguine noodles and it was delicious! It was even tastier the next day as a leftover.

Absolutely delicious. This is a great base recipe. Add your own favorite Italian spices and make it your own. I did add a can of tomato paste to thicken.

Very very very good chicken recipe!  I followed KMILTI's suggestions, and also added 1/4 c of red wine as another reviewer suggested.  The chicken comes out soooo tender, you can cut it with a fork!  But most importantly was the flavor, yum yum yum!  (One important note tho' - separate the boneless skinless chicken breasts before freezing them!!)

It was a rainy, yucky day and this was the perfect "spring time" comfort food.  I added a can of diced tomatoes with the basil/oregano to give it a little more texture, and served it over whole grain spaghetti.  Prepped it the night before so it was a breeze.  It was yummy.  My husband threw a few shakes of hot sauce on it.  Everyone was happy.

This is so easy, smells so good cooking, and tastes great too! I added some more herbs and a little wine (personal preference), but otherwise didn't change anything. It was less saucy and more watery than I'm used too, but still worked just fine on pasta.

As other reviewers have already said, the sauce becomes very watery. I cooked on low for 7 hours and the chicken was dry. I even used my favorite sauce and it was so bland. I was starving, so I ate it, but will not make again. My husband is out of town, and I'm glad I didn't make it when he was home.
It does get two stars for ease and health factors though! Also, smells great while cooking!!

This recipe was good.  My family enjoyed it. I added extra garlic and extra Italian seasoning for more flavor.  It was excellent for leftovers at lunch the next day.  Served it with crunchy garlic bread and a salad.

The chicken came out very dry. The sauce was too runny, so I added tomato paste as suggested in other reviews which altered the taste of the sauce.  It was very bland.  I don't think we will try this again.

This was OK.  Not my favorite.  But again, it wasn't bad.  A little tangy for my taste.  I tried it with the tomato paste and the italian seasoning.  Now that I think of it, it may have been the tomato paste that got me.  My fiancee and her friend seemed to like it.

An easy, slightly healthy recipe.  I used breasts and cooked in on the lowest setting for about 8 hours (while I was at work).  It turned out a little more potent and heavy than a usual cacciatore would be, but we'll make it again in when the weather turns colder.

I soooooo wanted this recipe to be a keeper!  We are boaters and love nothing more than to come home to a slow cooker meal after being on the water all day, as no one feels like getting cleaned up and going out for dinner.  Unfortunately, this was VERY below average.  I questioned chicken breasts in the slow cooker and rightfully so, they were extremely dry.  I used Classico Marinara, tomato paste, fresh mushrooms, basil, green peppers, chopped onions, and dried oregano with a few red pepper flakes.  Great ingredients, but this is definitely not a combination for the slow cooker.  Guess we'll have to stick with beef! Sorry!

This was a quick, easy, tasty recipe.  I took everyone's advice and added tomato paste to thicken it up.  The key is to use a spaghetti sauce that you love!

This recipe was good but not great.  I left out the mushrooms.  I used split chicken breasts so near the end I pulled all the meat off the bones and put it back in the sauce.  It looked great plated up but it was pretty bland.  I added a little straight spaghetti sauce over the top on each serving and it was just enough to make it really good.

This was pretty good, but wasn't a huge hit. I didn't have any jarred spaghetti sauce on hand, so I substituted using 2 cans of tomato sauce, 1 1/2 cans of tomato paste, 1/4 cup white wine, 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, 1 tsp sugar, 1 tsp each of basil and oregano, a dash of salt and a shake of red pepper. I also only used 1 green pepper. The sauce was pretty flavorful, and the chicken was tender, but a little dry. All in all though, a pretty good dish that I will probably make again with different ingredients. Thanks!

I was excited to try this recipe after reading the reviews, but was very disappointed.  I used 1/2 jar spagetti sauce, 1 can tomato paste, added lots of garlic, oregano, fresh basil, and spicy red pepper as suggested.  The chicken was a bit dry and the flavor was not very good. It was still a bit bland. My husband did not even finish his serving, which rarely happens!

We used canned sauce and added 1/2 a small can of tomato paste-so thickness was very good.  I skipped the mushrooms but added some italian seasonings and pepper based on prior reviews.  We used thawed breasts and cooked it about 5 hours and it was too long.  Would make again.

This was really good and easy, but did lack some flavor.  I used less jarred sauce as suggested by others, added 1 can of tomato paste and some hot pepper flakes and seasonings, but it still needed something.  Maybe some red wine next time.  Will make it again.

This is so good!  I use my own spaghetti sauce and usually leave out the green peppers.  I also add extra mushrooms since I love them.  I like to shred the chicken into the sauce and then serve it, rather than serving the whole breasts.

I saw this as a 4 star, the wife says it is 3. I would make it again, but the sauce does need something to keep it not too soupy.

An okay recipe - I would have only given it only 3 stars, but the fact that it was so easy it gained another star.  It doesn't get much easier than this - I added some cheese stuffed pasta rolls (I bought them frozen and they were easy to thaw).  Poured some of the sauce over the chicken and the pasta, added a salad and dinner was super (and super easy).

Overall, my husband and I really liked this recipe.  I used a really great, chunky spaghetti sauce that had big pieces of mushrooms and tomatoes.  This worked out well with the additional mushrooms I added.  I cut back on the bell pepper as it seemed overwhelming and my husband doesn't like it.  I liked the flavor but found the sauce to be very runny.  I will make this again but will make modifications such as adding some corn starch to thicken the sauce a little.  Very easy and the chicken had a good flavor.

Maybe I let it cook too long in the crock pot but my husband and I did not like this at all. We found it to be bland and soggy.

Since I didn't follow this recipe exactly, I rated it a little higher than I otherwise would have (to give the benefit of the doubt). I left out the onions, and added additional spices (basil and oregano). The sauce did get runny, and the dish was pretty bland, as other users have said. Neither my husband nor I cared for it. I will not make it again.

Easy and very simple.  Found that using a flavorful spaghetti sauce gave it better taste.  Will definitely make this again and again.

This is the first time I've ever made this dish.  I've heard about it, but never had it.  It was great!  I did add some fresh parsley and dried oregano and served it over spaghetti.  Great dish and my husband loved it.  I will be making this again.  Thanks!

Good, but found the sauce lost a lot of it's flavor compared to it straight from the jar.  Next time I will add some more garlic plus some basil and oregano.  I put the chicken in still frozen and it worked out great. Great meal to come home from work to!

Tasty weekday dinner. Family liked it. No muss, no fuss. I used a big pack of chicken thighs (much cheaper). Turned out a bit greasy because of the skin, so I de-boned the chcken and used a slotted spoon to transfer to anther large serving dish. I served it with spaghetti squash (Atkins friendly). Yum Yum!!

This Chicken Cacciatore recipe was very easy and delicious!  I served over noodles instead of the angel hair pasta.  Yummm!
