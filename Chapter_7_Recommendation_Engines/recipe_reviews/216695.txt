After all the pots and pans used in the preparation I would hesitate to use the slow cooker. This entire dish could be made in a large covered skillet saving cleanup time in the kitchen. This recipe would take no more then an hour this way.

This was surprisingly good! The ingredients sounded interesting so I had to try it but I cut the recipe in half. My husband said maybe I should try more cabbage & bacon next time - so basically I think 2 packages of pierogies & half the butter would work well with leaving the other quantities as written. We'll have this again!

I was looking for a different recipe to use pierogies in. My husband wAs a little leery as he doesn't eat cabbage often. This was great and we loved it.

I've been making pierogies for a long time now and I make them with all the same ingredients, but I use one large electric frying pan and everything comes out great.  Only one pan to wash!!!! Cook the bacon first then the cabbage and onion, much more flavor this way!

To Catrv - you certainly don't need a slow cooker to enjoy this. This is ready to serve after all the ingredients are cooked and combined. The slow cooker is a great way to hold the meal for a potluck for to have ready after a busy afternoon.

These are AWESOME!!! A delicious recipe! I agree with the others no slow cooker is needed really but it did allow us to get some stuff done before dinner. I am entertaining the idea of figuring out a way to allow this to cook all day in the slow cooker! All in all this is delicious and can also be played with a bit to suit ones lifestyle. I understand why Joni says it is hard to not snack on it while it is cooking! Delicious! Thanks Joni!!!

I have to agree with the others no slow cooker needed it's actually a waste when you have cooked it already. Might I suggest to fry up the bacon be the only thing you cook and actually slow cook the rest of it in a chicken broth in the slow cooker it' s long process but works. Otherwise I cook it like the others without the slow cooker.

Ok there are many picky eaters in this world and I have one that doesn't like much at all. Well I have to say this is a keeper. My son loved it had two bowls of this and so did my daughter. My boyfriend loved it as well and said I need to make this again soon. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for the great recipe and I think the crockpot is needed. It blends everything nicely and mixes the flavors evenly. Wouldn't change a thing.

I loved this. but I changed it up a bit. I just thawed the perogies - I only used 1 box and a half head of cabbage (didn't pre cook perogies or the cabbage & onions) layered ingred ( 1/2 cabbage all perogies 1/2 bacon & onions the balace of cabbage) in crock pot and added a cup of ham broth. crock pot did the rest and I had less cleanup

I make this all the time in my electric skillet. First I cook up some kielbasa then add chopped cabbage. When pierogi's are ready I mix it all together so that the kielbasa flavor is all thru the dish. If I don't have pierogi's I used shredded potatoes. It's fast and eay and very tasty.

As other reviewers have stated this does not need to go in the slow cooker. Everyone loved this real comfort food. Will add more cabbage next time and I did add a little chicken broth while cooking the cabbage. Great recipe!

OK now I followed these directions to a "T" except that I halved the batch and good thing because my large crock pot would never hold it all. Glad I only did a half-batch because they came out terrible. The pierogies came out like rubber. My husband who is not picky ate them like a good sport but asked how much more we had left to eat (with a frown). I will not even try this recipe with improvisions. The pierogies taste way better cooked on their own with a salad and meat dish. Sorry this gets a thumbs down from me.

Loved this recipe as a jumping off point and inspiration but changed quite a bit. First I agree with the other people. This does not need to slow cook. You can easily cook and combine and let simmer on very low for just 10 minutes or so. Added spicy kielbasa and chicken broth. You can also add some caraway seeds if you like. I would change the portions next time. 1 head of cabbage is not enough for 4 packages of pierogies. Once you get going you end up with a pretty quick comfort meal.

This is a great and easy recipe. I used regular pierogies (not frozen) so I did not boil them - it saved a step in the prep work. I only used 3 dozen and 1/2 a head of cabbage and 1/2 onion. Very tasty and will be making it again.

This recipe was great!! I stumbled across it and I like all of the ingredients so I figured I'd give it a shot. My boyfriend was very glad I did! This dish was great! I added a few splashes of chicken broth which gave it more flavor. It is hearty enough to use as a whole meal but also would work for a potluck or party dish! Very good!

This is delicious!! The reason it didn't get 5 stars is that it never really thickened up so it was more like a pierogie and sausage soup. Only thing I added outside of the listed ingredients was mushrooms because we really like them.:-) I'll be making this again soon!!

I put the frozen pierogies in the crock pot with the fried bacon and cabbage. Turned out fine. Just didn't make sense to cook the pierogies first.

I am eating this as I put in my review. It was worth using the pots and pans. My family LOVES it! Will be making this again.
