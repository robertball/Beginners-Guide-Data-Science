I trippled this recipe, but cut back some on the vinegar for a church dinner. I got so many compliments on it, too. Some thought I bought it at the stores deli section. It was a very easy recipe to make...definetly " a keeper"!

I love this recipe.

Simple coleslaw that is sweet without being sickly.

Carrot is essential to coleslaw as far as I am concerned.

I usually add 1 teaspoon of good dijon mustard to the dressing which gives it a great kick to complement the sweet vinegar dressing.

A keeper.

This was very good slaw.  I cut the recipie in half and eyeballed the amounts of mayo, vinegar and sugar I put in until it tasted right to me.  In addition to the dry onion flakes, I added a few pinches of paprika and some dijon mustard.  A little salt and a generous amount of black pepper finished it up.  My husband and kids loved it.  It went great with out Italian Sausage sandwiches.  Thanks for the recipie, Denise!

The recipe called for a lot of vinegar.  It made a pretty runny coleslaw.  The flavor was wonderful though.  A very good coleslaw.

Way too sweet. If I make it again, I'm going to use less sugar. I bought a bag of pre-shredded coleslaw instead of all that chopping, which made it so much easier and quicker. My husband didn't like it.

Absolutely the best coleslaw ever.  And easy!!!!!  You can definitely cut the mayo mixture in half though and still end up with delicious flavor!

My friends raved about this (oh yeah, and I thought it was good, too). I scaled it back to six servings, used one package of cole slaw mix with carrots and added celery seed as I love that taste with cole slaw. The amount of vinegar made it very zippy (but not overly so) and of course, as with all good cole slaw, it was even better the next day. Definitely not a bland slaw recipe.

Very good.  I cut the vinegar to 1/2 cup and was very pleased with the results. Also added 1/3 cup finely chopped onion to the veggie mix. Definitely a keeper.

It calls for way too much vinegar!  I had to docter mine up with more mayo and sugar than I wanted too.  I will use the recipe again but start with half as much vinegar than what is called for and just add more according to taste.

Fantastic!!!  Must have the sugar!  I used red wine vinegar because that's what I had.  Great taste!  I can hardly wait to take it to the next potluck I'm supposed to take a salad.

I am not a fan of coleslaw at all but my husband loves it, so I made this simply because it looked easy to make. This recipe is very easy and tastes fantastic!! Will be making for all the BBQs this season =)

I really liked this buy my better half thought it was too bitter.   I had it again later and all bitterness was gone, so I will make again and let it sit in the fridge a few hours before serving.   Great taste.

I've made this several times since summer '09.  It is excellent and super easy.  If you want to spice it up a bit add some hot sauce, I use Tabasco, and peanuts - kinda twist on what I've had at Thai restaurants.  I've also added pineapple, apples, raisins, onions and so much more - depends on what I'm serving with it.  My latest was pulled pork from this site - super delish!  Experiment and have fun!

Wow was this good.  As I was mixing the dressing I was really having my doubts - especially since I am not a "mayo" person.  I did add about 1 Tab. dijon mustard and as I said - Wow!

Excellent recipe, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think that it could use less mayonaise and cider vinegar.  Other than that, it is a matter of trial and error to each person's personal taste!

I pulled 2 coleslaw recipes from Allrecipes - this one and another.  I mistakenly left the glowing review for the other one.  Anyway, my husband has tolerated my trial and error coleslaw recipes and always ended up asking me to just go to the deli.  But not with this recipe.  It is better than any restaurant coleslaw we have ever had.  THIS IS A MUST TRY !!

Needed a coleslaw recipe to go along with bbq pork that was almost ready to serve.  I omitted the onion, but other than that, made exactly as stated.  Quite good!  Not too sweet (and I DO NOT like too sweet food!).  Not too much vinegar.  Perfect balance of sweet and sour.  Very quick to put together.  Thanks for the great recipe, Denise!

i'm not sure how everyone else likes it but my mother and I like coleslaw with a tangy bite and a sweetness to it. In this recipe i cut the vinegar a little only because of to much liquid content, and added an extra pinch of sugar. Those changes made, this was the B E S T recipe i've ever tried. The best!

The vinegar to mayo preportion is good but the cidar vinegar was over powering.  Next time will use half cidar and half white vinegar.  I used celary salt instead of table salt.

I just made this coleslaw for dinner tonight and it was great.  I went by other suggestions and used only 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar.  I used 1/2 head of regular and 1/2 head of red cabbage.  I added 1/2 tsp of dill.  I'll use this dressing for cole slaw from now on.  Thanks!

This is almost exactly what I was looking for. I followed the advice of others and cut the ingredients in half for a package of pre-cut cabbage, even doing this and using slightly less than 1/4 cup vinegar it was still a bit much for my tastes. Other than that it is a great recipe and really easy. I will definately do again, just with less vinegar!

Simple and good!  Make sure it can sit for several hours prior to serving for maximum flavor and you might have to drain a bit of excess liquids.  I use splenda instead of sugar and it is still great.

Good base recipe.  Way too much vinegar for our liking, but was still good.  I added both red and green cabbage, 1 minced green onion, 1 tsp celery salt, and 1 tsp dry mustard.  Will definitly make again, but with half the vinegar.

I really like the simplicity of this recipe, and followed the recipe per the instructions. However the 1 cup of Apple cider vinegar was overpowering! I had to re-check the recipe on the website to make sure I didn't make a mistake copying it down. In order to save this batch I had to separate the coleslaw from the dressing mix, and dilute the taste of the vinegar with milks & sugar to taste. It was good.

I thought this recipe tasted too much like vinegar.  Next time I will cut the vinegar down.  It was also too soupy for me.  I had to drain the juice off several times.  We ate some of it but didn't eat all of it and threw the rest out.

Scrumdiddliumptious! Just my idea of a perfect coleslaw, creamy and tangy all in the same bite. I increased the amount of black pepper and decreased the amount of sugar. So good!

Actually pretty good.  I used raspberry red wine vinegar instead of cider.  I will have to try cider vinegar next time.  The 3 tbsp. of dehydrated minced onions might be a tad too much for onion taste.  I will do 2 tbsp. next time.  I liked the vinegar taste and the consistency it helped make the dressing.  Unless I find another coleslaw recipe in the future, this one will be the one I use from now on!

I cut the dressing amount in half per other reviews for 1 pkg. of shredded coleslaw mix, and even then hubby said too much vinegar. So I suggest cutting the vinegar even more. I added about a tsp of celery seed, just because. Will be 5 stars the next time I prepare this one!

Terrific porportions to make the best Southern style slaw. (I had been making it without measuring for many many years, but now I use this recipe -- usually substituting Splena. However, for true Southern style, omit the onion flakes and consider omitting the carrots.  I think the mayonaise can be reduced quite a bit.

Many reviewers complained that dressing had too much vinegar and sugar, and many commented that the recipe made way too much dressing for one head of cabbage.  When making this recipe for the first time, obvious that it requires some trial and error to tweak the dressing to your taste.  I used half red, half green cabbage--very pretty presentation.  I started with the 2 cups mayo, but halved the vinegar and sugar to start (so 1/2 vinegar and 1/4 cup sugar).  I also added 1TBS dijon mustard and a heaping tsp of celery seed.  I mixed the dressing thoroughly and let sit in fridge overnight.  For my taste it was still too vinegary, so I added a heaping half cup of mayonnaise.  Perfect for me.  I agree with those reviewers who said recipe makes way too much dressing--nearly double for me since I don't like tons of dressing.  So I recommend combining 1 cup mayo, 1/4 vinegar, 2 TBS sugar, 2 tsp Dijon mustard, 1 tsp celery seed, salt and pepper to taste.  Taste and possibly add a bit more vinegar.

I made this.  It must be a joke. 
The amount of vinegar is so extreme that three people gagged and one vomited.

Needed way less salad dressing than was called for. Think I would have used white vinegar instead of cider and cut down on sugar.

I have had nothing but rave reviews from the various friends and family I have made this coleslaw for. Adults and kids alike just can't get enough! The only change I made is that I make half the dressing that the servings call for. So, for example, if I am short on time, I will use a bagged coleslaw and make the dressing for 3 servings. Two bags of coleslaw & I make dressing for 6 servings, etc. I tried making the dressing for the recipe as described and ended up with very soggy coleslaw swimming in dressing. Even then I went home with an empty dish though!

I loved this and received many compliments when I brought this coleslaw to a recent (Green Bay) Packer party.  Ours is a mixed marriage.  The only alteration I made was to use 1/2 Mayo (Hellman's, of course!) and 1/2 Miracle Whip to keep the peace.  It added a balance to the tang and was great!

Hubby said it was best I ever made.  I used 2 bags of the slaw, 1/2 a real onion minced.  Added a little salt and pepper.  It was great, but even better the next day.

Very tasty coleslaw and super easy to make. I used bagged cabbage and halved the other ingredients. Still plenty of dressing so I may reduce the dressing by another half next time.   My boyfriend ate almost the entire dish by himself and raved about it again this morning!

I used garlic granules (garlic powder basically) instead of the onion flakes. Brought this recipe to a get together and everyone LOVED it. One person said it was the best coleslaw she's ever had! It is quite delicious!
Thank you for sharing this recipe :-)

Made exactly as recipe states. It was runny and had way too much vinegar. What a waste of ingredients. We ended up draining the dressing off and adding some mayo to the remaining residue. Will not make this recipe again.

Yum! I just recently started liking coleslaw (past 6 months or so), and decided to give it a try. I wanted a simple recipe that I couldn't screw up! And this was the one! I just kind of eyeballed the amount of mayo, but I did measure the vinegar and sugar. It turned out delicious, maybe a tad on the sweet side, but I did use a couple of carrots so that may be why. I will definitely make again, just use less sugar? Husband and kids were very impressed with moms first attempt at coleslaw, thanks for the recipe. Has anyone tried to freeze it?

Better than any store bought coleslaw I have ever had. I enjoyed the sweetness and tardiness that came from the cider vinegar. Will definitely be making this fast and easy coleslaw instead of buying it from winco from now on.

Great base recipe.  I cut the vinegar to 1/3 cup and cut the sugar to 1/3 cup.  Used 2 medium carrots and a 1/4 of a small yellow onion (all shredded in the food processor).  I also added a sprinkling of celery seeds.  It tasted really good and we couldn't think of anything to improve upon it!  Thank you!

There is too much dressing for one head of cabbage.  I would describe it as a  "creamy" coleslaw because of the amount of juice.  I also used cider vinegar as others commented but found it way too strong.  I added about 1/3 cup more sugar to remove the strong taste and that seemed to help.  Will let the flavors blend overnight.

Loved it! I was nervous about using so much vinegar- I used Bragg's apple cider vinegar. I did substitute cane sugar for the granulated, then added a dash of poppy seeds. Everyone loved it & asked for more!

Not bad, but dressing was too tart and watery for my taste.

I have made this twice and my family enjoyed it, only used 1/3 cup vinegar and 1/4 cup sugar. Tried others but my family likes this best.

I used half head of cabbage, some baby carrots, a whole white onion, and 1 c. mayo, 1/4 c. sugar, and 1/2 c pickle juice. Comes great every time!

Very simple and yummy! To reduce fat calories, I reduced the mayonaise and added more milk instead. Also, I used a blend of red and green cabbage with carrots to add a little more color.

Lately, I haven't been able to find the really great, simple cole slaw recipe I first found on this site a few years ago, and this is the closest I see now. The one I loved had a dressing of just mayo, vinegar, and sugar, but I don't remember the amounts. I have tried to adapt this one, but it makes too much dressing for a bag of preshredded cole slaw mix. I have tried using just the mayo, cider vinegar, and sugar, in 3/4th the amounts shown here. It is still a little too runny and sweet for my purpose (on pulled pork sandwiches) but I am getting close. If anyone knows the recipe I am referring to, please let me know.

I made it with white vinger and it needed a lot more sugar and mayo.

The first coleslaw I've ever made.  Mt disadvantage was that I only had a kitchen knife, so the cabbage and carrots were only as sliced as I could get them with the knife.  Turned out really well though!  I liked the suggestion to mix the coleslaw 'sauce' in the mayonnaise jar.  Will make again.

This is the first coleslaw that I have made, and we absolutely loved it! Great flavor, and will definitely make again and again.

I did not care for this recipe at all! Way to much vinegar - my husband (who loves coleslaw) did not like it either. I added more mayo and some cream and more sugar to try to mellow out the vinegar. I was better, but still just very medeocre. I will not make this again.

Pretty good recipe.  Like many others I reduced the mayo and vinegar by half and it was still a little too wet for me.  But my bigger issue was with the minced onions.  I love onions but 3 T is a bit much for this and over powers everything else.  I think with less onion and a little less liquid this would be  a great recipe.

I healthed this recipe up a bit.
Used purple cabbage, and organic apple cider vinegar.
Also, cut the sugar in half and it turned out fantastic!
I will be making this recipe often. Thanks for sharing.

great recipe - only change i made was 1/4 of the vinegar, a little bit of finely minced red onion instead of the dried, and a splash of mild (we like a little extra juice).  Very good flavor - have made several times and it's now a requested dish at most gatherings.  thanks you poster!
