A friend of mine who is a great chef once told me never to make scrambled eggs with milk, always use a little bit of water. I will stick with his method. Also, you need to add butter to your pan before adding the eggs. Also, use the salt and pepper to taste. One teaspoon of each is a bit much in my opinion.

pretty good but the proportions are a little bit off, a tiny bit less milk and a little less salt and its all good. i like a lot of pepper :) a lot of people on here keep saying things like "dont you watch the food network, you never put milk in eggs" but i think thats ridiculous, maybe YOU never do, but its fine if some people like to, it makes them fluffy and nice, and if you dont like them that way dont act like no one should like them that way. i dont like peanut butter but you dont see me reviewing every cookie recipe saying no one should ever use it.

Wow, I don't even know what to say here, because I just happened to run across this recipe and because I felt so badly about all of the negative reviews, I just HAD to try it, in hopes of possibly turning it toward the positive. O.K. guys, I watch the Food Network all the time and I know that you're not supposed to put milk into scrambled eggs, however, my mom always did and I, on occasion do and don't find it offensive in any way. Hubby actually prefers his eggs creamy, so when I do add milk, he's happy. However, it's only a splash, not a quarter cup. I never, ever follow a recipe exactly (except for baking) but I felt this particular one warranted me to do so. "KANGAROOGIRL", I'm so sorry, but the salt/pepper ratio is so off here. I adore pepper, but this was too much and the salt alone will send your blood pressure sky high not to mention making your lips white. For those who don't mind milk or half and half in their eggs I say go for it, but just add a pinch of the seasonings and you'll be a happy camper. By the way "DUNKING DON", I think you said what everyone else is thinking....

I see the reviews here are mixed.  But my daughter just made these eggs for me this morning (and with soy milk to my surprise).  I'll have to say, they were some of the best eggs I've had in my life.  (And I'm not just saying that because she is my daughter.  :-)  They were fluffy.  Great texture.  They had a good balance of salt and pepper.  Not too wet, not too dry.  All around just good eggs.  I might have a *slight* bias in terms of taste because of how my mom prepared them when I was a kid... she used milk also.  And so with that, I probably can't imagine having eggs any other way!

I have been doing my eggs this way for years and we love them. To be totally decadent, swap the milk for heavy cream and for those who like cheese add that to the mix. As for the reviewer who said it was too salty, a person with common sense should know how much salt they like or dislike in their food?

Prepare the pan or the eggs will burn. Really good scrambled eggs are cooked over medium low heat. Also, the amounts of salt and pepper seem off......

I just made these eggs for my mom, on Mother's Day, for breakfast in bed. She loved them! However, I just put in a sprinkle of salt and a sprinkle of pepper. Thanks so much!

In my opinion, this recipe is pretty easy. Its a no brainer. I actually popped it in the microwave, stirred it a few times and it turned out fine. As for the salt and pepper issue in the last two reviews, use your common sense or instinct, personally the amount didn't bother me - but then I like lots of pepper. But if you feel its too much then put in however much you think you need, this recipe is actually really flexible. Its simple, fast, and easy. :)

I hope beginner cooks will realize that 1t each of salt and pepper is way too much for these eggs. Always start with a lightly buttered pan or at least a spritz of cooking spray. If milk must be added, add only a couple teaspoons.If these simple modifications are made,I believe you would, in fact, have the Best Scrambled Eggs Ever.

OK, I read the reviews and it seems alot of people say you cant use milk in scrambled eggs...why? When I was a chef we used milk in scrambled eggs regularly, and when we had the breakfast buffet we used bagged scrambled eggs. Now, I have always made scrambled eggs with milk, with favorable results. My eggs are ALWAYS fluffy, ALWAYS tasty. Nothing worse than having flat, crunchy scrambled eggs. I think maybe the ratio is off, as I always make my eggs with the same ingrediants...adding garlic powder, onion powder, maybe seasoning salt if I am adventurous, and more than not Franks Red Hot, and of course margarine or butter both to the eggs mix and melted in the pan. BUT I dont think I use 1/4 cup, just a splash, and a dash of salt and pepper. SO in conclusion, I suggest you try it, and eyeball it. I think I will be A-O-K!

I can't say these are the best ever, but they are pretty darned good. I was afraid that the milk would be too much and they would come out runny, but they set nicely and turned out fluffy and moist. Thanks!

pretty much how i have always made my scrambled eggs. 1/4 tsp salt and 1 Tbls milk per egg doesn't seem too far off. Maybe you guys are just REALLY sensitive to that stuff.

I don't know why you would put this much salt and pepper in srambled eggs, add your own to taste after they are cooked.  Also I'm not sure who made the cardinal rule not to add milk to scrambled eggs...I think the trick to making good scrambled eggs is not to over stir them while cooking and not to over cook.  The recipes on this site using a bit of mayo in the egg mixture are really good.

This is how I always make my scrambled eggs! I add a little butter to the pan and add just a pinch of salt and pepper, then are simple and great to eat with potato cakes/farls on a Sunday morning.

If you got a rookie like the mothers day girl i think you need to mention To put butter in the pan,unless you really mean not to do that.  Season to taste is generally the way to go. It is personal preference and lots of people freak about salt  but I will try with more pepper next time.   Mostly this recipe got me thinking about the milk or water debate.   I used to use milk then was told by my uncle never use milk!   AnD let the eggs sit on the dcounter a bit to room temp.  I thought I was in the know. Well here is a site From a guy that REALLY seemed to do his homework on this.  Any way. I will play with more pepper and go back to milk.

I have never made scrambled eggs before but used your recipe and made them in the microwave. I used water because I was out of milk and they turned out great. I also used less salt and pepper. Thank you for a great base recipe.

Sorry, but waaaaaay too much salt--and probably pepper too (unless you're a huge fan of the stuff).

Salt and pepper is definitely way off as currently written with this recipe. I agree with the reviewer who said these should be renamed "peppery eggs."

I made these exactly as stated. You should rename this to peppery eggs. Half teaspoon of salt and pepper is way to much.

There were a lot of elements of this recipe that didn't work for me, and compared to other scrambled egg recipes/techniques I've made, it didn't hold up. The proportions of ingredients made the dish overseasoned- it was a little too salty and way too much pepper, plus the excess pepper discolored the eggs so they looked darker instead of light-colored and appetizing. Even in a non-stick pan, too, I would strongly recommend greasing it with butter or cooking oil; the eggs will fold together much more smoothly if they have something on the bottom of the pan to ease the way. Also, despite all the milk and cooking them just until they were solid and done, they still managed to come out dry.

Next time I make this I will use less salt and pepper, the spice was overwhelming. I'm giving three stars instead of less because I did edit the recipe a little. I used three eggs instead of four and eyeballed the new ratio of salt and pepper, using less than 1 teaspoon of each

This recipe needs to be removed, it’s one of the first that shows up in a google search but it’s WAY wrong. The salt and pepper proportions are way to high and the directions do not even mention that you need to grease the pan first. I made these for my wife and they were so awful we couldn’t eat them. Seriously, you need to remove this recipe from your website NOW.

I live in the Midwest and everyone I know here makes scrambled eggs this way.  Just cut the milk back to 2 tablespoons and salt and pepper to taste and you will be amazed.

I used only half of the salt and pepper and we all agreed they were way too salty and peppery. The texture was good though.

O my lord have mercy. This is the first recipe I have to give a NEGATIVE REVIEW. The salt about sent my girlfriend and my blood pressure to the high heavens. And the pepper was too much. Needles to say, none of us finished it.  Just add a little of each.

This is a great recipe for making breakfast burritos! The only thing I did different is I did 7-8 eggs instead of 4 because the black pepper looked like too much.

Who likes salt this much? I usually don't add much salt to anything and I even told myself "no, that's a lot of salt and pepper ". But I thought "what do I know?". Well I know I like the taste of eggs and I couldn't even taste egg let alone the cheese or ketchup I added. I really hope this was just a joke or you might wanna see a doctor, seriously

I loved it!??????????  I didn't add salt.  I added pepper, but not 1 tsp.  Portions are off, 4 eggs can feed 3 people.  I've never tried to make eggs with milk before.????
Thanks Allrecipes!

This is the technique I learned when I was MUCH younger.  I do use less salt and pepper but I do add garlic powder.

They were a little salty for my taste, so I'll probably half the salt next time I make these, but they were quick and easy, just like eggs should be :). Great with toast.

These were great! I multiplied the recipe according to the number of people I served and used butter instead of margarine but it was great! Will definitely do this again! Especially for company!
