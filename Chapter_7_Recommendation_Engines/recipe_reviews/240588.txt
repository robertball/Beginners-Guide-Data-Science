Made as written and these were good. My corn tortilla's were not extremely fresh so they did split on me when I started rolling but they sure tasted good. I ended up having to bake them a little longer than the recipe  called for but no biggie. I anticipated my cheese clumping  but it did not and I was very impressed with how well it melted. Flour tortilla's would also work in this recipe if you prefer them over corn.
