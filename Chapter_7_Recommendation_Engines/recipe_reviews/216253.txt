I loved this and so did my wife!  However, I don't use a canned sauce when it is so simple to make one myself.  Sautee a little onion and bell pepper, process approximately 4 tomatos until smooth and add them once onion and pepper is lightly cooked. Salt, pepper, fresh basil, fresh oregano, pinch of sage, pinch of sugar, simmer covered to blend flavors.  Adjust seasonings to your taste but this only takes a few minutes to assemble.  Then you can walk away while it simmers.
 The ratatouille was outstanding!!!

I read some of the suggestions and here's what I did:  Salted the eggplant for 10 minutes before adding to dish (peeled both eggplant and zucchini), added razor thin garlic and crimini mushrooms, marjoram, fresh rosemary from the garden and crushed some whole oregano into the vegetables before tossing them in olive oil.  Roasted in a 400 degree oven, poured Prego meat sauce & stirred then sprinkled panko & parmesan over, topped with some mozzarella & a little more of the parmesan mixture and popped back in the oven for about 20.  It was delicious!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I think it was delicious after adding some other vegetables & a little rosemary, marjoram & garlic.  I also used Garlic & Herb Tomatoe sauce in place of the Prego.  It tasted great!!!!

Loved it!! After reading the reviews and the recipe.. I chopped all my veggies the night before and added roughly chopped garlic,a s+p, and tossed a it with little olive oil. I let it sit over night in the fridge and roasted my veggies and used a homemade sauce, served over a bed of couscous with a rustic bread! SO yummy! Next time I think I'll add sausage to it though.

I made this last night, and yes, with a few changes.  Salted the eggplant for about 15 minutes, meanwhile I chopped the zucchini, squash, half a green pepper and half a box of fresh mushrooms.  Added 3 or so tablespoons of evoo with about 6 crushed fresh garlic bulbs, s&p into a gallon plastic bag.  Put all the chopped veggies, including by now the rinsed, dried and chopped eggplant. Dumped the veggies onto a cookie pan and baked at 400 for about 15 minutes.  In a deep dish 9x13 pan used Paul Newmans Cabernet Marinara, with the veggies and mixed Italian cheeses, fresh parm layered it three times with cheeses and topped with basil and fresh mozzarella baked about twenty minutes. Grilled sweet Italian sausage with it.......delicious. It will be better as a leftover. Thanks for the great recipe.

this is good stuff. You can add couple cups of cooked cabbage, and fry a big onion with celery and diced carrot, diced green pepper, 3 or 4 minced garlic cloves. even add couple cups of cooked tortellini or rice or lentils or penne for more substance. yum!

I found it to be rather flavorless, and needed to roast the vegetables longer than instructed. However, it was pretty good after I added more oregano, salt, pepper, tarragon and a pinch of rosemary.

I made this last night and loved it! I did add an onion and 4 big cloves of garlic sliced thin. I used a 28oz can of chunky crushed tomatoes with basil & oregano and served it with grilled sweet Italian sausage.
