Delicious! When I make them again I'll use a little less sauce.  Thank you!

These meatballs are fantastic. I made them exactly as written then froze them to use in another recipe. They worked perfectly. They held together even after everything I put them through, but were tender nonetheless.

The flavor was excellent,  no changes needed! Liked them better with ranch dressing vs. Bleu cheese.
