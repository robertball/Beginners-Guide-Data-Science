As written this recipe didn't work for me. I added some chili powder and cumin because when I tasted the meat mixture it was very bland. Also the cornmeal batter should be cooked until it is very very thick (use less water) like Italian polenta. It tasted good with added seasonings but the bottom cornmeal batter layer was mushy and sloppy. I added a layer of cheese on top of the meat mixture and also sprinkled on top of the top layer of cornmeal. However next time no cornmeal on bottom and using my substitutions for spices.

Very mushy! The recipe calls for too much water.

This is a good 'idea' recipe. I didn't bother following the recipe as written but It did inspire a close second. It also helped that the cornmeal box had a different recipe on it. First change (batter): I did a 3:1 ratio (instead of 6:1) on the cornmeal and water. I also substituted 30% of the water with evaporated milk. I then precooked the bottom crust by spreading the batter in a buttered/oiled dish and cook at 425 for at least 15 minutes in a pre-heated oven. It keeps it from getting soggy! Second change (filling): For the filling I sauteed in oil not shortening. I used diced beef diced tomatoes onion garlic cayenne cumin seasoned salt corn kernels and diced green chilis. I cooked the beef and onions first added the other ingredients and let that simmer for at least 20 minutes. This idea is to tenderize the beef mingle the flavors and reduce some of the liquid before baking. Third Change (layer and cook): I added an extra layer of drained cooked beans. (Canned works fine) on top of the meat mixture. Pour and spread the top crust. Cook uncovered for 30-40 minutes on 425 degrees (not 350) sprinkle cheese on top. Cook for ten minutes more. Three stars because this recipe needs work but is a good base.

I have made a similar recipe but learned the lesson of the soggy bottom. But because this recipe is all the way from the 40's you will see lots of reference to lard or many ingredients we have left due to nutrition changes. So in honor of your mom, I will give this a go and try not to change it too much.
