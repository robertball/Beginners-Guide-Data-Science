Add about 20 cloves of garlic and you've got a wonderful sweet garlic pickle. I have given these to friends and family for Christmas. Great on sandwiches too. Right from the jar, you can't stop eating them.

Update:  Due to health concerns I have removed sugar from my diet.  I now substitue erythritol for the sugar and they are just as delcious.  I enjoy giving jars to my friends who eat sugar free, what a thrill.  
I just love the sweet and slightly salty taste of these pickles! I added onion and bell peppers to mine and had better pickles than my old recipe with much more ease of preperation.  Everyone loves them, and you can't find anything close to this tasty in a store. I bought a gallon jug of dill pickles at Sam's and packed mine in plastic storage containers in the refrigerator. They go quick.

GREAT!  I used a large jar of Claussen Garlic Dills, I also added hot red
pepper flakes & whole cloves along with the pickling spice, made them up about a week before Thanksgiving &
when I served them everyone raved!  They were still very crispy & deliciously spicy sweet.

These are outstanding. Easy to make. I have never had sweet dill pickles before and thought I would try them. Glad I did. Eveyone raved about them. I added 5 cloves of garlic and that added the another flavor to them.

I was excited to find this recipe.  I have a potato salad recipe that needs candied dills & have been unable to find in stores the last few years.  I've made this recipe twice & adjusted some measurements for our tastes: 2/3 c. white vinegar, 1/3 c. water, 5 c. sugar.  I also add 1 cinnamon stick with the pickling spice.

I made these for family and coworkers last Christmas. They were a big hit. Will definitely try experimenting with pepper flakes or garlic in future batches. A definite keeper!

Great pickles. Used Vlasic Kosher Dills and followed the recipe with one exception.  I reserved some of the original Kosher Dill pickle juice and used it instead of the water and vinegar in the last step.  Adds kind of sweet and sour effect that I really like.

I have a similar recipe that requires no cooking but more patience. I buy a 32-oz. jar of shelf-stable regular whole dill pickles without any garlic. (So I don't buy kosher, deli-style, Polish or "zesty" pickles, which all have garlic, or cornichons, which often have garlic and usually have tarragon.) I drain the pickles and cut them crosswise into coin-shaped slices. Then I stir in 2Â½ cups of sugar and 4 heaping tablespoons of whole allspice (not ground). I refrigerate the pickles for a full 5 days, stirring them about 3 times a day to dissolve the sugar. Beginning with the 3rd day, I taste a pickle slice daily just to test the sweetness level only. (The overall flavor won't be right yet.) If still sour, I stir in a little more sugar. If cloyingly sweet, I stir in a bit of non-iodized salt to mute the sweetness. (Different brands of pickles perform differently.) The results are delightful. Just don't eat the whole allspice!

I skipped the first "sugar bath", just doing the hot pickle plunge, but this was delicious nonetheless. I also left the mini pickles WHOLE. Total success for the super-bland dills I bought on special. Will be using again!

Hadn't made these in years and had forgotten how good they were!  Since I was in a hurry, I used sliced hamburger dills.  My old recipe stated NOT to use kosher dills.  (have no idea why)!

Made these twice now and they are just like candy. Made them with Vlasic dills and once with Mt Olive brand dills both were good. Next time I will try the smaller Vlasic dills they seem to have more crunch. Will re-post on that verdict.

I loved these as did everyone else that had them.  I had several events at my house where I served these along with bread and butter pickles from cucumbers.  These were the favorite even though the bread and butter pickles (Chef John's recipe) were very, very good.    On my second batch (the first went very quickly) my grocery store had buy one get one free on Mount Olive Dill pickles and Sour pickles.  So I tried a batch with the sour.   Hated the sour ones.  So don't try that experiment unless you really like the Mount Olive sour pickle to start with.  I'm sticking with the dill from now on.   My pickling spice had a lot of cloves in it.  I'm not a fan of cloves so I picked most (but not all) of the whole cloves out of the pickling spice.

I'm not a fan of sweet pickles but these are incredible! They're sweet but not too sweet. I believe it's because you still have the tang of the dill pickle. Even though they take a while to make they're super easy. My guests can't get enough of them!
