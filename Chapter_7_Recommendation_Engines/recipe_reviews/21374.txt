These mushrooms were very nice, although they were much better after I added a few splashes of lemon juice while they were cooking.  Easy and tasty.  Thanks!

I was skeptical about this so I cut the receipe down to two servings to test it out on Ron and I.  That was a mistake - Ron was begging for more and I had to part with some of mine!!!!  This is a keeper and real easy to make.

It's the truth, these are fantastic! Add some garlic to the butter to give it a little kick. I will make these all the time!

I decreased the ingredients by half (decreasing the nutmeg just a bit more). I didn't have tarragon so I used a bit of fennel seeds & a bit of marjaram instead. (My cook's thesaurus says that both marjaram & fennel seeds are good subs for tarragon.) Thsese were very tasty & oddly enough, tasted quite a bit like the brandied mushrooms I have made before. I will make them again many times!

I'm game to try anything once and the unusual seasoning in this mushroom recipe caught my eye. It was interesting to try but Hubs and I didn't enjoy this at all. The combination of tarragon and nutmeg tasted off, weird, and even more weird on mushrooms.  Simple salt and pepper would have been better.

We couldn't get enough of these tasty little mushrooms.  I made them for Thanksgiving as a side dish for Turkey and they were delicious. I used whole mushrooms instead of slicing, which helped save time in the kitchen. They had such a savory flavor. We also serve them with pierogies.  This receipe is a keeper!

Delicious! The addition of nutmeg gives the mushrooms a sophisticated taste. Do not leave it out! Loved this and will make many, many more times. Served with the filet mignon with a balsamic glaze recipe from this site.

I've been looking for a mushroom sidedish - and this is it!  The combination of nutmeg and tarragon is outstanding!  If you love mushrooms - you will love this dish.

These are very good.  I was tryin to find something new to do with mushrooms which are always in demand at our house.  I cut the recipe back to 1 8 oz package, which turns out to be a mistake.  I added about a tablespoon of tarragon and just a pinch of nutmeg.  I could see where the nutmeg has the potential to be overpowering, but the small amount does add a nice touch to the dish.  

I served over grilled steaks with baked potatoes and green salad.  It was a huge hit and I will make these again.  They are very easy and really very tasty.

I have a taste aversion to nutmeg but I went against my better judgement and used it anyway.  This was awesome.  The nutmeg and tarragon combo really brought these mushrooms to a whole new level.  I did add a splash of white wine as someone else suggested and it was superb.  Served this with the Dijon Tarragon Chicken recipe from this site.  Nice side dish and it complimented the main course nicely.

Way, WAY too much tarragon. The result was a medicinal flavor. The nutmeg was overdone, as well, but less problematic. For our palates, it works much better to eliminate those two ingredients, and replace them with a sprinkle of fresh, minced rosemary and a dash of thyme, both of which tastes are more compatible with the earthy tones of the mushrooms.

This is one of the best sauteed mushroom recipes we have ever tried. My wife and I both loved it. As other reviewers have noted, nutmeg as an ingredient was a concern, but no worries; it lends an exotic, delicious twist which is much enjoyed and appreciated.

These mushrooms are wonderful.  I'm already a big fan of mushrooms anyway but after eating these - I think about all the years I've been missing them.  I always use baby portobellos, quartered is my absolute favorite.  I did have to use fennel & marjoram the 1st time and they were fantastic.  I've used tarragon the rest of the times (since I have it now)and I just added a splash of lemon juice while cooking, simply delicious.  I've eaten them with chicken, pork chops, even restaurant left-overs.  Turns anything into mushroom heaven.  Oh, to turn it into a single package of mushrooms batch: 2Tbsp butter, 2Tbsp chopped onion (sometimes I just use few shakes of onion powder), 2/3tsp tarragon, 1/6tsp nutmeg, dash of salt&pepper, 1 1/3 Tbsp. parsley.  YUMMY!!!!!!!!

This simple recipe was a pleasant surprise. I have 2-3 different preps I routinely use for sautéed mushrooms. They work fine and are intended to simply stay out of the way of the mushroom. However, this combination of ingredients, especially the nutmeg, produces a totally different taste that really enhances a dish that many find quite bland. Non-mushroom lovers just might find them acceptable using this preparation.

This were awesome. I only added a pinch of nutmeg since I didn't want it to overpower the dish, but kept everything else the same.  Made my own version of Chicke Cordon Bleu and put this right on top....delicious.  Definate keeper, thanks for the post.

These were awesome!  I was making burgers for dinner and didn't have any buns. I made this recipe, poured them on top of the burgers and ate them with a fork and knife.  I didn't miss the bun at all and actually enjoyed this much more.  I did add a little extra onion but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Good-bye hamburger bun....I don't need you any more! I can't wait to try these on a nice steak!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very nice. I would never have thought to use nutmeg in a mushroom dish, but it worked well, as did the tarragon. Very quick to make as well. I foresee this becoming an often used recipe.

I think this is a great basic mushroom saute. Yes, it might be nothing special to some people, but we have to remember all the different types of cooks and bakers we have using this wonderful website. I wish that when I was a young wife just starting out (25 years ago), I would have had the opportunity to use the internet and allrecipes.com to help me with the basics of cooking! Oh yes, young husbands can benefit from this website also!

I went out on a limb with this one.  My wife has made it quite clear to me that she can not stand tarragon but I decided to make the dish anyhow.  I adjusted the recipe for the two of us using just one 1 package of mushrooms.  She loved the mushrooms and none were left when she asked for seconds.  She and could hardly believe there was tarragon in the recipe and that she liked.  We added this to our "definite-do-again" list!

I made this as a side dish for the Lobster Colorado (found on this site) and squeezed one lemon in while cooking. I let it cook a little longer to remove some of the moisture added from the lemon.  It tasted amazing and went well with the steak/lobster.  Amazing!

I have been looking for a mushroom saute recipe other then the basic ones which rely on butter as the main means of the tasty flavour when I came across with this one. This is a perfect side dish both for your family and special occasions. I am sure it is to raise crusioty and appreciation among the guests.  Do give it a try!

It is chanterelle time in the NW.  Tried it in olive oil, but mushrooms are best in butter.  Added chopped parsley and tarragon fresh from my herb garden at the very last.  Used some red peppers for color and Vitamin C, next time would just use tiny flecks for a red color.  Used much less nutmeg, as I fresh grate it on top.  Next time would omit the parsley.

This is a very good side dish and I'm not crazy about mushrooms! Although next time I would probably not use as much butter. I added in some fresh lemon juice, used fennel seeds instead of tarragon (didn't have any) and added a couple of cups of Kale. This was very tasty and I'll definitely make it again. My husband loved it.

My boyfriend (the mushroom lover) raved about these, he told me a couple times between bites how amazing they were. The ratio of butter:mushrooms was perfect and he really liked the addition of the onions. Knowing what herbs/flavors we like I seasoned it to taste, using a pepper blend, thyme, and Italian seasoning. I had never cooked with fresh mushrooms before and the 10 mins over medium worked perfectly. Thanks for sharing.

We did not like this at all.  I cut back the nutmeg to 1/4 teaspoon and still had an overpowering taste. We tossed the mushrooms out.

This was a very good side dish.  Little too much butter for my taste; next time I will use half butter and half olive oil. Don't fear the nutmeg!  NO WAY does it make it sweet.  Try it; you'll love it!  I served with some spicy blackened snapper and it was just right. Would go with almost any dish. Thanks for sharing it!

I made this dish once. I even went out to buy nutmeg just for this dish. The nutmeg completely ruined it. It was sweet and had a little aftertaste that didn't sit very well either.

I thought this recipe was just OK. A little too sweet for my liking. Maybe if I cut down the nutmeg by half... don't know if I will make again.

I followed this recipe exactly; it doesn't specify whether to cook until the mushrooms release their juices, which they did in about 8 minutes (I noticed the mushrooms in some photos look "juicier" than they do in others). The dish wasn't savory enough in my opinion, it seemed to be missing something, especially more salt! Nutmeg is an interesting spice to use with mushrooms, but the dish needs more zing!

Love it!  I'm usually hit or miss with mushrooms, but have made this multiple times already (the boy loved it too).  Excellent seasoning, goes well with rice.  I served with some lemon/garlic kale.

I love, love mushrooms.  Made this mushroom saute using 3 pkgs shiitake, 2 pkgs bella and 2 pkgs button mushrooms.  Increased butter as needed to soften mushrooms and diced onions.  Did not double the spices but, did add a little more.  Sprinkled with crushed red peppers while sauteing.  My son in law and I were in mushroom heaven.  We love these.  Have used some of the leftovers in roasted pork sandwiches and in the eggplant sandwiches on this site.  Great recipe---thanks so much!!

Excellent. I only had one 8oz. package of mushrooms to use. I didn't worry about measuring the ingredients, and just tossed in what I thought was enough spice, and added a little fresh garlic. It turned out great served with some grilled chicken.

OMG!  These were sooooo gooood!!!  1/2 of them were gone before I could even get them out of the pan, because my husband couldn't keep his paws off them, despite repeatedly burning his tongue.  So easy and sooo good.  Made with pepper steak over noodles and baked apples, all in less than 1 hour.

Absolutely fabulous! I was leary of using the nutmeg as it might be sweet tasting, but not at all. I halved the butter and substituted it with olive oil and used whole Baby Bella mushrooms.  The aroma was tantalizing! This is definitely a keeper for the recipe box!!!

I am a mushroom freak so I couldn't wait to try this...it was ok.  It seemed as though it was missing something.  It was a very mild flavor, probably would be really good with the right fish.  If you're looking for something more bold this isn't the right choice.  If I make them again I would probably add garlic or I saw that one reviewer used some lemon juice, that would be a nice addition.

I made it with the following changes: I added cubed peeled eggplant. Halfway through the cooking time, I added white wine. Finally, I topped it with grated parmesan cheese and chopped cilantro, before bringing it to the table. It was pretty good!

This was very tasty! My daughter freaked out about how good it was. She immediately made some pasta and put some of the mushrooms and sauce over it and made her own little side dish. This was surprisingly easy to make and a nice flavorful side dish. I did add a bit of minced garlic and a squeeze of lemon juice to it. Fantastic!

Perfect topping for Filet, the amount of butter added some juiciness to the steak.

I didn't even think I enjoyed mushrooms very much until I ate this. It was amazing! I have to admit I did add an extra cup of mushrooms and 2 tablespoons of butter.

Great combo of spices- I would have never thought to use tarragon on mushrooms. I wanted to add some greens, so I wilted some fresh baby spinach at the end of cooking. Loved.

This was a HUGE hit!  I upped the black pepper and salt to a 1/2 tsp each, as well as adding 1/4 tsp of garlic powder.  Will definitely be making again.

Nice.  Not fabulous, but very nice, and could go well with something more complicated.  When growing up, my northwestern mom cooked such plain food as this, in great part because my father had had a ruptured ulcer and couldn't take anything fried or spicy (and yes, NW'rners use more than their fair share of canned soups!).  I appreciated simple foods cooked simply.  Then I married a southern truck driver!  My cooking, which mirrored my mother's cooking left something to be desired, in his estimation.  Being in the SW, these days, I've learned a to pander to my husband's tastes by leaning towards a lot of Tex-Mex cuisine and other more flavorful cuisines.  Funny thing is, he doesn't care for mushrooms, and doesn't care for plain cooking often, but he liked these better than I did!!!!!  Maybe it's just that my sense of salt is way off today? (due to my thyroid).  Served on salad with a cream of chicken and rice soup and some salad.

Not one of our favorites.  The nutmeg was a little overpowering and too sweet for our taste.  Probably would not make again.

I have to admit,I wasn't sure this was going to be good as it was cooking.  I was pleasantly surprised. The only changes to the recipe was I addeded a clove of fresh minced garlic to olive oil, instead of butter.

good..i will use again. I didn't have any tarragon so I use just a pinch of thyme...and it was great. I also used a little less ginger and thought that it was a great balance of sweet and savory

I thought this was a very good mushroom Saute. I loved the earthy taste the nutmeg gave it. I did end up using more salt and nutmeg to adjust it to my taste. I will be doing this whenever I make steak as I think it goes well with it.

Delicious. Made without tarrogon and did the 2 tbsp. butter, 2 tbsp. olive oil thing. Paired it with the Italian Style Flounder recipe and turned out great. My wife loved it so much she suggested I cook every night.

Yummy!  These were great.  I used about 2 Tbsp of olive oil and 2 Tbsp of butter, and only 16 oz of mushrooms.   I also omitted the tarragon, as I didn't have any.  They were wonderful anyways; my toddler couldn't get enough of them!

I used only two packages of mushrooms and only half the nutmeg.  I also goofed and used cilantro instead of parsley.  I think I'd like the parsley better, though.  But I thought it was fantastic!  Everyone said to make this again anytime!  And it was so quick and easy to whip up!
