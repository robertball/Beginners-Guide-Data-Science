wow, were are the veggies for this recipe. It seemed awful soupy to me. I liked it much better once I added a 16 oz bag of brocoli, cauliflower and carrots to it.Rating is for recipe without the veggies added.

Followed these directions to a "T". I really wanted to like it, but the chow mein noodles were soft and chewy...so it was kinda gross. My husband couldn't even eat this...it might be good with out the chow mein "chewy-ness" going on...

This was okay at best. I did stir in one package of frozen broccoli and a couple cups of shredded sharp cheddar. And added pepper. We all ate it. It just needs a little more umph.

Really liked it but it was a little soupy' and the chow mein noodles were a little "odd". But what I did was replace the noodles with a can of "veg-all" veggies.Bake at 350 for about 25-30 min, untill nice and bubbley. Remove from oven and top with sleeve of crushed Ritz crackers and a few pats of butter, put back in oven for another 7-9 min. Serve over rice or sliced potatoes.

I made this about a year ago from an old "office" cookbook just because it seemed too strange.  It was tasty, but I'm not planning on making it again.

I liked this for a simple/quick meal.  I added a block of cream cheese to the soup mixture...and found that I liked it better. Maybe change the name to "six-ingredient" casserole?

Good starter recipe.  I made these changes after making it as written...  I replaced the chicken with canned crab.  I replaced the cream of chicken with cream of shrimp (but my husband and I agreed that cream of celery or cream of onion would be good also).  Instead of the noodles, I prepared some stove top stuffing and placed it on the bottom of the dish (sprayed with Pam first).  I added some minced garlic and finely diced onion (saut√©ed in butter until translucent).  I added some shredded zucchini (but we thought peas, broccoli, cauliflower, eggplant, parsnip or turnip would be great too {we like to "hide" veggies in dishes like this because my father-in-law and kids are "veggie-phobic"}).  I'm from New England, so I also added a few TBL of Old Bay and I added 4 oz cream cheese, diced, into the soup and crab mixture.  It was really good.  I also topped it with some French's Fried Onions and fresh chives for a pop of freshness at the end.  Thank you!  It was yummy and we'll make it again, adjusting until it's just right!

3 stars on the original recipe as is....

4 stars with the added ideas.  Put cream cheese in - helped a lot with the thickness.  And I didn't use all the milk.  I also added fresh mushrooms.  Very good.

Decent comfort food. I used about 80% of the milk can so it wouldn't be as soupy. I also added a little cream cheese. Noodle texture a little odd, but palatable
