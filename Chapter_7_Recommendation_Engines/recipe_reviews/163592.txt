This dip was a big hit at our family's Thanksgiving dinner.  The flavors are bold, and may be a bit intimidating for the sensitive tasters, but, clearly a standout on the appetizer table.

I served the dip with Frito Corn Chip Scoops, which have a reputation of  overpowering the flavor of the dip.  No such problem here.

I prepared the sausage/onion hash before hand.  After draining and cooling, transferred to a Rubbermaid 2.4qt container, mixed in the RoTel, then placed the cubed cream cheese on top, and refrigerated.  This transported well to the event, and took 5 minutes heating in the microwave, stirring, and ready to serve.

This would do best in a fondue pot or chafing dish to keep it hot during serving.

When well mixed, the dip sort of looks like old oatmeal or cream ground beef (military veterans will identify this as S.O.S.), so, it is clear that the visual presentation requires chopped chives.  I recommend keeping the chives on the large side.

I wonder if adding thin slices of seeded Jalepenio, Green Pepper and Red Pepper might add some visual attractiveness?

Great receipe Kate-K!  Thanks for the good eats.

I made this for a football party and it was gone in about two minutes. I changed a few things though.  I used two cans of rotel instead of one, used green onions instead. I also mixed in a cup or so of shredded cheddar cheese at the end. YUM!!

My brother in law introduced this recipe to me a few years ago, and every year about this time we make it.  I skip the onions and chives and every now and then throw in some cheddar to melt at the end. Typically though, I use hot sausage, regular rotel and low fat cream cheese.  This rocks with frito scoops or corn chips.

I have been making this dip for YEARS!  It is VERY addicting!!  I do not add the chives or onions tho.  I use a mild to medium sausage and the original rotel tomatoes.  I serve with Tostitos scoops. We make this for EVERY get together cuz if we don't, people complain!  You will be licking the bowl, I guarantee it!!!

My boys really like this. I've known about this recipe since I was a little kid. Seems like this was always THE hot dip at parties. I make it a little healthier by using turkey sausage, lowfat or fat free cream cheese and homemade salsa, as noone in this house likes RoTel. I like to add fresh garlic, usually at least four cloves. I do not add the chives.

This was easy and quite tasty.  I didn't drain the can of tomatoes, so it was a little bit runny.  Next time, I would drain the tomatoes.  It might be good with velveeta, too, instead of the cream cheese. Thanks for the recipe - it had great flavor

This is bomb and we make now once a week just to have around. To make it healthier I used a turkey sausage and non fat cream cheese. Doesnt lose any flavor this way and makes it guilt-free. I also use the rotel with habaneros and since my hubby hates onions I toss in a can of green chiles. Spicy!!

Tasted alright, but very not very nice to look at. I think if it was a little thicker & not so peaked in color, it would help. I lost my appetite...

Everyone loved this....EVERYONE!!! Fast, Easy and Few Ingredients, which is the way I roll! My only suggestion is to double the recipe for sure !  I served it with chunks of breads which worked perfect.  I will be making this one often,  in fact Im making it now.  =)

Very good, but very rich. I made as written except I added 4 thick slices of good quality American cheese, cubed for added flavor.

This is a great recipe that we have been making for years.  We do tweak ours.  We use maple sausage, two Rotel, two cream cheese.  We use Scoop Fritos if we have them; if not crackers, bread, bagel chips, or scoop tostitos.  It's all good!

You really need to use the Jimmy Dean "SAGE" pork breakfast sausage in this recipe and it will be The BESTEST frickin party dip ever! I skipped the chives and onions as well (recommendation from another reviewer).  Debbie try it again with sage sausage!

I made this dip as an appetizer for a dinner party and it was gone even before all of the guests arrived. Every time we get together they all ask me to make it again. Easy and delicious! I just wish it was a little prettier looking, :)

Amazing stuff, and of course I tweaked it on the choice of meats as we don't like our sausage hot. I used a mild sausage  and it was still amazing. Next, I intend to try it with a mild Italian sausage...or maybe pepperoni, who knows?

This recipe is a good start.  I cooked a whole onion and 3 cloves of garlic with some venison burger.  added 4 oz cream cheese and 6 oz american, 8 oz salsa, 1/2 cup black beans and corn, a can of green chilies, 1/2 tsp cumin,several splashes of tobasco and a few pinches of granulated garlic. Perfect!

I have made this recipe for several years, for several occasions.  After the first event it disappeared and I didn't get any so I went home and made some more and realized why it disappeared! It is that good!  Every now and then I will go somewhere and someone will ask for this dip when I don't bring it!  I am getting ready for a party now and putting it in the slow cooker shortly!

This is always one of our old stand-by's.  However, I use the spicy Jimmy Dean sausage, 2 cans of Rotel & 2 8 oz packages of cream cheese.  We have a hard time stopping one we start to eat this.  The look of the dip isn't great, but the flavor will win you over.

I used the "hot" tomatoes with chilis and this was rather spicy which is fine with me. Very good. The only negative thing I have to say is that this dish is very unattractive, but thats fine with me too. If I were making this for a crowd I would definitely add some sort of garnish other than the chives to make it more appealing to the eye.

This dip is FIRE!! I have made it several times since discovering it. Was asked to bring to our St. Patty's Day carry-in at work. The only thing I have changed is I use Italian Turkey Sausage.(hubby doesn't eat pork) The only down side to making this is I could easily eat the entire batch! So Good thanks Katie!!

I also have been making this dip for years, with 11oz cream cheese, but without the chives and onions. It's so easy that way-no chopping at all! I think the chives would add a great visual appeal, though, because it IS ugly. When I've made this I've had family members stand by the stove and eat it out of the skillet before I can get it into a serving bowl. Nothing gourmet here-just some yummy, fatty goodness.

This truly is the best frikin' party dip ever! I had a dip contest at work, and I had just recently come across this, so I figured I would try it out. I stayed true to the original recipe, and I ended up taking 1st place against 13 other dips! 
I had also tripled the recipe and made a crock pot's worth (I figured for ~100 people just tasting it would be no problem), and within 2 hours, there was nothing left! 
The best part about this recipe is how easy it is, I will definitely make this over and over again (I've barely been able to try it after all)!

Made this for a Halloween party last night.  I added about 1/2 cup shredded cheddar and a little garlic.  People stood by the food table and kept eating it until it was gone...less than an hour!  So easy to throw together.

Great recipe, though I changed it to fit my taste.  Add another can of rotel and instead of 1lb sausage, I did 1/2 lb ground beef & 1/2 lb sausage.

This was an outstanding and addictive dip that I took to a New Year's Eve party.  I scaled the recipe to 20 servings and only made one change:  instead of using all hot sausage I used half Italian sausage and I was glad I did.  I'm not a big spicy fan so it was just right.  Will definitely make again.

Good-despite the unnecessary vulgarity of the name.  Needs cheddar cheese to balance the heavy cream cheese taste and it wasn't hot enough for me, but those are easy adjustments.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was great.  I made this to bring to a family get together for New Years Day and it never made it out of my kitchen because we ate it all.  I will be making this for every get together from now on.  Next time I'm going to try substituting Pace Picante sauce for the Rotel for a bolder taste.

Well I made this for a Christmas party!  A double batch, because it seems by the reviews that it goes fast.  All I can say is there was a table full of snacks, and that dish is gone.  I mean gone, at one point there were five people trying to get their arms in there.  Then the hips were gone and people were dipping their chicken wings in it and the dry ribs and bread.  It was awesome.  Everyone was asking me what was in it.  It’s always nice to try a dish and having a great response.  The only thing is I forgot to take a picture!  Next time!!

This is a huge crowd pleaser. The chives are great, do not skip them! I typically use spicy sausage and also add some smoked chipotle seasoning & crushed red peppers to the dip for a little extra kick. If you are making for a large crowd, it is easy to melt in velveeta as well to stretch the quantity. We love it both ways. Enjoy!

A Half batch of this was plenty for my small party (8 adults), any more and I would have had leftovers for weeks.  I thought it needed just a little more oomph, so I added about 4 oz. Velveeta, but I think cheddar cheese would have been tastier.  Served from a crock pot.

This really is the best party dip ever! It's insanely easy to make, and I never have any leftovers. I've entered it into a chip n' dip contest and took first  by over 20 points over second place! I just made this for a small party on Saturday, and there wasn't any left, and I've had multiple people beg me for the recipe. Definitely a winner here!

I made this and added 1.5c shredded cheddar. I expected a lot because of the title and reviews, but I thought the cream cheese was overpowering all other flavors. I did use mild Rotel as that's what my man likes, and certainly the traditional hotter one would have helped. Won't make it again though.

I never knew the name for this dip so gave  it the name "The Manly Dip"  it will dissappear in minutes if put in a room with men.   i don't add the onion - but will try that next time. Also I found serving this with "Sociable" crackers is the best.

As others said it needs some cheddar on top and maybe baked. A little too much sausage for me but it is good flavors to play with

I just had this dip last night for the first time--it was actually made by a friend, and I forgot to ask for the recipe so I jumped on allrecipes & here it is!  She actually made it with mild sausage, cream cheese & the rotel.  Then, she added cheddar cheese to the top & served it all with large fritos scoops. Delicious! I can't wait to make this for my hubby!

Pretty tasty, but wasn't addictive like queso is honestly.  And very ugly to look at.

I made this dip for our family Super Bowl party.  I used the Jimmy Dean original sausage and the Safeway brand of diced tomatos w/ green chilis... and WOW!  It was a huge hit.  Men and Women and children loved it.  Great taste, just a bit of kick but not too much.  I had bread and chips for dipping and they used both.

Made this Super Bowl Sunday, and although I also made the Ultimate Twice Baked Potatoes and roasted pork temderloin, this is the dish everyone raved about!  It's absolutely amazing with the spicy flavor.  I added about a cup of shredded cheese on top in the end, which made it look great and taste delicious.  Thank you for this great recipe!
