This was a really good dish. I had to add extra tomato sauce, though. Next time I think I will try green beans and red peppers - yum!

Not too great with the red cabbage.  Might be worth trying again with cauliflower.

I wanted to use up my bulgur and was searching for a recipe when I found this. Exactly what I was looking for! I love the idea of using cabbage, and the taste was excellent. I used eggplant instead of pepper, and a special local cabbage which is in season. I highly recommend.

I did not care for this recipe. My 18 month old son ate it, but I had to add copious amounts of chilli sauce just to make it edible.
