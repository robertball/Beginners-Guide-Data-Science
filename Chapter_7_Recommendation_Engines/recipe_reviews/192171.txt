This was excellent! The basil I used was extremely flavorful bursting with a healthy and wholesome taste and the color was beautiful. I would suggest adding the salt to taste since the parmesan cheese has salt in it. I eat Pesto a lot and when I don't have the preferred pine nuts I substitute walnuts another common ingredient in Pesto. I find Pesto extremely versatile beyond it's common use over pasta and the base for a brochette. Use it as a sandwich spread, tossed with vegetables like tomatoes, spread over fish, bake it on top of pita bread, stuff a brie cheese with it. It stores in your refrigerator for several weeks and can be frozen as well. Oh, and this whips up in under five minutes! This is part of my regular rotation inspired by what ingredients I have on hand to slather this onto!

Mommamia! This recipe has way too much salt! I added more basil, olive oil and garlic to try and fix the problem - not the greatest -but otherwise I would try again 1/4 teas. salt to start? and use 3 cloves of garlic. I like the nutmeg idea, though.

This pesto is great.  I made the mistake in using a canola oil..........as I didn't have any olive oil on hand.  But, I used it on grilled chicken, and once the oil cooks the pesto is delicious!  also, it was a bit runnier than I had hoped (not a dipping consistency), I might add more basil next time.  Thanks!!

Amazing!  So good.  I added a little more cheese only because I am a cheese freak.  I will make this over and over.

Very good basic pesto. Slightly heavyhanded on the salt, but I didn't find it way too salty. We had this with tomatoes and goat cheese tonight, and I plan to use it with a pasta next week. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good and easy, I would give it five stars but I used walnuts instead of pine nuts and added some chopped olives that I  had.  I served it with warm French bread and my family couldn't stop eating it.  Plus it made my kitchen smell wonderful!

Pretty generic pesto sauce.  I did not add ANY salt as my parmesan was salty enough (freshly grated if that makes a difference).  Not an OMG kinda thing, but quick & easy.

Tried adding some fresh cilantro, but I still like the traditional pesto as originally submitted. Try mixing in with "Quick Gnocchi" from this site.

Used on pasta, too bland for me. Used on grilled potatoes and was much better. I think it needs a little kick to it but not sure what I would add. Would be good on garlic bread I think.

This sauce tasted really great I used it with the recipe "pesto chicken" and it tasted great! However, after reading other reviews I did use significantly less salt.

This was terrific!  My fussy teenager even enjoyed it, and my husband said it was the best pesto he ever ate.  I did find it slightly salty so I might decrease the amount of salt in the future. I also doubled the garlic and added more cheese.  I'm a big fan of Romano cheese, so that's what I used. We needed a quick dinner so we enjoyed this over multigrain spaghetti with a delicious tossed salad and fresh ciabbiata bread.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I have made fresh pesto many times, and this is the first time I saw the suggestion to use nutmeg.  It really took it up a notch.  I don't think you need so much olive oil though.  I blend everything but the olive oil in the food processor, and then slowly add the oil until it is the right consistency. Toast the pine nuts first!

It was quick and easy and everyone in my family loved it. Can't beat that! I used chopped raw almonds instead of pine nuts. ( It's what I had on hand) and it turned out great. I also only added half the salt. Served with bow tie pasta and a salad, dinner was ready in15 minutes.

SKIP THE SALT!!!!!  The cheese has enough salt to flavor the pesto.  Don't be economical with the cheese either-good italian cheese makes this sauce!!!

As is, delicious.  Enjoyed it with pasta and drizzled over vegetables.  I think I will "keep a jar of it in the frig to have on-hand."

I have never reviewed anything on allrecipes.com, but I just made this pesto and it was MARVELOUS!  Other than leaving out the teaspoon of salt, I made it according to the recipe.  It was absolutely the best pesto I have ever had--maybe it's the nutmeg?  Anyway, if you have some fresh basil, make this!  You will LOVE it!

This is the BEST tasting pesto recipe I've ever made.  And the best part is ...when I have a bumper crop of basil (doesn't happen every year) I can make lots of pesto and freeze it in 1/4 cup or 1/3 portions.  Thank you for this delicious recipe.

This is what I have been looking for.  I made it exactly the way the recipe was written the first time. The second time, I did add a little parsley, marjoram,  lemon basil, not to change the recipe but to use up a plethora of fresh herbs! I did not add any salt, doesn't need it. My husband went nuts over this and wants it on everything! Lol.

This was pretty tasty and easy, just put everything in my Ninja. I omitted the salt and added it to taste at the end.

I tried this recipe with pine nuts and then again with walnuts. Both were great. The only tip I have is to combine the dry ingredients before adding the wet ones. Works great in a food processor!

My family LOVES this one!!!  I have made it many time.  But I usually throw in some sautéed Italian sasusage just to add some more flavor.  So yummy!

I agree about the salt, do not add until you do a taste test. That's what gave it only 4 stars. Very good though, and would use this recipe again. Take the salt out and it's a 5 star keeper.

Great recipe!  We now routinely just have a jar of this on hand in our refrigerator - and make it for relatives when they come to visit!  I also find it to be a bit salty and have cut back on the amount of salt we add.  We enjoy using it as a sandwich spread.  Mmmm!
