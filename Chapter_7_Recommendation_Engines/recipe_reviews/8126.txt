This was great.  Very easy to make.


I wish we had the ability to reply to reviews on this site, since we can not I'll make a few comments to some of the reviewers here.


Spread the cake in the pan all the way to the corners with a spatula.  Smooth it evenly throughout the pan.  If you dump it all in the center of the pan, it will not spread out to the corners in the oven by itself.


Spray the pan with regular Pam, line it with wax paper, spray the wax paper with Pam for baking (with flour) and the cake will be easy to remove from the pan. 


Roll the cake in a towel (or as another suggested, use a pillow case).  This is done to let the heat and moisture escape. Rolling it in wax paper will trap in moisture from the hot cake and make the cake soggy.  

Hope this helps.

We made 20 of these this past weekend. We found that if you just spray the pan good with pam and not use wax paper it will work good. We put our wax paper on the table, lightly coated it with powdered sugar then when it came out of the oven we put a small amount of powdered sugar on top of the cake and then rolled it up and put in ref. to cool down. It unrolled real good. We also added 8 Tablespoons of Cool Whip to the filling and it really gave it a good taste. We have more orders to fill for Christmas.lol. So you can see it is a very good recipe.

I've been making this for quite a few years. Everybody loves it. Just make sure that you put plenty of sifted confectionary sugar on towel before rolling, otherwise it will stick to towel and make sure it is completely cooled before unrolling it.

I love this recipe. I have made this recipe 3 times now.  Each time I used all the ingredients exactly as they are called for.  I varied the way I prepared the pan each time based on reviews here.  Here's what I found...the first time I made it I just sprayed the pan then poured in the batter.  It came out fine.  The second time I did the same - and it stuck!  Same pan but for some reason I was not as lucky as the first time.  The third time I lined the pan with parchment, sprayed that then poured in the batter.  That seemed to work best but I found out why you spray the pan also *before* you put the paper in...some batter leaked under the paper and stuck to the pan a bit. It stil turned out okay.  I think I have learned: DON'T TAKE YOUR CHANCES ONLY SPRAYING THE PAN.  Lastly, IF YOU CRACK IT BEYOND REPAIR: I broke it into pieces and used a trifle bowl to layer the pieces and the cream cheese mixture (with 1 cup cool whip mixed into the cream cheese).  I topped it with more cool whip, nuts, and a dusting of cinnamon.  It was a good rescue and looked great!

My mom and I make these every year.  This is our exact recipe, but I do have a few suggestions to make this experience much better for you!  Make them five at a time.  One large can of PURE pumpkin is exactly enough for five rolls.  Cook them on parchment paper but make sure you fold it right into the cookie sheet.  When you pour the batter in, the folded paper helps to prevent the edges from burning.  Wait until they cool completely and then spread the cream cheese frosting.  Leave an inch around all four sides w/o frosting. it will spread when you roll it. Make them at least a day or two before you need them.  When you have them rolled, wrap them as tight as you can get them in saran wrap. Even if they have cracked, the saran wrap will fix everything. After wrapping them put them directly into the refrigerator.  I usually make 20 in one day near Thanksgiving and freeze them to give as small gifts over the holiday season.  Not to mention that my husband then has access to them all year long!!!

This cake is so delicious, I cannot recommend it enough.  I added 1/2 tsp. ginger to the cake and 1 teaspoon grated orange peel along with 1/2 cup cool whip to the cream filling. Be sure to let the rolled cake cool all the way before attempting to unroll it and fill it!

I never made a jelly roll cake before and was kind of nervous.  I made 2 of them and they were very easy!!  I used all Splenda (R) in place of sugar and it was delicious.  I froze mine to bring to a couple of parties. Thaws in a hour or so. Looks like a bakery made it. Taste wonderful!  Thank you.

Very delicious! If you grease and flour the sheet well before putting the batter on, you don't need to put parchment paper on it. It's just a pain to peel off afterwards. Instead of putting it on a towel, you can put some saran wrap down and sprinkle it, then use that to roll it up after it cools a little. We forgot to turn it over though before we put the cream cheese mixture on the ugly side, that way the nice smooth side is up. We also put cool whip in the filling, but one cup was a bit much. Neufch√¢tel cheese also worked fine (it's healthier). We also used splenda in the cream cheese filling in place for half the sugar. Enjoy! Very tasty**

Everyone loves this one! All that rolling sounds a little complicated, but it's really pretty easy. I want the nuts on the inside of the cake so I grease  the pan, use parchment paper and grease that also. As soon as it comes out of the oven, I run a butter knife around the edges, flip it onto a sideless (?) cookie sheet and flip it again onto the powdered sugar tea towel, roll up and chill. 3/4 of a cup of walnuts works best for me. Edit: After making this recipe many, many times now, I decided to change  pans and wondered what took me so long. I make other cake rolls and I use a 13x9 jelly roll pan. It was perfect!  It isn't a big difference, but I liked the looks much better. It was just a smidge thicker.

I've been making these cake rolls for well over 25 years now and you don't need to grease the jelly roll pan.  Just line it with wax paper and allow enough paper extending over the ends of the pan so you can use it for handles to lift the cake out.  I also lift the pan up and slap it down on the counter several times to make the batter spread more evenly over the pan.  After the cake is baked and lifted out of the pan, generously sift powdered sugar over it, then lay it on a linen dish towel (or pillowcase) and roll it all up together.  I allow them to cool no more than an hour.  If you allow it to get completely cold it will be more likely to crack when you unroll it.  One more thing, do not overbake.  I bake mine for 15 minutes @ 350F, no more, no less.

Hi, this recipe is similar to one I have and love, however, mine calls for 1 tsp. of ginger. I thought it was a type-o, then I noticed another recipe had ginger. Has anyone tried it? What does it do? Thanks

I originally made this recipe in 2007 by Mary Gecho, which is no longer listed on this site. It is slightly different ingred., mixing inst., and pan prep. I misplaced it and have been using this one which is good, but Mary's is much better. During a recent move I found Mary's; to me the texture of hers is much better. Here it is....3 eggs, 1 cup sugar,2/3 canned pumpkin, 1 tsp lemon juice, 3/4 cup all-purp flour, 2 tsp cinnamon,1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 cup chopped walnuts, 6 oz cream cheese,1 cup conf sugar, 1/4 cup butter, and 1/2 tsp vanilla. the directions are basically the sane except....beat eggs for 3 minutes...beat in sugar for 2 minutes.....grease the wax paper, but don't flour it, it will peel off easily.....bake 12-14 minutes...cool 5 minutes before dumping from pan. Just a hint from me, I have found that if I sprinkle my cake with powdered sugar instead of my towel, it works much better for me. Hope you enjoy. Mary's recipe is moister, to me this one is a little dry.

I've been making this for years.  You start rolling from the LONG side not the short side.  That way you get a longer roll of cake.

I did not make this, however it is very close to the recipe I have. Over the years I have tried many different ways to bake and roll the cake. I use parchment paper as it does not stick and there is no need for cooking spray. I take my spatula and spread my pumpkin mixture to the ends of my wilton baking sheet and then tap it on the table, or counter, and fill in where necessary. I roll by using a hand towel covered with powdered sugar. Wait 20 minutes unroll and fill with cream cheese mix and roll back up and get it into the fridge. Hope this helps.

My mother gave me this recipe years ago.  It is soooo good.  The only difference in her recipe is that there is 1 tsp. ginger added.  I also don't use 1 c. of conf. sugar.  I think that's too much, so I use 3/4 c.  The secret to rolling the cake is to make sure you don't over bake it.  Otherwise, it cracks and breaks.

I also have been making for years. I have made change to mine over the years. The additional spices, (ginger, nutmeg) with the cinnamon. What I want to say is, I can see whipped cream added to the filling would be very good, But why does everyone want to use cool whip????? Real whipped cream is not that hard to make, and yes I get the calorie thing, but are the chemicals and all the other weird stuff really better for you?? If you are eating that much whipped cream you might have a problem, That's a joke !!

This was the first time i had attempted to make a roll cake. I followed the ingredient list exactly - the flavor was very good. I used a Pampered Chef jelly roll pan, lightly oiled it with olive oil, laid down parchment paper, sprayed it with baking spray. I had no trouble getting it out of the pan. I rolled the cake in a sugared tea towel (the tip regarding wax paper/plastic wrap holding in moisture was helpful) let it cool and had no trouble with it sticking to the towel.  My family loved this - it may just become a traditional dessert next to the apple and pumpkin pies. Thank you for a great dessert.

Excellent, alot easier than I thought.   This was my first "roll cake".  Pan - greased pan, used parchment paper (instead of waxed), greased  the paper and sprinkled it with cinn. sugar & a bit of pumpkin spice. (I use the cinn/sugar comb. with Banana Breads, Spice Cakes, muffins etc... whether or not "flour dusting" is required.  Read it here a long time ago- )   The cin/sugar/pumk. combo" produced a slightly crunch outside, adding  another texture.  Although I will use  LESS conf. sugar in cream cheese to off set as it was on the  extra ++sweet side.  Cooling time for cake was about 90 min +/-.    I was afraid to unroll it  any sooner to test it!  And yes, it did crack - no big deal...PS  used a king size pillow case to roll it in - remember to place cake - the part you will start the rolling with, closer to end, otherwise there was too much material rolled in the center.  Happy Holidays!

AMAZING!  My aunt used to make this for Thanksgiving every year.  It was the one thing I need in order to make it feel like Thanksgiving.  I finally found this recipe, and it is above all the best one I've ever tried.  Just like my aunt's!

I'm not sure what I am doing wrong with this recipe. I made it yesterday and after 25 minutes of baking it was like a custard on the inside. I  know I'm going wrong at the egg/flour stage but I'm not sure why. Any pointers on what the consistency after 5 min of beating the egg should be. I did it again today and I'm pretty sure I did it wrong again : ( I know I can do it right and it will be great but I don't know what is wrong.

I made this last night and it turned out beautiful.  As well as tasty.  My husband has asked me NOT to make it again.  Over half of it is gone!? He has no will power! Following the directions exactly everything came out of the pan as directed and rolled/unrolled as expected. I will make this again... only when we have company so my husband doesn't eat the whole thing in a day.

I made this for a church function and when all was said and done, those who brought a store-bought roll had left overs and mine was gone.  Everyone said that it was so light yet delicious...and I agree!

delicious!  I made this with squash instead of pumpkin since that's what I had on hands--still tasted great!
I used parchment paper, not wax paper, and had great success getting it off very easily after baking.

Very good, just place the cake on the edge of the towel where you are going to roll it so no extra cloth is in the first part of the roll and it should not crack. A little bit on the sweet side but very tasty!

Not much to add to everyone elses notes except that I totally agree with reducing the powdered sugar and adding cool whip.  I used 3/4 cup powdered sugar and 3/4 cup cool whip.  It gave it a "not too sweet" taste and was much better as to not taste too much like powdered sugar.  Top notch and my house smelled amazing.  My family came in from hunting and my 16 year old son told me the smell was making him crazy.  It smelled a bit like christmas today

This recipe is good but I did tweek it to fit our taste. In the filling I added 1/3 cup caramel sauce and 4 oz of meled white chocolate along with 2 cups of whipped cream. After we put the filling in and rolled it we iced the outside with the rest of the filling. Turned out wonderful!!

Beautiful!  I almost chickened out and tried for a layer cake instead because I was worried I would make a terrible mess while trying to roll/unroll.  I made the cake exactly as recipe stated.  Sprayed my parchment paper and it did not stick to the cake even a little bit. Flipped it directly onto a pillowcase sprinkled with confectioners sugar, rolled it up and stuck it in the fridge to cool which took about 90 minutes.  When I unrolled it there was not even a hint of cracking.  I did use the whole 8 oz of cream cheese for the frosting-also added 2 T of heavy whipping cream and 1 1/2 t of cinnamon to the icing.  I ended up wit a little extra which I spread on top.  I was told it was "too good".  Will make this again for Thanksgiving next year.

This was the first roll i ever made, and I only do it for thanksgiving(since its pumpkin) but i get asked for it for every holiday family dinner.
the cake has a really nice flavour, not too pumpkiny or over spiced. I do find the icing sugar makes it sticky though.

I am a big fan of how tasty and easy this was.  The only thing I did different was put 8 oz of cream cheese in instead of 6 oz. and I also put chocolate chips and pecans in the filling.

Tastes wonderful, my favorite Thanksgiving treat.  WARNING: Do not use normal wax paper!  It will catch on fire and ruin the cake!  I'm sure an experienced baker would know this, but perhaps others like me would find it useful. I find that parchment paper or aluminum foil work very well!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was super yummy!  My grandma made pumpkin bread so instead of pumpkin roll I did apple instead.  I used a can of apple pie filling in place of the pumpkin and it came out great tasting...like apple spice cake.  

--About preventing cracking, I read somewhere that if you cut off both the hard edges (long wise) before rolling it won't split.  I'll try that next time!

I've never made a roll cake before, so I was a bit nervous that I would ruin it somewhere in the process. However, this recipe is spot on easy to make, and if you follow the directions as written, you will have great results. I made one to try it out on my family, and the four of us ate it in one day. Scrumptious! I've had to make two more in the past week for Thanksgiving, and another for the family! This Pumpkin Roll Cake is both easy to make and delicious! Thank you for sharing!

Much easier to prepare than I'd imagined.  Really does freeze beautifully.  Just be careful to serve it cold or it may get pretty mushy.  Everyone raved about this one.

A real crowd pleaser! I came home to find the cake I left chilling in the fridge was GONE.  Delicious, but you really do have to be careful when rolling it so it doesn't fall apart on you. I addd a brown butter glaze on top and it was amazing.

I impressed myself tonight with this recipe - after carefully reading the reviews, I succeeded in producing a roll without any cracks!  You do need to be fairly generous with the amount of confectioner's sugar that you place on the towel. Too little and you'll be muttering under your breath as you try to carefully pull the roll away from the towel. Followed recipe exact but only had a 17" jelly roll pan, so this produced a somewhat thinner cake, but that didn't affect appearance or taste in any way.  Thank you for posting this recipe; I'm thrilled to have conquered my fears about making this!

We really enjoyed this simple, but yummy recipe.  I used an 8oz package of cream cheese and 2 TBS of butter and it was wonderful (I love cream cheese).  I did not use enough powdered sugar on the towel, you really need quite a bit.

The Best!!! An exciting change from a jelly roll. The first time I made it I didn't keep it in the oven long enough and the outside was very sticky, the 2nd and 3rd tmes I left it about 3-4 more minutes and it was great!!! It was good enough that my mother-in-law wanted 2 for X-mas this year!!! I top it with "real" whipped cream and fresh nutmeg!!!

This was my first ever pumpkin roll and it was so easy! It came out tasting soooo good. My husband loved it and he doesn't even like pumpkin. Served this at our Bible study and it was gone in a flash. Will definitely be making more of this! I followed other's suggestions and added some cool whip to the cream. Very tasty!!

I love this cake! So does my family, I make this cake for various events. I once made three, one to take to the party I was attending, one for the freezer, and one to eat. My family ended up eating both in two days! Must have been good.

This was really tasty and surprisingly easy to make! Light spongy cake with a creamy filling.  Batter was very liquidy and I thought I did something wrong, but it baked up nicely.  Be sure to roll it up in towel while still hot or it won't roll up properly.

Excellent! The only advice I'd add is to refrigerate the filling prior to spreading. It keeps it thick and makes the roll look great. The first time I didn't do this and the icing thinned out when I rolled the cake up and it all squeezed out the end. Looks complicated (the first time may not come out perfect) but otherwise a simple dessert.

I've been making this wonderful cake for years.    The only difference in this recipe & mine is, that  mine calls for 1 tsp of ground ginger, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg & 1 tsp vanilla.  I had no problem rolling it but I do like the idea of rolling it in a pillow case, for a smoother surface.  I make extra filling & spread a line of it down the top of the cake & prinkle with a few walnuts.  It's always a hit.  I will be making it this week for a Thanksgiving pot luck.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner at my nieces home and everyone absolutely loved it. I did line my pan with parchment paper as opposed to greasing everything. I did have a little trouble unrolling the cake, next time I will use more icing sugar for dusting. I will be making this again for sure.

This cake is FABULOUS, got rave reviews. However, it took 3 times before I got no 'cracks' in the cake while unrolling. The secret is do NOT wrap real tight, use a pillow case (surface more smooth than a towel), using a sieve- GENEROUSLY sprinkle powdered sugar on pillowcase. Let cool at least 1 hour before un-rolling. You'll LOVE this cake.

I doubled the amount of filling on the inside and I'm glad I did it! I put about 3/4 of the doubled filling inside, and left the last 1/4th in a bowl to be slightly melted and used as a dip. It made this already delicious dessert even better! (ps - I used other reviewer's tips to spray the pan with pam baking spray, then line with parchment, then spray again - the cake part popped out easily!) - oh and btw, whatever you do to change this recipe, dont omit the walnuts... omg that crunch is bliss!

I was pretty nervous about making this as I was so worried that the cake would crack, but it didn't and it came out beautifully! This is one incredible dessert and I plan on making it again come Thanksgiving. Thank you so much Stephanie!

This was hard to work with.  I was able to do it without breaking the cake and it looked great.  I put in the fridge to set and when I took it out to try it, I was so disappointed.  It was awful.  It might have been my fault, but I don't know.  I had to throw the whole thing away.

Fantastic recipe!!  I used 8 oz. of cream cheese.  Keeping the roll from splitting apart was a bit tricky.  The entire family loved it at Thanksgiving - even more than the pumpkin pie!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover canned pumpkin and came across this recipe.  Man, am I ever glad I did -- this is over-the-top good!  Other than using a sugar substitute (for a diabetic guest) and nonfat cream cheese (which is all I had on hand), I followed the recipe exactly.  My changes went totally unnoticed; the bridge club raved.  Will serve this annually during the holidays.  Great recipe, Stephanie!

Yummy and not as hard as it looks! Tips: 1)make sure to use the right size cookie sheet--too big and the layers of cake will be too thin. 2)you can substitute any nuts for walnuts, i chose pecans! 3)the batter does not spread easily so don't dump it all in the middle of the cookie sheet. 4)i think next time ill try mixing nuts into the batter so its not all on the outside.

I actually used the left over icing from a carrot cake (III) that I had also made on allrecipes (another 5 star!)

I dont know what happened but my wax paper started to burn, it was only in for 2 minutes, the smoke alarm went off and the oven was smoking. I didn't want to put the cake back in and chance a fire so instead i scooped everything out and put it into cupcake tins. I made pumpking cupcakes and frosted with the cream cheese frosting. It still tasted great but I was really looking forward to making the roll. Why do you think this happened?

Awesome we all loved this. The first time I made this I sprayed the pan then used wax paper and sprayed it as well and it worked great. The second time I was out of wax paper and just sprayed and floured the pan. It stuck to the sides a little but it all worked out. The only thing I would do different next time is roll it up tighter next time.

This cake grows on you. I've made this three times, and every time it turned out great. I made this for Thanksgiving and brought it to my mother-in-laws, everybody was surprised that I made it myself, it was both a beautiful presentation and very good. I am going to make it for Christmas too. perhaps I'll decorate it with some frosting holly, and berries.

This recipe is quite good for a pumpkin roll.  I traditionally make a pumpkin roll for my husbands family as it is their favorite.  I omitted the walnuts (because the previous recipes I've used didn't call for them), otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  This is the third or fourth different recipe I've used for making a pumpkin roll, and this is the first time that I've had the roll crack upon rolling it.  I'm not sure exactly what is to blame, but I think I'll be using one of my other recipes next year.  That said, the flavor and texture of this roll are very good.

First pumpkin roll cake I ever made and it turned out fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly will make over and over again.  This one is a keeper!  I don't understand why other reviewers complained about the cake cracking as I did not have any problems at all with cracking.  Oh yes, the roll looks great also!  Thanks Stephanie for sharing this great recipe.

Very good and easy to make. The only thing I did not like was the over powering flavor of the nutmeg. Next time I will just use pumpkin spice instead, I heard it tastes better.

what a mess!!! I followed the instructions step by step and the cake got stuck to the linen! I recommend you skip this step and just let it cool and roll it after you add the filling. Much more easy. Great taste though!

This was my first time making a Roll Cake and I didn't have a pastry cloth so I used greased parchment paper to roll it in.  I have made 4 of these already and they are sooo good! So moist.  I added a touch more of cinnamon to the batter.  I have also added with success some cool whip to the cream cheese mixture to give it a lighter texture and it was all good.  My sons beg me to make more.  This is a keeper for sure.

I live in Eastern Europe and pumpkin isn't available but I used roasted butternut squash instead and the roll tasted great!  I hosted 12 Americans for an expat Thanksgiving and this was a hit.  Thanks for the recipe!

i've been making this for years and everyone who tastes it wants the recipe! it's so easy! i, however, have never used waxed paper as a lining. i spray the pan with pam & dust with powdered sugar   instead of flour!  (sometimes you taste the flour). as long as i use a non-stick pan it always come out fine...

I use a similar receipe and sell about 400 of them a year.  If you find Pumpkin pie spice you can use that instead of all the spices individually. It has the cinnonman, ginger, nutmeg all together. Use a 8 oz package of cream cheese for more filling. We make this a family project and the kids really enjoy it. They all wait for the ones that crack because I wont sell them. This is a great thing to sell for Thanksgiving and use your profits for your Xmas shopping. And I have customers that freeze theirs for months and still taste as if I just made them.

Delicious recipe and beautiful presentation.  Make sure to chill the cake well before unrolling.  I tried to unroll when it was almost chilled and it began to crack.  Once chilled it was very easy to work it.  This recipe was much easier than I expected and yielded impressive results.

Tastes great, but BE SAFE and use the parchment paper/flour in the pan. I only used cooking spray because it was suggested by some of the most helpful reviewers. My cake stuck to the pan and broke into 3 pieces.

But it tastes wonderful!

Everyone loved this!  I was so worried about making it, I thought it would be really hard.  But actually I found it easy!  As per other reviews, I just sprayed the pan well and skipped the parchment, also I used wax paper coated with powdered sugar instead of the towel.  (I also used a 11x15 sheet pan just because I didn't have the right size.)  I will make this over and over again- everyone's already asked me to make it for Thanksgiving!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!

This is the first time for me to make a pumpkin roll.  I tried another one first and it just didn't turn out.  I looked at this one and although the ingrediants are all the same from cake to cake, I believe putting the ingrediants together as this recipes instructs is what made the difference.  I feel I made one mistake.  The roll was still every so slightly warmish when I unrolled it to fill.  I got a couple of small cracks but it still looks great.  Next time I will completely cool it.  I also did it directly in the pan and then inverted it onto a powdered towel.  Another reader had suggested that and it really did work nicely.  Thank you--it is going to be Christmas Eve Dinner's dessert.

This was WONDERFUL!!!  I couldnt find my walnuts and it was great even without them.  I even used Splenda in the cake part and neufchatel cheese in place of cream cheese and it was still great!!!  One tip:  dont use a terry cloth dish towel! I dont have any linen towels and I couldnt get enough powdered sugar on the towel, so it stuck a little, but it made the cake sticky (but still great!) Second time around I used a old pillowcase, which worked excellent, and the cake didnt crack this time either! I am SO glad this recipe was submitted! :)

This Punmpkin Roll Cake was a big hit on Christmas!  Very delicious!  As another reviewer suggested, I used 8oz of cream cheese and folded a cup of Cool Whip into the frosting.  This made it very light and creamy, I'd definately do it that way again! Thanks for the recipe, it's a "keeper".

This is a delicious recipe which makes a great presentation. It is moist and looks elegant.  It is truly worth the effort. When it was time to remove the wax paper it was sticking to the cake. After a couple of minutes it peeled off easily in all places but the end. I made two and the second one came out just right.

I think this tasted very good.  I had one 
that someone made for Christmas and this 
was close to that.  It was a real pain with 
the wax paper and linen towel, my cake kept
breaking up which then made it difficult 
to roll with the filling in it.  Bottom
line, tasted good but didn't look so great.

My family loved this recipe....so delicious.  The cake had excellent flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly and added Pumpkin Pie Spice along with the other spices called for in the recipe.  My cake did crack a little as I rolled it but in the end it didn't show.  When you layer the filling, it will hide any cracks ;) I'll definitely make this cake again :)

I've always wanted to try a pumpkin roll. They sure look good. Could I actually do this? Would it be good? Will my friends like it? Yes. yes, and yes! (It looks more difficult to make than it is. Be gentle when rolling it. Use the right size pan. Yours will be AWESOME!)

Had never made a cake roll of any sort. Always felt it was too much work. Well I make this pumpkin roll cake and it was a big hit. Fairly easy to make and it was delicious. It was the one desert that everyone totally enjoyed. Will make it again and again and again.

This is the first time making a roll cake.  I messed up the first one by adding the sugar to the flour mixture.  The second one I made exactly as written.  Both rolled up fine.  The correct one was a little lighter and fluffier but both looked and tasted great! I added 1/2 cup whip topping to the filling, perfect!

The cake is fantastic.. the only problem was the cream cheese filling, I tasted it before using it and it had no flavor, I added another 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar and a teaspoon of pumpkin spice, along with milk to make it spreadable.. Every one loved it,, Thank you for this recipe!

Overall, the cake recipe worked as advertised.  I had trouble with the filling, however.  I could not get it to whip up as fluffy as it seemed it was supposed to be.  I had to substitute peanuts for the walnuts since one of my children is allergic to walnuts.  Admittedly, this affected the taste.  My family gave it an average rating of only 2.5 stars, but I think this wouldn't have changed much regardless of the nut topping.  They were just not very enthusiastic about the pumkin flavor.

2 options to try.  Bake cake in well greased and floured metal coffee cans.   When cool, slice and let guests spread on their own frosting.   Or, bake 4 thin  round cakes.  Frost layers for a 4 tier tort.  Ps. I always add an 8 ounce tub of Cool Whip to the filling.  It makes it very fluffy and light.

Turned out fabulous! You definitely have to roll the cake up in the cloth immediately or else the cake will crack. And next time I will add cool whip to the cream cheese filling to lighten it up a little bit. Other than that the cake was amazing! Definitely a keeper!!

I didn't add the walnuts, but otherwise made as directed.  I thought it was OK, but the cake was sort of bland.  My guests really liked it, though, so I'm giving it 4 stars.  If I make this again, I'll figure out a way to make the cake taste more "pumpkiny".  Maybe I just need to increase the cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves?  Presentation was very nice.  Filling was tasty.

Love it. It has so much flavor. I made two, and they both kind of split at one point when I was rolling the filling in, but that's fine - it's only the first time I made them. I'll get better. Besides, I think The cake I made was a little thicker than it should have been. Not to mention the icing for it was light and not too sweet. It really brought it together nicely. All in all, this was a great recipe. I will definitely make it again.

This was my first time making a pumpkin roll cake. It came out GREAT! I followed the directions except added a bit of pumpkin pie spice, maybe half of a teaspoon. Also, I rolled it in a pillow case. The cream cheese frosting is SO GOOD! Thanks for the recipe, it's delicious. I will be making these for people for Christmas!

This made an amazing dessert! It looked complicated, but was super easy to make. I went to a pumpkin party where everyone made something out of pumpkin, and this was a HUGE hit.  I will say it made a smaller roll than I expected, but that could be due to the thickness of the sheet cake.  CHANGES: I added about a 1/4 tsp all spice as well as 1/4 tsp ginger.  I used parchment paper instead of wax paper and used confectioner's sugar liberally. This made the transfer with the towel very easy. NEXT TIME: I'll either double the filling recipe or add whipped cream to it just to make the filling more visible and light.  Thanks for the recipe! I'll definitely make this again.

I've made this several times and have had very good luck each time. I've followed the direction and it came out perfect everytime. The secret is to make sure to put enough powdered sugar on the towel before you roll it otherwise it will stick.It's very easy and a definate keeper in my family.

I loved the cheese filling and would probably try it with 1 1/2 filling recipe.  Also, I find that a lot of the walnuts fall off when I unroll the cake so I remember the first recipe I had included a note that says to tap the walnuts lightly into the batter before baking.

Flipping & rolling was a little tricky at first but worked out just fine. I served this at Thanksgiving dinner and now a week later people are STILL commenting on it and saying how much they loved it!  I used store bought icing to accomodate my brother in law's dairy allergy, and it went over great.  I've been asked to supply this for next year's dinner - it's a real hit!

DELICIOUS!! I made the cake following the recipe exactly, but it killed me to have that extra pumpkin left in the can. So I added just a little (2 T) to the frosting to give it a slight orange tint. I then frosted the cake, and with the frosting left over, I added 2 oz of cream cheese, about 2 T butter,1/2 c powder sugar & the rest of the pumpkin. This made a bright orange mixture with the consistency of a loose frosting, kind of like mousse. I generously spread that on an oblong platter,&  placed the cake in the center. The two end pieces cut from the cake to neaten it, I also placed on the platter and put a dollop of the bright orange sauce atop them.  A spoon of the extra frosting was was put on each piece when served.

This is a great pumpkin roll.  Even my kids will eat this.  I do not make it on wax paper as it has tended to smoke in the oven.  I use parchment paper and that seems to work very well.

I have used this recipe for years and it is great.  I found that the bread is sometimes hard to roll because of the walnuts.  I love them and probably add too many.  What I do now is add them to the filling, rather than the bread.  Comes out great, with no complaints.

I have made a variety of these over the years and this has to be one of the THEE best yet.  I didn't use the lemon juice or walnuts (didn't have any on hand) and it still came out perfect.  The texture is "right on" with the cake.  Thanks for sharing.  I made 4 of these the first week I came across this recipe...LOL!

This a great recipe. I made it the other night for a family get together. I thought it would be hard to roll it but it was alot easyer than i expected. But I do recmend that before serving you let it chill in the frig for a couple of hours, so the iceing can get a little harder. But every one did enjoy it.

I've never made a jelly roll style cake before; I was nervous that the cake would break as I rolled it. It didn't break, after all. =)  I added 1/4 tsp. each of ground ginger and ground cloves. Make sure that the batter is spread evenly throughout the pan. Sprinkling the cake with powdered sugar is a great concealer for any cracks!

So yummy.  I added 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 almond to the frosting. I did have problems with the cake cracking..but it was probally due to my impatience (it was still a tad warm when I chose to unroll it).  Next time I will let it cool longer and also add way more conf. sugar to the pillowcase before rolling it (it was sticking a bit).  Even with the cracks - it still looks nice and tastes wonderful!

When I heard I had to "roll" this cake- I thought it would be impossible, that it would break.  It worked just like the recipe said!  Expect more than usual time for the cake to cool (since it is rolled up AND in a tea towel.)  The cream cheese frosting is delicious, and tastes very homemade.  It is a dense cake, tastes best when chilled too.  Everyone who tried it with me loved it.  And because it is so compact, dense, and easy to pack- this is a very portable dessert for those who have to do traveling for the holidays!

I didn't have the correct size pan, so my roll was a little thin. Even so, it was still great. I also didn't use any nuts. Taste was fatastic, but due to the incorrect pan size, it cracked a bit. I'll have to try again with the right size pan. It was so good!

This is the very first time I made these. (I have always been afraid of the rolling of the cake and unrolling) but not anymore!  This is awesome!  I always used to spend the big money and buy these and get only small pieces, but not anymore!  It turned out great!!
They only thing is I didn't use the nuts. The cake was very moist and had very little cracks.  I filled it with double cream cheese frosting that I made from scratch.  Talk about a "little piece of heaven"!  I am so happy that I found a recipe to make them and they are not as difficult as I thought.  Outstanding recipe!  Thanks!

Based solely on flavor this recipe is a 5 star recipe, hands down.  But, geez, it was a pain to make.  Everything was going great, until I went to unroll the cake.  Apparently, I had let it cool a little too long, and it didn't want to unroll without cracking into long strips.  I unrolled it, filled it with the frosting (don't melt the butter!!), and then rolled it up in saran wrap, foil, finally putting it into a bread pan and that all went into the freezer.  It turned out not-too-shabby looking and tasted fantastic!  I can't wait to try this again!!

I called my mom to get my pumpkin roll recipe from her, passed down to me from my aunt, but she couldn't find it!  I finally decided to try this one, and it's great!  Somehow I accidentally only added egg whites to the first one I made, but it came out great.  Even if the cake cracks, you can still work with it.  The filling works as a strong glue, and in the end, people won't care what it looks like because it's so good.

This was a big hit, my husband loved it.  I made a double batch and gave some to friends.  Thanks, I'll make this again and again.  Like others I recommend baking it a bit longer, I also added 1/2 cup of cool whip to the filling.  Very good!

I couldn't believe how fast this was to make. Followed the recipe to a T and it turned out perfectly. The nuts take this cake from 4 to 5 stars for me.

This is a version very close mine. The only thing this one has that mine doesn't is the lemon. I made it exactly as written. I don't understand why people change the ingredients and then rate the recipe. Once you have changed it, it becomes your recipe. Another thing....cool whip? Why would you add this artificial ingredient to a perfectly good recipe. Yuck! Make the pumpkin roll as written. You won't regret it

I just made this today. It was easy and very good, but quite messy to make (all that powdered sugar, just like plaster dust) and very rich. I had a few little cracks in the inside part of the roll, but the outside part of the roll was perfect. I used half splenda and half white sugar in the cake. My daughter had made cream cheese frosting for 100 cupcakes and left the unused portion here, so I put 1-1/2 cups in freezer bowls and froze it. That is the frosting I used, but for the cake part, I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I did differently was to dampen the towel very slightly before sprinkling it with powdered sugar. When I turned the cake out on the towel, the powdered sugar poofed everwhere, so don't have a toaster, clean dishes, etc, sitting near when you do that. I also sprinkled the nuts over the cut slices on the serving plates because I have people who don't like nuts in things. A good recipe!

not sure what I did wrong.  The cake was perfect, no problem rolling...even though it was my first time making a roll cake.  The filling was what I didn't like. First it came out real thick and impossible to spread over whole cake. I added more butter and cheese and a tad of vanilla and some water. then I mixed the initial thick filling into the new thinner mixture. It worked fine. However, the overall texture of the filling was pasty. Next time will do another filling.

This recipe is 1/4 tsp. nutmeg off from one I cut from a newspaper years ago. It also recommended using parchment paper.  Forgive me if this is too obvious, but when releasing the cake from the parchment, don't lift the paper straight up, bring it back low/against itself and it will release without additional tools.  I always roll from the long side and cut into two cakes, wrap in plastic then foil and freeze in a freezer zip bag so that I can whip one out at a moments notice and it is wonderful even months later.  Great recipe. I love this site.

This recipe is awesome! I did make one small substitution. Initially I used walnuts but I found that some of them were bitter. I had just bought the bag but they were probably old. I used instead shaved almonds that I roasted in the oven for a few minutes, let them cool off and then sprinkled them on the batter. PERFECT!

This was easy and delicious. I had no trouble getting the cake to roll up and had no cracks. I do think the ratio of filling to cake was a bit off, but otherwise the recipe is terrific.

This is a crowd favorite! I was pleasantly surprised to find this recipe easier than it seems. This is just as tasty with or without the walnuts. I would recommend keeping the roll in the freezer until the very last minute as it defrosts rather quickly. My kids love it!

Very tasty and easy to make.  If you spray your jelly roll pan well with a flour and oil baking spray, like Baker's Joy, you can completely omit the step of lining your pan with parchment paper.

I made this last night and it really tastes great!  (I omitted the nuts.)  And it just looks so pretty!  My only comment is that you should definitely spray and flour the waxed paper heavily before cooking.  I did a light dusting and had a hard time getting the cake off the paper.

Made today and only thing I chamged was to do 1/4 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp almond in the filling. Was so easy to make and while it did have a crack in one place, it was because of me and not the recipe. I needed to put more powdered sugar on my towel to keep the cake from sticking and pulling. I loved this cake and can't wait to make more!!

This was pretty tasty.  I baked it for only 13 minutes and it came out SUPER moist.  It was hard for me to flip it on to the tea towel so next time I am going to put the tea towel on top and then flip...when I flipped the cake straight down it landed lopsided on the tea towel and I couldn't straighten it.

This recipe is FABULOUS, however you don't want to be making it if you're on a diet of any kind.  LOL  I made it using non stick parchment paper and didn't have to flour and grease anything.  Came off like a charm.  I will definitely be requesting this as my B'day cake. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit. I drizzled chocolate over the cake kind of like a glaze and that added some flavor. But by itself it tastes fine as well. Thanks!

Made this for the first time today.  It is great.  Followed the recipe exactly.   Couldn't be better.  Before I serve new recipes to guests, I always try them out first.  We get a pre-Thanksgiving treat tonight for dessert.

Very good cake. I was nervous making it for the first time but it came out great. I do think I'll try adding whipped cream to the frosting to make it a tad sweeter but its very good the way it is.

Flavor was great but did anyone else have the cake turn out a little tough?  Or is it supposed to be like that to make it sturdy enough to roll?  Otherwise loved the cake and it was fun to make.

I made this for my sister's baby shower. there were about five other desserts there and this was the only one that was GONE! I got several requests for the recipe. My only alteration was thet I omitted the walnuts as my pregnant sister is not a fan. But it was still delish!! I plan on bringing it to Thanksgivng!!

I‚Äôve been making this for years, last year I made them a week before thanksgiving and froze the cakes, I wrapped them in plastic wrap and aluminum foil, works GREAT! I took them out in the afternoon and unwrapped and put them on a plate to thaw we had them for our dessert at dinner time.

Delicious! Moist and just the right amount of sweetness. Nice filling too, I just had a problem with getting it light and fluffy, like I always do with a ll frostings, but that's ok. Really easy to make too. Amazing recipe!

I have made this recipe more than four times now. I simply love it. Although, I haven't perfected it. I have trouble getting it to roll. However,I can get it clean out of the pan as of now.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it turned out wonderfully.  The cake was very pliable - didn't crumble like a cracker when I started to roll it in my pillowcase.  It unrolled beautifully after cooling and easily re-rolled after icing.  I don't think there is a better recipe for a pumpkin roll.  Oh.  And it tastes good, too!!!

I made this for Thanksgiving. I was a little intimidated by the rolling up the cake and letting it cool worried about cracking and such. However, I took the plunge and made it - no cracking of the roll and it tasted great. I took suggestion of another reviewer and used a pillowcase to roll it up in as my kitchen towels are all terry cloth. This pumpkin roll was a big hit with the family and definately a keeper.

This recipe didn't turn out as good as I expected. I wanted to take it to a Thanksgiving potluck at work, but in the end I resorted to my mum's rice. In my opinion, the cake was dry and not fluffy enough. I also would've liked alot more filling than the recipe yielded. I could've made more easily enough, but I didn't want to unroll the cake to add more in and risk it falling apart. Mine didn't crack like it did with other reviewers and overall, it was very easy to make. The taste was good but nothing amazing so while it was fun to try, I won't be making this again.

Absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and used pillowcases to roll up the hot cake.  Once in a while I had a little part crack on me, but nothing major at all and when you add the filling and re-roll you can't even tell.  I've made these twice now for major family holiday events, and they swear this is what I'll be assigned to bring every year now.  YUM!  Thnaks for the recipe!

Wonderful!  My boyfriend couldn't get over how tasty this turned out...it was gone in a day!  I did use a whole package of cream cheese (8 oz) and 1 1/4 cups of powdered sugar for the frosting.  Delicious!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was a hit. Very easy to make. I think it's important to use exact size sheet, 15x10x1. I only had a sheet that was a little bigger so the roll came out a little thinner than I would have liked. I will definitely make it again.

The cake was easy, moist and a nice balance of flavors. Needs to be baked an additional 2-3 minutes.

Although the flavor of the filling is good as directed, it was far too thin for my preference--easily fixed with 1/2 cup of cool whip or whipped cream.

I am a beginner at baking so i didnt have a Jelly roll pan (I didnt know what it was until i googled it;0) I used a ookie baking sheet that was abt 2 inches high on the sides. I put wax paper (forgot the flour) down & poured the batter. I watched it so it wouldnt overflow while in the oven.. I used wax ppr again & coated it w/ flour (this time) because i didnt have that towel that was reccomended either..(still dont know what that was) 
It wasnt pretty because it stuck a tiny bit but it tasted great! I made it last night & it was gone this afternoon

This recipe came out great. I did, however, omit the nuts. I also added 3 Tbsp. of cool-whip to the cream cheese  mixture, and after I spread the cream cheese mixture out on to the cake, I spread more cool-whip on top of that. It was the first thing to go after our weekly Bible study. I will definitely make this again.

I personally don't like pumpkin anything, however, my husband loved this recipe so much that he even made it for himself one time when i wasn't there.  So it must deserve 5 stars.  He's always asking for it and eats it all himself.

I used fresh pumpkin.  The cake part was fluffier than I like it for a pumpkin roll.  It didn't quite look as good, but again, maybe it was because I used fresh.  I also found this recipe to be quite time consuming for me.  But in the end, it did taste good!

I made 2 rolls, the first one I didn't put enough filling in.  I didn't cook either one any longer than 15 mins and the cake was alittle dry?! The second one I took the filling all the way to the edge then cut the ends off after rolling it for a cleaner look. I had  problems with it cracking, they looked alitte lopsided, but taste great.  I'm no chef so it could have been operator error :)

I made this recipe for a church bake sale, and after it was assembled I didn't want to take it.  It smelled and looked wonderful!  Easy to make and gorgeous with the walnuts on the outside!

Excellent!  The cake is moist and has a very pleasing flavor and the cream cheese is delicious!  This cake got RAVES and looks impressive, but is easy to make!  It's a keeper!

This was an easy to do recipe, sounded daunting with having to roll up the cake, but it went great!  My 'picky' family loved it!  I had made two, one to eat and one to share, needless to say we didn't share..... try it you'll like it!

This pumpkin roll was a big hit at a Teacher Appreciation Luncheon.  I used a full 8 oz. cream cheese for the filling and also folded in one cup of Cool Whip into the filling before spreading it. Delicious!

I liked the nuts on the outside of the pumpkin roll, that was different from other pumpkin rolls I've had in the past.  I did feel that the pumpkin flavor was weak though...almost non-existent to very light.  This recipe was easy to make as long as you follow the instructions listed.  Makes a nice presentation.

The only thing I added was 2 tsp of Pumpkin Pie Spice along with the cinnamon.....I like the cake part spicier! Great added flavor as P.P. Spice has ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon in it! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

My cake didn't hold together well when unrolling, and stayed quite moist after, making me think it was undercooked. The final result was very delicious though. the walnuts really added a nice touch, and the simple cream cheese filling was wonderful.

I followed the directions to the letter and brought to a luncheon.  Everyone loved it,  not a crumb left!!    So, I  made another for my family the next day !!  Both were a little greasy though and wondered how i could remedy that? 
 Suggestions?

I have made this so many times.  I love it, my family loves it, even my friends love it.  A a friend of my daughter tried to buy a couple from me.  I made them for her but couldn't take her money.  I love to bake.  It's so easy to make and so impressive.  But most of all, it's delicious.  Be sure to use fresh ginger when you made it.  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!!!!!

I followed the recipe exactly.  I had no problem with making the cake or the assembly of it. It looks great and tastes fine.  The only thing I would change next time is to go for a lighter, fluffier filling.  I find the cream cheese filling just a little too heavy for the cake, otherwise I would have given 5 stars.

I made this recipe twice over the Thanksgiving holiday. On the first roll, I forgot to put the nuts on top of the batter. So I put the nuts on the linen cloth to be rolled out when the cake was done. This worked great.  I also added extra cheese cheese to the frosting. It wasn't as sweet. It also  gave me more frosting for the center. It came out looking beautifully. 
The second one I put the nuts in the batter then cooked it. The roll cracked when I unrolled it. I had a difficult time frosting the roll because of the cracks. The frosting was oozing out the sides. After all this drama, the roll was still excellent.

This is really fun to make. I followed the recipe exactly. Although I found that it lacked flavour somehow I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was missing.

Outstanding! Read the many reviewers tips on technique to prevent cracking and get a perfect result. Per other recipes I used 8oz of cream cheese, added 1/4 tsp ground clove, and omitted the lemon juice.

The only thing I did differently was I used sahran wrap to roll the cake up.  It worked wonderfully.  I used the recipe as it was.  Easy cake to make.  You get a lot of raves.  Puts a smile on my face.  Thank you for the recipe.

I cut the sugar back a bit as suggested by other reviewers, and it had the perfect amount of sweetness. I added the nuts to the filling, not the cake....not on purpose, I simply forgot, but I think I'll just continue to add to the filling as it added that extra something.

I made this Gluten Free using Bob's 1 to 1 gluten free flour.  I was a little nervous but didn't have a choice.  It was wonderful!  Gluten Free cakes tend to be a little crumbly so I was happy to have read the review saying you could make a trifle if it failed.  However, it didn't!  I had one small crack but you couldn't even notice.  Thank you SO much for the wonderful recipe.  Sure to be a regular favorite in my family.

Everyone loved this cake!  I ended up lining a jelly roll pan with wax paper and greasing the wax paper with butter.  The cake was easy to remove without tearing.

I start with just the egg yolks and beat them to a lemon yellow in color.  Then Ibeat the egg whites separately until they are stiff and firm.

I've always wanted to make one of these, but it was intimidating !!I had some frozen homemade pumpkin puree in the freezer, that I wanted to use up, so Made this. The cake part is very light and tender,  but the filling is very heavy!! Not a good combo. I would probably make again, but I'll try another filling next time. Maybe a whipped cream /pudding combo. Thx!

I wasn't sure which recipe I used to make my previous pumpkin rolls as I wrote it down and just used my recipe card...after looking though I believe THIS IS IT. Same ingredients.  My only input is to use real lemon juice and I buy the best vanilla extract I can and I cut up vanilla beans and put in it so the little black vanilla specks come out.  ITS NUMMY and this is all anyone asks me for Christmas present.  MAKE THIS ONE!!!!

Made for Thanksgiving dessert and it was delicious and everyone raved about it. Easy to make, I had no problems with the rolling. Make sure you use wax or parchment paper that has been sprayed with cooking spray (I use PAM for baking) so it doesn't stick.

I have made this three times. The first two times exactly as is.  The last time I made a few changes to make the filling sweeter.  I used 12 ounces of cream cheese, 6 tablespoons of butter, a cup and a half of powdered sugar, and 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  Also left out the nuts the last time. There were no leftovers. I also highly recommend using parchment paper rather than wax paper.

Just made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out really well.   Would definitely make it again.  The only thing I would do differently is to make it a couple of days ahead of time and refrigerate it.  It was even better after it had "set" a couple of days.

This recipe isn't correct.   I had to omit it and bake it for half hour for it to turn out. I omitted for  1/4 tsp salt 1/2 tsp of each baking soda and baking powder.  Kept the rest the same all but didn't mix eggs  for 5 mins. I just mixed a few mins and gradually  added the sugar then did the rest from there. I ruined 3 rolls by following this recipe . Only giving 2 stars.

I had never made a pumpkin roll before. I found this recipe last year and everyone loved it including my daughter and husband who hate pumpkin! I made it again this year and it turned out perfectly again. It is easy to make and has just the right amount of spice to not be overpowering. My kids helped me make it this year and we will be making it again for many years to come. We even made an extra this year while we were making the mess and put it in the freezer for Christmas... If it makes it that long!!!

This roll tastes great.  I would not use the wax paper on the pan again.  It stuck to the cake even tho I sprayed twice and floured as directed.  I didn't have this problem when I used the pan without the wax paper in another recipe.  I forgot to add the nuts but added them on top of the cream filling.  I think they would have been better in the batter but still enjoyed the flavor they gave.

I love this recipe so much! This is my third roulade/roll that I've done and I really like this one! I didn't change anything and I added supreme Saigon cinnamon (it's a sweet scent cinnamon) and it was amazing!!!!!!

First time making this. My baking pan that was closest in size was 2" longer. Lol Oops! I believe it will taste just fine though. It's nice making something than just pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving! Looking forward to trying this again but perhaps next time with a pie pumpkin; they're kind of hard to find at the commissary here in Japan.

Great recipe.  I just made 4 of them.  I flip the roll onto a kitchen towel that is loaded with confectionery sugar.  I roll them up immediately and let them cool.  The sugar soaks into the cake.  YUM.

Very good! Used 8 oz cream cheese to make extra filling. Used a damp towel sprinkled with powdered sugar. Sprayed the wax paper on the cookie sheet really well, and it came off just fine. Cooked in about 9-10 mins. Wrapped in foil after, and put in freezer for about 40 mins before serving.

I found that baking at 375 degrees F for 15 minutes left my pumpkin roll cake over baked, especially around the edges.  It may be the new oven, but I've not had this problem at 350 degrees before.  Great recipe though.  I made two this evening and gave one to my neighbor.  Happy Baking.

Great recipe for pumpkin roll! A few things I have learned making these over the years... Wax paper will work, but parchment is MUCH better to use. I spray my pan, put down the parchment, then spray again before adding my batter. Just run a small, sharp knife around the edge between the cake and the pan when you are ready to turn it out and it should come out beautifully! I also skip the lemon juice and add some freshly grated nutmeg. I often do not add the nuts (personal preference), but when I do, they are pretty finely ground. This is my most requested dessert recipe over the holidays. A real winner!!

One thing I noticed immediately upon reading both the good and bad reviews, DO NOT use waxpaper.... the correct paper to use for ANY and ALL baking is called PARCHMENT. (hello?? wax melts with heat!!) This is what all of us professionals in the baking industry use.

What a great recipe!!!! Followed it exactly, until I realized I forgot the walnuts in the cake. Ended up pounding them down rather fine and incorporated them into the icing. As a personal preference, I added 1/2 cup pumpkin to the icing because I don't really like cream cheese and wanted to cut down on its flavor. The reviewer who recommended extra long wax paper was right on - VERY helpful to maneuver the cake!! And when it comes to removing the wax paper from the cake, just go slow and the cake will come off without issue! That's not a step to rush! Thanks for posting it and all the feedback.. Will definitely make this again!

The flavor was good, everyone loved that, but the cake broke into about 8 pieces when I unwrapped it to fill it. It could have had something to do with using fresh pumpkin instead of canned, so I can't blame the recipe too much.

I wish the pumpkin rolls weren't so easy to crack they only thing I can think of is the cake isn't totally cool before I impatiently try to unroll and apply the cream :( ....I did layer my towel with powdered sugar any suggestions feel free to comment besides that they are so delishious!!!! ?? I have my second one cooling now I was making these constantly a few years ago and had become an expert now I need to just have a few trial runs I suppose...my first one cracked (so disappointing) my second one of the night is cooling in the fridge now so we shall see, hopefully a little better turn out rolling & unrolling . I also immediately lay on cloth out of the oven...

YES YES YES!!! It came out perfect. I didn't change anything and it was amazing. I did however chill the filling before putting it on the cake where it would stay in place better and I also used a new pillow case to roll it.  My FAVORITE recipe I have tried on here so far.

The wax paper caught fire in my oven. Just skip step 4 and replace with un-greased parchment paper. I made this with homemade buttercream and it tasted great! 4 stars if it wasn't for the small fire.

The first time I made this roll, I didn't read the recipe well and didn't beat the eggs for five minutes.  The cake was very moist and dark pumpkin colored.  This time, I beat the eggs for five minutes.  The cake color is much lighter, and the consistency is lighter.  I like my first one better!  Everyone LOVES this Pumpkin Roll.  Thanks for the recipe!

My go-to Pumpkin Roll recipe. I always separate the eggs and divide the sugar (beat 1/2 c sugar with yolks and 1/2 c sugar with whites). It makes a big difference. Also, using greased wax paper on the pan really helps. My family requests this at every holiday dinner.

This pumpkin roll is a favorite in my family! It's easy to make, doesn't require a ton of ingredients, and it's super tasty! So far, I have made this recipe 3 times and it turned out great every time! My daughter's aren't big fans of pumpkin pie, but they LOVE this treat! I followed the recipe step by step and didn't make any changes and it turned out amazing! Thank you for the recipe!

Turn out fantastic!  I didn't have any walnuts so had to skip them. Used some pumpkin I had previous frozen -just pur√©ed it in the food processor.   My pan was 12x18 so I was a little worried it would be too thin, but it worked fine.  Everyone loved it and the house smelled incredible.

Tastes great. It was a bit more difficult to roll because of the nuts, but I managed, and it was worth it.  I sprinkle powdered sugar over the cake roll.

this was a hit.  I made several to sell at Thanksgiving last year.  the first "tester" roll, no one liked the lemon juice so I took that out.  I also added a sprinkle or two of cinnamon in the filling for one customer and she was like this is awesome.

LIKE OMG WOW. Followed this recipe through and it turned out way better than expected. My first time making a roll, and this recipe made it look like I was pro.

Things I changed:

Used white whole wheat flour instead of AP flour.
Swapped 1/4 c coconut oil (solidified) in place of butter
Chose 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese 

Also I used a cookie sheet because I didn't have a jelly roll pan. The cake came out thinner than in the video. I also didn't use wax paper (didn't have any), I just sprayed the sheet with cooking spray (canola) and floured it. The cake stuck to the sheet a little bit, but I pryed it with a flat metal spatula and it turned out okay. The cake also cracked a little bit when I unrolled it from the towel but when I rolling it after spreading the cream cheese mixture, it wasn't a problem. 

Make sure to dazzle plenty of powdered sugar on your kitchen towel!

This recipe is GOLDDDDDDD.

I tried to make this twice, and it did not turn out. Have never had a problem with pumpkin rolls before. Followed it to the letter- the cake fell apart when trying to remove the waxed paper. The wax paper simply would not release. Tried baking without wax paper, same problem.

Not bad. Overmixed or overcooked the first time and turned out slightly tough. Also whipped cream filling would be much better instead of buttercream, it was too dense/rich.

This is so wonderful! My mom began making this years ago at holiday parties, and she has NEVER taken it anywhere people didn't rant and rave about how great it is. I have been making it also, and it is always a huge hit. We have both had people offer to pay us to make them a roll, HA HA Maybe we should take them up on that!

I just tried this recipe last night. It was amazing! GREAT recipe! I actually substituted regular flour for almond flour to make the pumpkin roll gluten-free. Gluten-free cakes have a tendency to crumble and with having to roll the cake I thought for sure it would get destroyed. But it stayed moist and perfectly in tact the entire process and the cream cheese filling kept it moist and delicious! Very happy with this.

Works great and is not hard at all if you have a very large, thin tea towel. I added a bit of lemon zest to the filling and it was sublime. Everyone loved it. Make it a day ahead and refridgerate. It cuts better as well as tasing better the second day.

Easily made roll.  My cake didn't fall apart at all.  I used a Silpat to line my pan (could try parchment paper too) so it was easy to get out and invert.  I had to be careful pulling it off the cake so this could be a tough recipe without a liner!  I didn't have any problem with it sticking to the towel but I was generous with the amount of powdered sugar I sprinkled on it.  I will definitely do this recipe again, but I have a better cream cheese frosting that I will try instead.  This one is good but I am going for a knock out.

Delicious! I made this w/o nuts because the hubby didn't like nuts. Other than the missing nuts, made it exactly as written. It tasted like a bakery made roll cake. Hubby asked if I was going to make more so he could take it to work. Important to check your cake as I forgot to do so with mine. Mine was done less than 15 minutes I left it in my oven the full 15 min. I had a little hard dark edges trimmed it off & rolled it. Important to cool it completely before filling it.

Easy, delicious light cake base with yunmmy cream cheese filling.  Reminiscent of carrot cake - but lighter with no added fat to batter.  Intend to wow the rest of the family tomorrow for Thanksgiving.  Of course I had to trim the ends for my husband and I for dessert tonight, right?  Can't have raggedy ends, right?  Methinks this will be our new favourite!  New twist?  Any plain-cooked winter squash would stand in admirably for pumpkin, if unavailable.

This was really nice. Very moist and a good cake to cream cheese ratio. The instructions worked well, and I only got one crack in the whole cake which I rolled to the side. It was so good though, nobody noticed!

This recipe was easier than I thought and tasted great!  I used pumpkin pie spice and canned pumpkin.  Next time I will use a fresh pumpkin because the cake did not really have enough of a pumpkin flavor for my liking.  Nonetheless, still a great recipe.

I was a little scared during the rolling and unrolling process but using a fully powdered linen towel made it pretty easy.  I added 8 TBSP of Cool Whip as some suggested and it made the filling a little sweeter.  I got a lot of compliments with this and will definitely make it again.

Followed directions exactly. I was hesitant about rolling a cake up in a towel, but I did it anyway. Next time I will you regular sarane rap (as another reviewer suggested) instead, cause I'd rather not have to clean another towel with powdered sugar all over it.  I also may cut down on the butter because I felt that it made the frosting a bit too rich. oh any maybe pecans instead of walnuts.

This recipe is super simple and easy to follow. This is the first cake roll I have ever baked!!! I did use the advice of the other reviews. I used parchment paper, added 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp pumpkin spice, and used a pillow case to turn the cake onto. So extremely delicious.

Yummmmmm. I love pumpkin roll, and this recipe is a great rendition!  I always substitute whole wheat pastry flour for the white flour in baked goods, but even with the extra crumble potential, I was able to roll the cake without it splitting ... much.  (I just pressed it back together, and after refrigerating, it sliced cleanly without falling apart.) Good thing I had guests that weekend -- I might have eaten the entire thing myself otherwise!  (I think I had 4 pieces, even so.)

Wonderful flavor!!! My whole family (small children even) LOVED this. Sooooo good. Took some time and skill to make- haven't done a jelly-roll type of dessert before, so I learned while I went. Definitely will want to use more powdered sugar on the towel next time. It stuck to it! But we salvaged what we could and it was still VERY tasty :)

I made this for Easter as dessert and it was absolutely delicious!!  I was a bit nervous as this was my first time making a roll cake and it seemed a bit complicated but it was actually quite simple!!  I didn't have any nutmeg and used dark brown sugar instead of white sugar, and this cake still tasted amazing...proved by my husband, who had 3 servings!

This was delicious and fairly easy.  I did not use nuts because I have small children and they do not like nuts.  I had a little trouble with removing the waxed paper from the edges and I want to try parchment paper next time.  I was pretty intimidated by the turning out and rolling process, but both were easy.

I only gave it 4 as I am not a big fan of cream cheese, but it is absolutely delicious. I did do a few things different though. I use fat free cream cheese instead of regular. and I use fresh pumpkin instead of can, as I am a fanatic on using fresh as opposed to canned/frozen items. I made it last year and it was gone as soon as i got it on the table.

Excellent. I was so glad one reviewer posted that she forgot to grease and flour the paper as I did too. I guess I can't read well as it was right there in front of me and yet I still forgot to do it. I did what her "wonderful" husband suggested and he saved the day for me too:). This is a keeper.

This recipe is so delicious. I loved the cream cheese frosting that is layered inside. I wouldn't change a single thing about this recipe. It came out beautiful and tasty. I thought the rolling process would be difficult, but it is easier than you would think. I will definitely be making this again!

note to self:  you're crazy about this, but you don't care too much about the nuts.  it's only good for presentation.  actually, your family loves the nuts so keep it in.  and one is never EVER enough.  eat especially when chilled.

Since I seem to be the only one reviewing this that was not impressed, I am confused!  I followed others advice about adding Cool Whip and using Neufch√¢tel instead of cream cheese. I used the powdered wax paper, had no problems with that or rolling it up. But it was unattractive and unspecial. I did not like the walnuts with the pumpkin, either. Guests were not impressed.  This one is not for me!

This was a hit with my friends! I took the advise of another reviewer and added almond extract to the filling instead of vanilla and "wow" did it taste great. I made the error of rolling it inside out (nuts on the outside), but that actually made it look more like a real log. Also just used a heavy hand with the non stick spray and there was no need for paper in the pan. All in all it was surprisingly easy. Definitely making this again!

I found this to be a very good recipe and fun to put together. One change I did make though and only for personal preference is that I deleted the nutmeg and added 1/8 tsp. ground cloves.

I made this yesterday for a family treat. :] I didn't put wax paper in the pan, I just greased and floured it really good. I had a little trouble getting it out of the pan after it was done cooking. :l I didn't come out as a perfect rectangle at all.. just a huge ball of..cake. I will use wax paper next time. x] So I took the rollin-pin and made it kind of into a rectangle. I chilled and then added the cream cheese. Wow, the cream cheese was DELICIOUS by the way..I had about 1/2 left over though because i used a different sized pan. If you have strawberries I would recommened eating your left over cream cheese with that, it's DELICIOUS! :D Anyways...mine didn't turn out as beautiful as the picture but I bet it tasted just as great. I only have one slice left in the fridge [everyone is eating it up] :P

This is both delicious and fool-proof, which makes it a keeper in my book!  I use low-fat cream cheese and also add some maple flavoring to the filling.  One of my hubby's favorites!

Well, even though I didn't have much luck when it came to rolling this up, the taste made up for how bad it looked!  I had made pumpkin rolls before without problems, but this one cracked on me.  Luckily it was just for us and we didn't care what it looked like.  Very nice flavor and texture though, would make again and hope for better luck when rolling!

This recipe turned out well on whole. The cake is not too sweet and has a unique flavour due to the cream cheese and pumpkin taste. However, roll was difficult to remove from the towel, though this may be because I did not use linen. The cake cracked resulting in a less than picture perfect aesthetic. The icing inside held the cake together nicely and is delicious. The walnuts improved the look and added a nice texture. I made sure I did not take the cake out of the oven too soon so it would not be overly moist. Next time I make this roll I will add icing sugar to the towel and see if that helps with the stickiness.

I love the fact that nuts are in this...gives it a great texture.  And what could be better than cream cheese frosting.  Directions were very clear which made for ease in removing it from the pan onto the towel and doing the whole rolling process.  Thank you for a great recipe.  I'm serving it for Thanksgiving this year.

Excellent.  I was always envious of my sister making this in the past but thought I would try it and it was easy.  Followed the recipe as is except did not add nuts.  Thanks.

This is a very good basic recipe for pumpkin roll.  The filling can get a little soft so add more sugar as necessary.  For variation, add a tsp of ginger to the cake as one reviewer suggested or use almond extract in place of vanilla in the filling.

Great recipe!  Used a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg and also added a little ginger to help with the flavor.  Also used all 8 oz of cream cheese and a little less confect. sugar.  Was a hit at Thanksgiving...can't wait to make it at Christmas!!

I made this recipe last Thanksgiving, and we loved it so much that I made 4 more during the Christmas season as gifts and it quickly became a favorite.  Now, I'm returning again this year to make more!  It's easy, tasty, sweet, pumkiny, and a great gift from the heart to friends who dessert the best this year :)

This took some work, and looked a bit lopsided until I sliced it.  Delish and the slices were beautiful swirls.
