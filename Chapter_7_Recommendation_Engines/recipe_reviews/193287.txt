This is a very good recipe, especially the chicken coating.  I put buffalo sauce on the chicken and omitted the horseradish.  Was excellent.

This is actually pretty darn good.  I even made my own waffles, though I think store bought ones would be just as good (and easier).  The sweetness of the maple syrup contrasts really well with the spicy chicken. I will definitely make it again.

5 stars plus.  This is a very different, yet incredibly awesome recipe, and it falls under the category of so odd that it has to be good.  The sauce is what intrigued me about this one.  It is absolutely tremendous.  DO NOT change this recipe at all, or skimp and buy el cheapo chicken strips, even if you think they are good.  Make this recipe exactly how it says to make it, with the exception of the waffles.  Make fresh waffles.  Frozen waffles have no flavor, and if you get a nice, sweet waffle mix, the contrast between the sweetness of the waffles and the sauce, and the saltiness of the bacon along with the heat of the chicken is an awesome combination.  I have made this for many many groups of friends, and everyone says it is absolutely delicious, and wonderfully unique.  If you get complaints on this one, you made it wrong.

Wow! This was a big hit with the entire family. The kids were full of ummmm's and yumm's and my husband couldn't stop raving about it. My husband gave it 11 out of 10 stars and my baby girl said it deserves infinity stars. Granted it is not the most healthy meal but it doesn't hurt to indulge every now and then. I made my own 9" waffles using one of the recipes on the site. I also used 4 good sized chicken breast that I cut into about 16 chicken tenders. From there I followed the recipe however I substituted horseradish for baconaise sauce, buttermilk instead of heavy cream, and 3 teaspoons of regular mustard instead of 1 teaspoon of dry mustard powder. We didn't have any bacon to go with these but it wasn't needed. Slapped some velveeta on these babies, broiled them, added the yummy sauce, a lil bit of lettuce, then pressed them down and sliced each one in half. Because I used 9" waffles they turned out HUGE!!! My husband was the only one that was able to finish his but not for lack of trying. I almost finished half of one, my 5 year old eat about 1/4 of one and my 7 and 13 year old also eat half. Between the 5 of us we could have gotten away with just 3 waffles instead of 4. I was skeptical about putting the mayonnaise sauce with spicy chicken and waffles but it was a delicious, flavorful, and unique experience. Excellent for a fathers day breakfast/brunch or any special occasion that requires a hearty meal.

When I first saw this recipe, I really wanted to make it. I've heard about chicken and waffles for years but never tried them. What held me back was the hi calories of the recipe, so I used lower fat cal versions of the same items in this recipe and it was awesome. I used a morningstar farms chicken patti, nutrigrain waffles, weight watchers cheese and fat free mayo and turkey pepper bacon  I add the cayenne that would have gone inthe chicken coating in the sauce. This turned out really well.. I loved it. I can only imagine how awesome it is with the higher cal ingredients.

I used 4 chicken breasts that were cut smaller and lightly pounded instead of chicken tenders (or is that the same thing?). For the egg mixture, I only used a teaspoon of each seasoning as using a tablespoon of each seemed wasteful and unnecessary flavour-wise. That said, I would probably use an egg or two less next time and substituted soy milk for the heavy cream. For the dry mixture I omitted the salt. Next time I'd use a 1:1 ratio for the flour and cornstarch as there was plenty leftover, even after double dipping. I didn't have peanut oil, so I used vegetable oil. I did not deep-fry; I did them chicken in a pan with the oil as needed and did them in batches. The sauce is delicious! I probably used only a half cup of mayo (whatever was left in my small jar) and added everything it and shook it to combine. I didn't have prepared horseradish but had the dry (powder) kind so I used two teaspoons of that; I'd probably do 1:1 ratio for the mustard and horseradish powders next time. The maple syrup was spot on. Had to skip the bacon and used processed cheese slices. I used regular waffles this time around, but would use Belgian ones next time as they are larger and easier to grip (maybe make homemade cornmeal Belgian waffles? I seriously have to get a waffle-maker!). I also added lettuce and tomato to my sandwich. DELICIOUS! Served it with some cinnamon-spiced sweet potato fries from AR. Definitely going to make it again.

Let me start by saying that I never would have tried this if it hadn't had 10 5 start ratings.  It sounded so disgusting that I had to try it.  I never would have thought that these ingredients would taste good at all.  I'm so glad I gave it a chance, because it was delicious!  

I made a few minor changes, I omitted the bacon and cheese.  I made the sauce as written and for the chicken, I only reduced the cayenne and black pepper because I'm not huge fan of spicy.  I used 6 full chicken breasts sliced into "tenders" and there was plenty of the egg/cream and flour mixtures.  I think if you were actually going to use 6 tenders, those could both be halved so as not to waste.  

The sauce was amazing, and the chicken+sauce+waffles combo was out of this world.  Crunchy, sweet, a little spicy.  8 of us ate this and everyone loved it.

Also, we had both homemade and frozen waffles, and everyone liked the frozen waffles better.

Very easy and super tasty. I'll be making this again. The only change I made was to also make homemade waffles instead of using frozen.

I give this a five. I didn't make as a sandwich but placed the chicken on the waffle and drizzled with honey. The sweet and salty flavor works well together. Thanks for sharing.

Had chicken and waffles in a restaurant for the first time a few weeks ago.  I wanted to try to make it and found this recipe.  Amazing!!! Much better than what I had in the restaurant.

Excellent fried chicken recipe, but there is absolutely no need to waste 2 CUPS of flour and 1 CUP of cornstarch on this... you really end up using a fraction of the flours and have to throw out the rest because it's full of chicken juices!

First time I had this ever, so I'm really happy I chose this recipe!! I was startled by the amount of cayenne and cut it in half. Big mistake on my part, there was no heat. But still... omg, so freakin delish!! I made homemade waffles with this and it was just good eatin'. No other way to describe it!!

I loved this recipe. At first I tried it with frozen waffles and found that they were somewhat soggy at the end. On my second attempt I made savory spiced waffles in my waffle iron and found it was not soggy.  To melt the cheese I put the sandwiches in my toaster oven.  The family raved!!

I chose this for the fried chicken recipe. I used waffle mix for waffles, and didn't make it into a sandwich. My family wouldnt' eat it if I used the sandwich. The fried chicken part is flawless, but I felt needed a tad more salt. I never add salt to my food, but thought this needed a bit more. It really worked well. It was my second time to fry chicken, and this recipe works! The secret must be the 20 minute rest time.

I was skeptical about the sauce, but made it anyways. I didn't care for the sauce by itself, but it complements the chicken very well and added another dimension to the flavor. The sauce was a great counterbalance to the gentle heat of the chicken.   I also made homemade Belgian waffles to go with the chicken and sauce.  My picky family said this is definitely a "make it again" recipe.

Way too much breading left over.  I was reluctant to put all that cayenne pepper in for fear it would be too spicy, but it was good.  Top waffle cold (frozen) and bottom waffle soggy.  Chicken tasted great.

First time chicken fryer here. Turned out delicious. I double dipped my tendies and then breaded them with corn flake crumbles. It was a lot of work for just chicken and waffles but definitely worth it if you’re cooking for a group. Make sure to clean up before you start eating or you won’t be able to move.

I made my own waffles with a zucchini waffle recipe because this recipe is lacking in vegetables.  The sauce for this recipe is worth the 4 stars on its own though.  This is a pretty great chicken and waffles recipe.

This recipe is PERFECT!  I followed it exactly as written.  My husband and children loved it.  The only thing I regret is that we can only have it once a year due to it's caloric intake.  ;)

I substituted chicken strips for the tenders.  It was surprisingly good!
My mother ate the whole thing and usually only eats less than half as much.  She loved it so I WILL make it again.

I'm giving this 5 stars for the chicken alone! Additional fried chicken hints I've picked up from commercial kitchens: The colder the chicken, the better for adherence. Slice boneless breasts (I used 3) into thick strips while still slightly frozen before soaking in the egg mixture, or soak in ice water first and use well-chilled eggs. Don't be afraid to really roll and gently squeeze the tenders if you want a good, thick, crusty coating; don't just shake them in the flour. 6 stars from my hungry 7yo son!

What a nice treat!  I wouldn't want to have them on a regular basis, but these are very good.  All the skeptics at my house loved them, as well.  They would even be great for a rare breakfast treat!  I was unsure about the sauce, but it was perfect.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Switzer!!  We love it!

I made this tonight with rave reviews from the family...but I did modify a bit. Rather than serve as sandwiches, we opted for open face. And, I made homemade waffles.  I used 1/2 the cayenne because of my 6-year old and didn't bother with the cheese.  So, I placed sauce, bacon & chicken on top of my waffles and drizzled a little extra sauce over.  Awesome dinner!

After reading the reviews for this recipe, I had very high hopes; surprisingly and unfortunately, they weren't met. I rated this higher than I felt my dinner was, because of some of the substitutions I had to make. I think part of the blame fell upon my choice of waffle, I used a buckwheat multi-grain Belgian and while they are excellent topped with fruit or syrup, the taste was off w/this recipe. The sauce was really good and was the favorite portion of tonight's dinner. For the chicken, I made 16 strips w/half the portions of the batter called for and still had some of each left over. I did run out of cayenne pepper at just over 3/4 TBS. I subbed in my mix of gluten free flours for the wheat flour.  (This has become my go-to fried foods mix; I can actually say I like it so much more than wheat flour and even if I could eat wheat, I would use this mix for frying.) I used the other spices as directed and actually felt the chicken was rather plain. It was ok, but did not have the kick or flavor I was expecting. My family said it was good enough. I think next time I would stick w/my usual recipe for chicken tenders and adding more cayenne.  I will try this again w/a more neutral tasting waffle and probably just use my flour recipe w/o the cornstarch. Also, I would recommend putting sauce on both the top and bottom waffles as well as it was a bit dry overall.

I stumbled upon this by accident, and it intrigued me, so I just had to try it...What a great find! This was really, REALLY good! I was worried that the amount of cayenne would be too much, but it was actually perfect, and made a nice balance of  spicy/sweet w/ the maple syrup mayo, which was yummy. Made as written and would not change a thing! This is a nice change from the usual chicken sandwich, and one that I will def be making again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

needs more flavoring in the flour- also I used 1/2 of the recipe for a large boneless breast cut into tender like pieces- still had a lot of flour & egg mixture left.  Will try again.

"This might just be one of the best foods on Earth," said my 11-year-old son.    I followed the recipe pretty closely, except for making them open-faced instead of sandwiches, and on leftover homemade waffles.  Oh, and I used potato starch since I didn't have corn starch - and only used half the flour mixture (which still turned out to be more than adequate). I despise horseradish, so I initially divided the mayo sauce in half and only put horseradish in one of the bowls...but I tasted both and the one with horseradish was better.  And crazy enough, I ended up adding 1/2 tsp extra horseradish.   (My husband doesn't like mayonnaise and I wanted to mask the mayo flavor a little. )  I was worried that without any sauce on the bottom waffle, it would be too dry, but the combination of the crispy chicken, bacon, cheese, and sauce  worked perfectly and dryness wasn't an issue.     The flavors and textures were all perfect together.  Fantastic recipe!

Made it exactly as directed and husband loved it.  One is a meal. We were too full to eat a side salad and my husband is a big eater!  Have since seen versions of this on restaraunt menues but they are small.

Great recipe! I made my own waffles instead of frozen and left them open faced. My wife, who said she never thought she'd like the combination now requests it several times a month. But she believes anything with bacon is perfect.

Delicious.  The sauce is to die for.  This recipe is a lot of work but well worth the time and effort.  I made my favorite home made waffles as the thought of frozen gave me shivers. Divine.

Okay folks, been wanti g to try chicken and waffles for a while now and finally decided to give it a try...I followed the recipe to a tee and the meal was awesome! My family of 3 who scoffed their noses at this idea of chicken mixed with waffles could not get enough of it! My only suggestion to anybody is the waffle on top is almost too much..all of us ended up taking the top waffle off and one point or another. The change I made to the recipe was to semi toast the bottom waffle since some reviewers said that they bottom waffle became soggy..I also toasted the top waffle like I would have made it for breakfast and then put on top.

This recipe is awesome! We have it like every other week. Like other members, I thought that 2 tablespoons of cayenne pepper would be too much, so I cut it in half. I also halved the breading, and was still able to "double bread" the chicken. The family is not horseradish friendly, so I omitted it on their sandwiches, but added it to mine. The horseradish really makes the sandwich. It is such a conglomeration of flavors! Somewhat putzy, but Really, REALLY worth a try! Thanks for the recipe!

My husband absolutely loved this recipe. I am not a fan of greasy food, but I liked it. The flavor is a perfect blend of sweet, salty and spicy. I made my own waffles, with Bisquick. However, the directions on the back of the box didn't give me enough waffles - but that has nothing to do with the directions for this recipe - just something to keep in mind if you use Bisquick. I added lettuce too - ya gotta have something fresh and green, I think.
