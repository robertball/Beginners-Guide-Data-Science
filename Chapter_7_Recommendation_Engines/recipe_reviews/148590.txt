This recipe is pretty good. I wouldn't have thought to put imitation crab and red beets into vegetable soup, and for that idea I am thankful.  I used different veggies based on what I had at home (fresh onion, carrot, celery, red pepper, potato, canned lima beans and tomato, and frozen peas).  The only thing I would do differently would be to not roast the beets.  I don't think it's necessary because the beets will soften if you simmer the soup long enough, and they were much sloppier to peel after roasting than if I had done it while they were raw.

Beet flavor was too overpowering in the soup.

This soup was surprisingly delicious.  I, too, did not roast the beets. I used the beets we froze this summer from our garden. They cooked firm and tender. Also, i didn't have crab, so I used the perch we had in the freezer from our fishing trip. I cooked the filet pieces right in the soup. The perch cooked well and did not fall apart. This soup had great textures and was delightfully sweet and hearty. Great comfort food for a cold winter day.
