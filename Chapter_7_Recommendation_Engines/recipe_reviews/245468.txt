This was different! It has a sweet garlicy taste.  I am a garlic lover so I added a bit more garlic, not a good idea. Also, I would saute the garlic  or roast it first.  I don't eat wheat so no pita for me. I tried tortilla chips, no, they don't work w/ this. I think it makes a good salad dressing if you like sweet & creamy, which I do not. I think I will just eat it with a spoon. I will probably not make it again. The system would not let me post a photo. I ended up giving it to my neighbor Carolyn.
