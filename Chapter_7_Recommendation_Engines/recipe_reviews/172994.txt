I had a bunch of leftover celery that I didn't want to waste and wanted to make a celery soup without a bunch of cream. I found this recipe and it was really great. I did not find it too lemony at all. The small amount of red wine really gives it some depth. Very good. Used dried spices as that's all I had.

Although I like bold flavors, this tasted weird to me.  I did substitute oregano and Italian seasoning for the thyme and basil, but I don't think it was those spices that made it taste strange.  I think its the wine.  Maybe not so much?  Also, I wouldn't puree the soup.  It turned out brown.  Maybe reduce the broth by half so it creates more of a "stew" consistency and leave the veggies as they are.

I like this very much. Did not puree the vegetables. I preferred the crunchy taste. Might also substitute lime juice for lemon juice for a different taste.

Loved it!  We needed to use up a bunch of celery and this recipe sounded like a great alternative to traditional cream of celery.  It was light and refreshing.

A good recipe but a little to "lemony" for our taste.  After ladeling into bowls I drizzled a little EVVO on top.

In submitting this recipe, I forgot to write that I use chicken stock, not broth.  Kitchen Basics makes the best low sodium store- bought version, but of course, nothing beats your own :)

I loved this recipe, I lke it because is light, basically you are eating vegies, with out the extra calories (i.e cream) and it fills you up. the lemony taste is refreshing.

Actually called this "Snowed in Celery Soup". Luckily I had everything on hand since I couldn't go grocery shopping. It was an Okay soup.

I did this recipe in less steps.

I did not use oil, since I pureed the raw veggies in the blender (I have a Vita-Mix): 4 cups water, the onion, celery, potatoes, bay leaf and I also added about 2 Tbsp fresh Rosemary before cooking.

I then transferred to a pot and added 4 tsp bullion, ground thyme, basil, parsley, juice and I used spicy sea salt. Brought to a boil, stirred well and simmered on low 1 hour.

No red wine, lime juice instead of lemon juice, water and bullion instead of chicken broth.

I based my soup on this recipe because of the amount it makes. I substituted based on what ingredients I had on hand. I always blend my soup veggie and fresh spices raw. It is faster and safer.

Apparently the wine added a lot of the flavor. I did not like the way the flavor of mine turned out. I served 1 1/2 cups of the soup to test. Then I added 1 small can of chicken. This improved the taste for me.

I substituted cauliflower for the potatoes and use fresh thyme and dried for the rest. It turned out very good.

I used rose wine, I didn’t have red, I didn’t taste the wine really, but the lemon really makes the flavor special! I ate the whole recipe, all the servings, myself, at one sitting, it was that good!

I used veggie stock, dried basil, garlic, salt, pepper and lime; no thyme or parsley.  At the end I used my immersion blender to blend it up and added some Braggs and it was great.  Great soup for when you have celery to use up, but don't want to have a calorie laden cream soup.

Made just a few changes.  Used white wine instead of red.  I am leaving for vacation so I added other veggies I needed to use, cauliflower, leeks, carrots, mashed potatoes instead of the 2 white potatoes.  Didn't have any thyme, wish I did because it would really make this soup.  I like it!
