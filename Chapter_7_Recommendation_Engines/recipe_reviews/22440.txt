This recipe was a great starting point. I made the following changes: greatly reduced the Lemon Pepper - just lightly sprinkled less than a tablespoon. Used 1 tablespoon melted butter. Also sprinkled with a small amount of garlic powder (about 1 tsp.). Added grated parmesan cheese during the last 5 minutes of cooking. I can understand why others thought even one tablespoon of Lemon Pepper was too much - the citrus really comes through.  Thanks for the idea, JJ!

This was delicious! After reading the other reviews, I dipped the zucchini slices into a mixture of melted butter, lemon pepper, garlic powder and a "tish" of dill weed.  I also sprinkled the tops with Parmesan cheese.  Will definitely make again...soon!

When I made this, I used spray butter, lemon pepper, and parm cheese.  My husband really liked them, but I think I'd prefer them with just salt & pepper and Italian 6-cheese blend sprinkled on top.  A word of advice - make sure you slice the zucchini THICK, otherwise they'll get over-done and be a little on the crusty side.

YUM! I am not a zucchini person and neither is my bf, but we scarfed these down so fast! I did not have lemon pepper on hand, so I mixed 1T melted butter and 1/2T fresh squeezed lemon juice into a bowl and dipped the sliced zucchini into the mixture. I then sprinkled garlic salt + cayenne pepper + grated parmesan cheese on the tops of the coated zucchini. I baked at 375 for 15 minutes and they came out PERFECTLY. Absolutely delicious and simple to make. Thanks!

I thought this was very tasty. I used 2 really small zucchini and way less lemon pepper. I just melted enough butter to top and sprinkled with lemon pepper and I would go a bit lighter with it next time. It is a very strong seasoning. I also sprinkled with dill weed. I baked at 350 instead of 400 for 15 min. and it came out perfect.Thanks JJ!

My husband grew me a beautiful garden in our new home and it's full of Zucchini and Yellow Squash. I was on this site all day yesterday looking for all sorts of recipes and this one didn't turn me on.  I tried it last minute yesterday and I'm so glad I did.  I love the concept but I read the reviews and took on some tips.  Use the lemon pepper sparingly, Lighted dusted with Garlic powder and I shook some grated Parmesan on the top during the last 5-10 minutes of cooking.  DELICIOUS and DIFFERENT!  My 5 year old and I almost didn't leave my Husband any!  I would have NEVER thought of this with out all of your help!  I served this with Chicken breast marinated in Italian Dressing and Couscous - Thanks!

This recipe is very quick and easy, but not the best way to cook zucchini, in my opinion.  I may do it again (I didn't measure the lemon pepper) but only because it's SO easy.  My 2-year-old didn't like it--said it was too peppery.  Don't make this with older, tough zucchini, as it stays tough.

Very delicious. My husband just brought in zucchini and yellow squash from the garden. I combined the Zucchini and yellow squash and it was fabulous. Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe.

This deserves a try.  The 2 tbsp of lemon pepper is a lot.  I used less than a teaspoon probably, just sprinkled it on without measuring.  I paired it up with spaghetti with pesto sauce and it was a great combo.  Adjust the time if you want it less "soft".

Not outstanding, but not bad.  What I liked most about this method of preparation was that it eliminated the need to babysit it as it cooked.  The lemon pepper seasoning was pleasant enough, although I used just a sprinkle and not even close to the 2 T. called for!  Four stars with giving it just a sprinkle of seaoning, a very generous and forgiving 3 stars if one would choose to try the full amount of seasoning. (Two tablespoons on two zucchini?!)

The lemon pepper flavors go really well with zucchini.  The only thing I don't like is the texture when you bake it.  It gets all shriveled up and wrinkly.  I sautee it on the stovetop instead.

Definitely nice and simple and after reading other reviews and doing some of my own experimenting I think you can season it almost anyway you like... the lemon pepper as written is definitely good.. also adding some dill weed and Parmesan cheese to it is excellent as well... some other seasonings I liked were Italian herbs and garlic salt and combinations of all of them... experiment to find what you like... instead of brushing with melted butter I cut the butter in half put the slices in a zip lock bag added the butter and tossed it around to coat... even by cutting the butter in half I still had a lot of excess left on the bag but the zucchini slices were perfectly coated... just right... good simple recipe thanks!!

Just okay.  First of all I sliced my zucchini lengthwise, rather than in slices.  Brushed them with a little bit of melted butter and seasoned lightly with the lemon pepper.  The baking temperature was lowered to 350 degrees, since I was also doing chicken, and the veggies took about 20 minutes. Topped the slices with grated parm till slightly melted.  In my opinion the amount of butter/lemon pepper stated in the recipe is way too much.

A delightful side dish when you need some green with your meal. I sprayed the zucchini with Pam olive oil instead of using butter; I also added garlic powder.

I made this recipe exactly, using McCormick California Style Lemon Pepper seasoning.  It came out with an overpowering sweet taste.  I don't know if it was the seasoning, but I did not like the result.  However, this is an easy zucchini trick and the lemon pepper could be replaced by any number of herbs and spices.

I know I'm rating this based on the additions that other readers suggested but....it's really good. I used only 2 tsp. lemon pepper, a little dill weed then add the parmesan cheese about 15 min before finished. Yum!

My mom had given me fresh zucchini from her garden, so I went looking for a recipe. After reading the reviews, I used less lemon pepper, added garlic salt and parmesan cheese before cooking at 350 degrees. The zucchini turned out great! We loved it! Next time, I'll try olive oil instead of butter. Thanks for the recipe!

The texture of the zucchini was perfect, but I felt like the amount of lemon pepper was going to be WAY too overpowering. I only put a third of it on the veggies and still felt it was way too much.

I gotta tell you, I really liked this dish!  But I have never baked zucchini sliced into medallions like this before and I think that, moreso than the lemon pepper flavoring, was what made a big hit out of it.  I added some fresh lemon juice, in addition to the lemon pepper, and in the end you tasted the real juice more than the seasoning.  Once it was done, it was zesty, but a little unbalanced, so I added some garlic and wine house seasoning to wake it up a little.  The carmelization on the bottom was just magnificent, so it definitely earned 4 stars, even if I had different seasoning tastes!

I made this as one of my side dishes for some friends and boy was it a hit!  Adding the shredded parm cheese five minutes before removing it from the oven is a fabulous idea!  Definitely a keeper!

Very easy to prepare and very tasty. It is one of my standard vegetable side dishes and I rarley have left overs. I usually prepare 8 zucchini for 15 to 20 people but only double the lemon pepper asked for - it has still plenty of flavor. Cooking time goes up if the baking pan is overfilled, though, and I usually bake it 20 minutes, turn with a spatula and cook another 20 minutes.

Great way to prepare.  I needed to bake a little longer.  I loved all the lemon pepper and prepared ths with a Baked Scallops recipe  found on this site that called for Lemmon Pepper.  No need to feel like  wasted my money on "another" spice!  Will try again!

This was very good.  I didn't measure the lemon pepper - I just sprinkled some on since I didn't think the kids would like it too much.  They did.  The 2 tbsp. might be a bit much.  This goes great with Amy's Garlic Chicken.  I even did them in the same pan with the chicken on one side and the zucchini on the other.

I really like how simple this is. I sprinkle with both lemon pepper and garlic powder, and then add grated parmesan in the last few minutes of baking.

This was really good!  I added a little garlic powder, cut down on the lemon pepper and added a little freshly grated parmesan cheese toward the end of cooking.  I think I'll cut way down on the butter next time as I ended up buttering both sides of the zuchinni and it was too much.  Don't cut the pieces too small as they cook quickly!  Thanks for the post!

I made this recipe one night when I just wasn't in the mood to cook, it was so easy to make, slice, season and toss in the oven.  I also added a little garlic powder and grated parmesan cheese at the end.

I made this recipe last night and it was a huge hit! They flew off the tables in literally seconds. I had to make a second batch and they disappeared even faster!    I took the suggestions of some of the other reviews and used a bit of garlic powder and also reduced the amount of lemon pepper.

I adjusted the butter and lemon pepper according to my amount of zucchini.  It turned out OK but could have used a little more zip from garlic salt or Parmesan cheese as other reviewers have suggested.  Definitely best eaten hot/warm.

I followed some of the tips from previous commenters and dipped the thickly-sliced zucchini in a mixture of :  melted 1/2 stick of butter,  1 tbsp. lemon pepper and 1/2 tbsp. garlic powder.  Then I lightly-sprinkled freshly grated Romano on it about 2/3 of the way through baking.  I think I ended up cooking them for about 25 minutes at 400.  They were easy and super tasty and my family gobbled them up.

I used olive oil instead of butter.  I just sprinkled on a little of the lemon pepper, and added garlic and salt and pepper.  This is the third time that I have made it, and this time I put in Mushrooms and Red Onion. YUMMMMY!!

Very, Very good!  However, can make better by adding granuated garlic and adding grated parmesan CHEESE on each pc. in last 5 mins..then return to oven. Reduce pepper. To make even quicker, substitute butter with olive oil...pour Tbsp oil in bag and toss cut pieces before seasoning. Oil does not change the taste. However, cheese is essential to me!!! My picky hubby and tween kids liked it alot!!!

Easy, quick and decent. Just use lemon pepper to taste. Not the exact amount shown. It may be way too much for most people. (I added garlic, but I am a junkie!) Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe taught me to always read the reviews. I figured w/ such a simple ingredient list that it wasn't necessary but if I had, I would have known for sure, what I suspected in the first place...which is, this was wayyy too much lemon pepper. I think one tbp. would have probably been a bit much. I'm sorry to give this such a low rating but I made it exactly as the recipe reads & we couldn't even eat the zuchinni.

This recipe has a lot of potential! I reduced the amount of lemon pepper (2 tbsp make a very peppery dish!), used olive oil and added some garlic powder. Yummy! Sauteing them can save you time but you miss the "roasted zucchini" touch...

Yummy and simple, but the measurements are a bit screwy. Just melt about a 1T of butter in a bowl and brush it on the slices. If you need more, melt more, but you may not. Then get out your bottle of lemon pepper and sprinkle generously to taste. 2T is an enormous amount.

For such a SUPER SIMPLE recipe, this was EXCELLENT.   I mixed a good sprinkle of lemon-pepper seasoning, a small sprinkle of dill weed, and a small sprinkle of regular black pepper into unsalted butter before I put it on top of the slices.  I sprayed the cookie sheet with no-stick coating, and the slices stayed very juicy.  Next time I may try NOT spraying the cookie sheet; then perhaps they might be more like oven-fried.  Served this with "Lasagna Spinach Roll-Ups", also from this site.  EXCELLENT combo.  Do try this recipe!!!

I used 1 Tbsp of lemon pepper and would cut it back to 1/2 Tbsp next time for myself. My seasoning might have been really powerful. Great to not have to flip in the pan like normal.

This was okay but I think I overcooked the zucchini because it fell apart in my mouth and not in a good way. I'd probably try making it again though.

I just made it. Dipped both sides in the melted butter and sprinkled the lemon pepper. Tastes ok but too strong of lemon taste. I also topped it with shredded parmesan. Next time I'm gonna use just regular pepper.

I also used less lemon pepper, just shaking it on til it looked right, added garlic salt, and sauteed them in half butter, half olive oil on the stove until softened a bit and starting to brown, then sprinkled on some parmesan.  The lemon really comes through and they tasted a bit sweet. Very good with sauteed steelhead trout.

Delicious!  The only change I had to make was to double the butter and seasonings - my zucchinis were a bit larger than average.

This is not our favorite way to prepare zucchini, but it was an interesting and different flavor from the norm. A good recipe if you are looking for something a little different.

We loved it!  I didn't have lemon pepper, so I used a little garlic and herb seasoning I had in the pantry, and included some parmesan cheese as well.  Yum, and can't wait to do it again!

Delicious! Love how simple and good this recipe is. I buttered and seasoned one side, then flipped and did the other side. I didn't turn them while baking. 5 minutes before the end I topped them with some grated parmesan. This is now my go to zucchini side dish!

I made this last night for dinner.  My husband really enjoyed it, I thought it was just ok.  My husband did say it didn't taste good once it cooled..so eat it when it's hot!  I did change a couple of things, I used less lemon pepper and I added parm cheese for the last five minutes of baking.  I think next time I'll use more lemon pepper, no chesse and do it on the grill.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this the other night for dinner and my family loved it.  I did make a few changes though.  Instead of butter, I used extra virgin olive oil, and I just sprinkled it with the lemon pepper, put it in a foil tin, covered it and put it on the grill. I will definitely be making this again and I will bake it in the oven during the winter.

I've been grilling lemon pepper Zucchini for my family for a years now but never thought about baking it. It was really wonderful and easier than taking them out to the grill. Instead of butter I use butter flavored cooking spray and cut them lenght wise.

I put less lemon pepper than it called for, but still sprinkled on top. Also, 5 minutes before it's done in the oven, sprinkle Parmesan or Nonna's cheese. Really good!  For 5 people I used 4 zucchini (supposedly 8 servings) but it wasn't completely enough. Next time use 6

Like others, I didn't use the full amount of lemon pepper as it would have been far too much.  I just sprinkled the zucchini with what appeared to be a reasonable amount.  Neither of us particularly cared for this and I will not make it again.

This was good, easy to fix.  Like other reviewers, I used alot less butter and lemon pepper.  I just brushed on a thin coating of butter, and sprinkled lemon pepper seasoning.  You can make as much or as little as you want.

This recipe was quick & easy. I took the advice of many reviewers and only used 1/2 of the lemon pepper.  It still could have even used a little less. I can't even imagine how strong 2 tbsp would be! I also added mushrooms, which went along very well with the zucchini.  I sauteed it all in butter and it came out great. It was a hit with my boyfriend, I'll make this again!

We loved this recipe.  I followed a suggestion posted with the parkay spray (I used I can't believe it's not butter spray) and I put all my ingredients small strainer and siffed the spices over the Zucchini.  I also cut back a little of the lemon pepper and added some salt free lemon dill, and a pinch of cayanne.  Hummm Hummm Good!!

I made a few variations to this recipe. I tossed the zucchini with lemon pepper and garlic then sauteed them in the pan with butter. I also made angel hair pasta tossed with butter, garlic, basil, a bit of salt, and freshly ground pepper. The sourness of the zucchini worked great with the subtle flavor of the pasta. My family loved it! I will definitely make this again. A+

Loved these! Took almost no time to make, and were so flavourful and tender. I sprinkled them with a little garlic powder as well. Thanx so much for this recipe! :)

Very simple and very tasty.  I'm not a zucchini fan, so this is a very good recipe for me!  The zucchini was tender and very flavorful.  I served this with brown rice and Simple Lemon Herb Chicken.

Liked the taste; I do agree with another reviewer that this would be better sauteed instead of baking. The texture was something to desired. Still, a good flavor.

This seemed like a great recipe, but was so salty & overseasoned, it was unedible.  I would cut the lemon pepper in 1/2, and make sure the brand you use isn't mostly salt.

I really liked it. My spouse didn't care for it much, because it was spicey.Next time I will use half the lemon pepper.

This was really good, but there was a lot of butter.  I only used about a tablespoon and it turned out good.  My husband loved it.

Easy, delicious, classic!  Next time I'll turn the zucchini in the pan 1/2 way through cooking but that's the only thing I'd change.  New household fave!

My husband and I liked it quite a bit.  The kids weren't as impressed.  I think next time I would add a little garlic powder or garlic salt.
