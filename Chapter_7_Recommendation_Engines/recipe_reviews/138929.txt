I took a couple containers of nonfat greek yogurt and threw that in the freezer last night so I could use it in this recipe in place of the vanilla ice cream. I made no other changes. I liked this smoothie--it tasted very similar to an Orange Julius. My bananas were quite ripe and combined with the sweet/tart of the orange juice, it really didn't need any other sweetener. The one issue I had was that it had a little too much liquid.  I think I'd cut back on the milk at least by half next time. Then I think it would be perfect.

This was good and the kids loved it.  I added some crushed ice to the blender when mixing it up.  I may use a bit more vanilla next time as it was a bit plain.

the origional recipe posted was horrible. It needed more sugar, less orange juice, and ice cubes. But after editing the recipe it turned out good.

The recipe is what is says.  I just didn't prefer the taste. Definitely do not put orange in it though... I only did 1/2 cup and still tasted the orange.

This was pretty good. I used fat free yogurt in place of the ice cream because I wanted to have it for breakfast.

I kept all the measurements the same, but I skipped the milk and used Sunny D instead of orange juice. My family loved it!
