These were good but not the texture or flavor I was looking for.  I think we prefer the ones with cottage cheese for the texture factor, these were just a little rubbery for our liking.  I did switch out the spinach for chopped ham to make the littles happy.

Great recipe, thanks! I use this egg mold with built-in handles and trivet, much easier and safer!
