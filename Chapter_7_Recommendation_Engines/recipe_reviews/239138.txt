Substitute the velveeta cheese with cream cheese and sour cream. Use a shredded cheese like Coby Jack. Do not use milk. Add a little bit of margarine if you would like.

Sorry but I didn't much like this.  It was very heavy.  I guess I should have known that from looking at the recipe.  Won't make it again.

Mr. LTH, the potato connoisseur at our house, deemed these "delicious", without prompting.  I'd prefer them with a little roasted garlic and a good amount of sea salt, but enjoyed them, too.  I just can't make myself use Velveeta, so I used real shredded cheddar in its place.  THANKS for the recipe!
