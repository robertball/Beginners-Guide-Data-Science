Vkusnyatina!! which means delicious in Russian! I'm Russian and I grew up on this dish, the recipe is perfect. I felt like I just ate a plate of my Mom's Vareniki :)

The dough is very easy to make. I saut√©ed fresh brown mushrooms because they were cheaper than the dried ones, and the result was good, but I am sure using dried porcini would be even better. The vareniky are very good when eaten with vinegar.

I love this dish. My mother and my grandmother used to make it for us when we were kids. I'm from Romania but we have Ukrainian blood.

I enjoyed working with the dough it came out very nice. I just made a filling from potatoes, some rehydrated shiitake mushrooms I had on hand and some leftover meat so it wasn't quite like the recipe. I will definitely make this again using this recipe for the dough and play around with fillings.
