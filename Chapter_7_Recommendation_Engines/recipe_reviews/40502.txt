This cake was a hit with the whole family (even the picky eaters!). We used fresh apples instead of frozen apples though.

This cake was very good.  I used pears instead of apples, which worked fine.  The only problem I had with this recipe was that a 9 inch cake pan was really too small.  I had my doubts that an entire cake mix plus all that fruit would fit, and sure enough, it didn't.  The cake rose out of the pan and the top began to burn, so I had to take it out early and cut off the burned parts.  However, once I did that it was great - it came out of the pan easily, looked good, and was very tasty (very sweet and rich).  My advice would be to use a bigger pan or to leave out a little of the batter.

I used apple pie filling and brown sugar instead. I also put it in a bundt pan to make a better presentation.I also accidentally used too much butter so that plus the liquid from the pie filling made it impossible for the cake to absorb all the glaze during cooking. It was kind of messy trying to plate it but I made it look good. Also the apples did not want to stay on the cake so maybe I will use a flat pan from now on. Anyways trial and error!!!! This was a good idea and I still enjoyed the flavor. It melted in my mouth! Will definitely try again!

Easy to make and deliciously moist. I used apple pie filling instead and it came out beautifully. I used round cake pans I think I might try a 1/4 sheet cake pan next time instead of 2 round pans

Very good.  I used fresh apples instead of frozen.  It turned out well.
