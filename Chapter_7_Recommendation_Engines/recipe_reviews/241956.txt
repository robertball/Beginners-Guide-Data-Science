I used 1 cup almonds, 1/2 cup raisins, 15 dates, 1 Tbsp cinnamon.  
Without raisins, it was too dry to form into balls and that's the reason I added them. I don't like cinnamon overpowering the rest and it came out perfectly with just a hint of cinnamon flavor :) I love how easy and quick it was to make. I'll be making this again!

I use 1 cup almonds, 1 cup raisins, 1 tsp cinnamon. I like to soak the almonds & raisins in water for about an hour first, then blend it all together. Super simple and delicious as an easy snack to take with you, and kids love them too. I have also added cocoa to them, or rolled them in coconut. I prefer them with almonds or cashews vs walnuts, and would not use the cardamom.

I followed previous reviewers' suggestions of cutting the cinnamon in half, and I used pumpkin pie spice instead of cardamom out of necessity. Still turned out yummy. My toddler approved!

I almost always make changes. The first batch I made was so good, I did a second before I had washed the blender. I used half raisins and half dates and half walnuts and half almonds. I didn't measure the cinnamon but doubt I used as much as the recipe calls for. So easy and amazingly good. :-)

Quite tasty. I ran out of cinnamon so only was able to add about 1/2 - 2/3 the amount. I am glad I did because 3T would have been too strong for my taste

I used 18 dates with 1 cup of walnuts.  Worked beautifully!   Delicious though when amounts are right!

Made according to recipe, but used my magic bullet as I didn't have a blender. Just about burned out the bullet so I had to add a lot of water to blend. Added a cup of oatmeal to adjust the moisture level and turned out great. I'll do the same next time but will cut the spices in half as it was quite strong.

Not sure if my dates were too small, my cinnamon was too potent, or if we just don't like cardamom, but this recipe didn't work for us. It WAS really quick and easy to make, so if the flavours work for you, then this would be worth making.
