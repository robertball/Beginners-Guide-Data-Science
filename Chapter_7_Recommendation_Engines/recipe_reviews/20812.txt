This recipe makes a nice dense compact texture. The flavor is great, especially right out of the oven and makes good toast. I let the bread machine to the work thru the 2nd rise, then I shape it, place it in 9X5 pan and bake at 375 degrees for 30-35 minutes. Yummy. Thanks Heather.

after I mix the sugar, yeast and water, I place it in my sink w/water of the same temp for the 10 minutes.  My yeast activates much better this way and the bread is always perfect!  Thank You

This turned out nicely in appearance, but I didn't like the taste or the heavy texture.  For those using yeast in the jar, the equivalent is 2-1/4 tsp, or check the fine print on your jar.

For my first bread machine experience this recipe was very easy and most important the family loved it.  I did bake it in the oven and not in the ABM, I controlled the color and texture of the crust better in the oven.  Carol

Very easy to make.  I made this several times and it keeps falling in the middle when it bakes.  Not sure what I'm doing wrong, but it still bakes really nice and tastes good.  Always soft in the middle and works really well for sandwiches.  I'll get that falling thing fixed one of these times!  Thanks for sharing!

This is a good, simple, everyday white bread.   I reduced the sugar to 1-1/2 tsp. as my bread machine has a tendency to make the bread overrise, and I used 1-1/2 tsp. of bread machine yeast.  I liked the addition of the dry milk powder which contributes softness and helps keep the bread fresh. I also like that this recipe does not call for a lot of butter or oil.  I chose the basic white setting with the medium crust.  Very versatile, basic bread for sandwiches or toast.

This recipe is fantastic. 
I used Hodgson Mill 50/50 blended bread flour(wheat&white), which I warmed in the oven while I got the bread machine out and the other ingredients ready.  (I also had to substitute fresh milk into the water quantity.)
The recipe made 12 delicious rolls that I baked on my pizza stone preheated in the oven.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.  Thank-you Heather!

Hi,
I have used this recipe quite a few times.  In fact, i have it going right now in the bread maker.  Often I will add 2 tbsp "Pesto" from Epicure Selections to the recipe ~ very nice with pasta!!

I thought this bread tasted like English Muffin bread, but with more work. I made it by hand instead of using the bread machine, and i didnt have any bread flour so i used regular. This might have made a difference. It tasted good and was really good as toast or with butter and jam, but wasnt good for sandwiches which is what I made it for.

Great recipe!  I only used the dough setting on my machine, just because I like the shape of a loaf out of the oven better - it smelled SO good while it was baking.  Not too crumbly or dry or wimpy - just right for toast and sandwiches.  Thanks!

We liked the taste of the inside but even with putting the crust on "light" for the color it ended up being very hard.  The inside was nice and soft though.  One other issue we had-there was way too much yeast in the recipe.  My bread rose way too high and fell so we weren't able to use it for anything other than just eating (no sandwiches, toast, etc).  I will be playing with this recipe a bit.  I tried another one that I decreased the yeast down to 1 1/2 tsp of yeast and it turned out great (I got this number from another recipe we've tried that's a 1 1/2 lb loaf).  Maybe try this?  Also maybe it needs more moisture-I'm going to try adding at least another 1/4 cup next time

Great recipe!I made this last night and my husband loved it! He said it was one of the best I'd made. I do not have a bread machine, so I dissolved the yeast in the water, then added the other ingredients (flour last). I baked it at 400 for about 30 min.

Love the taste and texture of the bread.  Having trouble with it falling in the middle, though.  Does anyone know how I can stop this from happening?  I have used multigrain flour instead of white flour and it is just as good.

Tastes good, but I've made it three times and it's never risen past the halfway point of the pan so it ends up very dense. 

My other bread recipes work fine so I don't think it's my yeast or other ingredients. Not sure why it ends up so flat!

It was really easy and tasted great.  I baked it in the oven since my bread-machine likea to burn stuff, and it turned out perfectly.  Stores well and cuts easily for sandwiches too.

The recipe was very easy to put together. The loaf was a bit small, but the flavor was exquisite.

I made the bread in the bread machine.  It was very easy.  My husband LOVED the bread.  It has a good taste and is very soft.

Yummy, but very dense.  Mine fell in the middle as another reviewer said.  Maybe more yeast?  I think I'll try out a different recipe before giving this one another go.

I made the loaf in my bread machine and it baked up perfectly.  I was hesistant about it because I had made bread before using a different recipe and it had turned out dry and hard in the middle.  When I sliced this recipe's bread up, it was so soft.  My husband tried a piece and loved it.  My kids loved it too.  Soooo soft and yummy!  Goodbye store bought bread, hello this recipe!

Just popped this out of my breadmaker and it is delicious.  Nice color, texture and flavor.  The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is that I have yet to see how it will hold up, but I'm optimistic.  TY!

I made this bread, we were looking for sandwich bread, even on the lowest crust setting this one seems to be a little too crusty for that but still delicious!  Thanks
