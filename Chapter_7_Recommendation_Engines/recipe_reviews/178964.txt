Very easy to make, and it tastes awesome!  So that no one struggles like I did, have everything prepped and ready for when the pastry dough thaws.  Because when it really, really thaws - it becomes a sticky mess!  Still eatable . . . just not pretty - lol.

Not big on mushrooms so simply used Campbell'sÂ® Condensed Cream of Chicken soup  Although the recipe neglects to mention this, do not dilute with water.  Follow the recipe (DO NOT forget the nutmeg, it DOES make a difference) and it comes out perfect and tastes fabulous.  Great for entertaining.  I added a photo.  Enjoy.

These were yummy!  I added a few shakes of garlic powder and some pepper before baking for some added flavor.  I made them a day ahead for a party and stored in the fridge.  They must be at least room temp to serve.  Although, heated up was even better.  A perfect meatless (if you used all mushroom soup) recipe for my vegetarian friends! Thanks for sharing :)

I had to shop the day before Thanksgiving and had to make substitutions because of the grocery store mayhem. I used the crescent roll dough instead of the pastry sheets (which can be hard to find in the city), but no one could tell. Easy to make, inexpensive, and delicious.

This recipe always gets rave reviews when I bring it to family gatherings and potlucks. I've had a hard time finding the cream of chicken and mushroom soup, so I just use cream of mushroom soup.  Definitely take care to tuck in the top sheet of pastry, I've had a couple times when I didn't tuck it very well and it shrinks in the oven and exposes the edges - not very pretty (but still very tasty).
