Given how easy it is to throw together this recipe--and how well it always turns out!--I feel that this coffee cake definitely deserves five stars.

The cake batter takes only five or ten minutes to whip up and seems pretty forgiving. Though the recipe calls for one vanilla pudding mix and one butterscotch pudding mix, I've never used the butterscotch (since I never have any in the cupboard!). Instead, I've used two vanilla mixes or one vanilla and one chocolate mix. Either way, the cake has always turned out great. Also, for a little extra flavor dimension, I've added a couple tablespoons of espresso or instant coffee to the water. The addition of coffee gives the cake a nice, subtle bite--and makes it into a true 'coffee cake.'

Overall, this is a moist, yummy recipe that my family members always ask for. And because it's so easy to make, this would be a great cake for beginning bakers. Thank you, Janis, for your tasty submission!

HELPFUL TIPS AND WHY THIS IS 5 STARS:  Everyone is right! This literally takes 5 minutes to throw together and then you've got an entire family excited you made something so pretty (submitted pic).  For optional icing/toping, I put 1/2C powdered sugar and 1T of milk in a ziplock bag, cut off corner, and pour over.  Looks real pretty and it's only enough to zig zag over.  DEFINITELY take the advice of using Duncan Hines cake mix (white or yellow) or one that doesn't already have pudding in it.  My oven is fast, and I still had to bake for 45 min at 325, so definitely check with toothpick!  Also, you can use 2 pkgs of vanilla INSTANT pudding or 1 of cream cheese if you don't have butterstotch.  I think putting 1/3 off batter, 1/3 off brown sugar mix, 1/3 batter, 1/3 brown sugar mix, then last of batter, last of brown sugar mix is the best.  It VISUALLY looks prettier when you cut it (again, see pic), and it also isn't too overwhelming.  Plus, any more layers then you don't get to taste the brown sugar mix and that's the best part right?  I never put nuts b/c the kids don't like it, but if I did ...I'd use pecans.

I made this recipe LOW-FAT and it was INCREDIBLE!  Seriously, it is the best coffee cake and SO moist!  Instead of oil I use half a cup of apple sauce, and half a cup of apple butter.  I sware you'll never know it's low-fat.  I made it in a bundt pan, and layered it as follows:
1. batter
2. cinnamon mixture
3. semi-sweet chocolate chips
4. batter
5. cinnamon mixture
6. semi-sweet chocolate chips
7. batter
8. cinnamon mixture.

I promise you will not be disappointed!

Since this cake adds 2 pkgs of pudding, use a cake mix that does not already have pudding in the mix.  Duncan Hines is the only one I know of that doesn't have pudding added.

First off, I want to say this cake is amazing! SO good with a cup of hot coffee or tea, on a cold day. Secondly, shame on the reviewers who gave it less than 5 stars when they altered the recipe!! When you substitute ingredients for lo-cal or change amounts, etc. you can't expect good results. And to the reviewer who gave this 3 stars because he used grape seed oil? instead of vegie! the oil DOES make a difference! Grape seed oil has a distinct flavor and mainly used for sauteing, and not baking. This cake is fabulous when YOU FOLLOW THE RECIPE~

Everyone loves this cake.  I substituted a box of instant cheesecake pudding for the butterscotch pudding and 3/4 C of apple butter for the oil.  I also skip the nuts, as some of us can't have them.  Delicious!

This is truly a great cake.  I followed the recipe pretty much but make a few of the changes some suggested. For example, I used two vanilla pudding packs and 3/4 cup apple sauce-1/4 oil.  This recipe deserves 5 starts and I will certainly make this again.  Also, I had a piece the next day, and it was ever better than the first day I made it.  This cake just keeps getting better and better-I cannot say enough about it.  Awesome cake!

Loved it, loved it, loved it.  I used cheesecake and french vanilla pudding (I'm not a huge fan of butterscotch) and made three layers that ended up swirling into a fancy "S" shape in my bundt pan.

I may have overbaked it a tad because it turned out kind of dark, so I used the wonderful cover-up of dusting confectioner's sugar all over it.

It was so moist and wonderful, I even caught someone picking crumbs off the serving plate!

My husband loves this cake, as do we all!  It's definitely best on the 3rd day, as the flavors are perfectly blended by then and the cinnamon doesn't stand out too strong.  Now I try to make it 2 or 3 days ahead of time and hide it from my husband so it won't be all gone before it reaches it peak!  Also, I use pecans instead of walnuts.

I have made this twice and both times was a huge hit.  I plan to make it again for Easter brunch.  I mix the brown sugar/cinnamon/nut mixture in two batches, divided evenly and make one without nuts.  I am able to make one half of this with nuts for those who love nuts and the other half "plain" for the little ones who don't like nuts. I also find that if I use a little bit less than half the batter for the bottom half, it's easier to distribute the top batter over the cinnamon mixture. Thanks for sharing this easy and delicious recipe.

Absolutely fantastic!  I made this using a bundt pan and followed everything as stated in the recipe.  If you use a bundt pan, add the cinn layer first so this layer ends up on the top of your cake instead of the bottom, like mine did.  :(  Next time I may use an 8x13 pan instead.  I wish the order of layering in a bundt pan would have been mentioned in the recipe

I have made similar cakes like this before.  The butterscotch pudding does give it a darker color and adds a little bit compared to all vanilla.  When it says to pour half the cake mix in and then half the cinammon mixture in, I made four total layers.  This makes the cinammon and sugar layer thinner and not over powering.  I only used about 3/4 of the mixture and it was plenty sweet.

Fabulous!  I made this for a brunch on Mother's Day, and it was great.  I made it in a Bundt pan, layered it four times, used cheesecake pudding instead of butterscotch, pecans instead of walnuts, 1/2 cup of oil, 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar, baked it ten minutes longer, and dusted it with powdered sugar.

I will NOT make this again.  With 2 boxes of pudding mix, plus the brown sugar-nut mixture it was WAY too sweet.  This was a very dense, heavy cake that didn't get very "cake-y".

Excellent!  Instead of making the cake, I made cofee cake cupcakes. I layered them- mix-cinnamon mixture-mix-cinnamon mixture.  Baked for approx 20-25 mins.  Substituted some unsweetened applesauce for the oil (3/4 c applesauce & 1/4 c oil).  They turned out perfect!!!!I had to hurry and eat a few before the husband and kids ate them all.

I made 2 of these last night for my husband to take to work for his co-workers' treat today, and he said they raved about it.  There was none left over.  He said it was outstanding.  I will definitely be making this again. It was very easy; I followed the recipe as it is, no changes. Thanks for this recipe.

This an excellent coffee cake... Moist and not too sweet.  As some reviewers' suggested, I cut down the oil to 1/4 cup and made up the difference with cinnamon flavored applesauce. Also added some pumpkin spice to the cake mix. I will make this cake again.....

I made this recipe as written, and it came out delicious but a bit on the sweet side (and I am not a person who frequently complains of things being oversweet). I think all that brown sugar is the culprit--next time I will try reducing to 3/4 c.

Everyone absolutely loved this cake! I am an expert cook but a beginner baker and I loved the ease in the recipe. The butterscotch gave it great color and the flavors were so different. Nice change to the norm. The next time I would add the nut mixture after about 2/3rds of the batter. That layer seems to be on the bottom of the cake. Definitely will make this recipe again!

Very good.  I used 1 1/2 cups flour+ 3tsp. baking powder+ 4tbs corn starch+ 1 1/3 cups sugar+ 2tsp vanilla for the cake mix.  I also used fat-free milk instead of water.

I am not easily impressed and I have to say this was pretty amazing. Make it ahead of time as it tastes even better on day two and three (if it lasts that long). Very moist but not oily like others have said. I used a bundt pan which took an extra ten minutes or so. My husband has actually asked me to make one for him to take into the office.

One of the best coffee cakes I have ever tried!  It made the house smell so good while it was baking we couldn't wait to taste it :)  Instead of 1 cup of veg oil I used 1/2 cup cinnamon applesauce and 1/2 cup of canola oil.  I also left out the nuts because we're not crazy about them in cake.  YUM! It was so good that I think I will make another for my Dads birthday this weekend ;)

Followed the ingredients exactly. Mixed only until flour was wet.   Used 1 loaf pan, put half of the batter in, topped with half of the topping, finished with remaining batter and topping.  Baked for 50 minutes.  Outstanding!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a FABULOUS coffee cake. Not only was it delicious, but it was easy and fast to make. I got more compliments on this cake than any other that I brought to my little group. The only change I made was to substitute 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce, for the cup of oil. The applesauce not only made the cake very moist, but it also gave it a slight apple taste which was wonderful. I recommend this to anyone at all who wants to impress other people. I now have to make up a number of copies of this recipe to give out to friends. Enjoy!

Wonderful!  But if using a bundt pan, START with a layer of the streusel topping, next a l layer of batter, next remainder of streusel, and finally, remainder of batter.  If you follow the  recipe as written when using bundt pan, you will not have a streusel layer on top after you invert your cake.  I used a combo of French vanilla and white chocolate pudding, and added a drizzle glaze on top.  Couldn't be easier or quicker to make.    Caution...this cake is addictive!

This coffee cake is moist and yummy, and best of all super easy!!  You can throw it together fairly quickly.  I have made it a few times for work and people LOVE it every time.  I have tried it with Vanilla pudding, cheesecake pudding and coconut cream and all are nice.  I really liked it when I used 2 coconut cream puddings and added some flake coconut to the cinnamon, brown sugar and nut mixture.  This one is a keeper:)

ABSOLUTELY fantastic! Don't change a thing if you don't have to! The only thing I modified was I was to leave out the nuts because of a 3 year old who is allergic. I have never tasted a more delicious and moist coffee cake! Couple that with the incredible simplicity of this recipe and you've got a 5-star recipe that is my new go-to for breakfasts and family get-togethers. Thanks so much for the amazing recipe!

Excellent coffee cake!  I prefer baking in a 9 x 13 inch baking pan instead of a Bundt pan because it turns out moist and more delicious!  I also substituted pecans for walnuts.

This recipe was a huge hit at our family Christmas party. I was very nervous when I put it in the oven because it seemed like there was hardly any batter at all. The pudding made it very thick, and it looked so shallow in my baking pan, and seemed overly full of the topping mixture. But, it baked up perfectly! It rose to twice its size and filled the entire pan with a beautiful dense cake. It made our house smell so welcoming when our guests arrived! I'm not fond of butterscotch, so I used cheesecake pudding instead. I also used pecans instead of walnuts, and added 1 tablespoon of instant coffee to the water. I think I could have used at least another 1/2 tablespoon to give it a little more coffee zing. This will definitely become a family favorite!

AMAZING! My hubby and I LOVE this! The only changes I really made were the cake mix i use. Spice cake mix adds a whole new dimension of yummyness. Thank you so much for this recipe! This is a great breakfast in the morning-heat it up with a bit of butter on top, scramble up some eggs on the side... *Mmmmmm*

Amazing cake- I made a few substitutions to make it lower in fat.  I substituted sugar free pudding and I used applesauce instead of oil.  I also used 1 cup of egg beaters instead of 4 eggs, the cake was really moist!  Tons of compliments

I made this for an office brunch and everyone LOVED it.  I did alter the recipe a bit.  I don't care for butterscotch, so I used 2 boxes of vanilla pudding.  I also used only 3/4 cup of vegetable oil and it came out VERY moist.  Also, I didn't use all of the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture.  I will be making this again and again!!!

As far as ease goes, this recipe was the best.  The butterscotch pudding gave the cake a good flavor as well as a very moist texture, but the cake was just too sweet.  If I make it again It will probably be for a group function because there is no way that hubby and I could eat the whole thing. I also think I will leave the nuts out.

I have used this recipe or a variation of it for over 20 years, and it has always been a rousing success, as long as I followed the basic recipe.  It is a tasty and versatile recipe, so you can easily use the puddings or sugars you have on hand in the pantry.  I often add a pinch or two of nutmeg or cardamom, just to add a little punch of flavor and lessen the sweetness a bit.  As many other reviewers have suggested, definitely use a cake mix that doesn't contain pudding.  Make this coffee cake, folks will thank you for it! :)

Oh my goodness, this was delicious and so super easy! I have made it twice for different crowds and have gotten raves both times. I used cheesecake flavored pudding the second time instead of butterscotch and it was equally good. Great recipe!

Really liked this!  I made it as written except that I used a white cake mix instead of yellow just because that's what I had on hand.  This was so moist. My husband rarely eats cake, but he really likes this.  I will make this again and again.

I got brave and used a yellow cake mix that already had pudding in it (Pillsbury), then still used 2 packages of vanilla instant pudding mix. My friend (who likes her cake super moist) loved it. Definitely baked for an additional 45 minutes at the end. Amazing recipe, thank you!

I made this Christmas morning. We are on the 3rd day eating it here and I just served it to guests and had raves for how moist it was!   It's very good. I added pecans instead of walnuts, pecans make everything better :)

Perfect as recipe is written.  I use two glass pans, an 8" x 8" and a 7" x 9" Pyrex glass baking dishes because I don't have a 7" x 13".  Bake for 20 minutes at 350 and then 30 minutes at 325.

I made this for a baby shower and it was a huge hit.  I cooked in a bundt pan and it fell a little, but I just sprinkled with powered sugar.  I cut the oil to 3/4 cup and it was still extremely moist.  It is very sweet so you might want to cut the brown sugar to 3/4 cup.  I highly recommend this.  It is really good.

This cake was delicious.  I made it for the 1st time for a small birthday gathering, and EVERYONE loved it, from my 3 year old daughter to my 65 year old guests.  It was delicious...just the right blend.  I did not use the nuts though, just in case someone didn't like to have nuts.  Thanks for the delicious addition to my dessert favorites!!

This is a fast, simple recipe with consistently delicious results.  The different layers are also pretty! I made this for my office and received compliments from everyone.  One of my coworkers made it for her family the very next day!  Next time I would probably make a simple confectioner's sugar glaze to add some shine.

Fantastic, a big hit at the brunch I brought it to. Made it in the morning a couple of hours before and it was super easy. I did follow some of the suggestions: one vanilla and one cheesecake pudding mix, some instant coffee in the water, and I layered the cake batter and sugar mixture without nuts in three layers. I didn't have a bundt pan but didn't want to do 9 x 13, so I make it in a round springform cake pan, which worked out surprisingly well considering there was no frosting. Even the kids loved it and there was none left over! Definitely a keeper.

This cake is amazing!  Per other reviewers, I did change  the oil to 1/2 c oil, 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce.  I also used 1 box vanilla and 1 box cheesecake pudding.  I replaced the walnuts with chopped pecans.  Because the pieces are smaller, my kids don't mind it that way.  Husband gave 10 stars (out of 5)!  So unbelievably easy that this is going to be my go to coffee cake recipe from now on.  I made 2.  One in a bundt pan.  Start with a sprinkling of cinnamon, and then did batter, cinnamon mix, batter, cinnamon mix and finished with batter.  Turned out beautifully.  Also made one at the same time in a 9x13.  I thought I had done about 1/2 batter 1st, but after putting 1/2 cinnamon mix and the rest of batter, I could just barely cover the cinnamon mixture.  I thought this cake was ruined, but the cinnamon mixture did sink quite a bit, so the one on top of the cake was not too close to the other, and it was great.  Thanks for this amazing recipe!

Holy Moses, this sucker is heavy. If you're looking for a light cake, this aint it. It tastes ok but it's a  the thighs recipe and for that, I want better than 'tastes ok'.

Fantastic!  I followed exactly and it was perfect.  Beautiful color, moist texture, sweet and delicious flavor.  I made the Quick White Icing from Joy of Cooking and drizzled on the top.  Thanks!

Oh snap! This recipe is so good. This recipe is fantastic! Simple and elegant. Husband liked it so much, he kept picking on the cake. Oh and the cake only lasted one day! Friends are now requesting for me to make this cake for a BBQ! Thanks for submitting an awesome recipe!

Very Good.   Wrote the ingeients down and made the cake.  Thought it was odd no water so I added about 1/2 cup.  I only had vanilla pudding mix skiped the butterscotch.  Will try that next time and maybe 3/4 cup of water if it is not as good I will stick to the 1/2 cup of water.  Most important I used a powder sugar glaze over the cake great presentation.

Excellent!   I brought this to Easter Sunday brunch and it was a big hit!   As suggested, I used vanilla and cheesecake puddings and that was delish!  I doubled the cinnamon topping part of the recipe and that was perfect!

This was really, really good.  I made a few changes...I made it in a bundt pan, only used one pack of pudding (butterscotch), and substituted pecans for the walnuts.  I also used half cinnamon applesauce for half of the oil, to make it healthier.  The texture was perfect and the cake was a total hit!  Thanks!

This is so good you won't believe it!  I used 1 1/2 the quantity of brown sugar/cinnamon/nut mixture, and spread about a cup of golden raisins over the center layer.  I also used one box of french vanilla pudding instead of butterscoth, and 1 box of regular vanilla. (That's what I had on hand.) I've been looking for a good coffee cake recipe for a long time - this is it!

Too greasy and heavy! And that's after cutting the oil to 1/2 cup and 1/2 cup applesauce. It tasted too much like butterscotch. We did not really like this cake.

OH YEAH!!! Made this recently, and when my husband took some to work, the container was gone in half an hour! VERY moist. The butterscotch chips are optional, but I found they added a lot without being overpowering. Also, I used a yellow cake made with Splenda, since there was already plenty of brown sugar in the crumb mixture. Also, I substituted 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce for 3/4 cup of the oil, adding only 1/4 cup oil. Didn't affect flavor at all; probably made it better, and definitely more healthy. Also, there was already 1 cup of pudding in the cake mix, so I omitted the pkg. of vanilla pudding. You could probably also use other flavors of pudding, whatever is on hand. I HIGHLY recommend you try this one! SO easy!

I don't know why everyone seemed to like this recipe so much because was very dense, almost not like cake. Very very sweet, and it fell apart when taking it out of the pan. It sounded good, but didn't work out. Won't be trying this one again.

Had a dish I needed to return to a friend and I thought this sounded good, I chopped up some apple to put in the topping mixture as someone else suggested. My friend called that night and said she was already washing the pan because it was so good they ate it all. A whole cake in one day..

Excellent! I made 3 different versions of coffee cake each week until I found the right one and this is it! In fact, I'm making it for my husband's 40th birthday right now because he requested it! It is so easy, moist and tasty!!

This cake is excellent and enjoyed by everyone at the party.  Today is my fourth time to make it (in two weeks) and it has been a success everytime. The recipe is easy, inexpensive and does not require a core knowledge of cookinng or baking to be successful.  I followed one of the suggestions about adding instant coffee to the brown sugar mixture with great success.  I have consistently used the vanilla pudding but after the first time substituted the butterscotch with cheesecake, banana and coconut .  This recipe is being added to the rotation.  It's a slamdunk everytime.
Update: I continue testing this recipe, so I want to make a note-- I doubt you will find a box of yellow cake mix that has 18.25 oz; the one's I see on the shelf are 15.25 oz, which is working fine with the recipe. Accordingly, I suggest correcting the recipe to read 15.25, not 18.25.  I have tested the recipe with BC and DH cake brands with success on both.  I should also note that I have made this cake everytime in a bundt pan.  I keep making it--I mean every time we finish one I make another one.  The recipe is, as the old saw goes, fool proof.  Feel free to make it using a 1/2 cup of applesauce and a 1/2 cup oil, instead of the full cup of oil.

After reading some of the other reviews, I opted to make a couple of the changes they suggested.

Since some found the recipe too sweet, and we don't like things that are overly sweet, I substituted a thoroughly softened block of cream cheese for the butterscotch pudding.  I also added about 2 Tablespoons of instant coffee, as suggested by some.

The only box of vanilla pudding I had was a larger one, but I just used the whole thing anyway.  

I did not have a yellow cake mix, but I did have a white cake mix, and used that.  I substituted a melted stick of butter for half of the oil, and added some vanilla.

I used 2 Tablespoons of cinnamon in the brown sugar, rather than one.  What can I say... we like cinnamon!

The resulting cake got rave reviews from my whole family!  We will be doing this again.

This cake was great! I did make a few changes as I had to work with what I had in my pantry.I used a pistachio pudding mix along with the butterscotch;pecans instead of walnuts. I substituted the water and oil for milk and butter!! Kids loved it....will be making this again for sure.

I did 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil.  the applesauce was natural- no sugar added, but this cake was still way too sweet.  Even the kids that said they liked it only ate half their small slice. I thought twice, because I don't like cake mixes, but due to the high reviews I made it anyway.  This also leaves a chemically after taste. I am going back to my old recipe, it's more time consuming, but worth it.

I gave it a one star as it had good taste. However it did not taste anything like coffee cake nor did  it come out like the picture.  It was a strange gold color from the butterscotch pudding,  the cinnamon topping melted into the cake batter while baking, it was the moist chunky texture as an usual coffee cake and was instead fell apart and very flaky.  Strange for a cake.  I am  a pretty good baker and never had a recipe fail me so badly as this one did.  And I did exactly as it calls for.  (I hate reviewers that change the recipe and then rate it low because they didn't like THEIR own change)

Sorry this was not remotely a success for me.

This cake was pretty good. I followed it exactly, except for using a french vanilla cake mix & pecans instead of walnuts. I used a glass pan, cooked the minimum time, & the edges are overdone, so watch closely. It could be my oven, though.

Delicious!  Made it exactly as written,except used pecans instead of walnuts. It doesn't taste "cake-mix-y" at all to me, and I'm not a big fan of boxed cakes. Will definitely make it again, it would be wonderful with mini chocolate chips in the brown sugar mixture.

I forgot to do the layer thing..., so I just put the brown sugar/cinnimon (I ommited the nuts and added 2 tablespoons of melted butter to the mix prior to putting it on top of cake.)  When the cake came out, it looked very "cake mix" like, but after it sat for a couple hours... it became flat.  My husband took this to work, and while I personally havnt tasted it, he called and said it was deliciuos, and I was welcome to make it anytime!  Very easy!

very moist, almost too moist. i only used 3/4 cup of oil and 3/4 cup of brown sugar as other reviewers suggested. any more oil than this would have been WAY too much. i might even cut it down next time. the taste was great though. not too sweet. imagine the possibilities for this! you can add raisins (as i did), chocolate chips, try different kinds of cake mixes, the list goes on.

This coffee cake was the best ever! Quick and so easy since you start with a mix. I've made it twice with rave reviews! I may try a few different pudding mixs, too, next time. It freezes great too!

I've made this recipe three times now and everyone always loves it. I use two vanilla pudding packages and skip the butterscotch, then divide the batter in half, filling the bottom of the pan, and add a can of apple pie filling, covering it with the rest of the batter. I have also used both chopped walnuts and sliced almonds in the topping, as well as substituting huckleberries for the apple pie filling. This gets rave reviews here on the farm.

This is one of the best coffee cakes I've ever made.  I don't like traditional "cake," and I'm always looking for a good coffee cake.  THIS IS IT! One note of caution: be sure to use INSTANT PUDDING.  The second time I made it, I accidentally used regular pudding, and I knew something wasn't right (the batter was super runny). All of the brown sugar and cinnamon sunk to the bottom and made a gooey mess that was a chore to clean [though it still tasted good! :)].  When you use the instant pudding, and you take the mixer to it, it thickens up considerably, which is what allows the crumb mixture to rest on each layer without sinking. Super yummy.  The only negative: there's never any left for the next day!

WOW, this cake is better than delicious...if mmmmm's are anything to go by. I heard more of mmmmm's from my husband with this recipe than any others I have tried from this site to date! I normally follow a recipe the first time exactly before making any changes based on reviews. However, after reading so many reviews concerning the amount and flavor of pudding to use, I did change that up a bit.

I prefer Betty Crocker cake mixes (with the pudding in the mix) so I did go ahead and use that. However, because of all the warnings against this, I reduced the amount of pudding to ONE 3.4 once package, instead of two. I love cream cheese, so I used cheescake flavored Jello instant pudding. I kept everthing else exactly the same as the recipe, including the layering. Oh, I used a bundt pan and didn't put any nuts in. 

If you like a super-moist cake (as our family does), you will love this recipe. If you like more of a drier cake...maybe not. Honestly, it is so good that it doesn't even need icing...maybe only a drizzle for eye-appeal. This recipe is a definite keeper for us and I think it would be good with almost any kind of pudding! :)

Easy and so good. I used one package of Pumpkin Spice pudding and one package of vanilla. I also added 2 T. ground flax seed and 2 T. of oat bran. It turned out great and people even asked if there was pumpkin in it. My kids were going crazy as it was baking - I can't wait for them to try it!

Very moist and easy to make. I only had a vanilla cake mix  so that is what I used. Also did not have butterscotch pudding so I used 2 pkgs. of vanilla pudding, and added 1 tblsp. of instant coffee granuales to the cup of water(I used warm water so the coffee would dissolve. Used 1/2 cup of vegetable oil and 4 oz. of applesauce. The cake had great flavor. Will be making this again.

I didn't have Butterscotch pudding so I used Lemon flavor instead. Yum!!! So easy to make  and tastes so good. I made the mistake of topping with a powdered sugar/milk glaze but it made it too sweet. This is sweet enough as it is. Thanks!

Perfect coffee cake! I left off the nuts and used a cake mix that already had the pudding included.  I wouldn't change a thing, easy, cheap and delicious!

Very easy and quick to make. The cake mix I used had pudding already in it, and I added the 2 pkgs. of vanilla pudding and it came out nice and moist. It baked a Lot quick than the recipe said it would (probably because I live in the mountains) so watch out for that.

This was excellent!  My boyfriend loved it and hasn't stopped raving about it.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and used a bundt pan.  My cake mix had pudding in the mix and with the two boxes of pudding it turned out moist and delicious.  Will definitely make this again.

Oh my!!  Sooo good!  Super simple to make, too.  The brown sugar/cinnamon/walnut topping is MONEY!  you probably don't need as much as the recipe calls for but, it's so good who cares!!!  Freezes realy well too.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!  Oh yeah, and I used applesauce instead of oil!

YUM! YUM! YUM! This is one of my favorite cakes. I followed the recipe exactly as stated. I used a bundt pan which I think makes it look nicer if you look at the photos people have posted. It is moist, tastes good, different, and easy to make.

This is my go-to recipe when I'm in a pinch and need to bring along something to a get-together.  I've made it on a few separate occasions (breakfast club, for company, weekend getaway in the mountains...), and each time it is a success.  So easy- and delicious!   I've tried it with both vanilla/butterscotch puddings and vanilla/cheesecake puddings, and have enjoyed them equally.

Very moist and VERY sweet! I had many compliments on it and it is easy to make. Quick tip: for putting on the top layer of cake batter, drop the  batter by large spoonfuls in rows and then lightly blend together with a spatula. If you just pour the batter in the pan you'll get a mess with the previous cinnamon/sugar layer.

Turned out to be a great moist cake.  I made mine in an 8x11 pan.  Started to pour in the 9x13 but I thought hmmmm this is going to be thin.  So glad I made it in the 8x11 pan.  I subbed 1/2 cup apple sauce and 1/2 cup oil.  Used French vanilla cake mix, one french vanilla pudding and one butterscotch.  Next time will only make 3/4 of brown sugar/cinnamon mix as I didn't use it all.  I also added 1 tsp nutmeg to this mix.  Next time per other reviewers I think I will also try adding instant coffee to water or using left over brewed coffee for water.  I do regret not following the baking directions.  I was in a rush so left temp at 350 and I think that toasted nuts too much but it was still good.  All and all it came out great and will definitely be making it again.

I only added a butterscotch(omitting the vanilla) pudding but followed the other instructions because my cake mix contained pudding. It is a great recipe. It made a small Bundt pan and 12 cupcakes.

I made this for breakfast, but it tasted more like a birthday cake.  I'm not fond of box mix recipes but thought this one looked promising... but there are much better coffee cake recipes out there.  I will not make this again.

I'm sorry, maybe I just have a different taste than other people who rated this amazing. I followed the recipe exactly as it said and this cake did not turn out. I mean, just the way it tasted was unappealing - way too sweet and it just seemed like a really cheap tasting cake.

This was an instant hit. I used 2 butterscoch puddings instead of vanilla. Very easy to make. My bf thought I spent a great time preparing this for him....I'll let him think what he likes

This recipe is seriously moist and delicious!  The only thing I changed was that I used 2 packets of Vanilla pudding (omitting the butterscotch) and baked in a bundt pan, about 50-55 minutes.  I baked it the night before, let it cool completely, then refrigerated over night, covered in glass serving tray.  Was a hit at work and have requestst to make it again for a brunch next weekend.....thank you!!

Used 1 pkg vanilla pudding and 1 pkg butterscotch - received mixed reviews from the family. It seems the butterscotch was "too much." Will try again with 2 vanillas. Overall, a great moist coffeecake.

Delicious!  Loved by everyone at work.  I substituted brewed coffee for the water.  For the Australian members, I used Betty Crocker's vanilla cake mix and 2 Cottees vanilla puddings.  The cake is so moist and keeps well - if there are any left overs!

Thanks Janis for the recipe.  I served it for guests last night and ended up printing the recipe for every guest.  I made it exactly as written except when I went to the grocery store I picked up Sugar Free Butterscotch Pudding instead of regular Butterscotch Pudding by mistake.  It turned out excellent.  I served it with whipped Cream.  I can say my cake pan went from the table to the dishwasher with no crumbs to worry about.

Delicious!! Very moist cake and sweet, crunchy topping/filling. I baked this in a bundt pan and sprinkled some of the topping into the bottom of a well greased bundt. It stuck a little so grease well if you do this. Next time i will definitely replace half the oil with applesauce like other reviewers did.

Excellent! This really has great flavor and is super moist. The only changes I made were to replace 1/2 the oil with applesauce, baked it in two 8 X 8 pans instead of the one larger one, and I did four layers in each cake instead of two. Awesome cake, I will definitely make this again for holiday gifts. Thanks! :)

This was actually really, really good!  I'm about to make it for the 2nd time this week!  used chopped pecans instead of walnuts, and applesauce instead of vegetable oil and it came out awesome.  Great for a last minute thank you gift, potluck, etc.

Very good and moist.  I added mini-chocolate chips to the brown sugar..added less cinnamon and no nuts.  Next time I may double the topping part to have more in the middle.  Will definitely make again!!! YUM!!

This recipe is a HUGE hit!! My boyfriend and his family absolutely love it and can't get enough! My boyfriend's mom even asked for the recipe! ;) I actually prefer to use a Betty Crocker cake mix BECAUSE it has the pudding in the mix - it makes it just melt in your mouth... I cannot get enough of this recipe!!! I actually have one in the oven right now as I type this!!! :D

I used two packages of vanilla pudding rather than butterscotch and it turned out great! I only put nuts on half of the cake because my husband doesn't like them. Will definitely make this one again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Good coffee cake and very easy to put together.  I substituted applesauce for 3/4 cup of the oil and reduced the brown sugar to about 3/4 cup.  I baked it in a bundt pan and did three layers of the batter/brown sugar mix.  Yum, and it gets better after sitting for a day!

My whole family loved this. Easily the best coffee cake I've ever made. The butterscotch pudding mix gives it such a unique flavor. I used Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe, and it turned out great.

This cake is awesome.  I've never had a cake that is so moist and yummy.  We make it just for fun no special occasion needed! I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil instead of a cup of oil.  I also added chocolate chips to the batter because we love chocolate at my house!

This is my favorite quick and easy cake.  I have made this so many times and I never get tired of it.  I prefer to use the bundt pan and I thik it looks so pretty with the butterscotch color.  No one has a clue that it comes from a box, no reason to tell them either!!

Wow! This was an amazing cake! I used coffee in the place of water and chocolate pudding instead of butterscotch and it was scrumptious! It made a beautiful bundt cake and also works well as cupcakes/muffins.

I used a few substitutions on this recipe and it came out perfect. Instead of instant pudding mixes I used 1-4 oz cup of ready made vanilla pudding and 2 or 3-4 oz cups of ready made butterscotch pudding. Since the pudding is ready made, I only used about 1/2 C of vegetable oil, only 2 eggs, and a few T of water (if the consistency was not up to par.) Not sure how much this cuts down on the fat & sugar content, but I do my best! I make this just about every other weekend and the people at my work love it!

This coffee cake was too good!!!   I didn't have butterscotch pudding, so I just added another vanilla pudding.  I used 1/2 c. oil, and 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce to lighten it up a bit.  I baked it in a bundt cake pan, and it took about 20 min. longer to bake (probably due to the bundt pan and my internal oven temp. not being correct).  The coffee cake was so moist, and the layer of cinnamon and brown sugar looked so pretty in the middle.  The brown sugar even caramalized on the outside.

This was one of the best coffee cakes I've had.  Very moist and I thought the butterscotch added a nice flavor.  Next time I might trying adding the butterscotch chips like someone else suggested.  Everyone at my work really liked it.

So moist and full of flavor.  I put some of the sugar mixture on the bottom of the bundt pan so there would be some on top when you invert onto a plate.  Very easy to make with simple ingredients that are usually already in the pantry.

This was a great coffee cake! I actually made it three days before I needed it for a brunch and kept it in the basement covered in plastic. It was super moist and beautiful in a bundt pan. This will now be a staple in my recipe box. Oh yes, only use 1/2 cup of oil.

I used 2 eggs and 1/3 c of oil.  Still very moist!  After removing cake from stove, it came out flat.  It was good.  Would make it again. Omitted walnuts.

I also halved the oil and it came out perfect (with a little longer cooking time-50mins). The mother in law loved it.

Just got this one out of the oven and had to taste.  Wonderful!!!  I followed the recipe - but added melted butter to the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture and I don't like nuts so I omitted those.  Also, made my own icing for the top out of powdered sugar and milk!  It is very moist - maybe a bit too moist so next time will cut the oil down a bit.  This is going in my "keeper" file.

A GREAT hit with my husband's family (here for a reunion)!  They are asking for the recipe.  I also cut the oil in half - definitely moist enough!  Thanks!

I made this cake and sent it to church.  I didn't get to taste it, but it got rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  I used sugar-free instant pudding, substituted 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce for the oil and made 3 layers instead of 2.  Also, I baked it about 20 minutes longer than the recipe stated.

Made in bundt pan according to directions, except used 2 vanilla pudding & pecans. Made 3 layers instead of two. When cooled, drizzled half a container of white chocolate icing (melted in microwave) over the top and sprinkled a few chopped pecans over that. It smelled wonderful while baking and looked beautiful when done. It tasted every bit as good as it smelled and looked. Quite moist and flavor seems to improve on the 2nd day. Plan to make this again when my son & his wife come over for weekend dinner.

Loved this coffee cake!  Been looking for a good, easy coffee cake recipe and I've found it in this one.  So moist and well loved by whole family.  I substituted mixed nut topping for the walnuts because they're less expensive, worked fine.  I'll be making this again.

Fantastic Recipe!  This cake is incredibly moist and delicious.  I served at a brunch of 12 and everybody loved it.  I only used 75% of the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture and it was perfectly sweet.

This is an awesome and easy recipe.  Each and every time I bake this cake I'm asked for the recipe!  I've made it as "mini" Bundt cakes for a church bake sale and they sold out.  This cake is a winner!

I made this cake for a coworker's birthday party and everyone loved it.  They went crazy for it!  I made it in the bundt pan and presentation was beautiful.  The birthday boy (he turned 50) said it was the best cake he'd had in years.  Enjoy!

ok, made in bundt pan, when you flip it most of the topping falls off. If you make in bundt pan maybe put some of the topping in the pan then batter, etc.

A perfect 10!! I LOVE coffee cakes ~ my favorite dessert but this recipe takes the cake (no pun intended)!!!!! I only used 2/3c chopped walnuts and ended up not using the entire cinnamon/brn sugar/walnut mix b/c it just looked liked too much (I have about 1/3c left - which I'll just using as a way to spice up plain oatmeal for breakfast). I baked it a little bit longer on purpose b/c I like the edges a little brown but everyone I served this to wanted seconds (and a couple people I saw later took thirds!). Thanks sooo much Janis for this tasty recipe! Will make this again for sure!!!!

I made this cake for a tea party and everyone asked if I would share the recipe.  Super moist and yummy.  I make it in a bundt pan and layer the mixtures three times.  I also do not use all of the sugar/cinnamon mixture.  Easy to make and wonderful to eat!

I made this cake for a New Years brunch and it was a huge hit! I used two containers of vanilla pudding  (instead of the butterscotch) and added mini chocolate chips instead of the nuts to the cinnamon mixture. I made it in a bundt pan and (forgetting to construct the cake upside down because of the bundt pan) ended up with the extra topping that should have gone on top of the cake.  Before serving the cake, I drizzled the top with some melted butter and sprinkled the remaining topping on the cake and it was fantastic!

I made this cake with A Duncan Hines French Vanilla cake mix, one vanilla pudding and one butterscotch pudding.  1/2 cup Applesauce and 1/2 cup olive oil.  No nuts.  A wee bit heavier crumb, but tasty.  We served it warm with butter pecan ice cream and my DH had some for lunch and again at dinner.  Keeper, for a quick coffee cake with little clean up from preparation and still good flavour.  I still prefer the coffee cake recipes with sour cream, but I'm positively a sour cream lover.

World's best coffee cake! I made it in muffin cups for a bake sale. Layering took a while, but it was worth it. I did half the mix then half the sugar then the rest of the mix and the rest of the sugar sprinkled on top. I got 24 cupcakes and they were done in 17 minutes, maybe sooner.

This is one of the best coffee cakes I've ever had.  Usually coffee cakes are dry and fall apart when you try to take it out, this one was moist, fluffy, and just dense enough to not feel as though I was eating regular cake.  I loved this with my coffee last night, and loved it again this morning.

This was delicious and really quick and easy.  I did use two packages of butterscotch pudding as I was out of the vanilla.  I would probably do the same again because everyone raved about the taste.

This is wonderful, I've made it three times!  The last time I accidentally bought the Betty Crocker cake mix, which had pudding in it already so I only used 1 box of vanilla pudding.  I don't like butterscotch so I've always only used vanilla.  It bakes well and tastes even better.  I'm 31 years old and a much older and wiser woman at work said it's the best she's ever tasted, which made me feel even better about this cake!

This coffee cake is ridiculously easy to make. It is my go to when I want to bring something into the office. I mix it up all the time with different types of cake mixes and different types of putting. I will say I have problems finding the 18.25 ounce box of Cake mix but the standard 16 ounce box I find in my grocery store works great.

So easy and people go crazy for it! I like the 9x13 version better, but if you use a 9x13 pan, spread the bottom layer a little thin so you have enough to cover the middle layer of cinnamon/brown sugar.

Great cake.  I used 1/2 a cup of Canola oil instead of vegetable oil and I added 1/2 a cup of apple sauce.  Also, I used 2 packs of vanilla pudding instead of the butterscotch.  Another change I made was not adding as much brown sugar and adding Scor bits.  The Scor bits added a nice toffee flavour.

OH SO YUMMY!!!!  I made this for a family gathering at the holidays and everyone loved it.  I did not ready the reviews about getting the cake mixes without pudding mix before I went shopping so I added only one package of pudding (vanilla) and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  My family told me this is a "keeper"

This recipe was fantastic!  I was concerned it would be too sweet but it wasn't.  I did use the Duncan Hines cake mix as recommended by other reviewers.  I also used 2 boxes of vanilla because my grocery store didn't have butterscotch (I would love to try the butterscotch version!). I also wasn't sure why an entire cup of oil was necessary so I used 1/4 cup oil & 3/4 unsweetened applesauce (as recommended by others).  I threw this together in 5 minutes on Thanksgiving morning.  We had warm, fresh coffee cake with very little work.  I am going to keep the ingredients for this on hand all of the time!  So good & so easy.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!!  Oh - I also should mention that the texture of this cake was very custardy which we really liked.  I was just surprised (I shouldn't have been with the pudding & eggs in there).  When i cut into it, I thought it wasn't finished, but it was.

This is a very a good recipe.  I didn't use the butterscotch putting mix as we don't like it, but I used the big box of instant vanilla.  I also tweaked it by adding 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chip morsels to the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture.  It really made it pop!!  My husband loved it.  This recipe will be added among my regulars for potlucks now.

This was really easy to make. I omitted the nuts and used french vanilla and cheesecake pudding. My husband thought it was great and wants me to make it often. Everyone liked it at church, and there were requests for the recipe. I would have given it 5 stars, but it was too sweet for my liking, though the taste of cinnamon was just right.

This is a great coffee cake recipe.  I followed some of the suggestions posted by other reviewers.  I used 2 packages of vanilla pudding and only 3/4 cup of brown sugar.  I omitted the nuts (allergies) and they were not missed at all.  I accidentally used a cake mix that had pudding in it, but it turned out perfectly.  It was incredibly moist.  I made it for a work breakfast and it was the first thing completely gone. I had strangers seeking me out to compliment this cake.

It was easy and turned out fine, but wasn't quite what I was expecting.  It tasted good but I found it way too sweet.  More of a dense yellow cake with a lot of sugar and cinnamon than a traditional coffee cake texture.

I tried this recipe in a bundt pan and was very disappointed.  The center was mushy, it seemed like it wasnt baked all the way so I left it in the oven for an extra 10 minutes.  The outside browned nicely but the middle was still a gross gooey texture and the cake nearly broke in half where the filling was.  If I try this recipe again I will use a 9 x 13

YUMMY!!!!
Did use 2 boxes of vanilla pudding mix as that's what I had in my pantry, but other than that made exactly as directed.
BETTER than any piece of coffee cake I've bought at a bakery for sure!

This was very easy to make and as others have mentioned, it is very good to layer using 1/3 batter, 1/3 nut mixture, 1/3 batter, 1/3 nut mixture, 1/3 batter, 1/3 nut mixture. The cake came out firm and tasted very moist. I have very little baking experience and this was very easy to make. I also took the suggestions of others to use cake mix without pudding(Duncan Hines Yellow Cake Mix). The cake turned out great and everyone loved it.

This was delicious, easy and received rave reviews from everyone who had a piece. I made it exactly as noted but lowered the oil to 2/3 cup, and it was still very moist.  I also went with a Duncan Hines cake mix due to other reviewers' notes about that brand not being a "pudding in the mix" option.  This has offically replaced cinnamon rolls in my house on Christmas morning!

I substituted a Hodgson Mill's gluten free cake mix and it was delicious!  Trying now with chocolate and cheesecake pudding mixes to see what that tastes like.

Love this recipe!  I skipped the nuts, still very yummy.  I will decrease the baking time by 5 minutes next time as it was a bit dark on the bottom.  This cake becomes even better the second and third day!  Am definitely going to make this again.  Thinking of using a spice cake mix, substituting applejuice for the water and applesauce for half the oil and maybe add a bit of caramel to the layers for a fall cake!

This recipe is absolutely FANTASTIC!  I'm making it for the second time in one week.  This is the first time I have ever taken the time to review a recipe....and I am an avid baker. The week before I made this coffee cake, I tested a "from scratch" recipe for a traditional cinnamon coffee cake.  My family actually likes this cake (Cinnamon Coffee Cake II) better!!!  I'm thrilled because it is SOOOO EASY!  When I first tried this, the only cake mix I had was a Duncan Hines Spice Cake mix....so I used it.  It was yummy and I'm making the same recipe today using the spice cake mix. Everyone told me to not change a thing.  Since I used the spice cake mix, I used 2 vanilla puddings instead of 1 vanilla and 1 butterscotch.  If you are considering this.......please go ahead and try.  You won't be disappointed.  Also, use the others' tips to use "wet hands" to spread the top layer of batter......really makes a difference.  Enjoy!

This was delicious, with good texture  but still had the yellow cake mix flavor, making it more birthday- cake tasting instead of cinnamon and pastry tasting.  I made it for breakfast, so maybe that's why it seemed a bit too sweet.  It was, however, SO easy to prepare, and I liked that.  I'll make it again as a dessert.

This cake is DELICIOUS!!! EVERYONE loves it!! Nuts can go either way. Nothing 'extra' is needed. The cake is super moist! The batter is thick and sticky when mixed. That is correct - expect it. You can use cook & serve pudding but it makes an already thick batter - thicker! End result is the same. Sugar free pudding doesn't matter. Butter recipe cake mix doesn't matter. (Despite the butterscotch pudding - you really don't taste butterscotch)

No word to describe how moist, easy and delicious this is! Made no changes, just baked in a 10" springform. We all had seconds! I really think the butterscotch pudding mix adds something here....do not skip or substitute it....Thanks!

I saw this recipe & had to try it.  Here is what I had on hand.( Snowy cold day didn't want to go out)  
lemon cake mix, white chocolate pudding & vanilla pudding. I decided to try it with that,  Oh my goodness , it is delicious.  I think it's fun to try different things & this one is a  winner......

My whole family loved this. I was a little concerned about the butterscotch pudding (one daughter is not a fan) but I always like to try the recipe as is the first time (then I can compare my version). My daughter loved it! the butterscotch doesn't come out strong at all. We did a double batch and gave one to a friend who is re-doing her kitchen. They loved it too! Next time I will try a low fat version with egg beaters and apple sauce for my in-laws. Can't wait.

So simple and so yummy.  My whole family loved it.  I omitted the walnuts as I am not a fan of them.  Although next time I make it, I will add them as I know my family would enjoy it with them.  Will definitely make this again real soon.

Okay, let me say this recipe is so delicious. I made it (omitting the nuts) as cupcakes with cream cheese icing for a recent bake sale and they were a crazy big hit! People are still talking about them. I however have a hard time eating something with such a high calorie count (I calculated them to be 350 calories per cupcake with icing). So, I made some changes, now they are only 130 calories each. First I used a sugar free yellow cake mix that uses Splenda. Second I only used 1/4 c oil and supplemented with 3/4 c unsweetened applesauce. I also used sugar free vanilla and buterscotch pudding. For the eggs I used 2 whole eggs and 4 egg whites. Also I used 1/3 c of Splenda brown sugar. I am still omitting the nuts and no icing on these. Wow, they were so great! Now I can happily eat 2 for breakfast!

This is one amazing recipe! A hit with all who have had it in our bed and breakfast! If I'm out of butterscotch pudding I just put in two vanilla and that is good, too.

This was absolutely fantastic!  I omitted the nuts and layered it in thirds in a bundt pan as previously suggested.  It turned out perfectly!  It got rave reviews from friends and family and have passed along the recipe twice in 2 days!  I am going to try to use sugar free pudding, applesauce and egg beaters next time to lower the calorie/fat count.  Hoping it will be just as good!

This is a wonderful recipe.  The only problem I had was finding butterscotch instant pudding mix.  I went to 4 markets and finally used 2 packages of Vanilla instead and added some Heath crunchies for a butterscotch flavor.  At my daughter's suggestion, I also added some chocolate chips to the topping and middle brown sugar mixture.  I brought it to a brunch and they all loved this cake.  I will use this recipe on a regular basis.

Absolutely delicious!  Could easily be used as a dessert.  Very simple recipe with great results.  Used 2 boxes of vanilla pudding, since that's what we had on hand.  Highly recommend!

This was amazing!!!! I tried the lower fat version, using applesauce instead of oil, and took the advice of another and added in about 1 tblsp. of instant coffee to the water. It was fabulous! my entire family gobbled it up! It will be one that I make again and again! Oh, and I did use the butterscotch pudding and not 2 vanilla's. It was just delicious!

I have made this twice and it's turned out great each time.  It has a bit more of a moist cake texture than a slightly crumbly coffee cake, but it's so delicious that I really don't care!  Very easy, give it a try!

Easy to make, my daughter was able to help (6 yrs old) with it. I used a bundt pan and it took awhile to bake, at least 1 hour. The end result after cooling in the pan for about 15 min. was very good! Surprising light and not too sweet. The walnuts add so much!

I have been looking for an easy coffee cake recipe for years, and finally i've found it! I have made this both the following the recipe as written and i've also made the low fat recipe using apple sauce, and both were incredibly good! My family and friends all love it. So moist and easy! Definitely a keeper.

Well....it was sweet. REAL sweet. But I suppose that was to be expected, considering the ingredients.   I was trying to use up some things stocked in my pantry, so I can start eating healthier. This cake eliminated a goodly amount of unhealthy food from my kitchen, so that was a benefit.   But even if I wasn't heading down a healthier road, I wouldn't repeat this recipe.   It was lacking something, or maybe that 'something' was actually there, but was just covered up by the overwhelming sweetness.

I am NOT kidding you when I tell you this is the best coffe cake I have ever had.  I took it to a sports banquet for my daughter and I literally had people hunting me down asking me where I got the recipe.  I ended up make about 12 copies to hand out to those who asked.  I would not change anything super good and super moist.

I had some reservations about the butterscotch pudding mix but I must say, the smell that was coming out of the oven helped quell any second thoughts I had.  This is, by far, the best coffee cake I've ever had!  Thanks so much for sharing such a wonderful keeper!

This was delicious! I might try the applesauce instead of the oil next time, to make it lower in fat. And maybe some sugar free pudding next time. It was way too good to stop eating!

I have made this easy coffee cake several times  - all with terrific results.  I layer it in a bundt pan and top with a dusting of icing sugar.  Next time, I will try a caramel glaze (my hubby's idea!).

Excellent!  We used a bundt pan & put the struesel in first so it was on top when inverted.  Also used brewed decaf coffee for water.  Very moist and delicious.

Made these into muffins. Reduced topping and sprinkled on top of muffins. Cooked for twenty minutes. Not sure what the point is for the butterscotch pudding. Absolutely no butterscotch flavor came through. This was a nice moist cake and I even reduced the oil by half. I also used half whole wheat flour and one of my puddings was sugar free.

Fabulous!! Other than baking it for an additional 10 minutes and doing four layers instead of two, I made this as directed. It was DELICIOUS! So moist and full of flavor. I do think next time I will reduce the amount of brown sugar from 1 cup to 3/4 cup, because I ended up not using all of it. This will definitely be something I'll make the next time we have out of town guests - perfect for a weekend breakfast or brunch!

Made this for a brunch and it turned out great!  I used brewed coffee in place of the water and left out the nuts cause I don't like them.  Almost too moist at first, but as others have said, was much better after sitting overnight.   I think I will try with 2 vanilla pudding instead of the butterscotch though next time.  Great coffee cake and very easy!

I have too many suggestions to improve this recipe, according to the tastes of my family, so it's difficult to give this a higher rating.  Certainly a good basic recipe.  The middle layer of sugar is sweetness overload!  You couldn't get through it all... too much!  Either omit it or use a different filling recipe.  I decided against the butterscotch pudding - not enough people like that flavor - and opted for what I had on hand, which was chocolate and vanilla.  That was ok, but I'd use all vanilla next time.  Probably won't make this cake again.

This cake is amazing! I think I could live off of it! I made it exactly as the recipe says, except the nuts. I made it in a bundt pan and cooked 20 min at 350, 40 min at 325. After cooling in pan 10 minutes, it came out perfect. Next time I would try using two packs of butterscotch pudding as I couldn't really pick out that individual flavor. YUM!

Delicious!!  I used only a 1/2 cup of oil and added a 1/2 cup applesauce, and it was perfect.  If you don't overbake this cake, it will be one of the moistest cakes you'll ever eat.  I also agree with others that it tastes even better after sitting for a day or two!

This tasted like butterscotch cake instead of coffee cake. I would recommend using 2 vanilla pudding mixes.

I love this recipe. I made it with 3/4 c. applesauce and 1/4 c. oil as another person suggested. I also used about 3/4c. sugar instead of the full cup and it still came out moist and delicious!

Good coffee cake - but a little sugary for my taste. The brown sugar makes is more palatable but still I would cut back a bit for those who like subtle flavour more than in your face sweetness. Still - a great recipe and a great cake that is already half gone! I'd definitely try this again.

I have used this recipe numerous times already and love it!  This is a fast and easy recipe to feed hungry boys! Very moist, and gone in no time.  I like to put most of the nut mixture in the middle so the top does not get too crispy ~ it is all in how you like it though! I have also used the sugar free pudding and it still turns out great. I always use a 9 x 13 pan instead of the bundt so do not bake as long as it says in recipe.  Cut back about 10 15 min. Thanks for a great go to recipe!

This is the best!  My fiancé loves this dish.  He's not a fan of a huge breakfast but whenever I make this, it's gone by noon (of course, I eat my fair share too)! To make everything a little healthier, I substitute 1/2 of the vegetable oil for applesauce and I can't tell the difference.  Also, instead of butterscotch instant pudding, I use French vanilla.  This is so good!!!

I have made this two times in the last three weeks and it has been a hit. It turns out very moist. I use a cake mix with pudding. The first time I used vanilla and cheesecake pudding. The second time I used vanilla and butterscotch. The only difference was the color. They both tasted great. I baked it for 20 minutes at 350 and 25 minutes at 325.

As Is...Amazing!  You don't taste butterscotch everyone.  It is added to create the caramel-ey taste of coffee cake and add richness.  Very good recipe.  Wanted to test it before bringing to a baby shower for a best friend and have to say it will be a 'for sure recipe asking' winner!

This is the best recipe for cinnamin coffee cake ever. It is best when followed as written. Tried the applesauce and it turned out to mushy. Also tried it with a cream cheese pudding mix instead of the butterscotch and didn't like it as well. The butterscotch gives it a different flavor that mixes perfectly.

Ok..I made this Sunday Morning..it was a total flop..only one that would touch it was my 3yr old who will eat ANYTHING with cinnamon.  It just tasted...odd.  So it sat in the cake pan for 2 days.   3 yr old asked for some today (tuesday)..couldn't give it to her without testing it myself first...and WOW was is WAAAAAYYYY better two days later!!!  5 stars better.  But I had to give it a 3 star based on the fact you have to wait 2 days for it to get good.

OMG, I was surprised this was sooooo good,and very moist.I used what I had on hand.Butter Pecan cake mix and french vanilla instant pudding.I'm sure it's great with other flavors too.I also used a bundt pan (my slightly bigger one) and put half the batter,then half the cinnamon nut mixture on that.when I took it out of the pan I put it back right side up with the nut mixture on top.

This is excellent.  Everyone in the family fights over who will have it for breakfast.  I drizzle white icing over the top to make it look nicer.  I have been making this in a Bundt pan since the first time I made it in a 9 x 13 pan was unsucessful.

This tasted good, but it has a wierd spongey texture, I think due to all the pudding. I prefer a dense moist cake, not spongey.  I probably won't make this again.

My boyfriend said this was the best dessert he has EVER eaten. =D It really is the best--super simple too. The only change I made was, I added a LOT more cinnamon than the recipe called for, at least double.

This was awesome!  I used a bundt pan and ended up having to bake it for about 50 minutes before my toothpick came out clean and was very moist!  Used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil instead of the full cup of oil.  Delicious!

This was a great, easy recipe.  I went the bundt pan route and it turned out very pretty and delicious.  Definitely a keeper!  After reading other reviews, I was worried about the oil amount and butterscotch flavor, but I didn't experience the issues that others had.  Very good and a huge hit with my boys!

This recipe was fabulous. I actually used a spice cake mix with pumpkin and french vanilla pudding. I took it to a family dinner. There were not even any crumbs left.

This gets 5 stars for the simplicity of the receipe and the great taste! I've made it twice so far and everyone loves it. I bought enough puuding mixally for the next 5 times. I don't usually keep that in the cabinet.

This was good but it just tastes like yellow cake with a cinnamon brown sugar crust.  For this reason I wouldn't call this coffee cake. Just cake.

This was too rich for my liking and that is after I read the reviews and "toned" it down a bit - I made it in a bunt pan and tried to put the brown sugar mixture on the bottom so it'd be on the top when I removed it from the pan, big mistake as it was a bit too hard - I just hate coffee cake in anything other than a bunt pan...so I guess my hunt for the pefect coffee cake is unfinished.

For a recipe with a boxed cake mix, this was pretty good. I didn't have the butterscotch pudding so I used vanilla instead. It tasted like a boxed cake mix but the topping was very good. I will definitely make this again when I need a coffee cake made quickly.

I am actually afraid of this cake.  My family lost their senses.  VERY sweet and rich, but you know what?  That's what coffee cake is suppose to be like!  You drink coffee to cut the sweetness and have one peice (or if your'e like us, three or four!).  My husband smelled it and turned the oven light on and commented that it looked like "and evil cake we won't be able to stop eating"...he was right!  Easy, easy...beautiful presentation, moist, and absolutely delish.  Thanks!!

For those put off by the "orange color" and didn't care for that, sub the butterscotch pudding for another vanilla or other flavor.  Mine turned out beautiful, though.

This is fabulous!  My husband and mom raved about it!  Next time, I'll make a crunchier/thicker icing (maybe two icings, and one with cinnamon in it) since my husband prefers that over the confectioner's glaze made from powdered sugar and milk. *Update*  I've made this at least two or three more times since the first try at Thanksgiving.  Gets great reviews every time!  I've even tweaked it to make a lemon-cherry coffe cake using lemon cake mix and vanilla/lemon pudding(minus the brown sugar and cinnamon).

I made this cake many, many times in the seven years since I discovered it. It continues to be a crowd pleaser. I made it today, in a 9" x 13" pan for the first time! I've always made it in a bundt pan. I also used a white cake mix today as it was all I had in the pantry. Thank you!

This cake was super easy to make.  I made some minor adjustments to the recipe.  I used one pkg of vanilla pudding and one pkg of cheesecake pudding (instead of butterscotch) and it was a huge hit.  My finance asked that I make it to take to his mom's for Thanksgiving.  It was a big hit with his coworkers and the neighbors so I'll keep this recipe and use it often.  Thanks

first of all I love this site!! second, this recipe is everyone's favorite!  I'm so happy I found it!  I've made it with just the vanilla pudding and also with both the vanilla and butterscotch.  Mostly eveyone says it's better with both.  But it's still so yummy with just the vanilla.  It's just sweeter with both :)

A very nice, easy recipe.  I followed it exactly, and it was quite tasty.  I brought it to a pot luck brunch, and it disappeared.  Thanks so much.

My family loved this cake so I made another and took it to work.  It was gone in an hour!  I'm not a fan of butter scotch so I used 2 packs of vanilla pudding.  Great recipe!  Will definitely make it again.

I had to leave out vanilla pudding.  Substituted 1 tea. of vanilla.  This still came out very moist and good.  Great recipe.  Followed baking instructions exactly.

This recipe is very easy to make.  I used pumpkin spice pudding mix instead of butterscotch and it turned out great.  The recipe is too sweet though.  I would make it again but cut down on the sugar somehow - maybe with sugar-free pudding or splenda brown sugar.

Excellent and very easy! I used 2 pkgs vanilla pudding, 1 cup of apple sauce instead of oil, and no nuts. I just cut it and it's almost all gone! Everyone loves it! Can't wait to try it with butterscotch pudding and other variations.

Very good coffee cake and quite easy.  Next time I will put all of the sugar/cinnamon mixture between the layers of batter because I thought the sugar on top of the batter tasted a little burned. I baked it in a Bundt pan with great success.

To make it more healthy, I used applesauce instead of oil (comes out more moist!). I didn't put any nuts in it since I'm not a fan of them (and too many nut allergies among my friends). I get requests for this every brunch I go to! It's even better the next day because the flavors settle in. Mmm!

"The best Birthday cake I've ever had" was what I was told about this cake.  I reduced the oil to 3/4 cup and added 1cup butterscotch chips to the brown sugar mixture.  Baked in a bundt pan.  May next time more butterscotch chips!

I made this for mother's day and it was a huge hit for brunch!  My husband asked me to make it for father's day and my son asked me to make it for his birthday. I layered 3 times, adding  chocolate chips in 2 of the layers,I halved the oil and the cinammon mixture and baked it for 10 minutes longer in a bundt pan.  Next time I will halve everything but the walnuts.  If you have any leftovers, this keeps really well.
***Note 1/2/07***  I've made this many times and just made a new version which is fabulous.  I added dried cherries instead of chocolate chips.  Used 2 pkgs of vanilla pudding.  Toped lightly with a maple sugar glaze...YUM!

DELICIOUS!!! I used a regular 9x13 pan and it turned out great, it is dense, but I loved it like that, like others said, even better the next day!  Such an easy recipe!  This recipe was the talk of the brunch it was brought to.

Very, very good.  A "MUST KEEP" recipe.  I made it last night and it is half gone this morning.  It will be history before tonight.

This turned out to be a little bland. I think maybe a little more sugar was needed.My husband does not like really sweet things, so he really liked this. Thank you.

Excellent recipe!  The cake is moist and very flavorful -- and very easy to throw together.  I did not have a yellow cake mix in the house, so I used a spice cake mix and vanilla for both packages of pudding.  Turned out great.  My coworkers devoured it in no time and were asking for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Very delicious!  I had to make a few substitutions to fit the ingredients that I had.  I used a butter pecan cake mix and 2 vanilla puddings.  Then instead of walnuts I used pecans!  My ladies group loved it!!!!

Very easy recipe!  Received many compliments & requests for the recipe when I took it to work.  Used bundt pan...cooked 10 min. longer.  Changes: used 3/4 cup veg. oil (still VERY moist & YUMMY!) used 1/4 cup white sugar & 3/4 cup brown sugar, drizzled with vanilla glaze to make pretty since the cake is dark, layered 3 times instead of 2.  Everyone said this is a keeper!

This was okay. It didn't blow me away with flavor. It tasted like "another box mix" and I was hoping for more. I probably won't make it again.

This was great.  Made it in 9x14 pan.  The guys were going to sleep late at the lakes, but as soon as they smelled it, they were up for the day.  Lol I wanted to do some early fishing.  Got my wish.

The cake in this coffee cake is simply delicious. For my taste the nut mixture was a bit sweet, but I brought it to work and everybody loved it. I will definitely make this again but will cut the nut mixture down to about half.

Used the recipe (only changes are: I couldn’t find butterscotch instant pudding, so used 2 vanillas and no nuts) and it turned out great. Adults and kids loved it / everyone wanted seconds. I use a Bundt pan, so I start with the brown sugar / cinnamon mix and then alternate from there. Overall, it’s delicious and super easy!

For years I've made a favorite recipe from my late mother, which is a sour cream based coffee cake. I tried this out of curiosity and speed of mixing. I thought it was...okay...but I think TWO pudding mixes in it were overkill. The cake was way too moist after baking, and was only truly cake like after sitting in the refrigerator. I might experiment by using only one pudding mix and baking it in my regular oven, not an electric roaster. (My roomie is celiac and I have to clean the oven after every time I bake to keep from poisoning her. Thus the alternative baking.)

I made this recipe has is in a 9 x 13 pan with two layers and my very fussy family ate it in one day!  ??? I only had the cook and serve butterscotch pudding + instant vanilla pudding and it was still absolutely amazing.   If you cut a piece after it had been out for a while, just put it in the microwave and it tastes like it is fresh out of the oven.   This is so easy and definitely will make again!???. Maybe next time I will trade other reviewer‘s suggestions of adding a little icing on top to make it pretty - in a Bundt pan.

We have made this every year for Christmas as our birthday cake for Jesus.  I don' t  add the  nuts as my kids don't like them.  And I use 2 french vanilla pudding instead of one butterscotch and 1 french vanilla.  Tastes even better the next day.

Big hit at a family function.  I substituted butter for the oil and milk for the water out of habit.  Was moist and delicious, no need for icing.

I wanted enough to make for three neighbors, plus a pan for my family, so I doubled the recipe.  It was so easy to throw together, and came out moist, delicious, and aesthetically pleasing, as a bonus. It was the perfect sweet tooth remedy. Also, the smell of coffee cake in the house in heavenly!

I've made this a few times and it always comes out without disappointment.  I've btw never put in the pudding.  Seemed redundant.  I've always paid attention to the recommended oven temperature so the topping doesn't get over done.  It's delicious.

I used two vanilla pudding packs instead of one vanilla pudding pack and one butterscotch pudding pack.  I also doubled the ingredients for the crunch/crumble bit.

Fabulous, easy cake.  Next time I’ll try to substitute some of the oil with applesauce as others have suggested.

I made this with banana pudding because my grocery didn’t have butterscotch.  It turned out perfectly.  I made it nine hours ago and even though there are only two of us:  it’s already gone!!!

I made it as written- it was delicious! Only sub out the butterscotch if you must b/c it really makes the cake. I think I may try with a spice cake mix next time and a cream cheese drizzle.

The recipe is quite good; however, cake mixes(at least in my area) are now only sold in 15 oz boxes. This small disparity makes the end result come out more pudding-like and wet than it should be. I would love to know if anyone has successfully adjusted this recipe to the smaller cake mix size without wasting a partial box of pudding or having to measure numerous tablespoons of oil and water.

I am used to making my coffee cake from scratch.  So using this recipe with store bought cake, etc., was certainly much easier to do than from scratch.  It was also pretty darn tasty as well.  Now I am not sure if I'll go back to mixing up a cake from scratch.  Hmmm.

I came across this recipe about ten years ago after a customer sent a Boston Coffee Cake Company Original Cinnamon Walnut cake and I was after a recipe that tasted just like it.  This is not only darn close but super easy to make starting with mixes.  It's hard to find 18.25 oz cake mix anymore but it works just fine with 15.25 oz, and the recipe does omit letting it cool in the pan for a bit before inverting (I always forget that part because it's not on the recipe and I always make it in a Bundt pan).  So a chunk nearly always breaks off in the pan because the brown sugar layer caramelizes and sticks when it cools.  Oh, and when making it in a Bundt, sprinkle a little in FIRST before the batter so the topping will actually be on the top!

Delicious and so easy.  I used cheesecake pudding mix instead of butterscotch.  I baked it in six mini loaf pans at 350 for 40 minutes -- nice for gifting at Christmas time.  I love cinnamon so used a heaping tablespoon, and it was perfect.

I made this for Thanksgiving! It's awesome! The only note I would make is that you don't need as much brown sugar as the recipes calls for!! Otherwise, I followed this recipe as stated and it's great! Very moist and yummy! Will make again!

I didn’t have two smaller packages of pudding so used just the one larger (~5oz) vanilla package. I also skipped nuts because of tree but allergies. After reducing to 325 I checked after 25 min, and the toothpick was clean, so I removed the cake from the oven. It was very, very moist and quite tasty, and sweet like I expected. I’d definitely make it again.

I followed another reviewer’s suggestion and made muffins instead of a cake. Substituted 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil instead of the full cup of oil as included in the original recipe. I had too much cinnamon mixture and would use less sugar next time, but keep same amount of cinnamon and walnuts. Tip for walnut chopping: put walnuts in ziploc or reuseable bag and crush with your hands.

Very good, moist and super easy for a potluck breakfast buffet.  I basically followed the recipe (though adjusted down to accommodate the new standard 15.25 oz cake mix). I did not add the nuts to the topping mix.  As suggested in a review, added a bit of glaze in lines across the top which made a pretty presentation.  It was a bit sweet for my tastes but very well received at the buffet.  Thanks for the recipe and the helpful reviews.

Delicious! Like many others I cut the amount oil used. 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. Everything other aspect of the recipe was followed. The recipe is quite sweet but I know my co-workers will inhale it!

I have been making this for quite awhile.  I always make  this cake with all sugar free products.  It is just as great (not as sweet) as the original recipe.!!!  This is one of my go to recipe's for a quick potluck idea.  I never have any leftovers.  Love it!!

This is a great cake!  It is a hit ever time I make it.  Instead of  just using the topping, I make more of a crumble which has butter in it. It adds a little extra flavor and moistness to the cake. As soon as it is cool enough to eat, my family devours it. Never any leftovers.

The cake turned out really good...I made the following changes 
added 1 tsp instant coffee in water and used 2 vanilla instant pudding 
also added 3/4 cup of Apple sauce 
I never used the whole cinnamon and sugar mixture...I think I ended up use half the mixture and that was just enough.
the batter does turn out to be really thick but the end result was wonderful. for sure give it a try

Excellent recipe!  the only thing i changed was the butterscotch pudding (eww). i tried it with 2 vanilla pudding and again with vanilla and cheesecake pudding. loved the cheesecake/vanilla pudding combo the best. also i don't use nuts as not everyone likes them in my family. followed the directions and have a wonderful coffee cake in the mornings with my coffee! thank you so much for this recipe!!! UPDATE - i played with this and fyi - i use canola oil and add 1 tsp vanilla extract. i cannot seem to get the layers even, but still looks pretty and tastes even better!

I have a brunch every Christmas morning. 3 years ago I added this coffee cake and it was a hit with everyone. I make it 2 days ahead of time, as someone suggested and I switch out the butterscotch pudding with cheesecake. This will be a staple on Christmas morning. Thank you!

Let me just start out with this disclaimer: I ain’t no baker.  So I wanted something easy but impressive for our Thanksgiving brunch. This was it. My family went bananas for this. I would definitely make this again.  Really yummy.

I also use 1//2 cup of oil/ 1/2 cup melted butter, .
  you can also substitute  1/2 milk and 1/2 oil,  desired...

I make this often. I make it just like the recipe stated. Sometimes, I can't find instant butterscotch pudding and substitute the one that you have to cook. I don't cook it. I just add it the same way and it comes out fine. 
My family likes this anytime of day. I have made it for a brunch and it was a big hit. It is super moist. Everyone seems to love it.

Omg! I could eat this whole cake but I am not supposed to eat sugar and this does have a little. I made it to take to a family event so glad it is going out of the house. I had a bite and can't wait to share. I used a Pillsbury cake mix as that was all I had and it worked excellent so don't worry about it. I did use 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce and it was wonderfully moist. This will be my go-to coffee cake.

Ya, I altered the recipe but if it wouldn't have turned out, I would NOT be reviewing it.  This was EXCELLENT.  I was so excited I had butterscotch pudding on hand & then whoops, it was cook & serve.  I went with the 2 instant vanilla instead.  I layered 1/3 batter, 1/3 brown sugar mix, etc.  Before I added the last 1/3rd of batter, I added a single layer of frozen raspberries (I'm sure you could use any berry) & topped that with the last 1/3rd of the batter.  To the last 1/3rd of the brown sugar mix I added a couple Tbsp of butter & mixed until crumbly & sprinkled over the top.  It was absolutely delicious!

I made this Coffee Cake last night before bed. My family and I cut into it this morning for our breakfast treat. It is delicious! All four of us like it. I will make this again. I had to use Pecans instead of Walnuts because that is what I had in the cupboard, but honestly, that did not make a difference. I followed the recipe exactly as written for all of the rest of it and it turned out very tasty. Thank you for this recipe. I know it will become a favorite in my home.

Very easy and super moist.  Followed some reviewers advice and made it a day ahead for the flavors to really blend.  I used 2 boxes of vanilla pudding (not a fan of butterscotch) and tripled the amount of cinnamon!  YUM!    Next time I'll try using pecans in place of walnuts.

My husband loves coffee cake, which I have never made, so I figured I'd try this one out for him. He loved it. Only thing for me, I always make my cakes from scratch, and could definitely tell this was from a box due to it being so light. I will keep this recipe to make for him, but might keep searching for a more dense cake. Thanks for the submission though. Great cake and not too sweet like some say.

In what way can cake be too sugary? The brown sugar and walnut mix is essentially a frosting. Delicious without any changes to the recipe. I will definitely make this cake again.

This coffee cake goes together quickly and is pretty much fail-proof.  The big guy absolutely loved it.  I tweaked the recipe slightly by using a french vanilla cake mix and sugar-free french vanilla and cheesecake pudding mixes and I increased the brown sugar-cinnamon-nut (I used pecans) mixture by half.  The flavor was incredible.  The cake was fragrant and moist and  not too dense.  The extra brown sugar-cinnamon-nut mixture provided additional crunchiness and sweetness.  This is excellent with your morning coffee or afternoon tea.  With the oil and sugar it's not the healthiest thing to eat, but it certainly makes for a lovely special treat.  Will definitely make this again.

Made this recipe for the super bowl. What was left was greedily divided up for left overs. Followed the directions exactly with the exception of omitting nuts on 1/2 for the kids. It was a huge success. Will definitely keep this one in the rotation!

My go-to coffee cake recipe.  Started making this with my grandchildren when they were learning to cook because it was easy for them.  Continued because it's so delicious!  It's our traditional Christmas morning breakfast.  Gets better each day, but has never lasted at our house for more than three days!

Excellent moist coffee cake! I did add 2 tablespoons of coffee to the water. And I baked in a greased, bundt  pan. It did stick a bit but I was able to get it out of the pan whole. I added confectioners sugar to hide any of the imperfections. Very, very tasty and easy to make! Thank you, Janis for sharing!

I made it exactly as written using a Bundt pan and it was delicious!  The only change I would make is the next time to divide the batter into thirds, ending with batter on the top - so when it is flipped over on a serving plate, the filling will be baked in and not left on the plate!

I used 2 boxes instant vanilla pudding instead of the butterscotch, only because I was using ingredients I already had.  It was EXCELLENT!!!! Everyone loved it!  Very moist and delicious, not too sweet.  Easy to make and very delicious.

Fantastic! I used one vanilla and one cheesecake pudding mix. Also used 3/4c applesauce and 1/4c oil instead of straight oil. Baked in a Bundt pan.  Next time I will start with the walnut mixture first, since you invert the cake when it is done.  I mentioned trying to add some diced apples next time, but my SO said "Don't - it's too close to perfect already!"

This was very very good. My 20 year old son loved it and asked me to make it again the next day. I did substitute a banana cream pudding mix for the butterscotch since i am not a fan of butterscotch.

I made mine in a 9x13 pan and it came out looking like a flat, very brown cake with a misshapen top. The streusel topping on mine didn't stay beautiful like you'd expect it would. Next time I'll make it in a Bundt pan instead.

Absolutely delicious! I just didn't add the walnuts. But I did take a knife and swirl the cake and topping so it was mixed in a little bit more. Great recipe thank you for sharing!

This is really, REALLY good coffee cake! My wife said it was on par with her mother's cake (she would never say it was better). I'm not a huge butterscotch fan so I used vanilla and cheesecake pudding as suggested by another user. Home run!

I made this exactly as suggested with two TINY changes. First, I did three layers of batter/sugar instead of just two and I switched out 1/2 the water for coffee. It is easy and amazing! So, so tasty! I actually made two. One regular in a bunt pan and a gluten free version using Pillsbury GF cake mix. It takes just as good and the regular. Quick note: GF products take longer to cook. It took more like 1 hour and 15 mins to 1 hour and a half to cook the GF in the 9x13. Also, things take longer to cook in a bunt pan. After the suggested cooking time, I checked it every 10 mins. It took about an hour and 15 for it to be done.

I made these in to muffins (or cupcakes depending on your perspective!). They made 24 regular sized muffins. I made a rookie mistake of thinking I could layer in a cinnamon layer, it just floated to the top when they were baked. So I would recommend just simplifying things and putting the brown sugar mixture on the top. I baked them at 350 degrees C for about 30 minutes when it was all said and done. I started with the box recommendation for cupcakes (~15 min) and they were clearly not done. I did bake both muffin pans together, so that could make a difference, but I finally took them out when the edges were slightly brown. They maintained the coffee cake taste and the topping had a slight crust to it and it tasted excellent!

I made this tonight even though I didn't have any walnuts, no butterscotch pudding & only had spice cake mix on hand. I used two boxes of vanilla pudding instead. I also substituted applesauce for the oil & removed one egg yolk to lighten up the recipe. It turned out excellent in a 9x13 pan. Next time I may eliminate another egg yolk or two but I'm pretty sure I'm going to stick with the spice cake mix. Thank you for the great recipe!

Keeping this recipe. I used French vanilla puddings and cake mix. In place of oil I used about 1/3 c sour cream, 1/3 c applesauce and 1/3 c oil and it came out great.  Used the bundt pan. Company loved it and it was so easy.

Made exactly as directed, turned out moist and delicious! Very easy and quick to throw together for a warm, home-made coffee cake.  Perfect for those who, like my family, have a serious sweet tooth and like a dense texture as opposed to a light or fluffy one.  Thank you!

I made it in a 9x13 pan and misjudged how much batter to use on the bottom layer.  I was worried it would come out too heavy in flavor with all the brown sugar near the top.  It came out wonderful.  A new favorite!!!

If I could give 10 stars I would. Wow!!! So good and so simple. I used two vanilla puddings only because I couldn't find butterscotch but wow this is amazing. My boyfriend absolutely loved it. Will definelty be making this again!

This coffee cake had been a favorite in my house for years! Super easy and quick. I use a cake mix that already has pudding in it and just add one box of vanilla pudding. Definitely a little sweet for me but my husband and kids never have complaints. It's a must make recepie.

Love this .... HOWEVER ... To those who say it takes longer to cook, or doesn't cook all the way through ... keep in mind that many cake mixes no longer come in 18.25 oz.  They reduced the size to 16.5 oz (or less).  You need to make an adjustment accordingly in the amount of liquid you use in your recipe.

This cake is absolutely divine.  I sometimes sit down with the whole pan and eat entire rows at a time.  It's THAT good.  Perfect for an indulgent breakfast or a dessert that's not so common.  Don't change a thing!

I love making this cake on birthdays topped with a light whipped cream cheese icing. It is delicious and well loved in my family! The only reason I didn't give it a full five stars is because for some reason the cake never seems to fully cook for me no matter how much extra time I give it in the oven...Maybe its the pudding in the batter that gives it a runny consistency and I do follow the recipe to the T....weird. But delicious cake all the same!

I liked this and the women's group at my church liked it, but my husband didn't care for it.  It needed just a bit more cooking time.  I used cheesecake and lemon pudding by accident and I thought it was good.  I'd certainly make it again.

Fabulous! To make it a bit more "coffee" , I add a packet of instant cappuccino to the water before mixing. I make a glaze of powdered sugar, vanilla and a touch of freshly brewed coffee to drizzle over the cake after it has cooled slightly. My German,coffee cake loving friend loves this cake. As other reviewers have said, this is even better the next day.

Super delicious! The cake was delectably moist. The cinnamon and brown sugar flavors compliment the vanilla and butterscotch flavors very nicely. My only issue was that the batter was very thick, hard to mix, and hard to spread. But it was so worth it!!!!!

I made this for my hubs and dad for Father's Day. Hubs took one bite and said "Oh my god, that is soooo good!". Definitely a keeper and one that I will be making to impress company. Very easy. My grocery store did not have instant butterscotch so I used 2 packs of vanilla pudding. I wish I could stop eating the leftovers

This coffee cake was a huge hit! I subbed the nuts for instant oats and added a little nutmeg and clove with the cinnamon. I also added a little milk because the mixture was really thick. I will definitely make this again!

I made this last night to take to work this morning, and it was a hit! I went by the recipe with just a few alterations. I used pecans instead of walnuts, baked about 5 mins less than stated in the recipe, and added the powdered sugar glaze after cake was cool (whisked approx 1C powdered sugar, a few Tbs milk, and vanilla, although, had this been a weekend, bourbon would have probably been tasty in there). It was a very simple recipe that produced a very moist cake. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!

great cake!! made a couple small changes due to a nut allergy...only used 3/4 c of oil, substituted toffee bits for the nuts and used butterscotch for both pkgs of pudding...when out of the oven, I drizzled caramel syrup over the top....best toffee coffee cake I've made!! was a huge hit!!

I LOVED this cake. In fact my whole family did, and my mother couldn't stop taking slivers of it! I used the Betty Crocker yellow cake mix which is slightly less than the 18.2 oz, I believe it was 15.8 or around there. I just cut back a tiny bit of oil and a little less water than the recipe calls for. I also ended up grabbing cook & serve butterscotch pudding instead of instant, but I had no problems with using the cook & serve. The cake rose perfectly and was marbled with beautiful ribbons of brown sugar. My only issue was the brown sugar topping had far too much of it. I ended up having about 1/2 a cup left over of the brown sugar mixture because I felt if I had added all of it, the brown sugar would have been overwhelming. My result was a nice, rich cake with a great flavor and not overly sweet. I lightly frosted half of it with a coffee butter icing that I found on this website and it turned out delicious! I baked it 15 minutes less than the recipe states, if I had baked it any more, it would have been crispy and burnt on the edges. Keep an eye on the cake because after 30 minutes in the oven, it starts to bake quickly!

My boys loved this recipe, I made it for my middle bonus son's birthday and it barley lasted 2 days in the house. I used some of the modifications, using two packages of vanilla. otherwise I did everything exactly as it said.

Great cake, very easy to make. I followed other suggestions using 2 vanilla puddings based on taste preferences. I had trouble making a center layer with the cinnamon topping; the cake batter is thick from the pudding and doesn't spread in the pan easily. The second time I made it, I put all of the batter in the pan, then dumped the cinnamon topping on top, and used a knife to swirl it in, similar to a marble cake. This made the topping less crumbly, too (though it's delicious no matter what you do!).  I put the walnuts in the food processor to hide them from my kids, and added 1/4 cup extra walnuts for additional crunch/texture. Save time and put the cinnamon and brown sugar in the food processor, too! Very quick, simple, and delicious!

I made this with two vanilla puddings instead of butterscotch and it was delicious.  I made this for a family brunch and there was nothing left at the end.  Everyone kept asking for the recipe.  I will have to make this again and try different flavor puddings.

I love this recipe! Made it multiple times and it never fails me. I'm actually baking it right now for  my office but I used 2 packages of pumpkin spice pudding and Im going to finish it off with a light cinnamon cream cheese icing. I have no doubt it will come out amazing. Pics to come!

This recipe is super quick and pretty much fool proof! I only had cake mix with pudding in it so I used that with one box of pudding mix instead of two. I kept all other ingredients the same and the cake turned out moist and delicious. It does have 1 cup of vegetable oil so next time, I may replace half with apple sauce and see how that goes.

Delicious recipe I think what really makes this recipe tasty is the unexpected mild flavor that the butterscotch pudding gives the muffins or cake. We made mini muffins and full size muffin and everyone at work loved them!!! I did use a mix with pudding in it and it turned out fine.

So good!!!  Only had a 1/2 cup of walnuts other wise I didn't change a thing.  I did use a bundt pan.  Put some cinnamon sugar mixture on bottom of pan,  then pour half batter,  then almost the remaining mixture, rest of batter, then the remaining mixture on the top.  Ever bite had the cinnamon mixture in it.  So moist so good.

Easy & delicious! Made as directed minus the nuts due to allergies for a morning meeting at work. Everyone loved it, have numerous requests for the recipe. Made it the night before, and reviews are right when they say it's better the next day! My BF was hoping there would be extra to bring home, will definitely make this again! Thank you for the recipe!

I have made this coffee cake many times for my Dad, he loves it! I use a bundt pan and do 4 layers. Also, I like to switch up the flavors of pudding mixes, and they turn out great! My kids really love it with the Banana Cream pudding mix! Like other reviews, it does taste the best after a day or two!

The only change I make is to use a box of Hershey's white chocolate instant pudding mix and a box of vanilla. I've tried the butterscotch (and many, many other combinations) and for my family, the white chocolate and vanilla result in the best final cake by far.

Sweet, moist, and tasty! I used a 'pudding in mix' cake box so I skipped the 2nd pudding (also didn't have 1 in the cabinet). Subbed 1/2 cup of cinnamon applesauce for 1/2 of the oil, you would never know.  Baked 20 minutes at 350 and 30 minutes at 325.  I think diced apples would be a nice addition to this cake, next time...

With a few changes this was fantastic!!! I used half melted butter and half coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil. The cake mix I had already had pudding in the mix so I added just one package of coconut pudding mix (thats what I had on hand. I also doubled the cinnamon.

I followed the recipe exactly and found it way too sweet for my family's taste.  Also, I expected it to be a rich, moist cake, but what I got was what seemed to be an under-baked consistency.  I served it warm with vanilla ice cream on the side.

Made this in a bundt pan and other than me overcooking by a few minutes, this was FANTASTIC!! I followed the recipe exactly, using a Duncan Hines cake mix and could not have been happier.  I think it maybe lasted two days and we could not keep our hands off it.

Hoo boy, is this sweet!  I used sugar-free pudding (one vanilla and one cheesecake) and Splenda Brown, and it was still tooth-achingly sweet.  Next time I will leave out the pudding and just make the cake or something...that being said, my husband is eating a big square of this with ice cream and raving about how good it is, so, to each his own!

Taste is phenomenal, but the texture could be better.  I would make this again, but I would definitely let it cook longer.  I baked at 325 in a convection oven for 40 minutes, which should be about the same as cooking at 350 in a conventional oven, and although the toothpick came out clean, this cake is very dense and as other reviewers have mentioned, almost too moist.

I tried this recipe and it was very sweet. I made some changes. I don't like butterscotch so, I used one vanilla pudding and one cheesecake flavored pudding.  I used 1/2 cup of vegetable oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce. Used 3/4 cup of brown sugar and two teaspoons of cinnamon. (You could probably use even less, if you find it too sweet)   I layered it three times instead of two. I used a bundt cake pan. You have to cook it longer in the bundt pan..... At least ten minutes. I get rave reviews on this every time I make it.

Amazingly delicious and easy to whip up and clean up! I tried it with chocolate and vanilla pudding but it wasn't as good as the butterscotch and vanilla. I may try adding a layer of blueberries next time! Wonderful recipe, thank you for sharing!

I love how easy it is to make this and the flavor is wonderful.  Instead of using a package of vanilla I add pumpkin spice pudding with the butterscotch. So much better flavor.

Wish I could give this 10 stars!!  I do not understand how this cake gets moister as the days go by but it really does.  The only modification I make is that I increased the cinnamon to 2 TBS (and used the spicier fancy Vietnamese kind from Pensey's) and it is unbelievable!

I made this for our Church's Potluck Breakfast and it was a hit. They loved it. It was the first time I made it and I normally don't bring in something until I've tried it first. But, this time, I was very
pleased with it.I plan to make it again for our next Potluck Breakfast.

This recipe has way too much sugar. I used a cake mix with pudding, so I only added the butterscotch pudding. Next time I will use half the sugar in the cinnamon mixture there was WAY to much. I ended up making three layers.

This was absolutely wonderful! The best coffee cake recipe I've used. I took one of the other users suggestions and I added a couple teaspoons of instant coffee to the water before I put it in the dry ingredients. I also used 2 boxes of vanilla pudding instead of 1 butterscotch and 1 vanilla but other than that I followed it to the letter and it is very easy to make and comes out wonderful. I will definatly use this recipe again!

Great coffee cake fix!  Tastes like coffee cake but not quite the same consistency.  It was my first time making the cake so I followed the recipe as is except that I didn't have enough walnuts so I used a 50/50 mix of walnuts and almonds.  The batter is thick and heavy and is very hard to spread.  A bunt pan might be easier to layer the cake.  It was not overly sweet and it cooked through with no trouble - though when I tried cutting it seemed like it was not done, but it was.  I would imagine that 2 vanilla pudding mixes would make it sweeter.  It does taste better the second day (though it is pretty darn good warm from the over) and I can't wait to see what day three brings!  Everyone who tries it wants more and the recipe!

Really amazing and super easy! Like others I used cheesecake pudding instead of butterscotch since I'm not a butterscotch fan. Also, by accident I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts.

I have made coffee cake from scratch several times that is really yummy.  But this is SO much easier which makes it that much tastier!  I cooked at the first temp for 20 minutes, second temp for 25 minutes.  Maybe my oven cooks faster.  Yum!

Not really impressed for the reviews it had. Did follow directions with everything it had, even using the butterscotch & vanilla flavors. Flavor was ok, maybe instead of doing a layer in the middle it should be swirled. Texture I didn't like so much, it was ok with moisture, but still a tad dry. I did in a 9x13, but maybe it should have been done in a Bundt.

Delicious & moist! I only had one box of jello (sugar free cheesecake) & that worked fine. I used 1/2 unsweetened applesauce & 1/2 oil. The batter was thick so it was a bit tricky layering the top half over the brown sugar mixture. I let the batter drop from my spatula then carefully connected the drops until the entire top was covered. Also, I used a 9x13 pan & only baked for 20 minutes after turning the heat down; so a total of 40 minutes.

Everyone loved it, I used 2 boxes of pumpkin spice pudding mix instead of the vanilla and butterscotch because it was what I had at the time and it was terrific  it was gone in one afternoon I will certainly make this again using the vanilla and butterscotch which I am sure will be just as good. THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE GREAT RECIPE

I made this for a work brunch and everyone raved about it!  I felt guilty because it was so simple to make.  I did only use vanilla pudding and added a teaspoon of instant coffee to the water.  Delicious!

I made this yesterday and brought it into work.  I used vanilla pudding only, since I had that in the pantry.  It was inhaled by my co-workers and disappeared really fast. I received so many raves and recipe requests!  thank you for posting this recipe.  I know I will make it often.

This was the best coffee cake I have ever eaten. I took this to a church function and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. The only changes I made were I used 1 large box of vanilla pudding only and I added instant coffee to the water as others suggested. I didn't bake near as long as mine was done after 25 minutes of the reduced 325 temperature. This will definitely be made again and again, would be perfect for Christmas morning !! Edited to add years later and this recipe is a staple in our home.  My children ask for this cake for their birthday every year instead of cake with icing.  A delicious cake!!!

Easy and delicious.  It takes like what you expect cinnamon coffee cake to taste like.  It seemed a little undercooked after 35 minutes of additional cooking so I'm baking it for the full 40 additional minutes next time.

This was a very moist and very easy recipe to make. I always read the reviews with the ratings prior to making a new recipe for hints on how to make the recipe. This recipe is so moist and has a great flavor! I used milk instead of water and I added a dash of lemon juice to the milk. I used two packages of vanilla instead of the butterscotch. I layered the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture then swirled it all together(still allowing most of the brown sugar/cinnamon on top). I used the Duncan Hines yellow cake mix. I will be making this again!

Wow!!  This is sooooo good!  It is so moist and full of flavor.  It is so good it can be dessert, not just coffee cake.  It's really easy too.  I had been looking for a cinnamon roll recipe, but decided to try this instead since it seemed so much easier than making cinnamon rolls.  I was not disappointed!  When you want a homey, old fashioned dessert this is the one!!

I made this yesterday in a bundt pan & took it to church this morning. It was excellent! Had lots of people asking for the recipe. The only thing I didn't do was put nuts in it, as I forgot to buy any. I would put pecans in it, but it is also very good without any nuts. Very moist. Wonderful recipe.

This cake is really good.  I've made it twice now, the first time I had one box regular instant butterscotch and one box sugar free butterscotch.  Second time around I used one butterscotch and one french vanilla.  I think I liked the double butterscotch more.  I haven't made it with nuts yet,  but will be making this again soon with 2 butterscotch and nuts (can't wait!)  Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe!

The best on the site, in my opinion! I've tried several other recipes here and this has remained our family's favorite! You can sub for the butterscotch pudding if you can't find it, but it DOES taste better with it, richer and darker? ( : VERY TASTY!!!

this was awesome!  I think my husband ate half of it!!!  I don't like butterscotch so I don't have any in my house so I used a cheesecake pudding mix and it was fantastic.  The thing that I was most worried about was that the batter was sooo thick...apparently it is supposed to be that way because it was fantastic!

Oh my was this great....I made it just like the recipe said ONLY  apple sauce substituted for 1/2 of the oil.  I also put only a 1/3 on the bottom layer of cake batter. I sprinkled the nuts on 3/4 of the cake as I didn't know how many would eat nuts at the brunch I was going to.  Tasted like a really expensive bakery made it.  Also I made it in a 13X9 pan w/o icing.

This was just the coffee cake recipe I was looking for.  Everyone raved about it.  The only change I made was the 1/2 applesauce &  1/2 oil.  I just baked one as is and its cooling right now. Thanks for the great recipe!

Good recipe. Mine came out dense and moist. I made a sugarfree version and warmed sugarfree vanilla frosting as my icing drizzle. I'm pretty satisfied with how it turned out!

This was super easy using the ingredients on hand. Of course I deviated from the recipe as written, but I'm sure it would be great in a variety of ways. I happened to have a box of spice cake mix on hand. I also threw in some coconut with the sugar/nut mixture (which was almonds in my case). I also took another's suggestion about putting instant coffee in the water - nice addition. I made it in a bundt pan. My only recommendation would be to add extra butter or oil to the bottom of the bundt pan so the topping caramelizes. Because I didn't do that, some of my topping stayed in the pan when the cake came out. My visiting family raved - than you!

Really delicious coffee cake.  Great balance of spice flavors to sweet cake.  Very moist and light.  I used a Bundt pan and divided the batter roughly into thirds with the two topping layers.  I also added a little nutmeg and cloves to the cinnamon mixture.  Result was fabulous.  Took to a party and it was demolished.

Wonderful!!  To make it even better use pecans instead of walnuts and you get a praline like top!  Be carefule not to use too big a pan or there wont be enough batter to spread two layers.  I always double the recipe and use a smaller pan or a bundt pan for that layered look.

YUM YUM YUM! My husband is a huge coffeecake fan and he said this is the best he has ever eaten! I only ended up needing about half of the brown sugar/ cinnamon mixture......I think it would have been way to sweet if I had used it all. Also mine was a little underdone in the middle. I used a Bunt pan and cooked it for about 5 minutes longer then the recipe called for. I let it get brown and all cracked on the top......but it was still a little doughy in the middle. I will definitely be making this again and will cook it a little longer.

This is so yummy and so easy!!! I made a couple changes due to what I had on hand; I only used 3 eggs and I used pecans instead of walnuts. I used a cake mix with pudding in the mix and thought it was fine. I made it in a 9x13 but think it would be prettier in a bunt.

It was great! I did only use one pkg of vanilla pudding since the cake mix I used already had pudding in the mix.  I doubled the cinnamon and did not put in walnuts (oops didn't have any) but would be good with them.  I did add 2 large apples peeled cored and sliced on top of the first layer of cinnamon mixture.  I also had to had about a half cup of water.  Without the water the batter was doughy and did not spread in the pan. I am going to try coffe the next time I make this as others have.  I will be making this again and again!

AMAZING!!!  I am obsessed with cinnamon and this is soooo good.  It is moist and light.  I did try a different crumb the second time I made it.  1 C Flour 1/2 C Brown Sugar 1 T Cinnamon    Mix those 3 then cut in 6 tablespoons of butter.  SOoo yummy!  Plus I also drizzled icing over the top as well.

Great recipe.  I did follow some other suggestions and it turned out great.  I used 1/2 c. coffee & 1/2 c. water.  I also used 1/2 applesauce for the oil, tried to make it a little healthier.  I also took some of the sugar mix and lined the bundt pan.  Delish.  Thanks for the recipe on a cold and rainy sunday morning.

This  coffee cake is awesome! I made it because i wanted something sweet to eat and I took some into work with me and everyone absolutely loved it. However, I am giving it 4 stars because the batter is very thick and hard to work with. But it would definately get 5 stars for taste!

I made this coffee cake for my cinnamon-craving husband last night.  It was a huge hit.  I asked him if I should add chopped apples (NO) or raisins (NO) next time and he said it was perfect the way it is.  It's a keeper!  The only thing I added was a little cinnamon/confectioners sugar frosting drizzle over the top after the cake cooled.  Very good recipe!

I made this today and it was my first time making coffee cake.  It was simple and tasted really good.  I didn't have the size pans stated here but I had an angel food cake pan.  Kinda like a bundt pan but the sides are straight and the center comes out.  I lined some foil to go under the center piece so none of the mix would ooze out.  Not that it would because it was thick.  After I cooked it, I just pulled the center piece out and cut the slices I wanted.  Easy.  I did like some others and used 2 boxes of the vanilla pudding mix and used coffee instead of water.  I just used about 1/4 cup of walnuts because I have braces, LOL.  I cooked it for the first 20mins at 350 and then ended up cooking it for 45mins at 325.  After that I let it sit in the pan for 10mins before pulling it out.  Yummy!  Thanks Janis Woods.

I have made this cake twice 100% according to the recipe.  I have gotten very good feedback from my family but I think it would be slightly better if you used less oil.  I would recommend 1/4 cup butter and a 1/4 cup oil instead of the 1 cup oil this recipes call for.  I will br trying it that way the next time and will report back. :)

I was served this coffee cake recently at a B&B and it was absolutely DELICIOUS.  Yum Yum!  Can't wait to make it myself!  Update 10-2010:  I have made this several times now.  I prefer to use a bundt pan and use 1 1/2 to 2 times the streusel filling, putting about 1/3 on the bottom of the bundt pan to carmelize during cooking, with the remainder in the middle.  Nothing but rave reviews from friends and family.  Fantastic recipe!

VERY GOOD!!!!!  used a bundt pan.  Had to cook at least 10 mins longer.  Family went crazy over this.  Followed the recipe exactly.
edit: now I use a 13 x 9 pan.  Nuts and brown combo stays on top better,less messy.

Loved this, as did my whole family.  I wish I had taken the advice of others and replaced some of the oil with apple sauce or apple butter.  It was greasy to the touch (but oh so delicious).  Am saving this recipe and will try again with apple butter/or sauce in place of at least some of the oil.  Delicious though....can't fault the recipe.  I knew what I was getting into....just too many fat calories to be worth it.  Thanks.

Family loved it.  My cake mix had pudding in it already so instead of two boxes of pudding I used just 1 of the butterscotch pudding.  Made it in a bundt pan.   This recipe is going into my "favorites" cookbook!

this was a hit! noone knew it was a cake mix and you couldnt really taste the butterscotch pudding (which i was afraid would be overpowering).  i put some coffee crystals in with the water, but will use more next time.  very moist and wonderful. used all of the topping and glad i did.

This make a very moist cake, great with a cup of coffee!  I did alter it a bit and used pumpkin spice pudding instead of butterscotch since that is what I had in the cupboard and I omitted the nuts, due to an allergy.  It was great and everyone loved it.

Made this last night in a bundt pan using half apple sauce/half oil and pumpkin flavor pudding (both boxes).  It was delicious, but even more so the next day.  I would make it a day ahead before bringing it somewhere or for company.  When making it in a bundt pan cut back on the brown sugar and walnuts to maybe 3/4 cup each.   I had some left over.

MMM MMM Good.. I did make a couple changes only because I didn't have the called for ingredients. I didn't have butterscotch pudding so I used 5.4 ounces of vanilla pudding and approx. 1 ounce of chocolate pudding. I also only had 1 1/2 cups vegetable oil so I added a 1/2 cup of butter in place of the 1/2 vegetable oil I needed. This was very moist and so good.. I will for sure make this again..

When I tasted it the day it was baked, it was awful...tasted like overspiced cake mix.  The flavor improves dramatically after 2 days.  I also skipped the brown sugar because I was worried about it tasting too sweet.  I turned this into a stacked cake with whipped cream as the filling which toned down the cloying aftertaste.  Tastes like spice cake.

This was excellent!  I made this for a potluck breakfast and everyone loved it. Since I have a nut-free home I omitted the nuts but it turned out fine. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks for posting this

This is a fast easy coffee cake.  I used 2 vanilla per suggestions.  I also used 3/4 cup apple sauce and 1/4 oil instead of 1 cup of oil per suggestions.  I did this because I was worried about 4 eggs and 1 cup of oil being too much grease and making the batter slick. This was my first time using apple sauce as a replacement and it works great.  After the cake cooled I drizzled a basic frosting on the top.

A wonderful Christmas morning treat!  I live in Korea and this was well worth the cake mix and pudding mix I had a friend bring from the states.  I didn't include the butterscotch pudding, because I was trying to mimic a family traditional cake.  I liked the addition of the brown sugar--that was new for me!  Overall--fantastic!

I've never made coffee cake before, but was under the impression that it would be dry, therefore you should eat it while drinking coffee. This cake was soooo moist and delicious. I got many compliments on it! One of the best cakes I've ever made. I did make 2 changes though: I left out the nuts (just personal preference) and used 2/3 oil + 1/3 applesauce. Absolutely scrumpcious!

Great recipe. I took it to a baby shower at work and got lots of compliments, and a request to make it again. Only changes made; I used a little less oil and about half of the cinnamon mixture, also used pecans as I didn't have any walnuts.

I made this using the original recipe but used 2 boxes of vanilla pudding because the store didn't have the right size in the butterscotch & i didn't feel like trying to do conversions. It was great & everyone loved it. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good recipe but it is alittle more like regular cake...I think I will do four layers next time as suggested by others. Other than that, the inl-laws loved it for brunch. Also, I may stick with vanilla pudding rather than the butterscotch.

Everyone that has tasted this LOVES IT. I used the cheesecake pudding instead of the butterscotch. Only because I am not crazy about butterscotch flavor. This is so easy and makes you smile after every bite it is so good. Thank You Janis!

This is yummy. I have tried 2 vanilla puddings and today I tried one butterscotch and one vanilla. I did it without nuts since it is going to a school function.  People love this and ask for the recipe.  And it is super easy and quick to assemble.  Try this - you will not be disappointed.

I made this cake to take to work.  It was really easy to make, came out extremely moist and everyone liked it.  I didn't add nuts since I don't eat them.  There wasn't much "flavor" to the cake.  I used 3/4 cup applesauce instead of oil, 3/4 cup brown sugar, I also only used 1 package of sugar free vanilla pudding since the cake mix already had pudding in it.  Next time I'm going to try adding chocolate chips, using a chocolate cake mix and use a bundt pan.

My 14 year old daughter makes this for special occasions and everyone LOVES it!  It is gone in 2 days at the most which is rare for our house.  Comes out moist and perfect every time.

I've been using the site for years, but this is my first recipe review. This cake was excellent!! So simple to make. I followed the ingredients as written. Since I used a Bundt pan, I baked at 350 for 20 minutes, then at 325 for 50 minutes. Turned out perfect! I brought it to work and had several coworkers ask for the recipe. One even said that it was the best cake she had ever tasted. Will make again.

This was AMAZING!!! I took it to a ladies' get-together and it was gone! It was very moist and yummy....especially when it was still warm from the oven. I did use a box of vanilla pudding instead of butterscotch. I was sparing with the sugar/nut mixture in the middle, so that I would have plenty to put on the top. (I hate when any batter can still be seen.)   THis was one of the yummiest coffee cakes that I have ever tasted, let alone made! All the ladies requested the recipe.

Fantastic!  I only had sugar free instant pudding on hand so I used that.  Used 3/4 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup of oil and 3/4 cup of packed brown sugar.  My husband didn't know it was "healthy" and loves it.  I made it for my moms group meeting and had to hand out the recipe!

A great recipe and very much like a good coffee cake for those few who thought it was too dense and sweet, stick to a straight box cake.

This recipe is exceptional with a few minor changes. No butterscotch pudding and instead two packages of instant vanilla. Add more well chopped walnuts. Also, three eggs worked better for me. Thank you, this coffee cake went so fast the first time I didn't even get a piece!!!

OH.MY.WORD.  This is delicious!!!  Do not pay attention to any negative reviews.  I served this to about 12 people that were staying at my house and they all raved about it.  If you're trying to make it more healthy, you may want to sub out applesauce, but I wouldn't recommend that because as written this is perfect.  I couldn't find butterscotch pudding so I switched it out for cheesecake, and I didn't add nuts, but other than that I followed this exactly and it is definitely a keeper.  The batter is thick, so just be patient with it when layering with the brown sugar mix.  I promise you will not regret this one!  So easy and tasty.

I never thought you could have the coffee cake flavor without the coffee, but as I eat this cake, I'm at least reminded of a coffee cake and I guess that's the idea.  I took another reviewer's suggestions and instead of oil used a half cup of unsweetened apple sauce and a half cup of apple butter. The cake came out SO moist, that I'm sure it could've stayed in the oven a few minutes longer than 30 minutes. Also, before I sprinkled the crumble layers I scattered a handful of milk chocolate chips and I think that it added a nice little surprise to each slice of cake. Also, I only had a 1oz pack of butterscotch pudding so I used 3 1.5oz packs of vanilla pudding and the 1oz of butterscotch. I think it's delicious and I'm sure my coworkers will think so too!  Next time I might throw in a few tsps or tbsps of coffee grounds and let them steep in some hot water and use that instead of the cup of water, just to give it that extra coffee kick!

I too used all vanilla pudding instead of butterscotch.  This is by far the best coffee cake I have found.  I use Betty crocker cake mixes ALWAYS and never had a problem.  I decorate cakes all the time and Betty Crocker cakes are by far the best.  Wonderful recipe.  Thanks!

quick and easy - it was good, but I was expecting something greater I suppose because of all the high reviews. My Dad however, LOVED this recipe and has asked for it several times since I made it for Easter.

My husband and daughter loved this recipe. It was very moist, but I might try changing the topping next time. I didn't care for the topping in this recipe but the cake part came out great.  It also took a bit longer than stated to cook, by about 15 minutes.

I thought that this cake was wonerful.  It tasted very delicious. My whole family loved it and insisted that i make it again sometime. To make it even more moist i poured about 3/4 cup milk onto it when it was done baking and put it back into the oven for five more minutes.  This made it even more moist and delicious.

Wow!  My husband asked me to make a coffee cake for his birthday and since I'd never made one, this recipe sounded doable.  It was fantastic.  The local supermarket didn't have butterscotch pudding, but they did have a pumpkin spice kind and I used that instead.  I also used 3/4 applesauce and 1/4 oil.  Hubby loved it and so did my son.  We will definitely make this again!

So delicious! I should say the topping is not the usual crumb-like cofee cake topping I was hoping for. I need to find a good crumb topping recipe. The cake itself is fabulous. I used 2 boxes of Vanilla pudding. Thank you for this recipe!

Best coffee cake I've ever had.  Will definitely make again sometime.  It came out pretty moist in the middle (like a little too moist) cooking the last leg at 35 minutes: you might want to get closer to the 40 mark.

I didn't have any butterscotch pudding, so I used two packs of vanilla.  Also, I used milk instead of water.  Excellent recipe Janis!

Absolutely delightful!  I've made it twice now and I've had a few people tell me it's their favorite dessert I've ever made!!!  I bake a lot, so that is a huge complement!  I'm memorizing this one!

Delicious!  I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and made 2 days before... only half made it to the brunch!  It was wonderful.  I did make some substitutions- I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup of apple butter in place of the oil, I used half splenda brown sugar and half regular and I used 2 boxes of french vanilla pudding because my boyfriend doesn't like butterscotch. Everyone raved about it.

I recommend this recipe because it is simple to make, relatively fool-proof, and has a nice, delicate flavor.  It is moist, as one would expect for a coffee cake.

Wow!  This is so good!  I keep making it for other people, but I always save a few pieces for myself.  I like to cut it into serving size pieces then individually wrap them in plastic wrap for a "grab and go" treat for the recipient!  Always well received.

very upset about this cake. followed the directions perfectly. baked it for 40 minutes. the toothpick test came out clean but there is apparently a ring of uncooked cake in the center of my bunt cake. so the cake has fallen and i now had to slide it onto a cookie sheet and put it back in the oven and hope it cooks because im taking it to a dinner in an hour

Excellent! I just took this out of the oven 10 minutes ago and believe or not, it's gone already.  It didn't even have a chance to cool. After test-tasting for me, everyone (8 people) rushed in to grab a piece.  Great recipe that I'll be making over and over again....by the way...I didn't change a thing in the recipe.

This was really easy to fix. My 9 yr old son helped me. I did notice that when cooking it on 165 for 35 min it didn't get done in the middle all the way so I turned it back up to 350 for about 10mins and PERFECT... I will be cooking this again.

I made this for my office and everyone raved.  There were no leftovers.  I made it exactly as the recipe says, except I used french vanilla instead of regular pudding because that was all I could find.  I also did what one other reviewer did and made the cinnamon/sugar mix with pecans in only half, so those that don't like/can't eat nuts could still enjoy the cake.  It was terrific and I can't wait to make it again.

Used 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce to reduce the fat content.  Baked for 20 minutes at 350 as written, but only 30 minutes at 325- it was plenty and would have been dry had i cooked it longer.  Other reviewers said this is better by the third day so i made it early, i need it in three days (but had to try it last night, it was to die for!)  Very light, fluffy and flavorful.  Thanks.

I decided to make it more difficult than it needed to be by trying cupcakes out of this. After a while of teaspoons of cake then crumble and so on, finally got them in the oven starting at 350 for 10 mins, then I moved down to 325 for 15 more mins. The toothpick came out clean but they did sink in the middles. I will update this tomorrow when I hear what my husbands unit thinks of them!

I tried one before they got to the 119th... very bland. You really need to use a flavored cake mix. I also only used 1 box of pudding and with how much oil you use it's plenty moist. (The more oil the more moist, most of the time you can substitute oil for butter for a melt in mouth cake) I will try this again with either spice cake or cinnamon cake, but it's not exactly amazing.

OK, I definitely goofed making this cake but the portion that was cooked enough was very good and I am sure will be much better the next time I try it, which will be very soon.  Opened the oven to check on other things baking and the cake collapsed, you'd think I'd know better.  I will come back again to update this disaster after my second try.

Very, very good! I added a few chocolate chips to the brown sugar & nuts, which made it quite tasty. Something that didn't occur to me, so I thought I would throw it there- if you do a bundt, the brown sugar &  nut mixture is on the bottom. It works though, I made a little 10x sugar glaze and having a "crust" was cool.

I LOVE this cake!  I was tasked to make breakfast one day at a family weekend get together.  We were doing omelet stations, and I needed an easy coffee cake recipe to make ahead of time.  This one filled the bill perfectly.  I got rave reviews, and every crumb was gone.

This is a decent coffee cake but I didn't think it worked well in 9x13. The batter is super thick and doesn't spread well. I ended up swirling the cinnamon layer into the cake. It worked well. I don't think I will make again.

This is wonderful!  I made it for sunrise service Easter and it was such a hit.  I did make a little more of the sugar,cinnamon mixture.  I had a small piece leftover and it remained moist for a week.  This is a keeper!

I dont know what happened but when i mixed all the stuff up the batter was not batter it was actually like a dough, even after i added more water, vegetable oil and anohter egg.... and i could not spread it in a big cake pan so i put in a 9x9. I had to cook it so much longer because it kept coming out doughy. I cooked it probably a total of 1 hour and 30  mins. It smelled great and it tasted okay but it was very dense like a sourdough bread would be. I will try it again because it looks good and seems so easy..... maybe i messed it up?

A little heavy for me. I took it to a church function and everyone liked it! I did just use two packages of vanilla pudding instead of adding the butterscotch. I'm not a fan of butterscotch. It was good and I'll probably bake it again-it was really easy!

Really great recipe! My husband, who isn't big on sweets, loved this cake. I did have to change a few things because of what I had on hand: used white cake mix, french vanilla pudding mix in place of butterscotch, and for oil used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup of cinnamon applesauce, and omitted the walnuts, and was still amazing! Thank you so much for such a wonderful recipe!

This recipe turned out beautifully!  The only difference I made - I used banana pudding instead of butterscotch b/c I that's all I had.  I took it to work & it was gone in minutes.  Very easy & very tasty!

This cake was wonderful.  I used a box of french vanilla pudding and a box of cheesecake pudding.  I also used 1 1/2 times of the strusel recipe.  It was very moist and everyone loved it.

My son's Home Ec. class made this and the kids loved it so he brought the recipe home and I made it for my family. So easy, moist and just wonderful. I made it in a bundt pan and would put the sugar mix in first rather than on top next time.  Loved it!

This was a very good dessert! I love the middle layer! I used a cake mix with pudding in it and it turned out fine! I was hesitant to use the butterscotch pudding b/c I am not big on butterscotch, but it didn't have the flavor of it. My husband and I loved this. Will make again!

This cake was excellent!
I made this with my 3-year-old and took it to my in-laws who absolutely loved it!

It was gone before I knew it!

Will definitely make it again and again!

I baked this and took it to work and in the words of one of my coworkers.. "this coffee cake is freakin' awesome!"  I heard several people walking down the hallway asking who made it.  I will definitely make it for Thanksgiving morning.

Best coffee cake EVER.  Tried it with banana pudding too and was also fabulous.  When making in bundt, put most of the "topping" in the middle and very less at the bottom of the bundt (which ends up as the top).

I'm only giving this recipe three stars.  It was extremely easy and moist, however, It was just a little too sweet. I was also put off by the color.  Mine came out orange....I know that really doesn't change the flavor at all but was very unappealing.  I also omitted the nuts..my mom is allergic.  I will try this again maybe with cheesecake pudding mix.

This was so easy to make and tasted great!  I used 2 boxes of vanilla pudding.  It's not heavy like a normal coffee cake.  I'm throwing away all my other coffee cake recipes and this is my new favorite.  Thank you so much.

This was awesome.  I took it a function and everyone loved it.  I brought home the leftovers and my husband inhaled it for breakfast!  I couldn't find butterscotch pudding so I just used 2 vanillas and I used half the oil as other people had said and it turned out great!  Thanks :)

Great coffee cake! I followed the recipe exactly as written except I used 1/2 cup of oil instead of 1 cup. I loved the way it looked sliced on my serving dish. The butterscotch gave it a perfect Fall color. I will be making this FOREVER!

This was edible, but not great.  It was greasy and I used less oil as suggested by others.  The edges rose and were cakey but the middle was flat.

I am usually horrible about posting comments, but I had to on this one!  This coffee cake was DELICIOUS!!  I made it for our Easter brunch and had tons of great comments!  I did take some of the other poster's suggestions and used 1/2 C applesause and 1/2 C oil instead of 1 C oil.  Very moist, it turned out perfect!

DELISH!  I wanted a coffee cake that had a real "homecooked" taste and this recipe really hit home.  Everyone loved it...it was wonderful after dinner with coffee...and we can't wait to eat it tomorrow morning  with breakfast.  Thank you for sharing the recipe :)

This was SO easy to make and it was delicious!  I made this for a Mom's group and every piece was gobbled up.  My husband was upset because the house smelled wonderful but the cake was not for him.  I think I will make it up to him this weekend by making him one!

Made as written (with the exception of subbing a box of sugar free vanilla pudding and pecans for walnuts since that was all I had on hand) and it was delicious!  Everyone enjoyed it.  Very dense and moist.  Easy to make.  I might experiment a bit with the topping...the cinnamon/sugar/nuts were good in the middle of the cake, but didn't hold together as well on top.  Maybe adding a bit of butter and flour would bit good...  Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe exactly (even though cake mix had pudding in it), except it needed to be cooked 20 minutes longer in a bundt pan. I also sprinkled powdered sugar on for visual appeal.  I agree with others that it does taste like an ordinary cake mix cake.  HOWEVER, it's super moist and the cinnamon mixture is what makes the cake stand out with an addictive taste.

This was great! I made it for some last minute guests and they absolutely loved it. At first I put only 1/2 the oil as suggested, but added more as I was mixing because the batter was too stiff. Either way it was GREAT!!! I will definetly use this again...and again...and again!

I only made one minor modification and that was to add about 1 cup of chocolate chips to the batter after it was mixed.  A co-worker made this without the choc chips.  I loved both versions.

I made this cake for my friend who's in-laws were visiting from the Dominican Republic. Pretty good. I made it in a bundt pan. A piece of the cake stuck to the pan when I was removing it so I dusted the entire cake with powered sugar to cover the "bad spot". It ended up looking and tasting great. Thanks Janis.

This sounded good and I so wanted to like it.  I made this in a bundt pan and I followed the suggestions by others to reduce the oil to 3/4 cup, but it still was too oily, it never finished baking in the middle and I left it in for thirty five minutes longer than listed. Wont make again.

My husband and I thought this recipe was okay, but not fabulous.  I used only 3/4 cup oil, like someone else had suggested, so maybe that made it a bit less tasty? It was very easy to make though.

This was delicious...just a plain old coffee cake...just what I was looking for.  I did as others mentioned, and used equal amounts of both white and brown sugar for the cake and the topping.

Delicious! I only had vanilla pudding on hand so wasn't able to use the butterscotch pudding but it still tasted so good! I also added 8oz. of sour cream and accidentally left out the oil but it was still so moist. Everyone loved it except for my mom who said it was a little too sweet. If you like sweet, try this coffee cake!

This recipe was just okay.  Everyone in my house ate a piece and enjoyed it okay at the time but none of us went back for seconds and the cake just ended up sitting there.  Not bad at all just nothing to rave about.

This is an awesome cake!  I make it almost weekly for everyone at work.  No one can seem to get enough of it, even been called incredible.  Everyone always comments on how moist it is!  It is simple, inexpensive, and I make a point to always have the ingredients on hand.  Highly recommended!  Thank you for sharing an awesome recipe!

Very moist and sweet.  It was well received.  I used cinnamon chips instead of walnuts which may have added to the sweetness.

It was very moist. It had alittle more nuts and cinnimmon than I liked. I was looking for another similar recipe and found this one thinking it was it. It wasn't but it was good. I agree that maybe I would try the butterscotch chips.

I took this to work and everyone loved it!  It was so moist.  This is now my favorite cake.
