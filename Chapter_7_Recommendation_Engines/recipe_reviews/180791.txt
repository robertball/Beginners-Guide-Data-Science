My husband and I made this recipe tonight and it was GREAT!  I used a little less turkey than the recipe called for since it's just the two of us but used the full recipe.  The turkey stayed very moist and stayed together on the grill.  They do smell AMAZING!  Most turkey burger recipes I've tried have not been very flavorful.  These burgers are full of flavor and just enough spice, but not too much, even with the jalepenos.  We will definitely make these again!

I just got done eating this! Wow, very, very good! I understand some members get upset that people make modifications but I did and thought they were AWESOME! I only had 1 lb of turkey so I cut back on everything-I used about 1/2 of all the ingredients, had to substitute cayenne pepper for the chili pepper and I added more bread crumbs than the recipe called for. I refrigerated the meat for about 20-30 min's while I got everything else ready and it was real easy to form the patties, which stayed 'together' perfectly. I pan fried these patties instead of grilling and they came out great, they were really moist too. My hubby loved them too....we decided this is the 'way to go' as far as burgers.  Better than beef, especially with sauted onions, wheat buns and all the sides!!!  Thank you for the recipe!

Great turkey burgers!  I left out the jalepeno peppers and used 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro instead.  These were very moist, so I left out the egg and also used low sodium soy sauce - very healthy and a nice change from regular beef burgers. Perfect on toasted whole grain rolls with lettuce, tomato, and thin sliced red onion.

These had great flavor and weren't spicy at all. I only used one pound of meat so I used a little less worcestershire and soy sauce, but I kept all the spices the same. Very tasty, thank you. :)

Definitely lots of flavor in these.  A great way to enjoy a burger AND enjoy the benefits of low-fat turkey.  A slice of cheese melted on top and barbecue sauce made them extra good.

I left out the jalapenos and cut the chili powder in 1/2 because my husband is spice-averse. I made them on my Cuisinart Griddler in 4 minutes. This recipe is great because I had everything I needed on hand already. This is the tastiest turkey burger I have ever had. I ate mine with some Miracle Whip Light, lettuce and tomato. Delicious!

Amazing burgers! My husband was leary, but willing... ate two and told me I can make these anytime.  I will decrease the cumin a little bit next time, but the flavor was great.  They were juicy and held together fine.  I did place them back in the fridge while the grill heated up and used Jennie-O turkey. I highly recommend.  Served them with provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayo and avocado.  Fabulous!  Thanks for a great and different recipe!!!

I just changed my review after attempting them again, but I made changes. These were pretty good the 1st time, but the cumin is too much! You couldn't even taste the other ingredients. Here are the adjustments I made: finely diced bell pepper instead of jalapeno (adds moisture), 1/2 tsp. onion powder, 3/4 tsp. cumin, no soy sauce, 1 tbsp. of dijion mustard instead of the powder and 1/2-3/4 cup of panko bread crumbs. Browned them in a saute pan for 4 mins each side and then baked in the oven at 350 for 5 mins. YUMMY!!

This is a good concept but waaay too much spices.  I want to be able to taste the flavor of the turkey in the burger.  I could only taste the spices.  Next time I make these I will reduce the 'dry' spices by half and also halve the soy and Worcestershire sauces.

Awesome burgers.  Very moist and it packed a punch.  I did leave in some jalepeno seeds which did make it spicy.  My 2 year couldn't eat it, but my husband and I loved them. Will definetely make them again.

Very good burger.  The chili powder was a little over powering.  I think next time I'll leave it out because I prefer the taste of the cumin.  All in all, good recipe.

Cumin Turkey Burger Haiku: "Oh my, this was good. Dressed up with treats, I inhaled. I will make again!" Normally I think ground turkey smells like a poot when it's cooking, but these burgers DID smell nice w/ all the spice and seasoning additions. I did mine on ye olde George Foreman, then patty-melted it in a Fold-it (love those things!) w/ sauteed onions and cheese, then dressed it up a la any other burger, but truth be told, the burger was tasty enough that it didn't necessarily need to be "hidden" w/ toppings the way that I usually find bland turkey burgers to be. Dropped it a star b/c the patties were a little wet and soggy to shape, and I think they needed just a bit more kick - cayenne or more jalapenos perhaps.

They are so good.  I have made them many times,  My husband asks for them.  They are so juicy.  First time I made them I did not have the peppers.  They are just as good with or with out.
I continue to make these burgers.  I have changed it some to save on Weight Watcher points.  I do not use the egg or bread crumbs.  They taste just as good with out them.  They are 3 points after cooking for WW.

Great idea for a Turkey Burger. Unfortunately I thought the soy sauce was way too strong, and I even used a bit less then the recipe and used the low sodium.  Maybe using Tamari would be better than regular soy sauce.  I didn't add the egg or bread crumbs. It didn't need it, it held together fine after refrigerating for a while and being careful when turning.  Topped the burger with cheddar, raw onion, and a sauce made with chili sauce (the stuff found by the ketchup at the store) and mayo mixed together.  I was happy with those toppings.  Cooked these in a skillet instead of a grill, worked fine, just make sure to get a nice caramelized crust.  I want to try this again with less soy and maybe a tad more of the spices.

Unfortunately, we didn't enjoy these.  We found the amount of soy and Worcestershire to be too overpowering.

This is the ONLY turkey burger I actually crave! Even my husband, who doesn't even like turkey burgers, asks for these. All the flavors harmonize for a seriously satisfying gourmet experience. This is definitely not your average turkey burger! We love all things spicy, so we usually top them with an easy chipotle-lime mayo for a little extra "pow." Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, Ash!

EXTREMELY DELICIOUS!  My husband makes these and the kids ask for them at least once a week.  We adjust the jalapenos...sometimes we leave them out and sometimes we include only one.  We also use less soy sauce and less worcestershire, because 1/4 cup of each makes the mixture too thin.  We serve on whole wheat slider buns with pepper jack cheese!

Made this without the jalapeno peppers as none to hand .    Following low carb diet so omitted the bun and served with home made coleslaw (lighter than light mayo!).   A real tasty treat!

Save the time and add a packet of taco seasoning instead. I wasn't too fond of this recipe however my husband seemed to like it.

I thought these were delicious! I love spicy food so they were great to me but they were a bit spicy for my hubby. The only thing I thought might be room for improvment is that the cumin was a bit over powering.. so next time I'll go with half the amount of cumin an add a little more garlic. That should do the trick! I also don't currently have a girll so I cooked them in the oven 420 degrees for about 6 min/side and they turned out great! I served them on a slice o texas toast with a little mozz cheese to cool it down a notch..  will definately make again!

this recipe was good my husband really liked them. i didnt have the jalapenos but did add everything else. i would modify when making next time. i would reduce the cumin by half and probably omit the soy sauce. its a starting place for me to create something a bit of desirable to my taste though.

My husband and dad loved these..after eating half though the flavor was a bit much for me.We put mozzarella on them although hubby didn't but said that adding some cheese would make it even better.I did end up adding more breadcrumbs and put it in the fridge for a while before molding.Over all a nice change !!

I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the jalapenos.  The burgers were moist and flavorful but I wouldn't call them "spicy."  My husband loved them!

Each person who tried a bite immediately said, "oh wow "after the first bite. These were easy and amazing. As silly as this sounds,  the best way we've found to describe these is that they taste like Indian food. A very odd and general description, I know, but trust me. Try it and you'll see!

This recipe was too salty, although the kids liked it.  (I left out the jalapenos.) The next time I make it I will reduce the soy sauce and worcestershire sauce.  Also, will need to increase the bread crumbs.  Otherwise the patties were moist and yummy.

These are some of the tastiest burgers I have ever had. They are different than your run of the mill beef burgers, so you really cannot compare the two. The first time I made these I had a cut on one of my fingers and hesitantly, because I love spicy food, left out the jalapenos; I also used ground chicken because it was on sale that week. They were so good that I made them this way several times, eventually I made them with turkey as well as jalapenos and to my amazement I did not care for them as much. Not to say they were bad, it just reinforced one of my favorite sayings “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Other than that, adding a bit more breadcrumbs and using closer to 2 pounds of meat (because I never see half pounds of meat for sale) I make this recipe as it is written. I have developed a few “tricks” for dealing with how hard to handle these patties are: I make them ahead of time and allow them to congeal in the refrigerator for a couple of hours, when I am placing them on the grill I use a claw-like motion to apply even pressure to each side and once they are on the grill I try to repair any damage the best I can. Also, once they are on the grill do not mess with them for awhile, this allows them to firm up nicely and actually be pretty easy to flip. I serve these on onion rolls with avocado, tomato, lettuce and shredded cheddar.

Tasty, but hard to tell when they're done since the meat is brown from the soy and worcestershire sauce. I cooked them extra and they were still juicy!

Tastes good except it's too salty. I did not even add salt that was called for in the recipe. Will definitely cut down on the soy sauce the next time I make it.

Wow, I usually do not like burgers, I wasn't expecting so much flavor, my husband gives it a four I give it a five. I love the spices with the turkey!  I didn't make it with bread crumbs it still tasted great and stayed together!

Yummy! I used seranno peppers, vidalia onion, and even added some chopped baby bella muchrooms to the mix...totally omitted the egg....and reduced the soy and worcestershire by half....so 2 tblspns of each of the liquids was waaaay more than plenty....I couldnt imagine 1/2c. of liquid ingredients in this mix......it would have been impossible to make burgers out of unless adding a ton more bread crumbs.  I thought these were very tasty and healthy. Thanks!

Mine ended up falling apart.  Maybe I should have refridgerated them prior to cooking like some reviewers suggested.  I wasn't a huge fan of the sloppy joe type turkey burger and the taste was just 'ok' for me.  Maybe I'd try this recipe again on top of nachos or a quesadilla but not in a burger.  Thanks for the recipe, I had fun trying it!

I changed the recipe a bit, omitting jalapenos because I don't like them and putting in dried ginger because I mistook it for mustard (oops!), and fried it on the stove. I quite liked the results.

Was not happy with the taste of the cumin, too much for my liking.  I will make it again and reduce the cumin by half and see how that goes.

Excellent!!  We loved these burgers.  We often make turkey over beef burgers and I had jalapenos in the fridge that I was looking to use, so found these!  I didn't change anything, just used panko for my bread crumbs as I don't buy or use normal bread crumbs!  I also used Smoked Spanish Paprika for the paprika as well as Chipotle Chili Powder for the chili powder - SO GOOD!  A repeat for sure!

This was really good. I don't think I'll use the jalapeno next time. I'd rather offer them as a topping for those who like them. Neither my kids (nor I, quite honestly) loved the jalapeno, but other than that they were great. I will try adding a little red bell pepper next time.

The only thing I didn't like was that they didn't hold their shape on the George Foreman grill so the big fat burgers turned into pancakes.  But once my husband and I got pass the look, the taste was great!  Even better the next day.

Fantastic texutre and consistency. We found the cummin a little too strong, so next time I'll cut in half. I am not sure about the soya.  I think next time I'll omit it, as it was a little too salty and I'm not sure it added much.  I think a chipote mayo dressing would be fabulous as a topping and will try that next time.  One of the better turkey burgers I've tried and will certainly try again with aformentioed tweaks.

Followed recipe for 3 burgers. Used canned mild green chiles instead of jalapeno as we have a hard time with 'really spicy'. Did the burgers in a skillet on the oven (no gas for BBQ). Put them in a new bun (almost flat like flatbread) Very tasty - would definitely do again.

Yum! I differently will make these again. I grilled them on medium to low heat. They took about 20 minutes to cook. I had the grill on high until I noticed that the outside burns easily. I will be making these again.

My family really enjoyed it! When making it, DO pay attention to the low sodium soy sauce! Otherwise it will be very salty. I only had a pound of turkey so I 2/3 the recipe. The burgers for me did not stay together well until cooked. Maybe I made a mistake. We will be adding this recipe into our rotation of recipes.

We added a couple tablespoons of minced onion to the peppers and garlic, and fried in a pan.  The cumin is strong, so if you don't care for cumin, you might want to scale back, but we loved it.

What a shocker! These were much better than we anticipated. Even the 9yo loved them. He is a HUGE burger fan and said these beat regular beef burgers-WOW! I didn't have any jalapenos so I had to use red pepper flakes but these were awesome. I oven-roasted some sweet peppers with a drizzle of EVOO and seasonings and we topped our burgers with pepper jack cheese, baby spinach, and the sweet roasted peppers. De-lish! We will definitely make these again.

This was a great burger but a little too salty (I think due to the Soy and the Worcester) next time I would add less. Very juicy and tender and tasty!

Delicious!!! Followed the recipe exactly minus the chili peppers. My husband LOVED these, as did I. Moist, flavorful, and a fun variation on regular turkey burgers!

OK, so turkey is dry and will never beat hamburger in my opinion.  However, if you are looking for a solid recipe to reduce fat and still have good flavor--this one is it.  After you add ketchup, mustard, BBQ, mayo, lettuce, tomato..all those toppings...well, you can almost imagine it's a red meat burger.  The best turkey burger recipe I've used, by far.

These burgers were absolutely delicious. I made the recipe just as it was (added a little cheddar cheese on the top) FANTASTIC. The flavor was wonderful, they were juicy. Even the 4 year old loved them. These will definitely go in the monthly rotation.

OMG these were so good! Only a few minor changes; I did add an extra egg and used instant oatmeal instead of bread crumbs as they didn't seem like they were binding together well. I used jarred jalepeno slices as that was what I had on hand, and I cooked them in a pan sprayed with Pam and a drizzle of olive oil.  My husband and I are going for a low fat/low carb diet so this fit perfectly!

Very tasty burgers! They smelled so delicious when cooking. I plan on leaving out the extra salt when I make them again because they were a little salty (and I like salty). They went great on a toasted french hamburger bun with a little romaine and side salad. Thank you for the great recipe!

Excellent burgers, very tasty and easy to make. Made them without the jalapeno because that would be too spicy for the kids but I'll be making a batch of that for me next summer.

Great flavor and yes they do smell awesome while cooking!  I use 2 lbs of turkey, only 1 Jalapeno and just a pinch of chipotle chili powder, I also used smoked paprika and cracker crumbs in place of the bread crumbs!  My 10 month old daughter just loved them; she ate about a quarter of one on her own.

This was tasty. I used habaneros instead of jalapenos, and although I didn't have any complaints, next time I may cut back on cumin, may have been a little overwhelming. Overall, this was very tasty, but if you over cook the turkey the ingredient may taste a bit sandy.

Ultra delish and easy to make. I altered it a bit because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I used red wine vinegar and teriyaki marinade instead of the soy and Worchestershire sauce. The rest of the herbs and bread crumbs were added as directed. I cut them down a bit because I didn't use a pound of meat. I didn't use the egg because it seemed very moist. I used about a third of a pound of ground turkey because that is what I had left over. I put them on my mini indoor grill ad they were ready in minutes. So yummy, smoky and moist with a kick of heat. I will definitely make these again.  Even my picky husband enjoyed these burgers. Thanks for the recipe.

Tasted great! I did have to double the bread crumbs though and I cut the cumin in half (only because my boyfriend is not a huge fan of cumin). Whole family loved them & my 12 year old said they were a bit too hot for him, but went for seconds! Definitely will make again.

Excellent - moist and bursting with flavor. I left out the jalapeno peppers and used a bit less of the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauces. I served it in pitas with techina, tomatoes, and pickles. The kids and hubby all really enjoyed this.

I doubled the turkey meat, used 6 cloves of garlic, omitted the jalapenos and salt and used a bit less of the spices. We used this as a topping for shredded lettuce and/or fritos then added shredded cheese and sour cream. I also sauteed onions, red and green peppers on the side for those that wanted the extra flavor. Everyone liked this one.  Thanks!

I made these tonight.  The were awesome.  They only thing I didn't put in was the jalapenos because I didn't have them.  My boyfriend and his kids are very finicky about burgers and these hit a home run.  They were very moist, very flavorful and so simple.  I think it is the best turkey burger recipe I have ever made.

A great base recipes that can be modified to your personal tastes. I left out the spicy peppers and opted for 1/2 a red pepper (wife is pregnant and not a fan of anything remotely spicy right now >_

These were the best burgers I have ever made.  I did use Smokey Spanish Paprika from Penzeys, I think that really enhanced the flavor.  Entire family loved these.

Loved these burgers...these are now my families favorite burgers and we have tried a lot of burgers from this site. I put my burgers in the freezer for 2 hours before I put them on the grill. Not a problem at all with them. *One very important thing, I did not add an egg with all of the wet and only added 1/2 of the liquids.*

loved the flavor, wasn't a big fan of the consistency.  I should have read more of the previous reviews - and maybe chilling the meat before grilling would have helped.  I think next time, and I WILL make this again, I will use less of the liquid ingredients, or maybe just make it a 2 lbs of meat recipe.  good stuff tho, even my picky mom liked them.. and worth another try!!

Surprisingly delicious. The only problem I had was the consistency. I chilled the mixture before and after making patties but need to lower them on the grill with wax paper. My grill has a basket weave cooking surface so the cooked up fine. A regular grill surface might be a problem.

Worked very well with ground chicken.  Chill formed burgers in fridge for 20 minutes and they will maintain their shape better.

When I read this recipe I had high hopes for it but was disappointed.  While the flavor of the burgers is good, my husband and I did not like the texture at all. It has a mushy, meatloaf type texture, rather than a meaty burger texture.

I was so excited about trying this recipe due to all the great reviews. I followed it to the tee except used green chilis instead of jalapenos as one reviewer had. These were awful! The flavors were a trainwreck in my mouth.

Absolutely the best use of ground turkey I've come across - sure beats chili and meatloaf. Make sure that the mix is cold before you grill the burgers. Delivered one to our friends who immediately asked for the recipe and made them several days later.

My husband and I didn't care for these very much.  The spices weren't a bad flavor, but too overpowering and a little out of place for a burger.  I also didn't care for the consitency.  The kids, however, liked them.  I omitted the jalepenos.

Fixed these using 1 pound ground chicken and 1 pound ground turkey and doubled the spices. My husband and I agreed that these were one of the best burgers I have fixed. We never eat our burgers on a bun, so the full flavor of these were wonderful. Will definately fix them over and over...a real keeper for us!

We loved these burgers, even my kids.  Sometimes ground turkey can taste dry, but these definitely do not. I cooked them indoors on my grill pan.  A foreman grill would work nice as well.  I topped them with muenster cheese and bbq sauce- delish!

This burger recipe is awesome.  Lots of good flavors that blended very well.  I would cut back on the salt next time. Other than that, they were a great hit at our house.  Great for company too.

I must have done something wrong but I followed the recipe to a "T", this was the worst tasting burger I have ever cooked.  I ended up, afetr salid and vegtables, taking my guests out for $50.00 worth of Pizza to make up for my blunder.  Never again!!!!

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but they fell apart on the grill. Even though they were not aesthetically pleasing they had a great earthy flavor. I will definitely try these again.

Very wet, when we grilled them the meat sagged through and made for a difficult cooking situation, but the flavor was fantastic
