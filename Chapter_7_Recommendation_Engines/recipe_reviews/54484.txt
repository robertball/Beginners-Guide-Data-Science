This was an excellent way to prepare beets. I roasted the beets in the oven as instructed but with potatos and carrots as well, then tossed them with a tiny bit of olvie oil and feta. I also added mushrooms and green onions to the beet greens when I sauteed them. My children loved it. A+++

I am AMAZED.  I tried this recipe because I felt stuck in a vegetable rut.  I wanted a veggie we don't eat often. I was wary because hubby doesn't like beets and I don't care for greens.  But I tried it and it is SENSATIONAL.  Hubby loved it, I loved it.  The greens were the surprise hit.  And felt great getting two veggies out of one.  I added butter and a bit more oil because it didn't seem like enough.  This was a mistake as my greens turned out a bit too oily/buttery.  Perfect as is.  THANKS!

I saw beets at the Farmers Market and bought them.  I found this recipe and tried it due to the positive reviews!  I can only say that the roasted beets are absolutely delicious.  I have made this recipe twice now.  Roasting time for beets definitely depends on the size.  For those who have never tried fresh beets...give them a try!  Well worth the roasting time!

Excellent recipe(s). I've made them several times, and we enjoy them immensely. Note that the time given to bake or roast the beets is an approximation--how long you cook them in actuality depends upon the size and age of the beets, as well as the vagaries of each particular oven. When I'm using baby beets, the time is slightly less than one hour; at this time of year (fall), I'm using older. larger beets, so I'll figure this in, and cook them for up to an hour and a half.
Oh, yeah--tobasco is tasty on the cooked greens, too.

simple and delicious.  I was generous with the garlic and onion and went light on the oil--got a great flavor.  also, used 1 bunch yellow beets and 1 bunch red for a variety.  like other people have said, the beets will take an hour to cook, maybe longer.

Saw recipe went out and got beets.  I have been doing both steamed for years. This was great. I don't know why they don't sell beet greens like, chard,spinach or other greens.  they are best, better than spinach..

This recipe gets an excellent review from me for several reasons. It has relitively few ingredients, which I love. It is simple, which I love. And, I got to eat beets, which I have never had fresh. I have only had pickled before and hated them. I topped my beets with butter salt and pepper.

Delicious idea using the whole beet.  Beets are moist and tasty, the greens are flavorful (similar to swiss chard) and add color. This is a great basic recipie.

Really delicious.  I was afraid of the greens because greens often taste bitter to me, but I couldn't get enough of them once they were on my plate.  My beets took longer than an hour to cook (I wanted them very well done).  The beets didn't taste as delicious as I've had in restaurants.

At this time of year when you are trying to keep the kitchen cool, first boil the beets until tender or until a knife inserted into the largest beat slips in easily.  When done run under cool water and you can peel skin off easily.  Refill the pot you used and steam the greens just till tender (5 to 8 minutes). Mix all and then dress with remaining ingredients. Easy, healthy and very good. I've been doing beets this way for years. You can also skip the ingredients shown, except for sliced onions and top with greek garlic and yogurt sauce. (strain yogurt for 30 minutes  with  2 tablespoons of grated cucumber, skin on,and 1 or 2 large garlic cloves, mix all and use on steamed beats.) If you make extra sauce you can use it on other veggies, grilled eggplant, grilled zucchini, etc.

This is a regular menu item in our house, we LOVE it. However, there is one small addition we make that we believe is KEY: toasted, chopped pecans. Sprinkled on top at the end. It rounds out the flavors and texture perfectly. Seriously folks, add the pecans. 

We serve it on olive oil and garlic couscous (NearEast brand). SOOO YUMMY. Quinoa works too, but isn't as flavorful and takes longer.   

Tips: Make sure to cover the beets or they take twice as long to cook; we use foil over our pyrex dish. Double this recipe for 2 adults and a bit of leftovers. Add more garlic/onions depending on your tastes.  

HIGHLY recommended even for the beet-resistant.

The flavors of the earth come together in this dish.  I roasted my beets with a little balsamic vinegar and rosemary and served with a dijon-yogurt sauce. Yum!

This was the first time I've ever cooked a green other than spinach. Wow! Really really liked it. The garlic bits ended up being extremely pretty pink accents in the midst of the dark green leaves which was also an unexpected visual treat.  I also cut up the beets and tossed them with a bit of feta cheese, white balsamic vinegar and the oil they were baked in (as the recipe suggests). WOW. That was amazing. Will definitely be doing this again.  

BTW, roasting with the skins on - thank god for that tip. A few months ago I tried to peel them first. Totally bad idea. This method is terrific.

Nice! I made just the greens portion of this recipe (used the beets in a different one). Sauteed then tossed with feta. Nice side dish. Can't wait to try the beets next time :)

I tried microwaving the beets after rubbing with olive oil, they came out just as good as roasting in the oven, but in a quarter of the time!

I feel like a Beet Star!!! Like so many others, I've never cooked a beet in my life, and had always heard one could eat the greens but had no clue what to do with them.  I am SO happy I tried this - I LOVE both my gorgeous, delicious roasted beets and my sauteet (heavy on the garlic ;) ;) ;) greens.  I love when a recipe can make my normal feeling of kitchen geekiness turn into a feeling of genuine pride :)

I roast my beets all the time, but if you wash them really well before you bake them, you can eat the skins.  They are so yummy.

Great recipe! I put onions and baby carrots in the dish with the beets, covered with aluminum foil baked for 55min. and it turned out PERFECT!! As for the greens, Might i suggest using Coconut Oil in place of olive oil!!  It is amazingly healthy and it alters the flavor in such a good way! i even still put minced garlic in with the greens sauteed in the coconut oil and it was a big hit!  My 6 year old couldnt get enough!!  =D  i will definitely be making this again!

We love fresh beets, so this worked great for us. I prefer roasting them over boiling them, and the skins were so easy to remove afterwards! After I removed the skins and cut up the beets, I added half of a large sweet onion, uncooked and chopped.  I also mixed two tablespoons of honey with two tablespoons of red wine vinegar, added a dash each of fresh ground salt and pepper, and mixed it into my beet and onion mixture.

Love that this is one of the few beets recipes I've seen which uses the tops too!  Roasted beets per the recipe - they came out perfectly.  Diced while warm and tossed with toasted almonds and marinated mozzarella cheese. Delicious!

For the greens, to make it a heartier side dish, sauteed mushrooms and sliced chicken sausage separately and set aside.  Then cooked garlic with diced bell peppers (no onion on hand). Added beet greens and cooked until wilted.  Mixed mushrooms/sausage back in until heated through, seasoned with salt/pepper and drizzled red wine vinegar to finish.

Lots of room for creativity with this recipe!

I was feeling adventurous wanting to try a new vegetable when I came upon this recipe. I followed the recipe excactly but did find that my beets took 1 and 1/2 hours to become tender. So figure in this extra time if your beets are on the large size as mine were. What was most surprising to me was the flavour or the greens. Delicious! I seasoned them with salt and pepper and doused with red wine vinegar. Beets are high in iron, fibre and vitamin C so you can fuel your body and delight your taste buds at the same time with this tasty side dish.

My fiancée is from Mississippi and he made basically this recipe from heart. We used two over large beets with greens grown in the garden. We sautéed the greens with no oil and one single slice of bacon. Honestly, I think one slice of bacon vs all the oil in this recipe might be better, plus it adds an amazing amount of flavor. It you want to be really authentic, use green chile vinegar. The vinegar really brings out the flavor just try it.

So simple, yet so delicious! I've just recently re-discovered beets , and this is definitely a recipe that makes me like them even more. I substituted the onions with shallots and I used high quality balsamic vinegar because it just beautifully emphasizes the delicate sweetness of beets. Thanks for sharing!

This is a fantastic recipe as is.  I do like to change it up a little by using 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and toss with either gorgonzola or goat cheese crumbles once everything is assembled.  A wonderful autumn dish!

I'm really only reviewing the sauteed beet greens because I did not roast the beets. I added a handful of almond slivers  and a little sugar to this recipe and I have to report that my 6-year old LOVED it. I used lemon juice instead of vinegar and left out the pepper. I was also generous with the onions and only used one garlic clove. We love beets and this was my first time ever making beet greens.

I was wary of beet greens but this recipe was delicious.  As some have mentioned, it was heavy on the oil.  I will definitely cut back on both the oil for roasting and the oil for the greens.  We omitted the onion and felt it was fine without.  I don't know what is standard size for a bunch of beets but the bunches at the store were sold with 4 baby beets - this would not have made 4 servings.  2 at best.  Just something to keep in mind if you're looking to feed a lot of people.

Easy and tasty! I forgot how much I liked beets. The greens were really good-I had never had them before. Make sure you cook them all the way though, because the ones that didn't get cooked as long were slightly bitter.

Thanks for the great idea!! My first year with homegrown beets in the garden and I almost threw out one of the best parts! Thankfully I discovered this recipe before the greens were discarded. I also love onions and felt a small diced onion was the perfect addition. I will make this again and again.

Tip: after the beets have roasted, wipe them with a dry paper towel and the skins come right off.

This recipe is wonderful. Very healthy, very good, and smells wonderful while it's roasting.

Turned out great. Only difference instead of olive oil and used Italian dressing on the roasted beets. Also added a few crush pepper flakes to the greens.

Tried this last night on my first-ever homegrown beets and my first time ever cooking beets. This was simple and perfect. I ended up sprinkling the beets with a little salt, fresh parsley & lemon and also added fresh ginger to the saute. Nice, fresh and easy! My husband loved both dishes, so thanks for helping me make him eat his vegetables!

awesome!! i actually already had the beets boiling and wanted to try to use the greens as i've never cooked them before. can't believe i've been throwing them out all these years!! i thought the red wine vinegar was weird but now i think that was the best part!!! ate the greens alone and they were phenomenal!!! reminded me of something between swiss chard and polish cooked cabbage (because of the onions and vinegar). rock solid!!! wish i could just buy the beet greens by themselves now!! :)

Thank you for a successful first try at cooking beets!  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it was a bit heavy on the oil.  I used cooking spray on the roasting dish and a little directly on the beets (no additional oil required). For the beet greens, less than 1 T of oil and the addition of a tip of water when needed made the greens delicious.  I will DEFINITELY make this again!

My favorite way to prepare beets. I usually leave out the onions, only because I'm constantly forgetting to get them. But this is always a hit at dinner parties. Looks more difficult than they really are!

I have never had beets that I enjoyed eating because they taste like dirt. With that being said I loved loved these as did DH who has the same problem with them that I do. Seems roasting gives them a very nice sweet flavor and they taste sooo good. I served mine sliced up and put on top of the greens which were also a very pleasent surpise. I used raspberry balsamic to top ours and they were wonderful!

Loved the savory combination of this recipe.  I would use a veg. peeler for the beets before roasting them.  I did not find them easy to de-skin once they were cooked.

Followed directions to a T. Did not like. Maybe I just don't like beets? Either way a no go in my house. Sauteed greens were ok.

I roasted it 1.25 hours but it was still a little too crunchy. Peeling it after roasting in oil wasn't such a good idea considering how slippery it was :/  The flavors were pretty good.  I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I just used red wine vinaigrette right across the board. I think in the future I'll steam it long enough to be able to peel it, then cover and roast it.

This was a great way to cook our beets!  Hubby is allergic to garlic, so I had to improvise.  I used fresh-ground pepper and porcini sea salt to season both parts while cooking.  When they were done with their respective cooking methods, I combined them in one bowl and drizzled them with reduced balsamic vinegar, and tossed to coat.  We couldn't get enough!

I've been making efforts to convert myself from meat and taters to someone eating more balanced. This recipe is one of those vegetable dishes that make me wonder why I wanted just meat and taters! This is very tasty and fairly easy to prepare.

Wow, what a great side dish!  I enjoy beets but have only had them cold on top of my salad.  Per other's suggestions, I sauteed some shitake mushrooms along with the greens.  Mixed both the beets and greens together then added a generous sprinkle of feta.  I didn't add any additional butter or vinegar.  It came out great.  At first glance my boyfriend was going to pass this up but then he went back for seconds.

Loved this! This is even good cold. And what a great way of cooking them even if you want to pickle and can the beets after. It's better than the messy red beet water from boiling.

This was delicious exactly as is! Only changes I might make (tho not necessary) would be to maybe mix the greens with spinach and sprinkle Gorgonzola cheese on top.

I love this recipe!! I bought beets for the first time at a farmers market and wanted a recipe that used the entire beet. I never make salads, but I want to make this one once a week. The beets are sweet and the greens are garlic-y and with the vinegar it all comes together really well!

Excellent recipe. This is one that we have used again and again at our house. I chop up the beets and store them in the fridge, and use them on top of salads or just as a healthy side dish over the course of a week.

Perfect as is. I converted at least 2 non-beet eaters with this recipe. Raves from my kids too. Full of flavor. I did not include the red wine vinegar and instead kept to salt and pepper option. We had with grilled steak. Light enough for a summer side dish. Delicious!

SO delicious!  I wasn't sure if I really liked beets so I bought some at the farmers market (I was getting tired of the standard 5 veggies we always eat).  Found this recipe and saw the great reviews so I tried it - and they are great!  It worked out well because I liked the beets and my husband liked the greens.  My 2 year old actually ate some of the beets as well!  I had to cook my beets for over an hour to get them soft enough though so give yourself plenty of time.  It just depends on how big they are I guess.

Fabulous! I had some Golden Beets from the Farmers market and wanted a recipe that wouldn't cover up the fresh flavor of the beets. This was it! I cooked them in a Dutch oven with the olive oil. They came out tender, slightly browned, and very flavorful. I served them on top of the sauteed greens. For the greens, my changes were that I used 1/2 c of onion, and Balsamic vinegar instead of red wine for more flavor, then cooked them a little long than  stated. I served with baked chicken. It was just delicious and will be made again and again. Thank you!

Roasted beats were ok but lacked flavor. I did not like the sauteed beet greens.

I wasn't super fond of the greens, but this is an easy and delish way to make beets. I didn't see any need to skin the beets.  If you've never given beets a chance, you've gotta try these!

So delicious! I have never had beet greens before and these were so good! The sweet beets compliment the slightly bitter greens.  Added some goat cheese, toasted pecans and a drizzle of balsamic on top.

My family really enjoyed this recipe; the beets have such a delicious flavor and texture when roasted! The greens needed to cook a bit longer though- we like them like our chard or spinach, a bit soggy.

Went looking for a recipe when because I simply couldn't imagine throwing away the gorgeous greens on the organic beets - but I had no idea what.  This recipe was perfect.  Absolutely loved the greens especially.

These are wonderful!  The first time I did just as the recipe says.  The second time I cut the beets into small chunks, and sauted them with the greens and such.  They were on the crunchy side, which was a nice texture change.  We'll be doing these often, as we grow beets and love using all of the plant.

This was a great way to use the whole beet!  And it tastes delicious.  All members of the family (even those not huge beet fans) love this dish.

Beets are one of my favorites and I like this simple method of preparation. Most of all, I like beet greens as a stand alone side dish. They are good raw in salads and I will also make them with (the usual) Eastern Indian seasonings.

I used beets out of my own garden, and I also added Yukon Gold potatoes I grew.  To the saute I added mushrooms and it turned out super yummy.  Thank you for the recipe.  I will be making this again soon.

Delicious. I took the advice of another reviewer and combined the greens to the cooked beets then added feta cheese. The cheese looks beautiful against the bright red. It was delicious.

I've roasted beets once before with great success. Today I steamed them since my summertime main dish didn't require an hour of oven time, and they turned out just as well. But these greens were bit-ter! I have never liked greens too much, and gave these a try, but not again. Yuck. I did add pine nuts to the saute pan, and they added a nice flavor, as well as some good fat/protein. The pine nuts, roasted beets, and vinegar get 4 stars, and the greens 0.

Overall, good.  I sautéed the greens using rosemary olive oil.  I added carrots into the roasting beets and then, at the end, threw them all into the sautéed greens with balsamic vinegar.  This left a nice combination of sweet (from the beets) and acid (from the vinegar).  I'd make it again.

Did just the beets - not the greens.  Really turned out sweet and yummy.  Slice and put on spinach salad with feta.  A great way to get some additional vitamins and iron.

This was the FIRST time I ever tried beets.  We all loved this recipe - my four kids (2-7) loved them and had several servings!!  I added some roasted potatoes, peppers, carrots & onions. I used 2 pans - one for the beets and one for the other veggies!!  Very Good!!

Yum, we loved these. My kids even ate the beets and greens. I used spray olive oil on the beets. I had a hard time peeling them after they were cooked, they were so hot and hard to handle. For the greens I didnt use the oil. I had made bacon this morn. dumped out the grease but saved the pan with all the stuck bits, I sauteed the onion in it then added the greens. Fabulous.

Awesome recipe.  I had to cook my red beets for longer than expected.  Convection oven roast for at least an hour, before I felt they were soft enough.  Incredible flavour, and I felt like a real gourmet serving them up on the greens.  My greens ended up a bit oily, so I would take it easy on the olive oil.  Butter on my beets.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were great.  There weren't a lot of beet greens with the beets I bought earlier in the week, but I'll be sure to look for some with lots of greens next time!  My beets took an hour- I also roasted some sweet potatoes and red onion wedges with them.

Nice. Simple. Easy. Healthy. A winner. I served the beets right on top of the greens and sprinkled with the red wine vinegar (super important to the flavor). The only thing I changed was to wrap the beets in foil-sans oil-and roast them that way. Saves a few calories and just as good! Thanks!

Time to post a review after making this at least 5 times now. I love beets, and roasting them with skins on is the best and easiest way I've found to cook them. The pleasant surprise was the greens! I had always just cut them off and tossed them before finding this recipe - tragic mistake. I had no idea how delicious beet greens were. I've been raving to friends and family since making this recipe the first time. Lately I've been spreading the greens over the cut-up beets after adding the red wine vinegar. I sometimes use balsamic, which is also great. Thanks for the discovery! Note -- I agree with the other reviewers that wish that beet greens alone were widely available.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!  Of course, like any good cook, I added my own touch and used smoked paprika along with the garlic and onion in the greens AS WELL AS the roasted beets!  I also used Balsamic Vinegar over the greens when serving the dish...SO INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS!!!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!  Going to include it on my Thanksgiving table this year! ;)

Absolutely Fantastic!  My wife and I just switched to a plant based diet and wanted to try out beets!  

Just a few variances of my own:

I added fresh ginger, about a tablespoon chunk minced, to the saute. 

I also used white wine instead of red wine vinegar for a more robust sweetness.

I sauteed the garlic, ginger, onions in Coconut oil on LOW (the lowest the flame goes)  for about 15 minutes uncovered before adding in the beet tops and then an additional 10 minutes covered and 5 minutes on medium-low heat uncovered for 5 minutes or until slightly golden and most excess water has steamed off.

My wife added some wild rice into the mix so in the end we had a big bowl of diced beets with rice and the saute.  It was delicious!

Absolutely delicious! I took this recipe and added both parts to brown rice and chopped almonds with a little extra olive oil and some lemon juice - makes a terrific meal! I also saved the raw stems, rather than discarding them, because they make a good snack with veggie dip or peanut butter.

This was fantastic! I did have issues trying to remove the peel after they were cooked. Next time I won't bother - I don't with potatoes. The picky 12 year old liked them as well - that's huge!

Got some HUGE beets today and roasted them but then followed the recipe for the sauted beet greens. Great, easy, fast, nutritious. We did sprinkle a little goat cheese on the beets but not necessary. Thanks!!

Never knew the greens were edible but they're actually quite good! Perfect crunch/ chewy feel. I did add some feta and mixed the beets with the greens so I could serve it all in one dish. Yum!

Loved that I could use ALL of the beet in this recipe.  Next time I'll try evillhog's suggestions:  "I roasted the beets in the oven as instructed but with potatos and carrots as well, then tossed them with a tiny bit of olvie oil and feta. I also added mushrooms and green onions to the beet greens when I sauteed them."

I was trying to get out of the family veggie rut of salad, broc or cauliflower. I used baby beets. Liked the greens and the vinegar too. I'm still not a huge beet fan, but it was a nice change.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I HATE beets. But, this is edible.  The greens are pungent (like mustard greens almost) but together they aren't bad, especially with butter.

This was fantastic!  I was a little nervous because it was my first time eating beets.  I followed the recipe exactly and was pleasantly surprised.  Turns out that I LOVE beets.  I would definitely recommend this to others.  It's super easy to make and a great way to prepare beats without wasting the greens

This recipes only for those who really loves Beets. Beet greens have a specific taste, which made me impossible to eat it. I would try this receipe with a small amount of ingredients first.

Great! I've never cooked the beet greens before and they were great with the wine vinegar. I used white wine vinegar and also thought a nice goat cheese and walnuts (for crunch) would have been nice. What a clean and easy way to do beets!

I finally know what to do with those beet greens! They were very tasty with this recipe. I used the stems too and thought they added a nice crunch. I added a squeeze of lemon juice following another review and it was perfect. From now on I won't be letting those greens go to waste!

So glad we know we can cook the greens as well as the beets now!  I ended up with more beets than greens and would prefer more greens.  They were truly delicious.  I'm eating the leftovers cold tonight with a splash of balsamic vinegar, goat cheese and toasted walnuts.  This was very good.

This recipe was very good!  I was surprised to find that I actually like beets - one of the last few veggies from my childhood that I haven't retried in recent years.  We trimmed the tops back to about an inch or two, left the root on the bulb, wrapped them in foil and baked them on the BBQ like a potato.  So easy!  Once they were done, we skinned the beets and trimmed the tops and roots.  The greens were a bit more of a challenge and I'd make a few changes next time.  First, I'd only use the leafy parts and leave out any stems or 'spines' as they stayed crunchy.  I'd use half butter and half evoo to add more flavour, and possibly add a squeeze of fresh lemon and white wine.    A great recipe as is too!  Thanks for sharing!

This is very good.  I did not use any of the oil and used garlic and onion powder instead of fresh.  I added dried thyme because I think it goes nicely with beets.  The vinegar added a nice flavor to this dish.  I will be making this again.

This dish was amazing! I am not a huge fan of beets but I'll definitely be buying them more often from now on. I used two bulbs of baby garlic for this recipe instead of two mature cloves, and cooked the greens in cast iron, the flavor was just perfect.

Very good!  I made it as is and served with a splash of red wine vinegar.  The greens were delicious, and the beets had an incredibly earthy flavor, nicely offset by the vinegar.

Good, not a huge fan of beets, but I really enjoyed this. I dont think i cooked the greens long enough, because they were still quite bitter, but will try again later. The beets themselves were awsome.

This was a hit!  I would exclude the stalks int he future & only use the green part of the stalk.  Easy & delicious!!!  The root of the beet was carmalized like candy.

Simple, clean, and very tasty!  Next time I might add some herbs.  This time, I took another reviewer's suggestion and roasted the beats with carrots.  I also roasted some garlic cloves along with it.  Very, very good! Will definitely be making this on a regular basis.

This is a great recipes.  My family never liked beets but I got some at the farmers market this summer and tried this recipe.  Everyone loved it.  I will keep making it for sure.  I followed the recipe just as is and it is perfect!

This recipe has me hooked on beets!  The beets need nothing.  For the greens, I add a bit of lemon or white wine while wilting them.  A crowd pleaser, and a recipe that will turn the most skeptical beet hater into a lover!

I like simple flavors, and this recipe has them. Of course, you can sub other types of vinegar for the red wine type. I used Balsamic and it was lovely.  I mixed this recipe, once cooked, with slightly blanched and then fried seasonal veggies; namely yellow and green beans, garden carrots and garden sugar snap peas. I just tossed the other veg in with the almost cooked beets. Quite delicious!

The beets were awesome & simple, just like my mom used to make. The greens I won't do again. They were soft but bitter. Not that tasty. I might cut them smaller and add to an orzo for the nutrients. The beets I cut in half before baking but they still were al-dente, not soft enough, after 1 hour. They were hard to peel so we just ate the peels, we didn't even notice they were still on. The beets are just so flavorful this way.

This was a big hit at a cook-out we had.  Before serving - I put the greens in the bottom of my dish and placed the roasted beets on top.  Splashed with a little cider vinegar and it was awesome!  So easy to make!

This recipe allows the flavor of the beets to rule! My husband and I love the nutritional of both the beets and the yummy greens.  No more canned beets for us.  I look forward to savoring the sweet nutty beet flavors and the relaxation this recipe brings.

This is the first time I've had fresh beets and they are way better than pickled (which I detest).  I'd give them three stars, good but not amazing.  The greens however, out of this world.  They are really, really delicious.  I added sesame seeds and red pepper flakes (prior to the onion and garlic) to give it a little crunch and spice. It was perfect.  Definitely five stars.

I've been making this recipe for a while now and love it. I made this for dinner one night when we had some new friends over, I really wasn't sure how this would go over since I didn't know what vegetables they like.  The beets were gone in minutes!  They loved them also.

This was the 1st time I have roasted beets (usually boil them).  These were wonderful and easy and half the mess!  I used a stone barpan and clean-up was a breeze.  Definitely will do again.

I have never really liked beets, they are too "healthy tasting."  But, this recipe changes everything.  The greens were especially tasty.  The only change I made was adding additional garlic and onions, and I choose to add vinegar at the end.

omg the greens!! so good, so easy, so dead-on. I will be making this much more often - I live by myself and roast beets and sweet potatoes to eat throughout the wee before my workouts. The greens I ate for dinner - all of them. By myself. Kinda wish they sold beet greens separately. I could eat those over and over. The balsamic really sets it off!

This was good. I made as directed the first time. The beets took longer to cook than I thought. The second time I wrapped each beet individually in foil after rubbing olive oil and salt and pepper on them. That seems to work a bit better. The big standout though were the beet greens. Who knew they were so good? I asked my mom and friends if they had ever eaten beet greens. Nobody had! I added shallots to the onion and garlic sautee. Very very tasty. I wish I could buy the greens by themselves.

Simple and effective.  I went long on time since it was covered and oiled.  Perfect result!  I also had about 7 whole carrots in the pan for the whole cook.  Perfect Paleo sides!

I bought some fresh beets today for another recipe but wanted a way to use the greens.  THis recipe was EXACTLY the right choice!  They were AMAZING!  I made them exactly as written and just sprinkled some S&P on them when they were finished.  So good!  I agree with another reviewer..they really should sell these like they do other greens.  I think they are better than spinach, and I LOVE spinach!

I had never tried beets before, or the beet greens. I am not really a cook at all, so I can't say that I've ever even sauteed something. That said, I followed this and the beets and greens came out lovely! I was particularly happy with the greens. I used a corningware style baking dish with a glass lid, and it took a little longer to cook. I put things in for 70 minutes.

These beets were delicious right out of the oven. I sliced a few and ate them as is and cubed a few, sprinkled with crumbled goat cheese and toasted walnuts. Great salad!

Absolutely yummy.... I roasted organic carrots with the beets and after sauteeing the greens in garlic & onions I added the beets & the carrots.  It was simple,  colorful and delightfully delicious.  I served it with tri-color corn on the cob....

This is the best way to prepare fresh beets.  Mine were from an organic garden and were so delicious and sweet.  Roasting makes the flavor shine.  I will use the greens too, just had to start with the root & yummmmm!  Thanks.

Beet greens taste great!  Never knew you could cook them.  They taste similar (perhaps even better b/c they are more delicate, less tough) than red swiss chard.  Straightforward prep.

Two yummy side dishes, so simple to make... worth every star.  This was my first time eating both fresh beets and greens.  I have to say, I don't like pickled beets so much and was a bit leery of this new world of fresh beets, but they were delicious.  The greens were also very yummy; on par with wilted spinach as far as my husband and I were concerned... thank you for the great recipes!

Great recipe. My beets didn't have the tops so I didn't get to try the greens. I didn't peel them and I wouldn't reccommend that you do; the skin softened up and really added to the dish. The seasoning didn't really penetrate the beet, though and they were rather plain. Next time I will probably quarter the beets before cooking just to get some better flavor.

I love this recipe for the beets (did not cook the greens, so can't comment on that).  I added the red wine vinegar and the olive oil together and drizzled over the sliced beets along with a little sea salt before baking covered in the oven.  I did extend the cook time by an extra 10 minutes.  These are so delicious, and I just love the colour, flavor and texture.

I use this recipe at least twice a month. My family loves it. I do not use vinagar. I keep the stems and saute them too. I added spinach leaves last time and it seemed to go well together.

I always quarter my beets to roast and I never peel them. I also leave about an inch or two of the stem/leaves. I have been roasting beets so I'm sure this recipe is delish! However, I have not tried the greens and will today. I will probably add kale since I have sauteed kale just like this before.

So cool and simple! I had never eaten beet greens before.  I love getting to use more of my produce.

I used the greens along with kale in a soup that I usually cook with kale or chard, and they worked pretty nicely.  I also added them to a non-daily leek potato soup because I wanted more veggies, and that also worked nicely.

This was the first time I've eaten beets since I was a kid (and hated them).  I decided to give this recipe a try in an effort to continue to expand the kinds of vegetables that I eat.  I thought this recipe was quite good and will make it again.  I liked being able to use both the greens and the beets themselves.

I've been roasting beets for a long time but never knew what to do with the greens.  I love the greens recipe - it's so simple and super tasty!  For the roasted beets, I like to thinly slice them before roasting them so that each slice has that roasted quality...  it's best to work swiftly one beet at a time so you don't end up with a ton of beet juice mess, but it's well worth the extra slicing!

The beets were delicious and the greens tasted good - I actually thought that the onion was a bit much.  My husband liked the beets better than the greens - he said that it felt like he was using his molars as they were intended ;)   Good recipe, nice way to use all of the food.  Will make again.

Excellent! The onion caramelizes and adds a sweet 'roundness' to the beet greens. I actually buy beets these days, so I can make these beet greens. As a change of pace, I use the beets in the Beet Salad with Goat Cheese recipe submitted by Donna.

So much prep time - the fresh beets taste so good that they don't need this time spent on them.

I've never rated anything a 5 on this site before, but this was delicious! My husband cooked this for me after I dug up some beets from my garden. I had already cooked the beets and he sauteed the greens and the other stuff to add to it. It was perfect. He didn't like it, but it wasn't the recipe. I guess he just doesn't like beets!

This is absolutely delicious, I loved them so much I went out in the garden and picked more beets with the greens and cooked them. The greens were fantastic.
I followed the recipe to the tee.

I didn't want to run my oven for an hour for 3 beets so I wrapped in moist paper towels and microwaved 10 min (turning at 5).  They still turned out great but we love oven roasted veggies so I'll definity try again when I have more veggies to roast.

I bought fresh organic beets from the farmers market and made the beets and greens that night.  I added in some spinach to increase the amount.  Good thing I did, I never thought my 6 and 8 year old would argue over who got the last of the greens!!  My 2 year old's favorite veggie is roasted beets.  A big hit with our family.

Absolutely fantastic! I'd never had fresh beets and these were so delicious, easy, and nutrious. I did cut back on the olive oil, didn't use salt, and just served with the sauted oil/garlic. Wow!
An additional comment:  I've now made this several times and the last time I left the beets in the oven longer than planned.  They were even more delicious and didn't need peeling!

This was a pretty good recipe.  I felt like the greens were lacking something so I added crushed red peppers and 1/2 tablespoon of red wine vinegar.  I love beets, so overall I was happy with the dish.

I used this recipe for the beet greens b/c I had already made the beet roots. I omitted the garlic because I ran out so I used garlic salt instead. I also added a little chopped chives at the end since i had them on hand. This a was a very simple and delicious recipe. It felt good not wasting any part of the produce!

My immediate family loves beet greens but my extended family had never had them.  I cooked this for a birthday party last night and everyone was amazed that they had never tried them before.  The greens are so mild.  Cooked in this very simple manner brings out their best flavor. I did not use the onions or the vinegar.  With the beets, I was running a little late so gave them a 5 minute jump start in the microwave before putting them in the oven.  Also, I sprinkled a little rosemary on the beets before cooking them.

Not being a lover of beets, I saw something on television the other day for a roasted beet salad.  I decided to go to Allrecipes.com and found this recipe and I am so glad that I did.  I bought organic beets and they were in the oven just a little over one hour due to their size.  I only had a dipping olive oil that had bleu cheese in it (strange, I know!) and I used that for both the roasting of the beets and the wilting of the greens.  Although I was skeptical, I am so glad that I tried this recipe because I actually like beets now and both of my kids ate them up although the greens were probably more of an adult taste for them.  We ate them without the additional butter or red wine vinegar, too.  Delicious!

This recipe made a beet lover out of me. The roasted beets are great as is, or served over greens with goat cheese, nuts and a drizzle of balsamic vinaigrette. The greens are delicious as published here. I did a variation by adding fresh spinach and sautéing with the beet greens.

Very tasty easy recipe! I made it twice and the second time took the advice of another reviewer and added mushrooms and a pat of butter to the greens then sprinkled some feta cheese over the top once it was done. Very good, both ways.

Very yummy! One kid hated everything at dinner, more for everyone else! Everyone else loved it! I peeled and chopped the bigger beets because I had irregular sized beets from the garden. I am super bummed that all these years I had been throwing away the greens. Wow, so good!! I finished the greens with just a bit of balsamic.  Oh, my husband "hates" beets but for some reason got a second helping, hmmmm.

THANK YOU for this recipe!! Beets came in my CSA share, so I made this only because I didn't want to waste the beet greens and I'm glad I did! The dish was extremely better than expected. I also added a small bunch of tri-colored Swiss Chard and I used roasted garlic powder and onion powder (staples for me these days) in lieu of fresh. Will definitely make again!

This was my first time ever purchasing fresh beets and I had no idea what to do with them. This recipe was easy to follow and both the roasted beets and the greens came out delicious. I added a bit more onion to the greens and added crushed red pepper instead of salt & pepper. I'll definitely be buying beets more often now!

This was my first time eating beets not from a can (embarrassing, I know). I wanted to make this a main dish so I browned some smoked sausage pieces before adding the greens. Once finished, I also added some crumbled goat cheese. Delicious and we will have it often, I am sure!!

This was my first time roasting beets and I have to say this recipe is very easy and delicious. I roasted a red potato with the beets and added green squash,mushrooms and rosemary to the greens. I can't wait to make it again.

My BFF's sister-in-law made these when we went to see them @ the lake...they were the perfect mid-summer outdoor dish.  She didn't have red wine vinegar, so she used balsemic and lemon juice, and she sprinkled feta over all.  Wonderful!

WOW!  This dish is incredible.  I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and added potatoes and carrots to the beets.  I love onion so I added more than the recipe called for.  Everything in the dish came from my CSA except for the carrots which were organic.  So it was a fresh and delightful dish.  Definitely going in my permanent recipe file.  Thank you, thank you for this super recipe!!!!

Yum, yum, yum!  This was so good!  I've never cooked beets before and I'm so glad I picked this recipe for my first time.  Hubby and I both really enjoyed this dish.  I tried the red wine vinegar on some and butter/S&P on some and enjoyed both, but I think I like the butter/S&P best.  These are good with goat cheese also.  Will definitely make again, thanks for sharing!

I didn't think I liked beets, but I've changed my mind after I got some homegrown beets from a friend and found this recipe. I nuked them until soft and then peeled them once they cooled down a bit. The stained fingers are well worth this delicious dish. I will be looking for fresh beets next time at the market!

I searched for a recipe using the greens as I do not like them in a salad. They were terrific sauteed - even my 4 and 6 year old kids asked for seconds. Will make again!

Ever since I can remember, I've hated the pickled beets my dad always orders at the diner. When my CSA share included beets last week, I didn't know what to do with them. I took the plunge today, and I can't believe I've been missing out on something so yummy! Definitely give this recipe a try.

It doesn't help that I'm not a real big beet fan unless they're pickled just right, but I did not care for the beet greens. I won't do this one again.

I wanted to try cooking beets that I got at my local farmer's market. I don't know if I did something wrong, but these tasted like dirt. They were so bad I couldn't eat them and that rarely happens!

I love Beets!! And this was an awesome way to get beet greens in my diet. They are high in potassium and very good for you and if you follow this recipe they are sweet and a little acidic which made them awesome, My fiance does not like beets and he even said it was good.

This was a wonderful recipe! I'm new to fresh beets, and I was excited to find a recipe for the beets and the greens! I chopped up the beets first and roasted them with chopped sweet potato. They were fantastic with just a little butter.

This was a wonderful combination, particularly for when you have fresh beets that come with tops.  Easy to prepare and healthy ingredients to boot.  The only thing I changed is that I added a drizzle of balsamic vinegar to the beet greens as well as the beets themselves.

This was my first time cooking beets, and I was pleasantly surprised!  I peeled my beets before cooking them and I added carrots; the beets were small so the cooking time was reduced.  The greens were amazing!  This will be a regular side dish on my menu.

This is a wonderful recipe that I have made several times. If you can get yellow golden beets, from your farmer's market, definitely try them. They have a fantastic flavor and do not bleed like red beets.

A little bland.  I didn't like the greens on their own because I personally don't like bitter greens, but when I mixed the two together, they complimented each other well enough.

After buying lovely beets at the farmers market, I needed someone to hold my hand through cooking the greens.  This recipe was great for the whole beet.  I added mushrooms to the greens, and it was a big hit.  Thanks for the help!

We were so happy when we found this recipe. We had no idea that you could eat the beet greens. We grow our own beets and it is great to use all of it. To me, the greens tasted a little bit like spinach.  We basically followed the recipe exactly.  We used red onions. I think next time we will make the amount of onions more equal to the amount of greens.  The onions added a nice sweetness that balanced the greens.

I've only had beets once before (canned), and I hated them.  This was delicious and very easy.  Thanks for adding a new veggie to my diet!

This was the first time I used the green part of the beets. Many times they don't look so healthy or edible. This past weekend, I visited the local farmer's market and they were healthy and fresh looking. WoW! I think I like the green part just as much or more than the actual beets. I used a little balsamic vinegar. I'm really happy that I tried this recipe and mine looked exactly like the picture. I'll be doing this again.

The beets came out fine.  Although I eat them often this is the first time I have roasted them.  The flavor was good and it was nice to be able to throw them in the oven while I worked on the rest of the dish but I didn't think they had an exceptionally different flavor than the way I typically cook them.  The greens were fine, just nothing special.

The greens were my favorite part. They were incredible. 

I was weary of roasting beets but decided to give it a try because beets are full of vitamins.  I am so glad I tried this recipe first.  It is excellent!!  

Note: I needed the full hour to roast the beets and my oven usually cooks faster than prescribed time.

I loved the simplicity of this recipe!  I did modify it slightly.  I very lightly caramelized the onions because I have stomach issues and I also only used a drizzle of oil for the onions with a non stick pan.  I gave the greens a tiny hit of lemon juice at the end to brighten the flavour.   Next time I’ll finely slice the onions rather than chopped.  There's nothing nicer than picking some fresh beets from your garden and serving up both the beets and the greens!

Heavenly!  Omitted the onions with the greens - they're not my favorite.  A smattering of Trader Joe's sea salt after cooking - Yum.  Put it all on my plate, and of course then the kids begged for some.

This recipe was GREAT! I always hate throwing away parts of a vegetable that you purchase by weight anyways! The fact that it incorporated eating the greens as well really made this a great recipe and the combination of dark fuschia (i would have contributed a picture, however my attempts at peeling the beets made them unappealing in appearance) plus the bright leafy greens made his  high potassium meal oh so yummy!

When I was a kid my family always had pickled, canned beets and I hated them!Now at 35 I decided to give them a try in a grown-up version! I love these! Coudn't get beets with greens at the store I was at, but the roasted beets are fabulous!

My husband prepared fresh beets using this method and we all enjoyed them very much.  He usually doesn't eat canned beets and when we came across them in the produce section it provided us with a change.  Unfortunately the greens were already detached, but we will look for them next time as my husband is bound and determined to get me to try some sort of greens.
Thanks for sharing!

Prior to trying this recipe, I'd never before eaten beets. I was very pleasantly surprised. I don't know whether beets will ever beets will ever be a regular part of my diet, but for those who enjoy them, this is a great preparation. Don't remove the skins, because they're actually the best part

I usually just throw away the greens b/c I don't know what to do with them. So, this was my first time making them, and I thought thay were great! Sort of like spinach with a peppery bite! I added a splash of lemon juice to the greens while they were cooking. However, I prefer the roasting beets in water method better than the olive oil. yum, thanks!

This is the first year I grew beets in my garden.  I was first introduced to home grown beets by my mother -in-law.  This recipe is a double blessing.  Both dishes were a hit with my husband and my toddler.  My son loves how the beets turn his and our tongues purple!

This is a good, simple guide to roast beets, though mine took a little over an hour to cook completely (maybe larger than usual?) Beet greens were also good as written.

A great way to make a delicious meal using the whole beet. I added some spinach and other leafy greens and topped with mild goat cheese. I’ll definitely be making this again.

I'll start with the fact I'm not a big fan of beets. They're not bad, but too earthy for me. That said, this recipe is excellent. The beets and the greens were really good. The only change I made, is that I added a lot more onion (by accident, but it was an excellent mistake)

We've only eaten beets from a can.  THIS is fabulous!  Although the recipe suggests peeling them after cooking, I found that very difficult.  Believe the next time, I'll peel them with a potato peeler and then steam.

The beets were tasty, although they took longer to bake than what was stated in the recipe. (I know beets vary a lot in size).  The big surprise to me was that the greens were excellent, and not bitter at all! I forgot to try the red wine vinegar, but the greens were great just the same.

We love beets!  First time I cooked the beets and the greens and it wa great!  I may boil the beets next time as someone suggested since they do take a lot of time to soften.  Great way to eat fresh beets and no waste.

So Delicious. I pinched in some thyme to the roasted beets. I chose the red wine vinegar option. 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar was the perfect measure. I don't know how I could prepare beets any other way from now on.

Very good.  I will put more onion in next time.  I added plain feta cheese and it added a nice flavor.  I used plain rice vinegar.  The greens were very delicious too.

This is my favorite way to prepare beets and greens. I've made this many times now, following the recipe as-is, sans the onions. It always draws compliments, even from folk who ordinarily avoid beets.

Yummy, easy recipe!  A viewer recommended boiling the beats but I believe there is nothing more tasty than Roasting veggies. I did my in the toaster oven.This was a delicious recipe and so easy.  I started it and hubby finished it.  Beets fresh out of our garden.

Wonderful recipe, and easy to prepare.  I love trying the green tops from produce from our garden.  once sauteed they are not bitter.  I prepared them as directed,but I think next time I will add some fresh rosemary to the beets and see how that tastes. Also think a skoosh of lavender balsamic would add a nice touch to the sauteed greens.

My new husband kept saying he "hated" beets. I was convinced he had just never had them the way I could prepare them. This was the exact recipe I was looking for! It does take longer than I thought it would and I had started way early...The beets, though small, still took an hour to cook through. In order to cool them rapidly, I took them out of the glass baking dish I had used and put them into an aluminum "throw-away" pan and put them into the freezer for about  30 minutes. Using rubber gloves helped peeling them without the fingers being stained. I did cut the onions in slices and caramelized them along with some minced garlic (something I could do while waiting for the beets to roast) I also used a really good balsamic vinegar to liven up the flavor of the greens and beets. He loved the greens and Yes, he even loved the beets! Next time will probably do this in stages..cooking beets the day before.

This was the first time I had ever roasted beets.  I had to roast them an hour to get them cooked well but still firm in texture  Although the beets were good, I think I prefer them in the crockpot.  Before sauteing the greens, I completely removed the stems from the leaves and washed them (and the beets) well but somehow ended up with a little dirt in my dish (my fault not the recipes.)  If you make this, try washing the beets again before you combine them with the greens.  Overall, this recipe is good but a bit of trouble and took more time than stated in the recipe.

4 out of 5 only because cooking time will vary depending on the size of the beets. I cut mine so that they were the all approximately the same size of an egg. With that size the cooking time was 45 minutes. And sauté the stems with the greens! Just put them in first. Delicious! I like the idea someone else had about roasting potatoes and carrots with the beets. Must try that next time.

Delicious!! Made as directed except I microwaved the peeled & quartered beets for about 7 minutes. I also used a splash more vinegar than called for and added 2 tbsp feta cheese, which is pictured but not lsited in the recipe. My husband isn't a great fan of beets but he repeatedly remarked how much he liked this dish. Thanks for a great recipe!

The only change I made was to cook the onions until they were a light  brown, then I added the  garlic.  I did not use the optional red wine vinegar.

This was the first time I made roasted beets. I am not sure if I will make them again. I have not eaten desserts in years and I just found the beets too sweet. I have some leftovers so I might try adding some of the vinegar to see if I like it better.  The greens were excellent and taste very similar to swiss chard. My husband has never liked beets and tried one bite. He would not eat another bite. He did, however, enjoy the greens.

Just a tip for people who like to eat beats a lot.
Use a pressure cooker!  I was having a  rally tough time get the beets done on time for dinner.... seemed they always took longer that I thought... With a pressure cooker, 15 mins!! period!!

I liked this a lot, but didn't even attempt to feed it to my Husband (not a vegetable lover).  I did sprinkle the top with Feta Cheese (like in one of the photos). I forwarded this recipe to my Mother-In-Law, who has copious amounts of Beets in her Garden each year.

Excellent and simple to prepare.  I added a bit of crushed red pepper flakes and minced onion flakes to the pan, also. I did not cut out the stem from the greens…did not find it necessary. Other than that, I followed the recipe pretty closely. Also, the beets took longer than an hour. Great way to use up our beet harvest with no waste.

The beets are delicious.  I'd never had beets before and loved them like this, just tossed in a teaspoon of butter.  I was not a fan of the greens.

Simple and delicious! The baby beets from my weekly CSA delivery came out perfectly tender and did not taste overly "earthy".  I sprinkled Red Wine vinegar over them right after they came out the oven.  Will definitely have these again.

Even my beet hating husband loved this! I used apple cider vinegar because I was out of red wine vinegar, and sprinkled feta on top. Delicious!

Love this recipe for the part on cooking the greens - love that I can get some use out of them. Cook the beets in olive oil and some rosemary springs!

Absolutely delicious! I was bbq'ing already so I peeled and diced the beets then made a foil pouch to cook them on the grill then sautéed the greens with shallots and tossed both in balsamic vinegar. Yumm!! Thanks for sharing!

Very good and very simple. My husband loved the unique flavor the greens provided. I will definitely make these again probably playing with the recipe a bit. I like to try variations of everything. Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious! This was my first time preparing and eating beets that weren't from a can. I was a little nervous to try it, but it was very easy and yummy. Next time I will try peeling them before roasting them because they were a bit hot to handle (and messy) when I peeled them after. Buttering them (instead of the vinegar) was a great idea. My husband loved them too, and said they were "rustic". I will definitely make these again.

Never thought of cooking the beet greens, loved them even on their own. I chose the red wine vinegar and mixed everything together at the end, chilled the dish and served. Very good.

We loved this! The vinegar added to the greens after cooking brought out a sweetness in the greens. My beets took twice as long to cook so they weren't ready with the rest of the meal, but they were so yummy.

only had 2 lg beets and they baked forever,and still didn't get soft. So I peeled them and used bok choy for the greens,as they came without tops.Hubs n I enjoyed these, but I think fresh beets are too messy to deal with.

This was my first time ever cooking fresh beets and they were pretty good!  Hubby liked the greens; I thought they were okay.  We ate the beets plain because we just didn't feel like butter or seasoning was necessary.

We wrap the beets in foil with a little olive oil and roast them on the grill for about 20 minutes (more or less, depending on their size).  The greens are excellent.

Exceptional.  Of note, it needs many more bunches of beets than one needs beets in order to get enough greens to do much with.

Beets were awesome!  I added a few carrots to the pan, too.  However, I thought the greens were pretty gross.
