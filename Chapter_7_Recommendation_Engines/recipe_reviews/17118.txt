My husband and I absolutly love mushrooms and this recipe really makes them shine.  The only thing I did differently was used fresh mushrooms and sauteed them in white wine and butter.  When they were sufficiently cooked I added the mushrooms and their leftover liquid to the recipe instead of using canned.  This is a keeper,  Thanks a lot.

I loved this recipe.  I used boneless skinless breasts which I pounded thin between waxed paper.  I browned for a few minutes each side in olive oil.  The thin breasts cooked up tender in only 30 minutes in the oven.  We love mushrooms so I doubled this ingredient.  My husband went nuts over this.  Definitely something I would do again and again.  I think it could be used for baked pork chops also!

I haven't tried the recipe but would like to comment on the negative responses.  If you don't think its something that you would care to try, that's your opinion but no need to bash someone's recipe because they choose to use canned soup and canned veggies.  I prefer natural ingredients and fresh veggies as well but that's my preference.  I don't see anything wrong with using canned ingredients as a shortcut.

Good base recipe - I loved the addition of the sherry in this yummy sauce, but as other reviews have noted, the recipe is a bit bland as it is.  I added about 1 tsp Herb de Provence, about 1/4 tsp garlic & onion powders & used double the amount of (frozen) mushrooms required. With those additions, this recipe was delicious.  I served it with fresh green beans, which I steamed for 5 minutes then sauteed in a pan w/thinly sliced red onion, pancetta cubes & a splash of balsamic vinegar) & white buttered rice - a spectacular meal in no time at all! Thanks for the inspiration w/this recipe!

I have been making this for many years. It is a quick go to recipe for anytime and for company, too.  I usually serve it with wild rice, broccoli or asparagus and salad.  I do brown the chicken in a little olive oil, salt and pepper. Remove the chicken, add fresh mushrooms to the same pan and as other reviewers have said, saute fresh mushrooms with butter (only real butter will do), salt and a small shake of pepper and white wine.  *** I also often add scallions along with mushrooms for more flavor and color.*** Remove mushrooms and scallions  from pan when golden brown. Set aside with the chicken. Lately, I've replaced the cream of mushroom soup with a reduction sauce that I make with the pan drippings from the chicken and mushrooms, adding a little more white wine (1/4 -1/2 cup). You can optionally add a little corn starch or flour  to thicken. I do not add the flour or corn starch. The reduction sauce thickens on its own.  While reduction sauce is simmering, I place the chicken and most of the mushrooms  in a baking dish. Add the sour cream to the pan with the sauce and mix. Pour sauce over chicken/ mushrooms , adding remaining mushrooms on top. Bake as directed.
Note: I now like "real" ingredients. That's why I don't add  soup. Too many ingredients I can't pronounce and would not have in my pantry - going "all natural" when I can.

Easy recipe.  I do something very similar with boneless chicken breasts. I am really surprised by the reviewers who are so down on this recipe because it uses canned mushroom soup & canned mushrooms.  It is so easy to make your own cream of anything soup & use fresh mushrooms instead of tinned ones.  I am sure if they don't have a cream soup recipe already there are many very good ones on this site.  It is a great recipe for both the novice (who will use the canned soup) & the more experienced cooks who will make the soup from scratch.  Thanks for posting this.

I have done this same recipe (minus the sherry) with pork chops and chicken (boneless) in a slow cooker, it's so tender and delicious!!!  I do put 2 cans of healthy request cream of mushroom and a full 16 oz of fat free sour cream and I put noodles in the slow cooker 15 minutes prior to serving,  just so simple and delish!!! This is a feel good meal with no guilt! If you want a splash of flavor add a few tablespoons of Worcester sauce to gravy mix!

Very, very good!  Made this last night, but cut the recipe in half (well, the 'sauce' anyway, used 2 bone in chicken breasts).  Only changes I made were to sautee fresh mushrooms with 2 cloves of minced garlic before hand and then mixed with the sour cream & sherry.  Added in some herbes de provence for extra flavour.  Topped with paprika and baked as directed...yummy!  Served with steamed broccoli!

Sorry, any recipe that starts with canned mushrooms and cream of mushroom soup (which I don't have a problem with as a shortcut), sounds terrible.  This is pretty much a tasteless combo.  Use fresh mushrooms, saute in some butter, add some smoked paprika and chop some parsley...then you're on to something.

I was disappointed.  The dish lacked flavor.  The ingredients sounded like they would be really good.  Maybe I'll try again and add some spices.

I have made this recipe for years and the whole family loves it. However,  I use boneless chicken tenders (  uncooked)  ,  add 6 oz grated swiss chesse on top of the chicken before adding the soup, sour cream and sherry. When that is completed milt 1/4 cup butter and mix in 2 Cups of dry herb stuffing. Top with the stuffing mixture and bake for 1 - 1  1/2 hours at 350 degrees.

The only thing I changed  up was used brandy instead of sherry and used fresh mushrooms. Added S&P Garlic powder and threw in about 4 clioves of garlic in the saureed mushrooms. For those who say it was bland, remember it's your dish so you can season it anytime you'd like and make it to your taste.  I doubt I ever  not added something to a new recipe I try.  I feel like if I don't like it, then it's kind of my fault, because you can always do something to a dish to make it taste better.

I only had boneless/skinless chicken breasts, so I added some garlic and used smoked paprika.  It was flavorful and definitely a recipe I'll make again.

We really loved this dish. I added all but a dusting of the paprika to the sour cream mixture and used half a pound of fresh baby portabella mushrooms sauteed in white wine. YUM!

This is one of the most flavorful dishes I have ever had. I thought I would not like it as I don't like the smell of sherry and also don't like mushrooms. I was basically making it for my husband. But I gave him my mushrooms and gobbled this up. I served it with  yellow rice. I made this exactly the way the recipe was here. The only thing I will change next time is double the gravy and he would love to try it with mashed potatoes!!! This is the first time I have ever written a review on this site. Delicious!!!! Thank you Sandra!!!

My mom gave me a can of cream of mushroom soup and I had no idea what to make with it. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try! The original sounded a little bland so I added rosemary, ground pepper, and garlic powder, too. I used fresh mushrooms since I had some, and I hate canned. 
I didn't have cooking sherry, but I used some Jameson whisky instead and it was delightful. I served over brown rice. Love it, will definitely be using this again!
With such a simple base it's easy to make the recipe your own!

Very good.  I made just like the recipe but I had about a cup of fresh mushrooms that I sautéd in butter and cooking wine, in addition to the can of mushrooms. I had very large chicken breasts and it was done in 1/14 hours. I served it  with atossed salad and orzo that I browned and then cooked in chicken broth, when almost done I added some chopped frozen broccoli .  It worked well with the chicken..  I will make it again, my DH  really enjoyed it.

The recipe as written is a good basic recipe.  I made note of some suggestions from other comments.  I added onion and garlic powder to my dish.  Rarely in 39 years of cooking for the family has my wife paid a compliment, I got one tonight!  Ladies believe me, I understand the frustration when you get no feedback on a meal.  I'm contemplating trying Smokey Paprika and fresh Rosemary.  But my wife and granddaughter wants me to add to the dinner rotation.

I followed the directions, except I don't like cooking sherry so I substituted "real" sherry (bonus:  you can sip a glass while you're cooking!).  This dish gets points for being super-easy, but it does need seasoning ... onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and Herbs de Provence or tarragon would be good additions.  It would be a 4-star recipe with those changes.  Still, we liked it and it's a good starting point that can be customized to your taste.

I think that this is an easy base recipe; especially for newer cooks and busy working moms. As you have time and more experience, you can adjust the recipe with more natural and fresh ingedients. I've been in gourmet dinner groups for many years;  yet there is always a can of cream of mushroom soup in my pantry for the occasional quick and satisfying meal.

As others have done, I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and browned them in a skillet. I also sautéed 8 oz. of fresh mushrooms, 2 finely diced shallots, and 3 minced garlic cloves to add to the sauce. I also added 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper, and 2 tsp herbs de Provence. I stirred everything together well and poured it over the chicken breasts. I started checking the breasts for tenderness at 30 minutes. I needed 45 minutes of baking time. I loved it and so did my neighbors. If you like a good salt flavor, you might want to add one full tsp of salt.

I live in the mountains 40 miles from the nearest small store and reguardless what others use my only option at the spur of the moment is canned ingredients, I made it and it was very good. We also will try it with pork.

Until now, "jennies' heavenly slow cooker chicken" was my favorite saucy chicken recipe, but this one is just as tasty, easier and faster. It has a rich stroganof-like flavor.
I rarely resist tweaking a recipe,  but made this one "by the book".  I was a bit reluctant at first because no seasonings were called for. Have no fear, put it over some egg noodles and you'll be smilin'!

This was very tasty!  I made half the recipe and followed the recipe proportionately. One change, as many others have also pointed out, was to add fresh mushrooms that I sauteed in olive oil with some onions and garlic which I added to the cream of mushroom soup and sour cream mix.  I served this with a mushroom risotto. I will definitely make this again!

This was pretty good.  I took the skin off and I sprinkled onion and garlic powder, black pepper and Lawrys seasoned salt on the chicken breasts.  Otherwise, it might have been bland.

Very good! Quick and easy to make which is great when you have to do things and dont feel like cooking really. I served it with mash potatoes and used the sauce like a gravy for the potatoes.  I also seasoned the cutlets with garlic and salt and pepper to give a little more flavor.

I agree with Steph, there is nothing worse than a pompous  that thinks that everyone should think the way they do. I like canned ingredients, they are simple to use and just as flavorful. Please do not disrespect others with a differing opinion. I LOVED this recipe just the way it was posted on the site. Well done!

This recipe has been a favorite of ours for a long time.  I cook it in my crock pot and use boneless chicken breasts.  Before cooking, I sprinkle them with a little pepper and some paprika.  I have made this recipe with fresh ingredients as well as with canned soup and canned mushrooms and it is equally delicious.  It just depends on how much time I have and what ingredients I have on hand.  I have made it with sherry and with dry white wine and either is equally good.  Served with rice and a green vegetable, it is a dish that is easy to prepare and always a winner.  Thanks for sharing.

Two words best describe this recipe:  BUTTERY PERFECTION!

The reason that I didn't give this recipe the full 5 stars is because it lacks seasonings and I highly recommend fresh mushrooms for a richer flavor.   I absolutely love mushrooms and this recipe really brings out their flavor.  Trust me, go with the fresh mushrooms, it really makes a BIG DIFFERENCE..

This dish is so tasty that you could serve it to guests and they'd think you slaved for hours in the kitchen.  One thing I recommend is doubling up the sauce.  The first time I made this I didn't think there was enough sauce, so the 2nd time I made it, I doubled the sauce and was very happy with the results.

I'll definitely be making this one again.

This was so, so good. I made a few changes out of necessity (chicken leg quarters instead of breasts, marsala instead of sherry, fresh mushrooms instead of canned), which is why I didn't give it five stars, even though we had no complaints. But it was simple and delicious anyways, and I look forward to making it again!

Very good and easy to make, cleanup is also a breeze. This recipe enhanced the flavor of mushrooms. I used skinless chicken breast tenderloins and the flavor was terrific.

So easy, saucy & delish. I also added fresh sautéed mushroom & Herbes de Provençe with fresh cracked pepper on top when served. Easy to make Israeli cous-cous blend (from TJ's) mixed with some of the sauce & mushrooms -- and was served below it all. Yum! Sophisticated-seeming comfort food with minimal effort! Enjoy!

First time: Used 3 boneless/skinless chicken breasts. Added 1 can of cream of chicken with the 1 can of cream of mushroom; should've doubled these cans.  Not enough sauce for chicken AND a small pad of rice; it is best to use a 11x7 baking dish--nothing larger.  Still, this first run was decent--and you can get creative  and tweak this basic recipe. But tonight, this tastes fine by itself w/ fresh side veggies.

I enjoyed this, simple to assemble and feeds an army. My husband was a huge fan. I did add some herb de provance to the sauce and it helped.

The chicken came out nice, tender and full of flavor.

Poor recipe. Chicken by itself was fine, but the sour cream and cream of mushroom soup mixture was terrible.  I didn't like the paprika flavor...way too bland.  The whole mixture turned out flavorless and runny, not creamy. I won't make this again.

I really wanted to try this recipe because it has sherry in it. At first glance, the recipe looked a little bland, so I used thighs instead of chicken breast, added seasoning salt, pepper, & garlic powder to it. It was quick to put together & I will be making this again!

I followed another users idea and used fresh mushrooms cooked in butter and white wine instead of using the canned mushrooms. I also used thin cut boneless pork chops. I seasoned the pork before pouring the mix on top.

This recipe is great as is.  The last time I made it, I did tweak it a little. I added some paprika to the sauce, increased the sherry by half and used fresh mushrooms sauteed in white wine instead of the canned mushrooms.  My husband isn't a huge mushroom fan but he loves this recipe.

If its not fried chicken hubby couldn’t care less. But he does like the mushrooms, sherry, and sour cream gig so this didn’t get any complaints. It got great reviews from a pop-in guest that ate 2 pieces. I also used sautéed fresh mushrooms instead of canned because I had some I needed to use. I also sautéed about ¼ cup of chopped onion because other reviewers said it lacked something and I like onions in everything. I used thighs, drumsticks and the breasts, (hubby and guest prefer the dark meat.) I gave the pieces a big dose of seasoning salt and about ½ of the paprika before pouring on the sauce. Personally, I probably won’t make this again. It was okay but not scrumptous. Elegant gourmet name, browns up nicely and looks tasty though.

It was definitely an easy chicken dish but it lacked something. I had to really salt it. We did like the sherry in it though. I will make it again but will season it a little better next time.

The sauce was good but not over the top. I've read some of the reviews, and there are good suggestions for how to spice it up. I'll try some of those suggestions next time.

When I tasted this at the end, I thought it needed some extra flavor (thus the 4 stars as I made it to recipe except for the mushrooms which I did not have on hand) so I added a little cream cheese, bacon bits and some Mrs. Dash Original seasoning.  It then tasted 5 star.  Thanks for a good basic, easy recipe Sandra!

It was good; I used skinless chicken thighs instead; I didn't have cooking sherry so I substituted it with red cooking wine. I added an onion and a beef cube and I put in in a crock pot. It was very tender and tasty

Used fig balsamic vinegar.  Good flavor, but not explosive as I'd hoped.

Good recipe for a starter but I changed it up some. First, I rubbed the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder then browned both sides in about a tablespoon of olive oil, removing from pan to a baking dish. I then added 2 minced garlic cloves, subbed fresh mushrooms sautéed in butter and the sherry instead of cream of mushroom soup and cooked to the desired done-ness and added a little more sherry, thyme and rosemary to taste for flavor, then added 1/3 cup half and half to the pan thoroughly mixing the ingredients. I added the sour cream to give it more texture and bite, salt and pepper. I poured the mushroom mixture over the chicken, sprinkled the paprika over the whole thing and cooked according to directions. I put a little fresh cilantro over the dish when done. It was delicious and I will definitely make it again.

So divine!!  This recipe was simple, elegant, and delicious.  I will most definitely make again!!   My only substitutions were cream of celery soup in place of the mushroom soup and Greek yogurt in place of sour cream.  Thank you so much.

I tried one reviewer's suggestion of cooking in the slow cooker with noodles (added in the last 15 min).  Turned out great! Very tasty.

I didn't have cooking sherry so I used apple cider and water. It may have been a little more flavorful with the sherry. I also used tenderloins instead of bone-in breasts. I also used fat free sour cream. It was good, but not sure I'll make it again.

Made recipe exactly as written; tasted dull.  If I decided to try it again I would add minimum salt and pepper.  Maybe thyme, etc.  This recipe is good for a beginner.

Changed breasts to boneless thighs, which I browned in EVOO.  Added sliced garlic and scallions, simmer until fragrant.  Added rest of ingredients,  except used smoked paprika.  Family really liked the dish.

The sherry is essential to the sauce flavour.  We used boneless chicken breasts.   Served with Baked Brown Rice from this site and all loved it.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks

My mother used to make this when I was growing up in the 70's and I still do several times a year. It's a staple here in our house. So yummy! I use boneless/skinless breasts and I also add a little dried minced onion, chopped garlic and use white wine, or sherry, depending on what I have around. I serve it with rice, as I like it better with rice than I do with pasta.  So good! It's even great as leftovers for lunch.

I used fresh mushrooms, mushroom stock, white wine and added heavy cream in lieu of the bland mushroom soup. It made a flavorful dish and the chicken was  tender.

WHile I dont usually care for recipes made with soup, this one was great. Very tender chicken, great flavor. I suspect it would be great in a crock pot as well...
