Once you make this, just once, you will convince yourself to never buy canned again. After reading what additives are in most (even organic) canned coconut milk, I decided to try this. Apart from being terrific on its own, it also suits your needs for making and cooking. Simply adjust the water to coconut ratio for your needs (less water=creamier/thicker=coconut cream). For baking, I leave in some of the pulp, otherwise I dehydrate the pulp for use in pie crusts and cakes. This recipe is a win/win/win situation: no additives, adjust to your needs, no waste. Really, tell me why to buy canned? Thank you for your recipe.
