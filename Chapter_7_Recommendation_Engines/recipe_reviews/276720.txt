Great recipe and full of flavor. A bit of prep beforehand. Have your veggies and chicken chopped, and your spices pre-measured in advance. I didn't have peanut oil, so used grape seed oil. I microwaved my peeled, chopped sweet potato a bit before adding it to the liquid mix, to be sure it ended up being thoroughly cooked.  I used chunky peanut butter and skipped the extra nuts. I didn't have fresh collards, so used a handful of turnip greens from can, and squeezed out the excess liquid between paper towels. Worked just fine and gave it color. Next time will try fresh collards, but would probably microwave them in advance as well, to be sure they get cooked enough in the process.  Served over 90 second garden rice and it made for a very nice meal.

Saw this recipe and made it with the ingredients I had at home.  I did not have fresh ginger so I used a teaspoon of dry ginger.  I did not have the red peppers and did not substitute anything for them.  I used one freezer bag of chopped spinach because I didn't have collard greens.  This was delicious!.  I would not change an ingredient if I didn't have to.  Flavors are warm and spectacular.  I cannot wait for leftovers tomorrow.

Really tasty! Easy to assemble—great instructions. I used kale and husband said I could put more germs in. I used more sheet potatoes. I thought the red peppers would overwhelm but they didn’t. I usually cut everything ahead of time but the timing was right for me to cut as I went along. Really good ratio of broth to solids.

I did not have peanut oil on hand, so I just used olive oil. I also did not have a can of diced tomatoes, so I used a can of tomato sauce. Also used four  handfuls of fresh  spinach, as I had no collard greens. This recipe is absolutely delicious! Definitely making it again! I too served it over brown rice.

I will be making this again! My husband and I love it. So flavorful. I served it over rice, but it doesnt need rice. I didn't have peanut oil so I used olive oil. Really a great recipe. Thank you!

I made a modified version of this using leftover cooked turkey and without the collard greens (didn't have any), and it was delicious.   I'm not usually a big fan of sweet potatoes as is (I usually make oven fries or casseroles with them) but they work well in this stew, as the flavour mellows in the broth.  I am looking forward to trying this with boneless chicken; I expect it would be even better!

This was great! Hubs loved it, I loved it. I used grated ginger root instead of chopped ginger root.

This was easy and delicious!  I tweaked the recipe due to what I had on hand.  I only used 1 lb of chicken breast and 1 red bell pepper.  I also used a bag of frozen collard greens instead of fresh, as well as olive oil instead of peanut oil and it still turned out amazing!  I have a friend who is married to a man from Ghana and she makes something similar to this all the time.  She serves it with rice so I did the same.  My husband loved it too!
