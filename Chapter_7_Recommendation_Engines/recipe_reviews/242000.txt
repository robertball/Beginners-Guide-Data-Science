yummy! made me wish for summer! I halved the recipe for a 9x9 pan, I used frozen fruit that I defrosted and drained, baking times were spot on for my oven. I halved the sugar to 2 tbsps in crust, 1/2 cup in fruit filling and 2 tbsps in topping and it was plenty sweet for us. Served with vanilla ice cream, cut into 9 largish pieces. Reduced sugar in fruit part to 1/4 cup with all strawberries 02/04/2017

Oh my gosh, were these good!!  I might have used a little more fruit than it called for.  It is hard to get exact measurements when cutting strawberries, etc.  But, wow!  It was delicious.  Everybody loved it and was asking for the recipe.  I will make this one again for sure!

Very good.  I also made them as tarts using preformed tart shells.  Makes a very big batch, I would cut it in half next time for that.  Made over 60 tarts!  :)
