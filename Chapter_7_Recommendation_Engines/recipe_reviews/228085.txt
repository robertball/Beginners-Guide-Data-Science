Very good sauce but doesn't taste like BBQ.  You may need to add honey or something sweet to  get the BBQ effect. Either way, its a very good sauce.

I decided this doesn't taste a lot like typical barbecue sauce, but maybe a little more like chili sauce. I added Smoked Paprika to give it more of a smoky flavor, and I went a bit lighter on the red pepper flakes as some of the reviewers suggested and it came out great. After storing it in a mason jar in the fridge overnight, the flavors blended even better and the heat calmed down a bit. I use it to top off meatloaf, on burgers, with chicken, and even in a salad dressing (combine with 2 parts paleo mayo, 1/2 lemon juiced, and 1 part BBQ sauce for creamy Russian dressing)!

Now that is some kick and a punch or two! Definitely add the horseradish, cayenne and pepper flakes 1/4 tsp at a time. I had to use olive oil. Nonetheless, this is a very flavourful sauce. I used it as a dipping sauce and liked it. It was too spicy for the kids, so had to tone it down by adding more broth and then followed the directions in the notes to cook it down more. Definitely worth using on a chicken or beef before cooking and use this to baste while cooking. Thanks sammyc14 for this bold recipe!

Made it. Added liquid smoke and increased vinegar.  Deleted crushed red pepper. Everyone raved at picnic.

This was delicious! Perfectly spicy, I didn't find it to be too spicy at all. It reminds me of a spicy ketchup or a chili sauce. Loved it! It made my Whole30 dinner that much better!

Very spicy! I added honey and pineapple juice until it was sweeter. Still very good, although next time I'll lighten up on the spices!
