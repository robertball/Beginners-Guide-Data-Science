Sooo much flavor!!! We couldn't get enough. Going to use chicken tenders next time so I don't have to beat the chicken and can make more pieces at once.

My whole family loved them and kids asked why I had never made them before! I made sweet potato biscuits as well and drizzled honey over the chicken and biscuits. 
I prepared flour mixture as written, but ended up using half of the flour mixture called for. I dredged in egg mixture once, and it was plenty of batter. I only used 5 eggs and still had egg mixture left. 
Definitely will make this again, but will prepare less flour and egg. I would make more often, except that frying is just so messy!

I cut this recipe in half and there was more than enough marinade and egg mixture for more chicken.  The flavor was very nice although I did have some trouble with the batter / coating coming off while frying.  I used some chicken strips I had on hand and did not pound them flat.  Served with mashed potatoes, chicken gravy and steamed carrots.

Family loved this chicken!  I used chicken tenders, and they came out really great.  Some people may have issue with the batter staying on, but I've found that if you let the chicken rest for a few minutes with the batter on, it will stick much better.  I didn't use a whole quart of buttermilk, I just eyeballed how much I would need to cover the tenders in a freezer bag, and then just put all the ingredients right into the bag, no need to dirty a bowl!  After letting the chicken marinade (I so far have only done it for a few hours), I just ran my fingers down the tender to get most of the buttermilk off, and then it was straight into the flour, which I seasoned with garlic salt, onion salt, pepper, and some chili powder.  Then dipped into the egg, and into the seasoned flour where i really pressed the bread crumbs into the chicken.  I flipped the chicken, really pressed it again, and then set it aside to rest for a few.  Everyone loved them!   I served them with the Country Sausage Gravy recipe and people went nuts!

This recipe was really good and definitely a keeper! Next time, I will probably add some seasoning into the flour mixture as well for some extra favor. The buttermilk marinade made the chicken turn out really moist and flavorful. Someone mentioned having a hard time with getting the breading to stick. If you let the chicken sit the first 2 minutes on each side while frying without touching it, the breading will stay on just fine.

I used 2 half breasts and one full cut in half. I pounded them flat and then soaked for about 8 hours in the buttermilk mixture, except I used soured milk. 

Then I followed the breading directions using 2 eggs and 1 cup flour with the seasonings. I added red pepper flakes because I like it with a touch of heat.

Letting them rest on a cooling rack while the fat heated helps the coating stick. (I added some butter to the fat for flavor.)

Frying for 2-3 minutes per side was perfect. I kept them on the rack while I cooked the rest.

I served these with milk gravy made with 1.5 cups of milk. The amount came out perfectly,

Three adults and two small children ate every bite. The kids asked for seconds. I think this is just the way Mom and Grandma made this old fashioned dish. It was yummy.

Followed the recipe as is and this was so good! I only had 4 hours to let the chicken marinate too, I imagine this taste even better after marinating over night.

It may seem like too much flour or egg, but you need it to cover all the pieces thoroughly. I use shortening instead of oil as I hate the greasy smell left by vegetable or corn oil.

This was just lovely. My first time making country fried chicken so a lot of it was new to me. I was not prepared for how big smashed chicken would get.
