I had one Pepperidge Farm® Puff Pastry in the freezer to use and a half pound of taco meat in the freezer.  This was a delicious meal to make with the two of them. After making the 4 foldovers, they only took about 17 minutes to bake and brown.  I did let them rest about 8 minutes before plating them.  Served with lettuce, tomatoes, green onions, sour cream, jalapeños and fresh salsa.  A very nice alternative to a taco shell.

This was pretty good.  I could not eat a whole lot of it but I liked it and will make again.  My husband enjoyed it a lot.

Instead of puff pastry, I used a can of whomp biscuits. I also used a homemade dry taco seasoning mix. This took around fifteen minutes to bake using refrigerated biscuits. I served this with mexican rice and refried beans. The boys really liked it.
