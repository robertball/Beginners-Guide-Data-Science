This was absolutely delicious.  I used fresh cubed sweet potatoes and baked for over an hour...added some extra orange juice (used the juice from one orange) and cut the sugar back to about 2/3 cup and it was still plenty sweet.  Love it!!!

This was a wonderful dish and everyone loved it!  The changes I made were adding more spice:  1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. fresh grated nutmeg and 1/4 tsp mace.  I also cooked fresh yams instead of canned, so much nicer!

Made this last Thanksgiving but only half the recipe.
 since the family doesn't really like sweet potatoes.  It was gone before it made it half way around the table so this year, I am doubling the recipe

Made this dish for family and also for a Thanksgiving dinner at work, but substituted a can of chunk pineapple for the orange. It is delicious - both tangy and sweet.  Got several requests for copies of the recipe.

Excellent. Fulfills my requirements of simple ingredients, easy to do and tasty.  I leave out the pecans for my allergic spouse. I also bake fresh yams ahead of time and use them.

I brought it to a Thanksgiving dinner. It was a real hit. I used half the sugar that the recipe called for and used fresh sweet potatoes.

This recipe turned out so good.  The cranberries really gave it an extra flavor that I liked.  It will be a favorite recipe added to my Thanksgiving and Christmas menu.

This was great!  I added brown rice and pork and it turned out great.  Had to add some chicken stock of course.

Looks terrible, tastes wonderful. Don't skimp on the pecans because that's what brought the dish together! Lots of great flavor :)

I used fresh sweet potatoes and omitted pecans. I was kind of surprised at just how much we loved it!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was a big hit with people who like yams (which I didn't realize was a small number in our family, but that's okay!). This is one of those dishes that proves my old adage: "Put enough fat or sugar in something and it will taste good." In this case, it's a super  sweet, flavorful dish with the orange slices and real cranberries, and if it had a crust, it would be sweet enough to be a pie.  Scrumptious. I think this dish and so many delicious others are the reasons we only eat these things on special occasions--and diet the rest of the year. :)
