SUPERB!! I tried this recipe because I needed to make two cakes as gifts right away. Very moist!! The first time I made this it was crumbly and a bit greasy. I modified it to just 1 cup of oil,  added 1 tsp real vanilla extract and  scaled back to just 1 cup raisins. Blend (not stir) the first 4 ingredients then beat mixture for 1 minute after adding each egg, it makes a great difference in the texture. For the "nutty" taste I folded in 1 cup walnuts with the raisins.  Pour on a warm buttermilk or creamcheese glaze and YUMMMM!!! I have made it 3 times since and it is quickly becoming a favorite!

Very good with a few modifications. I halved the recipe as I only wanted 1 cake. As per another review, I only used 1/2 cup oil added walnuts. I also used brown sugar instead of white, added 1/2 tsp baking powder. Next time I will try adding some more carrot and spices to it, and even less oil (I can't handle too much oil). I baked this in mini-bundt muffin pans to serve as individual desserts and only modified the baking time to 22mins. They looked lovely.

Great recipe. I halved the recipe and made 6 4-inch mini cakes to give away as gifts. I added nutmeg, cloves and ginger, and also threw in some sliced almonds that I needed to use up. This cake is not too sweet, which I really like since my cream cheese frosting recipe is pretty sweet. Next time I might substitute applesauce for half the oil since it was a bit oily, but that's the only change I might make.

Wow! Have to say this was really good. Very moist and flavorful. Used no-sugar applesauce, half brown sugar half white, and walnuts instead of raisens. The carrot, pineapple and nuts give it a really nice (and slightly colorful) texture. Made it for my husband's birthday - carrot is his favorite - and will definitely make it again!

Too oily and heavy for my liking. If you don't use bundt pans you can use 1 9x13 and 1 9x9 (just cook for 5-10 minutes longer)

This is a moist and fluffy carrot cake.  I was looking for something more dense, but this is good. Boyfriend said it's the best cake I ever made. Instead of 1 cu of raisins, I put in 1 cu of crushed walnuts. Next time I'll put in 1/2 cu more. I also followed a users comment and cut the oil to 1 cu. Did anyone taste the baking powder like I did? That's my only complaint.

This was a delicious carrot cake but I don't understand why the word "nutty" is in the description since there are no nuts in it. I'm sure you could add them, though. I think it calls for too much sugar especially with the pineapple so I  reduced the amount to half. Plenty sweet enough. Thanks for a great recipe:o)

I made this cake for my daughter's birthday this week-end. She loves carrot cake but this was by FAR the best recipe we have ever tried. Absolutely perfect, moist and flavorful. Still getting raves and requests for the recipe! I wouldn't change a thing!

BEST CAKE EVER. At least according to a few of the guests at the party at which I served this cake. This thing is mind-blowing. You've got to try it to believe. I did cut down the oil to about 1 cup (instead of 1.5) and added a few pecans and walnuts. For those of you who like raisins, those are another fabulous addition. Use cream cheese frosting for best results. ;)

If you like carrot cake with "stuff" in it, then this recipe is for you. The pineapple, shredded carrot, and raisins make this cake more like a fruit cake. It's the best carrot cake recipe I've ever found, and it's easy. My 10-year-old daughter made it for my birthday. We used a standard round pan instead of a Bundt pan.

Made this for my wife's birthday. Everyone said it was the best cake they ever had. My mother asked where I got the recipe. I made a double layer (two round pans) version and halved everything. Scaled back on the rasins and made a homemade cream cheese icing. I think the pineapple and the rasins definately kept it moist. Baked the double pans at 360 for about 35 or 37 mins. Will for sure be making again!

This was incredible!  Thank you!  I did as you mentioned about halving the recipe and that was perfect for us.  Also I reduced the oil and sugar by about 1/3 each, and added pecans that I happened to have on-hand.  I'm going to try reducing the fat/calories by more the next time I make it, so I will have less guilt eating it! ;)  I had a recipe for the frosting I made for it... 1/2 block lowfat cream cheese softened, 2 T. margarine softened, 1 t. vanilla, and 2 c. confectioners sugar.  Mix well and frost.  Mmmm!

I left out the rasins and replaced them with chopped walnuts, and the cakes turned out beautifully. 
These were the first scratch cakes I have ever made, and they were the bomb.

This was the best carrot cake i've ever eaten!  I halved the recipe and it still made a large cake.  I also added walnuts.  Even the people who normally don't like carrot cake were impressed with how yummy it tasted.  This recipe is a KEEPER!

This is fantastic!  I used half raisins and half walnuts.  I used a glaze from a pumpkin cake recipe on this site.  My friend had requested a carrot cake for her birthday, so I made this cake.  Everyone loved it!

This is sooo good!  I didn't use raisins as we're not big raisin fans.  I was going to put walnuts in but forgot...next time.  I used the whipped cream cream cheese frosting from this site, submitted by Tom--very highly recommend.

I made some of the changes the other reviewers suggested - applesauce, more spices ect. I gave it a 3 because the pineapple really threw me off. It felt like it should have been a tropical treat with coconut and banana instead of a carrot cake. I think I'll like it much better without the pineapple.

I don't know how the original tastes but we made muffins with the following changes and my kids are scarfing them down.

I halved the recipe
Substituted applesauce for the oil
Used 1 c sucanat organic natural sugar instead of white sugar
used whole wheat flour instead of white
omitted the raisins (as my kids can't eat these yet)
tossed in a couple tablespoons flax seed meal
Baked for 15 minutes.
This will be a great healthy breakfast or lunch snack.  I don't know how it will keep after a day or so but coming out of the oven they sure are yummy

This recipe was great. A week after I made it, we went to my sister inlaws and she purchased a carrot cake from a local bakery. My boys and my Husband said mine was much better.  Thank you for the recipe.

Very moist! The first time I made the cake (4/23/09), I did as directed except I cut the recipe in half. On 7/3/09, no crushed pineapple in the house so used pineapple "tidbits". Call the results an 'error in progress' because cake was too dry. Lesson well learned.

When my mom requested that I bring carrot cake to Easter dinner, I started searching. Since I don't have cake pans, but do have a bundt, this was perfect.   I halved the recipe, and omitted the nutmeg (no one in my family cares for it).   FANTASTIC carrot cake. Moist and flavorful, even through the following week... not that it lasted all that long!

If you are on the hunt down for the PERFECT carrot cake, your search is over.  I decreased the oil to 1 cup, reduced pineapple to 20 oz,added 10 oz applesauce, 1 cup chopped pecans.  Reduced white flour to one cup and added 2 cups whole wheat flour. Added 1/4 tsp vanilla.    Frosted with 16 oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup butter, 1 tsp Vanilla and 4 cups confectioners sugar.   Oh, mama, this is good.

I made this for a birthday party a while back and everyone was in love. There wasn't a piece left. I didn't use as much oil and omitted the raisins because some people didn't like them. Made a cream cheese frosting (that ended up like a glaze-I don't know what I did-this is why I rarely bake) but it went perfect with this. I will never enjoy another carrot cake. **Not fluffy like most cakes!** Hands down, the best dessert ever!

I found that this cake came out too soft and oily for my taste. In hindsight I should have added a bit more flour and reduced the amount of oil even more than I did.  I will say that the flavors in the cake were nice. I will make it again but will tweak it next time.

OMG!  This is a keeper! This is now my official carrot cake when I make it.  SOOO moist with a crisp top.  I halved the recipe since I only needed one round 9" cake to make the Eater bunny in the video on this site.  The only think I changed was the sugar.  I only had light brown sugar in the house so I used that instead of white. I'm sure it's just as good with white, I'll try that next time!

If you like spiced type of cake, you'll like this and it's a  great addition to your holiday festivities.  I have a favorite carrot cake already but this recipe needed a picture.  Overall, it was good; I left out the raisins, otherwise, no one would've touched it and also reduced the recipe to fit a 9x9.  I topped it with cream cheese frosting and candied carrots.

A huge success!!!  I made carrot cupcakes using this recipe for my twin"s birthday (they go to separate schools) and what a big success!!!  Everyone raved about 'em and are asking for the recipe.  I added a little more of the spices and a tsp of vanilla to the batter and about 1/3 cup more of the raisins.  Topped them with cream cheese frosting. Yum!!!

I made the full recipe and it was enough for a 9 X 13 and a 8 X 8. I followed the recipe exact but added some chocolate chips to the 8 X 8 for the kids. I topped both with a cream cheese frosting. The flavor is good but I found it to be a bit dry which surprised me since so many reviews said it was moist. I guess I possibly cooked it too long but checked it and took it out as soon as a toothpick came out clean from the center. I consider it okay but not fantastic. I'm still going to look for my "go to" recipe for banana cake.

These were great, moist and  healthy. To make them more lowfat I pureed a drained can of great northern beans to replace the oil.  And to use less sugar I added 1 ripe banana and 1/2 cup of applesauce for half of the sugar. I also increased the (whole wheat) flour and cooking time to make up for added moisture .

REDUCED SUGAR VERSION:  I replaced the white sugar with a splenda mix, reduced the oil by 1/2 cup, added a 1/2 teaspoon allspice.  (I wanted to use applesauce, but I didn't have any.)  I baked the cake in two 9" rounds for ~30-35min then frosted it with a (store-bought) reduced sugar cream cheese frosting.  The overall effect was fantastic!  You couldn't tell it was "missing" sugar and the cake was soft and moist without being greasy.  I am not a fan of carrot cake, but I loved it!

I made a few changes: I halved the recipe and used a 9 x 13, used only 1/2 c. oil and 1/2 c. applesauce, substituted br. sugar for white, used half whole wheat, and added a few more spices. My brother-in-law said it was the best carrot cake he'd ever tasted!!

Excellent! My husband went back for seconds.  I added about a tablespoon of grated fresh ginger to the carrots.  Served it with fresh, sliced strawberries. Next time, I will try to make some frosting for it, because this time the cake didn't last long enough to frost!

The only change I made to this recipe is that I scaled back on the oil to only one cup as suggested per other reviewers, and I used individual mini-bundt pans because I was taking this to my boyfriend's family's house for Thanksgiving. The cake was so moist it was actually mooshy, and it was hard to take out of the mini-bundt pans, I had to use a spatula to scrape it off the sides. I tried baking them longer, but it only added to my array of problems. My boyfriend's family said that it was really good, but i think they were just being polite. I personally didn't like it, and I'm not at all picky with my desserts as i have an insatiable sweet tooth. I probably won't be making this again.

I was the hit of dinner with this cake. I mixed the first 4 ingredients & beat in each egg, one at a time, by hand with a wooden spoon.. I sifted all of the dry ingredients, including 1 tsp allspice, 1 tsp ginger, & added them to the wet, stirring by hand until all was incorporated. I added 1 tsp of vanilla. I then folded in the raisins & added 1 1/2 cups of walnut pieces, as well. I used 4 round cake pans & added approximately 2 3/4 cups of batter to each pan, & baked at 350 degrees for 24 to 26 minutes until toothpick came out clean. I did this all by hand because the mixer sometimes adds too much air & will cause the cake to fall when removed from the oven.

I halved the recipe and thought it looked awfully liquidy even before I put it in the oven.  After baking it refused to come out of the pan nicely and I had to cement it together with some of Tom's wonderful whipped cream cheese frosting.  To my surprise--it was absolutely delicious.  Guests just raved.  I'll do it again!

My daughter made this for her boyfriends birthday and it was absolutely delicious. She's not a raisin fan so she subbed with walnuts. The pineapple was a wonderful addition and certainly helped make this cake extremely moist. Great recipe and thank you!!

This was really yummy if you like carrot cake! I actually halfed the recipe. I will not use a bundt pan next time.  I greased the sides well, and it still stuck. The cake is so moist, so I think that is why. I used half whole wheat and half organic unbleached white flours.  I nixed the raisins because I hate them. I added wheat germ and walnuts. Truly, this was extremely tasty. I may try to use this recipe with zucchini next time.

Totally awesome!!! I made my own cream cheese iceing with two packs of cream cheese, one stick of butter and 3- 1/2 cups or so of powder sugar. It made a bunt cake, two mini loafs and six cupcakes! Very moist, wonderful. Definitly a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

My daughter and I made this recipe together. We cut everything by half so we could make just one ten inch round pan cake. We also eliminated raisins and put in pecans in their place. As for the icing we used cream cheese, vanilla and heavy cream. It turned out great!

I have tried this recipe 5 times already and enjoy it very much. The only problem we're having is that it tends to sink when we take it out of the oven, and it's completely done.

THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING!  The only changes I made was switching out 1 of the cups of white sugar with golden brown sugar and added one cup of walnuts.

Very good!!!  Hubby gave it a big thumbs up.  I made half recipe for 1 cake. I didn't have raisins so I substituted 1 yellow delicious apple finely chopped.  I used 1 cup of white and 1 cup of brown sugar & through in 1/2 cup of old fashion oats along with a little extra cinnamon, and 2 - 8oz. cans of crushed pineapple.  I put about a tablespoon of the reserved pineapple juice in the frosting.  Very, very good!

This cake was delicious! I made it for my husband for our anniversary b/c he loves carrot cake and he definately approved! I halfed the recipe, which made 2 layer pans. I added walnuts, and omited the raisins because I don't like them. I went ahead and put in the cinnamon, and instead of the nutmeg, I just put in 1 tsp of pumpkin spice because I already had it, that way I didn't have to buy nutmeg! And it turned out very good! I also frosted it with homemade cream cheese frosting! yuumm! Will definately make this again! Thank you!

Obviously i did something wrong, not sure what, i followed the recipe. It was very soggy and still raw inside. But I'm not sure i would have liked the cake even if i did get the recipe right. Will keep looking.

Very moist although I would have liked it a little sweeter and will add some vanilla next time. Didn't see nuts in the recipe but will add them next time as well. Was the most moist of any carrot cake I have made though.
