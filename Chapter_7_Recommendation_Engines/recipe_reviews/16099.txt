We love this!! After making many times, I have a few adjustments-- we add more beans (usually some kidney), use only 1 1/2 jalapenos, and use 1/2 the olive oil.  Paired with some low-fat tortilla chips, this salad is always a hit.

Mmm, mmm good!  I had to make substitutions since I made this at the spur of the moment and had to use what was handy!  I subbed a can of pintos for garbanzo beans, a can of diced tomatoes with chiles instead of fresh, and basil for the cilantro.  Less oil and more lime juice, just as a personal preference.  I have a girlfriend who makes something similar, only with Italian dressing and this beats hers...no contest.

I made this for a Cinco de Mayo party to serve as one of the salads, and haven't stopped making it since.
I had a neighbor invite us to a last minute pool party and asked if I could bring a munchie. With a half a bowl of leftover Mexican Salad and some tortilla chips this was a huge hit at the party!!
I cannot strongly urge enough however to make this ahead of time, as the longer it sits the better it tastes.
I also have been making this with the new Enova Oil and Agave Nector ( for diabetics), I have used canned corn instead and it is still an awesome flavored side dish or dip.  You can't mess this recipe up, just alter it to your tastes.
This is now a summertime staple at our home!(nah- probably all year round)
Keep up the great recipes Pam!

A little too sweet for us.  We prefer the flavors in Black Bean and Corn Salad II.

This is a nice variation on salsa and chips.  Mix it vigorously to slightly mash the beans and make the dip stick together better.  I'm looking forward to serving this during the summer.

Delicious and beautiful to look at! I used more Romas (five) and much more cilantro (my fav!). I also reduced the amount of olive oil in the dressing but increased the amount of lime juice. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! Followed the recipe exactly and couldn't be happier. Cannot wait to make this again. Really like the hint of heat that the jalapenos provided. Quick and easy. I also used canned corn instead of frozen.

This was very good. I went lighter on the onion--I used half a shallot and one green onion. Plus, I used fresh, raw corn and about 1/4 cup cilantro. This had a nice, mellow flavor, and I didn't find it too spicy at all. Next time, I'll add garlic and maybe a bit of cumin.

Followed the recipe exactly (except for the jalapenos - only bc I didn't have any, though I bet they would have been good) and was pleasantly surprised.  Will definitely make again.  Nice side to any Mexican entree!

As written, this isn't a very flavorful salad. My fiance didn't like it one bit and I thought it was just okay. I wish I hadn't put in the honey, as I ended up using a ton more lime juice for more acidity. After adding cumin, garlic powder, and lots more cilantro it was much better. The only thing I changed was to use yellow bell pepper instead of red, due to what I had on hand. Thanks, but there are better recipes on this site for similar salads.

Very good side dish for our chicken fajitas!  I added a can of pinto beans as well, also more cilanto and some minced garlic.  Followed another reviewer and used less oil, more lime juice.  Would make a nice dip with corn chips too.

YUM!  Made this for a shower, and everyone wanted the recipe.  I ate the leftovers for a couple of days, then thought I'd change it up a bit and added rainbow pasta, black olives, and shredded cheese.  It was a yummy pasta salad as well!!!

DELICIOUS!  What a great salad.  DH who isn't a fan of beans even enjoyed this.  Didn't have a red pepper, so used 1/2 yellow and 1/2 green.  Omitted the jalapenos and honey.   Great recipe!

Another recipe my picky husband liked!  I used canned corn because that's what I had and it had a funky smell (as canned corn does), but it didn't taste that way.  Overall, a nice change in side dishes for Mexican foods from my usual chips and salsa.

I love this recipe!  So simple and so delicious.  I was missing a few ingredients, but it still turned out fantastic.  

I replaced chick peas with garbanzo beans (which might actually be the same thing...??) and I didn't have any honey - leaving it out and pumping up the lime and cilantro gave it a very light fresh taste.  

I will definitely keep this one in my recipe box.

thanks for sharing

The recipe as is, I rated 3 stars as I found the honey made it too sweet and I was looking for more of an herb and kick flavour.

To change it up this is what I do. In small saucepan combine one cup apple cider vinegar, 1/2 cup canola oil, 1/4 cup sugar, 2-3 dashes each of garlic or table salt, and pepper.  Gently boil for 5 minutes, remove from heat and set aside to cool.

Drain and rinse one can each of black beans, chick peas and niblet corn and add to a very large mixing bowl. Finely dice one cup each of celery, red pepper, green pepper, sweet onion and cauliflower (yes cauliflower).  Add to bowl.

Pour the cooled brine all over your canned and diced veggies and mix thoroughly.  Add 2-3 dashes garlic powder and dried basil (or Italian seasoning), and  mix again.  Refrigerate at least 6 hours or overnight for best results.

Serve as a salad, or as an appetizer together with Tostito multi-grain scoops.  It makes a lot but keeps for up to a week in the refrigerator.  A real crowd pleaser any time of the year!

Tip:  I have experimented with different vinegars such as cider, red wine and balsamic, but the 'apple cider' wins hands down.  The cauliflower may not appeal to some but if finely diced, you don't even know it's there and gives it a nice crunch.

Very delicious and colorful salad that everyone thoroughly enjoyed . I have made this several times and it is a very forgiving recipe, you can add different beans and it is still tasty. This is definitely a regular in our home! Thanks Karen for sharing!

This was excellent.  I added less oil and more lime juice.  I doubled the recipe, but double the amount of corn seemed too much, so I only used 24 oz.  I added another tomato, just because I like it.  Delicious!

I have made this salad a couple of times for parties and each time everyone raves about it. It's a nice change from  potato or macaroni salad. Add a little cumin for some more flavor. Thanks for sharing this recipe Pam.

What a fresh tasting salad/dip that is both attractive and healthy.  I used three small roma tomatoes, a big bunch of cilantro, less oil and more lime and honey.  I will definitely be making this again!

Very good combination of ingredients. I suggest doubling the amount of cilantro and tomato, cutting out a little of the olive oil and adding an additional TB of lime juice. I also use fresh corn, a chopped avocado, and a minced clove of garlic. If you feel that it is bland, you may need to add a little more salt to bring out the flavors, but if you're using good quality ingredients to begin with, you should get good results.

This was so disappointing.  I cannot understand the good reviews on this one.  The dressing was overly oily and bland...not near enough lime juice.  I was worried when I was making it that olive oil is such a heavy oil for a salad and I was right...a light vegetable oil might have helped.  Maybe it is because I live in San Antonio, grew up in Texas eating mexican food...but this was just not flavorful and did not have any kick or spice to it.  I followed the recipe exactly and served this at a party as a side dish to pork tacos and fajitas.  Almost the entire bowl was left and I ended up dumping it the next day.  Sorry.  I'll stick to traditional black bean/corn salads from now on.

Given that  I was only making a scaled down version for  Hubs and me,  I used just black beans.  While I would have liked to have included the garbanzo beans, it wasn't practical for me to have two half open cans of beans in the fridge.  Where this called for onions, I chose to use red, which  is sweeter and milder than white or yellow onions.  I skipped the honey and substituted parsley for the cilantro, only because again, it wasn't practical for me to buy cilantro when I needed such a small amount.  Once I mixed this up it was clear it cried out for something green.  I considered throwing in some green pepper, but since it already had red pepper in it I thought some chopped baby cucumbers was a refreshing  choice.  Due to Hubs' sensitive innards I cut back on the jalapeno, but that's strictly a matter of taste  - and how hot your jalapeno is to begin with!  I loved the dressing , which was light, balanced and refreshing, and I appreciated the omission of the garlic and cumin you could commonly see used here.  As this type of Mexican bean salad goes, this is one of the better ones I've tried.

I've been looking for non lettuce salads now that we are in for 100 degree days for the next three mos. I like having something in the fridge for easy lunches, this made a lot and I'll probably be the only one that will eat it so i left out tomato. Will add as i eat it since it can get mushy when in fridge to long. I also didn't add honey because i never use it. And used green onion because it's what i had. Will also be good with some avocado. Thanks

I did find that this recipe was a little bland for my taste. I added white beans, used fresh corn off the cob (sauted in garlic and shallots, olive oil, salt and pepper) kicked up the spices a bit and used less olive oil. I will definitely make this again with the adjustments!

I bring this often to barbecues and it never fails to impress! Goes well with burgers and is a healthy alternative to mayo based side dishes. It might just be me, but I have found that this salad doesn't look or taste as good after leaving overnight in the fridge. I usually make it a few hours ahead of time though and it's perfect!

This was good, rated a 4 rather than a 5 because it's the first corn salad I've made and want to try other recipes out there.  Not as good as some I've had at restruants, but that's to be expected.

This was delicious and very simple to make. I skipped the jalapeno peppers and olive oil, but increased the honey to aprox. 1/2 cup. It was a huge hit at our family reunion. Highly recommended.

This was okay, but not spectacular in my opinion.  It was better as a dip than what I would consider to be a "salad".  So if you are looking for a salsa for chips, this may work for you.  If you are looking for a stand alone side dish, you may want to check out something else.

We grilled fresh corn and cut off the kernals.  2 tbls. olive oil (as another review suggested) instead of 1/4 c.  We added avocado right before we served it.  This dish was a hit!  We've served it as both a salsa and a side dish.

Very good - but I thought 1/2 cup olive oil is too much.  1/4 cup was much better.  And because I LOVE lime juice - I used 4 TBSP - and next time I will even use more. I'm also a big fan of fresh corn (in season) - and 3 ears was the perfect amount.

This salad was great! I made it the night before hoping it would taste better the next day, but I don't think that would make much of a difference - I would just chill it long enough for it to get cold. I love all the different colors in it. So simple!

Wonderful salad! I added an avocado, and halved the amount of oil.  I also only let it sit for about 20 minutes (due to poor timing) and it was very tasty.

This was just okay. I cut this in half and used only black beans. I also omitted the jalepenos because I was feeding little mouths. It's just a bit bland. It's missing something that I just can't place. It was better mixed with crumbled cornbread. I'd make this again and try to place what this salad needs. It's a good start.

I'm a novice cook, so take my opinion for what its worth.  First off, my wife asked my to try making some sort of mexican salad.  This one was rated high, so I put it on my shopping list after browsing it briefly and kind of forgot about it.  When I went to make it later that week, I thought, "Where's the lettuce?  This is a salad right?"  So, I double checked the recipe and saw that there were no greens in it.  I thought it sounded odd, and I didn't think I'd like it, but I gave it a try anyway.  I'm so glad I did.  It was excellent and very easy.  I'm definitely going to make this again.  I loved the subtle sweetness of it.

I can't give it a five only bc I didn't actually follow this recipe but I used it as a guide last night.  A great salad for a hot day.  I microwaved the corn for about 2 1/2 minutes to bring it to room temp.  I also didn't use as much olive oil & used about 6 gloves of fresh garlic, 1 1/2 limes and later I added grounded cumin, cayenne & oregano.  I tasted the salad as I went along.  I probably ended up using a tablespoon of salt.  I also grilled 2 spears of zucchinis & 2 anehiem  peppers.  I topped the salad with avocado.  Yummy!

It's a good, healthy recipe.  There seemed to be a lot of beans though -- maybe add some more tomatoes?

We loved this (esp. Hub). Didn't use honey, as we're not fans of sweet. We added chicken, Cuz wanted to make a main dish. I love to cook chicken, and then use leftovers. We even dice and freeze, which I used. The different flavors that came through in this were great. Will make again, and highly recommend. Thanks for sharing!

I doubled the recipe because I was feeding a large group. The dressing did not complement the salad. It seemed to be missing something. The flavor was just ok, but not great.

This is a very tasteful and filling recipe. The only changes I made were reducing the amount of corn by 1 can and adding an extra can of black beans. I will be making this again, it was so delicious.

A little on the bland side. Followed the instructions and salad was bland. I will make this again, however, I will look at spicing it up as it is lacking something. Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe, divided ingredients by 3 so I could just use one can of mixed beans (just me and my hubby so that is plenty) tastes really nice especially after sitting a while...even my picky hubby liked it.

I halved the recipe and used one can of red kidney beans. I also added some peeled and chopped cucumber. In place of the jalapenos, I used a few shakes of red pepper flakes. To me, this recipe didn't have much flavor. To remedy that and for my own taste preferences, I also added garlic and onion powders. Big improvement.

Will make again. Rating 4 stars because I modified slightly. I did not add jalapenos or green pepper or tomato - instead I used a can of Rotel w/chilies. Did not use corn because I didn't have any. And omitted the honey as I didn't think my family would want the sweetness. Very good - there were no leftovers.

I enjoyed it okay, my family did not.  I did think it could use more flavor in some way, but not sure how.  Maybe some sort of Mexican type spice and definitely more lemon/lime juices.

This recipe was okay, it was a little bland and needed more flavor. We added in avocado and green + red pepper. It's a good base and will probably play with it some before moving on....

Yummy! Of course I love chickpeas and black beans, they are so good and good for you. I did change one thing, I halved the olive oil. 1/2 cup just seemed heavy for me, and I don't personally like heavy dressings or much oil on my salads. Other than that I followed the receipe as written and I thought was great. I served it with corn tortilla chips on the side and both disappeared.

Nice basic recipe, but a bit on the sweet/bland side.  More lime juice, less olive oil (about 1/4 to 1/4 C of each).  Made the dressing in a small bowl, but kicked it up with a clove of finely minced garlic, a big pinch of cumin, some fresh minced oregano, s & p to taste, and no sweetening.  Then added the dressing to the salad and tossed, tasted for seasonings, and tossed again. Used red onion for taste and color.

Very Yummy! Next time I will use more jalapenos. I used jarred and not fresh, that may have made the difference. But even after 6 tspns I still didn't find it had enough of a kick. Otherwise, very tasty

This was a wonderful salad. Fresh and light for summer. I added avocado, extra cilantro from my garden, and next time will add more heat with an additional hot peppers.

I just tried this recipe because I needed something quick to go with the chili and Mexican Cornbread I was preparing for my family's Sunday afternoon get together. It was such a hit that now they all clamor for it on a regular basis. Perfect blend of flavors and so refreshing.

We love this easy to make salad! I bring it to every work or family function and have to give other the recipe before I can leave. The last time we added just a little red wine vinegar for a nice change.

This was such a hit at my Cinco de Mayo party, I didn't even get to taste it. But from what I hear, it was delicious. Thanks for the great, easy recipe. I'll need to put some aside for myself next time.

I made this for a Cinco de Mayo party last week. It was very easy to make (the night before). I can't give personal testimonial as to how good it was, because my guests devoured it before I got to have a taste... So 4 stars because of the compliments I got (may have been 5 stars if I had had some...). Thanks for the recipe!!!
