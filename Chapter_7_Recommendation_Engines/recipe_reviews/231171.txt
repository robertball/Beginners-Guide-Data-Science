This recipe is good but I did make a few changes for my taste! Instead of brown sugar I used Agave nectar which has a lower glycemic index and is also sweeter so you use less of it (for every 1 cup brown sugar you use 2/3 cup agave) and I also added mashed banana to this recipe and used fresh blueberrys as I happened to have some on hand...I definitely recommend everyone looking into agave nectar as a healthier alternative to regular sugar!

This is a great recipe, and I love that it can be made ahead and reheated.  This would be wonderful for a crowd also!  I used a frozen organic mixed berry blend for the fruit.  When serving, I think I'll drizzle a little honey on it just to add a bit more sweetness.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Excellent with blackberries.  If refrigerated, microwave 30 seconds before eating.

Made it "as is" today, including the optional ingredients. I had my first serving when it came out of the oven, and thought, "Meh." The taste was okay, but I wasn't thrilled with the consistency. Well, I put the rest in the fridge, and had a cold serving a little while ago -- WOW! I much prefer it cold; it's delicious that way! Like a dessert, only healthy :) My kids (ages 12 and 14) liked it too, and one of them is VERY picky. I was surprised when the picky one said, "Can you make this every week during the summer?" :) This is a keeper, for sure!

Very easy to make, my kid (2&4)gobbled it up.
I would do a 1/2 portion next time, as it makes a ton.
Great for a bruch too!

This recipe is wonderful. My husband and I both loved it. It's great reheated in the microwave too. I have to eat gluten free so I left out the wheat germ. Next time I'll add walnuts, or pecans or almonds. I've tried other baked oatmeal and this one is the BEST!

Trying to get more oatmeal in our diet, I decided to try baked oatmeal.  I'm not sure what I was expecting.....but this is good.  It bakes up like a cake, only is quite heavy.  I made it with black raspberries rather than the blueberries as they are my DH's favorite.  I heated my piece in a bowl and added milk and DH heated his and added some butter.  I halved the recipe and it made an 11 x 7 pan.  It is a nice alternative to cooked oatmeal that I would make once in a while.

My hubby and I love this. It's easy to reheat and eat on your morning commute. I always add different fruits and nuts to change the flavor somewhat. This time I'm using Cherries ans Almonds. Yum!. I would recommend it be baked a little longer than the recipe states. Mine is always too wet still. I usually bake 45 min at least. Now, if I could get the kids to eat it. Maybe spread Nutella on top?

I think I make it different each time I make it. I usually only use 3 eggs especially if I use flax.  Also less frozen fruit - 1 to 1 1/2 cups and less brown sugar - 3/4 cup.   I have tried all berries, apples , peaches, rhubarb,  raisins, and nuts. Mine usually ends up dry but I always heat it with milk.    I also use barley and/or wheat flakes rather than oats or combination.   Mix it up.  Enjoy

I've been trying to eat better and tweak recipes at the same time. I made this last night, and had some fresh out of the oven and some this morning as well and enjoyed both ways! It definitely wasn't sweet but that can be played with. I doubt it's sweet enough for my daughter but I'll revise this review when I've "teen-tested" this recipe. It'd be a great afternoon snack. I only used 1/2c brown sugar and added 1/4 tsp of stevia. Next time I'll try 1/2tsp of stevia to see if I like better. I didn't have any milk so I used equal parts water and condensed milk in place of the milk. I didn't have the "optional" ingredients but I added about 1/2 a cup each of roasted no salt sunflower seeds, dried cranberries and sliced almonds. Very tasty!! I think I'm addicted. Thanks for sharing this recipe! One last thing... are "old fashioned oats" the same as rolled oats"?? All my grocery had was old fashioned oats or instant.

Delicious! I used coconut milk and it was amazing - also added a sliced banana. I will definitely be making this again.

This is quite good and much healthier than most baked oatmeal recipes. However, it was a bit dry so I added a pat of butter and some milk to each serving. Next time, I will add melted butter into the mix.

To me, it was good enough to make again, but I would want to add something... maybe a pinch more salt, and some nutmeg?  It just seemed to be missing that "spark", though it definitely has potential. The only changes I made was to use two ripe mashed bananas (we were out of applesauce), an additional cup of fresh blueberries and whole milk. It did taste a lot better with half-and-half on it.  3 of four kids voted "keep, but only if we can have half-and-half on it", otherwise it was also kind of blah.

It is just what I wanted, and feels so healthy. I want to have it for breakfast with milk heated in the microwave. Now I have seen some variations I will try those also. Thanks for this recipe.

Made this thinking it would be good for weekday breakfast on the go.  It was fantastic!  I followed the recipe pretty closely- used unsweetened coconut milk instead of dairy, just because that's what I had on hand.  Did not add the flax or wheat germ.  used a mix of blueberries and blackberries.  My daughter came in as I was taking it out of the oven and had a piece while it was still warm. She loved it so much that she asked if we could make it for her birthday cake.  I would say it was a giant hit.  Oh, and it was perfect for breakfasts.  I cut it into squares and bagged them individually so I could grab one on my way out the door.  Perfect!

this has become a staple in our house!!  I make it every 2 weeks.  It is excellent just the way it is, or you can add soft banana or apple and butter, drizzle  honey over the top if you  like it sweeter.   Especially excellent warm, fresh from the oven.
The only note I would add, if you are using stoneware to bake, you have to adjust the baking time, and takes slightly longer.

Very good, we all liked it, including the kids. I served warm, with a drizzle of honey, fresh blueberries (instead of baked in) and some milk on top. Will make again.
