This was super! ....moist, flavorful, hearty, and relatively healthy. First of all, I did not use Guinness. I had a Smithwick's on hand so I had to make the best of it. I did not have buttermilk so I used 1 Tbsp of lemon juice mixed with 1c milk and let it sit for 5 min. I used splenda brown sugar mix, light butter, and baked it in an 8x6 pan for ten minutes less than stated. It was perfect and just may have to replace my go-to beer bread recipe from this site (whole wheat beer bread). Loved this this one had oats. Also, I wasn't expecting it to be as sweet as it was and may decrease the sugar next time. Although my sweet tooth can't complain. Thank you for the recipe!

This bread was awesome. I doubled the recipe and baked it in loaf pans.  I thought that two loaf pans would overflow, so I put it in three, but when I make it again, I'll do a single recipe in a single loaf pan.  I think that will be perfect.  I too served it with honey butter.  I will definitely make it again.

I have had really good beer bread...but this tops them all and what's even better is that this recipe was so easy I had no problem, whatsoever, following it. I did use quick-cooking steel cut Irish oats in mine and I really like the rustic texture they gave this bread. This bread is sweet, it's savory...altogether delicious...thanks for a great recipe!

Heavy, tasty bread. I was worried the batter was too liquidy, but it turned out great! Sweeter than I was expecting with only 1/2 cup of brown sugar, but I can't wait to have some for breakfast tomorrow :)

Try loaf pan next time.  Oven Temp seems high at 425 then 400 try 350?.  Seemed done after 1/2 hr on outside but inside wasn't entirely done.
03/16/16
I think 350 was too low cuz bread didn't raise much.  Was it the difference in more baking soda than baking powder?  Try 1 tsp baking soda and 2 tbsp baking powder.  I didn't make it in loaf I made it in round 8" and used 3 pans and tried one with some cinnamon (1/2 tsp full recipe)  and raisins (1 C full recipe) Maybe start out 400 for 1st and 375 or 350 for last time.

I've never made bread with beer in it before, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  I will say with no hesitation that we enjoyed this.  The only thing that I did differently was take the bread out of the oven 15 minutes early...it was done.  It is a heavy bread, but has a lighter texture than say brown bread.  It turned out beautifully moist, not too sweet, with just a hint of the Guinness.  It really was delish with butter and honey, but I think this would be equally good with a hot bowl of soup or stew.  Thanks Dolly for introducing me to a fabulous new recipe using beer.

Interesting recipe but I don't think this one is for me. I love Guinness and I don't mind a bitter taste usually, but this one was just a little off for me. It didn't quite taste sweet and it didn't quite taste like Guinness-- it was kind of like drinking OJ after brushing your teeth. The recipe was easy and turned out beautifully, I guess it just isn't for me.

This makes a very hearty bread that is surprisingly versitile.  It goes great with corned beef and cabbage as well as the heartiest of soups.  I have even had it for breakfast, hot and buttered with a dusting of cinnamon.  It is some of the best bread I've made.

My husband and I are seriously addicted to this bread!  I only make one small change when preparing this.  As I don't usually have buttermilk on hand, I use regular milk with 1 Tbs of lemon juice.  Other than that, I follw this recipe exactly.  Quick, easy and flavorful.  My husband loves to eat his plain and I zap mine in the microwave and use a little spray butter with a dusting of sugar.  Quick bread heaven!

I made this from the UK site so I converted all the measurements. Then I found it here! I enjoyed the conversions and figuring out the ingredient substitutions. I loved the nutty taste from the oatmeal, the sweetness from the brown sugar and stout taste of the beer.

Really good!  Instead of melted butter, I cut 1/2 cup cold butter into the flour mixture and baked in a loaf pan 35 minutes at 375, then 40 minutes at 325.  Turned oven off and let set with oven door open another 35 minutes.  Wonderful!

I have had this recipe saved in my box for ages and finally today had the leftover Guinness to make this.  It's a bit too sweet to eat with a savory meal for me, but it's going to make a fantastic breakfast bread.  I couldn't resist having a piece while it was piping hot and spread with a little fresh butter.  YUM!  I had just used the last of my buttermilk and subbed plain greek yogurt, and I used 2 Tbs butter and 2 Tbs grapeseed oil.  I also had to use dark brown sugar.  It didn't matter...it turned out great..crispy edges and a moist interior.  I'll definitely make again, and I will probably try muffins next time.  Thanks, Dolly!

Holy crud this is AWESOME!!! Super easy to make, I thought it was too runny and wouldn't come out, but it was perfect, moist inside with a thick yummy crust. I made a honey cinnamon butter to go on it and everyone RAVED over it!!

Overall not a bad recipe... mine rose nicely and had a good flavor.. i am not sure if it is worth using a bottle of Guinness for... its about $2 a bottle... but the simple basic beer bread is also pretty good... this bread did have a very unique and great flavor though

Made this recipe exactly as written to go with Irish Beef Stew....YUM!  The bread is super moist and slightly sweet but went really well with the stew.  Hubby & I both think it's a keeper!

Mmm, this was crispy and delicious. It was a little bitterer than I'd expected, but that's my own fault. Everyone who tried it loved it.

I have made this bread several times, and it always turns out delicious! It is soft and mildly sweet. I didn't change a thing in the recipe. It is great as a breakfast bread served with honey cinnamon butter.

Interesting bread to say the least. I can say, that it almost smelled like banana bread...not sure why but it did. My family just loved it. I thought it was fine. Very easy to make. I can see adding some fruit along with this the next time I make it. My family has already asked I do so.

This is an excellent soda bread. It is a tad sweet so I might cut the sugar in half next time. It baked much quicker than the advised time. I baked it for 30 minutes at 425 and another 15 minutes at 400 and then removed it from the oven immediately. Any longer and I fear it would have burned or just dried out period. This baking time produced a sweet, tender and moist loaf. YUMMY! Thanks for sharing Dolly!

I didn't have wheat flour, so I used all-purpose. I also substituted light vanilla soy milk and vinegar for the buttermilk. I used Irish steel cut oats and Smart Sense spread instead of butter. I cooked it at 425 F for 15 minutes, then 400 F for 15 minutes, then let it sit in the oven. Despite all these changes, it turned out very well. I think it would have been fine cooking as the recipe states, but I like how it came out--crispy on the outside and tender and chewy on the inside. The flavors were a unique treat for my tongue, and I found myself chewing slowly and really focusing on what I was tasting. I will definitely make this again! Very easy, tasty, and pretty!

I, too, used light margarine and the milk/lemon juice in lieu of buttermilk.  I mixed all the ingredients, put it in the pan in the fridge for a few hours while I ran errands and then came home, topped with oats and baked for an hour without letting it cool (the kids were getting hungry!).  Sooo good!  This recipe is a keeper!

My husband and I loved this bread - so easy to make! I was worried about it being more like a batter than a dough, but it turned out very well. It reminds us of dark bread that you get at anice steakhouse. Thanks!

This bread is AMAZING. A little sweeter than you may expect, almost cake-like, but really good, and I love that it uses wheat flour and oats. I took it to our a St. Paddy's potluck and it vanished. I may give it a shot with a tad less sugar, but this recipe will be a regular in my kitchen. I can't wait to make it again.

This recipe is wonderful as is.  No one in my family is even a huge Guinness fan, but everyone loved it.  Followed the recipe exactly, although next time I might start checking the bread about 10 minutes early on the second cooking time or rotate the dish because the back of the loaf was just starting to burn.  Fit great in a 9x9 Pyrex dish.  This went really well with an Irish stew.  It tastes great with or without honey butter, go with your personal preference on that one.

Yum! Very dense and semi sweet, almost more like a cake than bread. We didn't even put anything on it, just ate chunks while still warm.

I used Raz-ber-rita as the ale in this bread that I spread into a 9"x13" pan.  The baking time was 35 minutes in a 350 oven. I made frosting using butter, Raz-ber-rita,and powdered sugar. Fantastic recipe!  I think this will be a snack rather than a coffee cake type of bread!

Made this bread.  We loved it.  Baked in two loaf pans that together would equal an 8 x 8 inch pan.  Tastes great with butter and honey.

The temp and cooking time seemed off when I started at 425. It started to cook really fast on too. I decided to turn down to 400 after 10 mins. Then at the 30 min mark it was done. I bake a lot and think the temp needs to be 350 and bake 40-45 min. Very good bread. It is more of a quick soft bread like banana bread.

I loved this recipe.  I used another flavor of beer and turned out awesome.  Loved the oatmeal in the bread, gave the bread a very good texture.  Will make this bread again and again.

I made this for a St. Patrick's Day weekend with some friends, and it was a big hit! The only thing I did differently was to bake it in a loaf pan. I also cut some time off the end because it was done and dark at the edges. Even so, it was still very moist. It tasted even better the second and third days. I'll definitely be making this again, and not just for St. Patrick's Day!

This turned out as an excellent beer loaf.  A bit different than expected as to the whole wheat only flour.  Not hard or clumped together at all, almost  cake like and very moist.  I liked the dark texture.  It went well with our corned beef dinner.  The only difference I did, as others suggested, was to use 1/4 cup brown sugar.  This yeilded a hint of sweetness, not overpowering the bread taste.  Baked in an older USA made pyrex pie pan for the round effect.  The odor while cooking filled the house, hard to wait for the meal and bread!
This is my new and only dark bear bread recipe.   Thank you Dolly, my Irish ancestors would say 'Good on ya fer this one."

This bread came as a surprise to me because I really don't care for Guinness beer!  So I bought one bottle and went for it based on the statements by two of my Allrecipes friends.  I'm glad I did!  This is a really delicious breakfast bread.  I baked mine in a 9x5 loaf pan as the recipe calls for with the exception of baking it only about 12 minutes after turning down the heat to 400.  We did as the author suggested and slathered it in butter and honey.  It was a perfect complement to our morning coffee.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good bread, but I personally think it's too sweet to eat alongside an entree.  It makes a better breakfast bread...with honey butter. Very easy to put together and make. I used white whole wheat flour. I cooked it for the allotted 30 minutes at 425 degrees, but only about 10 minutes after turning the oven down to 400.

This wasn't too bad.  I gave it a 4 star only because I didn't think it deserved only 3.  The batter was real runny, but baked up fine.  My worry pouring the batter was that it seemed too much (I used an 8" round pan), so I poured it to nearly the top, and was able to make 4 mid sized muffins with the rest of the batter.  The first round I baked for 25 mins, took out the muffins.. continued baking the round pan for only 20 mins, and left it in the oven for 20.  That was plenty of time in the oven.  I'll probably make this again, and try pouring all the batter in one 8" round, seeing as how it didn't appear the batter spilled over while baking.

This is possibly the BEST bread I have ever had!!  The flavor and texture are amazing.  My kids even asked for seconds on their dinner (which they NEVER do) just to get more of this delicious bread!  Thanks for posting, I will be making this again and again and again!

We really enjoyed this bread!  I used the vinegar & milk substitution for the buttermilk, and it still worked great.  It is also wonderful for breakfast.  I used a 9x9, not 8x8, and it really filled the pan.  I turned off the oven 10 minutes early - the wider pan was getting it done faster.

Very Very good. Just sweet enough to entice individuals who "fear" the darker breads. And of course, i subbed in Smithwick's instead of Guinness.

Just tried my first piece after pulling it out of the often.  Warm, with a bit of butter, just great tasting bread.  I made a double batch, split it 50/50 in two 5x9 loaf pans.  Fit perfect.  Only thing I did outside of the recipe was about 1/2-3/4 teaspoon of extra vanilla extract per batch.

I had some leftover Guinness from a party. Since I'm not a big beer drinker, this was a good way to get rid of it. The bread has a good flavor to it - I think it would be good with some butter or cream cheese.  Also, seems like a good winter bread for soup or chili. Will definitely make again - I still have four bottles of beer.

This came out perfect and was really easy to make.  Not as sweet as banana bread, but with a little sweetness to be perfect eaten plain.   I used Leinenkugel Snowdrift Vanilla Porter instead of Guinness, which still gave it a great dark finish.  I used a round cake pan, and within the first ten minutes in the oven it rose up about a half inch over the top of the pan.  But it was fine and nothing spilled over.  After cooling, it retreated back into the pan.

This is awesomeness for sure!!! I greatly enjoyed and so did my five boys. It does have a perfect sweetness not too sweet and not too unsweet. It's perfect! I didn't change a thing my husband added farm honey on it and said it was phenomenal! I will be making this more often! Yum factor! I added oatmeal to the bottom too. Thank you!! It does fit perfectly in the loaf pan.

Used Extra Stout Guinness. This bread was wonderful. It was super easy to make too. Like other reviewers, I did not have to bake the bread for the amount of time listed on the recipe (I think I ended up baking it for 45-50 minutes). I will be making this again.

This was a great recipe for our St. Patrick's day gathering.  I've made a double batch twice in 3 days time, once with normal sugar called for and once with 1/2 the sugar and both were equally great.  Personally, I didn't notice a difference between the two.  Both times they were done after only 10-15 minutes after turning down the oven temp.  Simply amazing served warm with butter and honey.  Everyone loved it!

AWESOME, I can cook anything, but cant bake to save my life. Had some friends over and made corned beef, and just had to attempt this great bread.  Followed the recipe exactly but used quick oats instead of rolled. It came out great. It was surprising moist and light. Most irish breads can get a bit dense. Will def. make this again

This was a good bread, a little bitter for me. I served it to the guys at work with honey butter, and it didn't last long. I will make again without using the extra port beer.

This bread was SO easy to make and really quite delicious.  Goes great with soup/stew/chowder, especially on chilly New England fall day.

This turned out wonderful, but with one major modification.  After following the instructions exactly, the consistency was too liquid.  After adding about 3/4 a cup more flour than called for, the consistency was much better.  My husband pronounced the final product "Amazing"!  Even my two-year-old son loved it.

This bread was great!  I only made one small change...I was out of brown sugar so I used an equal amount of raw sugar.  We were very happy with the flavor and level of moisture.  I will definitely make this again!

First beer bread ever made. Always loved Guinness and this is a great way to flavor with it. I added:  5-6 tbsp of flax meal to the flour and then mixed a large handful of raisins into the wet dough--the flax adds a raw nutty-ness that goes nicely with the stout while the raisins made the loaf slightly more moist and sweet. Keeper for sure. Yay for awesome Irish food

I love this recipe. I’ve made it many times and it’s a staple with every St. Patrick’s Day meal. This year I doubled the recipe and made Guinness biscuits instead of loaves. Followed the recipe exact other than doubling it. Set the oven for 400 degrees, poured an ice-cream scoop of batter in each greased muffin tin and baked for 13 minutes. They came out beautifully!

Great recipe! I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used Greek yogurt. I only had half a cup of plain, so I used that and half a cup of vanilla yogurt. I cut back the added vanilla to 1 teaspoon. I used a loaf pan and cooked it for 30 minutes at 375, then 40 minutes at 350. I let it cool in the oven for 30 minutes. The bread is dense but not dry. The exterior has a pleasing light crunch. There's just a faint taste of the bitter Guinness. A little honey butter on a warmed slice puts it over the top. It's gotta be healthy with all that whole wheat flour, oatmeal and yogurt, right? :)

This is delicious even when I halved the recipe and substituted white flour ( increasing it by 1/8 cup) because I didn't have whole wheat. I used my electric mixer, a glass loaf pan, and the same temps and time. Family loves it. Will keep this one!

Delicious!   Made it with the Guinness Beef Stew.  Will definitely make again.  The bread did seem to cook much faster than the recipe called for.  1/2 hour at 425 degrees and it was pretty much done.  I let it sit in the oven for the 1/2 hour with the door open.

Great recipe, this bread works great as part of a hearty breakfast. But I made a few changes by adding ground flax seed, diced almonds, and what ever other seeds or nuts I have lying around. I also got replace the butter and the butter milk with flax milk for extra health points.

Spectacular flavor! This bread is SO easy to make and is the best thing I have ever smelled when it is baking! The ONLY reason I did not give it a full 5 stars was because it is crumbly/messy to cut. But the flavor is out of this world! It is one of my favorite recipes for quick bread.

We love good beer in our house and I was really excited to try this one.  While it was okay, I didn't find it particularly flavorful.  I think someone who wants a very mild flavor would appreciate it though.

My family loved this! The consistency was like a whole wheat cornbread but that was because I didn't do the step of letting it sit in the over for 30 minutes when it was done. I needed the oven for something else. I will try it the correct way next time but regardless, they loved the consistency and flavor of this bread even without the last step.

This is a tasty bread! Tried it for St Pat's day slathered in Kerrygold. YUM!! Baked it in a cast iron dutch oven. Came out perfect. However I followed a previous suggestion and started with a temp of 400 and dropped to 350. Can't imagine it wouldn't be overdone with a higher temp??

Hearty bread...good warmed for breakfast with butter and honey with some tea.
I had to split the batter in half and baked in 2 - 8" round pans and cut my time by 17 minutes.

This bread is so wonderful and simple to whip together! I used 3 Tablespoons of light butter, reduced-fat buttermilk, and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Also, I had Moose Drool beer on hand, and it tastes and smells divine! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good bread.  I followed the recipe exactly as shown.  Watch your baking time as I found mine got a little too brown even though I set my timer for a little under the recommended baking time.

I was a little disappointed.  I have a very easy beer bread that is much tastier and much better.

Was so perfect on St. Pat's day with steak and salad.  I was very worried that I was over cooking it, so I did take it out of the oven about 10 minutes early.  The bread was extremely moist and flavorful.  I don't believe anyone but me knew there was beer in the batter.  Good flavor, not overpowering at all.

When cooking over Gas, I've found the bread is finished in 30 minutes.  Has anyone else found this to be the case?  I'm experimenting with variations on the temperature and cook times to try to perfect this for my set up.

This loaf didn't even make it out of the pan before it was half gone. We loved the almost sweet taste of it....no extra butter needed.

Made this and its very good and very easy.  Only change was to use a single loaf pan, baked at 400 for 30 minutes then turned the oven down to 350 for 25 minutes.  Turned out perfectly.  It's a total keeper!

Very easy but I live in high altitude so had to make a few adjustments. Added 1/2c of extra flour and oats and cut cooking by 5 min in all steps. Came out great.

Returned this week from a two week vacation in Ireland. This recipe is on the mark in terms of mimicking the brown bread that is available all throughout Ireland. The only change I made was using McCann's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal because that is what I have on hand. Bread came out amazing, will definitely make this recipe again.

Very good! Sugar amount was fine, and I did use Guinness  Draught. Only change I made was baking only about 45 minutes total, with the temps as written. Went wonderfully with Trader Joe's Shepherd's Pie!

Love this bread! Especially love that it’s relatively healthy as breads go. I didn’t have Guinness, so I used a leftover Red Stripe beer and it was still wonderful. Also added some sunflower seeds for a little extra crunch. Will definitely make this again.

I love this bread!  It is a hearty, rustic bread with a tinge of sweetness.  The inside was soft and moist while the crust was chewier.  I thought it was good enough to give to my new neighbors across the street!

I haven't made this yet! I ship a lot of breads to my son at his Air Force base, but I ship them frozen. Can I freeze this bread once I make it? I need some new recipes for breads, and I think he'd like this one- But I really need something I can ship from frozen. Thanks!

Had to tweak it a little as I only had a 9fl oz bottle of Guinness and had to use the lowfat milk I had instead of the buttermilk. Swapped brown sugar for white. Loved the aroma of it as it baked. Will try this again.

This was excellent! Really a cross between a bread and a cake-- cake-y consistency, with a buttered bread flavor. The only change I made was that I used a 15.9 oz can of Guinness rather than a 12 oz. My boyfriend enjoyed the bread on its own while I used some honey butter. 

We made this prior to a trip to Ireland, and it definitely got us even more excited to go.

I made it with coconut flour, and the texture was like eating a mouth full of flour.  I don't like it.  And it may not just be the flour, but I will try it once more with the prescribed wheat flour and see if it will improve, but I'm doubtful.

Love this bread!! Made it the first time exactly by the recipe and it was great. The second I used honey instead of brown sugar, left out the vanilla and added roasted sunflower seeds. This was an attempt to make more of a savory bread. Not as good as the original but still tasty. I am gong to keep playing with ingredients but hard to beat this recipe  as written.

I was excited to make this as for once I had all the ingredients on hand. It had an unusual taste that didn't appeal to either me or my husband.  We managed to eat a quarter of the loaf - and then pitched it.

Everyone loved the bread; however, I would caution NOT to use an 8" pan, use a 9" pan instead.  The 8" pan overflowed into the oven.

This is a great quick bread, and my only advice is to make sure the butter is well blended into everything before you mix the beer in or make sure the beer has come to room temperature or the butter will solidifyand not mix in very well. I love making this bread when my hubby doesn't finish a 6 pack.

I have never had Guinness bread before, and this was way to cake-like in consistency, and had no flavor.

This is the first bread I have ever made (at 43). It was easy, and even though my oven is bizerk with temperature, it baked beautifully, and was absolutely delightful. Topping this bread with room temp butter is highly recommended.
