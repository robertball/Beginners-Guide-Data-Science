Who knew garlic could taste soooo good in coleslaw? The recipe author is correct, you really do need to love garlic to enjoy this recipe.  Well, we do, and we LOVED this coleslaw dressing.  Never been to Vincent's Seafood Restaurant, but we go to Dallas every Christmas, so we just may have to check it out.  crancherry, thanks for sharing your copycat recipe.

this was very good. I did change it a bit by adding instead of pepper &celery seed, a seasoning mix that contained dried lemon, pepper and celery seed. I think the lemon gave a bit of a zing. very good

Just got done making it and enjoyed it with dinner.  Delicious!
Let’s see how it tastes after letting it rest a day or two.  This one is a keeper.  Different twist on usual coleslaw we eat and offers variety.

This is just excellent. I didn’t change a single ingredient or an amount of the suggested ingredients listed. Just make it enjoy it and you’ll make it again, guaranteed. It’s that good!

Ok, I made it again and kept closer to the recipe except I used hemp oil instead of grapeseed, and a bag of colored coleslaw and just slightly less  spice and vinegar and it is loved!  It really blends beautifully over night so do make enough for a couple of meals!

This was fantastic! I’ve tried a few “garlic” coleslaw recipes trying to recreate the Chat and Chill’s in Exuma, Bahamas. This took me right back to that beautiful beach.  Only change was black pepper vs white and added some diced Fresh tomatoes. Love, love, loved this ! Light, zesty, and crunchalicios!

Loved it...  I Love Garlic !!!...  Pretty potent 1st day...  
and YES..  the longer it sits... the better it gets... it transforms..
It's also very good on hot dogs....   
NOTE if you're single...  I made the full recipe, and while it is Awesome...  eating it consistantly was too much..   but then 3 weeks later I found a  remaining 1 cup Pyrex in the back of my fridge...  and it was REALLY Good..   I'll definitely be making it again, just a smaller batch..
