I did not have bow tie pasta, I used equal amounts wide egg noodles. I also substituted TURKEY ham for only because I'm on a budget and the turkey ham was on sale. Right before serving, I sprinkled the dish with fresh ground pepper. The boys loved this dish--NO leftovers. NOTE: For those of you who are looking for a cheap and filling dish to stretch your food budget, this is the one for you.

This is a milder dish, but still delicious!  It was nice to have another way to use up the cabbage!!  The ham makes it really good!!

Nice variation on my Mom's (Austrian) pork and bowties.  The only thing she did differently is use leftover pork roast, cubed, instead of ham.  Your recipe  is an awesome combo.  Must have more often!!

This is one of my daughter's favorites. I've honestly made it at least a million times! ;) Like other reviewers I've also used sausage (usually smoked sausage) instead of ham. Either way it's amazingly yummy. I sometimes add a large handful of those precut julienned carrots, just for color, and I think one could add lots of different vegetables as well. The basic recipe really lends itself to a sort of clean-out-the-fridge meal. The only other thing I do differently is that I add the meat at the beginning, with the veggies, and then let everything slowly sauté into the yummy goodness that is this simple and homely dinner. Oh, and I have never remembered to add the sugar and water at the end.

This is super delicious! So much better than plain cabbage noodles although I adore those too. This is easy, economical, and tastes great. My mother said it was the best cabbage and noodles she ever had! Thank you for the great recipe. I will make it again and again.

This was just ok for me as written. I found it to be a little bland. I usually fry my cabbage in bacon grease for added flavor. I would definitely do that if I make this again. I really liked the addition of ham to the traditional cabbage and noodles.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  My husband and I really liked it.  I wasn't as popular with the kids (16 and 12).   I would make it again though.

This dish tastes good but was way to oily. Next time will cut down the butter and oil. I added a sweet onion and used whole wheat penne.

A humble but very tasty dish for those who enjoy cabbage. Comforting, simple, and ready in just over a half hour.

This recipe is good but is a little bland for our tastes. I’d give it 4 or 4.5 stars as written. It can be tweaked easily for personal preference and/or pantry substitutions. Definitely use a whole head of cabbage and a big onion... it will cook down quite a bit. Slice both in larger pieces because the dish will cook for a while and you don’t want it to go to mush. I used turkey kielbasa instead of ham & cooked it along with the onions & cabbage since the pieces are bigger and need extra cooking time. I cooked the dish on medium-high in a large deep skillet instead of medium-low as written because we really like caramelized brown bits. I used no-yolk noodles instead of wagon-wheels and brown sugar instead of white sugar since that’s what we had on hand. I was surprised how well the sugar fit with the richer flavors of the meat & butter (in other worlds, don’t leave it out). To raise the flavor profile a bit, I added a bit of salt, dried chives, granulated garlic, a little ground cayenne, and freshly ground black pepper. This is a definite keeper!

I used sausage instead of the ham and it was great!  Didn't do much different except added a little garlic salt and pepper.   And some carrots for color.  I'll definitely make again.

Hubby loved this. I added some balsamic vinegar, marjoram, mace, black and white pepper, and a pinch of sage.

Added 3 carrots the second time I made it - excellent addition. Sauteed them along with cabbage and onions.

I thought it was very good. Only change I made was to add freshly ground pepper to it at the end, and used kielbasa instead of ham since that is what we had. Hubby said I could keep it and make it again, but if I did to add some peas or snap peas to it for both color and a veggie component.

Easy and fast way to use leftover cabbage and make a filling and homestyle meal. I added Polish spices from Penzies and beef sausage along with the ham. Used Country Crock instead of butter (lactose free). Will make this again.

Grandmother's Polish Cabbage & Noodles Haiku: "So simple, so good. Swapped ham out for kielbasa, coz it brings the 'yum!'" Recipe submitter mentions using kielbasa (that I'd pre-browned w/ the onion b4 adding the cabbage) in place of ham, and not having farfalle, I used the remnants of 2 boxes of wagon wheels and twirlies to finish them off. The kielbasa really adds a nice dimension of flavor to the cabbage, and I think that the butter (while seemingly of a decadent amount to use) really makes this great too. Very humble, very comforting - hated that when serving it we needed a sprinkle of salt and pepper, but otherwise, a meal we'll gladly have again.

This recipe was pretty plain.  Not enough flavor for as much cabbage as it calls for.  Had to add about three times as much meat. Won't make again.

Wonderful base! It leaves plenty of room for additional veggies, meat and spices. I made mine with kielbasa, butter, cabbage, onion, garlic, garlic salt, chef seasoning, celery salt, white and black pepper, and egg noodles instead of bowties. The kids loved it and I will definately make this again.
