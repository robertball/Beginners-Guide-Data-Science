This was great and very easy!  It tasted very similar to a good bottled spaghetti sauce, but I didnt have to go to the store and buy it since I keep all of these ingredients on hand all the time.  I used it in the "Pasta Lasagna" recipe.  It was a huge hit.  My 6 year old daughter ate 3 (small) plates full, and it's rare that I can get her to eat more than 2 or 3 bites at dinner time. She actually asked if she could have a third plate of this instead of a piece of the Valentine's day ice cream cake I brought home. That was shocking.  I was really surprised at how easy this was too.  I used the exact amount of seasoning and all other ingredients just as the recipe is written, and I am not sure why others leave the bell pepper out (unless they just didn't have any), because that gives it a great flavor.  Great!

This was very quick, easy, and good!  I didn't do the peppers, added more garlic and some salt, just our preferences.  Also, I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of whole, skipping the blender step.  I usually make the kind of spaghetti sauce that you let simmer for a few hours, but was pressed for time and tried this, and I'm glad I did.  Excellent!

I made this sauce last night and was really pleased with the results. I left out the green pepper(hubby doesn't care for them) and I also added some salt and a touch of sugar. My 8 year old said it was the best spaghetti sauce he ever tasted!

Super delicious!  I changed a couple things because I wanted to make more to put in the freezer.  I doubled the garlic, tomatoes, chicken broth, and tomato paste.  I also added about 2 tbsp of garlic salt to the 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef I cooked.  Along with 1 tsp of ground oregano.  Simple and quick recipe!  My husband and toddler loved it, and asked for me to make the homemade stuff from now on instead of the store-bought kind.

We like a little chunkier sauce so I use diced tomates w/ basil...also, I use Vegetable broth or stock in place of the chicken stock...Mushrooms are also a good add, as well as a little grated carrot for sweetness.

I've never made sauce this way, and this recipe wasn't quite as fast to the table as I was looking for (hungry toddler). With a few changes, I got it to the table within about 15 minutes. I sauted the garlic and onion (I was out of green peppers), then I added a can of Muir Glen crushed tomatoes with basil. I added some parsley and oregano, heated it up, and that was it. It got an "mmmm" from my 22-month-old. I decided to skip the chicken broth and tomato paste because I wanted the fresh taste of the Muir Glen tomatoes to be front and center, and I didn't want to spend an extra 20 minutes making the sauce. This is a good after work recipe.

This was easy to make and had a great taste. I usually keep a can of prepared spaghetti sauce on the pantry shelf for those nights when I want a quick meal. Because I was out of that, I found this recipe, and liked the taste much better. I followed the recipe as written, except I only used 1/2 a bell pepper since my husband doesn't like a strong green-pepper taste. I would recommend adding a dash of salt.

Not impressed...made as written and was very bland and not very "tomatoey".  I questioned the cup of chicken both and I think that may have diluted some of the flavor.  Had to do some serious doctoring to get it to be edible.  Sorry, won't be making this one again.

This was good with additional tweaks: 1/2 t. hot pepper flakes, 1 T. sugar, 1 t. salt and some drying-up shredded Parmesan.  Served it cooked onto al dente angel hair pasta and it was good!  Looking forward to tasting it tomorrow 'cause I'm sure it'll be even better!  I prefer the fresher taste of this sauce to any cooked, canned or jarred sauce.  THANK YOU!

This recipe was a lifesaver! I usually do buy the store bought sauce in a jar, but I had all of the ingredients and decided to try homemade. This recipe is wonderful! My boyfriend went back for seconds...and then thirds! I was so glad that this was the recipe that I picked and made no changes. Next time though I will try to use fresh tomato's as the canned tomato's still have entirely to much sugar and sodium in them.

You can't get any better for a fast spaghetti sauce. I was out of bottled, and had all the ingredients on hand. The differences for me were saute the garlic, onion, and bell pepper, then some hamburger. Added the tomatoes, paste, and Italian seasoning to it all and simmered for about 30 minutes. Excellent! I'll definitely use this again. I imagine it's even better if there are leftovers that sit in the fridge overnight to let the flavors merge.

I used a little bit of Oregano and Basil instead of the italian seasoning, and  I added some ground beef. This was extremely easy and delicious!

This was very tasty for being so quick.  Changes I made that I believe made a difference:  1.  Instead of canned tomatoes, I used 6 Romano tomatoes, 2.  I added 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes, 1.5 Tbsp sugar, and salt and fresh ground pepper to taste, 3.  I added frozen Italian meatballs for the 20 min. simmer.  My whole family loved it!

This was a great base recipe. I followed it exactly before added anything, but it was a little bland for my taste. I added more minced garlic, onion powder, oregano, basil, salt and sugar. I threw in some ground beef and it was pretty tasty. Thanks!!!

add sugar, garlic powder, onion powder and cayenne. Just for the extra kick. simmered on low for an additional 20 min. was great for quick. The next day it taste even better.  made it again and added everything above and a bay leaf. Simmered for an hour and put mushrooms, chicken and italian sausage meat mix in it. Was very good. If you don't like it so thick add a small can of tomato sauce along with the paste.

I absolutely love this sauce. It is super easy to make and fun to play around with. I didn't have any tomato paste so I used tomato sauce. I also used orange and yellow pepper instead of the green because I didn't have any on hand. All in all it came out perfectly and my picky three year old loves it. My husband was blown out of town with the tastes. It is perfect when you want to sneak in vegetables for those picky eaters.

The amount of Italian seasoning seemed to overpower the sauce.  I will make again but will add my own blend of seasonings and use more garlic.

Gave it a high rating because it matches the description.  Better then I expected and pretty fast (dinner on the table in 30.)  Excellent for when the pantry is low.  I followed the recipe, excluding the bell pepper and it was very good.

I really had to doctor this up since I had already spent so much time chopping using fresh ingredients.  I added sugar, tomato soup, salt, pepper... then it still wasn't quite right and I added a jar of store bought sauce as well.  I wouldn't recommend this.

Wonderful and easy!  I do suggest adding a scant tablespoon of sugar to offset the acidity of the tomatoes, but otherwise very good as is.

I used half a green pepper, a little black pepper, a bay leaf and 1/8 cup of sugar to cut the bitter taste. Easy, quick to the point.

A nice, better-flavored alternative to bottled sauce.  Two tablespoons of italian seasoning was too much, even for someone like me who likes strong-flavored food.  I'd cut it in half if I were to make this recipe again.

Fantastic! I wanted a quick sauce to make dinner for my toddler and not only does he love it, but it's packed full of vegetables, so it's nutritious too. Thanks!

I liked this recipe.  I think I'll make some more and freeze it.  I used 2 cups+ of fresh diced tomatoes, b/c that's what I had.  I also added a bit of sugar, salt & parmesan based on other reviews!

I have made this twice now when at the last moment I realized that I my pantry lacked bottled sauce.  Hubby said it was as good as bottled.  Success!

Okay this is very bland and it doesn't have to be .So make it better.Yes you need more ingredients my way but you can have it in an hour.Ingredients: diced tomatoes,crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil,oregano, grated garlic, chili, salt pepper, touch sugar, At the end maybe a little weird but I love to add a bit of parmesan cheese. It can be ready in an hour, although i like to simmer longer. I have tried it in an hour and works. Want meatballs. Ground beef milk, touch parmesan and I put in some Italian crumbs. Mix and fry. This can be done in an hour. Need it sooner for toddler get prego.. Less spicy and better for them. Spice isn't that great for them. capricorn

This was a good quick fix. I used a lot more garlic. Without it I don't think it would have worked well for us. I used diced tomatoes instead of whole and they worked well. Would probably use this again if crunched for time.

Excellent homemade flavor with just a few ingredients. Tweaked only a little because I didn't have a pepper on hand (used more garlic and chopped some black olives in with the onion). I think the broth helped add something. I love the flavor beef brings to spaghetti sauce, so might try beef broth next time.

Lacking flavor but I really want to try it again because of the convenience and try taking others' recommendations to improve the flavor. I also added mushrooms and zuchinni.

I wanted a quick spaghetti sauce when I realized I was out of the bottled kind.  This was my first time making it "from scratch." Very easy, very quick and very good! I used canned diced tomatoes so I didn't need to blend and tomato sauce instead of tomato paste. Turned out great!

Here is where my wife and I differ. I love heavy on the tomato, sauces and she likes light on the tomato though she does love tomatoes...figure that out. We cooked this together. we used a red pepper because we had one in the garden and we only used 1 tablespoon of seasoning because 2 TBLS just seemed like too much. My wife insisted on adding sugar to cut some of the acid in the tomatoes and we used all of the tomato paste. This was a great sauce.We both loved it and will make it again. We used it in our eggplant Parmesan recipe and it was perfect. I'm sure this recipe is just as good without our modifications. We will have this again. Kicks any jar pasta off the shelf!

Used what I had in the pantry - stewed tomatoes, red bell pepper for green. Cut back on the Italian seasoning, personal taste.  Husband & son ate it up!!!  Will make for now on instead of serving jar sauce.  Freezes well.

This was GOOD!  I pureed the heck out of it because my kids don't like "chunks" in their sauce.  It had a delicious flavor.  I did only use one clove of garlic and added a little sugar at the end to sweeten it up.  Next time I'll had some carrots into the mix for flavor and nutrition.

This is a great quick sauce! I never remember to start my sauce early enough so this works out perfectly. We like a smooth sauce so I use tomato sauce instead of whole tomatoes and skip the blender part.

This was great.  We really enjoyed it.  I was out of jarred sauce so I had to have a quick fix.  I used frozen onions and peppers.  I also added canned mushrooms and frozen meatballs after the blender part was done.

Pretty good for a quick sauce.  It sure beats the stuff in the jar!  I thought 1 green pepper would be too much but once it's blended in, you hardly notice it's there.  I'm glad I used the entire pepper.

This was really good, but I think next time I will use half of a green pepper. I didn't expect that taste to be so overpowering. Also I used 10 Roma tomatoes instead of the canned whole tomatoes and about a can and a half of tomato paste to thicken it more. Thanks!

We have our own, but decided to give this a try. First, we saw the italian seasoning, but it never tells you where/when to add.  Per the recipe it was quite bland.  The consistency was nice, but very bland.  As such, I added 1/2-3/4 tsp salt, 1/4 cup fresh diced basil, 1/2 tsp fresh ground black pepper, 1 TBS of fresh diced oregano, 2 fresh garlic cloves (sliced thin) and 1 TBS of organic agave nectar.  I let that simmer and meld for 20 minutes in a covered pan. Viola!  The flavors popped and it was excellent.  Give the recipe a shot and if you find its bland, please try my recommendations.. you will not be disappointed!

Loved making a homemade dish. Don't do that often. I pretty much followed the original recipe, my changes were as follows:

~Crushed tomatoes vs. Whole
~Pre-minced (in jar) Garlic vs. Fresh (was out of fresh)
~Oregano vs. Italian Seasoning (was out of it)
~(2) Cans of Paste vs. (1)...(made sauce thicker and tomatoe"y"
**Additional: Added shredded carrots @ the end for sweetness & Basil to ground turkey meat as it cooked.

After trying so many recipes on this site, I was disappointed when I tried this one.  It was easy enough but just fell short of a good sauce.  It was missing something, very bland.  Think I will try another one.

What do you do to cut the acidity in the tomatoes?  Usually recipes have a tiny bit of sugar or other sweetner to do that.  I'd love to try this recipe but need to know about the acid.   The other thing: I usually add some meat, either Italian sausage or ground beef for a richer flavor.  Thanks in advance for your input.

Very easy to make with ingredients I usually have on hand. AND my husband said he loved it! I thought it was a little bit bland, might add in some cayenne or chilli flakes next time.

I had a little trouble with my stove and the medium high setting, because my peppers/onions were almost blackened after 5 minutes.  I went along and added the garlic, tomatoes (I used petite cut Del Monte) and some Italian seasoning I had blended up on my own.  Noticed recipe skipped the seasoning altogether.  Modifications: added 3 tsp white sugar, about 1/8-1/4 c ketchup and a few dashes of s and p.  The results were awesome, if not just the tiniest hint bitter.  Perhaps it's just my palate, but I tasted it about 9 times, each with that end note of bitterness.  Enjoyed with Sriracha hot sauce all over it.

Thought this recipe was good - very easy.  It's one I will make again - I followed the recipe exactly except I used stewed tomotoes (it's what I had on hand) but would probably use crushed or diced next time - also added some marinated mushrooms.

good but had too much of an "Oregano" taste for my liking. I served hamburger on the side, and ended up stirring it in.......really made it better. I will keep looking for something that I like better, but for those that love Oregano...this may float your boat

Very Good quick recipe . I altered it slightly due to lack of some ingredience. I browned some hamburger with the onion and drained . Added a can of chopped tomatoes and 1 can tomatoe sause instead of the paste and added the chicken stock . I had no fresh garlic so I use 1/8 tea.garlic powder.Added parsley , basil and oregano. I did not puree the ingredience as I like it chunky. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Very good and easy, although my lid blew off the blender when I went to blend the sauce, I swear it was like straight out of a movie!  Luckily I had my hand on top so we only had a minor mess to clean up.  So make sure your sauce isn't too hot when you put it in the blender.  I also added some fresh basil cause I had it on hand and wanted to use it up.

This definitely was quick and easy, but I think the flavor was lacking. I did add a little sugar, but it really needed some more seasoning. Not at all bad, but too bland for our tastes. I did make it to go with the Meatball Sandwich recipe from this site and it worked well enough. Thanks :)

My picky 7 year old son wanted spaghetti quickly because he was "starving". I started the noodles and found I was out of jar spaghetti sauce. The only sauce I've ever made took all day to make, so I was happy to find this recipe. It was fantastic! I'll never buy my sauce again! My son loved it, and I didn't even cook it as long as it said. Thanks so much for this recipe!

This was quick, easy and very good. I used 1/2 a yellow bell pepper and 1/2 a large onion and diced tomatoes. Had it with spaghetti and meatballs and it was fantastic. It was even better the next day.

The original recipe with the amount of seasoning was way too bland! It lacked spice. I quadrupled the garlic, Italian seasoning, added basil, oregano, and some crushed red pepper.  I also added salt. I used two cans of tomatoes and I small can of paste.

I loved it.  The chicken broth is an unusual switch from any spaghetti sauce I have made before.  As an aside, I got a chuckle out of reviews from those who made essentially a completely different sauce yet rated this one. For example, one left out the chicken broth and tomato paste and changed all of the other ingredients.  It sounds fine--basically like the sauce I normally make--but it has nothing to do with this recipe!
