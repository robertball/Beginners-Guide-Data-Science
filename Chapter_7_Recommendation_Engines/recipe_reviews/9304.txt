If you don't have any marzipan on hand for the stem you could always use an ice cream cone cup cake. They're very easy to make. Just take some cake batter and fill the cone 3/4 full and bake. Then just flip it upside down after it's been baked into the hole and frost with chocolate frosting. Voila! there's a stem that you can eat!

This was fabulous!  The only change I would make is to add 1 1/2 tsp. salt instead of 1/4 tsp.  (Most homemade cakes like this call for 1 1/2 tsp. salt.)  I made 2 of these for Halloween.  I think I should have followed other reviewers and used 1/2 cup applesauce + 1/2 cup oil.  1 cup of oil is a lot of oil!  I frosted the first cake with a homemade buttercream frosting, but it sure made the cake sweet.  For the second cake, I used a powdered sugar drizzle (1 cup powdered sugar + 1 Tbl. milk), tinted orange, with green sugar sprinkles on the top of the cake, then I decorated it with some plastic spiders. Festive!  I would definitely used the powdered sugar glaze again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so moist and awesome! My husband hates pumpkin anything and he LOVED this! I took previous advice and cut the white sugar to 1 cup, added 2/3 cup brown sugar and added 1 tsp. baking powder in addition to the baking soda. Next time I will add an additional 1/2 tsp. baking powder. I also do not care for cloves so I omitted them and added 1/2 tsp. ground ginger and cut the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp. as well. It was so yummy covered with cream cheese icing. Also, I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan so you will need to cut the baking time down to about 40-45 min.  Definitely do not want to overbake this one.

Definite 5*, turned out perfect.  I used half brown sugar, half white(thanks to someones advice), added 1 tsp baking powder, and went with the pecans,used only cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice and iced this bunt cake with cream cheese icing. This recipe would have been  perfect still if i left it as was!!!  We found this to be moist and full of flavor!!  I'll make this again!

I used all the other reviewers' suggestion plus made some minor changes of my own.  Instead of sugar, I used 1 cup of Splenda and 2/3 cup Brn. Sugar Splenda.  I didn't have allsprice or cloves so I substituted pumpkin pie spice and I threw in some chocolate chips.  The end result was a wonderfully moist, flavorful cake that was low in sugar.  I will definitely make this cake again and share the recipe with family and friends.

This cake is REALLY delicious, moist and flavourful! The really nice think about this recipe is that it is not terribly sweet. A dusting of powdered sugar or a simple powdered sugar and water icing add both visual character and the level of sweetness you desire. 

As a pumpkin addict, I have tried MANY pumpkin cakes, and this is the best one I have tasted so far.

THIS RECIPE MAKES GREAT, HEALTHY PUMPKIN MUFFINS! I LIKE TO PUT WALNUT PIECES ON TOP. IT'S ALSO GOOD WITH POWDERED SUGAR OR CREAM CHEESE ICING ON TOP. I USE 1/2 THE OIL, AND SUBSTITUTE APPLE SAUCE TO REDUCE THE CALORIES.

This is a good fall cake. It's also an old recipe, which is why it has so much oil and sugar. For the sugar, I only used 1 cup of brown sugar and a half cup of oil. I added all the spices listed, plus ginger and 1 teaspoon of baking powder, then baked it in a 9x13 pan. For those of you who say you skipped the cloves and think the cake is too bland, the cake needs the cloves. We had it with whipped cream. I baked it a bit too long, but it was still good.

This was great!  I did add extra of all the spices except cloves.  I added some ginger.  I didnt' have vegetable oil so I used melted butter and it was fantastic.  My daughter does not like pumpkin pie so this has become a new holiday tradition along side the pie.  :)

Used this recipe to make cupcakes and made no changes save for omitting the nuts. They were perfectly spiced, moist and with a nice, homey pumpkin flavor. While a cream cheese frosting would be the classic complement, I frosted these with "Wedding Cake Frosting," also from this site.

Lovely, moist, perfectly spiced autumn treat. I have used both pumpkin, as written, as well as mashed sweet potato, which I quick-cooked in the microwave, then slipped them out of their skins and mashed.  No discernible taste difference. Absolutely fantastic! I always cut the sugar back to 2 cups, and it comes out just right to our palates. I also add a tsp of ground ginger, which complements pumpkin/sweet potato to perfection. Wonderful, heritage-calibre recipe.

I adjusted the recipe as well, used 1 cup white sugar, 2/3 c brown,  1/2cup oil, 2/3 cup apple sauce and added 1 tea baking powder.  I made these into cupcakes and they rose beautifully.  I left in the cloves because we like a spice cake with a bit of a bite, and I think for those who left it out, this is what is missing for you, clove add a very nice level of depth and flavor to a pumpkin recipe.  Once the recipe is adjusted, it makes for awesome cupcakes/cakes.  Definitely loved the cream cheese frosting, you might try adding just a touch of cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice to the frosting (just a  bit, don't let it overpower... very easy recipe, shorten the time of course... I give 4 stars because i had to adjust  so much, but for mine  --- 5 stars!!! 
Happy Halloween!!!

Tried this for the first time and it is amazing. I did how ever take the advice of substituting half of the oil for apple sauce.  I sprinkled it with a mixture of powdered sugar and cocoa.  Yum, will try frosting it for Halloween.

Moist and somewhat tender.  Very much like pumpkin bread but a little lighter.  I followed the recipe except omitted the nuts because not too many people are fond of nuts.  I baked this in a 6 cavity fluted pan to make 3 mini pumpkins.  I had to trim some of the bottoms, but the scraps gave me a chance to taste test.  I would double the spices because I like my pumpkin goods to pack a punch.

Have made this cake every year for DH's birthday. (at least once each year since 2003!) I use pumpkin pie spice and add a glaze of powdered sugar/vanilla extract/cinnamon/milk.  Last year I made this for a dinner party and could NOT find the vanilla (went NUTS), so I substituted Hazelnut extract and it was delicious.  Fabulous recipe!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe! I made a few modifications, however. I decided to follow the advice of previous reviewers and used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I also used 2 1/2 teaspoons of pumpkin spice instead of all the separate spices. The cupcakes turned out great! I frosted them with cream cheese icing and it was a great pair. I would only recommend the reduced sugar if using icing, otherwise it isn't sweet enough.

Wow, what a yummy, yummy cake.  I did substitue 1/2 C applesauce for 1/2 C oil.  But then, I added back the calories saved (and then some, I'm afraid) by icing with cream cheese frosting--oh, my, this was to die for!  I added more nuts than suggested, too, and used pecans, about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of nuts.  I imagine raisins would be good.  The icing was great, but not necessary.  I think another reviewer said they made this with just applesauce, and no pumpkin, and I bet that would be just as good.  A very moist, spicy, dense cake, ideal for a cold winter morning!  I have frozen one to take out for my family on Thanksgiving morning.  Very easy to make, and I highly reccommend you try it.

Loved this recipe!  I baked this cake in in a 9x13 pan and iced with cream cheese icing.  It was very moist and received rave reviews at work!  It smelled GREAT while baking also!  I will definitely make this again!

Fantastic recipe! I used about 1.5 tblsp of Pumpkin Pie Spice, and increased the walnuts to closer to a full cup. I couldn't find my bunt pan, so I just used a 9X13 instead and it worked fine. I topped it with cream cheese frosting, and it was delish!  Thanks for sharing this recipe! :)

Wow, this cake is amazing!  I made it exactly as written (yes, I used all that oil!) and it came out moist and wonderful. It tasted like a spice cake - you couldn't taste the pumpkin much.  I frosted with butter cream frosting and it was enjoyed by all!

very moist and delicious. I substituted some applesauce and used tapioca flour instead of eggs, and it still was fantastic. This will be a fall staple.

This was an excellent recipe.  I did use 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce.  Very moist.  I made it look like a pumpkin and used cream cheese icing.  My kids loved it.

WOW! I thought the cloves might be overpowering but no way.  This cake was AWESOME!  I used 2 teaspoons of Allspice since I didn't have nutmeg.  Worked great!

The cake was very good although I did make a few changes. I used only 1/2 c. oil and 1/2 c. applesauce, and also added an extra 1/2t. of each cinnamon and cloves.  It is extremely easy to make, and I will keep this recipe to make many times to come.

I made this as a 2-layered round birthday cake with penuche frosting for my bf's birthday (had enough to make some cupcakes as well). I was debating whether or not i should have halved the recipe completely and just made the round cakes, but decided not to risk it. My boyfriend loved it, but I think the key was in the frosting, because the cake itself is a bit on the bland side--it needs just a little something more, but I can't put my finger on it. I only used half the oil and it was still very very moist--I would put even less if I were to make this cake again. I followed other reviewers' advice and used half brown sugar and half white sugar. I left out the cloves, compensating with more of the other spices, which I'm glad I did because the cloves tend to overpower the other. I rarely use nuts, so those were omitted as well.

I really like the taste of this cause it isn't super sweet, but it turned out really little.  I figured the pumpkin would mix with the soda so it would rise, but I guess next time I will just add a little baking powder.  Anyways, it tastes great with a little cream cheese glaze.

Excellent, easy and delicious.  If you are a pumpkin pie lover, you will love this cake.  Took no time at all to prepare.  I even made it with pumpkin that I grew and cooked myself.  If you are looking for a very moist, pumpkin spicy cake, this is the recipe for you.

We just had a piece of this cake and it was wonderful.  I did not have allspice so I used a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice in its place but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  We loved it and will make it often.  For special occasions I might add a glaze but for an everyday dessert I would not change a thing.  Many thanks for another keeper!

Excellent cake!  Only change I made was adding 2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice.  Followed rest of recipe as is and frosted cake with cream cheese frosting.  Made first cake into cupcakes and then made cake.  Both disappeared real quick!  Thanks for a great recipe!  This one is definitely a keeper.

I made this cake for my son's first birthday, which was actually Thanksgiving day this year. He has red hair so we call him pumpkin-head. Decorated to look like a pumpkin, this cake not only looked great but tasted great too. I've never made pumpkin cake before, so I have nothing to compare it too - but it was very easy to make. I will definitely use this recipe again and again.

This is so good! Moist, sweet, not overly pumpkin-y. And it's easy! The hardest part was waiting for it to come out of the oven. This would be so good with vanilla ice cream!

I made large, what they call "Texas muffins" out of this. I personally love the taste of pumpkin all by itself so much I cut the spices in half but I expect most people would want to leave them in. It really tastes just like a pumpkin pie in cake form. The cake is moist by itself but if you wrap it or put it in a plastic baggy nearly straight out of the oven it retains a great deal more moisture.YUM!

This cake was quite boring. It wasn't bad. It wasn't great. Just... "eh". I did everything as instructed except for using the allspice since I didn't have any (I substituted with cardamom to give it a little extra kick in the pants.) For some reason this just seemed more like a bread than a cake to me. Next time I will try a different pumpkin cake recipe in the hopes of finding something a little sweeter, lighter, and more spongy.

I thought this cake had a lot of potential, but there was still much to be desired. Of course, I made changes. I used vegan egg replacer and applesauce instead of oil. I think it needed more salt, or perhaps some lemon zest to boost up the flavor. I think I saved it with orange icing, but it was still a little bland. It was a little too sweet as well. Even though I used applesauce, I decreased the amount of sugar. Also, it will be a dense cake no matter what, I added baking powder and was still small. I will definately expirament with this one!

I made this for a friend's son's birthday, and he LOVED it! I didn't taste the cake.  I'm rating it on the smell while baking, and because it was easy and fun to make. I made a cream cheese frosting, used a ice cream cone for the stem, and Ghiradelli chocolate chips for the face (they are bigger than other chips.) I used half canola oil and  half unsweetened applesauce,and  reduced the sugar to a scant two cups.

Very good. I used half oil and half applesauce. Also used 1 c white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Great use of my frozen homemade pumpkin puree. Tastes like gingerbread. Mmmm... I sifted some powdered sugar on top but the cake absorbed it all by the time I served it so I would recommend doing that right before serving.

FABULOUS CAKE!  I actually jointed allrecipes.com just to review this recipe.  My boyfriend said I really should tell other people how much we liked it.  .  Easy to make, very moist, but holds together. The cake stayed moist for days, delicious taste. I added more cinnamon, powdered ginger, and nutmeg and used more than a cup of whole walnuts halves.   It is sweet enough, so we topped it with Greek yogurt drizzed with real maple syrup.  A winner!

I made this with the Whipped Cream Frosting from this site for my daughter's first birthday. I was looking for something that I would feel alright about allowing her a bite of, and this gave me that pleasure. I made a few changes: I used 1/2 of oil, 1/4 cup apple/sweet potato baby food (didn't have applesauce on hand) and 1/4+ cup of apple cider. I baked in two 9" pans for about 40 minutes. The cake was wonderful and the frosting was the perfect complement. Rave reviews!

My family LOVED this recipe, even though I ran out of eggs and used only two. I also cut the oil down to 3/4 since I was using fewer eggs. The result was a thicker batter, so I poured it into a loaf pan and it came out a more of a pumpkin bread. It is super moist, wonderful texture (don't omit the nuts!), and not too sweet. I rated this four stars only because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I will use this recipe (albeit altered) the next time I want to make pumpkin bread! It was a deliciously happy accident!

Recipe ingredient amount for oil calls for 1 cup - this is WAY TOO MUCH OIL and it was a waste of my time and money to use this recipe.  Not edible.

This cake was SO delicious.  I always make it for Thanksgiving and sometimes Christmas.  The moment the lid comes off my cake tote, the crowds rush in.  Unfortunately, there's never any left for me!

I've baked this cake three times and it was delicious.  The only complaint was it was not high enough, so next time I will try using baking powder per another reviewers suggestion.  I bake cakes to sell and it looks much better if they are taller.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  I think I will also try the brown sugar suggestion next time.

I used unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil (makes it spongier), followed the brown sugar/white sugar advice and also added a 3/4 cup sour cream (without the oil where was I gonna get the fat!? lol). It is a delish cake ~ used brown sugar and cinnamon combo sprinkled on top

This is a great smelling cake, full of spice.  However, it is a bit bland because it lacks flavor.  There is nothing to make your tongue go 'wow' or to set the pumpkin element in.  If one had their eyes masked, they would think it was soley a spice cake.  I opted not to use the cloves because they are generally too much for a cake, especially a pumpkin one.  I added ginger instead, usually used in pumpkin pies rather than cloves, which made it more gingerbready.  The crust turns out very crusty at the top and chewy underneath, but the center is very moist.  I used real pumpkin which gave an interesting texture, but I doubt canned pumpkin would provide drastically different results.  I am sticking to pumpkin pie!  :)

Very good recipe. I replace all the oil with apple sauce and it still turns out great! 1 cup oil = 1900 calories, 1 cup applesauce = 170 calories, crazy difference for very little difference in the finished product. I use food coloring to dye the icing orange and a 1/2 a candy bar for the pumpkin’s stem. For a quick and easy “leaf” decoration, 1 dye very small amount of reserved vanilla frosting green and put it in the refrigerator for at least an hour. The cold makes it fairly malleable, and a leaf shape can be easily made and placed next to them stem. Thanks for the recipe, it has become an autumn family tradition!

I made it. The only changes I made was to replace half the oil with applesauce and to add 1 tsp of ginger. It was a hit! I served it  at Christmas and it disappeared almost before I grabbed t a slice.

I have a slight variation- it turns out a very moist cake.  3 cups sugar, 4 eggs, 1 tsp. Cinnamon, 1 tsp. Nutmeg, 1 1/2 tsp. Salt, 2 cups cooked pumpkin, 1 cup Veg. Oil, 3 1/2 cups flour, 3 tsp. Baking Soda, 2/3 cup water.  Bake 325 till completely rises...45min-1hour...do not overtake...use the cream cheese II recipe and add pumpkin spice to taste...this is my first holiday themed cake...everyone in the office loved it...one thing I work hard on is a presentation of Eating with your eyes first then follow it up with flavor...this will be a hit

Another Wonderful recipe I have been fortunate enough to come across from this site! I decided to half the recipe and make cupcakes out of this recipe! Delicious! Extremely moist,nice and fluffy abd baked up beautifully :) I did have to modify this recipe according to what I had on hand. I only had a small amount of pumpkin so I substituted the rest with sweet potatos also i was low on regular sugar so I replaced some with light brown sugar!! Even with my tweaks this cake turned out Excellent!! I frosted my cupcakes with Chef Johns cream cheese frosting! Try this recipe you wont be sorry it is truly a no fail recipe! And to the people who thought this cake was bland or boring just bump up the spices a bit! I always add to my personal preference!

I made this as cupcakes with cream cheese frosting also on this website. They were a hit! I did reduce the sugar to 1 and 3/4th cups and it was perfect. Added half teaspoon baking powder and increased the baking soda to 1 1/2 teaspoons. Skipped allspice because I didn't have it.

Took this cake to my husbands TaeKwonDo belting ceremony and everyone loved it. Only change I made was I subbed half a cup of natural apple sauce for the oil. Thank you for this delightful recipe!

Absolutely delicious and so easy to throw together quickly. I did reduce the sugar to 2 cups, because I thought 2 and 1/2 cups sounded like way too much. I also increased the salt to about 3/4 tsp since 1/4 tsp didn't seem like enough. I've been cooking and baking for 20 years, so if I give a recipe 5 stars, it's because it deserves it. BTW, I used this recipe to make cake pops, and it works great. Thanks!

I made my own pumpkin cream cheese icing and it also was a big hit.I used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice,2 tsp cinnamon, 2 8oz cream cheese softened, 1/2 cup butter soften, 2cups sifted confectioners sugar and 1 tsp vanilla.Cream the
cream cheese and butter together, add vanilla. mix pumpkin spice cinnamon and sugar together and mix with cheese and butter.I hope you all injoy this as much as she did.Cookie

WOW!  Fabulous cake... we all loved it and while it was baking it brought out the neighbor.  The smell was so delightful and the taste was out of this world.  I did add 1/4 teas. of ginger and doubled the amount of walnuts.  Very simple to make.
