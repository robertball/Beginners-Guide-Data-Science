This is a classic French method for cooking steak, and really, REALLY delicious!  Adding mushrooms to the sauce is an excellent plan.  I'm amused by the people who make vast changes to this recipe, and then complain that it didn't turn out the way they expected.  Ummm...try following the recipe!  And if you don't like pepper, maybe something called "peppercorn steak" won't please you...If you like classic French peppercorn steak, this is the recipe for you.  Cook it EXACTLY as described in the recipe.  Cooking this sort of steak in a frying pan is a wonderful change from the grill!  The sauce is fabulous.

Awesome. Simply awesome. 
I cooked the steak as directed until they were as desired (medium), did the brandy trick, then removed steaks and continued from there, instead of removing later.

The one gripe I have: all the comments about 3 foot high flames. What proof and how much extra brandy are you using?? There is no *poof* and maybe a 4 inch flame. I got my buddy to come check out what I was doing, only to sorely disappoint him with lame pyrotechnics. You guys sure you didn't mistakenly drink all your brandy and drunkenly add grain alcohol as a substitute???

EDIT: lol... Ok, I was a little harsh with the flame effects. However, I have found the trick: The liquid needs to reduce to very minimal levels compared to the amount of brandy added. With a higher ratio of brandy to wine sauce, you have a MUCH better flame, which not only adds to the effect of cooking the meal, but also singes the fat and adds a great flavor.

As a personal preference I grilled the steaks on the BBQ and made the sauce separately. I softened the onion & garlic before adding the liquid's to the sauce and cooking it for about 15 mins. The sauce got nice and thick and the flavour was delicate but beautiful. It worked tremendously well with the peppery steak. I think I will add some mushrooms to the sauce next time to soak up more of the yummy flavour. Thanks for a great recipe!

We tried this last night and loved it. The only complaint that we had was that there are no FIRE restriction heights to the brandy part for things above the stove. The recipe was prepared as writen and could not ask for a better way to prepare steak. It was so good that we will be making it again and again. Thanks for this one. Oh yeah, This recipe will turn the worst cook into a five star chef.

This was EXCELLENT!!! This is the best steak recipe I have tried so far!  I loved the sauce; I simply added some mushrooms, and let the sauce simmer a while longer.  I also used coarse ground pepper instead of the crushed peppercorns.  I used bourbon instead of brandy, which worked just fine.  Make sure you use a household lighter (the torch kind) to light the steaks, or else you'll set your hand on fire.  I served this with boiled spinach and balsamic red potatoes to absorb the extra yummy sauce.  My husband was very impressed!  A+++!  Thank you so much!

I found it easier to make the sauce if I removed the steaks after flaming them.  This way the sauce can thicken and the steaks won't get overdone.  I used 2 ribeyes and added 1 cup sliced mushrooms to the sauce.

I made this today and as it was cooking, the aromas in the kitchen were wonderful!  My fiance' and I took one bite of the delicious steak and sauce and are now hooked on this wonderful dish.  He said it is definitely a "keeper", and I couldn't agree more!    The only thing I changed in the recipe was to add mushrooms and I also doubled the yummy sauce.  I served it with mashed potatoes and we put some of the sauce on top of them.  Perfecto!

Wow!  What an exceptional steak recipe!  Definitely one of the best steak recipes on allrecipes.com.  The red wine / garlic sauce is absolutely stunning.  I skipped the salt, sugar and shallots and added extra wine to make the sauce stronger in taste and added also extra brandy simply for maximum effect.  Although the black peppercorn is an excellent ingredient, may I suggest capers as a possible replacement for those who don't like their steak too spicy.  Safe to say, I will definitely make this stunning recipe again.  Congratulations to the creator of this tasty dish!

UNREAL good!!!  I agree with the reviewer who said it almost made her cry.  The first thing that ever came out of my kitchen that I felt was truly restaurant worthy.  AND it was relatively easy.  Even my culinary cretin children loved it and complained when it was all gone (which happened quickly).  The only variations I used were course ground instead of cracked pepper, the addition of a 1/2 cup of Shitake mushrooms, skipping the sugar, and setting aside the steaks to make the sauce - I returned them to the pan for about 2 minutes per side before serving.  Truly an amazing recipe!

Excellent flavor and extremely tender.My only complaint is that my sauce turned out looking nothing like the ones pictured but the flavor was still outstanding. I will cut down on the heavy cream next go around to see if this improves the color and texture of the sauce. I left out the "optional" sugar and the lemon pepper due to personal preference but other than that I followed this recipe to a T. This was a great recipe!

This was super!  Followed the recipe, be careful when lighting the brandy, flames get about 1ft high but burns out quick.  Light on fire a raw spagetti noodle to light your brandy for safety.  We will be making this one again...

Mixed reviews between my husband and myself.  I also added mushrooms, but I didn't have any cream on hand to finish off the final touches. Although I've enjoyed previous peppercorn steams, I found the quantity of peppercorn here a bit overpowering. I'll try another kind next time.

As previous reviewers, I'm literally weeping. This recipe is sooo good! We invariably get a couple of packages of sirloin steaks in the 1/4 beef we order each fall from our local beef-grower-buddy up here in NW MN and, until now, we've never had a good recipe for them. Well, this is it!  I didn't have any green onions or shallots on hand, so just wilted some of my last fall's garden Copra storage onions (chopped) in the micro and added them to the sauce when I turned the steaks. I followed the rest of the recipe to the "t". The brandy flamed famously with my husband standing, nervously, nearby with a damp towel - he was so funny. This is FAB! The sauce is to-die-for! I'll definitely make this again! Thanks for posting this, TFRIESEN  !!

Excellent. Had no brandy and used 10% cream and it was amazing. Also uses Costco lemon pepper mix instead of the pepper, lemon pepper and salt.Omitted the sugar. Will make it again and again.

Let me beat the dead horse--this was out of this world!  My husband loves peppercorn steak, I don't.  I love anything with a cream sauce, he doesn't.  We both loved this!  When I told him the name of the recipe, he said, "sounds great, as long as it doesn't have a cream sauce."  He saw my crestfallen expression and said, just put the sauce on the side.  Well, guess who gobbled up all the sauce?  He ladled it all over his steak and potato!

After reading about those out-of-control flame outs I was cautious.  I spooned 1 T. of brandy on each steak, and then lit.  No problems.  Nice flame, then burned out.  I removed the steaks and let them rest, and added more brandy to the pan.  I did not add the sugar--not necessary.  Just out of this world!  Thanks for a great indoor steak preparation!

I served with simple baked potato and roasted asparagus with lemon olive oil and pine nuts.  A winning meal!

I added sliced portobello mushrooms right after adding the wine (I used Chianti). As for the brandy, I had to use Jim Beam instead- it still turnout out wonderful. My husband really enjoyed the sauce, but I think next time I'll let it cook a bit more, as I wasn't too fond of the crunch from the shallots. Overall, it was quite good. My cut of steak wasn't that good, and only about 3/4" thick, so I think it would have been better with a sirloin or filet. Nonetheless, the sauce more than makes up for it.

Amazing recipe! I made this as written for my husbands birthday dinner and became the "best chef ever"!  A couple of suggestions though to maintain it a 5-star recipe:  As others have said, cut back on the peppercorn, it is very overpowering if you don't.  Also, to get the best flavor, use good steaks with very little fat.

The steaks were beautiful but the flavor was a bit peppery and kinda blah.  Do watch out for that first flare of the brandy, it can flare as much as 3 feet high initially but then simmers down & extinguishes rather quickly, saw a gal in a Greek restaurant light her hair on fire that way once.  The sauce was delicious on the baked potatoes I served with, but lost something on the steak, my honey agreed.

I made no changes to the recipe besides omitting the optional teaspoon of sugar. What a disappointment. Let me be clear, I love pepper. I use pepper on everything instead of salt. I love the bite of peppercorns and hot peppers. But the pepper in this was so overpowering, I could barely taste the meat or the other flavors in the sauce. All I could taste was pepper.

Delicious! I've made this a few times now and it's always come out great. I follow the recipe exactly with the exception of removing the steaks immediately after the brandy burns off (instead of leaving in while addings the shallot/green onions/cream). Then I reduce the sauce a little until it's thick and creamy. I find 4-5 minutes per side ends up being perfectly medium rare - but I do let the steaks sit out of the fridge until they reach room temp.

Easy to prepare, the brandy was just a little too strong of a flavor for me. The DH thought it needed something. I'll try tweaking a bit to see how it comes out.

I made this for my parents' 25th anniversary.  It was a big hit among the steak lovers in my family.  I am not a steak lover, but I really enjoyed the flavour of the sauce. And it was fun to make!

This was very good.  Full of flavor.  My husband said he would like the sauce to be less creamy, so next time we may use less cream than it calls for.  Also, we will probably saute the shallots before adding them to the sauce, as they were a bit crunchy.  Overall, we enjoyed this recipe and will make it again.

This was definitely a restaurant quality steak!  It was awesome.  It really WOWed my husband! I felt like a gourmet cook after making this.  I used whiskey as I didn't have brandy and it worked out just fine.  I also used a light cream.  Next time I will use less pepper it was quite a lot.

What a wonderful steak!  I used coarsely ground pepper and not as much as called for (personal preference), and I added a basket of mushrooms (I like to slice my own into thirds).  Next time I will reduce the sauce a bit more.  I think just boiled little red potatoes would be great with this!  I would never sacrifice a good cut of meat, no matter how it is cut!  (Costco!)  As my husband says after a successful attempt at a meal, this is a KEEPER!

I was a bit disappointed because I used brandy but still did not get much of a flame. Adding mushrooms near the end is a good idea. I also used half and half instead of heavy cream and it was still very good.

TRY THIS! TRY THIS! TRY THIS! Not only was this easy and delicious, but it was fun too. Made this for valentines day and it was one of the best meals i have ever cooked. I sauteed onion and portabello mushrooms on the side and added to the sauce before serving. It was a great addition. I served with prosciutto wrapped asparagus and microwave risotto also found on this site.

My wife and I are not huge pepper fans but this recipe sounded too good to pass up..  I prepared everything according to the instructions (minus crusting the steak in black pepper) and the results were fantastic.  This is definitely going in our recipe box.  Pretty simple to prepare and cook, and the aromas will have your friends and family ready and waiting at the table.

I have made this recipe five times now and I get rave reviews. The only thing I would caution is NOT to deviate from the recipe. Every time I have I have regretted it! This steak is phenomenal and the gravy sauce is to die for. Highly recommended.

Sooooo good! I doubled the sauce part of the recipe so I'd have extra sauce to go on asparagus. I'm trying to cut carbs so didn't do potatoes but it would have been perfect with potatoes. Worthy of the 5 stars!

This was a SUPER meal.  I've made it 2 ways now - as written and cooking the steaks on the grill and doing the sauce separately.  I prefer the original method - I think the flaming of the brandy over the steaks and cooking it in the wine really adds something to the meal.  The sauce does seem a little "runny" and next time I think I'll double the sauce but spend a little time thickening it up while letting the steaks rest.  I used sirloin steaks in the pan (filets when I did the grill method), and for sirloin - 5 minutes per side was a perfect med-rare.  I may try the the pan method with some beef tenderloin medallions next time... served with a classic baked potato and spinach salad.

Amazing.  The sauce is one of the best I've ever tasted.  I did not have the shallots or green onions but otherwise made it exactly as suggested.  The sauce started to look a little ugly half way through cooking the steak but it came together nicely after the cream was added.   The brandy did create a spectacular flame (about 18" high and as wide as the skillet).  I had a large lid and my small fire extinguisher on hand, just in case I needed them.  :)

Really delicious way to have steak, but make sure you like pepper before trying this! I've made it three times now, and here's what I've decided are my personal preferences: 1) I double the red wine and garlic so that the sauce doesn't all boil away and leave me with slightly viscous char (which happened the first time), 2) I keep the heat at medium, otherwise everything burns, at least in my pan (at this heat, I cooked my steaks 6 min. per side and it came out medium), and 3) I don't like crunchy shallots in this, so I throw mine in to cook when I flip the steaks.  I looooove how fancy it looks when it's ready.

Oh my goodness.  Quite possibly the best steak I've had, certainly the best I've made.  A bit of work, but it's a fun recipe and so delicious.  My girlfriend who's grown up eating a lot of steak said it was one of the best she'd had too.  5 stars all the way.    No idea how much the brandy does for the flavor, but it was pretty exhilarating to see a huge plume of flame engulf the microwave for a second!

This was to die for! I didn't have any brandy though, so took the advice of another reviewer and used some Jim Beam - also didn't  have shallots, so I just used a little extra green onions. The sauce was just excellent and wish I had doubled it - I just can't say enough good things about this. If I have it, I'll try it with the brandy next time, but it's hard to imagine it being any better - thanks!

I am a pansy, so I halved all the seasonings. I also cooked the shallots in the cream before adding to the steak because I don't like the taste of raw shallots. Those changes made, it was fantastic! :) I used a grass fed, organic beef and it was delicious!

This tasted very gourmet, and I was pretty excited about lighting it on fire (haha, I'm weird.) So I made a couple of changes and it turned out fantastic. First, I removed the steaks from the pan once they were cooked to our liking, THEN made the sauce. In the sauce, I added mushrooms and cooked until tender. I added fat-free half and half to the sauce instead of cream, THEN put the steaks back in and warmed up. The brandy didn't flame up as much as I thought it would - you know, like you see on TV, but it still was a neat touch. I used a long BBQ lighter to flame them up so that my hands weren't near open flame as it happened, as I imagine what a match might have been.

I'm giving this five stars mostly for the sauce.  It is fantastic!  I also really liked the spices on the steak but did not like cooking them in the sauce.  For me, I think this extended the cooking time of the steaks and they were just a tad bit tough.  Next time, I think I will try cooking the steaks separately and then adding them to the sauce.  Served with Balsamic Roasted Red Potatoes.  Delicious!

This sauce is awesome!  I had a little difficulty getting my peppercorns to stick, but fabulous nonetheless.  Grilling might be a nice option, but I worry about the lost flavor in the sauce should they be cooked seperately.

I did this steak separately from the sauce, using just the crushed peppercorns and a light sprinkling of kosher salt. I omitted the lemon pepper because it seemed total contrast to the red wine and brandy later used, plus it would oversalt the beef.  Also if you are using a good quality, well marbled piece of beef, you do not need to cover the taste of the meat itself dramatically. Mushrooms were a great addition, and I allowed them to cook longer in the sauce so they were juicy and tender with taste. Overall I think it is a good recipe.

I hadn't prepared this recipe in some time, but did last night for valentine's. It's even better than I remember and the sauce is so tasty. Serve with rice or potatoes to soak up some of this savory sauce! I added mushrooms to the pan when the steaks are placed in, just because we love mushrooms.

This was a really wonderful recipe for a special dinner. I think next time I might cut down a little on the peppercorns, because it was quite a lot! I did not rub them into the piece of steak for my 7-yr-old, and she enjoyed it. The sauce was really tasty. We didn't have any brandy, so I just skipped that part. I considered using a different licqeur, but I was afraid I'd ruin the recipe. We really enjoyed having something so nice and different from our regular routine. Thank you!

This was awesome.  I used cognac instead of brandy, and I seared the steaks on the grill before cooking them in the sauce.  I added mushrooms, and I put them into the sauce with the shallots and green onions earlier than suggested in the recipe.  We will definitely keep this recipe.

Excellent recipe when you're looking for something special.  My steaks had a thick pepper crust which was a little much, so I would use less pepper next time.  Also remember to stand back when you light the brandy!  Even with way too much pepper (which could have been my fault), I still give it 5 stars.

My husband and I both like mushrooms with our steak so I added them to this.  We noticed that as we were eating the sauce was improving with flavor.  The next time we made this, we added more shallot (love them) and reduced the sauce down a little more.....perfect!!

This is the best steak recipe I've ever made. Definitely a go to recipe for that special dinner. The aroma while it was cooking was amazing. I left out the sugar but other than that I followed the recipe as written.

I think for our family that it would have been better to cook the steaks separately on the grill. We all like a different level of doneness and I had a hard time getting the steaks just right as they were cooking in the sauce. The sauce was absolutely wonderful. The amount of peppercorns scared me so I only used about half. Definitely will be doing this one again.

Very tasty. I didn't add the sugar at the end don't think it needs it? Will e making it again. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. I did as someone suggested and removed the steaks to make the sauce. I then drizzled the sauce over each steak when put on the plate. Yummy! Will be using it regularly. Sooo simple.

Love this recipe.  I make this for our "grown ups" night.  I add mushrooms to the sauce at the end for a bit of added yumminess.  Take caution when you go to ignite the brandy...the flames reach high.  Happy eating!

Excellent recipe! Just tried it again and it is a hit with the family. I made one variation at the end. After the brandy flame died, I transfer the steaks to another hot dry pan (no oil or sauce.) I just let the steaks cook on the hot pan for 2 - 3 min a side to get some charring and some parts crispy. I do the sauce separately as well. Yummy!

An Excellent Recipe for Impressing one's Guests.  I use this receipe for minute steak or rouleden as well.  Also use white Wine or Red.  A Great Way to Fancy Up Inexpensive Steaks.  I usually serve with Mushrooms, Baked Potaoe and Salad.  Family and Friends just can't get enough.

I followed this recipe exactly as written just so I could review it.  It turned out much better than I expected.  The sauce is one of the best I've tasted, a wonderful balance of flavors.  My only complaint is the sirloin.  Don't get me wrong, this is the best sirloin I've ever tasted, but this recipe deserves a much better cut of beef.  I'll give it a bit of an upgrade next time.

I doubled the recipe, followed the directions, and let the magic happen. It was such a big success that I've got people begging for the recipe AND a repeat performance. Plus, I didn't set my house on fire. Now, that's what I call a win-win.

So incredibly good and impressive! Oh how I love the peppery flavor! I didn't used the full three tablespoons of pepper. I put three tablespoons in my mortar to crush but I only pressed about 2 tablespoons into the steaks. I kept adding pepper until there was a nice even layer with not all the meat covered...and turns out that was about 2 tablespoons for my steaks. The steaks I bought were not thick so I cooked for about 7 min on each side. I removed them from the pan and let the sauce thicken a bit more. Definately garnish with sliced green onion, it makes the flavor so much more amazing.

I thought this was pretty good, but the steaks turned out a bit tough, even cooked to just medium doneness.  I might try a different cut of meat than sirloin, or maybe the cuts needed to be thicker?  I dunno, but aside from that this dish was great, I just wish I could have someone else make it for me, since food always tastes better when someone else makes it :)

Delicious! Used filet mignon steaks (more tender meat and way less cooking time).  Did not have Brandy so used cognac.  A wonderful fast, easy and elegant meal. Will make again and again! Many Thanks for this keeper!

Very tasty! Note to self - make sure you flame the brandy before adding the cream. 

Also- too much peppercorn.

This was very good and different. I did not have brandy so I substituted Southern Comfort. Bourbon would work well too.

I made this last night.  It was "the best". Very classy too!!  I made it exactly as instructed and have no reason to change a thing.  I usually don't prepare steaks at home because they sometimes don't turn out as I would like.  With the price of a good steak possibly not turning out to perfection,  I'd rather go to a restaurant and have them fix it, then be disappointed.  This steak recipe is one I will make over and over again.

Excellent!  I added the mushrooms as some others recommended.  The steaks were very tender and juicy, even the kid that never eats steak ate a small portion of this and liked it.  I did all my dicing and chopping while I had baked potatoes in the oven, cooked these once I had them out and resting.  Very good, will keep this in mind for when we have adult company to impress!

This is quite possibly the BEST steak I have ever had-- and boy am I picky about my steaks.  It is so juicy and cuts just like butter.  I make this about once every other week and I don't change a thing.  5 STARS FOR SURE!

Very tasty, but cut back a good bit on the peppercorns unless you are a big pepper fan. The sauce is fantastic. We served it over the steak and rice. Very impressive presentation. Thanks for a delicious meal.

I did not use wine.  I also did not use peppercorns, but ground fresh pepper onto the steaks and also used steak dust.  I put an entire chopped onion all over the top to cook with the steaks.  Used probably 1/3 cup heavy cream.  Did use the sugar.  Served it over jasmine rice.  This was INCREDIBLE!!!  My 3 kids, Grandma, and myself were fighting over the left overs!!!  Can't wait till my husband gets home for me to make this for him!  It's as good as any high class restaurant!  Really!

By far the EASIEST, restaurant quality dinner we have ever made.  Enjoy having company over for this.  Not only will they be impressed, but if you have everything pre-measured before they arrive, you can actually relax and enjoy yourself before AND while making this!

This recipe is fantastic!  I also added sliced mushrooms.  Next time I will add the onions a little sooner to let them cook longer so they won't be so crunchy.  Loved it, thanks!

My wife loved this recipe!  I may use another cut but it was great.  The sauce was rich and had amazing flavor. I only used half the sugar though and that was sweet enough.   I didn't have lemon pepper, thought I did, but I didn't. I used lemon juice in a small quantity and it worked, the steak may have more flavor with the lemon pepper, as may the sauce. Thanks for sharing, my says this one's a keeper.

Not sure what I did, but the sauce came out a gross purple, and it just overall was not good.  My fault I'm sure but I don't know exactly what I screwed up.

I think the recipe is OK however in my humble opinion it might not need as many ingredients to make it superb. For instance, I do agree in the fact that it seems to have too much pepper. Use an amount of pepper that will NOT cover the flavor of the meat.  I did not flambée the meat but definitely allowed the wine to consume and be absorbed by the meat. I have cooked many times Boeuf au Poivre and I can say that just the brandy is enough for this recipe. The important thing is to have a good very tender cut of meat , don't use too many of the ingredients, and never over cook the beef. This recipe benefits from using half the ingredients IMO depending on the size of your steaks.

This was fantastic with sirloin and I think it would be even better with filet. I didn't have any brandy so I used Makers Mark and it was delicious.

Made it two ways. Pretty much exactly as written and modified. Modified I sautéed mushrooms first and set aside. Then seared/cooked steaks in butter, added brandy and flamed, then removed to warm oven. Then I added red wine and garlic and sautéed one minute. Next I added back mushrooms, cream, shallots, green onions, and reduced for about four minutes. Plated steaks and covered with sauce;  good!  Liked it both ways but better modified.

Would probably love the flavor with 1/2 t. pepper, not 3 T peppercorn.  Five minutes each side was much too long for medium/medium-rare.  Excited to try this again with 1/6 of the pepper (online conversions didn't help) and less time on the stove.

Awesome recipe!!! Super easy to prepare. I did not have brandy and I cut the steak into strips. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. I will definitely make it again and with brandy to see how that changes the taste.

Wonderful Recipe, the picky eater in my house ate his entire steak (he doesn't even LIKE steak normally.) Very easy to make, but is impressive to cook in front of guests. I will definitely be making this recipe a lot! The sauce it makes is delicious and the steak was perfectly cooked and tender.

This was fantastic and so easy to make.  My wife thinks I am the best after this dinner.  I added finely chopped onions at the beginning and sauteed them with the garlic.  Also used half the sugar at the end.  I will make this again.  This is one of those recipes that can make a cheap cut of meat into a wonderful meal.  Of course I love any food that included flaming brandy  :)

Really, really good.  I start mine on the grill and finish for a couple of minutes in the pan.  The brandy/flame really does add a nice flavor to the steak.  I didn't have any problems with a huge flare-up as other reviewers mentioned.

Very tasty! I do substitue the heavy cream for evaporated skim milk for a much healthier alternative. The resulting "gravy" is a little thin (perhaps bc of the swap?). Regardless, nothing a little cornstarch doesn't resolve, and the end result is delicious!

Made these for dinner last night and was very impressed on how easy it was to make and it was also very good. The only thing that I missed was the chargrilled taste you get from the grill. I think next time I will start it out on the grill for a couple mins just to get the nice outer crispness then finish it in the skillet. also I think I will use another red wine only had merlot on hand and you couldnt really taste it. Other than that it was very good. Thanks to the creator! Now the test is to see if my anti-steak eating husband will eat it!!

I followed the recipe accordingly and it wasn't that great. The steak wasn't very flavorful and there was not much sauce. However since it received such good rating, I will give it another try. Next time I'll use sirloin instead of market steak and put more peppercorn on it. I may even sear the meat first so that it has a nice crust and then make the sauce.

This recipe was was WONDERFUL!  The sauce, WOW!  My 6 year old and and my husband loved it.  We were done with our steak and looking for other things to enjoy the sauce with...we smothered our baked potatoes in it!  This is my first review but I am so glad I waited to do it for this recipe :)  I used to love in Europe for 13 years and this brought back so many memories!  

I will be making this over and over again!

Excellent!  Fiance LOVED this and said I can make this ANYTIME.  And I got a kick out of lighting the contents of the pan on fire!haha  My only change next time is to cook the steaks 6 minutes on each side...I did 7 on one and 8 on the other and it was just a tad bit more done than we usually order (we like medium).

I liked this dish, but found it difficult to cook steak the way I like it in the frying pan. You have to time it just right when putting in the alcohol and lighting it on fire. Steak ended up being almost medium well and I like my steak medium rare. Will adjust next time. Also, the sauce was a little bland so next time I will add something (maybe garlic powder) at the end to give it a little more zip.  I used Jim Beam Bourbon which gave it a yummy taste. Would be awesome with mashed potatoes. Thanks for sharing!

I tried this recipe tonight..and I was really looking forward to this...not sure what I did wrong....but I did not like it......the only thing I can think of, is that I bought a thick cut sirloin and maybe it cooked too long for the wine and garlic in the pan?? I might try again with thinner steaks, which is why i will give this 2 stars instead of 1.

Great recipe. I prefer the sauce to have the sugar added.

This was so good and taste.  Although I couldn't get the steak to flame up but that didn't affect the recipe at all.  Next time I'll add mushrooms and let them soak in the sauce to absorb the flavors.  Thanks so much for sharing.

We found the flavor very overwhelming, but it is a good recipe. Next time I will use course black pepper to tone it down.

NO FLAVOR!  Holy smokes it blew my taste buds away.  I made it almost exactly.  I took the steaks out before I added the cream.  My guests loved it and, the kids loved it and I will make it again.  Maybe next time I'll put in the mushrooms.  Thanks for posting this amazing recipe.  I agree...this was so good I could have cried.

This was very fun to make.  The sauce tastes exactly like beef stroganoff, which was slightly disappointing, but it did taste very good.  We had to add more wine when cooking the steaks because it was drying up.  Plus, lighting food on fire is always a plus.

This was really good.  I used dessert wine instead of the red and omitted the white sugar.  Grand Marnier was my brandy of choice.  I only gave 4 stars because the peppercorns were a little crunchy.  Will cook longer on lower heat next time.

Very, very good. I used a Pittsburgh technique on the sirloins to lock the flavor.

I must have used the wrong grade of sherry, because my recipe did not flame. The flavor is pretty good, but it was so tender!! I will play around with the recipe and let you know if I come up with something better...

With all the rave reviews all I can think of is that maybe I did something wrong - I can't imagine what though - maybe I just wasn't in the mood but I won't be making this again.

This came out very nice. I didn't add the cream because I am trying to cut out as much dairy as possible, which isn't easy. It tasted just fine without it. Everyone had seconds because I made a lot of steaks.
