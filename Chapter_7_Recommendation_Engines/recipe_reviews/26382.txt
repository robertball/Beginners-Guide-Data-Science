If you like the chicken enchilada soup form Chili's, then you will love this! For those of you who are unclear, masa harina is just a corn flour (similar to corn meal but ground much finer) and you can find it at your local grocery store.  If you can find the masa, then definitely make this soup! You will not be disappointed.

This is everything you look for in a recipe; easy, quick, delicious and reheatable. It tastes exactly like an enchilada. 
I added chipotle pepper, halved the cheese, and used barbecue chicken breast I already had cooked from last night, which saved on the time. 
FOR THE MASA HARINA HATERS:
When mixing the masa with the water, whisk a little at a time into your water (about a tablespoon at a time) very quickly, until it is all dissolved. This gives it a much smoother consistency and alleviates the grittiness.

Karen, I want to thank you so much for this recipe. It's been a while since a new recipe wowwed me like this one did & my beau just raved about it. Awesome stuff, he said. As usual, I made some adjustments & additions but the recipe, as written, proved to be a great foundation.
I took a chance & found a more than adequate substitute for the 'gritty' masa to thicken the soup. Other recipes mentioned using torn up unfried corn tortillas (I used about 5 small tortillas-probably few more next time). I don't have a need for any extra masa so the tortillas worked beautifully. They practically dissolve, giving a lovely texture. Be sure to add additional cup or so of liquid. It can be stock, water, V-8 or beer, of course. I may try tequila...I encourage all of you non-gritties to please give this recipe another chance nixing the masa for tortillas. Trust me & Karen.
According to our tastes, I added sauteed onions, chopped fresh jalapenos, black beans, corn & I added some red cayenne pepper, about 1/3 tsp. Be careful-cayenne is hot so add sparingly. It really wakes up the flavor & it makes your tummy warm & happy. Souper Recipe (ha)! 5 Yums Up!

This was excellent! I, like others, could not find "Masa Harina", so I bought something called Maseca......it's what you make corn tortillas out of, and it worked great, it really gave it that authentic Mexican flavor. Next time I will definately use all chicken broth instead of water. It would be great adding a can of tomatoes or green chilies....it's so versatile you can do anything to it! We topped ours with extra shredded cheese & sour cream.......yummy!

Absolutely fantastic recipe!!!  And additional thanks to the reviewer who suggested using corn tortillas instead of masa harina.  I've used six tortillas and I've used 10.  It's all good. The right enchilada sauce makes all the difference; for authenticity I recommend Las Palmas medium or hot red sauce, if you can find it.  I grew up with this stuff in Southern California, and although harder to find back east it's still possible.  The enchilada sauce-to-water ratio is spot-on as long as you select a quality sauce.  Don't be afraid to use more garlic, 4 or 5 cloves is about right with half of a large onion.  I made this recipe a few different times, and I discovered that you do not need to add cheese during the cooking process.  It's really not necessary for thickness (the corn tortillas are), and the cheese just globs at the bottom and sticks to the pot.  Just add mild cheddar cheese with the rest of your garnish, fresher is better, and you require less cheese (healthier too).  A squeeze of lime in the bowl, some fresh cilantro, some thinly sliced jalapeno, etc., and you're in business!!! I've seen reviews where others keep adding more and more stuff (even beans and Velveeta), and it seems they are trying to create a thicker chile or a dip rather than soup. The goal should be an authentic, light, simple enchilada soup of top fresh quality, so use the right sauce to begin with, keep it light, and enjoy life without clogging your arteries.  Avocado salad makes a great side.

Please note...A+ recipe!  However, I used hot tamale sauce (isn't really that hot) and 1tsp of cumin instead of half to make it more authentic.  Also added a can of sweet corn to give the soup a bit more texture and finely chopped 1 large green pepper and one diced tomato to make it more colorful, add texture and more authentic.  I made this dish for myself and for my boyfriend who is Mexican.  Not only did both of us love it but I plan on making it once a week.

This is an awesome recipe!  Very close to Chile's Chicken Enchilada soup which is a favorite in our house.  To save time, I just throw the shredded chicken in with all the rest of the ingredients, bring it to a boil and then turn it down and let it cook.  We also cut up corn tortillas into very thin strips and bake them in the oven at 300 for 8 minutes.  Then we sprinkle grated cheese and the chips on top.  Very yummy!  We have made it tons of times!

I made this soup once before using the processed cheese, exactly as written in another recipe.  Everything is exactly the same except for the cheese and it was great.  This time I did as others suggested and used the whole 28 oz can of enchilada sauce and it was way too overpowering.  I used the cheddar cheese and it wasn't as good as velveeta.  It didn't incorporate into the soup as well.  Will have to throw it out and start over.

First off I want to say that I give this recipe 4 stars if made as written. I feel for my taste it needs a bit more spice than what the recipe calls for. I do want to add  that this is a great recipe that you can tweak to your own tastes and end up with a fabulous soup. I made as written the first time and while we liked it I felt it could be better, so I took the left over soup and added to it as some reviewers suggested 1 can of  rotel tomatoes, 1 can of mexicorn and added 1 additional tsp. of chili powder and 1/2 additional tsp of cumen. I also feel that 1 full cup of Masa Harina is too much, I will use 1/2 cup next time. Give this one a try you will not be disappointed! My Son said it tasted like Chili's only better with the additions. Thanks for sharing.

Even my husband, who doesn't like red enchilada sauce, loved this!  Three other "meat and potato" guys at work loved this!  I used 1c corn muffin mix and 1c all purpose flour because my neighborhood "mom and pop" store didn't have corn flour.  It worked beautifully because it thickened it immediately, I didn't have to simmer it for 30 min!!  I debated weather or not to purchase the cumin, and I'm so glad I did.  It really "made" the soup.  It was bland before I added it.  I didn't have the other spice, so I used 1 teaspon of the cumin.  YUMMY!

Ok, so I can see how some people thought this was bland, as I did at first, but I was determined to make it great. So, here is what I changed to make it what I condsider a five star recipe. First off, I read what others said about the soup being too thick with the full amount of masa suggested-so I prepared as noted, but only added a little at a time until I got just the right consistency. (Which turned out to be about half) I took suggestions on adding 1 can of corn and 1 can of black beans-both drained. I also added 1 small can of diced green chilis.I used one cup of shredded chedder and one cup of velveeta. (a litte more of either cheese would not hurt)I did NOT use any salt, but instead kept adding chicken boullion granules until I reached my desired flavor...and alas, it is DELICIOUS!! NOTE~I went to 3 stores in search of something that simplt stated "Masa Harina" just as the recipe calls, however, I found nothing that had both of those two words cleary printed on the package. I called a gentleman that I work with that is hispanic and he said what I needed was something called Maseca (that is the brand) and it is an instant corn masa mix. I hope you enjoy this recipe as much I my husband I and do...it seems to get better the longer it sits!

I was a little disappointed in the way this soup turned out. It had a unique flavor, yet it seemed to be missing something. Also, the masa made it a bit gritty. It was okay as a dip for our tortilla chips, but I would probably not make this again as a soup.

I made this exactly as written and it was delicious!  Tasted just like the soup made at the deli near where I work. I was able to find the masa and was really glad I did, think it "fleshed" the soup out really well and since I whisked it well with water prior to adding I didn't notice a grittiness some people seem to have. It thickened beautifully and the texture it created was what I would expect from a soup like this.  Only thing I'll change next time is to use a rotisserie chicken to save even more time.  And maybe add some tomotoes and/or black beans.  It'll be fun to experiment with, but this recipe is delish as-is. Thanks!

You can tear up corn tortillas instead of using masa harina, they will dissolve and ticken the soup.

Great.  I poached the chicken in the chicken broth and used salsa instead of enchilada sauce.

Better than Chili's! I used more chicken broth instead of water. I also added tomatoes & green pepper and used a mexi-cheese blend as well as added a can of mixed corn & black beans. I topped this with sour cream, green onions,l cheese, and tortilla strips.

I initially tried to make this as close to the original as possible, but ended up making some pretty hefty modifications to fit my taste.  I found it rather bland without any changes.  I boiled the chicken in broth for about 10 min (until no longer pink) and then shredded.  I used butter to saute the onion and garlic.  I cut back to the masa harina (corn flour)to 2/3 c, after reading other suggestions, and was glad i did.  it was plenty thick with that amount.  I don't liked canned sauce and after reading the ingredients (pureed tomatoes, chili powder, onion), I decided not to use it.  Instead, I used 20 oz of canned stewed tomatoes, pureed, in place of the enchilada sauce.  To make up for the spices in the sauce, i doubled the amount of chili powder, cumin, and added 1/4 tsp cayenne.  Check your chili powder ingred list, and adjust the salt level accordingly.  Mine contains salt, so I didn't add any extra to the soup.  I also waited to add the cheese after some questionable reviews, and I def think it needed it, although only half, and it really added flavor to the soup.  I think i ended up adding another c of broth to thin out the soup to my preferred texture.  My husband really enjoyed this with my changes.

I should say for this being the fist Enchilada soup i have made using masa it was really REALLY good, i loved the flavor, however, the recipe as it is is kind of bland - great base for a good soup with possibilities, next time i think i will add some veggies or something - very good but missing something

Tasted just like the soup at Chili's!! I followed other reviewer's advice with using less velveeta and roughly 19 oz of enchilada sauce and the results were out of this world. Cannot wait to make this again very soon!!

OMG This soup is so good and it does taste just like Chili's.  I doubled the recipe as I am taking it to a pot luck and of course so I can keep some for myself.  I didn't change a thing.  Thank you for such an awesome recipe.  Thanks again for such great recipes on this site.

I used green enchilada sauce for this recipe.  It was just as delicious as chicken enchilada soup that I had in a restaurant.  SOOOOOO easy and delicious!

I love this soup! This would also be a great enchilada sauce/gravy. I would just make this same recipe without the chicken and put the chicken and cheese in the enchilada. Yummy! I have already shared it with friends and they love it!

This soup was pretty yummy, although I did not make exactly as directed.  My changes included: cooking the chicken in about 3 tsp of taco seasoning, adding about 3/4 cup frozen sweet corn, 1 can of diced tomatoes, 1 can of black beans, and putting 1/2 can of green enchilada sauce and 1/2 can of red enchilada sauce.  Adding the addtional canned ingredients did make it a little salty, though so next time I would probably use reduced sodium chicken broth or add more water and less broth/bullion. I also followed advice of others and used bite sized corn tortilla pieces in place of the masa harina.  But I would definitely make again...maybe add some fresh avacado or green onion garnish!  Great on a cool winter evening!

I thought it was just okay. I am giving it 3 stars because without some additions from other comments it would have tasted bland.

I LOVE the Chicken Enchilada Soup at Chili's and I love this soup too!!  Used a very fine Masa Harina and mixed very well to avoid the gritty texture had by other users.  I also lightly seasoned my chicken with Sazon and a little adobo ( Goya) I used a mini chopper for the chicken which resulted in meat in every spoonful.  My boyfriend loved it and ate like a dip with tortilla chips and salsa.  Side note be sure to cook on low and continue to stir. Keep a watchful eye after you add the cheese and chicken.  Re-heats well and you can adjust the heat if you like it hot.  This one is a keeper!  Thanks

Very easy to make and very tasty!! I followed the recipe for the most part - I did add some chopped up jalepeno and chopped green bell pepper - we enjoyed the extra depth of spice and flavor!! Great recipe!! We will make this one again!!!

I love this soup! It tastes just like the one from Chili's. I used leftover rotisserie for my broth (cover the whole thing with water and boil) and for my shredded chicken. I used the masa harina, I had it from another recipe, but using the corn tortillas sounds like a great idea too. I will definitely be making this again!

My husband described this as "the kind of food that makes people jealous.  I'd hate to have to sit across from someone in the office at lunch and watch them eat it."  We eloped in Mexico and had some great local dishes, and we love to eat at authentic Mexican restaurants.  This tastes just like the real thing.  We topped it with sour cream and cheddar, and paired it with some warm corn bread and homemade spicy guacamole with tortilla chips. Excellent!

I made this for a Super Bowl party and it was a hit.  Everyone wanted the recipe!  I replaced the masa harina with 5-6 corn tortillas, sliced.  I added a jalapeno and a can each of black beans and corn.  Definitely will make this one numerous times.

Yummy! I rarely follow a recipe to the T, but for the most part I did on this one. Once I started tasting I added some salt and chili powder for a little extra zing. This really does taste like the Chili's soup, which is a favorite. I was going to go get it car-side tonight and found this first, yay! I did put tomatoes and green onions in as well as some cilantro (all as garnishes) with crumbled tortilla chips on top. YUMMY YUM YUM!

I loved this. I used leftover turkey and turkey broth. As other posters did, I added corn and beans to the mix and used one can of petite diced tomatoes and one can of rotel tomatoes. Will definitely make again.

Doubled the recipe, used 1 whole freshly roasted chicken, added 2 cans black beans with liquid, 1 can green enchilada sauce, 2-3 oz. chipotle pepper salsa, 4 oz chopped green chilis, omitted 1 cup water.  Topped with cheese, pico de gallo, and sour cream.  Better than the restaurant!!

Holy Enchilada Soup! This is FANTASTIC! The flavor was spot on, just perfect. I didn't have any problems with the masa harina... just whisked the water into the flour slowly. I used warmish water too, so that may have helped. I added a can of diced green chiles, a can of mexican corn, and a can of whole kernel corn. I also used a 'fiesta' cheese blend, which worked well. Thank you SO much, we loved this!

I really liked this! Not sure it tasted like an enchilada, but it was still tasty. I only used about half of the masa harina (added a little at a time and didn't need more than that), used chicken broth in place of water, and added some black beans and corn. Very tasty! Also, I used green enchilada sauce because I prefer it to red.

I did not have masa harina so I just crumbled like a dozen or so corn tortillas in the soup and they dissolved just fine. I also boiled my chicken instead of frying, I figured it works for chicken soup so why not enchilada soup. I just boil the chicken with chicken base, cumin garlic salt, onion powder, pepper and coriander. Sometimes I over boil a bit so it shreds easily, and always let it cool in its broth so its tender and juicy. I think that works out better so I have the fresh chicken broth, for more flavor I get some chicken bones from the meat market. 
Anyways I loved this combo it was a little spicy but so good, gave a bowl to my sister who usually sneers at my food and she enjoyed it. I will make again. (hope sister does not read reviews on this site, lol)

This was soooooooo good! I actually threw it all in my crockpot and just let it cook an high for 4 hours, then shredded the chicken towards the end and then replaced. I didn't have red enchilada sauce I hd green, so I used that instead band used all chicken broth with no water but everything else spot on and it was AMAZING! Thank you for such a great soup that my whole family loved! I have already passed the recipe on! We will make again!

So delicious - identical to Chili's.  I used all chicken broth instead of the water and added a can each of whole kernel corn (drained), black beans (rinsed and drained) and petie diced tomatoes (drained).  Also added 1/2 tsp dried cilantro.  Serve with tortilla strips, chunks of avocado and sour cream.  YUM!

This was great! I made it for a mexican themed dinner for company, and everyone wanted the recipe. I used the whole can (10 oz) of hot enchilada sauce, doubled the garlic and cumin, and added a dash of tobasco because there didn't seem to be enough spice for my taste. I also took other's advice and added a can of pureed tomatoes. I used Mexican Blend cheese simply because my grocery was out of cheddar shreds and it melted really nice and smooth. The only complaint I have with this recipe is that it was almost too thick. Next time I will either add only 3/4 cup masa harina or add more chicken broth.

It is so much easier if you use jarred pre-crushed garlic with parsley,2 pre-cooked Tyson diced chicken in a bag which I cut up more finely and used hot enchilada sauce, so all you have to do is add cumin and salt/pepper to taste.  Also, I used 2 cans of Campbells cheddar cheese soup instead of velveeta.  I also turned off the heat at the end and put a cup or so of finely shredded colby jack and let it melt smoothly into the soup, which thickened it up better.

This soup was ok, not great. The broth wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping and it really just seemed to be broth & chicken. Kind of plain and not much to it.

My kids beg for this all year round.  I add some frozen corn and a can of black beans to mine.  To save money I buy the bone in chicken and make my own broth.  It takes a little bit longer I can make the chicken the night before and store it.  I also add a can of Rotel.  We love the leftovers even more than the 1st night!

This is really tasty! I am going to make this over and over again. It's much easier than making actual enchiladas and tastes just as good. I roasted a whole chicken and used the breasts, it makes for very tender and juicy chicken and then you can use the rest of the chicken for something else. My husband gobbled this right up.

This was a very easy and delicious soup.  I used the medium enchilada sauce and it had just enough spice- not too much.  Very good on a dreary day!  And, it does taste very similar to the one at Chili's!!!!  Thank you!

Good stuff!  I was unable to find masa harina, but took the advice of others and used 7 small corn tortillas torn into small pieces.  I was a little worried that I'd have soggy chunks in the soup, but by the time the soup simmered the tortillas had totally disolved.  My family loved it!

Just made this for dinner and everyone loved it! After reading some of the other reviews I used a 1/2 cup of the masa harina, added a can a corn, a can of black beans, and a can of stewed tomatoes that I mashed up. I didn't have any enchilada sauce so I made my own using 2 cans small cans of tomato sauce, a small can of diced green chili's and about 2-3 tablespoons chili powder depending on how hot you want it and omitted the chili powder called for in the recipe. I also didn't have any cheddar cheese so I used a Mexican blend cheese from Aldi. Garnished it with some more cheese and a dollop of sour cream and it was amazing!

Fantastic!! The only thing I did different was add 1 can of Rotel petite diced tomatoes w/lime and cilantro and used 8-10 oz of velveeta.  I served it with a few crushed tortilla chips and a pinch of shredded cheese on top. If you like Chili's chicken enchilada soup you will not be disappointed. Thanks for sharing!

Awesome!  Followed recipe exactly...did use the corn tortillas hand crushed with the 2cups of water instead of the masa harina...i
1 tsp Extra of Cumin and the 1 cup water at end of recipe I did chicken broth...AWESOME!  
Don't be adding  to the soup until you taste this first...Then add if needed (which you won't)
tortilla strips, tom, and cilantro (all in can)  add on top for garnish
AWESOME!

Awesome! Tastes almost exactly like Chilis soup. We used 1 lb of Velveeta in the soup instead of the cheddar cheese because we had it, but we still garnished with cheddar on top. I'll be making this recipe many more times in the future!

This is the same recipe as chicken enchilada soup II and the top secret recipe on the internet for "Chili's chicken enchilada soup." The only difference is this has cheddar cheese instead of Velveeta all other ingredients exactly the same and in the same portion. If you love Chili's soup you will like this. Although, I suggest if you want something more similar to use the Velveeta in the copycat recipe. Although, myself I wouldn't mind trying it next time with cheddar cheese as we added it to the tops of our bowls anyway along with tomatoes, green onions, and tortilla strips like the restaurant.

this soup had lots of flavor...i followed the directions to the letter and it ended up just very VERY thick.  the first bowl wasn't too bad, but the next day i tried heating up some for lunch and it was more like peanut butter, so thick!  any suggestions on how to fix this?  i loved the flavor, and i'd love to be able to go back and give it 5 stars!  maybe simmer less time?  or use less masa harina?  will definitely make this again, but will tweak a bit.

made the following changes and it was amazing!  for cheese used 8oz of cheddar and pepper jack, chopped the chicken up until it was very fine, used 3/4 cup of masa harina (or something similar), omitted the 3 cups of water (added the masa harina after I had added everything and brought it to a boil), used one bottle of trader joes enchilada sauce, used 2 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, added 1 can green chilis, corn, 2 cans of black beans and diced tomatoes, then at the end stirred in a small container of sour cream and served.  It was very thick but I like thick soups so it was perfect to me!  Yielded enough to serve 10! Will definitely make again!

Really yummy! Has a nice smokey flavor...being the genius I am, I put 1 can of enchilada soup (I think 12 oz?) instead of 1 cup so I added a little more mesaca mix and it turned out perfectly fine! also added some corn

LOVED this recipe!!  Here were my changes:  I used 2 12/5 ounce canned chicken breast that I fried briefly with the garlic and onions.  I used 1/2 an onion, 1 10 oz  can of medium enchilada sauce, 1 tsp cumin instead of 1/2, 1 can of black beans, drained, one 4 oz can of green chiles, and pepper to taste.  The salt and chili powder I kept as normal.  I did not use the masa harina or the 3 cups water, and did not add the cheese into the soup, but served the soup with shredded cheese, tortilla chips, and sour cream.  It was SO GOOD!!!  I will DEFINITELY make this again.

This was good. I took another reviewers suggestion and added torn up corn tortillas instead of masa harnia,  so that my soup would be gluten free. The cook complete down and worked wonderful as suggested. Thanks for that suggestion. Perfect!

This soup was wonderful.  Some tips for the masa flour is to mix it with cold water and let it set while you are making everything else.  Continuing to stir it occasionally.  My soup was very creamy.  Also when using cheddar cheese you do not want the soup to be boiling when you add it.  That can make cheddar cheese separate.  Keep the temp. to a medium to low heat for the 30 to 40 minutes.

This was really great!  I was worried about the possibility of grittiness but mine wasn't at all.  I bought a rotisserie chicken and shredded that to save time and also used 50% reduced fat cheddar.  It was very thick (almost stew-like) so I added an extra cup of water with some boullion to thin it.  I also added the drippings from the chicken.  Delicious!

My family loves this soup.  We like to add black beans, corn and stewed tomatoes.  If you have picky eaters, you can serve the corn and beans on the side along with sour cream and tortilla chips or Fritos.

I loved it. I made a few adjustments: I used Chicken broth instead of water for the entire recipe, and added an extra cup of that and enchilada sauce because I used 4 chicken breasts and one whole white onion. I put in 1 tsp each of coriander seed and cayenne pepper. I also added in a can of Rotel Extra Hot tomatoes and a handful of white corn at the end of cooking. I served it with more shredded cheddar and some green onions on top and Tostitos on the side. Amazing!

I was really impressed with how easy and good this recipe was. I followed the recipe exactly, other than adding black beans and corn, and it turned out great. The kids loved it and asked to have it for lunch today. Was really good with fresh pico de gallo as a garnish.

Yum. I like it less thick and more spicy. So half the masa harina and double the chili powder and cumin.  Also I made it with a homemade enchilada sauce by adding 2-3 tbsp chili powder, 1 8oz can tomato paste, 1-2 cups of water.  Every one loved it!

To make this a little heartier I added some canned corn, black beans, and green chilies.  I make this quite often for about 20 people, but have to change the servings to about 30 because everyone goes back for more!!!

I had a hard time finding the masa harina.  I found a Goya brand product called Masarica which is instant corn dough mix.  I think it's the same thing.  I hope the information helps make it easier to find!

This is one of my favorite soups. However I realize that as written it's a 4 star recipe. To make it 5 star I add frozen corn and black beans. I also use a mixture of cheeses depending on what I have on hand, but usually Colby jack and cheddar. I usually add more seasonings than called for (to taste). Make sure to whisk the masa harina thoroughly to avoid grittiness. Top it with any combination of pico de gallo, cilantro, shredded cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips. It then goes from good to great.

Great as written but too spicey for my hubby. In place of masa I used 4 corn tortias soaked in hot water then whirled in blender.  Added a can of cream of chicken soup, also a can of cheese soup (instead of grated cheese) plus added black beans. It simmered up into a wonderful hearty enchilada soup that my husband really enjoyed (myself included!).

It was wonderful... I did make a few changes.  I used the entire 10 oz. can of enchilada sauce, 2 cloves of garlic (you can never have too much!), about 2/3 cup of onion.  At the end I felt it needed a bit of color and zip.  In went a can of RoTel petite diced tomatoes with green chilies,undrained...and it was the magic touch. My husband gave this a DOUBLE thumbs up! He loves the Chili's version, but says this was even better.

Incredible soup. Followed it exactly, with the exception of adding 1/2 can of rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies to add a little more spice. Tastes incredible and is EXACTLY like the soup we usually order at Chili's! We will be making this at least once a week from now on.

Oh my, was this delicious.  Like another reviewer, I served this to my meat-and-potato-loving husband and teen son, who raved about how wonderful it was. I had to substitute thighs for the breasts, and I was worried about being out of cumin.  But it still turned out great.

This was a very good soup as written.  I did make a few changes the second time I made it, which I thought made it even better.  I added about a cup of finely chopped green pepper and about a cup or a little more of whole kernel corn.  Instead of the masa harina, I bought a package of small corn tortillas.  I tore up about ten of them into very tiny pieces, simmered them in a pan with just enough water to cover them.  Once softened, I stirred them and they dissolved.  I then put the mix into the soup and it was perfect.  I also used more chicken stock and less water.

Our new favorite soup!  I am in Ireland and could not get masa harina, so I crushed (pulverised) tortilla chips in it's place and left out the additional salt :)  When the onions and garlic were browned I mixed the tortilla chip crumbs in to the pan, then I added the broth and remaining ingredients.   Family loved it :)

The soup was much better then the restuarant one we recently had - we could not find enchilada sauce so used Taco sauce - adding the cheese was tricky but came out ok - we did not have ground cumin but added more chilli powder - he added hot sauce to his bowl and loved it - we will be making it again

Simple and easy way to get a solid chicken enchilada soup. I actually found it better the next day because it was thicker.  Thanks for the recipe.

Loved this recipe!  I followed other suggestions by just using corn tortillas as a thickener.  I also doubled chili powder and cumin.  This was delicious, and loved by all!

Overall it was a little bland for my taste.  I served topped with sour cream, shredded cheese and crushed tortilla chips.  My 4 year old asked me to always make it for her.  She's gobbling it up now and just exclaimed, "It's all gone".  Guess I'll get off the computer and refill her bowl.  Thanks for sharing.

I was searching for a recipe to use the masa harina I bought by accident instead of the regular flour tortilla mix (moral - don't shop in a hurry and read the entire package label.) I will make this again (and again.) I made it as written and it is excellent. Next time I will likely use homemade enchilada sauce from a recipe on this site to cut the cost a little. We ate it as soon as it was done and it was good; we ate some more a few hours later and it was superb - a little age is this recipe's friend.

It almost tasted the way I wanted it to taste, just not quite.  I wouldn't change anything about the recipe.  Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for soup.

This started out a 3 for me but I feel certain that was due to the masa I used, maybe it was off, I know it had been around a while.  I had the soup again the next night and the "masa" flavor had mellowed and all other flavors improved greatly.  I used a medium enchilada sauce, 4 cloves of garlic and all homemade chicken stock/no water. I will try again with fresh/new masa and will also try with only tortillas to thicken. I also plan to do this with beef stock and use Mijo's Slow Cooker Shredded Beef for a beef enchilada soup.

We love, love, loved it!!  I doubled the recipe and I used all chicken broth and used 2- 10 oz. cans of enchiladas sauce.  I really thought that it would be a little redder, but was a really water down orange color.  So I had one issue w/ it.  When it came to the masa...  I made it and put it inthe soup and it came out the clumpy mess.  So I run it through my blender so it came out a little creamier.  Unfortunately, w/ the heat and liquid, pressure built up and blew my lid and burnt the livin'  out of my arm and legs.  But that's my fault!  I then put the soup in my crock pot for 3 hours so it made my house small SO good!  Thanks for sharing this.  My family will enjoy it for years to come.  In fact, I will be making it for our Christmas Eve dinner!

This is really good!  I didn't have any Masa Harina, so I used 6 corn tortillas cut up and they worked well.  But, don't even try it without Cumin.  I was out, so I had my husband pick up some on the way home.  I made the soup and tasted it.  Without the Cumin, it was flat.  There was a major piece missing.  I added double the amount of Cumin called for and it was delicious!  Oh, I also added a little Cayenne Pepper to spice it up a bit.  My husband loved it too, and he's picky about soups.

I decided to give this a try since I had all the ingredients on hand (yes, even the masa harina from when I made tamales for my husbands birthday).  I found the taste good but lacking something.  I added some extra cumin, salt, chili powder and a can of drained corn.  I fried tortilla strips and seasoned those with garlic salt and cumin.  Those I used as toping.  I also added a bit more cheese.  Although I found the flavor very good it did turn out a bit gritty.  I'll definately use this recipe again since it was so good but I'll continue to tweak it as I go.  Thanks for sharing!

Loved this soup, and it is so easy to make! I made tortilla strips to garnish it by cutting up corn tortillas into strips and frying them (letting them dry on paper towels). I made a double batch of it for a party where someone else made a pot of soup as well. My pot of soup was almost gone while hers was still full at the end of the party! It was a hit!

This soup was good but seemed to be missing something, although I don't know what.  It ended up being a little too thick, and not all that spicy.  We picked the chicken out of the leftovers, wrapped it in tortillas and used the soup as sauce and ended up with enchiladas the next night.  Actually it seemed better and more like a complete meal that way.

I could just repeat another reviewer: "YUM. 'Nuff said!" :-)  But I'll elaborate.  I don't like pieces of onion in stuff like this so used my usual onion powder, but otherwise made as is, including the enchilada sauce measured as called for.  I love stuff like this, and I love it even better when it's really good.  I save the 5's for the really good stuff and almost wish I could give it a 6.  Oh, I did use fat free cheddar and never noticed the difference.  This thickens easily -- this is my first time using masa.  So I'd say watch it on cooking it for too long.  I also didn't much see the point of browning the chicking first -- I thought this made it difficult to shred.  Next time I'll try just cooking it in the microwave first.  Thanks for the recipe -- great stuff.

This recipe was great! However, I was looking for a heartier soup so I added a few things: one can of black beans, one can of yellow corn, fresh cilantro, and one pack of cooked spanish rice. Served it with tortilla chips...will make again!

Yum! This soup is just what I was looking for! I doubled this recipe to serve at a bible study... I used half of the masa harina and added a can of black beans and a can of mexican rotel. It was so yummy. Thanks for sharing!

THIS WAS THE BEST.  VERY EASY.  EVEN A VERY PICKY DAUGHTER LIKED IT.  I USED MED. HOT ENCHILADA SAUCE A WHOLE ONION EXTRA GARLIC AND A MIX OF JACK AND CHEDDAR.  I TOPPED IT WITH CHOPPED GREEN ONIONS AND JACK CHEESE.

I didn't have masa harina, but used 1/2 c corn meal and 1/2 c regular flour. It seemed to work well, because the soup tasted great. My husband and I both liked it a lot. The only thing is that DH felt it needed a little more substance, so I added a can of beans. That made it great for him.

4 19 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/26382/chicken-enchilada-soup-iii/ ... Yes, some subs, but the base flavor was the same - although that would vary with your enchilada sauce. To the point: It needs more; more chicken, flavors & spices. It needs more "action"! :D I subbed tacoseasoned ground pork, homemade mashed potatoes (for the masa harina), homemade chicken broth & only 2 1/2c of it, no water. I added a bit more than 2c diced tomatoes with liquid, 1c frozen corn. & a cup of rice. In each bowl, sour cream & sliced olives as well as the cheddar cheese. 'Glad I made it & can fix it up. 'Doubt I'll make it again though - unless I have leftover chicken, enchilada sauce & chicken broth to use up again. K said ""eh, okay" when I made it; a week & half later, she brought up having it. Huh? One more star granted. ~ Thanks for tracking down my review, Sis!  :)

I really enjoyed this soup. I cut my chicken breasts into bite size pieces and I used a whole small can of enchilada sauce (didn't want to waste the rest of it). Next time I will shred the chicken (to see if I like it better than bite size pieces) and I will cut the masa harina to only 1/2 cup. Very good comfort soup!

A little spicy for me (even with mild enchilada sauce).  I think I would do this again with 1/2 tsp chili powder instead of the full tsp.  Alternately, as a side dish this much spice would be fine, but as a main it just has too much time to build heat (at least for those of us who are relatively sensitive to heat).

I actually did this in the crock pot. I placed a frozen chicken breast into crockpot, then added everything  but cheese and masa harina. I just added the masa harina and cheddar cheese after 5 hours on low. Once I added the masa harina and cheese I let it cook abt half hour on low. Tasted awesome! I added salsa, cilantro, corn chips and more cheese on top! Will def make again.

We love this recipe!  It is fantastic!  It is very close to Chili's recipe.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY as is except for I increased the chili powder and cumin amounts to add spiciness and depth of flavor.  We add shredded cheese and tortilla chips to garnish and eat with.  Many reviews speak of using processed cheese and adding a ton of other ingredients like beans and corn.  I specifically was looking for recipe that did not have all these other ingredients nor processed products.  This recipe does not need all the extra stuff!  I cook mostly from scratch and the least amount of processed foods as possible but I do use a 10 oz. can of Las Palmas medium Enchilada Sauce.  It has the best flavor and least amount of added ingredients.  I also use homemade chicken stock and usually use chicken I have already cooked off in the crock pot.  Living in Texas, I have no issue finding masa harina or maseca, but when my bag runs out, I will buy organic next time.  This soup is not too thick, I just don't understand the comments about that.  Follow the directions correctly and the soup turns out perfect.  I am so glad for this recipe; we can have 6 bowls of this soup made at home for the cost of just 1 bowl at Chili's.

I love the chicken enchilada soup at Chili's and I have to agree that this was pretty close to theirs. I modified the recipe slightly and it was still delicious. First, I didn't have canned enchilada sauce, so I made my own. I am Mexican and I learned to make my grandmother's enchilada sauce recipe. I boiled two dry California chiles in enough water to cover them. I added salt and powdered garlic to the chiles and brought them to a boil. I then removed the stems and put the chiles and water in the blender and puréed them. I strained the chiles to remove any leftover seeds and skin. I put the hot liquid back into the blender and added the masa harina. I blended the mixture and that resulted in a base that was not at all gritty. It was perfectly smooth. The only thing I won't repeat is that I didn't have cheddar cheese on hand. So, I substituted with mozzarella. That didn't add the flavor balance needed for this recipe. I will definitely make this again and make sure to have a sharper cheese on hand.

I found this recipe today, and made it tonight.  On it's own, it was good, but somewhat boring if you really love the Mexican favors.. After I made it, according to the recipe, I added some ingredients, and took other reviewers advice. I did use corn tortillas to thicken it, and add that special flavor. Black beans, pinto beans, and some whole kernel corn added to the body of the soup. I had no canned enchilada sauce, so used 1 1/2 pkg.'s of dry mix. I added some sliced jalapeños and cilantro. Hot sauce, fresh cilantro, fresh limes,  corn chips, and cheddar cheese, were served on the side. We're having this again tomorrow, and I'll add sliced avacados as another side. I've never made enchilada soup before, and this was a great recipe to start with.  Thank you for sharing.

Substituted extra fine ground corn meal for the masa harina and doubled the recipe. It was great on our first cold day this fall...and definitely made it into rotation!

I used already cooked rotisserie chicken shredded in this recipe in place of the chicken and doubled the entire recipe because I have a large family.  It was the best chicken enchilada soup I have ever had including chicken enchilada soup ordered at restaurants!  If you like enchiladas, you will love this soup!

If you like Chili's popular soup, I think you will like this recipe.  I had very good luck with it.  I prefer to bake my chicken wrapped in a little foil and shred it so that is how I prepared it for this recipe.  I also used an extra can of chicken broth instead of the cup of water to add to the soup. I had mild enchilada sauce so I added extra chili powder and a little red pepper to give the soup a little more kick. Mesa de Harina is easy to find where I live and I often use it to thicken and add flavor to our favorite chili.  I gradually added the Mesa to the 2 cups of water and whisked it until it was smooth.  I gradually added the Mesa/Water mixture to the soup and whisked the soup in the pot. I added the entire amount but you could easily omit some of it if the soup becomes too thick.  I did not have any problems with the texture being too gritty as mentioned in some of the less favorable reviews.  I did not add the shredded cheese, allowing everyone to add it to their individual bowls of soup.

After having the Chicken Enchilada Soup at Chili's, I decided to see if I could make it. I saw a review that said this was like Chili's and they were right! Delicious! I read the reviews and did as they suggested. I never used Masa in my life,so used the tip that said to whisk the masa one tablespoon at a time into the water until dissolved (instead of plopping all the masa in at once) so I wouldn't end up with grainy soup. I also used one cup of velveta and one cup of Cheddar. I gave some of the soup to my daughter's family and they raved about it! Great recipe, quick and easy to make!

So good!  I omitted the salt and used velveeta instead of cheddar, then topped with cheddar, sour cream, avocado, and crushed tortilla chips to serve. Also used all lower sodium chickem broth instead of water.  Awesome!

I made this soup on Sunday, and am making it again tonight.  It was so good! I love Chili's Chicken Enchilada Soup (but cant get it too often as it is pretty pricey), but this recipe turned out BETTER THAN CHILI'S!  Took the advice of other posters and used corn tortillas (sliced and diced about 9 of them) instead of masa harina, and most of them just dissolved into the soup.  Also used mostly chicken stock, but it was extremely salty. Tonight, I'll use more of the water called for in the original recipe.  Added a can of black beans and corn, and diced half a bellpepper.  As suggested by readers, I doubled up on the spices and added the cheese last.  I basically turned off the pot and stirred in the cheese and it melted immediately and did not lump or string.  I thought the soup was PERFECT before adding the cheese!  It can definitely stand on its own.  I sliced and diced the chicken breast as they were partially frozen;doing so made it so much easier to slice, and I seasoned to my liking before cooking it.  Though I forgot to buy some while at the store, I think a dollop of sour cream will be the perfect end to this soup.  I do plan on adding some veggies to bulk the soup up a bit.  This recipe rocks, and I will be making it again and again!

Pretty good, but I recommend adding two husked, diced small tomatillos(green tomatoes), A can of black beans, and a can of diced tomatoes, and 2 jalepenos with their seeds, and two chipotle peppers.  This makes it taste PERFECT, and also gives you a lot more soup.

wow! i made this for the first time yesterday and it is for sure a keeper! i didnt have the masa harina and couldn't make it to the store so instead i used regular all purpose flour and instead of mixing the one cup of flower with 2 cups of water, i used a cup of water and a cup of the liquid in canned corn.  I also added the corn and it turned out amazing.  I am tempted to try it with the masa harina but it was so good without it i don't really see the need to.  Thank you so much for this awesome soup!

I used meat from two turkey legs that I cooked in the crockpot overnight (really cost effective--you get about 8 legs for around four dollars and that will make about 4 pots worth of meat!) and homemade turkey broth. I used homemade enchilada sauce (Texas Enchilada Sauce) and only used a little masa harina, as I'm trying to watch my carbs. I did load up this soup with red pepper and chopped zucchini to add in more veggies. Tasty soup!

Yummy. We used 2 can sof black beans, 1 can cream corn, 1 can rotel, 1 can jalapenos and 1 can green chiles. I used between 2 and three cups of stock and 1/2 cup masa. Upped all of the spices and used double the enchilada sauce. Leftovers were served with some mexican rice mixed in.

Ive tried similar recipes like this over the years & this is by far the best! I did make some adjustments to it tho, maybe youll find them helpful. I doubled all the spices including the Cumin, not the recipe. I used HOT enchilada sauce & withheld adding the cheese until the end as a garnish. I added green chillies & 1 tsp cayenne. I used the recommended amount of MASECA (masa harina, Kroger $1.59) and disolved it in 3 cups HOT water prior to adding it to soup base,and still adding an additional 1 c. water (a total of 4 c.) this kept the flavor but thinned out the consistency & kept it from getting a "gritty" texture. Best soup Ive ever had! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

a little bland however adding a little hot sauce and definately add some toppings... Sour cream, green onions, jalapenos...  It really is an authentic South of the boarder dish.

Yummy!  The taste was fab.  A friend and I truly enjoyed this. Next time I make this (and there will be a next time - soon), I will use less masa - it was VERY thick.  I also used enchilada sauce with green chilies, so it gave it just the right amount of kick.  I don't like anything hot or spicy, so this was just right. I also used all chicken broth, no water.  Thanks for the recipe - it was sooooooo tasty!

Used this recipe for our church Valentine's Banquet.  Over half of the 80+ attendees requested this soup and absolutely RAVED about it.  Now they are asking me for the recipe.  Mostly followed the directions - did add some diced tomatoes (was trying to stretch it) but overall TWO THUMBS UP!

I followed the recipe and had a taste and found that it was pretty bland. So then I began to add some more flavor and ended up with a fabulous soup! I added 1/4 c enchilada sauce, 1 c cheese, 1 c broth and a little salt and pepper. In addition to adding flavor the broth thinned out the masa harina a bit which was initially way too thick. This is a great recipe once you kick up the flavor a little. I served tortilla chips and chopped tomato to add as well as avocado slices on the side. Yum!

I love the texture of this recipe. Masa is not hard to find and is very inexpensive. I like my food spicy so I also added 2 4oz. can of hot diced jalapenos. I will make this again and again.

Loved it (and totally wasn't expecting to)! I halved the recipe and I wish I'd made the whole batch now.  I cut the chicken into chunks (to give the seasoned parts more surface area) and seasoned with creole seasoning.  Sauted and then sliced into small bite sized pcs.  I used Mrs. Espy's Enchiliada Sauce (from this site).  I had no issues with the masa - yes, it was gritty at first but the 30 minute simmer time takes care of that. The soup turns thick with a slight corn flavor. I added a diced potato and let it simmer the full 30 minutes just to give it a little more substance (I wanted to have something to chew on).  Next time I think I'll add some frozen corn.  Great recipe, will definitely make again.

I liked this, it's very flavorful. When I was commenting that it was really good my kids said "it's chicken & cheese, mom". I agree with others that it might need a few more ingredients, but it's a tasty broth. I didn't have Masa so I threw in about 10 corn tortillas while the chicken broth was boiling. Used way more garlic & cut up the chicken to make it easier to cook. Thanks for the recipe!

I gave this 4 starts only because I had to add so much to it. I added corn, diced tomatoes, and 1 can of black beans. Without these 3 ingredients the flavor would still have been fantastic, but the soup would not have been hearty enough for my family. Other than that the flavor was fabulous. I will make again.

I made this tonight and it is super yummy! I did sub one of the cups of water for chicken broth just cause I had to open a flipping can for 4 oz so I didn't want it to go to waste same with the enchilada sauce I used the whole can just cause it left me with almost another cup left over. I will be making this again..

I too got hooked on this - and this recipe was very good.  I made some simple changes to mine based on the other reviews and my own personal liking.  I boiled my chicken in chicken broth (to avoid oil) and then added chopped red potatoes (I like hearty soups) and I used 1 16oz. of velveeta cheese and then topped it with shredded cheese when serving. The one change I would do is 1/2 the Masa and water mixture - to me...it was just too much.  I can't wait to make this for my husband when he comes home from war.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I doubled the recipe because I was cooking for a crowd and used 1 can of mild and 1 can of hot enchilada sauce, if making just a single batch I would definitely use just the hot.  I also used other reviewers advise and used only chicken broth, no water.  It was well worth the search for masa harina.  Chilies, tomatoes, or corn could easily be added to this soup.  Excellent....had to give the recipe out to our guests.

Creamy, thick, hearty, filling.
No problems with masa harina- liked the heavy feeling it gave.
Could use some more color- will try adding chopped cilantro on top.
Added corn and diced tomatoes- very nice.
I didn't feel that this froze well.  I recommend eating fresh or within a day or two.

This soup is so yummy! I made this for a fight night party to go along with some other spanish inspired appetizers and it won raving reviews from our friends! I didn't change a thing and neither should you because this soup totally rocks as is!! Thank you so much for this recipe! I have been looking for a recipe to compare with the Enchilada soup from Chili's and must say that this works perfect!

I tried this tonight at the last minute - oh my goodness was it delicious.  Hearty and filling, my husband raved over it, and he is very hard to please.  I followed the recipe to the T and thank goodness I bought the masa flour, it wouldn't have tasted anything without that actual "enchilada" flavor.  Thank you so much this is a keeper.

Great soup! I used chopped rotisserie chicken breast, finely ground Juanita's brand tortilla chips for the masa harina, and added a can each of corn, black beans and diced tomatoes with green chilies. I also used all chicken stock and no water, but I did use the liquid in the canned veggies. I also prefer to make enchilda sauce from a packet, as it tends to be milder than the canned sauce. Next time I'll only use half the chili powder or regular diced tomatoes (no chilies.) Something made this spicy, but hubs & son loved it!  Garnish with crushed Juanita's brand tortilla chips, sour cream, grated cheese and green onions. Wow! I'm taking this to a teacher's luncheon tomorrow.

Excellent recipe. I added a little more (an additional 1/2 tsp) of chili powder. Used the entire 10 oz. can of enchilada sauce. Used only chicken broth in place of the water, and added a dice jalapeno to the onion/garlic mixture. It was spicy - just how I like it. Great recipe.

Took this to a church soup supper and have been asked to bring it again. Right before serving I add 1 can kidney beans, drained, and 1 can corn, drained. Try serving with add-ins like hot sauce, chopped cilantro, chopped tomatoes, tortilla strips and shredded cheddar. People enjoy customizing to their taste! I've referred many to this recipe at AllRecipes.

This soup was delicious.  I pretty much followed the recipe.  It had a great flavor and consistency (not at all gritty).  I served it over a few crushed tortilla chips.  Really hit the spot on a cold December night.

This was pretty good, but I wouldn't say "wow" so I gave it 4 stars. I would repeat it, however. I might make it when my inlaws are here for T'giving. I added pinto beans, chopped jalapenos, and sour cream. I felt like it needed a little something extra. I tried it with and without the added ingredients. In my opinion, the soup tasted better with the added ingredients.

I cut this recipe in half, but used almost a pound of chicken. Instead of baking the chicken, I boiled it in very low sodium chicken broth and a few tablespoon of salsa. After taking out the chicken, I used that broth in the recipe. I used way less cheese than called for, and it was low fat...this cuts way down on the fat and calories...And it was still great! Definately use low sodium chicken broth b/c this was still a salty dish.

added more garlic and a serrano pepper and used about a cup less water for a thicker soup.  It was delicious, everyone loved it and it was so easy.

Excellent. Tasted just like the soup from Chili's. I usually do not like onions, so I blended them in my "magic bullet" and with the juices from the onions, the flavor was awesome. Great soup-quick and easy.

This was good, but I had to add another cup of enchilada sauce and more water because it was so thick and pasty without it. Good flavor though.

Absolutely loved this soup.  I had been looking for something that tasted like menudo with posole and this was definitely the taste I was looking for.  So thick and rich... definitely a keeper.

This was EXCELLENT! I did the one change of using the 28 oz. can of enchilada sauce instead of the small can and a cup of water. I also didn't measure the chili powder or cumin but just dusted it into the soup. So very good! I had company and they raved about it too! I served it with a dollop of sour cream and tortilla chips. This is a keeper!

GREAT RECIPE, BUT I ADDED A CAN OF DRAINED YELLOW CORN AND A CAN OF RINSED AND DRAINED BLACK BEANS FOR EXTRA TEXTURE AND HEARTINESS!
ALSO, USE THIS RECIPE WITH THE BEANS AND CORN AS A SAUCE OVER COOKED SHELL PASTA AND TOP WITH COJACK CHEESE FOR A GREAT PASTA DISH.

This is great soup.  I cut down on the cheese to lower the fat/calorie content, but then served some on the side in case anyone wanted more cheese.  With fried tortilla chips and sour cream, this is definitely restaurant quality.  I did make my own enchilada sauce, also from a recipe on this site.

Excellent and it was so easy to prepare. I used all broth, no water (only because I thought my broth not flavorful enough). I will definitely try it again and am curious how it would taste using a green enchilada sauce,omitting the chili powder and adding fresh cilantro. Oh & hubby said "oooh, doesn't sound good" when I told him about it and was quite surprised to find out that he really liked the soup!  "tastes like an enchilada, ummmm, this is good!" Thanks for the recipe (I love it when he's wrong! lol)!

The masa harina really gave the soup an authentic enchilada flavor.  It was easy to put together and was delicious on a cold winter night.

Overall this was really good, but I don't think the extra salt is necessary (and i love salt). I added about half a can of pureed tomato, and used mexican cheese cheddar jack cheese. I think that with the spices adds all the flavor you need. I've had this soup before in Arizona and other mexican joints here and there, and I find this recipe to be right up there. I'll be making it again, adjusting the salt content. Thanks!

Wow! This is SO good and very "authentic" tasting. I made a couple minor changes - suggestions from other reviewers: I used the "Mexican" blend of shredded cheese, garlic powder (I didn't have any garlic cloves on hand), I used 1 c of chicken broth instead of that 3rd cup of water, and closer to 1 tsp of ground cumin. I coudn't find that masa harina (and I was in an authentic Mexican grocery!) so I used something called Maserica (?) - it was instant corn tortilla flour. I also used closer to 3/4 cup of that mixed with the 2 cups of water. Very delicious! I'm going to add some black beans to my bowl, as my husband won't eat it if I would add those to the whole pot! Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Tastes just like tamales!  My husband said "you could make a million bucks" with this - he loved it.  I was concerned about the cheese curdling, but followed recipe exactly and it seemed to turn out well (use a good cheese that melts well - I used medium Tillamook).  I might try stirring the cheese in at end of cooking next time and see how it is.

IT WAS GREAT..ALTHOUGH I DID ADD MORE GARLIC AND SPICE.  I AM GOING TO TRY THIS NEXT WITH PORK, GREEN ENCHILADA SAUCE AND GREEN CHILES.  IT WOULD BE MORE LIKE TORTILLA SOUP OR JUST GREEN CHILE STEW. MAKES ME LONG FOR NEW MEXICO!!

i did like this soup, however i wanted to scale it down for less servings. the recipe called for half the liquid, but their conversion turned soup into sludge. i added 1/2 cup water and 1/2 broth. turned out great. just be careful if scaling it down

This was delicious!  My family loved it.  I added a little bit more chili powder to make it spicier.  Perfect the way it is, but you can add hominy for variety.

Delicious soup!  It does taste just like the soup from the restaurant.  It is definitely worth the small amount of extra time it takes to saute the chicken, then shred it.  It adds to the flavor of the soup.  Thanks for the recipe!

Kind of bland if following the recipe. I like a bit of spice so I added additional Chili powder, Cayenne pepper and garlic salt all to taste. I also added a second can of enchilada sauce and a can of rinsed black beans. Then topped with homemade tortilla strips sprinkled with salt and chili powder, pico I made and cheese. Perfect!! Will add more chicken next time. Thank you for sharing!

I had a chicken enchilada soup at Lunardi's and it tasted like an chicken enchilada in every bite.  I had to find a recipe like this cuz I felt like it was one of the best things I've ever eaten!  This recipe did not disappoint, although I felt like the first bite was heavenly, I soon didn't taste the enchilada-ness after that.  Maybe my taste buds got too used to it.  Served during a party and friends enjoyed it saying you could eat it with a spoon or a fork.  One person used tortilla chips and "ate" it as a dip!  Tons of compliments on it and everyone wanted the recipe.  Hubby's only comment was the cheese making it too fattening.  Maybe I will leave it out next time to serve as a condiment for low cal eaters.  Will keep this in my rotation for cold rainy days!

Enjoyed this. I didn't have masa harina, so I substituted some corn starch mixed in a cup of water. Next time I will get the real thing or use corn tortillas as others have suggested. I also cooked the chicken in the broth directly to save a step.

Good flavors. I wish I could have found spicy enchilada sauce, but we added red pepper flakes and hot sauce to it to spice it up a bit.

One of the best soups I’ve had in a long time.  After trying Chili’s version I had to make this at home.  I did make some changes to help with the blandness many reviews complained about. I increased the cumin to a teaspoon and added a cup of salsa.  Great topped with cheese , jalapeños, and tortilla chips.

Loved it!  Added rotel and black beans while cooking (crock pot on low - 6.5 hrs). Topped with cheese (did not add during cooking), avocado and a dollop of sour cream. Also substituted 6 corn tortillas for the masa. Will make again.

Thank you for such a delicious recipe! I have made this a few times now and am making it again for a "Soup and Chili Pot Luck" for work tomorrow.  My changes were: instead of the masa, I tear up a few corn tortillas, add a can of black beans and a dollop of sour cream in each bowl. Super yummy :)

This soup was delicious! I know that reviewers get all kinds of upset when someone rates a recipe after they’ve changed it, but you have to use recipes as a “base” to build on. With that said here is what I changed... First off, I’m a vegetarian so use “faux” chicken broth/base. I also don’t agree with recipes that call of a “cup” of onion. I use a WHOLE onion, sometimes 2 whole onions, which is what I used for this recipe. The same goes for garlic. I used at least 4-6 cloves of garlic. I did make a triple batch of this soup so that required far more onion & garlic than the recipe stated. Some people like a milder soup and some people like a spicer soup. I’m from Texas so I like things spicier. Using this recipe as a “base suggestion” yielded an amazing tasty soup that everyone I gave some to LOVED. I love masa so using it was fine for me. I don’t find it to be gritty at all, especially if you let it sit for a bit so it can properly dissolve. I followed the recipe, with the exception of a few things, and it turned out awesome. I HIGHLY recommend it. Thank you!

Love this soup. I leave out the cheddar & don’t miss it. The masa harina thickens it plenty.

Yummy!!! I didn't alter as much but did add to...I made the enchilada sauce because that's just better and it was a day off work so I had time. Simmered a couple of hours...didn't use water...just broth....and as usual doubled the spices  because we love them! I did add a sm can of green chilies and half a can chipotle seasoned diced tomato for a little kick.  And trying to multi purpose ingredients, I chopped corn tortillas for the thickener....prob another reason I simmered so long but that was me...  I topped with cilantro, avo, and queso fresco! I was able to keep some veg and add chicken for others with positive results!  Will deff do again!! Thank you!

I just made this soup.  Everything was excellent except for the masa texture. It was gritty. Problem solved!  I used my emulsion blender and it is now smooth and creamy!  Just make sure you add the chicken after you use the blender.  I also added some black beans.  Delicious!!!!

Loved this.  Followed a suggestion in the comments and used 6 corn tortillas chopped instead of masa harina.  Amazing.  I also used slow cooked pulled chicken that I had made for another recipe (chicken breast, corn, black beans and rotel) instead of plain chicken.  My non-soup eaters even ate this and asked for seconds!!

This was not what I expected. I thought to eat a soup similar to that of Chili's chicken enchilada and this was not it. I followed instructions and ingredient list.
No one in my family liked it and asked me not to make it again.

Loved it! Been sick for a week, so I just chopped a store-bought rotisserie chicken instead of cooking it myself and added at the end. My SO has digestive issues with fresh garlic so I subbed a few generous dashes of garlic powder. Ultimate comfort food. This will be appearing on our menu regularly.

Very good soup. Tastes very close to Chiles recipe. The only change that I made was adding the whole 20 oz can of enchilada sauce. I was tasting while it was cooking and it needed the sauce.  I thought the masa was too much. My soup was very thick. Next time will try half. Very good flavor. Served with shredded cheese and crumbled tortilla chips.

Family just loved this!!!  Big Hit!!!  I added a couple dollups of sour cream. (This need to be whisked in) I used corn tortillas instead of masa (as suggested by other reviewers) and they added the perfect flavor of the enchilada. Just tore into pieces and it breaks apart as the soup heats.  I also used all chicken stock instead of water.  In order to add the cheddar cheese without clumping you need to sprinkle a little at a time, stir, add a little more.  This allows  the cheese to melt before adding more so it does not clump.  I added the chicken last once all the ingredients were blended.  For garnish, I added green onions, black olives, sour cream and cheese.   All in the family loved this soup and it was perfect for a cold winter dinner!

Loved it. I cooked in my slow cooker with frozen chicken breast. Also instead of masa harina, I use crumbled up corn tortillas. (As suggested by Others).  And added a can of Rotel tomatoes.

Absolutely delicious - and perfect for a cold winter night.  
I already had  home made chicken stock and shredded chicken (from a rotisserie chicken) which made this almost an instant dinner.  Thank you for this recipe which gives you endless flexibility to use whats on hand.  I'll definitley make this again.

My family and friends love this easy to make and delicious soup. We have it for potlucks during the holidays and in the colder months.  Double the batch, cook in a large stock pot then transfer to a 6 qt crock pot on warm to serve a crowd of 20+.

This was very good! I added a smidge more cumin. When I mixed the harina, i used warm water and an immersion blender. It was very smooth, not gritty at all. However, the amount of harina plus all the cheese made the consistency similar to my grandmother's turkey gravy (very thick lol). Next time, I will probably half the harina or the cheese, and go from there. Otherwise, it tasted just like eating a yummy enchilada! My family went for seconds on this one!

I was worried the soup was going to be too plain and bland from my taste tests while cooking. But once I added sour cream, cheese, avocado and crunchy tortillas pieces it was really good. I felt like the sour cream made it so much better. Next time I make this I will be adding more to it as others have suggested. I did substitute broth for water.

My wife and daughter love the soup from Chili's, so I wanted to give this one a shot.  I added a little more chili powder and cumin that it called for, and it probably could have taken a little more.  Topped with cilantro, avocado slices, and sour cream it made for a great meal that we'll make again.

Ii used masa instantanea; it is like flour masa so it isn't gritty.  Also, instead of using canned enchilada sauce cooked  4 dried New Mexico chilis  (Removing the seeds) with garlic in 1 cup of water and puréed them with a hand mixer.  Made a a difference giving it a homemade flavor.  This recipe is so easy and a definite keeper.

This is a fantastic recipe. I didn't have any masa harina so upon reading the reviews and finding I could sub in ground stale corn tortilla chips, I used my blender to grind them up, added the water, whisked well, and whisked it into the chicken stock. I also puréed three chipotle peppers in adobo sauce with the one cup of enchilada sauce. I used leftover shredded chicken breast I had already cooked in the crockpot for another dinner. (The chicken was seasoned with taco seasoning, salsa, a little cayenne, salt, and pepper for the chicken soft tacos we had a few days prior). So really the only differences in my recipe were I used seasoned chicken and added chipotle in adobo sauce for a smokier spicier flavor. Super recipe. Thank you!!

I literally made an account to review this. So yummy! I followed the tips to rapidly whisk the masa into the water about a tablespoon at a time and it wasn't gritty at all. We used pork instead because that's what we had on hand and it was AMAZING! My husband ate 3 bowls and even our toddler ate a big bowl of it

I wasn't impressed with this soup.  I agree with previous posters about it being too thick/gelatinous and bland.  I was able to spice it up a bit to make it edible but it was best eaten as a dip with tortilla chips, it's that thick.

Gotta knock this down a peg for suggesting pre-shredded cheese.  (Ever notice the white powdery stuff on the individual pieces of pre-shredded cheese? Uh huh, well read on...) Pre-shredded cheese is coated with a product that prevents it from drying out and spoiling too quickly, but it also stops it from melting properly. When this soup is made with block cheese that you shred yourself, it is very delicious and worthy of five stars!

Amazing! I absolutely loved it. It does kind of taste like Chili's but some how better. The only difference I made was baked my chicken in the oven. And of course you can adjust seasoning to your taste. You won't be disappointed. Yummy! ;)

This soup was easy to make and I love that the recipe uses real cheese instead of velveeta. I found the velveeta recipe to be kind of gross. This one gets 5 stars! Even the kids gobbled it up. *add a can of corn or black beans for variety.

I made it pretty close to the instructions except adding 1.5 cups cooked black beans, seasoning the chicken before searing then making my own broth, added more cumin and chili powder, and added crumbled tortilla chips.  When I served it, i served it with sweet corn bread and I garnished it with freshly made pico de gallo, Monterey Jack cheese and more crumbled tortilla chips.It was a HUGE HIT and everyone was begging for the recipe!  when I seared the chicken, I first put my favorite chicken seasonings of kicken' chicken.  After searing, I added 2 cups water and one chicken bouillon cube for the broth but used the Swanson broth for additional broth because I didn't want it to be too chunky.  After boiling chicken in the broth, I removed it from the pot, cut into cubes and put it in a sealed container to stay moist. Then I picked back up with how the instructions stated.  But, I waited to add the chicken back in 30 minutes before serving so the chicken didn't fall apart and would stay in chunk form. That is also when I added beans and chips.  You can't really tell how thick it's going to be till just before serving so keep broth ready.  In my opinion, the garnish is just as important as the soup. It really makes it zing!

I made this one and followed the recipe exactly.  it was good and tasted a lot like enchiladas.  I'm sure I'll make this again.
my whole family enjoyed it except for our one who is lactose intolerant.  next time I'll leave the cheese as the last minute add in.

Less time consuming if you use a food processor to chop and shred, and use a hand blender to mix the flour and water.

Made this last night & it went over really well. Resisted the urge to spice it up hot (I like things spicy but not all the family agrees) & even the hard to satisfy Mother in Law said it was good. Added sour cream, cheese, green onions & cilantro before serving & there was very little left over. I also used a small rotisserie chicken instead of cooking my own, & it made this even quicker & delicious. A "keeper" recipe!

Followed recipe exact. Does not taste anything like Chili's chicken enchilada soup!  The dominate flavor is the masa harina. I added more enchilada sauce hoping to wake the flavor up to no avail. You can't even tell there's chicken in it until you get a piece. No chicken flavor or enchilada sauce flavor. The soup is completely overwhelmed by corn. Not sure how to fix it. Love the color but the flavor is very bland.

This was so easy and flavorful! My picky daughter even ate two bowls! That's a huge compliment. Perfect for a weeknight meal/one pot dinner. I will definitely be making this again. I did change one thing: I substituted 10 corn tortillas-cut into small pieces for a thicker soup and omitted the masa. I also topped it off like I do all of my enchiladas: lettuce, corn, avocado, and sour cream. Delicious!

I added some process cheese because the cheddar cheese gave it a sour bitter taste.  It was okay after adding it. Next time I will substitute process cheese instead of cheddar.

this was soooo delicious.  I made several adjustments though. I sautéed more diced onion and garlic than called for, added 6 cups water and 7 chicken bouillon cubes instead of chicken broth. I placed my chicken breasts in the pot to cook. while this was cooking, I mixed the masa, placed my seasonings and spices in  green enchilada sauce. once chicken was cooked I removed it and set it aside.  I added the masa mixture into the broth, added the enchilada sauce with seasonings,  for an extra kick. I diced up 1 Jalapeño pepper and then  shredded white cheddar cheese stirred. after shredding/dicing chicken added it to the pot. let simmer then served with tricolored tortilla strips on top. I know I'll be making this again. Maybe trying colby jack instead of cheddar next time.

This is the best soup ever!  So easy to make (I followed the recipe exactly) and it is a crowd favorite!  It tastes EXACTLY like Chili's chicken enchilada soup. This is really a 10 our of 5 stars!  We love it soooo much!

Loved this. Quick and easy to make. I took it over to my parents for lunch. I ended up showing my Mom Allrecipes and printing this recipe out for her. everyone loved it. I used corn tortillas 6 small ones sliced into strips. I made my own enchilada sauce. Sorry All Recipes, I used Emeril's red sauce recipe. adding Cilantro, one jalapeno pepper and green onion. Note: make extra, freezes well.

This is a delicious recipe.  I don't think the soup needs to have the cheese incorporated.  It would taste as good adding a little cheese on top when serving.  I didn't have masa harina, but used corn meal instead and it was fine.  I will definitely make this again. Quick and easy.

Fantastic.  I didn't brown my chicken (used thighs)  just boiled it and then used the broth for the soup.  Added onions and garlic to the broth.  While simmering, I added 2 cans of drained black beans and one can of fiest corn.  It was fantastic and will make again!

I made this and added corn, diced tomatoes, and a can of Rotel.  I made some cornbread to go with it.  It is really good!

I didn't have any corn flour, so I used corn meal and my immersion blender in the soup before adding the extra veggies.  It doesn't seem gritty to me though I don't mind the crunch of corn meal either.

I made this tonight. Did the corn tortillas as suggested by another reviewer and added a few vegetables (black beans, tomatoes and fiesta corn) to make it heartier for my kids. MAN this was good!! Scaled back the cheese a bit but it was still phenomenal. I think it was better than chilis!

BEST SOUP EVER !!! I JUST ate Chili's Enchilada soup yesterday and then came home to make this today. EXACT REPLICA !!! yahoo!!!! But - I did use corn tortillas instead of the Masa Harina. The corn tortillas melt right down to nothing and thicken up the pot while adding their taste to the soup. I'm addicted ! Added some sour cream and shredded cheese and a little tortilla chips and I'm hooked ! Thank you !

Loved it! I substituted the masa with maseca (it's used to make corn tortillas and can be found in the ethnic foods section) and the water for Mexican beer. I added jalapeños, black beans and corn. Yummy!

I was looking for an alternative to taco soup when I came accross this one. I was worried about finding Masa Harina at our market as I live in a small town but was able to find it on the baking aisle near the flour. The soup turned out GREAT. My family of 8 did not have a single complaint. I garnished it with cilantro, chopped tomate, an avacado, sour cream and crushed tortilla chips. Added this one to "my recipe box."

I absolutely LOVE Chilis' Chicken Enchilada Soup and I was looking for a replica recipe. This one came close, but not quite. Don't get me wrong, it was still great, but it was missing that bold kick Chilis' soup has. I followed this recipe, but substituted the 1 cup water with more chicken broth, used Kraft Three Cheese Blend, and I used Maseca, because my grocer didn't carry masa harina (but I think Maseca is the same thing?). The Maseca added a great corn flavor to the soup. However, I think the three cheese blend is what threw it off. I tried to get the secret from an insider at Chilis, but of course, it turns out it's packaged and they just reheat it for you. I'm also looking for that deep orange color, which according to other recipes I've looked at, just might come from the cheese you're using. Next time I'll be trying it with Velveeta instead of the cheese to see if that gives me what I'm looking for. Definitely look forward to making this again and tweaking it until it comes out just right =)

This basic recipe is good but bland. I increased all the seasonings and onion and garlic and added chicken bouillon (Better Than Bouilion). Also seasoned the chicken with garlic salt and chili powder prior to browning. Served with chopped tomatoes, avocado and tortilla strips. Very good after adjustments.

We just made this tonight, and it was lovely. I think this is one of those soups that is easy to toss together, but gets most of it's flavor from the garnishes you choose. I did substitute about 1.25 lbs of frozen pork for the chicken (I was looking for a recipe to help use up some of the boneless pork I snagged for 60 cents a lb!), and tossed everything into my crock pot instead. After about 6 hours I shredded the pork and put it back in for another 20 minutes on high, the same time I added the masa. I only used half a cup of masa, but I mixed it into my cup of water very slowly- no grittiness. We used the cheese as a garnish instead of adding it to the pot. We topped with cheese, crema mexicana, and crushed tortilla chips. When the crema got stirred into the soup it came out very velvety. I added corn, black beans and some green chilies to my bowl because I am the only one who likes them in my family. All together, it's any easy base soup that you can change the flavor of by changing your toppings. Definitely worth a try.

This is even better than Chili's.  It has become my Christmas day soup.  I replace the water with more broth, and heat the cups of broth before adding it slowly to the masa, stirring continually to avoid clumping.  I use one can of the 15 oz. red sauce.  Otherwise I follow as is.  So delicious!!!

love this recipe! We are vegetarians for medical reasons, im always looking for a hearty feeling substitute. Due to allergies, I made some adjustments. Instead of chicken broth I used water mixed with Streits soup base. I added green chiles, 1/2 cup extra enchilada sauce (las palmas), 1 cup cheddar cheese, 1 cup fiesta blend cheese. White corn and black beans helped with omitting the shredded chicken. Instead of water, I used veggie stock.

I've made this several times...sometimes with homemade enchilada sauce, sometimes with jarred. Both are good. It's a simple, basic soup that's really good with a quesadilla or as a lunch at work.

This was fairly easy to make. I used frozen chicken and boiled it instead of thawing, then browning. I followed others' advice to slowly add the masa harina. I used a ten ounce can of enchilada sauce, which perhaps made it a bit too spicy for the kids, but those of us who like spicy thought it was great. We put a dollop of sour cream and some tortilla strips on top.

Made for dinner. Enjoyed by all! Very easy - all ingredients bought at Wal-mart, wahoo. Very hearty - perfect fall/winter soup. I served with taco salad.

This was so easy and so delicious. It was a warm bowl of comfort. I will definitely make it again, though I may make an addition or two just for fun (totally not necessary). We thought green chilies and maybe corn could be good as well. Perfect as is. Thank you! This will be a new staple in our home. p.s. I'm not sure what the fuss was in some reviews with the masa harina. It's almost as easy as adding water to a recipe.

I made the soup for dinner with homemade southern cornbread.  It was delicious and definitely a keeper. I did, however change a few things.  I used light Mexican blend cheese, added some green chilies, put diced tomatoes in the soup and used shredded rotisserie chicken.  I also used the homemade enchilada sauce I keep in my freezer, so much better than the canned stuff and it is so easy to make!

Made it using all ingredients listed.  Added 16 oz of velveeta, can of corn, can of green chiles, a sprinkling of red pepper flakes, a dash of frank's red hot.  I used the masa but I don't think it was really necessary.  Not exactly low on the calories, but one bowl really filling and it makes A LOT!

Yummo...This was excellent. Everyone loved it. I did substitute extra sauce for 1 cup of the water and did add some frozen corn, a can of diced green chilis, and a dash of cayenne but it would have been good without the additions. We will be making this often.

Good. Definitely add goodies on top. Cilantro, jalepenos, sour cream, pico, etc. I think I might add a can of green chilies next time. Easy and comforting.

Don't be afraid to tweak the soup.  It needed a little extra flavor/spice for our liking so I used 1 cup Cheddar, 1 cup Cheddar-Pepper Jack for a little extra kick.  I also added a bit of cayenne pepper, an extra 1 1/2 t. chili power, an entire 10 oz can of enchilada sauce rather than only the 1 cup called for in the recipe, an extra 1/2 t. of ground cumin, 1/2 t. of garlic powder.  And because I used low sodium chicken broth, I needed to add a little salt to our personal taste.    The finished product was fantastic!

I was at Chilis yesterday and tried this soup based on the the servers recommendation. I had not left the restauart and I had already brought A.R up on my phone seeing if I could find a dup. recipe! I stopped at store on way home and thought I had everything but I didnt notice the Masa harina until i got home and looked the recipe up on the laptop. Fortunetly I did get the corn torts. so I followed lots of other reviews and ground about a cup full in my blender, it seemed to work well but mine was not the same consist. as Chilis (tab more runny and not quite as smooth but close) I also followed others suggestions and doubled the seasoning. I wish I had only uped the seasoning by 1/2 but live and learn. I did use half velvetta and half sharp cheddar. It was late when I was done making so I did not try until this am...added extra cheddar on top along with a spot of s.c. I also bought an avacado to chunk up and put a piece on top. This was really good and I will totally make again (using masa H.) and I will probably tweek a tad more. Corn may be a nice thing to add as well. The cup i had at chilis was the best soup I have ever had (and I adore soups) my was not as good but I will work it out! give it a try...it is very good!!!!!

This recipe isn't bad, but it isn't fantastic either. To be honest, it is like a less exciting version of tortilla soup. Although this soup has an interesting creative flavor, it is sort of a one-note taste and doesn't have much texture. I would like to try this again with some tweaks. For example, adding green chiles and topping it with some sour cream. I believe that with some changes, this could be a better recipe. But as it is, there isn't a whole lot going on with the flavor.

This recipe was really good after I tweaked it a bit. I didn't have the masa harina, so I used corn muffin mix and flour like another reviewer suggested, and I didn't have enchilada sauce so I used salsa instead. It was pretty bland so I added another 1/2 t cumin, 1/2 t red cayenne pepper, and 1/2 t chili pepper. After that it was really spicy but soo good! I also added 3-4 jalapeño slices from a jar, diced.  I'll definitely make it again, and try to find the masa harina and enchiada sauce next time. Maybe that's what the problem was this time...either way it was still good!

As a very green novice, I made some errors, and consequently, changes to the basic format of this recipe, but it turned out great by all accounts.  Like some folks had previously suggested, I shredded corn tortillas (about 8-9 small ones) in replace of the masa harina.  I'll definitely be making this in the future, though hopefully without as many rookie mistakes!

THIS IS A MUST SAVE, MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH RAVED OVER IT.  I USED ONLY 3/4 CUP OF MASA, SINCE WE DON'T LIKE A REAL THICK SOUP.  I ALSO USED CHICKEN TENDERS, WHICH I COOKED IN OIL TILL DONE.  I USED A SERRATED STEAK KNIFE TO SHRED THE MEAT, THUS REDUCING THE COOKING TIME BY 15 TO 20 MINUTES.  ALSO IF YOU ADD THE MASA AT THE END IT KEEPS EVERYTHING FROM STICKING; IT ONLY NEEDS TO COOK A FEW MINUTES.  I'M ON  THE "I LOVE MY DIXON DIET" AND THIS COMPLIMENTS THAT.

The Masa Harina is a flour found  in the Mexican food section of any grocery store.  It's used to make tortillas.  This soup is amazing!

I live in Alaska so having a variety of soups for the winter is a must!  My family really enjoys this soup and I always make a little extra for left overs.  I added a can of black beans and a can of cream corn to give it a little more substance.

This is outstanding!!  It really is just like Chili's.  I took some advice from some of the other reviews and I doubled up on the seasonings and only used about 3/4 c. of the masa harina.  I slowly added it to the hot water and had no problems.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This soup was really good & my husband said it was a keeper.  I added a 14 ounce package of frozen Southwest style vegis (corn, black beans, red peppers, poblano chilis & onions) for the last 15 minutes of cooking.  Added some color, nutrition & flavor.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  Even my 1 year old daughter loved it!

I also made this recipe and tweeked it to my liking.I didn't use as much masa as the recipe called for, added more broth and also added a small jar of salsa.And after cooking it on the stove I put it in the crockpot. It came out wonderful! Now when I make this I have to bring some to my dad, my in-laws,and to my friend! But the best part is that my husband loves it!!

I received this recipe from a co-worker, though hers suggested green enchilada sauce and a can (or two) of diced green chilis. I also omit the chicken and the salt (we don't eat meat and the stock is salty enough) and use "vegetarian chicken flavored" broth. I've never used masa harina; I always just add 4-8 corn tortillas, cut up. This recipe is so versitile, though. I've added a can of black beans, diced green/yellow/red bell peppers, ground beef (for meat-eating family), and olives all with great results!

My whole family loved it!!  I did use salsa in place of the enchilada sauce & corn tortillas instead of the masa, though. Great way to use up leftover chicken or a store bought rotisserie chicken.  Very easy & relatively quick, if you use pre-cooked chicken.  Thanks!

My family loved this recipe.  I added 1/3 pound of extra chicken to give it more substance and it worked out great.  Next time I would half the chili powder for my husband's sensitive stomach (although I loved the amount of spice).

I made the recipe "as is" - And thought it was pretty bland.  But then, I do like a fair amount of zest or spice to my food. I gave it a 4 based on the original recipe. With my changes, I would give a 5 and would make again. I used double the garlic, medium heat enchilida sauce, extra salt and added pepper, probably doubled my chili powder, added a few good shakes of Cayenne pepper, added some frozen corn and about 1/4 cup (maybe little more) of homemade salsa into it. Served with extra cheese on top, tortilla chips and sour cream. Very tasty and nice and thick!

Use the prev review'rs tip about whisking the masa in just a bit at a time (thank you!)...then add rotel (it needs it) plus a little salsa (a fresh cut salsa w/cilantro worked great); add xtra on the spices and voila!  I'm at Chili's!! ( :  Thank you!!

I thought this recipe was fantastic!  I already had a roasted whole chicken on hand that I had purchased at the store so I just shredded the chicken and used that (such a time saver!).. other than that I followed the recipe.  I did follow other people's suggestions and mixed the masa harina with warm water to help disolve it, it still seemed a little gritty when first incorporated into the soup but after simmering the soup for the recommended time had diluted completely and thickened the soup.  To my delight this tasted just like Chicken Enchiladas.  The chicken stayed moist and yummy.  My husband and I both like a little spice so we topped our servings with mexican hot sauce, extra shredded cheddar and a little sour cream.  I shared the leftovers with family members who loved this recipe just as much as we did!  I will definitely make this recipe time and time again!

I found this recipe to be very bland and was really disappointed.  My two toddlers liked it, so that made it worth the time and effort.  I ended up adding some roasted corn and taco seasoning to add more flavoring but the Mesa Harina is very over powering and made the soup really thick. I love Chili's Enchilada soup so based on other reviews thought this would be a good one.  I think I'll have to keep searching.

After cooking onion and garlic, I added the quart of broth then just boiled the chicken in the broth. Much easier than cooking the chicken seperate. 
I stirred the masa (only 1/2 cup) into additional 2 cups of broth. 
I bought a 10 ounce can of enchilada sauce and couldn't really see leaving out the extra 2 ounces so I added the whole thing. 
The spices need to be increased or it is pretty bland.
And like the other post, I added corn and black beans. Helps give it a little more substance and looks good too. 
I don't recommend adding the cheese until it is in individual serving bowls. It will just kind of all clump together if you add it to the whole batch and then cook it for 1/2 hour. The Enchilada Soup II is the same except for the addition of processed cheese instead of grated cheddar. It incorporates much better, but I only added 8 ounces instead of a whole pound. Yikes! That's alot.

This is a regular in our house, its super easy and tasty. I always add a can of rotele, corn and fresh cilantro.  I also like to serve with a little buffet of toppings, scallions, tortilla strips, cheese, sour cream etc.

This soup was excellent.  My masa didn't lump up on me.  I had to make my own enchilada sauce using a recipe from this sight. I think that was one of the reasons it turned out so good.  I added diced green chilies, rotel tomatoes with chilies and black beans.  The heat of the spices was just right.  I will be making this again and again.

I liked the flavor really well but didn't care at all for the Masa Harina texture.  I would probably make a cheese soup base next time and add my spices and chicken to that instead.  Overall it was very much like a favorite restaurant of mine and I really enjoyed it, I just didn't like the texture.

The soup was so good!  Our only complaint was that the masa harina didnt dissolve very much so it was a little gritty....but I shouldve looked at the reviews bc another reviewer explained how to fix that.  But it was very flavorful and tasted like the Chili's soup, which I LOVE!  Thanks for the recipe!

This may be my new favorite soup!  My husband and kids all made faces when I said we were having enchilada soup for dinner.  However, there were smiles all around when this flavorful and filling soup was served.  It couldn't be easier to make.  I used the cheese that I had on hand (1 cup of fat free cheddar and a cup of 2% Velveeta).  I didn't have quite enough chicken stock, so I added a cup of chicken bouillon to make up the difference.  I served the hearty soup with baked corn tortillas.  The leftover soup was even better the following day.  I can't wait to make this one again!

Thank you! This is a great recipe. However we did make a few changes. We used a whole rotisserie chicken, used 12 oz. Velveeta instead of shredded cheese, 1/2 C. taco sauce instead of 1 C. enchilada sauce, added 1- 11 oz. can of corn and 1- 10 oz. can Ro-Tel diced tomatoes with green chilies. We increased the chili powder, using 1 tbsp., and increased the cumin using 1 tsp., and also added a little pepper to taste (1 tsp). It was wonderful!

Very delicious! I also had some fresh corn which I cut off the cob and added around the same time as the chicken. (about 1 ear). Next time I may add more spice, as I like spicier flavors, but this was very good! As a garnish I made tortilla strips in the oven which I seasoned with cumin, salt, pepper, chili powder, and garlic powder, and added those to individual bowls of the soup. Yum!

This soup is amazing!  I prefer beef to chicken with my Mexican food so I replaced the chicken with taco meat (beef).  I was very careful about whisking the Masa and had no problems with the soup being gritty.  I brought it to school a couple of times for lunch and it was even better than the first day.

Very good recipe.  My husband tried Enchilada Soup at Chili's and wanted me to make some.  This recipe was really great.  I added some diced tomatoes and green onions for a little extra texture, flavor, and color.  Also, I put a little extra enchilada sauce.  Overall it was great.

Made this recipe with my Mom yesterday and it was GREAT!! We love Chili's Enchilada Soup and this is just like it! We did use all chicken broth though, no water. Served with baked tortilla strips, shredded cheddar, and a dollop of pico de gallo on top. Will make this again and again!! Thanks!!

This recipe is a great one, and pretty easy to put together.  I like the flavor, but agree that it needs more enchilada sauce to boost the flavor, so next time I'll use the large can.  I also used 2 cups of leftover rotisserie chicken to make it easier and loved the result.  I served it with a few Fritos and chopped tomatoes on top.  Will definitely make again.

This is fantastic!   A friend made this soup and entered it into our annual "Soup Cook-off".   This was the winning recipe!   Can't wait to try it myself.  I'll be following the tips of other reviewers to avoid the "grittiness" that some reviews have complained about.  There was NO sign of grittiness in the batch my friend won with!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but it tasted like drinking a soggy tamale.

This soup was SO good!  I subbed corn meal for the other flour and I do not recommend that! Corn meal was a little too heavy and made the soup too thick.  I added more water and it was doable although a little mealy.  But the flavor of this soup was amazing! I added a bunch of fresh cilantro to the soup as well and I HIGHLY recommend you do the same.  It was the perfect compliment to the soup and gave it such a great added flavor.  This just went in the list of my favorites!!

This recipe was great my husband enjoyed it very much. I saw another recipe that had chicken broth so i added some. I also saw that i could use salsa instead of enchilada sauce from another reviewer. I use Pace Hot  salsa which made it spicy. Before that it wasn't that spicy.

Yum!  This was easy and tasted great.  You could modify it in many ways and it would still be great.  I added a can of green chili's and baked some corn tortilla strips and they were a great addition.  Next time I think I will add some black beans.

Very good, easy to make with readily available ingredients.  Almost like Chili's restaurant. Next time, I might add a can of green chilis.

I made this and it turned out terrible. It was gritty and too thick and very bland.  I thought I did something wrong and did it again and got the same results.  Dont waste your money getting the ingrediments and making this.  It was terrible.  I'll try another one.

This recipe was really good, but was a little bland as written.  I added an extra cup of enchilada sauce and a touch more chili powder and cumin as well as some sharp cheddar.  With those changes, it was great and filling enough to eat as a meal.  My picky husband loved it.

Very good recipe.  Used 10-minute Enchilada Sauce instead of canned.  The masa was smooth and creamy and made a very rich soup.

Very good and easy. I added black beans and corn. If you add the corn flour as directed with the water first and then add to the soup it is not grainy at all. Made my own corn tortillas and baked then to use as a side to the soup.

Fantastic! The masa harina gave this soup a nice flavor. We made some homemade corn tortillas & baked them to make tortilla chips to go with the soup. They gave the soup the crunch it needed. My husband says this soup is better than Chili's. Thanks for a keeper!

This was just basically edible - but I wouldn't really call it good either. I left out the masa because I don't like gritty soups and I am pretty sure that if I had added it then the star count would be even lower. Sorry I guess this just isn't what I was expecting - I probably should've known better than to use can enchilda sauce being from Texas. Oh well I am going to try and salvage the chicken out of it tonight and make real enchilada's with real enchilada sauce on top - but I will not be making this recipe again.

This was great!  I fried a few corn tortilla strips to make some crunchy additions for the soup.  I also just diced my chicken into small bite-sized pieces before cooking it, and that eliminated the shredding step.

LOVE THIS!  I am not an enchilada eater by nature, but at the State Fair of Texas this year, a merchant called "House of Gold Gifts" was giving samples of this soup and selling a packaged dry mix.  The chicken, enchilada sauce, broth, and cheese were all that we used when making the packaged mix from the fair.  The recipe here calls for added water and garlic which we did not use with the mix we bought at the fair but I think are excellent additions.  For a tasty touch, we crushed tortilla chips and placed at bottom of bowls before adding the soup.  Highly recommend this recipe and thank GOODNESS I don't have to go online to buy the mix now.  HOORAY!  Thanks for posting this tasty recipe!

I agree this was missing something but I can't put my finger on it either.  It was a little thin for me but that could be because I didn't add the masa harina because I don't like grittiness.

This was good, although not exactly what I was expecting. I thought the soup had a bit of a gritty texture, which was fine once I got used to it - but I was expecting a smoother soup. My biggest complaint was it lacked spice. If I make it again I would double the chili powder and add a few drops of hot sauce. I halved the recipe and added an 8oz can of corn and a 4oz can of green chiles, which I thought gave it a little extra "something". I will make this again but definitely crank up the heat! ** Update ** I tried to freeze this in individual portions and reheat - NOT GOOD. It got really thick and gritty. I don't plan on making this again.

Great, EASY soup to make.  My son (6) and husband both loved it.  Added a little milk to son's bowl to "cool down" and take away a little spiciness.  That said, I personally didn't think it overly spicy.

This was a huge hit! I tried it for the first time and had a house full of guests, I added chopped cilantro with the onions and garlic and served with a palm full of shredded cheese, a dollup of sour cream and i made my own tortilla chips. I went to 3 stores to find masa harina couldn't find it so i bought a 5 lb bag of LaPina harina at Albertson's , it turned out great!

This was super yummy!  The only change I made was that I made a packet of spanish rice and then added it to the soup.  My husband LOVED it and he is very picky.  Thanks!  :o)

I made this again and added a can of black beans and one can of corn.  I really love this dish!

I made it with soy flour to make it lower carb and it was still delicious!

WOW.  Even my 12 year old who likes hardly anything, likes this soup.  Changes I made: I used all chicken broth, I doubled the onion, I accidently added two cups of enchilada sauce, and I didn't have any cumin on hand-so I omitted it.  But tasted great anyways.

This recipe is truly delicious.  My kids all loved it and even had seconds followed by thirds which is rare at my house.  My husband spice his up quite a bit and loved it.  I thought that maybe adding some mexican rice to the recipe would be good...I may try it tonight!  Thanks for the delicious, authentic, easy recipe.

I have made this several times and everybody loves it. My changes: use all broth, no water. A touch less mesa harina. About half the cheese I used Velveeta. Did add (hint from somebody else) a can of crushed tomateos and a can of black beans.  Once I did try a can of corn, but didn't enjoy the sweet taste with the soup. Also, I make my own enchilada sauce, which is on this site, I think under Crisco Chicken Enchiladas, and is VERY easy and delicious.

Yummy!  I made this last night and my husband and I gobbled it up.  It was even better for lunch today.  It really thickens up in the fridge overnight.  I followed the directions exactly and I would make this again the same way and with some of the varations mentioned here.  Thanks!

This worked out really well.  My wife, who is a huge fan of the Chili's soup, just loved this.  I used 2% reduced fat chedder cheese, which helped trim a few calories, and the taste didn't suffer.

This was excellent!  But I added extra cumin ~ needed it for that Mexican flavor!  Blows Chili's soup away!

Absolutely delicious.  I used mild enchilada sauce and probably will try hot enchilada sauce the next time to give it a bit more kick.  This recipe is great for a cold, blustery day.

This soup recipe is awesome!!!  I couldn't even wait for it to cool before eating.  It tastes just like the enchilada soup at Chili's.  I couldn't believe I made something soooo yummy.  I don't like things too spicy so I just added a pinch of chili powder instead if the recommender amount and mild enchilada sauce.  For those that like it spicy, try spicy enchilada sauce.

wasn't bad at all, definately needs the tomatoe in some form as said earlier, (as in rotel or even fresh on top). And for a side note, the green chili enchilada sauce also goes very well with this recipe, (my husband brought it home by accident, and i used it anyways). Yumdiddlyyum eh?

Fabulous!! I added a can of Rotel and a can of black beans. I also doubled the spices. I used chicken broth instead of water and two cups of enchilada sauce. I topped with fresh cilantro and oven crisped corn tortilla strips. Would be great for a football party!

This was sooooooo good! I only had enough ingredients to make a half a recipe last night but I am going to go buy some more ingredients so I can make a whole batch tonight. I didn't change a thing with the recipe, I think it is perfect the way it is!

This soup is absolutely wonderful!  To save a little time I used a pkg. of pre-shredded Mexican (or Nacho) style cheese and it added a nice little tang.  If you manage to have any leftovers, it is even better the next day.

This tastes just like Chili's!  You do have to use the masa harina, which I found at Dominick's with the ethnic foods.  My husband and my sister loved this and I didn't have much left over the next day!  Thanks for this one!

The soup is awesome!! It makes alot, great for a really cold day. I made a few changes, I baked the chicken and then after it cooled chopped it up and just added it just before it simmered. I like my food extra spicy so I used a little more enchilada sauce and chili powder. My kids are very picky eaters, especially when its a  new" recipe, but they really Loved this!!!
