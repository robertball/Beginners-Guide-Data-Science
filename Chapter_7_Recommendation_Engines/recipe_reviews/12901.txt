This recipe was delicious.  I substituted the ham for some spicy smoked sausage and added some garlic and WOW! I have been looking for a black bean soup recipe like this and lucked out with this one.  I served it with some fresh home made bread.  P.S soaking beans overnight cuts down on cooking time.   Thank you!

I had been looking for a basic recipe for black bean soup.  I first tried this recipe as written and didn't cover the pot.  It took an extra hour to cook the beans.  I loved the soup, as did my family.  I also added tabasco.  This time, I'm making it without the vinegar, to make it a basic black bean soup. It still tastes wonderful.

This was so easy to make.  I soaked the beans for extra tenderness, and ended up using a smoked turkey leg instead of the ham bone.  When it was done, I pulled the meat off the bone and used that instead of the cubed ham.  I also added garlic, black pepper, and a little cayenne, as well as a little extra salt since the turkey was not as salty as a ham bone would have been.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly, and it was really quite good.

Very good soup.  We made it with just the ham hock, and without the ham.  Also, being from New Mexico, we added quite a bit of spice.  We used a can of Rotel instead of the tomato, added some crushed red pepper, red chili powder and habanero powder to give it some kick.  Served it with green chile cornbread.  We will definitely make this again!

Very good!  I did reduce the amount of water and I added about a teaspoon of cocoa.  And DO NOT leave out the vinegar,  it gives the soup the best flavor!

This was very good (will make anything to use up all this ham). I had a strong urge to use my food processor to puree some of the beans but didn't. I didn't think it needed a full TBS of salt. We added some spices. Thank you.

OMG!! This is beyond great, 5 stars is not nearly enough I have eaten "hocks & beans" all my life - but I have never had anything close to this. Absolutely delish! I used pintos & omitted the vinegar, a new all time favorite, thank you for sharing... =p

Very good.  I followed other comments and replaced the vinegar with Tabasco and used Rotel tomatoes in placed of fresh.  I also substituted smoked sausage for the ham bone and ham.  Next time I am adding more smoked sausage and beans (I like a thicker soup) and using a bit less Tabasco if I use Rotel, but the same amount if regular canned tomatoes.

I'd give this 5 stars for taste, but I did make a few changes. I hadn't read the reviews before I made this, but I thought between the ham bones and chicken broth, it probably wouldn't need that much salt, so I didn't put any in at all until after the sauteed veggies and ham were added, then just sprinkled some in to taste. I also shook in some cumin seeds and red pepper flakes. In addition to the chopped tomatoes (I used 4 Roma tomatoes), I added a can (14.5 oz.)of diced tomatoes, with juice. I also didn't bother pureeing some of the beans. The beans were not soft enough after 2 1/2 hours total, so next time I will either cook them for a longer time before I add the other things, or will soak them overnight. Thanks for the great soup idea, I really love this with my modifications.

This is an excellent recipe that is really a no fail one. I like soup to be hearty therefore added a can of diced tomatoes, chopped fresh peppers and chopped celery. I suggest a few dashes of hot sauce to give it a kick or even a bit of cumin for more flavor.

I was looking for a simple black bean soup recipe to use up some leftover ham that didn't have a huge ingredients list, as I always add my own touch to recipes and this was perfect. I soaked the beans overnight, cut down the salt as others noted, and added some cumin, a couple of different chili powders, and substituted the tomatoes for sundried tomato powder. it came out awsome. I will never buy another can of premade black bean soup again. Only gave it 4 stars as I feel the salt it suggested was way too much (perhaps the chicken broth you used was low sodium?), I also reduced the water by one cup.

Easy and delicious. Good basic recipe for a hearty, yummy soup. Everyone liked it. Good without the vinegar, but extra yummy with it added; it gives it more depth of flavor. Very versatile recipe that is good by itself or with any of the usual black bean soup add ins (cheese/sour cream, salsa). Also, very easy to add extra veggies for added nutrition (grated carrots, diced spinach, etc.).

To me,it goes w/out saying to soak the beans overnight. I did find the recipe too liquid so, I added 2 cans of black beans and a can of refried beans w/ lime. I also sauteed garlic,onions,carrots,a bell pepper,grape tomatoes and celery in olive oil. I added cumin,red pepper flakes,1.5 tsp.cocoa, to the soup ( after adding the sauteed veggies.) like others suggested,I used no salt. After these additions,it turned out very tasty.

way too much liquid in the recipe - food processed more than half the beans and it still came out way too thin.

This was surprisingly nice and very easy.  I boiled the beans with the ham the night before, and left them in the fridge overnight.  Then I could skim off all the fat and the beans had a terrific flavor.

Good flavor, but I think the beans should soak....I simmered for well over 2 hours and they were still a little crunchy, and by then it was very very thick.  I also didn't have a ham bone, so I threw in some of the ham, and 2 splashes of liquid smoke.  I'll definitely try it again....but soak the beans. :)

I loved it.  And my family liked it.  My 5 year old, 7 year old and husband ate it with corn muffins.  I substituted sausage for the ham and used a can of diced tomatoes instead of a fresh tomato.  I only did a teaspoon of salt as I thought the broth was probably already salty.

This was a very flavorful soup.  Everyone who tried it, loved it.  I didn't have fresh tomato, so substituted about a cup of stewed tomatos that I had on hand.  Very yummy!

The broth for this soup was wonderful and so fragrant. I also prefer to eliminate the vinegar and added a clove of minced garlic to the sautee. I also added rice and corn to the mix. It was excellent.

I love this recipe.  It is so easy and the whole family loves it even the family members that don't like soup.  I added jalapeno to mine.  Also I used a meaty ham bone and just pulled the ham off the bone after simmering it the first time.  I also didn't puree half the soup.

Very good and easy to make.  Next time I would leave out the salt and salt to taste at the end.  I didn't think my ham was that salty but combined with the canned chicken broth and 2 hour cooking time, the end result was salty soup.

Next time I think I'll try it with vegetable broth instead.

I followed the recipe exactly as it states and the soup ended up WAY TOO salty. I actually ended up throwing out the batch it was that bad.  This is a great base recipe, just omit the tablespoon of salt. If you're wanting to add an extra veggie boost to this recipe, you might want to try adding corn and small chopped carrots to your saute pan. Without the salt this recipe is easily 5 stars!

This recipe looked quick and easy, but it took almost 3 hours to cook the beans soft enough to wear my husband would eat it.  I'll definitely soak the dry beans the night before or use can beans (rinsed). I added chopped green peppers, garlic, oregano, and cumin for some extra flavor. Turned out tasty with some white rice and a dollup of sour cream!

This is a really good soup!  I cooked the beans in chicken broth, and I sauteed chicken with the onions and tomatoes instead of ham.  I also added a some minced garlic and some red pepper.  Very good!  I'm keeping this recipe!

I followed the directions and the soup came out great.  Next time I will probably add a little less salt.  This is by far the best recipe I've tried.

Excellent recipe! Very easy to make, though the I had to simmer the beans a little longer than directed.  I'll definitely make this again, but next time I would use a tad less salt.

I used a smoked ham bone and a little less water (too soupy). It is a very good base soup. I'll make it again. I soaked the beans for 8 hours and they were super soft after 1 hour of cooking.

Everyone loved this soup.  I did soak the beans prior to preparing the recipe.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  A delicious soup.  At the table we added tabasco.  My husband thought the soup was too salty so I might omit the salt next time.

This Black Bean Soup tasted great!  I had been looking for a good recipe for weeks, and the vinegar intrigued me.  I also added about 1 teaspoon Tabasco, but not everyone will want to do this.

Exceptional the way it is written.  However, I used homemade ham stock instead of the chicken stock for an even more richer flavor!  There were no left overs as my friends that came to dinner finished the entire pot!

This is a simple, tasty recipe. I only give it four stars because I like to add a bit more spice, specifically cumin, cilantro, and pepper.

I truly do not like to leave bad reviews, and usually do not; however, this soup is really bad. Very bland which was a surprise due to all the spices that were used.  I even put a ham hock in the soup and still very blaaa. Sorry

I'd love to give this soup a better rating, since it is by far the "thickest" black bean soup I've made, so I'm thrilled with that aspect. However, it is VERY bland; of course you can spice it up (red pepper flakes, more cumin, etc) but the recipe as-is just doesn't get my highest rating.

Way too much salt. That can be eliminated altogether because of the broth and the ham. Also, too thin for our tastes. Been making beans like this all my cooking life, but never with that much salt. Salt, if used, must be used sparingly, and added just before beans are done, otherwise they toughen up.

Recipe is great, I tried a few things a little different. I waited until almost the very end to puree. Wait until you have added the onions and ham ( I doubled ham as well) and added tomatoes then you puree it. It turned out great, wife loved it!

I used this as a guide and it was great.  I pureed all the beans and used two ham hocks, and all chicken stock.  Added garlic  garlic from Tastefully Simple, some Bacon Bacon as well.  Cooked another cup of beans and transferred all to crock pot and let cook all day.  No tomatoes, did three caps of white vinegar.  Oh, I added a little Port..(splash)..Served all over a bed of leftover Spanish Rice and drizzled sour cream over the top.  Great basic recipe!  Will use this again!

I used smoked pork shanks and only used 1-1/2 tsp salt.  Still very salty.  Will not add any salt next time.  Forgot all about adding vinegar.  oops.  Recipe overall was not what I was looking for, but ok.  Will try to tweak it some more.

First of all my family loved this recipe.I did not use any salt,I used a pork hock instead of a ham bone and used 1 tsp of red wine vinegar instead of 1 Tbsp of distilled white vinegar. My mom has this account on allrecipes.com. I made this soup for a class project!

This recipe is delicious! I used two ham hocks instead of the ham bone. I also added two cans of black beans and 1 Tbs. of liquid hickory smoke. Do not omit the vinegar! I prepared yellow rice to compliment the meal. This soup is just so yummy!!!Next time I will try adding two cloves of garlic and some hot sauce.

We're vegetarian and made this soup vegetarian by leaving out the ham and using vegetable broth.  My husband tasted and asked, "Where'd you get the "hambone"?!"  I used about 2 teaspoons of barbeque sauce and it was great!  Quicker if you use a pressure cooker.

Added 2 bay leaves during the bean cooking.  1lb of beans is a little more than 2 cups so I upped the water and I shouldn’t have; it’s too thin.  Apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar.  DELICIOUS.  4 out of 5 stars because it’s too thin; I’ll use less water next time.

I tweeked the recipe to my taste and used cumin and 4 cloves of garlic and some celery to mimic Cuban “peas and rice”. Your recipe was the only one I found that used dry beans, soaked and a ham bone and chicken stock.

I've been making this for a while and it has changed some in the process. I make it  a lot spicier, sometimes using hot Italian sausage instead of ham,  often ham but I always put a lot of garlic in it. We like it that way at my house.

Definitely omit the 1 tblspn salt. The amount of sodium in this recipe was unfortunately overpowering. I would also recommend using a full 16 oz. bag of black beans, if using 2 cups measured you will get a thinner soup.

I used what I had on hand - meaning, no ham - I used pork sausage.  I also should have read the recipe all the through, instead I sauted the onions and tomatos first and added them all together with a clove of garlic in the slow cooker and cooked it all day.  Very good.

Great recipe.  I doubled the onion and tomato, and also added chorizo instead of ham.  It was delicious!

I loved this recipe.  We omitted the  salt (high blood pressure) and tomato (allergy), used water instead of chicken broth (didn't have on hand), but the finished product was super with those small changes.  Have made twice and served to company along with my standard turkey noodle - this one was preferred by the adults in the party, nothing was leftover.

I simmered the beans for a really long time and they were still kind of hard...  There is really no need to add any salt to this recipe, as it is salty enough.  It was pretty good.  But I probably won't make it again.  I will stick with navy or pinto beans... They are much softer.
