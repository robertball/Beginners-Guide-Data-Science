I used rabbit and this was a sensational dish. The savoury flavour was enhanced by the sweetness of the raisins. I think it would also be excellent with chicken.  Try this recipe you won't be disappointed.

Great recipe.  I seared the rabbit meat with the spices before adding the water to boil.  It makes the meat hold up better.  Delicious!  Workes great with any white meat poultry, too.  Gracias!

Very comforting and tasty.  The family loved this dish and really raved about it.  I used chicken instead of rabbit...the only request they made was that next time I use boneless chicken (they are so spoiled!).  I will be making this again and again.

I tried this one today. I didn't have saffron so I used a little curry. It was very good.

This is a really interesting recipe.  Not for everyone but if you like something a bit different this is great.  Very tasty, I served this for dinner guests and everyone was blown away.  I didn't use all of the water, only about half and I used frozen peas, excellent.  Serve with a spiced rice or mashed potatoes.

Great dish! It's very close to one my abuelita used to make. I've made it a couple times with bone-in cut up chicken legs and thighs. Be sure to simmer on very low heat, so the chicken stays tender. The 2nd time, I used chicken broth instead of water, only because I had some lying around. I serve it with rice, because it makes a lot of "pot liquor".

I had just bought a rabbit and this recipe happened along.  I  was  attracted by the unusual mix of ingredients.  The idea of potatoes didn't appeal, but I finally put in a couple of very small ones.  I was right and if I make this again I will leave them out.  I forgot all about the peas, but wouldn't put them in.  I followed the measures, with the exception of the green peppers, capers, raisins and olives.  I put in amounts that suited me.  It was delicious and I had so much sauce left that in the evening I ate it again with another meat.

Good recipe, raisins added a interesting element.  Didn't have enough White wine so substituted some red wine about an 1/8 cup.  Cooked in the recommended time rabbit was a little tough.  Took left over rabbit and placed in a pressure cooker for 11 minutes with liquid from recipe added an extra cup of water for the pressure cooking.  Rabbit was then fall off the bone.  De-boned and returned mixture to vegetables.
