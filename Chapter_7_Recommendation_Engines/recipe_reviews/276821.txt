Made this as a meal unto itself. So good, so flavorful. Very rich tasting! I used more chicken livers than stated because thats the package i had, 12oz..  I adjusted the broth amount to accommodate that. This recipe makes a lot of rice, next time I will cut it in half.

I loved the liver in this dish - i even went with 10 ounces of the love. 

However, the cumin was rather overpowering. I will cut back on that in future attempts. I would also add more celery - but that is just my preference. 

I used bacon instead of pork chops - worked well. The texture of this dish is complex & refreshing. I liked the leftovers, as the flavors seem to gel a little better on night 2.
