This recipe sounded intriguing and somewhat confusing. In the list of ingredients it lists 2 teaspoons of butter to toast the pecans, but in the directions it stated 2 tablespoons of butter. Unfortunately I used the 2 tablespoons which made the pecans too oily. Also, I think the pecans should be changed to 1 cup and perhaps a 1/4 cup of sugar would be sufficient if you use a high quality pure maple syrup as I did. Perhaps delete the salt if using salted butter, or use unsalted butter. I will make this recipe again though with these alterations.

Wow! This is the recipe that has inspired me to write my first review! It was sooo good! I even had to sub some walnuts for the pecans since I didn't have quite enough, and it was still scrumptious. I did use others' suggestions and added a Tablespoon of flour to the filling, and only used 2 teaspoons of butter to toast the nuts.  I also took a chance and subbed dark brown sugar for the white sugar. The maple flavoring was subtle and not overpowering. It was amazing; this is the first pecan pie I've made (and I've made many) that didn't have the sugary liquid oozing into the crust and making it soggy.  I will never use another pecan pie recipe again!  My taste buds thank you for helping me make my favorite pie at home, however, my waistline does not!

I have this recipe and I won 2nd place at the county fair. It is the best I have ever had. Always requested. For a nice presentation I take whole pecans and line it around the edge of the pie pan. I also only use a quiche dish for this one and it looks great, no crust edge to worry about!

This was a very good pecan pie recipe, but I felt that it was missing something. I was out of corn syrup and CRAVING pecan pie like no one's business, so I was very excited to find a recipe that called for maple syrup, as I had that on hand. It was the high grade kind, and although I did like the somewhat mild flavor, I still thought that the pie could have used a little more depth of flavor. I didn't toast the pecans in the butter- I just did them in the toaster oven- so perhaps that was the culprit. In any event, I think that when I make it next time I will add a few tablespoons of JD whiskey to amph it up a bit :)

I am not a huge pecan pie fan due to the rishness and way to sweetness.  My husband made this reciope and I thought it was the best I ever had.  Between the 2 of us the pie was gone in 3 days.  I love the texture of the inside layer..kind of a custard like texture..was awesome.

I have been making this recipe for several years, and I will never use another recipe for pecan pie.  Some people like their pecan pie gummy, but this is exactly how it should be with maple syrup!  I do use store bought crusts to make it easier because I usually make a lot at once, but any crust will work.  I toasted the pecans once, but prefer not to do that.  I put tinfoil carefully around the edges of the crust to keep them from turning too brown.  I use vanilla from Mexico.  Thanks for this recipe!  Everyone loves it (and I live in the South - if that tells you anything).  I do not use the exact time because of the oven, but pull it out when it puffs lightly in the center and does not jiggle.

I used the filling recipe for this pie with the crust from the Southern Pecan Pie II recipe.  The filling is delicious.  If I were to make this pie again, I would probably increase the volume of ingredients by at least 1/3.

If you are looking for a recipe that doesnt use corn syrup as a base, this is it.  I have been looking for a good pecan pie for my boyfriend, and I found it.  He ate the whole thing.  This is amazing!!

Great Pecan Pie. I make it for the holidays and even my mother-in-law asked for the recipe. Always the first pie to disappear.

Because of other reviewers that had said it was missing something, I added my Grandmas touches and also made this recipe 1 1/2 time for deep dish pie crust. Missing ingr. that Grandma uses is 1/3 cup cream and it's the bomb.  This is delicious with the addition.  I will keep this one in my file!  Also, would rate 5 with cream added.  No need to toast pecans, they do that in the pie.

I live abroad and have a really tough time finding corn syrup, but have found a few stores that have maple syrup, which makes this recipe perfect.  Living around a bunch of other Americans, we tend to get nostalgic for home-style Thanksgiving festivities, so we end up having dinner together.  I made this pie last year and my friends raved!  They have put in an order for this year:-)

This is the best pecan Pie I have ever tasted!  Love that it's not gooey like other pies I've made with corn syrup--the real maple syrup make a big difference.  I added the chopped nuts and then added whole pecans on top to make it look prettier.  I bought a deep dish pan so I made 1 and 1/2 times the recipe.  Everyone loved it so it's going into my holiday recipe list!

This is a great pie. Not too sweet! My husband loves maple syrup and pecan pie is his favorite. Love cooking the nuts. Sent this to my sister who is allergic to corn and can't have food with corn products in them.

The cooking time was off, for me, the pie was a bit soupy but I get that with 99% of the pecan pie recipes I make.  And I am not sure why exactly, lol.  The maple syrup was a nice change, thanks, it was interesting.

This is a great recipe.  I've seen a lot of pecan pies that once cut, the center oozes.  This one has a great consistency and held up after slicing.  Not runny at all.

This was a great pecan pie recipe. It is easy to make and it doesn't have  the really sweet taste. The maple syrup is a really good idea.  I used a store bought pie shell and it turned out OK.  I did use about 2 TBSP of flour in the pecan filling because some reviewers mentioned that there's didn't hold together well and that turned out great.  Took it to a gathering and everyone loved it. One person said it was the best pecan pie she had eaten.  Thanks for sharing it.

This is a delicious pie, with a more sophisticated flavor and a little lighter than the standard pecan pie. I used 2 teaspoons (not 2 tablespoons) of butter to brown the pecans, as another reviewer suggested. I also added a tablespoon of bourbon to the maple syrup mix, and was pleased that I did.

I absolutely love this recipe. I don't like eating whole pecans on my pie because it's a small hassle to always chop them up, or to eat the pecans separate from the rest of the pie filling. This recipe is so easy to make and super yummy. I will say though that if you have a deep dish pie pan (my ceramics seem to be deeper than the glass ones) then to double the filling recipe. This is now a house hold must every holiday for the past 2 years.

This is the first pecan pie recipe I've tried. I added two tablespoons of flour (per other reviewers advice) and adjusted baking temp/time due to altitude+finicky oven but other than those minor bits, I followed the recipe and was stoked with the result. 

I recommend this/will likely make this again.

this recipe is FANTASTIC! It's the best pecan pie I've ever made.  Toasting the pecans in butter makes for an incredible rich taste.  I made one minor change and added a tsp of flour to the egg mixture, something my grandmother always did - and the syrup part of the pie is the perfect consistency.

This pie is absolutely delicious....and maple syrup is much healthier than using corn syrup...I also used evaporated cane juice crystals in place of refined white sugar.  I made more the next night, my family liked it so much.

I must admit, I was skeptical while this pie was cooking, because it seemed like it was puffing up like a cake would, instead of setting like a normal pecan pie... But then I tasted it. It isn't spongy like a cake, but the top is perfect with a delightful crispiness and the inside is the most moist (but not soggy), delicious, perfect pie I've ever tasted. Pecan pie is my husband's favorite, so I made it as a reward for making it to Phase 3 of the Maker's Diet, and I made the following substitutions:
-I used a sourdough crust with the recipe found here: http://www.freshhealthycooking.com/Sourdough_crust.html
-1/4 cup stevia instead of 1/2 cup sugar
-I used the amount of butter in the directions (2 TBSP)for the pecans instead of the amount in the ingredients list (2tsp)

Even though maple syrup is on the expensive side, it sooo makes this recipe.  I added some half pecans on top for looks.  There wasn't a slice left of this at the end of the Thanksgiving dinner-and I had hoped to take a couple of pieces home for next-day leftovers!  Delicious and easy.

Great, simple recipe. My special touch is 1 to 2 TBSP of brandy added to the mix. Serve it slightly warm with whipped topping & chocolate shavings.

If you want to make this recipe even more *healthy* you can substitute sucanet for the sugar.

Thanks for the corn syrup alternative. I always made pecan pie (at holidays) for my husband because he needed it for memories' sake. But the thought of all that corn syrup made me sick just to imagine eating it. This recipe seemed so healthy; to use natural ingredients and no shortening to boot! This is not a low fat dessert though. But If you've got to have pecan pie on the menu; this is the one to go with.

I don't like my pecan pie too sweet, so I loved this recipe.  Toasting the pecans enhanced the flavor of the nuts and made this pie taste perfect.  It will be a regular on my Thanksgiving table!!!

People rave about this pie when I make it. I made a few changes.  First of all, I use only organic ingredients.  Secondly, I substituted organic brown rice syrup for the maple syrup.  Then I upped the sugar to 3/4 cup to compensate for not using maple syrup.  And, finally, I used Laura's "No Roll Pie Crust II."  Be sure to bake it in a Teflon or silicone pie pan.  After several successes with this recipe, I tried an aluminum pie pan and the pie never set (odd, I know).

I make this every year to rave reviews.  My mother says, "I'm 76 years old and this is the best pecan pie I've ever put in my mouth".  I do cheat though and use refrigerated pie crust.  5 stars!  This is a fantastic recipe!

Wonderful flavor, I think it was roasting the pecans in the butter before putting them in the pie that gave it a full flavor.  Would make again

I will have to make this every holiday now!  The maple syrup was a very nice touch.  I think I might try it with half maple syrup and half corn syrup next time, as I thought it had a strange taste that was a little eggy.  Other than that, the pie set up perfectly, wasn't runny at all.

Phenomenal Pecan pie recipe! I made the filling exactly as directed. I used a premade deep dish pie crust to save time. Make sure to cover the edges of the pie crust with foil so it doesn't get too brown. I am known for making the best pies, but it's all about the recipe! This is definitely going to be  added to my 5 star collection!

Made this, and was very tastie, I just substituted sweetener for real sugar. And found it wasn't overly sweet, the maple syrup was more noticed also.
But I did add a touch of Disoronno . Added a nice touch.

Loved this! I actually used a frozen pastry crust, so it saved even more time. Also, I began making a different recipe, then found this one - so here were my changes based because I already put in 1 C brown sugar. I used 3/4 C maple syrup instead and no white sugar. Also, I didn't toast the nuts. From the freezer I chopped them & added them to the mixture. Loved it - so did my family!!

I made this recipe for my father and added a bit more pecans and the JD that someone else had recommended (about a shots worth)... (added a bit of flour so it wouldn't be too watery when cut into...) My dad said it was the best pecan pie he's ever tasted...

The maple syurp is what sets it off. I made no alterations to the recipe, and it turned out lovley.I also only used two teaspoons of buter. But i dont think it  would have made that much of a difference if i would have used two tablespoons. it still would have been amazing.    thank you for sharing this recipe with us!

This was my first pecan pie ever and it was a hit at Thanksgiving! I too used the smaller amount of butter when toasting the pecans. I also used 1 T of bourbon as someone else suggested and it was TERRIFIC!!! I have definitely saved this one as one of my favorite recipes!!!

This was so good!!  I made couple of adjustments to it though.  I used pre-made pie crust and since I don't like things too sweet I skipped sugar and added just maple syrup.  What made it even better is that I got pesticide free pecans from my local farmers market.  We ate it with soy vanilla ice cream.  It was one of the best deserts I have ever had!

I found this recipe because I was searching for one that didn't use corn syrup for a picky friend.  Turns out, maple syrup is way better anyway!  Gives is a rich, almost smoky flavor.  It's really special.  I make this pie for basically every winter holiday, and any other time I can find an excuse.  I made a couple for a bake sale, and they literally sold before I put them down on the table.  The smell alone will blow your mind.   This is a simply awesome recipe.

I made my first ever pecan pie using this recipe. It was a great success! I was glad to find it called for maple syrup instead of corn syrup. My guy prefers real maple syrup so we always have some on hand. The recipe was easy to follow. The only problem I had was with the store bought crust, it was soggy. I have added this recipe to my files and it will be the only one I use.

I made this pie last week & it is tasty.  However, I found it to be too "wet" & I think the maple syrup, while lending a nice flavor, was a little overpowering.  I think next time, I will use half as much syrup.  But it looked beautiful & everyone else loved it.

This is the best Pecan Pie recipe I have used.  My husband has never been a big fan of pies with nuts but he requests this pecan pie.  The maple syrup is what makes the difference.

Unfortunately I did not get to taste this pie as I made it for an office party and there were no leftovers (which is a pretty good recommendation in and of itself) but I will say that I've done a lot of baking in my time and nothing else has ever made my apartment smell so good.
