I think there's a typo.  3 tbsp cornstarch will NEVER dissolve into 2 tbsp of soy sauce.  I added more soy, plus some olive oil and sesame seed oil just to get the hard as a rock mixture to dissolve.  We all missed sauce--there was no sauce over the spaghetti, which could be considered a crime in my house.  I say, personally--quadruple (or more) the sauce, follow directions and just before adding the noodles, dump the marinade into the fry pan, cook for a few minutes, THEN toss your spaghetti.  Voil√†...sauce.  I made this on Sunday, bagged everything and finished it on Monday without issue--great for a make ahead and finish off meal!  Thanks!

This looks like an amazing, easy lo mein - lo mein is not a saucy recipe, it is more of a side dish. I bet the basic recipe could be altered to add any type of protein in it - definitely a keeper!

Instead of soy sauce I used Bragg Liquid Aminos All Purpose Seasoning and GF noodles.  Great healthy recipe.

This is indeed a very adaptable recipe. I followed other reviewers' advice and did not use the water, and cut down the chicken broth to one cup. I also added a little of almost every Asian sauce, including hoisin and oyster, and I simmered it somewhere between five to ten minutes. The result was pretty thick, with enough sauce that I made extra noodles to mix in.  But it tasted pretty good!  It's a good recipe in that you can use whatever vegetables you like and change the sauce up too, depending on what consistency you prefer.

I have never made lo mein. Was so happy to find this was a very easy recipe, tasted good and I had everything in the house. I didn't have quite enough celery so added very thin cabbage slices and it was still great! Will make it again!
Thank you, Cookie Gram Dorothy

Very good, not buried in sauce.  I think next time I will put the onions in little later than the rest of the veggies so they don't get so soft.

Very good and couldn't be easier. I threw in what veggies I had in the fridge along with some smallish packages of beef and chicken I had in the freezer. Kids loved the sauce this one is a total keeper for us.

This dish turned out well after a few tweaks. I used minced garlic instead of the powder and added a splash of sesame oil to the marinade. I only added 1-1/2 TBSP of corn starch after reading the reviews. Once the chicken was no longer pink, I removed it and kept it warm. After the veggies were soft, I added about 8 oz of chicken broth, plus 1-1/2 TBSP corn starch to some cold broth. I stirred it until smooth, and then threw it in when I added the chicken and noodles back in, which made a nice sauce that wasn't too thick. I took the chicken out when it was no longer pink and held it out until the veggies were soft. I used Lo Mein noodles from the store. They were ok but not as good as what I get when ordering out. I'll try spaghetti next time. My whole family liked this. My son is the pickiest and he ate it. I'll save this one and use it again.

I made this last night for dinner.  The marinade was way to thick and I agree with the other reviews.  I added about a 1/4 cup of Hosin sause to the stirfry.  I also used angel hair spaghetti.  I loved it...my husband thought said it left a great taste on his tongue!!

I made a few changes. After reading other reviews, I used only 1.5 T corn starch, but doubled other ingredients in marinade, used linguine instead of spaghetti, and sprinkled soy sauce over noodles when combining with the other ingredients. I also used shredded carrots because I had them on hand. Turned out very well.

Very good, easy recipe. I halved the cornstarch like a lot of other reviewers as well as added minced garlic to the marinade. Thank you for sharing.

I used half the amount of corn starch the recipe calls for & more soy sauce than it calls for. By doing that it tasted pretty good.

I'm rating it on flavor that I improved.  I added soy sauce to the water to boil the pasta instead of salt.  Wasn't enough liquid for the sauce so I added a Tbsp of sherry.  Also 1/2 t. chicken granules.  For the amount of chicken and sauce I only used 1/4 lb. of pasta.  8 oz. seemed too much.  The sauce stuck to the heavy skillet I used.  I would use a different method for cooking it.  It had pretty good flavor and pretty nutritious.

It was ok. Better than I expected, but I had to add quite a bit of water for it to have any sauce. I probably won't make it again.

One of my favorite ways to use chicken and broccoli.   I triple  the marinade ingredients so that I have some left after I put the chicken in the pan.   When I add the noodles i add about 1/2 cup chicken broth to the remaining marinade which adds more flavor to the spaghetti.

I made this  the first time as  originally  written. The second time I made a few changes. First I made double the marinade...4 Tbsp. soy sauce, 1 1/2 Tbsp. cornstarch, 2 Tbsp. minced garlic, 1/2 tsp ginger.  The rest of the recipe as written and added a sprinkling of ground ginger and soy sauce to veggies while cooking. Also used angel hair pasta. This was a delicious dish either way and will definately make it again. Thanks.

Super good and easy! Added my favorite veggies (snap peas, green peppers and snow peas), so I was able to make it 100% my own. Plus, it works perfectly for lunch at work today. Definitely going to make this again!

I used coconut oil which was good. I also added a little teriyaki sauce. I also tripled the sauce. The corn starch definitely didn't dissolve in what was described in the original recipe. I used the suggestion of another reviewer and added oil (2T) and an extra soy T to the sauce recipe. I made 2 batches to marinate in, and since I used coconut oil I had no excess to toss into the noodles at the end(which was also a suggestion, not original recipe). In comes the 3rd batch. Mixed it in with my noodles when they were done and then tossed it all together. It was super tasty and my family really enjoyed it! Thanks for the recipe :)

We enjoyed this, but I did add a little teriaki because I was nervous it would come out bland. My husband complimented the dish a number of times.

I didn't hate it. I wished there was more sauce. I made it without the chicken as a side to Baked Teriyaki Chicken(also on this site). I ended up adding about 2 tbsp. oyster sauce, a dash more soy sauce, and a tbsp. water just to thin out the peanut butter like texture. I cooked it with a mixture of olive and sesame seed oil instead of the vegetable oil. The flavor was there, but it definitely could have used more sauce.

Love this recipe. I remove the chicken after it was cooked. Also I broke up the spaghetti then added the chicken back at the end.

all that cornstarch made the chicken gummy, i had to add water while cooking chicken.  I used a considerable amount of minced garlic, added ponzu (or soy), oyster sauce, more ginger and white sugar at the end with the noodles.  I also let the meal sit a while with the lid on so the noodles would 'soak up' the flavor.  It was very good this way.

I wanted a new way of fixing chicken, and since I have always loved lo mein, I thought I'd give it a try, and I'm glad I did.  The marinade was exceptionally delicious, and even if I never make lo mein again (which I am sure I will), I will marinate and cook the chicken just to eat by itself--it's that good. I love the fact that it uses ingredients you would normally keep on hand.

My kids liked it. Way too much cornstarch for the ratio. Add a little hoisin sauce next time, less cornstarch, and a smidge of water.

This was not like any Lo Mein I've ever tasted.  There was no orienta flavor and not enough garlic.  Would not make it again.
