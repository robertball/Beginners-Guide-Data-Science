This dish gets better with age!  Every day it is in the fridge the tastes soak into the noodles and chicken.  I make this on the weekend and take it to work with me all week. You have to love vinegar though!

I didn't think that the flavors blended well at all - until the next day.  This dish is definitely better as leftovers.

I will not make this again. It might have been the balsamic vinegar, it just wasn't very good.

I had some leftover Braised Balsamic Chicken from this site and I thought this might be a good way to use them up. The chicken had soaked the balsamic so I had to add a little more and I also added a little olive oil at the end. It's okay but it's probably not something I'll make again though.

This was really good. My family really enjoyed it. I think next time I might leave out the chicken all together. Good either way.

I make this a lot. It's great for company and it doesn't require any sides. It has everything, protein, veggies, carbs. I like to add crumbled feta and cherrie tomatoes. Delete the chicken and it's an awesome vegetarian dish. Basalmic vinegar is the bomb!
