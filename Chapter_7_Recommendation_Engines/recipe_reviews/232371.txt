People at work raved about how light and delish these are and enjoyed the icing...turned out moist, light and tasty! Easy to make.

I didn't change a thing in the recipe. The cupcakes were delicious! Perfectly moist and fluffy. I didn't have the ingredients to do the icing but it sounds wonderful.

Cupcake was good.  Moist and light.  For the frosting I used lemon juice instead of the lemon zest for more flavor.    This recipe made 13 cupcakes for me.

I only rated this a 3 star recipe.  The cupcakes were nice and light, but I made these because of the "lemon".  My family likes lemon anything and these did not have much of a lemon taste.  Trying to figure out how to make these with more lemon flavor.  Perhaps some lemon juice in the batter AND the frosting.

This recipe/dish was fantastic and went very quickly!!!  Everyone (family and/or friends) enjoyed this dessert meal – the only complaint was that no one could get seconds.   I allow for seconds after I have cooked the dish for a first time.  That being said there will definitely be a next time as this dessert dish is going into the family’s meal rotation.

I made it with lime zest, because y' know put the lime in the coconut....  I like lime and coconut.  They were delicious.  The cream cheese icing was really good.

These were delicious. I sprinkled coconut on top before baking, because I didn't have the ingredients to make the frosting. My husband really liked them, so I will make again. Next time I will try the frosting.

The taste of these cupcakes was very good, but they were too dense for me. I think next time I'll omit the yolk. I would've liked more coconut flavor im thr cake so maybe I'll use coconut milk. the icing was very good! all in all a good cupcake.

I used sifted GF (Gluten Free) Namaste flour blend in place of the all-purpose wheat flour and reconstituted powdered coconut milk in place of the milk.  Those were the only changes that I made and they turned out moist, light, and delicious!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I really liked these cupcakes! Very easy to make and delicious. They are a medium density cupcake,  I prefer a lighter cake or you add some sweetened condensed milk or creamed coconut to make them thicker/ richer. I also used lime zest in the frosting instead of lemon. 5/7 will make again!

This cupcake recipe was nice but were not light and airy enough. I have been making cupcakes for a long time now and this could have been a little better. As for the lemon taste it was very faint so I added a tablespoon of lemon juice to the frosting to give it more zing and that worked out much better!! Used some green desert food coloring and had some with strawberries and others with a lemon kiwi strawberry version. Maybe next time I will add a little more milk.

I wanted more lemon in this so I added lemon juice and lemon zest.  But then I accidentally dumped in way more coconut than called for . . .so ended up with much more coconut-y cupcakes than planned.  Guess that's what happens when I use the bag to measure instead of a cup.  Oh, well.  Took them to work and they were gobbled up.  I didn't make the frosting--have frosting I was trying to get rid of, but the cupcakes were decent with the added lemon.  I may try these again without so much coconut, but they still were pretty good.  Thanks for the recipe!
