This recipe was almost perfect, but I would make two alterations. First I would add more strawberries to really get the flavor. Then, instead of blending the strawberries with two tablespoons of sugar, I would blend them with a quarter cup of sugar...it was quite tart! Also...you will need about eight standard lemons to get enough lemon juice.

I was assigned to bring lemonade to a birthday lunch, so thought I would make it a bit more special and made this. I doubled it using my Breville juicer, so I had pure strawberry juice. I used 4 cups of lemon juice to 2 cups of strawberry juice and that worked well. I also warmed a few cups of water and let the sugar dissolve, added ice to cool, then added the balance of the water. I also used a mini muffin tray, placed a small strawberry in each, then filled with spring water to use as the ice cubes in a large serving container. Between the beautiful pink color and the strawberry ice cubes, it was a such a pretty presentation well received! Thanks! Fun recipe!

Really good and refreshing drink.  For my own tastes, I'll probably add a few more strawberries next time to balance out the lemon-strawberry flavor.  Honestly, guess mine was not "all natural," since I used Truvia instead of sugar, but you'd never know that (no aftertaste).  Thanks David Tate, this is very nice.

There were some tips I wanted to add on submission but they were edited out:

-I favor the "lemon" part of the lemonade so the recipe has a good kick to it. If you prefer a sweeter drink, try using less lemon juice. The sugar on the blended strawberries just acts as a flavor enhancer.

-It takes anywhere from 8-10 lemons to yield 2 cups of juice. The best is handmade of course--but be sure to swirl your pitchers a bit before serving!

It was super good. I made it for my sister and her friend and they loved it. I would suggest using 10 strawberries instead of 8. It gives it a better taste.

This recipe was very simple and delicious. I added stevia to mine and instead of freshly squeezed lemon juice I used 2 cups of that 100% natural lemon juice that's usually found in a green bottle. Perfect use for a chunk of the strawberries we picked recently!

I did strain the strawberry mixture after blending to remove some of the seeds.  Really like the sweet/tart level.

I made a double batch for the Fourth of July and put it in a beverage dispenser. I used a lot more strawberries and a little more sugar because it seems that strawberries are not as sweet as they used to be. They are very tart. It was a hit. The only problem I had was that about half way through I had to put a ladle in the dispenser because the pulp clogged the spout. There was a lot of pulp from the strawberries I had liquified in the blender. Next time I might strain it first.  Two thumbs up from me ??

This drink was amazing! But it was not fun squeezing all those dern lemons!! I squeezed a whole bag and had just under 2 cups lemon juice. I used 10 strawberries. Also used a simple syrup. I have to get a juicer if I'm going to make this again.

I used half the lemon juice the recipe called for and I think I like it better that way.  I used concentrated lemon juice because that was what I had and I used half sugar/half xylitol and it came out delicious.

It was very simple to make, but it was SO bitter! You can't taste the strawberries either.  I had to add an extra cup of sugar and 7 more cups of water.  I would not make it again.

An excellent drink!! I used a sieve to strain the strawberries So that there wasn't a whole bunch of seeds in my drink. I added an extra cup of water to be able to fill my container. I taste-tested the drink before and after I added water. I didn't taste much difference I think the only difference would be it will be less sugar. I'm sure I will drink this more than just in the summer. It's very refreshing.

Love the recipe! Just made a few changes like adding more strawberries and sprinkling them with a little sugar to pull out the natural juices. Also made a simple syrup to sweeten it a bit. Will make this a regular, will also try with raspberries.

This was gross! Couldn’t taste strawberries or lemons! Tasted like water with chunks. We put 10 lemons in and still didn’t get a good taste based on what the recipe said to do. This sucked!

I made this with and for my son and we thought it could be a little sweeter.  I think our strawberries were more on the tart side, so next time I'll adjust as needed.

This was a simple recipe and definitely quenched my thirst for lemonade! I only used 1/3c sugar though, to cut down on sweetness. Poured over ice and it was perfect!

Super simple and quick to make! I would suggest using warm-hot water to dissolve the sugar faster. Then refrigerate after. Also, i would definitely add more strawberries than you think you need and possibly even more lemon juice! But overall a very good recipe!

I made it for my family with a bbq dinner and it was great! It didn't take as long to make as I thought and I squeezed the lemons with a handheld device. If I was in a hurry O'd consider using store bought lemon juice from a bottle as it may be a little faster to make it that way. If you're looking for a nice treat for your friends and  family then try this recipe for strawberry lemonade!

We used a couple more strawberries than called for, and liquefied them with the water and sugar in our Bullet blender.
We used about 1 1/2 cups or so of lemon juice, because that's how much juice we got from our lemons.  We spun the juice and pulp in the Bullet, also.
Except for a bit less lemon juice, followed the recipe, and it was delicious; I don't think I would want any more lemon than we had.
 Made 2 quarts.

I increased the amount of lemon juice to 2.5 cups and added 3/4 cups of sugar instead of the full cup. This created a nice tart lemonade that still was sweet.

IT was good, but I had to add 2 more lemons for the full lemonade flavor, it tasted way too watery, and I added a few extra strawberries because who doesn't love strawberries.

Never really been good at making smoothies even though I follow directions so wasn't sure how lemonade would turn out.  I used a whole plastic bin of strawberries ( what my husband didn't eat the night before but a little more than 8 medium sized ) followed the measurements of the recipe otherwise and this was perfect.  Everyone loved it!  Nice combo of tart and sweet.  Very easy to make, will do again and again.

I used this as a base line for my first attempt. I only wanted one glass full so I divided it all up very roughly... I ended up with a little more than needed and let my friend try it :P

I added way more strawberries than suggested - about 7 smallish strawberries, half a cup of lemon juice and a cup and a half of water along with 2 tablespoons of sugar... I could have put less sugar in probably...

Super easy to make. I only used 1 cup of lemon juice as that's all I had and I used 1/2 cup sugar to start with. Way too sweet for me. I stopped at the 1/2 cup sugar. I did add more strawberries for a stronger color and flavor. My husband gave it a 10 ( he does have a sweeter tooth than I) I left it to his taste and added water to my cup and it was perfect.

I made a half batch as a trial run before a birthday party and it is a hit! I did use 8 frozen organic strawberries in the half batch, and I recommend doubling the berries. It was wonderful.

This is refreshing and tasty. The strawberries add nice color and flavor. I made a simple syrup with the sugar and 1 cup of the water before adding it in. The final mixture was very strong - it needed over two cups of additional water to get to the right strength.

Delicious and very refreshing! The flavor was perfect and our children devoured it. This reminds me of the strawberry lemonade that they make in the steakhouse restaurants. Yum.

This recipe is delicious. I did do as some other reviewers did and added a few more strawberries and 2 tbs more sugar when puréeing the strawberries. I'll definitely make again.

Instead of sugar I added sweet and low. Next time I'll add more strawberries and maybe more lemon juice    (Ps: it takes about 15 different size lemons to get 2 cups of juice.

I halved the recipe because I only had six lemons. I tested out my Cuisinart juicer for the first time and it yielded exactly the right amount of juice. Based on other reviews, I used one extra strawberry. I blended that portion in the Vitamix. Everything came together beautifully. I recommend the author's suggestion of swirling the pitcher each time before pouring. This delicious drink didn't last halfway through dinner, everyone gulped it down!

This turned out great! Added 2 extra strawberries to get more of a strawberry taste. Really easy to make! Had a blast making this with my three year old. Oh! And it is a plus that the whole house smells like lemons!

Made this with a bag of lemons to get the 2 cups. I also used Splenda instead of sugar cuz I had some and it dissolves nicely. Was just a subtitle taste of the strawberry. Would be nice with whole blackberries or blueberries in it!

With modifications, this recipe has just the right balance of sweet and tart with noticeable strawberry flavor.  I made changes suggested in other reviews.  I used 10 strawberries instead of 6, and I increased the sugar to 1/4 cup in the strawberry mixture.  I took the time to dissolve the sugar and water on the stove, once for the strawberry mixture and again for the lemon mixture.  I decreased the lemon juice, using 1 1/2 cups instead of 2.  After combining the strawberry and lemon mixtures together to cool in the fridge, I also stirred about 1/4 tsp. ground ginger (not fresh) into the pitcher, just because I love the subtle crispness it adds.  Chill well before serving and garnish with a lemon slice.  Delicious and very pretty!

Best strawberry lemonade recipe!  The proportions are perfect.  I was worried it wasn't enough strawberry at first, but was pleasantly surprised.  We sugar the rim of our glasses to serve.  This is a favorite.

I think I added many more strawberries than what the recipe called for, so my lemonade came out thick, more like a smoothie, but it was really good. Just for the fun of it, I also added chia seeds... Left them soaking in water the night before.

This was fantastic. I used twice the amount of strawberries because I love them so much. The only thing I will do different next time is a little more sugar to make it a little more sweet.
