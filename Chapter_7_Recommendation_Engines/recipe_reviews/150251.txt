EXCELLENT!  I just made this for dinner tonight and my husband & I were amazed. We used to order shish tawook all the time at a Lebanese restaurant in our old neighborhood. Now that we've moved, we haven't found a place that serves this so I've experimented with several other recipes and they were all disappointing.  But this one is JUST RIGHT!!!  Very authentic tasting. I modified it slightly to suit our (spicy) tastes by adding more oregano, a little dried mint, turmeric, and  a couple dashes of cayenne pepper.

Although this recipe had fewer reviews than the other shish tawook chicken recipe in allrecipes, i chose to try out this recipe as the ingredts in this recipe appeared more authentic. Im so glad tht i made the right choice - this shish tawook chicken was delicious! It was moist and full of flavour! I added a few more cloves of garlic, reduced the cinnamon to a pinch and added a few dashes or turmeric powder, cayenne pepper and paprika.  My family had this for dinner with pita bread ( recipe from allrecipes ) and the dipping sauce ( from the other shish tawook recipe in allrecipes ) This recipe is a keeper!!

This is really good! I wasn't sure the weight of the chicken I was using. I did use 3 really large chicken breasts and got 7 sticks. Cardamom is not easy to find and it is expensive so I found on-line that a subtitute is equal parts of cinnamon and nutmeg and used that. I also do not care for black pepper so I did not add it. For the onions I went with red onions as it didn't specify. I was busy all day and they marinated a total of 10 hours. Normally over marinating chicken can cause a bitter taste but it didn't at all. I don't have access to a grill so I broiled them in the house. I set the rack two down from the top and set the broiler to high. I lined a pan with tall sides with foil and broiled half of them at a time. For my oven it was 8 minutes then I flipped it for 5 minutes then one more flip for 2 minutes. Delicious!

This was wonderful delicious and very tender/moist. I did not have the allspice so that was omitted. This recipe is SO MUCH better than another from this site which claims to be authentic yet uses katchup and mustard. Thanks!

This was absolutely wonderful. My husband and I both really love shish tawook chicken and it was great to find a good authentic recipe. I left out the tomato paste but it still tasted just like our favorite middle eastern restaurant. It's especially good if you use the Thick-Style Lebanese Garlic Sauce (see recipe on this site) with it and wrap the chicken in a warm pita!

Delicious! I make this at least once a week. I use butterflied chicken breast and grill it as is (I'm too lazy for skewers). Not only is it easy but you can keep it in the marinade if your dinner plans change and the flavor gets better! Hubby and I eat it with rice and with hummus.

This was average.  I would not make this recipe again as writtten. I was surprised that it was so bland; I've never found that to be true of Middle Eastern food. I would increase the salt and add cayenne for spice.

Absolutely delicious. We ate it with brown rice and spinach and I cooked it under the broiler. It would probably be even better outside on the grill as the recipe states. For lunch the next day we ate the leftovers in pitas with homemade hummus. Yum!!

I LOVE shish tawook. I get it all the time at a restaurant near me. If I could eat it everyday I would! Either in salad form sandwich form or just by itself it's wonderful! Thanks for posting this I will definitely have to try it at home now!

WOW- juicy tender tasty and authentic! I marinated the chicken breast strips for 24 hours before cooking them under the broiler. Normally I am not a big fan of skinless chicken especially the breast. This recipe will be made again and again with the oh so good for you skinless breast. The only changes I will make next time and just my personal preference will be to up the amount of spice but thats just me. The friends who shared this as part of our Middle Eastern dinner party and have traveled that part of the world said the taste was perfect. The left overs were incredible cold the next day.Thank you for sharing an authentic recipe.

OMG this recipe is the BOMB! Made it last night and now eating the few leftovers. Cardamon is expensive cost me 10 but it was worth it to be able to make these kabobs at home. Followed the recipe to a T except for adding a little mint cayenne and turmeric; chicken was very tender it does make a lot of sauce so next time I will just add more chicken. Served this with Tabbouleh III Hummus III and the Lebanese Garlic Sauce from this site. Had an awesome meal! No more need to drive 20 miles to the Lebanese restaurant.

This is great marinade for chicken. It is missing something though I am of arab decent and i have had this many times in arab countries and it doesn't taste quite the same but pretty darn close. I think I would add a little more salt and some chilli powder. Otherwise great recipe....thanks a bunch chicken was soooo tender!!

Seriously tasty stuff. I lived in the Middle East 8 years and this is what I would typically order at local food eateries. Highly recommend. Used 1/2 Tablespoon fresh Oregano for the the dried the recipe called for taste was SUPER. Easy and tasty!

I was hesitant to buy the expensive cardamom but I'm glad I did. I'll be making this dish often. It tasted just like the local restaurant. I also marinated some carrot slices in half the sauce and skewered them too. Perfect!

Absolutely delicious! We live in Chicago and have a Middle Eastern restaurant that we adore so I thought I'd try to make a variation of their chicken kabobs. It turned out almost identical! I always wondered what gave it that unique flavor.. It's definitely the cinnamon and allspice! Will make this again and again!

Excellent recipe! This is my first review in this site. I'm from Syria a middle eastern country. All restaurants in our countries serve Shish Tawook so it's easy for us to know if a recipe is good or not. Originally Shish Tawook doesn't have oregano. But I used it just to try a new flavor (it was my first time preparing it at home anyways:D)I made it indoors with a grilling pan. They turned out SUPER and my husband and I really enjoyed them. The chicken turned out tender and full of flavor. I served it with white rice and buttered corn and peas.. Loved it!

We thought this was completely tasteless! I made it true to recipe and we were so excited to taste it bec it smelled awesome on the grill. It came out nice and tender but was so bland that we had to conjure up our own curry sauce to go with it. I suppose if you like really mild tasting chicken try this. Else I would at least double the spices I think or let marinade more than 24 hours.

Exceptionally moist and flavorful grilled chicken! I prepared the marinade as published but after tasting found it a tad too sour. I added some garlic powder in addition to the minced (we like garlicky!) and another teaspoon of tomato paste. Perfect! Served with salad & naan. Loved this dish Noor thanks for sharing with us.

left out the cinnamon and allspice as we don't care for it in savory dishes so this probably made it very unauthentic. Subbed a few shakes of paprika and turmeric. Used greek yogurt so my marinade was a bit thick but I wanted to try a yogurt marinade to see if it kept the chicken moist - this definitely did. Family gobbled it up.

This was very good. I marinated closer to 8 hours because of my schedule and the meat was very tender and flavorful. This is an unusual combination of flavors for us. It was my first experience with cardamom a very pungent and resin-y aromatic. My only change to the ingredients was to use olive oil in place of the vegetable oil. This fills the bill for change-of-pace dining!

Excellent. I made only minor changes: halved the recipe replaced the onions with cherry tomatoes on the kabobs used just a pinch of cardamom and only used a dash of salt. After grilling we stuffed everything into pita bread (Peppy's Pita Bread from this site) and drizzled in a little plain yogurt with lemon. We loved it thank you!:)

Really excellent recipe! I have modified it with more garlic and spices maybe a little more lemon or tomato from time to time but even when made exactly as written it is wonderful! Thanks for this recipe it is one of my staples when we do 'middle east' night now. Oh and one thing I want to add...use Greek yogurt! It is tangier and seems to tenderize the chicken a bit more than 'normal' yogurt. Try a little on top after cooking as well!

I really enjoyed this marinade. I made it as directed but my execution on the indoor grillpan failed and I blame that on my self. The meat never carmelized or browned and I am not sure if that is because of poor cooking on my part or that the marinade ingredients interfered with browning. I used Tzatziki Sauce I from this site with it and took the meat and veggies off the sticks and wrapped them in store bought naan with the sauce and butter lettuce leaves. I served cucumber slices on the side instead of chips or fries and they really worked. This was a garlicky meal so just remember that two garlics cancel each other out!

So easy to make and absolutely delicious! I used my All-Clad grill pan (my favorite piece of cookware) since it was still snowing outside. The best is the charred pieces of marinade in the pan. So tasty!

I really love shish tawook and have been making this recipe for the last few months. I like to use more fresh garlic and allspice than listed and I like to add some cayenne pepper to give it some zip. The yogurt marinade makes the chicken oh so tender! I broil this on skewers in the oven in cold weather and use the grill in warmer weather. I don't have cardamom and have never used it but it is great without it.

Sooo delicious. The marinade tenderizes the chicken keeping it juicy and flavorful after grilling. I did add a teaspoon of honey just because I like just a tiny hint of sweetness. The next time I make this dish I think I'll add a dash of cayenne pepper to give it a little kick. Definitely a keeper.

Just like our favorite Middle Eastern chicken kabob! I added a few dashes of paprika tumeric and cayenne pepper plus an extra clove of garlic just to kick it up. Part of our regular rotation now!

Loved ittttt. first time making shish tawook at home although id eat it almost on the regular on weekends back home. Though if anyone enjoys spicy food you might want to adapt it to your taste by adding some crushed chilli peppers to the marinade.

AWESOME!! Taste just like what I get at my favorite middle eastern restaurants!!! I had to cook everything inside but it turned out great! Skewered it and put it on a rimmed baking sheet and cooked it at 425 deg F for 10-12 on one side then flipped the skewers over and cooked another 10 minutes then blasted them under the broiler for 5-6 minutes on each side for that little bit of char!! I roasted the vegetables in the pan till they were done to my liking (I have no idea how long this took). Everything was delicious served with rice pilaf!!! I will be making this again and again!

This is the best chicken kabob recipe you'll ever find. It's perfect the way it is-- no need to alter a thing. My husband is a very picky Syrian who is used to the best Middle Eastern dishes (his mother is an old-fashioned arab kitchen whiz) and this is tops in his opinion. Serve it with Toum (the kind that's simply made by blending garlic cloves with drizzles of olive oil and dashes of salt-- there is one on this site if you don't have a Middle Eastern grocer who carries it fresh).

This chicken was really good! I only marinated for about two hours (that was all the time I had) skipped the tomato paste and allspice because I didn't have any. I sauteed the chicken in a pan and omitted the onion and green pepper because I wasn't making kebabs. This went well with hummus lentil soup pita bread and fattoush.

Very good and easy. Will do again for sure. I did coat some of the vegetables in the marinade before putting on the skewer and it made them taste even better. The vegetables I didn't coat in the marinade were tasty too....just personal preference.

This is amazing. I'm from the Middle East originally and after making this recipe I gotta say I was impressed. I used chicken thighs with skin on because they stay juicy & tender after grilling usually. Try this recipe and it will be a favorite. One last thing... Get cardamom it's worth buying some just for this recipe because you'll be making this one a lot!

This recipe is very good. I was short on time due to poor planning and only marinated for 2 hours but it still turned out moist and tender. I will probably tweak the recipe some. I doubled and I just have this feeling that all that lemon juice covered up some of the other spices. The lemon was very strong. Maybe I'll try fresh squeezed lemon juice next time. I will be cooking this again and again.

Got one of my picky eaters to actually order something besides chicken fingers or mac and cheese at a restaurant-- which happened to be Middle Eastern so she ordered the chick swish tawook and loved it. So we decided to make at home using this recipe.. well she is on seconds and said it needs to go in our regular rotation. It was very tender and good flavor. One of my picky eaters still refused it but if one likes it that means it is excellent. I have no problem eating it again though think we all agree to just leave the parsley off next time. Followed the directions exactly as written except we didn't grill onions or peppers with it just the chicken.

Really easy and really delicious! We LOVED it! We followed the recipe but didn't have allspice or cardamom so used a little ginger coriander and cumin instead of those. Also added a little cayenne will probably add even more next time! We also made a little bit additional marinade and set it aside to use as a sauce of the rice we ate with it. Highly recommend this recipe!

We really liked this. Although we generally like spicy food the mild flavors of this marinade were delicious. I don't know that I'd identify it as "shish tawook" with my eyes closed but it's definitely a make-again dish. We didn't have allspice but otherwise I followed the recipe pretty closely. Really good and easy.

This stuff is soo good! I haven't had a good grilled chicken breast in awhile. I made as is (so unusual of me) and it came out so moist and flavorful. I love the lemon taste. The only change I would make is to cube them smaller. My child doesn't like too much of the lemon taste so add more tomato paste. Thank you Noor!

I've never had or heard of this chicken but it was unbelievable! I've made it twice in the past week. The first time I made it I only marinated for 4 hours and used chicken cubes in a grill basket. The second time I made it I doubled the batch and cut up chicken strips and marinated for 24 hrs. SOOO delicious! The longer it sits the better it is. Even after it cooks the chicken does not dry out when reheated and the flavors are even more wonderful the next day. Neither time did I make kabobs with the onion and pepper. It's a definite keeper!

This will become a favorite! It's incredible how tender the yogurt does make the chicken and the flavors (I had all the right spices on hand) are subtle and nuanced. I cooked the vegetables on separate skewers to better control that each were done perfectly. Served this with a bulgur salad. Simple quick meal.

Really good flavored marinade. We marinated overnight and it was quite a strong flavoring on the chicken. If you wanted a more subtle flavor perhaps closer to the four hour minimum recommended by the recipe would be good. I didn't make any changes except no parsley and I used what I wanted to for kabob veggies (rainbow peppers purple onion and yellow onion). Really got great reviews from all the party-goers. This also qualifies as gluten free for my MIL who has celiac. Nice!

Really good! I cooked it on the stove top and added some chicken broth base for added flavor. It was yummy!

While this was tasty it tasted nothing like the shish tawook i get at my local middle eastern deli. full disclosure: i used chicken on the bone so i did not do kabobs. I'm wondering if chunking the chicken would have added more flavor? In any case made a nice meal served with grilled pita and a simple salad of tomatoes cukes onions topped with feta and basalmic.

Amazing... Living in the Detroit area we have lots of Middle eastern restaurants. This marinade has a authentic restaurant flavor and is a real winner. 5 stars all the way.

Love the marinade in this. The only changes I made were to use a middle eastern spice mix called "Zahtar" I used about 2 tsps. in place of the spices they stated. you can find this spice mix on Amazon. I also marinaded the onions and peppers also I used lemon juice olive oil and a little white wine vinegar. plus some Zahtar. This recipe is a keeper!!! I will be making this again and again!!! soooo good! My family loved it!!

This is the recipe I was looking for. However I tweaked it just a little. I use Fage Greek yogurt and I was tasting some of the sourness of it too much on the chicken so I doubled the oregano tomato paste garlic pepper cinnamon allspice added a half teaspoon of paprika and also added a teaspoon of red chili pepper flakes for a little heat. (I know it's not authentic) Seriously twice I've promised my roommates that Id same some kabobs for them but I just can't help myself. They're just too freakin good. Nice char on the outside and restaurant quality moistness on the inside. I grill them on the BBQ first with aluminum foil on top of the grate then after they're decently cooked I let them char up by putting them directly on the grill. Do it!

If I could give it more stars I would!!! Anyone coming from a middle Eastern family knows how frustrating it can get to ask for recipes. They would mostly answer add a little bit of this and that. No measurements NOTHING!! You try it and it tastes like nothing you want to taste ever again!!! I Literally stopped cooking Lebanese recipes! Thank you so much NOOR! I can t say thank you enough. This tastes just like home. It was amazing. We ate it with garlic mayo fries and hummus.... it wasn t Devine! Didn t change a thing!

I've never had much luck with yogurt-based marinades. The flavors never seem to soak into the chicken. Next time I'll try marinating it overnight. This was good. I felt it could've used a tad bit more salt and some heat of some kind. When we make this again I will probably: a) double all of the spices except salt b) Add an extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt and c) marinate it overnight.

Wow this was delicious! I was out of peppers so I used onions mushroom halves and tomato wedges and served them with a pile of fresh naan (I used this recipe and cooked it in cast iron on the stove top. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/naan/detail.aspx?event8=1&prop24=SR_Title&e11=naan&e8=Quick%20Search&event10=1&e7=Home%20Page). Instead of firing up the grill I cooked them under the broiler for about 5 minutes a side. The spice mix and seasoning were out of this world good and it all came together pretty easily. Will definitely make this again.

I made this to marinade last night. My husband Kelly and I are camping over the summer and my intent was to follow the recipe to the tee but what I like about this recipe is that it is very forgiving. I did not have allspice so I looked up what to do. Take cinnamon cloves and nutmeg. The recipe did not really say which garlic to use where so I put pre minced garlic in the marinade and the salt in the dip. At first it was a little salty then I added lemon juice. It was delicious. I also only used 1/2 a cup of mayonnaise with 2 tablespoons of Greek plain yogurt. Again all I had. I did not have peppers but did marinade the onions all night with the meat. I did not have cardamon so again I ad-libbed and looked it up in google. We used two tablespoons of ketchup because that is all we had. It was soooooo good. Both of us give it a 5. I will try next time to make it as states. Thank you so much!

I didn't have the cardamom didn't add tomato paste or black pepper. I added just a pinch of cayenne pepper and tumeric. I used my NuWave to cook it. Yum! Although next time I'm using Greek yogurt and also adding some dill.

Amazing dish. Packed full of flavor. Everyone raved about it. Will definitely be making this again! Followed the recipe exactly. Didn't change a thing. Marinated for 24 hours. Then plans changed so I put the chicken in the marinade in the freezer. Removed it 48 hours prior to cooking. Was just fantastic!

Our local Afghan restaurant has this and I always wondered exactly how it was made. Thanks for this recipe! And thanks to reviewers I could tailor the spices to taste. After seeing the most helpful reviews I skipped oregano added heaping recipe measurements of the other spices except the black pepper. Instead of oregano I added 1/2 tsp dried mint pinch of turmeric and shake of cayenne pepper. Marinaded 5 hours then grilled as directed with red/green peppers and onion. Served with seasoned saffron rice and fresh naan. This will be a regular from now on.

This was a wonderful recipe! I followed the recipe exactly as written and the flavor was wonderful. The chicken was moist and the flavor balance was great nothing was overpowering. I served it wish tzatziki sauce grilled veggies and grilled naan. We grilled the chicken but instead of putting it directly on the grill we left it on aluminum foil..it worked great and the chicken still had some char on it plus easy clean up. Also it was even better the next day!

This is a rock star recipe!  I wish Incould rate it higher than 5!  I follow the recipe exactly- no swaps, no modifications; it doesn’t need any. (My bf does prefer it with a little less oil in the marinade.) I’ve made this SO many times that I have memorized the recipe. It is flavourful and delicious. We eat the Shish Tawook in tortillas with marinated turnips (the purple ones) and fresh tomatoes along with some homemade garlic yogurt sauce. Thank you so much for sharing your amazing recipe. 

FYI: I’ve also made this recipe and put it in the freezer in sealed bags for cooking at a later date. It works well and tastes great even after being frozen.

Do not listen to the person below that tells you to substitute cardamom for nutmeg and cinnamon. That s a huge NO NO AND A NO! Cardamom is the main spice and it is NOT expensive and can be found in pretty much any spice isle at your grocery store if you don t use this spice You might as well not even bother making this I actually Omit the cinnamon in this recipe to get the traditional real deal Lebanese shish tawook. Been eating it since I was a kid. Trust me I m Lebanese

Soooooo good!!!! My son wanted this for his 8th birthday dinner! Not pizza or chicken nuggets - Shish Tawook! Haha! It's a bit messy when grilling it - especially if you use a George Foreman grill. I'm trying it tonight on the outdoor grill - I hope it's not as messy!

I did add some more heat...cayenne siracha... whatever you have and also a little more salt and turmeric. It just needed more per some reviews. I used sour cream because I was out of plain yogurt. It was very tender even though I only marinated for one and half hours. Great basic recipe which is what I was looking for. This is a very popular dish in the Middle East. Different recipes had slightly different ingredients. Will definitely make again. My husband asked if I had kept this recipe because he would like it again. I did not thread on any veggies but I know it would only add flavor. Thanks for this recipe

We made this. Being remote Wyoming we could not get yogurt so we made it with sour cream. It worked! It was outstanding. The toum I made wasn't so good but that is another story. The chicken came perfectly!

We have made this four times and love it. Last time we made it we grilled the chicken and vegetables on different skewers which worked well but two skewers on one plate is a little too much food. We served it with Tzatseki (forgive my spelling) - yoghurt cucumber dill and lemon juice - which can also be found on allrecipes.

Perfect. My husband has Middle Eastern roots so we're always looking for things to cook that pay homage to his family's roots. The garlicky yogurt based marinade is delicious. Cardamom was hard to find and when I did finally track it down it was fairly pricey. I have made the recipe with and without it and I couldn't taste a difference at all so skip it if you don't have it on hand. My kids declared this recipe their favorite of the summer so far so it's going in our rotation for sure!

I really loved it! I ended the skewers with a baby Bella mushroom and sauteed the leftover marinade veggies and little chicken pieces. I baked it at 500 for 20 minutes then broiled the first side for 5 minutes and the other side for 2 minutes. Served it with boxed rice pilaf and green beans so at least some of the dinner would have a familiar flavor. Chicken haters said it was OK everybody loved the marinade!"

This is one of my all-time favorite things to eat. I'm not a huge cook but when I do want to cook or have friends over and cook for them this is my go-to. I'm a big fan of Lebanese food as well as going out to dinner. This recipe is as good as anything you would get at a Lebanese restaurant. When I make this I serve it with pita bread hummus and Lebanese rice (a recipe from AllRecipes). Would also pair wonderfully with Fatoosh salad.

This is insanely good. One of my favorite chicken recipes and a winner with my picky kids. I leave out oregano because I loathe that spice and I use a dash of nutmeg instead of cardamom. I serve with rice pilaf (also from allrecipes). Amazing.

The meat should marinate in the yogurt mix as long as you can afford (overnight is even better than the 4 hours suggested. Also grilling these are FAR better than cooking them stovetop. If you can't grill it at least use a grill pan in the oven. It makes a difference.

Fantastic!! Very authentic. The only change I made was I left out cardamon and just used an eighth teaspoon cinnamon nutmeg and pinch of cayenne. Also used red onion and red pepper. I left chicken marinating overnight just due to time constraints. After grilling I served the whole content of each skewer on a rolled warmed pita with tzatiki and crumbled feta. I will definitely be making these again!

Huge success. I had a couple of leftover kebabs which were great the next day. Love the ease of this dinner as I'm always looking for something that can be made ahead of time. With veggies this is a well-balanced and healthy meal. I served it with the Lebanese Garlic Sauce which was a nice accompaniment.

This was awesome. I followed the recipe exactly since I like to try it using the original recipe first before tweaking it. I wouldn't change a thing. The spices were just right - don't skip the cardamom! It was super moist. I served it with Tabbouleh III from allrecipes.com as someone else suggested Greek yogurt dill dipping sauce hummus from the store and pitas from the store. It made a wonderful dinner and it was so easy to make.

A real hit with my family. I used and indoor grill pan and did not cube the chicken. I did cut the breasts in half as they were big. We don't like peppers so I left those out. When I make it again I'll make another batch of the marinade to use as a sauce for the meat and rice.I served with it.

I was a little scared with the combination of ingredients for the marinade but this turned out great and I followed the recipe exactly (although I forgot about the parsley at the end which I specifically bought for this!) Most authentic one I have tried. I used bottled lemon juice verses fresh b/c that is what I had and the individual serving size of plain greek yogurt which was just under the 3/4 cup. We prefer red pepper over green so I used that.

This was EXCELLENT! Marinated overnight and grilled whole boneless chicken breasts. I increased the oregano from 1 to 1.5 teaspoons decreased the cinnamon to 1/8 teaspoon omitted the allspice and replaced it by 1 teaspoon paprika. The chicken was tender and moist. This was a hit with the whole family and will definetly make it again.

My 2yo approves it and that good enough for me. Thank you for the recipe. Does anyone know if I can freeze the left over? It s quite plenty for 2.5 people??

I was introduced to this recipe several years ago and since then I make it monthly. I have several picky eaters in my family but this is everyone's "favorite chicken." I make this for guests of all ages all the time and every single person (young children included) love it. Sometimes I put it in a pita with a side of couscous and other times I just have the shish kabobs without the pita sandwich. Either way this will become a family favorite guaranteed.

Made this recipe many times and recommend the following small changes: 1) Do not add the allspice or cinnamon 2) simply add a small container of plain yogurt - no need to measure it. That's it! My guests have always enjoyed this recipe. Enjoy!

This was a fantastic recipe. I used olive oil instead I added more garlic oregano and salt and 2 tsp of mild pepper paste. It was very tender and delicious! It was a hit at my dinner party.

Just finished scarfing this down and I must say what everybody has been saying here is true. This was fabulous and tasted just like the chicken I've had at many Lebanese restaurants. I followed the recipe to a T and did not change anything. I marinated skinless boneless chicken breasts for 9 hours and didn't cut them up. I cooked the chicken in the NuWave Oven-4" grill 8 minutes one side 13 minutes other side and 5 minutes on first side again. In the NuWave at the same time I roasted chunks of rutabega after dunking them in the marinade for a total of 30-35 minutes. This vegetable is tough and needs about 30 minutes at least. Ate it with pita and garlic sauce I made in the Magic Bullet: 5 garlic cloves 1/4 cup Lemon juice 6-8 ounces of grapeseed or canola oil say a half tsp salt or to taste 2 egg whites. Good thing about the Magic Bullet is that you really can just dump it all in and it emulsifies. After mixing for 30 secs to a minute total I just poured it all out and then put back half and wizzed it until suddenly it takes on a mayonnaise like consistency. Then I did the other half. Perfect. This was an extremely tasty and easy meal. This is a real keeper.

This marinade is awesome! I've marinated beef in this too. The longer you marinate the meat the more flavorful it is!

I followed the recipe as listed except I didn't have cardamom. It still turned out terrific. It's a delicious marinade and combination of flavors. My boyfriend also enjoyed it. I'll make this again.

My family loved this chicken especially my husband. We are not familiar with Arabic food but wanted to try something different. I enjoyed the flavors and it was quite tender. I made this as directed except for the cardamom (when I went to purchase some I saw it is expensive.) With such a small amount called for I didn't think it would be a huge issue. I plan on trying this at a local Middle Eastern restaurant to compare to the "real thing."

Made exactly as written only added an 8-oz. box of whole mushrooms to the vegetables. Turned out fantastic! I have a hunch this recipe will be made many times this summer.

Meat came out very tender and moist and DELICIOUS. Good flavor from the spice but not overwhelming at all. Will definitely make again. Served it with tahini sauce and pita wrap bread.

This was a great recipe! I added little curry powder but otherwise stuck with the recipe and it turned out amazing. Because it's snowing outside i put mine on a cooling rack in the oven on broil instead of grilling outside. I accompanied it with garlic naan from this website and it was most definitely restaurant quality! I will be making this regularly! Thanks for sharing!
