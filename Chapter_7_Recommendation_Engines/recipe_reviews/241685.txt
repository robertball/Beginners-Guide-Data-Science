ADORABLE!  The next time I make this cake it will be so easy because I won't have to figure out what I want to do.  I used a 2 quart pyrex measuring cup to bake the cake.  For ears, I purchased a bunny headband.  The bunny headband was white so I saw no need to make a pink bunny.   When the marshmallow is cut, it is 2 half circles.  I couldn't find fruit roll-ups so I stretched a strawberry "Laffy Taffy" and cut the shapes I needed for the foot pads.  I used Easter grass around the bunny.  (NOT the cellophane type as it would have too much static). This was a fun recipe to make.  Thanks barb1031c for sharing such an ADORABLE recipe!

We used whipped frosting instead of the ready-to-use type.  Also, we only needed about a little more than half of the coconut flakes that was called for.  Couldn't see how more could have been added.  We brought the cake to an Easter party and it put a smile on the face of everyone who saw it.

My son and I made this for easter. It turned out really good. Easy to assemble and decorate.  We flavored with double strength vanilla and made a fluffy vanilla cream cheese frosting! Its my sons favorite flavor!  I recommended this recipe!  :-)
