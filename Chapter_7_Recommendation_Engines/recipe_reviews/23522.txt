These are a fun snack.  We like ours with Lawry's Seasoning salt and I prefer cooking mine on the stove.  That way you can monitor the seeds better and add more seasoning as necessary.  These are always better after they have cooled awhile and become crispy - put them in a tupperware container to store.

This recipe worked well.  Although, the ingredients list 2 tbps of water and the recipe does not mention water.  Is there a step missing?

This is perfect for parties. You can use spices to sprinkle over top as well. Such as Garlic powder, Cajun seasoning, Taco seasoning .etc.

I make these for my son. I do add garlic powder and occasionally seasoned salt. I drizzle with a little olive oil when toasting.

These were pretty good. They taste like how you would buy them from the store. This is  your basic pumpkin seeds. They were good though.

My six year old was able to help which was good.  They took a lot longer to bake than was instructed in the recipe and even then seeds seemed too chewy, we added popcorn seasoning (dill) which gave them a bit more flavor.

Turned out tasting like burnt popcorn kernels. This is my first attempt at toasting pumpkin seeds and will most likely be my last.

We had terrible pumpkin seeds this year, so it may not have been the recipe.  I combined the butter w/the water and tossed the seeds then toasted per directions.  So-so overall.  Like I said, we had terrible seeds - more hull than seed.

Easy and quick to make. DH thought it was quite tasty! Next time I might subsitute Garlic salt for regular salt to give it some zip! Thanks so much Kate!

Just barely edible.  Too salty.  Over-toasted.  We prefer slow-roasted seeds.

I confess that I tossed the seeds in the melted butter and water, then spread in the pan that was lined with release foil. I didn't quite have 3 cups of seeds. I just shook the salt over top since the recipe didn't call for a specific amount. These smelled great while baking but were so-so in taste. They were very chewy and not crispy as others I have tasted. I was afraid that I would hurt the crown on my tooth. Thanks anyway.
