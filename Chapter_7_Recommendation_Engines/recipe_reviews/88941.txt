My family loved these! I had some won ton wrappers that needed to be used and this was perfect. We had these for dinner so I made them ravioli-style for bigger portion sizes. They had a delicious creamy filling and the veggies inside were a great compliment. I will make these again!

These were excellent and fairly simple. The store was out of won ton wrappers so I picked up egg roll wrappers instead. You can cut them down to size or make a larger version...both were still very good. These are a little spicy (I like spice) so you may want to cut down a little if you like things mild.

Time consuming but good. Fun to make just the same. I baked them but they probably would have been better fried but I was trying to save calories (and more time.)

We have made these twice and both times they have been great. We added a frozen southwest vegetable mix instead of individual items that already had the seasonings and black beans and it was great. This is a great recipe to let the kids do and they think the won tons are so fun to make!

Yum!! These were delicious and all of my kids even thought so (ages 2 6 9 12). I boiled the chicken to cook it quickly and for the veges I used a pack of frozen corn/peppers/onions. They were so easy just a little time consuming. I froze the extras without baking them to use for another day since this recipe made so much.

Found these goodies en route to looking for something else. I was looking for a recipe fo traditional Oriental Won Tons and ran across this recipe. I just happened have left over BBQ pork in the fridge so ended up making these. I used my leftover BBQ pork instead of the chicken. My one change was I used half the hot pepper. 1 tsp looked like quite a bit plus the BBQ sauce I have is pretty spicy.

Made this for Recipe Group...We loved these! Great flavor combo and nice texture. I baked mine which were great but I bet they'd be even better fried! A dipping sauce would be nice for these. I will def be making these again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)
