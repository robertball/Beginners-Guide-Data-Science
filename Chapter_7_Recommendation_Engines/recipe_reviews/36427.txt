If you like institutional buffet food, this is the prime rib recipe for you. I think prime rib is a far too expensive and special a cut of meat to treat this way. This isn't roasting, it's steaming! For a nice medium rare roast, season with salt and garlic, heat oven to 350Â°F. Place roast, fat side up, in shallow roasting pan. Insert ovenproof meat thermometer so tip is centered in thickest part of beef, not resting in fat or touching bone. **Do not add water or cover.** Roast 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 hours for medium rare; 2-3/4 to 3 hours for medium doneness. Thermometer should read 115 degrees for rare when you remove the roast from the oven (temperature will increase about 10 degrees while it stands before carving).

I am a chef also and this is a great recipe for prime rib. I would agree with someone elses review about not covering the meat. Two more good tricks is to cover the meat in the salt and
a steak seasoning blend then let set over night to soak in the meat. Then after it is baked and sets about 10-15 min. the salt on top has formed a crust, then you simply remove the salt crust and it will not be as salty. All that flavor goes into the meat.

Please don't spoil a great cut of beef by cooking it like this.  It will be either braised or steamed, depending on the amount of liquid you use.  Prime rib should always be dry roasted.  This may be good, but not nearly as good as dry roasted on a rack, baked slowly.  The rub sounds fine, though.

Read the other reviewer comments below before starting this recipe! Mine is just my story....
OK, I admit, I was dumb, and I did not read the reviews before I started this recipe.  Halfway through the cooking process, I took a peek at the roast and was horrified (in a chef/cook sort of way).  The meat was grey looking and I couldn't see how it was going to look any prettier in an hour...this was my Christmas meal, and I do like to "present" the meal at the table.  
So, I panicked and decided to read the other comments to this recipe - I do wish I had done so prior to placing the meat in the oven... silly me.  
I ended up dumping the water, uncovering the roast, scraping off some of the salt and it came out OK.  Some of my guests felt it was a bit salty (especially if you like to eat the crunchy outside of the meat), but I think it was OK -- which is not a good thing with such an expensive cut of meat.
If you are consious of the amount of money you spend on a good cut of meat, I would stick with the "tired and true" recipe which one of the other folks who commented recaped for us.

I wanted to make my man his favorite meat for his birthday and it turned out HORRIBLE. Whoever said all that kosher salt won't make the meat too salty was lying through their teeth. It smelled good but when it came down to it nobody ate more than a couple of bites, not even the dog. I wasted a lot of money on that expensive cut of meat.

Please do not trim the fat from your rib because you will lose a lot of juice and flavor.  The idea of the fat is it 'melts' to continuely baste the meat thoughout the cooking time.  This recipe also contains way too much salt.  Do not add water to the pan and do not cover the meat at all during the cooking time!

This was excellent! It was my first attempt at making prime rib so I chose a 3 pound roast and cut the seasonings in half. After reviewing many recipes, I decided to roast the meat  uncovered at 500 degrees for 15 minutes followed by 325 degrees until done (about 1 1/2 hours total).  I like my meat medium rare so I removed it when it measured 125 degrees in the center(the temperature will continue to rise). I let it rest for 20 minutes and scraped off the excess salt before carving. For the au jus I used a packet mix which was great, however, diluting the scraped seasonings with water would have made a nice au jus too.

Awesome!!! I've tried some of the other recipes & this is the only one that tasted the way prime rib is suppose to taste. I followed the recipe exactly the way it was written. My family does not go out for prime rib anymore. They just ask me to cook it.

This is an excellent recipe! I only loosely covered the roast with foil. This was great for a main meal and then later as a sandwich. So so good. I also have used this recipe and method on lesser cuts of meat and they turned out beautifully as well. Thank you.

bringing the meat to 145 is amlost Medium Well and letting it sit in the oven at 200 degrees is going to make for some very grey, dry beef. The rost will raise a good 10 degrees after you pull it from the oven so pull it at 110 for rare, 120 for medium rare, 130 for medium- anything after that- well, god help you(remember, you will still get a few medium well- well slice on the end of the roast). As for those people who said they thought it was too salty, are you sure you used kosher salt? While a cup of salt is probably too much for a 5 lb roast, kosher salt won't make it super salty tasting.

I think that many of the low raters aren't used to cooking a salt encrusted prime rib. This recipe works well, but you might read a few other salt encrusted recipes to get a better feel of what you are going to do.  If done right, the salt crust crumbles off easily and leaves a lovely seasoned prime rib. I happened to double the amount of pepper, added 2 teaspoons of ginger powder and a teaspoon of onion powder to the recipe. It was fabulously moist throughout, rare in the center and medium towards the edges.

This recipe has turned out excellently for me every time. I use Keg spice as the blend and just follow the cooking directions. I love it for family occasions when I don't want to spend the whole day in the kitchen.

We love this recipe.  I do not use any liquid.  Simply dry roast on a rack inside the roaster.  I rub the salt crust on the roast using a large sheet of wax paper underneath to catch extra and to make easy cleanup. Also, I like to let the salt covering set up for at least an hour before cooking.  

We really enjoy this recipe.

My girlfriend Sandy had given me this recipe years ago.  It if fantastic!  The Kosher salt does not make the roast too salty.  I use about 4 cloves of garlic that I smoosh into a paste instead of the garlic powder.  And I cook mine to med. rare.  Great recipe!

i used a variation on this recipe.  Used the salt but also added an applewood rub. Raised heat to 500 degrees and then lowered to the 325.  DID NOT cover this roast.  We cooked a 14 lb ribless for 2. 25 hrs then removed and covered.  We served it for a New Years party and were told it was the best prime rib our guests had had in their lives!!!  Way to end a first try!

I made this for Thanksgiving and Christmas! I didn't have the kosher salt so I used some garlic pepper/salt along with the coursely ground pepper and minced garlic. I thought the first time it might have been a fluke because it came out  DELICIOUS! So I made it for Christmas, too. Absolutely wonderful! Will definitely make it again and was SO EASY! Thank you!

This lives up to the PRIME part of prime rib.  We don't have prime rib when we go to the restaurants cause it's too expensive & this just hits the spot like nothing we'd get at any restaurant for a fraction of the price.

I cook this specialty a few times a year and have tried a few different recipes. In personal opinion this one stands out from other recipes I have tried. I of course leave the fat on, if there are people who do not like the fat, they can cut it off after it cooks, but it does add to the flavor. This produces a very moist meat, I also take it out at 110-115. I must say bravo.

This was my first ever prime rib and it turned out just OK. I think the recipe was fine - it was probably just not a great piece of meat. I would have liked a little more detail in the recipe - because it was my first time - I had issues like, does it go on the roasting pan rack? Or in the water? I know it's a stupid question, but when you're cooking a $50 piece of meat for the first time - you get easily confused. We decided that prime rib isn't worth cooking at home.

I followed the directions in that I used the kosher salt, pepper, garlic mixture. Coated my roast really well. I used a 5 pound roast. And then I took it outside andput it on my smoker with a good dose of hickory. 3.5 hours later, perfection. I have a meat thermometer. I set it at medium rare and left the thing alone. Never let my temp get over 250. Tried to keep it around 225 for the most part. This was fantastic. My family tore it up. Thanks for the idea! (this was similar to another recipe i used from here that called for a smoker to cook with, that was where i got the idea to smoke it).

We made this for New Years and even though I cut back on the salt..it was way too salty.  I get nervous using kosher salt so I was cautious to use 1 cup with a 5 lb roast. Also the cover may have been too much..it got way over done!

Used a 3.5 pound roast and eyeballed the measurements. I did cook it more like the last reviewer, starting at a higher temperature and then reducing the temp for the remaining time. Didn't bother with the water bath after reading one review. Also, I just used seasoning salt instead of Kosher and added a bit of thyme. The results were terrific.

I have been doing Prime Rib like this for 25 years and it is the very best way I have found.  My guests rave!  It is important to know the Kosher salt does Not make the meat too salty.

I cooked an eight bone rib roast which just barely fit into my oven.  The oven mfg. said to lower my shelf to the last rung or just above the gas rows. It was the best med. well roast I ever cooked. And for those who liked it med. rare they got cuts from the middle. All were very happy that Christmas. : = )

This is a great recipe. The meat turn out to be very tender. However, it just taste a bit plain for me.

perfect example of how NOT to cook prime rib...this recipe will turn out overcooked, tough, and salty. The fat should always be left on, it adds flavor and tenderness...145 deg internal temperature is WAY too high for prime, putting it solidly into the well done range.... 120 is more ideal...and covering will steam it rather than roast it....don't waste an expensive cut of prime on this recipe!

The meat was very tender. That could be because it was a great piece of meat. WAY TOO SALTY! I would look around for other ideas.
