This was a fantastic use for leftover turkey and a starting recipe base for me.......  I started down that road because the instructions said to add the rice at two different points.  I figured the second time was the right one.  I also noticed there was no salt listed (the bouillon I used didn't add a salt taste at all for me)….so I went off on a tangent….The spice mix was very nice for this soup – but I added salt, Cajun seasoning, and red pepper.   I added about 12 cups of water (I felt 8 was not enough for all the spices added!)…used dried celery leaf instead of the celery…used a tiny bit of red curry paste instead of the curry powder….. I used the two legs and two wings from our turkey.  I diced my onions – didn’t want them in big pieces – since everything else was in small pieces!  I brought to a boil and simmered for 30 minutes.  Then I took out the turkey and removed the meat and returned the meat to the pot.  I then added 1 quart of buttermilk (instead of the half and half), one cup of our leftover mashed potatoes, and one small can mushroom pieces (drained)……..and brought to a simmer and maintained on low for 30 minutes.  I then added 1 cup Minute Rice and ½ cup “Egg Bow” pasta and simmered for 20 minutes.  Came out wonderful!   Oh – also – even though it’s common sense – the recipe should mention to remove the bay leaves before serving!  I do love the combination of the spices – so don’t shy from this recipe – just needed a few tweaks for me!!!!

I left out the half-and-half, and it was still an excellent flavor. Mmmm

Now one of my favorite homemade soups. It was easy to make and delicious. Instead of using boullion cubes I replaced the water with a combination of turkey and vegetable broth. I made this recipe originally post Thanksgiving and had a number of items on hand. Also I used one cup heavy whipping cream to avoid going to market instead of half and half- this made for a heavier hearty soup more like stew but delicious! Great recipe heavier or lighter.

I did not have smoked turkey legs but I did have some frozen turkey leftover from Thanksgiving that I used in this recipe. Instead of water and bouillion cubes, I used eight cups of chicken broth. I also added in one chopped red pepper and a sprinkling of red pepper flake. I don't often keep cream on hand, I used one full can of evaporated milk. Everyone enjoyed this soup, even my littlest. My husband said this is one of the best I've made so far.

Good soup...I didn't use smoked turkey, which probably would have been very good.  But my purpose for making turkey soup was - you guessed it - using up the frozen turkey bones/meat leftover from the holidays.

This recipe is really easy to follow, with alot of ingredients that are on hand.  I used the carcass of my smoked turkey from Thanksgiving- flavor was really good!  The only thing is that I was hoping with the amount of half and half, that the soup would be a bit creamier/thicker, maybe more like a chowder. I used a flour/water thickener, which was okay, but found that after cooling in the fridge, the soup turned too thick, into a gel.  Upon heating on the stove, the soup thinned out back to where it was.  I will be posting a photo soon as well.  If you want a thick soup, this is not it, but it's a thin creamy/brothy soup with alot of flavor!

What a wonderful soup!  So rich and satifying.  I prepared this with leftover slow-cooked turkey breast, just cubed and added a few drops of liquid smoke for a delicious smokey taste.  I doubled the curry, wow, the curry really makes this soup.  Also used a cup or so of heavy cream instead of the published amount of 1/2 & 1/2, as that's what I had on hand.  Highly recommended & a definite do-over.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.

I had two smoked turkey drumsticks in the freezer I was looking to use up and found this.  I stuck to the recipe except for leaving out the cloves and using Penzy's soup base instead of boullion cubes.  The curry powder is a great addition, must remember to use that more with poultry.  Also, I wasn't fond of the texture of the turkey meat, and the smokiness was a bit too strong for me.  That may be the fault of the brand, not the recipe.  All in all a good soup.

Was going to use BTB turkey base but only had a little left so used some chicken base too. Went heaping on curry, will go scant next time. White rice because it was already in the fridge and just a half cup of half and half. Used white meat from this recipe...http://allrecipes.com/personalrecipe/62472514/smoked-turkey-without-smoker/detail.aspx?prop31=3

I skipped the half-and-half after taste testing the soup.  It was a little salty for my taste due to the smoked turkey which probably would have been remedied if I had added the half-and-half.  Otherwise it was very good and easy.

this soup was delicious! I only used half the quart of half-and-half and it was plenty creamy. Also, I added leftover chopped turkey to the soup when I added the rice. Will definitely make again!

Great soup!   I roasted the Turkey legs and left out the half and half to make it healthier. Used homemade turkey broth.  Used half the curry called for because my husband isn't a curry fan. Took others advice and added some red pepper flakes.  Husband said this may be the best soup I have made.   Next time I think we will go with the full curry.   I doubled the recipie as we like to freeze portions for quick meal after work. Was great re-heated.

I used my own turkey broth after grilling (and using apple wood chips) a turkey breast.  The flavor from the chips was lovely, and no chemicals.  I sauteed the veggies, including sliced baby portabella mushrooms, to add that texture to the soup, and simmered 1/2 hour less.  Loved the combination of spices!

I used smoked chicken in place of smoked turkey, left out the optional curry powder, and only used half of the half f due to personal preference. Perfect! I can't help but think if you had leftover smoked meat you could skip step one altogether. Shoot, use  Uncle Ben's wile rice mix with its special seasoning pouch and you could probably eliminate quite a few steps altogether. Just a thought......

I made this exactly as the recipe...except used 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, no curry and put it in the crock pot for 8 hours on low then added the half and half the last hour.  This came out so delicious!  It's a keeper....and now I know what to do with our leftover smoked turkey legs.

Great recipe.  Everyone loved it- even my kids.  I added another bouillon cube and used only 1/2 the cream for our personal taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe today.  For a little extra flavor also added 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, and  couple teaspoons  of
of minced garlic, as well as extra panco for that crunch.  This turned out great.  I'll made this again.

This was delicious!! The only thing I did different was use one pint of cream instead.  I did taste it before adding the cream and whoa it's salty!! The cream definitely cuts the salt!!   I also used egg noodles instead of rice and added white rice on the side (love my starch!!) 

Next time I will add the veggies a tad bit later, after all the simmering, the veggies were mush.  I think I'll also throw out some of the broth after boiling and then add fresh water to omit some of the salt in the broth because I was parched after eating it!! 

It makes a big pot but worth the leftovers!!  This will be great after thanksgiving!!

This was a big hit tonight with our leftovers from Thanksgiving. My picky son had seconds and both kids asked me to make it again. It was pretty salty before I added the half and half but that toned it down and it was really good!

I made this recipe last night but used 1% (because I had no half & half), and basmati rice. Let me tell you... it was absolutely YUMMY and not even ONE of my three kiddies complained or tried to pick anything out. They loved it and kept complimenting me about how delicious it was. Hubby smoked some turkey legs on the weekend and I needed a recipe to use up the meat. This was perfect! I will be making this again! It was thick and creamy and the flavors were bang on. Thanks for the recipe!

I added Canellini beans to extend the soup for a large group and used a little less half-and - half.  It was creamy and savory and very popular.  Everyone wanted seconds and the recipe!

HOLY SMOKES! This soup is rich, smoky, creamy, and so satisfying. Never have I ever had anything like it! I followed the recipe, but instead of using one cup of dry wild rice, I used two of those 8.5-ounce pre-cooked wild rice and quinoa medley packets. I simply added them in in the last fifteen minutes of cooking, shortly after the half and half. I have to admit, this soup is VERY smoky and very salty - however, that is the very nature of a smoked turkey leg. I recommend cutting down on the chicken bouillon to one or two cubes instead of four. Regardless, this one is a keeper.

This is the second time I've made this soup.  I smoke a 20lb turkey every year and the smoke flavor does make it a little difficult to make the leftover recipes I use to make with a roasted turkey because the flavors are so different.  I absolutely LOVE this soup and so does my family. The flavors together are top notch, it's easy, and so comforting. I have added this to my winter and summer soup list as its very versatile.

I made this  soup for a sick neighbor and I did not change a thing except I let it simmer longer.  It is the best soup I have ever made!  My husband and neighbor also loved it.  It is  a keeper.

I used a box of organic chicken broth and a box of organic vegetable broth instead of bouillon.  I had smoked turkey left over from thanksgiving that I thawed and chopped.  Turned out very good.  The pepper was a bit much, I'd suggest adding pepper to your liking.  I also did not add half and half to keep it lower calorie.

No one in my family liked this soup. I new the amount of pepper asked for would be too much for my sensitive children so I only put half the amount of pepper in. It was still too peppery for me and my kids wouldn't eat it. My husband likes spicy peppery food and he didn't like it either. I will not be making this again.

Very hearty, flavorful soup. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of omitting the celery and curry powder since I didn't have any on hand, and I don't think any changes are needed. Good use of leftover turkey, will definitely make this again!

Awesome soup! I doubled the curry because we love the flavor it brings to poultry. I used the smoked carcass to make the broth, then added chunks of breast meat to give it more substance. I personally thought the recipe was perfect just the way it is, but my wife would have liked it better if I left out the cream. I thought it was great both ways!
