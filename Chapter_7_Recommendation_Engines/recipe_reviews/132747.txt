Reminds me of home! My nanny was from Bocas del Toro and she use to make it adding:  4 egg yokes 8 oz of butter instead of vegetable shortening 10 oz of sugar For added flavor I also sprinkle some coconut on top. Huge favorite in my household!

bad reciepe for bread, no liquid or egg, only one binder which is a small amount. I added 1 whipped egg whites, 1 egg yolk and a tsp of milk and it came out better - still was too chewy though due to too much molasses.

Are there supposed to be eggs in this recipe???  Mine came out flat as a pancake and dense as a brick and slightly scorched 34 minutes in the oven.  Is the temperature correct???  Very disappointed.  Having guests tomorrow and meal is Panamanian themes after a trip to Bouquete with a group.  Bummer.

I wanted to like this. I read the reviews before making it, and added apple sauce to moisten it and give it a little more lift. It has a good taste, but still needs a little "something", and it is too dense.
