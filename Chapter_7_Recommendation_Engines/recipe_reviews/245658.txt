Delicious! If you make this the day of, it's pretty thick, which makes it perfect for dipping wings and such in to (which was what we did with it). If made the day before, the next day it's A LOT thinner, which is good for salad dressing. The flavors are great and we really loved the addition of the roasted garlic. My only change was to halve the recipe. I will be making this again, for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

A great base for variations. Made only a 1/4 recipe, but it was great. Next time I has only feta cheese, which worked fine. Also, didn’t have time to roast, so just used fresh garlic in the food processor.

Excellent with baked wings, celery sticks and baby carrots.  I added extra blue cheese and a little extra lemon juice. I also added extra sour cream so that the mayonnaise didn’t dominate. I sprinkled dried parsley and lightly dusted with paprika to bolster the presentation.

This is a great recipe.  However, I recommend using what you make because after 3 days it becomes runny.  It's still very good but, runny.
