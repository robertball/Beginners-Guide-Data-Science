I made them once but they were not good. SO  I redid it, minus the cloves and ginger and added about a cup of sugar to the mix. SOOOOOO YUMMY!! made it pretty sweet and to die for!

We tried this out last year and were also pretty disappointed with the look of them, so my husband the cook doctored them up and came up with these comments: 

"OK, here's what you do.  You can use a can and a half of mixed nuts (about 1 lb) if you're feeling poor. Dust most of the salt off by rolling them on a terry towel. Use 2/3 c brown sugar, 1/2 tsp. cloves, egg white of a small egg, 4-5 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. ginger, 2 tsp vanilla. Otherwise, follow recipe.  Bake 24 mins. Cool and dust with confectioner's sugar." 

We did them that way and they were very good -- the confectioner's sugar gave them a different look and they worked very well for a holiday snack.  The salt in the nuts helped to cut the sweetness.

Super easy to make. Used pecans and almonds. Recommend pecans b/c I thought the almonds were a bit tough to chew. Not a sweet recipe, the cloves and brown sugar give it more of a pungent, aromatic taste.

This recipe was the hit of our christmas party last night! All of our guests loved them and aske dme for the recipe. They couldn't believe how good they tasted. My one suggestion: they are so easy to make, make them on the day of the party, not the night before because they taste the absolute best an hour or so after they're out of the oven. The only problem is trying not to eat them all at once!

Great recipe, I dindn't change a thing, although, after making first batch I cut the roasting time down to 23 min, they just seemed a little too "done".  Great though, a huge hit this Christmas!

We made these (with pecans) for a cocktail party and have since made several more pounds to give out to our friends who enjoyed them so much!  Great and easy to make.  I highly recommend pecans - they seem to work best with the other flavors.

This was not at all what I was expecting.  They looked like I drenched them in cocoa powder and cinnamon.  I was hoping for a shiny, honey colored glaze.  They tasted kind of ok but got soggy within an hour.

I tried this recipe tonight and was very pleased.
I used walnuts and plan to try pecans next. Everyone loves them. I also sprinkled a little more sugar before placing them in the oven. Thanks for a great recipe.

I thought these were okay, but nobody at the party would touch them.  People keep asking me, what's on those nuts?  Even after I told them, they wouldn't try them.

This is such a good recipe.  The nuts taste just like they came out of the mall during the holiday.  I have already made my second batch.  I used almonds.  So it was just like the cinnamond roasted ones.

I had left over walnuts, almonds and pecans.  I substituted garahm masala for the cinnamon, cloves and ginger.  It was so good that I went to Costo and bought 3 more bags of nuts (so about 8 lbs)  to make them for Christmas gifts. YUMMY!!

We loved them! I served them for a "New Year's Eve Open House Party and received many  compliments. After reading other comments, I increased the brown sugar to 2/3 cup plus 1/3 cup of white sugar. I also reduces the cloves to 1/2 tsp. My husband is right now munching on some while he watches the bowl games.

Couldn't be an easier recipe.  I thought the cloves would be overpowering, but the spice mixture is right on.  I added some cayenne for a little kick.  Would make again.

I tripled the recipe and used 1.5 lb walnuts and 1.5 lb Pecans. I love Pecans but even in bulk the 1.5 lbs cost me like $7 ouch. Kept everything the same but added 3 tea salt (1 tea/batch) to bring out the flavor. Sweet/salty is amazing. I gave these out for Christmas because I have some anti-junkfood relatives, these flew right under their radar ha ha. I had to keep in mind the people that might be allergic so I made puppy chow and Peppermint bark popcorn also. All good for making in bulk.

I feel lucky to have stumbled across this recipe.  I've made it 3 times now...and it's always a huge hit!  It's SO easy to make, that I was able to whip up an extra batch while I was talking with my guests.  It makes the house smell great, everyone wants the recipe...even my Mother-in-law who is a gourmet chef was impressed.  I make extra and give them away as "thanks for coming" gifts.  I have used pecans each time...so cunchy and yummy...even my 3 1/2 year old daughter LOVES them!  I feel like a celebrity when I make these, everyone is soooo impressed and they all want more.  It's easy, a no brainer, and my new "specialty."  WARNING:  They're addictive!!!!

Thanks for an AWESOME recipe!!!!

I love these nuts! I made them a couple of years ago and gave them as gifts. Everyone loved them. I had a hard time finding the recipe again and was so excited when I finally did. It is now in my all recipes recipe box. The crumbs are great on cooked carrots!

This recipe was good but it wasn't sweet enough. I added 1/2 cup of white sugar and decreased the baking time to 25 minutes. My boyfriend loved them!

I've made these twice - both times got raves from the family!  The first time I made it as instructed, snd the second, I had to play.
I used pecans, 2-3 T of dried orange peel and about 1 t of nutmeg (and of course, the brown sugar and egg white).  YUM!!!
This is one of those recipes that you can totally change to fit your family - add any combo of spices... awesome!

I made three pounds of these using pecans for our recent family Thanksgiving gathering. They were wonderful. Buy the end of the day they were all gone. I had many request for the recipe. I plan to make more and include them in gift baskets for Christmas.

LOVE this recipe.  It was the first spiced nut recipe I tried making myself and I won't try any others.  I did increase the vanilla and cloves the second time I made them and it was great, but these are perfect just the way there are listed.  I do prefer the walnuts or pecans over the almonds, but that may be just my personal taste.

I was looking for something to do with the nuts from our Pecan Tree and this was perfect!!  I gave them out as little extra gifts last December and the were a big hit.  I did make a few changes.  I cooked them a bit longer, I think around 45 minutes and I mixed the up a bit every 15 minutes.  I also sprinkled them with a mixture of cinnamon, when I first put them in and after the first mixing (so the whole nut got the spices).  My biggest problem was time.  We had buckets of nuts and I only had time to get through one.:-S  But everyone loved and I'll be making this holiday season too!  Thank you so much for this recipe.

I made two batches of pecan and almond.  Everyone raved about them both, and asked for the recipe.  I putting them in my gift baskets this year because they are so quick and easy to make.

I have been looking for a spicy nut that is not
too sweet or too salty. My husband and I agree
this is the best one I have tried. I have tried
quite a few. This is the only one I will keep!

I used pecans and replaced the cloves with a bit of cayenne pepper. They were incredibly delicious and added texture and a good crunch to the strawberry spinach salad I served at our party. Thanks Rosemary!

Great!  Put these on the Strawberry and Spinach salad for a yummy touch!  As suggested by other reviews I added 1/2 cup white sugar, I followed the rest exactly.  It was very helpful to use parchment paper for the baking, made for easy clean-up.  They didn't turn out sticky at all.  Very tasty even by themselves for a snack!

I tried this recipe with peanuts, since those are cheap and I was testing the flavor (not a big fan of cloves, myself). The flavor came out fine but some of the nuts burned while some never got entirely done. It was sort of a sticky mess and not what I wanted, but from reading the other reviews, I'm sure I did something wrong. I tried it twice though so either peanuts are a bad idea or my oven is screwy.

This recipe is wonderful!  I use these nuts chopped over a salad  with lettuce and gorgonzola cheese with either sliced apple or pear and balsamic vinagrette dressing.  Everyone loves it!  I double the recipe (because my husband eats them all before we can use them on salad) and still use 2 tbsp cinnamon and substitute nutmeg for cloves.  It comes out perfect.

Everyone loved these nuts (pecans).  I do agree that 30 minutes of bake time should be cut to 25 min as they have a tendancy to burn if you are not careful.

I needed a quick snack to take to a neighborhood party.  Glazed Nuts did the job!  I got many compliments on them.  Co-workers raved about them, too.  I suggested All Recipes website to a novice cook/co-worker.

I was not that impressed with these nuts. They were not as visually appealing or as tasty as some other candied nut recipes I've tried, such as Cinnamon-Roasted Almonds on this site. I wish I had just used that coating recipe for the walnuts too. I think by adding the clove and ginger this recipe might be trying too many flavors. This also didn't seem as sweet to me, even though it uses the same amount of sugar as the other.

Super easy. Also good with chile powder added to the sugar mix. I use a tbsp. of Chipolte powder, but my family likes things hot. I tell people I coat the nuts with opiates because they are so addictive!

Glazed nuts, particularly almonds, are very popular during Christmas in Germany.  I really like these with a bit of salt to offset the sweetness.

I tossed these into a salad (3/4 iceberg lettuce, 1/4 spring mix), and with mango slices and sesame thai dressing (Newman's)and it was a hit with my dinner guests (they munched on the leftover nuts after dinner). Used pecans.

This recipe is so simple and fast.  It makes your house smell as if you've been baking all day.  I ended up using more nuts than the one pound.  I bought a bag of 2.5 pounds and used about half the bag.  These are great for teacher gifts, neighbors and parties.  Give them a try.  My two daughters even liked them and they don't usually eat nuts.

I really didn't like these nuts, something abot the spices just wasn't right. I tried a different yet similar spiced nut recipe and found them to be delicious though. Maybe it's the brown sugar versus white sugar or the ginger (the other recipe had nutmeg and cloves)? I don't know, but my husband and I both decided we won't be making these again, sorry!

I took the advice of another reviewer and added an extra 1/2 cup of white sugar and decided to use 1T cinnamon instead of 2T.  I used these nuts in a ceasar salad for the holidays with calamata olives and parmesan cheese.  Everyone loved the salad and raved about the nuts.  Gave a normal ceasar the salad a wonderful holiday flavor.

I think I would decrease the amount of the spices in this a little bit, It overpowers the nuts slightly but...overall a good recipe. Great texture, light and crispy.

I pulled this recipe off a few years ago and year and year it is a hit for the holidays!  I have been asked for the recipe over and over again.  I usually make 3-4 pounds of these and and put them in holiday bags for gifts.  I always use pecans....they taste much better than walnuts and are not bitter.

Incredibly easy recipe.  Great result with minimal time.  I thought the amount of cloves would have been overpowering (my husband even commented on the smell while I was mixing them) but after they were baked the flavors blended quite well.

This recipe is great but just a little too dry.  I would add less nuts that the recipe asks for.  Also I would bake for 25 minutes only.

I make these nuts exactly as the recipe is written. My husband and I love that they're not overly sweet like most candied nut recipes, we love the spice of this recipe.  The fact that they're not coated in a ton of sugar makes them a fairly guilt-free snack.

This recipe was not what I thought it would be. They were pretty good, but if I make them again I would omit ginger and cloves, and watch them very carefully in the oven.

Perfect. Easy. Quick. Ok I'm new to candy making but in my view I think the "soft ball" stage (besides the thermometer and the drop in water test) appeared to be when the sugar syrup darkened and thickened to the point of maple syrup consistency. I mean real maple syrup. Hope this is helpful!

My new favorite snack!  I made this for a party and it went over great.  They're sweet but so are most glazed nuts.  Like one of the videos showed, I let the egg white drain off the nuts for a few minutes before mixing with dry ingredients.  The nuts looked fine and tasted even better!

This is extremely easy to make and a big hit with the nut lovers in our family.  I personally do not eat nuts but I am told they are outstanding every time I make them. There are never any leftover.

I thought that the sweetness would come out more in this recipe. It had an interesting taste. One that made you want to eat more just to figure out if you liked it or not. I will not be making this again because I needed it for a Christmas party and these are not good enough to take to a party. I will look for more of a "sugared nuts" recipe.

This recipe was AMAZING! I loved these nuts. They were sooooo easy. I made them for Thanksgiving, and my whole family loved them. For a twist I added some pumpkin pie spice and when they came out of the oven I dusted them with powdered sugar and cinnamon. That finished it off! These were soooo yummy! Thanks Rosemary!

I cannot say enough about this recipe! My guests LOVED LOVED LOVED it!  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.  Not extremely sweet so I thought was ok but my guests LOVED that about the glaze.  Will certainly make this all the time.  Very easy!

I loved this recipe.  So easy, with great results.  I used pecans and cashews.  When they came out of the oven I sprinkled a little white sugar on top and mixed.  It just added a little sweetness.  I made this for our family Christmas and everyone loved them.  I will make this again!!!

Craveable!  Barely any left!  My five year old and I made these together.  They were simple to make and easy.  Only change was omitting the ginger, otherwise exactly as stated.   Some may want to increase sugar but these were not too sweet, the way I like it.  Turned out crispy and all together awesome.  Making big batches of these for teacher gifts, etc.

Love this. Makes the house smell like Christmas, and these are great on fancy salads, at parties, or for camping trips. I use pecans instead.

Very easy and tasty. Made them with 1/2 walnuts and 1/2 pecans since I didn;t have a full lb of either. Even the non-nit lovers liked them. very good for parties.

this tasted like brown sugar with some nut in there somewhere -- not bad but not great. so sticky they aren't even fun to eat. and they actually stuck to wax paper! i won't do this again.

This recipe is delicious.  Walnuts are a great source of Omega-3 and this recipe makes eating them enjoyable.  The only problem is that is difficult to stop munching once you start.

Fascinating. I served these at Christmas instead of the usual normal bowl of nuts. Even my oma, who really doesn't eat anything anymore, snacked them away. They're flavourful and surprising.
