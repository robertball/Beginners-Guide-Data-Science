My kids loved this. I used shells instead of elbow mac, and leftover ham instead of the tomatoes. Also used ritz crackers and that did give it a nice sweet taste. I think it could have used more milk to make it a bit creamier as ours was pretty dry. But still good!

This was pretty good.  It's NOT at all like traditional mac and cheese so don't go into making it expecting anything like that. For us, it was a nice change of pace as a side dish. I made very minor changes - halved the recipe, shells not elbows and diced tomatoes instead of whole.  Otherwise I made it as written.  It could use some salt and pepper maybe, but then again the simple flavors of the tomatoes and cheese were kind of nice, not overpowered by a lot of other seasonings.  I can see making this again.

Just made this. Not going to lie I forgot the milk. But I did add pizza shredded cheese, mild salsa, the liquid cheese in the pack, and sandwich pepperoni. And it wasnt half bad. Definately, have some twerking to do to get just right..

My family and I really loved this recipe. I LOVE mac and cheese so I'm always looking for different kinds to try and this one was delicious and different. I will be making this again

Bland and dry. I had to add a can of cream of mushroom soup to salvage it.
