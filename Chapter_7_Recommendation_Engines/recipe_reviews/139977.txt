I recently went to dinner at my extended family's home and they served up this dish. It was absolutely fantastic! Admittedly, I enjoy cabbage. Admittedly, I am not big on cloves. But, put together and is terribly tasty. After I found out the recipe was from here I immediately looked it up and was surprised by what little feedback there was. I must say I probably would have skipped this recipe over with so few people having tried it. How great that I was able to have an opportunity to try this keeper of a recipe. It is on my stove as we speak (really) and I am going to cook it just as directed for the full 2 hours. I know first hand it is worth it. I wouldn't change a thing!

This is seriously good food and very easy to prepare (can't imagine that it would take anyone 20 minutes to prep - more like five)!  Taking the advice of other reviewers, I reduced the sugar by one tablespoon and used only one teaspoon of kosher salt.  I was probably a tablespoon shy of 1/3 cup on the vinegar, too.  Had no ground cloves, so threw 3-4 whole cloves in.   The result was addictive!  Didn't want to quit eating it!  I was skeptical of the extended cooking time, but having tried it after about 45 minutes, there's no question it is much better later.  The apple (I peeled mine) basically disappeared during the cooking process, so next time I might just use applesauce to make the prep even faster.  This makes a great side dish for turkey, as a less-sweet substitute for cranberry sauce.  I added cold leftovers of it to a turkey sandwich - yum!  It would also be delicious served with roast chicken or duck, grilled or steamed bratwurst, kielbasa, baked ham.   Recommend doubling the recipe.  Leftovers can be used cold on turkey or ham sandwiches and take well to reheating.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner because my husband and grandmother wanted it. Growing up I disliked sweet/sour cabbage, and how it smells while cooking ,  but after tasting - I am a convert! The only addition I made was to add one diced onion. Many other family members who don't eat cabbage loved it too. We ended up with an empty bowl and I doubled the recipe!

This recipe was amazing! I made it for an Oktoberfest inspired b-day party. It smelled awful while it was cooking so I was a little nervous but the results were well worth the smell. The only problem I had was I wish I had made more :)

This is really good. For the first time, I made it as written except I followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced the amount of sugar and added garlic. Couldn't stop eating. It's so good and appetising!!

Now I make my own variations. I used EVOO instead of butter. I added mustard seeds and I also lightly crush the black peppercorns. I like to bite on them! I added onions too. I tripled the recipe, threw all into the slow cooker and cooked on high for 4 hours. I'd put them in jars and refrigerate them. Used them like pickles or relish for burgers/sandwiches. I served them whenever I serve roasts or fried meats. It gives a sharp refreshing contrast of taste and flavour. I even put a small amount on small squares of toasts and ham, topped with a dot of mustard. Served them as tapas with a big icy jug of sangria. It was very popular. I've even had it for breakfast with fried eggs and bacon.

"Dump all ingredients in pot and cook."  Doesn't get any easier.  The result captures the mild sweetness of the cabbage perfectly, the ingredients all enhance the flavor without competing.

I've never had this before, but I made it today for a German themed dinner.  It is AMAZING!  The only thing I did was add a chopped onion, and I put a little more clove in it (because I LOVE clove and thought it would be great with this).

Another lady brought a different version of this and put Caraway seed in hers.  It may be good in this recipe for something different.  :)

Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!!

We LOVED this dish. I was looking for an authentic recipe after having cabbage served this way at a German restaurant. The combination of the butter, vinegar and sugar make the dish great. I followed the recipe and the cooking time which seemed long but it really needed the hour to cook.  I didn't have cloves but used a dash of cinnamon instead. I read that cinnamon or allspice can be used as a substitute for cloves.

This is a fantastic recipe for a slow-cooker.  I dump everything in the cooker, turn it on low for 5-6 hours and go.  I don't change a thing.  When something is this good, leave it alone!

I have been using this recipe for years.  I cut back on sugar a little. Add just a touch of beer when cooking.I  serve whenever I make perogies.  My family loves it.

Delicious! Didn't know red cabbage could taste so good.  I will cut the sugar by half next time and perhaps use an additional apple to make it a bit healthier.

A fantastic recipe. I made it to a T, except for using only 3 tablespoons sugar, less salt, and using red wine vinegar because I didn't have apple cider vinegar. Wonderful!

I made this and it was tasty. I did sub caraway for the cloves, my personal preference. Although my children did not appreciate the smell while it was cooking!

I'll be honest, this sounded horrible to me.  But I had an entire red cabbage from a CSA to use and thought why not.  And I'm glad I did.  This was great.  Even my girlfriend was cringing until she tried it.  Within days, she was making it at her house.

I cook a German dinner once a month for 45 people at an upscale living center. I use this recipe each time. It is fantastic. I have to make more each month, because they like it so much.
Who would ever think red cabbage could taste so good? Thanks for sharing.

I made Sauerbraten for the first time and decided to use this recipe for a side, along with Speatzle. I invited a friend who is from Germany over to critique my efforts. This recipe was a hit, very delicious and perfect with the Sauerbraten. My German friend was very complimentary of its taste, everyone loved it. My daughter in law had never eaten a cabbage prepared this way and was amazed at how tasty it was. I will make this again, and at my friends suggestion I will add some caramelized onion, but otherwise it was great just as is.

This is a good recipe, but for us, needs a little tweaking.  It had W-A-Y too much salt and just a little too much sugar (maybe personal taste preferences).  I'd start with 1/2 tsp salt, cut the sugar in half the next time and then adjust those ingredients as necessary.  At least for us, I think that will give us the correct balance of sweet-sour-savory that we're looking for.  I chopped the apple, and liked the way it cooked down and incorporated itself into the red cabbage.  I've tried a number of red cabbage recipes on this site, and I must say that this one is right there at the top of my list.

Loved it!  I will make it again and again.  We just returned from Bavaria and I had a craving for red cabbage.  Well my craving was satisfied.  It was easy and yummy!  And for those who are not clove lovers.  You can barely taste the clove.  It really just enhances the flavors.

I had this huge head of red cabbage and tried the recipe , OMG. I love all the flavors. So when it was all gone. I used up the rest of the cabbage, doubled the amount except I only used 1/2 the butter. ( watching my calories). I could not tell the difference . I then froze individual servings. I pulled some out for dinner last night and it was amazing. I will be making again  and again. Great side dish!

easy and yummy--hubby was suspicious but after one bite was a huge fan, and my toddler daughter loved it!
I made one substitution---used dark brown sugar instead of white sugar.
Also, I cooked in the crockpot on low for 6 hours...this will be a Winter staple in our house- thanks!

My Great Grandma from Germany made this every holiday.  I fry up 4 strips of bacon and use the grease instead of butter to cook the cabbage, apple and spices in.  Then I crumble the bacon and sprinkle it on top in the serving dish.  I also use 4-5 whole cloves and 4-5 black pepper corns instead of the ground cloves and pepper.  My whole house smells like childhood right now as it is cooking...love it!

My husband wanted traditional sauerbraten with a side of German red cabbage. In the past I've bought this in the jar, not realizing how simple it was to make from scratch.  Since our rural grocer did not stock the jarred German red cabbage, I was rescued by this recipe.  I did add an extra apple.  I assume the apples were to be peeled and did so.  The apples cooked up as expected adding just the right something to the cabbage.  We both thought this was delicious.  No more jars for us.  This was perfect with the Traditional Sauerbraten found on this site.

It was a hot day and I had been asked to bring my red cabbage recipe for a pork lunch. I have a good recipe which I usually use but looked online for one I didn't have to cook in the oven. I found this and tried it and it got the seal of approval. My man said "Whatever you have been doing with your red cabbage, do this instead". So yes a good recipe.
PS 1 cup of cabbage is 100gm

This is almost exactly the same recipe given to me by by German mother in law years ago..  Only difference is instead of butter, she cuts small pieces of bacon and the bacon fat is the oli.. I made this recipe, but can't get away from the bacon.. This is one of my favorite side dishes and is often requested by many of my friends..

I made this for an Oktoberfest party/potluck and everyone loved it.  The only thing I changed was cooking the cabbage in a crockpot on high for about 4 hours so I didn't have to sit with it.  This also made serving easy because it could be taken straight from the crockpot on warm setting.

This was delicious, even though I somehow managed to burn the cabbage.  After only 1 hour of simmering on low heat, the bottom of my pot was completely burned, along with a lot of the cabbage.

If anyone has any suggestions about what could have caused this, please let me know.  The recipe says to add only 3 tablespoons of water, but maybe more is needed.

The unburned part of the cabbage was delicious!  This is a wonderful dish, and I plan to make it again.

I made this exactly as written and thought it was amazing.  Even DH, who usually inhales, then asks for seconds, stopped a moment to comment on how good it was!  A perfect blend of sweetness and tartness, this will go into my regular rotation.

This has become my go to staple for the New Year. I use a large head about five times the recipe and keep it in the fridge for easy side dish or to quell a late night sweet tooth urge! I replace the sugar with stevia and honey making it healthier and less calories. I also cut the salt, personal preference. I have also used too ripe to eat pears for the apples and it was just as good. Love this low cost, low cal high fiber nutritious side dush

Although I'm a well-seasoned cook this was my first time cooking red cabbage.   I read a lot of the recipes and settled on this one. I never changed it at all and it was perfect and amazing. Just enough of the sweet and tangy flavour  to make my taste buds scream in delight.I love sauerkraut and this made a lovely change. I can't wait to make this again and I will be making it often. Thank you so much sarabug76

Just like my grandmother used to make....I remember her making this when I was a young girl. She died before I learned to cook and didn't have the time for her to teach me. My husband and I both had German grandmothers and this recipe is absolutely the best!! Thank you for sharing!

I thought this was very good and I will certainly make it again. I think I might add more apples. While it was tasty, and my husband enjoyed it (while admitting he doesn't usually care for cabbage), it didn't quite live up to the reviews, in my opinion. I may also have been judging it against the red cabbage at a local restaurant, which is truly addictive.

This recipe is SO GOOD! Almost better than how delicious it is is the fact that it's super easy to prepare. Definitely recommend cooking for the full two hours, also I added one chopped onion. I will be making this again...and again and again!

YUM, YUM, YUM!  I doubled the recipe and kept eating it as it was cooking.  DELICIOUS!  I don't usually make recipes as they are printed - have to do my own thing - but I did this one exactly as printed.  I really could have kept eating it all!!  But I restrained myself - with great difficulty.

I like my veggies cooked so they are soft and crunchy.  You lose so much nutritional value by cooking too long.  Cabbage has a lot of nutritional benefits.  I cooked mine maybe 20 minutes so the cabbage was crunchy and the apples were soft.  It turned out great!

Next time I might use Bragg's Apple Cider vinegar with a more natural sweetener.

Made this yesterday.  FABULOUS!  I used a huge granny smith and used Stevia rather than sugar and it turned out fine this way.  The ground clove was interestingly wonderful in this. About one half of a medium sized cabbage equaled the 5 cups.  Next time I'll double the recipe for sure. I braised the cabbage for about 2.5 hours.  Delicious, nutritious and actually so simple to make and tweak according to personal tastes.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight and it came out great. I had 3 heads of red cabbage so I had to adjust the seasonings. I used 3 teaspoons of salt I did not triple it. I used 1/2 tsp of ground clove instead of 3/4 tsp. I did triple the apple cider vinegar and sugar and 3/4 tsp of black pepper. I also used 2 cups of diced onions and I added about 1 cup of red wine. My wife approved of the finished product and said she would put it up against her mothers red cabbage anytime and her mother is bona fide German!

Make this the day before! I didn't have ground cloves so threw in some whole ones. The clove flavor was very pronounced the first day but mellowed the next and was super tasty.

I made this tonight for an Oktoberfest potluck. It was delicious and got gobbled up. Very easy make. I only had McIntosh apples but they worked fine. You need a LOT of cabbage because it does reduce a great deal.

Oh my gosh, this was delicious!  I had a craving for cabbage, which I never cook and my man won't eat, and found this recipe.  I made it for a family gathering around Octoberfest, and I'm so glad I tried it!  Healthy and so yummy. I put everything in my crockpot on low for about 4 hours, and it was perfect.  And so easy!  I only had to stir it a few times, and I had to stop myself from eating it all before my dinner party.  A little cloves go a long way IMO, so I only used 1/8 teaspoon, and it was perfect.  Also subbed applesauce for the sliced apples, and added half a sliced onion.  Will definitely make again!

Not only delicious but incredibly healthy! Par-cooked cabbage releases much more nutrients than raw. I used stevia instead of sugar and less salt (added a pinch of caraway seeds for punch). I made a double recipe hoping to have left overs but the bowl was empty.

I had been searching for a recipe for Red German Cabbage ever since my husband and I had some in a German restaurant in Pennsylvania many years ago.  This recipe was very easy to prepare and hit a home run.  I will reduce the salt a little bit next time.  I didn't have any cloves so used allspice in place of it. Worked well.

I thought this was good. Not too much vinegar. I did not put in all the sugar and salt, though. Only 2 TB sugar and 1 tsp salt.

this was great, I have always wanted a recipe for Red Cabbage and now I have found one. My daughter and I truly enjoyed this recipe and this will definitely be a keeper. I reduced the sugar and this turned out great. Next time I will reduce the vinegar.

It's Octoberfest in Texas and German fare is definitely on the menu.  This is authentic tasting!  Served with weiner schnitzel, rouladen,wurst, and spatzle and (some beer)............and you can have your own Octoberfest/Wurstfest!  There are some very good recipes for German potato salad on this site.  Great ethnic food.

Totally screwed this recipe up the first time I made it as I had run out of ground cloves, had no whole ones and looked for caraway seeds to grind and didn't have those either. So I thought I would just use ground anise (Okay for anyone who thinks that might be a valid alternative...let me say I found it to be pretty darn awful). Made this a second time with ground cloves; what a huge difference! Next time I might increase the apple, lessen the sugar and possibly add a pinch of ground fennel as it would taste more like my grandma's. Thank you sarabug76 for sharing your grandmother's recipe.

I had some extra red cabbage to use up, so I thought I would give this a try. It wasn't bad.  We liked it alright but didn't love it.  If I had red cabbage on hand I would make it again.  I might change the ratio and add more apples.  But I wouldn't go buy red cabbage just to make this.  Of course, if you're a huge fan of red cabbage, you might love it.

Delicious recipe.   I make it for Christmas every year and it's on the stove as I speak.
 
I wish people would stop changing recipes, and then posting "reviews" of the "recipe."  "I added caraway seeds", "I added an onion",  "I used less sugar", "I used whole cloves instead."  "I didn't have yada yada so I substituted XYZ".  

If you do this, you are not reviewing this recipe.  You are reviewing your own recipe.  Yes, you may have used this recipe for inspiration, but you changed it into a different recipe.  This isn't helpful to those of us who are not into changing recipes and who want to know what THIS recipe is like.  

BTW, I don't change this recipe at all.

Excellent recipe! Just the right mix of sweet and sour. I was a little wary of adding clove, but I figured I should step outside my comfort zone. Glad I did. Quite easy to make. Thanks

I was looking for a recipe to use up leftover red cabbage and was skeptical, but this recipe didn't disappoint. I didn't have a green apple, so I used a small gala, a little less sugar, and it was delicious.

This was delicious...but made some changes. I decreased the salt to 
1 teaspoon, & doubled the vinegar. Had it with pork tenderloin & will make it again. My husband really liked it.

This is my go-to recipe when I get red cabbage from my CSA.  I do this in the crock pot with pork chops nestled on top.

Excellent--but I dropped the salt to 1/2 teaspoon...cooked it in the pressure cooker for 5 minutes after jiggle.  Let stand another 5 then reduced the pressure.  So good!

The only change I made was adding some fennel as others suggested about 1/2 tsp.  It was delicious!  will definitely be making it again.

This is an absolute favorite in my house. My husband raves about it. I usually serve up some bratwurst with it. I never have apple cider vinegar and it works well with white wine vinegar or even white vinegar and a splash of apple juice. I also cool it for about an hour and a half and the texture is perfect.

I had never had cooked cabbage before as a stand some dish but really liked it here.  It is very sweet and even though I cut back on the recommended amount of sugar this time I will add even less next time.

I have made this recipe now over a dozen times and its amazing.  It reminds me of my trip to Germany. I have made it with green and red cabbage and its been great either way.  I prefer the red.  I have occasionally even thrown  pork chops in with it to cook.

It was tasty enough and the kitchen aromas were wonderful while it was cooking, but the ingredients cook down to a small amount of food with too much butter, salt and sugar.

Was a little skeptical at how easy the recipe is to prepare, but just made it last Sunday, 1/26/14, and it was absolutely delicious and so authentic.  My only worry was trying to estimate the amount of cabbage as 5 cups of shredded is hard to estimate.  Would be better if the recipe stated an approximate size of a head of cabbage.  I used one that I would describe as medium large; I did add more water and a bit more cider vinegar as the water will cook off, but not dilute the flavor so don't worry about that.  My husband assured me of this as he cooks the best sauerkraut and knows about these things.

Prepared to spec:  Way to bitter, too much vinegar.  Perhaps cutting the cider vinegar in half would yield a more balanced flavor.  Otherwise, I would not prepare this again...

This is absolutely delicious!  I made this for me and my fiance, and both of us prefer our red cabbage to be little sweeter, so I substituted the vinegar for apple juice.  I added a tbsp of white vinegar though just to keep enough tartness.  Also, I didn't have any cloves or ground cloves on hand, so I used nutmeg which was a great substitute.  I think you're better off cooking it as long as you can if you have the time!  I let mine simmer 2 hrs. and 15 minutes, and it was great.  Thanks for sharing this!

Dang Grandma Jeanette! (Sara) you have GOT SOME GAME GIRL!!!! 

Every once in a while I volunteer cook the Senior Lunch at my local community centre - and today (Oct 30th) the theme was "Oktoberfest" - so I made a German-inspired lunch... fried potato pancake with bratwurst on top with gravy, pretzel and GRANDMA JEANETTE'S RED CABBAGE.

WOW. Everyone was raving about the red cabbage! Never mind the potatoes, never mind the Bratwurst... we had more compliments and recipe requests for the red cabbage.

I have eaten a fair share of red cabbage in my life and I never imagined it could be this good! Thank you for making me a star cook!

Absolutely amazing!!! I grew up in Germany and CRAVE German food. I try every place I can and with my last experience at an expensive restaurant being a TOTAL miss, Jagerschnitzel had no flavor or mushrooms, the cabbage wasn't cooked enough and had absolutely NO flavor and as anyone knows that have eaten German food, it is packed full of flavor! I decided to start making my own! I found the perfect Jagerschnitzel recipe and was on the lookout for the perfect red cabbage recipe..... Well this is it!! Finger licking good! It made so much I was eating it for days with anything! Definitely a keeper! Thanks for a great nostalgic recipe!

Brown sugar adds depth. And a few cranberries are super. Cook low & slow. Also used russet apples with peel on. Great texture. Can’t  stop sampling!

I absolutely love marinated slaw which has the exact same ingredients in it so I went for this one.  I guess it is just not my cup of tea.  Made it exactly as directed.  Just tastes too much like sauerkraut to me....but I like sauerkraut so go figure.  Something about the mushy cabbage just turned me off.  To each his own

My family did not care for this. I'd suggest to anyone who decides to make this, cut way back on the salt. I followed the recipe, and 2 tsp of salt is overkill. The flavor of the dish was just "off," and I can't really describe it, but I doubt I'll make it again.

Such a hit!! We did not have any green apples on hand, so omitted them and it was still fabulous.  Good alternative for boiled-to-death green cabbage the next time you make corned beef!  YUM!

I had two heads of CSA red cabbage and was trying to find a way to use them.  One went to this recipe, made with about 1/8 cup of sugar, but otherwise followed.  It was tasty enough.

I should have peeled the apples, I wondered but since the instructions gave no help I didn't and we all ended up picking out green apple skins.

I made Jagerschnitzel along with this and we had our own little Oktoberfest.

This was so good.  Mike and I ate extra helpings.  Liked that there was still a little bit of crispness to the cabbage.  Mine had got totally limp after 1 and a half hours of cooking.  The flavor was delcious with the Saurebraten I made for dinner.

We were going to my husband's parents for Easter. Both of them are of German descent. I made this recipe for 12 people. It was a big hit with everyone. In fact, my husband's parents ask if they could keep the red cabbage I brought for them later in the week. That was the highest compliment anyone could receive. Thank you for posting this "keeper recipe".

This recipe is exactly like I've always had in German restaurants and it is so good--tastes like candy! And it was easy to make! I didn't have cider vinegar, so I substituted white wine vinegar and is was just as good!

This is just like the description.  Yummy, sweet and sour and easy to make!  It is great warm and just cooked or cold from the fridge after a few days.  A great use for red cabbage.  This recipe doesn't need any modifications.

I've had delicious red cabbage in Germany and this recipe topped it. :) I loved and so did our guests. My husband was not as much of a fan, but I can't get cabbage into him no matter what I do to it and he still ate it. ;)

This was pretty good.  I had a head of red cabbage I needed to use and I found this recipe.  I added a sliced onion and, with the apple, they just melted into the cabbage.  The cloves made a surprisingly tasty addition, though I also added a pinch of allspice.  Reminds me of a softer, milder sauerkraut.  Would make again if we had a "German" night.

i was scared to do this on my electric stove(i have burned red cabbage even on low before). i threw it all in my slow cooker along w/ an onion. i cooked on high 30 mins and then low for 2-3 hrs. the flavor was good. maybe a tad too vinegary. next time i will try brown sugar and a little less vinegar. thanks so much for the recipe! served w/ venison schnitzel and turos csusza(pasta with cottaged cheese) all from this site. update: this was better the next day. gives it time for the flavors to blend more

I look for recipes to remind Dad of the mouthwatering dishes his Hungarian mother made.  This one was just like the homecooking we enjoyed at her house and in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria.  I made no changes.  We just enjoyed her perfect combination of traditional flavors.  Thanks for the contribution, Sara and cheers to your Grandma Jeanette!

A very easy recipe. We served this with a pork roast. Very tasty, I added an additonal 2 TBSP of sugar to make it a little on the sweeter side. Our German and Polish guests loved the dish. I put this in my recipe collection.

Easy and good. Use  2 tbsp brown sugar and 1/2 cup vinegar. Don’t worry that it starts looking dry. Push nearly done cabbage aside and brown kielbasa slices with a little stir fry sauce.

Giving this recipe 4 stars instead of 5, as I found the recipe almost too simple. I know it seems quite elementary, but there is no direction to check/stir  the cabbage while simmering for 1 1/2 hours, which unfortunately resulted in a completely burnt cabbage bottom to my stainless steel pot. I recognize that stainless steel is more sensitive to heat than a non-stick or dutch oven, so I probably should have been more cautious - However, a heads up or extra step in the instructions would have been helpful. The cabbage that survived was quite tasty, and I am motivated to try this recipe again, but for those who may need the notice - Remember to stir here and there while your cabbage simmers!

I've made this twice, both with good results.  It tastes very authentic and is not difficult to make.  I got a little too heavy-handed with the cloves this time and it was a bit too intense - my fault.  I might cut back a little on the sugar next time, because it was pretty sweet.  However, overall a great recipe! If you are considering making this - do it!!!!

Great. Delicious. I made it in the pressure cooker on high for 20 minutes. Next time I will pressure cook it for 15 minutes. Also I used margarine instead of butter so it is vegan.

I really like this recipe except for ..........  It took much longer to cook than indicated by the recipe.  Maybe it was because the cabbage that I used had rather large ribs?  Anyway, it was quite odorous as others have mentioned.  The cabbage was still "chewy" after 2 hours, but after 4 hours of simmering the cabbage was nice and soft and just plain delicious.

Yum! I diced the apples rather than sliced them—don't do that (they got mushy and kinda gross). Next time I'll either make sure to slice them or I'll use applesauce like another reviewer suggested. I will definitely make this again!

This is my go-to recipe for Rotkohl.  Tastes exactly like the best red cabbage I've eaten in Germany.

I added a pinch of cinnamon. As a diabetic, I watch my sugar intake so I substituted the sugar with a sugar alternative and it came out just as yummy!

I made it close to the way the recipe calls except I did put in handful of chopped onion I had left over.  It was very good not too sweet - just right.

I don’t have any history with German food; I was just looking for a recipe to use for a lot of red cabbage from my CSA. This is delicious! As some suggested, I doubled the apple, cut the sugar a bit, and added a chopped onion. Highly recommend!

I stumbled upon this recipe and it has become my favourite cabbage dish. The apples basically dissolve and you're left with slightly(just barely) crunchy sweet and sour cabbage. I find it tastes similar to ketchup chip flavouring. It's a great acidic side dish to pair up with some fried/grilled sausages. Hard to mess up too. You can go off and focus on something else while it simmers. I found that ~70 minutes of simmering will do the trick.

They recently stopped selling my favorite jarred red cabbage in my local grocery store so I made this recipe instead of driving the 20 miles to the only store in my area for the jarred kind.   I used some cheesecloth to make a satchel and put the apple and 2-3 whole cloves in it instead of using the ground clove.  After simmering I removed the satchel so that I didn't have the apple and cloves in the finished product but still had their flavor in it. It was AMAZING  and just as good if not better than the already prepared and jarred red cabbage! I will be using this from now on to top my potato pancakes (in addition to sour cream of course)!

I sauteed 1/3 of a thinly sliced red onion in the butter 1st and replaced the cloves with allspice. It came out really delicious! I especially like the way the butter added a creamy flavor to it.

I loved the sweet and sour aspect of this recipe!!! Easy to make and very tasty. Was a great compliment to the rest of the German meal I prepared. I used unsalted butter to keep sodium count as low as possible. Definitely a keeper.

I made it in the pressure cooker. Takes 10 minutes. I used 2 sweet apples and only one tablespoon sugar.   (we had a family member that needed the substitution)  I used 3 whole cloves.  The rest of the ingredients exactly as written.  Tasted exactly the way my Mother (who was German) used to make.  She made Red Cabbage for every holiday meal. Everyone was impressed with my dish!

So good! The only thing I did different was grate the apple and cut back the club vets to 1/8 tsp because I don't care for a strong clove taste. I could sit down and eat the whole the nag with some good crusty bread!

Delicious! It tasted just like the red cabbage from a good German Restaurant. This is definitely my new Go-To Red Cabbage recipe from here on in.
I doubled the recipe, but halved the sugar because of what other commenters said. Good call on that too.

I didn't have apples when I made it but it turned out so good. I  didn't measure the ingredients just eyeball everything. This is a unique recipe that you should try just watch on the clove that you use, don't use too much.  I also cooked it for an hour and it was perfect, not overly cooked.

Easy and delicious.  I made it in my slow cooker (high for 4 hours), doubled the recipe (recipe is easily doubled), and added a small sliced onion.  Was delicious.  Bottom line is there are few common ingredients  (other than the ground cloves), it's simple to prep, and the end result is super.  Had it with beer bratwurst, and was filling.  As others recommended, used the cold leftovers as a "relish" for sandwiches and hot dogs.  Keeps well for almost a week.  Versatile recipe with many uses.  Will definitely make again.

Reduced the recipe for one person, so had to keep my eye on it so it wouldn't burn as there was not much water added.  Think I will boil the cabbage first then add the other ingredients and cook another half hour.  It was really tasty and easy to make.

My husband has made this twice and I made it today. I followed the recipe to the letter (I'm really bad about measuring!). Three times, excellent. The only thing we do different is the cooking time. The first time it was a bit mushy. Perhaps we're cutting the cabbage to thin, but we like a little bite to it. I cooked it today for 50 minutes and it was perfect. Love this recipe.

It was good and I didn't notice the clove at all but something was missing and I just can't put my finger on it. Maybe more spices. I normally buy it in a jar but when I noticed that they are putting high fructose corn syrup in it, I decided to make it myself. It was better than the one in the jar.

My best friend's husband called this dish "decadent", then admitted that he is not a fan of cabbage  and exclaimed "Wow" (and a few other words which are banned), finished his plate, went back for another helping, then finally wrapped up the left overs which he plans on having for breakfast!! A HIT!!

Home run with my family.  I doubled the recipe and cooked it on high in my electric pressure cooker.  Turned out perfect with no waiting.  Definitely a side to be added to my recipe rotation!

I used less than ¼ cup of sugar and loved how it tasted. I cooked in an instant type pot for 1 hour. No mess, no fuss. Delicious.

Very good just a touch too much clove. All home made red cabbage I have ever eaten has just a bit less clove taste. This is as good as any home made red cabbage I have ever eaten.

I married a German-American and as a Scandinavian, I had no idea how to make German red cabbage. My husband loved it, especially the apples. Excellent.

Love this recipe!  My wife and I make a pot almost every week.  I love the taste of clove and I slightly bump up the amount, but this is the best Rotkol recipe I have found and it has become a family fave.

I made this to top off our pork snitchzel with scallion mayo sandwiches for dinner. It was the perfect hit of sweetness and vinegar to cut through the fried pork cutlet.

Very good and easy recipe.  We added about a 1/4 cup of white vinegar to give it more of a sour taste.  I will defiantly make it again, but may substitute white vinegar for the apple vinegar.

Made it exactly as instructed. It was good, but not quite the same as I remember from my younger days. Also thought I was better with less cooking time, so it has more texture. An hour seemed better. Maybe will try it with some onions next time.

I didn’t allow for the hour and half cooking time, but a half hour on a fairly high heat worked fine although I did have to add water from time to time.  The cabbage was delicious!!

I made it as is, except to subtract a little over a tablespoon sugar as another reviewer did. I always find American recipes a little sugar & salt crazy.  (Yes, I'm an American, but we eat too much sugar & salt to the point that it sometimes gags me.)  Other than that, the recipe was super.  I'll definitely make it again!

Once again, a culinary delight =) didn't change anything, just the cooking time, since by the first hour it looked ready (and I was hungry!) I might add some garlic like one of the reviewers suggested, but just to see how it turns out.

This would be really good if Grandma Jeanette had used a little less salt (it does not really need any), added a couple of rashers of fine chopped bacon, had sautéed the bacon and cabbage for 10 minutes, and used whole cloves instead of ground cloves.

Just made this for the first time. Probably should have let it simmer for another 20 minutes. It was still very good and I will make it again, maybe with some Sauerbraten.

Last minute decision!
Decided to make this to accompany some oven roasted bratwurst (325 oven w/with onions and butter) on hotdog rolls.  Had a small head of red cabbage and some green apples, so tried it...excellent!  Even though I took liberties ( did not measure cabbage (1 small head)  or apples (used 3 small ones), used ground up cloves in mortar and pestle (no ground cloves), and turbinado sugar - plus used a tad bit extra butter (1-2 tbsp extra) and sugar (maybe an extra tbsp) to balance, as was a bit worried about the salt content req. (2 and 1/4 tsp).

Had made braised red cabbage in past used a recipe that req. cinnamon - recall now that recipe req. a lot of rejiggering .  NOT this recipe - was great as it was - Thanks so much!   That is a big deal - here we have a no-worry, flavorful braised red cabbage recipe.
PS: Actually was ready before the 2hr mark - and so darned good!!!!  So  Happieee!

I have been searching for a German cabbage recipe that tastes authentically like my Oma's, and after so many trials--using several German cookbooks, a recipe in Gourmet, and several Internet versions: butter, bacon fat, lard . . . I tired it all--I am happy to say that this is my go-to. The cabbage stays deep purple and will not bleed out into  a pink side-dish, and the balance between sweet and sour is perfect. The first time I made this recipe, I made it exactly as directed. For you clove skeptics out there, don't be! The clove taste is subtle and adds a bit more depth and heat than anything else . The second time I made it, I used brown sugar instead of white, because this is what my grandmother used. The end result was basically the same. The third time I made it, I added half a very large sweet onion, and I think this was a delicious addition. Still, the recipe is stellar and very authentic AS IS. Thank you for ending my perfect red cabbage hunt!!!

Grandma Jeannette you did good! I loved this it had just right ratio of sugar to vinegar. The only thing I added was a chopped small onion. I love onions and add them to almost everything. It definitely added a lot of flavor to the cabbage. Try it next time tyou make this!

Holy , this stuff is  amazing. I left out the cloves because they're gross, but after reading other reviews I may reconsider. Easy and tasty... what the hell else do you want from a recipe? Make it and shove it in your mouth hole.

This is my first review but I had to comment on this recipe. Oh my gosh!  This is delicious.  I used the exact ingredients but added one sweet onion and substituted allspice (no cloves).  I browned the onion first, added the rest of the ingredients and left it to cook.  I wish I would've doubled the recipe - we've been picking at it.  I hope there's some left for dinner.

I made this red cabbage to accompany a classic German dish of Sauerbraten and potato dumplings. I don't like red cabbage too tart so I added a little more sugar and water. It  came out just like my grandma used to make. Delicious!!

This turned out very good. We are on the Keto diet so I had to use a sugar substitute. Next time I may add a touch of apple cider to the mix.

Awesome recipe!    A perfect combination of sweet and sour.  I made two alterations:  I added one teaspoon of cinnamon, and I diced my apple into roughly half-inch pieces instead of slices.  I knew that this much cook time would cook sliced apples down to applesauce, and I still wanted that bit of "chunk" to my apple.   The result was very soft bits of apple!   I turned the heat off after one hour, and left the pot on the burner for about 10 more minutes.  It was perfect!   This recipe is a keeper!  Thank you Sara for this delicious red cabbage recipe!

This recipe was excellent just as written but I've made this before with excellent results but this time I followed my mother's input as she is European and was a professional cook for a time in her life. She always made this when I grew up and she always added one beef cube, a couple of shots of a European liquid seasoning named "Maggi" and finally a tablespoon of white flour toward the end of cooking. The flour actually turns the liquid in the into a light sauce which is nice too if you like that kind of thing. I'm not trying to take away from this recipe as I don't like it when people give a rating but have changed the entire nature of a recipe. I've made suggestions that can give a slightly different variation for people who want to try it.  Yummy!

Holy moly! I am never buying the pre-made stuff ever again! I followed the recipe as written and wouldn't change a thing. It was incredibly full of flavor and tasty. I paired it with bratwurst and home-made spaetzle and it was a wonderful German meal. Next time I'll probably double the recipe so we have more leftovers to snack on throughout the week. So easy!

I wanted red cabbage in a hurry.  I threw all the ingredients in the microwave and cooked them for 11 minutes.  Delish!  Microwave wattage varies.  I checked after 8 minutes and it was too crunchy.  Be sure to nuke it the least amount of time and add minutes as needed.

This  was delicious; we enjoyed it even though I didn't use enough sugar (halved the amount and it was a bit too tart--will adjust upward next time). It was great with ham. I'm going to try it again with less vinegar and sugar, a bit more butter, plus onion and caraway.

I made this just as instructed and I loved it. Honestly it wasn't a hit at  my Christmas Eve event. Apparently it is an an aquired taste. I first tasted cabbage like this at Madders in Milwaukee and love to order it whenever I can. This is very good, again I loved it and have had some each day since Christmas. Just heat it up and enjoy. Delicious!

This turned out perfectly! I used whole cloves, studded the apple slices and pulled them out after about a half hour of cooking. Also laid a few strips of bacon on top for the last half hour or so - I cooked it much longer than the recipe called for-  mostly because of poor time management - but it turned out delicious anyway!

My grandparents own a traditional German restaurant in Germany, and this is the closest red cabbage I have ever had to their restaurant's "Rotkohl" (Red Cabbage). The only thing relatively different I would say is that this recipe makes the texture a little tougher than that of my grandparents' restaurant. None the less, it tastes amazing!!

Soooo easy, and absolutely delicious.  I did cut down on the salt -- you can always add more later if you wish -- and next time, I may just reduce the amount of sugar ever-so-slightly.
But otherwise, it was just wonderful.  Thank you for this recipe!

I made this with http://allrecipes.com/recipe/25194/german-rouladen/. They went great together. I made this recipe just like it's written.  My husband's family came from Germany and he gives it the 5 stars.  I didn't try it.

I can see how others would like it but I guess I just don't like things that taste pickled. 

As others suggested I reduced sugar by 1tbsp. Only used 1tsp salt. I didn't have cloves so used all spice instead. Added 1 onion.

If don't have cloves - can use cinnamon or all spice. 
Can add garlic if want.

Great in sanwitches with meat, side for turkey, on burgers.

Smelly when cooking. Tastes better the next day.

Thank you so much! I fell in love with red cabbage when I studied in Germany and this recipe was perfect. It was very simple to make. Just chop every thing up and set it on the stove and walk away. This is a perfect compliment to a meat entree in the winter.

I made this for the first time for an Oktoberfest party we had. I added beets. It is delicious!!! Made it a second time and added caramelized onion and beets and it has become one of my favorite side dishes for sweet potato pancakes, my egg/avocado/black bean breakfast bowl, and german style mashed potatoes.

I used this recipe to make red cabbage for the first time. I had some tasty red cabbage when in Germany for Oktoberfest and hoped this recipe would produce a similar dish. I was not disappointed. My husband agreed it was as good as we had in Munich. I followed the recipe as written.

My husband loves German Red Cabbage (although, bless his heart, he thought it was green cabbage with food coloring!). I've never made it before and this recipe was delicious. I followed the directions exactly and he loved it. It's a little less vinegar-y than what is served at his favorite German restaurant, but he liked it better. I will definitely be making this again.

I'm sure this dish is really dependent on personal tastes. I was really hoping for a true kraut like flavor but should have known better with the amount of butter and apple was used. If you want a very mild vinegar flavor, and a hefty buttery after taste then this is probably the cabbage dish for you. I will keep searching for the recipe for the delightfully tangy red cabbage dish they serve up at The Brau Haus Chicago.

I've made a few recipes on this site for red cabbage dishes, and I think this one is my favorite.  I followed suggestions to add bacon and onion, reduce the salt and sugar a bit, and use cinnamon instead of cloves (which I don't like).  I served this with nice bratwursts.  I made enough for leftovers so I can try it cold, also as others suggested.  I'm trying to reduce carbs, and this is a really good way to do that.  Thanks for posting.

I used just 1t of table salt.  I usually try to make any recipe as stated and then change on later batches.  I used craisins and it was pretty tasty.  As a personal preference, I would slightly reduce sugar now that I have tried it again.  New cheat is to microwave 18 to 20 minutes.  I had some liquid left and finished on the stove.  This made me wonder about the need for water.  I will continue to make this.

Delicious!! I did reduce the amount of sugar a bit, but otherwise followed the recipe. I made it for a thanksgiving dinner, then made it again just for myself :)

This is exactly what I was looking for and it turned out great! I used honey instead of sugar and halved it. That's the only thing I changed

Delicious recipe. I usually add about half the recommended sugar, as otherwise it's really sweet. Goes well with brats and potatoes.

Fantastic with schnitzel. I added an extra tablespoon of butter, caramelized an onion before adding the rest of the ingredients, and cut the sugar by about half. I was tempted to shave a tad off the cloves, too, but by day two the flavors really came together. I wonder if a few red pepper flakes might also enhance this. Thanks for sharing!

I made this following the recipe exactly, it was (and is) the best recipe I have found.  Red cabbage is one of my husband's favorite sides, but not something I really cared for until I made this, we both just love it.  I don't even bother looking at the other recipes, I have no desire to stray!

This is the BEST red cabbage recipe EVER! I come back to it every time when making as a side dish for sauerbraten, beef rouladen or anything German. Thank you so much for posting! My German grandmother would approve!

This recipe is fantastic. Just been to Munich and fell in love with the red cabbage. I've always loved sauerkraut, but the red version (found this trip) is a lot sweeter and is just beautiful. I stuck to the recipe with only the few suggested changes.  I added the onion, 1 per the recipe. I halved the sugar and salt as per reviews, used unsalted butter(all I had) and doubled the recipe and used the slow cooker on high for about 5 hours. The double batch just fits, you have to squash it down to fit the lid on but cooks down to 3/4 of the bowl. It is beautiful, Just like what I had in Munich. As others said regarding the smell, I had to move it to outside on a table to cook as my family (who don't like sauerkraut) were complaining about the smell. Ooh how I love the smell.........yummmmmm. Thank you so much for this lovely recipe.

This is easy and authentic.  For some reason I cannot find jarred red cabbage any longer in the grocery stores so I started making my own from this recipe to accompany fall dishes.  I freeze small bags of it and it seems to work well.  You will love the smell in your kitchen as it simmers.  Yummy.

The flavors were great but WAY TO MUCH SALT in this recipe!  It really ruined it for me.  I will make it again but I will use less than half of the recommended salt.  Also, mine was done in 45 minutes.

Made it as written, which I like to do the first time to evaluate the recipe on its own. I thought the flavors were good as is.  But it's not a dish we want a lot of, or leftovers from; a little goes a long way.   A small head of cabbage made quite a bit.

This red cabbage recipe was ok but I prefer cabbage cooked other ways. Certainly is easy. I added a small amount of sliced onion. Be sure the apple is firm and tart.

I was looking for a red cabbage recipe to go with an Oktoberfest dinner of brats and German potato salad.  After an online search that led me to recipes involving balsamic vinegar, Japanese rice vinegar and other ingredients that seemed too fussy, I came upon this one.  It's a winner.  My San Francisco foodie guests were scraping the bowl!  Only change I made was to cut back on the salt, which seemed excessive, and I also used about 8c cabbage rather than the 5 called for.

I did not cook this recipe for the full two hours because I like my veggies a little crispier.  It has a nice flavor and makes a pretty side dish with its bright purple color.  I also was a little short on the red cabbage and substituted one cup of shredded carrots for the last cup, which gave it a confetti look.  I'll make this again.

Finally a decent red cabbage recipe. My picky husband even loved it. I substituted red wine vinegar in place of Apple cider. It was delicious!

Oh, I so wanted to like it. Was I the only one who found this to be too bitter? Because of that bitterness, I just couldn't really enjoy it. It may be just the cabbage but I wonder what can be done to get rid of that bitterness. My hubby liked it although I don't think he loved it.
I doubled the recipe after reading rave reviews so I wonder if that made it even more bitter.(having too much cabbage...I don't know...).
I will try one more time since I still have half of the cabbage left and see if it comes out any better. 
I was also a bit surprised at the color. I thought it would be bright purple color just like you see at a restaurant or store bought ones but it wasn't.

This worked out great-- I added an onion based on other reviews. I wish I would have added a bay leaf but next time. My German relatives agreed it was great, so that's the important thing. It was super easy to make. I literally made it during a phone conference while working from home. I made it 1 day before our shindig and it was fine to reheat. This is a much easier red cabbage recipe than a previous one I tried, but the results were awesome. My house smelled like Oma's kitchen :)

As is, this recipe is a bit salty for my taste.  Simple solution, cut back on the salt.  I've made this recipe every year for Christmas and it's always a huge hit.  I've made a few changes over the years.  One is that I add 1 Large Shredded red apple and 1 medium shredded granny smith apple.  I've also added 1/3 cup semi-sweet red wine and 3 tablespoons of the apple cider vinegar.  It comes out a little sweeter and closer to the way my German grandmother used to make.

I really like red cabbage made this way and this recipe is good. The finished product was a bit too sweet for me, but I think I used more apples than required. Next time I'll probably reduce the sugar, though. And I might peel the apples because, while the skins didn't affect the taste, they look a bit weird.

I debated between 4 and 5 stars, only because of the salt.  I used a half teaspoon, it was plenty.  I've tried several different recipes for red cabbage, this one is my favorite.  It's not too sweet, not too sour, and makes a nice amount.

OMG. I've had some great cabbage but this was out of this world. Pair this with Beirocks or Rouladon and mashed potatoes and you'll have half of Germany lining up for dinner. This is a MUST try.

I really do not like cloves so it was a given that I left that ingredient out.  I think I should of let it cook just a little longer to let the apples soften, and after tasting it I added a tad bit more sugar.  But overall this was really good!  I served it with Kielbasa and potatoes. My boys said it was a nice change from the sauerkraut I normally serve.  I will be making this one again.

Excellent.  I made 2 small changes that had been suggested.  I added about 1/4 c diced onions (sauted) and 2 strips of crumbled bacon.  I think they added to the recipe but the recipe is just so good.  I have eaten a lot of red cabbage at German restaurants and this is the best I have eaten.

I followed the recipe exactly except I cut down on the sugar and salt. Tasted it after the 2 hours cooking and it was OK but too sweet and sour.  Looked over the recipe again and realized I'd forgotten the butter!  Shot a pat or so in and cooked for another 45 min and tasted again and it was fantastic.  The butter gives a rich earthiness so don't omit it.  My Papa is coming over for dinner for a German meal.  Rouladen, Spaezle & Red cabbage.  Can't wait to see what he thinks because we usually cook it with caraway.

My husband loves, loves, loves red cabbage.  In an effort to get away from store bought jar type foods, I made this up for him.  It was a hit for sure and makes a lot more than feeding just four people - it lasts in the refrigerator for at least a week.

I love German red cabbage so decided to try this along with a sauerbraten which recipe I found on this site as well.  All in all the meal was just TOO  sour and I didn't enjoy ANYTHING.  I doubled the recipe and all leftovers got tossed.  I'm still giving this 4 stars b/c it's not the cabbage's fault I made such a sour meal.  Probably wont try again.

There's a very good German restaurant in town that makes a delicious red cabbage. I think this is better. Like some other reviewers I used 1/3 cup of sugar instead of 1/4 cup to balance with the vinegar. Next time I might not use the full amount of cloves; to me its very close to being too strong for this recipe. This was not difficult to make, especially if you have a good food processor.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I doubled the recipe so I could use a whole head of cabbage.  I also added an apple and used honey instead of sugar.  This made a great twist on a reuben sandwich.  I put it on good bread with roast beef and swiss.  grilled it up and enjoyed.  Lots of flavor and good texture.  It can be frozen so I have no problem with making a large recipe.

Spot on!  The sweet-sour taste may not appeal to everyone, but this tastes exactly as it should.  The only change I made was to use the same amount of sugar as vinegar because I prefer a little less sour.  This is a very easy way to cook cabbage.

I made this according to the directions, but used green cabbage instead of red.  I really liked it!  My family liked it too, but not as much as I did.  I served it with a german themed meal.

Wonderful! I added just a tad more butter, along with 4 whole cloves (instead of the ground cloves) and simmered for 2 hours. Leftovers were even better the next day. Authentic recipe, and totally delicious!

Very good!  Added about 1 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of the apples and added venison kielbasa. Put it all in a crockpot and cooked on low for 6-7 hours. It was excellent!  Surprisingly my 17 year old son thought it was a little too sweet so may try half the sugar next time.

I love this traditional German dish and the recipe is so easy. As a variation I substitute balsamic vinegar, skip the apple and add a tablespoon of spicy brown mustard.

I had cabbage that needed to be used up so I thought I would give this a try. I used what I had on hand. I had regular cabbage so I added a package of harvard beets (sweet and sour cooked beets) that I had made earlier in the season. I made this in the slow cooker, threw my beets in frozen, and layered the cabbage and apples on top. Didn`t measure, just put in enough to fill it. Added one sliced onion too. I used brown sugar because that`s what I had, and regular vinegar. Sprinkled with a good generous pinch of salt, added a couple of spoonfuls of butter on top and sprinkled with black pepper and cloves. Cooked this on high about 3.5 hours. Was really good, nice and tangy! Thanks for the idea!

I made this for our annual Beer Brats and 'Shoes party. Excellent! I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used 1/3 cup of applesauce instead of the apples. Also used 5 whole cloves. Worked just fine. This is a keeper!

This recipe is just perfect. I will NEVER eat red cabbage from a jar again! It is easy to make and so very delicious. The only thing I would do different is cut the apples in quarters and when the cabbage is done remove apples. Thanks so much for sharing!!

This was good, but my family felt the cloves were overpowering. As in other comments, maybe some onion would make it work, or the complete elimination of the cloves. Served with pork loin chops and mashed potatoes. I may make this again, but with changes...

I have been trying for years to get just the right taste for the red cabbage. This is it. Now I don't have to go to a German Restaurant when I get hungry for a Bavarian meal.

Great recipe.  I have always loved German Red Cabbage, but just didn't realize how simple it is to make.  I added cinnamon to mine, as well, and really liked what it added.  Delicious!

thank you so much for this awesome recipe, I did add 1 onion to the recipe but followed the rest to a t. My whole family loved it (and I do have 2 very picky eaters), and it was a hit. I will make this again and again.

This is like the Red cabbage I had in Germany. My husband loved it and it will be a family favorite from now on. I also put in the whole cloves and it was wonderful.

Absolutely loved this recipe.  We were at friends for dinner and they prepared this recipe.  I just had to have it, so she directed me to this site.  Thank you for sharing - this will become a family favorite for us as well.

Very good dish. My husband and I loved it; kids didn't even want to try it, unfortunately. I think I cooked it too long though. Was a little mushy and I would have preferred it a little crisper. Will watch my cooking temp and time next time.

I got a red cabbage in my produce delivery last week and wondered what I was going to do with it.  So thrilled I came across this recipe.  What a winner!  It was an AMAZING fall recipe.  I made it exactly as the recipe said and served it with a roasted pork loin and it paired beautifully.  My 3 kids and husband all loved it.

I used less salt and next time I would use less sugar--it was a little too sweet for me.  But overall, a very easy, tasty recipe that I would recommend to others.

Outstanding, better than the restaurant fare. Husband and I ate almost all of it. Made just as described, with just cutting back on the vinegar, sugar and spices a bit, figured I could add more at end it need be. It was a small head of cabbage though.

Never having German Red Cabbage I decided to give it a try since I was doing a German themed dinner.  I don't think I'll be making it again but I'm sure it's just my taste buds and not the recipe.
