We made a bigger batch. Larger potatoes were cut up, but they got a little mushy. The crab we had was cooked, cleaned, halved and frozen until we needed it. Threw it in at the end just to thaw and heat through. Corn was added  about 15 minutes before the crab. Yummy!  We also added lots of garlic to the pot and had garlic butter on the side to dunk crab or drizzle over plate.

We made this dish using whole baby red potatoes, corn on the Cobb, and andouille sausage. I have never cooked and cleaned my own crab, or made a crab boil and this came out great. That is my pick of the crab boil. It was pretty easy to prepare, just make sure you have a big enough pot.

My family raved about this.  It was so delicious.  My 30 year old daughter said it was probably the best meal I ever made and she has eaten a lot of my food over the years.  The only changes I made was I used smoked sausage and I added shrimp.  My family kept thanking me for making it.

It came out better than I thought and it was my 1st time. The only thing is, is that the seasoning starts to dissolve and it boils. So you have to season it more when you're ready to eat it.

I added a cup of butter and garlic when boiling potatoes and corn. Then I made garlic butter to dip the crab in.

I used snow crab legs and added shrimp and scallops.  It turned out great.
