When I made this recipe, I used "soured" milk (lemon juice added to milk to make it seem like I used buttermilk) and I used all butter instead of butter/olive oil. These turned out so beautifully, they puffed up nicely in the waffle iron and when you ate them, they were tender, fluffy and just WONDERFUL. I served these with extra butter and homemade maple-vanilla syrup. The family loved them. This recipe's a keeper.

very good, flavorful waffles. I doubled the recipe & froze the remainder. i gave 4 stars instead of 5 due to the cooking time needing to be about 10 minutes to get them beyond the soft stage. very yummy recipe and I will be making them again.

Excellent! I used all purpose flour and subbed ground oats for the wheat germ. Nice crisp/tender texture and great flavor. We had these with whipped cream, maple syrup and toasted chopped pecans. Yum. Thanks for the recipe!

5 stars without a doubt. These are very good. There is a lot of moisture in the batter, so they continue to emit steam even when ready to come off the waffle maker, which requires gently lifting  the lid to test whether they will come out or need more time. Mine take considerably longer than the suggested time. I have made them as written, but now I do it with a few tweaks. As written, they are perfect, but to keep things simple, I use all olive oil and two whole eggs. I also like to use buttermilk. Tender crisp and full of delicious flavor. We leave out the nuts and serve with whipped cream and syrup. Heaven!

These are most excellent!  Perfect for a fall Saturday morning.  I did make a few changes - replaced half of the flour with all-purpose flour, used all canola oil instead of butter and olive oil, and 2 whole eggs.  Instead of adding the applesauce, I just added another 1/2 cup pumpkin (using 1 cup pumpkin total and giving it more pumpkin oomph!).  Loved the flavor and texture inside, but they didn't turn out very crisp on the outside (no doubt because of my changes, so I'm not faulting the recipe for that!).  I enjoyed mine with whipped cream and a sprinkling of nutmeg, while hubby loved maple syrup on his.  Just a note: to avoid an aftertaste with your waffles and pancakes, use an aluminum-free baking powder.

Oh My Goodness, these are amazing! How nice to have something for breakfast that packs in a ton of nutrition. I made this using the white whole wheat flour and my family didn't seem to be able to tell that they are "whole wheat" waffles. I subbed Splenda for the sugar, didn't have applesauce so I used all pumpkin, walnuts were on hand so I used those instead of the pecans. The only thing I added was a teaspoon of vanilla into the wet ingredients. I will make these often, they are that good!

These were so good!  I also did not have wheat germ so just added more flour.  I used a white wheat flour mixture.  **tip**  You can freeze the rest of the can of pumpkin in an ice cube tray.  Once frozen pop them out and put in freezer bag.  Each frozen cube in 1/4 cup.  I put pumpkin in everything, burgers, meatloaf, soups, it is very healthy and my picky kid doesn't even notice.    My family loved these!  I had two remaining and froze them, but we ate the next morning.  Making them again this Saturday!!

Made these for breakfast this morning..they were sooo good! I used 1/2 reg flour & 1/2 whole wheat flour. Used stevia rather than sugar & added a dash of pure vanilla. My kids, who grumped until they started to smell the waffles, raved the whole time they were eating! Will certainly make again. Thanks for sharing!

Yum!  Cooked this without the wheat germ or pecans.  The cooking time was a bit off.  Just over 7 minutes worked well.

These were very very good. I made them for a brunch I was hosting and got rave reviews along with requests for the recipe. I served them along with fresh whipped cream and spiced syrup to top. They were the star of the breakfast.

The fact that this is made with whole wheat, wheat germ and is healthier caught my eye! I used buttermilk for the milk called for in the recipe. The smell of pumpkin filling up my kitchen was wonderful while the waffles were cooking. I had 8 perfect golden color waffles. Once removed to the side I noticed that the waffles did crisp up. This outside is tender crisp, inside soft and full of delicious pumpkin pie spice flavor. The pecans added great crunch and texture to the waffles. I topped these with whipped cream, more pecans and maple syrup. These are great healthy waffles and perfect for a fall morning breakfast! Thank you SuzieQ for sharing this!

These were really good. Made per the recipe but saved the nuts to put on top for those that wanted them. In addition to the nuts, we served these with real whipping cream and real maple syrup. It was a great way to use up some of the pumpkin I had left in the freezer. Thanks!

Excellent pumpkin flavor! I used a combination of white whole wheat and regular whole wheat flour. I also added buttermilk powder. We'll definitely be having these again!

Loved these! As others suggested, I added 1 t vanilla and subbed Stevia for the sugar. Used all olive oil (butter infused flavor) instead of butter/oil. I also added 1 t lemon juice to skim milk and let it set for 5 minutes to make "buttermilk". Waffles were light, fluffy and delicious with the added bonus that they are much healthier than other recipes out there. We ate these with a side of maple flavored turkey sausage. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

The flavor is a five for sure, but these were incredibly hard to cook. They stuck to my waffle iron and even at that, took ages to cook through. If I can find out a way to keep the sticking at bay, I'd definitely make them again.

We made these minus the wheat germ and pecans b/c we didn't have them on hand.  They were DELICIOUS and creamy (for a waffle!).  Even better the next day when we took the leftovers out of the freezer and toasted them for breakfast.

Really good and fairly light with healthy ingredients.  I served this for dinner tonight with a side of brown sugar bacon.  Next time I make these I will throw in some ground flaxseed and use brown sugar instead of white! Thanks for the recipe!

no idea why, but the first batch was burned on the outside and complete dough on the inside; the second batch I tried to lower the heat setting and bake them longer...they looked good but were still complete dough. I know it isn't my waffle maker's fault because I made a different recipe and those turned out great, so something went wrong with this recipe!

These waffles were quite good.  I didn't have any wheat germ so I used oatmeal instead and that turned out quite well.  These tasted very good and I was impressed with the healthy ingredients.  The waffles were a little heavier than I'm used to but I'll make them again.  I might use 1/2 white four 1/2 whole wheat though.

Great, healthy waffles.  They are not crispy right off of the iron, but after sitting for a minute, they crisp right up.  I served these with whipped cream and the cinnamon syrup from this site.  They were gone in minutes.

My husband loved these as it's hard to find waffles with some texture, I did have to cook them longer as well.  I served them with the apple cider syrup that's on another pumpkin waffle recipe, turned out excellent.

this is a great, healthy recipe. I usually add ground flax seed and don't add the butter, and they taste great. I freeze them so my 6yr old son can have a healthy breakfast before school. Great recipe!

Perfect fall breakfast!
I like brown sugar, so I changed the white sugar to 1/4 cup dark brown sugar.  I like the spices so I rounded the teaspoon of cinnamon and also added a dash of ground cloves.  I didn't want to waist part of the egg so I used 2 whole eggs.  Theses were delicious served with Maple syrup.  
Next time I think I will add a couple of Tbsp. ground flaxseed for extra nutrition.

When I made these, I left out the pumpkin pie spice (I am not a fan of it) and added some extra cinnamon instead.  I also had slightly less applesauce than needed, so I used more pumpkin in it's place.  We enjoyed these with honey butter (using a recipe from this site) and maple syrup.  Mine did not need very long to cook; I have a Belgian waffle maker and I cooked them 1 min 15 seconds per side.

Excellent flavor! My family loved them. The only small problem was that they were very, very soft.  I put them in the oven to crisp up before serving.

My absolute favorite waffle recipe, my daughter and I eat them all the time. I 4 times the recipe, which makes about 3 dozen with my waffle iron, then freeze them and reheat in the toaster for a quick easy breakfast. I follow the recipe exactly and they have come out perfect and delicious every time.

Super yummy! I even had to make some subs since I was out of wheat germ (used hemp seed) and threw in a banana instead of the sugar. The kids raved, and the hubby was impressed. Great flavor, thanks so much!

These tasted great though took a while to crisp up.  You definitely have to be patient when cooking them.  I left out the wheat germ and pecans since I didn't have them but the waffles were still delicious!

I had a hard time getting these to be a firm waffle-like crunch/soft texture. They were mostly floppy. They tasted fine, but my kids weren't over excited to eat them, which is surprising. I'd like to have more pumpkin in them too.

We really enjoyed these waffles. I did the following changes: used rice milk, homemade pumpkin puree for the applesauce, walnuts, stevia for sugar. I've doubled the recipe and used 3 whole eggs.

I made these for my 17 month old who is cutting teeth and running a fever.  He won't eat a thing but actually took a couple bites of these!  I ate the rest and they are DELICIOUS!!!  I ran short on whole wheat and had to use a little all purpose flour.  Other than that stuck to the recipe and it was great!  Thanks!

Love all the healthy ingredients in this recipe.  I used pureed sweet potato instead of pumpkin because that's what I had on hand.  They had a nice spice flavor and light texture.  I hope to make again soon.

Held up well to modifications. I lightened it slightly by using white whole wheat flour, but added 1/4 cup golden flax meal. Then I subbed in splenda brown for the white sugar, just a few grinds of fresh nutmeg for the 1/2 tsp, added another 1/2 c. of pumpkin puree because I had no applesauce in the house, 2 whole eggs instead of 1 egg and 1 white and used 5 Tbsp of best blend oil instead of half butter and half olive oil. I had to add extra milk, but my dry ingredients are super dry because of the climate here. Anyway, the waffles were delicious and filling.

yummy!  Doubled the recipe & substituted brown sugar for the white and used half whole wheat flour, half white flour.  Used two whole eggs as well.  I didn't have any plain applesauce, so I used some peach applesauce I had instead.  Left out the nuts, as my kids don't like them.  They didn't get very crispy on the outside, which made it hard to get them out of the waffle iron, but next time I'll just leave them to cook a bit longer.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good recipe, kind of a funny after taste from just the waffle itself, but syrup solves all things!! :-) Being made w/ wheat flour it took a very long time for my waffles to cook, therefore I don't think I will make them again.  However it was a good use of left over pumpkin puree.

The pumpkin flavor was lacking for me. I followed the recipe to the T besides substituting 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and a 1/2 cup all purpose flour instead of the 1 cup whole wheat flour. I also left out the nuts and added it as a topping for those who wanted. Still good, but I might try another recipe where the pumpkin flavor is more evident.

Perfect pumpkin waffles! Used olive oil in place of butter,  cooked in normal time. VERY delicious. I did use WW flour for the  wheat germ as I grind my own wheat. And used pumpkin in place of applesauce. Sure the original would be delicious, but hungry for big taste of pumpkin...this did it.

I will NEVER make these again!!!  The only positive thing I have to say is that the flavor is yummy.  I ate mine without syrup because it wasn't needed.  Now the downside.  They are soft and gooey and fell apart in the waffle maker.  Soft and gooey is good in the center of a cookie, NOT in an entire waffle.  I started cooking them longer and longer (up to 10 min.) to try to get the waffles to actually cook.  The ones that stayed in long enough to have a "waffle-like texture" tasted slightly burnt.  With my family of 3, having one waffle ready every 10 min. is not realistic.  Since each person gets every third waffle, it is ridiculous to require the third person (usually me, as the mom) to wait half an hour just to have my first waffle.  In addition to the RIDICULOUS cooking time, there are so many ingredients that it took a LONG time to measure and mix all of the ingredients.  I am a pregnant lady with a toddler.  I just do not have time for this type of recipe.

These tasted fantastic, even if they weren't light, fluffy and crispy like a traditional, 'un-healthier' waffle.  They were denser and floppier, but very flavorful.  I replaced the applesauce with extra pumpkin, and my kids really enjoyed them.  Keeper recipe!

These waffles were really good. I used two whole eggs. quick cooking oats instead of wheat germ, all purpose flour, and 1/2 cup pumpkin instead of applesauce. It's what I had on hand. I also added some additional sprinkles of spices and left out the pecans for the kids. We topped it with spiced glaze. Yummy!

I just served these for dinner tonight... Oh WOW!!  I love a recipe that I can do substitutions with, and it still turn out.  I subbed white whole wheat flour for the whole wheat and whole wheat flour for the wheat germ.  I knew the family would not eat it the other way.  I also subbed brown for the white sugar.  I made a double batch but only used one amount of the sugar.  It really doesn't need the sugar if you serve with syrup.  When I make again, I will maybe put in 1 Tbsp.  I also went with a whole egg instead of the egg white... I don't like waste!  Lastly, I used walnut oil.  And since I had homemade pumpkin puree and applesauce, I had to cut down on the milk some since they are runnier.  So yummy!  Thank you!

I was leary of the healthy twists in this recipe, but gosh they are good! I omitted the nuts (nut allergic child) and nutmeg.  I did not have wheat germ, so I ground up oats instead.  I made a second batch with bananas instead of pumpkin - those were great, too.

Yum! Very good. I did change it just a tad. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 AP flour since I was low and I also cut out the wheat germ and added oats that I ran through the food processor, also I used 2 whole eggs. Served with some fried apples that I made.

Three and a half stars. I halved the recipe, thinking I'd get four waffles, but I got three. Also - I just couldn't get the outsides crispy. They tasted fine, but texture-wise they were lacking, hence the less than perfect review. Served them with cool whip, roasted pecan syrup and toasted chopped pecans.

I followed what another person recommended and increased the pumpkin to one cup. I skipped the butter, olive oil and applesauce. I used two eggs rather than one egg and one egg white. I didn't use baking powder and substituted 1 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp salt. The waffles cooked in about 5 minutes and I didn't have any trouble with excess moisture. These came out great and I will definitely make them again.

Substantial cake-like waffles with a good flavor. I substituted flaxseed meal for wheatgerm, (which I didn't have), and made up pumpkin pie spices from ground cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. These waffles provided a great basis for a delicious Sunday brunch, with cottage cheese, fresh fruit, maple syrup and pork sausages.

Used canola oil instead of butter and olive oil and buttered the waffle iron.  The texture wasn't great, too soft. Cooked one to almost burnt and it still wasn't crispy. They smelled good, but need more flavor.

WOW, exceeded expectations!  Followed directions, but used fresh nutmeg, They are very moist, so I flipped them over in the waffle maker, watched them then pulled them out when brown all over. Next time I will up the spices, but not nutmeg. That's perfect! Taste like something out of Hansel and Gretel's Grandmother's house. YUM YUM

Made these for my husband and son because I'm gluten free. My hubby said they were very good! The only thing he said was it should have more pumpkin in. I might omit the apple sauce and do all pumpkin next time. Still a keeper though!

Really good!  Didn't have any whole wheat flour - had to use all-purpose flour.  Could double the recipes, only made 2 full waffles.  We also added whipped topping - kids loved it!

These were super easy to make and very delicious.  I used white flour because I didn't have wheat and I use soured milk and no applesauce.

This came out delicious.  I did not have any wheat germ, so I subbed Bob's Red Mill 7 grain hot cereal because no one likes to eat it as hot cereal.    I can see how others said it takes longer to cook because mine came out a little soft, but that's fine with me.  I like this recipe because you can really taste the spices, which makes it a nice change from a plain waffle.

I made these fairly close to the direction.  I was a little short on applesauce, so I made up the volume with a bit of extra pumpkin. I also skipped the pecans because my husband isn't a fan.  My family thought they were delicious.  They were actually so soft and moist that at first I thought I wasn't letting them cook long enough.  This type if recipe is perfect for my 3 year old to help with as well, so we will definitely make this one again.

The whole family loved it!  I used wheat bran instead of wheat germ (didn't have any) and they were incredible!  I didn't find them hard to cook at all.  I also lightly toasted the pecans before stirring them in.  Definitely a keeper!

I just made this for dinner after a very busy day and it was AMAZING!!!! We had it with buttermilk syrup which really took this waffle over the top. Soooooo good!! I didn't realize there were so many ingredients, so I tripled the recipe haha, which was a very bad idea because it made a TON of waffles, however I used an entire (smaller) can of pumpkin so there was no waste and I'll be able to freeze the leftovers for later.

Batter was VERY thick. They were heavy and didn't cook through without a bit too much browning on the outside. However, they are packed with goodness and tasted wonderful.

yes and it's very good.  I substituted almond flour for the wheat germ and it's still really good :-) also think that almonds could be used in place of pecans as well.

Holy deliciousness! These taste amazing. I just ate mine plain-no syrup or PB needed here. :) 

I made as written, but without pecans b/c we didn't have any and will definitely make again. My waffle maker only made five waffles, however. They did take longer to cook than your average waffle batter and were a bit funny coming off. They didn't stick so much as just were a bit soft. Hard to explain. Not a problem though because the taste is just so good!

Also, I put the recipe into calorie counter (without pecans) and it came out to 312 kcals/serving. Not sure what the difference is with nutritional info here. :/

I think I'll try replacing the eggs with banana next time for a different flavor and a healthier option. I also might try coconut oil in place of butter/olive oil.

These waffles are quite tasty.  The recipe needs to be clear they are a Belgian waffle rather than the thinner, crisper variety.  Do not bother making them if you want crisp waffles. These were lighter and fluffier. They do require longer cooking times, so I was glad I had a family size waffle iron.  They were a bit chewy but my family enjoyed them. I didn't serve with syrup as they are sweet enough. The flavor is reminiscent of gingerbread as is the texture. I would make these again with the addition of fresh whipped cream for a real treat.

Very good!  I added some vanilla and a pinch of ground clove.  Make sure to cook them until they are browned, otherwise they're too doughy.

Doubled the recipe, subbed 1/2 c. golden flax meal for the butter, and lowfat buttermilk for the milk.  I used a Waring Pro belgian waffle iron set on 6 (about 6-7 minutes) and these were the picture of perfection.  Had 10 partial waffles (feeding kids so I don't bother to fill the iron to the edges) so enough to freeze. Crisp on the outside, tender on the inside, and delicious!

These waffles are wonderful! The only change I made was to substitute flax seed for the butter and quick oats for the pecans. My two-year old gobbled this up! Thanks!
