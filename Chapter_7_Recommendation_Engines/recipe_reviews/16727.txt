I have made potato salad like this all my 50 years of cooking as my mother and grandmother before me.  Must be a southern recipe only. I add just about l tblsp. cider vinegar and a tblspn of sugar when mixing.  Seems to improve the flavor.  Garnish top with sliced boiled eggs sprinkled with paparika.  All the northerners in my family request this dish for all family get to gathers.

Everyone has their preferences when it comes to potato salad...no celery...no eggs..extra pickles...warm..cold...etc.  However - this is the basic recipe for a true Southern potato salad.  Now I'll admit - I like it cold - not warm - that's just the way my family always ate it.  Also - my Granny always tossed her potatoes with white vinegar right after they came out of the pot and drained (about 2 TBSP for each 2 Pounds of potatoes).  Then waited for the potatoes to get just warm and tossed them with the dressing.  I just don't think you can replace that soaked in vinegar flavor with ANY dressing and I love it that way.  Also - unless you like "mashed potato" salad - ALWAYS mix everything but the potatoes in a separate bowl and then GENTLY FOLD it into the vinegar coated potatoes while they are warm.  Seve it warm - or let it sit in the fridge overnight - YOUR CHOICE.  Omit anything from this recipe that you DON't like in your potato salad - but the portions of all the ingredients are right on!!!

I followed the advice in the review by Retired Cook.  Gotta listen to a lady who's been making southern potato salad for 50 years!  I used Yukon Gold potatoes for their buttery, creamy texture.  We like our potato salad chilled so I boiled the potatoes, skin on and then refrigerated them overnight.  The skin peels off easily after chilled.  The next day I put it all together.  I like to make my dressing in a separate bowl so it gets really combined before pouring it over the potatoes and celery.  I added about 2 Tbsp. minced onion, a scant 1 Tbsp. cider vinegar and about 2 tsp. sugar to the dressing mixture.  Only used about 2 Tbsp. sweet relish and less mustard. It'll need a good amount of salt and pepper too. If you are concerned about fat you can replace about half of the mayo with reduced fat sour cream and get a really good result.  This is a winner!

I have been eating southern potato salad for sixty years and trying to perfect a recipe for at least forty. This one is it. No changes necessary. Season with salt and pepper as you will, it is the finest, home-style potato salad I have ever made. My kids, who hate onions, gobbled it down even with the red onions clearly visible. This is the only recipe I will ever use again. Wonderful.

Excellent potato salad!  I like mine served cold and I omit the relish (personal preference). I add another egg, cut the mustard in half and use a mix of lite Miracle whip and lite mayo.  Everyone has their own personal tastes when it comes to potato salads and this one is simple and a very good base to add or subtract whatever you like. Mix the dressing separately from the potatoes and eggs and then toss and you can't go wrong.

Made this last night - It was the best! What a great recipe - easy to make and add too. I followed the recipe except I doubled everything except the eggs, only used 6 eggs, added 2T. finly chopped onions, and about a 1T of  dried dill- I also used peeled baking potatoes, boiled them till firm but knife went through, drained them, cut them in half, let them cool for a min, Then cut them in fairly good chunks, added the potatoes to the other things, lightly tossed and put in the freezer for 10 mins or so to chill the potatoes so they would not get mushy or break up. 
SIMPLY DELIGHTFUL - my family raved over it! 
Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Pretty good - the first time I made it, it tasted perfect but I did not cook the potatoes long enough. I made another batch and cut the potatoes in half before boiling them, this time they got done but I think I used too much mustard. I was able to cut the taste a bit by adding a little sugar. A previous reviewer asked what size potatoes to use - I used a little less than 2.5 LBS (about 38 oz) and AA Large eggs. Another tip is to cool the potatoes before you cut them up or it will be mushy. Next time I will cut the mustard to 1 or 1.5 TBSpoons.

Very good! I peeled and cubed potatoes and nuked them in the microwave (put in a plastic bowl, covered potatoes with water, covered 3/4 of bowl with plastic wrap and set for 10 minutes, took out and drained in colander) instead of boiling. I used garlic powder and was very generous with the salt and pepper. I chopped one dill pickle as I was out of relish. This tastes even better after the flavors have a chance to meld together in the fridge. Thank you for taking the time to share with us Bobbye!

Great recipe!  I'm sure it would have been great just following it as it is, but I made some alterations and it turned out wonderful too.  I left the skin on the potatoes...healthy & yummy.  I added seasoned salt instead of salt and just dijon mustard instead of regular mustard and added an onion.  I reduced the eggs by one.  All yummy!

Being my first potato salad, I managed this recipe by guessing four potatoes worth but don't think I got it right. The recipe could be improved by giving the potato amount by weight and what type of potatoes to use as well as course, medium or fine dice. Also, specify what size eggs to use as well. I  realize the recipe is flexible, but I'm new at it and a solid recipe to start from would be appreciated.

This is definitely going to be my go-to recipe for potato salad now; however, there are a few details that keep me from giving it five stars.  For one thing, I took Retired Cook's advice and added a tablespoon each of cider vinegar and sugar, and I think that was a great addition.  (I also used light mayonnaise to make the salad healthier, but I doubt that made it taste better.)  My other quibble with this recipe is the instructions about the potatoes.  It doesn't specify which kind of potatoes to use, so I used Russet because they're kind of the standard.  I think it would have been better with Yukon Gold or red potatoes that would hold up better to chopping and stirring. I wanted to leave the skin on the potatoes, but it tended to flake off as I was chopping them.  I think using a different kind of potato would help with that.  Also, since potatoes vary hugely in size, a weight guide would have been helpful.  I used 2.3 pounds of potatoes total, and it worked pretty well, although I might cut that to 2 pounds next time.  I plan to chop the potatoes before cooking so they don't take as long to get tender (it took about 25 minutes this time).  I'll also mix all the other ingredients together before I add the potatoes.  This salad is great warm or cold, but I have a slight preference for warm.
UPDATE: I have made this many times since my original review.  I almost always use Russet potatoes, but I chop them before cooking.

I'm giving this one 4 stars instead of 5 only because of a few changes I had to make. However, overall this is a great starter or base recipe for potato salad. You just need to "tweak" it to your personal preference. Okay, here's what you need to do to make this dish "wonderful" rather than just "so- so"....
Cut the 1/4 cup relish to 2 Tbsp., cut the mustard in half (1 Tbsp. is plenty), add some minced onion, some celery seed, a splash of cider vinegar and a few pinches of sugar. Also, you should double up on the dressing for your potatoes. I didn't do that this time and it didn't come out as creamy as I'd like; it was a bit dry. However, the flavor was fantastic. Use this recipe, but adjust the ingredients as suggested.

This is wonderful! My grandmother taught me to make potato salad like this when I was just a young girl. Like most southern cooks, we add a pinch of this and a dash of that from time to time according to our liking. Sometimes I will add a bit of sugar, sometimes vinegar, at times I have even added diced green pepper or pimentos, whatever suits my mood at the time! But I always add onions because I love them so much! For pretty presentation, a few sliced boiled eggs on top and a sprinkling of paprika looks nice. Also, I LOVE my potato salad warm, but most people I know actually like it better cold. I know some people that won't even touch a potato salad until it has chilled a bit. Although it can taste even better the next day, I just can't help digging in while it is still warm!

This was the first potato salad i ever attempted making and it turned out amazing.   Instead of dicing the potatos after cooking them i did it prior and it making cooking and chopping them so much easier.  I also used a little less mayo and more mustard(my choice was dijon) and a little splash of apple cider vinager. I mixed all of these in a seperate bowl with the relish,salt and pepper before mixing it into the potato,egg and celery.  This is definitly one i would serve cold and not warm and let it sit over night.  GREAT RECIPE!!!!!!!

This is the same recipe my grandmother, mother, ny sister and I have made starting in the 1920's.  It is the only potato salad our family will eat.  None of ever lived further south than Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Good food, made well and simply, knows no geography.  I also grew up drinking Sweet Tea.

This was my first experience with making potato salad and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I omitted the celery, used dill relish (BF preference) and peeled the potatoes prior to dicing.  I mostly added everything else to taste and I must admit it was wonderful and so inexpensive to make at home with staple pantry items.

This was the first time i've ever made potatoe salad. I thought it was really good. The true test was with my husband, cause his mom makes an egg-cellent (pardon the pun) potatoe salad. He really liked it though. My one suggestion for an add in is black or green olives depending on your taste.

Good recipe. We don't care for celery so I left that out. It was delicious served warm and as cold leftovers the next day. Will definitely be making this classic recipe again.

This was pretty good, but it was too mustardy for me.  This was the first time I've made potatoe salad, so it wasn't disasterous!  This would be great for those who love mustard!

One of my husbands favorite foods os potato salad.  This is very close to the ingredients that I use, but I don't have an actual recipe. There is one thing that I do add and that is some green peas.  Frozen (partly cooked) or canned.  I'll also add some chopped red or yellow pepper.  Tastes great and adds some more color.  This is a dish that I really enjoy making and it goes quickly at a pot luck...enjoy!!!

Best potato salad I ever made and the tip about sprinkling with vinegar made it fabulously tangy, just the way I like it.

I decided to make this as soon as I read the recipe. I wanted to experiment before I made it for the 4th of July picnic. I will say it is by far, the best potato salad that I have ever had. I added 1/2 of an onion, because I use onions in almost everything I cook. I also added a tablespoon of sugar, celery seed and a little salt and pepper. This recipe is perfect, and I will use it all the time. Thanks. :)

this was very good.  However, I did not put the sweet relish in just because I don't like sweet relish.  Also, I used a Dijon mustard instead of regular mustard.  Very tasty.  Would be good with onions and bacon as well.

This is exactly how I make it and how my mother made it too! Always reminds me of summer in Oklahoma as a child. The only difference is we serve it cold and add an onion.

Excellent easy recipe. Instead of sweet relish, I chopped up some crisp bread-n-butter pickles and added a little finely chopped fresh dill, plus added a little extra mustard for more zing. I like the fact that I didn't have to use as much mayo as regular potato salads thanks to all the other flavors. The family loved this recipe. Thanks Bobbye.

Perfect and easy.  I put all the condments, spices, and garlic in a bowl and mixed them first and added the potatos last. Make the night before for the best flavor.

Finally a delicious potato salad recipe that I can't screw up! I've always had issues with cooking the potatoes to perfection but this recipe eliminated that. I prepared just as directed but added 1 tsp. vinegar, some grated carrots and finely chopped red onion (personal preference). It was delicious! The whole family gobbled it up!  Thanks so much for sharing Songlady!

Very Good. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the mustard was to much for my for me.  I think 1 tablespoon will do.

I followed the advice of a few other reviewers and added the sugar/vinegar combo and it was a-MAY-zingly good! I left out the celery and added a few extra dashes of paprika before serving for some extra "color" and it was perfection!

I made this last night, and my husband and I both loved it! It was awesome made as-written, but I added a little bit of dill after tasting the original recipe for rating purposes. As-written it had great flavor... my family simply prefers some dill in their potato salad.  :-0

very good recipe!  I have made it twice in the last 2 weeks.  The first time, I made it as directed, and following the reviews of including a sprinkle of vinegar and 2 Tablespoons of sugar-- thought it was too sweet.  The second time, I used the vinegar trick and only 1/2 of the sweet relish called for and thought it wasn't sweet enough!

I followed the recipe mostly just as it was.  The only thing I had to do was add some sugar because I did not have enough of the relish.  My family loved it!  And my family has been used to my mother's potato salad for years, but they have already requested this version for our next gathering :-)  Also, I cut the potatoes prior to cooking them.  This may reduce the needed cooking time if you are in a rush (as I was).

It's great "as is" but over the last 2 years I've played with other ingredients as I do with every other potato salad.  Or any salad for that matter.  Adding bacon, red onion and spinach!  Talk about delicious!  A splash of vinegar is good too.  Never a complaint.

This was good....but not my favorite. I found it to be too mustardy like some of the other reviewers and a little bit too sweet as well.  I think I might tinker with this one a bit to see if I can get the measurements right for us...Thank you for the post.

I personally rather have potato salad cooled instead, but this was easy and delicous!  It would taste good with a little bit of paprika in it too.

Mmmmm...I'm from southern Louisiana, and this was just like my daddy's!  (and I don't give that compliment out too often)  I used two stalks of celery and chopped them in a food processor.  Also, I forgot about the salt I put in the boiling water for the potatoes, and stubbed my toe on the cajun seasoning (in place of "salt and pepper to taste") as a result.  Eh well...a night in the fridge and that problem was solved!  Yum!!

This was great! I added some apple cider vinegar, dill, and forgot the garlic. I used 6 small potatoes, which was just about 2 pounds. I think the recipe should specify that but it's okay. I boiled my potatoes for 15 minutes, drained them and left them in the colander with a clean rag over them to let them continue to cook while I made the dressing. I did not peel them because I like the added texture of the peel left on.  I always like to dress my potato salad while it is still warm so the potatoes can absorb the dressing. I also added some extra salt and pepper since potatoes can usually handle a lot of seasoning. This turned out fantastic! Thanks for posting!

This is the best potato salad I've made in years.  Maybe it has been too long since I've had home made potato salad, but it took me back.  The best compliment I got was when my girlfriend said it tasted just like her grandmother's potato salad.  I'm pretty new to cooking so got behind while I was trying to peel the potatoes/eggs and cook my main dish at the same time.  Lesson learned, prep first and it'll be smooth sailing.  Also, I think you have to use Duke's mayo.  Everyone I've talked to from the South says that's what they use.

Thanks for posting a really good potato salad recipe thas not all messed up with a bunch of wierd stuff like olives, ranch dressing, dill weed or 55 eggs ect. I would recommend reduceing the mustard significantly, adding a little chopped green pepper, a splash of vinegar & a sprinkle of sugar.

This is truely a great recipe! I make it all the time and its always requested by my friends for bbq's. The only thing that i do extra is i add 2 tbsp. of cider vinegar and a 1tbsp. extra of mayo with a 1/2 tbsp of dry mustard or regular mustard. It melts in my mouth everytime.

This recipie for southern Potato salad.  This is similar to my mom's recipie that is from south caroline.  I have one tip to add that will take this recipie to the top.    Add Gordon"s spicy mustard instead of regular.  I did this and on of my friends aske me about the potato salad every time he see's me.  TRUST ME!!

Mmmm.  Quite good!  Tastes good warm or cold the next day.  I used sour cream for part of the mayo to cut down on the mayo taste and it worked out great.   Eyeballed the ingredients and tasted it before mixing it up with the potato and eggs.  Left out the celery as my celery in the crisper was not very crisp.

i really liked this. i like a good amount of dressing with my potato salad so i may make a recipe and a half of dressing next time.
it is great warm. i liked the combo of sweet relish and garlic.
this is a great recipe to adjust as i feel for the occasion; some dijon mustard- some cucumbers- add some onions instead of garlic- whatever the mood strikes me to do.
this is a keeper!

I really liked this recipe! This is the closest thing to the potato salad my mother used to make as it comes! The only difference was that I liked it served completely chilled, so I make it the night before I plan to have it. Also, I add in a little bit of onion minced up! Great recipe!!

In all my years (I'm a senior citizen) I have never even heard of serving warm potato salad.  Maybe because all my life I've lived in Florida where we like our sides cold on a warm afternoon or evening.  I enjoyed this potato salad and it tastes very similar to the 'old fashioned' recipe we enjoyed many years ago. Needless to say I prefer it cold. I added a little more mustard and a touch of vinegar which is a matter of personal taste. Thanks for the recipe.

careful to balance the flavors, I found too much relish or mustard made the whole thing taste like it. I'm not a potato salad fan in the first place.

I doubled this, used chopped garlic dills and added a little more chopped celery. I didn't have the full eight eggs when making this, so I just cooked five and used those. I also used light mayo. Good basic potato salad.

Get compliments whenever I make this.  I have doubled and tripled the recipe for large groups and I usually serve cold.  Don't add celery and I use dill relish instead of sweet but those are just personal preferences.

Just like mama used to make (almost).  Great potato salad.  I add pimientos and about 1/2 tsb. of dill weed. Occasionally if on hand will chop walnuts and add.  I top with paprika and chill at least 4 hours before serving.

loved it!  thanks for the recipe!  i said i would never make a potato salad cos it was so much work, but this was easy and so satisfying!  the only thing i changed was adding 1 tbsp cider vinegar and 1 tbsp sugar as suggested by retired cook.  with these 2 additions i liked it much better.  i did cook the potatoes in the oven for an hour and then let them cool in the fridge.  i cut them up with the skins on and loved it that way (red potatoes).  much easier too!  my husband said he didnt ever think he'd try a potatoe salad he liked, and he loved this one.  yum!

This is the only potato salad my family will eat with a few adjustments. Eating it cold is a must, no celery or garlic I add minced onion, I also use chopped sweet pickles instead of the relish. This is how my Grandmother always made it.

Excellent recipe. The only thing different I do is add a little pickle juice.

Since she's been making potato salad almost as long as I've been alive, I'll take her word for EVERYTHING.  Delicious stuff there...yummmm.  I've found that if you mix everything together while the potatoes are cooling in the fridge, then refrigerate the sauce overnight with the potatoes..the next morning it's PERFECT!!!!

A very excellent, tasty, and easy to make dish!  Only thing I did different was add a touch of sugar.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought this was great.  I used red potatoes, about two pounds.  Miracle whip instead of mayo.  A couple tablespoons finely chopped onion, 1T apple cider vinegar, 1T sugar.  Decreased mustard to 1 1/2T.  Fanstastic!

I tripled most of this recipe for our cookout today, but only doubled the eggs and mustard. Without any sweet relish, I just chopped up 6 sweet pickles. Then I added 5 finely chopped green onions, 2 tbsp of sugar, 3 tbsp of vinegar, and 1 tbsp of paprika. It turned out GREAT! I'm lucky I had enough for the cookout....I about couldn't keep my kids' hands out of it!

This is so simple but still very good.    I was afraid it would not be great because of the simplicity of the ingredients but it turned out to be some of the best potato salad I have ever had.

I made this for my dad's 65th birthday party (for 75 people)....IT WAS FABULOUS!  I must say that I am one who prefers a warm potato salad, but I served this one cold at the party and I still loved it!  Thank you so much!

Delicious!! Very easy to make. I diced potatoes before boiling to cut cooking time in half. I omitted the celery but used celery salt. Used 1 tspn. minced garlic in a jar. Added 1/2 cup of red onion and 1/8 cup of dill pickle juice along with the sweet relish. I replace 1 tblspn. of   prepared mustard with dijion mustard. tblspn of prepared mustard. I chilled for 2 hrs. I will make often.

This is the potato salad recipe I have been seeking for years. Every family gathering has a dish like this, but I have never been able to replicate it. This is PERFECT!! Crunchy, savoury, and absolutely yummy - although I chill it overnight and add sliced radishes for zip. Thanks for bringing back the memories! Definitely a keeper - in fact, there's another batch in the fridge right now. :-)

Very good. Did not put in the celery(DH does not like it). Was my first attempt at potato salad, and I cooked the potatoes a little too long. Other than that, I'd say it was a sucess.

Excellent, simple, and easy! Tastes like a mustard potato salad which I love. I only used celery out of all the other ingredients besides mustard, mayo, salt and pepper because that's all I had. We used it for Potato Salad Sandwhiches, which there's a recipe for those also on this site but I can't seem to find it anywhere. It's basically just bread spread with mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, and a portion of the potato salad. First time I ever had one and it was yum!!

This is a wonderful potato salad recipe. My mom always made hers just like this while I was growing up. I now make it minus the celery and relish (picky kids.) Still turns out great!

This was a really good base for potato salad dressing.  I made not quite a double batch using about a cup of mayo and half cup of relish.  Also I used more celery (about 2 stalks), some very finely grated carrot (1 big one), and spicy brown mustard instead of just the regular ol' yellow stuff.  I thought it was a little bit too sweet so I added about a teaspoon of ground New Mexico chili powder and 1 finely diced Thai chili.  It turned out great.  Tried it served warm as the recipe suggested but I liked it better after it was refrigerated for a few hours as the flavors had more time to blend.

I made this over the weekend for my daughters birthday party. I used the recipe as is except for adding a few chopped scallions (I love that pepper taste they add) and garnished it with a sprinkling of paprika and parsley. It was a big hit with a group of relatively picky eaters!

This recipe was good. We always add extra mayo to any potato salad. It was much better the next day after it sat overnight.We only used 2 eggs and used half the mustard and relish and doubled the mayo.I would  make this again.

I tried this Southern Potato Salad as per the recipe given but I added 1/2 a stick of unsalted butter, just enough milk to give it the consistency of mashed potatoes, about 1 Tablespoon of French's yellow mustard and I used Kraft Miracle Whip instead of regular mayonnaise. I used real sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Garnished with paprika used sparingly (just enough for coloring) and 5 sprigs of fresh celery leaves.

Good Recipe. I omitted the celery, used garlic powder and halved the mustard. The potatoes needed more cooking time and I also cut them in half.

Although the flavor was wonderful, the eggs and potatoes were under cooked. I was specifically using the recipe for cook times and had to reboil eggs. I boiled for 5 minutes and let sit for 30 min, then cooled in cold water for easier peeling. The potatoes were very al dente and I had to rinse off dressing and boil for 15 more min.

I used about 9 russet potatoes, chopped them up into little pieces then boiled in salted water until firm. Chopped up half red onion, 2 stalks celery, one jalapeno while the potatoes were cooking. drained the potatoes, salted em again, threw in some white vinegar and the vegetables then just added mayo, dijon/ horseradish mustard, celery seed, pepper and garlic powder. oh and 5 boiled eggs. everyone like it:)

This recipe was easy and the measurements were perfect!  Would definitely make again.  I would either omit the celery or fun through the food processer.  I didn't like biting into pieces of them.

Perfect southern potato salad. I omit the garlic and add about 1/4 cup finely chopped yellow onion for my own taste.

My husband who was really unsure of warm potato salad loved this as well as myself and the kids. Simple- great hot or cold- and a classic. What more could you ask for? Love this!

This was great!  I did add more relish and mustard to my liking, but I prefer more tang in my potato salad.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

This recipe was delicious!  I did modify this recipe based upon personal preferences.  I exchanged chopped onion for the celery and used chopped bread and butter pickles instead of sweet relish.  I also added another 1/4 cup of dill pickle.

This was good, but I must say I am still searching for the best potato salad out there.  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding a little more sweet relish.

I don't usually rate recipes, but this potatoe salad is the best.  I did omit the sweet relish, as I am not big on sweet relish, I added cider vinegar, and sugar, as retired cook suggested, I also added the ingrediants while the potatoes were still warm.  I will only use this potatoe salad recipe from now on.

This was really amazing.  My husband and I really liked it the first day, but really loved it the next day.  I added bacon instead of celery.  Only added 1 tbsp. of mustard. I will make this again.

I leave out the celery and garlic, add finely chopped green onion to taste and yes, I agree. a little too much mustard for my taste as well.  You can even sub dill relish for the sweet and use even less mustard.  I also add some drained, chopped pimento to mine and instead of chopping the boiled eggs, i grate mine into anything I prepare with boiled eggs.  It seems to distribute into the dish and tastes alot better to me.

Made as listed with the addition of a little dill weed and smalllll slice of onion thinly chopped.  Was much better cold in our oppinion.  However should have been named Mustard potato salad.  I like a little mustard in mine but this was very overwhelming.  Next time I make I'll definatly reduce the mustard greatly. Also 15 minutes did not make the potatos done enough... next time Will have to cook longer.

I couldn't imagine eating it warm. Cold is definitely better. Added about a 1/4 cup of finely chopped onion really helped out the flavor.

ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!  Everybody has their own favorites to add to potato salad but this receipe has the best "base" for you to customize to your own preferences.  I left out the pickle relish and garlic.

I omitted the celery per my husband's request.  I also added about 1/2 cup chopped small sweet pickles instead of relish.  Everyone loved it...even my best friend, who is a self-proclaimed tater salad snob.  She loved it.  Kudos!

First time I have ever made potato salad for some reason.  Very good.  Much like my mom's (Southern born and raised) except she adds hard boiled eggs and onion.  She doesn't add mustard.  I made this as directed and it was delicious.  I did go back and add some diced red onion and I think I like it better that way.

Great recipe.  So flavorful.  Instead of mincing the garlic, I grated it.  I also added a scant tablespoon of cider vinegar and used red potatoes (all I had).  I will definitely make again.

Yes, yes! Oh yes! This potato salad will most likely knock your socks off.
After Retired Cook said has made this for over 50 years, I decided to adopt the tips, adding 1 tbsp cider vinegar; 1 tbsp sugar. 
I used six eggs instead of four because I like them, using the last two eggs to garnich the top of the salad with along with a sprinkling of Paprika.
I'm not a sweet relish fan and didn't have any on hand, so I subbed out a 1/4 cup relish with 1/4 c diced pickles and 1/4 c diced onion, giving the salad a more crunchy texture, which is what I was aiming for. I also added a diced fresh jalapino in the mix for spice.
One of the keys to this could be getting the proper amount of potatoes mixed in with the rest of the mixture so there is a nice even covering. Thank you!

Loved it!  Took this to a BBQ and everyone raved about how great it was.  Only thing I did was do the recipe for 9 - I added about 3/4c more mayo and didn't have any celery on hand. Will make again!

My recipe changes were: ADD BACON!

Cook bacon to a crisp and add it in to substitute the salt. It's a great addition.  I'm also not fond of sweet relish, so I substituted with dell relish and added garlic powder instead of a whole minced garlic. It's a little less obtrusive.

So for Christmas I used this recipe, I thought it was a 5 star recipe for my first time, I added minced onions and celery flakes and I omitted the garlic, only because my mom does not care for it, that was hard because I put garlic in everything. But all in all I thought it was very good and so did my family!!!

Speaking as a Southerner, y'all, this is THE BEST potato salad I ever made.  Didn't change a thing in the recipe and my family loved it, even my picky son who hates onions and garlic.

Finally I've found the perfect potato salad! This will be going in my recipe box. The only changes I made were to omit the celery and use a dash of celery salt instead, and I added some fresh chives since I had them on hand.

Having eaten my Mother's potatoe salad for years, and having made it myself for the last 30 years, my only comment is I use Miracle Whip instead of Mayonnaise. You do not need to add vinegar or sugar if you use it.

Used red potatoes with skins on. Was surprised how good it was with such few ingredients.  You can adjust the amounts of ingredients to your tasting. I like a little more mayo in mine. It's my new potato salad recipe.

An outstanding basic recipe, Bobbye. I adjusted to our personal preference with two stalks celery, 2 minced green onions, 2t white vinegar, 3 more eggs and some celery seed. We love celery and onions! Thanks for sharing.

This was great.  The only change I made was to substitute 1/4 c. chopped dill pickle for the sweet relish and add a little of the dill pickle juice.  It's addictive!  Thanks Bobbye!

I was really disappointed in this. I followed the directions exactly and the mustard flavor was so overpowering for us.  I might try it again and leave out the mustard.

This recipe is great.  I changed a few things- left out the celery and garlic, but added garlic powder and onion powder.  I also added some roasted red bell pepper and used regular dill pickles instead of sweet relish.  SOOOOO Yummy!

BAM!!  This is indeed very very tasty!  I only did one little change:  half sweet relish and half minced dill pickels.  My husband likes the sweet and I like the sour....so I improvised and what a flavor!  Thank you for this post.  It's a KEEPER!

I love this recipe.  It is SIMPLE, tastes great, and I get requests for it all the time!  I can make this salad on only a few hours notice, thats how easy it is!  I do like to marinate my potatoes in a little italian style dressing, and I also occasionally replace a portion of the mayo with sour cream.  Excellent, failproof recipe!

This is EXACTLY the potato salad recipe that i was looking for.  I read every single recipe on this web-site and chose this one.  It is simple and exactly what potato salad should taste like!  No funky ingredients but very versatile to suit individual tastes.  I didn't have celery so I added some shredded carrot, used red potatos and onions.  Any beginner could make this and still feel confident with stylizing it to fit your taste!

FABULOUS! I had a bag of potatoes that were going south, so I tried this recipe. Simply delicious. I only used two eggs, as my four potatoes were small. I added a bit of red onion because I love onion. The end result is fantastic. Thank you!

The closest I've found to my aunt's potato salad which I never got enough of. Far too much mustard however. 1 tspn is adequate for the amount of mayonaise. I never put garlic in salad. I prefer Miracle Whip dressing to mayo and like at least a third cup or more of pickle. Instead of pickle relish, I prefer chopped Mt. Olive sweet gherkins.

This was REALLY easy!  Used baby red potatoes and followed the directions except I only used 1 1/2 tsp. (Yes, teaspoon) of mustard.  It was perfect!  I did add a little onion to it for a little more flavor and crunchiness.

Having a grandmother from the south who always cooked from scratch and made the most heavenly potato salad, I've always ascribed to using mayonnaise instead of salad dressing too; but serving it cold, as mayonnaise and eggs do not last long warm in a big buffet, which is how our family always served during our family reunions.

Tasted good, but personally I would double the dressing next time. There just wasn't even close to enough for my tastes. I used average sized potatoes. Also, I did add a couple tablespoons of vinegar to the chopped potatoes after they were done cooking. I think it improved the taste. I also think closer to 20-22 minutes boiling the potatoes would be sufficient, because after only 15 minutes they were still not done all the way. Lastly I added a bit of chopped onion to the salad as well.

Followed another reviewer's suggestion and added 1 T. cider vinegar and 2 tsp sugar(I used splenda). Also added a vadelia onion. Husband deemed it very good. Will certainly make again with these adjustments

To start, our oldest son does not like potatoes in any form . . . that is until now. He loved this salad.  I made a few tweaks per some of the other comments such as adding 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to the potatoes prior to mixing with the other ingredients.  I also added 1 tablespoon of sugar and not having celery, used a 1/2 teaspoon of celery salt. This is a sure winner, and one that is now a family favorite!

This is the best potato salad I've ever made! The only changes I make are using red-skinned potatoes (leave skin on) and add a few tablespoons of finely diced onion. We prefer it cold. It's delicious!

Awesome!!!
I made this potato salad for a BBQ last weekend that my family hosted. This salad was a hit! Love, love, loved it. There were just a couple modifications that I made...I used dill relish and miracle whip light with instead. I'm sure the way that the recipe is written is great too. I just had that on hand though. This is a definite saved recipe for me!

Really tasty!  I also drizzle some vinegar over the hot potatoes and add chopped onion and pickles.  Adds a nice kick.

This is awesome potato salad. I also did the cider vinegar/sugar poured over the hot potatoes will they were draining, I used a magic bullet to mix the mayo, relish, garlic, mustard, and I added a few slices of dill pickles. Used 5 eggs, salt and pepper, yukon gold potaoes peeled and chopped before boiling, nothing else and it is so delicious!

So simple, so easy, so delicious! I just had some relish, mustard, celery, and eggs in the fridge that I wanted to just get rid of, so I made this potato salad, and it was amazing! I like to make it into a potato salad sandwich for lunch. I guess you can adjust the proportions of the ingredients as you wish. I will definitely be making some more as soon as I can

I added vinegar and sugar. Also a some onion and dill. I took this to a Christmas luncheon. It was a hit.
Thanks. This recipe is almost exactly like my great grandmother's. You were missing the vinegar and sugar.

Perfect Potato Salad. We leave out the celery. Add a little  sugar, top with sliced hard boiled eggs and let it "talk" overnight in the fridge. Nothing better than some Potato salad. We have this for every holiday of the year and it's a staple for the summer months!

I fixed this exactly as directed.  It was such a hit at the party.  There wasn't anyone that didn't take seconds or even thirds.  The next day, my family finished off the leftovers.  They can't wait for me to fix it again.  Thanks so much!

I'm not sure if I can fairly judge this recipe because I used it as more of a guideline. I added all the ingredients in the recipe, but all to taste as opposed to accurately measuring them. The end result was a beautiful classic potato salad that was MUCH better than anything you could buy at a store. It was my first time making "tater salad, and I wanted the traditional version. I'm giving it 5 stars because my end product was delicious (it was a hit at our 4th of July BBQ), and this recipe gave me the guidelines and ingredients to do so. I think that's the beauty of recipes like this, everything can be adjusted to taste. I will say that it tasted significantly better after a night in the fridge.

This was a really good base for a salad! I didn't have celery so I left it out. I mixed the mayonaise, relish, and garlic together before I added it in. I also added crumbled bacon, green onion, and fresh parsley. I sauteed some red onion in the bacon grease before I added it to the salad.

This was a nice change to my usual potato salad. I wanted to like it more than i did though. Just personal taste but as much as i like sweet relish, i didnt care for it in my potato salad. My husband liked the relish so its all about what you like.

This was an excellent recipe.  I didn't change a  thing.  It was perfect in spite of the fact that after I put in the mustard,  while the bottle was pouring the mustard,  I noticed the sell by OCT 09 date.  LOL!! I didn't know mustard spoiled.  No one had a tummy ache.

This is a very good recipe.  I grew up in Southern Alabama, and this is basically what my grandmother and mother made.  When I make it, I omit the celery and replace it with some yellow onions that I dice.  The amount of onions depends on your preference.  I eat it warm sometimes, but chill it for the outings.  Yummy!

This is so good! I only used 1 TBSP of mustard but that is just my preference. I also added the 1 TBSP of Cider Vinegar and 1 TBSP of sugar. You can't go wrong with this recipe! Try it!

Very tasty.  I made this potato salad exactly as written, except I substituted Aioli Garlic Mustard Sauce from Trader Joe's for the prepared mustard the recipe calls for.  For ease of tossing and to make sure everything gets distributed evenly, I would suggest mixing all of the ingredients except for the eggs and potatoes to form a dressing before throwing it all together.  In the future, I might try tossing the potatoes in cider vinegar first, the way some of the other reviewers suggest.  Although the dressing in this recipe is great, the potatoes themselves lacked zip.

Great recipe, good both warm and cold. I am not a big fan of mustard in recipes so I substituted french dressing for the mustard, it gives it the desired zip and nice color.

Perfect proportions! I would give this ten stars if I could. Using this recipe you can easily tweak it the way you want. I toss the potatoes with vinegar and add a little sugar to the dressing, also some dill pickle instead of relish, and I like it cold.

This recipe was very good.  I am sure that I will continue to use it.  Thank you for posting it.  I am not a relish lover but still used some and am glad that I did.  I did add 1 TBS Apple Cider Vinegar to potatoes after draining the water off of them.  
and added 1 TBSP White Sugar to mixture.
Garnished with boiled eggs and paprika.
Used 1/2 mayo 1/2 miracle whip and my family loved it.  Thanks again!

Recipe was great!  I tweaked it a bit.  I used chicken stock and some Extra Virgin Olive oil to soften up the onions.  I also added some apple cider vinegar and sugar to the mayonnaise.  Then I took about 1/3 of the potatoes and grated them.  That makes the flavor so much more rich and seemed like it went through the salad more evenly.  Next time (and there will definitely be a next time) I would add more celery!  Enjoy everyone.

This was awesome and totally hit the spot I am pregnant and I woke up craving Potato salad and wanted homemade not store bought so I logged on here and found this recipe it is so easy to make even in the middle of the night LOL. I do recommend mixing ingredients together before adding potatoes. I took the advice from couple other reviews thanks ladies and this is an A+ recipe loved it.

This recipe is awsome.The same recipe was handed down through my family and gave to me by my mamaw.But here is a suggestion i would like to make. Cube the potato's and add them to diced onions and celery,and then boil all of it in 2 cups of chicken stock. The vegetables will soak up the stock and it just makes it taste that much better.

Great recipe! The second time I made this I made these changes and it was very, very good. Mashed the potatoes, substitued celery stalks for teaspoon of celery powder and used 1/3 cup of sweet relish.

I've been making a similar version of this salad the last few years.  Since I don't like hard boiled eggs I don't use them.  In their place I use crumbed bacon and fresh herbs.  Personally, my family doesn't like warm potato sald cause we always eat in the summer time with bbq. I like to make it a day ahead of time for the flavors to blend.

I love potato salad, but I don’t like eggs. After searching grocery stores for potato salad with no eggs, I finally decided to make my own. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn’t add any eggs and it still came out great. I will definitely make this again!

This is the VERY BEST potato salad ever! In my version, I added more celery, half a green pepper chopped, and a whole bunch of scallions chopped. Following an earlier suggestion, I also added 1 TB cider vinegar and a tsp sugar. Excellent . . . and even better the next day if there is any left!

This turned out just how I'd hoped.  I substituted half the mayo for fatfree plain yogurt to make it a little healthier, and followed Retired Cook's advice.

This recipe makes a delicious salad! Hubby raves every time I make it.  The first time I made it, I didn't have celery so I used celery seed.  Still delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

5+++ stars, this is awesome!!!! I kept the recipe as is, except 1 tbsp of mustard I substituted for Horseradish mustard, I also added 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar and 1 tbsp sugar and a couple of dashs of celery seed. I used regular white potatoes (the cheap ones that come in 5 or 10 lbs bags, all different sizes) I found that I had to boil them 20 minutes then I cooled them and slid the skins of, soooo good. My husband who is so picky said this was really great

This is a delicious recipe!  I couldn't stop licking my plate.  I have tasted so many boring and plain bad potato salads, and this was a wonderful surprise.  I will keep this recipe forever!

Delicious!  I absolutely love this recipe.  I did put more eggs into it, and also sliced an egg for decoration on top.  A little paprika on top was a nice addition as well.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very easy to make.  I added a little white vinegar for tartness and garlic chives from my garden for added color and taste. I also used minced garlic from a jar vs. fresh garlic.  The only problem I had was that I diced the potatoes before I boiled them and they were too soft which caused the salad to be a little too mashed after everything was stirred together. But everyone loved it , including me.

I would have given this 4 stars, but I thought the mustard was a bit over powering and I typically like mustard based potato salad.  Next time I'll try with only 1 tablespoon or eliminate it completely.

I am sitting here eating a bowl of this fabulous potato salad.  I've been searching for just the right potato salad recipe.

This is the one!  The relish and garlic add just the right amount of punch and zing.  From here you can do all kinds of variations.  Dijon mustard, a touch of curry, different potatoes, homemade mayo...wherever your imagination leads you.  This recipe is a keeper!

I will make it again and again and again!

Thanks for the recipe!

This was not my personal favorite potato salad recipe, but everyone at the barbeque raved about it.Every party I've been to since, someone has requested that I make this amazing homemade potato salad! I added green onions and used spicy mustard rather than regular. I really think this recipe is why I keep getting invited to events!

Big hit in my house - bit too mustardy for me although I did reduce the amount I put in - added some red peppers and green onions which added some crispness....I have a pot luck coming up that I will use this recipe for....

Very delicious and easy!  I used dill pickle relish instead of sweet, and used honey mustard dressing instead of regular mustard, and (as always) looking for a way to cut the fat, used fat free miracle whip.  Made it for my mom who is the FIRST to pick out when I used something with less fat...she couldn't tell a difference at all.  Great recipe will definately use it again!

I'm not much of a potato salad fan, but feel compelled to make some for July 4th.  Found this recipe with great reviews so decided to try it.

Was very pleasantly surprised.  This is a great basic recipe that is really well balanced.  Didn't have dry mustard so used some dijon instead.

This is a good classic recipe.  I added one small onion, a dash of Lawry's salt, and celery seed instead of the diced celery.

We weren't too crazy about this one. We had to doctor it up a bit. We added onions, dill, a tsp of garlic powder, tsp. of horseradish, and 2 tsps of miracle whip. That helped it out alot, and it was much better tasting. Sorry!

Both my husband and I loved this.  We like our potato salad cold.  I left out the eggs and celery, but kept all the other ingredients.  The garlic added a great taste to the salad.  I also chop my potatos before I boil them.  They were finished within 15 minutes.  This is a keeper!

This was my first time making potato salad and it turned out great! I made a lot of mods based on reviews: I ditched celery for a Vidalia onion, I used chopped dill pickles instead of sweet relish, I substituted garlic powder for garlic, and I cut back on the mayo and mustard (and I used dijon mustard because I didn't have any yellow). Also, even though I cut the potatoes in half, I still had to boil them for longer than 15 minutes (maybe 20-25). Otherwise, it was a hit!

Made this for a family party and it was a HIT, nothing left over! Some of them said just the right amount of eggs for potato salad (I made a serving for 12). Did serve it cold, tho. I will be using this one again.

This is the best potato salad I've ever eaten!  WARNING:  the potatos do not cook all the way in 15 minutes.  Boiled whole for well over 20 minutes and they were still a bit too crunchy.  I will cut the potatos in half before boiling next time.  Didn't add celery (don't like celery).  Overall great.  Scored a four because of the cook time issue (the salad would have been a throw away had I not second guessed the instructions).  otherwise, its a 5 star.  Thanks for the great recipe.

EXCELLENT! The only thing I changed was to add a small slice of onion ('cause I like onions). I also scaled this down to 2 servings. I could have easily eaten the whole thing myself. I chopped up the celery really fine... next time I'll make the celery pieces a little bigger. I really enjoyed this one. Thanks Bobbye for posting.

Excellent! Exactly the recipe I have been looking for! We aren't big mustard potato salad fans so I only used 1 tbsp of mustard and it was perfect. I also omitted the minced garlic and just used garlic powder. I will definitely be making this again and again.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were great.  I'm the only person in the house that has had Southern Potato Salad before and it was up there with the best I've ever had.  Try it as is before modifying it.  That's my suggestion.  Cheers for that.

I’m not usually a fan of potato salad. My husband loves it, so when I made this he thought it was Christmas again! Lol I actually thought it was good also! I used the tip of letting potatoes soak in vinegar and sugar mix. Again super delicious

Because my husband is allergic to anything pickled, I left out the relish. We love garlic so I added a couple of extra cloves and also added onion powder. It's delicious and can't wait to make it for more than just us.

Really great for those who don't like onions in their potato salad. I am also not a big fan of celery, but I just chopped it up into really small pieces, but you could easily skip it too.

Definitely an easy and nice potato salad.  Added some of my own Cajun flare to it by boiling potatoes and eggs in crab boil and adding way more garlic.  Can never have enough garlic.

My husband loved this!  Perfect creamy potato salad.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes and omitted the celery because I didn’t have any.

Perview family said awesome!  My daughter licked the bowl clean I mixed it all together in! Added a splash of apple cider vinegar to the sauce, and a handful of bacon bits. Chilled the potatos. Folded sauce into potato and garlic base. No more store bought potato salad again!

Excellent potato salad! I did things differently. I peeled and chopped the potatoes before boiling them. They were ready in just over 10 min. I've made potato salad that's been flavorless, so while the potatoes were still warm, I sprinkled about a tblsp of Greek salad dressing over and let soak in. At this time, I also followed what a reviewer who knows about Southern cooking mentioned and that was adding apple cider vinegar and a little sugar. Adding the dressing and vinegar were probably what made this a little mushy, but I didn't care.....it was so delicious! I also did not miss the onions. While serving, I like to also top with some green olives or radishes. Thanks for this great recipe which I'll surely make again!

Solid recipe. A little heavy on mustard for my taste, so I might go with 1 Tbs. next time. I took a reviewer's advice  and sliced the potatoes in half for boiling, and they were perfect at 12 mins. I also took her advice to chill the potatoes so they keep their shape. This is my go-to potato salad recipe from now on.

Added some finely sliced red and green bell pepper/capsicum for colour/texture, and one small spring onion for bite. Used Dijon mustard as well.
Family was very impressed.

Amazing recipe. Didn’t have celery but didn’t really miss it either. I often use honey mustard in my potato salad but followed this recipe and was delighted the relish added enough sweetness without being heavy or goopy. I used a mixture of the two potato’s I had on hand also turned out well! I’d say this is the perfect canvas recipe if you’re trying to get funky too with your potato salad. Yummy!

Versatile and easy with ingredients you always have on hand. I loved the addition of the garlic. I didn't have relish but had some bread and butter pickles that I chopped up. Also added a splash of dill pickle juice and it just amped it up. Will definitely make again. Good cold, too!

Perfect name for this recipe! This is exactly what I was looking for in a potato salad. I had everything on hand and we couldn't stop eating it. I made the eggs a few hours before I wanted to make the potato salad to save myself some time.

My husband said that this was the best potato salad I have ever made. Like someone mentioned, I mixed everything together before I folded it in to the potatoes. I used about 2.5 pounds of russet potatoes and followed the recipe and didn't change a thing. Delicious!

Added 2-3 more potatoes and another egg, plus maybe 1.5 tsp of sugar.  This will be my go-to recipe for potato salad.  So yummy!

Tried several potato salad recipes but this one was good.  My husband loves potato salad but I could never make it until this recipe.I don't like celery so I just put some celery salt. Fried some bacon and crumbled in it which really gives it a southern flavor.  I am going to try the vinegar next.

I made a few changes to the recipe: i didn't have enough eggs in my house, so i only used 3. I also didn't use celery or relish ( the relish by choice, and the celery because again, i didn't have any in my house!) I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. When i mixed it all up it seemed kind of dry so i added a bit more mayo. Overall the flavor was very good, i'm not sure why it seemed so dry but it was better once i added more mayo.

This was alright. I've tried many potato salad recipes on here, and my all-time favorite is Kaye Lynn's World's Best Potato Salad. It is by FAR the best potato salad in the world. :) This was way too eggy for my liking. While I LOVE eggs in my potato salad, they were just a bit overkill here (like eating a big bowl of deviled eggs). This was also a tad bland and a bit too savory for my liking, even after adding a couple tablespoons of vinegar to my potatoes as suggested by another reviewer. I guess I'm a sucker for sweeter, tangier potato salads, so I guess I'll stick with those from now on. Thanks anyways, SONGLADY! :)

Doubled recipe for a crowd, using 6-8 med sized russets (peeled/cut/boiled until tender 10min).  3 stalks celery, 1/3 cup diced dill pickles, 2 Tbl diced sweet onions.  Made sauce in two batches, with mods: + 1Tbl cider vinegar scant, + 1 tsp sugar, using 1 T mustard. First batch, splash of dill pickle juice.  Mix in batch one with veggies, then fold in potatoes.  Mix in second batch of sauce, with eye on consistency. Add in chopped eggs.  Chill, keep remainder of any sauce to fold in, if salad is a little dry when time to serve.

Unfortunately, I had to throw the entire thing away because the potatoes weren't cooked enough! They were crunchy. Yuck. :-(  15 minutes just simply isn't going to cut it.  I might try making it again and boiling them for 20-25 minutes.  I think the flavor would've been good, if we'd have been able to eat it.

It's been about 4 years since I've made potato salad but my husband wanted some. I forgot how to make it so, i used this recipe. The recipe was great but I didn't use the celery cause I don't like it and I used more mayonnaise. All & all this recipe was great will be using this one again.

Very good.  I took one of the reviewer's suggestions and added vinegar (3 T) over the cooked potatoes and let it soak up.  First time I've made potato salad with no onion and I like it.

Love the flavor from the garlic & relish.  I'm not a huge egg fan, so I generally leave out the hard boiled eggs.

If you need a foolproof recipe...this is it. Made exactly as indicated, it will yield an attractive salad. (dont forget the paprika!) The taste is better than store bought. It reminds me of salad served at any given "where the locals eat" home style Southern diner. Which if that is the taste you are going for (sorta bland, non-offensive, and dry) you will love this recipe. I do not know any excellent Southern cooks who use relish in their potato salad. Onion, green pepper, and a creamy- smooth pastel yellow dressing are all I have ever eaten outside of a restaurant. I am not being harsh- I don't know how to make the "good stuff" either, which is what led me to try this recipe to begin with.

This is just the recipe I was looking for. A good potato salad needs JUST the right balance. I skip the celery & use half the eggs suggested(personal preferences). Goes great with the Parmesan Sage Pork Chops from this site. YUMMY!

It was the first time I ever made potato salad and this recipe did not let me down.  Followed it exactly.  The garllic was a nice touch.  I used red potatoes and left the skins on.  I will make this again.

Made these for the fourth of July, only rating it a four, because I just could not add a 1/4 cup of sweet relish, I thought It would be to much, so I only added a couple of tsp. (personal preference) The sauce was spot on, not runny and not to dry.  Thanks for a very nice potato salad recipe!

I did not use celery stalk and did not add garlic, it was delicious. I also mostly used egg yolk. I'm not too much of an egg white fan.

So, so delicious.  I had southern potato salad for the first time at a restaurant nearby and I couldn't figure out what was so amazing about it.  Just made it at home, estimating the ingredients since I had several pounds of potatoes to use up.  Added white vinegar to freshly drained potatoes and tossed.  Added sugar to the dressing, which I mixed with the celery, onions and eggs before folding into the potatoes.  Also, the recipe didn't call for onions, but I added them. Used garlic salt instead of whole cloves.  I had to chop dill pickles because I didn't have sweet relish.  I think the sugar made up for the lack of sweetness from sweet relish.

This potato salad is very similar to one I normally make and very good...nothing really to make it stand out above others though. I left out the relish as my family doesn't care for it. I may or may not make this again. Definitely worth a try for those who haven't done so yet.

Wonderful and easy to make potato salad recipe. I have made it twice now and followed the recipe with no changes and everyone loved it. It tasted good both served warm and straight out of the fridge a day later. I used my mother's homemade sweet relish which made it even better. It does not take 2hrs to make as it says above. It only takes about 20 minutes to whip it up.

Good Base.  I added a few dashes of Tabasco, Worcestershire, and some chopped onion.  Also, I Used Red Potatoes and they held up much better. I tossed the potatoes in about a Tablespoon of apple cidar vinegar before mixing with all the rest of the ingredients.  I served this cold...Not a fan of warm potato salad.

Very yummy. I played around with the ingredient amounts based on how things tasted to me, and I had to bake my potatoes about 10 mins longer. I added the cider vinegar and sugar as suggested by others and it came out great. Hubby says the finished version tastes better than my mom's!

My first home-made potato salad.  It was great.  I only used 3 potatoes, and there still wasn't enough dressing for my preferences.  Maybe next time I'll use 2 1/2.  And I really like eggs, so I used 5 eggs, but that wasn't enough for me so I'll add more next time.  Thanks for sharing!

Good potato salad. I needed a little more "kick" so I used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo, added a few dashes of Original Tabasco Hot Pepper Sauce and a bit of Sticky Fingers Carolina's Sweet barbque sauce. Talk about delicious! Use it to top grilled hotdogs, brats, and burgers and you have yourself a tasty dish!

I followed the recipe and it tasted very good.  I then decided to use "Retired Cooks" suggestions and added a tablespoon of vinegar, sugar and top with paprika and that made it 5 stars!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe!  I gave it 4 stars because I made a few minor changes.  I added chopped onion and chopped pimento. Also sliced the egg and placed it on top with paprika sprinkled on top because that is how my Grandmother always made hers.  Thank you! My husband will love this!

Great recipe.  I used garlic powder instead and added sugar. I'm not a fan of celery in potato salad so I did not use it.  It turned out great.

This was OK, but I think I will try to find a recipe that replaces the sweet relish. It just wasn't the right taste for me.

this is literally the best home made potato salad I've ever eaten ever. Second best potato salad to this one I got at this little grocery store once. This is super super good. I minced a dill pickle because I didn't have relish but kept everything else the same. seriously awesome! I'm impressed.

This was so delicious!  I knew it was going to be before I refrigerated it overnight (not a big fan of warm potato salad).  I only had 2 potatoes so I used 2 eggs and halved everything else.  I didn't have celery so I left it out.  I added a pinch of onion powder and pinch of salt and sprinkled paprika over top of it.  I cannot say enough.  My husband also loved it and he is really picky about potato salad!  I will definitely make this again.  I am sure it would be a hit at any potlucks/get togethers.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

This potato salad is almost perfect!! I omitted the eggs and garlic, and added a bit of vinegar and sugar. I also had to use a bit more mayo and mustard to make it creamier. Instead of cubing the potatoes, I chunked them roughly and then hand mashed them, and my family and friends LOVED it!

Very good, I changed it slightly; for one, I couldn't serve warm because I made the potatoes the day before.   I also omitted the garlic because I  worried it would be too strong so I added onion and sprinkled some cayenne on top instead of the usual paprika; we like a little spice in ours!.. Thanks!

WOW!!! We of course made a few changes but used this as a base recipe - it was the best ever. We added some chopped green onion, peppers, bacon, egg, celery and omited the relish. I used dijon mustard not yellow - it was so very good.

I have made great potato salad most of my life, but this tops the charts on southern style potato salad. I can my own relish so I used that. I can't wait until my potatoes come in so I can use those! Thanks for a great recipe!

Taste like deviled eggs. Ok, but not the southern potato salad that I am used to. Maybe I will use less eggs next time.

I made this potato salad for Christmas, and since it was my first time I followed the recipe. I did like others and mixed all the ingredients before adding to the potatoes and finished it off with paprika. Quick and Easy, great recipe.

This is the best recipe for potato salad, only adjustment I make is to add one tablespoon of liquid crab boil to he potatoes while boiling them-adds an little extra kick.

It's decent. Next time I will let the potatoes get much softer, as I'm used to more of a mashed potato salad.

This was easy to make and tasted just like the potato salad you get from the deli at the grocery store. Nice thick texture. Family liked it because it had more of a mustard flavor than mayo.

Just lovely.  Perfect, traditional potato salad.  I was craving this and it hit the spot.  Only thing I added was some onion and paprika, otherwise I thought the measurements were perfect.

My southern mother's side of the family has been making a version of this potato salad forever; and it is delicious! I LOVE the addition of the tbsp vinegar and sugar that Retired Cook suggested.  Even without it, this recipe is still wonderful!

I've been looking for the perfect southern potato recipe to match the one my great grandmother used to make when i was very young...and this is it!! As with the experienced cook, I also added the vinegar and sugar. It makes ALL the difference in the taste. I like to use a little diced onion, celery and bell pepper to equal about 1/2 cup total, but the recipe is great as is! I'll definitely be making this again!!!

It is a really great recipe. I live in the Northeast, and they seem to favor the all white potato salad, but growing up in DC, we always had it southern-style. 

I also only did half the number of eggs,and would probably do at least one less next time. I added the vinegar, which does make a difference, and a touch of sugar (although I don't think it was enough). I used dill relish instead of sweet relish, because I like things a little tart. I ended up eye-balling how much mayo to use since I was increasing the serving size up to 12. It was a little saucy than I prefer, so next time  I will measure!

I made a double batch thinking it would last two functions on the 4th of July. But the bowl was scraped at the first BBQ, I had to make another batch before the 2nd BBQ.  I tasted the first batch before adding the Vinegar and Sugar and it definitely needed it.  Will use this recipe again!

Yum!!! I have never made potato salad before, but this was easy and a big hit. I did take other reviewers advice on the vinegar. I served this cold since I needed it to be prepared in advance. Delicious! Thanks!

I loved this recipe.  Although, I have to admit that I modified it.  I really love dill relish, so I added the dill instead of the sweet.  I also used spicy brown mustard and decreased the eggs by one.  I only had three eggs.  It would have been fine with an additional egg.

The best I've ever tasted! Certainly better than the store stuff. I used whipped salad dressing (store brand Miracle Whip) instead of mayo, and put in half of the relish to compensate for the sweet and tart. I've never used either garlic or relish in mine, and it made all the differnce. I also followed her cooking method and got much firmer potatoes than my usual mush.

Oh man, this is soooo good warm or cold. I used yukon golds, only 2 eggs (all I had ready), and scallions instead of celery. I added the 1 tbsp each of cider v and sugar. this is sweet but yummy. My husband ate a whole serving straight out of the prep bowl!

Mmmmm - tangy!  I added 1 Tbsp of cider vinegar and 1 Tbsp of sugar to the dressing as suggested and it was a bit much for me, so next time I'll use 1 tsp of each.  I didn't have any relish so I diced up some sweet pickles instead.  Quite a nice potato salad that really does taste better warm!

Great potato salad!  I doubled the recipe, but halved the original egg and onion amounts.  I also think I used a little more mayo than it called for and used chopped green onion instead of bulb onion.  It got a lot of complements!

Tasty.  I also added a Tablespoon of sugar and a little dill.  It would be bland without this.  But I'll definitely keep the recipe.  My picky 7-year-old liked it a lot.

Great after some alterations.  I used 1/2 tsp celery seed instead of celery (my family doesn't like celery), instead of all mayo I used half mayo half sour cream, instead of the minced garlic I used garlic salt (about 1 tsp) and I added black olives.  It turned out perfect!!!!!

This potato salad is great, but i left out the celery and replaced it with green onions. I don't like anything crunchy in my p. salad. I also added paprika on top because it makes it look pretty. Over all, I will definite use it again. I've always liked p. salad but never made my own, until now.

This is a new favorite!  First time making homemade potato salad, and it was a delicious change from the usual deli kind.  I followed as is and thought it was much too dry, however, so I added about another half recipe of just the dressing and it is EXCELLENT.  I will make this over and over!

This is good (with minor adjustments). I omitted the garlic (we don't like it raw) and added a little sugar and vinegar. Also added a few extra eggs and it was just like we like it in the South. Slightly sweet and tangy. Will make again. Thanks!

This was okay, but I doubt I'll make it again.  I tried this recipe when I was unable to find my beloved no-fail recipe.  I served it chilled, as folks in my neck of the woods would never dream of eating warm potato salad.  I added a little vinegar and sugar and I thought it tasted great.  My husband even commented that it had a little "zip" to it.  So, we were surprised that it seemed to lose a great deal of flavor overnight.  I totally forgot to add extra salt.  Take it from me - it's not good to forget the salt.  It was a little bland because I forgot the salt, but that's my fault.  I still gave it four stars because it's a good place to start.  With a little experimentation, it can be adapted to appeal to individual tastes.

If you like relish and celery, this is probably the recipe for you.  I don't, so I shouldn't have picked this recipe.  My memory of every potato salad I have liked had a little relish in it, so I thought I was on the right track, especially with all the great reviews of this recipe.  I think this is too much, though.  Also, maybe hold off on the mustard a bit.  The garlic is a nice touch.  But I think I'll keep looking for the right recipe for me.

This was pretty good!  Nothing touches my grandmother's potato salad, so my standards are really high.  If I only knew her recipe!  Haha.

I tried this both warm and cold, and it was great either way (though warm was best!)

I also added 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar and 1 tbsp sugar as a previous reviewer did and the flavor did improve. In addition, I used 1 tbsp yellow mustard with 1 tbsp dijon and instead of regular mayo, I used a 1/4 cup light mayo and 1/4 light sour cream to lower the fat content. Finally, I added a half of a sweet red pepper for flavor and to add color. So, you might say that my final salad was nothing like the original but it tastes superb and the original was a great base to work off of.

This was amazing! It was almost like it was a family passed down for generations. It had substance, and full flavor. One thing I did do was make 6 more eggs than what was called for. I cut the eggs into big chunks and people really seem to love this. A+++

This recipe is truly just like you find in the south. One southern cook taught me to put the garlic and about 1/3 cup of chopped onion into a bowl with a bit of butter, then microwave for a minute, then add to the potato salad. It adds a nice flavor.

I thought this was delicious!  My husband only gave it two stars only because he likes a sweeter potato salad with sugar in it.  It was perfect for me though.

Wow!  This potato salad blew me away!  The best potato salad I've ever had, by far!  I wasn't so sure about the garlic in it but I threw it in anyway and it made all the difference. I also threw in about half of a small onion chopped.  Excellent recipe, though.  I will definetly make this one again!

This turned out OK.  And I say OK b/c I absolutely hate potato salad but I ate this and thought it was OK.  My b/f on the other hand (who requested potato salad) LOVED IT!  This is an easy recipe for the potato salad first-timer, thanks!

This was a yummy, standard potato salad.  I didn't follow the exact amounts in the recipe but did include all the ingredients except the garlic, to my taste and found it very good.  I especially liked the crunchy celery which lightened it up, as well as the relish which gave it just the right amount of sweet/sour taste.

This was a good recipe that was easy to make.  Mine came out pretty garlic-y, so make sure you want a pretty strong garlic taste in your potato salad.  I used half regular mustard, half spicy brown and I also cut my potatoes BEFORE boiling!

I think this is a great base recipe, because I could tell by the ingredients list I would have to 'tweak' it a little to suit my tastes.  I used chopped vidalia onion instead of garlic, just b/c that's the way I'm used to it.  I also added the mustard just 1 teaspoon at at a time, b/c some reviewers described it as too mustardy, and I don't like too much mustard.

I did a few improvisions due to: what I had on hand & likenesses.  I used onion rather than  celery..and used only 2 eggs.  Used a little more mayo.  I just took a bite..and yummy.  I will be serving this cold, though.  Thanks a bunch!

I made this tonight for Memorial dinner tomorrow along with a few others, we'll see which ones they like.  I did add dill pickle juice to offset the sweetness of the relish and we chopped the celery very fine.  Used jarred garlic and added a little more than called for.  Now we are just trying to stay out of it.  Very good thanks for the post.

This was good, but I doubled the recipe and think maybe I used too much mustard as the salad was very yellow. Also, I think it needed more seasoning, as it is a little bland.

this was a little bland, but i liked the foundation. these were my changes/additions and it turned out fabulous! i used 3lbs russet potatoes (cut in 1/2, boiled 30 min's & chopped into large pieces), 3 eggs chopped, 2 stalks celery chopped, 2 grn onions chopped and split the mustard as: 1/2T ylw prepared mustard, 1/2T dijon and 1T country dijon. i also added a splash of apple cider vinegar, a splash of red wine vinegar, a pinch of celery salt and pinch of white pepper (i also used reg. salt & pepper to season).

Too much mustard. Will make again, but with less mustard.
