Fruit mixture was too much for one pie (even deep dish!), so I made two pies (which actually worked out since I bought pre-made pie crusts that come 2 in a package). It looked great, and tasted great too! Not sickly sweet like some other apple pies. I made this for a big Thanksgiving dinner and received many compliments.

Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews that warned about the filling being far too much for one pie shell. However, using half the filling in one pie, but all the streusel, created an easy, delicious dessert. I will make this again, albeit half the original quantities.

Very good!  The cranberry gives this pie just the tangy tartness that makes it great.  Definitely use a deep dish crust - even with that it was still very full. Be sure to cover the edges of the pie crust with foil after the first ten minutes or it will burn. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

This pie was delicious! I forgot the nuts, but no one knew anyway. It was even better two days later. All liked it. It was a great combo of sweet and tart. I made no changes to this recipe.

Kind of dry, and not very custard-like. My mom loved this recipe, but I wasnt very impressed.

This recipe looks fabulous, so I tried it.  I followed other reviews comments, and I half'd the cranberries and the apples and left everything else the same.  It turned out PERFECT, I allowed it to cool in the oven, as that helped the custard set better.  The dessert was a hit with my young family too.  THANK YOU, I will make this again.

i thought this pie tasted quite good, but surprisingly to me, it was the least favorite dessert on the table this christmas.  it looks festive but i suppose it just lost out to the other choices.  on the whole it's pretty simple to make, although it overflowed all over the oven (should have seen it coming and stuck a cookie sheet under it....).

This was the first apple pie I've ever made. It was easy as pie!  I had a craving for apple cranberry pie & this hit the spot :) I'll be going out to buy cranberries to put in the freezer, so I can have this throughout the year.

This was ok. The custard was nothing special. I would just make an apple pie and add cranberries.

The mixture was easy to make (I made my own pastry) and after previous reviews, I used a deep dish flan tin. So, the batter fitted exactly and there was no overflow during the cooking. I thought it tasted okay the first day, but really nice the next day. I didn't plan on making it again in future, but my household loved it and requested that I make it again.

This was delicious and easy to make.  I liked that even after 3 days, the pie stayed fresh without getting a soggy crust.

Very very good.  I agree with all the commenters that the filling made two pies, not one.  I also added an additional amount of sugar on the top and it sweetened it up nicely.
