I used leftover smoked pork in this soup and it was wonderful! Wish I had doubled the recipe. It was a little on the sweet side but I enjoyed it!

I've made this several times each successful!  I've used home grown tomatoes inside it.  I'm going to add corn the next time I make it.  This would make a great sweet and sour.  Just add chunked tomatoes, pineapple, and skinned cucumbers and serve with rice.  There ya go!

My family loves sweet chili. I always add sugar and a dash of cinnamon to ours. This was a sweet and easy chili. It was gone in one sitting. This would also go amazing over nachos or fries as well. I'll definitely be making this again. I'll also experiment with mixing this up. Yummy!

This recipe was good, but a bit too sweet for me and my family. Some people would prefer a sweeter chili, however, we would prefer it to be more savory. I've never made Pork chili so it was fun to try.

This was nice. I made a couple of changes - less brown sugar so it wasn't too sweet, 1/2 the canned tomatoes (it looked plenty wet after the first can so I stopped there), and corn instead of the kidney beans due to what I had on hand. Ate some for lunch with corn chips and it was pretty good. Plan on having the leftovers for dinner tomorrow in the form of nachos which I'm sure will be just as good.
