I made these for my fiance and he said it was the best cookie he has ever eaten. The creamy middle is quite surprising, like a gourmet peanut butter sandwich cookie.  I will be adding this to my list of cookies for the holidays!

These cookies are great as written but when I made these again the grocery store was out of the roll of pb cookie dough so I bought the Pillsbury Big Deluxe Classics Peanut Butter Cup with mini pb cups cookie dough. (12 cookie variety) This made it so much easier and even more yummy!!!!!! You just have to cut the 12 cookie pieces in half to make 24. Flatten them out a little and put a small spoonful (instead of making the balls) of the pb mixture in the middle and wrap the cookie dough around it. Then I proceeded with the rest of instructions. 7 min. cooking time works perfect in my oven. My husband said these are the best pb cookies he has ever had. I agree. Worth the time and effort. Enjoy!

These are perfect! Exactly what regular pb cookies have been missing all these years! I personally prefer to use my own pb cookie recipe instead of the pre-made Pillsbury. But man, oh man- I am an absolute pb freak, and these are the best pb cookies I have ever had. I'll take the extra few minutes to make these instead of regular cookies from now on!

These are delightful cookies!  Do not compromise and buy store brand cookie dough, it's just not worth it.  There are so many things going on with these cookies, sweet, crunchy, creamy.

Made these for Easter for my peanut butter loving grandkids.  They are wonderful and rather easy to do--just time consuming!

I couldnt find the peanut butter cookie roll in my supermarket so i subbed with a sugar cookie roll and followed the recipe (omitting the nuts). I popped the peanut butter balls in the freezer for a few minutes to make wrapping the cookie dough around them easier. The cookies flattened more than i would have liked (maybe the peanut butter dough doesn't flatten as much)but the flavor was good. Kind of like a peanutbutter snickerdoodle.

These are really good.  I used the peanut butter supreme cookie dough with chocolate chunks and peanut butter cups.  Cut the twelve cookies into 24 and wrapped the dough around the balls.  These flew off the plate.  I will definitely be making these again.

These are pretty good, but not excellent. Interesting idea, good for a peanut butter craving, but it's just a little too much all at once.
