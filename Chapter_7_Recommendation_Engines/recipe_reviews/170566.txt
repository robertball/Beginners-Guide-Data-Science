Wow, this tasted even better than expected. I added toasted sesame seeds and sliced scallions on top of the fish to serve. Also, I stirred in about 1 tbsp cornstarch to the marinade after I took the tilapia out of the oven (for 3 servings).

The original version of this recipe is worthy of 4 stars, but by adding toasted sesame seeds and some Thai red chili paste it easily becomes a 5 star recipe.

Such an easy and flavorful recipe. I didn't have orange juice and substituted with apple juice. I also used fresh ginger (grated and squeezed the juices out)and it tasted awesome. I intend to make this many more times and try different types of fish. Thank you for a delicious and healthy recipe.

I'm always looking for new fish recipes, and my husband and I both agree that this one is a keeper!  Great for an Asian-themed meal; served it with Jasmine rice, sweet-cooked carrots, and steamed broccoli.  I topped the fillets with toasted sesame seeds and sliced green onions as suggested by previous reviewers.  I did use a good quality (brewed) low-sodium soy sauce, and we did NOT find the dish at all salty as mentioned by a previous reviewer.

I knew I was going to love this recipe and I was right. Anything with soy sauce and sesame oil gets my attention right away. I made the marinate first thing in the morning and had this for dinner. The tilapia soaked up all that wonderful flavor. Mmmm so good! (I did top off with some toasted sesame seeds)

Absolutely wonderful! I love how the fish came out so moist and light. I cooked the fish for only 9 minutes and I think if you cook it longer than that, your fish will come out a little over cooked. For those who thought the dish was too salty, I used low sodium soy sauce and my sauce turned out perfect. Very healthy dish that I will be cooking very, very often.

WOW! What a recipe. My girlfriend and I loved it. Will become a regular in our household. I read quite a few of the reviews and did what most others did. Cut the soy sauce and sesame oil in half. Also with the left over marinade i made a sauce with it and spooned on top of the fish, then added sesame seeds. One thing i will add next time is some kind of hot pepper, i to like a little heat, and found that was the only thing missing. Also next time make sure there's a extra helping.

This was very good!  Probably 4 stars for taste, but when you consider how easy and fast it is, and that you probably have all ingredients on hand when you decide on fish at the last minute, AND your preschoolers ask for seconds, it becomes 5 stars!  We marinaded an hour and then grilled.  I think a marinade all day would have been better. Put some toasted sesames on top.  1/8 of sesame oil.

Great tasting tilapia can't be much easier than this! I marinated partially-frozen tilapia for about 3 hours until they were completely thawed.  Since the fillets were so thin, I just grilled them on my indoor grill pan.  The boiled and reduced marinade made a tasty sauce to eat over the fish.  Served with Onion Rice (from allrecipes) this was a gourmet meal!

I tried this recipe with Rainbow Trout rather than Tilapia since that's what I had. It was very good, but I found it to be a little too salty, and would have preferred it a bit sweeter. Next time I would change it to 1/8 cup soy sauce and 3/4 cup OJ.  As others mentioned, I garnished with sesame seeds and scallions and thickened the sauce with a bit of cornstarch at the end. Presentation was very nice - I served with jasmine rice and garlic scented broccoli. Thank you!

This is awesome! I made the marinade as directed. But I did take the pan drippings and boil with dehydrated onion flakes, sriracha sauce, and tapioca flour (for thickening). The sauce brought it up to 5 stars.

I served this on a bed of jasmine rice, steamed baby carrots and steamed broccoli, with the sauce poured over. Even my 3 and 5 year olds ate it. And that is saying something for them. Will definitely make this again.

I used half the amount of sesame oil because it's expensive and the taste is strong enough to really only need half and it was excellent! A great way to flavor fish.

My husband and I altered this recipe by simply garnishing the fish with toasted sesame seeds and using a little cornstarch to turn the marinade into a "gravy" and really loved it.  We had a spring mix salad and brown rice with the fish.  I give the original recipe 5 stars; and our "embellishments" a 6th star.

This was fantastic, I modified the presentation by using the maranade over 2 Cod filets then plated the fish on top of a small bed of rice noodles and sprinkled with sesame seeds.  Very tasty and a very nice presentation

This was so so so EASY!  I liked it but it did lack something spice wise.  I think next time I would add some thinly sliced red pepper and maybe some Thai pepper sauce to balance the sweetness.  Good basic recipe though!

This marinate is very simple yet easy. My husband and children TOTALLY loved it, I was okay with it. I felt it was way to salty. I'd make it again for them but I'd cut back on at least half the amount of soy sauce & possibly the sesame oil, Tilapia isn't normally a salty fish and the soy sauce & possibly the sesame oil over powered it for myself. However, they ate the fish all gone. The fish was very tender and flaky. Thanks Nancy.

I followed recipe exactly and the flavor wasn't as appealing to me. The sesame oil overpowered all other flavors. Will probably not make again.

I never try a recipe w/o rave reviews, so I didn't think I'd need to change anything from what seemed like classic Asian flavors, but the balance was definitely off. Too many low notes- not enough bite. Needed more OJ or spice... or SOMEthing. My mom and I have different tastes when it comes to food so I thought she might like it since I didn't. No go. She didn't like it either w/recipe as written...

If you use a different kind of fish thats thicker for this recipe (like our triple tail) then crank up the the amount of marinade/time marinating it as you see fit. Youve been warned. = )

Great mix of flavors, and so easy!!  I used light soy sauce, added a toasted sesame/ginger spice mix, and substituted honey for the sugar, but kept close to the original recipe otherwise.   Served with coconut-ginger rice and peas.

Fab!  And ultra easy.  When the fish was done I removed from the pan and whisked about 2 tsp of cornstarch into the remaining marinade and popped it back innthe oven to thicken for a few-it made a great sauce.  Served it over sticky sushi rice, and roasted asparagus topped with toasted sesame seeds.  Yummo!  A great weeknight dish!

This was incredibly subtle, but I really enjoyed it. I baked mine at 450, since I was serving it with frozen egg rolls, and I wanted everything to be ready at the same time. I'll make this for my husband when he redeploys.

I thought that this recipe had way too much oil and soy sauce in it.  If I make it again, I would definitely add less oil and soy sauce in it and perhaps add some honey.  There was so much oil in it, the ingredients wouldn't mix properly!    The fish did turn out beautifully cooked, though. I broiled it a few minutes at the end in order to give it a bit of crisp.  My boyfriend liked it, but I was overwhelmed by too much saltiness (from the soy sauce). With modification, this could be a superb recipe, so I'll probably experiment with it in the future.

This was really tasty!  We actually didn't have sesame oil the first time we made it so we used a bit more soy sauce, which worked just fine.

Second time we made it we had the sesame oil and it was just as tasty!!  We may add some roasted sesame seeds next time for added texture and more of that sesame taste.

Absolutely amazing! Super easy and super flavorful!!! I too added some cornstarch to the juices and I actually added it to a vegetable medley with a little extra soy sauce. Paired it with a good loaded mash potato and we were wanting more!!!

Loved this recipe!  It was tasty and easy.  I did cut way back on the sesame oil tho.  I used low sodium soy sauce, extra garlic and also added some chili sauce.  I did serve it with toasted sesame seeds and scallions but it didn't realy need it.  My son and husband loved it and they both said they want me to make this again soon.

Thanks for the inspiration!  I used 1/8 cup low sodium soy sauce, 3 tbsp dark sesame oil, 4 cloves garlic, 1 tsp grated fresh ginger, a splash of mirin, 1/4 tsp orange extract, and 4 tbsp of sesame seeds and the marinate smells delicious!

This was good, though nothing to "write home about". I added a few grinds of black pepper, marinated for 2 hours, then served with chopped green onion tops. I'll try this marinade again, (it definitely needs the black pepper) but I've decided that I just don't like tilapia, so I'll be using a different fish next time!

A simple, fast marinade.  It was good, but felt like it was missing something.  A bit mild, but overall good flavor.

Amazing recipe! I substituted orange-pineapple juice for the orange juice and used about 1/4 fresh minced ginger instead of the ground ginger. It was so tasty!

I loved loved loved the marinade, I didn't have ginger so I put a bit of cinnamon because it was the only "similar" spice I had and then I added a little bit of chili sauce to even with the coconut rice I also made. I loved how the marinade smelled and how it tasted but once I tried it with the fish, I couldn't eat it. I know it was because I apparently don't like tilapia like I thought I did and so I'm going to try this marinade on chicken of beef because I think it would taste better. Sorry for such a crummy review! I was really wanting to like this!

Very good tilapia dish.  I don't really like fish (wife loves it) and I rarely finish my plate.  I normally spend all night making a fish dish and end up eating the sides until Im full.  But I finished this one!  I lightly blackened it as opposed to baking it.  Other than that I stuck with the recipe.  Next time I might make a asian sauce to put over the top of it (so I don't taste the fish), but my wife loved it just the way it is.  Great recipe!

I added toasted sesame seeds and a little more sugar.  I made this with only two filets and I liked that there was extra sauce to be drizzled over the rice.  Served with a side of broccoli.  My family and I enjoyed this.

Did not like it at all. I am not real picky, I eat my mess ups usually, but the fish was robust but with a heavy soy taste. The sauce idea was a mistake.

Perfectly simple, tasty recipe!  Followed recipe as is, except I could not get my gas oven to start, so I cooked it stove top in a pan with a small amount of cooking oil. It turned out great! (I sprinkled with some sesame seeds for garnish, too.)

I was disappointed with this recipe i thought it would have more orange flavor to it.  Also if i were to make it again i would reduce the oil and soy sauce.

Cooked this for my girlfriend and It was a big hit. We had gone out a few nights earlier for dinner and she mentioned how she liked foods with sesame flavoring but they had to be done just right not to strong. I will admit I was worried it would come out to strong but it came out perfect! I will be making it again.

I used sugar-free orange marmalade instead of the orange juice, and I left the sugar out.

The family liked it, so I'll be making it again.

I did cut down the sesame oil to 1/8 cup and am glad I did because the smell overpowers the dish.  Other than that, i followed exactly and just found it bland.  We ate it with lime slices, and broccoli and rice.  The dish probably would have been better if I marinated longer than 30 minutes.

Pretty good.  Reduced the amount of sesame oil by quite a bit and made up for the reduction with vegetable oil and tahini.  Added about a tsp of Sriracha and about a TBSP of sesame seeds.  Also split the marinade and did half fish and half chicken (since some around here don't like fish that well).  The chicken needed a bit longer to marinate but still was pretty good.

i followed the advice of one previous review and used half as much sesame oil. That worked out very well. Plus, having fresh ginger on hand I chopped it very fine and that gave the recipe a tad bit more zing. 

My 5 year old granddaughter, a very picky eater, gobbled up this tilapia and asked for seconds!  Next time, I'm going to have to use more filets.

I found the flavor of the sesame oil to be very overwhelming. If this recipe was made again at my house, I would reduce the amount if sesame oil drastically.

It's different and pretty tasty.  My husband didn't like the toasted sesame seeds I sprinkled on top (per another viewer's recommendation)  The green onions on top were good (per another viewer's rec.....).  My husband liked the fish recipe and so did I.  Its a keeper :-)

I halved the marinade and used two large pieces of tilapia. I also needed to bake it for about 15 minutes, but, my fish was thick. I'd repeat it but try marinading longer than 30 minutes. I couldn't taste the OJ. hubby loved the sesame oil flavor.

We enjoyed a different taste for our much loved tilapia.  I made it as written with the exception of adding some red pepper flakes...we love a bit of heat.  And I did take the suggestion of other reviewers and added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I served some Thai noodles and pea pods with it to round out the meal.

This comes together in about three minutes with ingredients every cook has on hand. With toasted sesames and green onion on top, it is quite a pretty dinner for a Tuesday night! Nice, simple flavor. I didn't add a full teaspoon of sugar because we don't really eat sweet foods. Baked for about 15 minutes and was perfect - even the baby enjoyed!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was good.  If I make it again, I will halve the marinade ingredients and marinate in a bag, then dust the damp fish with corn starch before baking because I would like it to get a little crispy on the outside.  Of course, the pan would have to be greased if I do this.  (I would try flour, but I have to keep it gluten free.)

Delicious!  I took the marinade and boiled I'd down to a syrup and poured over the tilapia before I served it. My picky eater gobbled it up!

Fits the bill easily, tastily. I frequent a chinese food restaurant that uses a recipe that very close to this and I wanted to try it at home.  Well, this is much better!  I doubled the recipe and used whiting instead of tilapia.  It was great on a bed of rice with a side of tasty string beans.  The bonus was that the kids absolutely loved it.  I'll be adding it to the dinner rotation.

It was ok, the thinner parts were way overmarinated and I didn't like them but the thicker parts were good.

This recipe was delicious, but we made it with salmon instead of tilapia (our local store didn't have fresh tilapia). I must say it was fantastic! My whole family loved it and was very impressed. The best part? It was so easy!

I liked this, but i did find it to be a little salty.  Next time i will try it with a low-sodium sauce and maybe cut back on the sesame oil a bit.  But it was better than most Tilapia recipes that i've tried, and i think it would be great with Salmon too.

This was ok, not great. Maybe I should have marinated the fish longer (I used grouper). Took another cook's advice and added thai chili paste and sesame seeds, but wasn't that impressed with flavor. Salty even with the low sodium soy sauce.

This is a good recipe.  It's not very orangey, as other reviewers said.  It's more nutty.  There are so many redundant tilapia recipes out there -- this one was a welcome change.  Will make again.
