This recipe lived up to the name. I put shrimp into the recipe b/c it's not jambalaya (to me) without shrimp.  I skipped the hot sauce, opting for a dash of cayenne.

This was a really tasty, quick dish.  I did use rice since that it what I had. I will make this again.

This is a fast twist on jambalaya which keeps the kids happy and gets the family a yummy home-cooked meal quickly. I followed the recipe exactly and will definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing!

This was a huge hit! I have a large family so I tripled the recipe. I used beef cheddar kielbasa and doubled the herds & spices. For added color I used red, orange, and yellow bell peppers. I will definitely be making this again.

I doubled the recipe, added a 1lb of precooked shrimp, and 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. I also used cauliflower rice instead of regular rice... FANTASTIC.. I will use twice as much cauliflower rice the next time because it doesn't absorb the liquid as much. I also might not add the water next time

It was a great base recipe, but not any heat, so I used spicy sausage, and Zatarain's Jambalaya rice and added some heat.

Used Sausage instead of Kielbasa and added some Creole Seasoning I had from New Orleans.  This was fantastic!

I have made this several times and it is a family favorite. I have even substituted frozen vegetables for the peppers when I didn't have peppers and it was still delicious. Very quick and easy.

Perfect and quick. Did not have orzo pasta so subbed rice.  (Rice is quick in a pressure cooker and I always pre-cook first).  Added left-over cooked chicken at the end, also shrimp cuz hubby likes it that way. Yum Yum !

I've never had true Jumbalaya before so I'm not sure how close this is the "the real thing" but if Jumbalaya is even remotely similar in flavor then I'm a fan. This was fantastic!!! I used andoulli sausage instead of the kielbasa and added a 1/2lb of shrimp. I might just make this a weekly staple. It was simple to make with minimal ingredients and minimal time spent cooking. Awesome dish. Can't say enough good things about it! Thanks for the recipe.

Made several times and it's a keeper.  Not the best jambalaya I've ever made but for a meal that one can put together almost instantly, it is awesome.

This was wonderful and one of the easiest recipes I've tried.  Like Lea, I skipped the orzo as I don't keep it on hand and served the rest over brown rice instead. Yummy!  I'll definitely make this many more times, and will probably double it for an upcoming family dinner.  Thanks so much for sharing this!

I chose not to use the pasta. Instead, I put the jambalaya over rice and it's just as tasty! :)

Very good & easy! Added chicken sausage & fresh shrimp w/tails on for last 5 min so they would be tender. Served w/additional salt & hot sauce on side and petite French baguettes! Great for a cold night!

Very easy to make and quite tasty. I eliminated the hot sauce and the dish was still quite flavourful.
