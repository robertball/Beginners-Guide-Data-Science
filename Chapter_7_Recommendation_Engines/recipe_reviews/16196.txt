Good base recipe - but I had to change so many things to make it perfect (and succeeded after several tries). Therefore, can only give it 3 stars. I used beef stew meat instead of top round steak, a whole onion instead of half, 8 ounces of fresh mushrooms instead of canned, 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1, a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce instead of just a teaspoon, 1/2 cup of red wine instead of 1/4 cup of white wine and 1/4 cup of water, a tablespoon of cornstarch in addition to the flour, just 8 ounces of sour cream instead of 16, and added 4 ounces of cream cheese. I followed the same directions, except adding the fresh mushrooms at the end for just the last hour of cooking. So, after all of those changes - it has become THE Stroganoff recipe for our family!

Soooo good!  I dissolved the beef bouillon in 1 Tbl. water before adding.  I used 1/2 the sour cream, as others suggested (light or fat-free sour cream works just fine), and it was perfect!  I also used a package of fresh mushrooms, layered last on the top.  Mine needed to cook only 5 hours on low.  My preference is thickly sliced onions, instead of chopped ones, and to stir in the sour cream just before serving.  Serve on a platter with egg noodles around the edges, and the beef stroganoff in the middle - very pretty display.  Steamed broccoli goes well with this dish.  One note:  I made this once with double the meat, so I doubled the sauce ingredients -- bad idea!  It had WAY too much liquid.  Next time I double the meat, I will leave the other ingredients as stated.  Note:  After reading another review, I decided to sprinkle the meat with garlic powder as well, increase the Worcestershire to 1 Tbl., increase the garlic to 2 cloves, leave off the bouillon and water, increase the wine to 1/2 cup, and add 1 Tbl. cornstarch in addition to the flour (I mixed it with the wine).  All WONDERFUL suggestions.  Big difference in the flavor & thickness of the sauce (had been too watery before).  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent base recipe.  I made quite a few changes, and it turned out great.  The cut of meat should probably be beef stewing meat, it does better than a lean cut in a slow cooker.  I used fresh mushrooms, green onions instead of chives, beef broth in place of bouillon and wine, and only used 8 oz. sour cream.  To thicken it up more, I added 4 oz. cream cheese with the sour cream, and I also boiled my noodles til al dente' and added them to the crock.  After an hour, it was the perfect consistency.  Thanks so much!

My family LOVED this. My husband called it "restaurant quality." From a slow cooker!! I read all the comments and proceeded like this: I used London broil cuz that's what i always use for stroganoff. I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I used red wine in place of the white wine and water; beef needs red wine, not white. I opted for the suggestion to replace the sour cream with 4 oz. of cream cheese and 8 oz. of sour cream (added 30 minutes before serving). I whisked a couple of tablespoons of cornstarch with some of the sauce and whisked that mixture back into the pot right before the addition of the sour cream/cream cheese. The sauce ended with a perfect consistency and exceptional flavor. I served it with a spinach salad. This is a real keeper!

This was quite good!  I miss the meaty, floured and pan-fried taste of the traditional stroganoff but the sauce was just excellent.  My husband, the traditional stroganoff fan said, "This is savory stuff you've made here."  The last time I tried a crock pot stroganoff dish he wasn't thrilled with it.  But I've learned to recognize when a recipe doesn't have enough spices for us and to add more in.  
With this recipe I added a couple shakes of minced onions, garlic salt, Lawry's seasoned salt, and garlic powder.  I went heavy on the pepper and it turned out just right.  I used 2 tsp beef boullion granules (not sure if that's equal to a cube but it worked), 2 tsp worcestershire, chicken stock instead of water and wine, and a little dash of old champagne because I didn't have white wine handy.  Used small can of mushrooms as well as 8oz pkg fresh mushrooms.  That works out really well if you're a mushroom lover like us.  Doubled the minced garlic to two cloves.  May bring it down to just one next time since I also sprinkle garlic powder.

Definitely taste the sauce before you let it simmer for 8 hours.  If it doesn't have enough flavor, add more spices in upfront.  We used about 12oz sour cream.  My husband likes the taste of sour cream.  I asked him if he'd like more and he said it was perfect as is.

This is a great recipe! I did make changes to it to fit our lifestyle. I substituted eye of round for the meat. I substituted 4 large fresh Portobello mushrooms for the canned. I also substituted lite sour cream for the full-fat (cuts down on the fat content tremendously!). To help with the extra moisture created by the fresh mushrooms, I mixed about 1 tablespoon of corn starch with the wine before adding to the crock pot. I make this often, especially in the colder months!

This is amazing.  I sauted the onions and mushrooms before adding to the pot and I added a half package of Lipton onion soup mix.  I already want to make this again, everyone in the family loved it!

My whole family loved this recipe! It was easy and quite tasty served over hot egg noodles. I used 1 and 1/2 lbs stew meat, which I seasoned with salt and pepper, dredged in flour, and seared before adding to the crock pot (I do this with all meat I cook in the slow cooker). I used 1/2 c. chicken broth instead of the wine and water (chicken broth is my go-to liquid for all recipes; we never have wine in the house) and deglazed the meat-searing pan with it before adding to the crockpot. I also used about 1 T. worcestershire sauce, some chopped green onions, fresh mushrooms (who uses canned mushroom?) and only 8 oz of lite sour cream (it tasted creamy this way, and who needs the extra fat and calories). Finally, I thickened the sauce a little with a corn starch/water slurry. Great recipe!

Will make again, using less sour cream. The cream cheese idea in the other reviews was a good one, will try that too.

Made changes based on Sara's suggestions (Aug. 11, 2007) & some of my own. With those changes, it's 5 stars. Double recipe & slow cook it the day before up to the last hour, which allows flavours to combine better. The next day, add sour cream, cream cheese & parsley mixture, which you can make day before & add to slow cooker the last hour of cooking. Use 3 pounds top sirloin & ask butcher to cut across grain into 1/2" x 2" strips, resulting in fork tender meat. In large ziploc bag, mix 3 tablespoons flour, 1½ teaspoons salt, & ½ teaspoon fresh ground pepper. Add meat in batches & shake to coat. Sear meat on medium/high in 1½ tablespoons each of canola oil & butter to bring out flavour. For a "doubled" recipe, use "1/2" cup red wine instead of white & omit water, 2 teaspoons chopped green onion "tops" instead of dry chives (didn't have), 3 beef bouillon cubes, 2 tablespoons Worcestershire, 2 teaspoons chopped garlic from a jar, 2 chopped onions (20 to 24 ounces), 2 tablespoons flour, 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, 16 ounces baby bella (cremini) mushrooms instead of canned. Add 6 ounces softened light cream cheese blended into only 16 ounces fat free sour cream with 1 cup chopped fresh parsley. In last ½ hour, remove ½ cup of broth & mix with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch, which is added back to slow cooker, to thicken.

The flavor was good but the sauce was very runny. My family thought it was pretty good. Easy to make!

Very good!  The sauce is very flavorful and rich.  I found a very large top round in my basement freezer from last summer, searched the site and found this offering.  I doubled the recipe, added a splash more Worcestershire and wine, leaned heavy on the salt and pepper and probably quadrupled the garlic.  Near the end I stirred in a block of cream cheese, saved the sour cream to dollop on top.  Always use red wine in Stroganoff - both for color and flavor!

Not bad! My hubs doesn't even care for stroganoff and commented that this was better than his mom's recipe!!! Having said this, I did make several changes (I know...). Using Sara's review as a guide, I too used beef stew meat instead of round steak, upped the amount of W sauce to 1 T, doubled up on the garlic, added an entire (small) onion, substituted 1/2 c. RED wine for the 1/4 c. water / white wine called for and decreased the sour cream to 8 oz. worth. In addition to these changes, I made a couple of my own. :) In lieu of a beef bouillion cube, I substituted a packet of beefy onion soup mix. I also added 4 oz. of spreadable onion & chive flavored cream cheese (half a container) rather than plain 'ol cream cheese and ommitted the mushrooms alltogether (we aren't big fans). These changes were spot on for us. My only complaint is that my sauce was a tad too thick and too tangy for my liking (I'll cut back on the sc even more next time). While I don't like runny sauces, I think mine could have used more liquid. Many reviewers added fresh mushrooms during the final hour of cooking. Mushrooms release mositure as they cook, so that's prolly why those folks had no issue with their sauce (or on the flipside, added flour or cornstarch to compensate). FINAL NOTE: Feel free to use fat-free / reduced sodium ingredients. I used ff / low sodium soup & ff sc / cream cheese with EXCELLENT results! Served over egg noodles w/ peas & garlic bread on the side. Thanks for sharing, Daria! :-)

Based on the previous reviews, I made a few substitutions: used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, used 1/2 c. beef broth instead of the 1/4 c. of water and 1/4 c. of wine, used 1/2 packet of onion soup mix in place of the bouillon, and only used 1/2 the amount of sour cream. Also, I would not recommend adding  the fresh parsley to the slow cooker ... it will look and taste much better if you just sprinkle it over the top before serving. Overall, though, my husband and I really enjoyed this and I will definitely make it again.

OMG.  I read the reviews and made some of the same changes.  Real mushrooms, 2 cloves of garlic, 1 tblsp of worecetshire sauce, used beef broth instead of the boulion and 1/4 cup of water.  Last of all I did take a ladel of the gravy 1 hour before serving and stirred some corn starch in and added it when I added the sour cream.  Perrrrfect.  I will be making this again and again.  I served it over whole wheat noodles (don't mix them in or they will get sticky) and served with asparagus and garglic bread.

This recipe ended up amazing with some tweaking. I followed other reviewers' suggestions by using  1.2 lbs stew meat first, layered on the bottom. I seasoned it with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I chopped a whole onion and sprinkled it on top of the beef. I poured in a can of golden mushroom soup, not cream of mushroom. I mixed 1 tbsp of flour and 1 tbsp cornstarch with 1/2 cup red wine instead of white. I omitted the water. I sprinkled the bouillon and some onion soup mix on top of the beef/onions/soup, poured the wine in, and then the diced garlic and 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce. After about 4 hours on low, I mixed in 4oz light cream cheese and 4oz light sour cream. I sliced up about 5 fresh white mushrooms and mixed them in. Let it cook for 1 more hour, and it's done! It tastes amazing. I'm going to serve it over brown rice. Should be a bit healthier this way too.

I used a whole onion instead of half, 8 ounces of fresh baby portabella mushrooms instead of canned, 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1, a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce instead of just a teaspoon, 1/2 cup of red wine instead of 1/4 cup of white wine and 1/4 cup of water, a tablespoon of cornstarch in addition to the flour, just 8 ounces of sour cream instead of 16, and added 4 ounces of cream cheese. I followed the same directions. It was great with those changes.  My son liked this  alot even though he doesn't like mushrooms.

My family loved this.  Like others, I made changes.  I used 1/2 cup red wine instead of less white.  1 onion instead of a half, used stew beef, 8 oz sour cream and skipped the dry chives.  I didn't have beef bullion, so I used an equivalent amount of vegetable "better than bullion".    I got a late start, so I cooked it on high for 3 hours and then changed to low for the last hour.  Turned out great!

This is an easy and tasteful recipe.  I have tried different recipes but this was the best of all.  I have a son that is a picky eater and he doesn’t eat much of anything, but he enjoyed this.  I altered the recipe and used fresh chives instead of the dry and fresh mushrooms in place of the can mushrooms.  Instead of the beef bouillon I used one can of beef broth low in sodium and omit the water.  At the end I mix a couple of tablespoons of flour with water and pour the mixture in the stroganoff which made it thicker.

I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars only because my daughter doesn't love it, but she likes it.  The rest of the family loves it. I followed advice of several reviewers - eliminated water, used fresh mushrooms, red cooking wine and cornstrch instead of flour. I also used 8 oz sour cream and 4 oz cream cheese instead of all sour cream.  This is a delicious recipe and has been addded to my Favorite Recipes list.

We really enjoyed this! I used a too thick leftover london broil that rufused to cook (completely raw in the middle) on the grill the night before at was a little over 1.5 lbs and it had been slathered in A-1 and Canadian Seasoning. I leiu of canned I opted for 8 oz fresh Baby Bella (Cimini) Mushrooms, which I added from the start and they held up wonderfully. Also gave it much more garlic than called for (we're garlic lovers) and added Seasoned Salt as per other reviewrs suggestions that it came out under seasoned. I used a fat free sour cream at the end to kick a wee bit of the fat content out and we enjoyed it over egg noodles. The worst part about this recipe is having to smell it and drool until dinner time! : )  Served with a fresh whole wheat bread from the bakery. Will definitly make again!

Used frozen cube steaks. Put worcestershire sauce directly on steaks. Used cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic. Added 3 garlic cloves. Used 1/2 c. of merlot wine instead of water and added 1T corn starch. Added 8oz fresh baby bella mushrooms 1 hr before end with the lite sour cream. Used whole wheat egg noodles. Steamed broccoli on the side...a delicious dinner. The steak was so tender that when stirring the mushrooms and sour cream in, the steaks broke up into pieces so I didn't have to cut them!

Excellent recipe!  Changes I made:  dredged the meat in flour, salt and pepper and browned.  Used golden mushroom soup as it has a beef base.  Omitted the canned mushrooms simply because the boyfriend doesn't like them.  Subbed red wine for white.  Cooked for 5 hours on low and then added 8 oz of sour cream, cooked an add'l hour.  Everyone loved it and the boyfriend's 9 y.o. son had 2 plates!

I made a few minor changes to accomodate our tastes, but this is a very good recipe. I used stew meat as that is what I had on hand, omitted the onions, replaced the water with beef broth, and doubled the mushrooms. I used 8 oz sour cream and 3 oz cream cheese to make it a little rich. The sauce was *absolutely* delicious, I couldn't stop 'taste testing'. Just great, thank you!

Great recipe, very flavorful.  Took the advice of the other readers and only added 8 oz. of sour cream, used beef broth in place of the boullion and water,added garlic salt and fresh mushrooms, and used green onions instead of dried chives which were really expensive at the market! My husband liked it(but he hates mushrooms), my super picky eight year old loved it, my not so picky six year old said it was ok. Will definately make this again!

I wish I had read the reviews before making this recipe.  16 oz. of sour cream is WAY too much.  8 oz. would be just perfect.  I also think it needs more mushrooms, but that could be just personal preference.  As made, I felt I had a whole lot of 'sauce' and not much 'substance.' It definitely wasn't bad, just needs a good bit of tweaking to be a five star recipe.

This was a superior recipe. My husband raved over it. I kept all the ingredients pretty much intact, except that I used condensed Golden Mushroom Soup. I didn't use round steak, instead choosing beef stew meat (tri-tip also works well). I dredged the meat in seasoned flour first (salt, pepper and paprika) and browned it well before putting it in the crock pot to cook.  I then deglazed the cooking pan with sherry (I had no white wine) and added it to the ingredients in the crockpot. About an hour before serving time, I added in freshly sauteed mushrooms, sour cream and about 2 T. of cream cheese. I served it over hot buttered egg noodles and parsley. This is great if you have guests coming for dinner!

A good stroganoff recipe. I thought the top round was way too tough, next time I will try a more tender cut of meat! Mom's is better, though.

This recipe is pretty tasty.  – I did make a couple changes, I used stew meat (because it was easier) and fresh mushrooms (because I prefer them).  It cooked for several hours in my slow cooker while I was at work.  When I got home and checked on it I thought it was a bit runny for stroganoff –almost soupy, but figured when I added the sour cream and parsley and allow it to cook for another hour that it might thicken up. –it never did.  To fix; I took a teaspoon of cornstarch and mixed it with a couple tablespoons of water then poured it into the stroganoff mixture and stirred.  It thickened quickly to a nice consistency.  Other then the two changes I made, I followed the recipe to the letter.  The only thing I can surmise from this is that the extra liquid came from the fresh mushrooms, which obviously was caused by my modification to the recipe.  I will make this recipe again, because my family enjoyed it and it was easy to throw together on a workday morning.

I have made this a couple times and I really enjoy it. A couple of things I did change, though. I used fresh mushrooms and chives insted of the canned and dried. Also, instead of the water and boullion cube, I used beef stock. All very delicious!

This is great!  I didn't want to wait 7-8 hours so I made this on the stove and just let it simmer for an hour.  It was so creamy and comforting on a frigid January day. It's a keeper for sure!

The whole family loves this recipe. Such great flavors, it's hard to believe how easy it is to throw everything in a crock pot and walk away! The only thing I do differently is to omit the wine....not a wine drinker so we never have it at home.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and was disappointed with the results.  I'm not sure if it's the recipe but the sauce was more liquidy than creamy.  The cream in the picture shown doesn't have a creamy texture so maybe that's the way it's supposed to be.  Disappointing but edible.  I'll be looking for another stroganoff recipe on here because I won't be making this one again.

Amazing recipe, it was a big hit at a family dinner!  I have already had several requests for the recipe.
Thanks!!!
The only 2 things I changed were using beef broth and about 10 oz. of sour cream.  If you use the broth, you may need to add more thickener when adding the sour cream.

This was delicious, though I made a few adjustments. I used a whole onion, fresh sliced mushrooms, fresh chive and used red wine (3/4 cup) instead of the water and white wine. I also used a cup of beef broth rather than the bouillon. I also only had about 8 oz. of sour cream, so I used a few spoonfuls of a homemade jalapeno sour cream I had leftover and just the tiniest spice came through, which had a lot of depth to the flavors. Grated pecorino over the top - delicious!

I agree with previous reviewers.  WAY too many changes to rate very high.  One other recommendation, I used fresh mushrooms, sauteed them with the onions and added them in the last half hour.  Otherwise onions are crunchy, even after 6 hours in slow cooker.

Very good. I had a lot of reservations about this recipe since I generally don't like anything made with canned soups, but it definitely tasted homemade! I made this recipe according to the changes suggested by Sara (1st review on the recipe page) and I'm positive the changes made it much better than it would have turned out otherwise. I will definitely make again, but the only thing I would change next time is to not add any cornstarch at the beginning, and instead add it about 20 minutes before I plan on eating so the thickening bonds won't break down with the sustained heat. I did leave the cover off for the last 1/2 hour, and that thickened up the gravy some before I added the sour cream. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe i think would've been great...however, i forgot to turn the slow cooker on before going to church.  so, i got home everything was still very much raw and cold so i threw it all in the skillet and it was great then.  i did add a little more onion and i used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  i also marinated sirloin strips in merlot overnite.  got rave reviews on it from my friends even though they had to wait for a few minutes for it.  i'm sure it would have really rocked in the slow cooker tho!  thanks!

This stroganoff was delicious, but I'm only giving it four stars because I made quite a few changes, using past reviews as a guide.  I used stew meat instead of round steak.  I omitted the water entirely and used red wine instead of white.  I used two cloves of garlic and increased the Worcestershire sauce to a tablespoon.  I cut the amount of sour cream in half and added four ounces of cream cheese, and I added these two ingredients during the last half-hour of cooking.  I added a tablespoon of cornstarch when I added the sour cream and cream cheese.  I omitted the parsley and mushrooms, as I did not have any on hand.  I cooked it for four hours on high.  The final product was great with these additions/changes.  Thanks!

This was great.  The meat was so tender!  Instead of using white wine, I used 1/4 cup chicken broth.  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly.

Very, very good.  This isn't quite like the stroganoff that I'm used to, but none of the recipes on this site are like the one that my family has made for years.  We always saute mushrooms garlic and onion in butter or olive oil, and then remove it from the pan and then saute the thin strips of beef. and put the mushroom mixture back in with a little flour and cook a for a few minutes together, and add about 2 1/2 cups of beef stock, and about 1/4 to 1/2 cup ketchup of tomato sauce (I perfer ketchup.) and continue stirring till it makes a beefy tomato gravy, and let it simmer for about 30 minutes.  Right before serving and after turing off the heat, I add a small carton of sour cream to the sauce, and season with garlic salt and pepper, and parsely.  I serve it over buttered egg noodles.
Anyways........This was a an excellent quick version of what we love and I didn't have to stand and babysit it. It remined me more of a stew, but it was wonderful.

This was a "melt in your mouth" winner.  I used bottom round roast instead of top round because it's cheaper and dried chives instead of fresh and it turned out fantastic.

I used reduced fat sour cream and it turned out great.  It was easy to make the night before and set it in the morning.  For the sauce I just mixed everything together and poured it over the beef.  Great recipe!

It was a very good stroganoff.  Instead of the sour cream, I put in a small can of tomato paste and served it on top of egg noodles.  Very easy to make.

Each Sunday AM I use my slow cooker for a prepared meal when I return from church at noon.  This is the best addition I've made in months.  Just boil the noodles and toss a salad!  What more can you ask?

This was great. I followed other reviewers tips and sauted the onions and mushrooms. I also substituted Johnsonville sausage in for the beef. It was fantastic. My little sister, who hates everything I cook generally, asked for seconds! She said it was "good," which from her is a huge compliment :-). I also had a huge Costco-sized thing of cheese tortellini, so I served the stroganoff over that.

I made this in a hurry and set the crock pot on high for 3 1/2 hrs and it came out great! I used the stew meat I had on hand and cut it up into small pieces. Didn't have wine at all but you couldn't tell. It turned out great! Thanks so much!! Made the house smell so wonderful even my dogs were begging for some!!

delicious. Used lager beer instead of wine. Turned out awesome, rich and creamy. It does not freeze/reheat well though (maybe because of the beer? )but all in all good when eaten fresh out of the slow cooker.

My D-I-L is pregnant with another grandbaby for me! I fill her crockpot twice a week to lighten her load a bit.  This was an E-Z and delicious winner.  Subbed the white wine with water.  She fills the rice cooker, steams the broccoli and supper is ready with little fuss.

The meat tasted amazing and the house smelled really good....but only3 stars due to lack of overall flavor. I tried some modifcation as suggested by other cooks and we were disapointed. It is missing SOMEthing...I just am not sure what it is. Also I did use fresh portabellas.

This was decent - it was pretty watery as far as the sauce was concerned.  It got better a day or two later as it thickened up.

Delicious. Thank you for taking the time to post this. I substituted fresh mushrooms for canned and dried parsley for fresh as it is New Years Day and I did not have any fresh parsley. Happy New Year

I wanted to lick my bowl after finishing this wonderful dish!  It was a little watery.   I  doubled  the recipe and added just under one cup of the sour cream and an entire package of cream cheese plus a tablespoon of  corn starch.  I'll need a rotter rooter for my arteries but this  is what you live for once in a while!   My dad LOVED it!

This recipe definitely has potential.  I found it very bland and will need to experiment with some ways to improve on the flavor.  More garlic is a start.

Cheap meal to make. I used a REAL cheap cut of meat, stew meat, that I bought on clearance. I sauteed it in butter after tossing it with the flour/salt/pepper before adding it to the crock to give it a nice flavor. I also used fresh mushrooms that I stirred in after sauteeing with the sour cream right before serving. We all ate up and were happy, and that's important. I served it with The Best Mashed Potatoes, which is also from this site, and steamed broccoli. NOTE: This made enough for dinner tomorrow and one packed lunch.

I made this for supper last night and we thought it was ok in the end.  I followed the recipe exactly with exception to adding 1 whole onion and used sirloin steak instead of round.  The final product was good - but not out of this world.  Thanks for the recipe, but I think I'll keep looking for my perfect stroganoff recipe.

Good base, and I'm grateful for it!  I searched for any easy stroganoff, with lots of stars! I made it as directed...EXCEPT for the soup. I don't like using cans of soup, used beef broth instead, happened to have some leftover red wine, and used 1/2sour cream and 1/2 block cream cheese. It was great!  Thanks again!

This meal went over very well with my husband and friend...with a few changes.  I cut the sour cream in half, as suggested several times and it was plenty creamy.  I also added the cream cheese, which was not needed.  I think it was too clumpy as it didn't mix in well.  Would have been fine without.  Added some extra garlic too.

really great taste! i must have added too much liquid somewhere b/c i had to add 2tbs of cornstarch to thicken it up at the end. left out the mushrooms. added extra onion. used stew meat. next time i will try the red wine and some cream cheese. served with whole wheat fettucini noodles and tasted even better once i tossed the cooked noodles in the crockpot and let them soak up the sauce. can't wait to see how great the leftovers are!

This is the best stroganoff recipe I've tried yet.  I had to stop myself from grabbing a third helping!  I will definitely continue to make this, and I didn't change a thing about the recipe.  it's perfect as is!

This is very good, although I did like others and used only 8 oz. of sour cream which is typical for a normal size recipe of beef stroganoff.  I used top round but to make it taste better, I browned the meat first then added it to the crock.  Browning improves flavor.  Also, I start my crock on high for 1 hour and then turn to low.  The meat came out real tender.  Top round is real lean.

YAAAY! Another keeper!!!  I trimmed and sliced up a rump roast that I had (bout 3 lbs) so I doubled the ingredients.  I sauteed the onions and garlic a bit before adding.  But because I precooked them, the onions almost disappeared into the gravy.  The next time I will add the onions half way thru cooking time if I can (or just not precook).  I omitted the chives and parsley (didn't have) and I also omitted the water (per other reviews).  Next time I will add extra flour (2 tbsp per 1/4 c) to the wine because it could have been a tad bit thicker.  I made egg noodles and mashed potatoes (one son doesn't like pasta).  I tried it both ways...my fave was the potatoes!  The meat was VERY tender, and the gravy was FANTASTIC.  I am planning on using the left over gravy and meat over biscuits..YUMMY!  Thanks so much Daria!!! 
**UPDATE** I made this again but I tried using healthy request soups and reduced fat sour cream.  It still came out good, but not AS sumptuous.  Next time I will still use the healthy request soups, but use regular sour cream.

I have made this twice now, once modified and the 2nd as it calls for, and I am not sure what it is, but there is a bitter taste that I just don't care for. Maybe it is the wine?

Nice recipe which worked great using leftover london broil. I added more seasonings than suggested, three cans of the mushroom soup, broth in lieu of the water and fresh mushrooms. The sauce was rich and delicious and loved by my family. Thanks Daria!

Loved it. I used the suggestions by reviewers, thickened it with a little cornstarh and used 1/2 the sour cream. My picky eaters cleaned their plates!

Good flavor and easy to make.  However, this was almost soup.  I even added cornstartch/water to thicken... did not help.  Will not make again.

Really really good! It was slightly bland, so I added lots of salt and pepper (I know it says "to taste", but I didn't put enough in at first and had to add more).
Maybe I'll try seasoning and browning the beef first next time. But anyway, even picky hubby came back for seconds and thirds. I will definitely make this again!

This was a delicious recipe.  I used the cornstarch instead of flour.  I also used top sirloin steak cut into serving size pieces (instead of strips).  Instead of sprinkling the meat with salt and pepper, I used lemon pepper.   I also left out the sour cream to cut down on the fat content.  The gravy was excellent over mashed potatoes.

This was pretty good.  I served it over noodles.  It had a certain bite to it and I think it was the white wine.  Next time I will leave that out and see if it makes a difference.

I needed recipes that called for white wine, and this came up. It's really easy to make, and tastes great! (better the next day, i think). My 5 yr old didnt care for the (canned) mushrooms, and would not eat it. But i loved it!

This was good.  I followed the recipe exactly, except as another reviewer suggested, added corn starch to thicken the sauce since it was pretty thin,  and it turned out fine.  As suggested, I used only 8oz of sour cream, but it didn't seem to taste like stroganoff is supposed to.  When I make next time, I will add the full amount of sour cream.

Great recipe, but definitely would cook it for less time next time. The meat was way overdone, but to be fair, I think slow cooking is not an exact science and I'm working with a new one that seems to be a bit more effective than my old one.

Very rich and full of flavor.  The only thing I did differently was to use half cream cheese, half sour cream, and probably only about a heaping tablespoon of chopped parsley.  The sauce was not thin at all perhaps because my slow cooker tends to cook on the hot side and is ginormous so the contents really didn't make up a very deep layer so it's possible excess liquid had just cooked off.  I really liked it and will make it again.

I saw how so many people made changes.  I really didn't.  I left out the mushrooms because I didn't have any.  I doubled the meat and added a bit more of the sauce...not quite doubled.  I doubled the wine (instead of water), the garlic, Lea and Perrins, etc.  Just made...more.  The only difference I made was we felt it needed more salt!  I made it with white wine...but normally with beef it should be red wine...so I'm trying that next time.  OH!  I did make one big change...used deer stew meat instead!  It's what this Texas girl already has in her freezer!  Good stuff.  Even hubby was eating it out of the pot...which makes me mad...

I never knew that this cut of meat would work bec I usually use chuck roast for my Stroganoff. This cut of meat is less expensive and it did turn out very tender. I did make a few changes, added more garlic and worcestershire, used fresh mushrooms, used red wine, added a block of cream cheese and halfed the sour cream. 6 hours on low and it come out perfect. This is an impressive meal and would be good to make for company.

This is an easy and tasty stew recipe that really isn't very much like stroganoff, except it uses sour cream. The sauce is enough for at least 2 or 2.5 pounds of meat.

We didn't really care for this.  It didn't taste bad, but it really just tasted like pot roast.  I would just make pot roast if I wanted this flavor.  I am going to stick with my regular stroganoff recipe.

This is so good. I only made little changes. I used fresh Mushrooms. I only put 8 ounces of sour cream. I also added a Tablespoon of Bisto Gravy mix. I served it over pasta. It tasted like rich people food. Awesome recipe!

This is so good, and easy to make. Great for when you are having guests over on a weeknight. I made this for my boyfriend for our first anniversary, he said it's the best he's ever had. I made 2 slight changes, nothing to actually change the recipe. I substituted red wine for white as that's what I had, and I browned the meat first, and added the water to the frying pan to get all of the good stuff off the bottom. I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I didn't notice it being runny, it was just right, and I used 1% sour cream. I will definitely be making this again.

I made this for the 2nd time last night. Once again I did not have any bullion. I used a touch more wine and sliced onion not chopped. I "nuked" till soft 1/4 block of cream cheese and added it to the sour cream. ONCE AGAIN it was wonderful! By the way, this time I was short on time and cooked it on high for 5 hours. Still....wonderful! This is the only beef stroganoff recipe for us now!

This was just average.  My kids didn't care for the texture of the steak after being in the crock pot for 6 hours.  They asked me to never make it again and please make my other beef stroganoff recipe next time.

This was excellent.   I made it exactly as stated and my only complaint is that it was all gone!  Next time I may double the sauce to make it go a little further so I can have some leftovers!

Four stars, since I made my own modifications per other reviewers' feedback.  Used precut stew meat which I seasoned w Montreal steak seasoning, salt and pepper. I didn't add the worcestershire sauce only because I didn't have it on hand, and I used only 8 oz of sour cream, which I whisked in during the last 30 mins of slow cooking.  Any more sour cream would probably have been too much and overwhelm the other flavors.  Instead of canned mushrooms, I sautéed baby portabellas, dried thyme, and added to the crock for the last 30 mins.  I found the sauce a little too thin for our liking, and used a few sprinkles of wondra flour to thicken it slightly.  Served over wide egg noodles, my husband really enjoyed it, it's a keeper!

Love this!  Thanks for sharing. the changes I made were to use beef stew meat, red wine, and I swap about half of the sour cream for  about 2 oz. cream cheese.  Just simple, homey flavors that I love and WAY easier than my mom's stove top version.

Unfortunately, even though I incorporated all the suggestions from other reviewers, this still lacked flavor.  I doubled the amount of onion, but the onion needs to be sauteed before putting in the slow cooker because it came out crunchy. I used golden mushroom soup like others suggested, and I doubled the amount of wine (and used red instead of white).  I tripled the worchestershire sauce and garlic.  I used beef stew meat and seaoned salt, and I used 8 oz. of sour cream and added 4 oz. of cream cheese during the last hour of cooking per others' suggestions.   I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  Still it lacked flavor and the meat was bland.

Honestly, this recipe was pretty average. The sauce was really watery and the recipe called for way too much sour cream. This method was definitely easier to make up and leave all day in the slow cooker, though.

Suggest using as small as crock as possible (my 6 qt was too big) otherwise it will cook too fast and the consistency will be closer to a chunky soup than stroganhoff.  Also, I would recommend cutting back on the sour cream to about half.

Extremely easy to prepare.

I followed JILLIESMOTHER's custom version, red wine instead of white, and cream cheese with less sour cream.  That version turned out excellent for me!

This dish was very tasty but the meat was not as tender as I wanted.  I am giving this dish 5 stars because the meat being tough has nothing to do with the taste of this recipe.  Next time I will sear the meat because I think it keeps the juices in the meat and tenderizers it.  I took the advice of others and used 4 oz. of cream cheese and 4 oz. of sour cream.  Loved the taste of the sauce.  I also used beef broth in place of the water and used fresh mushrooms.

I have to admit that I modified the recipe a bit based on other reviews-  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, 1/2 cup red wine instead of white, and just half the sour cream with the addition of 4 ounces of cream cheese.  I did use sliced top round steak and it came out very tender.  The aroma in the house while this was cooking all day made everyone hungry-  even my daughter and I who don't particularly care for beef!  Definitely would recommend.

I use a frozen round steak. Sub 1/2 cup red wine instead of the white, and sub beef broth for the water. I use fresh mushrooms and omit the flour, and add a little worstershire. otherwise I make as directed.  Very good, I have made this several times.

This was okay, but a little bland. I did make major changes because I didn't have all of the necessary ingredients. I did not have any onions, canned mushrooms, parsley, or chives. I used ground beef instead of top round steak. I used a tablespoon Worcestershire sauce and extra water with three splashes of red wine vinegar instead of white wine. I used a tablespoon of corn starch instead of flour and I used 8 ounces of sour cream instead of 16 ounces. I will try it again, but I will follow the directions more closely.

Wife liked it more than I did.  It was good but I like others better.  I was going to make the other that day but then I saw this recipe and tried it instead.  I'm not disappointed with this, but I like others better.  Make your pasta al dente and let this soak into the pasta in the pot for about 5 minutes.  Otherwise, it is too watery.

Bringing my Dad home forced us to take on more routine.  This was excellent - very tasty, not much prep time and nutritious served with No Yolks Egg Noodles.  We added steamed vegetables and bread-maker rustic white bread - what a feast to come home to!!!!

My husband loved this.  I used 2 lbs of beef round steak, 4 cloves of garlic (we like lots of garlic), 3/4 cup of wine, and about 2 tbs flour because I like the sauce thicker.  I stayed with the 16 oz sour cream (fat free), but may decrease that next time.

Followed the advice of another reviewer...I did use the top round steak, fairly inexpensive cut and not too fatty, instead of an onion I just put in a sprinkle of onion flakes (my husband doesn't like onion), no mushrooms cause hubby can't stand those either, instead of a clove of garlic, I had a jar of fresh minced garlic in the fridge so i just put in 1tsp., 1 tablespoon of worcestershire sauce instead of just a teaspoon, 1/2 cup of red wine instead of 1/4 cup of white wine and 1/4 cup of water, just 8 ounces of sour cream instead of 16oz.  I followed the same cooking directions. After all the alterations, it was very good and is a keeper for our family!

Made the recipe just as presented. Served this at a women's potluck.  A double recipe served 11 with more to spare. Absolutely loved it and had FABULOUS leftovers.

The wife hated the thought of beef stroganoff, but trusted me enough to try this. Let me say that she now wants beef stroganoff regularly!   We get half a cow every year and always are trying to find new ways to use our meat. This is one of the best recipes we've found yet for our round steaks. And because it's a slow cooker recipe, we don't have to fuss to be able to enjoy this during the busy week.   Plain and simple, this recipe was out of this world and full of flavor.

Exceptionally easy and delish.  I used stew beef to save money and since it is a slow-cooker recipe, it came out just fine.  Nice and tender!  Flavorful.  Absolutely easy and "Dummy-Proof."

Loved by all! My husband had 4 plates, and my children didnt even complain about the mushrooms!  A great way to use the cheaper cuts of beef, came out super tender, with that "fall apart" texture.

This is THE best stroganoff recipe I have ever come across!  After trying this, you won't have to look any further.  Trust me.

Hard to believe, but it finally happened.  I made a meal no one complained about, and everyone had seconds.  This is awesome.  Then only change I made was not to use the wine.  Cooking the meat in the slow cooker makes it so tender that it practically falls apart.  The sour cream adds just the right amount of tang and the spices were right on.  Thanks for such a delicious meal that was so easy to prepare!

Needs tweaking to go from okay to excellent.  More worchestershire, more onion, fresh mushrooms (I cooked them separate and added them toward the end), and cornstarch and cream cheese to thicken. I used all other ingredients as written; may substitute more wine for water next time too.

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I received many compliments on this dish! I didn't stray too much from the recipe although I did add more cloves of garlic, fresh versus dried chives (and more of it), more Worcestshire, and an additional beef bouillon cube. I also suggest lest sour cream.. I think it was too thick. Served with wheat egg noodles.. this dish is a win!!

So delish and easy to make!  My boyfriend literally was licking the plate after he had finished eating. I did make some small changes.  I used beef stew meat instead of the top round steak, skipped the onions because I am allergic to them and used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I also doubled the amount of garlic and added a tsp of Mrs. Dash's original blend seasoning.  I used red wine instead of white wine because I agree with other peopple who have reviewed this recipe, red wine is better for beef.  I followed other's advice and used 8oz sour cream and 8oz cream cheese.  I love love love this recipe.  Will be making it again and again and again.

Followed recipe exactly, and meat was too dry. Rest of family was also disappointed. Will not make again.  Will keep making my own recipe.

This was amazing! I did not have any wine so left it out; I'm sure that makes it even better :) I didn't realize someone had opened the sour cream until it was time to stir it in; I had half a container, so I added a little cream cheese to make it up. I forgot the parsley at the end too, but man this stuff is addicting!

Disappointing... this tasted good, but was very runny/soupy.  I had hoped the flour would thicken it up.  I wont make again.

Fantastic recipe!  Served this with egg noodles on the side at a church dinner.  Got rave reviews.  I made this recipe as directed except that I didn't have any cans of condensed mushroom soup, so I made my own.  [by melting 1 Tbsp butter in a saucepan and gradually stirring in 3 Tbsp flour until it made a smooth paste.  I combined 1/2 cup beef broth with 1/2 cup milk and added this liquid a little bit at a time to the flour paste stirring it to keep it smooth and letting it heat while stirring until it was as thick as I wanted it.  Then I added a small can of mushrooms, salt and pepper.]

Once again, another great recipe from allrecipes that is quick, easy and tasty!!  Like other comments already noted, this is watery so next I make it I'll omit the water.  I added additional flour and it thickened up.  This will definately be on the top of the list for easy winter meals.

We liked it. The slow cooker helped the Round Steak get tender and the flavors were good. I did substitute it with fresh mushroom & cut the sour cream in half & added cream cheese. Worth a try!

My boyfriend made this for me at my suggestion. He followed Sara's recipe in the 8/07 review but used 1/2 red onion and 1/2 white onion. It was excellant. Good flavor. Suggestion...use a dry wine.

I give this five stars simply because this is one of the best tasting slow-cooker recipes we have tasted. I still prefer non-slow-cooker beef stroganoff recipes over this, but from the perspective of convenience and taste, it's a keeper!

Yummy! After reading other reviews and from the amount of liquid left in the crockpot after cooking the beef, I was afraid the sauce would be too runny after adding the sour cream. I mixed  two heaping tablespoons of flour into the sour cream before adding it to the beef mixture. It came out to a perfect consistency for Stroganoff sauce. Will make this tasty dish again, especially when the temp gets out of the 90's!

This was a pretty good recipe but I think I will stick to the stove-top version next time.  I used sirloin steak and wish it hadn't falled apart so much- it turned too beef stew-y for me.  I also omitted the chives and white whine and used fat free sour cream.  I served it over buttered penne noodles.  I did like this enough to have it for leftovers the next day but not a third.

Made this with a 2.5 lb  eye of the round roast and fresh mushrooms. Cooked it on low for 6 hours. SPECTACULAR!

I rate this five stars with a few modifications, which kind of defeat the ease of the original recipe, but I think added to the flavor and consistency.  I sauteed the onions and fresh mushrooms before adding them.  I omitted the water (based on reviews that it was too soupy), and mixed in two tablespoons of flour with red wine because that is what I had on hand.  It came out nice and thick and very tasty!

This was a good recipe.  I tweaked it a bit though.  I used 1/2 the sour cream and didn't add the wine (don't like the taste).  The sauce was not thick enough for me, so I added a bit of corn starch at the end.  My husband loved the dish and it has been put in to the family recipe box.

Good recipe, but I felt it needed more flavor. I added more worcestershire, garlic & a whole onion.  Accidentally used fat free mushroom soup & it worked great! Towards the end of cooking I added two capfuls of gravy master for color & flavor as well as cornstarch to thicken.  Way too soupy!  I served it over garlic butter egg noodles.  Delicious!

This is by far the best crockpot recipe I have made so far from AllRecipes.com!  That is one big compliment, Daria!  It was a bit soupy, like other reviewers wrote.  So I just added corn starch when I added the sour cream and parsley.  It thickened up just perfect.  This is also a great way to use London Broil (top round steak) differently than the standard "marinate overnight and grill".

Oh man is this one a keeper!  What a great recipe for such an inexpensive cut of meat (our supermarkets often have bogo specials).  It's so savory and aromatic and best of all cooked in one pot so cleanup is a breeze.  We use wheat noodles (believe me the added taste is to die for) and I've used low-fat sour cream with no change in taste from the high fat kind.  I've also used white cooking wine with great results (may need to adjust salt content if you use).  Definitely give this recipe a try!

This recipe is very good.  My husband is a big stroganoff fan and he really liked it.  However, 16 ounces of sour cream seemed like a lot to me so I added only half of the sour cream and thought it was plenty creamy.

Fantastic AND easy.  I used round steak instead of roast; I dipped the steak pieces in flour and fried in oil for a few minutes before putting them in the slow cooker, just to preserve the color and taste.  The whole family loved this - even my finicky eater.

Good recipe. My family loved it!The meat is so tender that it just falls apart. The one thing that I did different is that I thought I had egg noodles and didn't so I replaced them with mashed potatoes. Served with a big salad and garlic bread  it turned out to be a great meal!! Thanks for the recipe.

This was very tasty.  I made this for my family and they all enjoyed this.  Even my picky husband.  I used low sodium/low fat mushroom soup and low fat sour cream; skipped the chives because I didn't have them and skipped the parsley because I forgot to buy it.  The parsely would add nice color to the dish.  I'll definitely make this again!

VERY Tasty recipe.  It was easy to make and the meat was fork-tender.  I used fresh mushrooms and omitted the wine (which I am sure didnt affect the taste whatsoever).  I will surely use this again and again.  I served over egg noodles and also used it leftover the next day on rice.  Very good!

Great recipe! I did cheat a little bit, I do not care for canned mushrooms so I used fresh mushrooms. I used veal instead of beef round steak because I had a lot of veal that I wanted to use up. I also did not have any egg noodles or noodles of any sort so I peeled and quartered potatoes and added them to the crock pot with all the other ingredients. Worked quite well but next time I will make sure I have egg noodles available.

I replaced the flour with 2 tbs of corn starch and eliminated the extra water. The meat and the fresh mushrooms I used made more than enough liquid. This recipe is quite tasty and easy.

This was really delicious and really easy to make!  I used a nice Merlot instead of white wine and liked the flavor.  The only other difference was dried parsley.  Everything else I left the same.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks, Daria!  Everyone enjoyed this!

I used flank steak and fresh sliced mushrooms, because that's what I had on hand, a bit more fresh garlic (because I don't measure often) when I mixed the meat with salt and pepper, and replaced flour with corn starch.  Otherwise, I kept the recipe the same (ok, more like a half cup of white wine and my onions cut in circles because half the fam doesn't like them and they're easier to take out).  It was amazing.  It could have been done in 4-5 hours on low, but I left it in for 7 and it was still amazing.  My multi function pressure cooker is 1000x better at maintaining moisture and temp then a crock pot.  Awesome.  Added into the fall/winter rotation :)

I've made this over a dozen times and for my family, it's a big hit mainly because of the adjustments. 

I double all the ingredients except the meat. It makes it creamy, tasty and there is a lot of leftovers. 

I also prefer to pat dry my meat first and sear it before putting it in the crockpot. It has made a difference in flavor too.

Delicious!  And easy! Definitely going to be put into regular rotation at our house.
A few changes I made: I used fresh mushrooms and they turned out really well.  Also added a little cream cheese, to thicken it up a bit, but I should have mixed it in with the sour cream better before adding it; the cream cheese stayed clumpy.  
One change I'll make next time is using a less expensive cut of beef.  It just ended up disintegrating in the slow cooker, though I did put it on high for an hour to jump start the process (didn't have the full 6-7 hours the recipe called for) so that probably effected it.

I made this last night, but did alter some ingredients based on other recommendations.  Didn't use water, bouillon or wine--substituted 1/2 cup beef broth instead.  Upped Worcestershire to 1 Tbsp, upped garlic to two cloves, and added 1 Tbsp cornstarch with flour & beef broth.  Decreased sour cream to 8 ounces and added 4 ounces cream cheese.  Came out really good but wasn't happy with the meat consistency.  Next time will try using ground beef (pre-browned).  Overall, very good recipe!  Thanks for posting and to all those who suggested modifications!

This was good, but for some reason my onions didn't get done enough.  Weird.  I thought it was tasty, but nothing to write home about.  I followed the recipe (except used the homemade cream of anything mix from this site for the canned soup).  I also used a pound of fresh mushrooms.

I also used half of the sour cream that the recipe called for and the only wine I had in the house was Lambrusco so tried that. It turned out so amazing that I will keep using the Lambrusco and not even try white wine. My husband and I agree that this is the best beef stroganoff we have ever had.

This is such a delicious comfort food recipe!  Hubs loved this and declared it a "10".  I followed the recipe very closely, only tweaks were using stew meat cut pretty thinly and...big one... only added about 4 oz sour cream.  I don't like an overwhelming sour cream taste and like to taste more "beefiness".  Served over buttered kluski noodles.  Thanks to Amanda from the Buzz for this recommendation, and thanks for sharing your recipe with AR, Daria.  It's a keeper!

It was tasty, I will probably add more seasoning and more flower to thicken the sauce, since adding stock instead beef bouillon gave me more juice. I followed suggestions for cream cheese which added side more flavor. Egg noodles goes well with the dish. Thank you for sharing.

Made this recipe as directed. We didn't care for it at all. Very bland...had to add a TON of salt and pepper to get it to a point where it was even bearable. Will not be making this again.

Fantastic!  Like most others, I made several changes.  Instead of a half onion, I used a whole one.  Tripled the garlic, used whole milk instead of water, added some chicken broth, about 3 tablespoons of gravy browner, half a package of onion soup mix, instead of steak I used stewing beef, I halved the sour cream and added a heaping tablespoon of corn starch.  This is a really good base recipe.  Very tasty indeed.  This was a big hit at my house.  I will make this again for sure!!

2014 - Hubby and I really liked this.  Flavors were a little too grown up for the kids.  I used Golden Mushroom soup, 2 gloves garlic and almost a T of Worcestershire sauce.  Delish!
2015- This time my kids loved it!  They even licked their plates.  I don't use canned mushrooms, instead I use a few fresh sliced mushrooms.  Also, substituted half cream/half water for the wine.  Served over rice.

Absolute favorite crockpot recipe.  Like others, I add a little here or there-for instance, I used more beef today, so, more moisture was released and I needed another tablespoon of flour to thicken.  But, there really is no messing this up.  My entire family loves it including 2-year-old twins.  Be sure to use a dryer wine.  You won't want to put a sweet wine in this recipe.  We serve it over No-Yolks extra wide noodles with butter.  It is always a hit.

I truly loved it.  It was so easy to prepare and lost none of the flavor or presentation of "real" stroganoff. I didn't change this recipe at all.How can you go wrong with any recipe calling for onions, mushrooms (and a splash of red)?   Hard as it is for me to believe, I'm at the stage when I have to be very careful in the kitchen. I have never been a slow-cooker-devotee, but am now looking for things like this that, hopefully, I won't burn.  I need all the help I can get.Thanks for sharing.

We really liked this recipe.  I did make some adjustments based on other reviews.  I used about 2 oz cream cheese in the recipe. I didn't add the sour cream until I dished mine up because my DH and DD aren't wild about it.  I think it would be better with red wine, but didn't see that review until I'd already used white.  So, I just added a splash of red, too, while it was cooking.  That worked just fine.  No chives on hand, but I would have used them if available.  Next time I may brown the meat first, but part of using the slow cooker is not having to do a lot of prep work that makes more dirty dishes, so I'm not sure. I had stew meat on hand so that's what I used.  Thanks for the recipe!

It came out amazing in the pressure cooker and very tasty.  Pressure cook for 18 minutes at pressure instead of slow-cooking, but otherwise the directions are the same.  The pressure really forces the flavors into the beef and it's absolutely delicious that way.  This recipe should be OK in a 4-quart pressure cooker; if you double it, you probably need at last a 6-quart.

Also, the beef came out amazing when I slightly browned the outsides of the strips first before cooking anything else.  I added about 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan and stirred the beef strips often till most surfaces had brown on the outside.  This helps to seal the juice in the beef.  I suppose it's possible to sautee the mushrooms and onions while doing this too.  It can't hurt but I didn't do that.

I used a London broil for this, it worked really well. I left out the chives and parsley since I didn't have any, and only used half the sour cream. My 9 year old took one bite and wouldn't eat anymore. My 14 year old ate his own and his brother's so I guess it evens out! I enjoyed it, although I could really taste the wine, I guess the kind I used has kind of a strong flavor.

I made this for New Year's Day, but made it a bit healthier (so I could feel like I was keeping my weight-loss resolution). :)  I used lean SIRLOIN steaks, LIGHT sour cream (only used 1/2 the container), Campbell's Healthy Request (low fat, low sodium) cream of mushroom soup, and FRESH mushrooms. The meat was tender and the flavor of the stroganoff sauce was rich and delicous! Will most certainly make this again!

My husband made this while I was at work. My kids and husband loved this served over egg noodles. I followed the recipe exactly and I liked the sour cream as written. I loved sour cream so if you aren't a fan it might be overpowering. I would make it again.

I tried this recipe twice- the first time was great, but the second time was even better with a slight variation. I added 1 tablespoon instead of one teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, and also added a teaspoon of prepared mustard. My family loved it- ate the whole thing.

Very good - I didn't think I'd like it as I usually bypass cream-of-soup based recipes, but the whole family liked this. I used fresh mushrooms and added them closer to the end. Also used beef broth in stead of boullion & water. The meat came out perfectly for me. And how can you go wrong with 16 oz of sour cream :)

This was my first attempt at this dish. My family was incredibly tentative to try it because they had made it for years and me being the daughter of "gourmets" (tsk) but I gave them no choice! It looked easy enough and so I gave it a go. They LOVED it so much I am making it as we speak just one week later and I am surrounded by adoring fans. Thank you so much for putting this up! I make it EXACTLY like Daria with one teensy exception. I cut the white wine in half this time. Bon Apetit and thanks again!

This was very easy to make, but I did double all the ingredients like another reviewer suggested. Family loved it though.

My family really enjoyed this - as suggested used beef stew meat, whole onion, fresh shrooms, fresh chives, 3oz sour cream, couple dollups of sour cream.  I used the white wine instead of water throughout and it came out great.  In crockpot for about 10 1/2 hours on low and it was a big hit.

My neighbors asked what was cooking. This smelled so delicious that I had a hard time waiting the full 6 hours to eat it. I managed to control myself and it was worth the wait. I'm giving this 4 stars only because the recipe as written is a little 'off' with the flavor and it's too much liquid for the amount of meat. I made adjustments based on other comments (red wine instead of white, a little cornstarch, fresh mushrooms, etc). I also seasoned it a bit more because I like bold flavors. We had some leftovers that went uneaten, but I won't hold it against the recipe :)

I sauted the onion, garlic, and mushrooms first in butter and white wine then added it on top of the sirlon steak.  Our whole family ate and enjoyed, but was not the prettiest meal I have made.

Very tasty flavor.  Took over reviewers suggestions. Doubled the amount of meat. Seared meat in marinate of soy sauce, garlic powder, wine, red pepper flakes before place it into crock  pot.  After 4 1/2 hrs of cooking, meat was already very tender. Then added the sour cream about 12 oz.  Cooked for another 45 mins. Sauce still runny so I added a mixture of wine & cornstarch to thicken it a little. Do not like very thick gravy-like sauce. Omitted chive,beef bouillon and parsley.

Good. Next time I think I will brown the steak first. It was a little too mushy for me. I ended up taking it out of the crock pot after 8 hours and cooking it on the stove for a while so the meat wasn't as mushy. It was still very tender.

I used red wine instead of white, and had cream cheese, but no sour cream. No matter, it turned out so good my 11-year-old is right now having it for breakfast, and my 5-year-old exclaimed !mm! smells good! when she smelled the heated breakfast. Thanks Daria, in this house, this one's a keeper! UPDATE: Actually that 11-yr-old wanted it again, but I had no mushrooms or c of m. So I made it using celery and c of celery, again no sour cream, so quite a departure from the original stroganoff, but I thought I'd share this tip because it was pronounced "even better than the other day." So there you go, two variations on a great original. Thanks Daria!

Good easy recipe. I accidently forgot to put in the cream cheese and it still was good. I did however add a can of mushrooms and Tony Chachere's seasoning. It spiced things up a bit.

I marinated 4lbs beef/3 onions/6 cloves of pressed garlic/6 green peppers overnight in about 1/3 C soy sauce and 1 can of beef broth.   I still used just 1 can soup; and added another can of beef broth into the slow cooker,  no sour cream (I used a brick of cream cheese AFTER I shut the slow cooker off—you don’t want to slow cook the cream cheese – I used the low fat).  I didn’t use any wine either….  I added flour as needed (probably 1/3 Cup).

Amazing!  I made a few slight changes based on other reviews but basically kept the recipe the same.  Omitted the wine and water and used 1/2 cup beef broth, instead.  Also used 1/2 brick of cream cheese and no sour cream.  Entire family loved it!!!

Great flavour. I didn't add enough beef though so it was too saucy. Great over noodles or toast. Love that it is a throw-in-the-crockpot-and-go meal.

This was really good. I used stew meat instead of the round steak because that was on sale at the store. Added in fresh mushrooms halved the last 30 minutes since I do not like them cooked to mush and the rest of the family can pick them out easier. Only used 8 ounces of light sour cream and the consistency turned out perfect. Used red wine instead of white cause that is what I had.  Served over egg noodles. The whole family loved it.

I seasoned pretty heavily with salt/pepper/garlic powder, otherwise it seemed a little bland.  Also used fresh mushrooms so I put it in with the sour cream.  Otherwise very tasty and so easy to throw in the morning and have ready for dinner.  Thanks!

I added GREEN PEPPERS and left out the white wine and just used water in place of it.  I also put this over white rice and my family asked me to make this a weekly dinner!  There are 4 of us and I didn't have left overs it was THAT good!  Very easy to make...no sweat!  Enjoy!

this was great! First time trying stroganoff.  used fresh mushrooms only, cooked for about 6 hours (a double recipe in a huge slow cooker).  I think next time I would buy smaller egg noodles but it was great and everyone enjoyed it!

I loved this stroganoff recipe. I did make some changes that made it 5 stars. The changes included 1/2 cup water, 1 tbsp beef bouillon, 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 4 oz fresh mushrooms (in addition to the canned mushrooms; added with sour cream, cream cheese, and parsley at 1 hour marker), and 3 oz cream cheese. I also used rigatoni noodles instead of egg noodles. We loved it and the left overs were just as tasty!

We loved this dish. Precooked the meat with flour, salt & pepper the night before. Cut the sour cream in half, ommited the chives and added 4 oz. chive flavored cream cheese. Definitely will make this recipe again and again!

Excellent.  Couple of changes.  1) added Lipton onion soup mix and a good shake of garlic powder at the beginning of cooking and 2) fresh mushrooms the last two hours of cooking.  FANTASTIC!  even better than my stove top version and much easier.  Thanks for sharing!

Good dish for the crock pot.  I made a few changes as did others and used stew meat which came out very tender and 8oz. of sour cream versus 16.  I only had white wine on hand, but I agree that red wine should be added.

Excellent!  I couldn't find Sara's suggestions and made minimal changes:  used sirloin, browned it first, red wine instead of white, golden cream of mushroom instead of regular and fresh mushroom.  Served at a dinner party for upscale and fussy guests and everybody loved it

I followed exactly the changes by Sara as so many suggested. Very tasty, my husband had three helpings.  I also made this vegetarian by just adding more mushrooms without the meat for my daughter and I who are vegetarians and it was very good.  I used lowfat sour cream in both and it was fine.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

My family loved this. I thought it was good but the meat didn't get as tender as I'd like and the sauce wasn't thick. I would use sirloin next time instead of round steak, and add cornstarch in lieu of flour since the sauce didn't thicken enough. I didn't add the chives or parsley but I didn't miss them either.

I used this recipe for a friend who's just had a baby - they loved it, but I must admit that I tweaked the recipe a bit!!!  I had swiss steak on hand and it turned out sooooo tender in this dish.  Also used fresh mushrooms and chives...stirred slightly cooked egg noodles in w/ only 8oz sour cream toward the end of the cooking time...and I didn't have fresh parsley to top it off...

I love this recipe!  It's sooo simple and very flavorful.  The only changes I made were using 1 lb sirloin instead of round steak, 1 whole onion, fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and 1/2 cup of sour cream instead of the whole cantainer.  Delicious!

This didn't get as thick as thick as I expected form the pictures but it was delicious and extremely easy to make. I left out the fresh parsley and it was just divine.

I use this recipe pretty much as is.  Only changes I make is I use beef stew meat, 8 oz sour cream, no mushrooms (soup is enough for me), and I don't measure anything.  If it looks like enough it probably is.  Never had any problems that way and I love this.  In fact I'm making it tomorrow.

I used a bottom round roast which is a cheaper and sometimes tougher cut of meat. With this recipe the meat was really tender and juicy. Also I didn't have bouillon cubes, and I used twice as much wine. It still turned out great!

I knew this was going to be good when I lifted the lid about 7 hours into cooking.  Even without the sour cream, the sauce was really good.  I have never put a flour mixture into a slow cooker like this recipe calls for but it worked beautifully.  I intend to use that the next time I make stew or soup.  We never have wine around the house so I had to leave that out but I'd be curious to try it and see if we like that better.  Other than that--and using stew meat--I followed the recipe pretty closely and I thought it was a great dish.

This was so far the best stroganoff recipe I've used on this website. Not an authentic since authentic is done on the stove top.

Was better the 2nd day... would consider braising the beef next time first because the meat tasted bland even in the sauce. Would make again. Added lots of fresh mushrooms about 1 hour before eating.

My husband LOVED this meal....he loves stroganoff and I don't so I surprised him with this.  I used beef stew meat, fresh mushrooms (added just a couple of hours before serving), red wine instead of white, 8oz of sour cream and 4 oz. of cream cheese.  I served it over homemade egg noodles and was surprised that even I like it!  The only thing I'll do a little differently next time is cut back a little on the cream cheese (2 - 3 oz rather than 4).

A keeper! I used 1/4 cup of red wine instead of white and it worked out fine and probably gave a more pleasing color.  I used 2 t. worcestershire and 2 beef bouillon and only 8 oz. of sour cream.  This gave the recipe the perfect amount of flavor.  Cooked a total of 7 hrs on low and it was very tender.

problem was that it was sooo good that I cound not stop tasting it!  Couldnt rate on the length of time b/c it was completely gone after 5 hours. Between my hubby and daughter along with my multiple "just a quick taste" tests.....there was none left by 5:30.  I would double at least the meat and add another tbsp of the worcestershire sauce.  I used two beef bullion cubes and 4oz of cream cheese with only 4 oz sour cream....and i cat imagine it being any creamier.  A touch of gravy masters makes the color a little more appealing. Yum!

WE THOUGHT THIS WAS A PRETTY GOOD DISH AND I DID MAKE A COUPLE OF MINOR CHANGES. I DID NOT USE ANY WINE AND I ONLY USED 1/2 CONTAINER OF SOUR CREAM AND IN THIS RECIPE YOU REALLY NEED TO USE A GOOD BRAND OF SOUR CREAM AS YOU CAN REALLY TASTE IT WELL. OH YEA ONE OTHER CHANGE I MADE IN MINE WAS I USED STEW MEAT AND IT WAS REALLY GOOD AND TENDER. MY HUBBY LOVES STROGANOFF SO I WAS LOOKING FOR A GOOD ONE.

Pretty good recipe. I had to make a few modifications but all in all it was fine. Kids ate it without complaint - which is always a good thing. I used one can of cream of chicken soup (all I had) and one can of cream of mushroom. I used canned mushrooms too. I mixed cooked egg noodles right into the crockpot and served it from the cooking bowl. Made for a quick dinner after sports practices.

My main objective was to used some chopped venison left from last year's deer hunting season, (the next feverish season is just around the corner! Have to use it up!) 
This recipe has a great flavor with some added tweeks. I try to read a bunch of recipes and extract a bit of each one. I used 8 oz. sour cream and 4 oz. cream cheese - I HIGHLY recommend you mix the two together before adding it to the beef mixture, for a smoother texture. I used fresh chives/green onions, as well as fresh mushrooms. A whole onion also went into it. Garlic powder and onion powder to taste as well as various other spices that I really can't recall. Instead of water, I used white zinfandel and some beef broth. I made egg noodles to serve this tasty dish over. One thing I would do differently next time would be to make the sauce thicker. I may also brown up the venison before tossing it into the slow cooker. 
My reason for choosing the slow-cooker way is because venison needs to cook for a long time to make it nice and tender. (I've heard many a complaint from people who try to cook venison and say that it tastes 'gamey'.) If you do it right it has an even better flavor than beef. 
Oh, and I complimented this savory meal with some garlic, parmesan, and mozzarella bread. Homemade of course!

Definitely try this and enjoy!

I read a lot of reviews before making this dish. I used the top round and it was a little tough so if I make it again, I will use a cheaper cut of meat since that's traditionally what you do in the crock pot. I also used a whole onion as well as half a package of fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I increased the worcestershire to a tablespoon and would probably add even more next time. I also used beef broth instead of the white wine because I didnt' have any on hand. The most important thing is to cut the sour cream in half. I couldn't imagine making it with that much since the sour cream taste was quite stong already with just 8 ounces! I too served this over buttered egg noodles. All in all, it was a pretty good and certainly easy recipe, but I might just stick with my mom's stove top method of cooking stroganoff.

I loved this recipe.  It was so easy and it was so tasty.  The only thing I changed was I used half the wine called for.  I normally use wine sparingly because I am afraid of over powering my meals (been burned on other recipes in the past). The recipe would have been just fine with the whole amount called for.

I made this recently and it went over quite well. I didn't have steak so I used ground beef, cooked and drained. B/c the meat was already cooked I only slow cooked the sauce/meat mixture for 2 hrs on high. Then I added 4 oz cream cheese along with the sour cream (8 oz light) and 8 oz par-cooked egg noodles and continued cooking for another 30 to 45 minutes. To the sauce I added another can of cream of mushroom soup, 2 extra cans of sliced mushrooms, used beef broth instead of wine, water and bouillon, increased the garlic to 2 cloves and the Worcestershire sauce to 1 Tbsp. The only complaint I had was that it needed more sour cream; maybe b/c I used light. I would use the full amount of light sour cream (16 oz) next time. Anyway, still pretty good and something I'll be making again I'm sure:)

Daria, this is a great Stroganoff recipe.  Top round steak works just fine.  The only thing I do is use a whole onion instead of a half.  Otherwise, it's the best Beef Stroganoff I have found.  And it's cooked all day long in the slow cooker, so my house smells wonderful all day long!~

I've tried quite a few Stroganoff recipes in my day and this one is right up there!  Beef Stroganoff is one of my favs, so I'm always looking for the best.  This recipe is really, really great!!

This turned out great, even though I missread the instructions for the liquid :) 
I'm normaly very wary of recipes that use tinned soup for ingredients but this worked so well that it will be one of my staple slow cooker recipes.
Thank you

I used fresh mushrooms, red wine instead of water, and ground beef (as it was all I had on hand). Very nice flavour, we will definitely keep this recipe around and use it again.

This was tasty!  I used leftover steak and was worried that it might turn out too dry, but it was not at all!  I will definately try again - I was out of chives and think that would taste great!

Very tasty.  Deinately add the salt when you add the beef, as it needs it.  I also used the garlic cream of mushroom soup, which added a little flavor.  Following other reviews, I added a whole onion, added 1/2 cup of red wine instead of the water and white wine, and used fresh mushrooms added at the last hour in lieu of the canned.

Easy and delicious, I highly recommend this recipe for Stroganoff.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using red wine, adding one more garlic clove, and mixing together the ingredients in step one before pouring them over the beef and onions in the pot.
Served over noodles, this dish was full of wonderful flavor.  Enjoy!

Really good!  As usual, made some changes according to previous reviews (S&P, beef bouillion, jarred mushrooms as didn't have fresh), and worked great.  Will definitely do again.

Very good. Instead of chives, I added parsley and used Marsala Wine for the wine. Instead of mushrooms in the can, I added fresh mushrooms and 2 tbsp of flour to thicken up the sauce. It was a very filling meal & I highly recommend it.

Very good and easy. I love the slow cooker. By the time you get to dinner, it's almost as if someone else made it. As per some of the previous reviews, I switched to fresh mushrooms ( no more work if you buy the precleaned, presliced ones) and used only 8 oz of sour cream. It didn't look too pretty, but it smelled divine and tasted good. Thanks for the great recipe.

The dish tasted really good. However, I followed the recipe almost exactly and there seemed to be too little meat and too much liquid.  I think the cooking time is also a little long.  While the meat was still tender, it probably could have come out at least an hour earlier, in my opinion.  Good recipe.  Just needs a few modifications.

This is a great recipe! I do however add a bit of cream cheese to thicken a bit and make it a really creamy sauce!  I also used fresh mushrooms and fresh chives and used the Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic instead of the regular stuff.  

I have this in the crockpot now and boy does my house smell good! Can't wait for dinner!

Since Ive been cooking regularly and getting good at it Ive been trying different things.  I havent had Stroganoff since I was younger so I was pretty excited and waited the whole 8hrs to try it.  We ate it but cant say anything good about.  Not worth the wait!

When I say good, I mean good -- thank you so much for this posting -- first time I EVER made beef stroganoff and my son actually said it was better than his grandma's!!!!  Absolutely delightful, moist, tender meat, I did season meat with Lawry's season salt and only used 1/2 the sour cream (the wine really does "sour" it up a bit). Thank you again -- I WILL make this again and again!!!!  Oh, served it on thick homemade noodles -- absolutely divine!  Note:  What's stroganoff without green olives?  I added about 3/4 cup sliced green olives with pimento.

I've made this twice now. Once I followed exact and the 2nd time I altered it. The first time was fantastic. The 2nd time was good as well, but I didn't have mushrooms or cream of mushroom. I used cream of potato instead and just increased the bullion to compensate for the lack of flavor from not having the right ingredients. This recipe is extremely adaptable and very forgiving.

This was a good recipe, but I would try to thicken the sauce a bit next time.  I used 1/2 the sour cream, and didn't add the white wine.  I think I will try a different beef stroganoff recipe next time.

This was excellent! The changes I made were: I changed was fresh mushrooms instead of canned, ommitted the water and used about 12 oz of sour cream instead of 16. Delish! Thanks for sharing!

Make sure you stir the items before you cover to cook.  Used low fat sour cream, and beef base instead of boullion.  Very good.  Will make again.

This was great.  I made some changes as suggested by other viewers plus some of my own.  I used fresh mushrooms.  Instead of 1/4 c. water and 1/4 c. white wine I used 1/2 c. white cooking wine.  I used Wondra to thicken instead of flour.  I added some Dijon mustard and some worcheshire.  I cooked overnight.  Added the sour cream after I reheated it the next day for dinner.  Served over whole wheat wide egg noodles.  Was delicious left over also.

This sauce did not have enough 'body' for our liking, I will try again omitting the water and using only 1/2 the amount called for of sour cream.

This was pretty good, but I forgot to add in the sourcream (that would have made a HUGE difference!).  The meat was a little too tough for my liking also... I will be trying to make it again with all the right ingredients!

For some reason my sauce was too thin and the parsley gave it an aftertaste.

I will try it again and add less parsley and less liquid.

My family liked this but I am a little harder to please. Used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, nothing replaces fresh! Otherwise I folowed directions to a tee. I simply like the stove top version better. Yet this got 4 stars because of it's simplicity. Thank you Daria for offering a quick version which I will more than likely use again. If it made my boys happy then I'm happy!

This is the best and so easy.  At first the chives and parsley threw me, but wow are they a great flavor addition to what some think is a bland meal.  Excellent.
Thank you for the new addition to my menu.

My family and I really enjoyed this beef stroganoff, and I was especially happy with it. I really loved the convenience of putting it in my slow cooker. It was extremely delicious and very easy to make. I used cubed stew meat and pre-cut onions, so aside from chopping mushrooms I had very little to do as far as extra work. I didn't change much at all with this recipe; I only used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and put in extra Worcestershire sauce. We served it over noodles and it was so tangy and savory. Very wonderful and will definitely make again.

WOW! Great recipe! I did not have time to cook in slow cooker so instead I added an additional 1/4 cup water and an additional bullion cube and then I did not have any white wine so I added a 1/2 cup of half and half instead.  I also added 3 Tbsp Fleischmann's stick margarine.  I combined everything in a saucepan and cook on low for about 45 minutes. I heated frozen meatballs in the oven and served with egg noodles.  YUM!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe!  Threw all but the sour cream in the slow cooker the night before, and I think it gave the beef extra flavour. I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  The whole family raved.

Added fresh baby bella mshrooms at the end and about 2 TBL tomato sauce (to add color) and used more meat than the receipe called for. With a spectacular salad and crusty bread, this makes a great company meal.

I enjoyed this, but thought it was a little runnier than I like.  I usually prefer my stroganoff to be thicker.  I'm going to experiment with a little more flour to see if that helps.  Enjoyed the wine flavor in it though - thanks!

Fantastic!! My whole family loved it. The meat was so tender and it smelled so good cooking. My husband wanted it for breakfast when he smelled the ingredients going into the pot! We definitely will have this one again. (I did go easy on the sour cream and didn't add the full amount.)

Very easy since you just put the ingredients in the cooker and wait. I prefer fresh mushrooms over canned and altered the onions to taste, but otherwise I followed the directions. It turns out wonderful but doesn't really hold up well as leftovers.

We LOVE this dish! It's super easy too - just throw everything into the slow cooker in the morning and it's done at dinner time. All you are left to do is boil the noodles. 

I usually add some chopped celery, carrots, and fresh mushrooms (instead of the canned) to sneak in some veggies where the kids don't even notice them.

Pretty good - average slow cooker recipe. I used fresh mushrooms and only 8 ounces of light sour cream which was plenty.  I think 16 ounces would be far too much.  I also thickened the gravy at the end with cornstarch.

Although this was an easy recipe to put together, I was disappointed in the end result.  I use my slow cooker quite regularly but I will go back to my stove to make my beef stroganoff from now on.  The taste just didn't do it for me.

This will be in the "family favorites".  My boyfriend and I loved it even more than a beef modern recipe I've always done from my mother! And, that says a lot!  I had made a lot of substitutions with this one (because I didn't have the ingrediants, but was deseparate to try it anyway).  The major substitutions were red wine instead of white, and cream of chicken soup (instead of mushrooms - I don't care for mushrooms at all).  And, believe it or not, these substitutions still made it fine.  It was wonderful!!!!  Served with EGG NOODLES!

It was quick and easy to make, but tasted like it was missing something.  Not sure what though....recipe needs a little tweeking.  A little more garlic purhaps...not sure.  Had it over rice,It was good, but I'd like something with a little more flavor.

Very easy and tasty.  I added a 10 ounce package of slice mushrooms rather than the canned.  It seemed very soupy to me, so I boiled egg noodles and added them in at the end (rather than just serving the stroganoff over the noodles).

This was very good for a busy evening;  I wouldn't call it spectacular, but tasty and easy.  Followed the recipe exactly, except for only using 8 oz of fat-free sour cream.  Along with the fat-free soup and well-trimmed meat, this wasn't nearly as sinful as it tasted!  I'd suggest adding the parsley after serving, just because it might look more attractive.  Great over egg noodles, and reheated well over steamed rice, too.

I made this for my husband-he is the world's pickiest eater! He ate two bowls and went back for leftovers a few hours later.  The sauce was so delicious-very rich and creamy! I only made two small changes-I added a little extra white wine when I added the sour cream, and I didn't have any parsley, so I added some fresh basil that I needed to use up.  DELICIOUS!!! This will become a staple!

this was pretty good. i used beer (newcastle brown ale) instead of wine and beef broth instead of water.  golden cream of mushroom soup and fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  and since we dont really like mushrooms, but know the flavor is vital to stroganoff which we love (i know, contradictory, but what can i say!) i only used 3.  it was fine.  mine was a little runny, but thats prob due to the fact that i 'eyeball' ingreds, i never measure.

Everyone in my family loves this dish. I add a little more wine when I add the sour cream. The meat is very tender and delicious!


Edit 2016: I am still making this dish - thanks Daria! 
The only change I have made over the years is to leave out the can of soup. I haven't cooked with a "cream of ___" in years. In this case, I don't even replace it with any other thickener - it is great with that one ingredient left out.

Excellent! This was soooo easy. The only thing I changed was that I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I look forward to trying this again using red wine (as I have read several stroganoff recipes that call for red). Will make this over and over again!

This was quick and easy to put in the crockpot, I made the following changes.  I used beef broth instead of water and eliminated the bullion.  I used red wine instead of white.  It still seemed it was missing something maybe next time more garlic or worshtechire.

This stroganoff was quick and easy! We loved it!  Here are some alterations I made:  Used 8 oz of sour cream vs. 12, used red wine instead of white, added a little cornstarch and water to thicken it up.  I highly recommend this recipe.  It's delicious!

This was great! I added fresh white and baby portabella mushroom slices instead of canned and
omitted the water, then substituted 4 oz. of the sourcream with 4 oz of cream cheese and thickened
it up near the end with corn starch. Everyone loved it! Even my 4 year old son who NEVER eats dinner without a fight, sat right down and 
cleaned his plate!!! Unbelievable!! Thank you!

Very Good and easy recipe.  However I would watch the amount of sourcream. 12 ounces seemed to be enough w/o being too overpowering.

I substituted Braggs Apple vinegar for the white wine,  Mountain High plain yogurt for the sour cream, and cilantro for the parsley, great taste excellent flavor. Meat was Top Strip Tenderloin thus superior tenderness that melts in your mouth.

I doubled onion and garlic and was great.  
Next time use red wine instead of white. 
I used fresh mushrooms. 
Sauce was a little runny even after adding a little more flour, so next time thicken more.

This turned out very well.  I had to substitute ingredients since I didn't have everything in the recipe on hand.  I substituted red wine for the white, a package of au jus gravy mix instead of the bouillon and skipped the flour.  I would definitely make it again.

I made a double batch for a Halloween pot luck party at the cigar lounge I go to.  It was a hit with everybody.  We didn't have as many people as I expected so I ended up bringing about half of it home.  I have several containers in the fridge for quick meals over the next few days.  Yum, yum!

Did it as per the recipe but found it a bit runny. The next day, I put it in a pot and heated it up until it was bubbling. I then added two tablespoons of Bisto to a cup of beef broth and used that to thicken the mixture. It turned out much, much better the second time around!

Turned out great! Very tasty. I used top round beef cuz that’s what I had, which resulted in more of a shredded beef stroganoff. But still awesome! I agree with others that a stew meat might be best to maintain more of a chunky style meat. I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and was glad that I did. I only made a few slight

My husband said it was good. I didn't change anything except that I didn't have dried chives so left those out. I was easy to put together in the AM to be ready at 6 PM.

My husband and I really liked this recipe. To cut sodium, I used unsalted beef broth in place of the water and beef bouillon cube. Smells wonderful while it is cooking and tastes good. I served over egg noodles and added steamed broccoli for our vegetable.

Halved whole mushrooms after nuking 3 minutes to keep them from absorbing fat; used red wine instead of water w/cream soup and red wine with flour. Also, dried parsley flakes mixed in to sour cream (when crock pot started) to sub for fresh parsley.

Pretty darn good. I added paprika and a little extra onion. I feel like something tangy would enhance this really good recipe. Maybe some citrus or Swiss cheese. Excellent as is though!

This was so good. Even my picky husband had two helpings. I used the London Broil meat and it was so tender. I made a few changes as suggested by others. I used 1/2 cup of red wine, a whole onion and 4 ounces of cream cheese when I added the sour cream. The sauce is so good. I’m looking forward to the leftovers.

We followed instructions exactly but the end result was more of a soup consistency., not sure what happened there.  We did not have noodles so we had it with mashed potatoes, but that would not have done a thing to the consistency as they are not mixed.  As a lover of sour cream I can not believe that we were not crazy about the flavor it was to sour.  So we will not be making this dish again.

I doubled the recipe, I don't recommend doubling the salt :) . I used Beef Roast strips( I cut them into squares). I recommend stirring the ingredients together before cooking.
Also, buttered egg noodles are great with this recipe

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner this past year (2017). We always go to my cousin's the night before to have ham and I just wasn't feeling it two days in a row. It was SUPER easy to make and I threw it in the crock pot before the kids were even up to see their Santa gifts. It smelled so good all day. My family will change it up a bit next time around only because we don't like chunks of mushroom (totally preferential) so we will omit that but still use the cream of mushroom soup (as the chunks in there are very small). Great recipe with an awesome taste and so easy!

I usually don't like when people rate something and then change it all up, but on the other hand, I have found what others have done useful.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of  canned.  I used fresh green onion instead of  dried chives. I also had to thicken a little with a corn starch slurry at the end. Have found it is best if cooked on low for 8 hours.  Flavor is great.

For a quick and easy crockpot recipe we thought it was delicious.  
My changes:
Used stew meat and fresh mushrooms.
Doubled the garlic as well as the whistoshire sauce.
Crushed the bullion.
Cut the sour cream (and only cooked an additional 30 mins after adding).
I did use white wine and added the flour .... about an hour before serving I took a small amount of the sauce and whisked another tsp of flour and a tsp of corn starch together and added.
I also added a cup of the starch water from the noodles.
After I drained the noodles I threw them in also along with a fat pat of butter and let the flavors come together for about 10 mins.

This was excellent based on others suggestions to make it 5 star.  I also used tenderized stew meat.  I used a whole yellow onion sliced and then halfed; used 8 oz. of fresh mushrooms sliced; 3 cloves of garlic minced; 1 tbls. of Worcestershire ; 1/2 cup Marsala wine (omitting the water) plus 1 tbls. cornstarch in addition to the flour; cut the sour cream to 8 oz. and added 4 oz. of cream cheese; substituted 1 tbls. of beef better than buillion vs. a bullion cube; based on our preference I also added sliced fresh red pepper. Mix throughly in case you don't watch the video.   Be sure to take the cover off and up the crock pot temp. to high the last half hour to thicken the sauce.  So yummy!!!  The sauce is delicious.

I have used this recipe about 10 times or more but substitute the canned mushrooms for lots of fresh, perfect. I also tripled  the amount of Worschire.

This turned out pretty well, and I will make it again.  Next time, I will take advice to use stew meat.  And I made mistake of not noticing it called for bullion cubes, without addition of enough water to make into bullion.  I noticed before adding all the water, but still added too much.  I took advice of reviews and added a little cream cheese in addition to the sour cream called for., and I added red wine instead of white. This recipe was easy to prepare and had really nice flavor.  Because of my admitted mistake, it was a bit runny, but I look forward to making again with the amount of water recipe calls for!

We loved this one!  I modified all quantities to match the weight  of round steak I had.  For sour cream, I substituted 1/2 cottage cheese and 1/2 philadelphia cream cheese.  Used dried parseley for fresh.  Used apple juice for white wine.

Served over egg noodles, it was fabulous!!

I made it but varied amounts - Wasn't as thick as I anticipated but the taste was very good. Will use less liquid next time perhaps omitting the water.

I forgot the wine and flour step and didn't see a problem at all. I subbed plain Greek  yogurt for the sour cream and green peppers for the mushrooms. Should have just used the mushrooms because my 7 yr old didn't like it anyway and I'd kept them out for her.  I'm sure it's really good with mushrooms.  Will definitely make it again. I didn't cut the steak into strips, more like chunky strips trimmed of fat. They cooked well and fell apart.

I used some cream cheese and sour cream and didn't cook it that long.  I cooked in the crock pot for about 6 hours total.  It was very good. My husband ate it till he was overly full. Easy and great for entertaining or just put it on in the morning and go have fun. When you walk in at the end of the day it smells so good and while you relax it cooks that last hour when you put in the cream cheese and sour cream.  Love it.

We loved the taste, although the sauce was a bit runny.  I will make this again but next time will not add water and probably toss the beef stew with the flour and cook in a skillet before adding to crockpot.  Maybe this will thicken up the sauce a bit.

Very tasty and I had all the ingredients on hand except I used red wine because I had no white open, otherwise followed the recipe.  Nice thing with this recipe is that you can switch out some of the ingredients to suit your taste or what you have on hand.

Needed more flavor. Not sure what. Went with Sara's suggestions. Did 3 cloves garlic,tbs Worcester sauce, could use more. I browned stew meat with flour, onions garlic. Followed the rest. Still just so so. It needs Chef John's tweaking.

This was  good. The meat was tender, and the sauce just needed a little more oomph.  I would double the garlic and triple the Worcester next time, unless any one out there has a better idea???? . Will try red wine rather than white as well. I did add the corn starch to thicken as recommended by others.

This was fantastic. I used regular stroganoff meat from the store which was already cut into thin strips. Followed other suggestions such as doubling the garlic and whochester sauce, omitting the beef bouillon and using and doubling the red wine along with adding the flour and some cornstarch to the wine. I put in the mushrooms at the start and used about 6 oz. of sour cream with my 4 oz. of cream cheese about half hour before we ate as I halved the recipe for the 2 of us.

I've had better beef stroganoff. This recipe is missing something.  This recipe calls for white wine, but it may be better with cooking sherry, or more wine. Also, it may need more Worcestershire. It wasn't bad, but I know it could be better or more flavorful. This recipe is pretty flat as it is. I added quite a bit of salt and pepper for flavor.  This recipe seems to be the best on the internet, so I'll use it again, but I'll add more zip next time.

It's simple and most items are staples in the cupboard. That being said, it just tasted okay. I'll give it another try with my own tweaks, but I truly prefer a more traditional stroganoff!

My wife has always made this on the stove top. As a surprise I used this recipe w2ith some changes.  I omitted the onion, canned mushrooms,and garlic. I substituted water for the wine and added fresh sliced white mushrooms with the sour cream. She absolutely loved it!!!! Thank you so much for this.

Was really looking forward to this after it simmered all day, as it smelled wonderful! Unfortunately, it was extremely bland :( 
I see others have made similar comments, although many others loved it. I guess tastes just vary

I only had half the recommended sour cream on-hand, but I don't know if the full amount would have improved the taste all that much (might be a good way of avoiding additional fat content by halfing the sour cream). It longer to cook than I expected and I even used stew beef. It was still pretty good though

I was looking for a classic stroganoff recipe, and this was perfect! I didn't have 6-7 hours, so I cooked it on high for 4-5 hours and that worked fine. I also used 1/2 the sour cream, and this was creamy enough -- and I like creamier sauces. Also added a little extra splash of white wine, which gave it a good zing.  Will definitely make again, and add to my go-to list of recipes.

I made this for our family tonight.  Other than adjusting the quantities, because there are only 3 of us, I changed nothing.  It was a unanimous hit!  We will definitely add to our meal rotation.

Very good flavor though I only used half the amount of sour cream. Next time will watch timing more closely as mine got a little overdone. Perfect way to enjoy stroganoff with current beef prices!

It was OK but seemed to be missing something. I'm always a little heavy handed with the garlic so I took care of that right away. It was very runny so I added a slurry of 1 tbsp corn starch in some water to try to thicken it up some but it didn't do much. I also used fresh baby Bellas so that probably contributed to it being on the runny side. Next time I'll try other reviewers suggestions of using red wine and increasing the worcestershire sauce to  at least 1 tbsp. There are other recipes on the site that call for both sour cream and cream cheese; that might give it the consistency this lacks. Thanks for submitting this recipe.

This turned out sooooo good. I found it a bit heavy on the sour cream taste when finished so I also made a change. I added another can of Cream of Mushroom soup along with 1/3 cup milk to get to the consistency I wanted. It was fabulous.

I loved the ingredients (especially the white wine and worcestershire sauce), but didn't want to wait for it to cook in the crock pot so I sauteed the meat and garlic, onion and sliced mushrooms then added all other ingredients to the pan. It was delicious. It took about half an hour. And I added a bag of cooked egg noodles directly into the meat and sauce. I will definitely make this again!

Pretty good.  A bit watery, but nothing a little corn starch and water couldn't fix.  Make sure you don't over -cook or the meat may fall apart.

This was a big hit at my house tonight! We had a snow day and I had to make a few substitutions but the 5 stars are in spite of that, not because of. I used 1/2 beef stew meat and 1/2 venison. I like to brown the meat first so I did that with the onions and garlic. If I had fresh mushrooms I would have added them here. Had 2 lbs of meat so I doubled the water, wine and flour. Used red wine but I'm sure white would be tasty too. Added plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. Served over egg noodles with a salad and fresh-from-the-oven bread. My 3 and 6 year-olds raved about it! When the kids think you are the "best cooker in the world" you have to call that a win!!

I also found this to be a great recipe.  Like the other reviewers, which I did pay attention to, I made my adjustments, including:
-- flouring the cut pieces of round steak and browning them in olive oil before putting them in the crock pot.  Helps to thicken the sauce and add to the flavor.
-- then, immediately browning the onions and garlic in more olive oil in the same pan before adding them on top of the meat in the crock pot.  
-- adding a package of dry french onion soup mix
-- 2 pounds of round steak
-- 2 onions and 3-4 garlic cloves
-- 1 pound fresh sliced mushrooms added on top of the onions at the beginning of cooking
-- did NOT use a Bouillon cube.  Have begun using the more natural Bouillon paste made from beef and mixed w/water.  Much less sodium and more flavor.
-- also used the scallions/green onions
-- added a pound of carrots after cooking the recipe all night and then cooked it 3 more hours before adding the 4 oz of low fat sour cream and 8 oz of fat free cream cheese (not necessary, but adds to the nutrition of a one-step meal)
-- 1/2 cup red wine, and then added more red wine in bits as the recipe thickens up by morning

This was really good and quite easy. I was intimidated by beef stroganoff but wanted to give it a shot. This was the easiest looking and closest to my mom's from what I could tell and I'm really glad I tried it! I halved the sour cream and used red wine instead of white. I also added dill instead of chives with the sour cream at the end. Very yummy! I like it better with rice instead of noodles, but I know noodles is more traditional.

This is an excellent recipe!  We stayed fairly close to the recipe as directed except we like red wine, instead of white wine, and we double the amount.  Otherwise, it's an easy dish to prepare in the crockpot and meat was extremely tender.  We will make again!

Followed the recipe exactly and I very disappointed with the outcome since It was more or less flavorless . I think it would be better with more herbs and less sour cream. Probably wont make this one again.

Excellent- simple and so tasty!!!  I literally left it and ran off.  It did not require any watching, no overcooking concerns.  I did substitute white grape juice for the wine and it worked beautifully.  I am not a fan of mushrooms so I did use cream of onion soup (cream of celery works as well) and left the mushrooms out.

Very good, the whole family enjoyed this for dinner and then lunch the next day.  Omitted the water and increased wine to 1/2 cup.  Added 1TBSP cornstarch.  Definitely a keeper, can't wait to smell it cooking once again!

Very good.  I followed the recipe with what I had on hand which I used some sliced up bottom round roast that I had gotten on a managers special for next to nothing and plan on using for three meals.  I did not have the chives or Worchester sauce.  Very similar to my moms recipe so brings back some sweet memories. Based on the review that mentioned missing the pan drippings,  I floured and browned the meat and then the mushrooms and deglazed the pan with the white wine and then simmered down the white wine with gravy master for a demi glaze to add to the crock pot for more flavor.  I just made enough for two.  Cooked up quick and was great to come home to dinner ready.  My husband was home all day smelling it cook and could not wait to eat.  I made the night before and put into the crock pot the morning before I went to work.  I will definitely make this again over and over.

If I make this again, I'll definitely cut the sour cream in half.  I used top round London broil because it was cheaper than the steak.  It fell apart more than desired.  I'll also take heed to the stew meat recommendations.  Other than being overpowered by sour cream, it was tasty.

Use red wine not white and water.  Use some cream cheese with the sour cream.  Use fresh mushrooms, not canned.

Prepped it in the crock and put it in the fridge overnight. Put it in the cooker on low the next morning and went to work.  An hour after I got home I had an excellent meal. I was a little hesitant to add that much sour cream (not a fan) but it turned out great.

The taste of this dish is restaurant worthy.  Excellent!  My kids raided the egg noodles, so that left me with more stroganoff than noodles.  A friend had given me a dinner set including truffle linguini, so I made it and tossed it with the leftover stroganoff, and wow!  It made it even better!  Next time I'll make this and use the truffle linguini.

The   only change I made was to add 1 tablespoon of Dijon Mustard,it lowers the sharpness of the wine, and brings out the other flavors.

I followed the changes made by "reviewer Sara" and the stroganoff was excellent. Fresh mushrooms instead of canned, 2 cloves garlic instead of 1, 1 tbsp worcestershire instead of 1tsp, 1/2 cup red wine instead of 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup white wine, 1 tbsp cornstarch plus the flour, 8 oz sour cream instead of 16 oz and 4 oz of cream cheese. Husband really liked it.

Not impressed.  It's missing 'something', but I don't know what.  I followed recipe, didn't add anything it didn't call for. Very bland.  On the up-side,  I did use London Broil, and this cooking method tenderized the meat perfectly!

I followed the recipe to the letter except for the wine, bouillon and flour, only because we didn't have them on hand. It was still really good and flavour full. I would definitely make this again. Everyone loved it!

This was very good.  Next time I will cook a little less in my crock, because the meat was beginning to get dry.  But overall, this was great.  My husband, who IS the cook in the house, really liked this and said after 2 bites, "I'll eat this again".  That says a lot.

Overall this is a great basic recipe. BUT..... in my opinion you MUST brown the meat & onions FIRST . If you don't,  your meat dish looks grey rather than a nice brown. I dust mine with flour first before browning. This makes all the difference in the world.

Made this last night and it was excellent. Also took  the suggestions of the other reviewers and added in 1/2 cup more white wine, a tbsp cornstarch but kept out the flour, used fresh mushrooms, seasonings and an extra 1/2 tbsp of  worcestershire and wahlah! Gorgeousness in a slow cooker! Much easier than the norm! Thank you!!!

I use beef fajita meat because it's more tender and it's already cut into strips when you buy it, I omit the mushrooms, because other than me no one in my family likes them ??, cut the onion in strips instead of chopped, and because of migraine issues I can't use boullion (they all have msg) so I use onion soup mix instead, (I've found one without msg at my local dollar store of all places!!). I think I will try the suggestion of cream cheese and sour cream to thicken it up, and red wine instead of white. Also use cornstarch instead of flour. 
We like to add a dollop of sour cream on our individual portions for that extra zing... I always serve over egg noodles, and usually with petite whole green beans as a side. 
This is a staple dish for us in the winter time.

I was skeptical about making this recipe, but to my surprise it was really good. I didn't add the wine and cut back on the bullion cube. Used fresh sautéed mushrooms instead and only 1/2 the sour cream. My husband loved it...

Yes I made some changes. I used golden mushroom soup which has wine in it and tastes better. I used fresh musrooms instead of canned.
I cut the sour cream in half and. added 4 oz. of neufchatel cream cheese. I added more garlic and used whole wheat no yolk wide noodles. I did not add any wine at all since this soup already contains wine. I used stew meat since it has more fat marbeled in to make it tender. I thickened the sauce with flour and instead of a boullion cube I used a little beef stock with no salt added. Boullion has a lot of salt. It tastes really good.

I just made some without using a recipe, but mine is very similar.  I just wanted to say that I used stew meat, and put it into the slow cooker by itself for several hours, and it did brown the meat without putting it into a skillet first!   Therefore, it did have that extra flavor.    I stirred it a few times to brown all the meat.  There's just me to cook for, so I have frozen cooked stew meat to start more.  I didn't measure anything, did use fresh mushrooms.

We've made this twice..  first time we didn't have chives or parsley... was still good.. Used half yogurt/half sour cream. still good...  Second time we had chives and omitted the parsley.  This is a keeper.

Ive made this several times and the changes I make are 8oz fresh sliced mushroom instead of canned, no chives, and I use red wine instead of white. I buy the cheapest steak I can find and it always turn out tender in this recipe.  Very easy to make in the crockpot!

Delicious. I adopted Sara's suggestions because they appealed to me. I smelled it cooking on a rainy and windy afternoon (aftermath of hurricane Patricia).

I followed a suggestion to use stew beef instead of steak. It was perfect and can't imagine using better cut due to the slow cooker. Save money and use the stew beef :-)

Doubled the amount of mushrooms. Used fresh mushrooms and added 1 tablespoon of corn starch to offset the extra water from the fresh mushrooms.  Added half a packet of Lipton onion soup.  I used pot roast instead. I used organic vegetable broth instead. I used half the sour cream.  Excellent recipe. My husband raved and wants it again already. It took me double the time to prep. But I loved how easy it was.

Super easy, but a little bland, so I added 1-2 teaspoons paprika, and 1 teaspoon pepper; which made it perfect.  I also modified a bit by using nonfat, plain greek yogurt in place of sour cream, fresh chopped mushrooms, and Elk Round Steak instead of beef;  turned out perfecty.

I'm only giving it 4 stars as I changed a couple of things right off the bat.

I seared the beef in olive oil and added a GOOD amount of worscheshire  sauce. I placed that in the slow cooker and then cooked down the onions and mushrooms. Threw those into the show cooker as well.  Dissolved the beef boulion cube in the 1/4 cup of water, added to that the flour, the wine, cream of mushroom soup and chives and added that to the slowcooker. Mixed it all together and cooked. At the end, I took a 1/4 cup of the cooked down juices and added tsp of corn starch (thought it looked a little thin) and added the sour cream. I think next time I will try it with 8oz of light sour cream and 8 oz of fat free sour cream as it was quite "heavy". But otherwise SOOO GOOD~!!

I would definitely make this again. I made the recipe for 6 and adjusted as follows:  I used fresh mushrooms instead of a can, I didn't quite use all the sour cream recommended, and I added more flour when I stirred in the sour cream because it wasn't thickening as much as I would have liked. My friends loved it!

I've made this countless times, especially for company. Having the main dish in the slow cooker while you work on other preparations is a wonderful thing. And it makes the house smell so good, too!

This was sooo good!  I wasn't expecting much, because my mother makes a very good, time-intensive stroganoff, and my husband usually hates slow-cooker recipes, but it tasted like it took a long time to make and was so easy! I left out the chives and only used half the sour cream and still very, very good.

This was very quick, easy and delicious. It was a great base recipe but due to the overwhelming number of same suggestions provided by other reviewers I did make a few minor alterations which is why I gave this 4 stars. 
1.) I used 2 lbs of Costco stew meat sliced approx 1/2" thick. 
2.) 1 whole onion, chopped. 
3.) 1/2 cup of red wine in lieu of 1/4 C of white because I feel it enhances the flavor of beef, in addition with 1/4 C water.
 4.) I added 1 Tbsp of cornstarch in addition to the flour.
5.) I used condensed cream of mushroom soup but omitted adding additional mushrooms as my hubby isn't a fan.
6.) NO salt was added as many of the ingredients listed are quite salty in and of themselves.
---I whisked the soup, water, wine, coarse ground black pepper, garlic, flour, cornstarch & beef bullion paste (I use the "Better Than Buillion" brand) together until smooth and poured over the meat and onions. I was concerned that it was going to be too thick but once heated, it turned out to be a perfectly thick sauce.
6.) At the last half hour of cooking, I used 1/3 C of sour cream and 1/3 C of cubed cream cheese.
Served it over white rice. 
I apologize for leaving a review for a recipe I basically butchered but in my opinion, the changes that were suggested made sense to me and outside of adding fresh mushrooms to it, I couldn't have been more pleased with the end result.

Easy, delicious weeknight meal. Based on the others reviews, I cut water in half, and added a packet of dry onion soup mix. Was perfect.

I made this with a few alterations, I used fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned (blech canned mushrooms) I also used red wine in place of white, it is an amazing recipe, the meat is fork tender and delicious. 
I also made homemade noodles, very easy and much better to serve the stroganoff over.

Good recipe. Add a touch of cream cheese with the sour cream, makes for a very rich, delicious sauce.

I did put some additional touches on this...  Used beef broth and Guiness for any liquid that was called for.  Also used half sour cream and half cream cheese.  Still added a mix of white wine and  a little corn starch at the end to thicken things up.  Quite yummy!!!

I'm not sure why everyone wanted to change this recipe. Based on reviews I doubted it was perfect for me as most recipes are not on this site. I happened to have saved half a packet of lipton onion soup so I did put that in. However, I think that made it too salty so I then added a lot of pepper. I do agree some sour cream gave it a tang so two dollops did the job. CreAm cheese is a must! Delicious recipe!

This is really good!  My husband, 9-year old son, and 1-year old son all cleaned their plates, which is really saying something.  I realized too late that it was a slow-cooker recipe, so I just combined the ingredients in a big sauce pan… still turned out delicious.

I liked it better when I used all fresh ingredients, no canned mushrooms or cream of soup and more Worcestershire sauce, more onion and it was awesome with a little cream cheese.

We had ours with rice. I added a few extra chives towards the end of the 8 hours, everything else was the same as the recipe listed. The beef was very tender and the sauce was out of this world. My future wife said it was the nicest thing I have cooked and the best stroganoff she has ever had. I usually criticise my own cooking but could not fault it following this recipe. We had this for dinner last Friday and are having it again tonight.  A* recipe..

This had a very good taste.  I used milk instead of half & half.  I also cut the amount of sour cream in half and use cream cheese to make the sauce a little creamier.  Also fresh mushrooms are always used in my kitchen, never canned.  I might try a little less wine next time, I am not a fan of the wine taste.  Don't have fresh parsley, you can use dried, tasted fine.  Overall good recipe, everyone has their own little takes on it though.

This is a very good beef stroganoff recipe.  The beef was very tender. I followed the recipe exactly. It was a tiny bit on the bland side, but overall it was pretty good. I'd add a bit more thickener next time, because the sauce was a little runny for my taste. Thanks for the recipe.
EDIT: After leftovers tonight, I have to change my original 4-star rating to a 3. I thought it was lacking something. Even with a massive amount of sour cream, I couldn't taste it. Sorry, I'll probably stick to my old standby stovetop recipe next time.

This turned out great!  I made some changes - some suggested by others...stew meat instead of top round, sliced fresh sauteed mushrooms instead of canned, left out the bouillon, used 1/8 cup dry sherry instead of white wine which I added 1/2 hr before serving, left out the flour, used fresh green onion tops instead of chives, left out the salt.  I added the entire 16 oz sour cream...I think it was too much, will only use 8 oz next time.  But all in all, it was wonderful served over noodles.

With all the positive reviews, I was expecting this to be much tastier.  I prepared it according to the recipe, using top round steak instead of stewing meat as several other reviewers mentioned - perhaps that would have made a difference.  There were no real complaints as to how it cooked or how it turned out (technically there was nothing 'wrong' with it, although it did need about an hour longer in the slow cooker than indicated).  I would say that it didn't have the sauce wasn't as creamy as other 'stove top' recipes I've had in the past.  I suppose it just wasn't to our tastes.

I followed the suggestions that Sara made -- the flavor was fantastic, but it was so watery I couldn't serve it as it was. I added 6 ounces of rotini for the last 45 minutes (after adding a full 16 oz of sour cream, cuz just like garlic there's no such thing as too much sour cream in my universe) and that took care of the problem and turned it into something my teenaged son adored, but I really would have preferred noodles on the side. I do think the fresh mushrooms give it a lot (I used sliced baby bellos), but next time I'll try sauteing them before adding to cut back on the liquid and not add any water at all. Also, I recommend giving it a stir at the beginning and somewhere in-between.

So good! My daughter made this one too....she prepared it the night before in the slow cooker insert and then refrigerated overnight....next morning....put in slow cooker and turn it on.....now thats perfect for a busy work/school morning. She was really craving beef stroganoff so this was perfect. It was delicious! Doubled the recipe and we do have leftovers. Served over buttered noodles and made Waikiki Cornbread from this site as well. Tender meat, nice and saucy, and loved the sour cream and parsely addition at the end. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was FANTASTIC!! I'm not a huge stroganoff fan, but my husband loves it and he said this was one of the best he's ever had. I also became a fan of stroganoff after enjoying this dish.   I substituted the white wine with apple cider vinegar and that was the only change I made. This will definitely be a keeper in our household :)

This the best Stroganoff  recipe I have found. Have made it several times and hubby still loves it. The only thing I changed was using ground beef, it's what I had and it turned out perfect. 
It's been in the regular dinner line up and I plan on keeping it there.

Delicious and so easy! I followed many of the suggestions below, including a whole onion and 2 garlic cloves, 1/2c red wine instead of white, 1T worcester, 8 oz sour cream w/ 4 oz cream cheese, and fresh mushrooms (add at last hour). Definitely a keeper!

Not enough spices in this.  Quite boring sauce.  It needs a package of Liption Onion Soup mix, or something like that.  Meat, however, was tender.  I used a chuck roast and cut it up into stew size pieces.

Here is what I did: 1. Beef stew meet 2. beef broth instead of water, wine and bouillon (I didn't have the wine) 2. 2 cloves of garlic 3. 2 tsp of Worcestershire 4. fresh mushroom rather than canned 5. 2TBSP of flour 6. half the sour cream plus 4oz cream cheese  Smelled good, tasted not so great. The cream cheese was too strong for me. Husband said it was fine. Overall taste was lacking. Parsley was a bit overpowering. First few bites weren't bad, but I couldn't finish it. The cream cheese made me want to gag (and I LOVE cream cheese). I will not make this again.

This was great!! My kids loved it! I used chicken broth instead of water and eliminated the beef bouillon-- too salty for my taste. I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I served with egg noodles and sauteed zucchini, I came home to a good meal with no stress!

Came out absolutely delicious. My wife asked what we were having and I told her. She said the way I make it, hamburg and Cream of Mushroom Soup. I said no, when I cook all fresh ingredients and from scratch. Everyone loved it. I'll make this many many times.

My sister made this for us one night and it was so good! We didn't have canned mushrooms and not enough sour cream so I added some cream cheese and omitted the shrooms.

This was fabulous!  I used round steak beef cubes instead of strips.  I forgot to pick up the parsley but it was great without it.  You could use some chopped chives for decoration I guess...it doesn't need it...easy to make, leftovers even better.  I also used all the liquid from the canned mushrooms instead of water.  Next time, I may use Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream.

I was a little skeptical about how this recipe would turn out, but it was so good!  I used beef stew meat like some other reviewers suggested.  It was a little runny, so I might use a little more flour next time.

Like others, I used stew meat instead of the round steak.  I seasoned it with salt and pepper and floured it, and seared it on the stove before adding it to the crockpot.  Everything else, I kept the same (except I halved and then sliced the onion, we like larger pieces, and used a package of sliced fresh mushrooms, since I think canned have an off taste).  Awesome flavor, and even my sour cream hating husband approved of this.  Served over egg noodles, and it was delish!!  Good the next day too.

Sauce tasted great, but the texture of the meat and mushrooms wasn't as good as stove-top stroganoff.  Nice and tender, but just lacking something.  Still looking for the one that my DH will love!

I love this recipe!  It's so easy and delicious!  I did have to add a slurry of cornstarch & water at the end because it wasn't quite thick enough for me.  I also made it with cubed stew meat instead of the strips of round steak.  I've also tried it with frozen homestyle meatballs instead of the round steak, which makes the dish more like Swedish meatballs.  Yum!!

This is wonderful for a crock pot meal!!  I too used red wine, fresh mushrooms and canned.  Listened to the other reviews, and used 8 oz. sour cream and 8 oz. cream cheese.   This is a keeper!

I followed the recipe except that I substituted roast beef chunks for the steak strips.  It turned out very watery, and I tried to thicken with a flour/milk mixture.  It still was pretty soupy.  The flavor was OK... but on the bland side.  We probably won't make it again.

Great recipe!  I omitted to canned mushrooms because my family isn't a big fan.  I also used 1 cup of beef broth instead of bouillon and 1/4 cup broth instead of wine.  It was very good and the meat was so tender.

This was soooo yummy!!  We added cooked noodles to the crockpot after the stroganoff was done and it almost filled the whole thing, so there was plenty to go around.

Wow, this was wonderful. We have two people allergic to mushrooms, so stroganoff is hardly ever eaten by us. Used Cream of Chicken soup and just left mushrooms out, but this was fantastic! Served it over butter egg noodles.

This was delicious! I served it with noodles and my family loved it. Only things I did different were to brown the meat dusted with flour, salt and pepper and I used fresh instead of canned mushrooms. The meat was so tender. This will be made again.

We really enjoyed this recipe! My somewhat picky 6 year old ate this up with no complaints or funny looks which is definitely saying something! Next time I think I will use fresh mushroom and a little more onion.

Well I have to give this one 5 stars because my preschooler liked it which in itself is rather remarkable!  I pretty much followed the recipe except I'm not much of a measurer - just whatever feels right.  I made a couple of small exceptions, used fresh mushrooms - have no use for canned!  Didn't have dried chives so added a little onion powder, and I definitely think red wine lends itself to this dish over white so I subbed that.  Also for my tastes that much sour cream is too much so I probably used about 2/3 of a cup and the dish turned out very good.   Thanks for the recipe.

The best yet!I used what I had in the house so I made a few changes. 1/4 apple juice instead of wine, bbq sauce instead of Worcestshire,1-2Tbsp roasted garlic,and 1/4 cup scallions rather than chives. I had cubed stewing beef on hand and it worked out perfect. Did not have the mushrooms or parsely and it still tasted amazing. Good for the whole family.

Our family really liked this recipe. Instead of red wine, I used 1/4 red wine vinegar. Vinegar breaks down the meat and makes it more tender. Definately will make again. I finally found a good and easy stroganoff to make.

Good basic recipe....but I did brown my meat in skillet with flour and salt and pepper....more fIavor. Skip the wine..its unnecessary. Also use 1 whole onion......and half the sour cream..add 4oz. of cream cheese at end with sour cream. If you take everyone's review and add or subtract to your own taste this is a good start...easy also.

The most foolproof stroganoff recipe you'll ever find! SO easy and SOOOOOOO good! Throw it in the crockpot in the morning, by the time work is done, you have a savory, tender dinner perfect for family but delicious enough for company. A favorite for sure! Thanks!

This was very good considering the changes I made. I also followed the changes by Sara...except the steak choice, used fresh chives (much cheaper then dried!), and I used 1/2 of an onion (like recipe states). Still worth a try !!! Two out three toddlers ate it.

With a few small tweaks, this was excellent!  I used beef stew meat (same amount).  I used sauteed baby bellas instead of canned mushrooms.  I didn't have any white wine, so I used cooking sherry instead.  I only used 2/3 of the 16 oz. container of sour cream - and I chose light instead of regular.  It was so delicious - my husband is a picky eater and he loved it.  Even ate the mushrooms!

I loved this one!  I used resh mushrooms because I prefer them.  My fiance said he thought the meet was a little dry, but I didn't think so.  He said he might have preferred ground beef.  I thickened the sauce with flour per other reviews.  Was so yummy over egg noodles!

I used a sirloin steak on sale cut into strips. I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and and only  used about 8 ozs. sour cream. Very delicious and easy to make! Thank you for the recipe.

I too used Sara's suggestions, and she's right on the money. I DO love garlic, so I added three cloves and would kick it up to four cloves next time around.

I also followed the review suggestions made by Sara and otherwise followed the rest of the recipe. I used eye of round steaks since I had them on hand, and they crumbled in the crockpot. Next time I will use a heartier cut of meat. Anyway, this recipe is awesome! I've been craving some good stroganoff and this hits the spot. I can't to feed it to my beef-loving husband. This will definitely be an addition to the regular rotation.

Simple easy recipe.  We get tired of beef stew in the slow cooker and this was a nice change.  Instead of water, I added 1/2 can of beef broth to instensify flavor.

This recipe was average at best. I felt  the flavor was slightly askew. The tangy white wine and sour cream clashed with the mellow taste of the mushrooms. I recommend changing these seasonings for better results.

Excellent! Very easy to throw together.  I doubled the recipe and used red wine instead of white, 3 cloves fresh garlic, added extra flour at the end to thicken more and also used one 8 oz. cream cheese - no sour cream.  The canned mushrooms make a great addition.  It's a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe to a "T" and found it to be quite ordinary.  Meat slightly tough and sauce bland.  Too bad, I had such high hopes.

YOU NEED TO TRY THIS RECIPE! I had never made beef stroganoff before so i opted to go the slow cooker route to make it a little easier. This recipe is absolutely delicious! My boyfriend asks me to make it almost every week now. Yummy and thank you!

This recipe was ok, but I should have read more of the reviews before I made it.  As others have said, the sour cream was way too much, it should have been cut in half.  And I did thicken the sauce with some cornstarch or it would have been too runny.  But I was still expecting better flavor.  Maybe I will try again with some modifications.

This was an easy recipe! I added fresh mushrooms and extra garlic. I also used the golden cream of mushroom soup for a little more flavor. I also only used half the sour cream the recipe calls for as it seemed a bit excessive. This was an  easy meal to put together and we thought it was pretty good.

I wasn't crazy about the first time I tried it, just because I thought it came out to runny.  The next time I left out the water and used fresh mushrooms rather than the "canned in water" variety, and it turned out quite good.

Incredibly good!  I have tried many stroganoff recipes and this one is by far the best!  I used round steak and threw them in whole because I did it in the morning and didnt' feel like cutting them up.  I served it with egg noodles an my husband and I "mmmmmm"'d through the whole dinner!

Used venison. Not a bad flavor, but using all of the suggestions posted by other viewers - it became a whole new recipe. Very "soupy". Stick with the Reviewer's Stroganoff Recipe.

This was a delicious fast and easy recipe.  Didn't use onion (hubby doesn't like) and cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom because it's what I had in the pantry.  I started on high for 30 minutes and on low for about 4 1/2 hrs.  Turned out wonderful.  Thank you for the posting of this recipe!!!!

I didn't change a thing with this recipe, and it was jst okay.  It seemed  a little too bland for me.  I'm not giving up on this one, though.  I'll try it again with a few recommended changes!

This slow-cooker method combined with the creative use of spices and mushrooms without question , has to be the best stroganoff i've ever tasted.

This was a really great crock pot recipe.  We really enjoyed the flavor of the dish and it was great to have a nice quick meal on a day I didn't feel like cooking.  I did add a can of beef broth for the wine, bouillon, and water. I also seasoned the beef with flour, onion powder, garlic, and pepper. Be careful of adding salt due to the beef broth.  I am so glad I didn't add any extra salt because it would have ruined the dish.  I am not sure if the seasoned beef helped thicken up the dish because at the end it was quite soupy. (So I will next time skip this step to save some time).  So I dumped it in a pot added some corn starch and cooked it for about 20 more minutes. ( I just don't have luck thicking with corn starch in the crock pot without it tasting like corn starch).  This gave me a thick gravy and then I stirred in all of the sour cream and it was great! Served with hot buttered noodles and it was a very hearty meal.

This was so easy and very tasty. I used fresh mushrooms and didn't even have the garlic (used powder), or the parsley. We ate it with pasta. I cooked it on high for about 7 hours with a frozen piece of meat! You can't beat that!

Delicious.  The meat just fell apart (I forgot to cut the meat into strips before hand).  I substituted 8 oz. fresh mushrooms for the canned and added about 1/4 c. additional water to make up for the canned mushroom liquid. The fresh mushrooms did just fine and were delicious.

This sounded great but was pretty disappointing.  I used petite sirloin in place of top round, fresh mushrooms for canned ones.  I cooked for more than the required amount of time but the onions were not thoroughly cooked.  My husband and I thought it was just ok and prefer a stove-top recipe I have used in the past.  Probably won't make this again

Excellent tasting dish.  My husband told me "make this again" which is his version of 2 thumbs up.  The sauce came out a bit thin, and it could have more meat in it, but otherwise it is a great meal.

My kids beg me to make this all the time! This is by far the best and easiest Stroganoff recipie I have found. I do add a little more meat, about 2-21/2 lbs, and its still great! I highly recommend this!

This was just o.k. nothing spectacular.  I thought the sour cream was to dominate in this recipe. I had way to much "gravy", maybe becuase i used a whole can of beef broth instead of 1 cup, but it looked like soup instead of stroganoff.  I'm not sure if I will make this again, the family reaction was one of polite smiles and we will eat it because you made it....sorry!

This is my new beef stroganoff recipe.  I threw everything but the sour cream in the slow cooker before work, and I came home to a wonderful dinner with no effort.  I did substitue the wine and beef bouillon with a can of beef broth (what I had on hand). Tastes just like beef stroganoff should!

This recipe is Excellent and very creamy especially if your short on time!  The only small changes I made was using sirloin instead for a more tender less fatty meat and I added a little bit of mustard and more worcestershire.

I hate reading about all the changes people made to the original recipe....but I did have to use fresh chives instead of dried (didn't feel like spending $3 bucks on a bottle of dried).  This recipe is very easy, very tasty, and I would certainly make it again.

This was delicious. I made it for my husband on our anniversary, as it is one of his all-time favorite dishes. I doubled the recipe. He ate this (by choice) for a whole week straight. After reading elsewhere to add some cream cheese to beef stroganoff, I tried it. It didn't melt well and I don't think it added much. Since that was the only change I made to the recipe, next time I will be following this exactly. Thank you Daria.

If you salt your meat before the bouillon, then it will be too salty.  The Worchestershire sauce was a little overpowering.  Beside that, the recipe was great.  Next time, I am gonna try some potatoes in it.

I thought this was a wonderful recipe.  It was a great twist to the original beef stroganoff that I was used to.  I used fresh mushroom in place of the water and canned mushrooms and it turned out great!

I have tried several different recipes for this dish and I believe that this is the most delicious and expedient recipe, I did not very from the recipe which I think is important-the wine adds alot of flavor.  Fresh mushrooms would be good and I deleted the boullion as I found that it was too salty.  My husband loves this recipe, and I have used different meats but Top Round is the best because it isnt too expensive and gets tender as it should.

Great! I doubled all ingredients except the meat. Added xtra mushrooms as we really like them. I used canned ones and used the liquid in them in place of the water. (I forgot to add worcestershire sauce and left out sour cream to cut fat) I also added a couple dashes of tabasco and 1/4 cup quick cooking tapioca...this helped make it nice and thick. I started this late in the day (1PM) so I quickly pan fried meat in non-stick skillet with no oil and put all other ingredients in pan and heated on stove so everything was hot when it went in crock pot. It was ready at 5pm! Turned out wonderful...will make agian.

I love trying new crock pot recipes but just didn't have great results with this one.  To be fair, my meat was a little tough probably even to cook all day in the slow cooker.   I used cooking sherry instead of wine and didn't have fresh parsley.  The gravy was a little too runny and I didn't think it had as much flavor as the beef burgandy recipe that I usually make.   Hopefully others will have better luck than I did with this one.

This was delicious!  With a newborn at home I have been searching for good recipes that don't take a lot of time.  Very easy to prepare.  The meat just melts in your mouth!  I thought it was great, my husband liked it, but he is not a sour cream fan and this recipe comes out rather sour creamy...next time I will decrease or substitute as others have recommended.  Thanks!

I ruined this recipe at the end by adding some corn starch to thicken it up. All day long it smelled fabulous--a really great mix of ingredients. An hour before it was to be done when I added the sour cream and parsley, it tasted wonderful, but I thought it was too thin. Next time I will just deal with it not being the consistency I want so that I can enjoy the flavors. If anyone has any hints about thickness, please let me know.

My husband LOVED this recipe. I'm not a big beef eater, but I thought it was really good. I'm going to try it with chicken next time.

I am always looking for new slower cooker recipes and this is definately a keeper!

Thanks for sharing!

AWESOME!!!! I needed to make 24 servings of Beef Stroganoff, so I came to allrecipes.com for a slowcooker recipe. I found the best one! The only thing I did different was I sauteed fresh mushrooms and added them to the beef instead of the canned ones. So good! Thank you!

Pretty yummy!  Easy to put together, and in a slow cooker, too!  I used only 1 cup of sour cream, and found it to be a bit much even at that.  I also substituted beef broth for the wine, so that likely lessened the taste kick a bit.  I think next time I will add a bit more Worcestershire or something for that extra oomph.

Very good however the meat was very chewy, and I will substitute the canned mushrooms for fresh ones next time. I also only used about 9 ounces of sour cream, felt that it was already creamy and thick, and it was great...Glad someone recommended this.

I have made beef stroganoff for years but with ground beef instead of round steak.  I made this version for my family and they loved it.  Even my picky 8 year old asked for seconds!  It has a really good flavor.

This was the easiest and best tasting stroganoff recipe I have ever made.  I skipped the chives and used red wine and fresh mushrooms.  Thanks Daria!

This tasted just like my mother's stroganoff but so much easier to do in the slow cooker. It's also very easy to modify the ingredients to your own tastes. Thank you for sharing this with the rest of us!

This was a snap to prepare, just put it all in, and let it got.  Everyone in the family loved it (4 kids and husband).  The baby didn't, but he doesn't like anything.  I doubled the recipe since there are so many of us.  The only thing I would do different next time is use rice instead of noodles, it makes alot gravy, and I didn't thicken it.  I will defintely make this recipe again.

We've been eating "hamburger stroganoff" for years.  This is the best steak version I've tried and we loved it.  Very good and very easy.  Didn't change a thing.

I reviewed this recipe about 4 yrs ago and it soon went to the bottom of my recipe box without me thinking much of it.  Not sure why, as I loved it then as well, but I discovered it recently and decided to give it another try.  We LOVED it!  I cooked it on high in the crockpot for 4 hours and it was perfect.  I did change out the white wine for red, and that made it superb.  There was not a drop left.  I served it with german spaetzle noodles to top it off with a "European flair".  My son even mentioned it this morning as we were eating breakfast how good dinner was last night -- how often does THAT happen?

I doubled this recipe because we are a large family. I expected it to be better. My family liked it and I thought it was ok. I thought it tasted salty and a little rich. Oh well, you never know til you try.

This was the first time I made Beef Stroganoff.  Delicious.  I was a little concerned about it being too rich so I used only 8 oz of sour cream.  Husband loved it and said it was a keeper.  Thanks.

I was very pleased with the taste and ease of this recipe.  The only thing I would have added to the recipe, or just a notation, is the preparation of noodles for the beef stroganof to go over or a baked potato.  A superb recipe.  I am using it next time I have comppany.  YUMMY!

This is a very good recipe. I've used it twice and both times, it went fast. The last time I made it I had guests over and they were working on their second plate while I was still eating my first. It was a race to get seconds. Very tasty.

This was really easy and very good.  Before I made this, my husband said he didn't like beef stroganoff, now he's a big fan.  I did reduce the sour cream like the other reviewers suggested and I didn't have beef bouillon, so I reduced the water and used canned beef broth.  The beef was so tender it was wonderful

I've tried beef stroganoff in a number of ways, even replacing the sour cream with chip dip, which is great, but this tops them all.  My husband is the pickiest eater and just loves this recipe and so has everyone else who's ever tried it and it's so easy!!!

My husband loved this recipe, although I am not a big stroganoff fan.  I did use fresh mushrooms in lieu of the canned, and added shallots instead of the chives.  There is nothing easier than a good slow cooker recipe!

I love it! A savory, hearty meal after a hard day at work.  I doubled the onions & mushrooms.  I also thicked the sauce with cornstarch & water before serving over hot buttered egg noodles.  I also used an all natural mushroom soup to cut down on the sodium.  Now I crave it at least once a month.

My husband absolutely loved this.  I liked it so much I made it again the following week for company.  They loved it too and requested the recipe.

This dish was a super big hit in my home.  Husband raved and raved. The tender beef made it very easy for him to eat after a unpleasant trip to the dentist that day.  

The best part was seeing the seven year old devour all those mushrooms and onions without noticing.  It has been requested that I make this one often.  Thanks!

Wonderful.  I was really suprised at how good it tasted.  
This receipe is well worth the little
effort it takes to put it together.  Served over lightly
buttered noodles, with a crisp salad, hard roll and butter
along with a nice chilled glass of your favorite wine,
and you have a meal fit for the most finicky guest.

Very tasty...noting earlier reviews, I incorporated several tablespoons of corn starch during the last hour.  The dish thickened up quite nicely.  Also, I used low fat cream of mushroom soup and lite sour cream, and it tasted great.

It does not match up to classic beef stroganoff, but for a quick week night meal it is great.  I did not have noodles on hand so we used white rice instead, and I consumed the end of the white wine the night before so a little water had to do.

I love slow cooker recipes that can be thrown together in 5 or 10 minutes before I go to work. Dinner is ready when I come home and best of all, it is a good healthy dinner not something fast & fried. This recipe is easy to make and tastes great. Served over noodles which only take 10 min. to make.
