I also love the idea of this. I followed the directions to a T and was very disappointed. As soon as I added the toasted pecans, the candy mixture turned into a solid mass! I almost threw it out. Instead I tried adding about 2 more tablespoons of maple syrup to the pot, and put it back on low heat. It slowly broke up to the point where I was able to spread it on top of the bacon, but not coat the bacon. The flavour of the bacon and the mixture together is divine. But next time I wont be adding the pecans to the mixture. I will coat the bacon in the mixture then coat the top of the dipped bacon with the pecans.

This really is fabulous. I've been making this ever since I saw it in a southern cookbook when I first moved into my own place. Only difference is I always used heavy duty foil that I sprayed liberally with Pam. Make sure to watch the candy mixture carefully, otherwise you'll have a mess on your hands. This is addictive, watch out. Very, very good.

I love the idea of this - and the taste. I had a little trouble with the praline mixture coating the bacon. I felt like it may have been too thick, and some of it dried funky-looking. Granted, I don't have a candy thermometer, so I was winging it a bit. I'm also going to try this again cutting the bacon into bite-size pieces before I fry it. I felt like a whole bacon strip was a bit much (maybe if the candy is thinner it would be a good sized serving, I don't know). Anyway, will definitely make these again - thanks for the recipe!

Yum!  Great for a dinner party as a conversation starter.  Better to lay the bacon on parchment paper and then drizzle the mix over it, then add chopped/toasted pecans quickly...  Didn't feel that there was enough to dip it in, could double the drizzle if you wanted extra.  Delicious!

OMG!  This stuff is so bad for you but so good.  I like it best when you let it cool all the way down...sounds a little weird combining candy with meat, but it's like the two were made for each other.  And while I was a little intimidated by the whole candy thermometer thing, it was actually pretty easy stuff to make.

If you are looking for an unusal sweet treat you are right on the money. My daughter begged me to make this and it wasn't bad. We didn't add the nuts as she isn't a fan but otherwise followed direction exactly. The bacon does need to be crispy. I baked mine in the oven and it came out crispy and solid for dipping in the sauce. I hade a bit of extra caremel but my daughter just put it on her french toast.

Tried to make this twice.  Both times, I couldn't get the candy to stick.  My son was so disappointed! :'(     Not to waste anything, We ended up eating the bacon separately from the "candy" once it had hardened.
