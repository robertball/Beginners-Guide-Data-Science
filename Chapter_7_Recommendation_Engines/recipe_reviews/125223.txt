I substituted strawberry preserves, because that's what I had on hand.  I was a little leery of the mustard, but it turned out great!  A unique and excellent flavor!

Awesome! AWESOME! Awesome!  I used the apricot preserves rather than the plum.  I followed the reciped with 2 minor variances.  I made the glaze and marinaded the ham in the fridge for 4 hours.  Some people we had over are not real fond of sweet ham so I did not brush the ham with the glaze while grilling.  The result was a beautiful ham that had a great flavor and was not overly sweet.  I put the glaze that the ham was marinating in in a pan and boiled it for one minutes and served it on the side for those that wanted it.  The ham turned out so pretty that my sister in law said that it looked better than the ones she saw Emeril cook on his show!!

I didn't change a thing about this recipe, and it was perfect.  I would suggest to others not to have your grill too hot, as the sugar in the glaze will burn easily.  Thanks for an easy delicious recipe!

I really enjoyed this sauce on my grilled ham.  I was skeptical at first with adding the mustard but it turned out terrific.  I will probably double the batch next time.
YUM!

This was delicious!  My kids loved it, too, and it was so easy to make.  You could do this on a weeknight.  I have a Weber grill, which you are supposed to use with a closed lid, but as the ham is already cooked, I still used an open grill as directed, on high.  My steaks were thin, about 1/2", so i cut the time down to 5 min each side, then basted and cooked about another 3 min on each side on medium high so the glaze wouldn't burn.  I used plum jelly and Dijon because I didn't have yellow mustard.  I did cut the mustard in half because Dijon can be a little intense, and I'm not a big mustard person.  I will absolutely make this again.  Served it with sweet potatoes and stringbeans and my whole family loved it.  Thanks for the great recipe!!! An update:  I've made this many times over, and have learned the recipe is VERY forgiving - now I just grill it on medium with the lid closed, flip it, and the baste it and flip twice again to cook the glaze on.  The details of cooking it don't really matter.  Additionally, I have used all kinds of jelly, depending upon what I have on hand.  And tonight I was very desperate - realized I only had grape jelly and a lime instead of lemon, and French's mustard.  It actually came out better than ever!!  My 3 1/2 year old gobbled it up!  Enjoy!!

My husband loved this recipe! He likes sweets and I don't and it was perfect for us both. The sauce was even good on the mashed potatoes that I made...sounds a little weird but trust me it was great. 

I did change the recipe a little: instead of cinnamon I added about 3 good splashes of worchtishire sauce, and I used about half the amount of regular yellow mustard and the other half a course ground honey dijon mustard. I just had these things on hand but I will totally make this again. I would probably double or triple the recipe for a larger steak but ours was only about a half inch or less thick. 

Also I did not feel like heating up the grill so I put it in a backing dish with the sauce on both sides and broiled it for about 4 or 5 minutes until the top started to bobble and darken in spots then I turned it to 400 for another 5 minutes. Perfect and no need to marinade unless you just want to. Quick and delicious meal!  Thanks!

My 5 & 8 year old kids LOVED this sauce, I enjoyed it too but my husband was not overly impressed.  But he is not a fan of ham steak any way I cook it, so I just disregarded his opinion.  :o)

I used seedless raspberry because that was what was in the fridge.  I simply microwaved the sauce ingredients for a few minutes and brushed onto the ham steak during the last few minutes of cooking.  I was cooking indoor on the stove top and I didn't want to clean burnt stuck on jelly.  It would probably be easier to clean on the grill but I didn't want to light the grill for one small ham steak.  I will use this recipe again and again, if only to satisfy the kids, because it is quick, simple and tasty.

Yum, yum!  I'm rating this a 5 even though I did make a couple minor changes.  Instead of lemon juice, I used cider vinegar (just seemed more like a grilling thing!).  Also, when I think of ham, the spice I think of is cloves (isn't that what mom and grandma studded their hams with?), so I used ground cloves instead of cinnamon; however, even though I doubled the sauce, I kept the amount of cloves at 1/8 tsp, as it has such a strong flavor, and I only wanted a hint.  This is a keeper - I think I will even try it with grilled pork chops.  Thanks for another tasty addition to the rotation.

This was great!  I have struggled with how to cook ham steaks.  If I bake or simmer them,  they end up terribly dry. Grilling is definitely the way to go. I substituted an apricot jalapeno jelly for the preserves and it was fine.  My extremely picky kids (6 and 8), who hardly eat anything, both ate a big serving, which is a HUGE testimony to how good this is :-)

As described by another reviewer. . .Awesome!    I made two small changes.  I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and also added the juice from a small can of sliced pineapple to the preserve mixture.  I brushed the glaze on the pineapple slices and grilled them the last few minutes.

Great with or without the pineapple and brown sugar.  This recipe is definitely in my 'keeper' file!

Really very good - eyeballed ingredients and added tbsp brown sugar to cut the mustard a little without adding extra preserves (used apricot & pineapple jelly).  baked in oven (too cold for grilling)  very good.

I thought this was great!  Instead of waiting till the last few minutes to rub with the glaze I just started doing it right when I put them on.  Glazed about 3 times per side.  Nice sweet flavor.  Thanks!

I made this for our Easter dinner since it was just myself, my husband and our 19 month old son.  Hubby and I really liked it, and since our son isn't hugely familiar with ham, he didn't even really try it.  Anyhow, I used the plum preserves and I cooked it in the grill pan.  Delicious!

Very good ham steak.  I followed the i ngredients and their measurements to a T.  I have to admit, I was tempted to sub ground cloves for cinnamon as that, as far I know is more traditional on ham.  I'm so glad I didn't!  This was very tasty and the flavors blended perfectly.  Thanks for a quick, easy way to dress up a ham steak.  As far as cooking method, It's raining like crazy here so I put the ham steak in a shallow pan with a little bit of water and cooked it 450 for about 10 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!  Will definitely use a again!

My family and myself enjoyed this ham. It wasn't absolutely amazing, but it was easy and quick. I found that the barbecue quickly dried out the ham, so next time I will double the glaze, put half on the bottom of a 9x13 casserole dish, arrange the ham steak on top, and brush the rest of the glaze on top. I'll bake it at 325F for 25-30min. I've found that this has worked well with other ham steak recipes and believe it will improve this one greatly. The fruity taste and cinnamon were lovely touches though!

I used low sugar apricot preserves and followed the rest of the recipe as stated.  The sauce had a very mild flavor.  We liked it but have a few other ham steak recipes that we like better. This was nice for a change though.

It was very tasty.  I used 2 1" thick ham steaks and had enough glaze to do both, although the glaze was so tasty I think I'd double it next time or at least increase it to 1 1/2.  Like others have mentioned, you can use just about any jam/jelly on hand.  I thought I had apricot preserves and realized I only had orange marmalade, but it still was fabulous.  Grilling doesn't take long - not even 8 minutes and for me, is easier to manage vs drying out my ham steaks in the skillet.

EXCELLENT!!!  I added just a pinch of cloves to basic recipe along with the cinnamon, and it was PERFECT! Don't cook the cured steak too long. About 5 minutes on both sides was enough.  8-10 minutes would have been too long, but it depends on the thickness of your cut.

Yummy!  I used the apricot preserves and just heated it in the microwave until bubbly instead of cooking it in a pan.  I cooked the ham steak in a frying pan on the stove.  My steak was only half an inch thick so it cooked faster.  I put the glaze on for the last couple minutes of cooking.  It turned out really nicely though the glaze seemed milder than I expected once it was on the meat.  Next time I may just grill/fry the ham, add some apple juice or something to the glaze to thin it, and serve it as a sauce on the side, or I may use the glaze on pork chops since the pork chop flavor wouldn't drown out the glaze flavor.

Awesome flavor with substitution of orange marmalade and addition of 1 tbsp. dark brown sugar.  This would be perfect as part of an Easter brunch!

Everyone loved this.  Too cold out to grill so I just cooked in over on 350.  Used Apricot-Pineapple preserves.  Really nice flavor, not too sweet.

I used a fresh ham steak. I also used Apricot preserves, as another reviewer suggested. All-in-all it was very good, great flavor! I will double the sauce next time as I feel it could have used more.

Not a fan of the sauce.  I didn't like the cinnamon in it.

This is an excellent recipe.  However, I used apple jelly because that is what I had and I broiled the ham.  All other ingredience were the same. Also, making more of the topping is an excellent idea because we enjoyed having the extra for our ham.

This was very good and speedy to make!  I had two ham steaks, and both flavors of preserves, so I tried each flavor on the steaks.  It's hard for my family to decide which one tasted better.

I did double the preserves in both, and added a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring.  The flavor is so good mixed with the grill taste!  Like others, the mustard sort of scared me off, but I couldn't taste it, and my husband liked that he could taste it.  Thanks for something quick, easy, and great tasting!

Absolutely delicious!  Hubby and I loved it.  I doubled the sauce, and I'm glad I did.  I used very little during the grilling process to keep the ham from burning.  I served the majority of the sauce on the side, and it was so good!

Very good Sharon and thanks so much. Hubs loves to have horseradish with his ham steak, so I added it to the mix which was a nice little addition. Great recipe!!

This is very good. The first time I made this recipe and the second time I didn't have apricot jelly so I made "Honeyed Ham Glaze" that is found on this site. Either one is a great recipe!

I had to change the recipe up because I had no yellow mustard.  I used a mild brown mustard instead and bottle lemon juice.  This was a wee bit tart (maybe because of the mustard substitution), so I added just a pinch of sugar.  My guest didn't care for fruit glazes, so when this was done heating up, I simply smeared it on my share of the ham steak we'd split and dug in.  Marvelous!  I can only imagnine how much tastier this would have been had I baked it on.  Give this a try.  You'll be glad you did!

Great recipe in a hurry!  We used blackberry preserves and can't imagine anything better.  Besides the blackberry the only deviation we made was to follow the recommended grilling instructions of med-high for 5 min. a side (thinner cut).  Will definitely do this again.

Good recipe. I used homemade strawberry jam since I didn't have the recommended flavor. Hubby loved it. Will make again.

This was great.  My steaks were smoked so I needed to reduce the grill time to 5 min per side.   I used apple butter instead of preserves, as someone else did.   I also substituted 1/2 stone ground mustard and 1/2 dijon mustard for the prepared mustard.  It was fabulous.  Use the leftover sauce on the ham.  Everyone loved it.
