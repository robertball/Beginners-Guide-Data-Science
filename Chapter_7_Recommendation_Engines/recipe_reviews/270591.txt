Great flavor as written but I think these could benefit from a better execution. As written these got way to overdone. After 20 minutes they had the perfect doneness and crispness but didn't have that perfect flavor. I recommend baking them for 10 minutes and then coating them in sweet chili and soy and then roasting them 10 minutes. At that time they should be done and have a good crisp to them. Roasting them for 20 and then broiling them was just too much in my opinion.
