This was okay.. definetly not my favourite.. I don't care for nuts, so I left them out, and the marshmellows didn't taste very good in there.. it wasn't bad, but wasn't great either... Thanks for your effort though :)

The recipe was just OK. I think I added a few too many marshmallows to it so maybe that is why I was underwhelmed with it. I did melt some chocolate and drizzle over the top to look pretty and it did.

I made it using a double boiler for the chocolate because it is less likely to burn that way

Loved this!  It wasn't hard to make at all, and the taste was great.  My husband said it was too sweet for him, but he did eat 2 pieces of it, even though he doesn't care for sweets or desserts.  My 5 year old daughter also loved it.  I will definitely be making this one again!  Thanks for sharing!

This was great, I made it into mini cheesecakes by using 1/2 an Oreo as the crust in a cupcake liner!
