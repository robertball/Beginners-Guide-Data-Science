THis was a great recipe, and pretty easy.  I read it wrong (and after reading the reviews, i think that was a good thing.  I didn't reduce it down to 1/4 cup, I reduced it to 1/4 of it's original 4 cups of liquid.  This left 1 cup of suace, which was perfect to cover the veal, and the pasta I made to go with it.  It was a thin sauce, but it was thicker than the broth was originally, and I made sure it had cooled enough so the butter thickened it and didn't get greasy.

This is outstanding dish. My wife thinks I'm culinary expert after this one. It did take longer than expected for liquid to reduce. I will cut down amount of broth next time.

You cannot expect to reduce 3 cups of broth and a cup of wine to 1/4 cup unless you have 1 hr to cook.  Add Marsala and stir in juices from the veal, heavy cream and butter.  Forget the broth!

Loved this recipe! Probably the best Marsala I've ever made. I will be trying it again soon with chicken. Definitely do NOT reduce the sauce down to 1/4 cup, though. It's just not enough sauce. I reduced to about a cup and still wish I had had more! Will probably reduce to 1 1/2 cups next  time. Also, I was thinking about omiting the butter at the end but ended up leaving it. Definitely a good idea because finishing the sauce with the butter is the perfect touch! 5 stars!

Although the basic ingredients in this recipe are great, following the instructions and amounts exactly would yield an undesirable result.  I agree with another reviewer, who felt that it would take much longer than 30 min. to reduce 2 cups of chicken stock, 1 cup of beef stock, and 1 cup of marsala.  I omitted 1 cup of stock, and it still took over 30 min. to reduce it to a suitable thickness.  The recipe calls for way too much flour for dredging the veal, but fortunately you will need to add some of it to your scrapings in your pan in order to thicken this much liquid.  Of course, one could just reduce the sauce longer, but the problem is that the veal is sitting in the oven the whole time, and will be shockingly overdone by then.  I would avoid reducing or omitting the butter from the sauce, as this creats a great velvety texture.

This recipe was tremendous. I have tried many Marsala recipes, but this is by far the only one I have ever made that is “Second To None”. The only change I made was to reduce the chicken broth to one cup.  My family likes a lot of gravy/sauce so I did not reduce the liquid, however, I did thicken it with flour which enabled it to stay on the pasta.  I rated this with 5 STARS, although it Rated a 10 at our dinner table.  Thanks Nan for sharing.☺

Excellent!!! We substitute pork tenderloin for veal on Veal Scallopini so I tried the same in this. Worked perfect !! I actually like the pork a lot better than veal. Will make this often as we are big Marsala fans. I didn't let it cook down as far as 1/4 cup either. Wanted lots of sauce !! Pounded the pork down to thin pieces also !!!

The flavor was delicious and my husband and I loved it.  I served it over egg noodles.  I made the mistake of NOT using low sodium broth, and it was too salty, so the noodles toned that down some.  I agree with other raters about the reduction.  After 30 minutes it didn't look like it was going to thicken or reduce a whole lot, so I added a little flour, reduced to about 1 to 1 1/2 cups, and I needed that much as we love sauce.  Thank you for the recipe, my first time making marsala and I will make this a regular part of my meals now.

Excellent recipe.  I was not able to find veal so I used 1 1/2 pounds of chicken breast pieces and it turned out great!  The Marsala gave a rich flavor and mushroom sauce was superb.  I added cornstarch to some broth and thickened the sauce, intentionally keeping the sauce from reducing as a lot of sauce is much better than almost no sauce.  If anything, more broth should be added so the sauce is plentiful.  I skipped the addition of butter at the end as totally unnecessary.  I served the chicken Marsala adjacent to olive-oiled and parmesan covered tri-color noodles.  For dessert: creme brule.  Wish you were here!

Wonderful recipe in every way. I included turkey breast slices along with the veal because my husband doesn't eat beef. Served it with angel hair pasta (dressed with a small amount butter, a little extra virgin olive oil, a touch of garlic and a few shavings of parmesan cheese.) Three of us polished off 6 servings! I added a little more garlic and forgot the finishing butter, but no matter--we're going to have this often (when we're not counting calories!)

Very good.  I didn't have shallots so I used chives.  I didn't have beef broth, and with the recommendations of others that there was too much liquid, I just left that out. I still added 1 Tablespoon of corn starch to thicken it.   I forgot to add the butter, next time I'll try it, but we didn't miss it.

This was the best veal marsala I ever had.  The only changes I made were:  I used less broth (2 cups total) less flour (about 1/2 cup).  I didn't have shallots so I used scallions instead.  It took a while to cook down but the veal was being kept warm in the oven and the end result made it worth the wait.  
My husband absolutely loved it and it will be a regular with us.

This recipe was great.  I also cut the broth down to 1 and 1/2 cups from 3 cups.  Made plenty of sauce and sprinkled about 1 tspb. of flour to thicken in order to speed up the cook time.

You won't find a better marsala sauce in a restaurant. And simple enough to add to your regular lineup.

Excellent sauce!  Followed recipe as written, except I did not wait till the sauce reduced so much, because I wanted to serve it on top of egg noodles, too.  It was great!

This was very, very good. I'll cook it a few more times before it's finally delicious. I did not change the recipe, except that I used Land O'Lakes "Fresh Buttery Spread" instead of butter, and I did not use any flour or cornstarch because I wanted a low-carb version. I also failed to use low-sodium beef and chicken broth, and that made a big difference because I did reduce the sauce all the way down to about half a cup, and so the sauce, though very, very good, was salty. Next time, I will definitely use low-sodium stock. Also, when I remake this (and I definitely will), I will add the mushrooms (which I always sautee separately) after reducing the sauce, and I will sautee the veal at the end. Keeping the veal in the oven did seem to make it just a tad less tender, I think.

The recipe was fine until the sauce preparation phase. It took forever to reduce 3 cups of liquid to 1/4 cup, I finally threw out almost all the sauce in an attempt to get it to thicken but it did not work. The meat was fine but unless you have lots of time to make the sauce reduction I would stay away from this recipe.

The sauce is delicious!  I made the recipe for 3 people so reduced the quantity of ingredients a bit.  I also used 4 veal scaloppini which require very little cooking. I skipped step 1 and 2 in the recipe (dredging, searing and warming).  I sauteed the mushrooms and shallots in the olive oil.  I made the marsala sauce in the same skillet but used only 1/2 of the broth the recipe calls for (1 cup chicken broth, 1/2 cup beef broth).  I reduced the sauce to about 1 1/2 cups but found it a bit runny so I added a bit of cornstarch mixed with water to thicken and cooked the veal in the sauce.

March 11, 2010 This menu is a keeper. Some revisions to the recipe. I used one can of beef broth and one can of chicken broth. All the other ingredients remained as noted. I did add 2 Tbs of flour to the mix and reduced to one and one halp cups. It was really great. I served it with noodles and asparagus. Also lit the candles and had some Merlo wine. The wife was,say the least, astonished. We will make it a regular. Many thanks for the Recipe. Chef Buddy

I gave this recipe 4 stars even though I did not try it because I make chicken marsala almost exactly like this and it is delicious  -- ALTHOUGH, I think there may be a mistake in the amounts given for the marsala and the broth.  It would take a very long time for 4(four) cups of liquid to reduce to 1/4 cup.

I made this with pork and found it easy to make and to cut in half since there are only two of us.  My wife's reaction was, "This is way too sweet; I don't like sweet meat," so I guess I won't be making it again, but if the sweetness isn't a problem for you, give it a try.

very good recipe, but allow much more time for the reduction of the broth esp if you scale the recipe up.

I've made this dish several times and I really like this simple recipe.  I made some minor changes: I added 2 cups of Marsala and 2 cups of Beef Broth only (no chicken broth).

Very good.  I followed directions exactly but I also ended up thickening the sauce as other reviewers mentioned with flour to make the process go faster.  The sauce was so good.  Thanks Nan

Very good marsala!  If scaling to make larger amounts, you will need to either reduce the amount of broth or thicken the sauce.  I didn't add butter and it still turned out great.  Will definitely make again!

No changes other than had to use flour to get sauce to thicken. Served over noodles, quite tasty.

We love the sauce in this recipe and make it several times a year.  I follow it pretty much as written except for reduction to 1/4 cup at the end.  That must be an error as other comments point out.  Instead I reduce to 1/4 of original volume or about 1.5 cups.

In the early afternoon, I roast whole cloves of garlic drizzled with olive oil(but only to the point the garlic is done and not  overcooked so it turns to mush or paste).  I set  it aside to cool and finally I peel off the skins of the  garlic and set the roasted whole garlic aside. Then I make this recipe without or with just a tiny amount of garlic . At the end I add liberal quantities of the cooled but still whole roasted garlic to the pan and just let the garlic warm up before serving it. Finally I serve the Marsala Sauce over the Veal Medallions with very thin al dente spaghetti.

I prefer to use Porcini or small Portobello mushrooms  instead of other types. At special times, I have even made this with Morels. 

This is always a solic crowd pleaser!!

This dish was excellent! Lots of compliments from my husband and 12 year old! We traded the scallions for some green onions and white onion.  We traded the veal for thin cut pork chops. Also, we used one can of beef broth and one can of chicken broth and two beef bullion cubes.  We added a little corn starch also so there would be more broth.  We still almost did not have enough. Will not let it boil down so much next time. We had to use more olive oil than stated because some of the flour did not even get coated with just one tbsp of oil. We used salted butter because I did not want to purchase unsalted for this one recipe, and it tasted wonderful anyway. We also like a lot of garlic, so we added a little more.  I had never had Marsala sauce, but my husband eats it every time we go out, and he went ga-ga over it.  This is definitely a keeper!!!

This is not a dish I make very often, so I was looking for a fairly simple, straightforward recipe. This is it. Easy to follow instructions, basic ingredients, delicious results.

This is a delicious recipe. If you do not want to wait the 30 minutes to reduce the stock, add 1 teaspoon of cornstarch, and you will have a nice stock in 15 minutes.

Very good. I cut down the amont of stock to 1 1/2 cups and used only chicken stock.  I used 1 tbs of butter but it would have still been good without.

Delicious! And great, warm feeling when done eating too! Used reisling instead of Marsala, excellent sub. Also used 1/4 purple onion diced instead of shallot. Smells great while cooking too. Thanks!

We are actually Big Veal Marsala lovers in my house and this recipe got a thumbs up!  I liked using the shallots instead of onions, makes for a sweeter flavor.  I also added a slice of prosciutto ham on each piece of veal after pounding.  I used toothpicks to keep it in place. I would suggest this to HUNGRYJOHN to cut down on the sweet and add some salty flavor.  It was delicious and pretty quick to make.  Thanks for the recipe, Nan!  Will definitely use it again!

This recipe is a classic.  I make this often for special occasions.  I only use beef broth and not as much as is stated in this recipe.
