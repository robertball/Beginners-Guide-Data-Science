I hate to disagree with so many people, but I made this mix because of all the positive reviews and was so disapointed!  I was smoking a beef brisket, a pork roast, and some chicken and used this mix on all three. WAAAAAAAAY too salty!!!  I am not watching my salt intake, or on a salt free diet but I felt like Lot's wife after eating this meat seasoned with this rub. Recipe calls for 16 ounces of salt seasoning (I used Lawreys) and truly believe if I had cut that in half, it would still be way too salty.  We didn't even taste any of the other seasonings. so sorry to give a negative review but I fixed it according to measurements.

My only complaint with this rub is it made soooo much, which is okay because you can keep it for later use.  It gave a very good flavor to my brisket.

Prepared BBQ beef for a family function and all raved about the beef.  It was very easy to prepare and we slow cooked the beef (20lbs)for nearly 24 hours.

This is an excellent rub. I take a massive beef brisket, rub it down good, pour a couple of jars of barbeque concentrate over it, wrap it in foil and let it sit for about 2 hours before slow smoking it at 250 degrees for 16-24 hrs. The tenderness and the subtle spices in the rub are indescribable. Highly recommended, though it does make a LOT of rub (save in a container and use later, still good).

We were in charge of making/smoking the brisket for my dad's 65th birthday party. I made this up, exactly to recipe, on Tuesday. Placed in an airtight container. Rubbed on 12 lbs. brisket on Thursday morning. Put brisket in smoker Saturday evening, took it out 12 hours later, today (Sunday), and it was out of this world!!!!! Many, many compliments on the meat. The brisket was 12 lbs and we still had tons leftover. Would recommend this recipe. Thanks!

Greatest way to flavor ribs I have ever used.  I precooked the ribs with this rub and used an off the shelf plain BBQ sauce.  They were still as good or better than any rib at a summer cook-off.

I needed a rub recipe for beef ribs quickly & found this one.  Even though we did not have seasoning salt, the dry mesquite mix or the time to let the rub sit on the meat for 2 hours, our ribs were great.  My husband did not even use his favorite BBQ sauce.  FYI - I reduced the recipe using the calculator for a portion servig 6.

Great flavors, not too sweet, but enough spice.  I "marinated" some pork country ribs overnight with the rub.  Grilled them in foil with a little water for several hours.  The last 20 minutes, coked them straight on the grill, brushing good store-bought barbeque sauce  on the last few minutes on each side.  Got rants and raves, and I never cook ribs.  Want to try this on a tri-tip next!

We used this rub on an 8 lb brisket and it had a lot of flavor. Next time, I'll scale the recipe down a bit since we had a lot of extra and maybe cut down on the salts a bit more.  Thanks for the recipe!

Thsi is way salty. We used it on some ribs and it was way way way to salty. I am a lover of salt, I salt EVERYTHING and this even made me pucker a little. Also this make a whole bunch. We didn't use it all and was saving the rest for later...after some adjustment of more sugar, pepper and some onion powder it is now edible.

UPDATE - AUGUST 8, 2012:  I've now used this rub on chicken a couple times and the flavor is amazing!  I'm leaving my rating at four stars because it would still be too salty if I had used garlic salt instead of granulated garlic, but I'll be keeping a batch of this in my spice cabinet at all times from now on!  **** July 2, 2012:  This was a pretty good rub, but I'm glad I didn't have garlic salt available and used granulated garlic instead or it would have been way too salty.  I cut the recipe down to 15 servings and weighed out 4 ounces of seasoned salt on my digital kitchen scale.  I used this rub on a pork loin roast and the flavor was really good.  I can't wait to try it on some baby back ribs!

This rub was great.  I used it on a brisket before smoking it.  Wonderful flavor!  I only made 1/4 of this recipe, coated a 10 lb brisket and have plenty left over

This is EXCELLENT!  I put it on the steaks 4 hours before they were cooked...I got rave reviews!  Everyone thought it was store-bought!

I have tried many reciepts from this site and by far this had to be the only one I didn't like. It was way to salty. I put it on a 5lb brisket and cooked it all night. Smelled wonderful. Took it out and cut a piece off and "wow" it was so salty it made my teeth hurt. I will not be using this one anytime in the future, but thanks for the reciept anyway.

On it's own, it seems quite a bit sweeter than I am used to.  I did add several big dashes of hot sauce.  I was almost 1/2c short on the maple syrup, so put the rest in as honey, full disclosure, but next time I will try cutting the amount of brown sugar.  I am waiting to see what my brisket tastes like with the sauce - I may change my mind.

I put it on pork loin rib chops on both sides and a sprinkle of garlic powder on one side and beat them in with a flat tenderizer hammer. They sat for only 1/2 an hour maybe and then bbq them with normal sauce and they are delicious. Can't wait to try to on a chicken like someone said.

This rub was just what I was looking for. I made a smoked briscut using this rub and my 6 1/2 lb briscut was gone in less than 30 minutes. Sweet and salty with a kick. I will definitely always keep some of this on hand.
