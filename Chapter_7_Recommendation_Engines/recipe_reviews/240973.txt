I omitted the parmesan cheese  (allergies) and they were still the best meatballs i have ever made. the entire family liked them!  I also used almond flour.

I have been using this site for many many years and never reviewed anything.  I had to let others know that this is a totally kid friendly recipe!  Not only were these meatballs were very moist and tasty, but more importantly, my picky seven year old gobbled them up!  I'm not sure if I didn't use enough eggplant, but I could barely taste it (a positive in my son's book).  I might use more next time.  I just put all of the veggies in my food processor to start (after roasting the eggplant) and then added the meat, bread crumbs with herbs (I didn't have almond flour) and egg, pulsed, and done.  So easy.   This was a great way to use up our eggplant, thank you!

A delicious and healthy meal!   I sautéed onions and garlic, added half to the meatballs and used the other half to boost the flavor on the bottled sauce I was using.  I included the Parmesan cheese and used Italian-flavored panko breadcrumbs instead of almond flour.  I let the roasted, scooped eggplant sit in a colander while I prepared the rest of the ingredients, which got rid of a lot of liquid.  Once everything was mixed I cooked a small amount to check the seasoning.  This led me to add some red pepper flakes and a little more basil.  I formed the meatballs by hand, which was easy and made them round and pretty.  While they were baking I added mushrooms to the saucepan, added the bottled sauce and tweaked the seasonings.  The baked meatballs were added to the sauce, where they simmered until my guests arrived.  A couple of notes - I only made one half-sheet of meatballs.   The little left over made a great burger for me the next day.  I only used one bottle of sauce, but a lot was soaked up by the meatballs.  Next time I will add more.  My guests raved over the food.  There were only three of us, but I had very few leftovers.

I followed the directions exactly.  The finished meatballs were very tender. When I make these again, and I will--I will add more garlic or some aromatic to jump up the flavor a touch. Oh, I used prepared, uncooked chicken sausage.

Very good.  I mixed it all up in a food processor starting with the hardest vegetables first.  The mixture is pretty gooey this way.  However, it all cooked up into nice, firm and tasty meatballs.

So this got me to write a comment after cooking many recipes posted on this site. I grew eggplant because I like to experiment and like the beauty of the plant. I had never cooked it but this recipe is awesome!  Even my picky 4th grader loved it and asked for 2nds after he initially whined and complained he didn't want eggplant. I added a little cyan pepper and used bread crumbs. I will soon make this again - it was a huge success.

This was very good and a great way to get my son to eat eggplant.  I did make a couple of changes due to not having some ingredients on hand. I  used ground whole wheat crackers instead of almond flour or breadcrumbs and I add about 1/2 a pound of ground pork to the ground turkey. Instead of making meatballs, I made a meatloaf by putting the meat mixture in a loaf pan and adding some barbecue sauce on top. Great recipe! Thanks.

Just made this. With the exception of carrots-which would have made it sweet. We are loving it.  Will definitely make again.   I microwaved the eggplant halves for 6 min and it was the perfect amount of time.

These were great. Even my 3 year old and 1 year old liked them. Omitted Parmesan due to dairy intolerance and just dipped in ketchup or bbq sauce instead of the marinara. Next time we will FINELY chop onion and use less of it but otherwise awesome.

Made almost according to recipe. I subbed in the breadcrumbs as recommended for the almond flour.  Also used ground beef instead of turkey. Absolutely delicious! The whole family gobbled them up, including my 4 yr and 18 month old. Also, they freeze well. We warmed up half the batch two weeks later and they were still to die for! This is going to be come a standard fare freezer meal for us (which makes for fast prep time for family meals.)

This is a great recipe for eggplant. I used ground chicken instead of turkey. I added hot pepper flakes (I read that in another review) and thought it still missed something. I also browned them in the skillet before baking them in the oven.

Made it just like it says pretty much. I sliced some garlic and cooked it under the eggplant which infused it with awesome flavor. Then I cooked them on stove top in olive oil. These were awesome paired with Italian greens and grilled summer squash.

My kids 4&7 loved this dish! Put it over spaghetti squash and they gobbled it up! 2nd time double the recipe. Half eggplant and half zucchini because that's what I had on hand. Delicious!!

SO moist and SO juicy!!  I don't think I can have meatballs any other way now!  I've made these twice.  The first time with extra lean ground beef and the second time with extra lean ground turkey. Both times they were absolutely delicious!

I used ground beef (b/c that's what I had) and left out the cheese, and these turned out great! Using an ice cream scoop made the meatballs a little larger than I expected, but the kids called them mini-meatloaves and eat everything. They're back on the menu this week.

These were still excellent even though I forgot to put the carrots in (dummy) and this was still amazing. They are moist, I even ate some without sauce. Definitely will make again.

This is really good! I left out the cheese, used fresh herbs, and added a bit more seasoning. I’m not a fan of turkey but I had some in the freezer. I’d make these again.

I tweaked this recipe a little and my family loved the final result:  I used ground beef instead of turkey, white flour instead of almond flour, and added a 1/2 tsp of fennel seed (which I add to all my Italian dishes).  I’ll definitely be making this again!

I LOVED this recipe. I will definitely make again!!!  I roasted the garlic cloves along with the eggplant to add another layer of flavor and left out the dried herbs because I didn’t have them. Came out amazing and just what I was looking for since I’m trying to ease my way into the keto diet. Saving to my favorites.

I made these and they came out awesome! Instead of almond meal, I seasoned some plain breadcrumbs and pulsed in the food processor. I also used fresh herbs instead of dried (a lot more than the recipe calls for). My picky 3 year old ate them up! Tip: pair with tzaziki instead of marinara.

Made this for the first time and I don't know if it was user error or what, but I will do things a bit differently next time.  My meatballs were very, very moist, so next time I will drain the eggplant for a bit  before mixing it in.  Plus, this took a VERY long time cook (over and hour) and the meatballs fell apart very easily.  In addition I will grease a baking sheet directly and leave off the foil because the meatballs stuck to it terribly.  And finally I think will use breadcrumbs next time instead of almond flour for a better consistency.  Flavor is very good though!

Very tasty, very moist, very creative meatballs!  I made it exact to recipe... using optional ground beef vs. turkey, optional bread crumbs vs. almond flour, and optional fresh basil vs. dried.  And I did use parmesan cheese.  I will absolutely make them again!
