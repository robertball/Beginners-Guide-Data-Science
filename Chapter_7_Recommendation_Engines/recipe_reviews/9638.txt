Great to try, but Vanilla Wafer Cookie recipe is better.

These were pretty easy, but they lacked flavor and weren't very pretty or "waferish".  I will probably make them again, only with clear vanilla and some kind of frosting.  Good place to start, just needs something to jazz it up a little ;)

I was thinking these would be like nilla wafers in the box,but my family loved them. I used them with a banana pudding recipe on this site.

I made these twice. First as written, but the dough was awfully sticky (even after chilling 5+ hours) and the cookies were not waferish and they were bland, as other reviewers have said. 

So the second time, I substituted condensed milk for half of the milk called for. I also added a tsp cinnamon. The dough was more workable, but I still wasn't impressed with the results. I will not save this recipe.

These tasted a little like a commercial wafer, but not like I wished they would have.  I will continue to make these for my kids, but will be on the look out for a more airy-er, vanilla tasting cookie.

flavor good, however i noticed they seem to be soft after time recommended for baking. However, they harden as they cool down.
