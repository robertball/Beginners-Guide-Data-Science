I hate to say this recipe was terrible because I think used as a pasta sauce it would be okay, however, it would need to be thinned down some for a sauce and more spices added. The tomato paste was way too overbearing in this spread. I definitely will not make this again unless my playing with it will turn it into a great pasta sauce.

This recipe is wonderful.  So flavorful, it makes a great substitute for other kinds of sandwich spreads.

Absolutely phenomenal.  I used it as a dipping sauce for foccacia and it was perfect.  It was simple and quick to make and drew rave reviews.  I'm sure I'll be making this one all the time.

I made this receipe but used  more olive oil to make it less like a paste.  I froze the spread to have on hand for later use.  It is delicious.

This would be good if it was called tomato and basil dip or use as a pizza sauce, or if you thinned it out, it would be a wonderful pasta sauce. But as a Sun dried tomato spread, you cannot even taste the sun dried tomato part. Dip is good yes, but I was looking for a sun dried tomato dip. I added mozzarella cheese, and heated in the microwave and turned it into a pizza dip.

Not bad.  I added way more basil & sugar than the recipe called for (personal tastes), the oil from the sun dried tomatoes, plus a little extra olive oil because as is, it was a little thick.  Something different, although I don't know if I'll make it again.  Thanks.   Jan 13th...I still stand by my changes, but I just had about a 1/2 cup left-over spread with some left-over shredded rotisserie chicken, white rice & parmesan cheese...yum!   Hmmmm....I may find a different use for this recipe...

In general the recipe was great and my guests enjoyed it. I made a couple of minor changes and added some tomato paste (for more tomato flavor) and additional „italian“ spices and less garlic. I would make it again.

This is really good. Used on chicken Panini's.  Cheaper than buying in the store. Oh, and I have frozen this and the texture is okay if using again in recipe, not for a spread though.
