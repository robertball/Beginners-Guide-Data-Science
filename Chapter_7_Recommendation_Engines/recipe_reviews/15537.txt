Very good!  I have made this recipe twice.  The first time I pretty much stuck to the recipe and my husband thought the dish was too sweet and cinnamon tasting, although I thought it was fine.  The second time I made it for our Christmas Eve dinner and used 50% more potatoes but kept the rest of the ingrediant amounts the same.  It was also good that way - the topping adds plenty of sweetness to the dish.  I noticed some reviewers thought the dish was too mushy but I found it to be the same consistency as other sweet potato dishes I have had before.  I made this dish the night before (without the topping) and stored it in the refrigerator overnight.  That way I just had to mix up the topping and put it in the oven on the day of our dinner.

I should have listened to my instincts when they told me NOT to melt the butter for the topping!! It turned into one pastey lump, not struesel-like, like I'm sure it was intented to be. Overall the taste was pretty yummy, and I would make it again...but next time I would cut the butter into the topping mix COLD--or barely softened--like you would for a regular struesel-type mix.

This is a great recipe, largely because it can be varied a great deal with excellent results everytime.  I have made this as directed (very rich and sweet, much like a pie), used cream and oj, but no condensed milk (very nice lighter orangey flavor), using rinsed canned yams and no sugar (works fine)... My only note of caution would be that on the topping, do not add the flour to the butter, add the sugar and nuts to the butter, then the flour, this avoids making a paste.

This recipe is phenomenal. I made it for my school's Thanksgiving feast and got so many requests for the recipe that I had to go make copies! I do believe it takes longer than 15 minutes to prep, however. I know it takes a while to cook the sweet potatoes. I use fresh ones which take at least half an hour in the microwave or longer in the oven. But, once the whole thing is done.... Mmmmm!!! The other thing to remember is to add the liquids slowly when blending so that the whole thing becomes creamy, otherwise it'll be very thick. I tend to add a little more o.j. and/or evaporated milk if that happens. On the whole, however, this is a great recipe- one I'll be making this year!!

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving (my first time cooking) and it was wonderful, I usually don't really care for sweet potatoes, I was mainly making it for my hubby, but this was very yummy (especially the topping) I ended up making it again for Christmas the only difference is this time I used canned swt. potatoes just to cut down on cooking time and prepared the dish the night before.  It turned out even better this time around. Thank you for a great recipe.

Love this recipe.  I added more butter to the brown sugar topping.  I also added 1/3 cup golden rum to the sweet potato filling.  Wonderful flavor--will be making this again.  I like the fact that there are no eggs in it (lol...although I did add calories with booze!)

I used this recipe in a dorm kitchen and it turned out amazing, even in such strenuous circumstances.  The streusel-like topping is only enhanced by the addition of allspice; allspice also makes an excellent addition to the casserole itself.  
I found that steaming the cubed sweet potatoes in my rice cooker for about 30 minutes made for an ideal mashing consistency.  They smashed right up!

Tastes just like the version with eggs, in my opinion.  I couldn't taste the orange juice at all but then I didn't really want a strong orange juice taste so that was fine by me.  Unfortunately I always seem to overcook the sweet potatoes so watch out for that!

This is scrumptious!  Thanks so much Carolyn. Considering sweet potatoes are so varied in size does anyone know how many mashed cups of potatoes to use?

A little too orange flavored for me. I would not add O.J. if I were to do it again.

Great Hit for Thanksgiving!!  I had made everything according to the recipe except, I used Splenda sugar instead of white sugar...I used real sweet potatoes (peeled, cubed, and put in boiling water)...mash 80% of the way (not purred).  I put all ingredients together the night before Thanksgiving (except the topping), then I refrigerated it.  Thanksgiving morning, I made the topping and put it on top of the sweet potato casserole and put in the oven.  The last 15 minutes I topped it off with a whole bag of miniature marshmallows.  Make sure the marshmallows turn a light brown up top and it gives a nice crunch to the marshmallow.  This recipe is a keeper!! My family raved about this the entire night!  The entire casserole was gone...Thank goodness, I had some :)

Lovely!  I wouldn't melt the butter for the topping--just cut it in with the other topping ingredients or you won't be sprinkling it, you'll be spreading it.

Made this 4 times between Thanksgiving and New Years. So good!  I cut the sugar in half but otherwise did this exactly as written. It's perfect- the leftovers are even good for breakfast!

I was looking for an easy recipe to take to Thanksgiving dinner, only two in my family really like sweet potatoes so they are not a priority and the dishes I remember from my youth all had little marshmallows on top.  I wanted something different.  I was making these at someone else's house so I had to improvise a bit, used all oj and no evap milk.  They were still amazing.  Even my bil tried them and liked them, and he had never eaten them before.  Guess there are 3 of us who like them now!

I brought this for Thanksgiving a few years ago and now my family demands that I bring it for every holiday. It is so good. It could almost serve as a dessert. I add more cinnamon and only add the evaported milk if I happen to have a can open already. Also, DO NOT MELT the butter for the topping. Just have it softened.

I have made many different sweet potato recipes and this one is by far THE BEST!!! It is so easy to make and delicious. I made this for Thanksgiving and my mom (who loves sweet potatoes) was concerned that I was trying yet again another recipe. She has made them her way for years, but now that I do the cooking I was looking to begin some of my own traditions. She made her concerns very clear to me, but after one bite she couldn't get enough!!! Everyone said this was their favorite dish and have asked me to make it for xmas! The OJ brings out the flavor of the sweet potatoes and its not to sweet. The topping is sweet so if you have family who prefers not so sweet just try adding the topping to only half the recipe or not at all if you prefer the non sweet version.

This was a hit @ Thanksgiving! I like it b/c it isn't too sweet.....the sweet potatoes are just enhanced, not covered up w/ sugar. I will definitely be making this again & again. Thanks!

Excellent! I subbed whole milk for the evaporated. Used less sugar. Used fresh squeezed orange juice & a tbs of my special blend of pumpkin pie spice (from this site). Really tasty! Thanks.

REALLY a delicious dish!  Instead of having just sweet potatoes, I also added yams for color, nutrients, and a different taste.  I cleaned and baked them (skins on) and then mashed them.  The skins added a nice texture - make sure they are chopped though.  Everybody loved this dish, and I used Smart Balance in place of the regular butter so that it was a tad healthier.  5 stars for this recipe!

Absolutely perfect- I would note that the servings size seems to be a bit off- I don't think for Christmas or Thanksgiving anyone would eat a full sweet potato serving size, so figure a recipe for 6 will probably serve 10 or so based on this recipe.  The flavor was perfect- even those in the family who don't like sweet potatoes generally LOVED this recipe. Absolutely amazing!

This was excellent and a huge hit from a family that isn't crazy about sweet potatoes!  I did use 2 eggs beaten, canned sweet potatoes, less white sugar (1/4 cup) and less flour for the topping (1/4 cup).  It will definitely become a family recipe!

I made this along with the traditional sweet potatoes w/marshmellows.  At the end of the thanksgiving feast, there was none of this one and over half a pan of the other one left.  What a hit!  I loved it!  I'll be making it often :)

I have made this recipe every Thanksgiving for five years. Love it! It is great as a leftover treat too. Just warm up a bowl and put some fresh whipped cream on top. It is like pie in a dish.

I made pretty close to as instructed, eyeballing all the measurements and using drained canned yams. I also added a little orange peel and crushed pineapple. For the topping I used 1 cup of brown sugar, a little less than 1/2 cup melted butter, and a half box of vanilla wafers crushed plus the pecans. Even though the topping is very wet, if you cook it long enough and let it sit out out cool long enough it hardens up and gets crunchy and it so delicious!

My husband and I really liked this recipe. After reducing the amount of servings, I followed it exactly. Neither of us thought it to be too sweet. I put it together earlier in the day, including putting the topping on, then heated it while cooking the rest of the meal. The consistency was not at all runny or mushy. I thought it was delicious - thank you for posting!!

This recipe has been on our Thanksgiving menu for several years now.  My husbands' uncle (who has since passed away)loved it. My secret for this recipe is that I use baked sweet potatoes.  It makes all the difference in the world.

This recipe is really great.  My husband and I both raved about it.  I made only tiny, minor alterations to the recipe.  I used 3 cans (15 oz.) of sweet potatoes, used 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, and I topped it with marshmallows.  It was the best I have ever eaten!!  This will soon be another holiday family tradition.  Thanks, Carolyn!!

Very easy and pleasing to the palate.  Omitted the pecans due to nut allergies.  Could easily be used for pies.

I was needing this to resurrect some leftover sweet potatoes.  Turned out great.  Topping is crunchy and sweet.  Although I am personally not big on sweet (a little too much for me, didn't eat topping) others liked it. Will use it again.

I love sweet potatoes!  This casserole just didn't do it for me.  The potatoe mixture tasted great but the topping wasn't quite what I was looking for.  It tasted a bit too "floury" and the texture resembled a cake more than anything.  I'll try the potatoe mixture with a different topping next time.

I whipped the potatoes with a hand mixer to make the base creamier and added marshmellows on top (when the dish is done cooking, add marshmellows on top and put the sweet potato dish back in the oven for 10 minutes to make the marshmellows golden brown)

I made this recipe at Thanksgiving.  People commented that it tasted like pumpkin pie.  I thought it was quite good, but a little mushy.  Don't mash the sweet potatoes too much.

It was a mistake to make this without the nuts(due to food allergy). This was too sweet, more like a pie filling than a side dish.

I did bake my very large sweet potatoes 60 minutes before mashing. They came out great- skins peeled off very easily.

This dish is a keeper.  Yummy, easy, will make again.  Do cut the butter in cold.  Do cut back on the white sugar - it's sweet enough without so much.

I decided to try this sweet potato casserole for Thanksgiving rather than my recipe I have used for years.  This was rated so highly and I just knew it was going to be a hit.  Unfortunately, my family(14 of us!)was asking what I had done to the casserole.  They ate it but asked that I not use this recipe again.  The cinnamon overpowers the sweet potatoes.  I will not be making this again.

Excellent!  I followed the advice and cut cold butter into the topping.  Will definitely keep this one.

This dish was my contribution to Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit!  Everybody thought it was delicious... even my mother who does not typically eat sweet potatoes.

This was awesome!!! I made it for Thanksgiving, and changed just a couple things. I added some maple syrup to the topping before I put it on, and I sprinkled the potatoes with mini marshmallows before I put the brown sugar/maple/pecan topping on. Delicious!!!

I made this for Christmas and everyone just loved it.  Even my brother who is the pickiest  eater I know said that this was the best sweet potato dish that he's ever had!  I used chopped walnuts instead of pecans for the topping (only because I forgot to buy pecans)and it was delicious!  I'll definately make this again.

I made this casserole for the first time and served it for Thanksgiving dinner.  My guests devoured this dish...most eating sweet potatoes who normally don't eat them at all!  I made the dish, right down to the nut topping and refrigerated until an hour or so before I wanted to put it in the oven.  I baked it just before serving and it was wonderful.  The pecan topping makes it a hit!

This turned out fabulous!
I made it with diabetic sugar instead of real sugar, and it tasted delicious.  Couldn't even tell the difference!

My family loves this recipe! I have been making this for a few years now and can't believe that I haven't rated it yet.  I was just asked again to make this for a friend's dinner.  I always use canned sweet potatoes and cut back on the sugar - I use 1 large can and one small can drained.  I make it just as the recipe says and it always comes out perfect - the orange juice flavor is a nice surprise.  It really is almost like dessert - sooo good!!!  I do think the amount of the stated recipe makes more like 10-12 servings, because it is awfully sweet - people usually don't eat a ton of it at a time, but it's so worth it....

This was a really great recipe and easy to make.  I changed things around a bit as I didn't have all the ingredients so I left out the orange juice and sugar and used condensed sweetened milk instead.

This is the best!  I've taken this dish to so many parties and everytime I get a handful of people begging me for the recipe!  I orignally tried this out b/c my BIL is allergic to eggs, but I found that you don't miss them at all. The only thing I changed is I eliminate the orange juice simply b/c I don't prefer the citrus taste (kinda over powering).  Other than that I keep everything the same and it's fantastic!

Excellent recipe!  I halve the sugar in the     
sweet potato mixture as the topping is plenty sweet (and very good!).  It smells
incredible as it's cooking and always a hit well I make it.  Makes a great Thanksgiving or Christmas side dish.

Tried it for the Thanksgiving dinner. Delicious recipie. The topping was scrumptious. I reduced the white sugar amount and substituted SPLENDA. I also substituted 1/2& 1/2 for the evaported milk.

This recipe wasn't much different from most I have tried, but it was ok. I didn't do the topping because I was running out of time and I panicked, but I think it would have made all the difference in the world if I had.

I used 8 smallish sweet potatoes, and could have used at least one more. I also used half Splenda and half sugar. This was utterly delicious, and everyone at our Thanksgiving dinner raved and went back for seconds. The topping absolutely makes it! Some reviews have said the potatoes were too mushy. I suggest boiling them for a shorter time before mashing them. A real winner!!

Better than the recipe I have been using - eggs not necessary!  Just the right amount of sweetness.  The hint of orange is nice, and the crunchy topping.  The relatives loved this at Thanksgiving and asked for the recipe.  Thanks!

Fantastic!  I made sweet potatoes this year (as a favor to my mom) and I ended up going back for seconds.  It is so sweet and smooth.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks Carolyn!

This is fantastic!  Thank you Carolyn.  I made this last year and plan to make it every year from now on.  I will probably cut down a bit on the sugar though.  It was just a bit too sweet.

This was a big hit at our last family gathering.  I did add a bit more OJ and Pet Milk. I will certainly use this one again and again.

This casserole turned out GREAT.  Took a little longer than expected (the middle of the topping too longer to brown), but it was worth the wait. 
I received tons of compliments on this recipe. Thanks!

This was wonderful!!  I got so many compliments on this dish.  Everyone loved it.  I decided to use whipping cream instead of orange juice because I don't like orange juice.  I will be using this recipe again!

Prepared this for Thanksgiving.  Everyone enjoyed it -- even sweet potato haters.  Added a little extra spice to potato mixture.  Would adjust 6 potatoes to cups of potatoes to make mixture less mushy.

This was a big hit even with the nonsweet potato lovers! When the dish was finished cooking for 45 minutes, I added minimarshmallows on top of the topping and put back in the oven for an extra few minutes to brown.  YUMMIE!!!!!!

best sweet potato dish ever. Even won over an "I-hate-yams" man. 
Great tasting dish!!

Pretty good. I cut the recipe in half (it was very small, but we had tons of food so it was plenty for six adults- and two children who just tasted it); and added a tiny bit less sugar-part white, part brown. I think I would prefer all brown in these. The result was definitely not too sweet, probably because I didn't use all the topping (in which I used softened butter instead of melted). The orange flavor was there, but I didn't find it very strong...maybe just personal taste-or perhaps my sweet potatoes were extra big. I mashed the potatoes, leaving them with a few lumps because that was the texture we wanted. I didn't want to open a can of evaporated milk so I used heavy cream. They worked nicely for Thanksgiving, but I'm not sure I'll make them again.

Perhaps the best version ive tried. Its like a sweet potato pie-minus crust- combined with the topping of pecan pie.  Could almost be a dessert it is so delicious. I didnt have evap milk so i used half & half.  Also i did half sweet potatoes and half yams.  Love it and will use it every time

Perfect as written.

I added some frozen spinach just to sneak some super-foods in for my toddler.  He couldn't taste it.

Would have given this 5 stars were it not for the needed changes. The taste is definitely worth 5. I left out the orange juice to ensure better potato flavor. Use COLD butter in the topping and use a pastry blender to blend until crumbly. Great recipe, especially for a family constricted by an egg allergy. Thanks!

I made two changes:  Baked the potatoes rather than boiling them.  This helps retain the sweetness. Second, I didn't use orange juice, but topped the dish with marshmellows in the last ten minutes of baking.  It was great!

This was fantastic! I do agree that you shouldn't melt the butter in the pecan topping, just use softened butter and stir like crazy until it's all broken up. Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner loved it and wanted the recipe.

Excellent recipe :) The only thing I omitted was the pecans (hubby doesn't do nuts ;)) The crumb topping was very sweet..almost too much sometimes. I will definately make this again, but maybe with only 1/2c brown sugar in the topping :)  YUM!

The crust on the top of this makes it just scrumptious!  The only change I would make would be to cut the white sugar a little bit; it's so sweet it could be eaten for dessert!

Simply a wonderful dish.  The flavor is extraordinary.  After reading the previous reviews, I agree that the butter for the streusel must be cold, not melted.  This is a dish I will make over and over again.

I made this for our family Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit, even with the kids! The spices are just right to compliment the overall taste and are not too overpowering. I'll definitely be making this every Christmas and Thanksgiving - the family demands it!

This dish was off the scale!  I served it with Thanksgiving dinner and my whole family - from the 3 year old toddlers to 80 year old Dad - went nuts over this.  We didn't have nutmeg but I don't think skipping it made any difference; it was still amazing!

After years of loving & eating eggs, suddenly developed an allergy. So I decided to try this. I did add about 1/4 more OJ than calls for, as the mixture was too thick.  Also substituted 1/4 tsp off allspice in place of the nutmeg. As for the topping, my flour was at the bottom of my ingredients before mixing, so the butter mixed with the brown sugar and pecans first, avoiding the problem with clumping. Served it this years’ Thanksgiving dinner with no complaints. I totally enjoyed it without the tummy fallout & no one else was the wiser about the lack of eggs. Try it out, you won’t be disappointed!

This recipe is exactly how my grandmother made her sweet potato casserole every Thanksgiving and Christmas. My mom really loves it.  So, now, I make it every holiday we are together for a big meal.  There are a couple things I do differently, because it's how my grandmother made it.  I add 1/2 cup of  dark brown sugar to the sweet potato mixture.  Then for the topping, I use a cup to a cup and a half of whole pecans. a half cup to 2/3 cup butter and the half cup flour. I put the pecans, the 3/4 cup light brown sugar, put all toppings ingredients in a microwaveable bowl and microwave for about 45 seconds, until butter is completely melted and hot, stir the mixture well, then pour onto top of casserole.  This makes a wonderful candied pecan topping that is absolutely sinful.

The orange juice and spices  give it a pumpkin pie filling taste. I omitted the pecans due to a nut allergy and it still tasted fine.   It is sweet and the sugar can easily be reduced without harming the recipe.

It isn't Thanksgiving unless I make this dish.  Also, everyone at dinner walks away with the recipe, it's that good!

What is the advantage of evaporated milk over regular milk?  Should not melt butter for topping. It makes it more difficult to work with.

This recipe is very good. I made it one year for Thanksgiving and every year the family requests I bring it. I love the fact it doesn't have eggs. It lowers the calories and you can't tell the difference from a recipe that calls for eggs.

Love it!!!  You know how some people ask you to bring a dish to a pot luck.  I always tell them I'll bring the sweet potatoes.  I get strange looks, or am asked who brings sweet potatoes to pot lucks.  Then I show up with this dish!  It's always a hit!  Even those who would never eat sweet potatoes will come back for seconds.

This dish is at every one of my holiday tables!

I begrudgingly made sweet potato casserole this year for Christmas dinner because my husband asked for it. I usually don't like it, and I guess it's because I've always had the canned , but this recipe is AMAZING!!! My husband is southern no novice when it comes to sweet potato casserole and he said it was the best he's ever had. Like some of the other user's recommendations, I baked the potatoes first and it made them practically slide out of the skin and brought out so much flavor. I will definitely make this again.
