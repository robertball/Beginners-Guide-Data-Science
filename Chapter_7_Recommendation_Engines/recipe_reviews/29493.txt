We loved this recipe.  Next time would use less sugar.  Added minced ginger which enhanced the asian flavor.  Didn't need to thicken sauce with cornstarch because it was thick enough by the time the salmon was cooked.

One of our favorites. I double the amount (I don't add as much water as they say, and don't use the corstarch)so we have extra for rice. I add diced regular onions--gives good flavor and texture.

I tried this and found it very bland and unremarkable with needless post prep. I was astonished they didn't publish my version which is: Forget the water and garlic it just makes it bitter overall. Add 1/2 cup of your favorite mushrooms raw, soaked dry or prepared chopped and thicken in small sauce pan. Rest all sauce ingredients 15-20 minutes pour over the fresh salmon on a greased pan or sheet and broil about 7 minutes. Serve with yellow rice and steamed veggies. Tell me if it ain't alot better

Well, this recipes was pretty good. Not quite as good as I had hoped.  It turned out to be like a poached salmon.

This  recipes was excellent taste. I left out cornstarch, its sauce is thicken by itself.  Instead of brown sugar, I used a bar of sugar cane (find it in Asian stores which called duong the?). If you like spicy dish,  try 1tsp Sriracha Hot chili sauce.

good, but disappointing.  I love both oyster sauce and salmon so I get I had high expectations, but it doesn't honestly have that much flavour.

I loved this recipe. I know for a lot of people it is not that amazing or extraordinary. I am learning to cook so this was easy and the result was just what I was expecting. I really loved it!

a little too sweet but it was good overall! :) I added ginger which complimented it but be careful against adding too much which would overpower it. Next time I'll use less sugar as well.
the recipe works good too on dory

used previously frozen wild salmon from Trader Joe's and  yellow onion instead of green. Also added fresh Asian Style mixed vegetable mix from trader Joes and served with white rice. Delicious.

This was so good and fast! My local whole foods doesn't sell my teriyaki sauce anymore so I had to make something similar. I used a Stevia in the Raw since I'm on low carb diet  finished what was left in my oyster sauce bottle. I used less about 2/3 cup of water. I sauté the garlic and then sprinkled 2 packets of the stevia sugar in the garlic oil. I didn't have green onions and didn't thicken with corn starch for lack of time. I will do both next time. The sauté with garlic and sugar is definitely an important step in this recipe.
