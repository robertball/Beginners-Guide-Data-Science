As written, this is just fine.  As the previous reviewer mentioned, it makes a HUGE batch- I halved the recipe and it filled up 1 1/2 gallon freezer bags.  I added 1 tsp of sea salt to the candy mixture before cooking at a little vanilla at the end.  Despite bringing the candy to the correct temperature, this was very tacky and unpleasant to chew after it cooled.  I decided to throw it back in the oven at 250 like you would with caramel corn, since the candy mixture was very similar.  I left it in for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes and it turned out perfectly!  I allowed it to cool in single layer on wax paper.

This recipe is addictively delicious!! However, I don't have a bowl big enough to mix this in and my biggest bowl is pretty huge. I had to mix it in 2 separate bowls and maybe didn't get it mixed as good as it could have been. I would recommend making a half batch. I also think the corn syrup and sugar mixture should be cooked to a couple degrees less than recommended. Mine was slightly to hard, not quite soft. Overall, this is an awesome snack!

I made this and loved it.  Others have mentioned it's too chewy - not so for me.  I love the chewiness.  I did toast the coconut but the almond slivers burned to a crisp while toasting, so be careful with that.  I  bought more almonds and just added without toasting. Still yummy!  Makes a HUGE batch so took some to a party, to work, etc.  Good for large gatherings.

As written, this is way too chewy.  However, other reviewers suggested putting it in a 250 degree oven for an hour (stirring every 15 minutes) and 45 minutes actually does the trick.  If you're going to make the entire batch, mix it up in a BIG roasting pan that you can then transfer to the oven.  I lightly toasted the coconut and almonds at first because I knew they would get extra time in the oven at the end.  I also used a big spatula for the stirring and coated it with PAM to make things go easier.  Then spread it out on parchment paper to quickly cool like caramel popcorn. Next time I will spray the roaster with PAM as well and maybe add a little vanilla toward the end of the cooking for the sugar mixture.  So good but the directions are a bit off.  (Oh, and you'll end up with lots of little coconut bits and almonds not attached to the cereal.  I put it in a bag and will use for topping yogurt, ice cream, pudding, etc.)

This recipe is a cavity in the making! But a yummy cavity! Followed the recipe to a "T". Word of advice-don't put on wax paper to cool. Use a buttered cookie sheet.

I made this for Super Bowl 50 & it is a big hit. I subbed Corn & Rice Chex instead of Golden Grahams because I have celiac & it came out great. When I make it again, I'll probably add more coconut because I love coconut.

Yum!  I made the recipe as is and then baked it in the over at 250 for 30 minutes, stirring every 10 like you do with caramel corn. It turned out awesome!  It is addictive, watch out.

This is SO good! Definitely toast the coconut and almonds, and know that it's going to be sticky after it cools...not like a typical Chex mix. But it's not soggy, there's still a crunch to it. I made this for a family gathering and it was gone in minutes, with everyone asking for the recipe.
