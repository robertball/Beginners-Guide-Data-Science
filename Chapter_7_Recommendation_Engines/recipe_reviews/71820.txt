I made a few minor changes to this recipe, and served it at a dinner party to rave reviews.  (1) In advance, I sliced the tomatoes (I used plum/roma as they're more flavorful), mozzarella, and basil and put in a container w/a lid. (2) when mixing the balsalmic vinegar and olive oil, I also added 1/2 tsp of djon mustard (gave a subtle delicious flavor that was missing before and goes great w/the spinach). Pour this over the tomatoes, basil & mozzarella and cover.  Chill for at least 30 minutes or more to allow the flavors to blend.  When ready to serve salad, put spinach in large salad bowl, and pour tomatoe mixture on top.  Toss to coat.  (3) I also made extra "dressing" and added as needed when tossing, so that the spinach was sufficiently covered.  Fantastic!!

I absolutely love this salad. Think of it as Caprese Salad with a twist. The only change I make is to halve a pint of either cherry tomatoes or grape tomatoes instead of the beefsteaks. They have far more flavor and really add to the presentation. I also use more olive oil and vinegar than is called for. Be sure to only use fresh herbs and a more expensive aged balsamic. The last time I took this to a potluck this salad received wonderful reviews!

Very tasty recipe as well as being so simple and quick to prepare. We love Insalata Caprese salads and this was just another variation of that. Looked great. My husband liked the fact that the baby spinach helped break up the flavor of the basil. Will make many more times.

Delicious!  Fresh Oregano is a must - didn't have fresh basil, so used dried.  Also added grilled chicken and used Newman's Own Light Balsamic Vinaigrette instead of the olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  A must try!

Was ok.  The dressing was a bit much though.  The herbs definitly added some flair to it.  I might try it again if I add more spinach and less dressing.

Pretty good, although I used spicy greens instead of spinach. I also did not have fresh oregano so I added some dried to the dressing mix. A bit heavy on the dressing, but otherwise good and fairly filling.

very fresh, easy salad. if you're not used to fresh basil, you might reduce the amount the first time you try this. (we are not and my husband said it's all he could taste) thanks for the recipe

Nothing not to like about this salad. Believe it or not, my kids would rather eat salad than ice cream (well, most of the time) and they adored this. Thanks!

We weren't really big fans of this salad.  The dressing was too much and the seasonings were a little much as well.

We just started South Beach and this is really yummy! I love balsamic vinegar. I used dried spices as I didn't have the fresh. It still came out great! I served it with "Turkey Polish Sausage and Peppers". Great combo!

The key to this salad is fresh ingredients and a little "kick" in the dressing.  I used garden herbs and tomatoes and really laid on the salt and pepper.  Please use kosher salt-it makes a difference.  I used olive oil, balsalmic vinegar,dijon, and some honey in the dressing.  My husband wanted more substance, so I sauteed a chicken breast and added it,too.  Overall, a great light summer salad.

This was the easiest recipe I have ever tried. Our drawers where overflowing w/ tomatoes and this was the perfect fix to our problem. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it needs something. Maybe a vinegarette.

Tasty, fresh salad.  Make sure you don't overdo the herbs.  An attractive alternative to the beefsteak tomato slices is to halve cherry or grape tomatoes instead.  Perfect with Italian entree, will make again.

AMAZING!  I used fresh herbs from the garden.  It's the best salad I've eaten in my life.  Everyone I've served it to agrees.  It's light and refreshing.

This salad had a great look to it. The display was colorful and enticing. But overall, the flavor left much to be desired.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! I had to use dried herbs as I didn't have fresh, but the recipe still turned out great. Even my husband, who dislikes spinach, loved this salad. Will definitely be making it again.

This was a wonderful addition to Cilantro Lime Shrimp Ceviche.  It was pretty, light, very easy to put together and tasted fabulous!

This salad is so flavorful! Being Italian I have always made a tomato, basil, mozzarella salad but this salad takes that to a whole different level. The combination of spinach with the fresh herbs in addition to the tomato and cheese is amazing. I didnt change a thing. The herbs I bought were organic and bursting with flavor. I will make this again and again. It just may end up being my go to for parties and gatherings! The bonus: it's super easy and healthy too!

This is a very good salad. I made it for an italian dinner and everyone like it.I've made it several times since and so have others. I didn't use the dressing the recipe called for. I just used a nice italian dressing.

Fresh, european salad. Not extremely tasty (my tastebuds weren't quiverring with joy), but the flavours of the tomato, spinach and mozarella mesh well together.

I made this with dried herbs because that's all I had and it was still quite tasty. The balsamic vinegar on the cheese is an amazing combination and the colors of this salad are beautiful. I didn't give it five stars becaues as other reviewers have said it just seemed to lack something. I wonder if roasted red pepper strips would do it?
