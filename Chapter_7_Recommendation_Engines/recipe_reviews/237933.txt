The ingredients sounded a little strange to me, but I made them just as the recipe called for, and they were really good!  I  made them into full size hamburgers instead of sliders.  The burgers came out super moist and my husband loved them too.  I'll be making these again.

Sounds odd, tastes AMAZING! I made these for father's day with ground sirloin and used King's Hawaiian Rolls for the buns and added some baby spinach leaves for greenery. I **did NOT** add the yogurt to the mix, rather placed a dollop on the burger as it was being assembled. The brie complimented the yogurt well and the dijon added a good spice to the mix. Everyone (even the less adventurous eaters) loved them. 
Next time, I think I'll add some carmelized sweet onions to the assembly as well.
