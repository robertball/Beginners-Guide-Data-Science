Vic - you are a life saver!  I knew this as "Macaroni Magic" - My mom was out of town and I couldn't find MY copy - spent hours looking on line - OH Thank-you for posting this! Great for working moms with kids who love cheese (and macaroni)!
added note: 12/18/2003 - You can use ANY smaller pasta in this.  And any deli-style meat (just chop it) -  3rd time and my daughter still likes it.

I have made this casserole for over 25 years and my family adores it. The only thing different I do is use elbow macaroni, add about 1/4 cup minced onion, 1 minced garlic or to taste and omit the eggs. For those who find it too soupy, bake it covered for the first half hour and remove the cover for the last half hour of baking. Let it rest for at least 10 minutes before serving. This is probably my most shared recipe since I've taken it to lots of carry-ins. Depending on how many I have for dinner, I often double the recipe and LOVE the leftovers. My husband hates it warmed up so, good - more for me!

I didn't care for the way this turned out.  It was a bit soupy in texture (I added extra cheese) and there was too much meat for my taste.  I added extra seasoning, but it was still bland.

Excellent casserole.  Very quick to put together one night, then throw in the oven the following day after work.
