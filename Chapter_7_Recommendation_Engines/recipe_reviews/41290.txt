This is the same way I make my casserole, only I use half a 12 oz. pkg. wide noodles and 1 can tuna. I fill soup can half full of milk. Sometimes I add some grated parmesan cheese to soup and topping. Season with salt/pepper. I have not used canned mushrooms, but think it's a great idea! I would even try with fresh mushrooms,maybe saute in some margarine. I bake in a 2 1/2 qt. casserole bowl. Sprinkle top with seasoned breadcrumbs and dot with marg. Makes enough for the 4 of us. My grown kids love it! Thanks!

No complaints from my gang! I used two cans of soup and a bit of milk and more seasonings including my usual garlic and onion powders and some chopped fresh onion. I topped with cheddar cheese and bread crumbs and dotted with some butter. Delicious and so quick and easy!

This was quick and easy to make for dinner last night. We took some suggestions and added frozen peas and one more can of soup. We decided it would be good with one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cheddar cheese soup. Overall, it was pretty good. Could use some seasoning.

I thought this was pretty good.  It came a little dry so next time I might add another can of soup or maybe cut back on the noodles.  It would probably be good with frozen peas added too.  Comfort food. Yum
