I made this for my husband's birthday and he thought it was as good as The Cheesecake Factory's cheesecake.  I followed the recipe as stated.  I used a store bought crust, although I think a homemade crust would have been better.

Since Oreo Pie Crust is not available here, i have to improvise a lot with this recipe. I mashed up 250gr of Oreo (not included the white center part) and mix it with 2tbs melted butter and 1tbs whipping cream to make it stick.
And since I'm using 10" pie pan i add up the amount of cream cheese (500gr) and sugar(110gr) and i just spread some raspberry jam on top after baking.
I used water bath and it turn out quite dense with very little cracking.

But i'll tell you what, I'm not a fan of cheesecakes, but this one smells amazing and the combination of Oreo, raspberry jam ,and chocolate just compliment the cheesy taste. So I'd recommend this for anyone who doesn't care much for cheesecake.

This cheesecake TASTES awesome.  The presentation left a lot to be desired -- as it cooled, it cracked and the jam marbling sunk so it looked rather caved-in and unappetizing.  Fortunately, my guests weren't concerned wtih appearances and raved about the flavor.  Next time I want to try mixing the jam into 1 c. of the batter, and then marbling the batters together.  I think this will even out the consistencies and make it bake (and cool) better.

WOW! This was an amazing cheesecake! It was sweet and creamy, but not sicky sweet. I skipped the preserves and just topped with fresh raspberries! It was the hit of the party.

This is absolutely DELICIOUS!! Cheesecake is my all time favorite food so I love to try new variations of it. This has the perfect dense texture that I love, the creaminess from the white chocolate and the fruitiness of the raspberry jam. Would give six stars if I could. Just heavenly!

This was VERY good. I added fresh raspberries in before baking instead of the jam, and it turned out fabulous. I also covered it with a thin chocolate frosting...just melted chocolated with a little bit of half and half. Heaven. Family and friends loved it!

this is heaven! So rich and creamy I think the white chocolate is key. Make sure to use real preserves.

All of my favourite things combined into one...how can you go wrong? Well simply put, you can't. This cheesecake was amazing! But I did do a couple things differently, but made no actual changes to the ingredients and quantities used in the recipe. I used a 7" springform pan and made my own Oreo base. After reading the reviews about the jam making the cheesecake crack, I decided to leave a bit of the batter in the bowl and mix the preserves into it. I think I left just a bit too much batter for the preserves though but the swirl design still looked beautiful, no cracks or ugly sinks. But the swirls were not as richly coloured as the one in the picture. That said, you could taste the raspberry all through the cheesecake and  it was very creamy. The chocolate Oreo base perfectly compliments the whole thing. This was so good, I had to go back for a few more slices as the day progressed...Dangerous cheesecake for something so simple. Thanks for the recipe!

It certainly wasn't Olive Garden's but was not too bad and was easy to make. I may stick with some of the more tasty and just as easy to make cheesecake recipes I have.

I made this for a party for a bunch of runners after a mini-marathon. Needless to say, it got rave reviews and didn't last very long. It's easy to make and has become my "bring to a party" dish ever since. Great way to score points with people!

Everyone Loves this cheesecake. This was my First time making a Homemade Cheesecake. Not only is this one Easy to make, but the Taste is Great!! I made this for a friends party, and while other Bakery Cheesecakes were available, many of the guests said that this one (mine:) was the best tasting one! I only changed to a Graham Cracker Crust and used a little more Raspberry Preserves( if you don't care for Raspberry, try your favorite flavor) Try this one ~ You'll LOVE IT!!

My boyfriend and his friends love this cheesecake. One friends asks me all the time to please make him another cheesecake. It tastes so amazing, costs only $10, and is super simple to make.
