Excellent!!  Why or why do people write that the recipe was wonderful than give it three or four stars because they don't have the type of cheese called for in recipe.  If the recipe is pleasing, please don't give it less stars just because you don't have all the ingredients.

Just made it for my family of five last night. I just started cooking, but my father ( a very good, trained chef in my opinion) said it was restaurant quality. I TRIPLED the recipe and there was not one bit of leftovers. However, I used sharp cheddar rather than Gruyere (a Vermonters spin on it) and instead of doing individual sandwiches I hollowed out a big loaf of artisan bread and stuffed it with the cheese sauce. We cut it into sections and had it with a side of steamed broccoli in a sharp cheddar cheese sauce. Absolutely amazing. I will definitely make this dish a regular one. It's affordable, it's quick, and it's delicious.

So, this is going to sound a little weird, but I just made this into a casserole. My kitchen is almost bare, but I had chicken breasts and my husband loves chicken cordon bleu, so I decided to try and cobble something together. Hubby gave it a "very good" so I thought I'd share!

I followed the directions, for the most part, but I only had Buddig ham sandwich meat and some Irish cheddar or something (the wrapper is gone, so I'm not sure. It was just a very sharp cheese!). I doubled the recipe and used panko bread crumbs with the butter as a base in a 7x11 glass pan, chopped chicken next, and then my crazy ham & cheese mixture. As I said, I followed the directions, but didn't have Dijon so I mixed some yellow mustard with a bit of dry mustard. I poured/spooned the mix over the chicken and topped it off with another layer of panko, and in the oven it went!

I like it fairly well myself, but I have a low spice tolerance so I'd probably do a little less mustard next time, and I admittedly went a little crazy with the panko XD but overall it's a success, more than just edible, and I definitely want to have it with french bread and "real" ham sometime!!!

I made this just as directed by Chef John, and everyone loved them.  They made the perfect lunch for us as we greeted out-of-town visitors.  I did think that they were just a tad on the bland side, a fact that could be that I used some Honeybaked ham rather than the smoked ham called for.  I am surprised that Chef didn't add a little cayenne to this, since that is present in so many of his recipes!  :)   I would definitely recommend this sandwich!

Really good as is, but next time maybe I'll add some hot sauce to bring it to a sharper taste.

Great recipe! 
We loved the simplicity of the recipe whilst incorporating all of our favourite chicken cordon bleu flavours.  We will definitely make this again.

Friday nights before Scout camp-outs are always rushed and I'm constantly looking for quick Grab and Go hand foods that still pack some substance. I used 6" French Rolls from the bakery and doubled the recipe to make 8 open faced sandwiches. My Husband says "These are great! 5 stars!" I did use the Gruyere cheese which I have never bought before. Both of my sons were holding their shirts over their noses saying they stink, so I was afraid they wouldn't eat them at all. Well...One son ate 3, the other ate 2. My husband had 2 and then came back in the kitchen and snagged the last one before I got the chance to taste it! I never even got to take a picture of them they were gone so fast! Since Gruyere is so expensive, and according to my 16 y/o smells like stinky feet, I may just use Swiss next time.  I'll have to set one to the side for myself next time before calling in the hoards. According to the guys' reactions, there will definitely be a next time. Keep 'em comin' Chef John, you've saved dinner more than once at our place.

After two trips to local markets I struck out on the proper cheese. I used a blend of shredded cheeses and,the recipe was a solid 4 stars. The only thing, this recipe, in my opinion, is not half the work of chicken cordon bleu. Very good anyway

This is good even without the red and black pepper.  I use dried basil as a black pepper replacement.  2 of us in our card party club can't handle pepper, so we have found substitutes.  Basil works great.  This is quick and easy on homemade bread too.  A little green salad and you have a great supper.  Thanks, again for the great ideas.

Wonderful recipe. Found we liked it best without the pickles and the onion. I think I used just a dash of the Dijon mustard. Also made this on sliced bread. Although I'm sure it would be wonderful on a French loaf as well. We didn't have gruyere so I used a sharp cheddar instead.

Excellent easy recipe.  I modified it a little because I'm on a Low-Carb regiment.  Instead of the flour and milk for the bechamel sauce I used 2 oz. cream cheese and 1/4 cup cream and skipped the bread crumb topping.  Eveything else remained the same.  It came out great.  For the bread base you can substitute Great LowCarb Bakery or ThinSlim bread (1 carb per slice).  My granddaughter loved it too and said it tasted like a gourmet chicken pizza.  I was also very good cold.  I may skip the pickle or mince it finer next time but that's just me.  The flavors were very well balanced.  It's a keeper.

This recipe was simple and easy to make.  I really liked the idea of it.  I don't understand the inclusion of the pickles - they didn't add anything as far as I could tell but were just odd when you bit into them.  And the texture was oddly creamy which I found to be off putting.  Overall, not my favorite but wasn't terrible.

I was looking so forward to trying this recipe, but was just a bit disappointed with the result.  It looks delicious - just like the picture - but its taste is a bit bland.  For the amount of time it took to make and the cost of the Gruyere cheese, I think I'll stick to my chicken roll-ups which use chicken, Swiss cheese, ham, and seasoned bread crumbs and then baked and topped with mushrooms lightly fried in garlic olive oil.

Fantastic!!! I love chicken cordon bleu and this is a simple, delicious version of that dish. I followed it to the letter with one exception, I left out the pickle as I don't care for them. But I served some diced pickle on the side for those in my family who enjoy it. Thanks Chef John for another winner!!!

I can't say I ever follow recipes exactly.  The whole family loved these.  We used wheat buns cut in half and used olive oil instead of butter.  The flavor was very yummy.  I used sharp cheddar since it was what I had on hand.  The second time I made it with only ham and still awesome.  I will try the french bread when I make again.  Thanks so much Chef John.

We made this at soup group.  We loved it.  The only thing we changed was we left out the pickles.  There was extra topping so that will be turned into appetizers for the clubhouse pool party Wednesday night. We will be making this again!

I love Chicken Cordon Bleu, so I was very excited about these sandwiches.  However, I really did not care for them.  I do not think it tasted like chicken cordon bleu.

The picture of this looks so yummy but I was a bit disappointed in my final product.  I guess I was expecting a more cheesy flavor & texture and didn't care as much for thick sauce.  My husband liked it though.

This was wonderful.  It was easy to prepare, and was a hit for dinner.  We will have this often.

Wow!  Chef John does it again!  This was amazing.  The flavors were perfectly melded, I could taste all the components and not one "took over".  I loved the addition of the pickles, I used a high quality homemade type and finely chopped it like another reviewer suggested.  I also used Swiss because that's what I had on hand.  Served this with a nice arugula and spinach salad.  I am seriously thinking about making this again tonight!!

I followed the recipe for the most part. My husband had made a boule the night before so I used that for my bread. The only other change I made was to use mozzeralla because that's all I had. It turned out fantastic.
