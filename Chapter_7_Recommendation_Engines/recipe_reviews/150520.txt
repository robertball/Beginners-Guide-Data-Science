These are amazing bars.  Took them to a party and they were a hit. Also, the main photo is not correct.

The layers in this dessert is CRUCIAL. It is very hard to make but at the end it is worth it. The flavors all together is delicious . I would defiantly recommend it! The only downside of making it is that it does not look like the picture.

The photo here is not of the recipe, but it is good! My only complaint is that it took 4 saucepans to make a bar dessert. I generally make bars when I'm in a rush.
