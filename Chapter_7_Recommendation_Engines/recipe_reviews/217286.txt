I don't believe you cook it. I didn't. It tasted fresh and pure and delicious.

This was a tasty and simple clam dip. I did add more hot sauce and about 2 teaspoons of worcestershire to jazz it up. Thanks for sharing Sharon.

This was very good. My husband loved it.  I made it with fresh clams that I had left over from another dish.  I also added a few drops of hot sauce.

I love this recipe and have made it several times. It's very simple. I do add extra clams and also extra hot sauce as I like things spicy. I think the best part is with its simplicity you can adjust it to your own tastes.
