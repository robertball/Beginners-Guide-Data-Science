There is (was?) a wonderful Vegetarian Restaurant in Los Angeles called "Inn of the 7th Ray". DH took me there when we were dating & hated the meal. I loved it. This soup tastes like something wonderful from that Restaurant. Very Gourmet. Very Vegetarian. I give it 5 stars. The Curry adds a bite/zing that I loved. DH (Meat & Taters Guy) gave it a 4 Star rating & proceeded to put handfuls of Fishy Crackers in it so he could eat it. This would be wonderful for a Fall Meal, Cold Night. Good comfort food. I was thinking it also could be used over some kind of pasta with other Veggies. I could be a Vegetarian. DH - Not so much. It tastes very creamy - without the cream. I did not toast the pumpkin seeds (not our thing) & did not have Pumpkin Seed Oil. Delish without it.

I amped up everything here: more butter, more brown sugar and curry, plus some cinnamon and nutmeg. I made it with vegetable broth and got a very tasty, spicy and warming soup.

I used Cinderella (Fairy Tale) pumpkin I had already pureed and agree that it was at first a bit bland. I also found the seed garnish unnecessary. I added 1 tsp. of Kosher salt, 1/4 tsp. of white pepper and a Tbs. of sweet Marsala. IMHO, much better - and even better the second day.

I read the reviews and decided to skip the garnish but stick with the recipe. PERFECT. No bland at all and so delicious. I agree with one of the ratings that the hardest part is cutting up the red kuri squash. That is one tough squash. I could eat this soup all day long.

Great soup! It didn't even need the garnish. I used a red hubbard squash and the hardest part was getting cutting up the very dense flesh. Otherwise, a straightforward, easy-to-make recipe.

Yummy way to use homemade pumpkin puree already on hand. I made a big batch and froze some for later. It was very good and I will be making again.
