Taking note of other reviews I made a few changes. For just myself and my husband I made 1/2 the recipe but used a full jar of Barilla's mushroom sauce with an added 1/2 lb. cooked ground beef. I'm glad I used the full jar for 1/2 recipe, otherwise I would have run short, which I was close to as it was. I chose the mushroom sauce since my DH likes mushrooms in his sauce (and I rarely add them to my homemade sauce) combined with other reviews stating the meat sauce was lacking in meat. I also used fresh spinach since I always have that on hand. Followed the rest of the recipe as stated and baked in a 11x7 pan. While I enjoy Barilla's pasta there was something about this recipe that neither my DH nor I cared for. I found the sauce a little sweet for my liking and the ricotta I chose wasn't smooth/creamy (could only find a store brand). Unfortunately, after our first helpings, the remaining lasagna got tossed, which is highly unusual in our house. I'll stick with my homemade sauce but will always rely on Barilla's lasagna noodles. They're always a winner.

This was really good but next time I do think I will use fresh spinach, and a couple of real thin mozzarella slices to one of the other layers as well. Yep we like things cheesy around here.

I never met a lasagna I didn't like. And today, I'm in LOVE! There's spinach in this recipe. No guilt! Used my Sur La Table cookware, so I could create the dish yesterday and bake it today! Turned out great! My neighbor had a big piece and he liked it, too!

I made this easy lasagna for a week night meal...I made individual portions so I could double the recipe and freeze for later! I will use fresh spinach next time, but otherwise this was a great meal!

I used a jar and a half of sauce. Added 3/4 lb. Italian sausage to the Barilla meat sauce because other reviewers suggested adding more meat to the recipe. This is a wonderful lasagna recipe that I would highly suggest you to try. Wonderful balance of flavors and textures.

This was a quick, easy, good lasagna. I would have loved this even more if I added ground sausage. My friends enjoyed it as well! Made exactly as written. Thanks Barilla!

I really enjoyed this but I had to make a few additions as my husband doesn't like jarred sauces. I added some garlic, red pepper flakes and some Italian sausage. We really enjoyed this and using a jarred sauce sure made it easier. Very good.

We enjoyed this simple, basic lasagna. I did add 12oz. of Italian sausage, browned, as we're real meat-eaters. I also needed additional sauce, about another half jar. The Barilla sauce is a little sweet for my taste, so next time, I would probably add additional seasoning - garlic, onion powder and some crushed red pepper flakes.

I loved this but used an extra jar of sauce & added cooked bulk Italian sausage. This will be a regular for me.

Good recipe, though I like a little less pasta in the porportions.  I actually used only half a box, and needed to open a second jar of sauce.  this sauce is a bit sweet for me, but DH and DGD chowed down, having 2 or 3 servings!  Loved this sneaky way to get a bit of spinach into DGD, lol!  If you are hankering for some lasagna, but don't want to go through all the steps of a homemade sauce, the Barilla sauce is a nice one to keep in the pantry.  It's also kind of a sneaky way to have the flavor of meat without much meat in it, if you have health concerns.  I did use fresh mozzarella and fresh ricotta, and they lift the dish quite a bit.

Good but I think I would like it better with fresh spinach and we added meat to make it a main dish for my family of meateaters. I will make again for sure

Barilla delivers a sauce that's light and uncomplicated, perfect for warmer weather.  We all enjoyed it, and guest comments were favorable for it being "not so heavy" as other pasta sauces.  I felt it was lacking a bit in flavor, but that's what's nice is that it leaves room for the additional tweaking so many of us do to suite our tastebuds.  I steamed two bunches of fresh spinach just until wilted, in lieu of frozen.  I highly suggest you ration your sauce by using only 1/2 cup in the bottom of the pan, and pour conservatively between layers to have enough for the top.  By the time I got there, it was a little sparse and on the dry side.  Also, it is in my opinion baking it at 375 is too high.  350 works great, and prevents the chance of burning/hardening your noodles.  I will definitely be making this again, with minor adjustments.

Absolutely loved this lasagna and will be making it again for sure!  The Barilla meat sauce was good, there wasn't a lot of meat in the sauce but it would be easy enough to add your own if you wanted to.  I did feel like you needed 2 jars of sauce though, one wasn't enough, so be prepared.  Loved the use of the fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced, and I used fresh spinach instead of frozen because that's what I had on hand.  Everyone had seconds and my son even said this was the best lasagna I have made!  Thanks Barilla!

Delicious! My husband and sons devoured this.  The spinach added a nice flavor and was a great way to sneak in some extra veggies to my family!

Good recipe-I like a little more meat in mine though, so next time I think I'll brown a little ground beef and add it to the meat sauce. I also used fresh spinach since that's what I had, and it worked well. Instead of layering spinach and then the ricotta I combined them and layered. Good recipe, good pasta and good sauce.

What a wonderful, simple and light recipe! My family really enjoyed it- and they are lasagna snobs! Mom has spoiled them with lasagna that takes hours to make and this was a nice, quick version of my own! Thanks, Barilla!!
