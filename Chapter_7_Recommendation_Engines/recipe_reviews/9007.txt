I have tried this and I think the key is to flame or cook off the alcohol before adding the cream. That would be the traditional method.

I tried this recipe, and did not care for it. The brandy flavor was overpowering, and it in no way enhanced the flavor of the other ingedients. The seasoning salt made it way too salty. We were looking for a good cognac sauce, but this was terrible!

This recipe was very tasty and easy.  It takes patience to ensure the right consistency of the cream (not enough time makes it runny as mentioned by another cook) but it is very yummy when made right!  I am looking forward to making this recipe again for my friends!  UPDATE: I made this again and everyone complained that the cognac over powered the chicken. The consistency of the sauce was just right but I guess I won't make this one again.

first of all, in the ingredients it says brandy, not cognac. secondly, this needed a little pickmeup.. sorry to say. After my changes adding chicken broth, twice the creme and cognac, paprika and brown sugar to taste, this really came out well.

Once I fried the chicken strip I set them aside, poured cognac and flame them, once the flame was out I incorporate them into the mushroom sauce
