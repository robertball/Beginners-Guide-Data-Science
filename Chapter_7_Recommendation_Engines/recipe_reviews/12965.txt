I had a bunch of carrots so looked for a good recipe. This was great! Simple and delicious. I read the reviews and, like others, added another T curry. I also added 2 cloves garlic with the onion, and saved some of the cooked carrots to add chunks to the puree mixture. I also added about 1/4 t salt. I garnished it with sour cream the first time, then with plain yogurt and some fresh cut cilantro.

I didn't think this recipe was too bad, but my husband didnt care for it at all. It was very thick so I might add more broth next time and use chicken broth instead of vegetable.

As a lover of carrots and curry, I couldn't wait to try this recipe.  I thought it was delicious.  I used 3(14oz) cans of chicken broth, additional curry, but did not add any water.  I simplified the puree step by using a stick blender into the pot. JAH, Texas

We love this recipe. It is even better reheated. I add more onion and more curry than is suggested to make it spicier. It is nice served with caramelized onions, sour cream, and/or croutons.

Wonderful soup - easy and very flavorful - I added other Indian spices as well as the curry and a ton of garlic - fantastic. I will definately make this again.

Great flavor. I used chicken broth to make it a little richer. I ended up using about 5 cups total to get the right consistency. At the end I added half a block of crumbled firm tofu to add protein. Next time, I'll probably only puree half of it so it will be chunkier.

I wasn't very impressed with this recipe at all...the flavor was strange, with a bitter aftertaste that wasn't very pleasant. Perhaps it was because it called for a whole tablespoon of curry powder? Also, as is, the recipe calls for no salt or pepper, so I added about 1/2 tsp. of salt and 1/8 tsp. of ground black pepper for more flavor. The one good thing about this recipe is how quick and easy it is to make. Even so, I wouldn't make it again. Thanks for sharing, though!

This is so good, I'm really impressed!! I will make it many more times, it was very easy too. The balance of ingredients was perfect, I just added a little more curry...I used 2 knorr Vegetable bouillon cubes and 4 cups of water for the broth. YUMM

I roasted the diced carrots at 420 for 40 minutes (brushed with a little olive oil), added garlic, and used 1 tsp Indian/Madras curry ("dryer," less sweet, more cumin), and 2 tsp sweet curry (more cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and cardamom). Added 1 tsp fresh grated ginger. used half vegetable half chicken stock, and a little cream right before serving. Wow!

I liked it along with my one year old but have to give 3 cause my husband didn't care for it much. I think I will be making it more when my husband is not for dinner as it s a good way of eating carrots for my son.

I usually do not stick to the recipe for savory dishes, but there was not much to alter here without getting a completely different product. And what do you know, it is good as is! i did not add the extra water in order for it to be thick enough for my toddler to be able to navigate it himself, and he ate at least a cupful!

I returned home from work hungry and in need of a dinner made from scratch. But what to do in a snap, to curb my grumbling stomach? I headed for the soups category, first on Cooking Light.com, then on Epicurious.com, finally on AllRecipes.com. Believe me, my stomach was grumpy, and I had to act fast. This soup not only fit the bill regarding speed and ease, it completely surprised me with its subtle strength. It is so delicious, but not over-flavored. It's got distinct spice, but it's not competing. The strength of this soup is its elegant subtlety: it's light, fresh, and absolutely perfect. Give it a try - only stone soup could be easier.

This recipe is quick and yummy. I used water instead of broth (didn't have any), instead added some chopped fresh ginger when it was simmering, and stirred in some fresh cilantro at the end.  Also , instead of the water at the end, I stirred a few tbs of rice milk into each serving. Made it nice and creamy. 
A good basic soup that you can play with to suit your tastes. Thanks!

I added garlic to my onions (2 cloves) an extra tablespoon of curry powder, garam masala 1 T, and salt and pepper too.  I also finished it with a can of coconut milk (not the light kind) and it made for a nice tounge feel.  I used the coconut milk instead of the water to thin.  A delicious vehicle for that giant bag of carrots at Costco that I always buy, but never end up using all of! :) Recommend this recipe

Dee-LISH! Definitely add the garlic with the onion, but then when adding the cumin, add also 1/2 tsp of garam masala and 1/2 tsp of cumin (the trifecta of Indian spices!). It gives the recipe a wonderful lift and is simply delightful.

This soup has a good general idea, but I had to double the onion amount & curry powder and it still tasted a bit bland. I added cream, salt, garlic, vindaloo, cinnamon & zatar seasonings and served it with a dollop of whipped cream, and it was much better.

Tasty, not amazing though. Added potatoes for more variety. Next time I will purree only 1/2 of the cooked vegetables, rather than all to give the soup a chunkier consistency.

This is good! I also used a tablespoon of dried tarragon when I cooked the onions, then added 2 tbsp of curry vs. 1. I used chicken broth (4 cups) and then instead of additional water, I used probably about a cup additional liquid in total (so 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup chicken broth)

At first, my husband thought I was crazy...the recipe didn't sound very tantalizing to him and I don't even like carrots. But we both like Indian spices. The soup was easy to prepare, and we both loved it! He even told his mother about it!

This is a great soup for weight watching!  It was very tasty and filling.  I cut back on the curry to 1 teaspoon.  Perhaps my curry is extra hot, because that was plenty.

I made this recipe and realized that perhaps I am not too fond of carrots.  It was ok, but just not my cup of soup - if you will. Although it did taste better the second day, I still could not get my children to eat it.

This tasted great!!!  

I have just lost over 20 lbs. on weight watchers, so I modified the recipe slightly . . . I used only 2 tsp. of oil to prepare the onions, and then I sprayed the carrots with non-stick olive oil cooking spray before adding them to the pot.  This lower-fat version still tasted wonderful!

Yum - thanks Doug for sharing your recipe!!!

Good combination of ingredients, soup was quite thick.  I had to use extra vegetable broth.  Next time I think I'll use low sodium chicken broth instead of water.  I like the curry powder - a nice touch.

This was truly divine!  The only thing I did was add garlic, and carmelized both it and the onions first.  I did not thin it at all with water.  The texture was more appealing to me when thick.  Sooooo good!  Now on my list of faves!

I like carrots and I like curry but I did not like this soup at all, nor did my guests. The curry was so overpowering that you couldn't taste anything but curry. It also had a very strange after-taste. I can't imagine adding additional curry yet many reviewers stated just that. Besides cooking up more carrots to try and dilute the strong flavor, I really didn't know how to fix it so it ended up down the garbage disposal. What a waste of time and money!

This is really good!! When you read the ingredients, it looks so simple, and it's easy to guess that taste will be sacrificed as a result. No way! I made it exactly as stated, and it was delicious -- even better (5 stars!) because it's so simple. Hardest part is chopping 2lbs of carrots! Thanks a lot.

I thought this soup was great!  I did make some changes though.  I used onion, cauliflower, baby carrots and suggested spices.  I boiled them in just enough vegetable broth to cover until veggies were tender then blended till smooth.  Very easy, tasty, and spicy.  Great for warming up on a cold winter day!

This soup was really good.  Used others ideas and reserved some chopped baby carrots for chunkyness.  Also added basmati rice too the receipe to keep it ethnic.

Although the puree consistency made me feel like I was eating baby food, I loved the flavor and the simplicity of the recipe. I would suggest adding maybe twice the recommended amount of curry, since it seemed a little weak without it.

This soup was really good.  It had a nice hotness to it and it was so simple to make.  (I'm not even a big fan of carrots.)  Next time, I might try adding more things to it, like potato chunks.

This is my recipe originally and I have played with it to over time. I tend to thin it with some extra water and season it with a hotter curry when the dinner guest list allows. Thanks for all of the other suggestions.

I really liked this recipe (I'm a vegetarian), but the kids weren't too hip on it. They said, "It's okay," and "Taste good, but I don't want too much of it."  The flavor is very strong, and a full bowl of this soup really is too much.  A small serving as a side dish is how I'll serve it next time around.

I am addicted to this soup!  It tastes creamy and a little sinful but it is so healthy!  I use fat free low sodium chicken broth.  This is probably my bet allrecipes.com find.  It can be a little heavy on the curry though so if you're not a curry person I would cut back.

This soup is SO GOOD!  I added an extra tablespoon of curry (tasty, but too hot for anyone else in the house) and 2 cloves of garlic, and I forgot to put the extra 2 cups of water in at the end.  I've been adding a little water to each serving before I reheat it.  I'm having a cupful right now and instead of water I added vanilla Silk-brand soymilk to thin and creamy-ize it. SO GOOD!  I did have some problems though during the cooking process; I didn't cut the carrots small enough so I had to cook them for like an hour, instead of 20 minutes.  Next time I plan to grate them, so it won't take so long and the consistency will be a little better.  GREAT soup!  It's good without the modifications but it's perfect with them.

This recipe was amazing! It came out so delicious! I would suggest after you have pureed the soup and put it back into the pot to remove it from the heat and let it sit for half an hour or so and then reheat it...the flavors meld so much better together the longer you wait! I also suggest adding a little ginger!

Excellent soup - it had a creamy texture and taste that belied the healthfulness of the ingredients!  (I did add a couple cloves of garlic and upped the curry by 1/2 TB)  What a terrific way to eat more carrots.  This will become part of my repertoire.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I've been making this soup for a while now. It's extremely healthy and I like how simple it is. I just wash and chop the carrots... when you puree there's no point to peeling the carrots. I add more curry since the stuff at the mega market is a bit bland. Plain yogut is also a nice topping if you want to try something other than sour cream.

This was excellent. Ised fresh carrots from my garden. I made a few changes. I did not have vegetable broth so I used chicken broth. I added a celery stick and a fresh bell pepper. I also added about 1 table spoon od sugar, a pinch of ginger, a teaspoon of cinamon and a dash of nutmeg to give it a sweeter taste. I also used about 2 tablespoons of curry powder. I pureed in my blender 2 times to give a creamier texture. Wonderful on a cold day.

It's really really carrotty, and it sort of reminded me of baby food.  But everyone I served it to seemed to love it nd just couldn't eat enough of it.  I hate to do a lot of chopping or boiling or work in general that ends up looking like mush, so I garnished it with little parsley, which made me feel better.

I really loved this recipe!  I didn't add water because we like our soups thick.  I used a hot curry powder and it gave it a bit of a nip, just enough!  A great way to get your veggies!

I used Penzy's hot curry powder - if I make it again, I'll likely cut half of it with Garam Masala instead of the full on curry powder.  I should have known better!

Soup tends to separate, but a good stir gets it back to consistency.  Perfect meal for a cold winter's night and made my house smell so good!

Ok, lots of changes to make it delicious because it is way too plain on its own (which is why I gave it 2 stars). I used chicken broth instead of water. Added 2 tsp of minced garlic, 1 tsp of minced ginger, 1/2 tsp tumeric, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp carriander, and just to add something extra I added potatoes to the cooking carrots. And of course salt and pepper to taste. I dont suggest adding garam masala to the soup, the cinnamon and cloves tend to make it less savory.

This soup is a big hit whenever I make it. I added two cloves of garlic, crushed when frying the onions,  only 1 cup water when blending as I like the consistency and flavor. I added finely chopped cilantro before serving.

LOVED this.  This will be a staple.  I upped the spices: one tbs ground ginger, 1 tbs Gram Marsala, and about 1 1/2 tbs of curry.  But I love a kick!  It soothed my sore threat in a second. I stuck with the four cups of veggie broth because I love thick purees..  Thanks for this EASY, light, lovely rendition.  It's my new favorite!  Better than Moosewood's!

This Recipe is great, especially on a cold night!

I made a few modifications to the recipe, instead of adding two cups of water after processing in the blender I added two cups of 1% milk. This kept the texture smooth and creamy without taking away from the great flavour.

Also, I replaced the curry with cumin, thyme and paprika and traded Veggie broth for chicken it was delicious..................

I cut the recipe in half because I didn't know who would eat it besides me.  So this worked out to be 3 c. of sliced carrots, 1 14.5 oz can of chicken broth, 1 tsp of curry powder.  I also added some garlic and ground pepper when sauteing the onions and 1 T. fresh parsley during the simmering.  When I blended it up it was the PERFECT consistency for me.  Tossed in a few shakes of salt too and it was delicious. Thank you for a great recipe for my extra garden carrots.

The soup was good but not great.  At the same time I would make it again.  I used only half the amouny of curry powder as I didn't think the kids would be nuts about the spice.  I did add garlic and some dill which I usually add when cooking carrots.

This was amazing with a few changes.  I added garlic with the onions, 1/2 tsp of ginger and ALOT of salt.  After I pureed, I added some evaporated milk to taste.  Excellent, thanks!

I'd just made chicken stock, so I used that in place of vegetable broth.      Although I like curry, I wondered if it might be a little harsh as the only seasoning.   So, I substituted Garam Masala.    The stick blender worked fine for pureeing the soup.    I did add a little kosher salt when I sauteed the onions.   (My stock was salt-free.   If I'd used canned, I wouldn't have added salt.)

This wasn't to my liking at all (sorry!). My adventerous husband didn't even like this. For me, it was the taste (somewhat bitter) and for my hubs, it was the texture (he compared this to over pureed baby food). While I enjoy all of these ingredients on their own, they don't work well together. I even splurged and bought fresh curry powder from my local gourmet spice shop (so I know the spice isn't the issue). I pretty much followed Doug's directions to the letter, however, I did substitute chicken broth for veggie broth (I always have chicken broth on hand). It took a little more than a cup's worth of extra broth to achieve a slightly thin consistency. Creme fraiche added a nice finishing touch (and was what helped salvage our soup) and the naan I served on the side filled us up. Oh well, I guess every recipe can't be a winner. At least I was able to crank out my new immersion blender. Thanks anyways, Doug! :-)

OH MY WORD this is an amazing recipe! Thank you, Doug! I only have a small blender so I ended up leaving the soup chunky, which turned out wonderfully! I will do this intentionally next time. I also added more curry powder and some garam masala like other reviewers suggested. I would have added cumin as well, but I just ran out. I will try it next time. Additionally, I spontaneously topped the soup with a few toasted cashews and it was great, although took away from the wonderful curried carrot flavor already there. May not add the cashews next time. I also arranged some zucchini peels on bread with olive oil and pepper and stuck it in the oven to toast for a bit. This made a wonderful accompaniment to the soup, as I dipped it in and even spooned the carrot chunks onto the toast. I will definitely serve this with naan next time!

Great soup and REALLY easy to make if you're a busy person! To thin the soup a bit, I used 5 cups total vegetable broth and a 1/2 cup water. Added a half tbsp more curry powder and a teaspoon garam masala for a bit more kick. Very tasty, low-cal, and the husband loved it!

Very Good and Easy! I did play around with this a bit and used suggestions of using chicken broth, adding garam masala,cumin and garlic. I also added 1/2 a cup of milk. I do like more of a soupier soup so I added more water like the recipe states. I would definitely add this to an Indian feast with some Naan bread.

Very tasty - a little too spicy from the curry for me, would use less next time.  I doubted the raisins but they were really good - nice balance of sweet to the heat.

Quick, easy, yummy. I would suggest about 1 tbsp more curry like other reviews suggested. I would also replace the cream or milk, if used the latter, with light coconut milk. I used the "Taste of Thai" brand. Quite lovely. Perfect winter, spring, year-round soup.

As other reviewers suggested, added 2 cloves garlic toward the end of the onion cooking time and kicked up the curry by 1 Tbsp.  Used a little less carrots because I threw a little leftover roasted butternut squash in.  I found it did not need the additional water after pureeing it.  Delicious, and even better leftover... felt like comfort food.

This is the best soup I have ever had, with a few minor changes!  A good friend made this with 2 tbsp curry (if you like a kick), omit the water, and add 2 tbsp brown sugar.  Fantastic!

FANTASTIC.  I made the recipe as written, with the addition of a bit more curry, some turmeric and a bit of garlic powder at the very end.  These probably weren't necessary for the soup to be delicious, but I loved the end result. The recipe notes thinning, after pureeing the cooked carrots, with additional vegetable broth -- I used about three cups for a great texture.

What a gem of a recipe. Exotic, healthy, economical and tasty -- can't beat that.  For me, it's a perfect light meal (with homemade bread) or opening course, especially in these cold months.  Thanks so much for sharing.

This is a great base soup.  I made plenty of changes to suit my own tastes, though.  I grated the carrots to make them easier and quicker to cook.  I added a TON more Indian spices, including garam marsala and tumeric, and used HOT curry.  I love spicey foods!  I also added chopped celery.  When everything was sauteed to softness, I pureed it; once pureed, I added about 2/3 cup plain yogourt, which reduces the hotness of the spices without taking away the flavour.  The yogourt will also make the soup creamier and a bit thicker.  It turned out perfect for me!

If you are adverse to strong carrot flavour, try using the sweeter baby carrot...be aware that they always seem to take longer to cook!

I only rated it 4 starts because I made so many changes. This soup is delicious, but I wanted it to suit my tastes better, so I added a 4-5 cloves of garlic with the carrots and added a tsp of freshly minced ginger. I also added more curry powder and curry paste. This soup is easy and delicious and very flavorful with the changes I've made.

If I could have given it a 3 1/2 I would.  I liked it for being different, but didn't love it.  If you really like curry, you should give this one a try.  It was nice to try a different carrot soup, rather than the more traditional.  Not sure that I'd make it again.

I have made this soup a couple of times and it is simply divine!  It was a huge hit at Thanksgiving dinner.  Don't believe the hype; this is as much like baby food as any "cream of" soup is.  Actually, my pals couldn't get over the fact that there *isn't* cream in this soup!  Most excellent!

Loved the soup! I used prepackaged peeled baby carrots (2# bag)to save time and effort. Really cuts down on the prep work. Holding out a few carrots to chop and add to the puree gives more texture.  And i did add salt and cracked pepper.

Good Soup!! However, I did agree with some of the other reviewers in that it was a bit like baby food.. So I reserved about 1/3 of the veggies, and added 1 cu. cooked wild rice, and about 2 t salt... now I LOVE it!

Wonderful!!!!! I cannot tell how happy I am with this recipe! It's got everything, nutrition, taste, and it's easy to prepare - not to mention cheap! I made one change, instead of using just one tablespoon of curry I used maybe about 3 or four - but I happen to really love the taste of curry, I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. I would recommend using two tablespoons.

I made this and thought, "hmmm, doesn't look very good, but I'd better eat it anyway".  I ate the first bowl than went back for another.  It was very very yummy and oh so simple.  Definately a keeper!

This soup is unbelievably easy to make.  And the taste is absolutely fabulous.
Tastes even better the second day.

We have served this on many occasions, including as a starter for a family gathering.

I thought this soup was very good.  I was easy and quick to make, and I even played around with the ingredient amounts without problem.  Tastes great with fresh bread!  Also is good as a leftover lunch.

I might make this again. I added salt while it was simmering to add flavor. I garnished with sour cream, and didn't water it down much. I would like to try this again, perhaps with some brown sugar mixed in.

Very flavourful. I will make it again.  But next time I'll put it in a blender instead of food processor.  It was lumpy The food processor didn't seem to get out all the chunks of carrot.

Very good! Threw in garlic and a red pepper just to use them up.  Glad  I didn't over blend, the chunky texture was great with rice and shrimp.

Really simple and super yummy.  I'm don't usually mess with recipes but I added garlic like many suggested and used coconut oil instead of vegetable, only because it's all I had. It's got a really good sweetness to go with the curry flavour. I didn't add any water in the end because I like a thick soup. I will be saving this one.

Great for a point of departure.  Like others, I sautéed a few cloves of garlic with the onions to start. Butter as a substitute or enhancement to vegetable oil I think helps.  I also minced some ginger, maybe about 2 tablespoons.  I add equal parts butternut squash to the carrots.  A teaspoon maybe more cumin.  Dashes of chili powder and coriander, to taste.  Teaspoon or so of salt.  Lots of broth for cooking and consistency, as well as flavor.  I use chicken broth because it is easy and mild.  Cayenne.  Maybe half a teaspoon, cause I like it hot.  Wife and some of the kids do not or it would be more.  And I almost double the curry powder.  But then, I am making big batches and usually adlibbing a lot.  Easy, good, simple.

Very nice meal of this soup and Rosemary focaccia. My only changes to the original recipe were coconut oil, loads more curry, ginger, cumin and chicken broth to thin.  What a fantastically flavorful meal for under $5.  We will be making this again and again.

Great way to use up carrots! My picky 19 month old even liked it. I used 2 tablespoons of curry instead of one and used the immersion blender in the pot instead of blender. Very easy recipe!

Very nice flavor! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil & added turmeric & fresh minced ginger which are in the same spice pallet. These minor changes make this soup an anti-inflammatory power house! Garnished with plain greek yogurt & a dash of paprika--very pretty!

Added cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, bay leaves, cummin, and doubled curry amount and did not use water, instead, used two boxes of chicken broth.  Tastes even better if you add shredded cheese!

Super tasty, super easy, super healthy!  I made this and added just a pinch of salt along with a "block" of tofu for protein.  After mixing it up with my immersion blender, the tofu was MIA and everyone who has tried it is shocked they've been "tricked" into trying tofu.  I will be using it as a base for other creative concoctions (possible candidates for inclusion:  apple, sweet potato, spinach, chopped walnuts, homemade plain yogurt, mint...so many possibilities!).

Yum!  I read several of the reviews and added fresh ginger, garlic, garam marsala and a little cumin.  Only used chicken broth not plain water.  Probably used a little less of the liquid because I wanted a thicker soup.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for posting Doug!

For those who didn't like it I wonder if they did not bloom their curry powder. powdered spices should be cooked for a few minutes with the onions and oil to release their flavor. Otherwise they produce a weird aftertaste. 
I also added 1 tablesppon of garlic, 2 tablespoons of ginger paste,  2 tablespoons of curry paste (instead of powder) and salt and pepper. 
next time I might roast the carrots first for more flavor

D-lish, quick and inexpensive! I made this recipe with 1/2 mushroom broth and 1/2 veggie broth, substituted olive oil and added 3 cloves garlic. After I blended the ingredients I thought it was somewhat bland so I added about 2 more tsp curry, fresh ginger, dash of cayenne and a dash of cinnamon. The final product was quite tasty!

Lovely and very easy.  I upped the curry and garnished with cilantro. Also added a potato to give it some extra thick winter time goodness!  This will be a staple around here.

This was wonderful and simple. I added a clove of garlic to the onions and 1/4 tsp of salt because I wanted to. Definitely making this again.

The soup was very easy to make but I found it a little bland.  I'm trying not to eat breads right now, but this soup cries out for crackers.

I really like this or a low calorie lunch.  The only thing I changed was to add a dollop of sour cream to it when serving.  It mellows it out

very good soup as written but upping the curry powder to 3 tablespoons and adding about 2 tablespoons of chopped garlic to the onion mixture made this soup FANTASTIC. i made the soup stress and hassle free by using already peeling baby carrots instead of whole carrots and bottled chopped garlic. i also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. letting the soup sit overnight just made it that much better so this is perfect for make-ahead entertaining.

this is delicious! I had tons of juicing carrots so I decided to try this. The only change I made was to add maybe 1tsp more curry and 1 tsp garam masala. Even better warmed up. I only added about 1/2 cup of water to this as I like my soup nice and thick. I am sad I just discovered this at the beginning of spring!

Simple and delicious! I wanted something nutritious that I could taste despite my bad cold, so the curry was perfect. Also added a bit of ginger paste, cumin to warm it up, and pepper. Yumm!

The flavor of this soup left something to be desired. Salt? Pepper? Heavy cream? I also recommend adding only a half tablespoon of curry powder in the beginning. More can be added later to taste. On second thought, it might be a better idea to just instead go with a cream-based recipe.

Delicious. Based on other reviews I added minced garlic and 1 more TBS of curry powder because my hubby likes things spicy. Just before serving I added a dollop of plain yogurt to each bowl.

This was good, but I think if I make it again I'll go with other reviewers and add coconut milk. Super easy and cheap though. I halved a bag of baby carrots. For the curry I used the $1.99 packet from Cost Plus. Love those for spices I can't use before they get stale.

I used butter instead of oil and added celery shortly after the onions. Didn't add any water at all but I did add a little salt and pepper and sour cream after blending. We LOVED this soup. Even my husband who doesn't like curry said this was the best soup he ever had.

I have made this as a first course for dinner with guests several times. It is a can't fail recipe if there ever was one. For me, it is a tad sweet but given the nutrition of the soup, I always go back to it.

Very good.  Made same as recipe "except" I didn't have enough vegetable broth so used half vegetable and half chicken.  Did not need to add water at the end.  Used a stick blender to puree.  Measured the carrots to 4 cups chopped as I was using from a 25# bag of carrots.  Thanks for sharing.

There are only 2 of us, so I halved the recipe. The bf doesn't like onion, so I omitted it but added some garlic, and used beef broth instead of the vegetable. I also added just a tiny amount of cumin. This recipe is simple and tasty. Thanks

This was pretty tastey...I did have to add a touch of salt at the end. I wouldn't add any more curry than what is stated though because it would just overpower it. I used red curry powder so maybe that's the difference.

I couldn't believe that a soup with so little ingredients and so easy to make would be THIS good...  but it is!  Next time I will chop my carrots smaller to help eliminate chunks when blending.

Love this. Budget friendly, simple and delicious. I made exactly as written, using mild curry powder which gave enough flavour without overpowering the carrots. When serving we added a dollop of natural Greek yoghurt. I plan to make this again this weekend. Thankyou for a real find Doug.

I LOVE this soup!  You do have to like the taste of curry, if you're going to enjoy it.  The 2nd time I made it I didn't have enough carrots so I used carrots & potatoes and it was also delicious.

Our family loves it! If the children are having some, I only use a teaspoon of curry powder for their taste buds. Very simple and economical. This recipe helped us to save money while keeping us healthy, during a time of unemployment. I like to add fresh cracked pepper to my serving.

I used 2 cans of veg broth and 1 can of chicken broth, plus some water. After pureeing, I added about 1/2 cup of cream (it was leftover). To serve, I diced some raw carrots, put in the bowl, and then ladled soup over it. I topped it off with a little fresh grated parmesan cheese. Simply delicious.

This was a great soup! Aside from having to chop all those carrots it was quick and easy to make and full of flavour! My friend just can't get enough of this soup and has volunteered to cut the carrots as long as I make it again! Tastes best if you puree it with an immersion or regular blender.

Delicious and easy to make. Next time I would put a little less curry in for my own taste.

I made this recipe adding garlic and double the curry as others suggested. I didn't need to add any extra water as it was the right consistency for me with just the broth, but the soup was bland, so I added a 1/3 cup of cream cheese at the end and it did the trick. I will make this soup again with the cream cheese as I think it really enhances the flavor without making it too rich.

I don't know how to say this, so I'll just come on right out and say it, this reminded me of eating dirt, I can never seem to find a carrot soup that doesn't taste like I'm eating earth. I don't know why because I love carrots, but they never seem to translate well into soup. I'll keep searching for that perfect recipe, but my mom liked this so I'll be nice and give it 2 stars.

Excellent low calorie soup. I add a tablespoon of low fat Sour Cream to each bowl adding 16 calories but it really improves the taste and texture of the soup.  I also used this recipe reducing the liquid while cooking to be the curry gravy for curried baked chicken - it was great and very low calorie while increasing the fiber and vegetable content without using cream!

really bland.  Not the same type of curried soup I was expecting. I added fresh ground ginger and still not that great.  Still searching for the right curried carrot soup.

This is a delicious soup! I added some fresh garlic to the onions and a bit of ginger. I didn't have any vegetable broth so I ended up using chicken broth! I really enjoyed this and will continue to make it! Cheers!

I only used half the amount of curry (I like it, but only hints), and it turned out delicious.  Also, I pureed part of it rather than all of it, so it still had a good amount of chopped carrot.

Great soup! I made it all last winter and have some simmering now! I serve it with yogurt or cultured Mexican sour cream. I recommend using a high quality curry to make it lively- I use Muchi Curry from Whole Food's spice line.

This wasn't bad, but I couldn't taste carrot, only curry.  I think next time I would half the amount of curry powder I used, although I guess it does depend on what brand of curry powder you use and how fresh it is.  After all we're all using different types and getting different results accordingly.  Mine was clearly too hot.  I will make this again, but I'll be more careful with the curry powder next time.

I have made a soup very similar with ginger instead of curry. I added a tbsp of each and some tumeric. It was really good. You can switch it back a forth depending on who you are cooking for. If they don't like curry then use just ginger and vice versa. Either way is delicious.

An excellent basic recipe! Two nights and two great soup recipes! (Last night it was the Healing Cabbage Soup). 

Improvised quite a bit. Added 3 cloves garlic. Used olive oil, added sweet potato to carrots and grated them all. Instead of curry power, added 2ts cinnamon, 2ts cumin, one ts turmeric, one ts salt, 1/2 ts cayenne, and one Tbs grated ginger. Goes nicely with good whole wheat bread. Cheers!

It's a good basic recipe but needed a few more ingredients. I only used 1 pound of carrots. I added 1 1/2tbsp of fresh ginger and 1/3 c. of sherry. For a creamy version, I used 2/3 c. of yogurt.

I cooked this with whole baby carrots, then served some baby carrots as a side dish. This was great with just the slightest hint of curry. The remaining carrots were pureed for soup. I was very surprised by the sweetness of this soup was. I was expecting a stronger curry taste. I could definately taste the curry, but it was not overpowering. I wonder how it would taste with a hotter curry...I'll try that next time. The curry was a great compliment to the natural sweetness of the carrots.

The soup's consistency was good but I thought it needed a lot of salt to bring out the flavor.  Also, I'd put less curry powder - it overwhelmed the carrots.  Sour cream on top and some salt made it very good.  This recipe, as is, makes A LOT of soup.

We tried this recipe the other night, and I honestly did not like it at all.  My husband liked it more than I did, but did not give it a glowing review.  I give it two stars for healthy content, but the taste just wasn't my cup of tea.  I followed the directions exactly, with the exception of adding 1/2 tsp. more curry, per other reviewer's suggestions that the taste was bland.  The curry flavor was completely overwhelming, and I had to force myself to eat leftovers the next night to justify the time it took me to peel and chop all 2 lbs. of carrots the recipe calls for.  I even tried it with the dollop of sour cream in one small bowl, then with golden raisins in another, and nothing made it taste any better to me.

I found this recipe to be a great way of using up the carrots.  Taste-wise, it was pretty good.  I could hardly taste the carrots because of the 1 Tbl extra curry I put in (which is a GREAT thing btw).  However, the texure of the soup was kinda strange (hence the 4 1/2 stars) because it reminded me of baby food!  ...Or something that old people without teeth have to slurp down.  Anyway, this was a great carrot recipe, thanks a bunch!

Great tasting soup for such a simple recipe! I very strongly dislike carrots, and even I liked this recipe.  A great way to get some of your daily vegetable servings.

I took a chance and made this unknown recipe for a "soup exchange," and it was a big hit.  This soup is a great example of good, simple cooking with few, easily-obtained ingredients.  Like others, I added extra curry powder. 

I'm sure this soup would be good with the extras that other reviewers have suggested (e.g., potatoes), but the recipe stands on its own as is.

It's a great recipe and so inexpensive (which is always a plus as a student).  I added squash and potato to it to make it a little creamier.  And added more curry of course.  Even my boyfriend liked it and he doesn't like anything!

So, so good. I made it with chicken broth instead of vegetables because that's all I had and put twice the amount of curry powder.  I will be making it again.

This was a great recipe. I used about 1.5 # of carrots, because that’s all I had. I used beef stock, for the same reason. And added an extra half tablespoon of curry. Will definitely make again.

I think the original recipe was too bland, but I made a few adjustments and then it was good!

1. I added 2 cloves of garlic diced in with the onion.
2. I added cumin and salt (how was there no salt in this recipe)
3. I doubled the curry powder
4. Instead of water, I added milk to lengthen and make it a bit creamy
5. I topped with caramelized onion, and a dollop of full flavor sour cream.

We loved this soup! I don't like curry powder enough to put a tablespoon into anything I cook, but I decided to use half and then put the shaker on the table for those who wanted more curry flavor.  It turned out great! 

We are vegan and wanted to add a little extra protein so  I made baked, tofu croutons, by cubing super firm tofu and soaking it in a marinade of tamari sauce and garlic  then rolling each piece in corn starch before baking . I put it in the oven at 425 degrees, for about 20 minutes, turning once about half way. These made a wonderful addition to the soup.  Sprinkle a little cilantro over the top and enjoy!

I started out following the recipe - sauteing the onions  and stirring in the curry.  I loved the smell, but it smelled a LOT !  It took a day with open windows to get the curry smell out of the kitchen :-).   I wanted coconut milk in my soup so after following the  initial steps, moved to a different recipe.   I know this is not a typical review since I did not finish out the recipe as written, but wanted to warn those making this that you (and your family) better like curry!

I thought it tasted quite bland.  The next time I make it I'm going to add some Cumin, Cinnamon,  and Ginger.   I got these spices from another recipe for Carrot Curry Soup.  It was a easy recipe to make and converted well to making with a magic bullet.

3.4.18  I made this soup as written except I used 75% veggie broth and 25% water.  I then tasted it, found the flavor weak, and in need of some spices.  I typically don’t change a recipe too much the first time through, but I knew that the soup as written would not be well received in this house, so I had to modify the recipe.  I’m a curry lover, so I added more of that plus some cinnamon, cumin, cardamon, salt, and some coconut.  I think this soup is an excellent choice for a small-size appetizer. I know that I changed the flavor of this soup, and that some of you now are rolling your eyes.  But with these changes, it's a keeper, and I will make again.  Without them, I would not.

Added fresh garlic (2 cloves) and fresh ginger (1 Tbsp) with the onions, and garam masala (1/2 Tbsp) and cumin (pinch) with the curry. It turned out amazingly delicious, and quite spicy.

I took the reviewer's advice and added garlic and increased the curry to 1 3/4 T.
I really liked the flavor and texture.
Sprinkled dried currants  on soup when served.

Delicious! I roasted the carrots, onions, and (added) 8 cloves of garlic in the oven. (400 degrees for 45 minutes or so, til the mixture is soft.) The veggies were lightly coated with Evoo and garlic salt before roasting. In my blender I puréed the roasted veggies with the broth and added 1 teaspoon of dried thyme. It made enough for two hungry people. Next time I will make two batches and serve with a salad and toasted bread.

I made this recipe as stated.  I like to do that on the first try so I can fairly judge.  I will make again.  Gave a 4/5 simply because I would add more curry and pepper for myself but it was fine for my husband as he doesn't like his food too spicy.  I make meals on the simple side to suit different tastes in my family and then we can each touch it up to our own liking at the table.

I had a bunch of extra carrots and was looking through recipes for some ideas and came across this one.  Simple and fresh.  This came out fairly thick, but can easily be thinned without losing any flavor.

Very good.  even some of my kids tried it. I didn't blend it (yet) and added a few things, such as a parsnip and a bit of chopped garlic and ginger and turmeric.  Also didn't use stock but instead water and a few other spices like turmeric, pepper, ginger and tarragon. It works, thank you!!

Surprisingly simple and extraordinarily delicious. I ended up doubling the curry and using chicken broth to not only cook it but to get it the correct consistency in the blender.

Very easy to make.  I made some changes and wish I hadn't made some of them.  I used chicken broth since that was all that I had and that was fine.  Instead of 2 cups of water I used 1/2 cup of light cream and 1/2 cup of water.  I think 2 cups of water would have made it too thin, but that is my opinion.  I would suggest tasting and testing before adding all that water.  I added some more Indian spices  as others suggested and wish I hadn't. Good curry powder has a strong taste and I now feel that would have been sufficient.  I will make this again.  Thanks submitter.  SUGGESTION:  Put your stove fan on, open your kitchen windows and hope for a breeze  when you use this much curry powder.  The odor can really linger if you don't.

Vegetarians here, I used 2 tablespoons of grass fed butter. Added garlic to the onions. Also, added some garam masala.  My picky daughter ate it with some bread (she doesn't like carrots, so big WIN) but my son felt texture was too plain and needed soy chicken and tomatoes, etc. So I mixed it with a curry sauce and added soy chicken and he was fine with it. I think he liked it even more than usual because he had seconds. So I will keep playing with this recipe.

This is a delicious recipe! I only added fresh ginger because I had some and craved it... I increased the curry, as many reviewers have, to 2 T.  The curry could be adjusted from 1 tsp up to 2 T. It can always be added during the final simmer, so taste, adjust, taste! This recipe stands as is, then can be tweaked and altered to your preference, but I  give it  respect on it's own!  I served it with a generous dollop of yogurt. AND better the next day...

This tasted strange, quite bitter in fact. I added some coconut milk to help with the flavor and consistency. I also added a little ground cinnamon. The extra ingredients saved the soup from being thrown away.

I made this for Christmas and even my vegetable averse daughters loved it!  The lack of salt worried me a bit, but it really didn't need it  with the curry, plenty of flavor.  
I did change it a bit by using chicken stock instead of vegetable broth and I left out most of the water (which I shouldn't have!  It was very thick).  This was my first blended soup (hence leaving out the water) and it was delicious!  I think a touch of ginger would be good, but the kids say it was delicious and if they really love a vegetable puree soup I will certainly make it again!
It's really important to serve it HOT though, once it cooled the texture and flavors were strange, reheated it was great again though.

Very nice soup. I made it with the minor adjustment of adding two cloves of garlic and a cup of chicken broth to thin the soup instead of water. It came out great and my 9 month old devoured a whole bowl! I then took the rest of the soup, added a bit more curry, a pat of butter and some garam masala for me and hubby. We enjoyed the soup and will be making it again.

It was kind of dull to start but TWEAKED with tumeric instead of curry, a little fresh ginger, black pepper, dried hot peppers and a good cup of green tea added to the mix it was superb for a windy winters night!

Delicious! The first time I made it, I did exactly as the recipe says, and it was PERFECT.  The second time, it was a little thick. Maybe I didn't add enough water. It's so filling and satisfying for so few calories.

I gave it 5 stars, but I must say I completely changed the recipe. I used this as a starting point. I had 4 lbs of locally grown pesticide free carrots that I had to use up, but i only used about 2 1/2 of them. I sauteed the onions with garlic. Added 2 tbsp of curry powder 1/2 tsp of garam masala and 1/2 tsp of ginger. As the carrots were cooking in the vegetable broth, I roasted some corn cut off the cob and a red onion on the stove in some coconut oil. I also cooked 1 cup of jasmine rice. I reserved some of the carrot mixture and about 1/2 the corn mixture and 1/2 the rice before pureeing everything else with an immersion blender. Then added the remainder of veggies and rice to give it some texture and topped it with a dollop of plain yogurt and ate it with some fresh bread from my bread maker. YUM!! Even my 4 and 6 year olds gobbled it up.

A good place to start, easy to make.  I added celery & garlic, salt & pepper.  I also used a stick blender to reduce clean up.  BUT WAY TOO MUCH CURRY!!  I added 1 cup cream AND 1 cup water just to dilute the curry flavor.

Try serving just luke-warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for a delicious summer dessert!

I used chicken rather than vegetable broth and it turned out rather good, but I'll halve the amount of broth next time (I think it overpowered the carrot flavor). Would also recommend retaining some carrot chunks for a more interesting texture.

This soup was just wonderful. As others recommended, I sauteed garlic with the onion, used chicken broth instead of veg, and doubled the curry. I will make this often.

Very good! I had a lot of carrots and was looking for something to do with them when I came across this recipe. I read several reviews and decided to add extra curry (because I love it) and do as advised and leave some carrots and onions un-blended to add after. I was pleasantly surprised when my boyfriend said he like it (he is very picky). I thought it good and brought the left overs to work then next day. It was good then too! If ever I have an abundance of carrots again this is the recipe I will use!

My husband liked this, but I did not. I would not recommend adding extra curry, it was very salty and spiced when I added an extra teaspoon than the recipe called for. I tried adding some basmati rice, didn't help. Just...disappointed.

Mmm delish... With a few additions :-) I add a couple of white potatoes, a clove or two of garlic and nutmeg and ginger to taste (while blending everything). Garlic bread and chicken apple sausages go well with this soup to make it a hearty meal :-)

This was really tasty and a great addition to a basic chicken, rice, veggie dish I made for dinner.  I found it took more than 30 minutes for the carrots to soften, and I didn't need to add any water at the end.  I garnished with a bit of chopped green onion and grated parmesan cheese, but just a very small amount so that it wouldn't take away from the carrot flavor.

I made this because a vegan friend of mine was coming to dinner.  The consistency was a little baby-food like, even with additional water.  This must be why other carrot soup recipes call for cream.   On the plus side, the flavor was GREAT and it is very healthy.

I loved this soup!  I wasn't sure how many carrots to use for 2 lbs., but I used 4 cups.  I only used the vegetable broth and didn't need any water.  I served it with chopped green onions.  Very quick and delicious!

This was not flavorful enough for my taste.  When I made it a second time I added an additional  2 teaspoons of cumin, 6 cloves of garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  I also used additional vegetable broth to thin it instead of water.  These changes made a very tasty soup.

What's up with all the bad reviews?  I bought 10lbs of carrots for $1.47, so I looked for a good and simple carrot soup recipe, and this provided exactly that. It's so delicious! I did follow the suggestions of others, using chicken broth (cheaper and easier to find) and another tbsp of curry. I also added 3 cloves of garlic in with the onion. I made some of my own additions: a little less than a tablespoon's worth of cumin, 2 tsp of cinnamon, and 1 tsp each of chili powder, ginger, salt, and pepper. This probably added a lot more zing than the original recipe intended, but it was delicious--tasted like real Indian cuisine! For the leftovers, I plan to sautée some cubed beef and throw it in, serving it over some rice. Next time I make it, I think I'll add milk in at the end, instead of water, to make it just a little bit creamy. Thank you!

I found this to be quite a tasty soup! I did as another reviewer suggested and added another tablespoon of curry. Also, at the end, I added about two spoons of cream, which didn't help nor hurt the soup. Overall, this is a good soup and one that I will definitely make again.

I really enjoy this soup! Although I as others added the fresh garlic and ginger.  I didn't have fresh carrots so I used canned ( I know I'm not a fan of canned veggies either but I had them so I used them)and the veggie broth I used was from dark green leafy vegetables so of course it tinted the color of my soup slightly but the taste was suprisingly good!  I can't wait to try it with fresh carrots!

Wow. Not only was this soup sooo good but it was a quick recipe. I added 2 tablespoons of cocunut milk before I blended the soup. The curry was perfect. Not to mild and not to hot. 
This is the type of soup you make when friends come over. They will be very impressed.

I made this recipe, only instead of curry I added ginger as per another reviewer's suggestion. I added a little extra ginger than the recipe called for for curry powder. Delicious!

I thought it was brilliant. I added some kidney beans, chili powder and used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. I kept it nice and thick and served it on toast. I will definitely be making this one again. 5 Stars.

This soup was very good, but can be adapted to your individual tastes by adding other ingredients.  I didn't have vegetable broth on hand so I used water and added extra spices.  Instead of thinning it with water I added milk and just a touch of sugar for a slightly sweet taste.  It was delicious.

This soup is so delicious.  I used chicken broth as I am not fond of the taste of canned vegetable broth.  I didn't quite use the full amount of curry and added a little salt to taste.  I thought it was absolutely great as is, without the addition of extra spices or garlic.  It made a nice, light first course for our meal and what a great way to get your veggies!

The only down-side to this recipe is that someone has to peel the carrots...!  It doesn't taste of curry, but rather has a wonderful subtle flavour.  It's also really quick to make.  I've made this several times and have been asked for the recipe over and over.  Serve with some quality grainy bread.

I have made this recipe several times now.  It has become a regular in our bi-weekly menu.

The other day I started this recipe without checking to see if I had all of the ingredients.  I had all but the vegetable broth.  So I used water and added a bit of salt.  It was still great.

This recipe is delicious! I added a tsp more curry and a tsp of cloves as well. I like the pureed texture, so I didn't add water at the end. I also think that it would take away from the incredibly full flavor of the soup!

I added 3 cubes of frozen crushed garlic when adding curry.
Was in a hurry, so I used frozen carrots and instant soup mix for stock. 
Was delicious!

Excellent soup! I took the advice of other reviews and added other spices. I also added celery and garlic. I threw the whole thing in the crock-pot and used a hand blender to mix it up when it was done. I will definitely make this soup again in a larger amount and freeze some.

Really good! I used whole baby carrots, and after an hour of cooking they still weren't totally soft, but I went ahead and blended it anyway and it was fine. I also added some ginger, garlic, salt and pepper. Yum!
