This recipe is a staple at our house; I make it at least twice a week for Shabbat dinner.  I typically triple all of the ingredients.  I made some minor changes to the recipe; I sprinkle the brisket with salt, black pepper & parsley flakes.  I only use organic ketchup or any ketchup that DOES NOT have corn syrup in it.  I have nothing against corn syrup, I've just found that the brisket has a better flavor when I use the ketchup without it.  I also use Vernor's ginger soda as I've found this brand to add the best flavor without being overly sweet.  Sometimes I leave the carrots out & it's still great.  I cook in my convection roasting oven at 375 degrees for the recommended time.  I then take the brisket out of the oven & let it rest for 15-20 minutes.  Then, I slice it & put it along with the sauce in a large crock pot on low until I'm ready to serve.  It's crazy but every single person that has eaten the brisket prepared this way says it's the best they've ever had & we're talking more than 60 people!!!

Very very successful!
Since we can't get ginger ale, I substituted with equal amounts of Coke-a Cola and sweet red wine.

This was FANTASTIC!!!  And so easy to prepare.  I made it last night for Passover (doubled the recipe because there were 9 of us) and everyone loved it.   Instead of cutting up large carrots, I simply added about 2 dozen baby carrots.  My 24 year old godson who loves to cook, enjoyed the brisket so much, I sent him home with a copy of the recipe.  :-)

Beware, this is a very sweet sauce. I even subbed half ketchup and half chili sauce and it was still too sweet. The taste was not bad, just too sweet for my family as we don't like meat to have a sweet taste. I guess I thought the soup mix would counter the sweet factor but it didn't. The brisket did turn out very tender and sliced perfectly. I rinsed the carrots off because they were coated with the sweet syrupy sauce! Didn't serve the sauce with the meat, but heated bottled bbq sauce instead. Thanks anyway.

I've reviewed a good number of recipes. Some, probably overly critically.  Always in search of that depth of flavor that makes the dish really come alive. 

"Grandma's Brisket"  is, how can I say this? Fantastic. Buttery smooth. Melt in your mouth. Delicious. You don't even have to chew.  

And who would want to? If you chew that means you have to swallow. That means the taste is gone and you have to eat....more. 

It's almost indescribable. It's that good. 

The only change I made, was to use a cooking bag for the first two hours and cut it open for the last hour. 

The beef melts in your mouth. Soft. Chewy. 

The carrots, infused with the beefy, onion, tomato flavor, are a meal unto themselves. They're that good. 

The wet works, left over in the bottom of the pan, are liquid gold. There is no other way to describe it.  Spoon them over the sliced meat and this is....perfect.

FABULOUS recipe.  I was worried that not having a marinated piece of meat would produce subpar results but this recipe is easy, flavorful, and requires no marination!  I added a couple shots of worcestershire and garlic powder to the sauce.  Served with boiled potatoes and green beans and carrots and drizzled the sauce on everything.  Yum.

This was the first time I ever had brisket and I have to say this was a great way to prepare it.  Easy and it tasted good, sort of like a roast, but not as fatty and I liked that.

I have made this recipe many times and it never fails to please.  I usually add more carrots and onions than called for, along with a few potatoes. Always comes out moist, tender and delicious.

This recipe made me look like a good cook when my grandma came to visit, which was nice!  The carrots that I cooked with the brisket turned out so good that I wished I had done a lot more, and potatoes too.

You should change the title to Amazing Brisket. The dinner turned out that good. I followed some of the changes. I did the chili sauce instead of ketchup. I added 2 bay leaves. I put peeled potatoes and celery along with baby carrots and onion all around roasting pan. After 2 hours of baking I removed the foil and then sprinkled with paprika. Tell Grandma I said thanks.

I followed this recipe (minus the carrots -- didn't have any) except I cooked it in the crockpot on low for 8 hours as I had the time.  I did not substitute or omit other ingredients.  Wouldn't doubt it was fantastic if cooked as instructed. It turned out great!!

This was very tasty! I'm only giving it 4 instead of 5 stars because it was not tender enough after 3 hours in the oven. I sliced it up after 3 hours and put it in a crock pot on high for 2 more hours. Then, it was nice and tender. I was also concerned about it being too sweet so I used Newcastle beer instead of ginger ale.

This was okay, but I don't think I will do again....vegetables were wonderful but the meat was a bit dry and boring. I had a 6 pound brisket so I doubled everything.

I never have any luck with brisket but this was a real winner.  So proud of myself.  Just needed more liquid.  Of course added potato.

OUTSTANDING!  My husband is a real meat and potato guy and loves Brisket.  I love anything that can be delivered to my door.  I gave him my word that ONE DAY I would make a Brisket for him and kept that word last week.  You can't imagine what a sensation it was.  This recipe is perfect, don't play with it, don't make corrections to it - just do as PJCHECK'S grandmother used to do and you'll be making the best Brisket on earth.

This was the best brisket I have ever made!  Delicous!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I put into the crockpot for 8 hours on low.  Flavorful and tender and ready to go when I got home from work.  I also added a few baby Yukon gold potatoes to round out the meal.  Thank you for sharing!

my Bubbie has made this all my life for every holiday.  We are a large family so we always try to get as close to 5lb brisket.  cook for 40 minutes per pound is perfect.  also, we do not use gingerale, I substitute a equal amount of good red wine.   we have always found that it is best to let cool, slice and re warm.  this freezes beautifully.

I had to prove my worth to my Jewish husband and in-laws by making a killer brisket. This recipe foot the bill, thank you PJCheck! Next time I will make my own dry onion soup mix to lessen the sodium, just a personal preference. Other than that no complaints, as they loved it and devoured every morsel.

Not real crazy about this recipe.  The sauce congealed into a thick greasy paste at the bottom of the pan after I took the lid off.  I ended up having to use bottled barbecue sauce.  Won't be making this again.

This was good.  It was a bit sweet for our liking, but overall it was a yummy dinner.  I cooked it is the crock pot for 6 hours on low and followed some other reviewers advice to use 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 chili sauce.  I also added 2 tsp garlic, 2 tsp Worcestershire, and 2 tsp Siracha.  I also used carrots, onions, and potatoes but this would be good with any root vegetable.

MY mother uses a similar recipe with only one change- we use water instead of ginger ale. I have never considered another option since her brisket was so good, but I may have to try it.  Otherwise,the lipton onion soup and ketchup (and slow cooking at 325 for 3 hours or more) does the trick!  Thanks!

BEST BRISKET RECIPE EVER! I've been using Allrecipes.com for years and this is the first time I felt compelled to write a review. I made the recipe exactly as written complete with carrots and onions. The only difference is that I used a 6lb brisket so I doubled everything. My entire family including grandparents and cousins polished off the whole thing (I was planning on leftovers!). Finally, I've found "my" brisket recipe.

Very yummy and so simple to make!  However, during the last hour of cooking I had to add water as the sauce was getting very thick and I was scared it would burn.  So every few minutes during the last hour I added a bit of water and it still tasted GREAT!  The added water didn't dilute the taste one bit!

Yum...just yum!  I put about 4 small potatoes cut up in the pan, and it always comes out great.  One time I felt as if I didn't have enough liquid so the next time I made it I wound up doubling the liquid - which was a BAD idea!  So definitely don't do that.

Very easy recipe. Didn't have ginger ale so I used a bottle of alcohol beer. Baked in Pyrex 9x12 at 300 degrees. I have my next one in the oven. Delicious. Trying it with potatoes.

This is a simple recipe.  The best recipes usually have modest ingredients.  I added garlic because everything is better with garlic!  I also substituted beer in place of the ginger ale. Then, I served it with rosemary potatoes and braised cabbage.Delicious.

This recipe was fantastic, my family loved it!!! I bought a brisket a little over 8pds. I used 1 box of onion soup mix and one box of onion and mushroom soup mix. The vernors ginger ale tip was great. I already have request's for the recipe.

Very good recipe.  Added 2 tsp each of crushed garlic and sriracha.  Cooked in crock pot on low for 6 hours.  Would probably add more hot sauce next time, as we like a kick.  But I'll definitely make again.  Thanks!

Instead of putting this in the oven, we use the crock pot and it's Excellent! The mean & carrots come out so tender and juicy.  We also add potatoes with it.  I found this recipe about 2 weeks ago and we've had it twice already.

This was delicious!!  I was hesitant at first, but with all of the good reviews I figured I would try it.  I used a 5lb brisket and cooked it at 350 covered for 3 hours and then 1 hour uncovered.  The only problem was that I did not double the ketchup/gingerale/onion soup mix so we did not have enough gravy for the leftovers.  I will definitely be making this again!!

Absolutely tasty.  Hubby loved it.  I found it too tough and stringy for my taste.  I think I'll marinate it next time.

I love this VERY easy recipe.  It is very flavorful and easy to do.  The only draw back is that it takes 3 hours to cook, so it needs to be a meal I do over the weekend or when I get home early from work.

I also let it marinate overnight by preparing it the day before.  I also throw in more veggies like big chunks of onions, squash & zucchini.  I would include broccoli, but I know it won't cook well.  Enjoy!

Based on the ratings I took a chance and made this for a holiday gathering without testing it first.  It was amazing. I was surprised considering my grandmother's recipe takes days and several steps; not to mention at least twenty ingredients.  The carrots were caramelized and sweet, the onions were brown and juicy. My guests raved about it for days.  I will be making this again.

This recipe was easy, but I think that the cooking time should be cut down by 20 minutes on the first time and maybe 30 minutes without the lid. Or maybe keep it covered for the entire time. It was a little dry.  Also, I think that catsup shoud be cut in half, and add a half cup of cocktail sauce. There should be more of a balance of salty, sweet and spicy.  I also added more carrots and potatoes.  Next time I will try mushrooms.

Outstanding, I cut the ketchup in half and used 6 oz. of Diet Ginger ale. Added a few drops of Worcestershire . Was tender, Now overly sweet like someone else stated. I also coated the meat both sides with salt, pepper, and garlic powder before adding anything pertaining to the recipe, because I do that to all meats. This is a definite redo.

I made this exactly as written, almost! I didn’t have onion soup mix so I made some, which is also easy. I gave this recipe 5 stars because it was so easy to make and so delicious. I didn’t find it too sweet. I will be making this one again and again!

Since my husband doesn't like any spices (flavor) ;) I had to modify this recipe.  I used an 8oz. can of no salt added tomato sauce instead of  ketchup and left out the onion soup mix packet.  I used a whole medium sweet onion, cut in large chunks, and about 3 - 4 med. carrots and the ginger ale.  It was AMAZING!  Even I liked it!  I usually have to have some kind of seasonings on my food, especially salt.  I love salt!  It was so tender and had a delishous sweetness to it.  This  recipe is going to be added to my favorites and we'll make it often!  Thanks for sharing it!!!!

Excellent, simple recipe. It's super moist. I've made this two years in a row and it's a crowd pleaser. Great recipe.

The flavor was good, although I agree it's s little sweet as others have said, I made it exactly according to the recipe, but after I removed the cover, all the gravy dried out. I kept adding water so there was liquid to cook in and ultimately added several cups of water. But it still tasted good.  I sliced the meat and put it back in the pan and left it in the fridge overnight.  When I reheated it the next day (an hour in 300 degrees) I added another cup of water to create more gravy. We all liked it, but all agreed we have had better brisket before.

I make this with a simpler variation:  I use one cup of ketchup, one can of whole berry cranberry sauce, one cup water and one packet Lipton beef/onion soup.  For best results, place the brisket in aluminum foil (criss cross two pieces), poor the mixture over it and then  wrap  the foil tightly.  Keeping the meat in the foil the entire time keeps in the juices and makes the meat much more tender.  You will love love this way and it is so much easier.

I made this almost exactly as the recipe stated except I used chili sauce instead of ketchup. My husband and I loved it and he is super picky.  I left the roasting pan covered the entire time and the brisket was very tender. We will make this again.

I only used a 2 pounds brisket and cooked at 350 for a little less than 2 hours.  Very good, although I think I messed something up because the sauce/gravy wasn't very thick.  Will definitely make this again.

the seasoning was super. I didn't have the burn problem, but it did come out super salty. It could have been the onion soup mix that I used, but I will be trying this recipe again and adding some water to thin it out. Thanks for the post!

The brisket itself was good, but the jusices burned after I uncovered the meat.  I think it might have been the ginger ale.  I have never had this problem with other brisket recipes.

While it was tasty, i found that the brisket was still a bit on the tough side. Also, the topping crusted over quite hard and my kids wanted to cut it off. i thought more veggies (carrots and onions) than the recipe called for would be better.
