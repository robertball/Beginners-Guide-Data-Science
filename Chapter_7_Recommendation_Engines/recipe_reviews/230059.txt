Had this with our lunch today – delicious, as I suspected. I only had dried rosemary on hand, which I ground into a powder in a mortar before adding; that distributed the flavor evenly throughout the dish. Everything was spread out in one layer on a baking sheet, so it was ready in just half an hour. The edges of the squash cubes caramelize slightly, which really brings out the sweetness in this otherwise savory, earthy dish.

Used cubed fresh butternut squash I purchased at the store.  This was an excellent recipe to use.  We loved it.  I looked at other recipes so the second time I made it and saw that an addition of an onion also brings out the flavor.  I added a chopped onion the second time I made it and the flavor is delightful.  The onions and garlic caramelize and make the roasted butternut squash flavor even better.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of dried instead of fresh rosemary.  The second time I made it I did use about triple the amount of butternut squash so I had to cook it for close to 1-1/2 hrs. at 400 degrees.

Wow. So surprised I didn't like this recipe. Actually, only one person did and we threw it out after dinner. I thought I'd love it because it is very similar to a recipe that was on this site several years ago, and everyone would fight over the last bit in the pan. Only change I made was to add freshly chopped parsley instead of the Rosemary, shredded Romano halfway through cooking and a little garlic Parmesan herb panko. We should have loved it, but I think I figured out the problem. The dish was a bit bitter, and I read a few others had this problem too. I read about garlic, and found out that when garlic is overlooked it can turn bitter. This recipe is cooked rather high and long. I think if I try this again I will stir in the garlic halfway through the cooking. I have only experienced this once before, and that was in a recipe for garlicky roasted cauliflower on this site- it was the consensus of most reviewers there that the garlic needed to be added halfway through cooking, too. Most other recipes I make that include garlic are not usually cooked at this high of a heat. Also worth noting is that garlic  gets its flavor from diallyl disulfide, which is a natural oil that turns bitter when exposed to air, why it is important to cook it soon after mincing, choosing low slow heat. It is important when cooking garlic with other vegetables (on the stove or in the oven)  to add it after they have already become soft, because not only does it become bitter, but can burn easily.

Easy and excellent flavor.  After peeling the squash I microwaved it whole for a few minutes to make it easier to cut into cubes.  Also used dried rosemary and flavor was excellent.  This recipe will be used often.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe!  I bought the butternut squash cubes at Costco and used dried chopped rosemary and the minced garlic from a jar and roasted it all at 425 and it only took about 25 minutes.  Delicious and easy!!

I loved it. There are still 3 large butternut squash in the basement from last year's garden and it's May here in Colorado so I'm always on the lookout for good squash recipes. Sometimes people complain about peeling and dicing the squash but I just sit down at the dining room table, tune the radio to my favorite station and enjoy making something healthy for my family. Many vegies are prepared in the South this way; sit out on the front porch shelling peas or stripping greens off the stalks and talking to neighbors who venture by. I love the fresh rosemary in this recipe. Thanks Kristin

Make sure not to cut the squash too small or it could burn it. Delicious though! :) Use organic fresh rosemary. It does make a difference!

This was SO good. I used dried herbs because that's all I had, but it turned out delicious! I will definitely make again, and I might try mashing the squash after roasting them for a delicious mashed potato substitute!

To cut the squash I cut the ends off and peeled with a vegetable peeler, cut the squash in 1/2 lengthwise and scooped out the seeds before dicing. Easy peasy! I loved the combination of rosemary and garlic in this tasty side dish. Instead of olive oil I chose coconut oil. I lined my pan with non-stick aluminum foil and that may have been a mistake since the squash did not caramelize.  I like my roasted butternut squash to take on more of a firm bite. Roasting for 40 minutes gave me a very soft overcooked texture. Next time I will use regular foil to help with the caramelizing and roast for a shorter time. Delicious!

this was my first time trying Butternut Squash and let me just ECHO what everyone else has said about the cutting...GOOD LAWD...even with a brand new knife it wasn't easy. 

It would have been helpful (since I didn't have sense enough to Google it beforehand) to know how much 
dried Rosemary is the equivalent of 2 sprigs (don't think I used enough)  and as a beginner cook it would have been helpful to have more specifics on salt instead of "to taste" especially given that I didn't know what Butternut Squash was supposed to taste like.  

Now with that said...it came about pretty good and I THINK I like Butternut squash but the verdict is still out on if I like it enough to hassle with cutting/peeling it...but overall this was a pretty simple and tasty (might have been more tasty had I known how to better season) recipe for me to start with.

Rosemary Roasted Butternut Squash Haiku: "Rough to cut & cube, but the taste ended up great. A 'low guilt' side dish." I made this as an alternative to roasted red potatoes to eat w/ pork tenderloin, and we were just as happy w/ the results, despite them not getting crispy. The most frustrating part was cutting, peeling and cubing the squash, but the end result was enjoyed by my husband, 8YO and 14MO. Leftovers weren't so great though, but I mashed them up for the baby to nom later on.

This is my first review on this website, but I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now. It just melts in your mouth, a perfect mix of sweet and savory. Plus it's great for warming up the house on a chilly fall day.  The recipe is wonderful as is, but I enjoy it even more using coconut oil instead of olive oil.

Very nice. I added 1/2 large onion and a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon - turned out very nice.  Be careful not to burn. Mine was ready in 35 minutes at 400 degrees.

I used a store bought garlic herb blend instead of the fresh garlic and rosemary from our garden. I also bought the pre-cut squash cubes so I didn't have to spend so much time on prep. so, so good.

This is so simple and was incredibly delicious.  The butternut squash actually tasted rather sweet and my husband thought that it was sweet potatoes.  The fresh rosemary really gives this dish an extra kick.

Absolutely delicious and easy. I cheated and bought already cubed squash at the store. I've made this several times and will do so again.

This recipe is wonderful!  Easy, hearty and restaurant--like quality.  Use fresh rosemary if possible, it really makes the dish. Mine never caramelized which would have been even better so I may have to tinker with heat next time to try and make that happen.  My two sprigs of rosemary were large and might be too much for some, so cut back as needed to taste.

It was easy and tasty. I also added carrots to it and both the squash and carrots were tasty. I put the butternut squash in microwave for 2 minutes to make a peeling a breeze. I used one medium size squash and 3 carrots. Everyone enjoyed this dish a lot.

We have fresh rosemary ,so I wanted to try this recipe! I made it, except I used garlic powder instead of the fresh. I think it would be delicious with the fresh, though. I just didn’t have any at the time, so I improvised! Delicious!!

This was a very tasty recipe.  I did not have rosemary so I used cinnamon in the place of rosemary.  I covered the pan with foil the entire cooking time.  We decided it would be better to only cover it for 1/2 to 3/4 of the time to give the chunks to get more crispy.

The recipe is great for well seasoned butternut squash.   The only issue I have is the cooking time.  45 minutes is too long if you are cutting 1" cubes.   I recommend 35-40 minutes for 1" cubes.

I'm in the process of making this.  First of all, boy, is it hard to peel and then cube a butternut squash.  Sure isn't a fast recipe because then it has to roast 40-45 minutes.  Unless it's fabulous, I won't be making again anytime soon.

This was ahhhhmazing! I microwaved the squash for 3 min on each size prior to cutting it open (to make it easier to cube). I will for sure make this again.

I'll be making this again, loved the change from the plain oven baked half.   For the two of us, it makes it easier to cut and save half for another meal, rather than having  leftover squash.  I roasted it along with some thinly sliced onion that carmelized nicely, and the rosemary is a nice touch.

Used frozen cubed squash thawed slightly.  The recipe was good.  I ate it the first day as prepared.  The second day, I mashed up the reminder, added raw sugar, cashew milk, cinnamon, nutmeg and pecans and ate it for breakfast.  I would make it again.

This was very tasty and pretty easy to put together.
In this instance I bought a pre-peeled half squash that I just cubed.  I have a go to squash recipe and have peeled many so if you go fresh that WILL be the worst part of it.
I didn't have any fresh garlic or rosemary so used dry rosemary and garlic powder.  Flavor was good and sure it would have been even better with fresh herbs and garlic.
As others have mentioned it wasn't as crisp as I would have expected but they did caramelize nicely and while softer than expected it was not mushy.
Will definitely do it again and am also going to try it with cubed Sweet Potatoes which I think should also work well.

We made this exactly as the recipe stated, and it came out very well. I think the age of the squash, and size of cubes matters.  We will add more fresh rosemary and mix everything in a big bowl next time.

A quick note for easy peeling and cubing. Baking the butternut squash for 15-25 minutes at 170 degrees in the oven makes a WORLD of difference.

This recipe was delicious! I made no adjustments. I think using parchment paper on the sheet might help in getting the squash off.  Next time I'll add more Rosemary.

Poked holes in squash with a fork and cooked in microwave for 4 minutes. Still somewhat hard to peel and cut. Made exactly as recipe. Was way better than we expected. Will make again but only after buying already cut squash from grocery store, lol.

I made this tonight. It was great. I didn’t add garlic, I didn’t want it to burn so I added garlic powder. I did use a potato peeler as KGora suggested to peel off the skin, so it was quite simple. I will make it again and maybe add garlic next time.

Excellent!  Used extra whole garlic cloves, extra rosemary and combined everything and let marinade for an hour. Half way through cooking I added a chopped onion. Cooked directly on pan with no foil - like a little crispy. Broiled last 4 minutes.

Cut it really small, liked the texture and taste of the squash but not with the rosemary. It added bitterness. Will try again with a different herb.

pretty good way to make squash. I used dried rosemary and ground it in my mortar and pestle as another person suggested. I also added the onion that another person suggested. Love this website!

I absolutely love this recipe. This is exactly 1 of the 2 ways I'll eat butternut squash: Still tastes good if you use dried rosemary, but prefer fresh.

I made his for a family gathering.  Very flavorful, but the texture wasn't what I expected for a roasted veggie.  I will try it again and see if there was something I missed.  Would even be great if mashed, once it's done.

To peel butternut squash cut off both ends, makes some holes in peel all around with a fork, set in a microwave dish and microwave on high for about 3 1/2 minutes. Much easier to remove and not cooked very much at all.

I have never tried butternut squash this way. I usually eat it sweetened with brown sugar and butter. This is absolutely amazing! I love the subtle sweetness along with the hint of pine the rosemary provides. I ate all of the batch I baked and made it again the next night!

Everyone loved this! (and I have a non-veggie lover in the house). The squash came out sweet and tender, infused with the flavor or rosemary and garlic. The outside of the cubes crisped up nicely (some stuck to the baking dish which was annoying). I put the cubed squash, oil and herbs in a ziplock bag and let it marinate in the fridge for a couple hours. I don't know if that helped with the flavor any but it made prepping dinner later much easier. Also, my house loves garlic so I added chopped garlic for extra kick.

This was perfect. Used fresh everything. I put the whole squash in the microwave for 3 minutes prior to preparing and it really helped with the cutting and peeling. It's going to be a winter staple, thank you.

For this recipe I followed it to the T minus fresh rosemary. I only had dried on hand and it still came out delicious! I've made this multiple times and look forward to bringing it to events so other people can try too.

I was really surprised at the results.  It seemed too easy with just these few ingredients. My husband is not wild about squash, but he really liked this. I liked that there was no added sugar, but still lots of flavor.  Might try this for Thanksgiving!

Meh. It was okay. It lacked... zing. And I'm not talking about zing as in spicy hot - just something that made my taste buds pop. I think I'll keep looking for another good squash recipe.
