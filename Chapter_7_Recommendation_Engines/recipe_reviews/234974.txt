Came out absolutely perfect.  Winter comfort food. If you're not too bothered about calories you should try this: I dismissed the milk and the chicken broth and instead added a can of Campbell's condensed chicken soup with a cup of water, the mixture was thick and creamy and even more chickeny! Really nice touch. This pie lasted me and my boyfriend dinner and 2 lunches for work the next day! 
I will definitely be making this again and inviting people over to try :p

I sauteed about 1/2 cup of chopped celery along with the onion and made this using fresh carrots and skipped the peas and potatoes because I was out. I have an onion hater in the house so I grated the onion using my microplane zester. Worked like a charm - he didn't detect the onions and I got the flavor I wanted! I chose fresh carrots because in my experience the canned vegetables seem to be mushy and fresh is best in my house. I really like store rotisserie chicken and using that cut down on time of having to cook it yourself. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of sage for a little more flavor. I used chicken broth called for but I highly recommend using chicken stock. It is deeper in color and flavor. I thought this tasted ok. My husband liked it.

Just made this tonight with a few small modifications. I used a bag of frozen mixed veggies and I cut up Russett potatoes instead of the ones from the can. My husband said it was the best pot pie I've made yet.

This was the easiest chicken pot pie I have ever made. My family really loves this. I did not have any canned carrots so when I boiled the chicken breast I added carrots to the water along with some chicken base. I also cubed a couple of potatoes as well and boiled with chicken and carrots. For the chicken stock I used the water I boiled chicken in.. Was outstanding.. Will definitely make again and again.. 
I use the sauce recipe for the gravy in my chicken and noodles.. Thank you Samantha for sharing this wonderful recipe

Followed the recipe with these exceptions:. Instead of chicken broth and milk, I took someone else's suggestion and added a can of condensed cream of chicken soup and 1 c of chicken broth.  I couldn't find canned carrots and peas so I just used a can of mixed vegetables, drained.  I cut up the canned potatoes to bite size pieces.  I also used canned chicken and cut back on the salt because of using a lot of canned items.  It turned out GREAT!  The whole family loved it and I am going to have to make 2 pot pies next time so that everyone can have seconds.

Definitely not the Chicken Pot Pie my mom made. My suggestions: add some thyme, sage & other herbs, omit the canned veggies & use steamed  fresh or frozen for better flavor & nutrients, add sauteed onions & mushrooms if you like them. It's not that hard to make these changes, but well worth it to make an impressive pot pie.

This was an excellent beginners recipe. To add more flavor, I added 1/2 teaspoon sage, 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1/4 teaspoon thyme. I also precooked the bottom pie crust for about 4 minutes. I rolled out both pie crusts with a rolling pin to fit my pie dish better, and let them sit for about 15 minutes to thaw some. I used 3 cups of chicken because I didn't use potatoes. I also brushed the top of the pie crust with eggs before cooking and with melted butter after cooking. - steph for Mom's Chicken Pot Pie

As a citizen of the USA living in Sweden with my Swedish husband and our teenage refugee from Afghanistan (plus two of his friends), no one else in my family had ever before encountered Chicken Pot Pie.  When I saw this recipe, I knew I had to make it and to my great disappointment, there was only one small piece left-over for my lunch the next day!  GRIN!  In other words, it was a complete hit and I have already been requested to make it again SOON!!  For a recipe that does not call for the chopping of all fresh vegetables, which therefore makes it a snap to prepare, it was simply AWESOME.  I urge you, give yourself and your family a treat and make this soon!  Thank you so very, very much Samantha!

Just like my Mum used to make. The only difference is that I do not like potatoes in chicken pie so just used fresh peas, carrots and onions. Delicious and easy to make.

I am ashamed as a 30 year old woman to have  little to no cooking skills and have finally decided to get serious and learn by trial and error with "easy" recipes like the one. This was supposed to be beginner friendly, and it really was. It tasted great. The only thing is, I used cream instead of milk (because I only had skim and thought it would make it too watery) - it tasted good but i think between the butter and cream it was a little too heavy on the tummy. So next time I'll definitely use milk. The other problem I had was that the bottom crust didn't cook enough. The top looked great and was ready to go, but after cutting it, I saw the bottom was a little doughy. I wonder if I should cook the bottom pastry a little first? Or simply move it to the bottom of my oven instead of the center? Not sure if my oven sucks at giving off bottom heat or if I did something wrong. 

Other than the doughy bottom crust, this was great!

I was a little hesitant to try this because it was all canned ingredients, but decided to give it a go because I was feeling lazy. It was so good! My husband said it was the best chicken pot pie he ever had.

Fantastic recipe!  I was looking for something to do with my leftover turkey.  I made my own crust, used turkey, frozen peas and carrots, and raw potato instead of the suggested recipe ingredients.  I also cooked mine 40 minutes and let it set 15 minutes.  It turned out perfect.  I will make this again with leftover chicken!

I sauteed a stalk of chopped celery with the onions. I boiled chicken leg quarters all day with seasonings for the chicken so I had my own broth. I added a bag of frozen veggies that I steamed for the least amount of time on the package and left out the potatoes since I didn't have any. This is the best chicken pot pie I have ever had! Everyone in my family had seconds. I am so glad I made the decision to double the recipe even before trying it!! :)

This was a great recipe! Easy and delicious. I used a few ideas from other raters, such as using a 1/2 tsp of sage and using a rotisserie chicken. I tried the original recipe of canned peas, carrots and potatoes. They turned out great. I would suggest cutting the potatoes though. Enjoy!

Do yourself a favor and boil your fresh potatoes and carrots with your chicken the day before. Extra yummy after being refrigerated overnight.  I did use canned peas. I didn't use celery but if I had read the reviews first, I would have. Really good idea and I'll do that next time.  This is a delicious recipe. Enjoy!

This was delicious! I think part of the reason was because I used a homemade broth that was highly seasoned with garlic,  onions, and celery. I also added poultry seasoning. I used frozen, not canned, peas and carrots. I baked it in a deep, glass pie dish and I had to cook it  nearly  25 minutes longer to get the bottom crust cooked. I wished I had pre-baked the bottom crust a bit as another reviewer suggested. My family really enjoyed it.

Super easy and delicious.  Used 2 frozen chicken breasts, baked and diced.Followed recipe exactly, with the one exception of using an onion/celery mix in place of the onion.  Will make again.
Update: made again using 1 potato, diced and microwaved, 1/2 an onion and 3/4 bag of peas and carrots.  Used 2.5 chicken breasts baked with Montreal chicken seasoning.  Family loved it.

Great recipe came out perfect.  Only change I made was, since I don't care much for onions, I substitued mushrooms and it tasted great.  Best news is I have leftovers and will enjoy again tomorrow night!!

First time I ever made a pot pie.  This recipe was very easy to make. I did make a couple small changes.  Instead of using 1-3/4 cups of chicken broth, I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and about one cup of broth.  I probably could have used up to 1-1/4 cups. I did use about double the vegetables.  With the changes I made, the consistency was perfect!  Sparky

I mainly used this for a sauce base. Used all fresh veggies steamed in the microwave and crust made from biscuits.

I sautéed rosemary chicken breast for it. I added drippings from that to the the milk/broth mixture. I sautéed garlic with the onions. I used frozen vegetables and left out the potatoes. I also used homemade pie crust. Everything else was the same and it came out awesome!

This was great whole family loved it. I don't like to change things but I did read some of the reviews of doing the can of chicken condensed soup with  chicken broth and I used mixed vegetables cuz I could not find carrots and peas so I did the mixed vegetables Frozen.

I didn't think it would be that good because of the canned veggies but didn't have much time so I made it.  It was delicious!! My family loved it and is begging for more. Made it exactly as stated except added a little bit of celery too. I then read an article about how canned and frozen veggies are more nutritious than fresh, so hey, keeping it just as it is!! I did use an organic refrigerated pie crust and all organic canned ingredients, and bought a pre-cooked roasted organic chicken at the store. Delicious.

This is the perfect basic chicken pot pie recipe. Add or subtract any veggies, herbs and seasonings you like. Turned out wonderful and my family loves it! I will make this repeatedly.
Thanks for sharing this recipe.

YUMMY!! The ultimate comfort food!! This pie was easy to put together and was DELICIOUS. I used a frozen, deep dish, two-crust pie shell that has been in my freezer. I cut up frozen roast chicken and used fresh vegetables that I had on hand (I don't do canned vegetables). Those included red onions and carrots plus red pepper, and fresh mushrooms. I used only one small potato and would leave it out the next time as the crust provides plenty of carbs. I chose to add summer savory (I didn't have the thyme that I wanted) to the salt and fresh ground pepper. The pie held together beautifully so that I was able to freeze two individual pieces  for upcoming comfort meals. I can't wait to make this again.

Used recipe but had to change a little bit. I used the Pillsbury tub of gluten free pie crust. I boiled my cut up potatoes, carrots, chicken and frozen peas and added powdered chicken broth base to the water and used that for my broth. I had to use gluten free flour for the broth with dairy free butter and cashew milk.  Finished product was beautiful and delicious!  Thank you.

My gang liked it but not as much as some of the other pot pie recipes on All recipes. Better to use more carrots and if using frozen, be sure to cook the veggies ahead of time.

I have made this several times and it always turns out delicious. I do use frozen peas and carrots instead of canned. I also add some poultry seasoning to the filling, adds a lot of flavor.

Delicious. Great recipe, thank you!  I Made it with leftover chicken/veggies.  I may pre-cook the bottom crust though, next time. It was still doughy.

I thought it was too easy to be good but the family went crazy over it. Had to double it (but only used 1 can of potatoes) - a pie would barely feed 3 here! Used my Pampered Chef microwave chicken cooker and that did a great job. Added a 1/2 teaspoon thyme for the doubled recipe and may use frozen vegetables next time - the canned carrots and peas were a little too mushy for my taste.  Replacing the chicken pot pie recipe I had in my cookbook and making this the new one!

This was really good! I doubled the recipe so it would make two pies, used real not canned food and just boiled  the veggies before adding so that they were tender, and made homemade pie crust--YUM besides the work in making the homemade pie crusts this recipe is really quite simple and flexible.

June 28, 2016:
I have now made this five times and it has become a family favorite. I add and exchange veggies as they are on hand, sometimes I double the sauce to make it extra creamy...truly FANTASTIC!

Easy and delicious! I cannot say enough about this recipe. I bought a fresh rotisserie chicken and pulled it apart. I also made individual pot pies in ramekins. These were a huge hit. Makes four individual pot pies. Will definitely add it to the rotation!

This was amazing and so simple! I've tried many different pot pie recipes and this one is by far the easiest and probably the best tasting.  The only thing I can add is that I seasoned my chicken with Lawrys and baked it - them omitted the salt, and used puff pastry sheets!  A definite keeper!

The taste was awesome.  However, it was too liquid.  I used fresh vegetables (carrots, sweet potato, and green beans), and substituted about half of the butter with olive oil.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  I do not know if this was a factor.  Next time I will try less liquid to start.  And there will be a next time as both my wife and 7 yr old love the taste.

So easy to make and came out delicious! I don’t have a deep pie dish but used a regular one and it was fine. I also used fresh carrots, potatoes and frozen peas because that’s what I had and it was fine. I will definitely be making this again and again! So good!

As I have tried many recipes for Chicken Pot Pie, and none, obviously to my liking, I was more than a little skeptical to try yet another one.

Made this two weeks ago following the recipe exactly. IT. WAS. PERFECT! Until there wasn't any left. I made it again tonight headed on travel reviews from the family. Except I doubled the recipe because it was that good the first time around.

This is simply the best make at home chicken pot pie recipe ever! (I'm very partial to John Harvard's Brewery's chicken pot pie. Though that's no longer available to me in the DC area.) My family is in love with this! Thank you!

It was very good but not enough seasoning so I added about one teaspoon of thyme and parsley. Next time I make it I will add more of these. I also plan to make more of the base/juice. My husband really liked it.

Love this recipe—super easy and you should have most ingredients in the house. It’s a family favorite! (Tip: when making chicken breasts, I often make extra, cut them up and freeze. You’ve got an easy meal a week or two later!!)

I made this with a few modifications suggested in other reviews. I added sliced celery and sautéed it along w/ the onion. I also substituted the broth w/ a can of cream of chicken soup and a can of milk and a teaspoon of garlic herb seasoning. It was creamy & flavorful. My family LOVED it and asked me to make sure to save it so we could make it again. I would add a little more liquid either milk or broth to keep it from getting too thick. Definitely recommend.

Made this for dinner tonight! Declared just like momma made. Used frozen mixed vegetables and hash brown potatoes in place of the canned. Just nuked them briefly to defrost them a bit.

This was absolutely delicious and very easy to make!! I made my own chicken broth from when I boiled my chicken breasts (3 thin breasts). I also used more seasoning then just salt and pepper like onion powder & garlic powder. I continuously seasoned to taste while making the rue before putting in my chicken and vegetables. I also used the whole can of potatoes and cut them in fourths. It was delicious and I’m going to make a second one tomorrow!!

I've made this recipe twice now, and my husband and I both love it - with some modifications:  1) per reviewer suggestions, I added 1/2 tsp each dried sage and thyme; 2) used frozen peas and fresh carrots and potatoes, which I pre-cooked (3/4 cup each); 3) pre-baked bottom crust about three minutes; 4) upped the salt to 3/4 tsp.  The four-star rating is because I modified the original recipe; wiith these changes I'd rank it five stars.

Really good.  Some changes - I used fresh carrots and potatoes, and frozen peas.  I also added celery which helped.  I let all the ingredients simmer in the skillet for several minutes even though the recipe didn't say to.  I think it helped thicken up the mixture a bit and it came out great.

I made this and it was delicious! Rich and creamy and so flavorful. The only thing I will change when I make it next time is to omit the potatoes. With the peas and carrots that was enough of the veggies for us.

I'm going to rate this 5 stars but I DID use the veggies I had on hand: braised celery, corn and frozen carrots that I steamed a few minutes in the microwave. I had homemade turkey stock from the turkey I baked a few days earlier and used that same meat in the pie. Also did as suggested by some to bake the bottom crust before filling. My husband, who dislikes any pot pies, ate it for two days.

I made a Kosher version - not mixing milk and meat. 

   I used Almond Milk and  1 tablespoon of vegetable oil instead of butter.  I Also added a small can of  kosher cream corn for flavour and consistency. To thicken  if necessary, add  1 tablespoon of cornflour  to completed vegetable/chicken mix . To keep it really simple I bought and used Kosher frozen pastry dough. 
   This came out fabulous! A definite addition to our monthly meal menu. Thank you!

This was SO GOOD!!! I was honestly a little nervous to make homemade chicken pot pie. But it was super easy and so good! My whole family loved it so much..I made it two weekends in a row. It is now one of my go-to meals. Love it!

Made it for the family and it was a hit! Everyone loved it and went for seconds. Deviated from the recipe by using fresh potatoes and frozen vegetables. Cooked the chicken in a country herb seasoning that fit this meal perfectly. Thank you for the guidance!

Wonderful! I tweaked a little based on others' reviews. I used an entire can of diced potatoes, 3/4 cup of frozen peas and carrots, 1/2 tsp fresh thyme, 1/2 tsp fresh sage. The pie crusts were refrigerated from Pillsbury. Turned out very well. I waited 15 minutes before serving, and I think waiting 20 would have been better -- a little runny, but tasted amazing.

I have made this several times and it never disappoints. I use 2 cups frozen peas and carrots or sometimes frozen mixed vegetables (peas, carrots, green beans, and corn) instead of canned and nix the potatoes.  This is a hit with the whole family even the picky toddler.

If you are a pot pie novice, this is the perfect recipe to follow.  I have found that pot pies are deceptively labor intensive  because there can be a lot of veggie preparation.  I like this recipe because there is not too much prep and it is very easy to make your own customizations.  Also, the entire family enjoyed the outcome.  I have deleted the other chicken pot pie recipes that I have on file.

I left out peas (don't like) and added corn instead.  Also used 2 garlic cloves.  Only did pie crust on top of mixture.  Was very good and easy to make!  Definitely making again with winter approaching.

Very delicious and the kids loved helping to make it.  I cooked two chicken breasts and two chicken thighs  in an instant pot with two cups of water for 12 minutes.  From that I measured out two cups of the chicken and  then i used the juice at the bottom of instant pot for broth.   I also gave the top crust a good egg wash and this recipe is a keeper!

I couldn't find just peas and carrots, so I just used mixed veggies.  So I had peas, carrots, green beans and corn in mine.  I was delicious.  I used shredded chicken and a little extra salt.  But it came out really good.  I'll prob do it again when I have more people to serve it to.

I changed the recipe to 3 servings and make 2 individual pies for me and my husband.  I do add just a tiny bit of a seasoning for chicken and we think it enhances the flavor.  I use frozen vegetables.  We love this recipe, it's easy and I've made it at least once a month or so for several years now.  With a regular size pie, we ended up throwing some away after several meals of it.  The 2  individual ones work great for us.

An amazing recipe! I used one of those cubes for chicken broth, and had to add extra water and milk. Before putting the stew into the dough, I put the first layer of dough in the oven for a little over five minutes. Then took it out and added the stew and another layer of dough for the top; tasted amazing!

This very delicious and easy to make, I wished that I made this many years ago!  I used half and half instead of regular milk and 3 cups of frozen mixed vegetables.  I used two and half cups of diced yellow potatoes, which I pre cooked in microwave for about 3 minutes.  The potatoes finished cooking in the oven.  I read this tip in a review and would like to thank them but can’t remember who it was.  Also another tip I read was to pre cook the bottom pie crust for 6 minutes, which I did to ensure bottom was well cooked and not gooey.  I do not have a deep pie dish so I used a 10” cast iron pan . My family loved this and claimed it was way better than frozen store bought pies.

This is a great recipe and can easily be changed a bit without a huge disaster.  Husband likes mixed veges so i used two cans plus a chopped baked potato and seasonings we like.  Always cook the sauce to  thicken then add extra broth  while stirring.  You don't want the inside of your pot pie dried up so let sauce be a little runny. edit to add: don't use cream of chicken soup ! Use broth and milk as recipe states to enjoy a real chicken pot pie taste.

This was great and so so easy.  Really delivered wow-factor comfort food in my house.  I followed all technique and timing as described.  I had to make a few ingredient shifts due to what was on hand, used fresh red potato instead of canned, pre-made crust, and corn instead of peas but I would not hesitate to follow exactly as written.

Delicious - my husband said so and had not been looking forward to chicken pot pie for his birthday (of which he didn’t tell me till afterwards!) The whole extended family loved it. I used frozen deep-dish pie shells, one thawed enough to top the other. I substituted one cream of chicken soup and can full of water for the broth and milk. Because I was doubling the recipe, I also used another soup (and can of water) but chose cream of celery. I used frozen peas and carrots, and fresh peeled diced potatoes. I cooked the potatoes about 7 min. I placed pies on lowest oven rack to make sure bottom crust wasn’t undercooked. Top crust browned beautifully. Will be a new family favorite!

I used about 2 cups of frozen veggies instead and 2 small potatoes diced into small pieces.  I ended up freezing the pie for another night. Turned our great.  Will definitely make again. Even with left over turkey .

why am i finding cooking a pleasure? I hated it  when i had to think about 3 meals a day when the kids were young. The most I have ever did with left over chicken was chicken salad or hot chicken sandwiches.  I have never ever been a pie maker. I found it very frustrating so Mrs Smith was my best buddy over the holidays. Since retiring I have a new found interest in cooking (I do enjoy having a cocktail or two when I cook) ! Allrecipes.com has become my go to cookbook. My husband asked me to make a chicken pot pie and I gave him the evil eye ball but I made it. My crust looked pretty disgusting but the pot pie was delicious. 
I made it as is, didnt change anything. 
Two thumbs up for Moms chicken pot pie..

I really love this recipe! So easy to make, takes no time to make. I tend to keep the pantry stocked with can peas and carrots and sliced potatoes just for this dish alone. Just put on some Game of Thrones and have this cooking, time will fly by! Highly recommended friends!

My husband who says he "doesn't like chicken pot pie" loved this and ate two pieces immediately!  I did make a couple changes, just based on what I had on hand.  I used a can of mixed veggies instead of peas and carrots, added some sage, a bit of garlic and some parsley and used cream of chicken soup and 1 can of milk instead of broth.  Definitely will make again!

used frozen onions cause I didn't feel like chopping them. fresh carrots and frozen peas. completely forgot the potatoes until it was too late to bother and used turkey instead of chicken because I have a bunch of extra turkey from thanksgiving. also, I made biscuits to go with this instead of putting it in a pie crust. I think it is more filling this way. will absolutely make this again, hopefully not forgetting anything next time.

Great flavor.  Very good recipe. Really liked the potatoes. The sauce was a little thin.  Did not make for good leftovers, just okay.  I will make this again and work on a thicker filling.

Thats not cooking at all. Fresh veggies only with Fresh onion and garlic. Come on, canned potatoes ? Nasty. Try peeling and dicing a few  real spuds.. Chicken stock for sure. Pie Crust? Yeah. Buy it made...

Loved it! I added some celery for that base taste. It made too much filling so I will cut back a bit, especially the potatoes, maybe get a little can if possible. Other than that, great recipe! Heats up well and keeps for days.

This was a fantastic recipe! Unfortunately, I didn't have everything on hand and made a few minor changes. I used a half an onion and sauteed celery, carrots and potatoes with it for about 10 minutes. I didn't have flour so I used a big can of creamy chicken soup. I only added about 1/3 cup of milk to it. I  then added about 2 cups of frozen peas and 3 cups of chicken. Once heated through I put everyting in a glass pie dish and used two premade pie crusts for the bottom and top of the pie as suggested.  Using the creamy chicken soup added a great chicken flavor as another reviewer stated. I'll make it again the same way but will probably add some jalapenos to see what they might add. It was also very good the next day!! I won't try another recipe for a pot pie.

This was a big hit with my husband! It was also super easy. I made it last week and I'm making it again this week! 

My tips: I added tons of black pepper to spice it up a bit. I also used Tyson Grilled & Ready chicken.

I used rotisserie chicken, fresh celery, carrots, onion and potatoes. Added garlic, salt, pepper, sage and thyme. Used cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken, I have a thing about meat in a can! Next time, I'll roast all of the vegetables before adding them to the mixture to add a different flavor.

Delicious. Would definitely make it again. We ate the whole pie in one sitting. I don't like to change recipes either, but I also like to use what I have instead of making a trip to the grocery store. I used a can of cream of chicken with a can of chicken broth instead of the milk. Also I did pre steam my veggies. I used a bad of mixed veggies that I had in the freezer. It was excellent. It did take a bit longer than I thought because I cooked my own boneless skinless chicken in the oven first. I usually make a lot of chicken so that I have it for the week.  Thanks for the recipe.

Fabulous and super easy. I made my own crust and  I used frozen mixed veggies instead all of the other veggies except the fresh onion. It was delicious!

I make this a lot, but with frozen vegetables, not canned.  Love it and would give it 5 stars except it calls for canned veggies.

I read many reviews so I did add some thyme to the recipe, but even so, this recipe just didn't have enough flavor for me. I would suggest adding plenty of herbs. I also made my own crust, but forgot to add salt to the dough, so that didn't help matters. I will make it again, but next time I'll add salt, thyme, sage, and pepper.

We loved it!!! Used my own recipe for the crust.  Also, uses chicken stock instead of chicken broth and boiled some potatoes (not too long) and used frozen bags of carrots and peas.  Easy and delicious!

I make a chicken pot pie similar so I guess my review is a little more than a "tweak". I use fresh veggies and steam them slightly . No peas. I use celery and season more as the other reviews. Carrots, celery, potatoes and small cut string beans. But I follow the other directions.

I added 1 long fresh carrot and tiny raw potatoes, instead of the canned ones. I thought the pie should have had more gravy. Pretty tasty, though.

This is the best home made chicken pot pie recipe I have ever made!!  My husband said it was the best he had ever eaten.   I followed the recipe except I used whipping cream and added a little garlic  powder.  This is a keeper!!

Hey guys, for the first time I followed the recipe.  It turned out great! No extra stuff this time.  Used half of a rotisserie chicken. Good recipe for leftovers, last minute dinner.  Give it a try!

Yes, I will make it again and again!  So easy, full of flavor and so good. I used the frozen mixed veggies (carrots. Peas, carrots, etc ). Put the mixture  in a pie plate and covered it with AR's recipe for butter flaky pie crust. YUM!!  I made the filling a day ahead and had the pie for our meal the next day.

Seems like it made more to fill the pie dish.., so I froze the remaining filling.   It was tasty, but might need a bit more seasoning.

Oh my! Just like it’s described...easy and good. I took the “easy” a bit further and used canned chicken. Two cans made the 2 cups needed. And I added a can of green beans, kept the potatoes (yum) and added a bit of celery in with the onions. You can’t go wrong with this recipe. I know some people don’t like to hear how the recipe was changed, but I find it helpful to know what works and how I can make it work even if I don’t have all the ingredients. I tossed in some slices of fresh mushrooms just before baking. That worked well too. (And had a bit of the mixture that wouldn’t fit in the pie so I put it in another dish using bread as my crust. We’ll see how that turns out.)

I am making it and yet to eat it.  No where in the recipe does it mention what temp to bake it at. Instruction says to bake in a preheated oven.   Recipe is incomplete.
Will try 350f but this can be the difference between success and failure.

I used fresh vegetables and did not cook them before adding to recipe .  This is a big no no.  The sauce was too runny and vegetables not cooked all the way.  Even though, it was still good, I can't wait to make it again!

I am more of a pescatarian so I made the dish for my partner and he loved it. I used a mix of frozen peas and carrots (those are more fresh), and I stuck with the potatoes in a can because it would have been too much work. I was worried about the flavor not being rich enough so I added a can of cream of chicken and then added one cup of chicken broth. I would advise letting the butter melt in the skillet, and cooking the onion for about a minute before adding the flour.  Some people use rotisserie chicken which I am sure is great but when you cook the chicken you can add your own spices to give it a kick. I am curious if swaping the milk with heavy cream would work.

I love this recipe, it's very simple to alter for two.  But, I never use canned veggies when fresh or even frozen are available.
I never use broth when stock is in my refrigerator,  I also use light cream in place of milk,  I do however, take the short cut of the prepared pie crust and use it in a 8" cast iron pan, by using cast iron you never, and I mean never, have a soggy bottom crust. This is a wonderfully tasty and easy dish to prepare!

Not a bad way to start.  But, the very BEST way to make the filling for a chicken pot pie that will have EVERYONE begging for more is to shred some of the chicken you roasted, that was leftover from Sunday supper.  Add to that some  pre-cooked cubed carrots and potatoes.  Add some frozen corn.  And for the very best ingredient..... add the gravy you made from that delicious Sunday dinner.  Pour it all into a docked pie shell, cover with the top shell.  350 for about an hour.  Put it on a pan that has some foil on it.  You will love the end result

I used rotisserie chicken which definitely speeded up the process. I used a 16 oz. bag of frozen mixed vegetables and I did steam them before adding them to the filling. I also added more seasonings as it sounded like it was in need of more.  I added a sprinkling of each of these to the filling and stirred in before putting it into the crust: garlic powder, season salt, shallot pepper,  paprika and thyme. I used a can of chicken broth that was 14.5 oz. I did not have any canned potatoes so did not put any potatoes in. We didn't miss them & we loved it. Simple and so good!

I've made this several times... I add celery along with diced potato & carrots... I make my own ''crust'' & it comes out even better than most Pot Pies you can buy in a restaurant or market!  I use a large 10'' pie pan, so there's always left-overs!!  The ''Chicken Broth'' gives this pot-pie LOTS of flavor... I used dry chicken bullion instead of broth, that's the only change I made..

I have made this recipe several times and it is a favorite in the house.  To "change it up" I am thinking about using smoked chicken, and/or adding a couple of drops of Chipotle Tabasco Sauce.
Even the basic recipe is very good, and my fmaily really enjoys it.

Take !that! Swansons. Take !that! Banquet.
I spiced it up with cayenne pepper, added some leftover cooked rice (1+ cup), and replaced canned with  frozen mixed vegetables. With rice, it didn't need potatoes.

This is a really good recipe and it's easy to make. I cooked the chicken in the crockpot while I was at work so it didn't take long to put this dish together. Next time I think I'll add some cream of chicken soup to give it more sauce, but Ill definitely make it again.

A great pot pie recipe but I had trouble making the pie crust. So instead I use Reames Frozen egg noodles. Make the noodles as directed as well as the pie filling. Mix them together and it's good. Had to delete potatoes because my wife is allergic. It still tastes fine and you can make them separately.

My grandson loves chicken pot pie so I made it for their family.  We all loved it and it was so simple and easy to make.  I used leftover rotisserie chicken.  Only change I would make would be to add a little more milk as it got a little too thick as it cooled.

I used fresh carrots and potatoes which I cubed and parboiled in salted water for about 10 minutes. Then threw in some frozen peas and corn. We prefer freshly ground pepper so I doubled that. It was a tremendous hit!! New family favorite ??

omg...this is delicious! In fact, my husband had three pieces and wanted more. I made a few minor changes, but this recipe stands well on its own. I added a chopped celery stalk to onion, used frozen peas and carrots and added a chicken bouillon to the sauce. I cook the chicken breast rubbed with olive oil in the oven to net more flavor..boiling makes for dry chicken. Can't wait to make this again!

The flavor was awesome.  I had no canned potatoes, so I peeled and diced 2 medium size potatoes and cooked until almost tender..  Because I had no frozen peas on hand, I substituted 1/2 cup of frozen cut green beans.  I added 1/2 cup diced carrots and 1 tsp. minced garlic.                                                   
Because of diet restrictions, I made a buttermilk biscuit recipe and spread it over the top, and baked for 20 minutes.

I couple of weeks ago I made this recipe for my family and it was a 100% hit. It's nice to be able to please them all equally. We take turns cooking and  I am a male cook so when it's my turn it feels good to have such accolades. Thank you for posting this recipe, I am doing it again tonight by popular demand.

Also chopped up some celery  and cooked that with the onions. I had some  leftover potatoes and  some steamed carrots. I had a half a can of condensed milk in the fridge, so used that instead of the milk, adding extra broth. Put some Penzy " Sunny Paris" for seasoning- - it is delicious!

Definitely a family hit. Will make many times. So easy and So good. I added short cut canned green beans, a cream style corn, a Mexican corn and chopped the potatoes into smaller pieces. I didn't have any peas and carrots so eliminated those and just added peas. Didn't have canned broth so used water and bouillon. Feeding 7 I needed to oomph it up a bit.  You can basically just use whatever you have with the basic recipe which makes it great!

I've used this recipe a so many times now. It is AMAZING! I usually make this the day after I cook a whole chicken and have leftover chicken meat. I too made a few alterations. For the most part, I follow this recipe to a T. However, I don't add the milk at all. Instead, I use a can of cream of chicken. I still use the same amount of chicken broth but gradually add it in as it thickens. Also I add a garlic and herb mixture like "Perfect Pinch, Salt Free Garlic & Herb" blend. It comes out with lots of flavor and my husband has said it's better than his mother's and grandmother's!!! Love love love this recipe!

I made the recipe exactly with 2 exceptions. I used frozen mixed vegetables instead of the canned, and I omitted the potatoes entirely.  Before baking I prepped the pie crust with some egg wash. It smelled so good that it was almost agony to have to wait the extra 15 minutes. I will definitely make this again.

Wow!  I made this and changed the recipe just a bit to accommodate what I had already.  Instead of milk I used whipping cream  I did use 1/3 more broth to offset the cream.  OMG!!  I also didn't have any canned veggies so I used 1/2 of a bag of frozen ones.  I boiled them first then drained.  It was a hit.

I made a couple of changes like using homemade spelt pie crust which was pretty good since this was the first time I've made a spelt pie crust recipe. The filling was good but I had to add a bit more salt, pepper and also a few shakes of garlic powder to the  filling. Additionally, I ended up making enough filling for 2 pies. I also used some spelt flour to help thicken the gravy of the filling as I thought that I had made it too liquid. It worked perfectly and the end result was I loved the taste of the filling.

This was the first chicken pie I have ever made and it was delicious! I used cooked potatoes because I had some (instead of canned), and I made my crust from scratch, as I don't like pre-made .

I made this as a crust less dish. Absolutely AMAZING and easy. It was just too hot a day, at the time, to use the oven and we had a craving for it. I added celery, left out potatoes (ran out) and made Ritz crackers a dipping option in place of the crust. Loved it so much I made it twice in one week. Thank you for this recipe. It was a life saver and so much healthier than any of the frozen dinner versions.

Very easy. I made three small 6" pies. So I could freeze a couple for future dinners. I also added about 1/2 tsp Old Bay seasoning.

I used left over turkey, bone broth instead of chicken stock, and didn't include potatoes because I didn't have any on hand. No disappointments here. It was so easy and delicious, I'm sure I'll be making it again and again!

Great basic recipe, easy!  I did add a bunch of fresh thyme and a bit of chopped celery (for more texture) to the butter and onions before proceeding with the roux.  Additionally, I thawed a small bag of frozen veggies instead of canned.  It turned out to be the best pot pie I've ever eaten!

Will definitely keep this in the repertoire. I used diced yukon golds instead of canned potatoes and thawed frozen peas instead of canned. Also added diced carrots. Instead of baking in a pie crust, I baked the filling in a casserole dish then separately baked puff pastry squares. To serve, I placed a few ladles of filling on a plate then topped it with a square of puff pastry.

So many recipes for chicken pot pie!  Which to choose??  My preference is that a recipe not use prepared foods like condensed soup.  Then I look for simplicity, 'cause I'm lazy (LOL).  Pretty much stuck to the recipe here, except: only used pie crust on top (don't need the additional carbs), and used frozen veggies.  Also seasoned according personal preference.  Timing and proportions were perfect per recipe.  Thanks for posting.

Was Delicious! All my family raved about it! I made a few adjustments: I used fresh carrots and celery and frozen peas to amount to the vegetables that are in a can, and skipped the potatoes. I swapped out 1/4 a cup of milk and 1/4 a cup of the chicken broth for 1/2 cup of cream of chicken condensed soup. To make up for the potatoes I added more chicken, and I shredded my chicken instead of cubing it. Great recipe! Will make again!

This recipe is awesome! Just like the name, it is mom's chicken pot pie! I made a couple changes that include leaving out the potatoes because my 6 year old doesn't like them and she's part Irish, go figure! I used bagged carrots peeled and cut and frozen peas. I measured the butter, flour and onion as the recipe indicated. My little family of three loved it! It tastes just like my mom would make it, I couldn't believe it! Very quick recipe which makes for a happy mamma! I am keeping this one in my recipe box both online and on the counter. Thank you for sharing this!!

Nice and easy, but I don't add the potatoes.  Also great for freezer meal....pre make everything but don't bake it, and when you're ready just pop it in the oven for about an hour.

This was a fantastic pot pie!!  We loved it and it really hit the spot.  Made my own pastry, and added celery, used fresh potatoes that I pre boiled and fresh carrots and peas.  Cooked the carrots ahead of time as well.  Really good though and the sauce ratio was good :)  Thanks!

A very tasty pot pie and a hit with my pot pie lovers.  This was excellent and easy, even when I made my own crust and it stands up nicely to the addition of other veg you might have leftover, which I've always thought was the purpose of such recipes.  Everyone loved it and would have eaten more after they scarfed down seconds and then cleaned up the dish.

This is a great comfort food recipe, but remember the key ingredient:  your glasses.  I made the pie with fresh everything, half veg/half chicken low-sodium stock, added peas, thyme & sage.  Beautiful.  Amazing aromas!

This is a really amazing pot pie! I absolutely love it. I slightly overcooked the filling so it was a little dry, but that doesn't change the rating because that was my error. It does take some time to put the ingredients together, and my favorite part of this recipe is that there isn't any celery!! When I make this, the fragrance lingers until the next day and the smell is absolutely amazing.

I made this following the recipe exactly. I used Marie Callendar refrigerated pie crust. It came out wonderfully. The only thing I would do differently next time is add more seasoning. Garlic powder, Greek seasoning, maybe paprika. Will definitely make again!

I've been making this recipe for over a year now and it has become a regular in our house.  I love how versatile it is - you can use any veggies, fresh or frozen, and I especially like that it makes its own gravy.  Way better than store bought gravy.  Not too hard to make and comes out delicious!

Great recipe!  Everyone always loves it and asks for the recipe which I gladly share.  I fry the chicken in coconut oil, then use the same skillet for the butter and onion.  Makes it even more tasty!

This may be simple but it comes out perfect every time! I used frozen mixed veggies and frozen southern style hashbrowns to save time. My husband said it's the best one he's ever had. It's a huge hit with the kids too!

Loved this recipe! Only change was I added 1/2 cup celery and 1/4 tsp poultry seasoning. Also used half and half cream instead of milk and fresh potatoes, carrots, peas and pastry.   Very yummy will make again!!

Substituted chicken bullion for cream of chicken soup, halved the amount of flour and used fresh, diced new potatoes instead of canned. My husband loved it so much he hurt himself over indulging. Will definitely do again, but would like to make my own crust next time.

The only thing I changed was using a 1/2 bag if mixed vegetables  instead of the carrots and peas in a can.  I would love to have this more often but can't because of the lard in the crust. Good stuff.

Super easy.  We added a can of cream of chicken soup and eliminated the milk and half the flour.   Used diced potatoes that we microwaved rather than canned potatoes.  These changes were great and we used stuff on hand.

It was delicious, comes out perfect if you follow the instructions.  It reminds me of the pot pies that were made when I was growing up. Next time I may add some celery and a little poultry seasoning  or not...

Excellent - would get a 5 star rating if you used homemade pie crust.   Yes on occasion I will cheat and buy the pre-made  but it is so much better with the real stuff.  And it's not that hard to make.

This recipe is fantastic! I made two versions, one with and one without chicken for vegetarians in my family and both were great. Had requests from my husband to make it again the night I served it. The only thing I changed was making a homemade pie crust. They're so easy and taste so much better than the store bought! Also, I froze it before serving and it still came out wonderfully. Just fully defrosted and heated until warmed through, so could make a good meal to take to someone after the birth of a baby, etc.

If you like a saucier pie, just add a little more chicken broth, I love the veggies, so I added more of them. Great and easy recipe all around!

I thought this would make a good, simple dinner on a cold winter night and it did not disappoint. It isn't going to be the best pot pie you have ever had, but for the small amount of effort that you will put into it, you will get back a decent dinner.

This is the best chicken pot pie! Brush egg over the top for a golden brown crust, other than that don't change a thing.

Very good!  I'd like to give it 4.5 stars for my first attempt at making it.  Very easy to make, with ingredients that I'd likely have on hand at any time.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I'll definitely be making this again, but with a few minor modifications, such as chicken stock instead of the low sodium broth that I used - flavor could be a little more bold.  I'll also be using frozen veg (peas, carrots and some corn), and adding a little celery.  I used sliced canned new potatoes instead of whole and they cooked up just fine.  I used disposable pie tins but couldn't find deep dish tins, and it definitely needs them.  I really liked this pot pie and will be making it for family next time they visit.

EXCELLENT!!! I followed @emmabambi and omitted the milk and chicken broth.   I added 1 can Campbell's creamy chicken soup and 1 can of water.  I used left over Thanksgiving turkey instead of chicken and it was DELICIOUS! For my husband and both kids to eat this and rave about it - you know its good.  Thanks for sharing this recipe

First pot pie attempt and this was a great recipe to start with. Made a few changes - added 1/3 c celery to the onions and I chopped fresh potatoes. I used a Marie calendar pie crust as that was the only one available that day. I should have boiled the potatoes a little bit after cutting but thought the time in the oven would be ok with the small size i had cut them into. they were cooked but not as soft as i would have liked. I also would have used less onion. just a little. The family loved it. the pie was delicious, but thick and stew like.

So good! I will definitely make this again. The only thing I did different is I added a half can of corn and next time I'm going to add more chicken. I baked 2 chicken breast and it only took about 1  and 1/3 of the other chicken breast to make 2 cups so I didn't added the other 2/3 of the one breast but next time I'll just do 2 whole breasts.

Wow!  This was such a great starter recipe. I used frozen mixed veggies and no potatoes but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Was a little scepticle of the 425* cooking temperature, ended up cooking it for around 45 minutes and it turned out beautiful!  Hubby, our friend and I all agree that it was the best we've ever had. Our friend even said 'don't tell my mom'!   I think we're going to have to arm wrestle over the leftovers. True comfort food at its finest.

Rave reviews from my family!!!! I used the rotisserie seasoning recipe from Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style on this site (1/2 the salt and used smoked paprika), coated 3 good sized chicken breasts and cooked over a low flame in a covered skillet with just a little chicken stock. I used fresh carrots (softened in boiling water first as another reviewer suggested), frozen peas, celery, and I added some well chopped broccoli stems because I wanted to use them up. I left out the potatoes. I also brushed the top with an egg wash. This actually made enough for two pies. My teenage daughter  asked me to teach her how to make it so that she can bring it to her "Friend Thanksgiving" :) Thanks for this great recipe!!!

It was very delicious. I added mushrooms and celery along with the peas and carrots and my husband when cooking the chicken added onions, 1 clove garlic, and turmeric to the broth. My husband and I enjoyed it very much.

I've made this a few times now, always a little bit different because I'm just that kind of a gal. I use fresh carrots, blanch so they are cooked a bit and toss in peas. I use small red or Yukon Gold potatoes and dice really small so they cook in time. I added sauteed mushrooms a couple times. Great recipe!

Only addition was celery along with the onions. One of my family's favorite recipes. It was so easy, but tasted like I slaved all day. We have it all the time now.

BONUS there was enough pastry and filling left over from my 9 inch pie dish to make an additional pie to serve 2 more.  Made it as is and it's a keeper.

I used it mainly for the cooking time.  I used fresh onions, mushrooms, carrots, broccoli and chicken.  I precooked these ingredients. I made a sauce with chicken stock thickened with seasoned flour.  It had sage and salt.   After it thickened I used a bit of milk.  I used less sauce than this recipe but it was just right for us.  I used Pie Crust III and added some salt to the dough.  it was a flaky crust that was a perfect for this pie.
