Very good and makes a lot. Make sure you have a hungry crowd when you serve this! I usually halve the recipe for our small family dinners. But is excellent for big family get-togethers or potlucks.

I liked this recipe..Made it with red bliss and kept the skins on. I think with bacon and green onions in between the layers it would have tasted just like a loaded baked potato.

I just cooked this recipe and was not too excited! Overall it is very dry and I even added extra sour cream and milk. Also,my husband, who eats EVERYTHING,  just wasn't a fan of this at all. I feel like I wasted so much time for something that just was not worth it.
