Incredibly easy and flavorful! I made changes to suit my fancy: instead of just celery and carrot, I also added chopped white onion and red bell pepper, and the other change was to use a can of mixed stir fry veg instead of just the water chestnuts.  Since we were camping, I followed the skillet directions on the rice package, and to keep our grubby hands off our food, I shredded the lettuce and turned it into rice bowls.  Thanks for the simple and tasty recipe!  Will definitely take this one camping again and again!

Nothing beats a refreshing lettuce wrap on a hot summer night! Made as written except that I whipped up my own stir-fry sauce using a combo of soy sauce, oyster sauce, sherry, cornstarch, sesame oil, and ground pepper. This came together so fast and easy and is perfect for nights you don't have much time to spend in the kitchen. I got distracted chopping the veggies and shredding the carrot and totally spaced out the rice until I thought it was too late. Nope! That is the beauty in Uncle Ben's Ready Rice. A minute and half is all you need. This one is a keeper!

This is really light yet bursting with flavour. I can't find water chestnuts in my area so I used fresh radishes for crunch. These are perfect for a buffet style so everyone controls the amounts they want. Thank you Baking Nana for this recipe. Update 20 June 2015. I've made this three times now and each time it gets better. I've added sliced baby corn and some fresh ginger. Today I used heads of baby romaine and served them as appetisers. It is important to leave the veggies a bit crunchy for that extra bump of flavour. I also have been using chicken breasts sliced super thin instead of ground. Such a versatile recipe!

I asked for easy meal suggestion on the Buzz and this is what we decided on.  It was a massive hit, so easy!  It even got a little easier when we couldn't find the Uncle Bens Jasmine Boxed Rice but found the Uncle Bens Jasmine Rice in a Microwavable packet.  90 Seconds!!!!  Just added some sliced baby corn form a can.  It was so good!  We used Teriyaki Sauce, and put some on the table for those who wanted to drizzle some more on.  Perfect Baking Nana!

This is very good--definite repeat worthy. The only change I made was to add some fresh ginger, and I'm very glad I put that in it. I also put a little more stir fry sauce than called for. DH gave it a 4, but only because he thought it needed some Chinese hot mustard, and he would have liked some cashews or peanuts in it. We're going to make it that way next week!

I really enjoyed how this turned out. Making lettuce wraps is always fun for us. I didn’t change anything save for adding a little more stir fry sauce per my partner’s request (I also left out the water chestnuts because they gross me out). My teenagers weren’t huge fans, but the adults loved it.

Family loved it!

  Fairly quick to make and family loved it. Was fun to make as well. I'm not a real good cook but like to try different recipes from time to time and this one was great!

Used this as a basic recipe. Into the lettuce cups I added 1tbs cooked rice then juliened carrots with slivered green onion. cooked 2half boneless chicken breasts . Added 3/4 cup sweet thai chili sauce and simmered the chicken in the sauce 15 min. Divided the chicken into the lettuce and it was a big hit for a salad alternative.

As a whole this was a very delicious and simple recipe. The only change that I made was switching out the ready made jasmine rice with an uncooked version boiled in chicken broth to help bring the flavor of the ground chicken to life.

Very good, would suggest adding ginger. I have two guys I live with who will only eat veggies if I trick them into it, so instead of letting them make their own wraps I shredded the lettuce and mixed it and the rice in with the chicken mixture. The recipe also makes a large amount of food, and I actually had leftovers, which rarely happens.

I used ground turkey instead of chicken, and added sliced red and green pepper. I had never had the Jasmine rice before--it was easy and  tasty! I served it all on the lettuce and topped it with some cashews. Super quick and delish!!

I used ground turkey instead of chicken.  I added mushrooms and a little ginger and used East-West Sizzling Stir-Fry Sauce from City Market.  It was delicious.

This was very simple to make but very bland on taste. We added a little soy sauce and pepper and loved them. Next time I will add some spices to the burger to open up the taste.

It was absolutely delicious and my husband said it's his favorite meal as I made the lettuce wraps very large and filled them with a heaping scoop of the rice and chicken filling to make it our dinner entrée. However, I did add fresh ginger and some extra vegetables .   I also needed to add more sauce and that would be my only suggestion –  use extra sauce or possibly marinade the chicken prior to keep it juicy. Lastly, I sliced an avocado & roasted crushed almonds  to really top it off!    Super healthy and extremely satisfying!
