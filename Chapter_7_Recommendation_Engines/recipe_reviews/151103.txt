This is a sure 'fire' fix for anything bland. As a lover of spicy heat I left the seeds and membranes in the habanero peppers for that extra punch. For those that don't care for the heat just mix up a batch and toss it on a couple of logs in your fireplace, no matches required.

I Love this recipe.  I wanted something hot, so I left the seeds in.  It turned out amazing.  I add about half a tsp to almost any dish to give it a good kick.  Works great in soups and chili.  Definitely going to try substituting different peppers to get various flavors and levels.

I really liked this relish, the horseradish gives it such a unique flavour. I used it immediately on an omelet and then added it to a tomato salad. Anywhere you put it, it steals the show. I only had 4 peppers so I had to scale the recipe accordingly. I made one little batch with the seeds and membranes and one without just to test it. Both are delicious but with seeds it numbs the lips and burns everything else. Pretty darn hot, but good. Thanks for the recipe. :-)

Also, sugar plain sugar eases the burn.
