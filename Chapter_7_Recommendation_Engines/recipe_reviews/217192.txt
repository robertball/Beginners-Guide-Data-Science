This is a great basic recipe that can be easily customized to what you have on hand.  I used KRAFT Greek Vinaigrette dressing and a slice of lacy swiss cheese instead for each sandwich and they were very good.

I dislike rating recipes low, but I did not care for this. The name sounds terrific, but it is time consuming, dirties a lot of dishes, and taste rather bland and dry. I used thinly sliced chicken breast. There was no way all of the vegetables would have fit on the sandwiches. The ingredients were sliding everywhere. I thought the Tuscan marinade tasted just like Kraft's regular Italian dressing. Maybe, this would be better if the chicken and vegetables were grilled. However, the only thing that reminded me of an Italian flavor was the basil. I could have gotten the same flavor, without all of the mess, from just doing the cheese and basil, I believe.

I did like this recipe although I certainly did change it, not the ingredients but the proportions for sure. I cut the ingredients in half for two sandwiches and very thinly sliced everything. I did double the chopped basil. 
 I marinated the chicken and veggies in the same amount of dressing and then discarded all the remaining dressing.  With this amount of filling it was more like the Panini's my husband and I pick up at the meat market near our apartment in Roma for our 1:00 lunch with a glass of wine.  Next time I'll try it with a better mozzarella...........sorry Kraft!
