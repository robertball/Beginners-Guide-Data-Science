I used to work at a bakery and snickerdoodles were a customer favorite. I could never figure it out because I found those cookies to be dry, flat, and only vaguely cinnamon-y. I tried this recipe because my husband loves snickerdoodles and this was the first one that popped up on my search....And I need search no further. 

These cookies are fabulous. A slight crunch on the outside, a light texture on the inside that literally melts in your mouth. I omitted the almond extract because I detest the flavor, and I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the flour. I also recommend using Saigon cinnamon (I think Spice Island is the brand I use)if you really enjoy a powerful cinnamon flavor.

These cookies are WONDERFUL!!! They beat my other recipe hands down! They are moist with a wonderful taste and texture. My whole family loves them. My husband brought some to work, and there were requests for more.  By the way, I didn't have any almond extract, so I just made them with the vanilla extract.  I'm looking forward to trying them with the addition of almond extract.  ****Following up 6 years later to say I did make them with the almond extract the next time, and the time after that, and the time after that....This is my most highly requested cookie recipe.  The real secret is to take them out when they look not quite done.  They will cook as they sit outside the oven on the cookie sheet, and will be crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.

I didn't like these cookies at all.The almond extract was very overpowering.Mrs. Sigg's Snickerdoodle recipe from this site has a much better flavor and looks picture perfect!

This is by far the best snickerdoodle recipe I have ever tasted!!  I will continue to make this recipe over and over.  One hint, flatten the cookie dough out a bit before putting in the oven.

I really enjoyed these cookies. My mom always made these cookies but I must say, mine have a little extra crunch on the outside and softness in the inside.. I doubled the recipe and had no problems!!

I made one of the other highly rated Snickerdoodle recipes last week; they were hard and just OK. My sister called them hockey pucks. ;-)
Yesterday I tried this recipe; it is excellent!! I eliminated the almond extract, and I like smaller cookies, so I rolled smaller balls, they were soft and just so delish!!
I'm wondering the origin of the name.

These are terrible.
I followed this recipe exactly, my 13 year old daughter will testify to that, since she helped me, and for the life of me, I don't know how a 5 star rating came about on this cookie.  They were so awful.  I mean BAD.  Perhaps the almond extract makes them even worse, but this cookie had a hard doughy taste without much taste of anything else. Since it called for a 2 hour chill, I not only wasted ingredients, but time.

These were good and my family loved them...I was not too impressed.  They were not as good as I remembered from my childhood.  Not spicy enough.  I will make these again, but next time I will use more spice.  Also, I rolled mine in SMALL balls, sugared them, then made them flat with the back of a spoon. The texture was GREAT!  Thanx

A perfect cookie!  Very tasty, simple, and a lovely light texture.  My whole family loves these cookies and I always keep some dough in my freezer in case company stops by.  They are similar to a really good sugar cookie, but the Cream of Tartar and cinnamon/sugar topping puts these over-the-top.  Thanks for this ticket to YummyVille!

These were very good cookies. The recipe made way too many cookies then I need though. It became a big waste. Also You can really taste the almond extract. next time i make them i may put less.

AMAZING FLAVOR!  The almond extract makes all the difference in this cookie. I followed this recipe almost exactly, only adding a bit of nutmeg to the batter, and they turned out perfect!!! My kids and husband LOVE snickerdoodles and love the crunch around the edges and the soft chewy inside. Will make again!

Not very good. Had a very doughy/ floury aftertaste. Did not flatten into cookies. Bad taste. More like Almond EXTRACT cookies. Even my boyfriend's friends who will eat anything off the floor left untouched.

This recipe was so easy and the cookies were fabulous. Slightly crispy on the outside and so light and fluffy inside. I did make a few changes of my own that worked out really well. I replaced 3/4 cup flour with whole wheat flour, added a full tsp of the cream of tarter and replaced 1/2 cup of the sugar for powdered sugar. Chilled for just over an hour and found it was easier to roll them into balls with my hands a little floured. I also flattened them just a little on the baking sheet before baking. In my oven the 8 minutes was just a minute too long, so 7 was perfect. So happy I found this recipe and will be making a bigger batch to package up as thank you gifts for the holidays.

I did not care for this recipe.  No flavor, doughy texture.  Nothing like a snickerdoodle.

I love these cookies, and so did everyone I shared them with.  I sent 2/3 of the batch overseas to my husband in Iraq, and took 1/3 in to my coworkers.  They were the first cookies gone of the 3 types I brought, and the soldiers are loving them too!  I'm not sure what went wrong for others, but the dough was easy to roll into balls and in the cinnamon sugar mixture for me--not too sticky at all.  I put them in the refrigerator for between 1 and 2 hours, and followed the recipe exactly.

I give this recipe a FIVE star. In the beginning, I have to say I had my doubt the way the dough turned out. When I trusted in all those good reviews and tried it out. They turned out to be the best thing. Crunchy and yet moist at the same time. Absolutely love these. Now, I have to figure out how I can restrain myself from eating them all.

This cookie is ok . Not oustanding . I can taste the flour al ittle and the brown sugar clumps when you make hte sugar mixture . I had to sift it for it to blend wiht hte white sugar and cinnamon . Also it took 15 minutes to cook not 8 and they didn't flatten well . Also the top didn't crack like a snickerdoodle should .  I think i might look for a different recipe .

I made one batch of these and they were nothing like snickerdoodles should be.putting milk in the dough made them more like cake than cookies.you should never put water or milk in a cookie dough recipe unless you want cakey cookies.omit the milk and the recipe is fine.

Oh, Tanya Girl, you have got a winner with these awesome cookies.  I have used this recipe for the past few years and my list of " Please, bake some extra for me, pleeeeze???" continues to expand.  In fact I am making some in the next couple of days for a friend.
I challange anyone to find a better SNICKERDOODLE recipe, anywhere!

These are horrible.  They do not cook properly, now I understand the crunchy outside chewy inside remarks.  Not a good thing. I baked each sheet seperately at varied lengths trying to find away to save the cookies but I know these will not be eaten.

Excellent cookie.  A little crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I made them into ice cream scoop size balls and baked them for 16 minutes.  Important that you chill dough for at least 2 hours as the dough "is" a little sticky to work with -but worth it.

Very good cookie...only thing I'll do different next time is to omit the almond extract. (was a bit too strong for me). But the cookies baked up very nicely and stayed soft for the couple of days that they lasted.

I loved these cookies!  Didn't add the almond extract due to me not having any but totally would have loved that in there, too.  Soft and fluffy texture that is just delicious.

A delicious cookie with a cup of coffee! Worth making, but gave it 4 stars because it needs a touch more flavor. THe addition of vanilla and almond is a must! I put 1 tsp of cinnamon in the dough but I'd venture to put much more in next time.

I used half white sugar and half brown sugar in the cookies, and I didn't chill the dough.  
My family said they were incredibly delicious -- and I watched as the cookies disappeared right before my eyes. :)
Five stars.

I followed the recipe to the T.  After baking, the cookies still tasted like dough/flour.  Also, the mixture was too sticky.  I had to wash my hands after handling the mixture every few cookies in order to get the excess off of my hands -- it got so sticky that I couldn't roll the dough into balls. Also, not a single complement on the cookies at Christmas.  I wouldn't make them again.

I didn't sift the dry ingredients and I didn't let it chill at all. I also added a little extra cinnamon and sugar to the mixture I rolled the dough in. They came out soft and chewy a bit which is exactly what I was hoping for. After I put the dough on the cookie sheet I pressed it down a bit. They were delicious.

These cookies were a hit this Christmas!  Super yummy, soft and chewy, a new favorite in our family!     I added a heaping teaspoonful of cinnamon to the flour for a stronger cinnamon flavor and left out the almond extract.  I'll be making these for years to come!

This Recipe is wonderful. I was bored the other day and decided I wanted to bake. I had all the ingredients for this cookie in my pantry. It is just wonderful. It made a ton of cookies. And my husband is scarfing them down by handfuls. This is the best snickerdoodle recipe we have had yet!

Really good basic receipe, good flavor and texture- smells like home! I liked this one especially because it doesn't need shortening, which I had run out of and therefore didn't have to run to the store before I got these made for my daughter's college dorm visit.

I loved these cookies.  The almond flavor was great, the texture was soft on the inside, a little crispy on the outside.  The search is over, this is the snickerdoodle recipe for me.

Made them as directed except I added colored sugar to the roll-in sugars.  They were easy to make and they taste great!  I increased the baking time to 12 minutes, as that suited my oven bestter.

Oh, my this is by far the BEST recipe for snickerdoodles!  For those who didn't put the almond extract in, it is truly your loss.  That is the magic in these cookies.  They taste better than any store bakery cookie and the texture is divine.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

Mmmmm...yummy! I wanted some easy Christmas cookies to give out, and these were perfect! To make them look more Christmas- like, I rolled them in green, red, and white sprinkles, and then followed by the cinnamon/sugar mixture. My kids kept gobbling them up, I was afraid I wouldn't have enough to give out!!

I loved these cookies. By far the best recipe I’ve tried. I baked them for a school bake sale, and they sold like hotcakes! I halved the almond extract to 1/4 teaspoon, and it really helped the snickerdoodle flavor pop, and wasn’t over-powering. Next time though, I’d add more cinnamon to the rolling mixture.

Absolutely delicious! Slightly crunchy on the outside, but nice and soft on the inside. Good flavor too. I left out the almond extract (per other users suggestions), and I cooked them for around 11 minutes instead of 8, but I love them!

TIP for squishing the cookies: My mother always used to grease the bottom of a water glass and use that to squish them down.  I did that and it worked well - then you don't get the fork impressions. This cookie was the best recipe ever.  I loved it.  I took it to my son's school party and the teachers and parents all took some home.  My husband ate about 30 in 2 days.  I DID change the almond extract to 1/8 of what it asks for.  I used the original 50 servings instead of the 25 it has been changed to and I WAS worried my little mixer would blow the motor. It is a very thick dough and if you just have a regular home mixer you might want to do only 25 at a time.

I have made these several times and they are a great cookie in my opinion.  My husband took them to work, I made them for a cookie exchange, and my daughter sold them at the bake sale.  Her teacher made so many comments.  I have been asked for the receipe several times.  The cookie is harder on the outside (a touch) and cake like on the inside.  My husband prefers his cookies this way.  I will admit...I did make a mistake the first time I made them...I added a tbl of almond extract instead of a teaspoon. Oops. However, if you like the almond taste (as we do) I actually preferred it this way.  I continue to put in the tablespoon :)  I guess it is more of an almond cookie than a snickerdoodle, but I love them. :)

I took these to a baby shower, and everybody LOVED them! They're so light and fluffy! I omitted the almond extract and added some cinnamon to the batter. I also added a tsp of vinegar in place of the cream of tartar. Wonderful recipe!

This was the first time making snickerdoodles, but they are one o the few cookies I enjoy.  I softened the butter and did everything that was stated.    The dough was pretty sticky, but got firm in the freezer enough to form a ball.  I made the balls somewhat flat, but next time I will leave them as balls to make the cookies more puffy.  I left out the almond extract because I didn't have any, and I would think it would mess with the delicate flavors.      All in all great cookie, but make sure you do NOT overcook them!  Also, put a piece of bread /apple in the bag/jar that you store them in to keep the cookies soft!

Thank you, Tanya!  Possible the best snickerdoodle I have ever tasted.  I think the almond extract gives the cookie's flavor a subtle nuance.  I froze half the batch after rolling in the cinnamon-sugar mixture.  We baked some of the frozen ones today and they took a few extra minutes, but were excellent.

Not my favorite Snickerdoodle recipe. Consistancy is more like a scone or heavy biscuit. They are great to serve with tea. I have made many cookies and was sure to follow directions exactly. Not terrible, just not very good.

Believe it or not, I've never had snickerdoodles before!  I think these may be my favourite cookie!  I wasn't sure how they would turn out since I'm in the UK, however, someone told me to use strong flour and not just plain and this may have been the key to how great my cookies turned out.  These looked gorgeous when they came out of the oven.  I plan to use these in my christmas cookie baskets.  Yum!

This maked the best Snickerdoodle ever! Even my Mom liked them, she asked what did do, then asked for the recipe. Since Snickerdoodles are not her favorite cookie what a compliment. This is a keeper perfect every time. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was an excellent recipe. I added a little cinnamon to the batter, but also found that I need to add more flour next time. The dough was very sticky and soft even after refrigerating it for a couple of hours.

These are the best snickerdoodles ever! They are the perfect blend of chewy and crispy, cinnamony and sweet. Absolutely fantastic!
I replace the almond extract with extra vanilla and they still taste great!

My family has been making these for a while. The recent batch we made was on christmas eve. We decorated them by rolling the dough in red and green colored sugar. Also, I got incredibly frustrated and tired with sifting so I decided to skip the step and see how they would turn out. The result was a flatter, chewy cookie which appealed even better to myself because I don't fancy cakey fluffy cookies. I give this recipe a four because if you actually follow the recipe with the sifting they bake up that cakey way. Also, they dry out incredibly too fast in my opinion, which makes them good only a few days after being baked.

I wanted to like these cookies, but was disappointed.  They are very Blah...and I wish I hadn't used the almond extract as it overpowered the cookies.  I won't make them again because they didn't go over well with my family.

These cookies are good, but a bit hard to handle when making. I kept the batter in the freezer as some had suggested and that works. Thanks for a great tasting cookie ... i did add more cinnamon and take out the almond extract.

Simply the BEST snickerdoodle recipe I've tried!  I made it exactly as stated and it was fabulous.  The almond flavor is just enough to give it a special zing!  I did keep the dough in the freezer between baking batches and that helped to make the dough more manageable.  All in all, one of my favorite cookies ever!

These are absolutely the BEST snickerdoodles I have ever had, store-bought or homemade!  The recipe makes a ton of cookies, but after sharing with my son's teachers (and eating plenty at home), they lasted about 24 hours.  The brown sugar in the coating is key - it gives an extra delicious crunch.  I am about to make a second batch now!

I must say that the end result was good, much sweeter than Snickerdoodles I've made in the past.  But, I found the dough hard to work with.  I chilled it first, but found I had to keep chilling the remaining dough between batches, as it softened that quickly.  Good cookie, but I think I'll keep looking...

I liked the cookie but it could have had some spice added to the recipe and I did change to all vanilla extract just because my husband doesn't like Almond and as suggested by someone else I flattened mine a bit. Next time I'd like to roll them in Christmas colored sugars and cinnamon

I just made it for the second time and it turned out awful! The first time I made them last year, they were amazing. I did some searching and somehow this recipe was changed. The first item of sugar should be 2 cups of sugar, not 3 tbls.

These cookies were terrific!! I am an avid chocolate chip cookie lover but these may steal their place! They were easy to make and with no nasty shortening, like most snicker doodles. I chilled over night instead of two hours and cooked for about 10-15 minutes. My family likes a softer cookie so I didn't allow them to brown on the edges. They were outstanding

Followed recipe with exception of almond extract (didn't have any).  I love the fact that it is made with real butter.  Tasty; however, next time I will flatten cookies before cooking as we like them flat and mine came out in balls still.

This was the absolute best Snickerdoodle recipe I have ever used! I did change the temp and time slightly since I have a gas oven and they tend to run a bit hotter. If you have gas try 350 degrees for 10 minutes. But wow are these good! Also, some of the comments I saw for this said the cookies don't expand. Try lightly pressing them prior to baking.

I made this recipe for 1 of my choices for a cookie exchange that I participated in. This snickerdoodle was good, but I was disappointed in the height of the baked cookie.  The flavor was good, but I probably won’t be making this one again next year.

Yes, this has a little spin on Snickerdoodles with the almond extract and even the amount of vanilla, but I think that is why I can't stay away from them.  I took them to a Christmas party and got rave reviews with people wanting the recipe.  Do be careful not to under bake or over bake these. Time may depend on your oven.  Add some colored sugar to the mixture you role them in to add some festivity.

These were hands down the best snickerdoodles I have made! I didn't use the almond extract or cream of tarter b/c I didn't have either one. I also accidently used baking powder instead of the soda. I don't think it affected the flavor. Def. will be making again!

Made for a classroom event, omitted almond oil due to allergy concerns. Turned out pretty good if a little bland for me- should be good for the kids. I did not flatten the dough before putting in the oven because I like my homemade cookies to have that little "puff" in the center. Baking for 8-9 minutes left the centers too uncooked for my taste. 12 minutes in the oven and they were slightly crispy on the outside, and soft but cooked through in the middle.

Awesome cookie - chewy in the middle.  Kids love them.  High altitude changes (4800 feet) I made were to add 1/4 c. flour and a tad less sugar and bake 1-2 minutes longer.

These were excellent.  The only change I made, because I did not have almond extract, and to avoid having a hidden ingredient that could cause problems for those with nut allergies,  I used 1 teaspoon of maple extract instead.  I had purchased a pre-fab refrigerated snickerdoodle cookie dough, where you break them apart into squares and bake them.  I was so disappointed with the taste after I baked them, that I decided to make them from scratch.  I was not disappointed with this recipe.  It is easy and they come out great.

These are the best Snickerdoodle cookies I have ever had.  They were light and fluffy.  The coating was perfect! (I did use more than recommended.)  I can't wait to share these with everyone I know.  As my husband said it was like biting into a cinnamon covered cloud. :)

I would give this a five but without the almond extract. They do come out nicely crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I baked them on parchment paper and the bottoms were nice and didn't stick to the pan. Also when they came out of the oven, I sprinkled a little extra topping on them while they were hot and it gave a little extra crunch to it. I agree with the other reviewer too that pushing the balls down a little gives a fuller cookie. Also you don't need to refrigerate the dough for 2-3 hours. Thirty minutes is sufficient.

I never really liked Snickerdoodles. They always seemed like bland cinnamon sugar cookies.   For Father's Day this year I decided to make some for my dad since theyre one of his favorites. So I found this one and thought I would give it a whirl. I made my dough late in the evening so I just let it sit in the fridge overnight.   While I was making them, between my hubby and I, we probably ate ten. They were delicious! They were so good, that my dad only got a few because everyone at our family BBQ for Fathers Day kept coming back for more. They were gone in less than an hour! I did half the Almond extract and put 1 tsp of cinnamon in my flour though and had to make another batch of the coating because that wasnt enough.  So Im baffled as to where all the negative reviews for these are coming from. In a big family of picky eaters, for these cookies to have gone over so well they have to be good!   Also, I had lost this recipe and wanted to make them again, but I couldnt remember the name, only the picture that was on the site. I almost got a different recipe thinking it was this one because the picture that came up when I searched for them threw me off! Thank goodness I noticed that one didnt use almond extract.   But most importantly, these cookies are amazing, and you must have done something wrong on the recipe to not like them. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!  :)

These cookies are awesome! The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is because I tried baking them both on a pizza stone and on a baking sheet. The baking sheet ones came out with overdone bottoms and underdone tops. But the ones done on the stone are prefect! Also, I substituted the almond with butter extract, because I was out of almond. Yum! Will definitely make these again - only on the pizza stone, though!

Yummy!  This was my first time ever making snickerdoodles and they were super easy and very good!  Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside.  The dough is a little sticky so that is my only complaint.

Recipe is good!!!  Cookies come out soft and yummy.   I'm not too sure about the chilling... it didn't seem to make much difference as far as stiffening the batter enough to roll them into balls.   The batter was still sticky...  next time I plan on just scooping like normal cookies, and not bothering with the rolling.   Also, rolling the batter into the topping was pretty messy as well.   It would be much easier/ prettier to just sprinkle the topping on, again like normal.   This recipe is a keeper though!

Yummy! I somehow did not have milk available so I didn't put any milk. It didn't affect the texture too much, but I think it made the almond extract flavoring really obviously strong. Next time, I will add the milk but use less (or none) almond extract.

I didn't use the almond extract because my baby doesn't eat nuts yet but these are the best snickerdoodles I've ever made.  My whole family loved them.  I also cut the white sugar down to 2/3rds and will try 1/2 of the amt next time.  Excellent recipe!

This was a big hit, and I will make them again.  I did think a bit of nutmeg would be good so I added it to the sugar/cinnamon mixture.  Next time, I think I'll add a bit to the dough.  Maybe an 8th tsp.

My sons and I made these delicious cookies.  I haven't been a fan of snickerdoodles in the past, but these are wonderful!  The almond and vanilla add a wonderful flavor.  They turned out perfectly and my family loved them!  It took 10-11 minutes for these cookies to bake.  I live at sea level so this may be why it took longer.  Putting the dough in the refrigerator for about 1 hour made it easy to work with.  After the cookies have cooled, put them in a covered container to keep them soft.  If you like them crunchy, cover them with wax paper and leave out overnight.  Great recipe!  Enjoy!

Very tasty. I left out the almond extract as well and didn't sift the dry ingredients but the cookies still tasted great. Like everyone else's mine were a little crunchy on the edges and soft inside. I might add a little more brown sugar next time. I didn't really taste it much following the recipe. Also, I added a dash of nutmeg to the batter and it gave it a nice hint of the spice. I recommend this recipe.

I had doubts, but these are perfect, even the next day they're still soft.  I agree.. decrease cream of tartar to 1 teaspoon and use another teaspoon of cinnamon and T of sugar.

My kids love these Snickerdoodles!  I think the almond extract gives them a nice taste.  I like that this recipe doesn't call for shortening.  They do seem crumbly though but I know that's due to the lack of shortening.

Perfect cookie and simple to make. I made them per the recipe and they made 4 dozen. I ran out of the cinnamon/sugar mixture that you roll them in. So I will double that part of the recipe next time.

These were great! So far they ahve been demolished at both home and work, I'm not sure how someone could possibly have got this recipe wrong. I did however leave them in the oven for about 15 minutes, until they were just brown at the edges, and I also added two teaspoons of raw sugar into the cinnamon mix to add a tiny bit more crunch. Definitely a keeper.

Absolutely loved this recipe.  Currently I am living in France and so I was looking for a snickerdoodle recipe that did not call for shortening.  Found this one and made it for about 20 French youth.  Was a great hit!!!

When I was at Penn State there was a restaurant that used to make these and I loved them.  I have never had them since but often thought about them.  These are JUST like the ones I had way back then.  Thanks for a great memory!

Very tasty. I never have almond extract or cream of tartar on hand, so I didn't put those in, and I converted the recipe to 12 servings and rounded off the measurements, because it gets something along the lines of 1/3 cup 2 tbsp 1 tsp of X ingredient. 50 cookies is way too much for 2 people.

This recipe is easy and it makes a ton of cookies - perfect for a holiday cookie exchange. I chill half the dough while I roll the other half, and I've never had trouble with the dough being too sticky. My daughters love to help roll the balls in the sugar. The cookies are delicious and just crisp enough on the outside while soft on the inside.

Very soft and tasty though I omitted the almond extract.  Cooking time was more like 12 min.  My only complaint was that mine did not flatten out much during baking; more like 'lump cookies'.  But delicious!  Kids loved.

Great recipe...even my husband liked it and he's pretty picky when it comes to his cookies. I thought they were going to turn out hard, but after letting them sit in a container for a day, they softened up. Would definitely make again.

Yum!  Thanks!  The only change I made was to roll them in 3 T. sugar and 2 tsp. cinnamon.  Delicious!

The best snickerdoodles I've ever tasted.  I have a small scooper used for scooping cookie dough, and it really helped so that you don't have to handle the sticky dough so much.

These were great!  I did everything as the original says, but used a little less almond extract b/c of other comments.  I think they would have been great with more as well.  Perfect consistency all through.  My coworkers gobbled them up.  A tip to those who find the dough hard to work with: refrigerate dough in 3 or 4 sections (wrapped in plastic), and take out one section at a time when ready to bake!  I would also prepare more of the topping because I ran out towards the end.

This cookie is now a favorite in our house and the middle east. =D They traveled well to Iraq, the troops loved them. My hubby even asked me to make some to greet some of his soldiers that just returned home last week. Baking more now for his return. =D I followed the recipe, except omitting the almond extract, they are GREAT!!!

Wonderful recipe! I've never baked snickerdooles before, and when I looked for one, the reviews convinced me to try it. Followed it exactly, but omitted the almond extract. The dough is definitely sticky, but I think it would detract from the recipe if it was any firmer. I just kept the dough in the freezer between baking. They turned out wonderfully! And it was a hit with my sister, who really doesn't like cinnamon at all! Thanks!

Loved it!  My sister made these today to test them out for Christmas, and I ate at least one cookie for each batch came out of the oven.  The cookies had a great crunch on the outside, and almost as soft as cake on the inside.  We didn't use the almond extract as since we don't really like it, we didn't have it on hand.  Were perfect anyway!  I'll be taking some for my co-workers to try, and this will be a regular Christmas recipe!

I followed the recipe to "T".  They turned out great.  They were extremly light and fluffy.  The dough was a bit hard to work with (it was really sticky), but well worth the effort.  My husband ate so many he got sick, then went back for more!

My friend and I made these yesterday in a day of mass baking, at my husband's request. She doesn't care for cinnamon, and I don't care for almond extract, and both of us -loved- these! They looked like professionally baked cookies, fluffy and soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. Great recipe!

Great Recipe. Bakes a "puffier" cookie. Flavor is wonderful. My kids (and husband) love them. Will definitely make again. Thanks!
