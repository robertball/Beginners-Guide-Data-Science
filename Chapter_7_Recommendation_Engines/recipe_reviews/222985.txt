I had no bbq sauce in the house and needed some for dinner tonight. I chose to make this because it used all common pantry/frig ingredients. Being from Memphis, I just didn't care for the strong mustard taste in this sauce, but I realize that is personal preference.

I thought this tasted pretty good. I used the calculate button and typed in 8 servings and got a good cup of the sauce. The flavors all come together, but it reminds me more of a bbq dip for chicken nuggets or fries then a grilling bbq type sauce. It is kind of like a spicy orange mustard sauce. I liked how quick it is to mix up though, with only using one bowl. It is with such common cupbard staples also. A kid might find this a little too tart or hot I think with the seasonings. However, us adults I am sure will find it fine for dipping chicken, etc.

I searched for a recipe that didn't have brown sugar, because I didn't have any.  I made it exactly as directed.  It was very tasty, just a tad bit vinegary.  If I make it again, I won't use quite as much vinegar, or I will cut back on the mustard.  Otherwise, good recipe and I was proud of myself for having all the ingredients!

Quick, easy and basic - I substituted 1 cup honey mustard, 1/2 cup (packed) brown sugar, 1 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp garlic salt, 1/2 tsp chili powder, and eliminated the cayenne pepper and black pepper. Definitely worth making and very good on pork ribs.

I added no sugar, the ketchup was sweet enough and I cannot stand sweet bbq sauce plus I can't have all that sugar anyway.     I added more vinegar than called for and way less mustard.  I did cook it for an hour to let all the flavors marry. Yum, nice vinegary bbq sauce.

I liked the flavor- it's on the sweet side. I did substitute Splenda for the sugar and I added a bit of hot sauce for a little more kick. It is such a simple sauce to make that I know I will make it often

I made this sauce tonight to go with my boneless pork ribs & it was very good!! I added some hot deli mustard I had in the fridge. That was the only change I made.

I put in 1/2 cup of mustard because that was all I had on hand. It was still good.

This has got a kick. I will probably try brown sugar next time and maybe more of it but I like a sweet sauce.
