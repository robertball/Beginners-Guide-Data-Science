I have to give these a 5 for ease of prep, versatility of recipe, few ingredients, presentation, and taste!  I used a D.H. devil's food mix, and perhaps it was that particular mix, but it tasted just like I made these with Hershey cocoa powder.  There was not one hint of cake mix taste that sometimes can occur with yellow and white mixes.  They present so well with the cracked tops.  The dough is stiff so thanks for the headsup on not mixing with a mixer. I just creamed my shortening and beat in eggs and water with electric mixer then added mix by hand.  The dough is stiff enough that it is very easy to work with especially if using a cookie scoop; just scoop them into the powdered sugar and roll them around; no messy fingers.  I didn't even bother to chill the dough; if pressed for time I don't think it needs to be.  The cracked top looks just like a blacktop highway that has crumbled from an earthquake.  Perhaps that is why they are called this?  I'd not hesitate to put these on a christmas cookie tray they are just that attractive and good.

These are easy.  I used a chocolate cake mix and butter instead of shortening.  They came out picture perfect.  The taste is kind of bland.  Maybe some chocolate chips would jazz them up.

This is a good and easy recipe.  I used a lemon cake mix and the cookies disappeared quickly.   I will make these again and eager to try other flavors.

Great cookies!  I preheated my oven (I assumed I was supposed to) and didn't have any problems.  The batter is VERY thick so definitely use only a spoon to mix it, or be ready to scrap your beaters.  Bake them until the sugar has almost disappeared and they'll be perfect.

i absolutely LOVE this recipe for its ease and its versatility.  I've even used butter instead of shortening, and it came out great!  i've done it with strawberry cake mix for strawberry cookies.  for the chocolate ones, i've even placed some halved andes mints on the top, let it melt, and spread it around for chocolate mint cookies.  it's the best! thanks for the recipe!

VERY simple cookie that packs a lot of punch!  I used a devil's food cake mix and they turned out great!  Only one word of warning: they crumble easily so I would't use them for a cookie exchange.  I did and found that they fell apart much quicker than the other cookies.

These are FANTASTIC! They will still be very soft when you take them out of the oven, but they become less soft as they cool - don't leave them in too long or they'll be hard when they cool. I took 3 dozen to about 15 college students and they were GONE in no time!

I made these the other day and we absolutely loved them!! They are so easy! I didn't chill them at all and they were not hard to handle at ALL. Then after I rolled them into balls I put half of a pecan in the middle of each one, which added even more to the already good cookies. I have never seen such an easy cookie recipe.

I used butter pecan cake mix in this easy, easy recipe and it was great.  Makes a very chewy cookie.  I can't wait to try it with chocolate mix!  There are better homemade cookies, but not this easy...

These are so easy and awesome.  A very chewy cookie with just the perfect sweetness from the extra powder sugar on the outside.  I made these with rainbow chip cake mix...no frosting needed.  The kids can even make these!!

I couldn't believe how easy these cookies were.  I also did not chill the dough.  I used a devil's food cake mix and added in some mini chocolate chips for my husband.  We love these!  ;- )

I just made these cookies this morning and WOW! They are easy and the possibilities are endless with the different combinations you can make. I used DH caramel cake mix added 1 tsp of cinnamon to batter and placed a pecan halve on top as soon as they come out of the oven. I will most definitely be making these again!!! :)

These are spectacular.  Perfect for us poor college students as they are cheap and simple.  Used margarine instead of shortening.  I had no powdered sugar but granulated sugar does the trick.  I have now made these with chocolate fudge, devils food, red velvet (lovely color and taste!), lemon, and orange cake mixes and have yet to be disappointed!

This recipe was my lifesaver this Christmas. I had a couple baking disasters and needed cookies in a hurry. You can't get much easier than this. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was it was kind of bland, I think it needs chocolate chips added and it would be perfect!

very fast and easy cookies.  I did make some changes though.  I doubled the recipe and added about 1 1/2-2 cups of peanutbutter to the mix, about a tbsp of vanilla, I substitued butter for the shortening and 1 cup of chocolate chips.  I made these for work and they loved them!  thanks for the recipe!

Very good! I did NOT use a chocolate cake mix but made it from scratch. I did this by folling a cake recipe and just using the dry ingretents.  The next time i make these i will try a diffrent flavor.

I mixed in white chocolate chips for one batch and peanut butter chips for the second batch. As they came out of the oven I sprinkled Christmas colored sprinkles on top pf them. My hubby migraines to nuts, so I was careful to use another color of sprinkles for the PB ones so he could eat the others freely.  My rating is for the ease of making these.  I used butter like others suggested and added a teaspoon of vanilla, too. Mmmm

I have made these for years. My favorite cake mix is double fudge.  Lemon is second. If you like more zing with lemon like I do, add 1-2 Tb. of lemon zest and add ascorbic acid to the powdered sugar. Start with just a touch, 1/8 t. Sift well. Totally awesome.  If you like an awesome dessert, turn this into a pizza-roll out or pat on a pizza pan ( I prefere stone)to within 1inch of edge. Use the Dble. fudge. Bake for 15 minutes no more. Cream 1-2 8oz pkgs of cream cheese with 2 T of butter, 1/2 c Coco Lopez. Add sifted powdered sugar to a spreadable consistancy. Spread on cooled pizza. Top with coconut and ch. pecans, walnuts or nut of your choice. If you don't want a crisp edge, carefully cut off about 1/2 inch all around and crumble on top.  Enjoy.  My friends love this one. If you like Mounds candy bars this is for you

These are great! Extremely easy, which I love. They're a TAD bland, but I know a lot of people who like things not as sweet as I do, so they still get 5 stars :)

I thought these were great and they came out perfect. And they weren't too sweet. Sometimes chocolate cookies get loaded with all these chocolate chips and i think it makes it just too much.

These were super yummy and very easy for my 7 year old to make with very little help from mommy. We are using them as his entry for his cub scouts cookie bake off. :) I love how I can make them again using any variation of cake mix. Can't wait to try a different flavor! TY for sharing!

These are easy & mess free cookies.  However, I had to bake a couple of extra minutes for a crispier edge and for them to be less gooey in the center.  They look just as pretty as the other photos=)

I used DH Spice Cake mix and rolled them in granulated instead of powdered sugar, and they were delicious!  Just like chewy ginger cookies, but super easy!

Wow so easy to make,  I used walnuts in a chocolate cake mix.  Rolled in normal white sugar and they turned out great!  Can't wait to try another combination.

I made the recipe exactly as indicated.  The cookies were tasty, but a smidge bland.  I think next time I'll use butter instead of shortening, and I'll add mint chips.

Still, this recipe deserves another go round, especially considering how EASY it is.

I was looking for a recipe that used Cherry Chip cake mix. My sister-in-law makes a Cherry Chip cookie that I love the taste of, but I'm not too keen on the texture... they're too soft and bland. This recipe on the other hand is perfect! I get the same flavor because of the cake mix, but these cookies are crispy on the edges and soft in the middle. I am so happy that I found this recipe and I am excited to try it with other cake flavors as well. Thanks!

Yum!  Made a batch of these for Christmas presents...immediately had to make a second batch because the first may not make it out of the house!  Used a small cookie scoop and made 2 1/2 doz.  Baked for 10 minutes.    They stay chewy like brownies.  Easy, easy, easy!

Unbelievably easy. I used a spice cake mix and added more cinnamon, cloves and ginger. Thanks to the person who mentioned beating eggs and shortening before stirring cake mix in with a fork. I highly recommend this.

These were really good. I followed the recipe exactly. I did add 2/3 cup mini chocolate chips as suggested by another person. There can never be too much chocolate! They were good the night I made them but excellent the next day. I baked them exactly 8 min. If this cookie is dry it's because they were baked too long. I would suggest making the day before so flavors can mellow. I stored them in a tin between layers of wax paper NOT plastic wrap or they will get too soft.

These are so yummy. my first batch turned out rather flat, not puffy like the picture, but still very tasty. i added about 1 T. of flour to the dough before making another batch and they turned out puffier and very pretty :) i want to try this recipe with red velvet cake mix!   by the way i highly recommend greasing the cookie sheet..i greased mine and they still stuck a little.

We did not care for this recipe. My husband and I were craving a new recipe for cookies and he stumbled upon this one.  I was skeptical given the simple ingredients but am always up for new tastes and boy was this a mistake!  Maybe it's because I tend to do more complex and yummy recipes, but we did this recipe exactly and changed nothing, we used the same package of Devil's Food and used shortening and did it exactly as this recipe states.  To make matters worse, after a couple days the powder sugar ended up turning a slight green color because of the shortening used in this recipe.  Absolutely unappealing.  Maybe for children to bake this and to eat it's okay, but not for adults with more developed taste buds.

The texture of these cookies is great, I just wish they were more flavorful, maybe next time I will use butter instead of shortening or maybe add some grated chocolate or cocoa. Of course the cake mix itself could also be to blame, I used Pilsbury Devil's Food.

This recipe was extremely easy and the cookies are good too.  I used regular yellow cake mix, I wanted to use sprinkles but had none in the house and the cookies still came out tasty!! Very simple, definitely try this recipe.  Next time I might try cinnamon cake mix!! :)

I used a Red Velvet mix so they came out decorated in a way. How fun to have an Earhquake emerge from my oven!

I used a milk chocolate mix as that was on hand. I scooped the batter with a spoon immediately into the icing sugar and rolled them into 1 1/2" balls. Got 29 large cookies. I took them out after 10 min. when they were still soft ... and YUMMY! A little sweet for me. I would reduce the sugar if they were from     scratch, but they will be loved by the kids.

I have made a similar recipe so many times that I've lost count. I found that if you take the cookies out of the oven, about 1 1/2 minutes before they're done, they are perfect!!! They don't get hard, but instead they stay nice and chewy. I'm looking forward to trying this recipe too! :)

I made this with a lemon cake mix. It was quick and easy to make. I found that I had a lot of powdered sugar left over. Next time I will defiantly roll heavier in powdered sugar, they needed it. Everyone enjoyed, will make again and will try different types of cake mixes.

Easy to make!  I rolled the balls in regular white sugar before rolling in powdered sugar, so the powdered sugar wouldn't disappear after baking.

Last night I made these, tonight the cookie jar is empty.I shall have to double the recipe next time. I just happened to have a box of devil's food mix in the cupboard & thought-Why not try it--  I rolled 1/2 of them in the icing sugar & 1/2 in cinnamon sugar-the cinnamon sugar was liked the best. Also, be it my oven or my altitude, I baked them for 14 minutes as 10 minutes left them raw. I used a heavy duty mixer instead of the spoon & they turned out great- the texture was the same as the picture. Prep time is short & sweet ( 'cept for the scooping and rolling, of course) Very tasty! Will be watching for when cake mix comes on sale & stock up!

these were super easy.  i used devils food and butter.  they came out pretty, but...  they were so bland and tasteless!  they tasted like (or worse) than the frozen cookie mixes you buy at school fundraisers.  maybe i should have used a recipe from scratch.  :(

They looked gorgeous! I used butter instead of shortening.  I also followed other reviewers advice and added a tablespoon of flour.  I also notice if I cooked them a few minutes longer they puffed up.

made this cookie with red velvet cake mix.  i used butter instead of shortening and added white chocolate chips. i didn't chill the first batch, and it was really messy, turning my hands nice and pink. but, while that batch was in the oven, i threw the rest in the fridge and this seemed just cooled enough and was a lot more easily handled. finished product still has remnants of powdered sugar, so maybe i rolled too much. i wouldn't call this recipe "easy", it just has a short list of ingredients, but not bad for using that cake mix that had been lingering in the back of the pantry.

These were good and oh so easy I almost felt guilty. Every chocolate lover in my home loved them . i added about 2/3 of a cup of chocolate chips just to make sure they would. I will definitely make them again especially when i need to have something fast.

very good and simple! I skipped refridgerating the dough and my first batch looked nothing like the photo, no earthquake effect. second batch was in the fridge for 15 minutes and looked great. I do not think an hour is necessary. I also used butter in place of the shortening.

These cookies are awesome! Very easy to prepare and hardly no mess to clean up. I used Betty Crocker's super moist devils food cake mix, butter flavored shortening and mixed with my mixer and did NOT chill. Not sure how others said they were messy and sticky. No mess or stickiness here!!

Delicious!  This was a very easy recipe to make too.  My kids had fun rolling the balls in the sugar.  I used dark chocolate cake mix and butter flavored shortening instead.  I have also tried this with vanilla cake mix for those non-chocolate lovers (although they aren't as cool looking).  I took this to a Christmas party and they were gone in no time.

Wow! These are fantastic.  I used the pkg rainbow cake mix for this and added a bag of smarties.  Excellent cookies to make for a bakesale!! Will definately do these again.  I made another batch with the chocolate cake mix and threw in chocolate chips and didn't bother rolling them in icing sugar...they look good on their own.  Very impressive and easy. :)

After reading some of the reviews, I made mine with the caramal cake mix, I added 2 teaspoons vanilla flavoring, and 1/2 small jar of sugar free caramal icecream topping, put them in the freezer for thirty minutes in a metal bowl that helps keep the mix cool. They were the best cookie ever if you like chewy cookies, so delicious is what everyone said, should have made two batches was gone in a hurry.

Good, easy, and affordable cookie.  Quick and easy to make too.  Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's a little plain.  Almost tastes like a brownie but less dense. On the following batchs I added pecans, and a carmel drizzle and it was much better.

Super easy! Super yummy!  I creamed the shortening and eggs first, then mixed in the cake mix.  I also went heavy on the powdered sugar so it didn't all melt away.  Would definitely  make again.

There are not enough stars for me to rate. I used lemon cake mix and they were to die for, I mean really. My mother in law was here and we could all use extra points lol! I really hope you try it. I think many variations of cake mix could be used. Thanks for the great one!

I love this recipe! My husband loves them. I love that you can play with different flavors. These are great. I add nuts to some. This is a keeper.

Delicious!! This one is definately a keeper! So easy to make, and quick!! Love them.  I added chocolate chips, and sprinkled icing sugar on them after they were baked.  Will definately make again, and try new flavours :)

These cookies are amazing! I made a few changes though. I used butter flavored shortening, a tsp of vanilla and rolled the dough in regular sugar. Rolling the dough in regular sugar gave the cookies a dutch cocoa cookie taste, kinda like the ones you buy in the supermarket.

I made the mistake of mixing the confectioners sugar right in. Didn't realize it until I had it incorporated in the rest. I was concerned about the sweetness, but still baked them and they were wonderful!    Chewy and delicious. I topped them with mini-chocolate chips for presentation and they turned out fabulous. Did take nearly 11 minutes to bake though.

I used a spice cake mix with a cinnamon- powdered sugar coating. Today was a trial session but I can't wait to make some for my family! This recipe is amazing! I love how my first batch disappeared before i could put the second batch into the oven (and there is only one other person home with me tonight..and I only ate 2)

I don't think I'll be making these again; they tasted okay but there are easier cake mix-style cookies and I wasn't a fan of the texture.  The dough is very sticky and hard to work with.

I was shocked that these actually made halfway decent cookies! I used confetti cake mix and they tasted like sugar cookies. They cracked on top just like the chocolate ones and were easy and yummy. They are different from regular cookies because they are just a litttle bit more cakey (shocker there haha) and if you make them too big or cook them too long they can be bland. Take them out before you think they are done and let them cool, they will be chewier. I also did not refrigerate the dough and they were just fine! I don't know that they will replace all my cookie recipes, but they were quick and easy and all disappeared!

Added spices from chili chocolate cookies, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper. Wonderful twist. Not hot. Really brought out chocolate flavor. Try it! So quick and easy.

These were great! I made mine with butter pecan cake mix ( my favorite!) and they were delicious...a great way to make/serve 'cake'. I topped mine with a dollop of buttercream icing and a sugared pecan to dress them up and make them more of a dessert. I do suggest that you watch them very closely while baking! For me, 9min was the magic time. At 8min they were a little under done and flattened out as they cooled and at 10min the bottoms burnt, so I scraped of the bottom and they still tasted fine. Also, the recipe didn't say to grease the pan and my first batch stuck to the bottom, so I suggest you lightly spray your sheet with baking spray.

Summer has just arrived and being the mother of 5 children the oldest being 14 were always doing something. These cookies were very helpful because we could make the batter and go to the pool while it chilled for an hour. When we returned we could bake the cookies and it only takes 10 minutes so the kids and I could eat them as a snack before dinner.

very yummy but it was hard to get the right cook time since the recipe did not say how much batter to use per cookie... most of mine turned crunchy but i think they're supposed to be soft.... still yummy though!

these were sooo easy to make. I made some changes because i didnt have shortening, so in lue of the shortening i omitted the water and used 2 eggs and 1/2 cup veg. oil. i then added 1 cup of chocolate chip cookies. They came out so nice and chewy and amazing. i could have used less veg. oil but i wanted them to be gooey.

I included this recipe in my Christmas Cookie tins for my coworkers and they were a HUGE hit!!  I used red velvet cake mix to keep it fun, and they turned out to be really delicious!  I will definitely make these again!

I took away a star just because they were so gosh-darn difficult to mix.  It advises not to use a mixer but a spoon instead, so I used a big wooden spoon and I was afraid it was going to snap off!  Maybe the shortening could be microwaved a few seconds to loosen it up?  Anyway, it took a good 10 minutes and serious effort to get it combined, but once it was they were super yummy!

Great recipe! I used carrot cake mix with walnuts and shortening, they came out super tasty. Helpful hint use a good amount of powdered sugar as some of my cookies didn't get the desired cracked look.

I didn't think these were great. I would prefer to eat just cake, or else some other type of cookie. These were not moist and delicious as the cake mix would have been if cooked as directed, plus, the shortening makes it even less healthy.

Easy and chocolatey delicious! I thought these were excellent (and I am not a big fan of chocolate cookies.) I used the mixer because hand mixing with a spoon was tiring. Turned out crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside. Just yummy! Reminds me of brownies. Will make again and again.

Not bad - 5* for simplicity, but like someone else said, I have tasted better home made cookies.  However, we took these out to the lake with us for a day, and the kids loved them!  I used a DH Devil's Food mix, and threw in about a cup of milk chocolate chips to jazz them up a bit.

Made with a batch with DH devil's food and another with lemon for a neighborhood cookout. They both came out excellent but the chocolate cookies were eaten much quicker.

Really soft and easy to bake chocolate cookies. I added mini chocolate chips to mine and they were even more delicious. They also keep very well covered at room temperature for quite a number of days. 

The only reasons I wouldn't rate it as "the best" is because it still does taste like boxed cake. I wish there was a way to overpower this taste all together without making the cookies completely from scratch. I suppose that's the price I have to pay for taking a short cut! 

Overall, I'll be making these again.

These were super easy to make.  I used Duncan Hines Lemon Supreme and Pillsbury Strawberry Moist Supreme.  I had to bake the Lemon for 13 minutes and the Strawberry for 15 minutes.  I'm wondering if I didn't use the 1 tablespoon of water as suggested in the original recipe if I could of avoided the extra baking time.  Guess we'll find out when I make them again.

I just made Lemon Poppyseed Earthquake cookies. Really nice and light. I used a lemon cake mix, 2 eggs, 1/3 C of melted butter, 1 T of lemon juice and 1/8 C of poppy seeds. Again I scooped the 1 1/2" balls right into the icing sugar and rolled them. I got 32. This time I had to chill them for awhile. I am famous for my Lemon Poppyseed Cake, so I thought... why not?

A great and easy to make cookie that will look and taste like homemade.  I decided to use black coffee in place of the water, butter instead of shortening, and added about 6 oz of semi-sweet chocolate chips and they were absolutely delicious!  I'd recommend this to anyone in a pinch.  I will definitely make these again!

We LOVE these- make them all the time!  Last night my 3yr old and I made some using yellow cake mix & Easter M&MS (no sugar or water, we use oil instead of shortening).  Super fun!  
For Christmas she made Santa some using red velvet cake mix and we made whoopie pies with buttercream frosting in the midde! Santa LOVED them!

The easiest cookies I have ever made. Big hit at my small group gathering.  Best right out of the oven (of course).  I followed the recipe too a tee expect I take cookies out a little before they are completely done to make them chewy.  Will definitely be making these often.

If you want more chewy or fudge like cookies, bake them for 6-7 minutes. My first batch I baked for 8 and they were dry. I previously rated this recipe with a 3, but now a 4 with this tip. They are very easy to make.

Delicious and packed with flavor!! I used a Spice cake mix (DH) and added 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract. Didn’t chill the dough and rolled immediately in powdered sugar. A huge hit! Easy to make!!

Delicious cookies! I made two different flavors of them. Orange creme and Devils food. The different flavors ended up different consistencies before they were baked. The Orange creme was smoother, thinner, and more sticky. The devils food was very thick and did not stick to my hands when balling.

I made the cookies with little variation. I used a Pampered Chef large scoop (ping pong ball size) and this yielded about 2 dozen cookies. I did stick the dough in the freezer for 1/2 hour after chilling the dough the required hour, and couldn’t really tell a difference from the original dough consistency. I baked them for 12 minutes. Allow them to cool completely once baked, as they are on the soft side. If you like the sweet chocolate taste of brownies as I do, chocolate chips are in order. If you like a not-so-sweet chocolate cookie, you’ll probably like these. I’ll make them again as a quick and easy treat that looks pretty.

My granddaughter and I made this together and it was very easy! Although, she accidentally put in the powdered sugar with the mix! However, it added more flavor and less crispness to the cookie.

These are my family's fave recipe I have. Careful, though not to use a "moist" cake mix, as the dough become too fudgy and difficult to manage, but they still turn out alright. I've found these are really good when you use strawberry cake batter  and toss in miniature chocolate chips, fave so far!

Fantastic! I used spice cake batter. I did add a touch of pumpkin spice in the mix and instead of rolling in confection sugar, I sprinkled a bit of brown sugar on top.

They are super delicious! I didn't give it 5 stars because it IS NOT as easy as everyone says! I am an avid baker and burnt an entire tray. Your balls should be very small because once they heat, they spread like a pancake so also leave more space between them then you'd even think. Make sure you check on them after the 8 minutes! It is very difficult to figure out if these are cooked all the way! Mine seemed undercooked (wiggly) after 8 and I put them in for 2 more and they burned. They will be wiggly!! Try the 8, tops 9 and let them set on the trays for 30 seconds then carefully take them off. I did this the 2nd time around and they were nice and fudgy! I also added about 1/3 C semisweet chocolate chips. Happy baking! :)

The first time I made these cookies, I used a devils food cake mix and shortening (crisco), like the recipe called for. The cookies were soft and yummy, but gave me some indigestion. I'm pretty sure it was from the shortening, as I haven't used crisco in a hundred years. I just made them again, this time with a lemon cake mix, and used organic coconut oil in place of the shortening. I also added the zest of one plump lemon. OMG!!! Scrumptious!  Like the other reviews, I love the ease and versatility of this recipe. I will be making these again and again.

Something different for cookie swaps. The confectionary sugar did burn to bottom. I find sprinkling on after a better option. They are good with or with out. Also they can be moist if you don't over cook or a harder cookie. Either way is great. This is a holiday must at our house. I also use different cake mixes.

Super easy recipe. I used yellow cake mix, rolled the balls in cinnamon and sugar....and made Snickerdoodles. Yum!

I love this recipe!! And I took review advice and use butter instead of shortening and also use a lemon cake mix and all my guests go crazy over them!

This is an OUTSTANDING recipe! My teenage daughters make this one frequently. We use double chocolate bread and muffin mix instead of the cake mix, and I replaced the shortening with a stick of butter, but only because we didn't have the shortening handy! If you haven't tried this, you SHOULD. I can tell you this recipe has worked repeatedly for us and it is a crowd pleaser. We've even sent them to school for a class snack. Don't skip the hour-in-the-fridge step. It's really important!

Great recipe, I think there's more flavor when you use butter instead. I also add a teas of instant coffee for a richer chocolate taste. I added a 1/4 cup of flour as well since my cake mix was only 15.25 not 18.25.  I use my hands to mix as this because it is thick!! Do not over bake these! Quarter sized balls only took 8 minutes at 375°

I made this recipe exactly as written with a twist
Immediately after taking from the oven, place a round thin mint on top of each cookie. Only store these in a sealed container after COMPLETELY COOLED.
Yum Yum delicious!!

Easy, delicious and dairy-free! This came out perfect for a quick dessert for a friend who can't eat dairy, but I think I ate the majority of them because they were just so tasty! :)

I used orange cake mix with mini chocolate chips. Took the tip of another reviewer and assured I took them out when still soft. My four year old was wild over them.

I make these all the time. I made them for a bake sale to raise money for our cheer team and they sold out quick. Strawberry is the favorite.

Mine came out fantastic.  I used shortening as the recipe called for and I didn't have the crumble issue that others seemed to.  I used devil's food cake mix as well.  Mine are pretty moist, but I didn't let them get overly crackly.  They almost taste like brownies... my 5 year old is in love with them as is my 23 year old cousin!

I rated it a 4 mostly because it is very versatile and quick to throw together but also tastes good. I wouldn't say its an astounding experience on your tongue but it is still good. Could do without the powdered sugar on top.
