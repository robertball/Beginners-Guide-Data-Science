Delicious!! Easy to make.  Used too much strawberries in the  glaze and had to keep adding powdered sugar to get the right consistency.  But once the consistency was thick enough, we just dipped the tops of the scones and it was delicious!!!

Very nice flavour.  Made smaller portions for a church tea and it displayed very well.
