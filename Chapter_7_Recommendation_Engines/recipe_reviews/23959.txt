I tried this to accompany Thanksgiving dinner because my family loves mushrooms and bleu cheese.  Only a couple of people liked it, and I wasn't one of them.  The flavor is too tart...perhaps too much white wine vinegar or lemon juice in the recipe, and it left an odd aftertaste.  It took a while to prepare, and I was disappointed with the outcome.  It might go better in a salad or with a different style of a meal, but I didn't care for this recipe.

I have made this recipe several times for holiday parties and it gets scooped up in a HURRY!  I cut the oil to 1/4 cup and use a high quality olive oil. The tangy vinegar is a great combo with the blue cheese.  Try substituting a good quality creamy gorgonzola for the blue cheese.  Gorgonzola is similar but tends to have a bit less bite which is good for people who are leary of blue cheese.

I liked it. A little on the oily side but was good. I would like to know how long this will keep in the fridge?

I used extra virgin olive oil & 3 cloves of garlic, instead of 2.  Also added a chopped red bell pepper, a smallish sweet onion, chopped, and a drained can of pitted black olives.  I followed the recipe for everything else.  I'd definitely make this again.  It was a hit with my family.

This recipe has so much potential!  Delicious as written but think of adding sliced red onions, black olives, broccoli florets - the options are endless!  I used a good Olive Oil and white Champagne Vinegar.  Blended the dressing together with an hand held immersion blender and then stirred in the crumbled blue cheese. I can't believe this has been waiting for a picture for 14 years!  Thanks so much for a great recipe, MICHELLECA.  You have a KEEPER here!
