This is to die for hot cocoa, it really tastes like something from a gourmet coffee/chocolate shop!  I made gift jars for Christmas and called it snowman soup!  I used Coffee-Mate's creamy chocolate powdered creamer, and Wilbur Chocolate's cocoa powder (because I live right outside of Lititz, PA)!  I would suggest that you sift the powdered sugar and cocoa to break up the lumps for a nice powdery consistency.   In addition to the hot cocoa mix, I added a few Wilbur Chocolate Buds, and Hershey Hugs kisses, mini marshmallows, and peppermint sticks to stir it all up!  The presentation was adorable!

This recipe saved me for Valentines Day! The gift i was planning on fell through last minute, so i needed something quick. I found a really adoreable jar at a craft store, and layered the ingredients inside. Because i did it in layers, i added a few ingredients for kicks, two layers of red sprinkles (just around the edje,) two layers of mini marshmellows, and one layer of miniature chocolate chips in the middle. (if you try this, make sure to -pack- down each layer before adding the next one!) I also used vanilla flavored creamer instead of plain for a little more depth. (also because i don't use plain creamer, and didn't want the extra on my shelf!)
It turned out wonderfully! i topped it off with a dash of cinamon and tied a thick red ribbon around the lid. It's adoreable, and he'll love it! i mixed the extra ingrediants for myself and my roommates to enjoy (this recipe makes a TON!) and we love it. thanks!

Absolutely delicious!   Pre-made, store-bought cocoa tastes so bland after drinking this stuff!  I advise using the Wal-Mart store brand chocolate drink mix (generic of Quik) because Quik doesn't give it much flavor... and using chocolate-flavored powdered creamer gives it an extra cocoa boost.

It is without doubt the best I've ever had. I usually won't drink hot cocoa unless it's been whipped through the blender with milk added, but this recipe didn't need all that fuss. I'm giving it to all my kids for Christmas.

This recipe is incredibly filling.  We took it camping and usually just had this for a quick meal when we didn't have any energy or desire to make anything else.  When I made a 2nd batch, I did use Chocolate Malt Ovaltine just to add some nutrition since we were using it as a quick meal.

I decided to try this recipe for simple gifts this year.  My 2 1/2 year old daughter helped me mix up the ingredients (she was very excited to help!) and we made two batches.  We filled 6 pint jars and almost 3 quart jars!  My one addition to the mix was a bit of cinnamon. Yummy!

Yummy!!!!  This hot chocolate mix is THE BEST.  It tastes like the hot chocolate that you get in the gourmet coffee shops.  It's really rich & creamy.  We used whole milk instead of water.  I think next time I'll try it with 2% milk, as the whole milk was almost too creamy (but still delicious).

I used Ghiradelli (however you spell it) unsweetened cocoa powder.  I also used French Vanilla non-dair creamer instead of plain.  I put the mix in mason jars, decorated them with ribbon, & dipped spoons in melted white chocolate.  I'm giving sets to all the adults in the family since we only get presents for the kids.

Just an FYI, I used pint jars (that's all the craft store had, so everyone will get 2 jars).  This mix makes 4 pint jars with enough for about 1/4 - 1/2 jar left over.  I made 12 jars & used 3 batches & probably could have made 2 more jars with what was left over.

A good base to start with- one downside I thought was you needed so much powder (1/3 cup) to made the hot chocolate. I added twice the pudding mix and twice the chocolate drink mix (Nesquick). With those extras only 4 tablespoons is needed to make a richer drink.

This original recipe really lacked the chocolate flavor and sweetness we enjoy in hot cocoa.  So, I added more powdered sugar and cocoa until I reached the desired taste.  I put in a small baggie topped with mini marshmallows and put in a holiday mug for teacher's gifts.  Hope they enjoy!

My daughter actually made this recipe,after trying a few others from the site. This time she used SACO natural and  Dutch Chocolate blend cocoa,(actually one of the cheaper brands)and Cremora brand creamer. She also used the tip to run the dry milk through the food processor to give it a finer texture that won't lump when hot water is added.

This turned out to be the best batch, (delicious and creamy) and the one we will keep using for ourselves and gift giving. I think everyone needs to adapt the recipe to their own "Chocolate" taste.

This is a great recipe, as well as great for gift-giving! I ended up giving out individual servings instead of doing it in a jar. Went to Michael's and got those cellophane candy bags, cut the tops off, filled each bag with a heaping 1/3 cup. Also added marshmellows and those white chocolate peppermint baking chips as they melt very quickly in hot liquid, while giving it a minty flavor. Tied the bag with a festive ribbon, and they make great single-serve holiday gifts for friends and coworkers. They just the entire contents in the cup. Very tasty recipe! Also, I for the non-dairy creamer, I used a flavored one like Caramel Vanilla, and for the chocolate drink mix I used Ghiradelli's Sweetened Cocoa instead as I feel it gives it more flavor than something like Quick drink mix. 

I also made chocolate covered spoons to mix into the cocoa (or even coffee).

Loved this idea!  But if you like your hot cocoa really chocolatey, then you have to add more Nesquick and powdered sugar.  I quartered the recipe so that I could try it before making a whole lot for gifts.  Then I added more of the above to get it how I like it.  Once I figured out the new quantities, I made this with the ingredients layered alternating brown and white and instructions to mix once opened.  That way the recipient can see that it is truely made from scratch.  I also used jars with glass lids (Anchor Hocking) and filled the lids with mini marshmallows.

I first used old Carnation Milk powder which made it taste nasty.  But after buying a new box this turned out to be a good recipe.

Really glad I read through the reviews before I made this. REALLY glad. Thanks to those who went before me. I took lots of notes and adjusted it to get the best possible outcome for my money. For those skeptical that this is actually cheaper than your prepackaged mixes, shop bulk! You can totally buy most of the items in this recipe super cheap at your local bulk items store (like WinCo). For me, I had both Grocery Outlet (who had packaged powdered creamer at a screaming price for after Christmas and powdered sugar next to nothing and with the bulk, It cost me.....gosh, less than four bucks to make a double batch. Just food for thought.

It was not my favorite, It seemed like I kept adding scoops and it was just so watery still. I was expecting it to be more creamy with the pudding and I even added a little more because they don't sell 5 oz packages of non-instant pudding at my grocery store, so I may add more creamer or milk powder.

Ok second attempt I was just using what I had around the house. I only put 1 1/2 c. pwd milk, 1-3oz. vanilla and 1-3 oz chocolate pudding mix (cook and serve kind), 1 c. chocolate milk mix, 1/2 c. non-dairy creamer (extra rich original), 1 c. confectioners sugar, 1 c. unsweetened cocoa powder. I added only a couple of mounded-spoonfuls to a hot cup of skim milk and added some marshmallows. It was very good. I didn't have to spend a ton on milk powder and I think the mix will go a lot further since I don't have to use as much to make a cup of cocoa. (I won't be gifting it with this recipe, of course; it just wouldn't be enough to fill more than two jars.)

Don't look up any more Hot Cocoa recipes ... this is THE one.  Excellent gift!  I tied raffia around my jar & secured a few mini candy canes (pre-shrink-wrapped) in the wrapping for my recipients to use as stir-sticks.  How festive!!

blech!  just made 4 jars to give as gifts.  thankfully i made a cup of it first to try it out.  added 1/3 of the mix to 1 cup of water and it was awful!  added more mix and it was still bad.  tastes like hot powdered milk with a hint of chocolate.  i honestly don't understand the great reviews.  none of my daughters liked it either.  i'm going to have to do some major tweeking to make it drinkable.

This is a very rich tasting hot cocoa.  We made a Christmas craft jar and filled with this mixture to give as a gift in a holiday baked goods basket.  It was a big hit.  Thanks for the recipe, Traci.

[[EDIT]] Dec. 5 -- I altered the recipe a smidge and I've perfected it to my taste. First I omitted the dry milk and subbed regular dry creamer w/French 'Nilla. Then instead of adding mixture to hot water I added it to warm milk. Then LOTS of marshmellows on top. I promise, it comes out perfect. :)

Great idea, and great recipe. I added red and green sprinkles, a pinch more sugar, and a few chocolate chips to make the drink a darker brown (looks more like a chocolate drink but still has a frothy, creamy taste). i was worried i wouldnt be able to find anything that i could put in a jar AND would taste good but it really does taste wonderful.
i plan on copying another user and call mine Snowman Soup :) great idea!

I played with this a little to get the richness that I wanted. I doubled the creamer and used Fr. vanilla, doubled the sugar and used Hershey's dark cocoa. It was plenty rich when mixed with the 1 c. water to 1/2 c. mix proportion that the recipe suggests. I really enjoyed this and gave a bunch away at Christmas. Thanks for posting!

This was good but I was surprised at how watery it tasted, even after adding some half and half to the cup.  Next time, I will use others' suggestions and use vanilla flavored non-dairy creamer.  Perhaps that would help.

Excellent hot cocoa recipe! I've tried two others on this site, but this one is the best by far! Here are some alterations I made per my tastes: I used 1/4 each of vanilla creamer & chocolate creamer. I also added 1/8 tsp salt and a 1/2 cup of mini semi sweet chocolate chips (since they melt, it adds a nice chocolaty surprise at the bottom of your cup). I'll probably add a satchel tied to the jar filled with little peppermint candies and marshmellows. The great thing about this recipe is I used almost all store brand items and it came out tasting wonderful. This will make a wonderful and inexpensive Christmas gift. Thank you so much!
***EDIT***I read some more reviews and decided to try throwing everything in the blender -- EXCELLENT IDEA. Just add the chocolate chips in later and it's perfect! I've already been receiving compliments =D

Fantastic!  True chocaholics will LOVE this!  I used a 9 oz. box of powdered milk and a 3.4 oz of cook 'n serve pudding mix as well as the suggested amounts for the other things included non-dairy creamer that was French vanilla.

I used one 9oz box of powdered milk (~4 cups), one 5 oz box of pudding, 1 c quick chocolate drink mix, 1/2 c ghiradelli cocoa and  1/2 c vanilla creamer.  I left out the powdered sugar.  The recipe is ok with water (might be better if you used all the powdered milk in original recipe) but is YUMMY made with hot milk--rich, creamy, and a super holiday gift treat!

I plan to double the cocoa in the next batch for a "double chocolate" variation.

While this was not the best hot chocolate I have ever had, it had a pleasant flavor. I used the vanilla creamer as suggested and it will be absolutely fine for gifts. Will use this recipe again. My daughter loved mixing it up.

This was just okay - not any better than the instant hot chocolate mixes that you buy.  But, it still made nice neighbor gifts at Christmas.  We found tree-shaped glass jars and added a layer of mini-choc chips and crushed peppermint sticks to it.  Then, we made a baggie of mini-marshmallows to go with it. Last but not least, we also gave a small bottle of peppermint schnapps with the mix.

Fabulous!!  To add a little "holiday" to it, I ground up some candy canes in my blender and added the peppermint powder to it. Also left a few candy cane chuncks to decorate the cocoa in the jar.

To me, this tasted a little to "milky" and not chocolate enough.  I ended up adding more pudding mix and cocco powder.

Very, VERY GOOD!  I added just a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon to lend a bit of holiday flavor.  My husband is HOOKED!  ***HINT***  to get it to all blend and not have floaties (from the powder sugar) add 2 heaping tbs to a mug, then add just a bit of boiling water and mix together into a paste.  THEN add the rest of the boiling water.  Comes out nice and smooth, just so yummy!  Thank you for sharing!

All the reviews made this sound so good but I was underwhelmed by it. Its not that rich and not very sweet, I wish I would have added something more to it before I divided it up into jars as gifts.

Adding 1/3 cup of cocoa to 1 cup of water seemed too watery and bland to me.  I reduced the water to 3/4 cup, and it seemed perfect and creamy.  I plan on making cocoa cones with this by using disposable pastry decorating bags.

Awesome!  This recipe makes a huge batch too.  I've made this as gifts in a jar and also just for us.  The only change I made was I used chocolate flavored powdered non-dairy creamer to bump up the chocolate flavor even more.

If you like Starbucks hot chocolate or Hershey's hot cocoa, then you will like this. Instead of mixing with water, I used non fat milk (its just like water). Anyway, it tasted too much like the Hershey's cocoa. I added another cup of the chocolate drink mix and it didn't change things much. I'm going to add more confectioners sugar as some of the other posters have done and hope for the best. I am used to Nestle Rich Chocolate cocoa, so I like it a little sweet. This recipe as is, is not very sweet, but very coco-ie.

Updated: I ended up adding one more cup of powdered sugar. The next day, I drank my Nestles cocoa and I have to admit that I like this recipe better. The Nestles was definitely not as chocolaty. I am hooked now on this recipe with the few changes made. It's a dark chocolate flavor with just enough sweetness. Just play with the recipe a little until you find your niche. I added another star =)  Thank you for the recipe!!

These came out to be really cute christmas gifts. I placed them in baskets and paired with the recipe from this site for "peppermint marshmallows"- a great addition to the cocoa jars! Very cute gift ideas, I would add more sweetener next time. Thanks :)

Everything you want in a hot cocoa mix!  Thick, sweet, chocolatie and good!  I didnt think it was to sweet but I guess that is all depending on personal preference.  It is a recipie and it is based on your personal taste.  Arn't they all!  I had my kids make this for their teachers for Christmas presents (they are 7 & 8) and they have a GREAT time making it.  Fun for all and yummie for our tummies.  Make with milk.  Ohhh so much better!

This is a good mix. However, it was a little too milky for my liking. I tested the first batch over a couple of days so I had a chance to figure out what was missing. On my second batch I made these changes: increase cocoa powder to 1 full cup, and increase powdered sugar to 3/4 cup. The sweetness of the original recipe was good, but I increased in order to balance with the added coca. It made the biggest difference! The first batch looked like chocolaty milk, but the second batch was a creamy darker brown color. It was a ton better! I dumped out all the jars I from my first batch and added the extra cocoa and powdered sugar. It is not overly chocolaty or sweet. I also took another reviewers suggestion and used chocolate flavored creamer.

I thought this was good. The type of creamer you use could add to the sweetness of this cocoa as the flavored ones contain sugar.  If you use 8 oz. (1 cup) of hot H2O the 1/3 c. is plenty chocolatly for me.  I added about 1 tsp. Andes mint chips to mine and it was good and not overpowering.  It does not make 24 servings at 1/3 c. each. I have made this for baby shower favors and measured out each favor with 2 servings per bag and ran out 2 times.  I now have to reduce the recipe to 10 servings hopeing to get at least 8.  I also used good Ghirardelli cocoa and ground chocolate with cocoa for the 2 chocolates.  Maybe that's why mine didn't taste watered down.  I think processing the dry milk is the way to go. I added marshallows to the top of the cellophane cone bage and tied with a ribbon.

This makes a huge amount of mix.  I gave it away in mason jars as Christmas gifts this year.  I followed the recipe exactly only to add some finely ground toffee bits to give a little extra hint of sweetness to the mix.  If you are need of a gift for a lot of people this is a perfect idea.  Just place in a pretty tin with instructions and you are set.

We made this to put in jars for christmas gifts. it tastes just like any other hot cocoa mix I think. Not exceptional. it just makes it more special because you make it from scratch. We added some crushed candy cane to it as well which made for a nice colorful layer in the jar. That gave it it's unique flavor.

Personally, I'm used to store bought hot chocolate and this wasn't nearly sweet enough.  After trying the first cup I added about an extra cup of powdered sugar to the mix.  That helped a lot, although it might have been a bit much.  I think next time I'll go for an additional 3/4 cup, and if adding peppermints or other sweets maybe only 1/2 cup more.  I love the idea of dressing this up with pieces of candy and decorating the jar and will probably make it again, but as the recipe stands it tasted more like mexican hot chocolate than what I expected.

Like other, I'm making this for out 'Budget Christmas', me and the hubby just purchased our first home! I was not paying close attention at the grocery store and accidentally purchased Non-Fat Powdered Milk instead od of regular milk. After searching around I could not find regular powdered milk. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly as printed and dissolved 1/3 cup of the mix in 1 cup of water and it was very bland, could be due to the Non-Fat powdered milk. However, I added more Quik powdered milk and powdered sugar, a lot, and upped the mix to 1/2 cup and it's nice and rich. I also made homemade marshmallows and plan to give that away along with oatmeal cookies in a jar. Thank you for the recipe!

I made this recipe according to the directions and it tasted heavily like dry milk. I tried many of the suggestions on how to doctor it up but it was still bad. The best variation I could find was mask the dry milk flavor with a large dash of cinnamon and brown sugar but even then I would still prefer Swiss Miss or something else. 
Next year I think I'll just buy the big container of Swiss Miss at Sam's Club and add the marshmallows, chocolate chips and peppermint to decorate it. It looks pretty though, I used pizza shaped bags I got at the Christmas Tree Shop and trimmed it down, added mini chocolate chips, marshmallows and crushed peppermints and closed it with a ribbon. Hopefully I put in enough peppermint candy to mask the dry milk flavor.

We weren't crazy about this mix.  I made it to give as gifts in the jar and we found it just wasn't rich enough.

Store bought mixes seem sickly sweet after making this.  I followed reviewers and used the chocolate creamer and the great value brand choclate milk mix.  I gave out a few jars for christmas along side a batch of homemade peppermint marshmallows.  It was a hit there and here!

The quality and richness of your products definately effects the end result.  In other words, if you're shopping at Walmart and hoping to end up with Starbucks like hot chocolate, you're going to be disappointed.  Stick with the store bought hot cocoa mixes.  This was okay - definately no deep rich chocolately taste - but okay.

Pretty Good!   It did need a whir in the blender to make it a powder and to help it dissolve easier - but it was tasty!

Great tasting hot chocolate. I gave this as a gift. My Bullet blender with the flat-blade came in handy to premix ingredients before putting together in the bowl. Very smooth powder is the result.

The drink is good once I doctor up each individual cup.  I followed the recipe as is...then had to add more pudding, chocolate drink mix, sugar...lots of sugar (confectioners and the real deal) and more cocoa powder.  I made a huge container and scoop out enough cocoa mix for each cup...maybe it's my southern taste buds...or my familiar taste with store bought stuff.  It really is good though once I add more stuff to each cup.

This mix is very good. I was originally looking for a butterscotch hot chocolate mix to mimick one I'd purchased from someplace more expensive. I  used this recipe, but added 3 bags (~24oz) of broken/crushed butterscotch candies. When made with water, it's good. When made with milk, it's AMAZING! The butterscotch flavor is there without being overpowering. When my husband and I have it at night, we often add 1oz. of Amaretto liquor...yummy!

Really good.  I sifted the ingredients in, and added 2 packets of mini chocolate chips. When I packed them into the jars, I added marshmallows to the top.

I'm giving these as gifts to co-workers this year.  I ran out of instant milk and only used 5 1/2 cups vs. the recommended 6 1/2 cups but still tasted great, just like hot chocolate.

I didn't enjoy this recipe at all. Followed it to a T, but it just doesn't have the flavour I like. I'd much rather have the cadbury hot chocolate from the store - it is rich and has amazing flavour. I tried playing with the combinations of ingredients and don't even know what to suggest.

This recipe is AMAZING! My husband and I were married last Christmas and didn't have a lot of money to spend on gifts. We decided to give our families homemade gift baskets with lots of goodies inside. I made several items but this was the biggest hit of them all! We went to Costco to purchase all the items in bulk and still had some left after making hot cocoa for 16 people. Everyone is dying for me to make this again this year and it's great because it's so cheap and easy!!! We love this recipe all year round and add mini marshmellows to our jar for extra character. You can't miss with this great hit! The trick is the non-instant pudding. Be sure not to skip out on the hidden ingrediant! Enjoy!

This was just okay, it was too watery for us.  We had to use at least 1/2 cup of the mix just to match the taste of store-bought cocoa mixes.

This recipe was really good.  I was making this to give out to 70 people.  I put 1/3 cup in individual bags to give out.  I put marshmallos in the bag and attached the instructions and the recipe.  My kids love it.  It tastes better than the packets that I buy at the store.

This mix was so easy to put together!  I did sift the (non-fat) milk powder, cocoa powder and confectioner's sugar to get a nice smooth texture.  Mixed it in my stand mixer with the whisk attachment and it was fast.      I actually put this mix into plastic frosting decorator bags- layered with sprinkles, crushed candy canes and marshmallows- they make a great Christmas Gift!!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I made this today to give out as Christmas gifts. I tried a cup myself first and I loved it. I did make a few alterations though. I used 1c. powdered sugar instead of 1/2 and I used about 3/4-1 c. of cocoa powder. I ran it all through the food processor to mix and get the milk powder as fine as the rest. I turned out wonderfully! I think I will have to make some more just to keep here for the us! I will post pics as soon as I get the rest of my gift basket stuff done. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

THIS IS THE BEST STUFF EVER! All year long I have been saving any type of glass jar, fruit, jelly, mayo, pickle and so on. I have soaked the labels off and boiled them in hot water. I was looking for a Cocoa recipe to put in them. This is the one! I made few modifications as suggested. I made mine a little more sweeter and chocolate flavored. Here is what I did:
7  cups powdered milk
1 (5 ounce) package non-instant chocolate pudding mix
1 (3.5 ounce) package instant chocolate pudding mix
1 cup powdered chocolate drink mix
1  cup powdered non-dairy creamer
1  cup confectioners' sugar
1/2  cup regular unsweetened cocoa powder
1/4  cup dark unsweetened cocoa powder

Blend powdered milk in blender or food processor until a fine powder. Then blend all ingredients together in Kitchen Aid mixer. I placed 1/3 cups in the jars and topped off with chocolate chips and marshmallows before securing the lid.
I then tied the how to prepare cocoa card and a candy cane onto the jar! YEA !! I LOVE THIS STUFF! I WILL MAKE A HUGE BATCH JUST FOR ME!

OMG!! This is great and I cannot wait to give these as gifts! I had to "sample" before giving and now I have to make more! I even brought a jar to keep in my desk at work. I did put all the ingredients in a food processor and mixed it that way. Nice and smooth. HIGHLY recommend!

This recipe is not a thin type of cocoa mix.  Just what I was looking for.  I was tired of my family using half the mix in order to get the rich flavor they were after.  This mix provides that without a lot of excess fuss!

Wonderful and rich.  I made the recipe then put it in a disposable decorating bag having put three 1/3 cups in topped with mini marshmellows and chocolate chips.  I first closed it with a twist-tie then a seasonal fabric for decoration.  This made 7 bags.  I will give them away with the "Special Butterscotch Chip Cookies in a Jar" found on this website.  I thought the combo would make a great gift for our volunteers at church.

This turned out great!  I used all french vanilla creamer as others suggested.  I packed the mix in pint sized jars so I was able to get 6 jars made.  I also layered mini chocolate chips, Nestle Swirled Holiday white chocolate chips and mini marshmallows at the top of the jar.    I labeled it Snowman Soup following the suggestion of another reviewer.  They turned out great!

It tasted really blah - I'm a starbucks junkie, and I like it a little sweeter. So, I used 3/4 c. Vanilla Caramel creamer, 3/4 c. powdered sugar, and 1 1/4 c nesquik double chocolate. I also substituted butterscotch pudding. Caramel hot cocoa!!! yum!

Very good, but I found it is much better if you add 1/2 cup of malted milk powder to the mixture! It makes for a richer hot cocoa.

This tastes great and made a large Pyrex bowlful of mix. We did add an extra 1/2 cup of sugar for our taste but with marshmallows it would probably be sweet enough. Thanks for the recipe.

I love this hot cocoa! Its quick and easy to make and so so tasty! I would add a little more chocolate flavor to it because it seems somewhat mild, I like my hot chocolate really rich tasting. I'm definitely making this again!

Had to monkey with it to eliminate non dairy creamer. That stuff will kill you, but still worked very well without. Kids loved it.

This is a great chocolate mix. I am giving them away this holiday season. I used 2 (5oz) packages of chocolate pudding, and added an extra 1/4 cup of powdered sugar, because I felt that it still had a taste of powdered milk. I also plan to attach chocolate covered candy canes for stir sticks to give it a nice chocolate taste with just a hint of mint.

So easy to make, and it tastes great too!  I made it for Christmas gifts for all my neighbors last year, and will probably do so again in the future!

Nice and thick and rich.  Make sure to use the cook and serve pudding.  I made the mistake of getting instant with the first batch I made and it wasn't nearly as thick as with the cook and serve.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is very rich and very good!  Once I got started, I realized I had forgotten the confectioner's sugar so I subbed 1 cup of white granulated sugar.  It still tasted excellent!  I can't wait to fill the jars and give them as Christmas gifts.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made this as part of Christmas gift for my coworkers. I substituted splenda for the powdered sugar and used sugar-free pudding and no sugar added chocolate drink mix. It turned out amazing and so little sugar. Everyone loved it.

I just made this for the first time, since I'm a hot cocoa addict and a cold fall is upon us.  It sounded like it would be delicious and different from other recipes I've made for home made hot cocoa, but the taste is still pretty much the same.  I followed the recipe exactly, but found that 1/3 c. of powder into hot water just was not enough. It seemed very watered down to me.  So I upped it to 1/2 cup and that was better.  I do think I may put some more cocoa into the mix to take away the sweetness a bit and to make it richer.  It did not make as much as I thought it would either, so I'll make it again with some adjustments and see what I end up with. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

After trying several other hot chocolate mix recipes and being disapointed with the end results, I wasn't sure if I wanted to give this one a try. The reviews convinced me though, and I am so glad they did, this is a fabulous mix! I did add a little extra drink mix and powdered, but we just like it a touch sweeter, otherswise this recipe is perfect! Thankyou so much for sharing this recipe, I am already making our 6th batch. It never seems to last very long around here, it's so popular and delicious!

Very good mix. I added more powdered sugar and chocolate drink mix, as other reviewers did. Serve with milk for a much creamer texture. Not too sweet, but has rich flavors. Added a little cinnamon to spice it up.

I am assuming I did something incorrect based on previous recipes, but this was just terrible. So terrible in fact I felt compeled to write my first review ever on Allrecipes. I did a test batch before I gave it out as holiday gifts.  Not sure where I went wrong. Glad I tested it out before giving it to friends and family.

My kids loved this cocoa!  It is sooo much more rich than the store bought kind.  I didn't have a the powdered creamer, so I put in a package of vanilla pudding mix along with the chocolate pudding mix,and it turned out lovely! I whized the powdered mix in a blender before I stored it so that all the ingredients were the same coarseness...so that the powdered milk wouldn't settle to the bottom when it was stored for a long time.

Really yummy mix!  I added about 2 tsp. cinnamon and used the vanilla creamer.  I packaged in a sugar/creamer dispenser from the dollar store and dressed them up for teacher gifts (see my photo).  Labeled it "Vanilla-Cinnamon Cocoa Mix for Grown-ups!"  My son LOVED this cocoa and I made another batch to have at home.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good recipes, I'm making it for gifts this year with a small gift bag of home-made marshmallows. My only suggestions would be I used almost a half a cup more confectioners sugar and the dutch dark cocoa powder, and a 1/4 c. more creamer to make it less watery. Would definatly be better made with milk. Also recommend sifting all ingrediants before putting in jars. FYI recipe makes 5 pint jars full, be sure to tap them on the counter before sealing to allow for settling

Very good. I also added extra cocoa and extra sugar, and the end result was well worth it.  Add five or six tablespoons of this stuff to 1/2 cup of milk and 1 cup of ice and put it in the blender.  WOW!  Heaven in a glass.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I looked a lot of recipes and took a chance on this one. I only did 6 cups of powered milk. My hubby and I love this. I have also read a lot in using store brand stuff. But we are low on cash and did buy the store brand for.all the  ingredients. We shopped at kroger to do this. I add a little creamer to mine to add a little extra something... I have use hazelnut and now a smores cream, and they are both yummy in this. I also sift all the ingredients. I put the mix in the cup first and the add hot water. We r making them as Christmas gifts this year.

This was very watery tasting so I added another box of chocolate fudge pudding mix (the smaller box size), more cocoa, more powdered drink mix, alot more powdered milk and creamer. Then it tasted like something. Still wish it was a bit richer. Will have to keep playing with it to get it where it needs to be.

Best mix ever. I have TONS of people who ask for this every christmas! I did, however, add 1/3 cup of powdered vanilla coffee creamer. I felt this added a touch of vanilla that served to complement the flavor.

Very disappointing! I made this recipe because it had a higher star rating than the other hot cocoa mixes did. I went out and bought all the ingredients especially for the recipe and was so anxious to try it. It wasn't any better than a plain ol' store bought hot cocoa and didn't have much chocolate flavor at all. Very bland tasting. I've been trying it different ways by adding dark chocolate powder or coffee but am still not impressed.

This is delicious. Even better than the cocoa mix my mom made when we were growing up. My brother has a special love for hot cocoa, so I made this for him for Christmas. He's already finished what I gave him and requesting more. I did find it helpful to sift the ingredients before mixing together. It helped to ensure everything mixed evenly with no lumps.

I made two huge batches of this to give as Christmas gifts and asked my husband to taste test (he eats everything).  He kept saying it tasted funny.  Not being a cocoa person myself, I just figured it wasn't sweet enough for him so added more cocoa, choc drink mix & conf sugar.  He still said it tasted funny so I tried it and realized it was the pudding that was putting him off...me too.  Just the smell of it when I expected to smell chocolate was a turn off.  I'll remake adding more of above and eliminating the pudding.

I was very excited to try this hot cocoa mix; however, I wasn't incredibly impressed.  To me it was "just another hot chocolate mix."  It didn't stand out as particularly terrific. I enjoyed drinking it, but I've had better from store bought mixes.

this is "ok" I wouldnt say its as good as gourmet or even close to as good as cocoa w/ whole milk, but for those who are used to the store bought hot choc. drink mixes, this is much better.

Great place to start, but I didn't like it until I added an additional 1/2 C of the chocolate drink mix, 3/4 C Powdered Sugar & 1/2 C Cocoa to the amounts in the recipe. It's just too bland as written.

I had to add a lot more chocolate drink mix and sugar to this because it was pretty bland, and even then had a pretty bad after taste!

In theory, it's great, but in reality it was just OK.  I didn't care for the pudding taste myself.  My kids like it, although they did mention that it could use more sugar.

This was a very expensive recipe to make. While I originally liked the idea of giving out a mix I made I felt like I was just mixing things that I could have just bought and given to the people. The taste was great but I don't think I will make it again.

My husband, our friend, and 2 of our nieces hated this recipe.  We even tried doubling the amount we mixed into the water as we usually do that with store bought mix and it didn't help at all.  It tasted like powdered milk mixed with pudding mix.

Very good cocoa mix!  I accidentally bought the 3.5-ounce boxes of pudding instead of the 5-ounce boxes, but it still turned out plenty thick and chocolatey.  I have to admit, I was skeptical about the pudding anyway, but after reading reviews on other cocoa recipes that don't include pudding and seeing that people had added it, I was convinced to try it.  I made three batches so I would have enough to give for Christmas gifts and some to keep for my daughters and myself to use.  It's not something I'll be able to make very often because of how expensive powdered milk is, but when we want something special this will be on the list!

FANTASTIC!!!!  This recipe is not too sweet and very, very creamy.  The trick for this recipe is that you do need to put everything through the food processor/blender to make all of the ingredients the same size and consistency.  It was so smooth and creamy, my family and friends asked for me to make more and to NOT give it out as jar gifts like we were planning.

Okay so I hate to admit it... but this is the best hot cocoa I've ever had. I didn't expect it to be much different than any other mix I'd tried because I honestly thought "How different could a cocoa mix really be?"
 
This is the perfect mix for adults.  It's creamy and smooth, with a good chocolatley taste... but not to sweet.  Sometimes hot cocoa can cause tummy aches, but this isn't heavy feeling at all.  

I made a few changes... some by reader review and some because I can't read directions correctly.  I used vanilla non-dairy creamer and a dark chocolate drink mix.  I also had to use vanilla pudding because I didn't notice the "non-instant" part and bought the wrong kind. (I had vanilla on hand from a previous oops!) And once it was all mixed I put it in my food processor because my dry milk was bigger than everything else.  

I will def be giving this as gifts for christmas this year.  Have a safe and blessed Christmas!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Absolutely wonderful.  I made this to include in a gift basket for a fundraiser auction.  I made the batch and sampled a cup...incredibly creamy and delicious.  Because the generic powdered milk I used was more like small pellets than powder, after I mixed up the recipe I ran it all through my blender in small batches.  This worked great--the mix ended up looking great, and it dissolved immediately and completely in boiling water.

A *great* recipe.  I highly recommend it!

I was a little suprised by the other reviews on this one. (Although we do all have different tastes and preferences!!) I really found this recipe to be great. Unlike others, I thought the "sweetness level" was perfect for my tastes. Also, I used a french vanilla cofee creamer which worked great! Forget putting it in jars to give to others! This one stays on my pantry shelf all winter long for whenever we want some!

This is a delicious hot chocolate mix.  It needs more sugar for my family's taste;  we add a tablespoon of Splenda per serving, and absolutely love it!  As other reviewers mentioned, this hot chocolate is really filling and can be a snack all by itself.

This is a very forgiving recipe!  I didn't have chocolate pudding and was concerned about texture, so I used vanilla and doubled the unsweetened cocoa.  I forgot the confectioners' sugar and I don't think it needed it at all.  I was surprised at how yummy the end result was and am sad we don't have any left for the family!

Very Creamy.  My kids loved it!  I cut heart shaped marshmallows and filled a mug for my daughter's teachers as a Valentine's gift. I heated the water, added the mix, then finished by whipping with my hand blender, ultra smooth. Yummy!

This is excellent and I thought it tasted rich and creamy enough with just boiled water. I used French Vanilla creamer as others had done and sifted the ingredients before mixing it all together.

This was so rich and creamy.  I used vanilla creamer and hazelnut (in separate batches) and gave this in a cellophane gift bag along with a plate of homemade frosted sugar cookies.  I delivered them on a Christmas plate and put the bag of cocoa in a matching mug as gifts for my extended family.  They we a big hit.

I really wished this had lived up to its stars! I bought tons of stuff to make a lot of gift jars with this cocoa mix and I was less than impressed. It was kind of thin and bland...but since I bought all that dry milk (kind of costly in bulk), I added an extra package of pudding, and 1/2 c. french vanilla creamer and it came out a little better. I wouldn't consider giving this as a gift again, it's just not all that.

This is great hot chocolate!  Put it in a nice jar, decorated with ribbon and a tag for directions - and it makes a perfect addition to cookies for Christmas gift giving.  Nice and creamy, this mix should recommend mixing with hot milk rather than water.

This hot cocoa mix is wonderful!! So rich tasting! I did not put in the chocolate protein drink mix only because I forgot to get it for the recipe. My husband is a hot cocoa drinker and he said it is the best he has had! Very good!! I will keep this hot cocoa mix on hand all winter long!

Meh.  I was expecting something more rich and indulgent as I intend to give this mix as gifts for Christmas.  So...I doubled the chocolate drink mix, the powdered sugar, the (chocolate flavored) creamer, and the cocoa powder.  I am also going to run some candy canes through my food processor and add it to my mix.  My tags will say "Peppermint Cocoa Mix" and will instruct consumers to mix with milk rather than water.  This will be very creamy and indulgent, the way a homemade hot cocoa mix gift should be!  Otherwise it would just be easier to buy Nestle cocoa mix and package it for gifts rather than make your own and have it not be as good.

I'm giving this 3 stars because its a good starting point and the addition of the pudding mix is tasty. However, I like most people had to tweak it to make it good. I made these for christmas party favors. I mixed several batches one at the time and after I made the first I tried it to make sure it was good. I like mine super chocolate-y and sweet. Here is what I did and how I mixed my cup/wrote the directions.
3 1/2 cups powdered milk, 2 (5oz) boxes cook and sever chocolate pudding mix, 2 cups nesquik, 1/2cup vanilla non dairy creamer, 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 cup cocoa powder. Made a cup + a tad over 3 pint jars worth. For mixing/what I tried I heated a large mug of water in the microwave until hot then stirred in 4 heaping tablespoons full of the mix. by heaping I mean...was probably about 6-7 level tablespoons worth. It of course does not taste like box mix but it has the same sweetness and chocolate levels. I was surprisingly pleased with the out come as I normally mix hot cocoa mix with warm milk not water. So yeah after tweaks I would definitely make it again and make it for myself.

This is a great recipe!  Very rich and creamy.  The best I have found.  I was able modify this to suit my lactose intolerant boyfriend by using "Morning Moos" dairy alternative powder.  This mix is more dense than powdered milk, so I used 1/2 of what the recipe called for.  I also put the mix through a food processor to removed any lumps.  Turned out great!

This is really pretty good.  I added an extra cup of sugar because 1/2 cup just isn't enough for this much mix.  I also omitted the chocolate drink mix because looking at the ingredients for the drink mix, it was primarily just cocoa and sugar (and I didn't have any).

I may have done something wrong, however i think the recipie tastes too much like the powdered milk. It was bland to me. I added a good amount of sugar and cocoa powder to give it more flavor and i finaly started geting the flavor I wanted. In all I did not like the recipie

As is, I don't like the recipe at all.  After reading other reviews I added extra powdered sugar and chocolate creamer.  However, the strongest flavor I tasted was the powdered milk.  And I hate powdered milk.  All homemade hot cocoa drinks I've ever had always have a stong powdered milk taste.
So, I added an extra box of pudding, and about a cup more of the chocolate powdered drink mix.  With the extra chocolate ingredients it's better...but I'll stick with my Nestles hot cocoa mix.  I'm giving this away for Christmas.  I know others won't have issues with the powdered milk like I do.  All in all, dissapointing.

i have made this every Christmas for gifts for the last 3 years and everyone looks forward to it. they love it! i also put it with several other items as well in baskets. huge hits!! for the non dairy creamer i use french vanilla flavor instead of just plain and it makes it have just a little hint of vanilla which everyone loves as well.

This is delicious! I used Gingerbread creamer to get a little extra flavor and plan to make variations of vanilla caramel, etc for all my neighbors Christmas gifts.

This was really good! I had my reservations after others comments and I was going to buy a choc. flavored powdered creamer like others suggested but forgot to adjust my grocery list so when I got home, I used half of the plain I purchased and substituted the other half with store bought cocoa mix I didn't care for at all. It was like a half a cup to a huge batch and I don't think it made that much difference but all in all, I thought it was great! I thought it had plenty of chocolate flavor and even though you do have to add a lot, which you have to with store bought too if you want it rich, it still had a richer, darker tones, more like a gormuet cocoa in a shop but it was MUCH better then what I have picked up for my kids in ANY coffee shop I've been to. I didn't think it was bitter at all and the pudding was good in it.  Only downfall? The powdered milk especially was too expensive! Yikes The whole thing was spendy but still probably less then at a shop, cup for cup, and of coarse, better.

I made this for Christmas gifts for co-workers and friends, and they all loved it. The ask me to refill their jars when they empty them. The pudding in the mix makes it very creamy and chocolately.

My wife and daughter make buckets of this stuff, put it in little jars with mini marshmallows, and gave it out for Christmas treats. I'd use more cocoa, though. a little milky for my taste.

I think this is a very good basic recipe.  I thought the pudding would make it more chocolatey...it's kind of bland...like warm chocolate milk, which would be good for kids.  I had to add more cocoa powder to get a truly chocolatey chocolate.

Very smooth, creamy tasting mix.  The only thing different I did was I used a Vanilla Caramel creamer instead of plain.  I used a mix of generic and brand name products, but it was a tad pricey.  Not as sweet as store bought cocoa mix, which was actually a good thing in my opinion. 
I am planning on giving these as gifts, so I am pleased that my trial run worked out well.
Also, my powdered milk was larger than all the other ingredients, and even though I didn't blend it, everything melted beautifully.  I didn't have anything settled to the bottom, like I do w/ store bought cocoa. Though, I might blend future batches just so the milk doesn't settle to the bottom while it's stored.
Now I just need to figure out the best place to buy the 1 qt jars.
Thanks for a great recipe!

I wasn't thrilled with the outcome of this recipe!  My kids were not too happy either, probably b/c I have let them have store bought Hot Cocoa too often! Not so sugary and sweet.

This is great hot cocoa.  I made it exactly by the recipe(only in 1/2 portion) so that we could try it and found it to be a family pleaser.  Wanted to make it as Christmas gifts in decorated quart jars, but was so pressed for time I needed to take a few shortcuts.  This is what I did and it really did have just as much flavor.  I used one wal-mart brand canister of hot cocoa mix, one cup of creamer, 3 TBS hershey's cocoa, and one 5 oz pkg of chocolate instant pudding mix.  Now, this did make more than a one quart jar, but I kept the extra for us.  I did give this yesterday as Christmas gifts and already received phone calls this morning that it is great!!!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

This is a great recipe!  I followed the instructions, only substituting french vanilla creamer for the regular and dark cocoa instead of the plain.  I also added a bit of cinnamon for flavor.  I dressed up some mason jars and gave the mix as gifts along with some homemade marshmallows, too cute!

Great stuff. Way better than the packet stuff and makes bunches. And very easy. I put it in a big empty coffee can and we drink it on cold mornings and evenings. Would make a very cool gift in cute jars as suggested. Who does not love a rich cup of hot cocoa?

This is very creamy, which I love.  I made the recipe to giev away as a party favor for my cookie exchange.  I made a mug of it before I gave it away and was glad I did.  While I love the creaminess of it, it definitely needed more sugar (I think for anyone's taste).  So I added an additional 2 teaspoons of powdered sugar per serving--perfect!  This was my only modification.  Next time I think I'll try adding some chocolate shavings to it.  Yummy!  I am definitely keeping this recipe.

I followed the other reviewers idea of blending all together and I didn't have any lumps in the bottom.  I followed measurements as listed and sampled it before putting in the jars.  I thought it was very watery and all I could taste was the cream.  I added the remaining pudding packet (I only had 3.5 oz so used 1 1/2 boxes), a little extra sugar and chocolate drink mix.  I liked it better with these additions.  The second cup I sampled was chocolaty and creamy!

This recipe was okay as is, but I thought it was a lot better with a few changes.  I did the recipe as written, but using amaretto flavored creamer, and it was okay but not sweet or chocolatey enough for me, and a bit chalky.  I dumped in a bunch more powdered sugar (3/4 to 1 c?), maybe 1/2 c or so more chocolate milk mix, and 1/4 c. more cocoa powder.  That made it more flavorful and thick-tasting.  The powdery taste was my own fault for not getting the water hot enough on my first taste test.  I used much hotter water the second time around and it cut down on the chalky.  With the changes I felt much better about giving this as gifts.  
The amaretto flavor was a tasty addition, and I think using the wal-mart brand chocolate milk mix made the flavor stronger like another reviewer had mentioned.  Overall, it was tasty and worth making.  Thanks!

Not bad. I think I would prefer it a tad sweeter. It's creamy enough. I measured out all my ingredients in a bowl then sifted it all together, combining well. I have some lumps on the bottom of my mug which don't seem to want to stir out. Not sure why. I'll be keeping this mix for home and not giving as gifts though. I think it needs a bit more tweaking first.

good. I used less powdered milk and French Vanilla whitener. Also doubled the cocoa. I sifted the ingredients first which helped the powder dissolve well, but my kitchen was covered in a fine coating of white powder thanks to the milk!!!

I don't mean any disrespect, but I really didn't like this recipe at all.  I had much bigger expectations.  I made 3 batches for 12 pint jars, and every one was disappointing.  I think there's too much of the powdered milk, and not enough sugar or chocolate.  In the end, I could have just wrapped up a box of Nestle's Hot Cocoa, and it would have tasted better.  Sorry.  It just wasn't for me.

I thought this was good but I had something richer in mind.  Still tastes like Nestles out of the pouch.  I had a to die for mix given to my family as a child and I am still searching for something that stands up to that one!

I have made the traditional hot coocoa mix for the past 3 years for my neighbors for christmas. This year I tried this one and WOW! Oh was it good after I made my changes. It wasn't that good as written.

Here are my changes

6 cups powdered milk

1 package of non-instant Chocolate pudding mix
1 cup nestle quick
2/3 cups CHOCOLATE non-dairy creamer
1/3 cup non dairy creamer
1 cup Nestle Special Dark Cocoa Powder (for baking)
1/2 cup confectioners sugar
2/3 cup powdered cinnamon candy
2 tablespoons Corn Starch


I took 2/3 a cup of homemade cinnamon candy and powdered it in the food processor and added it along with 1/2 cup of powdered sugar. I used Chocolate Creamer and added an extra 1/2 cup of cocoa. I subtracted 1/2 cup of powdered milk too. I also added 2 tablespoons of corn starch.

I sifted everything to make a fine texture and used a whisk in a really big bowl to combine.

The pudding mix and the corn starch added the richness that was missing.

The neighborhood loves it!

I made a batch of this and took it on a camping trip with my husband & 5-year-old son. They both really loved it (me too) and it was the perfect drink for those chilly nights under the stars!

It has a weird, almost salty taste that I'm attributing to the powdered milk.  I used "non-fat dry milk", but I don't know if this was correct.  

I will probably throw the rest of the batch out.

I thought this was just ok.  I have another cocoa mix recipe that I have used and it wasn't as creamy as this.  But I think this could use some tweaking.  I don't think it was chocolately enough.  I may try this again and use some of Cyndy's changes.  Thanks!

I thought this was a pretty tasty recipe.  I was a little afraid that the pudding mix might not dissolve well, but it gave the mix and nice base. I used hazelnut creamer and it gave the hot cocoa a subtle kick.  I would use just a bit more sugar next time--otherwise very pleased.

I've been making this as Christmas gifts for 2 years. I think it is a little sweet but the kids love it. I have to make it during the year for my 11 year old. It is easy for her to make her own hot choc. anytime!

I think the Nestle Hot Chocolate is better.  It's fairly bland and I even added extra chocoloate to it.  I like my cocoa very rich.

Very rich and chocolatey, though I like mine with a bit more mix per cup of cocoa than the recipe calls for.  My husband thought it needed more sugar, while I liked it as is--depends on taste.  He doesn't like the dark chocolate taste as much as I do, so I think that's why he wanted more sugar in it.

I’m a teacher making gifts for teacher colleagues. Thanks to the reviews, I used 1 C powdered sugar and 1 C cocoa and 1 C powdered chocolate drink mix. I used a sifter to improve the consistency finished product. I ended up with 6 pint jars and enough to sample myself. (Yum!) The jars looked festive wrapped with a ribbon and candy cane.

Honestly, this is not any better than the mix you can get at the store. I tried most of the tweaks people suggested, and was not wowed. I wanted a mix on par with the rich chocolate I like from the Starbucks mix. Even with using the darkest chocolates I can find, adding choc chips, and using 3 heaping tablespoons in warm milk, it still Tastes like Swiss miss to me. Was hoping for better.

This didn't taste any different than store bought hot cocoa mix. I did sift the powdered milk as I bought the store brand and it was a bit clumpy.

Delicious!
I used Ovaltine Chocolate Malt mix and Sugar Free Creamy Chocolate Coffeemate non-dairy creamer. I've never prepared anything with dry milk before and I'm pleasantly surprised by how creamy the product is! I'll definitely use this for holiday gifts.

I mixed up a quadruple batch to jar and give as favors at my daughter's birthday party, and when it was finished, I had to taste-test it before giving it to my guests.  It did not disappoint!  It is much more creamy and chocolaty than your average store-bought powdered cocoa mix.  I suspect the pudding mix is the key.  My only criticism is that it creates a lot of "dust" when mixing, transferring into jars, or scooping into a mug--but this is true of all such mixes, in my experience.  This one has by far the best flavor of those I've tried.

I did follow the suggestion made by other reviewers to use chocolate-flavored powdered creamer, and this probably boosted the flavor.  With that one simple modification, it's a 5-star recipe for a powdered mix!  I jarred it with a few peppermint marshmallows, which is my favorite way to drink it!

The recipe is awesome once sugar is added.. I like my hot coco sweet.. I'm trying 1 cup of sugar to the mixture.. I added 3 tablespoons to the individual cup (1/3 cup of mixture with 1 cup of hot water) and it was a chocolate heaven!!

Easy to make and great taste.  This makes a large amount of hot cocoa, we were able to split it up for 4 teacher gifts.  They were all very impressed with the homemade gift.  We gave it with large marshmallows and directions tied to the outside.

It was good with hot water but better with hot milk. Like many have said it was creamy tasting, and I used a flavored creamer which seemed to enhance the chocolate flavor. Also used half as much powdered milk as it called for, didn't want to the milky taste to over power the chocolate and vanilla so I added 3 cups of creamer and 3 1/3 cups powdered milk. It turned out great =D now I have a go to recipe for hot chocolate when winter time comes again and its cheap to make too! Thanks ^-^

This was delightful! I made a huge batch to give to colleagues and friends as gifts and everyone loved it. I, of course, had to sample as well and thought it was the best cocoa I've ever had. I did use vanilla-flavored non-dairy creamer and instead of cocoa powder (I ran out and didn't realize) I chopped up a ghiradelli chocolate bar and put it in the food processor before adding to the mix. I also wanted a layered effect so I chopped up candy canes to put on top with mini marshmallows and chocolate chips. Served in a bell jar with a ribbon and it was a great holiday gift. Cheap too - I figured that it only cost about $9 per gift including the jar and ribbon.

Great Coco Mix. After reading some of the reviews I made a couple of changes. Used all creamer, no powered milk. I did not have drink mix, so I used 5 bags of instant coco mix, made one cup.  Increased coco powder and sugar to 1 cup each.

This is probably the best hot cocoa recipe we've tried.  We do add just a little more powdered sugar for added sweetness, but no other changes.  My daughters take this to school with them in the morning and have requests from their friends to bring extra for them.  Word has gotten around the schools and now everyone wants to try it.  :)

I made this recipe with Ovaltine as one reviewer suggested since I was going to package it up to send to deployed soldiers.  My husband noted the use of Ovaltine right off and said more chocolate and less Ovaltine.  We doubled all the chocolate items and added more powdered sugar.  Still not the chocolately goodness we were going for, but it will do for home.

I think it needs more sugar and chocolate.  Its also more costly than I expected.  I mixed it in the food processor.  Made it for my 2 boys teachers at school.   Thanks.

I found the recipe to be pretty bland as is.  My grocery store does not carry chocolate creamer though (based on other reviews), so perhaps that's an important component.  I used a full cup of sugar and a tablespoon of cinnamon.  I would also not recommend mixing with water and would only mix it with milk.

Yes I agree with those that said it needed a bit more sugar. I also added cinnamon and then it wasn't too shabby.

I was disappointed in this.  I had to increase the powder sugar, choclate mix, and cocoa.  However this gave me a good idea where to start.  This is definatly a Hot Cocoa mix not Hot Chocolate. So I had my husband and kids sample it because they love Hot Cocoa and I prefer Hot Chocolate. They said it was OK.  After playing with it I found a mixture that we all enjoyed.

I doubled this recipe twice to make for family Christmas baskets and placed the mixture in a 1 quart jar.  I took a plastic bag filled wih mini-marshmellows and placed it ontop of the drink mix in the jars.  Looks really nice, although I haven't actually tried the recipe myself yet. I hope it tastes as good as it looks!

I had high hopes for this one. The chocolate taste was good, but it was not as sweet as I expected, so I added some Splenda. Also, there are lot of yucky clumps at the bottom of the cup that do not stir in, even though I mixed all the ingredients together in the food processor. I will be looking for another recipe. Sorry.

I just made this and I thought it would be a little more chocolatey and sweeter than it was. It isn't bad at all, it tastes about the same as the powdered hot chocolate that comes in packages. It is very quick and easy to make; I added some chocolate chips to the mix and sprinkled some crushed candy canes on the top to make it look better.

This recipe was great! I added a little cinnamon on top and it was very creamy and tasty. It's amazing how it really does taste like real hot chocolate from starbucks. I am using this recipe for Christmas gifts! Thanks!

This is an ok recipe for hot chocolate.  I followed the directions to a T and got a salty taste that I have no idea where it came from.  This is a very easy recipe though.  Make sure you use fresh powdered milk. I used some that was older than I thought and had to throw all the hot chocolate mix away.

My family loved this hot cocoa mix!  For gift giving I placed 1/3 cup of mix (1 serving size) into small plastic candy wrap bags, sealed the bag by folding and taping and then I created a label with instructions on card stock and stapled it on over the fold.  They look so cute, I can't wait to add them to gift baskets and my kids want to hand them out to friends.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Took this camping.  Great recipe.  The only thing I would recommened would be to use milk instead of water.  This makes a huge difference in the taste.

I also used the vanilla creamer and I thought this turned out good. My kids seemed to like it, so I put it in the teachers gift baskets for Christmas. Hope they enjoyed it. It's very easy to make, try it!
