I saw this recipe and thought it would be good to use with all the pork roasts I have. It was a huge hit! My husband NEVER eats left overs but this one he did and it was gone the next day. I used sugar free preserves so it wasn't that sweet but it was great. Insteat of taco shells they put down a bed of tortilla chips and put the topping on that and ate it like nachos. WONDERFUL!!!

I actually didnt make these from this website but its the same ones you can get off of the pillsbury website.  I made it for my friends and they LOVED it.  i let mine cook in the salsa and perserves for about 30-40 min just to make sure everything was really cooked.  I had made a double batch so if you do let it cook longer to let the sauces cook down a bit.

Well, these are pretty darn tasty! My husband was stunned when he saw me mixing the preserves into the pan but was quick to say "these are really good..I'm surprised"! We didn't think they were too sweet, in fact there is just a touch of sweetness. Just be sure to use only the amount called for regarding the apricot preserves. I would recommend trying the cubed pork for some 'bite'. I used leftover shredded pork that I had on hand and by the time everything else was added, it was a bit mushy, so I would think the minced pork would be the same. I served these with the usual taco toppings.

By far, the best tacos on this site!  I did it a little different than the recipe but it was awesome.  I mixed the salsa, preserves and beans in the crockpot, seared off the pork on the stove and added it to the crockpot.  I cooked it on low for 3 hours.  Absolutely amazing!

Used to be one of my favorite quick meals and now that I am eating less and less meat in my diet, I tried a vegetarian version with a 1/2 cup of chopped onion and approx. 2 cups of chopped bell peppers and 2 red skin potatoes and it still came out delicious!

just like another reviewer I also got this recipe a few years ago from another web site and I love it. I dont even like apricot preserves but I like the flavor they add to the recipe. The original recipes also states to add sliced green onion in addition to the black olives for a topping. Yum! I like to add sour cream and shreeded cheese to mine.

I WAS INTRIGUED BY THE APRICOT PRESERVES. IT ACTUALLY TASTED PRETTY GOOD IN THE TACO MIX. MY HUSBAND SAID IT WAS IT WAS A LITTLE TO SWEET, BUT THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD. NEXT. TIME FOR HIM I WILL ONLY ADD 1/2 THE PPRESERVES. IT WAS AN EASY. TASTY DISH.

Very good.  A real "keeper."  Washed and drained my chili beans and added a squirt of lemon juice. Filled taco shells, topped with some grated cheese, then placed in 300 oven for 7 minutes.  Crunchy deliciousness - rave reviews!  (I always do the oven thing with tacos.  My sister-in-law taught me this little trick many years ago.) I have another recipe that uses concentrated lemonade.  May try that in place of the apricot preserves some other time.  Thanks for posting this one.

SO weird...and SO good.  I would have given five stars, but its too soupy to serve as tacos. We made nachos instead and the whole family enjoyed.  Its a silly recipe, but we'll make it again. I'm sure of it.

I LOVE tacos, wraps and burrito type meals. They can be enjoyed by vegans, vegetarians, and meat-a-sauruses alike. And at the same meal, too! I do this recipe with black beans in place of pork, for me. But will offer the meat for non-veggies. The apricots provide a stunning taste bud experience with the other ingredients. Delish! When I skip the meat, I also skip the taco seasoning. I love this recipe!

My kids loved this, although they chose to use flour tortillas (for soft tacos) and one of them picked all the beans out.  I have to say, I wasn't crazy about the dish, possibly the jam made it a little too sweet.  I'll keep it in a recipe box for them to make but I don't think I'll be making this again, purely because of my own personal taste.

Yummy!

I sent this recipe to my two college kids to try because it's so easy and good. 

I changed the recipe just a little and forgot the apricot sauce.  I'll try that next time.

Absolute staple in my house, we all love this dish. It has few ingredients, is quick and easy, and always tastes great. It's hearty and perfect for a quick weeknight meal, plus you can add whatever you like to doctor it up.

This was delicious!  I was hesitent of the apricot preserves, but it does give the dish a nice flavor.  Also worked great for leftovers; the sauce thickens up a little bit so you can use soft shells more easily.

Been making this since the mid 90's when it was a Pillsbury Bake-Off winner.  It has been a family favorite ever since and is requested over and over when I cook for a special occasion.  The spicy-sweet flavor is amazing!  I use diced chicken breast instead of pork.

Fabulous!  I actually made this in my Instant Pot.  I just mixed the salsa and taco seasoning and put it in the pot, added a 1-lb. pork tenderloin (whole) and set it on manual for 40 minutes, quick release.  It shredded so easily and then I added the apricot preserves and a can of black beans (didn't have pinto).  Even better left over!

I cubed a lb of pork shoulder and browned in the fry pan. Then put all ingredients in the crock pot. Useing hot chili beans and jalepeno salsa. The flavors of the apricot and spices were amazing.  Had more pork left over so i did it again the next day put all in the fry pan this time. Tasted just as great.

My family loves this recipe!  I make it at least once a month.  We add a fresh cabbage and cilantro slaw on top and serve it with flour tortillas.  My husband has a food allergy that makes going out for tex-mex difficult so it is wonderful to be able to make it at home.

OK, so I did not follow this EXACTLY. I really just jumped on the idea of using pork meat with taco seasoning, salsa, and apricot preserves as a base taco filling and it was delicious! I just threw all of those ingredients in a dish, baked it until heated through, and everyone gobbled it up. No leftovers! Super easy, healthy; this will be a staple in our house. Thanks for the idea!

This was really good.  A bit soupy, but a slotted spoon solves that.  For me a bit sweet (never really been a sweet person), but husband thought it had perfect flavor.  I would recommend if you aren't really a sugar person to half the apricot preserves.  I used pre-sliced pork that was cut thin and long, like for fajitas.
