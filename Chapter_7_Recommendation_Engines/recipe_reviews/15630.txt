Delicious!  Just like the ones my Grandma made.  My kids love it!  However, 8 oz. of liquid is way too much.  I only used about 4 oz. of egg/vinegar/water mixture.

I have been searching for the "Perfect Pie Crust" that tasted like my Grandma's Pie Crusts back in the 50's & 60's. I finally found it with this recipe. The Lard and Brown Sugar are the secret. This recipe makes crusts that are Light, Tender and Flaky. I made 3 different fruit pies for Christmas Dinner for all the family and everyone raved about my pies and especially the delicious crust. I have tried many other crust recipes and this one is definitely the best of them all. This will always be my one and only crust.

Great crust! Used it for pumpkin pies and it was delicious! I cut down the recipe to 16 servings which made JUST enough for 2 pies, must use wax paper to roll it without ripping though. For the egg part  (16 servings) it asks for a 1/4 of an egg. Just crack the egg, whip it to mix then use 1 tbsp.

I have tried and tried for years to make a crust like my great grandmother. I finally found IT!!! It is the most tender, flaky and tasty crust I have ever had. I roll it between wax paper, it's a bit hard to handle without but wow is it worth it!!! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I just love this pie pastry recipe..Never fails for me. The only thing that I do differently is to use 2 tsp baking powder and only 1 tsp salt. By far the best pastry around..Easier than on food channels.

This is an old fashioned recipe that has stood the test of time.  I made half the recipe so I could freeze some of the dough to have on hand.  Rather than 8 oz (or 4 oz in my case) I just added 1 tbs of water at a time until the dough came together well.  I refrigerated my dough, wrapped, over night then brought it to room temperature before rolling out.  It handles well and makes a flakey, light crust.  Thank you phaylock!

Will use this recipe with some notes and modifications. It cooks up nicely but doesn't "handle" well at all. I had to work more flour into it to be able to handle it at all, iti was very sticky otherwise. Excellent flavor and easy to make.

Very good pie crust.  My husband thought it tasted like the crust on a Hostess fruit pie, but he liked it too.

Awesome pie crust. I used the suggestion of only 4 ounces of liquid (I think 8 would have been too much as well) and I used butter instead of lard. Delish! This was also my very first pie crust!

I’m showing mine pre-ball, lol, to express how perfect the texture comes out by following this recipe exactly. So nice to handle and as yummy and flaky as one is going to get!

This was my first time making pie crust, so this review is only on the actually ingredients and of the directions only.  I have yet to actually bake the pie crust and can’t comment on the flavor quite yet. I followed the directions and ingredients, but after reading the recommendations of other reviewers, I cut the liquid (water) down.  But after trying to knead out the dough it was really hard to get it to form into a dough ball. I also read other reviewers stating the dough was hard to handle. I decided to throw it into my kitchenaide mixer using the dough tool.  The dough still would not form into a ball, so I slowly started adding teaspoons of cold water until it started to form into a ball shape.  It took about 7-10 minutes in my mixer to finally form a ball. I don’t know how anybody could form this by hand without kneading the dough for a long time.  I recommend using a kitchenaide mixer or other comparable mixer to yield a good finished product. Otherwise, great directions and recipe.. Can’t wait to taste it! Thank you

This pie crust was one of the hardest ones I've ever made. I'm 65 years old, I've made a million pies. This dough was so soft. Per other reviewers, I also  didn't use all the liquid. .  I wrapped it in plastic wrap& a zip lock bag to chill overnight in the fridge. I let it warm up just enough to room temperature so I could roll it the next day. But even rolling it out on floured wax paper, it was nearly impossible to pick the piecrust  up to get it into the pie pan. Wax paper on both sides using the rolling pin &  it took all my skill to get it into the pan and even with that it tore. Getting the top crust on was equally hard. If this is your first piecrust I wouldn't use this recipe. The taste was OK.  I found  it a little grainy versus flaky,  but the flavor was good.  However , I don't think I'll use this one again. It wasn't worth all the work.

I have been looking for this recipe for years!!! Used to make 75 plus pies every year and freeze them. That was in the 80's.  Thank you Thank you!!!  Now an old tradition of apple pie making will be alive once more!!! I give them  as  gifts and to friends, and of course family. Have not been able to even touch an apple pie. Since I forgot the  measured amounts! You have brought back a missed tradition and a love for pie!! Thank you!!!!  I use cake flour ,  but everything else is right on!!

I used self-rising flour and omitted the baking powder. This pie crust is FABULOUS... my NEW FAVORITE!
