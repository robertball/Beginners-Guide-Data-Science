These Brownies tasted awful!  They tasted like flour and we're tough.  I would never fix them again.

The fat content for these brownies is GREAT, but the taste is wanting. I redeemed the batch I made by putting a butter chocolate frosting on them. It added just a little more fat.

We loved them. I didn't have any baby food prunes so I improvised. We have 3 fig trees and we had dehydrated a lot of figs this year so I took some dried figs and boiled them for a few minutes and then pureed them and added water as needed to make the consistency of baby food. This is the best lowfat dessert recipe that I have made to date.

I have to say the way I made these they weren't great.  I didn't have any cake flour so I used AP flour.  I also substituted Splenda for the sugar.  They were a bit rubbery and bland.  I put some cool whip on it and it help it a ton! So overall I'd didn't think they were bad for the calories they had.  I'll make these again!

My husband's take: No, just no.  These were pretty bad.  I didn't expect regular brownies, but I don't even know where to begin to make them better...so I won't.  I made the recipe AS IS.  And No, just no.

Keeping in mind that these are low in fat and calories, they are quite good.  They hit the chocolate spot without all the guilt.

These were awful.  They tasted low fat and were dry, nothing like a brownie should be.  I threw them away.

I believe these are the make it yourself version of No Pudge brownies.  I would rather the low fat boxed mix which is higher in fat calories but at least has taste!

I traded the applesauce for 1/2 cup of coffee and used all purpose flour since I didnt have any cake flour. These kinda reminded me of the little premade brownies you buy in the plastic wrappers. I dunno it was good but different. I really like that it took very little ingredients and time but turned out fairly good.

I'm sorry, but these were really awful. The batter was so thick it was very hard to work with. I couldn't get anyone in my family to eat more than one bite. They were chewy, rubbery, and had little, if not awful, taste.

i found the texture was fine. not like brownies, true, but not bad, nice and light. i think the trick to making these really good is in the mixing, how long you beat the egg whites for, etc. I'll probably try them again with a little more cocoa or something. maybe some coffee.

I did not care for these.  I tried two batches to see if I did something wrong and they were just wrong.

You know to be fair its really hard to figure out how to rate these. If you're making this recipe in hopes they are gonna taste like the brownies You always make/eat, you're gonna be disappointed. If You make these knowing they wont taste like a regular brownies.. Then You will Enjoy it. I halved the recipe and made 12 Mini muffin sized brownies (baked up in 11 mins at 325). I measured all my AP flour and then removed 2 tablespoons replacing with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to make my own cake flour. Also added a pinch of salt and a generous splash of vanilla (coffee would be amazing too). Instead of chocolate syrup (thats not Healthy) i Just added a smaller handful of dark chocolate chips (melted chocolate would be great too). Also used coconut sugar instead of white. 
Texture wise they were on the chewy side but not terrible. Flavor wise they were good. Perhaps whipping up the Egg white separately and folding it in at the end would help the Texture. 
My 3 year old Enjoyed them and i didn't feel guilty having one at all.
