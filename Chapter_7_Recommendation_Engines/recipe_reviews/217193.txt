This was my first time making any type of baked Mac and Cheese, and it came out great.  Rave reviews from the hubby and kids.  The only changes I made to the recipe were:  I used 2 cups of evaporated milk instead of regular, added salt & pepper as I was mixing the macaroni and mixture together. I spooned half of the macaroni into the casserole dish and then added a layer of shredded cheese before adding the rest of the macaroni. I topped it off with  the layer of cheese as the recipe calls for, but also sprinkled some parmasean cheese and fine bread crumbs.  I would NOT skip the bacon - it just took the dish to the next level (I even added extra!)  Will make this again real soon!

I Made 3 alterations: 1) I added some fresh minced garlic (2 cloves) and 1 small yellow onion. Sautéed them with a touch of butter and added it into the cheese sauce. 2) used light cream instead of milk. It makes the sauce thicker so i didnt need the flour. 3) I added a tablespoon of the bacon droppings to the cheese sause for a little extra flavor.  Heavenly!!

Great Mac and Cheese recipe! A word of advice though is don't leave out the bacon. It adds the amount of salt that you need for this to be as delicious as it can be.

Oh gosh this was good!  I used shell pasta in this.  I tasted it before going into the baking dish and it was grainy (which is the problem I have ALL the time).  After baking the graininess went away and it was perfectly creamy, cheesy and bacon-y!  I did add a little panko on top before baking.  So happy I tried this one, it's a keeper!

My kids think that bacon should be its own food group, so they were all over this one.  I even used turkey bacon, and they still loved it.

Fast, easy, and simple flavors for kids.  I'm glad I undercooked the pasta by a couple of minutes - it was a bit overdone after baking with all that sauce.  I also seasoned with S & P as per other reviews.

I sliced bacon in 1 inch pieces and fried until crispy. Pour out all but a tbsp. of bacon fat and created the roux in the frying pan. Used whole milk and some whipping g cream, scraped up all the carmelized sugars left on the pan. Cooked until slightly thickened then added my cheddar. Used rotini pasta. Baked in oven . Wow so good

I fed this to my family, and they loved it.
I cooked it on my shift  at our local community lunchbox, and they raved about it and asked for seconds.  (Going to have to increase the batch by 1/3 next time).
I made it last week. My teenage son ate somewhere else that night, but when he and his friend came over next night   they ate all the leftovers (saved from the rest of the family), and his friend couldn't stop talking about how good it was.

I'd say this recipe is success.

DON'T LEAVE OUT THE BACON!

Tried it tonight and it was very good. I've been wanting to make some ever since Lays potato chips came out with bacon mac and cheese. That guy who though of that was a genius! The chips are great and so is the real deal!

It was delicious! We cooked our own bacon and used a while block of cheese. It's definitely a heavy meal. We will cook it again :)

This was a HUGE hit at a party!  I wanted to make something kid friendly,and this was perfect (the adults loved it too...they wound up using it as a chili topper).  I had to adjust according to what I had on hand and the amount needed.  Here's my alterations: used an entire box (probably about 2.5 or 3 cups) of Vegetable Elbo Macaroni...2 cups of flax milk and about a cup of cream (stirred in the flax milk first)...a litte over 2 bags (so over 4 cups) of shredded cheese (one cheddar, the other a mexican mix)...and about 8 pieces of thick bacon.  I also had great wisconsin cheddar so I shredded that on top before popping in the oven.  I'll definitely be making this again!  Oh, whatever you do, do not skip the bacon.  It's the key ingredient.  If you do then add seasonings, especially salt.

I made this for my daughter and she loved it so much that she requested we have it two nights in a row. I did add some bread crumbs to the top just before putting it in the oven which gave it a little extra flavor. Next time I will add some salt and pepper and a bit more cheese mixed in just for a bit more flavor.

This was just so-so for me. As a matter of fact, everyone liked this EXCEPT me. Simply put, this was bland and too creamy for my liking. While I don't care for dry mac & cheese (it needs SOME sauce), I don't like overly saucy mac either. My second issue was with the sauce. It was a *tad* grainy (I'm the only one who noticed this tho...), but I attribute this mishap to cook's error. :) I apparently didn't allow my cheese to melt completely. NOTE: Although your cheese will "appear" to have melted initially, keep stirring (on low heat) for AT LEAST 5 minutes to ensure that it is velvety smooth. Adding a dusting of crushed garlic herb croutons and some reserved bacon added a little pizzazz and is what everyone liked most about this dish. If for nothing else, this was SUPER easy to throw together for our neighborhood cookout. Thanks anyways, Kraft! :)

i liked it, way better then store bought cheese. it had a little bit flourie(sp?)texture, but i did see that i should have melted the cheese in the sauce instead of just mixing it in with the noodles. i used 2 spoons of extra butter because thats the way i always do my roo. Bacon was a great touch taste wise and gives it a splash of colour. i cheated and used bacon bits.

It was pretty good the prep time is a little longer than 20 minutes, but its pretty good with the combination of the bacon and cheese the bacon gave all the flavor to this dish "using bacon is a must" , I added some mozarella cheese on top along with the cheddar.

Made this tonight and it turned out really bland. Next time I make this, I'm going to make it my mom's way ... without the milk and just use onions, more bacon, and more cheese.

Delish! I took Brian M's suggestions & added garlic & used heavy cream & eliminated the flour. It took a little extra to cook but I got rave reviews! I also added extra bacon as my husband is a self proclaimed baconholic! 
This is a keeper for sure!

I made this for thanksgiving and it came out great. I think in the future I would use twice the amount of bacon because I felt there wasn't enough. Very easy to make too.

I quadrupled the recipe.
Used light cream instead of milk.
Used 4 cups of max n cheese blend, 2 cups of extra sharp cheddar and 1.5 cups of shredded parmesan cheese in the sauce.
I added 4 tablespoons of bacon grease to the rue. 
I also added a layer of shredded extra sharp in the middle and a layer on top with some parmesan cheese and panko bread crumbs.
Came out rich and delicious!

Thank you for this recipe.  I added little salt, pepper and hot sauce to the sauce.  I added extra cheese with the layers of macaroni.  I also used quite a bit more bacon, which I added to the top of the casserole.  The family loved it.  This will be my new mac and cheese recipe.

This recipe was really good. I would have given it five stars if the ingredients list had included salt and pepper. Fortunately I tasted before putting it into the oven, and it really need that salt and pepper to be complete.  My son (a picky eater) said he gave it 4 stars, adding that's because it'd have to be really amazing for him to give it 5 stars. Still, with that said, I thank you for taking the time to post and share this recipe.

I didn't have bacon so I made it without but still really tasty! I did add salt and pepper to taste. It probably doesn't call for it because the bacon would add the salt but I think it needs it. Will definitely make it again. And definitely with bacon!

Simply delicious!  Used maple flavored bacon (just what I had on hand) and a full 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese in the sauce.  Added some shredded mild cheddar on top before baking.

I used the leftover bacon fat instead of butter and also added garlic powder, onion powder, pepper and cayenne pepper to the cheese sauce. It was delicious!!! Highly recommended!

I did a few modifications which made it very unhealthy but still awesome!  I didn't have elbow on hand so I used gluten free bow tie pasta and, since our family likes a variety of cheeses, I added a few extra.  I cut the cheddar in half and added some monterey jack, parmesan, and a dollop of cream cheese in it's place, stirring in a little salt and ground pepper as others recommended.  I also cut the milk to 1 1/2 C and added 1/2 C half and half.  Because I like to cook gluten free, I used corn starch instead of flour.  It was fabulous and I will be making it again!  :-)

This was very good! We added ground beef to make a bit more hearty.  It worked well with gluten-free rice noodles and GF all-purpose flour.

I added about 3/4 cup milk too, as the cheese thickened too much. Also as per another review added the pack of cheeses from a KD package, and bread crumbs. Maybe sliced tomatoes too on top  next time - delicious

Boyfriend Approved; however, I will make more next time. Batch was rather small, didn't fluff up as much as I planned. Still great though. I will also add less butter next time.

This is so easy and tasty.  I appreciated the fact that the bacon added nice flavor without overpowering the dish.  I used a package of cheese ends I got at the deli which was a mish-mash of different cheeses instead of plain cheddar and it worked perfectly.  I added all the cheese to the milk mixture and topped the casserole with buttered cracker crumbs as a personal preference.  It was creamy and delicious.  Added note:  This is also a hit made with Johnsonville Breakfast Sausage instead of the bacon.

I used half and half instead of milk. And pepperjack cheese.
