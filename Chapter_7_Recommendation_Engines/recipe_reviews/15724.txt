This is an AWESOME recipe!  I take it to most pot-lucks that I go to and everyone raves about it.  I am not very good at rolling out pie crust to begin with, and do have some problems getting this monster crust on this, but I have solved the problem by making a little extra dough, so I don't have to roll it out so thin.  I also add about a teaspoon of freshly ground nutmeg and a dash of cloves for a little extra flavor.  

There is way too much frosting for my taste, so I cut the frosting in half, drizzle it, and then add a few sprinkels of cinnamon sugar before the frosting sets.

This is one super recipe.   It is difficult to roll all that pastry for a large pan so I usually use 2 - 8 inch square pans and that makes life a lot easier.

SERVED THIS FOR THANKSGIVING DESSERT & IT GOT RAVING REVIEWS FROM THE FAMILY--IT WAS LARGE ENOUGH SO EVERYONE GOT A PIECE OF PIE--WE SERVED IT WARM A LA MODE!!  MIXED ALL THE CRUST INGREDIENTS USING MY KITCHEN AID WITH THE DOUGH HOOK WHICH WAS VERY EASY--TO DO THE BIG BOTTOM CRUST, PUSHED PARCHMENT IN 15 x 10 PAN TO CREASE SIDE EDGES AS A GUIDE FOR SIZE, THEN ROLLED OUT DOUGH ONTO PARCHMENT LARGER TO HAVE AN OVERHANG & RETURNED IT TO PAN LEAVING PARCHMENT TO LINE PAN, THEN ALSO ROLLED TOP CRUST ONTO PARCHMENT & IT WAS EASY TO TRANSFER CRUST ONTO TOP!  WILL DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN ESPECIALLY WHEN SEVERAL SERVINGS ARE NEEDED!

I love this pie! I made two pans for family members on Sunday. They raved about it. The one thing I learned about making the crust, you must use solid shortening. Please do not use liquid the crust becomes too wet and hard to handle. I plan to make again soon. Thank you Brenda for sharing this receipe.

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  I had my hardest time working with the dough.  I finally gave up and threw it out.

Gosh, I hate to say this but I'm an experienced baker and I had trouble getting the large size crust that the recipe calls for. I ended up putting the crust in a smaller cake pan.  Also, I had special ordered from back East, spy apples as in my experience this is the best apple for baking.  However, it seems they cook up faster than others, as in 50 minutes my apples were too mushy.  So, would I make this again.  I just don't have the energy and a basic apple pie is faster.  I did substitute some lemon juice to add to the xxxx sugar and I think that's preferable to the vanilla.  Adds a hint of tartness.  Good luck to everyone who tries this pie.

Hoping the pie itself turns out better than the crust, ended up scratching the crust and using my own recipe.

This pie is delicious! I made it last summer and am now making it again for all my co-workers. Everyone who's had it loves it.
