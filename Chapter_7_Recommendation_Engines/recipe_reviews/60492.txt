There is an obvious error in this recipe that has been noted by many other reviewers that has to be mentioned.  You would not cook a pork tenderloin for 3 hours as stated.  They need about 20-30 minutes per pound.  If you take this into consideration, this recipe is really good.  I followed the recipe as directed except I only baked it for about 1/2 hour, then poured off about 1/2 of the apple juice and then covered the meat with the apple butter mixture and baked about another 45 minutes to an hour at the most.  After it was done, I sliced the meat, plated it and drizzled just a bit of the cooking sauce over it.  The meat picks up so much of the flavor.  Everyone just loved it.  I served it with Cheesy Mashed Potatoes and acorn squash.

This was really good!   My husband and our dinner guest both loved this dish, as did I.   The apple  butter and the spice complemented the pork nicely....pork seems to beg for fruit.

***One note I will make about this recipe....The cooking time indicates that the recipe is actually for a boneless pork *loin*, not a pork *tenderloin*.  I work in a meat market and people refer to pork *loins* as *tenderloins* quite frequently.   They are actually two different cuts of meat, the *LOIN* is from outside the curve of the rib bone and the *tenderloin* is from the inside of the curve of the rib bone.  A pork *loin* when sliced will yield slices that are roughly 3" by 5".   A pork *tenderloin* will yield slices slightly larger in diameter than a silver dollar.   A whole pork *tenderloin* will cook in 35-40 minutes at 350 degrees.  If you cooked a *tenderloin* for the time stated in the recipe you'd wind up with a weapon, not a roast.   Sorry to sound so preachy...this is a wonderful recipe!

This was fabulous!  I put a 2.5 pound roast in the crock pot and then dumped all the other ingredients on top.  An hour before it was ready, I added a cornstarch/water mix that made a great, thick gravy (to me, it made the dish).  After 6 hours on high, I needed a spoon to get the loin out of the pot because it was fall-apart tender!

I put everything plus a sliced apple in the crock pot on low for 8 hours.  I then took the roast out and sliced it.  I reduced the juices on the stovetop and added 1 tsp. of corn starch to make a gravy, which I served with mashed potatoes.  Very yummy, and oh-so-easy with the crock pot.

Hi all,  I'm the author of this recipe.  Sorry for the confusion on the baking time.  Believe it or not, I DO use tenderloin (oops on the title) and I DO bake it for the time I specified.  I, however, like pork to be overcooked and completely falling apart in the juices.  I should have specified that less time could be used.  I aplogize; this was my first contribution to this site.  Enjoy!

This recipe produced a very flavorful pork tenderloin. I used apple cider instead of juice, and a disposable roasting pan (easy clean up!). Based on the reviews, I cooked at a reduced temp of 300, adding the apple butter mixture after about an hour (internal temp was around 110). By the 2 hour mark, the temp had reached 170 and was quickly shooting past...the center-cut slices were still quite juicy but the end cuts bordered on dry. I'll need to watch more carefully next time. I made a gravy with the remaining cider/drippings -- to make, pour what remains from roasting pan into a saucepan, whisk in a cornstarch/water mix (dissolving cornstarch seperately first helps prevent lumps, start with about 4 Tbs cornstarch) and bring to a boil over med-high heat, whisking constantly until thickened, adding more cornstarch if needed to achieve desired consistency.  I never expected it but the gravy is what made this recipe a hit with my guests - it's a tremendous flavor booster and helps band-aid any dry slices!

I made this pork loin for a Sunday dinner for my new in-laws.  It turned out GREAT!  I did marinate the pork loin in the apple juice, with the apple butter mixture on top, overnight.  I baked it in a 350 degree oven for 90 minutes.  It was great while company was here because I could take it out of the refrigerator and throw it into the oven.
The pork was very, very moist!  It has a nice spicy flavor that was not too overpowering but it was just enough.  I've added this recipe to my collection!

I love pork loin, and this was a great way to make it.  I made the same amount of sauce, but only cooked one 2.6 lb piece of meat.  I put the sauce on before I put the meat in the oven, rather than waiting part way through the cooking.  Because of the smaller meat size, I only cooked it a little over an hour (for pork loin, I always figure on 30 minutes per pound).

There's an error in the baking time- the summary shows "four hours" while the text shows 3 hours. I don't think this recipe requires even 3 hours. A 1 1/2 pound tenderloin in my area comes in two pieces. I baked for 2 tenderloins (4 pieces, total weight 3.75 pounds) two hours total and it came out fully cooked and juicy. While I didn't make gravy from the cooking juices, I think it would be an excellent base and would be wonderful over mashed potatoes. This recipe is very easy- great when you are busy on a Sunday getting ready for the work week. Will definately make again.

The flavor of this meat was excellent.  I cooked it for 90 minutes as that is when it reached 160 internal temp.  Half-way through, I drained most of the liquid and spread the other ingredients on top of the meat.  I was pleased, but not completely.  I'm certain that I will continue to use this wonderful mix of ingredients, but I will cut the juice or cider down to 1 cup (or less), add the remaining ingredients on top, and cook it SLOWLY on low in a crockpot for maximum flavor and tenderness.  Thanks!

Very good fall recipe.  We live close to an area called Apple Hill, which is aptly named for the variety of apples the region produces.  The ability to buy fresh pressed juice or cider just enhanced this recipe beautifully.  I did note that many reviewers used a pork tenderloin, though the recipe actually calls for a pork "loin", which definitely makes a difference in the cooking time.  Made a slurry and added it to the juice from the finished pork loin for a thicker "gravy" and served it with an apple chutney on the side. 

PLEASE NOTE:  For those of you partial to a crock pot, this recipe is just as good in a slow cooker as the oven.  Thank you UMich97 for a nice addition to my fall recipe collection.

This recipe is wonderful!  Very festive, perfect for a family meal.  We enjoyed it for our Christmas Dinner!  I altered the recipe by using 12 4oz pork loin chops (3 pounds total, like the recipe).  I pierced the chops with a fork and marinated overnight in apple juice.  Before cooking, I laid out the chops in a baking pan, sprinkled with a little seasoned salt, and poured about a cup of apple juice around the chops.  I cooked for 30 minutes at 350, then drained 75% of the juice.  Then I doubled the apple butter mixture and spread a thick layer over each loin chop.  Then back in the oven for 30 more minutes.  Then I turned the oven to broil for about 10 minutes to finish.  These loin chops were delicious!  Amazing flavor, and fork-tender!  Loved by all!  Will definitely make again!

REALLY great recipe! For those mothers out there with picky eaters this recipe is VERY kid friendly.  I have a very finicky 3 year old who refuses to eat almost all meats & she gobbled this up.  Also, I was really tired when making out the shopping list for this recipe & I accidently thought that the recipe called for apple sauce & not apple juice...b/c I didn't have any on hand, I just used the apple sauce & threw all the ingredients in my slow cooker (thanks to the other reviewers for this idea).  Because I used apple sauce I found the gravy was thick enough and didn't need to thicken it after it was done as many have noted a need for.  Thanks for submitting this recipe...I will definitely be making it again!

There is a LOT of confusion here regarding the difference between pork LOIN and pork TENDERLOIN. They are NOT the same thing! This recipe uses a PORK LOIN ROAST, part of a whole pork loin. A pork loin is large and has a good fat layer on one side. Pork tenderloins are small, around 1 to 1 1/2 lbs. each, and come two to a cryovac package. They have no fat.
I have prepared this recipe using my homemade (cooked in a 30 gal. copper kettle about 17-18 hours over an open wood fire) apple butter, it is very good and I highly recommend it.

My family LOVED this recipe!  I'm not usually a big fan of fruit/meat dishes, but this one was different and oh so very good.  I actually stuck the seasoned pork and apple juice in the crockpot on low for about 7 hours, then added the apple butter mixture the last hour or so and it just fell apart.  I'm going to make it again for our Christmas dinner!

Simple and delicious.  I put a 2lb pork loin roast in a slow cooker for 6-8 hours on low.  I also slice an apple into quarters, remove the seeds and lay them on top of the roast to help keep the top from drying out while cooking.  My hubby and I both love this and it's easy to throw together in the morning before I leave for work.  Great flavor!

I followed this recipe exactly (2 loin roasts [not tenderloin] that weighed 2 lbs. each, seasoned salt instead of just salt to season, 3 hours, etc.) and it was PHENOMENAL!!  served it with rice and sauteed cabbage.  A Hobbit meal if I've ever had one =)

The error may be that they are talking about pork LOIN which is a much bigger cut of meat rather than the TENDERLOIN which is much small. The supporting evidence that I have is the following... In the picture, the slices of pork are way too big. Thay are obvious slices off of a LOIN. Pork LOIN which is an awesome part of the pig is actually about 4-6 pounds, but butches often cut them in half and sell them that way in the grocery stores. The Loin, if over cooked @ 165F, is a little dryer than pork tenderloin. The only reason people tell you to cook pork well done is because in the early days you could get trichinosis.

This was wonderful!  I used the gas grill to make this dish.  I rubbed the pork loin with the seasoning salt and then marinated it in the apple juice for 30 minutes.  I then grilled the pork directly on the grill for about 30 minutes, rotating the meat every 10 minutes.  Then I set the pork loin in aluminum foil, raising the sides, and poured the apple butter mixture over the top and grilled until done(about another 30 minutes).  My family and friends loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Did not want to heat my house using the oven so slipped this in my slow cooker. After rubbing the pork with seasoned salt i placed in cooker with apple chunks then added other ingredients. Awesome stuff. and made perfect gravy If using slow cooker and apple chunks I might cut the liquid to half.

My kids loved this....I thought it was good.  I make a lot of crockpot pumpkin applebutter every fall so this is a nice way to use it....the juice did make for a nice gravy which we used the next night when I chopped the leftover meat and added it to the gravy with 4 Tbl. of apple butter.  Then we pourd it over egg noodles!  Another pleaser.

All I can say is WOW! Very, very good flavor. I used a 4.8lb Pork loin and cut it in three equal peices. Marinated them in apple juice for about six hours and then followed directions. One and a half hours is plenty! Don't over cook it or it will be dry. Family loved it and I will make it again for sure. Easy and oh sooooo good!

I made this in the crock pot on low for 4 hours, adding all ingredients at the beginning. I doubled apple butter, cinnamon and cloves. The last hour I added 2 sliced apples. I removed some of the juice adding corn starch and made a gravy. It was awesome.

I cooked this before and it was great, but I made a few changes and made it better...................................................................................
--When marinating the meat I added a dry pork rub with a little spice, a little Worcestershire sauce to tenderize, liquid smoke, 1/2 the amount of apple butter with barbecue sauce rather than excess apple butter...............................................................................................

---Then I used real apples instead of the mushy sauce ( I used a Gala apple--its naturally sweet and crisp--and does well in a crock pot) ,red potatoes, and carrots to absorb some of the flavor from the brown sugar, cinnamon and cloves (I used what the recipe originally called for). 

The real apples tasted like spiced apples with the meat, and the potatoes and carrots complimented it very well!!! Husband loved it, even more this time!

To everyone out there claiming the timing is wrong.  The timing is for a loin roast, not a tenderloin.

I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars because I ended up following the instructions of another reviewer who indicated that some of the recipe (previously from Southern Living) was missing from the instructions.  I followed those instructions and had great results, although I think it could've been less cooked, perhaps 145 degrees instead of 160.

TASTY!!!!! Mixed everything together, poured it over a 3 1/2lb pork loin in the crock pot. Cooked on low for 6 hours, poured juices from crock pot in a sauce pan with a mixture of cornstarch and water to make a delicious gravy that was poured generously over the sliced pork loin. Served with butternut squash and green beans and warm yeast rolls. YUM!!

I used this recipe on boneless pork chops and it got rave reviews.  It is very easy to prepare and presents nicely.  I have no doubt that it will be great using tenderloin as well.

Ive made this recipe quite a few times now and my family loves it! Even my picky husband! My brother-in-law made my sister call me for the recipe the day after I made it for them! The only thing i do differently is omit the seasoning salt since my husband is watching his sodium intake! This is a great change of pace for those that do the same thing all the time with pork!

I made this recipe for my hubby & in-laws.  I think they are always nervous because I always try new recipes.  But they were happy = )  I followed others' advice from the comments & made the gravy- that really did totally make the meal.  My husband didn't use the gravy & said it was almost on the dry side, but good. I combined reviews I read & made it like this:  I pricked with a fork several times & sprinkled with the salt, added the apple juice, & marinated for a half hour (will try longer next time). I then baked for 20 minutes poured off 1/2 the liquid (I did this because I used a small roasting pan & the liquid almost covered the meat- next time I'd use a bigger pan & keep all the liquid), covered with sauce mixture & baked for another hour until temp reached 160. This was my first time making gravy (I know crazy!  I've always avoided that job), I was nervous, but it turned out great!  (hard to mess up such a sweet yummy sauce)  I just poured most of the drippings into a sauce pan & added the cornstarch/water mix (first I dissolved 4 tablespoons of cornstarch in 1/2 cup of water), then I boiled over med-high heat until I guessed it was done.  If you try this recipe, make the gravy- Yum!

Excellent recipe. I followed directions with exception of cooking time. I just kept checking temperature with a meat thermometer. I took it out at 155 degrees. After resting, temp was 145. Meat was tender and juicy. Flavor outstanding. I followed others recommendations and made gravy to accompany the meal. Worth the time and effort making this deicious home-cooked meal.

I had to cheat because I ran out of time, so I cut the loin up, mixes the apple butter portion up and put over it then cooked it on an electric skillet turning several times.  It took less than 15 minutes and was awesome with carrots and rice!!!

I marinated tenderloins overnight in the apple juice.  It was tasty and a good fall/winter recipe, but my husband did not care for the sweetness.

Excellent.  I made in the crock-pot by just throwing all of the ingredients in and cooking for about 8 hours.  After cooking, I wrapped the tenderloins in foil to preserve juiciness, and took the remaining juice and made a gravy.  It was awesome.  I will make this over and over again.

Absolutely delicious!!! I would give it even more stars if I could. I did not have seasoning salt (not even sure what that is) so I just mixed together salt, pepper, paprika, celery salt, onion powder, garlic salt and oregano and sprinkled the mixture over the meat. I took the advice of other reviewers, and reduced the cooking time by half. And the meat turned out just perfect. Soooo tender.
I also made a sauce out of the juices by adding corn starch. It went great with the "Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes" from this site.
Thanks for this great recipe. It instantly became my husband's favorite pork dish!

Okay, the cook time is off. It only took 1 hour (2 servings). The results were better than I hoped. It was moist and extremely flavorful. It will most certainly be a mainstay in our home.

I had a 1.3 lb pork loin, i marinated it in apple cider and cinnamon and cloves for about 24 hours. I roasted it for 30 minutes fat cap side up on a roasting rack above the marinade while covered in foil at 375, then removed the foil, flipped the roast, coated the other side with apple butter/sugar/spice mixture (omitted the water, used half the recommended apple butter) roasted for another 40 minutes at 350. DELICIOUS!

This was really great!  I threw it all in the crockpot (1 1/2 with a 6 lb roast) and cooked it on low for about 10-11 hrs.  I skimmed the fat off the juices when the meat was done and brought it to a boil with a cornstarch slurry for gravy - delicious!!  I didn't add any salt - it didn't need it at all.

I'm not a big fan of fruit and meat combos but this was very good. There were several comments about the cooking time.The recipe does call for pork loin roasts not tenderloins, so therefore the cooking time was perfect for very tender and delicious roast!

Made this specifically for my boyfriend. He loved it, which was the point. I didn't care for it. The cut of meat was so lovely, and the sauce smelled fantastic, but I just don't enjoy sweet with my savory. My kids who are meat eaters cried when I told them they had to take three bites before they could leave the table. I think it's just a matter of taste. Also, I cooked it for 45 min, then about another 30-40 uncovered. It would have been horribly dry if cooked for three hours.

This is a great recipe, but I always do it in a slow cooker and I use a pork butt. Great fall flavors, everyone always loves it.

This is fantastic! I had to make a few changes though because I couldn't find pork tenderloin at the store (they were out.)  I used Pork Sirloin roast instead and cooked it covered in the oven at 225 for 3 hours (It was 3.5lbs)  I marinated the pork overnight in apple cider (instead of apple juice), brown sugar, cinnamon and cloves).  I did everything else in the recipe as directed, just substituting the apple juice with apple cider.  This is by far the BEST meal I have ever made. I live currently in a generational home (grandmother, mother, brother, uncle and my husband) and everyone was RAVING about how great it was. It was so tender.  Also, I made gravy from the drippings. It was FANTASTIC! You have to make the gravy, it makes something that is already great into something amazing!  I'm making it again tomorrow for a friend. I'm sure it will be just as great this time.  Thank you for the recipe!

Yummy!  I dumped all of the ingredients into the crock pot and four/five hours later, I had delicious pork.  I shredded it with a fork and served over garlic mashers.  YUM!

The error is with the cooks who substituted the called-for boneless pork loin with pork TENDERloin, which is a completely different cut of meat that will cook much faster than a pork loin. The tenderloin is a thinner, much leaner cut, whereas the pork loin, aka pork center loin roast or center cut pork loin roast, is at least 2-3 times thicker, has fat on it, and is a little tougher than the tenderloin.  Hence the recipe's direction to cook for the additional 2 hours ***OR*** until fork-tender.

Being from Lancaster County, PA with a great fondness for apple butter, I had to give this recipe a try. I made it for a friend who had just come home from the hospital. I did season the pork loin with a dry rub (not just salt) before placing it in the oven with the apple juice. I was torn with adding more spices to the apple butter, but did as the recipe stated; I may leave them out the next time. Also I will definitely be making a gravy from the pan drippings next time as well. Thank you UMich97 for posting this recipe; my friend, her family and I really enjoyed this meal! (Served with Mashed Potatoes & Rutabagas w/ Horseradish and Green Beans)

Made this in a roasting bag so added all ingredients at once.  Cooked for about 1-1/2 hours.  Turned out delicious and very moist.  No leftovers!  Will definitely make again.

I cooked this in a crock pot for 5-6 hours with sliced apples and pears (and lots of extra spices).  I left it on high for 3-4 hours and then dropped it to low until the rest of my meal was ready.   The meat turned out to be very tender and sweet.  I added corn starch 30 min before I wanted to take it out to thicken the sauce. It's a very easy recipe.

Delicious and tender.  It can also be made in the crock pot - just add everything all at once and cook on low for 6-8 hours.

I was not expecting much from this recipe after reading some of the negative reviews. I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not a big fan of sweet meats, but this one was surprisingly not as sweet as it sounded like it would be. I don't understand the idea of putting seasoning salt on the meat and then pouring the apple juice over it (which washes off the seasoning.) So, I did the opposite... pouring the apple juice over the meat and then seasoning it. I cooked 1.5 pounds of meat at 350 for 20 minutes, added the apple butter mixture, and returned to the oven for another 25 minutes. I made a sauce out of some of the juice, using a few tablespoons of cornstarch and some more apple juice. The whole thing resulted in extremely moist and tender meat and quite possibly the best tasting pork loin I've ever had. It was visually attractive, too; my boyfriend said it looked like something he'd get in a restaurant. The only thing I would do differently next time is to forgo the apple juice sauce and make more of the apple butter mixture instead to spoon over slices. I thought the apple butter mixture had a better, stronger flavor than the apple juice sauce I made.

This pork was amazing!! Husband and kids loved it. You could cut it with a fork. I used a 5lb pork loin, and cut in half,so juices would penetrate better. Cooked in apple juice for 45 min, then drained 1/2 of juice and added other ingredients. Only cooked for another 1 1/2 hours, and it was sooo moist. Thank you!!! Will definitely be making again and again!!

Fabulous recipe.  I made this with a pork loin (not tenderloin) and it was very moist.  I only cooked for 1.5 hours and that was sufficient.  The pan juices mixed with a little of the apple butter mixture and corn starch make an excellent gravy.

This was amazing! I took note to the cooking time as others had stated, and it only wound up in the oven for about 1 1/2 hours, and it was perfect.. tender.. oh my goodness, was it ever tender. Definatly a make again meal. Perfect with the cinnamon apple rice from this website as well. Yummy!

Excellent recipe. Very juicy. I did take heed to other reviews and watched the pork to make sure I didn't over cook it. I only needed about 1.5 hours. Keep your meat thermometer near by and take the pork out when it reaches 160 degrees.

This was really, really good.  I used a pork loin roast (bone in), since it was a lot cheaper than the tenderloin.  Definitely buy an aluminum roasting pan though!  I was late getting supper started so I cooked the roast in my pressure cooker with the two cups of apple juice and an additional two cups of water.  It took an hour to get up to 170 degrees F for a 3.5 lb roast, then I transferred it to the baking dish and basted on the sauce and cooked it for an additional half hour and the results were perfect.  My husband loved it...thanks UMich97!!

This was by far the BEST pork loin I  have ever had.  I am not a huge pork fan, but when I read the recipe I had to try it.  Everything went into the crock pot, cooked on low all day.  I didn't make gravy, just spooned the liquid over the meat and mashed potatoes.

I put the pork loin and all of the ingredients in a crock pot on low while I went to work.  The house smelled wonderful when I got home.  I transferred the pork loin to a baking dish with enough sauce from the  pot to a depth of about 1/2 inch, made another batch of the glaze to top the loin as directed substituting 2 tbsp of the crock pot sauce instead of the water, and cooked it at 350 degrees for about 15-20 minutes or until the sauce in the bottom of the pan reduces to a light syrup.  Keep the remaining sauce.  When it's served, we were adding the syrup from the bottom of the pan and some of the remaining sauce on the pork and cleaning the bottom of the pan with rolls it was soooooooo good.  Using a crock pot ensures the pork is extremely moist and falling-apart tender.  I'd give this 6 stars if that was possible.  

I calculated the fat at 2g per 4 oz. serving (the fat content of the pork loin).  None of the other ingredients I used had any fat.  Not sure where the 25 g fat comes from in the nutrition facts.  This recipe gets added to my heart-healthy menu.

Another beloved recipe! It took me three stores before I could even find anything resembling apple butter..I found a sugar free apple butter spread which i said it was better than nothing. Delicious! Highly recommend!

Not good. I halved all the ingredients since I was only cooking one small tenderloin, didn't use cloves b/c I don't like the taste to it. It tasted just like an apple pie which I nor my husband found very appetizing.

My family enjoyed this recipe quite a bit, though I may fiddle with it some more next time.  I reduced the cooking time to 20-30 minutes per pound for the tenderloin (total cooking time for my 1 1/2 lb tenderloin to reach 165 F was just under an hour at 350 - I put the apple butter mixture on after 30 minutes). When the pork was done, I removed it to a plate to rest and then took a mixture of 6 tbsp of cornstarch and 6 tbsp of apple juice (basically just make sure to use equal amounts, you can use more or less depending on how much liquid you have left) that I had whisked together and mixed that into the juice mixture left in the pan and brought it to a boil over medium low heat to help it thicken up. It made a wonderfully tasty gravy for the pork and my side dish of cheesy mashed potatoes.

This was really, really good pork!  I halved the recipe, so I only used one pork tenderloin.  I cooked it with the apple juice for 30 minutes (covered).  Then I drained off the apple juice/broth to use later for the gravy.  I spread on the apple butter mixture and added a little extra apple juice to the bottom of the pan.  I then covered and baked for another 45 minutes.  It was fork tender by the time it came out.  I added about 1 cup of chicken broth to the baking juices from earlier and thickend with cornstarch to make a gravy.  Next time I think I'll leave out the brown sugar as I thought it was a little too sweet.  I used homemade All Day Apple Butter from this site that I canned last fall for this.

Tried last Sunday, very tasty.  I used a whole pork loin cut in half.  It was a little dry and will try again but won't bake as long.

Very Good! I cooked it in a slow cooker along w/ some sweet potatoes.  Turning the juices into a sauce is a must, it just made it.  I used 1 T of corn starch and just let it boil off until it was a consistency I wanted.

This was quite good.  I cooked it as directed, just cut the portion size in half.  The cooking time is definitely off - for four chops, I cooked about an hour, and it is good I took them out when I did.  Any longer would have been a bit too dry.  However, they were fantastic.  My husband loved them.  I served with corn and stuffing.  I also made an excellent gravy with the juice from the pan and a mixture of cornstarch and water.  Kept stirring for about five minutes in a seperate pan until thick.  Thank you!

This was a very tasty dish!  I made it in the crock pot by dumping everything together, tossing in the tenderloin, and letting it cook for 4-5 hours.  The pork just fell apart, it was so tender.  The flavor was a hit with my family - we tend to like pork and fruit flavors together (check out the Cranberry Pork Roast recipe on this site, too).  I served this with mashed potatoes that we dumped the extra juice on top of.  You could even thicken it with cornstarch or flour if you like a thicker gravy.  This will definitely stay in my recipe box!

The taste was wonderful--I made it with a Butternut Squash Bisque that made for a fantastic dinner.  Ignore the cooking time altogether though.  Mine was at the right temperature after the first hour, but I put it back in anyway (don't make the same mistake!).

Interesting combination for a meat dish! The taste came out great - we actually baked the pork w/ apple juice in the oven for a little over 1/2 hour, then finished by moving them to the grill for a more smoked flavor. We brushed on the apple butter marinade while on the grill. They turned out great, but the apple butter marinade overpowered any hint of a smokey flavor.
All in all, this recipe was good - will make again!

Overall, good recipe. I chose to take the crock pot route like some others. I cooked a 1.8 lb pork loin for 4 hours on low. I had it sitting in the apple juice with the apple butter mixture on top. I used 1/4 tbsp of all spice instead of the cloves and cinnamon. The meat was cooked perfectly. However, I was disappointed that it did not have more flavor. That is the only thing I found bad about this recipe. Next time, I will marinate the pork overnight in a double batch of apple butter mixture and maybe substitue apple wine for apple juice.

This was the most tender pork i have ever had!  I used thick cut pork chops instead of loin and cut the cooking time down 50min.  I served with apple stuffing and candied carrots.  BIG HIT!!!

I bought a pork loin roast, the first time I have ever chosen that cut of meat.  I asked how to cook it, and the butcher just said, "Bake it."...not much help.  So, I looked up online recipes for cooking it.  This was my first choice...and what a wonderful way to begin cooking a "new" cut of meat.  The results were tender and SUPER-delicious!  The "au jus" was to die for!  I will use this one again...and soon, so my husband says!

This was tasty made with homemade apple butter.  Not for those who don't like sweet with their meat, however.  I'll make it again, but it won't be in the regular rotation.

THIS WAS SPECTACULAR!!!!!!  Followed the recommendations of other reviewers and baked a ~3 lbs tenderloin for about 1/2 hour, then poured off about 1/2 of the apple juice/cider mixture (I used cider, as it was what I had), covered the tenderloin with the apple butter mixture, and baked for about another 1:15.  Absolutely brilliant, and the leftover juice makes a lovely gravy when mixed with the drippings, and a bit of cornstarch- just be sure to mix it at the last minute!!!!  My picky eaters devoured it, and the leftovers were still moist after reheating!

This was DE-LISH!!  Turned out so very tender!  I added a chopped white onion below the pork and it really cut some of the sweetness, which I think could get overpowering.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5, because I think the Apple Butter, Clove and Cinnamon amounts need to be reduced just a bit - but overall fantastic dish!!

This was a very tasty dish except remember not to follow the cooking instructions. If you do your going to end up with leather for dinner. I cooked this in a slow cooker for 7 hours. It was tender, juicy, and delicious.

Great fall meal!  Super easy to make.  I just added all the ingredients in a crock pot and cooked on high for about 4 hrs...then left it on low until we were ready to eat.  It fell apart :)  We shredded up the leftovers and made pulled pork sandwiches for the next day.  The only change I MAY make next time is to reduce the apple juice by 1 cup and add in a cup of chicken broth for a more savory flavor.

This is a great fall meal. I used a very small pork tenderloin (less than a pound) and marinaded for about 4 hours. I cooked it for 30 minutes, adding the apple butter mixture after 15 minutes. I also reserved some of that mixture to serve with the pork. Very yummy, hubby and I both liked it a lot.

After all of the confusion about cooking time here is what I did.  1. Baked a 1.5 lb. pork tenderloin for 1 hour at 350 and cut ingredients in half.  2. Seasoned the pork with a mixture of S&P, garlic, and red pepper. A little bit of spicy worked nicely with the very sweet topping  3. Poured in 1 cup apple juice and baked covered for 30 minutes. 4. Removed cover and spread apple butter mixture on pork. I did not add the cloves to the apple butter mixture because I didn't realize I was out of them, but the apple butter had some in it already and it worked out fine.  5. Recovered pork and baked for another 15 minutes. Removed cover and finished cooking uncovered for the last 15 minutes 6. Removed pork from pan and used juices to make a sauce. 7. Made the sauce by adding a slurry of 2 teaspoons cornstarch mixed with 2 teaspoons water to the juice and brought to a boil to thicken and then drizzled over sliced tenderloin. I really liked it the dish and husband said he would eat it again. Might use a little less brown sugar last time as apple butter is already very sweet! Delicious!

I have always enjoyed apples and pork. I make my own apple  butter,with chunks.Good for cooking and even on toast, I don't use too much brown sugar, alittle vanilla,sometimes a little homemade syrup made with a dash of Crescent mapeleine maple flavor. I like the slow cooker. The way I get the crusty brown, put my pot on high right away, add my onions, let them build to sizzling and add a few apple slices ,sizzle again. When it's dark enough for you add your "decorated" roast,as my granddaughter would have called the rubbed with seasonings roast. I am dividing a large roast into 3 pieces to freeze 2 for later use since I am buying things on great sales and budgeting meals and this fits all my needs and wants, thanks so much!!!

I made this with a 4 pound pork loin and it came out absolutely fantastic!  The meat was very flavorful and moist!  I only baked it for an hour after I put the apple butter on it for a total of 2 hours.  I also had the oven set to 325 instead of 350.  This is a definite keeper!

A perfect fall dinner!  I used boneless pork chops so the cooking time was cut down to 40 minutes at 375 degrees.  I "marinaded" the pork in the apple juice for most of the afternoon, baked it in the juice for 20 minutes, then topped with the apple butter and brown sugar mixture and continued cooking for the remaining 20 minutes.  It was sweet, tender, moist.  A simple yet tasty dinner!

This was fabulous!!!  I followed the recipe exactly except I adjusted the cooking time.  The tenderloin was very moist and flavorful.  I served it with baked apples, wild rice and grilled asparagus.  Excellent, Excellent and Excellent!!

this recipe was wonderful after reading the reviews I made a couple of changes. to keep it from being to sweet - I added cayenne pepper to the apple butter mixture prior to pouring off the apple juice i spooned the apple butter mixture over the loin and then took a green granny smith apple and cut thin round slices and covered the entire loin sides & top with the apple rounds sealed it with tin foil and put it back in the oven.  IT WAS WONDERFUL! 

What to pair with this delectable apple loin: We had this for New Years so I took the rest of the apple & cubed it up and grabbed a small scoop of cranberries out of my Total Cereal box & tossed them in with my Cabbage that was on the boil - little bit of sea salt & some cracked pepper - this was a healthy & tasty twist on cabbage.  

Black Eyed peas of course this helped give it a hearty balance 

Corn Bread this was great with the apple butter gravy - Next time I will make a larger portion of the apple butter mixture to go with the bread there wasn't enough for everyone's preference. 

Nothing left over everything was consumed! Thanks for such a great recipe! Can't wait to make it again!

Tasty.  After placing the tenderloins in a slow-cooker, I just poured all the ingredients over the pork.  I cooked the loins on high setting for 4 hours.  I then used a mixture of corn starch and cold water to thicken the juices (right in the slow-cooker).   Serve with egg noodles and the green bean bundles (recipe on this site).  Your family will be impressed.

tried this last night, used 1 pork tenderloin (about 1 1/4 lbs) for just my husband and me.  cut all ingredients in half, and used allspice instead of cloves, which i didn't have in the house.  of course, the cooking time is way off.  i cooked it for 15 min, then spread on the apple butter mixture and cooked it for an additional 25 min, for a total of 40 min.  the last 5 min i left it uncovered.  it was very good, tender and juicy, we could it with our forks.  most tenderloins i've made tend to come out dry, but not this one.

I usually buy an 8-10 pound pork loin, cut it into 3 chunks, and save them to make this recipe. Followed directly, but with a rather large hunk of pork, this comes out beautifully. Pulls apart with forks, delicious taste! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I tried to like it, but it just wasn't that great. It just tasted like sugar to me, and I followed the directions exactly. I don't think I'd try it again.

This was perfect.  I added another 1.5lb pork loin and doubled the sauce.  Once the pork was finished cooking I took about 3 cups of sauce and added 4T of flour and brought to a boil on the stove for gravy.  It was awesome.  I have a family of 6 with 4 kids 7 - 11, and they all loved it.  I served with homemade mashed potatoes, steamed asparagus with a homemade cheese sauce.  Perfect family dinner.  Thanks! By the way, my son Justin wanted to say thanks!

Very good! Used apple sauce instead of apple butter and left out cloves but it was still a winner. Will use this recipe again soon.

This was really yummy.  Here's how I changed it.  I marinated it in apple juice and cinnamon with whole cloves stuck in the pork overnight.  In the morning I removed the cloves and put it in my crockpot.  I added the rest of the ingredients and slathered the apple butter mixture on top.  I cooked it on low for about 8 hours (just because that's when I got home - it would be done at 7).  It was so tender and so flavorful!  Everyone loved it!  I served this with garlic mashed potatoes and candied carrots.  YUM!

This is the absolute best recipe I have ever made(and that's saying something)!  My family just raved about the pork.  They even encouraged me to open my own restaurant with this recipe as a feature item.  I know this will be served repeatedly to my family and company.  I served it with sugar snap peas and roasted red potatoes drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with Italian seasoning.  This is a KEEPER recipe no cook should be without.

I'd never cooked a pork loin before and this was easy and perfect.  It is going to be my secret recipe when company comes.  I loved the sauce that was left in the bottom of the baking dish--so sweet and wonderful.  It is also great b/c the recipe is easy enough to keep in my head.

I made this dish for my family and friends and they LOVED it. They all said it was the best pork they ever had. I was impressed! 

I seared the pork loin in advance in some olive oil, salt and pepper before putting in the oven. My mom said that might have assisted in the juiciness of it. Cooked it for 2 hours instead of 3.

I’m definitely making this dish again.

I followed this recipe nearly exactly and we think it turned out great.  I only used one pork loin, but when I took it out after an hour to spread the apple butter on it, it fell into two pieces, so cut back the second part of the cooking time by about an hour.  It was so tender!!  I was trying to slice the loin and it just fell apart; you could cut through it with the side of the fork.  Inside of the meat didn't have as much flavor as the outside, but the outside was AMAZING.  I found that spooning some of the juices from the pan over the meat helped the flavor.  I think next time I will shread the meat about 2/3 of the way through cooking so that all the meat gets that wonderful spiced apple flavor.  Very tasty, will be making again.

Pretty good!  Beware: the meat gets a really sweet flavor, so if you aren't a fan of sweet tasting meat, this isn't for you.  I made this in the slow cooker and it turned out great and allowed me to leave the house not worrying about the oven being on. My husband really liked it - he ate it for several days with no complaints.

This recipe was great!   I marinated it overnight in apple juice in the frig then followed the recipe exactly. My husband moaned with every bite and heaped great compliments on the meal.  I served it with baked sweet potatoes and frozen lima beans cooked with onion and sour cream (our favorite with pork). A new family favorite.

My family thought this was pretty good. I didn't change an ingredient, but I did use one pound less of pork tenderloin. I did follow some of the reviewers advice and baked it for 45 minutes with the apple juice, and then 45 minutes with the spiced apple butter. I also sliced the pork into individual portions almost all the way through the meat before baking. This dish wasn't overly sweet either, and it has a unique taste. Thanks UMich97!

On behalf of 30 Security Guards we rate this recipe as one of the best pork roasts that we have ever eaten. As a morale booster, I cook twice a week for the Security Guards on my shift and 10 active duty Army personnel to give them a break from Army chow and peanut butter sandwiches. They actually look forward to coming to work on the days that I cook. Thanks for this masterpiece. By request, I'm cooking it again this weekend and of course I have to times it by 6 in order to have enough.

YUM! YUM! It really was "fork tender".  I steamed rice and used the au jus from the pan to pour over it and also steamed acorn squash (cut in half) and then filled it with butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon.  It was a great combination.  Such a "comfort" dinner....I have given this recipe to several people who loved it as well as I do.  CUDOS!

This recipe was a hit with the whole family (we have some picky eaters). After reviewing the other reviews, I incorperated some of the sugestions into the recipe. I sliced the loin into serving slices almost to the bottom and cooked with apple juice covered for 45 minutes. Then I removed the cover and put the apple mixture into the slices then on top and cooked uncovered 45 minutes. Then made the juices into gravy.

Really great recipe!  Rave reviews from my husband!  I actually lowered the temp to 325 and cooked for around 1 hour 45 minutes.  I also added red potatoes after the first hour which was a great addition.

Not bad... a little dry. I think I overcooked it... I used boneless chops and baked for 20 minutes in the juice, and 45 minutes with the sauce mixture. Not too sweet, nice flavor overall. Not as pretty as I was hoping for; I flipped it so the sauce was down and my boyfriend ate it up!

My boyfriend made this for me for a special dinner - it was easy and very delicious!  We only had 2 pounds of tenderloin, and after 2 hours it was on its way to being overdone.  We had no problems with sticky pans - but we used a disposable aluminum pan anyways.  We should have made a gravy from the 'au jus' leftover but it smelled so good and we were so hungry we just dipped in the juice leftover.  What a great recipe for apple season!!!

I stumbled onto this recipe (and allrecipes) by accident a few years ago and I am glad I did. I have always enjoyed a good pork loin recipe and this has become my favorite.
It is really quite simple to make and the results are quite delicious.
When my son comes home from school for the weekend he often asks that I make it for him and when he goes home on Sunday afternoon I always pack some for supper since his cafeteria is closed on Sunday evenings.
One thing I would like to mention is the cooking time that several others have commented on.
When using a Pork Loin for this recipe the time is pretty much correct. If someone substitutes a Pork Tenderloin the cooking time will obviously be much shorter as tenderloins are smaller. While the recipe calls for a "Pork Loin" I would think that either a loin or a tenderloin could be used with equally tasty results but THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT CUTS OF PORK.
So do not cook a pork tenderloin for three hours and certainly do not eat a  pork loin that has not been sufficiently cooked.

We only cooked the 4lb  pork *loin* for 2 hours at 335 degrees; 1.5 hours covered with apple cider instead of juice, then a half hour uncovered after putting on the apple butter mixture (leaving out the water).  Very tender and great flavor; we all loved it.

I made this with a two pound piece of whole pork loin, not tenderloin. Roasting under foil in apple juice kept the meat tender and juicy while the apple butter mixture added a sweet and spicy finish. Served with extra apple butter and smashed garlic red potatoes, this dish was liked by all ages.

This recipe calls for boneless pork loin which is not the same as tenderloin. For that reason, many reviewers have mentioned the cooking time being off. The cooking time is correct for a larger, thicker boneless pork loin, as stated in the recipe. If you are making a tenderloin, you will have to reduce the cooking time. The seasoning of this pork is delicious though. The reviews should not suffer due to reviewers using a piece of pork that was not called for in the original recipe.

YUM! My husband gets to pick a "secret ingredient" for his birthday dinner each year. This year, he selected apples. I found this recipe and it was so good! I love pork. The apple butter and apple juice made this so juicy. Absolutely the best pork loin I have had in a long time!

Made exactly as written (except decreasing the quantity to one 2lb loin), including cooking time.  It turned out great, very moist with a nice flavor.  Makes great sandwiches too!

This is super great and super easy! My boyfriend loved and even are the left overs! I gave it 4 stars because it was a hair too sweet for me but I loved that it was extremely moist, even after reheating it in the microwave for lunch!

I made this for my family and in laws and they just loved it!  They said it was the best pork they ever had.  I had to make a change because I didn't have apple butter.  I sliced 8 small apples and lined the pork with those.  I used butter in place of the apple butter.  It still turned out amazing despite my lacking ingredients.  We are making this again tomorrow! Yum :)

This is an amazing recipe just as stated.  This is NOT pork tenderloin but Pork LOIN.  Pork loin is much larger than tenderloin.  Those who are stating there are errors in timing do not have the correct meat.

I followed the cooking directions in the most helpful positive review by Valerie's Kitchen, cooking my 3.78 lb. pork loin fillet at 350 degrees for approximately 20 minutes per pound. I used only 8 ounces of apple juice. Next time I will marinate the pork in the juice for several hours. I used my homemade apple butter, halved the brown sugar, and omitted the water. I served it with Garlic Mashed Cauliflower. Delicious!

Oh my, so good!!!  I made this in the crockpot.  I added the pork loin, all ingredients (using the apple butter mixture as a rub to coat the pork), and a sliced apple or two to the crockpot and cooked on low for much of the day.  I tried to use the juices to make a gravy as other reviewers had suggested, but never was quite successful.  This dish was amazing either way!

This recipe was AMAZING! I followed the recipe exactly as posted, I just made it in the crockpot instead of in the oven (it was a rainy crock-pot kind of day). I made gravy with the left over juices by adding a little cornstartch mixed in some water and this meal wouldn't have been the same without it! We poured it over our meat and our mashed potatoes, DELICIOUS. I will definately be making this again, thanks for the great recipe!!

Simple recipe yet my husband thought he was getting something fancy.  I cooked it based on weight as suggested by other reviews.  I used my homemade applebutter which is loaded with spices so I left out the sugar, cinnamon, & gloves.  It turned out wonderful.  I am wanting to try this in the crockpot next.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was so wonderful. Everybody loved it and had seconds. It literally did fall apart so we had shredded pork and put a little apple butter on top. I used the All Day Apple Butter recipe onthis site  I will absoloutely make this again. If only there was a way to give it more stars.

I used several tips from the comments and I froze it with half the marinade and rub on it.  I also added sliced or canned apples to the crock pot.  Great with cheesy potatos.
I hate pork BTW but I couldnt pass on a super deal at the supermarket.

I used on one pork loin (3lbs) so, I didn't need to cook it as long.  I did let it rest for quite awhile, covered.  I didn't use the spices and it really didn't need it.  It was really good and I'm not a fan of pork loin.  I will most definitely be making this again.

This pork loin is whole family pleaser! It's sweet and salty and tender too. And really, since no one eats apple butter any more it comes off as gormet! 

The flavor screams Fall time so serve with other fall favorites. I make it in a slow cooker and it turned out great, especially with the extra scuce on top.

Mine turned out a bit too dry, but that was my fault for letting it cook too long. Some had mentioned letting it slow cook in a crock pot for 6, 7 & even 8 hrs. When I checked mine at 5 hrs it was already 180 degrees. Check at about 4 hrs or U will be sad. The overall taste was really good. Made gravey from the bottom liquid as others mentioned, so was able to mask the dryness a little. I will make it again, but will start checking the internal heat a lot sooner. Served with a salad and Gourmet Sweet Potato Classic (very good) from this site.

I thought this was delicious, and actually it was better than I expected it to be.  I halved it and used one pork tenderloin that I baked until it was 170 degrees.  It was tender and delicious.  Before I cut the pork I scraped the apple butter off it and combined it with the aple juice, added some corn starch and water, and boiled it in a saucepan.  I poured some sauce over the meat, and also put some sauce on baked sweet potatoes.

A correction to previous reviews: the recipe calls for pork loin, not pork tenderloin. The tenderloin is a thin round muscle that is a part, not the whole, of the loin. It cooks much faster than a whole loin. The time given may still be too long for a loin; the best way to time your roast is using a meat thermometer - safe temperature for pork has just been lowered to 145 degrees.

My family loved this!  As previously noted by other reviewers, the cook time is WAY too long for a pork loin (no, not a tenderloin!).  I simply used a meat thermometer to get the loin the the temp I was comfortable and then took it out to let it rest.  I then made a gravy from the pan juices.  I will definitely make this again! :)

Perfect Fall meal. I served with butternut squash and it is really delicious. I sliced an apple and added it also some flour at the end to make a thicker gravy. I also used a slowcooker as other readers suggested. Made for a perfect pork meal. Thank UMich97!

Best pork I've ever made. Perfect for my fall family meal. I DID follow another reviewer and pricked the meat with a fork all over, sprinkled with salt then marinated it in apple cider overnight. I baked for an hour then topped with the apple butter mixture(which was pretty spicy already, so I left out the spices called for here). My family raved over it the whole night--even my father who is a picky eater. My mom and husband agreed it was the best pork they'd had as well. DO try this.

This was delicious. Seriously, I had read all the good reviews and it still exceeded my expectations.  What a great recipe. Cook as others recommended. The best strategy that was recommended was add apple juice/seasoned salt. Cook for 30 minutes at 350. Add the remaining sauce, cook for ~45 minutes to an hour at 350. Delicious. I served over egg noodles and poured the extra apple juice mixture on it, tasted pretty dang good.

This was so delicious I cant even describe it! I did adjust the cooking time, I put just the loin in the oven for 30 minutes with just the apple juice in the bottom and then after 30 minutes I put the apple butter glaze on it and cooked for an additional 1 1/2. I had 4 lbs of pork loin.Great recipie and blew my family away. Husband Loved it along with the kids!

I enjoyed this. I used a 1.5 lb pork loin, and I thought it turned out great. My son was a little squeamish about the apple butter, but he did eat it.

I made this last night, using a 3lb pork loin. I doubled the apple butter, brown sugar and spices since we like lots of 'sauce' and i wanted to make a gravy out of it. I dont understand why others say cooking the pork this long dries it out. I cooked mine at 350 for 1 hour in the apple juice, then spread the apple butter mixture over, cooked for another 2 hours, covered. it was so incredibly moist and just melted in our mouth. my husband raved about it, says it is the best thing he's ever eaten! like one of the previous reviewers said, i served this with the Cinnamon Rice with Apples from this site, perfect compliment to the flavors.

Pretty Good, I did change a few things though.  I left out the sugar, water, and spices.  Instead I seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and poultry seasoning.  Then I only used 1 cup of juice.  Covered in homemade apple butter and roasted until done.  Served with roasted red potatoes.

This came out excellent.  I followed a lot of suggestions from other reviewers though.  First, I used my slow cooker.  I had a 2.5 lb pork loin (not tenderloin) that I seasoned with seasoned salt.  I used apple cider instead of  juice.  I also added carrots and an apple to the slow cooker.  I put the apple butter on top of the loin so it kept the moisture in.  It cooked for about 9 hours on low (it could have come out sooner) and was very tender and tasty.  Super easy! My husband LOVED it.

Very good!  I put the pork tenderloin in a crock pot along with fresh carrots and cooked for 6 hours on high.  It was very tender and juicy.  I covered the carrots with apple juice and spread apple butter over the tenderloin.  I skipped the brown sugar as I felt it would be too sweet.  It made for a very easy meal that not only tasted good but smelled good as well.  When the meal was finished cooking, the tenderloin was surrounded in juice.  I thicken the juice with cornstarch and served as gravy.  Thank you UMich97 for sharing!

My 2.5 lb tenderloin came out dry and much of the sauce that dripped off to the side was burned.  My hubby said it was yummy (quite the feate)!  Be sure to spray the bottom of the pan with Pam or you'll be soaking your dish for a while like me.  I'll turn down the cooking time next time.

Absolutely delicious! I only made about 1.2 lbs and cooked it for about 45 minutes. It came out perfect. We made some garlic mashed potatoes with it and I think it's the best meal I've ever made. Definitely worth trying.  Oh and  take note of the other comments telling you the difference between loin and tenderloin. Three hours is way off if you're making tenderloin and I would have ended up with a brick formerly known as pork if I hadn't read them.

This has always been one of my favorite ways to barbeque pork loins.   I like to marinade the loin overnight with a dry rub of seasonings (try a mix of sea salt, cracked black pepper, garlic powder, cayenne, paprika, cinnamon, allspice and a little curry powder), then before cooking, mop on a thin coat of apple butter and brown sugar (about 1/4 c dark brown sugar and a tbs of dried onion flakes to 1 c apple butter).   As others have said, 3 hrs @ 350F is too much heat for too long, instead, use a remote meat thermometer and target internal temp of 156F.    Barbeque means going low and slow so on the pit it takes 4-5 hours at 200-225F, as soon as the the meat thermometer reaches the desired temp remove the loin from the pit and wrap in foil, then let it rest at least 30 minutes before slicing.  Flavors imparted into the meat from smoking can vary greatly with different types of wood but I usually prefer a "sweet" wood like maple or hickory for smoking pork.  Pecan offers a good for everything type of compromise between the sweeter woods and the spicier flavor of mesquite.  NOTE: Wood smoke will cause the outer 1/2" or so to appear pink, this is referred to as the smoke ring and does not mean the meat is undercooked, the center of the loin should be white and VERY juicy.

This is, hands down, one of my favorite pork loin recipes.    I tossed all of the ingredients into the crock pot, added cranberries and sliced apples to the mixture and cooked for 4 hours on high.    It was so tender it was falling apart as we tried to take it out.  My parents LOVED it (and they were a little wary beforehand).  It was VERY easy to make.

WOW!!! I cooked this in my crockpot as others suggested and it just fell apart as I was serving it. I used two 1.5lb tenderlions for a total of 3 pounds of meat. I also used 1 cup apple juice and 1 cup apple cider which gave it a bit more flavor. I thre in some apples as well. Once finished,I quickly mixed some of the the juices with additional apple butter and heated over the stove to spoon on top as a sauce/gravy. My 3 year old CLEARED his plate and my husband loved it as well. Will be making this often! We have a whole tenderlion leftover for tomorrow.

After it has been cooking for 1/2 hour I thought the times seemed a little long for pork tenderloin.  I went to the computer and looked at some of the reviews saying the time was too long.  I took the meat out of the oven and put a thermometer and it was 140º after 45 minutes.  I poured out 3/4 of the apple juice and covered the 2 pork tenderloins in the apple butter mixture and cooked it for another 1/2 hour.  I put the pork on a cutting board and poured the juices into a sauce pan and reduced it down for a sauce.  

The pork was outstanding.  It had such a good flavor. Definitely will make again.

I've made this a few times now, always with a tenderloin.  If cooking by oven, definitely adjust cooking time appropriately (45-1hr).  However, I've found there's just not enough time to simmer in the juice by oven - by far the best way to make this is to throw all ingredients in to a slow cooker.

Hubby and I usually like sweet meat recipes, and this one did not disappoint. I changed it up a little bit by using boneless pork ribs (they were cheaper) and adding two tablespoons of soy sauce and a bit of garlic to the Apple Butter mixture. The apple butter coated the ribs well and had a great flavor.

My only wish is that the apple juice would have penetrated the meat a little more. Still, though, VERY tasty!

The only thing I've ever done with this recipe is to double the sauce-it's wonderful! It smells great in the oven and it's so tender and moist! The sauce is so good we've used it on chicken and added chopped pecans with the same wonderful taste outcome! Wonderful job!!

Pretty good recipes, sweet though. I replaced the water with lemon juice to help tone down the sweetness of the dish. After I put the glaze on, I broiled for a few minutes (watching closely) to allow the mix to caramelize a little bit more. Father-in-Law liked it so definetly a good sign!!!

The flavor of this roast is fantastic.  I made it with some new potatoes with sage butter and green beans with almonds.  Can't give it 5 stars,though.  The cooking time was way too long.  I pulled the meat out of the oven at 2 hours and it was still pretty dry.

I just made this recipe this evening.  My wife and I loved it.  Great recipe.  I also made a nice gravy with the drippings; just desolve 2 TBSP of corn starch in 1/4 cup cold water and add to 2 cups of the drippings and salt and pepper to taste.  For this recipe, I used a 2.82 LB pork tenderloin.  Changed the cooking time to 45 Min. & 45 Min.  I use a digital thermometer and after resting for 10 min., we had a temp. of 155F.  This is a perfect medium rare (which is safe).  Great reciped.

I used a 2.5 lb pork chop and only 1 1/2 juice. After putting on the sauce (after the first hour) I only cooked it for another 15 min and it came out very tender and moist.  
Other Modifications:
Peach butter instead of Apple butter
Apricot necter instead apple juice. 
We will definately will make this again.

Awesome delicious family meal with mashed potatoes.  Put 1/2 t. nutmeg in the potatoes.  I make this recipe with a crock pot.  I roast the pork in the apple juice, drain the juice and use for gravy, then thinly slice the pork and pour the apple butter mixture over.  Delicious.

I made this for a group of friends and was a little worried about the outcome as I didn't try it first.  No worries!  This is a great recipe and a keeper.  I've since made for my family of 5 and everyone loves it.  Haven't changed a thing!

This was really good! The only changes I made were that I used an apple green tea beverage (which is half apple juice) in place of the apple juice because I already had it and I made a second batch of the sauce after I tasted it.  It was nice to have on hand when we reheated the leftovers the next day.  Didn't need it really, but it was so good!  Oh, I should mention that I marinated my two tenderloins in a brown sugar, apple butter and apple green tea mixture for 7 1/2 hours before cooking them as directed.  Delicious!  Easy and flavorful.  Makes the house smell of autumn and holiday spices.  I will be making this again... and definitely for guests.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

This is the best pork dinner I have ever made.  I used a 2lb loin roast and used the converter to modify the other ingredients. I still cooked the roast for a total 3 hours but turned it down to 350 for the last 2.  TENDER TENDER TEDNER.  The flavor was amazing.  Thank you. This is going to become one of signature dishes. Served it with mashed potatoes and broccolini.

40 minutes at the most for the first step, another 40 minutes for the second part. I reduced the liquid by 2/3 and threw in a can of pork gravy - Served with a side of cling peaches - Excellent!

I have always loved the combo of apples and pork, this did not dissapoint. As others stated the cooking length was a little long. I cooked for 45 mins, then took out of the oven.  I removed some of the juice and added glaze, lowered the temp to 200 and cooked for another 45 mins.  It was very moist, still tasted great the next day.

Cook time was totally off. Ended up burning the dish before even getting a dish (scaled to 2 servings). It smelled really good while cooking so I will try again at another time. Maybe I just didn't know how to scale down the time myself but in any rate it was a very burnt dinner.  Tried again this time mixed all ingredients and was put in the oven at the same time at 300 degrees F (2 servings).

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year instead of traditional turkey and it was a big hit.  It also filled the house with a wonderful aroma of apples and spices and made a beautifully presented entree.  I loved this recipe and will serve it many time.s

If you like a more complex flavor, this recipe isn't for you.  It was extremely bland even though I used both "spiced" cider & apple butter.  I ended up smothering the pork in chutney. And yes, the time is too long.  I cooked 3 lbs of pork tenderloin for about 1.75 hours, & it still was too dry.

Good recipe. Moist and it has such a unique and different flavor. I used country ribs, because those to me would turn out more moist in less time than a loin chop. I used my pressure cooker and put a bottle of applejuice and loaded the country style ribs in with several garlic cloves and onion powder, salt, and whole cloves. The flavor was amazing and the meat fell off the bone. I topped it with the applebutter sauce and baked in the oven for 30-45 minutes to set the sauce and it came out fantastic. My whole family enjoyed this recipe and I will make it again.

Maybe I did something wrong but we didn't find this recipe to be anything special.  I liked the flavor so I'll probably try it one more time and change the cooking method a bit. (I did already cut the time in half for tenderloins)

Great recipe for pork.  I think the apple butter really complimented the pork roast.  The only thing that I did differently was seasoned the meat with kosher salt, pepper and chopped garlic on the meat and roasted as normal.  My husband and son really liked it.  The apple butter sauce and pork was even excellent cold!  It is a keeper!

I am giving this a 4 star, but my family would probably say it deserves 5.  I accidentally made this with pork chops (boneless) not a loin and they turned out dry because of that.  But the flavor was very good.  I didn't put the cloves in b/c my family doesn't like the taste of clove, and I think that would've added to the flavor.  I liked it with some of the extra sauce poured over top.  I think I would make a little more of that next time to top them off with (the carmalized apple juice at the bottom of pan).  Try this, it's good!  Make the apple crisp for dessert!

Took a risk and made this dish for all my husband's family at the first Christmas we have ever hosted-and it was awesome!! Everyone loved it and it got rave reviews. I took the pan drippings, added some paprika and a little more apple butter, and reduced in a heavy saucepan for a rich, thick sauce that I served on the side. It was even better reheated the next day for sandwiches!

I love this recipe, and have reviewed, but just realized recently this was meant for pork loin chops.
I actually use this with whole roasts.  Bone-in, or loin rolls.
I adjust the apple juice to suit the size, and basically bath the roast in apple juice while baking.  Also, in my neck of the woods, apple butter is not available.  I use about 1 whole cup of apple sauce, and bake it as suggested.  I turn the roast using tongs (don't pierce the meat with a fork while cooking) and turn it in this delicious sauce.
One suggestion would be to use a tart juice, pref. organic, as some of the sweeter additive juices can make the meat very sweet.  The balance between tart juice and sweet sauce are spectacular.  Cooking this for Christmas tomorrow, and looking forward the usual and expected rave reviews!!

Delicious!  Cooking time is way too long, however.  Whoever submitted the recipe must have a cool or old oven.  I cooked one tenderloin (1.5 lbs) for 2 hours and it was too long - made it a little dry.  Flavor was fabulous though!!

Great flavor...I used all the same ingredients, but put it all in the crock pot in the morning, and cooked it on low for almost 10 hours.  It tasted great, but probably cooked a little too long.  It fell apart like a pork roast, not sliced like a tenderloin.  Anyway, I will make this again, but if I put it in the crock pot, I will do it for a lot shorter.

This was really tasty, and easy to make.  I, of course, changed the recipe, but in just a tiny way.  I used two pork chops instead of the tenderloins.  I baked for 15 minutes, then poured the apple butter mixture, then baked another 10 minutes.  That seemed to work pretty well for the recipe.  Quite a tasty little recipe here!

DELICIOUS!  Even my pickiest eater absolutely loved it.  Ended up cooking it for 60 minutes at 350 and lowered to 200 for 90 more minutes (until we had time to eat).  It was still tender and juicy after all that!  Thanks so much for a great recipe.

I am a private chef for a family, and I made this for a big dinner party recently. Everyone loved it, even the people who don't generally like pork. I used apple cider since we had some. We didn't have any ground cloves at the house, so I put some whole ones in with the juice as it roasted. A doubled recipe feeds about 18 and needs no added time as long as you use two pans. As noted in several other reviews, the baking time is far too long as listed. Mine were done in about an hour and a half or so.

Amazing!  The applebutter glaze on top was wonderful!  Next time, I will probably inject the meat with apple cider, cinnamon, and a dash of clove with my meat injector, just to infuse more of the flavor throughout the meat.  Otherwise, it was heavenly!  Served it with stuffing with the pan juices poured over it.  MMMMMMM

This is very good. My husband, who like lots of guys, does not care for fruit with meat... but he did like this. I seasoned with salt and pepper and Mrs.Dash table blend....worked great! Also, i baked one tenderloin a little over 1lb. at 400 degrees for 1 hour, covered for the first 30 mins. and basted frequently the other 30 minutes uncovered. Very tender.

I tried this recipe with high expectations, given the impressive rating on here, and was quite disappointed. While the pork was tender, none of the flavor penetrated the meat. I would have thought I made the sauce incorrectly, if it hadn't been for the wonderful smell in my kitchen. If I were to make this again (and that's a big if), I would try marinating the pork overnight in the fridge with all the ingredients mixed in.

This was really good.  It was a very mild dish, but very tender and my guests ALL went back for seconds!!  Personally I like a little more flavor to my stuff, but sometimes simple is best. It was completely done in under two hours (1:45) so watch that cook time!

I loved the sound of this recipe and thought I had the ingredients.  I only had cherry juice and cherry butter. I thought "What the heck" it's all fruit, it might work.  I also added one teaspoon of cocoa the the other ingredients.  The smell was fantastic while it was cooking. I cooked it covered with the juice for 45 minutes, then for 60 minutes (two 1-1/2lb loins), until it was 160 degrees.  It was absolutely delicious! My whole family loved it. I am calling it my black forest pork loin and it's a regular on my menu! I don't know if cherry butter is readily available, but I get it from American Spoon Foods during the Cherry Festival every year.  Thanks for the jumpstart!

Positively Delicious! I used center cut pork chops and reduced the baking time to about 1 1/2 hours. The key is the make sure the liquid doesn't evaporate. In spite of all the sugar, the apple butter sauce is not too sweet, it's just right and adds a pefectly balanced spicy and fruity complement to the pork. My husband (who does NOT like fruit with his meat) actually loved this dish. Can't wait to make it again!

I also reduced cooking time, and used apple cider instead of juice. I cooked it 1 1/2 hrs and even then it was overcooked, next time I will try it for an hour max. The flavor was great, though.

I had a 4 lb pork roast and I cooked it for 2 hours. Was cooked perfectly! I didn't have seasoned salt, so I used salt,  pepper, and paprika. Increased apple juice by one additional cup (due to my larger cut of meat) and used "heaping" 1/4 teaspoons of cinnamon and cloves. Next time, I'll use more salt, and slightly decrease cloves (tasty, but I think I used too much.) Would definitely make this again! 

ps: keep the leftover drippings from the pan for gravy!  delish!

I had to adjust the recipe only to fit the new roasting tips I heard over the holidays BUT I used all the same ingredients and this turned out spectacular!  I have no doubt the baking method in the instructions would lead to the same great meal.  I will make it again(once I get my hands on more homemade apple butter), both the original way (next time I have the time) and the roasted way if I need to serve dinner sooner than 3 hours.  Also important to note:  This recipe is for a pork LOIN.  Not a pork tenderloin.  Boy was I glad to find one for the loin because most recipes out there seem to be for the tenderloin.

Made it last night and loved it (kids too!). I couldn't find Apple Butter so I mixed apple sauce with Fig Butter and reduced it a little  bit, it came out perfect.  I am not a big fan of Cloves, so next time I make it I would use half only, it is very overpowering. 
It came out super juicy and tender too.

I made this in the slow cooker. I chopped 2 Granny smith apples and 2 honeycrisp apples and put them in the bottom of the pot, then  sliced one medium yellow onion into rings and placed those on top of the apples. I put the roast on top of that then poured in the apple juice. I put the glaze on top and cooked on high for 6 hours. Delicious!  I would also like to note that this recipe is for pork loin roast, not tenderloin. This came out juicy and pulled apart with a fork. Will make this again for certain!

I made the exact recipe and the pork was swimming in the 2 cups of apple juice.  Next time I am going to use one cup apple juice, spread the apple butter over the top and then seal with foil until the last 30 minutes.  Then I will remove the foil so that the apple butter becomes a beautiful sugar glaze.

OMG this was some of the BEST pork I have EVER had. Bought a 4.04 lb boneless pork loin cut it in half and cooked it exactly as directed. Will reduce the cooking time next time we make it (cause there will definitely be a next time). We added quartered red potatoes with it when we added the glaze. The potatoes soaked up the apple juice and tasted fantastic. Thank you for such an AWESOME recipe.

I have made this a few times.... Be aware... If you use a larger roasting pan, increase your liquid by at least half as it will evaporate to nothing.
Also watch your time because three full hours has been too long every time I make it.

My entire family liked this which is a rarity, as they all have very different tastes. My kids are super picky. I cooked as stated and did not reduce time or temperature. I did add a little extra juice, apple butter, and brown sugar bc I wanted to make a glaze with the leftover. Other than that I followed exactly. It fell apart and was super tender and with the glaze...omg! Thank you for sharing this one!

I made this exactly as written except for the time. I did 45 minutes then put the apple butter on and did another 45 minutes. I can't cook so if I can follow this recipie and have it come out delicious anyone can.  Will definitely be making this again. Yum!

This was delicious.  I Used a smaller pork loin but kept the sauce the same, because I like a lot of sauce.  I also reduced the cooking time as suggested in other reviews and drained the juice to make a gravy.  I served it with mashed potatoes, but next time may do sweet potatoes.

Awesome recipe!  The only changes I made were I used apple cider instead of apple juice and added 3 cloves of crushed garlic to the juice while it cooked. Only cooked it for an hour and a half then poured off most of the apple cider removed the garlic and smeared the apple butter mix all over it then cooked it another 45 minutes to an hour. It was so tender and flavorful my family loved it I will be making this again very soon!

Very moist and tender! I put it on a rack to keep it from sitting directly in the liquid and stewing. My family definitely decided this recipe is a keeper!

Delicious! Just made this for my husband & my parents.  It was actually my first time making a pork loin!...everyone absolutely loved it. Great flavor and such an easy dish. Cooked for 1/2 hour in the apple juice then added apple butter mixture and cooked it again for another 45 min.

This was delicious!!!  It's just my me and my husband so I just used 4 boneless center cut chops and adjusted the cooking time to 30 minutes with apple juice & 60 minutes with the apple butter mixture.  The chops were very tender and the flavor was great!  I really think I'll try it in the crock pot next time though.  I think the flavor might marinate in the pork more.

Made this recipe for dinner last night and completely loved it!! Bought a 2# pork loin roast and after reading the reviews, followed one of them and cooked at 350 for 90 minutes. Came out perfectly juicy and tender! Was thinking after I put the apple butter mixture on half way through, that I might leave it uncovered for a few extra minutes at the end to make sure the glaze was intact, but no need. Loved it. Sometimes I make apple/garlic mashed potatoes by putting in one cubed apple and a few cloves of garlic in with the potatoes to boil, they mash up nicely and give the potatoes a nice flavor. Decided to make those and then also made gravy as another reviewer suggested, and it was out of this world with the pork loin! Was an easy dinner to make, but you'd never know by how impressive it all came out. Will definitely make this one again! Thanks!

I have made this recipes several times over. The only thing I don't use is the cloves, as no one in my house cares for them. I have always cooked mine for the 3 hours suggested and I will agree it is a bit much and the pork is quite dry. Overall, I think this is a very successful recipe and would recommend this to anyone who like apples and pork.

I've made this about 5 times now and finally had to review this recipe. It's one of my top 5 recipes on Allrecipes. I follow the recipe exactly and it turns out so juicy and flavorful. I put some peeled potatoes, baby carrots and onion wedges in this time to make a one pan dinner. The veggies were done at the same time as the pork and the apple cider had glazed and coated them so wonderfully. I'd give this 10 stars if I could.

This was so good.  I only used one cup apple cider for two pork tenderloins (1 pound each).  I kept all of the remaining ingredients the same.  I baked for 45 minutes covered then drained half of the pan juices as another reviewer suggested.  I topped with the apple butter mixture and baked another 10 minutes covered.  It made a very nice gravy.

Very delicious.  Fed from age 8 to 76 and everyone loved it.  I passed on the apple juice and just poured the sauce over the meat after about 15 mins in the oven.  Perfect and yummy.  Added bonus: smells great too!  BTW, I served it with spicy baked beans; great together...

Sooooo good and so easy! My favorite combination! I left out the cloves ( didn't think the kids would like it) my family loved it, which is rare. I did double the apple butter mixture. I will make this again and again. Use less brown sugar if you dont like sweet dinner. Thank You Umich97!

I have made this recipe every year for the halloween party my husband and I host. I get rave reviews everytime and my husband starts salivating for it the first of October. I love it, and it's ridiculously easy. But the cooking times are way too long, I follow the 30 and 45 method in the first review. Love it love it love it.

Simply amazing!  I used a half pork loin and omitted the cinnamon and cloves since my apple butter is very strong.  Otherwise I made just as the recipe said and it was awesome!!!  Will be making this again.  Thank you!!!

I thought this was a fantastic recipe.  However, I didn't really care for the cloves so next time I prepare this I will omit that ingredient.  Otherwise this was super!

Excellent. I had dinner on the table in 30 mins. I used a pressure cooker. Turned on browning element and seared a 3 lbs pork loin. Put the apple butter mixture on top of the pork loin. Cut up one onion and some mushrooms on botton of insert, poured in 2 cups of apple cider, put pork loin on top, closed lid. Set for 10 mins. Total time 20 mins. Took out pork loin, set it aside to rest. Turned on browning element til apple cider is boiling then added 1 packet of Hunter gravy mix, stired til thick. Served

I thought this would be the perfect recipe as my husband loves apple butter and I had some on hand that was made by his family.  I cooked it in the crockpot as many other did.  Very moist and smelled great.   I thought the taste was good, but husband and kids didn't.  Apparently, they don't like the sweet with the savory.  Also I found, the flavor didn't really go into the meat, but stayed more on top. So won't be making again.

So so delicious. I just dumped everything into the slow cooker and 4 hours later the pork was moist, tender and so flavorful, and the sause complimented it perfectly without being overpowering. Use no-sugar added apple butter, you don't need the extra sugar, it tastes great without it

We loved this! It smelled wonderful while baking and made everyone in the house hungry. Looks impressive on a platter as well.  I used a 3 lb pork loin and cooked for 3 hours. It was perfectly cooked. Served with Oven Fresh Seasoned Potato Wedges and Alyson's Broccoli Salad from this site to RAVE reviews from my family and guests.

I used 1 1/2lbs of pork loin, 1/8cup of brown sugar  and these cooking instructions:  Fork the roast in multiple places and sprinkle with salt.  Place tenderloin in a 11x7-inch baking dish.  Add apple juice and let stand 30 minutes or chill 2 hours. (If you have time leave over night).   Bake in preheated 350 degree oven for 15 minutes. Than Drain.  Stir together apple butter and remaining 4 ingredients.  Spread or brush over roast.  Bake an additional 45 minutes or until thermometer inserted in thickest part registers 150 degrees.  Let stand 15 minutes before serving.

Very good but yes the cooking time is off, Next time I make this I will pour out the juices towards the end and put apple butter on it, All the juices made it kind of wash off the meat.

This was wonderful, will be making it again. Did not have any apple juice or cider so I boiled 2 c. water w/ 2 apples & 1/3 c. sugar to make my own juice, kinda. It worked, took the leftover juices after cooking & made a gravy.

As is, there is just too much broth.  You really need to make it to a gravy for this to be great!  I'd have given 4.5 otherwise.

HOLY MOLY!!!! This was delicious!!!! I used a 4.5 pound pork loin.  I cooked it for about two hours at 350 (until the internal temp was 165) and it came out so moist and cut like butter!  It was the BEST pork roast I have ever made.  My  kids and hubby ate a ton of this.  I served with sweet potatoes and a salad.  The flavors in the pork really complimented the flavor of sweet potatoes. (put butter and brown sugar in potatoes). I almost doubled the sauce.  when the pork was done cooking and resting I put the liquid in a pan with a couple TBS of corn starch and brought to a boil to thicken. I then poured on the roast before serving. I will for sure make this again and again!  Thanks for such a fabulous recipe!!UPDATE*** I MADE THIS IN THE CROC POT AND IT CAME OUT BETTER I THINK.  I DID NOT HAVE TO DOUBLE THE SAUCE. GREAT!!

Very good!  I didn't have apple juice or cider, so I sliced up a honey crisp apple and added that to chicken broth instead.  I also cooked the pork in a slow cooker instead of the oven.  My boyfriend couldn't believe how tender it was!  A one-pound pork loin was enough for the 2 of us.  Like others have mentioned, the cooking liquids make a delicious gravy which I think really made the dish.  Just whisk in about a teaspoon or so of cornstarch.

This was disgusting. The apple soaked into the loin so strongly that it was just inedible. We all took one bite and threw the entire thing away.

The aroma was, to me, better than the taste.  If this combo of cinnamon and cloves is good for you, try it.  I think it would be better with ham slices.  Yet, I must say, it tasted as advertised, just like it  should. I would just prefer this on ham. And I'm gonna try it.  By all means give  this a try.  Then take it where you want  to go. Thank you, UMich97.

Tender, and smelled great while cooking, but INCREDIBLY bland.  I made a gravy from the juice/drippings which made it tolerable, but I will not make this again.

We loved it.  I got a pork roast on sale, and after reading the reviews of this recipe decided to use it here rather than pulled pork--again.  Made it as directed, no changes, and was very satisfied.  No leftovers, and several "please make it again"s from the picky eaters.

Had good flavor.  My problem is that the pork was too dry.  Cook for less time then what is listed.

This is a lovely, savory, and unique combination of flavors. If using a tenderloin, it is imperative that you match the weight of your tenderloin to traditional cook times. There is a previous review that explains the pork cuts well that I found informative. Enjoy this moist and tender pork with cheesy mashed potatoes and follow with apple pie a la mode. Delicious!

This was sooooooo good. It was so juicy, moist and flavorful.  The apple butter sauce is to die for - will double it next time so we can just dip the pork as we eat it instead of just spreading it on top.  I highly recommend this one.  Only thing I did differently was to cook it for 1 hour, then spread the apple butter and only cooked for 30 min more.  Mine were done perfectly.  3 hours seems a bit much to me. I might even brown them first next time as they do look a bit anemic (they have that poached look) from being covered the whole time.   Thanks for this wonderful recipe UMich97!!

This was a good recipe for pork.  The smell in the house reminded me of Thanksgiving, yum!  We mixed the sauce ingredients and put it on the tenderloins immediately.  Covered and baked for almost 2 hours.  The sauce remained on top and we got a little juice at the bottom, which I think helped keep the tenderloin juicy.  Thanks for posting!  Will be doing again.

This is a great pork recipe and it's even better the next day!  My family loved it.  I doubled the sauce, as recommended by others.  It smells great while cooking and the meat came out very tender.

Got rave reviews from my husband - who doesn't like pork too much.  I don't like port that much either, and I loved it.

I made this one time and it was such a lovely dish.  Moist and perfectly seasoned.  Don't be scared the apple butter- it's quite nice.  I also used a lot of apple cider in the pan to keep it moist and actually made a sweet/savory rosemary gravy from the apple cider and pan drippings that was slightly sweet, tangy, and meaty.  Delicious.

I don't understand all the rave reviews.  To me this tasted like pork cooked in pureed apple pie filling.  I tried adding some garlic and cayenne to give this some depth, but then it just tasted like spicy apple pie filling with garlic in it.  This would take several adjustments to give it some deep flavor, and frankly I don't think it would be worth the bother.  My daughter and husband liked it, so I gave it 3 stars.  On my own, I would give it two.

This was ok, I was expecting more from the high ratings and reviews.  I probably wont make it again.  I love apples with pork, however this recipe didn't win me over.

I did not have apple butter so in a pinch I made some in the oven during the first hour of the tenderloin roasting (apple butter II from this site).  My husband really liked this and he is not a pork or apple fan. Total cooking time was about 1 hr 45 mins and it was very tender at that point.  Will make again.

Adjusting the cooking time is a must! This is great stuff IF you don't overdo it. It made the whole house smell great and even my husband (who HATES pork) loved this. Will definately be making on a regular basis from now on. Thx for the great recipe. :)

Not the easiest of clean up...but man was it worth it! Sweet and succulent pork, spiced just right! Great the next day as a pulled pork sandwhich. Difficult to figure out what to serve with a meat dish that is so sweet though.

I tried this tonight. I actually only had one tenderloin, so I adjusted the recipe accordingly. I did add 1/4 teaspoon ginger and used Apple Butter and some leftover pumpkin butter together with the other ingredients. This was awesome! I will defintely be making this one again!

I really like this recipe.  I took the advice of others and only cooked it the second time for 1 hour, any more would be too much!  It is so good now whenever I use another recipe for pork tenderloin my boyfriend is so disappointed that I didn't make this one!

Excellent. My new favourite pork recipe. I love the sweetness of the sauce mixed with the pork. I have made this recipe without the apple juice and substituting pomegranate juice, blueberry juice... whatever I had in the fridge at the time. However, draining the pork after cooking is essential to get the apple butter mixture to set properly. Thanks for the great recipe. It's been added to my list of favourites.

I was looking for a new way to cook porkloin, but was disappointed with the results I got from this recipe. No one in my famiy cared for it. I did use applesauce instead of applebutter since I couldn't find any. Maybe that was the problem? I don't recommending subsituting it.

Quite tasty, but just a little sweet for our taste. Followed others' advice and cooked 1 1/2 hours (no idea how it could possibly cook longer without drying up terribly.) An unusual twist and crazy easy - thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent. Very easy and quick to make. The apple juice seemed a bit much so I drained some out after cooking.

Fabulous recipe! Don't change a thing it was out of site! Took about a cup of the juice and added two or so tablespoons of cornstarch to make gravy. Hubby was really freaking out over this one. And we got to have it the next night as well. Thanks!!

Good. I used a 3# pork loin roast and it worked great. The apple flavor goes very well with the pork and the kids loved it. The apple juice makes a nice sauce when it is done. I will make again.

I followed the others suggestions and reduced cookin time.   I thickened the applejuice and served it over the pork.  Everyone loved it.  It will definately be a staple for dinner parties.

I used 6 thick-cut boneless pork loin and used just enough apple juice to cover them in the baking dish.  Since they didn't carry apple butter at my grocery store I used applesause instead, left out the water and doubled the cinnamon.  Should have double the cloves too as it was mild tasting, but very moist and melt in your mouth.  Cut the oven tiime to 45 min first round and 30 min with the apple mixture.  Will definitely make this one again. Almost as good at Jackaroo chops from Outback!

Yum!  I had a jar of apple butter that I wanted to find a use for, and this was a perfect choice!  Pair it with a savory side dish, since the pork is sweet.  Can't wait to make it again!

I made this last night and it was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly.  One word of warning- keep your meat thermometer handy.  We checked the temp after 2.5 hours and found it was overcooked by about 30 degrees.  Even so, it was still very tender, juicy, and delicious.  Another reviewer mentioned making gravy from the liquid in the pan, so I took that advice and I'm glad I did.  The gravy really complemented the meat, and was a great way to use some of the flavorful cooking juices.  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was so unique and so delicious.  Followed the recipe exactly as written and ended up with tender and very tasty pork loin.  The cloves and apple butter give it just the right sweetness and spice flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a 'fun' recipe.  Different and very good.  I used a 2.5 lb pork loin roast.  Cooking time was about 30 mins less than receipe called for.  Any longer and it would have dried out.  So watch the cooking time. 
We really loved it and I've shared the recipe with my mom.  I thought.... Applesauce and porkchops go together, so why not this? 
Being in Cajun Country though, I did add a little bit of spice to the meat.  We enjoyed it and I'll make it again!

This is by far one of the best recipes I've used from this site.  My family kept saying "it's weird, but it's great".  They weren't expecting the sweetness.  The meat was super tender and delicious!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This is really good. I used No Sugar Added apple juice. After baking, the cooking liquid was tranferred to a sauce pan and cornstrach was added to thicken.

Super great pork loin.  Very tender and juicy.  I used the juicer to juice apples, then used the pulp in place of the apple butter, YUMMY!!

Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Those aren't my words, those are my fiance's, who loved this pork so much he said (jokingly), "My excitement about marrying you has just doubled." He usually likes my cooking a lot, but said this was a Hall of Famer. I've got to say, this recipe was fantastic and super easy. 

I used a little more apple juice, a good bit of seasoning salt, and about an extra 1/2 cup of apple butter. My tenderloin was only a little over a pound, so I cooked it for one hour in the juice and another with the apple butter mixture. It turned out beautifully, super moist and flavorful, more like a roast than a sliced loin. 

Ny fiance asked me if I'd make a double portion for his next work potluck so he could show off my cooking. Needless to say, both he and this recipe are keepers!

I had a big 4+ pound pork loin, and 3 hours was about right.

But the best part was the leftovers.  I sliced and heated the pork, and put it on buns with swiss cheese and fresh cole slaw.  Yum!  Even my picky five-year-old ate a sandwich with a little pork, swiss, and more apple butter.

This one's going in my file for Christmas Eve dinner.

I made this for my husband's birthday.  About 2.5 hours into it we were starving, but let me tell you, it was worth the wait!!  It was so great and he said it's the best pork loin he's ever had.  Definitly give this recipe a try, you won't regret it!!

This recipe is so easy to make!  I had six 3/4" pork loins so I baked it for a shorter length of time and it came out just perfect.  The pork was very tender, I used the juices as a sauce and boy was this delicious!  I would have thickened it with corn starch but was too lazy.  My husband and 8 yr old son said this recipe is a keeper!  Yum!

Absolutely FABULOUS! I have shared this recipe with all our family and friends, and everyone loves this dish!  I cut the pork loin into serving size pieces before roasting, and the flavor is just awesome! Our young children, who do not like many meat dishes, get so excited when I make this recipe!

This smelled wonderful while cooking and looked delicious, however the taste was incredibly bland.  It was very moist and tender, but ended up a waste of good pork loin IMO.  It's not bad tasting, it just flavorless. Even my BF who eats ANYTHING turned his nose up at it.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I just think that this recipe is not for my taste.

Very easy very moist.  I used a 4.5 lb pork loin.  I baked covered at 350' for 45 mins.  then knocked back the heat to 200' for about 1 1/5 hrs. until thermometer read 170' internal.  I did baste two times.  Very slow roasting makes it very very tender.  We had it for Easter Sunday dinner.  Wow what a hit!! definately something i will do again.

Other than decreasing the cooking time to 90 minutes total as others suggested, I followed the recipe exactly and it was EXCELLENT! I made it as a test run for a dinner party I'm having in a couple of weeks and I will for sure use this recipe. The pork was very tender and the house smelled heavenly.

This is one of the best pork recipes I have EVER made!  The meat as a nice flavor to it and is not too sweet and the aroma it gives off is amazing!!  Yummy and really tasted good with the leftover apple juice from the pan as a thin, but tasty gravy.  Definitely getting added to my cookbook!

This was delicious! I made it on the weekend since the cooking time was so long, but it was worth the wait.  The meat was sweet and tender and oh-so-yummy.  I might try this in the crockpot next time, so we could have it on a weeknight.

This recipe is awesome. My whole family enjoyed it. It was tender and had a lot of flavor, which is sometimes hard to do with pork. Thank you so much. I'm keeping this in my recipe box and sharing it with friends.

Very good recipe, definately a keeper.  I used homemade canned apple butter which was maybe a little too sweet, so next time I'll use a bit less brown sugar.

Simple and wonderful. I cooked this in the slow cooker, using 1.5 lb. pork loin and keeping the rest of the ingridents the same except I used regular butter with smashed apples. I basted the first 3 hrs. then added sweet potatoes and carrorts.  I ended up adding extra juice toward the end of cooking. Served twith a sm. bowl of the sauce to dip. The meat had enpugh flavor and was oh so tender.

I used homemade apple butter and I used pork chops instead of a loin.  Absolutly delicious.  The flavor does not penitrate the meat, but does compliment it well.  Will make this often!

One of the best and easiest pork recipes ever.  I made 4 loins for a dinner party and every person (14) present went back for seconds and wanted the recipe.  The only problem I had was that no one ate the beef that was also prepared ! !

Excellent!! I made one 1.5lb pork loin.  I did not have any ground clove so I used nutmeg instead, I also used apple cider instead of apple juice. I added cut up fresh sweet potatoes to make it more of a complete meal.  It came out really juicy and tender. It's not overly sweet. The recommended cooking time was way off mine was ready in less than 2 hours maybe because I only made one.

This recipe was wonderful. Reheat leftovers in the microwave or on stove the next day in the juice. It makes a great hot pork sandwich and you can put the juice in a bowl to dip the sandwich like a french dip.

I modified this recipe to cook in my slow cooker.  I added 1 cup apple cider and then piled on the apple butter spread with additional parsley and chives spices.  I allowed it to slow cook for 7 hours. Turned out really nice, except it was a little dry and bland.  Perhaps, I need to add more apple cider next time.  Overall, I would recommend this dish.

This was sooooo good! I was a bit concerned after the first hour when I went to add the apple butter - it looked a bit scary - but after the next hour - YUM!  I didn't make a gravy with the juices - but will next time. That is my only regret.  I served with roasted harvest veggies and mashed potatoes.

My family and I loved this recipe!! I didn't have the seasoning salt so I used "Spike" (found in most health food stores. The pork loin just pulls apart so easily and the aroma when it's in the oven is heavenly! I like to use the leftovers with alittle BBQ sauce and make pulled pork sandwiches.

This recipe was really good. I have to say I will be making it again. I think the only thing that I would do different is try to marinade it overnight or atleast a couple of hours before I cook it. The meat didn't hold the flavor.

This recipe was fabulous.  I'm EXTREMELY picky about what pork I'll eat, this is by far the best I've had in at least 10 years.  The flavor went all the way to the center, and yet wasn't overpowering.  The clove flavor was great.  I might have used a bit more spices than the recipe called for, but it turned out great.  Nothing but rave reviews from the family.

I've found that, shredded, this meat is perfect for the addition of NC vinegar/pepper based bbq sauce.  We enjoy the pork loin as is the first night, and I shred up the remaining and toss with home made NC bbq sauce (vinegar, garlic, red pepper, clove) and have sandwiches the next day.  I would give this recipe 6 stars if I could.

The pork and apple butter go great together.  I buy the large pork loin and cut it into 3 sections, freezing 2.  Then slice ALMOST all the way through the loin into serving sizes.  Cook 45 minutes and then add apple butter mixture and cook another 45 minutes.  Thank you UMich97 for a great recipe!

I made this for friends and they loved it. This was the first pork tenderloin I have ever made, as I am not a very experienced cook. It came out very tender and juicy. The apple juice and apple butter went great with the pork. I will be making this again, especially for a hectic holiday because it is so easy.

Great recipe! Made the house smell fantastic and the juices were amazing! Mine turned out a little dry ~ it didn't need as much time to cook as the recipe called for. So, beware, you might need to adjust your cooking time.

I was so excited about this recipe.  It had strong ingredients to counter the blandness of lean meats, such as pork tenderloin.  But, what a dissapointment!  Per other reviews, I cooked @ 325,  1/2 hr per lb and it came out moist & tender, but FLAVORLESS, despite wonderful ingredients.  The best part of this recipe was eating the apple butter out the jar, during preparation.

First, let me say all the family liked this.  My husband isn't a big fan of sweet meats so based upon the suggestion of another review I added some cayenne pepper (she had added 1 tablespoon, I added 1/2 tablespoon).  I'd still add the cayenne next time but I'd still add a little less the 1/2 Tablespoon.  I omitted the cinammon and cloves because of my husband's preferences too.  I cooked it for 30 minutes under tin foil and then appx another hour-until the internal temp was 160 degrees.  My boneless pork  tenderloin was a little under 2 pounds.

For some reason, I could not find apple butter. So I used apple jelly. This was very good and tender!

I'm rather new at cooking these kinds of things, and followed the recipe exactly (except I didn't have the cloves). Instead of nice cut slices, I got nice pulled pork (have to use the pan mixture) instead. The cooking time is way too long and when it was time, the temp was up near 180 inside. Couldn't cut it into slices, kept falling apart. I'll try it again, but with less cooking time as so many others had noted. Rather disappointed, but still tasty, if overcooked.

Wow fantastic flavor, possibly the best pork loin I’ve cooked. I added couple of small touches I seasoned & marinated the meat in apple juice for almost 5 hours and added a couple of sliced red apples to the pan when I threw it in the oven. However, I did find that cooking the loin for three hours excessively dried the meat out. I would recommended no more than 2 hours total cooking time, but to each their own. Overall the flavor was magnificent (my 6 & 4 year kids gave it two thumbs up lol) I will definitely be cooking this again in the future.

I had a 4lb pork tenderloin and didn't have enough Apple butter so I supplemented with Apple sauce. It have very good flavor but was a bit dry despite all the liquid used in this recipe.

This was great. I read other reviews. I cooked 2 2-lb roasts at 350 and after 40 minutes I put on the sauce. It took another 55 minutes after that. after the second 40 minutes, I scooped out some sauce, put it in a sauce pan, boiled it down and added cornstarch (premixed with water). I served this as gravy and it was a big hit. I will make it again.

I cooked it in a crock pot on high for about 5 hours with all ingredients mixed. Added some conrnstarch to give a gravy type. It was awesome. Next time, I will shred it like a pulled pork, I think it will be even more delish

Excellent PorkLoinrecipe. I used a digital meat thermometer; it was 155 degrees in about 1.5 hour. My roast was just over 3 pounds. I marinated in Apple cider overnight, then poured off half before baking as my meat fit snuggly in my small roaster. I baked fat sideup for the first 30 minutes, then turned it over spread the Apple Butter mixture (without the water so it was thick) over the top. I did put it under the broiler for 3 minutes. I thickened the gravy up with cornstarch...truly delightful!  Compliments from my husband and my son...which is rare...GREAT recipe!

Did a larger roast so would have cooked it a bit longer to get it to fall apart. And judge apple juice based o pan, not the recipe. Don't want it to bubble over in the oven.

Loved this recipe!
I only used 2# for two people and had left overs for sandwiches.  The sauce was so flavorful.  I cooked it in a Sharp convection microwave in my Motorhome so I did only cook the roast for 60 minutes was just right any longer it would have been dried out.

This is delicious but I did change the cooking time. I still cooked (covered) for an hour then removed to add the sauce. When it went back in the oven, I only cooked it for 35 more minutes. It reached over 145 degrees after about 15 minutes but I didn't want to take it out too prematurely. I didn't change any of the ingredients. This got a rare unanimous thumbs up from all family members!

Delicious! Had this tonight and served it to company and everyone loved it! I marinated the pork overnight in 2 cups of apple juice then discarded that and baked it in 2 more cups of juice. There was some of the apple butter topping left over so after the pork was done cooking I poured the drippings into a saucepan, added the remaining topping and some cornstarch dissolved in cold water and heated until thick. This made a wonderful gravy over the meat! I cooked my pork loin for 2and 1/2 hours at 300 degrees because I was afraid 350 would over cook it to time it when my guests were arriving.

My guests and I found it a little bland... until we sprinkled a handful of green chilies on top of the glaze.  Gave it just the right kick.

Something is wrong with this recipe.  After the first hour of cooking, the roast was way over done.  Is the temperature incorrect for this recipe?

My family loved it. I didn't add the sugar due to my husbands diabetes. I cooked everything else as suggested even the cook time. The meat was so tender, flavorful and moist.  Will definitely cook again.

I made some little tweaks and changes, but this was the most moist tenderloins I’ve every had, a nice sweet/holiday spice taste. I added two peeled and cut honey crisp apples around the pork loins, in the juices and liquid during the basting process, and recovered the meat and let it finish out the rest of the oven cooking time. The apples steamed and had a wonderful spiced apple flavor, that went perfectly with the meat. Delicious! Definitely am going to make it again.

I guess I wasn't supposed to drain the apple juice inbetween cooking for the first hour and the last two because my pork came out as dry as a hockey puck. Of course, I have had troubles in the past with my oven and stove getting too hot, but I don't think that was the problem. I wish the recipe had specified about the apple juice. Other than being overcooked though, the flavors of the brown sugar apple butter paired with pork were spot on and complementary.

YUM! I didn’t make any changes other than the meat. We did two pork tenderloins instead of pork loin (total weighing 2.8 lbs) because they were on sale. It ended up being very nice because it only cooked for about 65-70 minutes total. Just watch your temperature and take out at 145! 

Thanks for the recipe!

OMG this is really tasty! I did make some changes, because for some reason I can never leave a recipe alone.
I used a boneless center cut pork roast. I didn't have any apple juice so I used cider. I followed the cook times and temp. I did change the apple butter mix to 2 TB  brown sugar and a tsp of smoked paprika. I also added a tsp of liquid hickory smoke and some salt. I kept the cinnamon and clove.
As it cooked it created this wonderful BBQ like sauce.
Delicious! I will make this again.

This was a delicious tribute to all the fall flavors, great using homemade apple butter! I  topped the pork with fresh apple slices before adding the seasoned apple juice to the pan.

I did a single 2# roast, Adjusted the cooking time to 45 min...30 min, then drained off about half the apple juice, applied the apple butter, then roasted another 15 min. I also used a teaspoon or so of Apple Pie spice blend. Really enjoyed it.

Put it all in a crock pot. Turned out good but the meat was a bit dry since it’s so lean. Used a 2lb pork loin roast. Served with the juice and that helped. I didn’t bother to thicken with cornstarch. Think I’d rather have it with a pork shoulder next time.

I used the suggestion to cook less time for more firm pork, cooked in apple juice for 30 min, poured juice off, poured apple butter mix on & baked for another 15 minutes. Served to guests with make ahead mashed potatoes & green salad. It was a hit!

I did make this,  but will did it a little different.  I mixed all the ingredient together except the water. Placed the loin in my pressure cooker and poured the sauce on top. Set the timer for 45 minutes. It came out perfect. We will be doing this again, my husband is still raving about it.

Very good recipe. I used pork loin chops instead of a roast.  Varied cooking time obviously. And because the sauce was a bit too sweet I added some curry. Very good!!

I made this according to the recipe. The only thing I did was after I put the apple butter sauce on I let it cook for 1 -1/2 hours  instead. The next time I make this it will be in my crockpot using apple cider or apple sauce instead. It turned out delicious and tender. Thanks for all the suggestions.

This was delicious tender very flavorful. I used the suggestion and cut down the cooking time to 30 minutes per 1/2 #. Also when I pulled the roast out the first time to add the apple butter glase,I added diced onions carrots and cut potatoes to make a meal of it. It was wonderful and wil definitely make again now that I have apple butter v

I Love this recipe! I made it the first time in the oven as the recipe stated with minor cooking time changes as other people had recommended and it came out delicious! Family loved it! Tonight I made it in the instant pot in 35 min! It came out just as delicious minus the long cooking time! The only change I made to cook in the instant pot is decrease the apple nice to a cup and a half instead of 2 cups and I added s tablespoon of corn starch to then juice to thicken in the instant pot.

I thought this was good. Made exactly as stated in recipe. I would next time  do a cup of apple juice and I would put the mixture on top and not cover it. I would like more of it as a crust than the way it came out. Did not have to cook as long as it says in the recipe.

We both loved this recipe. I thought is was strange to have a small roast cook for a total of three hours. Sometimes I'm not the sharpest knife in my kitchen drawer, so I only knocked 30 minutes off the cooking time. It was just a tad over done on the outside, but otherwise perfect. I made my own apple butter. Next time I'll leave out the brown sugar as my homemade apple butter was really sweet. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I used a cheaper pork cut and halved the recipe but kept the same cooking time.  It was outstanding!  My hubby doesn’t usually like pork because it gets dry.   This stayed moist and juicy.  I put it in my small roaster and put foil over it to keep the moisture in.

It's great as is, but the second time I made it, I also used some seasoned apple slices on top as well. YUM!

I always serve with German Potato Salad and some Greens. 

Never any leftovers in this house.

(No where in the recipe title n directions do I see tenderloin. The pic told me tenderloin.  The submitter noted in a review that tenderloin was used. )  I plan to try this recipe. Hard to beat a melt in your mouth pork tenderloin.  Many positive reviews .  ( I selected 4 stars as I hadn't tried yet n can't submit comments without star rating. ??)

This was surprisingly delicious!  I really wanted to add other spices - I thought the sweet spices would be too much - but this was perfect as is.  I used a pork loin roast - NOT tenderloin - a bigger cut with more fat, and threw it in the slow cooker on high for an hour, then low for a good 2 to 2 1/2 hours.  I used apple cider, but probably only a cup or so.  Served with roasted sweet potato wedges and green beans.  I probably will try this with a pork tenderloin in the oven, and just cook it for a much shorter time.

Apples and pork go together well, so I used a tenderloin. Was able to cook 2.5 total lbs of tenderloin in the pan of apple juice for 30 minutes at 350 covered in foil. Strained most of the juice, cut the tenderloins in half, put the apple butter on top and continued cooking covered for another 30 minutes. Dinner was quickly made, with extra apple butter on the side!

Kids loved it - I messed up and cut it into smaller pieces which got it a little over done (that allowed it to shred more than slice) but that was my screw up not the recipe.  Overall - very good and I'll make it again.

I will make it again.  However, I will cut down on the cooking times and the amount of apple juice.  We liked the flavors but dried out the Center Cut Loin roast I used.

I did like the flavours very much.  I will make this again with a few minor adjustments.   Its was a bit too sweet, so will use less brown sugar.  Also  roasting time was too long as it was a bit dry.

I’ve been making this for sometime and my family loves it. Instead of tenderloin I use a regular 4lb pork loin and slice it in half the long way and do the same thing.

My guys are so picky but they both loved this recipe!! I did add potatoes and carrots to the recipe and a dash of nutmeg. I cooked it in my Crock-Pot? while I was at work. Came home and the house smelled so good! Added some biscuit's and some of the apple butter jelly to them yum so good. Will make again.

I did as a couple others and put a 4.77 lb half loin in my crockpot. I used apple cider instead of juice. I whisked everything up in a bowl and poured it over the meat and now I wait for 8 hours to see what magic my slow cooker made this time... ;-) I am giving it 5 stars because I am confident it will be amazeballs.

It's pretty rare that my husband raves about a dish (he's usually a person that thinks food is food), so when he does, it's a keeper. I used an oven safe thermometer to cook this until it was 145*F before adding the sauce and cooking for another couple of minutes to carmelize it a bit. Those changes and making half a recipe (somehow I only had one tenderloin left in the package?) were all I did differently. Next time, I think I'd make it in my instant pot, I just need to figure out how long to cook it for...the crock pot seems like it would work well also.

I increased the apple juice , the  apple butter mixture, and added apples to the pan.   The gravy suggestions made by other people was a big hit.   The gravy really added to the dish.

This smelled sooooo good!  I couldn't find my seasoned salt at first so I used a little dash of bacon flavored salt and Montreal steak seasoning.  Then I found the seasoned salt & threw a little of that on too.  I was short on time so everything went in the crock pot on low.  The loin went in frozen, the apple juice was poured on top, the season salt mix next and then the apple butter/spice mix on top & over the sides of the loin.  Two whole peeled carrots were thrown on either side of the pork loin (4 total).  It took 4.5 hours on low and then one hour on high at the end (because we were hungry & wanted to eat sooner).  It turned out tender and delicious!   Thank you for sharing! This was such a nice change from our normal weeknight dinner.

Very tasty. Cook time is a bit long for 2lb pork loin roasts.  I should have checked it sooner.  The ends were a bit dry but the flavor was there.  It REALLY needs gravy or a glaze.  Wish I would have read through all of the reviews before I made it as there are several who made gravy.  Had I done that and shortened the cookin time it would have been great. I will try it again.

Edit2019: made it several times. I've found if I marinated it over night, then threw it into the crock pot at low for the day, it's amazing! I live how quick and minimum. Serviced with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The pork loves the apple butter and cooking slow all day really helps the pork stay moist and flavorful. 


Made as directed and everyone loved it. It was a nice change from my normal salty pork meals.

Took only 1 hour to bake. Next time I'll pour the liquid on top and bake for 1 hour. Good flavor and was tender.

I had a 1 1/2 lb pork loin and put all in a crockpot on low for 5 hrs.  Family loved it!  Next time I will use   2 pork loins as it shrank and was a little small for 3 people.

Delicious! Made exactly as stated but reduced cooking time to about 2 hours (I had a 3 pound loin). I also took the drippings and reduced for about 10 minutes and then thickened with corn starch--made for a delicious sauce. I served with mashed sweet potatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts.

The only reason I did not give 5 out of 5 was because of the cooking time.  Luckily I read the reviews and reduced my cooking time to about 20 minutes per pound.  When it was done I took the juices and thickened them with a cornstarch and water mixture for some gravy.  I made this for Christmas dinner and received so many compliments.  It was really good.

This looked better than it tasted. The meat was moist and the recipe is sound, but the overall flavor was just meh for me. If I were going to do something like this again, I'd have to mix some savory with the sweet.

I was expecting something more flavorful. A bit disappointed.  I seared the pork loin first in EVOO (cast iron pan) for  2-3 minutes before placing in a roasting pan with the apple juice. Baked at 350 * for 30 minutes, removed from the oven and drained some of the juice.  Then, coated with apple butter mixture and baked for 30 minutes... my side dishes weren't ready so I turned the oven down to 300 & left it in there for another 10-12 minutes. Served with mashed potatoes & cinnamon apples!!!

Very nice recipe.  I followed the recipe as written with one minor change to the recipe, I used half the cloves that the recipe called for.   This was about right for us.   I also had one major change to the recipe:   I used my pressure cooker instead of the oven.   It came out not as tender as I'd like, but that was my fault.   A very solid recipe.

Juicy, tender, flavorful - apple is such a nice complement to a pork loin.

Really good recipe just changed a few things such as used cinnamon apple sauce instead of apple butter and omitted cloves and added double the cinnamon (hate the taste of cloves) and make sure you spoon  the  sauce over the meat when serving

My family liked the flavor, however, 3 hrs in the oven was way too long.  I should've just trusted my better judgement and used a thermometer until pork was done.  But it tasted very good.

Awesome! Cooked in a crockpot for 6 hours on high. I put the sauce on right away and used fruit punch instead of apple juice. Funny I have apple butter on hand but no apple juice. The leftover juice in the crock was wonderful as a dipping sauce. Kids loved it, wife said it was "good". This ones a keeper!

Followed to the letter and it was one of the best dishes I ever tasted. The pork was so tender and the apple butter made a nice crust. Highly recommend!

We made it for Christmas dinner and it was a big hit. We made it in the crockpot and thickened the gravy with cornstarch. Be careful to not make it too thick. We will definitely serve this again.

I prepared this with one exception, after around 1 hour cooking I did pour off some of the liquid and then continued cooking it.  That was the only change I made.   We thoroughly enjoyed it !

Excellent recipe! I used a pork shoulder roast rather than a pork tenderloin. My roast was about 4 lbs. I baked it one day and then I put it in a low oven, 200F, for about 4 hours the next day and sliced it allowing it to soak in the juices. It turned out juicy, succulent, and flavorful. My guests and family raved about it.

Pretty good. I didn't use as much clove and used apple cider instead of juice. Also made a sauce from pan drippings with garlic, shallots, pears, a little fresh thyme, and  white wine. Will make again. .... pork tenderloin shouldn't be cooked for three hours.

I used a small pork roast instead because that is what I had in my freezer. It turned out delicious! Even my picky kids cleaned their plates. This is a recipe we will be making on a regular basis!

Fantastic! My son (age 12) declared it the best thing he's ever eaten. My husband who hates pork went back for seconds. Changes I made: I used an OJ/pineapple juice blend instead of apple juice. Cooked for 30 min. at 350* with just meat and juice, salt and pepper. Removed from oven and covered in Apple butter mixture and baked for one and a half hours covered.

This dish was delicious! My fiancé (who eats like a bird) had four helpings! I followed everyone else's suggestions and baked the pork for about an hour and a half in the oven. It was so tender and juicy. We both loved the topping so I think next time I will make a little extra and drizzle it on each individual slice. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing! :)

Made this and we definitely enjoyed it. I used a 2.3 lb pork loin roast, and followed Valerie's Kitchen's suggestions. I didn't use season salt (that seemed weird to me), just rubbed with salt and pepper. Cooked it for 30 mins, then took out some juice, poured the apple butter mixture over it, and cooked it for 45 mins more. It wasn't quite to safe temperature, so I wound up cooking it about 25 mins more. It nearly overcooked, but thankfully I took it out before it could be truly overcooked. It had a lovely, sweet, succulent flavor and my husband and sister loved it! Will definitely save, and adjust cooking times.

As long as the pork stays covered, or nearly so, this recipe turns out good but not great.  I found it somewhat bland but made it occasionally anyway.  (I always leave out the brown sugar).  I finally read the comments and realized that the best bit was what I was throwing away!  You absolutely have to make gravy from the cider drippings.  I used about a tablespoon of cornstarch to make the gravy.  Excellent on mashed potatoes.  The meal went from three stars to five.

I read all the reviews, both good and bad and changed a few things accordingly.  Not sure it's the same recipe anymore, but it was delicious so I thought I'd share.

I used a 2.5 pork sirloin roast.  I don't use seasoning salt so I just put salt and pepper and about a tablespoon of crushed, dry sage.  Poured over only a half cup of apple juice and roasted it covered for about 45 minutes.  I combined 1/2 cup of my homemade pear butter and about a tablespoon of brown sugar (I skipped the cinnamon and cloves because the butter is already spiced).  After the first 45 minutes I removed the foil, coated the roast with the pear butter mixture and roasted for another half hour.  Rested for 10 minutes and it was perfect; moist, tender and not overly sweet.

You can change up the butter and cook it in different ways.  I have used reg butter with allspice and cinnamon then based it to create a crust.  Wonderful to switch it up!

This rating is on the idea; as I used pork chops and homemade apple butter, so cooking time, etc had to be adjusted.  We love this, would never thought to use apple butter; but was a wonderful tasty meal.  Thanks for posting, UMich97.  Will try this with pork loin next time.

I made a pork Loin (not tenderloin) and only did 50min at 350.  Still a tad bit dry...  I feel like the marinade was awesome- but the pork would have benefited from being marinated overnight in the fridge.  The meat itself was slightly bland, but it was tasty if you took a bite with the sauce...  HIGHLY recommend reducing bake time (even with a loin) and also marinating overnight!

I looked at the feedback from others in the comment section. What I did is changed to an hour at 325 degrees, added the apple butter mixture like regular, and cooked another 2 hours at 300 degrees. It cooked through just fine but, sadly, was a little dry. I think if I start out at 300 degrees, then add the mixture, and cut back to maybe 250-275 degrees for the next two hours it might turn out just right.

This is one of the best pork loin recipes I have ever eaten. I followed the recipe exactly except for the timing I used Valeries kitchen for that and even made the side dishes she suggested. The entire meal could not have been better.

I give this three stars although my husband gave it FIVE.  I agree it was delicious, but it was too sweet for me.  I need a little more spice.  I'll have to find something to add to it, but it was delicious.  I did cook it in a crock pot for about 9 hours on low.  Super tender.  Great recipe!

I had to make this after reading all the rave reviews but for me it was way too sweet. If you like Xmas ham, you'll love this. I'll try it again but will skip the brown sugar next time.

This was a delicious recipe. My boyfriend and I used a 1.5 lb pork loin, not a tenderloin, and cooked it at 350 for about 90 mins and it turned out great! Also used another reviewers suggestion and turned the leftover liquid into a gravy. Excellent. Will definately be making this again!

We got apple butter in our CSA box, so I was looking for ways to use it. I prepared this in the crock pot per other reviewer suggestions and it turned out ok.

Pretty easy recipe and the flavor of the apple butter with the pork is wonderful. I followed the recipe except for cooking time and next time I will only use about 1 cup of apple juice as I thought it was too much. The 2 cups almost covered my pork and made the apple butter mixture run off. My pork was done in about 2 hours.

This was great, but made a few changes. Cooked the tenderloin in a crock on high with all of the ingredients, less the water. I added fresh garlic, honey and black pepper. Slow cooked it for 5 hours, till the meat was falling apart. I also made a gravy with the left over juice from the crock, but it was way to sweet. The tenderloin was perfect with out the sauce.

My dad, who doesn't gush over how tasty a meal is, well...he gushed over how good this pork tenderloin dish was!  Definately make a gravy out of the liquids in the pan.  I followed someone else's recomendation of cutting slices almost all the way through, cook for 40 minutes, pour the apple butter mixture over and in-between the slices, and cook uncovered for another 40 minutes.  It was delicious!

I thought this recipe was pretty good, as did our guests. Everyone says its like eating Christmas. I'm pregnant, so it may just be that my taste buds are off, but I felt it needed a little bit of something more. I'm rating this a month or so after I made it, so I couldn't say exactly what I thought it needed at the time! I did make a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce and poured that over some couscous. Again, guest loved it and hubby who doesn't like sweet with his savory, gobbled it up!

AMAZING! I'd give this 10 stars if I could. I used a five lb loin, so I doubled the glaze and made a gravy out of the drippings when it was done. We smothered our slices in this gravy. I just got done eating this and can't wait to eat the leftovers! So so so glad I found this recipe. Will be in regular rotation from now on.

This was ok but not spectacular.  The apple butter flavor really didn't infuse the meat.  We will prob stick with another recipe.  Thanks though.

This recipe is incredible. I couldn't find any tenderloins so I substituted boneless chops. I was worried that the pork would be tough, just like every other pork recipe (other than slowcooked) that I've tried. It was far from it! And to top it all off, it tasted like CANDY! Well, not really, but defintely a yummy meal. I served it with a carrot casserole. Defintely recommend! Next time I will hopefully be able to try it with tenderloins...

I think this is my favorite "roast" involving fruit. Just make sure you've got a thermometer -pork is done at 160. This came out so tender I could cut it with a fork. The flavor was really good, too!

I keep trying to figure out what I did wrong, but this dish just did not turn out well at all. Perhaps, it is because I could only find spiced apple butter? Overall, I was disappointed, especially because this recipes was so highly recommended.  Hope your's turns out better.

Definately will be my #1 way of preparing pork tenderloin.  You can tweak the cook times and temperatures to your liking.  Just make sure there is enough liquid so the meat doesnt dry.  I did 1 hour @ 350 before the apple butter and 1 hour @ 300 after and it turned out great.  Definately spoon some of the liquid over the meat after it is sliced.

Pork tenderloin will cook in less than 3 hours, but for this recipe, there is a reason for the time.  It makes the meat fall-apart tender and gives more time for the flavors to get into the meat.  Also, this is the reason for the amount of liquid needed.  Please try it as written.  It is perfect.

Excellent- keeps the pork really moist. Great flavor! I'm glad I read the reviews, as I used 2 tenderloins so cut the cooking time down to about an hour and a half total. I served it with sweet potato fries- probably my favorite dinner in a while!

Excellent!  I halved the recipe and it worked out fine, just used a smaller pan and a bit less time in the oven.  I also added a bit of allspice.  I served it with wild rice and green beans.  It was delicious :)

really good. I used apple cider instead of the juice b/c I forgot to buy apple juice. then as one other poster mentioned, I mixed additional apple butter in with the cooked juiced at the end and scooped it over once on the plate.

LOVED this recipe.  cooked it (2.5 lbs. approx.) in the apple juice for 30 minutes, drained half of the apple juice, and then added the apple butter mixture and cooked for 30 minutes more.  wonderful!  i drained off the apple juice and added cornstarch to make a gravey to put on top of the meat.  thanks so much for the recipe!!

My family loved this recipe.  My husband was leery of making a gravy with the juices, but was pleasantly surprised to really enjoy it over Yukon Gold mashed potatoes.  I added a couple of apples in with the pork, they were really tasty.  I'll be making this again, but probably will wait until fall, since I think it would really be great then.

I made this for a freezer meal group and used an apple butter recipe from this site. It had great flavor. Just watch the temperature of the pork loin Mine got really dry after cooking very quickly in the slow cooker.

This is an easy way to make a tender pork roast. It was a little bland for my taste.  I would give it a 4.5 if it was possible.   I would make it again.

The pork was soooo tender and moist!  I made a huge mistake and wasn't paying attention when I took my pork from the freezer.  It turned out to be 4.5 lbs of pork CUTLETS in the package...OOOPs!  I kept the cutlets formed in the roast form and you couldn't even tell!  I kept to the 25-30 min per lb rule (thanks to the other reviewers).  One daughter refused to try the apple-butter gravy on the pork, but the other loved it.  My hubby said that he loved it even though he isn't a big apple fan.  I thought it was a little too sweet and adjusted with some worchestershire sauce, but will probably cut out more, if not all of the brown sugar.  Still, for the moisture/tenderness level alone:  4 stars.  I served with mashed red potatoes and yellow squash.

Solid, but not spectacular.  Takes forever to cook uncovered.  I cover it and halfway through take the cover off.  I also reduce the amount of apple juice.

Outstanding!  Tasty, moist, and a true comfort food.  Didn't have apple juice on hand so I mixed some apple butter with water - worked wonderfully. I received some Apple Butter as a gift and didn't think I'd ever use it, but now I know it won't last long enough.  :)

I really wanted to like this recipe and after reading all the reviews, I felt ready to tackle it but it fell short of fabulous. I took the suggestion of 1 reviewer and marinated the tenderloins in apple juice 24 hours, baked 15 min, drained juices into a pan, topped with the apple butter mixture and continued to bake. My meat thermometer malfunctioned and I could have overcooked it a bit but I, like other reviewers, found the meat to be dry and tasteless even with overnight marinating. I'm not sure what will fix this. I know I can make it less dry by decreasing the baking time but even though I stabbed it repeatedly with a fork prior to marinating, the taste did not permiate the meat. It wasn't bad, I just had higher hopes. I did make a gravey with the reserved juices and served with a side of sauteed apples.

Good flavor, but the pork took much longer than expected to cook. Would have liked a more tender meat, but it also could have been the pork that I purchased. I will have to make it again and see.

I was disappointed with this recipe and won't make again.  Although the meat turned out incredibly moist, it had no flavor.  The apple butter combination completely melted and combined with the apple juice to make a runny sauce.  (Was I supposed to drain the apple juice?)  In hindsight, I should have made a gravy out of the cooked juices because the flavor was good; it just didn't penetrate the meat.  One of the big negatives for me was the mess this recipe made.  Thank goodness the dish was covered because that sauce splattered everywhere!

Loved this Recipe! Like others, I put tenderloins in the crock pot. I cooked it on high for about 2.5 hrs. Then I drained the apple juice except for about a 1/4c. then added the apple butter sauce and put it back on low for another hour. After the pork was done I cooked the liquids down for a sauce. Yummy!

I agree with the other reviewers that the cooking time was a bit off.  The recipe however was excellent.  Next time I may double the apple butter mixture and add lots more brown sugar!

This tasted fantastic and the meat was so juicy and tender. I actually cooked it in the crockpot instead. 3.5 hours on high, then added the apple butter topping and some cut apples. We loved it! The only thing I would change in the future is that I would add more apples to cook in the juices!

I had some apple butter to use up and this was perfect for it!  I also used tenderloins and baked for a little over an hour.  Everyone in the family loved it.  I might have to make some more apple butter so I can make it again!

This recipe is to die for. I also cooked mine in the crock pot. It only took about 6 hours for my 2 1/4 lbs of meat. Oh and I also used pork tenderloin instead of regular loin.

WOW this recipe is amazing. I made it for dinner tonight.  I added a sliced Granny Smith apple with the apple butter mixture and only cooked it for 90 minutes instead of 120.  The pork fell apart and tasted wonderful :)

I don't know why this recipe has such good reviews.  I used a pork tenderloin cooked for about 30 minutes.  I only cooked it to 155 and it was the most dry tenderloin I've ever had.  It also didn't pick up any of the flavor from the apple juice.  There are much better pork loin/tenderloin recipes on this site.

This is the only meat recipe I've managed to master so far! Yay! The pork came out nice and tender and I loved the addition of apple butter on top. I used some of my left overs from the "all day apple butter" recipe. Mmmm, delicious! I served the pork with roasted fall vegetables. A perfect warm a cozy dinner on a chilly day!

We thought this was very good.  Next time I will only use one pork tenderloin because the two that came in the package were different sizes and the smaller one was overdone after 50 minutes.  The larger one, on the other hand, was great after the same amount of time.

Very yummy. Def. serve with cooking juice as this is a bit dry without some juice ladled over, but overall very good.

This is a ridiculously easy main meat dish to prepare.  I use two pork loins and only cook for about 2 hrs, as others have mentioned.  One twist I decided to put on this meal the last time I made it was slicing the pork loins lengthwise like a hoagie bun (but not completely through) prior to the initial oven time, following the recipe as indicated (although a shorter cooking time), and then about 20 min prior to taking the pork out of the oven adding thin slices of brie to the center of the pork loin.  It melted fairly well and added a rich flavor to the loin.  A fun, and well received, twist to the recipe.

This was ok, but I didn't think the flavors married very well.  It tasted like a moist and juicy pork tenderloin with a layer of apple butter on top.  I only used one tenderloin and cut the cooking time down to 30 minutes, cooking the meat to an internal temp of 150F, then letting it rest for 5 minutes.  My husband and I had to add hot sauce at the table to make it edible.

This recipe is so good, I think I've made it 4 times in a month and a half, and I used to go 6 months without making pork!  I added just 1.5 cups apple juice (vs. 2) and I cooked it 45 minutes then 1.5 hrs (vs. 1 then 2 per the recipe).  I love love love this recipe, it's really something different that our guests have loved each time!

I made this with a single tenderloin of about 1.25 pounds.  Used homemade apple butter (Apple Butter II from this website and Sarah's Applesauce since I didn't have any applesauce at home).  Used a baking pan with a foil tent.  Took about 50 minutes total to reach 160 degrees internal temperature, about 15 minutes with just the apple cider and 35 min with the apple butter mixture on top.  Came out absolutely delicious!

well, in all fairness, i made quite a few adjustments to this recipe so technically, i'm not even sure i'm rating THIS recipe. i didn't have apple juice so i used apple cider. i didn't have apple butter, so i used scd apple sauce. my husband is on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet and can't have sugar, so i couldn't use brown sugar, i used honey. i followed the rest of the recipe exactly, cooking times, temp, spices, etc. the pork had a beautiful color and the smell was amazing. however, it was a bit dry and the flavor didn't permeate the meat, AT ALL! i usually bake my pork loin in just a bit of water, so i was very hopeful with the cider. just surprised that it didn't do anything for the flavor. all in all, pretty bland the way i did it.

I used a 4 1/2 lb loin, cooked covered at 350 for 2 1/2 hrs and the ends came out dry. I thought this had good flavor, but my entire family prefers the herb roasted pork recipe from this site using balsamic vinegar. Hubby didn't ask for seconds. :6

This was a great recipe! My husband loved it. This was one of the only times he actually went back for seconds when I served a meat dish. Thanks to all the reviewers before me, for I would have cooked my tenderloin too long...you guys saved me!

Yum yum yum!  The flavors in this are amazing!  I used a pork loin (not tenderloin) thanks to the reviewers suggestions, and it was beautiful.  Tender, delicious.  Just the right amount of flavoring, and very easy.

My fiance and I really enjoyed this recipe. I used loin chops and browned them in a pan before smothering them with the sauce and baking them. I adjusted baking time to about 40 min. Turned out great! Paired them with Cabbage Au Gratin, which I also recommend.

This was so simple and so good!  Even if it didn't taste as fantastic as it does, I might make it just for the smell the house is filled with while it's cooking!  Even my picky picky 10 year old daughter who we have to bribe to try new foods loved it and asks for it all the time!  This is a keeper for sure!

Great Sunday Dinner!  The meat comes out so tender you barely have to cut it.  The apple butter mixture and apple sauce give the meat a nice flavor.

Absolutely excellent! I have a sweet tooth and the combination of spices with the brown sugar was to die for. The meat was succulent, (used  pork sirloin) and very, very tasty. Loved it!

I made this for my family. I didn't have the four hours needed to cook this so I used tenderloins instead of the loins in order to cut down on cook time. This was a HUGE hit! My picky 9 year old even liked this. It also smelled wonderful cooking once the apple butter was put on it. This is a total keeper! Thanks for the wonderful recipie.

This was good my company liked them. These had a great flavore however they turned out a little dry. Next time I will have to cut even more of the cooking time off so they arent so dry. I am going to work with this recipe though because I LOVE  apple pork chops from restraunts. I hope this will turn out to be similar with the changes.

The apple juice & the apple butter with the pork is scrumptious. Well worth the wait for cook time. Nice meal to put in oven and go to garden or lawn work.

As a family we don't eat a lot of pork because it tends to be dry, but this recipe makes it very good.  It turned out tender and the flavour was excellent.  I served it with garlic mashed potaotes and mixed vegetables.  My husband and daughters, 3 yrs. and 1 yr., loved it!

This is so good!  I made it for friends & everyone loved it.  I didn't have any apple juice so I used one cup of cranberry juice & one cup of white grape peach juice & it turned out fine.  I also poured the leftover juice from the pan into a gravy boat & served it with the pork.  Delicious!

Delicious.  I also used a whole pork tenderloin.  I adjusted the cooking time and basted while it was cooking with the apple butter mixture and apple juice.  One of the tenderest tenderloins I have ever made and everyone raved.  Thanks for a great dish!

I have prepared this recipe twice so far.  The first time I made it I didn't have apple juice so I used unsweetened apple sauce (about 1/2 cup) and about 1 1/2 cups of water.  Great Christmas and New Year's Eve recipe!

I liked this recipe just fine, but the rest of my family wasn't too crazy about it.  I guess they just don't like sweet stuff!  I haven't eaten the leftovers yet, but I bet the cold pork would taste excellent on a sandwich!  Thanks!

A fantastic recipe. I would recommend adding a little more juice after the first hour to make sure it doesn't dry out on you (started to happen in my second pan), but all in all this was a great meal.

We had this for dinner last night;it was great!  Easy and fun to prepare, and what a delightful aroma filled our kitchen while it baked.  I used it with "pork loin ribs", which required a little less time in the oven than the recipe calls for. The spiced apple butter with the pork was perfect. Thanks to UMich97.

I've made this recipe 3 times. The first time, it was a hit with my family. The second time, for some reason, i followed the instructions exactly, cooking it for 3 hours and it turned out nasty dry!! It was really gross and no one wanted to eat it. That scared everyone off. But then the third time, I had a pork loin roast that I needed to get rid of, so I tried the recipe but cooked it at 325 for 1 hour and 225 for another hour, thus lowering temp. and shortening cooking time. It was amazing again! Hurray! So this one is a keeper.Pork just goes really really well with apple.

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC, but we did not cook it quite so long. I'm sure it depends on the weight of the meat. Thanks again this recipe is WONDERFUL.

I have made this a few times now, and I cant wait to make it again. The first time I made this I didnt have applebutter, so I used applesauce and butter. I did cook this in the crockpot!! Tender!!

The way that this pork was cooked turned out nicely.  It was moist and tender.  We weren't big fans of the apple butter, but this has inspired me to come up with something of my own for next time.  Thank you for the inspiration.

I just made this recipe in my pressure cooker, and it was fantastic!  I used chicken broth instead of apple juice and cooked the meat on a rack to keep it out of the liquid. I browned the meat (with the seasoning salt) first, cooked for 20 minutes, coated with the apple butter mix, and cooked for another 25 minutes. It was delicious!  I just had the few leftovers on a bed of lettuce for lunch.  Yummy!

Very good.  I seared my in a pan then put in the oven with the applesauce and apple butter mixture and cooked the pork at 350 degrees for a little over an hour.  
Came out very juicy and tastey.

I was really excited about this recipe when I read about it--it seemed simple and looked delicious.  Well, the pork was nice and tender, but I felt that the flavor was missing something.  Nice, but not spectacular.

Loved the taste, cooked for less than 2 hours to get to 160 degrees (I had thin pork loins).  Am tempted to try to do this in the crockpot.

My family liked this very much, but I thought it lacked flavor on the inside (plenty on the outside).  Doubt I'll make it again, but to be fair, I tend to be a fairly picky eater.

This recipe is very good.  I modified it a little bit to appease our spicy way of life.  I omitted the cloves from the applebutter mixture and added a table spoon of cayenne pepper.  I also cut the cooking time to 45 minutes covered and then 1/2 hour without cover after adding the applebutter mixture.  My family loved this paired with nutmeg mashed potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe.
