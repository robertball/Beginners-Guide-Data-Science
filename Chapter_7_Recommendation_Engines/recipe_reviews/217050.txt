We really enjoyed this recipe. I chopped the onion in a very fine dice, fried it with 4 cloves of garlic until it was slightly soft, then added the raw sweet potato to it, fried until the sweet potato started getting soft, then added the broccoli (I used fresh), but the lid on it, until the broccoli was done. I used roasted, unsalted almonds, which I chopped... sprinkled them on top of the finished dish along with some dried cranberries.  Ginger and cinnamon would be a nice addition, but it's very good as-is. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I got creative with this recipe based on other reviews and omitted the garlic powder, used 3 cloves fresh chopped, threw those in the pan with the onions, added all the other ingredients plus sprinkled ground ginger, some nutmeg and cinnamon then about a 1/2 cup of dried cranberries, just a hodge podge of ingredients and it turned out amazing! Each bite has a surprise of flavors and I chopped up the almonds so they weren't whole and it gives it a nice crunch.  This is one of those recipes you can't really mess up and fun to play around with.

A nice balanced dish. I used 2 sweet potatoes and fresh broccoli, and I added some ginger because I had it on hand- I think that gives the dish the flare it needs!

This was a decent dish, my family enjoyed it.  It is definitely simple and a little plain...it needed lots of soy sauce to add flavor.

I used amaranth instead of quinoa, green onions, fresh broccoli, and fresh garlic. I might have changed too much to make this an authentic review!  I think I will fry the sweet potato along with the broccoli, onion and garlic next time.  The texture of steamed sweet potatoes with the crunchiness of the grain and stir fried veggies left something to be desired. This tasted fine, but next time I will try adding ginger for additional flavor and cut back on the soy sauce!

I'm totally obsessed with quinoa right now, so I loved this recipe! I cooked everything in coconut oil and used fresh broccoli and garlic (omitted the garlic pwd.) The sweet potatoes did seem to take a long time to cook. When done, I added raw sliced almonds, dried cranberries, along with cinnamon, ginger, and salt, to taste. Very yummy; can't stop eating it!

This is simply wonderful! I used coconut oil instead of canola oil which gives it a bit of a sweet exotic flavor. The second time I made it I also added a bit of ginger as other suggested. Definately one of my favorite dishes!

I tossed the broccoli and sweet potato in EVOO and salt & pepper, and roasted in the oven until tender. Then sautéed the garlic and onion in a little olive oil until the onion was really soft. Cooked the quinoa according to the package. I tossed the broccoli, sweet potato, garlic & onion with the quinoa, then I added the almonds and (this is where I went rogue) the zest and juice of one lemon. It was soooo good!

I used pearl couscous because I was out of quinoa. Also, used fresh broccoli, onion powder, and garlic salt. Tasted great and very healthy!

I really used this recipe as inspiration for the side dish I ultimately made. I roasted sweet potato and broccoli  with olive oil, rosemary, garlic, salt and pepper (which was a separate recipe for roasted vegetables I had found). Then I cooked onion in some butter and more garlic. Stirred it all into the quinoa and added some crumbled feta cheese. So I didn't really make the same recipe, but it was really good, and this got me there.

Used real garlic  and ginger as suggested. Also used tri-color quinoa and 1/3 c sliced almonds for a prettier dish. Only used two thirds of the quinoa. About 2 cups. That was the perfect amount.  Very good.

I used red quinoa. It was delicious. Steaming the sweet potatoes speeds things up.

What a delightful recipe! I halved the recipe, steamed a sweet potato in a bag, used a quarter of an onion (not a fan of onions) and 2 garlic cloves diced fine and sautéed in coconut oil, a dash of ginger and cinnamon and dried cranberries as reviewers suggested, as well as a handful of sliced almonds. I was a little nervous that the onions would still overwhelm, but with the amount I used, it's a lovely, well-rounded dish. I didn't bother with soy sauce; it was good with just a sprinkle of salt. I'd definitely make it again!

The first time I made this, I followed the directions exactly & my whole family loved it!  Yesterday was my late night at work,so I tried throwing everything into the pressure cooker (except almonds and soy sauce) for 10 minutes.  Try it - one pan wonderful!

This was very good.  I did around 3/4 C. quinoa and 1 1/2 c. water.  I roasted 1 sweet potato and 1/2 of a bunch of broccoli.  I tossed the potato and broccoli w/EvOO and tossed them w/some ch. fresh rosemary.  I sauteed 1/2 an onion and 3 cloves c. garlic.  At the end I tossed in and sauteed a little longer, about 1/2. C. ch. almonds.  I stirred together the quinoa, roasted vegetables, onion mixture.  Then I added soy sauce to taste, some grated fresh ginger and sprinkled in some cinnamon.  I also added some feta cheese.

Made some changes like using coconut oil (not sure I really liked this change, actually) and added garlic and craisins. Overall, good dish, and I'll probably make again.

Really good! Used coconut oil, and added ginger & cinnamon as I read in others comments. Didn't have almonds, so I sprinkled unsalted raw sunflower seeds as garnish...yumm
