OMG, this is one of the best dessert recipes I have ever tried!  Thankfully, I read each and every review before trying them.  Please, people, do make the recommended adjustments and I promise you will not be disappointed!

I diced the apples and coated them with cinnamon/sugar.  I baked the dumplings on one side for 20 minutes.  Then I turned them and baked for another 10 minutes before adding the sauce.  I made up the sauce minus the water and had to add just a tablespoon or so to get it the right consistency.  I also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and ended up with this beautiful caramel sauce.  I added the sauce the last 10 minutes of cooking and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. 

I had people begging me for the recipe and I have made it twice this week.  My husband has requested that this be THE dessert for Thanksgiving dinner and I will be only to happy to oblige.  Folks, it really is awesome!

This dessert is a good idea in theory, but unfortunately, this particular recipe isn't so great. If you want this recipe to work, please be sure to read these reviews and consider the other reviewers' advice! 1) Dice or cut your apples into slices, 2) Add cinnamon/sugar to the cut apples (so it'll taste like a dessert, and not just an apple wrapped in a biscuit), 3) Use a smaller amount of liquid, or add the liquid in small amounts throughout the cooking time (don't dump it in all at once or you'll get a soggy mess!), and 4) Cook each dumpling for a few minutes on one (or both) sides before adding liquid to keep the sogginess to a minimum. If you follow those suggestions, you'll have better luck than if you use the recipe as is.

This is just too good to be true.  It was easy to prepare.  I did follow the advice of the others by using only a little water and by cutting my apples into quarters.  I used gala apples.  I also sprinkled the apples with a little cinnamon and sugar before wrapping them with the croissant dough.  And I baked for about 5 minutes before adding the liquid mixture and I used half brown sugar half white sugar.  These were sooooooooooooooooooooooo good.  You must eat it with vanilla ice cream.   I am going to make another batch today.

DELICIOUS!  I followed all of the suggestions...diced apples and sprinkled w/cinnamon and sugar, reduce the water in the sauce (I mixed everything else together and then added water gradually until I had the consistance I wanted), cooked for 10 minutes before adding the sauce.  I made two dumplings (used 1 diced apple) with the "grand" crescent rolls.  I only baked for 27 minutes and it was perfect.

This recipe has wonderful flavor. Easy to prepare. I,too, decreased the water to 1/2 c. and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and used Grands Flaky Biscuits. Next time -I will dice apples and turn the dumplings over during baking to get the underside brown and more done.

This recipe is wonderful!!  I took it to a women's meeting at the church and it got rave reviews.  I used Pillsbury cinnamon and sugar flakey bisquits (eliminates the need to season apples before wrapping)and baked the apples 10 min before pouring on the sauce.  I also eliminated the water as suggested by other reviews, and added 1/2 cup pecans to the sauce (note: the pecans taste wonderful with this, but add considerable work to washing the dish...  it was worth it!)  Thanks Carol, for a wonderful dish!

These tasted like apple pie! I diced up the apples rather than halfed them and sprinkled cinnamon, sugar, and a little nutmeg on before I wrapped them. I also only used 1/4 cup water and that was more than enough.  This was delicious! Definately worth trying.

The 1st recipe I tried from this site. Following other's suggestions, I reduced water/sugar/butter, sliced apples, and sprinkled them with cinnamon prior to sealing. I also let it bake ten minutes before adding the sauce, turning each dumpling beforehand. I daresay they were PERFECT! Fast, easy, and oh so yummy!

The first time I made this recipe I cut the butter in half, and it still turned out great.  The second time, I eliminated it altogether with great results.  Quick, nummy and fun for the kids to help with preparing!  Great recipe!

This recipe was very good with vanilla ice cream. i cut the amount of butter in half and it worked just as well. i also used cinnamon roll biscuit dough instead of regular and it added to the cinnamon flavor. the only bad thing was that i covered the dish with a top when it was done and it ended up getting a little soggy. but it was still good with the ice cream.

Excellent dessert with a few modifications. Use tart apples and be sure to peel them. Slice them using an apple slicer and toss the pieces with 2 tsp brown sugar, 2 tsp white sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Stretch that dough out and pack 4 apple slices into each round (this will keep the dessert from being too "doughy" as other reviewers have said). When you mix the sauce, use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white suagr and add the water gradually to get a nice consistency; i used 2/3 cups but could have gotten away with only 1/2, easy. Don't pour this over the apples right away. Bake them for 15 minutes then flip them over and bake them for 10 more. Now pour the sauce over and bake for another 10-15. Serve it up with some cool whip and watch them disappear! SO GOOD :)

BEWARE!  The original recipe is not what earned the stars of other reviewers...Read the reviews.  Most cooks have had to alter the recipe dramatically.  My review:  The use of sugar, butter, and cinnamon does not overcome the fact that biscuit dough does not suffice for apple treats.  Even after following the unanimous recommendations, the overall end product is simply not great.  On the other hand, the filling (using the recommendations of Orange juice, no water, more cinnamon, brown sugar for 1/2 the sugar) is quite outstanding, and I will probably use it with some type of apple dessert in the future.  Not a good recipe, but I do appreciate the other reviewer's help in finding such a great syrup/filling.  Last note:  these were good enough to be liked by those who ate them at a function, but not enough for anyone to rave about them.

This was a very quick and easy recipe that was all the more enjoyable because my 4-yr-old daughter was able to help.  I used McIntosh apples and it turned out great!  Thank you, Carol, for the great easy recipe!!

I peeled 2 apples and used an apple corer that also made 8 equal segments. I rolled out a Grand's Flaky Biscuit and placed 3 or 4 quarters inside the dough. I pulled the sides up and pinched at the top. This reminded me of an old fashioned apple dumpling that I grew up eating. I baked it in the oven for 10 minutes at 350 degrees. Meanwhile, I melted on the stove, butter, sugar, vanilla and water. I let it come to a quick boil and then took it off the heat. I think that helped to thicken it back up. (although, I think you could use less water in the recipe) Then I poured that over the dumplings and I think since the pinched dough was at the top, the "juice" poured down inside the dumpling and helped to flavor the apples. I sprinkled with cinnamon and baked 30 minutes more. I served with cinnamon ice cream.

I hosted a dessert party for a Christmas dinner and these were the first to go. I used Cresent rolls instead of bisquits and I cut the water to half and added orange juice.(a trick from an old apple recipe) Sounds funny but you would not believe the difference. It adds the perfect balance to the apples. Superb. I am asked constantly to make these...a real keeper.

Wow!  I can't imagine a dessert any better.  I followed the other users and used 1/2 cup water, 1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar, and half the butter.  Sliced apples, sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, and wrapped.  Placed on cooking sheet, baked for 15 mins one side, turned and baked 15 mins, then covered with sauce.  Bake until done, awesome!

Love these with the suggested modifications, but I will tweak the recipe even further next time.  As recommended, I diced  and cinn/sugared the apples before wrapping them in the dough.  Per other reviewers' advice, I altered the sauce (1/4 c white sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/2 c orange juice, 1/4 c melted butter, 
2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon), and it was incredible.  The biggest issue that I had was that the bottoms did not cook all of the way through on my first try (even though I did bake the apples/biscuits for 10 minutes prior to adding the sauce), so next time I will precook the apples/biscuits for 15 minutes first – until they begin to brown. Maybe my apples were too big, but I didn't even end up using all the diced pieces from three medium apples (I think 2 apples would be enough next time), and I had a hard time getting the dough securely around the apple pieces -- next time I will flatten the biscuit rounds as thinly as possible to stretch further around the apples Overall, though, DELICIOUS -- great as a dessert or for a brunch, and as good cold as they are warm!

DO NOT USE BISCUIT DOUGH!!!! AND THESE WILL BE SO GOURMET!
Followed TOFCHRIS's sugg. For 4 Good dumplings (either 2/person or 1/person):
1 pie crust, cut in QUARTERS & PRESSED OUT for more coverage for the apple -- 2 Apples (I used Gala), peeled, cut in half & cored -- 1/4 c. Brown Sugar, 1/4 cup White Sugar -- 1/2 STICK melted UNSALTED Butter -- 1/4 cup OJ -- 1 tsp Vanilla -- 1/2 tsp Cinnamon (I like Cinn)
I feathered the apples (kept it in tact on one end, but sliced it thin 3/4 of the way through, so the sugar sauce can penetrate).
Butter a square dish.  Combine sugars, oj, butter, vanilla, cinn.  Dip 1/2'd apples in, place on pie crust & WRAP IT UP!  Place in square dish, flat seamed side down.  Bake FIRST DRY (w/o any sauce), for 10-15 min.  Then drizzle 1/2 the sauce over, bake 15 min.  Drizzle the rest, bake 15-20  min.  Serve w/ ice cream... DRIZZLE THE SAUCE FROM THE PAN ONTO THE ICE CREAM!!!

These dumplings are positively scrumptious!  Most everyone who eats them asks me for the recipe.  They are always a huge hit!  I use Pillsbury Grandes biscuits, half the amount of water, and I usually triple the cinnamon.  And I must confess, I even lick my plate when I'm finished...

Just made these thi evening and ate warm with french vanilla ice-cream. I was worried because when I went to put it together, I realised I had less than a tsp of vanilla. I added a splash of grand marnier to the sauce and they were amazing. Others I made, I found way too sweet,t his one is just perfect!

So. Yeah. These rule. I diced the apples, sprinkled them with brown sugar and cinnamon, and filled the dough "pockets" to the brim. I basted each pastry with butter, cooked for 20 minutes then flipped and basted again. I started the syrup on the stove, using 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. I did not reduce the water. After allowing that to just simmer for about 15 minutes, I poured it over the pastries with about 10 minutes left. Just long enough to soak in. Served with vanilla ice cream, and pouring the remaining syrup over the whole lot - hol-eeee cow. SO yummy. Addendum to my original review: I made another batch of smaller dumplings - just halved the biscuits, put a heaping teaspoon of the apples inside, and did everything else the same way, including the 40 minutes. Delish, and they're awesome for the luncheon I have tomorrow!!!

This is way better than apple pie!  The water amount definitely needs to be smaller and also the apples are great diced and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.  I also added walnuts and some extra apples... sooo good.

It's sooo good! Hmmm Yummm... I halved the apples, sliced it thinly but made sure it was still in tact, used the "best ever pie crust" recipe from this site which truly is the best!, instead of biscuits, and it still came out delicious. Substitute the water with OJ, half brown sugar half white sugar, baked it dry 10 min, flip it over and baked for another 10 min, poured the sauce on, put it back to the oven for another 15 to 20 min. SOOO GOOD!

I've always used my grandmother's apple dumpling recipe for the holidays - my family's all-time favorite dessert - but it takes so long to make the pastry that I just didn't have time this year. I made these instead, and my family actually preferred this quicker version; I had to make them three times over Christmas because they disappeared so fast! The only thing I changed was the sauce - I added some extra cinnamon and doubled the recipe, as apple dumplings tend to dry out when reheated. I'll definitely be using this recipe from now on.

Gimme a break - these are awesome.  Here's a compliment - my husband took the first bite and said "I think this is the best thing I've ever eaten in my life."  My recommendations - use 1/3 cup water or none at all, buy the Grands bisquits - they wrap easily around 1/2 an apple, and turn half way though baking - otherwise they come out a little soggy on the bottom.  I also used macintosh apples and put 1/2 tsp cinnamon in the sauce, as well as sprinking some on top.  Yummilicious - can't wait to feed to company tonight.  The best part - so EASY and fast! Don't forget the vanilla ice cream!

Excellent flavors and quite easy.  I made adjustments based on some reviews.  Perhaps should have read more reviews as I diced up 3 apples (instead of the recommended halved 4 apples) and couldn't fit all the apple pieces into the biscuit dough.  I tossed apple pieces with cinnamon sugar.  Baked dumplings for about 15-20 minutes without sauce.  I couldn't flip dumplings over as they were placed too closely together in baking dish and baked together making it difficult to flip dumplings over.   Didn't add water to sauce but added leftover apple pieces so got liquid from that.  Poured sauce (with leftover apples) over dumplings and cooked additional 15 minutes.  The apples in the sauce were less cooked than the ones inside the dumplings due to less time in the oven.  However, the family agreed it made for a nice combination to have some fully cooked apples and others slightly cooked so still a little firm.  We actually had this for breakfast so didn't add ice cream.  I do think I'll try baking with sauce from beginning next time to see what we think about that, or I might try a 9 x 13 dish and separate the dumplings more for initial baking if I chose to add sauce later.  I will also probably up the cinnamon to at least 3/4 tsp as family loves cinnamon.  Recently discovered Saigon cinnamon and very pleased with the flavor.

I made this with crescents (instead of biscuits) and fresh peaches (instead of apples). Just diced them up and tossed in cinnamon and regular/brown sugar. Top with the sauce and they will not be mushy. Serve with Bluebell Vanilla Ice Cream. In the words of the infamous Rachael Ray...YUM-O!!! People could not get enough of this; so now I make it all the time!

My whole family went crazy over this recipe. We usually have to visit a nearby Apple Ranch for their Apple Dumplings which are $5 a piece. Now I can make my own any time I want. I just made them today and already my husband wants to know when I am making them again!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used orange juice instead of water and half white and brown sugars.  I also baked them for about 10 minutes before I added the sauce. If you use orange juice you may want to decrease the amount of sugar you use since the oj is sweet.  Maybe only use 34 of a cup of sugar.  Thanks for sharing

These were pretty easy to make and were soooo good. I made some where I diced the apples and mixed them with cinnamon and sugar, and those were even better! Everyone said they were the best. Really great with vanilla icecream on top too.

Entire family liked this one. I got everything ready ahead of time and baked it while we finished our main course. I put the dumpings in a glass pan and covered it tight with plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator. I poured the liquid topping when I was ready to bake it. The apples didn't turn brown and I didn't even use lemon juice! I also reduced the water and sugar to 2/3 cup.

Delicious!  I wouldn't recommend doing halves, definitely needs to be smaller slices.  I, too, dip the slices in cinnamon/sugar before wrapping.

I had to whip up a quick dessert and found this and decided to try it. I am so happy I tried it and so were the group of guys I made this for. I did follow the recomendations and used less water  in the sauce and the 1/2c of brown and white sugar. I also  covered the apples with cinnamon sugar before making them. Flipped them over after 20 minutes and then poured the sauce for the last 10.  It came out divine! The only thing was that 4 apples were way too many. Next time I will only use three. You bet I will be making this one again.

I have been making this recipe for a few years and I am now just rating it.  My kids and husband love it.  Instead of water, I use apple juice and I add a teaspoon of vanilla.  Like other reviewers, I also use half brown sugar and half regular sugar.  Great recipe!

This recipe was super easy and tasted great!  I used several of the substitutions I read in the other reviews (1/2 C oj instead of 1 C water, 1/2 C brown and 1/2 C white sugar, and bake for 10 minutes before adding the sauce).  Following those guidelines it was great.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe for themselves!

I love this recipe! I often make it for potlucks. I do cut the water in half and add more vanilla. I cut up the apples in smaller cubes and put them in a baking dish. I use the cinnamon flaky layers biscuits and then drizzle the sauce on top. It is soooo delicious and such a hit every time I make it.

This was an amazing dessert and so simple to make.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used less water, 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, and waited about 10 minutes into the cooking time before I added the sauce.  My husband thought they were restaurant quality!  I will definitely make these again - soon!

Awesome! We loved these.I followed other reviews and seasoned the apples first and cut them into smaller slices. (I doubled the sauce as well.)  Next time I make them for breakfast and let the kids put the sauce on some oatmeal, That should get them to eat there oatmeal!!!  
Thank you Carol.

i like the concept of this recipe.. i used cin. roll dough instead but i made it like a pie... i placed the rolls on the bottom of a 9 by 13 pan... placed in the oven for 10 minutes to crisp up.... cut up the apples and rolled in cin, and sugar... put them over the dough and then rolled out the rest of the dough and placed over the apples.... put in oven for 15 minutes and then put the sauce over them little by little as they cooked...so the wouldnt get too mushy... the top was crisp and all you have to do is scoop them out when they are finished....pouring a little carmel over them and a scoop of ice cream... it was easy and fast,,, i cooked for 40 minutes all together....and i also used less water and added brown sugar to the sauce.....

These were delicious.  We took other bakers ques and diced the apples and tossed them in some cinnamon & brown sugar before wrapping them.  We also cut the water down in the sauce.  I am glad to have found these in time for Fall!

This is an exceptional recipe!  It is so delicious it is unbelievable. I took a patch of apple dumplings to work and they were a hit.  I have shared this recipe with 10 other people, who have shared it with others, too.  My variation on this recipe was to use the cheaper canned biscuits (10 to a container) and use the typical small red apples that are in the 5 or 10 pound bags. Everyone was truly amazed they were made with biscuits and not pie crust!  The sauce is wonderful.

I LOVE this recipe!!  Fairly easy to make and absolutely delicious!!!  I have made a few changes based upon others' great ideas:
I diced the apples and coated them with cinnamon/sugar. I baked the dumplings on one side for 20 minutes. I made up the sauce minus the water and had to add just a tablespoon or so to get it the right consistency. I also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and ended up with this beautiful caramel sauce. Then I turned the dumplings and baked for another 10 minutes. I added the sauce the last 10 minutes of cooking.

This was an awesome recipe.  I thought it was more of a breakfast recipe, but on some of the reviews it said that it was really a dessert item.  I think this had a really good sauce!!!  When you're trying to figure out when biscuits are golden you can't really see in the oven because of the light so you will have to take it out of the oven to see it.  If you take the dumplings out at the right time it will be crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I think the cinnamon on top tasted great, but I don't think you need to measure it.  I think it was one of my favorite sauces ever.  This recipe is perfect for breakfast because it just the right amount of sweetness (I only put in 2/3 of a cup of sugar).  Also, my biscuit container was smaller than you're suppose to put it in.  In which case just cook it for about 20-30 min.  This a great recipe.  I will probably make this recipe again.  (As written by my 10 yr old 'chef.')

ALL-TIME FAVORITE!  I used butter-flavored Grands Biscuits.  Sprinkle your sliced apples AND the biscuits with cinnamon/sugar.  To avoid the "soggy bottom," I melted just enough butter to lightly cover the bottom of my baking dish and baked the dumplings (without the syrup) for about 20 minutes.  Then, I poured 1/2 the syrup over the top of the dumplings and finished baking---about another 25 minutes.  Use the remaining syrup to glaze the dumplings when they are done baking or save for serving time.  When making the syrup, I used the hint to add-in just enough liquid (water, OJ, mountain dew) to achieve the desired consistency.  These dumplings were picture perfect--tender, flavorful apples, sweet syrup and no soggy dough.  Simply delicious and do not forget the ice cream!

Absolutely amazing!  Dice the apples up and mix with a little cinnamon and sugar before sealing up (I also mix in a splash of lemon juice with the apples).  I used a little bit less butter and half brown sugar half white sugar.  I needed almost the full cup of water, just depends on the consistency you want for the sauce.  Bake the biscuits before adding the sauce as other reviewers have stated then bake about ten minutes more with the sauce.   This dessert is insane, so darn good.

So easy and very yummy! Made this for 2 servings as I had only 2 biscuits left (used the other biscuits for a different recipe) so of course I had to adjust the rest of the recipe. Placed it in remikens. Minor changes: used mountain dew in place of water (yea, stole the idea from the highly rated apple dumplings) and mix the cinnamon along with the rest. Probably cut down the mixture a tad bit next time.

My husband loved this dessert; he said it was just like the dessert that he gets at a steak house he loves.  Do follow the previous reviewer's suggestions--dice the apples and toss them with cinnamon & sugar.  Makes the big difference.  Fabulous served warm with vanilla ice cream!!

I made these last night and served them with a scoop of butter pecan ice cream. Macoun apples worked beautifully in this recipe, and I followed suite by chopping the apples and tossing them lightly with cinnamon and sugar. I didn't use as much butter as asked and I still though the recipe came out incredibly. An excellent dessert for those who want something homemade, but don't have the time to whip up the dough. I would've given it 10 stars if I had the option!!!

These are the best thing ever!! I did make a few changes though. As other reviewers suggested I chopped my apples and added sugar, cinamon, and a tad of flour to them. When making the vanilla sauce I used half brown sugar and have white sugar as others suggested and then just added water till I got the consistancy I wanted. I only poured half of the mixture over the dumplings after I had cooked them 10 min and turned them over. The other half I cooked on the stove untill it became a thick rich carmel sauce. I served them warm with ice cream and the extra carmel sauce and they were delicious!! I think I could eat the whole pan myself!!

Awesome recipe! I used a half cup of brown sugar and a half cup of white sugar.  I also cut the apples into smaller pieces and coated them in sugar and cinnamon before putting them in the dough.  I didn't add the sauce about 5 minutes before they were supposed to come out of the oven.  I also rotated the dumplings after 20 minutes and again after 10.

I took others advice and chopped the apples first then I sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar. I didn't have refrigerated biscuits so I made my own.  They were a little  difficult to flip but they tasted great. I did as others did and cooked for 20 minutes then flipped for the last 10 minutes.  I added the sauce during those last 10 minutes. I limited the water as suggested by others but the consistency was to thick in my book.  I think next time I will cut the butter a little and add just a little more water to thin it out( probably not the amount called for in the recipe though).  I will say my husband loved them just as they were.  I will definitely make these again.

I used flaky honey butter biscuits and rolled out as large as possible.(5").Added sugar and cinnamon to diced apples and put as much as possible (about 1/4 c./biscuit)on each biscuit. Because I put too many apples, I could not fold them up so I put another rolled out biscuit on top and sealed edges. Then baked 20 minutes, turned, baked 10 minutes then added butter,sugar sauce. Bake 10 more minutes. I reduced the water in butter sauce to about 1 T. as other reviewers suggested. These were delicious!

This has become a family favorite. I substitute the full cup of sugar and water with apple juice and brown sugar. Adding a little ground clove and nutmeg gives it nice extra something.

A big hit even with my husband who normally doesn't like pie crust. I used Golden Flakes honey butter biscuits and for the sauce I added sugar to the butter on the stove to disolve it, then added nothing more than the vanilla and I poured that over the dumplings. To die for!

I thought this recipe would be great, but I wasn't impressed with the way mine came out. I followed the directions exactly. It was very easy to make, but the sauce was too watery and the dough just didn't go well with the apples. I used pillsbury crescent dough, so maybe I got the wrong kind. My whole apartment smelled delicious while baking, but then the actual taste wasn't as good as I had expected.

I made this recipe with my junior girl scout troop and it was delicious.  Super easy to make and bake, the girls had fun coring the apples and wrapping the biscuit dough around them, we did not peel the apples as directed on the recipe, thus the apple baked nicely inside the peel and the biscuit.  I doubled the recipe with no problems and did cut down on the liquid and sprinkled cinnamon on top.  Definitely an easy recipe to follow and enjoy, the girls all want their own copy of the recipe to share with their families.

I was surprised how good this recipe was.  I dipped the apples in the butter/sugar/water mixture before I put them in the dumpling, and I think next time I will actually add a little caramel to the apple.  I also used a dash of cinnamon in the mixture, which I thought gave it a little kick.  But, like I said, this recipe is DELICIOUS!

This was the most incredible dish and my guests went crazy over it...and I my mother cleaned her plate with her finger! Here's how I incorporated other's suggested variations to this recipe which is why it was so good!

Cook time: 45 min.
Makes about 14 servings (2 dumplings ea.)

4 pre-made piecrusts		
2 sticks of butter (1 c.) melted
7 apples peeled, cored, spiral sliced 4 tsp. Vanilla extract
1 c. brown sugar		
1 tsp. Ground cinnamon
1 c. white sugar 
1 c. orange juice

Butter a 9x13 dish
combine sugar, orange juice, melted butter, vanilla and cinnamon. Cut each spiral cut apple into quarters. Dip each ¼ (about 4-5 thin slices) into the mixture and wrap in piecrust.
Put in oven and bake uncovered for 10min before drizzling ½ of the mixture over the dumplings. After an additional 15 minutes or so drizzle the remaining mixture over the apples as desired. Cook time should be a total of approximately 45 minutes. Serve warm with heavy whipping cream drizzled over each dumpling and a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side.

Absolutely fantastic.  I think I've made these at least 10 times in the last month.  Everybody loves them.  I found they tasted better using 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  Also suggest serving them warm with heavy whipping cream poured over the top.  Sinful!

Yummy! I made this for dessert one night for some friends and they raved about it long after it was gone. Instead of peeling, coring, and halving fresh apples, I just bought a can of Comstock apples (you can use the fresh apples or the compote) and you could not tell the difference. It came out incredible. I served it with vanilla bean ice cream. Sweet!

Wonderfull desert even my mother-in-law gave me a complament! I took the advice of several of the reviews and changed the sugar to 1/2 cup white , 1/2 cup brown, and substituted orange juice for the water and only used 1/2 cup, it does make a difference the sauce is thicker and richer!!!!!!!

This is a great, and fatty recipe - so easy to make too! I typically use croissant dough, and it turns out really well too. I have also begun to add ground cinnamon to the apples before i wrap them so that there's a sugary, cinnamony sweet surprise inside. Definitely a keeper, especially for cold winter days!

I thought these were bland.  I made a second
batch & cut up the apples & added cinnamon & sugar, but they still didn't come out very good..
Similar recipe, Apple Crisp II is incredible, I would recommend making that instead.

What an awesome recipe!  Great tasting, easy to make!  I bought the large buttermilk biscuits and small apples, it worked PERFECTLY!  I would also reduce the amount of water next time... but the taste was wonderful.  I served it with vanilla ice cream... yummy!  Thanks for sharing!

These were fantastic! I did take the advice from other reviews and only used about half of the water it calls for. I also replaced 1/4 of the white sugar with brown sugar. They were a huge hit! I will definately make these again! Thanks!!!

I followed the recipe, but the cooking time wasn't long enough for me, they were still very doughy on the bottom (the biscuit dough hadn't cooked all the way through) and the apples were still pretty hard, if I'd left it in another 15-20 minutes I think it would've been perfect. The taste was really good, but I think (as others have mentioned) the amount of water could've/should've been reduced!

This is a SUPER recipe!  Thank you Carol!  I have made these many times and have found that the best way is to quarter the apples and use the regular sized bisquits.  I also sprinkle apples with cinnamon before wrapping in the dough and put cinnamon in the butter sauce...and skip the water.  MacIntosh apples work great because they soften so easily.  My whole family loves these...had them for breakfast Christmas morning! Thanks!

EXCELLENT!!! These are excellent just as recipe list. I made two batches at once, one per recipe. Great. The other batch w/ the following....added some xtra vanilla (dble), xtra cinnamon, and added a few raisins in with the apples and a few on the top! Excellent!! Big hit!! Also, different apples can change taste...granny smith, etc....you can mix. Think a feww chopped nuts inside w/ apples may work too.

This is a wonderful and easy dessert recipe! To add even more to the flavor and texture, I sprinkled the rolled out dough with cinnamon, placed the apple flat-side up, and filled the apple core with chopped pecans before wrapping it with the dough. These dumplings are great served with a little scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. I will definitely make these again and again.

I used puff pastry instead of the biscuit dough, and cooked them for 25 minutes in a 400 oven.
I also used only 1/2 cup of water.  The sauce was good, but there wasn't a lot of it.

Simple and tasty.  I used crescent rolls, keeping them in squares rather than  tearing the dough apart into triangles.  In other words, one package of 8 crescent rolls gives you 4 apple dumplings.  I sprinkled cinnamon on the dough before wrapping it around the apple quarters.  Someone suggested to use only 1/4 cup of water, which I did.  I think that next time I will use 1/2 a cup of water.  I turned the dumplings half way through baking, and they weren't doughy at all when done.  Served with vanilla ice-cream (a must!)

All I can say is YUM!  These are so excellent I;ll never reveal how many I ate right in a row.  (I made them without the water in the recipe and liked them better, though...more syrupy.)

These dumplings rock! Everyone enjoyed them so much more than ones made with a pastry dough.  You've got to serve these hot---right out of the oven.  I spooned some of that lovely sauce from the bottom of the pan over the tops of the dumplings and served them with vanilla ice cream.  Delightful.

Made these just like the recipe says, and they were delicious!!! My entire family enjoyed them. The only reviewer recommendation I followed was turning them with about 10 minutes of baking left. I'll make them again and I won't change a thing. I was a little nervous about how much liquid I poured into the dish, but it thickened nicely while baking.

These were okay.  I diced up the apples as suggested and they smelled wonderful while cooking.  I ended up throwing out the leftovers and no one really said anything about them.  I don't think I would make them again and if I did I would change them around which in turn would make them a completley different recipe.

I made this using the suggestions posted.  I cubed the apples and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar per my tastes.  I baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  While the dumplings baked, I prepared the syrup.  The syrup part: 1/4 cup water, 1/2 cup each of white and brown sugar, 1/2 cup butter and the 2 tsp of vanilla.  I cooked the liquid on top of the stove over low heat and brought it to a boil.  This helps to dissolve the sugar.  After the 20 minutes baking time, I removed the dumplings from the oven and poured the syrup around the edges.  I sprinkled a bit more cinnamon on top of the dumplings and returned them to the oven to bake another 13 minutes.  Delicious!  This is an easy recipe  and one to take on a camping trip or vaction at the beach when I don't want to drag a whole lot of ingredients.

This recipe is perfect...sweet & delicious.  It you Yankees like your dumplings dry & crisp, then add less water, but 'us' Southerners like our dumplings moist and juicy.

Very delicious! I made a few changes though.
I only needed 2 1/2-3 apples.  I cut them into smaller pieces (instead of big slices).  I then mixed them with cinnamon & sugar and let them soak in the fridge for about an hour.  I also used a little less butter and about 3/4 cups of sugar. Very yummy with vanilla ice cream!

I liked this recipe better than another apple dumpling recipe I'd tried.  However, the sauce was too rich.  Maybe I'll cut down on the butter next time.  I cut down the sugar to 3/4 cup and I doubled the cinnamon, and I'm glad I did!  Also, the crust was terrific, but the apples inside were still hard.  I think next time, I'll poke them with a fork and see if they get more tender that way.

I loved this recipe, however, it's important to take al the reviews and suggestions into consideration.  I read the reviews, and I sliced the apples and sprinkled them with cinnamon and sugar.  I also baked them without the sauce (20 minutes on one side, 10 on the other).  I actually didn't even bake them in the sauce, I just drizzled it over the dumplings and ice cream when they were done.

Awesomely delicious! I read a page of reviews before I tried making this and agreed with most folks that 2 medium apples is plenty. I also tried the 1/2 c sugar and 1/2 c (dark) brown sugar combination and it tasted heavenly. I stirred and watched the mixture to see if it would need water- I didn't think so, but I put about 2 TB in, just in case. Not sure if water is necessary at all because the butter makes the mixture runny enough to pour. I really appreciated this recipe! Thanks!

Easy, cheap, and DELISH.  Followed the recipe almost exactly except for mixing in the cinammon with the melted butter instead of sprinkling on top.  I only needed 2 Granny Smiths to make the recipe, and I used generic jumbo butter biscuits from the grocery store.  No need to make it any more complicated.  A favorite at home and with pals!

These are great! Very tasty. I couldn't stop eating them. The only thing I differently was I put some brown sugar on top of them before baking and used less white sugar. My mom just came back from Apple Hill (CA) and talked about an apple pie with brown sugar in the filling. This came out so good! Thanks so much for this recipe!

This recipe was so good.I have made it more than once and never disappointed. It's apple season here and let me tell you I have tried alot of apples but the best are the granny smith they help with all the sugar. I also fellowed some changes to this recipe . I did 1/2 white and 1/2 brown suger ,cut apples,I sugared the apples, used grand biscuits, and turned them after 15 mins.  If they don't turn out the first time don't be afraid to try it again. These are super.

The kids loved helping with this one.  They LOVED it!  I thought the bottoms ended up a little too doughy, but I probably could have baked them a few minutes longer.  It was a quick and easy dessert that I know we'll make again and again.  I added cinnamon to the apples before wrapping them too. Thanks!

I ended up peeling and cutting the apple up. I layered the dough and the apple and poured the sauce over. I used 2/3 cup of water, about 2/3 cup of sugar, 1/3 cup of butter. Also added pumpkin pie spice to it. The sauce was great, and I got lots of compliments, but some people said it was a bit 'bready', probably because I did the layering thing. Made for Father's Day breakfast, we enjoyed, thanks for the post!

It's been a few years since I first tried this recipe, but I had apples and biscuits on hand, so I pulled out the recipe again.  I wanted to eat this for breakfast, so I made the following mods: used 4 biscuits (the ones they sell individual wrapped -- it's new), 2 fairly large gala apples; I mixed 2 Tbsp white sugar with 1 tsp cinnamon; peeled, cored, and quartered the apples and mixed with juice from half a lemon. Stirred apples with cinnamon sugar.  Wrapped each dumpling and baked for 40 minutes, flipping them halfway. I skipped the sauce altogether b/c the biscuit is buttery enough. It was awesome like this.  Next time I would slice the apples thinner (slice each quarter 3-4 times) so that the apples get more tender.  Then I think it will have an apple pie consistency.

This recipe was just like the apple dumplings I remember as a kid! Very yummy.

I did take the advice of others, and not use as much water with the sauce, and I did use pie crust instead of  biscuit dough. I did let the apples sit in 2TBS sugar and 1tsp of cinnamon, before adding them to the pie crust.

I don't know how this recipe got to be so highly rated.  I reread the recipe several times to make sure that I just hadn't fixed it wrong.  It was kind of tasty, but definitely not 5-star worthy.  I would have liked more flavor and less sweetness.  It was definitely better warmed up the next day.

This recipe is perfect! DO NOT CHANGE ONE THING.  I've tried it with orange juice and it did NOT taste right.  Even 1/2 cup of orange juice competes with the buttery vanilla flavor...the recipe is just fine the way it is.

THIS RECIPE IS WONDERFUL!! I MADE IT FOR A FAMILY GET TOGETHER AND IT WAS A HIT! MY GRANDMA SAID IT WAS WONDERFUL AND THEN SHE SAID THAT SHE DOESN'T SAY THAT ABOUT JUST ANY APPLE DISH! I DID EXCHAGE THE WATER FOR ORANGE JUICE AND DID HALF BROWN SUGAR AND HALF WHITE SUGAR I ALSO MADE 16 DUMPLINGS IN A 9X13 PAN AND ONLY USED 1/4 OF AN GRANNY SMITH APPLE BAKED FOR ABOUT 45 MIN MAKE SURE TO TRIPLE THE SAUSE IF YOU DO THIS SO THEY DON'T GET TO DRY! I WILL MAKE THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN WE ALL LOVED THEM THANK YOU CAROL !

A little rich because of all the butter, next time I will use half of what is called for.  Also because it makes too much sauce.

I love serving this when I entertain. I get so many compliments every time I make it. I do use less water than what it calls for - about 1/2 less. It's an excellent dessert.

Big hit with guests!! Agree only 1/2 cup water needed, also bake 5-10 min before adding liquids. Cutting up apples made it a bit harder to wrap. Will try slicing but keep the slices together.I also added sugar, cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg to apples before baking. Thanks Carol for this GREAT recipe

For some reason this didn't work for me.  The apples were too big for the biscuits, it took forever to prepare the recipe, and the mixture just kinda sunk to the bottom of the pan - didn't flavor them well at all.  I think next time I'll try another recipe.

This was wonderfully easy.  I quartered the apples so the biscuit would cover them completely.  My family really enjoyed this dessert.  This would be great to serve guests because it makes a lovely presentation when plated.  Thanks for the great recipe.

My teenage daughter found this recipe and we ended up making it together for our dessert last night.  It was delicious!  I went back and read the reviews later and next time I will try adding cinnamon and sugar to the apples before wrapping and maybe decrease the water a little.  Still, they were great just by going by the recipe.  A Keeper!

Oh my gosh! These were delicious and so easy. I used peeled Golden Delicious apples and the large Grande biscuits and they turned out perfect. Hot out of the oven with vanilla ice cream could not be beat.

YUM, YUM, YUM!!!  I loved these! I followed others suggestions by browning the apples first before putting the sauce on. They did get a little soggy the last few minutes, so I will probably cut the cooking time down to 30 minutes or so. I will also peel the apple before cooking it. The peel was a little tough. I added chopped pecans to the core and additional cinnamon to the jumbo biscuit dough. I think the next time I might try using the cinnamon roll dough. I served it with vanilla bean ice cream. It was fantastic!!

I have a very convoluted story as to how I came to trying this recipe that starts out with me thinking about Mr. Furley from 'Three's Company'... ANYWAYS, I'm a notorious 'half-reader' of recipes which a good portion of the time comes back to bite me in the butt. When a recipe call for store bought, refrigerated biscuits, I always sustitute it with Baking Powder Biscuits I from AR (made with butter instead of shortening) with beautiful results. So AFTER I had finished making up a batch of baking powder biscuit dough, I then read that it was supposed to be FLAKY biscuits... (sigh) Will I ever learn? Never the less, I made the most often reccommended changes and even with my little snaffu the were FANTASTIC :)

I've been making these for years.  Everyone loves them.  Only difference is that I pour the "sauce" around the dumplings and not over them.  I also, sprinkle the tops of the dumplings with a cinnamon sugar mixture like you would sprinkle on cinnamon toast.

We loved these! I read the reviews and decided to chop the apples and reduced the sugar as well as use brown sugar,too.  Also cooked them separately from the sauce and added it to them after baking. Absolutely delicious-will definitely make again!

How wonderful this recipe is! I used canned apples instead just to cut the time and I used less than 1/4 cup of water per other reccomendations. I believe next time I will use less butter, but still they came out fantastic... Thanks for sharing!!

This is a great recipe!  I tried it with biscuit dough and with crescent rolls, both work well!  I did cut up the apples into chunks, and sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar.  I baked the dumplings for 10 minutes without the sauce, then poured on about 2/3 of the sauce and baked for another 25 minutes.  They were beautiful.  I poured some of the leftover sauce on top.  These were not soggy at all, in fact they were just right!  SO EASY!

I followed the recommended modifications and these were so good.  I chopped up my apples and tossed them with some brown sugar and cinnamon.  I used half of a flaky layer biscuit per dumpling.  I filled them as full as possible, baked them for 20 minutes, flipped, baked 20 minutes more and poured the sauce over the last 10 minutes.  I think next time I will only use maybe 1/4 cup water though.  Delicious!!!

I think this is a great recipe as is,made with the instructions and ingredients given, and really don't understand how others rate a recipe that they have completely changed.

My entire family was wowed! I diced the apples and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar and used a tad less water. I didn't put the sauce on until the last 10 mins as others have suggested. Lovely!

These things have GOT to be illegal in 49 states!!  They're just too good to be true!!  I followed pretty much all the reviews but got frustrated after awhile!  There are just so many reviews and so many changes!  So here's another one for ya:  I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup white and 1/4 cup brown since people were saying they were too sweet (turned out perfectly).  I also used Pillsbury pre-made pie crusts instead of biscuits.

Flavor is great, but the mess is not, but leave the pan soaking in the sink for the night and cleaning is easy. I ended up cooking for 40 minutes. They weren't the prettiest things, but everyone loved them.

Four apples is way too much, one or two apples would have been fine. These turned out a bit too doughy and came apart. I would not make this again.

I didn't make the original recipe as it was written, but with the changes I made this is most DEFINITELY a FIVE STAR recipe!  WOW!!!!!!!!  I used green apples because they are a little more tart than the red ones, and with all the sweetness going on in this recipe, I am glad I went with the green.  I chopped them up into small pieces.  Then I sprinkled some cinnamon sugar into the apples before folding them into the dough.  I baked them for ten minutes, then flipped and baked an add'l ten mins.  Meanwhile, I left out all of the water, used 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/2 c white instead of the entire cup of white.  Then, I flipped the dumplings back over, and poured the mixture over the dumplings for a final ten minute bake (so that was 30 mins in total).

I had a difficult time getting the dough to wrap around the apples without tearing it. But my husband asked me to keep trying and make it again. I made the sauce a little differently too, but I think the results were the same. Good stuff!

Absolutely delicious!!!  Warning: you need a sweet tooth for this one!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and seasoned the apples with white and brown sugar and cinnamon before stuffing them in the biscuits... I'm not sure this was necessary!  The sauce is amazingly sweet and buttery.  I used half white and half brown sugar and only 1/2 cup water.  I poured the sauce over the biscuits only during the last 10 minutes of cooking.  I will definitely make this again for my parents who love apple pie!

AMAZING!!! I think that this might be my favorite recipe from this website so far. My boyfriend loved them also even though he doesn't care for apple pie. I fallowed the directions from previous ratings and chopped the apples up small, added pumpkin pie spice to the sugar mixture, covered the apples in about 1 cup of the sugar mixture, then cooked the dumplings for 20 min before adding icing (I also added a few apple chunks to the icing) and then cooked for an additional 10 min. absolutely perfect!!

Excellent recipe! Definitely change the sugar amounts (1/2 white, 1/2 brown), use less water, and add the sauce in the last ten minutes (as others have suggested). I would also recommend using less butter (I only used about 1/3 cup), and rolling out the dough to about a disk with a 3" radius. I always get good reviews and i LOVE this recipe!

These are outstanding - I highly recommend these!  I was concerned at the amount of liquid in the pan before putting into the oven, and thought 1c of water was too much but it all worked out fine.  Very tasty!  I would recommend that you peel the apples first - I forgot to and while it wasn't bad, I think the apples would be better peeled! Can't wait to make again!

We followed the changes provided in one of the other reviews and they came out perfect.

Wow, this is good!  Simple indgredients, easy to make, highly recommended.  The only changes I made were I sprinkled the apples with butter, cinnamon and a little nutmeg.  I also cut the apples into smaller pieces than suggested.

I found that using 4 Gala apples was too much.  I had a hard time wrapping the dough around half a diced apple.  I think 2-3 apples would be good.  It was very delicious, btw.  I will make it again.

I've used this recipe for quite some time but with some minor changes.  I cut down on the water.  I also put a dab of butter on the apple and sprinkle with sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg prior to wrapping.  

I good idea for finger food appetizers is to slice the apple into 8 wedges.  Use the can of croisants and roll each apple slice in each of the croisants.  I roll the triangle shaped croisants out just a tad bit and start with my apple on the wide end of the triangle and roll up to the pointy end.  These got rave reviews at my halloween party (we called them witches fingers) and they were easy to eat without utensils.

I make this recipe all the time except I use crescent rolls and I pour Mountain Dew over the dumplings before I bake them.  Sounds weird, but it is delicious.  I have also made them with Diet Mountain Dew and Splenda.

These were awesome with a few simple adjustments: I reduced the amount of water, used half brown sugar and half white sugar, and coated the apples in the sauce before transferring to biscuit dough to ensure the apples would have a lot of flavor. Also, I had some leftovers from dessert last night, and heated them up in the microwave for 45 seconds to make a great breakfast this morning!

These were fantastic.  I did dice the apples and tossed with a bit of brown sugar and cinnamon before I stuffed them into the biscut.  They baked up so good in the sweet cinnamon butter sauce and tasted fantastic with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Thanks for the great recipe I am sure I will make this again.

Easy recipe.  I thought they were a little to sweet & will use less sugar next time.  I used cortland apples. They would be good with vanilla ice cream.  My teenage son thought they were really good.

I loved these! I did change the recipe slightly, I added a little extra cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg because I like them. I also had to use two biscuits to the apple, next time I will cut them in quarters. I also made a simple syrup out of sugar and water and cooked it for a few minutes with the other sauce ingredients, then I poured it on the wrapped apples and baked. My son and I were fighting over them. Very good.

I am very disappointed in this recipe. I thought for 235 reviews this would be EXCELLENT- I was so mistaken. The idea of this recipe is great, but the taste is quite the opposite. The biscuit flavor threw it off, it needed a much different tasting dough. I read all the other reviews and their altercations before I decided to try it. I followed the recipe exactly; like I always do the first time I make things. Then I usually change it accordingly the second time -to our family's liking. The actual ingredients and recipe looked fine and went together well, but it was all in the taste that was off. I hate to say this, for all who rated this so high, but I will not be trying this a second time. I will actually try the other apple dumpling recipe that is on this site, which another reviewer gave good comments on. I wanted to add on that I had 5 adults trying this with me and all agreed.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because it was good, but I made the modifications recommended by others: no water, slice apples and roll them in cinnamon and sugar, use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, turning dumplings in the middle of baking.  I also did not bake these with the sauce, but left the sauce separate to spoon on after baking.

I also used pre-made pie dough - that sounded better to me than biscuit dough.

I served this to guests and one person actually licked their plate.

I must have done something wrong because my dumplings where swimming in sugar water.  The tops browned evenly but the bottoms of the bisquits never cooked so I got left with raw biscuit at the bottom.

Mmmmmmmmmmmm!  So good.  I used Pillsbury crescent rolls, instead of biscuits, because that's what I had on hand.  It was just wonderful.

Yummy.  Family loved these.  Only thing I did different was I used already made pie crusts and wrapped the apples in these.  Had these on hand and not the biscuits the recipe called for.  Turned out wonderful!!!!!

My kids really liked these--they are a great,quick recipe for kids, in my opinion.They just didn't seem like the kind of recipe that I would want to serve to guests.I guess I'm just not big on the "doughy" taste of the dumplings-Sorry :(

This is a wonderful and simple dessert!  The flavors are great together and it's so easy to prepare.  I have made it serveral times for company and they always ask for the recipe.  The sauce is yummy and the dumplings taste great alone and even more yummy served with some vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.  I have always used a quarter of the apple in each biscuit instead of the half.  Enjoy!

Excellent, tasty, and best of all easy dessert. I also cut down on the water, added cinnamon to the apples, and quarter the apples instead of halving.  Had many compliments.  One guest even suggested I should start a chain selling these to compete with the Cinnabun franchises.

This recipe did not live up to my expectations at all.  For the amount of butter and fat that the biscuit dough has in it, I expected a much richer, tastier dessert.  Even following other reviewer's suggestions didn't improve upon it.  
We won't be making this one again.

I thought this dish was excellent.  I am thankful I read the reviews prior to making it.  I diced the apples, and reduced the water.  The entire family loved this.

I thought this was a great recipe, but a little time consuming and I would make it a bit differently next time.  I diced the apples and tossed them with cinnamon and sugar before wrapping them.  I gave the recipe the benefit of the doubt and followed it to the letter for the sauce but wish I had taken the advice of some of the other reviewers and baked them a bit first before I added the sauce. Not so good as a left over.  The biscuit becomes too soft and gooey the next day.

These were great right out of the oven.  Reheating doesn't work very well.  As stated before, the apples need to be very small, or use 1/3 instead of 1/2 apple for each.  I sprinkled the apples with sugar/cinnamon before wrapping.

Easy!  Yummy!  Perfect with vanilla ice cream.  It would be good to use less water.  Still...I didn't and the sauce is excellent with the ice cream.  Thank You Carol!!

The simplicity of this desert belies its great taste. I didn't clean the baking dish right away and all the sugar water caramelized and was a pain to get off. 
Update: Since I made this, news has spread around the family and whenever someone comes for dinner, this is a frequent request. Make sure to use a small apple or the dough is tough to wrap around it. I have to bake mine for 10 extra minutes or the apples aren't cooked completely.(may be my oven though)

Looks much too simple to be good, but if you don't want to fool around with making your own crust, this is the way to go. I ended up making a second batch the next day as the first went so quickly!

These apple dumplings are fabulous.  I added vanilla ice cream, carmel sauce and whipped cream to them.  I used the Pillsbury Crescent rolls.  You can also make the apples ahead, refrigerate them and then microwave them to heat them up when your ready for dessert.  Really yummy recipe!

These are wonderful.  I took the advice of others and cut back on the water and added cinnamon/sugar to the apples before wrapping them.  I also browned them before adding the sauce.  Just delicious...they went in a hurry so make plenty.  I am making them again today actually.  Very good...thank you so much !!!

I loved the basics of this recipe.  After making it the first time, the biscuits were too soggy and 'dough-y' for me.  I substituted the All-Ready piecrusts (I cut them in quarters and rolled them large enough to fit around the apple) for the biscuits.  I also only poured 1/2 of the butter/vanilla sauce over the dumplings and placed the other 1/2 in a corningware dish and baked it alongside the dumplings.  After these minor changes, my whole family was very pleased.  The verdict on the buttery vanilla sauce?  A+ all the way!

This is unbelievable. So easy to make and sooooooooo delicious. My family inhaled them. I also diced my apples, used 1/2 cup of water, and after pouring the butter mix over the dumplings, I sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar. I also turned them over halfway through cooking. I made extra for my neighbors, and they loved it!

WOW! I served these at our RV/camping event and everyone loved them!  I used Gala apples (my produce manager recommended them after looking at the recipe) and the Pillsbury Grands.  I also used less than half the water as recommended.  Dee-lish and easy to make!

These were absolutely wonderful.  I made them the night before and cooked them while we were eating dinner and they were perfect.  Maybe because of the apples I used, I needed to cook for 45mins. so the apples wouldn't be crunchy.  Highly recommend this recipe and top with vanilla ice cream.  Heavenly and easy.  Thank you for this recipe.

I made this recipe for the first time for guests.  It was a hit! Probably the best part of the entire dinnner.  And the best part was that it was SO easy.  The only modification I made, is that I wrapped each biscuit around a quarter of an apple, because I couldn't get it to stretch aroung a half.  I served them warm w/ vanilla icecream.  I will definately make this again.

This dessert reminds me one that my grandma use to make. She went to more work and made the batter herself!!  Next time I think I might buy pizza crust, put cut up apples on it, roll it up and put the "rolls" in the pan and then sprinkle with cinnamon and then put the syrup on top.  It was a real "comfort" dessert.  Thanks for submitting the recipe!!

Hard to believe how quickly this came together not counting the slicing of the apples. Used half brown sugar and half white sugar. 1/4 cup water. baked for 10 mins without the sauce sprinkled. Also had some lime cookies which I crushed and sprinkled over the top after pouring on the sauce. Total baking time 40 mins at 350

Tasted so much like my Granny's tasted.  However, I sliced the apples into smaller parts (I inch cubes) than the recipe called for. Also, since the mixture of butter, water, and spices didn't cover the dumplings, I poured in enough water to do so.  Great recipe!

Not so sure what everybody is doing wrong, but this is a good recipe with the right measurements.  I did however boil the sugar and water to reduce by half, then add the butter and vanilla.  The sauce came out thick and caramelly.  Maybe that is the trick.  I have made this several times and it does not disappoint.

These were a huge hit in my house!  Better than any old apple pie!  So easy to make, yet a dessert to be proud to serve!  I did double the sauce and I diced the apples to put in the dough....my left over diced apples I mixed in with the caramel sauce and poured over the dumplings and baked.  Mixed the apples with cinnamon and sugar.  VERY good!!!  LOVE THIS and will be making it again next weekend!

Absolutely wonderful recipe! My husband whose favorite dessert is peach or apple cobbler has declared this as its replacement. I have made these almost every weekend since we found this recipe. I too followed the recommendation of other reviewers: reduced water to 1/4 cup, cut apples in wedges before wrapping with dough and covered with cinnamon/sugar mixture. I used 1/2 jazz apples and 1/2 granny smith and found that while the flavor was the same with both the jazz apples maintained their shape better and the granny smith cooked down to almost nothing, but both were fabulous! Also I made 1/2 with crescent dough and 1/2 with ready made crusts and hands down everyone thought the ones with the crescent dough were better. I also added nutmeg before pouring on the sauce. The last time I made them I didn't bother peeling the apples and it didn't seem to make any difference. Do yourself a favor and make this dish...next time will try reducing the butter because I don't think it will affect the flavor that much.

Mmm, this is now one of my favorite desserts!! I took the advice of other reviewers and waited for the dumplings to cook for a few minutes before pouring the sauce in a little at a time.  And, I put cinnamon sugar on diced apples. I used Pillsbury Honey Butter biscuit dough instead of the regular, which made it even more scrumptious! Will definitely be using this recipe again and again.

My family LOVES this recipe and my niece (now six) says that when she grows up she's going to be a doctor and make apple dumplings.  It even rewarms nicely in the oven.  My father shared the recipe with a coworker, who substituted orange juice for the water and it came out wonderfully.  Tonight when i make it, i'll be sprinkling a little cinnamon and sugar on top of the apples before i wrap them in the biscuit.

Thank you Carol for an excellent and very easy recipe.  Husband is a diabetic so I used all Splenda instead of sugar and the result was so very good.  Served to company this afternoon and everyone loved them!!

As previously mentioned, this recipe is perfect! I impressed the pickiest of eaters - yay! :)  I made a few modifications based on previous reviews and they worked amazingly. They were: I used crescent dough; 1/2 cup each of white and brown sugar; and I put cinnamon over the sliced apples before wrapping.  5 stars for ease in preparation and 5 stars in taste!

My family eats these dumplings until they're gone.  I usually don't even get any before they're gone.  As soon as Fall starts this is one of the first comfort goods I make.  Thanks for the recipe!

Seriously...incredible! I did modify some things but the basics are there. Sprinkled splenda and cinnamon on apples before wrapping them, cut back on water, flipped them 1/2 way through cooking and they were incredible. Used splenda and it tasted perfect! Great recipe for the kids to help you make them. My 3 year old loved it!

I'm always worried that the apples won't be done when the dumplings are brown so I par-boil them first.  I've been making this recipe since it was posted years ago and I love it.  It's easy but looks fancy.

Its funny I found this recipe by mistake!! I had apples and buttermilk biscuits I had to use. I did a search and found this. This is what I did. Peeled and cored apples Put in biscuit, Put some brown sugar on them, Closed them up. Put in oven on 350 for 20 mins. While they were cooking I did the sauce on the stovetop. I used a cup of brownsugar 1/4 cup of water, 3 tablespoons honey. Let it sit for a couple mins. Flipped Dumpling and put sauce on them. Cooked for another 10 mins. I didnt have all the ingredients But I loved the way it turned out Soooo Im not changing it Sorry lol! You also only need 2 medium size apples. This is my first dessert from this site. A def winner. Thanks so much its delicious!!

I'm not the biggest fan of desserts. So when I was asked to make one, I decided on this recipe since any dessert served with ice cream is the dessert for me. After trying this, I have to say that I'm hooked. This is without a doubt the easiest, most delicious dessert I have ever made.

Easy to make and really really gooood!!!!!  Instead of using the sauce, I just brush the top with melted butter and sprinkle some brown sugar with cinnamon.  Once done, I just served it with vanilla ice cream and oh la la, it's very yummy in your tummy!

This was an awesome dessert. Even my picky 6-yr old who doesn't like pie gobbled it up. I also did half brown and half white sugar method, as well as diced the apples and added sugar and cinnamon to them. I used too many apples so the extra was placed in the dish around the dumplings. I also followed the tip regarding the water and used only 1/4 cup. Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe exactly and I think it came out perfect as is. I don't see the need to change it up at all. I didn't dice the apples as some suggested but just halved them as the recipe says and my apples came out nice and soft and perfectly ccoked. The dough outside came out nice and brown on the outside and fluffy in the middle. This was so quick and easy to make and everyone loved them. I will for sure make it again.

I dont eat apples, but my husband and son really loves anything with apples.  So I made this for them.  Well, they truly loved it...they raved about it and have since asked me to make it several times.  I did follow the suggestions of others and diced the apples then dipped them in a sugar, cinnamon mixture then wrapped them in dough the with a pat of butter.  I also used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and I heat the sauce over medium heat until bubbly (but do not boil)..Hubby said its the best apple dumpling he has ever had.  Thank you for the recipe and suggestions.

Good, pretty sweet. I diced apples as others suggested, actually made it harder to wrap in the biscuit than the 1/2 apple that I wrapped. Make sure that the dough is cooked through.

The sauce is what makes these so special.  I sprinkled the chopped apples with cinnamon and nutmeg but not sugar.  The apples I had were sweet enough.  Follow the reviewer's suggestions for baking and they won't turn out doughy.  I also rolled my biscuit with a glass to make them big and thin.

These taste great, especially for the little amount of effort they take. I dipped the apples in the sauce before rolling them in the dough, plus poured it over top afterwards.

These were ok.  A little less flavor than I would have liked and I did preseason the apple slices with brown sugar and cinnamon, used maybe 2 TBSP water.  I baked for 15 minutes without sauce, flipped for 10 more, then added sauce for last 10 minutes cook time.

OH MY GOODNESS, THESE ARE SO GOOD!  I have never made apple dumplings before, and I wanted to prepare a special dessert for my boyfriend (who loved them as well.)  These were absolutely delicious!  The biscuit dough soaked up the sauce without getting soggy.  I did make the recommended changes; I used half brown sugar and half white, as well as cut the water down... I just added it until it was my desired consistency. I baked them for 15 minutes on one side, then 15 on the other.  I added the sauce during the last 10 or so minutes of baking.  I will be making these again and again and again... my favorite recipe so far from this site!

Very yummy! I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, as was suggested by other reviewers. I also used Phyllo dough instead of biscuits,with gala apples tossed in cinnamon sugar,cooked the sauce on the stove and added it the last 10 minutes of cooking time. It made a great late Sunday morning breakfast with a little whipped cream and hot coffee..

My boyfriend and I thought these were awesome! They tasted really good. They were very easy to make and I much prefer the biscuit wrapped around the apple rather than using a pie crust.

I would give this 10 stars if I could!!  I followed others reviewers advice--diced the apples and sprinkled w/cinnamon and sugar before baking.  Baked for about 15 min, then poured the sauce over (I did reduce the water by just over 1/2 c.) and baked another 20.  This was increcible!!!!!  I cant wait to make again!

Absolutely delicious.  I cut the apples into smaller pieces and spooned some of the sugar/butter mixture on them before wrapping them up.  I also used half brown sugar and half white...this was great!  Will make again.

I, like another reviewer, made with the French Pastry Pie Crust on this site - so good.  These end up tasting similar to apple Cinnabons.

Wonderful recipe!  I too modified the recipe to 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar and cut down on the water by half.  My whole family loved them. Thank you!  :o)

A very easy dessert to make.  We found the sauce a little too sweet for our tastes, but I will try again and either cut the sugar or perhaps leave the sauce out entirely.  They sure smell good when in the oven, my husband was hanging around in the kitchen just waiting to try them!

Very good flavor. I used pie crust instead of biscuits, half orange juice and half water.  I also rolled the apple piece in suger cinnamon.  Next time I will use less butter.  I also cooked the dumplings without sauce for 10-15 minutes on each side.  I did not find this to be watery at all.  Will certainly make it again.

Nice, rustic and simple dessert.  I followed others advice and combined sugars (1/2c ea)& added nutmeg.  Baked dry 10 min., flipped, baked 10 more, then added sauce (bake 15 min).  Overall, very good, but the sauce turned what I assumed would be crispy kind of mushy.  Will try again doing sauce on stovetop and pour over or serve with at end.

I LOVE this recipe and have used it over and over.  I only use 1 granny apple and use an apple corer to cut into 8 pieces...so each apple slice is used for 1 biscuit.  Modifications:  I also use 1/2 cup orange juice (gives it a kick), 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar...and NO butter.   Once I made this recipe and forgot to use the butter and it was fine!  Since then, I haven't used butter, because it still tastes!!!!

I wanted to capture the taste of individual apple pies with these so I substitued frozen pie shells for the dough.  I let the shells thaw in the fridge overnight so they were ready to go the next day.  At first I was concerned with making everything pretty.  Half way through I realized if I put the apple on the section of pie shell, drizzled some sauce on and folded the top over, I could more or less gently mash the shell together around the apple quarter.  The last half looked/tasted just as good and took much less than half the time.  These had all of the flavor of a good apple pie with less work.  Vanilla ice cream optional!

This was incredible! I'm very sorry that I didn't take a picture because it looked soooo good. My entire family loved it. I did make a few changes though: 1/2 brown and 1/2 white, I halved the apples and used two biscuits to cover them, dipped the apples in sauce before wrapping them (which made the doughy a bit hard to work with, but it was okay), and baked the dumplings for 10 minutes before adding the sauce. I used Pillsbury Honey Butter Biscuit Dough, and I thought it worked really well with the apples; I don't know why others complained. With those corrections, this recipe is definitely worth ten stars!!

I didn't like this but I can't blame the recipe as I read the reviews and made the following changes. I used pie crust instead of biscuits. I diced up the apples and coated them in a sugar cinnamon mixture. I used 1/2c white sugar and 1/2c brown sugar no water just a little bit of orange juice to get it to the right consistancy. I baked it for 20 minutes then I turned them and baked them for an additional 10 minutes before putting on the glaze. Then I baked them for 10 more minutes this was way too sweet and I love sweets. Perhaps if I would have followed the directions it may have came out better.

I did not particularly like the inside of the dumpling. The apple seemed like it should have had some glaze or sauce inside of it.

I just made these dumplings for our office Thanksgiving Luncheon.  Everyone loved them!  The recipe was so easy that I made two pans before work this morning so they would still be a little warm.  I used a 13x9" pan since I didn't have an 11x7, still perfect.  Everyone wants the recipe!

I made these and my family loved them especially with vanilla ice cream.  I used the suggestion of rolling the apples in sugar and cinnamon.  I bought the 12 oz bisquit by mistake so I had to quarter the apples instead.  Still great!

Extremely easy and delicious! My boyfriend said it was "the best desert he'd ever had."  I didnt have a 7x11 baking pan, so I used a smaller round dish which just fit all the dumplings.  I thought this might be a problem, but as it turned out the sauce covered more of the dumplings and the yummy mixture saturated them.  Everyone said the bottom (the part sitting in the sauce) was the best.  I will certainly make this again, and I will use the small dish as well.

I made this for guests and they loved it!  easy to make and i did use the biscuit dough and it turned out well.  only change that i made was that i dipped the apples in the sauce before wrapping in dough and i followed the suggestions to pour the first half of the sauce halfway through the baking and the rest at the end.  will definitely do again!

Awesome, easy and inexpensive recipe.  My hushand took extras to work with him and they all said it was to die for!  Great served hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream to tone down the sweetness.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. The biscuit just wasn't the right flavor for a dumpling, and with so much sauce to cook in, they became soggy. I wont be making this again.

This was a pretty tasty recipe. My husband and I both enjoyed it, however, I followed the advice of other reviewers and tweaked it a little (ie. half brown sugar/white sugar, orange juice instead of water, more vanilla, slice apples and roll in cinnamon and sugar, ect). I don't think it would have turned out as well had I used it just as it was. Also, I made my own dumpling dough which worked out great. The reason I gave it four stars is because it required so much change...but otherwise, it was very tasty and rich. Thanks to the submitter and to those who added some great hints to improving on this.

My husband is desert crazy so I try to use a lot of desert recipes that require fruit. I have to slip in his diet somehow! He was really impressed with these Apple Dumplings and they're a nice alternative to Apple Crisp or Turnovers for a lazy winter evening!

I liked this but I rolled the dough thin to put around the apples. I did every thing right but I didn't like the way the dough turned out.
I think I would like a yeast bread better.

This was delicious! My boyfriend and I made them together since I love dumplings and I had some apples around, not really knowing what we were in for. Now we are making them for his parents. You really can't eat just one. They are delicious! Thank you, Carol, for sharing this with us.

Delaware has a huge Apple-Scrapple Festival annually and these kick Apple-Scrapple butt.  Nobody in this De. raised house knew it was biscuit dough-I told them later. Anyway, I reduced water and diced apples.  Had rolled out dough w/ rolling pin. (lightly used flour to keep from sticking.)Had to strategically place diced apple in dough to make it coverable. Easy, great, pretty quick.  Plate lickin' good

I made this last night & everyone loved it.  I used the large size biscuits, but used 1 1/2 biscuits each.  I sliced the apples & like other reviewers, I added cinnamon & sugar with the apples.  I didn't bake with the sauce, but used my own cinnamon sauce because I was afraid they would get soggy.  I baked ahead, but would be better baker closeer to serving.  I didn't have ice cream, but everyone agreed that would be a great addition.  I will definitely make this again--excellent!!!  By the way, I love this site, it has great recipes & the reviews help tremendously!!  Thanks!!!

These were very good. I used cinnamon rolls, and they were really good. I would have liked a bit more crust. Maybe next time I will use two rolls instead of one. Or maybe my apple slices were too big. So quick and easy to do too.

These are truly awesome.  You would think they would be soggy, but I turned them over halfway through cooking as recommended and they were perfectly browned.  I loved the way the biscuits absorbed the sauce!

I made these today and they were delicious. I used Pillsbury flakey biscuits/honey butter flavored and I reduced the water to 1/2cup and they turned out with a nice syrupy sauce. I put them in the oven when I served dinner and they were ready by the time we had finished and still nice and warm to be served with vanilla ice cream.
A genuine comfort food.

Absolutely delicious!  Don't let the kids play with the dough too long, but they can wrap the apples!

Yummy!  Couldn't believe how good this was.  I used Pillsbury Crescent rolls, turned halfway through and then added the sauce.  Also, used less water.  Had a hard time with the dough when it got soft so would suggest making sure it is very cold when you make this.

I made this last night. I used a rolling pin to flatten the dough. I also used only 1/2 cup of water and it made plenty of sauce. It is one of the best desserts I have ever made. If you don't try this one, you don't know what you are missing!

I adapted this recipe into a sugar-free recipe by cutting back the water to a half-cup, then substituting a half cup of honey and two tablespoons of brown rice syrup (so it's not too sweet) instead of using the white sugar. They turned out great, though I think that adding cinnamon to the apples would have made them even better. Excellent recipe!

I sprinkled the apples with ground cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves just befor wrapping the dough around them.  I also turned them after 10 minutes, they were very flakey. I rated 5 stars in all catagories !!

I loved how much easier this was to make than regular apple dumplings, and might still make it again in a pinch, but didn't particularly like the flavor of the rolls I used.  I'm thinking cinnamon rolls might be good.

I was a little doubtful of the refridgerated biscuts working well, but I was really pleased!  In fact, this is a favorite among my friends.  I just reduced the water by half and followed the rest of the directions and it worked wonderfully!  Will definitely make again and again...

This was a very big hit at my house. I followed some of the others tips by using 1/2 c of water and flipping midway. I also cut my apples into 3rds and sprinkled them with cinnamon and sugar.

Hats off to this chef! EXCELLENT recipe. I used golden delicious apples, doubled the sauce, & sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before cooking. I also served it with fresh whipped cream and brown sugar on top. Yummy!

WOW!  What a hit.  These are great.  I followed the suggestion of other raters using 1/2 cup water, cutting the apples into quarters and thirds, and flipping the dumplings half-way through the cooking.  The were WONDERFUL!  Thank you.

I have made this recipe three times now.  My family loves them.  I did make some modification, I dices my apples up and added a little sugar and cinnamon to them. I also brown my dumplings in the the oven until they are slightly golden, then add the sauce (I don't added the water, but do add the juice from the bowl of apples and any pieces of apple left over). I made this for a community BBQ and was swamped for the recipes.  Thanks for such a GREAT recipe.

Whole family enjoyed these - first batch of 10 were gone the first night just between husband (mostly) and daughter.  I too used half the water and I think it was more than enough - any more and it would be too thin of a sauce for my taste.  All in all - an awesome quick recipe for dessert in a hurry (be sure to top them with good vanilla ice cream - YUM!).

I was only able to get 1/4 of the apple "wrapped" in the biscuit.  I baked my dumplings and even turned them over once till the outside started to "set" before I added the sauce.  I added about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon into the sauce and cut up remaining apple into small chunks into the sauce.  These are EXCELLENT and EASY and I will make them over and over!  They are a definite hit!

10 dumpling with a 12 oz. can of biscuits and you
need 5 apples.

Fantastic.  I used pillsbury cinnamon cinnabon rolls in place of plain dough and used apples that were getting a little soft.  Did not have any leftovers and they were the perfect serving size.

My family thought this was worth 25 stars, not just 5!  It is truly delicious.   It's easy to make and your guests will never suspect that you used refrigerated biscuit dough. I 
Made the recipe as written. The bottom soaks in the vanilla butter sauce and is delicious.  This is new family favorite!

Absolutely Amazing! I made sure the water, sugar and butter combination was real hot before pouring on dumplings!  I nuked water for 2 mins, stirred in sugar and butter and nuked another 2 minutes, added vanilla and poured it on! No mushiness whatsoever! Perfect!

This was super easy! I did not have any vanilla so I used cinnamon and apple cider in place of water then added sprinkles of brown sugar after I put the sugar apple cider mixture on.  Used butter flavored Pillsbury grands Southern style biscuits and Granny Smith apples.  I LOVE this, not sure if the kids or husband do but it was easy and delicious

These were ah-mazing!!! I followed other reviewers suggestions and used half brown sugar ans only a few tablespoons of water for the sauce. Cubed up the apple and mixed it with sugar and cinnamon (really a must for any baked apple recipe).  BAKED seam down for 20 minutes then flipped, after another 10 minutes added the sauce and then cooked for the last 10 minutes. Also, I used the phillsberry apple turnover dough and because they are cut as squares and I tried to reshape them,  they got incredibly thin. This was the best serendipitous event: as they tore at the bottom of the pan the glaze hardened over them. Once they were cooked you got a nice semi-transparent sauce with little sneak peak of the apple chunks. Everyone raved about them and said they loved the taste of the dough. All in all, a great recipe with some minor mods.

I made a sugar free version using 1/4 cup Splenda white sugar and 1/4 cup Splenda brown sugar.
We used the apple corer that splits the apple into 5 sections, we then cut those sections in half to make the slices narrower. I sprinkled the inside of the biscuits with cinnamon before closing them up. We had some slices left over, so I lined them up around the edges. Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews before pouring the liquid over the top, so our biscuits were a little soggy on the bottom.  It apparently didn't bother my son because he ate three.
I served them with the No Sugar Added Breyer's Ice Cream - Salted Caramel Swirl. Yummy!

I've always wanted to try apple dumplings and so glad I finally did!  This recipe is, OH SO DELICIOUS!  Your taste buds will thank you!   I used Apple Crisps instead of Granny Smith and I added brown sugar, as well as, white sugar.  Thank you, Carol, for sharing this family gem.

This came out great for us! After perusing the comments, here are the changes I made: I diced the apples and tossed them with cinnamon sugar, halved the water, used half light brown sugar and half white, and saved half of the sugar mixture and added halfway through cooking. I also cut up too many apples, so I mixed them in with the sugar mixture (all of the apples got scooped in at the beginning, only sugar mixture went in halfway through). I used Grands flaky biscuits, and they came out soft inside and on the bottom with a nice sugary crust on top. I served with vanilla ice cream, and they were delicious! The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that I made so many changes that I'm not even sure what the original recipe would taste like. It was a great basic starting place, though.

I kept all ingredients the same as instructed, except I sliced the apples as thin as I typically do for an apple pie. I read about reducing the water, and I'm glad I didn't! We made these last night and had leftovers for breakfast this morning, and I drizzled the "juices" over all the dumplings before microwaving! It was perfect! Simple and easy, I'll make this again and again.

When I started making this recipe everyone in my house went crazy over it.  I paid for a phone line being installed by one of my friends.  He wouldn't get out the car til he smelled them cooking.  The best part is fighting over the corner instead of making them in a round dish.  I serve them freash out the oven topped with ice cream.

Compared to the complete homemade from scratch ones I have made in the past these are ok in a pinch but I thought just ok.They do get a little soggy on the bottom.

I didn't even have to flip these and they tasted amazing, not soggy at all. Best apple dish that I have ever had. Do make sure that the apples are cut into smaller chunks and toss them with cinnamon and sugar.

This is the best apple dumpling that I have ever tasted.  My whole family loves them and I have made them so many times that I do not need to see the recipe at all. I do go along with other reviewers on the water, I only use 1/2 cup of water which makes a lovely syrup.

I just do not understand how people can completely change the recipe and then give it 5 stars.  Unless you make it as is, I don't think you should rate the recipe.  I have made this recipe many times AS IS and we love it every time!  It is perfectly sweet and the apples are yummy wrapped in biscuit dough.

I followed this recipe as directed without the advice of reviews... didn't turn out so well. Things shouldn't be so highly rated if they need major adjustments. They are SUPER sweet, the recipe tells you to use too many apples, and they turn out soggy if you add the sauce at the beginning.  Probably would have been better with some adjustments.

This is the first recipe I've tried from your website (or any website) and these were delish!  I read the reviews and changed the 'sauce' according to one of the reviews.  I made 12 of these for Thanksgiving and none were left.

These are great!  I only use about 2 apples.  I bake 10 mins on the first side, then flip and bake another 10 mins, then flip back to original side and THEN pour sauce over dumplings.  That way they bake up crispy!

I modified this recipe because there is no way it needs the amount of sugar called for. I think 1/2 cup of sugar would be more than enough added to water - mix to your desired consistency. Another change I made was to eliminate the butter all together and they were still great.  I had chopped apples with cinnamon and sugar on them to put inside of the biscuit pockets and they made great little turnovers for breakfast. I will probably make these again.

Easy recipe and they tasted great.  I had some extra Puff Pastry dough lying around that was about to expire so we used it instead of the biscuits.  They turned out great and it was a fantastic way to spend the afternoon with my teenagers.  I can't wait to bake these again.

These were superb!!!!!!.  I did take some suggestions from others but overall an excellent recipe.  The sauce was delicious.  My entire family including my neighbors loved it.  I have a ton of apples left from apple picking, so I intend to make this again and again this week.

I should have read more reviews before I made these.  Although they were very good, the bottoms were soggy (which is why I gave it 4 stars).  Next time, I will flip them half way through baking or wait to add the sauce until part way through baking.  The sauce was a bit too sweet.  Next time, I will use less sugar.

These were good. I thought I would save time by using apple pie filling, but it was so slippery that the apple slices slid out the edges of the folds. I has so much trouble folding them in half that I ended up just topping the biscuits with the apples. Not exactly the recipe but good none the less.

These are the best.  My family is always asking for them and they can smell them in the oven when they walk in and get all excited.  Very easy and so so delicious.

Made as written, with the exception of dicing the apples... perhaps I did something wrong, but was not impressed.

WHAT A GREAT RECIPE!  So easy, quick and delicious!  I used reduced fat crescent rolls, and replaced the white sugar with brown sugar.  I also took others' advice and cut the apples into large chunks and tossed them with sugar and cinnamon before baking.  I also cut the water to a 1/2 cup.  I had a few pieces of apple left over that didn't fit in the dough, so I just threw them into the pan and baked with everything else.  Delicious!

holy !  this is by far the best non-chocolate dessert i've ever had.  it's definitely the best dessert i've ever made.  i followed the other suggestions and i also made my own pastry crust.   the sauce turned into pure carmel.  i cooked it on the stove separate and added it the last 10 minutes of baking.  like the other reviewers i diced the apples, cooked the sauce separate with brown & white sugar and reduced the water.  to die for!

Great recipe! I've made these several times to rave reviews. However, I do recommend reading the reviews and making a few moderations. I had extra filling, but kept it aside to pour over the dumplings in the final baking stage-delicious!

These are very very good. Even my husband, who is very skimpy with the compliments, loved this. He even suggested I make it for his parents who are visiting this coming weekend! Wow! I did quarter the apples and used smaller bisquits.  These are wonderful.

This is good for a quick version of apple dumplings but it isn't the same as the more labor intensive version my grandma used to make. Still very lip smacking!

My mom definitely has a sweet tooth and she just went crazy for these.  I made the changes suggested and cut the water down to just a few tablespoons.  I find that cutting the apples before stuffing the biscuit dough is really helpful, and a little allspice never hurt anything.

A tad too doughy, but still very tasty. I sliced the apples and coatedthem with the cinnamon sugar before rolling them in the dough. Next time I will put 2-3 slices in each piece of dough before rolling up. Also, I used two cans (7.5 oz) of the smaller buttermilk biscuits so I had more than just 8 biscuits. All in all... yum!

I have to admit, I only tried these because of the reviews.  WOW!!!  Put a scoop of caramel or vanilla ice cream on these and you've got yourself one elegant and delicious dessert.  We had the leftovers for breakfast!  Well, they have biscuits in them.  LOL  Seriously, one of the best recipes I've tried in a long time.  When pears are in season, I plan to try them in this one.

OMG, these are amazing!! I cut an apple into 8 slices and used 2 slices per dumpling. Next time I want to try adding 3 slices. I halved the butter and will decrease it even more next time. I used reduced fat crescent rolls and followed the advice about 1/2 brown sugar and a small amt of water. They came out so good. I will definitely be making these again and again!!

I used less than 2 diced large Golden Delicious apples. Like other reviewers, I lightly sprinkled the inside of the dumplings with cinnamon and sugar. I flipped the dumplings halfway through, and poured the sauce over the top during the last 10 minutes. (I used 2 8x8 glass dishes since I did not have the size called for.) I left the water at a cup, and added a couple tablespoons of orange juice concentrate. If I make these again, I will cut the sugar in the sauce by half, since it was way too sweet (and I have a sweet tooth). Other than that, the recipe is tasty. You can change the spices to whatever suits you (I added ginger to the sauce). If you don't get the biscuits wet, they are very easy to manipulate and seal. For flakier pastry, don't overwork the biscuit dough.

i loved the recipe - but again - only with the correct alterations.  I would say to bake the apples completely and warm the sauce in a saucepan.....top as serve because mine were VERY soggy by the end.

Awesome recipe!  I used pastry puff sheets instead of buscuit dough and it was fabulous.  I also warmed the sauce separately in a sauce panand served it over the dumplings fresh out of the oven. Yum!!

I did take the advice of others and used half brown sugar and half white sugar I also added a splash of orange juice.I cut the apples in quarters and placed 3 or 4 apple slices in each bisuit sprinkled with cinnamon and pinched the top closed and baked for 30 min.My family couldn't eat them fast enough !!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and thought this was just OK (thought liquid part was too watery), but my husband liked it, thus the 4 starts.  It was easy to make.  I may try again with suggestions from previous reviews.

I can't rate this exact recipe because I followed the changes recommended by some others. I can say that by doing so they turned out absolutely delicious. I used pie crust instead of biscuit dough, half white sugar and half brown sugar and orange juice instead of water. I also dipped the apples in the sauce before wrapping them. The friends I shared them with loved them.

Ohmyohmyohmy!!! Simply delicious! What a wonderful & truly simple recipe. Every week my brother & sister & their spouses come to my house & we have "soup day". Since I love to cook,especially soup,I make a homemade soup, homemade bread & a dessert. This was the dessert this week & all you could hear was "MMMMM!" Everyone just loved it, including myself. Served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream..mmmm! Thanks Carol for a "keeper" recipe.

I certainly was skeptical of such a simple recipe, but after following the original recipe (without any variations) I had a great "comfort food" dessert! Not a gourmet dessert, but as yummy as can be with such ease.

This is one of my favorite fast-as-lightening desserts.  I even use it for entertaining.  The suggestions given are ones that I developed too, but I use nutmeg.  It's been a staple for YEARS now.  Friends are disappointed if I DON'T make it.

Very Good!  I took the advise of others and rolled the apples in sugar and cinnamon before placing them in the biscuit and they turned out very well.  I thought they were a little sweet and I didn't even put all the sauce on them, but everyone else loved them.  I also poured the sauce on for the last 10 min of baking.

Really good flavor. I serve it with powdered sugar on top. Ice cream would be good too. The only setback is that the dough expands to fit the size of the pan, so make sure you keep it confined.

Delicious!  Do yourself a favor and DO NOT substitute margarine for the butter called for in the sauce.  My canned bisquits made 10 biscuits, so I made 10 dumplings.

I can't believe this dessert was made with canned biscuet dough. I was so impressed with the way it turned out. I did use the plain old buttermilk biscuets from ALDIS, costing 29 cents. And as another reader suggested, I quartered the apples. I also seasoned the apples with a little salt and cinnamon, and then I microwaved them for three minutes just to soften them a little before I wrapped them. I followed the recipe for the sauce exactly as it was written, using the really good Mexican vanilla that is my favorite. It came out of the oven a beautiful golden brown, and smelled like heaven. I cant wait to make this recipe again, I want to try it with maybe 1/4 cup of brown sugar and the rest white. Thank you for this quick and tastey recipe.

I followed the ingredients for this recipe as it said, except I used small buttermilk biscuits and I used quartered apples. I only poured a small amount of the sauce on then at the end when they were almost done I poured the rest on. Everybody in my family of 8 loved them

This is an AWESOME dessert!  I served it for the first time to my family and dinner guests and made a double batch!  They ate all of this very filling dessert.  I added more cinnamon and used the refridg. jumbo butter flake generic brand biscuits and rolled them out, and then wrapped the apples in them.

I wanted to find a recipe to make with my kids and their friend for a playdate, and thought this looked simple and easy.  I substituted crescent roll dough for the biscuits, and used a little less water.  It was really easy to make, and the kids thought it was great, but it was a bit doughy on the bottom and most of the flavor was on the outside. Next time I would toss the apples in the sauce with a little cinnamon before wrapping, follow another reviewers suggestion and cook for 10 minutes before pouring the sauce over to make it less doughy, and sprinkle some pecans on top.  Quick, easy and "yummy" recipe.

we had gone apple picking and my husband was convinced that we were once again going to have rotten apples in the fruit basket-and then I found your recipe-truth be told, I molded breadstick dough around the apple halves, as it was all I had in the fridge and it came out fantastic-plan on making for dessert for Thanksgiving-no rotten apples this year-thanks so much for sharing!!

This recipe was very good only with the modifications that everyone else suggested (i.e. 1/2 sugar 1/2 brown sugar, substituting oj for the water, adding more vanilla, doubling the sauce, baking x 10 min before adding sauce.  It becomes a whole new recipe.  Next time, I would use premade pie crust instead of biscuits and bake dumplings w/o sauce on them and cook sauce seperately to add on after dumplings are baked.  With all of the mods this was very, very good.  We made them for company and got a lot of compliments.

I've made this twice - once with refrigerated cinnamon roll dough, and once with biscuit dough - both ways are excellent.  Also great with fresh peaches!

My parents loved this recipe.  I made this with pears.  The pastries came out in odd shapes but I guess that is what it sopposed 2 be like.  I personally ADORED them! They taste bast right out of the oven.  BY the way, this is very very sticky so to save clean up time use disposible cooking utensils....

This recipe as written is just OK.  I sprinkled the apples with cinnamon sugar and wrapped them in crescent roll dough.  I used brown sugar and added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the liquid before pouring on top, and then sprinkled with a cinnamon sugar mixture.

I am giving this recipe four stars because of the fact that my roommate - who does not even like apple dumplings - liked them.  I LOVE apple dumplings and I did not really care for these.  They just kind of reminded me of an apple biscuit.  I followed other reviewers tips and reduced the water by 1/2, but I think that I would reduce it to 1/4 cup if my roommate ever wants them again.  If you want to try something different that tastes pretty good try these . . . but if you're looking for a real apple dumpling I would try another recipe instead!

I don't know what the people were thinking that didn't give this recipe a great review.  I am thoroughly impressed!!  We just had this and I have 8 teenage girls who raved about it.  And it couldn't have been any easier to make.  I almost feel bad taking the compliments for it.

Mediocre, at best. I'd think for 170-some reviews, this would be out of this world.  Recipie needs a lot of altering.  I won't try this again.

I don't know what it is about this recipe that has everyone raving about it.  It didn't seem impressive to start with.  I chose it because I needed something quick and easy. I made them for my mom, she made them for a friend, then they told two friends and THEY told two friends and so on and so on.... and now everyone is asking for this recipe!  I still don't get it, but it's an obvious success!  We cut way down on the water because the first batch came out rather soupy. Enjoy!

Really good.   I added cinnamon and sugar to the inside of the biscuit.   I also sliced my apples so I could wrap them in the dough.  We all liked them and I will make these again and probably often.

This is so yummy!  I chopped the apples up though and added some sugar and cinammon to them.  Watch so you don't overcook because the bottom can get hard.  Don't forget the vanilla ice cream!

my whole family enjoyed these. What a time saver when you have 8 kids! of course I had to triple the recipe. They were asking when I would make them again before they finished the one in their bowls. I served them with vanilla ice cream. YUMMY!!!!

These were okay, but we didn't care much for the biscuit dough.  I really liked the sauce though.  I don't think I will make them again, however.  Thanks.

We made these on New Years Eve, and again the next day when company was over.  They came out much better the next day, the first time there was too little apple and more biscuit.  I'm wondering if maybe you chop the apple up, it might be a little easier to eat.  My mother LOVED them both times tho!! :o)  Thanks!

I used the larger-sized biscuits and halved the amount of water in the sauce and it turned out well.  My family really enjoyed these with ice cream.  They were delicious!  Thanks!

My family really loved these apple dumplings.  I did find it difficult to wrap the apple halves--so the second time I made them, I used a jumbo sized flaky bisquit, and I turned them once during baking.  They really soaked up the sauce and tasted delicious.

I think I am addicted to these and I have only just tried them!  Delicious, rich and tasty treats.  We didn't eat them with ice cream or whipped cream, but I imagine it would be heaven.  They were very easy and will certainly become a regular around our kitchen (must go to gym to compensate)

Delicious.  I followed the directions, but did use more cinnamon.  It came out great.  I did read the reviews first about it being watering.  But I just put each dumpling on a desert plate and drizzled the extra sauce over each one and it was GREAT!

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  I've made some for a potluck at work and had great compliments such as "it's cooked to perfection."  The taste is absolutely flawless and I didn't use too much of the sause.  I brushed it on the dumplings during baking to give it that golden sweet taste.

Thought this recipe was wonderful.  I substituted half the sugar with brown sugar and threw in a lot more cinnamon.  I would double the sauce recipe next time because it is great over the vanilla ice cream I topped the dumplings with.   I made these hours before I wanted dessert, refrigerated uncooked, and baked when ready.

I took others' advice and omitted the water.  They were hard to make, and the apples aren't specified so I used the red ones I had.  Overall, it wasn't what I was expecting.  Dumplings I have had in the past were crisp-crusted, these were a little gooey and not worth all of the effort.

Great sweet treat!  I didn't have the 'Grands' biscuits, so I used regular buttermilk ones instead.  There weren't enough biscuits to go around 8 apple halves, I had enough biscuit for 4 halves.  Worked out great though, I put the butter/vanilla/sugar sauce over the dumplings in a 8x8 glass dish and baked for 27 minutes.  YUM!!!

I made these last night as a surprise dessert.  The kids loved them!  I couldn't
get the entire half of the apple wrapped in one biscuit (I used Pillsbury Flaky
Biscuits) so I put one biscuit on the bottom and one on the top.  It worked 
great.  I think next time I might use smaller pieces of apple and one biscuit
like others have mentioned, but I will definitely do this recipe again.  It was so
quick!

I hate to say anything bad about this recipe, I love to cook,and since everyone else thought this recipe was awesome, the only thing I can say is it wont turn out like you think it will. Make some modifications, like omitting the water or using big biscuits or cutting the apple in half again.  It was basically easy though

Easy and tastes great!!  I was short of white sugar, so used half white/half brown and it had a real butterscotch flavour.  Everyone enjoyed it and I will make it again (often).

I tried this recipe out on dinner guests and it was a big hit - I wasn't too fond of the 'douginess' but my guests like that the best!  Certainly quick and easy if you like this type of desert.
