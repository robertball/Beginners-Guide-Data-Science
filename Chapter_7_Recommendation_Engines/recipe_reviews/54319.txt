The quantities are completely wrong in this recipe.  It needs either much less mango or more yogurt.  Other recipes I found have about a 1-to-1 ratio of these ingredients.

OK come on, who doesn’t love Mango Lassies?  I do have to admit to being a mango fanatic though.  I made the recipe as posted and without blending the ice with it, as that is how I first ever had one.  Without the ice blended into it is better, but either way it’s good to me.  If you’re going to use fresh mango, make sure it is almost, if not, over ripe, it is true they can be fibrous if they haven’t come to complete ripeness.  Canned mango works well and is more convenient since you can keep it in the refrigerator, chilled for whenever the urge hits you!

I used Kesar Mango pulp, according to advice given to me from the owner at a local Indian store.  This recipe and that ingredient made an excellent mango lassi.  Our guests for the meal said they were like the ones at a restaurant!

Yummy!  I used Trader Joe's mango sauce in place of the pulp, and it gave a great mango flavor.  The yogurt cuts the sweetness, and you can make it thinner like the restaurant lassis by adding more milk, or thicker like a shake by adding more ice, whatever is to your taste.  A delicious, healthy drink.  Highly recommended

Yes, don't make the mistake of using the magno itself. I think it's the acid in the mango juice that ruins the recipe. You have to use the mango pulp. I used to deliver for an Indian restaurant and they added a touch of rose essence oil to it. I don't remember them making it with yogurt though. But, I could be wrong on that.

I've never used canned mango before...but if that's what the restaurants use..(I use frozen mango pulp from the Spanish food section and it comes out wonderful.)Tried fresh mangoes the first time and it was terrible. too fibrous.

Absolutely delicious!  Made it without ice at first, per other reviewers' suggestions - added a few ice cubes to suit my taste, but was fine without.  So refreshing!

This was okay. NOT restaurant quality. Do not add ice to the blender, instead pour over ice. If you do what the recipe suggest it will be way to watery. I would add some rose water.

Actually I thought the recipe came out much more like what I've had at Indian restaurants when I doubled the amount of yogurt and milk to 1 cup of yogurt and 1/2 cup of milk with a 30 oz. can of mango pulp.  I used the Kesar brand and it came out tasting perfect this way.  I also added a pinch or two of cardamom.  No sugar was necessary.  I can see why my Indian grocer recommended the Kesar brand.  Also, note that the breed of mangoes used in Indian brands is different from those normally sold in the United States so the taste will be off if you don't use an authentic Indian brand.

I have not seen mango in a can before. I decided to try the recipe with a fresh partially defrosted mango, but thought the ratio of the amount of liquid to fruit was kind of low. Unless, canned mangoes come in a lot of juice. I made a 1/2 a recipe, and as I suspected it needed more liquid. For the juice, I just added a small container of mandarin oranges that were in juice and some additional milk. It also badly needed some sweetener even though my mango seemed sweet. Maybe, the canned has sugar in it, not sure. I squeezed in some honey and blended for a few more seconds. It was very refreshing on a muggy day today and I am glad it worked, even though I really had to tweak it! TY

This was very good, though I read previous reviewers' comments and went with a very ripe mango instead of cans of mango pulp. I also used less than half the ice and it was delicious and refreshing.

Good but not fabulous. A little blander than I expected. Needs some tang.

We had an Indian dinner for my Mom's birthday last night, and the Mango Lassi was a delicious and simple dessert. I used coconut milk instead of plain milk, and used vanilla yogurt because that is all we had. Tasty!

I used more yogurt and less milk and less ice cubes. I used Libby canned Mango slices with juice and they came out so smooth and perfect. I also added just a few tablespoons of powdered sugar which added a nice sweetness to it.

Perfect!  I made several batches over the weekend, and everyone raved about the lassis.  These were exactly like what I've had in restaurants.  I could not find canned mango pulp, and used canned diced mango with the juice.  The ratios and sweetness were right on the money.  This is a new staple in my house.

I blended only 1 1/2 cups of the ice, then I  just put 2 ice cubes in each cup of the mango lassi. You end up with a thicker starting mango lassi but it gives you a colder, better drink by the end

Thanks so much for this recipe! I used it for one of my class projects and it turned out quite amazing with a few changes. The only problem was there is way to much yogurt. Thats all I tasted first time around. The next day I made it again and added only a small amount of yogurt and it was a perfect! Otherwise this is an fabulous recipe! I'm definitely making this again!

I used canned Kesar Mango pulp bought at my Indian grocery store, but I used equal parts mango and yogurt and a little less than one part ice.  I didn't have milk, so I used a little water instead.  It was the perfect thick creamy consistency.
