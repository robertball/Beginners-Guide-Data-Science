I tried this last night and used fresh beets & carrots (not canned).   It worked like a charm to boil the veggies, blend then and by adding a bit of the carrot water back into the blended veggies, it created a beautiful sauce.  THANK YOU for sharing this recipe! My hubby cannot tolerate tomatoes so this has given us a way to share everything from pizza to pasta to chili again!

Wow!  After receiving sticker-shock at the price of the no-tomato sauce in my local whole food store, I went in search of a recipe I could do myself.  I am pleasantly surprised at how deceiving this is!  My youngest son has a tomato sensitivity and this is a great substitute.  Make sure to use the red wine vinegar to match the acidity of the tomatoes.  I am now going to research no-tomato ketchup recipes.

Man oh man, this was good!  I sent this recipe to a co-worker that's allergic to tomatoes.  He brought it in to work and let me try it.  It's yummy!  I can tell that there are other veggies in the sauce, but I couldn't tell you that there weren't tomatoes in it.  I'm going to start adding this in with my regular tomato based sauce just to get more veggies into the mix.  Yum!

I was really excited to find this recipe since my girlfriend is allergic to tomatoes.  The first time I made it, it was a little more pasty than saucy.  The next time I made it I added in some roasted red bell pepper (from the jar, blended), a little vegetable broth, and pepper.  This made it more saucy and tasty!  So thankful to have a tomato sauce substitute, and cheap to make!

I can't eat red tomatoes and have been looking for alternatives to Alfredo and pesto sauce for quite a while. I really liked this recipe. It mimicked "red" sauce so well, I had to train my brain that it was ok to eat :) it came out a little too thick, but I think that was because I used fresh carrots instead of canned. My husband (the anti-vegetarian) and my picky teen even tried it and liked it.

Delicious and a great substitute for a tomato sauce.  I agree with the others: add vegetable broth to make it more sauce-like, otherwise it seemed too thick to me. I also added chopped fresh basil, which I think added extra flavor.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

I was diagnosed with a tomato allergy a few years ago and have missed my homemade lasagna so SO bad.  This sauce was the first time I've had good lasagna in years!! If you have a tomato allergy, this recipe is life changing :)
To me, it just tastes like a low-acid tomato sauce.  My husband complained loudly about how he'll hate the sauce because he can't stand beets.  But after he tried it, he's been more than willing to go for seconds.  He admits that you can't taste the beets.
My only suggestion is adding a few tablespoons of chicken broth and plenty of oregano and basil.  The sauce takes on the seasonings very well.
THANK YOU!!

I absolutely LOVE Italian & Mexican foods, but something in the tomato causes swelling in my feet & ankles. I have had this recipe for quite a while, & I finally got around to using it this past Sunday to go over my meatloaf, and BOY-OH-BOY-OH-BOY!! Am I ever glad I did! I didn't have a bay leaf, so I added a little more Italian Seasoning, tweaked my seasonings (a pinch of sugar, a dash of hot sauce, & a splash of Sweet Chili sauce)...it made quite a bit (enough so that turned around & used the leftovers & made spaghetti for the next nite!) I will most DEFINITELY be tweaking the Italian Seasonings & using my favorite Mexican seasonings (chili powder, cumin, & Adobe) to make some homemade chili within the next few weeks! I did take a picture of the meatloaf when it was done..at work right now, so I will upload it later!

Making this from scratch (boiling the carrots and beets) was a lot of work and it just tasted weird! I could definitely taste the red wine vinegar, and it didn't taste at all like tomatoes. The only saving grace were the onions and italian seasoning. Still, it is edible.

I stumbled across a similar recipe after finding out my son and I were allergic to tomatoes. I use cider vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar and oregano, basil, onion powder, parsley and thyme instead of Italian seasoning. I also use the main ingredients (beets, carrots, and vinegar) with different spices to make ketchup, barbeque sauce, salsa, sloppy joes and chili.

What a great idea! This was delicious. I used garden beets and fresh carrots (steamed then cooked w/ spices then pureed) and added about 3/4 c cooked red lentils for protein (you can't taste them but they make for a filling meal). Had to add about 1/2 c water for consistency. I used rice vinegar as didn't have the other -- served wi/ veggie pasta and a side of kale, a sprinkle of old cheddar. Delicious!

wow this sauce is actually quite delicious.  I normally hate beets but i made this for my bf who hates tomato sauce.  To my surprise i really likes this sauce too.  The vinegar help to cut the sweetness quite well (the sweetness is what i hate about beets).  Overall this is a very good and healthy variation on pasta sauce.  thank you for the recipe!

Love this recipe! I'm allergic tomatoes and I thought I was destined to a life with no spaghetti, thanks to you, I'm not! I added red wine to make the sauce less thick, and it turned out great. Thanks so much for sharing this!

So. I glanced at this recipe and was ecstatic that there was something to finally use the some of the canned goods that have been getting hoarded here...  Making this for kids so some of you may know they have sensitive palates too... I substituted Balsamic Vinegar for the suggested Red Wine Vinegar and had jarred minced garlic instead of fresh (sigh).  I also added a bit  more olive oil (to ease the puree) salt (to counter sweetness) and during the onion sautee i snuck in a pat of butter ( dont judge me) however... I taste often during my prep and this recipe is delicious. I am a "tweak geek" though so the edits were inevitable.

I would rate this a 5* for flavor, however the consistency is more like a tomato paste.  I added a bit of water to thin it, but I would recommend a bit of vegetable broth, which I didn't have on hand.  My grandson is allergic to tomatoes, so this was a real treat to fix for him so that he could have spaghetti with the rest of the family.  Great recipe, easy to make.

I recently started avoiding tomatoes and thought I wouldn’t be able to enjoy a red pasta sauce again. 
This recipe turned out fantastic! Even my husband likes it. 
I used fresh beets and carrots. I also added mushroom broth to make it saucier as it turned out very thick at first. 
I added red wine, mushrooms, chipotle peppers, smoked paprika and venison. 
Y’all! This recipe is great! 
This opens up so many options for me again! Pizza sauce, chili, etc

Oh my gosh, this recipe has saved us! We have lived without red sauce for almost two years because of my boyfriend's allergy to tomatoes. I made just a few changes: substituted 2 tbsp lemon juice for the red wine vinegar and used the juice I reserved from draining the veggies to thin it out and make it more saucy. This tastes exactly like tomato sauce!!! Thank you!! We're so excited to make all the things with red sauce we haven't been able to eat!

It's sweet and a nice change of pace. We were checking our family for salicalyte sp?) intollerances and needed a tomato free spaghetti sauce. Its a bold pink color and ppl watching you reheat and eat your leftovers are gonna give you funny looks but I truthfully didnt mind it. I could go either way, traditional or beet sauce. We call it 'Beetsghetti' at our house and even the kids like it. Great way to sneak in new flavours in a familiar way.

I can’t eat tomatoes right now, and this is a wonderful substitute for tomatoe sauce. I made eggplant Parmesan with it and it was very good. The longer you let it cook on the stove, the better the sauce. Thank you so much for sharing! It is wonderful to be able to eat certain Italian dishes again!

Now my son and I can enjoy spaghetti due to our food allergies including tomatoes. This doesn't take long to make and I use a Ninja small blender to puree the canned veggies for a smooth sauce. I make a double recipe and freeze the rest in small bags for pizza sauce and dipping sauce.  Thank you for helping with an awesome alternative.

I have made this several times and love it! My husband was shocked when I told him there was no tomatoes in this sauce, it tastes exactly like tomato pasta sauce. I add a jar of roasted red peppers as suggested by another review. I also add mushrooms, celery and ground beef. I use this as a base for pizza sauce and chilli as well. Great recipe!

I haven’t made this yet but is there anything I could use other than red wine vinegar to make it ulcer safe?

Made as directed. Loved it! Was thicker than I prefer. Will try suggestion of adding vegetable broth next time. So excited to have spaghetti again!

Perfect.  Just perfect, and delicious.  Very few changes: subbed frozen carrots and balsamic vinegar, and added some broth to thin it out a bit.  Made for my gerdie husband, who really liked it.  Since it's just the two of us, I put some leftover sauce in the freezer, and another meal-size in the fridge.  Thanks for posting!

It's a great recipe for those, like me, who are trying to get more into their diet, the biggest problem was the vinegar. The red wine vinegar was just a little too much for my palate. I fixed this by adding a can(or maybe two for the whole thing) of Cherry Fanta soda, this cut the smell and taste tremendously and I think in the end made it taste more like the store bought tomato sauce I like. I might just replace the vinegar altogether with the soda, but that's for me. Thank you so much for making and sharing this recipe it helps so much.

I'm allergic to tomatoes and this recipe has been so amazing. I've made it twice, one with fresh carrots and once with canned. Canned is definitely better - fresh carrots made the sauce too sweet. It also needs a pretty liberal addition of salt (to taste). I also add extra oregano and basil. It also holds up really well: reheating pizza, frozen then microwaved, etc. According to a friend, much better than pumpkin-based no-tomato sauces.

I'll probably make it again just because I like beets but as a marinara it wasnt as I would of expected.  I still like all the ingredients so yeah I'll make it again. The white thing in pic is cheddar cheese.

I followed this recipe EXACTLY with no changes and it was AMAZING. Super easy, tasted just like tomato sauce and I poured it over gluten free noodles. The family never even knew it wasn't tomato sauce! This is my new favorite!

Husband has trouble with tomatoes, so I tried this.  Really good, husband, me and kids all give a thumbs up.  I don't even like beets.  I love that this uses canned veg, easy to keep cans on hand, ready to go. Much "softer" than a tomato sauce, which is nice.  Don't skimp on the garlic, some of my 4 cloves were on the smaller side, so I will definitely add more next time.  This would be good made into a chili, with or without meat.

10/10 "tomato" sauce! This is a life saver since I can't eat tomatoes anymore and  I used to use tomato sauce for many of my family recipes. The flavor is spot on and the texture is hand in hand with my old sauce!

Will not make again.  Followed the instructions but after 30 minutes on simmer, the sauce was burning.  Recipe is lacking liquid.  Had to throw it out.

This turned out great! My husband found out he is allergic to tomatoes so pretty much all of my recipes are out because of that. I found this recipe and I was very skeptical but it tasted pretty close to spaghetti sauce. My husband liked it as well so I will be using this in all my recipes that call for tomato sauce.

Excellent recipe.
I was very surprised how well it turned out.
I used fresh beets and carrots.  A bit of work especially as beets are so messy.

Thank you for this creation!

Good basic recipe but the reviews made it  5 stars! I used 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar and 2 TB Italian seasoning and simmered for about 3 hours but still had faint sweet taste - until I added good ole salt and pepper.  Perfect!

I'm making it right now and based on my taste tests it's working great!

This recipe was a real savior of tonight's dinner. I really wanted some spaghetti but had no tomatoes and didn't want to go to the store to get some. I was able to make it with fresh beets and carrots, which we have huge sacks of them hanging around so I was able to make the substitution easily enough. I didn't have the red wine vinegar, but a half and half mix of white vinegar and balsamic vinegar was a suitable replacement.

I also added ground chicken as I do like some meat in my sauce. I'm really looking forward to this new take on my favorite!

I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar. I also used onion powder and garlic powder instead of fresh because that is all I had. It still tastes good to me. I'm amazed how much it looks like tomatoes. I still have to test it on my husband.

Thank you for this great recipe.  I used lemon juice in place of the vinegar.  I also prefer steaming fresh carrots in place of the canned when I have the time. I don't miss tomato sauce anymore!

My daughter is allergic to tomato so this recipe is life changing in my house! She said it tastes like how I thought sauce would ?? I will be making this again and again!! The only change I made was that I reserved some beet and carrot water to make the consistency more like sauce.

I have a tomato allergy and have been researching different recipes for a while. I think this recipe is a great recipe to start with. I make mine in the slowcooker to really stew the flavors together. I've found canned pumpkin is great at cutting the sweetness, just add a spoonful at a time to taste. For replacing tomato tartness I've been experimenting with jarred capers, jarred pimentos, lemon/lime juice and vinegar.  Mushrooms and bouillon can add a deeper depth of flavor. Good luck.
