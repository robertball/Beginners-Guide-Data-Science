Added about 4 oz. of Cool Whip and topped with Heath toffee bits. Makes 24 cups. Served in 2 oz. lidded condiment cups at an adult ice cream social and everybody went crazy for them. Will definitely make them again.  They also keep very well in a freezer as a last minute dessert option!

This was incredible and veryyyy strong! It's half liquor, so I expected no less. The butterscotch flavor is very nice, it's smooth, creamy, and potent!

Totally love this recipe. I doubled the recipe and made 30 1.5oz shots. I followed the recipe exactly. It's sweet and of course the liquor content is low so you don't get that grainy liquor after taste at all. Great for adult parties.
