4.17.20   I knew that the amount of brown sugar in this recipe would be too much for us, so I scaled it back to 1/3 of that amount (personal taste preference), and my husband even commented that was almost too sweet for him.  Rather than steaming the green beans stove top, I microwaved them for 2-1/2 minutes, and they were perfectly cooked. I’ve made many sweet-sour green beans over the years, but this is the first time that I‘ve used brown sugar rather than white sugar.  I definitely could tell a difference, and actually liked it better.  The other ingredient that differentiates this recipes is the dry mustard, and again, liked it a lot.  I would suggest that you start out with a smaller amount of brown sugar because this recipe really has quite a bit.  You always can add more, but if it’s too sweet, you can’t take it out.  Thanks for sharing your Grandma’s recipe, we liked it!
