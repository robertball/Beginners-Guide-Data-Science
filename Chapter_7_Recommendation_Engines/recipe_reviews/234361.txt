The Myers' make a mean Blue Meanie. I had the great opportunity of tasting these at an AR gathering for a margarita party. Several margaritas were made by Marianne and Baking Nana and we taste tested them all. This one clearly stood out from all of the others. If you want to impress your guests or even yourself this is it. Randy and Cathy you blew away the competition with the Blue Meanies.

We enjoyed this "Blue Meanies" variation on a margarita. Mine was green, not blue as in the photos, presumably owing to differences in brands of liquors. I made mine with freshly-squeezed and strained orange, lemon, and lime juices, MEAGHERS triple sec, BOLS blue Curacao, GOLD SAUZA tequila, and blended ice.  Thank you Cathy Myers for sharing your recipe.
