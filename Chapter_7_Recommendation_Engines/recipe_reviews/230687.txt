I usually make a white sauce and then add the cooked peas to it, but this worked OK adding the flour and milk to the peas and then thickening.  I used only 1/2 cup of milk, and it was the perfect consistency for us, so I would caution you  about adding a full cup.  Start with less and then add more if needed.  Nice basic recipe for creamed peas.

To bring out the taste of the peas, add a teaspoon or so of sugar.  Also, a little fresh parsley.  You can skip the part about cooking the peas first- just cook them in the butter until they thaw, and just start to cook through, then add the flour, salt, and milk.

Creamed peas!  Excellent, quick and perfect for two.  I used new garden peas (sold in a bag at grocers), next time maybe a little less milk, but oh so good!  I served with a new recipe for a salmon loaf (used up a few small cans of salmon) and some fresh mashed potatoes. (Extra cream peas spilled over on potatoes). Yummy!

Great recipe, I also only used 1/2 cup milk as suggested by another review. Reminded me of cooking with my grandma! Thank you for sharing!

This recipe is great however I altered my just a little bit. First I used the juice out of a can of peas to make this dish, worked great and added flavor to my creamed peas, secondly I chose to make rue first ( Butter and flour) this worked out great as its the thicken agent in this dish. Lastly I found that instead of 1 1/2 cups water just just 1 cup of juice out of the can and  1 1/2 cups of milk or cream. This is a great dish and one I loved very much.

Good!  Used 1/2 c. milk and a dash of pepper as suggested by the previous reviewer, and a slice of american cheese as mentioned in the "note".  Also added a shake of spicy seasoned salt for a little added flavor.

I made this as written, the only change I made is using ghee (clarified butter) instead of regular butter.

I added a very generous amount of parmesan, some garlic salt, and some pepper and it was lovely.
