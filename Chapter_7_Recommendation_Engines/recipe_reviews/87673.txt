I was looking for the long johns with the cream filling.  However, I figured I'd try these and attempt to squirt some stuffings into it.  Mine came out a little too dense for that, but as far as doughnuts go, they were good, especially with chocolate frosting.  They could stand to have been wider to keep from rolling to the heavy side in the oil.

The first batch we followed recipe exactly. They turned out like cinnamon sticks. The 2nd time we let rise 3x size and cut wider and they turned out right. We find the glaze sticks better if you wait till they are a few hours cooled. Flavor is wonderful, even a bite without glaze is tasty. Better than store bought by far. I have attached photo.

The were a bit dense.  If I make the recipe again, I'll allow more time for rising and I'll add more spice.  The nutmeg has great flavor but next time I think I'll add a little mace or allspice, too.

these are just like down town . but I found that you must spray your wax paper with pam or what ever. if you don't you will never get them off the wax paper without tearing them apart. also the frosting is great but I used only 1 tsp. of maple flavoring and that was perfect.after rolling out the dough I used a pizza cutter to cut them and that worked perfect.

These did not work for me.  I tried everything to get them to rise.  They were like sticks.  Sure wanted them to turn out, as my hubby loves long johns, and this is the only recipe I have found.

My husband is a long John lover from way back when...so while he put the kids to sleep I made these and then he fried them up.  He approved- he really liked them with chocolate frosting.

Found them to be dense, needs to proof longer. Good when dipped in hot syrup and coated with coconut.

Traditional long johns are light and airy. These were not. I let them rise an hour first then I let them cut them and shaped them and let them rise another 45min. They still were supper dense. Additionally they had a super yeasty taste which was more like friend bread and less like a donut. I donâ€™t feel like these have enough sugar. I dressed them up and frosted anyway. The glaze they suggested is not good. It tastes like wet powdered sugar and not donut glaze. These were a good attempt but I probably will not make this recipe again. It needs work.

These Long Johns came out wonderfully light and delicate...just let them rise long enough, dough rolled out very easily and they were delicious glazed with a vanilla glaze and filled with homemade peach jelly and homemade cherry-peach jam.  My grandson, Liam, loved them as did the rest of the family.  I used a vintage Houpt Bakery rotary Long John/Bismark cutter to cut them and it worked perfectly.  Next time I have a request to glaze with chocolate and add sprinkles.  Definitely worth the effort.
