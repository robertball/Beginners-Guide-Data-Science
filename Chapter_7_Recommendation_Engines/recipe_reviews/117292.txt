This is one on my favorite dishes now!  We didn't marinade it overnight (we found the recipe just before dinner time) and just used it as a rub.  We have made it twice in the last 2 weeks.  WOW!  The flavors are complex and really pair well with the pork.  This will be a staple in our menu planning from now on!

Very good, very juicy. I did not have fennel and put in more rosemary.  Also used some lemon pepper which was very tasty.

This was awesome, I added some Mrs. Dash Garlic Herb and we cooked ours on the grill.  It was the best pork roast we have ever had.  I paired it up with roasted potatoes that I seasoned with rosemary, garlic, salt ,pepper and a lttle oil.

Made this yesterday - it was delicious.  Cooked for 55 minutes at 350 to reach 150 degrees.  It was perfect!

Easy and tasty. The rub for this is great, although not everyone may enjoy the fennel. I made a paste out of the rub ingredients with my mortar and pestle. The roast was really moist and flavourful. I tented it with aluminum foil for 20 minutes before slicing it. It paired well with some lemon and olive oil roasted potatoes from another site. I would definitely make this again.

My family and I weren't crazy about this recipe.  The flavor of the fennel was overpowering.  My son had to eat his with ketchup to cover up the taste.

Came out great for Easter, easy rub to make and great directions.  Might try to change up the seasoning next time.

This has been a favorite of ours for years! However, I do not use fennel and I use fresh rosemary (2 twigs) The garlic, olive oil and rosemary are processed in a coffee grinder.  I criss-cross the top of the roast with a knife, grind fresh pepper over the top, THEN rub the garlic paste in. After the roast is cooked I place 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary across the top. I cook at 325 degrees for 2 to 3 hours and I place a pan of water in the oven under the roast.  Delicious!

I made this roast exactly as suggested. Besides that it had a wonderful flavor, it also smelled wonderful through the house while baking .  My husband normally doesn't like anything enhanced with spices, but he did like this.  We had the left-overs cold and it was still good.  I will make it again and again!
