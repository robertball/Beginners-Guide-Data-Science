Was good. Sauce is a little sweet, I poured over the fish and it was too much would be fine on the side.  I will make again just put the sauce in a dippingbowlon the side.

Very good flavor.  My only negative for this recipe is most of the crumbs fell off. I am thinking I left them a bit too coarse. Defiantly worthy of another try!

I used mayo, 10% cream (meant for coffee) and skipped the parsley. Baked in the oven about 5-10 minutes. Sauce was good, needed a tad bit more mustard and the fish itself was okay, but the breading didn't really stick. It was good, but leftovers were soggy of course.
