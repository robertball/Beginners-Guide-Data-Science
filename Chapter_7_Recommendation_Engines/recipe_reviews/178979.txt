Easy to make, but in the end, very salty.

The bottoms of the puff pastry burned after cooking it for about 10 minutes so I had to cut off the bottoms. It did taste really good though and would be nice to serve as an appetizer or bring to a party.

These have become an instant hit at family gatherings.  I have made them 3 times now and have had requests for the recipe each time.  Great easy, simple recipe.

I made these for a party this weekend and they were eaten quickly, probably because they had cheese and everyone loves cheese. However, I thought these were lacking flavor.  I will not make them again even though people ate them in a matter of minutes, I think mini quiche would be better.

I made and like it. I've substituted chicken for the bacon occasionally.
