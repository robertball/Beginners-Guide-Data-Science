This was very good. I made it on a Sunday night and portioned it into servings to have for breakfast for the work week. It held up really well and was very satisfying. It is really easy to make, and I think it will be a great recipe to use as a base for whatever you have in your fridge. I didn't have a zucchini, so I used beet greens and I didn't even have to adjust the cooking time at all.

This was just good, not great.  Actually it is better the next day.  The problem is that zucchini has such a mild flavor.  The only other reviewer (at this time) gave it a 5 star rating - but didn't use zucchinis - she used beet greens.  I sauted diced zucchini (not grated) with onion and sweet red pepper.  I used extra onion, basil and even crumpled bacon with the squash and it was still bland.   I liked the zucchini diced, but next time will try it without sauteing it, or I will try other ingredients next time, because I like the frittata concept

No changes but left out the pepper due to allergies. I loved it! Dairy free and flavor intensifies after setting or the next day. Reheat slices  in a toaster.

I prefer Dill instead of Basil and I added mushrooms and shredded cheddar cheese on top under the broiler for a few, delicious
