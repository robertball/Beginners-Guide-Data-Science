This was so delicious - everybody loved it.  It makes a big pot, so be prepared to freeze the leftovers.  I added 1 t. of powdered ginger, could probably have added even more.  I also felt like I could have even used a whole onion.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was wonderful!!  I made a few very minor adjustments... I increased the sugar to 1 cup (it seemed too tart with 3/4 cup, but I'm sure tartness varies depending on the ripeness of the cranberries).  I also added 1/2 tsp of orange zest.  I used a 2qt saucepan and ended up not having enough room for all of the apple (granny smiths) and pear pieces.  It was great with the amount used.  Next time I will only use one apple and one pear.  This will be a standard Turkey Day Dish in our house from now on!  Excellent recipe - thanks for sharing it!!

I loved this recipe and it was so easy to make. My husband even liked it and added it to his pork chops. I didn't have any pears so I just used more apples.

Personally, I do not like cranberries, but I was charged with making the cranberry side for Christmas, and I thought this sounded interesting. I am giving this five stars because my family just fell all over themselves for the recipe, and thought it was the best!

My aunt made this for Thanksgiving and it was fabulous!!!  She said she only makes easy dishes and I don't think she changed anything. Everyone raved about it so I'm pretty sure it will become a regular Thanksgiving side.  Thanks for sharing.

This is really good. I added about 1/4 tsp. of cloves and nutmeg. Cooked it about 1/2 to 45 min. longer then stated. Served with my chesse and sausage platter for Thanksgiving. Thanks for sharing.

i didn't much care for the taste or texture of the chutney. I tried to add less sugar, just to be healthier, but it's impossible due to the pungent vinegar flavor.  I was making dinner for 5, so I thought the "6" yield would be fine, but it was waaaay too much. If you try the recipe, I would suggest halving it.

Tried something new for the Company potluck.  What better place to try a new recipe.  There was some left, so I am not sure if there was a big push to get another scoop of this.  It tasted fine, unusual by itself, but I have never had chutney.  Did like to lix it up with everything on the plate.  Might make it again but there are other cranberry recipes to explore.

This was easy & quite yummy, though i will reduce the sugar next time to let the tartness of the berry come through better.  i also added a pear.

This is a great recipe and I made some modifications based on ingredients that I had on hand. I added additional sugar as another reviewer suggested. I also combined some ingredients from the "Mum's Cranberry Chutney" recipe adding 1 cup of raisins and 1 stalk of celery (diced). I used 1 apple and I skipped the pears because I didn't have any on hand. Finally, I added a little ground nutmeg and ground ginger.

This definitely got better with age.  I had one half small red onion and one half small yellow onion so I reckoned that would equal one half of a large red onion (the recipe did not indicate the size of the red onion and here the large ones are actually more prevalent).  At first blush way too much onion, after a couple of days it softened in terms of flavour.  Hopefully by Christmas (three days) it will be smoother and thus earn a better review.

I have made this for a couple of years now. I love it. I use 2 cans of  whole berries cranberry sauce instead of fresh cranberries though. Love it warm or cold.

Onion was too strong.  Way too tart and 'vinegary', so needed lots of extra sugar and orange juice.  I also added spices to try and improve taste.  My husband thought it tasted like ketchup.

Awesome flavours, extras can be frozen (in smaller containers) for future use, as it does make quite a lot.

Great change from ordinary cranberry sauce! Easy to make and tastes good! It is a bit tart, but thats how we like it - you can add 1/4 cup more sugar if needed. Only change I made was instead of 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, I used 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. I also cooked it about 15 mins longer so it was a bit more saucier. No need to ever go back to the can after trying this recipe!
