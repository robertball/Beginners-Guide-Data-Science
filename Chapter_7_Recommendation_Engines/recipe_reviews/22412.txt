These cute little tassies were a lot less work than I thought they would be.  They tasted great too.

I just got done making these for a cookie swap. The recipe is incredibly easy, and doesn't have a lot of ingredients. They came out really tasty too. I only gave this recipe 4 stars though because they weren't nearly as pretty as I was hoping. The peanut butter filling formed a crust that cracked, but not in a nice looking way. I will definitely make this recipe again, but next time I might try peanut butter (maybe 3/4 cup?) instead of chopped chips.
