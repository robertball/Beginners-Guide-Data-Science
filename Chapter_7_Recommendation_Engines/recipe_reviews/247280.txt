Pretty simple and straight forward. The mustard made for a nice bark and that is my favorite part. The only problem I had was that it  needed more smoke time. I ended up letting mine go for 9 hours and it was perfect.

This is an easy, excellent recipe. We put it in our Traeger in the morning and had it for dinner that evening.  Everyone loved it. This will be our go to recipe.
