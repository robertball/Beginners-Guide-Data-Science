Everyone at our party loved this salsa however I'm happy I left out the red pepper. It was plenty hot with the jalapeno peppers even though I was very careful to get all the seeds out. Great recipe but go easy on the peppers!

this turned out pretty good.. i was making this for bf's daughter so i added a tsp of sugar bc she likes sweet.. instead of the red onion i used one green onion as she's not a fan of onion.. only used one jalapeno that i deveined/deseeded as that's all i had in the fridge.. and i used hatch chile pepper powder for the red pepper.. i made this one day in advance to let the flavors meld.. bf and his daughter really liked it.. ty for the recipe

Used canned pineapple and mango from a jar. Turns out great with fresh or canned.
