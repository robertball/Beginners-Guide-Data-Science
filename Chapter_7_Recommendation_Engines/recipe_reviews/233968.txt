I made this for lunch and it was spectacular. The spices were right on. Really, really good!! I cut the recipe in half and added the lemon "to taste". I have made enough recipes with lemon to know that all lemons are different. I added the zest of one lemon and tasted the soup. It was "almost" perfect. I added just a tablespoon of juice after that and it was perfectly lemony, just how we like it. Also, I just added the uncooked orzo to the soup and let it boil for about 8 minutes. We didn't have any left overs. Anyone that isn't familiar with cooking with orzo should know that it does completely soak up the broth where leftovers are concerned, so if you know you are making more than will be eaten, you should make it on the side and add to each bowl; otherwise, the next day there will not be any liquid in the soup left. Delicious and I will be making this again soon!!

Wonderful soup. Only change was to keep the orzo and soup separate as I planned on eating this over several days and didn't want the orzo to absorb all the broth.

I had been CRAVING that Lemon Chicken Orzo Soup that Panera bread only serves in the summer for 2 months and it was not to be found. I found this recipe and it totally nailed the soup!!! I was fantastic and exactly what I was looking for. So delicious, so light, so lemony. I even made some homemade croutons to go on top and shaved a little parmesan on top right before serving. It was a huge hit with the family. The only thing I did differently was I cut up the vegetables smaller cause I don't like big chunks and I cooked the soup in the crock pot. I put in the orzo uncooked and it did not take long for it to get done. I can't say enough good things about this soup!

I reduced the serving size to four servings and added in more veggies and orzo, and half the fresh juiced lemon, all the called for spices but dashed until it reached the flavor I like. I took the advice of another reviewer and used lemon rotisserie chicken...a real time saver. I tossed the spinach in right before serving and just wilted to keep the flavor. This was such a nice light refreshing soup and I actually like it better without the cheese, but the guys loved the cheese. I've never had Panera's soup so can't compare to that, but we all sure enjoyed this and I'll make again. Would be a wonderful soup for someone with a cold.

Why would you cook the chicken first? Add the raw chicken to give the store bought broth more flavor. Make sure the chicken is cooked before serving.

Oh my god this soup is AMAZING! It's so light but still has so much flavor. It's much better if you make your own chicken stock as well. The only thing I added was half a cup of dry white wine when I added the stock. It made for such a deep flavor and I strongly recommend adding it. I will definitely make this again!

I would give this recipe more than 5 stars if I could. It is that good. So fresh, lemony, savory...really excellent. Easy to make and fast for a soup. I agree with others that you should leave the orzo out of the soup, even when storing for leftovers, because the orzo will soak up all the yummy broth.

Made this as the Buzz Recipe Group selection.  Since we enjoyed this so much, I would rate it higher than five stars if that were possible. For the chicken, I used the remains of a Roast Sticky Chicken - Rotisserie Style which I baked yesterday.  I cooked the orzo in boiling water in the microwave versus boiling on the stove. I also used my own homemade chicken broth. We love all of the spices that were called for in this recipe so they were all included. I sliced the baby spinach into ribbons and sprinkled it, along with the freshly grated Parmesan cheese, over the top of each bowl. This soup would be an excellent soup to share with someone that is under the weather. The aromatic scent of lemon in the broth just puts this soup over the top.  Thank you RennePaj for sharing your delicious recipe!

I was looking for a really delicious lemon chicken soup and was so happy to have found this one! I made no changes, other than to add additional orzo and chicken because my family tends to like soup a little "heartier". The flavors meld beautifully. It is light and tasty and everything wonderful that you would like in a soup and it satisfies that mid-winter comfort food craving! Eyes light up when this soup is served and it always gets eaten. I feel good knowing that I am serving my family a nutritious meal. I've never tried the Panera version, but now I'd like to - just to see if it's up to the standard of this version.

Delicious recipe.  I reduced to 8 servings.  I began by saut√©ing the vegetables and herbs, then added one bone-in chicken breast which I had chopped into two pieces.  I covered and simmered for 20 minutes.  I then added two 32oz cartons of chicken broth and brought to a boil.  Removed chicken to cool then chopped it into small cubes. I then finished recipe as directed except I substituted kale for the spinach and omitted the Parmesan cheese.  Will definitely make this again.

I've been coming to this site for years. Today I registered for the sole purpose of being able to rate this recipe with five stars and say wow. Someone else said this recipe has the perfect amount of everything...I second that. It is flawless. I seared the chicken in olive oil in the dutch oven first. A bit of added flavor from the fond. This is the only thing I did differently from the recipe. What a fabulous and healthy soup. Bet you can't eat just one bowl.

I read the reviews before I made this and I am glad I did.  I didn't cook the orzo separately but added it after I sauteed my veggies and added the broth.  I ended up adding more herbs to this because it was bland as written.  Once I adjusted the herbs it was really good.  I think you just have to play with the seasonings.

I came home feeling yucky and wanting soup.  I had everything on hand except to orzo so I subbed ditalini.  In half an hour I had a bowl of pure comfort and great taste.   Renee, you nailed this one!

Made this for Recipe Group...Delicious! I did not use the thyme b/c I didn't have any, and we really don't care for it. Also, I did not measure the lemon juice, but this lemon was pretty big and very juicy, so I just used 1/2, and that was plenty. I was actually able to cook the orzo right in the soup after adding the broth and bringing it to a boil, and that worked out great, and was one less step/pot to mess with. Not only is this soup flavorful, but it is very easy to make. I will def be making this one again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is one of the best soups I've ever made. Fantastic! I was a little worried about how much lemon juice was in it (was concerned it would be sour), but it was delicious, and the combination of parmesan cheese, with the lemon juice is incredible. The only thing I would change is that it was awfully thick, and I ended up adding more chicken broth. Definitely a keeper.

My husband LOVED this. I didn't have any thyme, and neither of us is crazy about cooked celery,  so I just added some celery salt and doubled the carrots. I used the juice and zest of one large lemon, and I used home-made chicken stock (didn't have enough, so had to add some home-made veggie stock). I also used more than half of a chicken we had leftover from the night before. Definitely cook (and store leftovers) the orzo separately. That made all the difference ; the first 2 times I made this I cooked the orzo in the soup and it was more like a casserole.

If I could give this 10 stars I would! I halved the recipe (keeping the same amount of carrots and celery), and substituted Italian seasoning for the oregano. I added cubed, uncooked chicken in at the same time as the veggies and simmered for 20 minutes. Like many others, I kept the orzo separate and added to individual serving bowls. I also added the lemon juice to taste. This shot straight to the top of my list of favorite soups. Thank you so much, ReneePaj!

Made this recipe last night for dinner.  It goes together very quickly for a weeknight meal and tastes great!  My wife thinks it's better than the Panera version. The tang of lemon is very warming and, I think, reduces the need for as much salt. Great job, Renee!

This is a great soup. I had some orzo that had been in my pantry for way too long, so I used up what I had. I didn't have carrots or celery on hand, so I added fresh mushrooms and some farfalle pasta to make sure I had enough bulk in the soup. If you add any pasta, just make sure that you let the pasta cook in the soup at a high temperature for at least ten minutes. The lemon juice and zest provide the hint of citrus flavor which really elevates this soup recipe.

Yum! I love lemon based soups. And, recipes like this are great for cleaning out the fridge and garden. Even though it's November my pepper garden is producing like crazy. So, I sauteed a bell pepper, spicy fajita bell pepper and a mild banana pepper with the onion. I'm a garlic nut so I used 4 big cloves and minced them rather largely. I had leftover whole wheat macaroni in the fridge which made this recipe even easier. I used the chicken from the Barefoot Contessa's Engagement Roast Chicken that I had made the night before. Along with homemade stock. I didn't have that much stock so I used less lemon juice (I only had 1 big juicy lemon). I also love fresh ground pepper so the soup had a lot of that. This was excellent!

I prepared this for the recipe group pick...so delicious and easy.  I actually followed the recipe to a "t" and it was perfect.  This is similiar to a soup served at our favorite Greek restaurant.  Hubs loved this and so did I!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

It was very tasty after I added several scoops of Better than Broth to it. Also there is quite a bit of prep work. The lemon is a good compliment to the other flavors. My husband really liked it and he is not real crazy about soup for dinner.

This was a good soup, although I've never had Panera's version to compare it to.  I followed the recipe as written, but next time I think I will adjust the lemon juice to taste, as mine came out a little more lemony than I would have liked.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, ReneePaj!

This soup was delicious! I used chicken stock instead of broth and added some chicken bouillon granules to boost the flavor. Doubled the chicken and orzo. The extra orzo did soak up alot of the stock, making it much more thick, but my husband likes soup that way. I found the 1/2 cup of lemon to be just right. I included the juice when I added the stock, giving it a chance to cook into the broth.I definitely recommend you give this a try!.

I loved this soup. So pretty in the bowl. It just tastes healthy. It makes a large amount, but that's O.K. I can eat that several days in a row. Used a couple of bouillon cubes to enhance the chicken broth from the cooked chicken.  I'll make this again, it is so good. I made exactly as given. I thought the lemon would be too strong, so added only half as much, but then I added the other half. It was great.

Frozen spinach worked surprisingly well. Too lemony for me - odd b/c I love lemons. To be fair, I didn't measure, just squoze it in, but thought I was being conservative.  Recommend adding lemon by increments, & taste-testing to suit your palate.

Amazing! Did not change a thing. Lovely balance of chicken and lemon in broth - fresh lemon is a must!  Family asked for more as well as the recipe. Next time, I will add a bit more chicken and carrots (just my preference). Thanks for sharing!

Recipe Group Selection:  19, October 2013 ~ Really liked this recipe a lot more than I thought we would.  It has a nice balance of ingredients and liked the light lemon flavor in the broth.  Rather than cook the chicken breast I purchased a lemon-pepper rotisserie chicken and picked off the meat to equal the 8 ounces.  I was pressed for time and this really helped me out.  I then used the leftover chicken in another meal.  Thanks for sharing Reneepaj - very good recipe.

Loved it.  Changes I made:  I used frozen spinach, because that is what I had and it did not seem to make a difference.  Also, I did not add the cheese or lemon slices at the end.  Otherwise I pretty much followed the recipe and it was really good.

This soup tasted just like Panera, but better!  I didn't alter the ingredient amounts, but I did use 2 large fresh chicken breasts chopped into small pieces.  I sauteed the chicken in the oil until there was no pink and then added the veggies.  Oh, I also did not pre-cook the orzo.  I just added a little more broth too keep it from getting too thick.

Love this soup!  I would make the orzo 'last' or while the broth and veggies are coming to a bowl. So the pasta doesn't over cook. I did add frozen spinach, which worked out great. 
I also used a cooked rotisserie chicken from the store, which made things much simpler. 
Enjoy!

I really really really liked this soup.  The lemon in it makes it stand above the rest.  The only thing I changed was use meat off a rotisserie chicken and used my own chicken broth.   I won't half the recipe next time and will again use a rotisserie chicken but boil the bones for my broth.  You could put all kinds of veggies int his... like kale, asparagus, or even squash.  I will for sure make this again.

Thanks ReneePaj for a great recipe!

I'm not a fan of Panera's restaurant, I made this recipe solely on others reviews.  My family & myself all thought is was just ok.  I used rotisserie chicken (like others) added uncooked orzo to soup, this speed up preparation time. Very nice lemony flavor.   I will make it again however, I will add more garlic & adjust herbs to our liking.  Make sure you add parmesan over soup.

I have finally found my go to chicken noodle soup! I love this recipe. I used a rotisserie chicken and from other suggestions, didn't use as much lemon juice (approx. 1/4c vs. 1/2).

I enjoyed this recipe and I am not a lemon person.  It was subtle.  I've never had the Panera version, so I can not comment about that.  I would make this recipe again.  If I were making it for a family, I would probably double the chicken.  It was fine for me, as I am not really a big carnivore.

Winner Winner Lemon Chicken Dinner! I made this for the second time today, just as delish the second time around. I get the best results by poaching the chicken breasts. The other reviewer was right about the lemon juice, I would roll it back if you use fresh. I make soup for many friends and neighbors and this is one on the top requests.

Very good soup! I followed the recipe for the soup, except I more than doubled the chicken. We wanted a heartier soup. In the end, after tasting it I decided to add the zest of a second lemon and the juice from that lemon as well. It was very good. My husband and two sons really enjoyed it too. The sprinkle of Parmesan before serving was a must. Without it, the soup was missing a little something.

Homemade stock always makes for a better soup but some soups absolutely need it.  I think that this is one of them.  The thin broth did not stand up to all the lemon.  Also, I had forgotten the strange color that lemon can turn spinach so mine did not end up being a pretty soup.

Will this recipe replace my normal chicken soup recipe? No, but I did appreciate trying this version. I followed the general consensus to reduce the lemon (I used 1/4 c) but will use the full amount next time. I also zested 1/2 a medium-sized lemon and added it too. Preferring thighs in chicken soup, I "crockpotted" 1lb of them and seasoned them with pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. When done, I shredded it and added it along with fresh spinach (torn into smaller pieces) to the soup a few minutes before serving. I boiled the orzo separately so I could add it when making leftovers. I replaced the thyme with marjoram, as I prefer it in chicken soup. This recipe makes a solid, hearty soup which my hubby (who wasn't feeling well) and daughter and I enjoyed.

I made this for the first time tonight. I didn't have any onions do I used a package of onion soup mix. I also used one cup of lemon juice after tasting the soup, but I love the extra lemony flavor. You might not. It makes A LOT of soup so, if you're really cooking for one like me, you may want to cut it in half or freeze some of the extra. But it's reallllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly good.

I just added a splash of an old white zinfandel we had on hand for cooking to replace some of the liquid that evaporated.  My husband loved it and will be eating the leftovers all week.  It will probably be very refreshing cold, too.

Yummy! I made it exactly as the recipe called for, but I accidentally left out the bay leaf. It was still great and I think I like it better than Panera's version.

I made this for my son when he had the flu and he ate every last drop after telling he was not hungry. LOL I used chicken thighs instead and used some cornstarch to thicken but everything else the same. Delicious recipe!

I'm addicted to making soups over the winter months, and am always looking for new ones to add to my rotation. This recipe is a total keeper! I used a rotisserie chicken, and added more carrots..everything else I kept the same. My husband and I loved this soup, and will become a staple in our home.

So delicious! Perfect on a cold, rainy, Seattle night. I added some parsley leaves at the end for garnish and they also lent a little bite to the final product. Scaled it down to 4 and it was a perfect main dish for two. Thanks so much ReneePaj!

Interesting flavor, but WAY too lemony for our taste. My kids, all under 10, didn't care for it at all, and they love a wide variety of foods. If I make it again, I'd cut the amount of zest and lemon juice in half, and cross my fingers.

Absolutely fantastic!!  Very easy to make and very tasty!  I used about half the lemon it calls for the second time I made it to avoid a heavy lemon taste.

i really liked this.  i made as written, except used feta cheese instead of grated parm, i thought that would have gone better with the lemon flavor.  i actually tried a small amount with the parm, and liked the feta better.  i don't know what the Panera version tastes like, but i liked this :-) thanks for the post ReneePaj

Light and fresh. I used small shelled pasta instead of orzo. Turned out great, the lemon compliments the Parmesan cheese.

Savory, bright, delicious.  A great way to use leftover roasted chicken.  I cut the recipe in half, using only half of the suggested amount of lemon juice.  It turned out perfectly.

This was a great soup.  I doubled the lemon zest and lemon juice.  I like to saut√© the chicken breasts in with the onions and vegetables.  I then remove the chicken, chop it up and add it back at the end of the soup.  I also used chard instead of spinach since that was available from my garden.  My kids devoured this soup.  I will be making it again.  Maybe next time a little less orzo.

This Soup was delicious!
I just tweaked the original recipe a tad after reading a few reviews. I used Chunks of Rotisserie chicken and cooked the Orzo separately.

The soup was very good but too lemony and I love lemon, I would reduce the amount of fresh lemon juice, I squeezed lemons from our tree so it was very fresh, I did add extra vegi's to make more of a stew but will add more broth next time, 4 cups wasn't enough.

Love this soup. Sometimes I leave the chicken out but it tastes great either way. I make it regularly- leaving the orzo on the side to eat for lunch a few days in a row.

Very good. It seems to make a lot of broth for the amount of soup, so I cut down the broth and adjusted the lemon/salt accordingly to taste. I also kept the Orzo separate so that it wouldn't soak up all the broth (leftovers). It was a lovely soup, I'll make it again for sure.

It was a really good base recipe to follow for those looking for some loose guidelines. What I liked most about this recipe is it's spice profiles. I LOVE thyme and bay, and they really gave the soup a nice, fragrant taste and smell.  Personally, I found that this amount of lemon was overpowering, so I corrected by adding a bit more water and some chicken bouillon (I didn't buy any extra chicken broth). In addition, I really bulked up the veggies in this dish to make it a hearty, fulfilling soup.

I didn't care for this.  It was a bit bland for my taste.  I had to at least double the seasonings and added a lot of garlic powder.  The lemon was a nice touch though a bit more than suits my taste.  This may fade a bit as the soup sits overnight and is reheated.  Also, I thought it could use a little more vegetable to make it more substantial.  That however is an easy fix.

I have made this a couple of times and it light, clean and delicious.  The last time I made it with half the lemon juice and increased the chicken and cut size of vegetables.  My boys like it hearty.

Great flavor and texture. Made this as directed except I used precooked lemon chicken. Regarding the ‚Äúadding orzo before serving will make it a casserole‚Äù - that‚Äôs how I made it, with extra orzo, and the next day it was still a soup.

I picked the hottest day of the summer so far to make soup. 100 on a Sunday afternoon in mid July. But we've all been sick and I thought this might make us feel a little better. It taste amazing!! The lemon and the parm cheese put it over the top.

I love this soup.  The one change I made, I used my own chicken stock because it had more flavor.  It didn't let the lemon juice overpower it.  More of a balance in flavor.  Also, I didn't have any fresh parmesan on hand.  We didn't miss it.

Delicious soup! I changed the steps slightly by cooking the chicken breast before the veggies. Using the pot to make the soup, I seasoned and browned the chicken first then removed it to cool. Meanwhile I saut√©ed the veggies in the same pot to get all the little chicken bits and seasoning from the bottom of the pot (the caramelization from the chicken added a richer flavor to the soup). And I opted for 1/3 cup of lemon juice versus 1/2 cup (make it to your taste). Also I choose to add the orzo raw and cook it with the soup the last 14 minutes (time per the package directions). My family enjoyed this soup, I will definitely make it again!

This was really good. I added a little white wine and butter, which added some complexity. It was a nice change from your typical chicken soup and it made a ton‚Äîlots of leftovers for lunches or to freeze.

2/3/19:  This is fantastic!  It's basically chicken soup with garlic lemon orzo, lemon juice, and spinach added.  Instead of making traditional chicken soup the next time that I get sick, I'm making this.  It was great, even without the lemon zest!

Usually follow recipe to the letter, I thought I did until I re-read it to review. I was missing spinach (recall at grocery store)no orzo. I used Acini di Pepe, usually used in Italian Wedding soup. Reading other reviews I cut back on amount of spices and lemon juice. I should have followed the recipe. Mine was delicious but it could have been better had I followed the recipe. Will definitely make again.

This is delicious without any changes to the recipe.  The lemon gives the soup a bright flavor.  It makes a large amount, so I‚Äôll probably cut the recipe in half next time unless I have a crowd to feed.

I made this in my instant pot. I used a chicken breast I had previously grilled- and added all the ingredients except the herbs, spinach, and cheese. I added those ingredients afterwards. I cooked it for 7 minutes. Lovely soup for a cold evening!

Delicious, light and definitely one of the more healthy 
"comfort food'' recipes that I have ever made! I love the hint of citrus in every bite. After reading many reviews by those who made it, I also kept the Orzo in a a separate container so it didn't immediately soak up all the yummy broth. I have never had the Panera Bread version of this soup and I didn't think it even sounded that great but I had all the ingredients on hand, wanted to make something warm and comforting on a gloomy day @ the beach...I must say this is one of my new favorite things to eat now!!! Super easy and very tasty. I will make again.

It was SO Delicious!!!!  Made as written except I halved the recipe for hubby and me and used zest of half a lemon and used two tablespoons of lemon juice. The seasonings were perfect. Served it with a kale chopped salad. I separated the broth from the solids for storing the leftover soup to avoid the orzo soaking up the broth that other cooks wrote about. 
I‚Äôll definitely make it again. Looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow.

My family loves this soup. We prefer to serve it over a bit of jasmine rice rather than with orzo.  The recipe was doubled and doubled again to make enough.  I don't use the oregano or Parmesan.

Gluten-free version: I added wild and brown rice with the vegetables and did everything else the same. I also threw drumsticks or skinless boneless thighs into the broth. Each time it was a big hit! The pot is gone in one night. It‚Äôs a new family favorite!

We really enjoyed this.  I would never have thought to add lemon to a soup but it made it something special.  I forgot to add spinach the first time and remembered the second time.  
We liked it both ways.

I made a vegetarian version: the only changes were substituting the chicken broth for vegetable broth and tofu for chicken. It was still very good and I loved the zestiness that shone through.

Great!  Did not want pasta to take over soup - Pre cooked pasta and cooled, added to bowl desired amount and poured hot soup over and garnished with cheese.

Excellent! I did not add any lemon until serving time as my husband it not a huge fan; however I added lemon juice per my taste at the table and it was delish!

Amazing soup! Great just as it is with fresh ground pepper. Also freezes well if you leave the pasta out.

The flavor of this soup is phenomenal.  The orzo gets a little soft if you reheat the next day.  I think next time I will toast the orzo before hand to see if this helps.

Wonderful soup!  Sometimes use pasta instead of orzo because it holds up better for reheating. Otherwise keep the orzo out until serving.  Also I boil the chicken in bouillon to cook it and then use the bouillon water to cook the orzo/pasta.

Followed the recipe but added some corn and kale (instead of spinach) because that's what I had. I also like to finish it with an egg yolk at the end as it gives it a nice milky texture that's a little richer. Just temper an egg yolk with some broth before adding it to the pot so you don't get egg flower soup!

In general, I dislike reviews that say I made it except I used this and except that and in the end it's no where near the same recipe.  The only change I made was I was out of Orzo but had cheese tortellini.  Other than that I made it exactly as written.  EXCELLENT!  And I will make it again with Orzo.

We really liked this!  It is a great soup for those nights when you just need to get something on the table because everyone is starving.  I had some chicken already cooked so it was easy to just throw in with the other ingredients. I did kind of double up on the herbs just to make sure it had some good flavor and it was perfect.  I'd give it 5 stars except that I save that for those recipes that just make your eyes roll back into your head because they are so good.  This wasn't that but definitely tasty!

Really good. The whole family loved it. I had some leftovers roast chicken, so I used the carcass to make the chicken broth for this soup and saved the meat to add later. I didn't have any spinach, so I substituted some chopped kale, but added it to the soup earlier, when the broth came to the simmer. I used little less lemon juice, I wanted the flavor of it but not the sourness. And, I forgot to add the Parmesan cheese at the end, but  this soup was delicious even without.

This was so good, and so easy too, since I used leftover chicken.  I omitted the celery as I didn't have any on hand and didn't miss it.  Followed all other ingredients and it was perfect--very light and bright.  I plan on eating this over the next couple of days, so I followed another reviewer's advice and cooked and stored the orzo separately so it doesn't absorb all the broth.  Delicious, thanks!

I usually add lemon in my chicken soup, but we found this amount of lemon to be a bit overpowering for our taste. My husband won't eat spinach so I simply added other veggies like peas and beans and more carrots that he does eat. I gave the rest of the soup to my neighbors who raved how good it was. Definitely a matter of personal taste.

I seasoned a whole chicken very heavily inside and out with lemon pepper seasoning,  garlic powder, and some poultry seasoning , and a
little salt.  The first 20 min. I put it under the broiler to brown, covered, then slow roasted at 250 degrees for about 3 hrs.  It made a lot of broth and it fell apart. I removed the chicken and saved the breast for the soup. We ate the rest for another meal.
Then I sauteed all the veggies. I didn't have spinach to add, but I added the rest of the ingredients to the stock from the roasted chicken as well as 2-32oz. low sodium broth.  I added only about 1 cup of orzo as well as 1/2 cup of barley to cook right in the soup for the last half hour of cooking.
It was the most delicious soup ever!!!!

It isn't bad, it just wasn't to our liking. The lemon flavor was a to strong for our taste buds.  I will definitely be cutting back on the amount of lemon suggested. If you love lemon go for the full recipe, but if lemon is one of those flavors you prefer lighter in taste I suggest adding a little and increasing until it taste right to you.

My husband and I loved it. Did not use the garlic  and only put in a tiny bit of onion due to my husband's gastro issues.  Rather than adding already-cooked chicken, I added raw cut up boneless skinless thighs when I added the broth (we prefer dark meat).   Despite what others reviewers said about keeping the orzo separate, I added it to the soup.  Will try making it again but decreasing the lemon juice.

Very good! Followed recipe exactly. Thanks for sharing. UPDATE: I did the same as others and kept the pasta separate from broth for leftovers. When there was about half the soup left, I decided to add a can of cannellini beans instead of pasta. I much prefer the beans over the pasta. Healthier and more filling. Next time, I may try garbanzo beans. Base recipe is excellent though.

We loved this refreshing soup. I cooked the chicken in the broth with the veggies and spices to add more chicken flavor.  I didn't have orzo so I used a long grain/wild rice combo cooked separately and then added to each bowl of soup as desired. For us, adding the grated Parmesan (to taste) was a must, as it added a depth to the soup and pulled all the flavors together. We first tried it without the Parmesan and it was a little bland but, with it, the flavors were perfect. Husband said I can definitely make this again.

Yummy soup -- paired down the recipe since I'm making it for one.  Added fresh Thyme and flat leaf Parsley, used dried oregano since I had those on hand.  I thought the soup was somewhat disappointing until I added a touch more lemon juice, the bullion base as suggested and parm.  Wow.  That made all the difference.  Also, cooked (and kept) orzo separate for  leftovers.  This was easy to made and very comforting.

I made the recipe as-is but added a little more lemon to suit my taste.  As mentioned in another review, the orzo will soak up the soup. I split the soup into lunch serving sizes and found super large orzo. It was still very delicious and more like a hearty stew. Once it was all gone, I made more and added more spinach!  I definitely recommend this to any who loves lemon but of course, adjust it to your taste.

Great soup for my rotisserie chicken leftovers. I love the lemon and spice combo. I didn't have spinach so I used kale instead.

Doubled the amount of chicken and shredded it rather than cubed, otherwise followed as written.  Turned out great and will definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing.

This was a really nice soup!   It's super easy and easy to switch up if needed...for instance, I didn't have orzo so I used rice and I made it a one -pot soup by sauteing vegetables in the pot first, removing them and adding 4 raw chicken breasts with 8 c water + a bit more thyme, oregano, salt, pepper and garlic to the water (I didn't use chicken broth), cooking the chicken for about 30 min. til done.  Removed the chicken and added the rice to cook for 30 min and shredded the chicken, added it and the veg back to the pot along with about 6c of water and a bit more salt to taste.  Still turned out great and I didn't have but 2 things to wash.

I also made the whole wheat beer bread along with this and it too was really great with the soup!  

Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I can honestly say that this is one of them best meals I‚Äôve ever had in my life!!! If you really want to have a special dinner for a birthday or a party this would be fantastic. And like everybody else we left the orzo on the side. Also seasoning the chicken with rotisserie seasoning is fantastic. Our whole family love this meal and we would totally make it again!!! I suggest that you make this recipe because it is amazing once again. I will be making this sometime very very soon!

This soup has a nice flavor.  I didn‚Äôt follow instructions 100%.  I cooked chicken breast same time as veggies.  I did not cook orzo separate either & through in soup last 10 minutes same time as lemon juice & zest.  The spinach was a nice added touch.

This soup was AWESOME!  
Perfect as written, the only very small change I did was not add the Orzo noodles to the main pot. I cooked them separate then added them in each individual bowls when ready to serve.

Hands down the best chicken noodle soup I've ever had.  I eliminated the thyme because I don't like it but otherwise followed the recipe.  My husband said he wants me to make it this way all of the time.  A winner!

This was such a great soup people in my house had multiple bowls who don‚Äôt even like soup. I would swap the spinach for kale. Kale is more hearty and doesn‚Äôt become slimy. I did add a little red chili pepper flakes to my liking for a little kick. I‚Äôll definitely make again.

I am completely addicted to this soup. I make it 2-3 times a month and everyone who tries is asks me for the recipe... I always leave the celery out and add extra carrots and spinach along with some Parmesan cheese and it's WONDERFUL. I made the mistake of using organic chicken broth once and it almost ruined it.

This is a delicious soup. I substituted a cup (uncooked ) of brown rice for the orzo and made sure to chop up everything very small (texture counts!). I didn't have lemon zest, but it tasted great even without it. I also added in some lemon pepper last minute (1/2 tsp or so) which seemed to do it some good. A great change from the classic chicken noodle soup. And if chicken soup is good for a cold, then adding lemon makes it ultimate medicine.

I never had the original Panera's soup so I can't compare it with it but it sure was tasty! Very refreshing. I made it for lunch and dinner so I didn't add orzo in the pot but cooked it al dente, drained it and finished it cooking with some broth from the soup in a separate pot so it'd absorb more flavor. Thanks!

This is the best chicken soup I've ever made! The lemon makes it so much more interesting. Plus the lemon is great if you are under the weather.  I've made it for sick friends, and they love it. It's really easy, fast, and healthy. I have used quinoa instead of orzo to make it a little healthier (more protein, less carbs) and it's still delicious. You don't have to store the quinoa separately like you do the orzo.

Excellent soup!  Only changes I made is because of what I had on hand.  Used yellow squash and kale. I sauteed these with other vegetables.  Once broth at a boil, I added uncooked orzo.
The broth is perfect, and I will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe as originally written.  It has a very strong lemon flavor, but I love lemon so it was not a problem for me. If you are not a fan of  lemon, I would suggest that you cut back on the amount of lemon juice and concentrate more on the flavors of Thyme and Oregano.  This recipe is a keeper in my recipe box!!

I used herbs de Provence instead of thyme, oregano and bay leaf. A bit too strong on the lemon for my taste. I might use just a quarter cup of the lemon juice and half  the zest next time. Overall very tasty!

This soup was a success with everybody. I did as other reviewers and kept the orzo separate. I think that works better. I will add more chicken next time and a little more spices. It is superb for cold winter nights and fighting off colds. The orzo makes it more filling so you don't really need add ons like salad or bread although they are nice.

Great recipe! used stock instead of broth and accidentally doubled the chicken but it turned out to be a happy mistake. It was not too much chicken. Made a TON of servings. This will be a fall/winter staple soup. Perfect for when you have a cold, too. And it gets even better the next day.

The perfect soup to fight the flu!Nice strong lemon flavour. Proportions are great I just made the following changes: cooked orzo in broth, used a bunch of parsley and a little spinach, much less chicken, used 4 large cloves or garlic instead of 2, added a 1/3 tsp harrissa arbi -- better kick! (Used 4 chicken stock cubes and totally maxed my 2 handle pot). Sooooo yummy!

Absolutely delicious! I made my own chicken stock using the carcass from a Costco rotisserie chicken, and used that in place of the broth. Other than that, and halving the recipe, I kept everything else the same. I loved the slight hint of lemon, and it just added a freshness to the whole soup. My husband loved it too! Thanks, Renee, for this wonderful recipe!

I  used 2 bags of crumbled cauliflower instead of orzo to keep the carbs low. I didn't have any lemons to zest so I just used lemon juice. The family loved it! I would have loved more lemon flavor so I will be sure to use an actual lemon next time for the zest! I would also recommend tearing or cutting the spinach leaves so they are easier to eat and not dangling from the spoon...

Super easy and very tasty. I used more chicken than the recipe called for.  I ended up throwing a few chicken breasts in my crock pot on low for  8 hours. When they were done I took them out and shredded the chicken. I also (like other reviewers) kept my orzo separate so it did not soak up all of the broth.

Delicious but no celery for me. Instead I chopped up one bunch of Bok Choy. There is a similar recipe using this type of Chinese cabbage but the Orzo and lemon is what made me try this recipe. I'm on a low sodium diet. I didn't use any salt in this soup. Veggies are enough . I then seasoned with spices in recipe. Be sure to use just the  white part of Bok choy chopped with carrots then add leafy part chopped with spinach at the end. Great alternative! Will make again.

Delicious!  I sought out a recipe for lemon chicken orzo soup after eating it almost daily from Panera when they had it!  I'm so glad this was replicated so well, definitely fulfilled my craving!  I made a huge batch and was able to freeze some for later too.  I did follow other suggestions and kept the orzo separate so it didn't absorb all the broth... Will be making another big batch soon!  Thank you thank you thank you!

This recipe was fantastic. I loved the orzo and spinach. I found that it did not require as much broth as called for so I used only 2 cartons and cut the salt and lemon juice in half. I didn't have a lemon so I used bottled lemon juice and it tasted fine. Another time I used fresh lemon and I felt that the lemon flavor over-powered the soup, so I will continue to use bottled lemon juice.

I made this to be my lunches for the week. I kept to the recipe except I used fresh herbs from the garden and skipped the spinach (didn't have any). I was a little iffy about the lemon juice and zest, but decided to go for it. It adds a really nice flavor to the broth. I am looking forward to my lunches this week!

I can't say I've followed this exact recipe (because I measure nothing, EVER), but I've made my own version of Panera's Lemon Chicken Orzo before and these are exactly the same ingredients I've used and it is always delicious!

Just wanted to agree with some of the other reviewers -- add the lemon to taste, and although I've used cooked chicken breast, this soup is also wonderful  (and more flavorful, I think) using skinless bone-in chicken thighs cooked right in the broth.  Obviously that will add some fat and calories (!) but it adds a nice depth as well.

This soup is easy to make and very tasty.  That lemon juice gives it just a little tang.  It also freezes well.  Whenever I don't feel like cooking and want something healthy but filling, I get a small batch out of the freezer.  Only one recommendation: there's a lot of orzo, which makes it pretty thick.  I think next time I make I will cut back just a little on the orzo.  Still delicious!

I never thought I would like chicken soup with lemon but this is delicious. My husband said he would love to have it again, high praise. I think the orzo really made it special. I did add a beaten egg to the broth since so many similar recipes suggested it. Will make again!

I will make this again.  I swapped out the orzo for quinoa to give it a health boost.  I also added 1/2 cup of skim milked mixed with two tablespoons of flour to thicken it up slightly.  Very nice, refreshing - a great soup for spring.  My teenager loved it also.  She's big into anything flavored with lemon.  The lemon flavor isn't overwhelming, just a bit.  One tip - I cook and puree' cauliflower and then slip it into every soup I make.  (Just do an entire head of cauliflower and puree and freeze in ice cube trays.  Add 2 or 3 cubes to any soup.)  Adds to the nutritional value.  I did it in this recipe too - no one knew.  :)

Loved this soup and will certainly make it again.  I poached the chicken breast in vegetable broth and used this cooking broth to the soup.  I cooked the orzo and kept it stored separately and used it as I needed when heating the soup.  Next time I make it I will try to freeze some.  It was so good, we ate it all before I got a chance to save some.

This is a wonderfully flavorful and healthy soup, which I have made twice in the last week. I did use just 1/3 cup lemon juice the second time as I thought it was a bit too lemony & made the orzo separate since some are on low carb diets.  Not much salt is needed since the lemon gives lots of flavor.

I added a large raw boneless, skinless chicken breast to the broth and brought it up to a boil. Then I covered and simmered it for ten minutes. Removed the chicken, shredded it with two forks and placed it back in the pot. Finished the soup by adding the lemon zest and lemon juice. Outstanding!!!

Really nice. I added a rosemary sprig & 2 bay leaves 10 minutes before it was finished and it made it even nicer. I also used pork rather than chicken because that's what I had. Really nice soup.

Super quick if you change up a few things.  Used all ingredients as called for except for the orzo since I did not have that on hand.  Used a very , very small pasta that cooks quickly.  When the veggies  were all saut√©ed, added garlic and spices. Then added the raw chopped chicken pieces and cooked until they were white on the outside.  Then added the broth and brought to a boil.  The chicken was actually cooked by then.   Added the small pieces of pasta which only took minutes to be cooked on high and then lowered to a simmer to finish off the veggies.   I added the spinach before serving the soup.  I forgot about the cheese.  We do have leftovers and I will serve it with cheese tomorrow.  Can only make a great soup even better!  Thanks submitter.

We loved this soup.I had leftover rotisserie chicken which I shredded.  Another review suggested keeping the orzo and soup separate because the orzo would absorb all the broth. I put cooked orzo in bowl, then added the soup. 

I also added 1 egg, but you could add 2. Whisk the eggs and lemon juice until smooth. Slowly ladle about 1 cup of the hot broth into the egg-lemon mixture and whisk to combine. I added one more cup of broth to the mixture before adding it to the soup. Stir and the soup turns opaque and thickens. Season with black pepper.

What a nice recipe for an old fashion soup. I did use the lemon as suggested and it sure made a difference in the taste.  I did not use the cheese. Using the lemon took the place of using too much salt, great recipe.

Made it according to recipe but , like other cooks, cooked the orzo separately so as not to absorb all the liquid. Everyone who ate it loved it. It's the lemon that makes it so good

This soup is wonderful!  I'm always looking for recipes that call for fresh lemon as I have a nicely producing lemon tree in my backyard.  Made the recipe exactly as written.  Cured me of a nasty cold and contributed to a 3 lb weight loss for the week that I ate it every day for lunch.  An all around winner!

My guests loved it and asked for the recipe.  It  had a slight bitter taste to me though.  It could be because I used bottled lemon juice and not fresh squeezed.  Was good but didn't taste as good as Panera.

Delicious and easy to make. Just the right amount of lemon.  I will add a little more chicken the next time I make it.

This was very tasty and a nice alternative for chicken noodle soup. I made this according to the recipe, except for doubling the chicken. I don't often cook with lemon and found the 1/2 cup to be just right. (1 large lemon). It was flavorful, but not sour. This is a new favorite.

I boiled the chicken first with salt, pepper, garlic and some chicken base.  I split the broth tossing the fat and added it to the finished soup. Otherwise it would've been too dense. Turned out great!

This soup was great!  I used leftover lemon herb chicken and doubled the orzo, and increased the garlic, but that was about it!  Great!

This recipe was a great, easy option for a light but comforting dinner. I did not have thyme so used rosemary and some italian seasonings instead. Also, I used a mix of chicken broth and vegetable broth and substituted egg noodles because those are what I had on hand. The flavors developed throughout the day and I had to add some fresh salt and pepper later when we ate it for dinner. It was delicious and hearty without being complicated or heavy. Win!

Made this as my husband and I were sick and it was an excellent pick-me-up. The comfort of chicken noodle with the brightness of the lemon made it perfect, it will be my new go to.

This was a great recipe! It truly tastes like the kind you can get from Panera!   The specific herbs give a nice and unique taste! I followed other reviewers and kept the orzo separate from the the soup since I was planning on keeping some in the fridge for lunch during the week. I also used a little more chicken then was noted because there is a lot of broth. I baked the chicken in the oven before adding to the soup. Very delicious!!

So easy and quick.  I didn't have leftover chicken so I threw some  chicken in with the orzo while it was cooking .  That made a little "real" chicken broth to add to the canned and gave a little extra flavor to the orzo.

Sooooo good. Didnt change anything except for maybe cutting up more veggies and adding more orzo since my boyfriend isnt a fan of brothy soups. He really isnt a fan of soups at all and we have made this twice in 4 days it was so good

This is much better than at the restaurant it is imitating!!! I make enough for 12 servings and I leave the orzo to the side.  I add just enough orzo and cooked spinach to each bowl before serving. I NEVER have any of this soup go to waste!! Absolutely LOVE IT!!!

After having this soup at panera I had to make some. This recipe was perfect. I made it for 8 servings. I cut it down to one larger carrot and no celery. Also I forgot the lemon zest but I used lemon pepper rotisserie chicken so I think it ended up still tasting very lemony. I'm glad I read the comments about keeping the orzo on the side.

What a great summer soup.  I had some leftover smoked turkey in the refrigerator so used that instead of the chicken and it was amazing!  I can always count on AllRecipes for great ideas and the recipes are so wonderful.  Thanks.

Can't get enough of this soup!  Probably didn't use quite as much orzo as recommended because it soaks up the broth. Love the spinach in it!

I never write reviews, but this recipe absolutely deserves it.  It was fantastic!!! Maybe the best soup I have ever made. I cut the recipe by half, and will never do that again...everyone wanted more.  Thank you so much for my (now)go-to chicken soup recipe!

This soup is amazing!    I have made tons of different soups and this one really fits the bill for my lemon-loving family!    Half of my family is sick tonight so I thought I'd step up and add more lemon (1 cup instead of 1/2 cup), garlic and a little lemon EO to this recipe and it was amazing!  Everyone loved it and I hope it makes them better!

Quick & easy recipe- I  used stock that I made  from a rotisserie chicken - followed the recipe with exception of added kale in place of spinach & Didn't use any cheese - thought it was flavorful enough without it! Will definitely put this recipe into my go-to soups for fall / winter

It's true you must be a lemon lover to truly enjoy this soup but since I certainly am I thought this soup was wonderful!

Way Too Lemony!  I had a version at a restaurant and was anxious to try it.  It was very tasty, but I would also Cut the Lemon to 1/4 cup or less and skip the zest!  If you love lemon, you will love this!

This is exactly like Panera Bread's soup.  Made with no modifications and absolutely delicious.  Made enough for left overs except there aren't any.  lol

Had this at Panera for lunch last week. Next day it was all I could think about so I thought why not try to make it? I had all the ingredients except celery since I don't like celery! I have to say this is the best soup I have ever tasted. It's so good that my husband who doesn't really like soup LOVED this and had seconds. I myself have been eating it almost every day for a week and it is still fabulous. I would not hesitate to serve this to company with a good tossed salad and some nice crusty French bread.

This is a perfectly delicious soup and one of the few that doesn't leave the vegetables in a mush! One tweak: use 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil not one teaspoon. Also I omitted the lemon zest because I don't have a good grater and after tasting the soup I would continue to omit it. The lemon juice is all the lemon you need. I didn't garnish the soup so I can't rate that part.

This is good chicken soup with a lemony taste.  Not too different to turn off picky eaters.

Loved it! The lemon made it so bright!  We like our meat so I would double the chicken.

A little too lemony for my husband, and in leftovers too lemony for me. So I cut the lemon by 1/2. Spinach in it is the only way I can get Hubby to eat spinach. Otherwise, really good--and I use this as the base now for all of my chicken soups, including chicken and noodle.

I really loved this soup. The broth was outrageous! So refreshing and different! I used cooked chicken breast because it was what I had on hand. I would highly recommend chicken thighs for the tenderness of the chicken though. I'm not sure if store bought rotisserie chicken is as tender. I also made my own chicken stock. I did keep the orzo separate and added it to the bowls because I did plan on having leftovers and didn't want to lose all that delicious lemony broth. I'm a huge garlic fan so I did use 4 cloves of garlic for a more robust flavor. The lemon was still the more prevalent flavor. I also added the spinach at the plating stage with the parmesan cheese. So delicious. It is definitely on my list of favorite soup recipes. Thank you so much for sharing!

I cooked this receipe as written.  This  will be my go to soup for chicken from now on.  I didn't have any orzo so I substituted some cooked rice I had in the fridge.  Excellent. The lemon wakes up you taste buds.  Yummy

Great soup for a snowy day!  I added extra onion, celery, carrot and garlic, also some grated ginger and star anise for additional flavor.  I toasted the orzo in olive oil in a separate pan before adding it to the soup - it gives the orzo a nuttier flavor.  I had on hand a bag of baby greens - spinach, bok choy and chard which I chopped and added at the last minute.  The soup turned out great - now I wish I'd doubled the recipe.

using the correct chicken stock is the key here.
