I used this recipe to make a collection of different hot chocolates in a Christmas present I gave out to all my friends and family. This one was by far everyone's favorite blend. The drink is smooth, minus the orange zest chunks.  The flavor is rich. I used a combination of dark chocolate and regular chocolate powder, Yummy.

I made this mix for my daughter for Christmas who LOVES hot cocoa!  She was pleasantly surprised at the myriad of flavors!  I did have some trouble finding ground anise, so I bought whole seed and ground it myself!  Thank you so much for the recipe!

This was just what I was looking for.  It's hot chocolate, but with a little bit of extra winter spice.  I used less than 2 cups powdered sugar, and honestly I didn't need to add any more.  I think adding the full amount of sugar would have made it too sweet.
