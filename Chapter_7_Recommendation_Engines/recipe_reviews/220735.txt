This was really easy to make! The only thing I changed was that I used chickpea flour instead of regular flour to make this gluten free. I think next time I might use garlic powder instead of chopped garlic as I didn't enjoy the garlic not being more evenly spread in flavour; some bites were more garlicky than others. But otherwise, perfect! It even smelled like the falafel I've eaten in shops. Thank you!

I fried these on my vegetable oil sprayed griddle. I used buckwheat flour to make an interesting tasting version of this.  It's a great simple meal when combined with some veggies!

This was basic and came out just fine.  It went together very easily in the food processor and was quick enough to make after work. I made it to use fresh herbs and top with cucumbers and tomatoes from the garden. Will make again. After making this a few times, I think it works better with soaked dried beans--don't cook them-use them just soaked.  It isn't so wet.

My husband loves this and asks me to make it every week! I follow it exactly. Top it over some spinach and fresh veggies, or throw it in a wrap.
