This recipe is a keeper.  I am not a big venison eater, but my kids and husband are.  I even ate this meal.  It was tender and tasted great.  It tasted like barbaqued spare ribs!!!  I will keep this recipe on hand and use it again.  I did not find just a chile-garlic sauce, so I used Cholula chile-garlic sauce.  The sauce and the meat had a zing to it.  I did not cook the onion and garlic before hand.  I put everything in the crock pot and it sat overnight in the fridge.  I cooked it on low all day.  I then made some rice and served the meat and sauce over the rice.  It was a very tasty meal.

I have been eating and cooking venison my whole life. This is my favorite preparation! I swapped a tablespoon of Worchestershire for the liquid smoke, added a julienned green pepper toward the end of cooking time, and served it over rice. I will make this again and again.

Great!  I cut out the liquid smoke (not a fan) but it turned out fantastic.  The meat fell apart as I was taking it out of the crock pot.  I used the leftovers for pulled venison tacos and it was fab!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good recipe. I replaced the liquid smoke with more Worchestershire sauce. Also, I cooked the roast on low for almost 5 hours and it was a little overdone. I will check the roast temp more closely next time and will probably stop closer to 4 hours. I'm not a big venison lover, but my husband is. This recipe made vension very enjoyable for me and my husband loved it. Thanks.

The favors are STRONG! This is a good recipe if you need to cover the taste of venison that wasn't properly cared for in the field or is getting old.

Awesome! Easy to make and the whole family loved it, even the kids! I didn't have any chile-garlic sauce so I used asian sweet chili sauce instead! Turned out GREAT!

We LOVE this recipe but chose to use 1 or 2 TB of green jalapeno tabasco instead of the chili sauce.  WONDERFUL!

I give this recipe one star for originality. Unfortunately this recipe is sooooo spicey that my mouth is still burning 30 minute after ingesting it. I even cut back on the recipes spicey ingredients, I can only imagine if I hadn't.

This recipe was a HUGE hit in my house.  My in-laws ate with us and have been begging for the recipe.  So glad to have another way to cook all the deer meat in our freezer!

It was a little spicy for my liking and the meat was a bit dry as venison usually is. It was ok but not something I'll rush to make again.

The only reason i'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that I had to substitute steak sauce for the chili-garlic sauce (added some chili powder) and the worcestershire sauce. But it still turned out great. I hope to try it again with the right list of ingredients next time. My husband loved it. We even used the left over cut up into strips with a little taco sauce and green pepper as fajitas the next night. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent and easy recipe. If you enjoy spicy foods, this has just the right amount of heat (it won't burn you). If you can't do spice, just back off of the chile-garlic (sriracha is what I used.) I highly recommend.

My husband loved this recipe.  Will probably use a little less pepper next time but mainly cause I'm pregnant.

This one is a keeper! My entire family loved this and I will definitely be making this in the future. I didn't have garlic or onions so I used onion and garlic powder instead.

I really liked this.  I like heat though.  I think those who don't care for spicy heat they should cut the sirachi sauce down.  I did sprinkle a little brown sugar in the sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

The venison turned out great, but it was much too spicy.  I would suggest cutting back on the chile-garlic sauce.

This recipe is great around hunting season! The only thing that should be changed is the first step, its backwards. Sear your roast in the hot pan with olive oil, place in warm slow cooker. In the same pan you just seared the roast in brown the onion and garlic (dont wash the pan, use that flavor left behind by the roast!) You can also add your liquid ingredients and spices to the pan to warm and mix them while capturing the flavors left behind from the roast.

I like this.  It was a tad spicy for my kids (so next time I would maybe cut the chili sauce in half) Meat was very tender and the sauce had a really good flavor. Will repeat

Tasty!  There was no bad, strong odor in my opinion.  My man was so impressed being that I am a beginner AND have never cooked venison.  BUT DO leave it in the slow cooker long enough so it gets nice and tender.  4 1/2 hrs on low was not long enough for mine... had to throw it back in for a while longer.  Served it on top of some couscous and it was wonderful.

We are not big venison fans but had to use up the meat (The hunters who hunt on our property give it to us as a thank you gift) and i has a huge bag of venison chunks. First I made Tailgater Hellfire Chilli (also from this site) substituting the meat for chopped venison. That turned out awesome but I still had more than half a bag of the chunks that I didn’t know what to do with. So I threw them in the slow cooker with two large onions, added your sauce and started things up. After it was cooked I shredded the meat and added some flour to the sauce to thicken it to a nice gravy. It made absolutely delicious hot venison sandwiches. Still lots left so tomorrow night I might try it on a baked sweet potato. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a huge hit!  Used chipotle chili sauce too. No gamey taste. And super easy to make.

Made this today with a 5 lb. Venison rump roast, so doubled the sauce.  I used chili sauce instead of ketchup, as I wanted to use what I already had in my pantry.  I did add 1/2 cup brown sugar to mellow the heat a tad!   I cooked in oven at 250 degrees several hours,  than made a fantastic gravy with all of that delicious sauce.  Definetly make this again for company!  (Should I be so lucky as to get another beautiful roast out of my boss next hunting season!)

This was excellent and quite spicy.  Personally I would cut back on the garlic-chile sauce but it's personal preference.  Some loved the heat, others requested it be cut back next time.  Overall very easy and delicious!

We were given deer meat and I've never cooked it and when I have eaten it before haven't cared for it. This recipe was perfect and tasted nothing like what I've eaten in the past. Kinda reminds me of beef tips. We served it over rice and it was so tender and delicious! My sister-in-law that said she doesn't eat deer meat even ate it and loved it.

From what I learned by reading the reviews, I let the venison marinate in the sauce for a couple hours since I didn't have all night. Added about 6 oz of bacon towards the end because I was afraid of it drying out. It was probably a 2 pound ham, larger than called for.  I did not add any liquid smoke since I don't like it.  And also I cooked it for about an hour to an hour and a half longer than called for. I stuffed the meat into burritos and it tasted liked like heaven it was so good. Now I'm going to have to send my husband with our hunting friend so we can have venison burritos more often. Thank you so much for spending all those years perfecting an awesome recipe!
