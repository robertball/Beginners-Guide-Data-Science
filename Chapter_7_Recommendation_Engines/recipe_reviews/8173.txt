My family has also been making this for years!  One tip: recently I made this with non-fat sweetened condensed milk and it took 5 days to set properly.  Still tastes good, but if you want it to set in a reasonable amount of time, you must use the regular version.

This is absolutely the best cheesecake in the world.  My family fights over it.  We used to save it for special occasions but now we make it year round.  I will say to all of you who think you can get by without 1/3 cup of lemon juice, you're wrong.  That's what makes the pie set and remain firm.  You must add all of it.

I'm baffled as to why this doesn't work out for some people.I made 5 of  these for a potluck dinner (I was resposible for bringing all the dessert) and I needed something very quick and very easy to throw together.  I bought pre made graham cracker crusts,and a few different varieties of toppings, and was able to whip this up in batches in my food processor in about 20 minutes.  I stuck them in the fridge for about 12 hours, and I had a dessert that everybody thought I  slaved over and looked and tasted great! I'm wondering if people may have decreased the lemon juice. This is an integral part to the taste and the consistency of this cheesecake. It takes care of that sweetened condensed milk taste too!!  Anyway, thanks LJ for an easy dessert!

This recipe for cheesecake is pretty good, it's quick and easy, however you want want to hold the condense milk though, the cheesecake turned out to be very sweet and might not suit the taste suits of the older people. I used more "light" cheese and less condense milk instead, to reduce the sweetness of the cake.

This is such a delightful recipe.it does take the cheesecake alot  of hours to firm up.But what i did to give if more of a cheesecake taste was to add about 1/2 of another 8oz of cream cheese to it and it also help it to firm up more,even though i left it in the refrigerator overnight yummy yummy cheesecake.This sort of have a keylime taste to it but all in all it's delicious.I have many this cheesecake numerous time for many many people.

This is the only cheesecake my husband will eat.  I have been making this for him for years.  The only problem with this recipe is that I have to make this when he is not home,because like a child he can not wait until it sets. (Ha-Ha)  Tip: Do not try to use already softened cream cheese,be patient & wait for the pkg to soften.  As I have tried this in a hurry & the pie does not set up well.

I use this recipe all the time but I NEVER just place it in the fridge. If you want the professional look bake your cake for about 1 hour at 375 degrees (or until it turns a light brown). Let cool for about 20 minutes before putting on the topping and then place in the fridge to cool. Comes out perfect everytime! and it only takes about 2 hours.

An excellent cheesecake!  Best if eaten a couple of days after making, so that the flavours of the ingredients have a chance to blend properly.

Despite everyone else either loving or hating it, I'm giving this one 3 stars. I agree with those who say it tastes great but, also with those who found it didn't set. I even tried decreasing the condenced milk, and increasing the cheese content (needs some kind of  thickening agent?). 

If you don't care what it looks like, but want an authentic taste that's easy to make then go for it. if, on the other hand, you want to wow dinner guests with a professional looking dish don't bother.

After 2 days it was still runny and the condensed milk taste was too strong. Nobody who tried it liked it.

This was not for us. Though it set up, it was still quite "wobbly" and the flavor was a bit odd. It wasn't our favorite cheesecake. I'm not a cheesecake novice, I followed the recipe exact. I won't make this again.

This is the easiest cheesecake recipe ever. I don't usually put lemon juice in it. I often replace the cherry pie filling with mango pulp (found at East Indian stores. It makes it more exotic.

I have been making a cheesecake that is similar to this for years and it is my absolute favorite dessert ever.  For my version I use 3 (8 oz.) packages of cream cheese, 1 (14 oz.) can sweetened condensed milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Lemon juice is optional.  If I use the lemon juice, I only use 1 or 2 teaspoons.  I have had no problems with this version "setting up" or being "goopy".  This may be due to the extra cream cheese and reduced quantity of lemon juice.

Tips for a perfect turnout! Okay, So I have been using this recipe for a few years now(thanks to Eagle Brand Condensed milk. This is a great recipe and very simple, however there are a few variables that could turn this into a permanent runny mess! 

1. Lemon Juice is a MUST as it is the "hardening" agent in this recipe or rather the citric. The Citric in the lemon juice combined with most condensed milk will have a thickening effect when left standing and chilled. Usually 1/3cup is the least amount needed to achieve this however 1/4cup is the safest route if you are unsure. (Time is also a factor so using a  mixer to blend this as WELL and quickly as possible will help as thickening begins quickly, so mixing will counteract this) 

2. The cream cheese simply says softened, This should translate to "room temperature" or heated for at least 20 seconds or long enough to make it smooth when mixing and not thick and sticky. (I noticed that though heating works, leaving out for 30 minutes at room temperature works best. This would be because it evenly whips it and spreads it thoroughly. 

Last from personal experience, It seems the chilling/refrigerating is what aids the most with the citric and condensed milk thickening and using a cold base (like chilled cream cheese) to start prevents this all together. Not sure why but this always seems to be the deciding factor in whether this recipe turns out well or not. 

Hope this helps!

Wow, I am so confused! So many 5 stars were given to this recipe and I can honestly say after following the simple steps, and then refrigerated this for well over the instructed time, the pie/cake was runny like soup and tasted way too strong of a vanilla flavor. So disappointed, I made this for my husband’s birthday as cherry cheesecake is his favorite and I felt horrible as he grinned and did his best to smile despite his (and my children’s') obvious dislike of the pie. (For anyone wondering, I followed the directions exactly! I used the exact ingredients and followed the directions precisely. No corners were cut, no substitutions were made.) If you love New York style cheesecake, you will be disappointed with this pudding pie.

This is my husband's ABSOLUTE FAVORITE cheesecake recipe.  Despite the many cheesecake recipes he has tried, this one "takes the cake"! ;) .  It's actually quite a relief that this cheesecake recipe is so popular in our house, because it's probably the easiest recipe out there.  Be sure when you make it not to over-beat your mixture, because that might make it too "soupy".  We really like raspberry filling on top when we can find it.  This is the only cheesecake recipe that has found it's "trophy spot" in my recipe book... it's a DEFINITE keeper!  

(NOTE: To all those who think that putting less lemon juice in is the answer to a "thicker" filling... NOT TRUE!  One time I accidentally forgot to put lemon juice in it, and the filling was soupier than pudding... even after a FULL DAY of chilling! Lemon juice is the key.)

Simple and delicious.  Most reviewers had a problem with setting.  Since I've never made cheese cake, I pulled up a lot of different recipes to compare.  Try using a little bit more cream cheese; about 1/4 pkg more, leaving everything else the same.  Comes out perfect!  I used a fresh squeezed lemon, which gave it a little more punch.  The second time around, I added 1/2 tsp Knox clear jello to the lemon juice, let it gel for about a minute and it started to set within minutes.

There are SO many almost identical cherry cream cheese pie recipes out there! I followed this one and turned them into individual cheesecake tarts. Didn't hv a graham crust so I made my own cookie base crust and baked it for 5-10 min before topping up with this cream cheese recipe. Into the oven again for about 20 min to firm before putting in the fridge...perfectly set in an hour:) It was yummy but really really rich, I liked the tartness of the lemon juice and added the zest as well. Left some plain and filled some with melted milk chocholate- wow!!! decadent and super sweet. I ate 2 in one go and almost O-D ed. The next day, I cut up some yellow kiwifruit to arrange on top, but somehow it didn't go as well...best is still plain. Lemon cheesecake is still tops. Good recipe though, very easy to follow.

First of all this is not cheese cake, this is a cream cheese pie. I have been making this for years, as did my Mother. It's quick and easy, kid's love it. If you have a problem with it setting, try adjusting the amount of lemon juice. Cheese is a milk product and it is the lemon juice that makes it thicken you may need to adjust the amount of lemon juice, some lemons have more juice than others, also pre squeezed juice does not work as well. Another tip, it may sound gross, but DON'T lick the spoon and put it back in the batter! You have enzymes in your saliva that BREAK DOWN the batter! Most won't claim to do this but on refrigerated non cook batters and puddings it can happen. It is a tried and true old recipe that is really hard to mess up. Stick to the basics and your family will love it!

Don't expect this to taste like traditional cheesecake. My grandmother made this every Thanksgiving, and it's one of my all-time favorites. Very sweet and tart. Having grown up with this, I was disappointed the first time I tasted traditional cheesecake. It's very easy. Make sure you're using SWEETENED CONDENSED milk, not evaporated.

I made this the other day and I substituted fat free cream cheese and fat free sweet and condensed milk. And I used a reduced fat and calorie gram cracker pre made crust. I baked it for 25 min. at 325 and it was perfect not runny at all:)The pieces came out wonderfully. My husband didn't even know the difference!! Then I toppped it with the splenda sweetened canned cherries. Although the sweet and condensed milk is not sugar free it still is a much healthier tasty treat your fam will love...when you bake the pie the result and texture is that of a traditional cheesecake:)

I am very disappointed... I've waited more than 24 hours to find out that this was still going to stay runny, and I don't understand why so lemony. I totally made an mistake giving in to this recipe and all the positive feedback.

My family definitely prefers this no egg no bake version.  My mother has been making this for over 30 years and has come out perfect everytime. No changes. My teenage son loves it and has never found any cheesecake that beats it.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was very disappointing.  It tasted OK, but it really never set.  I had it chilled overnight.  I was extra disappointed because this recipe received so many five star reviews.  I will never make this again.

More than 48 hours later and it's still like pudding instead of firming up to the point where it could be sliced. It also tasted strongly of the condensed milk. I love cheesecake in its many forms, but this was a disappointment all the way around.

Tradition in husband's family, and they all liked this version.  Theirs usually has whipped cream on top, though.  Doubled recipe to make a 9x13 pan.  Expensive to make.

This was exactly what I was looking for when I wanted to make cheesecake for a family get together. and I'm pretty picky with my cheesecake. It wasn't overpoweringly sweet, but it definitely wasn't bland by any means! The only thing I'd say is that next time I would soften my cream cheese a little more because there were some little chunks, so the texture was off a tiny bit, but it was still good! I made them into 6 little mini cheesecakes, so everyone enjoyed their own little cheesecake :)

Very good!  I thought it was too sweet to start, I used 2 packs of cream cheese and added about 3/4 cup sour cream and beat it in my mixer for a good 5 minutes.  I used fresh squeezed lemon juice and I used very finely grated lemon zest in it too.  In the end it was wonderfully light and fluffy and just the right sweetness and solidness, and I had more filling than would fit in my shell so I could let everyone have a spoon full while the rest of the pie sat and waited for after dinner.

My entire family loves this cheesecake! We vary the fruit, or use none at all. You must use "real" condensed milk and cream cheese along with the exact amount of fresh lemon juice. The bottled lemon juice won't work. I hate to be gross here, but some people don't know about contamination. I am finicky about people sticking their fingers in the mixing bowl and no one licks off a spoon and sticks it back in again! If you contaminate any recipe you ruin it and one like this will not set!

OK here's how I rated.
Quick and Easy: Five stars
Appearance: Four star (I was able to have it stick together fairly well.  I beat it a very long time to help it thicken and I added my can of fruit only after my filling had set and I refrigerated my can of fruit to have it thick.)
Taste: Two stars.  It didn't taste bad but it was way too rich.  Everybody agreed that no one would ever go for a second piece and no one could finish their piece (not even kids).  

I WILL NOT MAKE IT AGAIN.  I'd rather put in more work and have a delicious turn out.  I was disappointed.

This recipe is pretty good, however my pie wasn't set even after being in the fridge for 24 hours. I took the advice of another reviewer and baked at 350 for 35 minutes...this was perfect afterwards.  Set nicely and tasted wonderful.  Definitely not a traditional cheesecake but I think I might like this better.  I added fresh strawberries to mine and it is disappearing quickly!!!

I have been searching for a soft cheesecake recipe like this forever. Awesome! Do not mistake this recipe for New York cheesecake! I followed the recipe to the letter, then doubled it. It set NO problem almost instantly. It came out perfectly, I used a 9" spring form pan and lined it with lady fingers instead of the usual graham cracker crust and it looked as beautiful as it tasted. It was sooo easy. Great recipe, didn't taste too lemony, and had just the right sweetness. Got compliments all night. Can't wait to make it again :)

Like so many others, I too had trouble getting the filling to thicken up to the proper consistency to hold its shape. So what I did was freeze it without the cherry topping, and spoon the refrigerated cherry filling over the slices, which I dubbed, "Frozen Cherry Cheesecake." Flavor was quite good, consistency was perfect, and it was a hit. One guest said it reminded her of her college days when she'd crave Sara Lee cheesecake, but couldn't wait for it to thaw and ate it frozen. So remember to check the consistency about an hour or two before serving and if it's still too soft to cut, don't despair. Just throw it in the freezer and rename it!

Not our favorite.  The flavor is fine but I agree with the reviewer who said the consistency is more like a thick pudding than a cheesecake.  I let mine set for 8 hours before adding the cherry topping.  It is now over 24 hrs. since I refrigerated the pie and it's still very soft.  We like a firm cheesecake and this is just not it.

I was very disappointed with this recipe!  I read all the reviews first before making this cheesecake and even compared this recipe to many others because it sounded like the best one but I will NEVER make this recipe again.  I even added a cup of whipped cream to stiffen the cheesecake mix and had this chilling in my refrigerator for about 17 hours! When I took it out of the springform pan it reacted like a volcano erupting!  All over my kitchen counter!  What a disappointment!

My mom has been making this exact recipe for years and now I make it as well.  The first few times that I made it it turned out too soupy which is odd seeing as I made it exactly as my mom does then I tried omitting about 1 -2 tablespoons of the lemon juice and ever since it has turned out right.  This is the only cheesecake that my family ever makes and we all love it!!!

This pie filling comes out very soft - more like a custard than a typical cheesecake. I think it might be better if you double the amount of cream cheese and use less lemon juice. Plus, the calorie content is probably much higher than indicated. The calorie content is based on 12 servings, but we normally only get 7 or 8 servings out of a typical 9-inch graham cracker pie crust.

This is an old standby no bake recipe that works every time. I serve this in a blind baked, ten inch, tart pan, with a butter cookie style dough. It affords easy release and provides a stable platfrom for serving.

I made this dish for a party, and everyone loved it.  Some people even offered to pay me to make it again.  I have to agree with other reviews, though.  This cake requires some serious setting time.  If you make it, make it well ahead of time.  Finally, I changed the recipe very slightly for an alternative and used home-made yogurt cheese instead of cream cheese.  This does not set nearly as well as the cream cheese, but it tastes delicious!

This pie was really good, and really RICH. A small piece went a long way. I used 1/4 cup lemon juice and it firmed up just fine. Instead of filling I microwaved a few spoonfulls of strawberry jam and spread it on top. Really good. Thank you for the recipe!

This is great! I love it because you don't need to heat it up! Don't heat the cream cheesse up in the microwave, do let it get to room temp, it will mix better!

I followed the recipe exactly.  After 8 hours it still had not set.  So I left it for 24 hours, and it still did not set.  It was more of a  thick pudding than a cheesecake.  I read the other reviews and saw that it needed all of the lemon juice, so I made sure to do that.  I'm not sure how others got it to set.

Overall, this was incredibly easy to make. I threw it together in no time and let it chill overnight. The lemon juice in my opinion helps to balance out the sweetness of the condensed milk.
This was more of a cherry cheese pie than a real cheesecake. But a nice dessert when I served it on Thanksgiving to the non pumpkin pie fans. I would make it again. I also took the pie out in the morning and topped with the cherry pie filling all over then put it back in the fridge to help set it for a few hours. This way the pie filling isnt oozing everywhere.

I've made quite a few things from allrecipes.com, but this is by far the easiest I've undertaken.  It took me about 5 minutes to actually make.  I didn't have the full amount of condensed sweetened milk the reciple called for (the cans were a bit smaller) but it still came out fine.   I sliced up strawberries instead of the cherries and it was still awesome.  I've made this twice and both times it had gotten rave reviews and it's the first time people have ever asked me for the recipe of something.  Very pleased.

This recipe has been around forever.  I've made it literally hundreds of times and it's never been sour, nor has there been a problem with it setting.  It's very good as a key lime pie also.  I add 3/4 cup unsweetened lime juice such as Nellie & Joe's brand in place of the lemon juice.  Warning, 3/4 cup does make it a little tart, but not overly so, in my opinion.

I made this exactly as directed. I was afraid that it was going to be runny, but it did firm up well enough for each slice to hold its shape. I fully expected hubby and son to complain because it wasn't the new york cheesecake style, but they LOVED it! My son asked for the recipe and ate two slices back to back. 3 people mowed through it in less than 24 hours! Definitely a keeper. Next time, I'm trying out shortbread crust instead of graham cracker. I bet it'd be good with a chocolate crust too!

This is the recipe my mom made when I was a kid, and it's the recipe I use now anytime it's my responsibility to bring a dessert to an event. It's always a hit! I increase the cream cheese by a couple of ounces, decrease the condensed milk and lemon just slightly (to taste), and I never put in the vanilla. I have never had a problem with it setting within five hours or so. Delicious.

My family has been making this cheesecake for years and we love it! A little tip to get your cheesecake to set up properly within a couple hours: beat the softened cream cheese by itself for several minutes before adding the remaining ingredients. Sets up perfectly every time!

Okay everyone I THINK I may have figured out the issue as far as the cheesecake taking too long to set, it may be the BRAND of lemon juice used. I started off with making just 3 cheesecakes, but when people heard I was making them they put orders in. The first 3 I made I used the Wal-Mart brand of lemon juice, the cake batter came out very runny and has not set after 6 hours. I ran out of lemon juice, went and got the Real Lemon brand and with each of the final 3 the cake batter came out thicker and seems as if they will set before my first 3 do. Other than that it tastes nice although the Real Lemon brand seems to be more potent.

My mother has been making this "cheesecake" since I was a kid. This dessert WILL NOT be firm the way a typical cheesecake is, because it is not a custard & is not baked like most cheesecakes. I think many of the people who gave bad reviews are expecting this to be like a baked cheesecake. The name "cream cheese pie" is probably more accurate since this dessert is more like a pudding pie. I still think it's delicious, but people shouldn't expect it to firm up like a New York style cheesecake. It's supposed to be pretty soft even after it's set.

A friend described a cherry cheesecake pie that his mom used to make. This recipe seemed to match his description, so I made it for him to try with one change to the recipe. He mentioned that his mom used lime juice instead of lemon juice, so I did the same. I absolutely loved this, and my friend said it tasted just like he remembered. I will definitely make this again.

I make basically the same cheesecake- but I bake it for 35 min at 350 degrees and then put in the fridge after it's cooled off.  Never have any issues with it not setting.

Although I read all the reviews first, then followed the directions precisely, this was a disaster.  It didn't set, even after being in the fridge for 3 days and was way too sweet.

This was excellent and incredibly easy! I followed exactly and chilled overnight. It was nice and firm, not too sweet, with a hint of lemon flavor. Perfect. NOTE: I used the Keebler "+2 servings" graham cracker premade crust and the filling fit much better and had enough room for the cherry pie filling. Thanks for a rediculously easy dessert!

Well, I've got to give this 5 stars as it was SO easy to make and my guest requested the recipe more than a week later saying he "couldn't get it out of his mind"!  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't have trouble with the consistency of the cheesecake.

Tried this recipe over the weekend. Change a few things - Use 250g of cream cheese and grated some lemon rind. i've also reduced the condensed milk to 390g. i used blueberry pie filling and it turn out fantastic. Brought one to the office, my colleagues love it. The only downside is that this recipe, although set, it is still pretty soft so as long as you don't mind the presentation, its all good! This recipe used minimal number of ingredients and its so easy thus to me, this recipe is a keeper.

This is my husband's favorite cheesecake. I made it the first time for him 36 years ago. We had only been married a week and it convinced him he had found a keeper -- in both me AND the cheesecake. ;)

i grew up eating this, but i disagree about freezing it.  that's the only way i like it.  also, i prefer to leave the vanilla out so it's more tart.

If you are looking for a baked cheesecake type recipe then this is not for you.  For those whose tried this and it ended up "runny," my guess is that evaporated milk was used in place of the sweetened condensed.  I have never had an issue with this being runny.  This sets up in four or five hours but overnight is better.  Very good!

Taste is ok, easy to make... Mine was chilled for 10 hours and is still runny. Also the condensed milk takes over the flavour of the 'cheese'
Probably wouldn't make this again

I followed the recipe EXACTLY, and let the cheesecake chill overnight, for over ten hours, and it NEVER SET. It was just a runny pudding-esque liquid. I don't understand what all of these people with the positive reviews did, but they must have altered the recipe in some way, because I did EXACTLY as it says, and it did NOT work.

I made this for my daughter who loves cheesecake. It tasted great, though, the fact it is mostly condensed milk turned me off personally a little. They didn't know that. My BIGGEST problem though, is that it never set well. It's like pudding.

One tip on this recipe.  You can add a small container of whipped topping (cool whip) and it will make 2 pies.  I like to do this and use different toppings.

This is the cheesecake recipe my mom always made when I was young. It is a very good no bake cheesecake and it can be topped with anything- fruit, chocolate, caramel, etc. Very versatile. I had no problems with it setting up. Very easy to prepare. Just a few minutes of prep and  a great dessert to show for it.

The hardest thing about this recipe is waiting the 5 hours for it to chill!  But don't be tempted to put it in the freezer, it will get crystals in it.

Great cheesecake! I wasn't so sure about using only one package of cream cheese, but since that was all I had, I made the recipe, and it turned out great! I love lots of cherry pie filling on mine.

It did not set for me. I have no idea why. I followed the recipe exactly. Let set in fridge over night... about 12 hours. It was like cheesecake pudding.  The flavor was great which is why I gave 3 stars.

A little on the sweet side for my liking, but I did substitute a greek yogurt cream cheese product for regular cream cheese- not sure if that added sweetness but it definitely took away that almost sour, pasty cream cheese quality. I'd definitely make it again but I'm not sure it would be my go-to based on making it once...

This was just what I was looking for.  Easy and yummy.  When I tasted the batter it tasted a little too lemony.  So I added 1 more pkg of cream cheese.  That made a huge difference.  Next time I will definitely use this recipe again but with 2 pkgs of cream cheese.

This is an old but great recipe.  It's the first (and I think only) one I ever brought home from home ec in school - around 6th grade or so.  I lost mine from the wrapper and came on here for a quick dessert for my grandson.  It took only minutes and passed his lick the beater taste!  It is now in the fridge and is just about set after only 3 hours.  I think the reason some peoples' don't set (maybe) is they are using condensed milk not SWEETENED condensed milk - big difference.  Also, don't softened the cream cheese - the mixer will do just fine.  I put homemade whipped cream and strawberries on top as well.

I learned how to make this version of a no-bake cheesecake back when I was in my mid-teens. It quickly became a favorite with the family. After I met my husband, while we were dating, I served it to him for dessert one day, and he flipped over it! To this day, nearly 31 years after his first bite, he still tells anyone who's willing to listen, that he married me for my cheesecake! LOL!!

I made this for mothers day 2014 and I used a whisk beater, on my electric mixer, I tripled the recipe and it was already firming as I was spooning it into the Graham cracker crusts. I used lemon juice from concentrate also. I grew up with my mother making this and I have to say, it is by far my favorite.

Had OK flavor. Didn't set up right, even after overnight. Doesn't have a cheesecake consistency. It's more like a pie filling consistency. Won't use again for cheesecake.

If I was able to give ZERO stars I would. I followed the recipe EXACTLY. There is no way this could have been edible for anyone unless they did something different. It was pure soup. I wasted all these ingredients for something that could not be eaten.

I have made this recipe for 30 years and it has always set.  I always beat the cream cheese and lemon juice until it is light and fluffy.  This takes some time but it works.  

I'm making 2 of them for a family party tomorrow.

Tastes pretty good, but for some reason, it was still liquidy after 5 hours. But after two days, it stayed in shape.

I followed the recipe exactly but it was not set after five hours so I continued chilling for two more hours. It tasted OK but the pie was so runny that I had to serve it in a bowl. Based on the reviews, this is hit or miss. I'm awfully glad I hadn't planned to serve this gloppy mess to guests. Next time, I'll stick to a real, baked cheesecake.

This recipe has been my mom's most popular dessert growing up. For those of you looking for a firm cheesecake, this is not that type of cheesecake. This will thicken a bit after a day (best to refrigerate overnight if not longer; we always liked it better after 2 days but still delicious after 1). Regardless of how long you let it set, the pie will still have a creamy texture. It is a no-bake recipe so it will not get thick like a traditional cheesecake. If you like a creamy cheesecake, this is the recipe for you! Like another review stated, you are better off using regular condensed milk vs.low-fat or fat-free because the less fat in the condensed milk the more runny the pie will be. If you want to make it more healthy use 1/3 less fat ceam cheese and/or reduced fat pie crust. I also use this recipe as a base for my key lime cheesecake with some obvious modifications. 1 can condensed milk, 1 package of 1/3 less fat cream cheese(I leave out the vanilla in the key lime version and of course no cherries), and I substitute the lemon juice for about 2/3 cup key lime juice...depending on how tart you want it. Another favorite in the house and so easy to whip up!

My grandmother had a cook book from the 1970's with this exact same recipe.

My husbands loves it and asks for it every birthday. Having made it numerous times, I've learned a few tips to helping it set.

1) You have to use all the amount of lemon juice called for or it won't taste right.
2) You must chill for 5 hours at least, preferably overnight.
3) Don't make it on a sweltering hot 90 degree weather day with no end in sight or it will not set. (Don't ask, lol) 
4) If you make your own baked graham cracker or vanilla wafer crust, wait till it has cooled completely to put in filling. As a extra measure I also put the crusts in the freezer for 10 minutes or so.
5) Serve the cherry pie filling on the side.
6) I sometimes use extra cream cheese, but it has set just fine with and without it.

Very rich and creamy.  I doubled the recipe for the filling and made it in a spring form pan so it's easier to cut.  I also let the topping sit on the top while it chilled.  Everyone loved it, but make sure not to take too big a slice, it's so filling.

I enjoy this cheesecake, taste and easy to prepare.  However, I think I'm doing something wrong because it's never completely smooth when I mix the ingredients, it's slightly clumpy.  What could I be doing wrong?  I normally use reduced fat cream cheese.  Could that be it?  Could it be that it's not 'warm' enough yet and that I didn't let it sit at room temperature long enough?  I follow all other instructions as listed.  Any thoughts or suggestions?

I only had 1/6 a cup of lemon juice......yeah.......should have went and bought more, it did not set right and was very runny. But that aside, I didn't like the taste (don't think the lemon juice would have helped with that). I'll probably be looking for a new recipe for Cheesecake.

I have been making this recipe for years, just as my mom had done, since the sixties.  Just about EVERYONE loves it, other than those who have no sweet tooth whatsoever.  As far as it being runny for prior reviews - something obviously went wrong. Maybe you forgot the lemon juice or had old cream cheese and condensed milk. It should sit up quite nice after refrigeration for a few hours and yes does seem to get even better after a day or two.

This is so easy, and everyone loves it.  I used to spend a few hours making a real - meaning you have to put it in the oven and cook it - cheesecake, but my husband likes this better.  Great for summer as no baking involved.

Exactly as my mother used to make.  This is not a light, airy cheesecake - it is more dense, but an excellent recipe when in a hurry.  Blueberry is also a good topping.  I do not recommend using neufchatel (low-fat) cream cheese - regular cream cheese will give it a much smoother texture.

My mom has made this cheesecake for us ever since I can remember.  I don't know why it won't set for some people as I have been making it for years without any problems.  I always use a can of eagle brand milk in it.  Maybe it's the brand people are using or the temperature setting on their refigerators???  Anyway, I agree with some reviewers in that it is not your typical cheesecake.  It is more of a cheese pie and has a hint of citrus so it has sort of a key lime pie kind of taste to it.  Whatever, the case, it's good with or without cherry pie filling.  My dad likes it with blueberry pie filling however, I think it is best plain or with the cherry...

I learned this one from my mom and we have been making it for years and years.  I recommend not adding the lemon juice until right before you are ready to put in the crust as the lemon juice is what makes it set.    I always just put the cherry syrup on my piece and then gave my cherries to my dad.    It is also great with other fruit toppings!

I made this cheesecake for Christmas dinner and it was wonderful. I made 2 different ones because my fiance isn't so crazy about cherries, (I made cherry and wildberries). Everyone loved it, even our fussy dad who happens to love sweetened condensed milk, yaaay!!! I'll for sure make this again in the future.

My husband and I ate this pie every night for a several nights, it was so delicious.  I didn't have the whole amount of lemon juice, and it was still delicious (I probably only had 2 Tbs).  I put it in the fridge for only 2 hours or so, and then froze it for the last 30 minutes, and it worked beautifully.  It wasn't totally stiff like other cheese cakes, but who cares about that when it's so unbelievably good?

This is one of our favorite desserts ever! It isn't supposed to be firm like a cheesecake like some reviewers were expecting. It sets up but is still very "puddingish". We love it though. It has a great sweet/tart combination.

I found that even after blending the filling for 15 minutes with my stand mixer, there are still creamcheese lumps in it. So I am assuming I must have done something wrong. I did soften the cream cheese for 30 seconds in the microwave first... Also if you live in canada, the measurements are a little weird. The amount of CC you need for the recipe is a little less than a box of philly and if you buy eagle brand condensed milk its somewhere around a can and a half but i didnt have the patience to figure out the exact measure. I havent actually finished making the pie yet so i shouldnt even be reviewing but I thought I would add those thoughts before i forget.

An ever so easy and tasty little cheesecake! I saved this recipe out of a magazine years ago and it's been a favorite since. It was called a 'Cheery Cherry Cheese Pie'. You must let the cream cheese completely soften before mixing with the 'milk'. I'm not understanding why other reviews have said the cheese part hasn't set. I can only assume it's because they're not sticking with the recipe. After making this recipe at least 3-4 times a year for the past 20+ years I have never had a problem. It's always set after about 4 hours to add the cherries. Another thought: 12 servings is a little extreme unless you only want a taste.

i opted not to use a cherry topping, and i added 2 cups of whipped cream into the filling. because of the 1 can of sweetened condensed milk, the end product was way too sweet for my liking; i could hardly eat it because it was so sweet! also, the filling did not set, even after a night of refrigeration; this was probably also due to the addition of the whipped cream, but nevertheless i don't think it would have set anyway because of the condensed milk.

This was so easy and simple! I followed the recipe exactly except I put fresh strawberries on top.  It was great.  I think the pie filling or adding sugar to the strawberries would've made it too sweet.  Next time, I think I'll double the cream cheese.  But it was great!

I made this recipe today for a church potluck and it turned out wonderful.  The only change I made to it was after mixing it by hand, I used an electric mixer and the mix got thicker the more I mixed.  After only 3 1/2 hours in the refridgerator it set up perfectly and had rave reviews of it at the potluck.  Thanks for such an easy recipe!

I made this for my husbands birthday and it turn out fantastic. I got scared because i read the reviews after i made the filling. But I followed the recipe to the T and it turn out perfect. Mine set in a couple of hrs. I'm wondering if other people's didn't set because they used low fat ingredients? Sometimes thats happens if you used light or low fat your stuff turns out runny!

This was by far the easiest cheesecake I've ever made! But it was a bit too sweet even for my sweet tooth.  Next time I will use a bit less of the condensed milk. After 5+ hours of chilling, it was not as firm to my liking, so I froze the cake for a couple hours more and surely enough became firm like a 'baked' cheesecake.  And the sweetness was just right.

This was fabulous and so easy!  I made it with Comstock Blueberries but plan on making it with the Cherry filling soon!
This was just devoured and I recieved many compliments!  Not sure what the problem with the 1 star reviewers below had with it not setting up except maybe their refrigerator wasn't cold enough.  I followed the directions exactly and it set up perfectly!  Thanks for a great recipe! :)

My grandmother always made this pie thus giving it another name, Cherry O'Cream Pie.  We like this pie for quick and easy, but prefer a baked cheesecake when time allows.

I made this recipe 2 days before a picnic that ended up being called off due to cold weather. My husbad and I ate it, it was delicious. We shared it with 4 of our neighbors, and had 2 pieces left over. I did not have any trouble with any runniness. Maybe by letting it set so long, it got better.

This pie is very delicious and quick to
make, but I found that it called for
too much lemon juice. The final product
is almost sour from the amount of juice
you add (1/3 cup!!!). I only add half of
this and it remains a very good pie.

This isn't a cheesecake not even a no bake cheesecake. I should've just made a real cheesecake, but I wanted to try something new. It didn't set. I've made plenty of cheesecakes in my life and definitely know what I'm doing.

Delicious but after 4hrs still wasn’t firm, I suggest adding to freezer at some point. Also, drain cherries, can seem excessive if there’s more juice than plain cherries.

It was great!!  I had no issues with the pie setting.  I placed it in the oven for 10 minutes.  Let it cool down, put the cherries on it, and popped it in the refrigerator.  Wonderful recipe.

This recipe is so quick and easy. It is becoming a family favorite. The only changes that I made were; 1. I used a premade Graham cracker crust and 2. I made a fresh blueberry topping instead of the canned cherry topping.

I followed the instructions to the absolute letter...and my cakes did not properly set. It's been nearly 24 hours. They are *delicious*...but soupy. This is especially distressing as one was a gift for an ill friend.

Five stars for taste, 2 stars for texture.

Delicious! It set up perfectly. I will definitely be making this again. No changes were needed, but I would caution cooks to use the correct ingredients in the correct proportions. This is a chemistry experiment, after all. It won't set up if you aren't precise.

I’m so surprised this has five stars. After following all of the directions the cheesecake still ended up being runny and it never hardened.

I used 1 cup of sour cream instead of the sweetened condensed milk and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice instead of 1\3 cup. It is too much lemon that's why it doesn't set too much acidity. I also used 2 -8 oz.  Blocks of cream cheese instead of one.  I used 3/4 cup to 1 cup of granulated sugar.  I used 1\2 tsp. Vanilla extract. I also used 1 tsp. Flour to thicken it so it hardens better. I mix  flour into all the ingredients once they are all mixed together well. Make it the last ingredient u use if u choose to use flour u don't have to it's what I do personally. Also make sure all ingredients are room temperature too. If u use the milk i would only use 1\2 of it. But i replace the milk by using sour cream its a cheesecake not a milk cake lol. Just saying. :)

The cheesecake was super easy to put together. I used digestive biscuits and butter to make the base. Followed everything else exactly as per the recipe to make the cheesecake. I kept it in the fridge for  around 8 hours and put the cherry coulis just before cutting it. 

It was heavenly! The perfect go to cake when you don't have an oven. 

P.S. As mentioned by other users the cake does begin to get a bit runny if you keep it out for more than 15-20 minutes.

The recipe should state you need to blend the cream cheese and sweet condensed milk together prior to adding the lemon juice.... otherwise your filling will be grainy.

This is awesome cheesecake.  It can be made as is or you can add a secret ingredient to the recipe.  Adding pudding mix will seal the deal for you.  I also chill the pie filling when I chill the cheesecake so that it is put on top cold and not room temp.  The pudding gives the cheesecake a special touch and richness that will keep them asking for it!  You can also change the flavor of the pudding if you like to just about anything.  Chocolate works great!  Enjoy!

I gave this a four star rating.  It is easy and fast.  The red cherry topping gives it that extra pop of color and flavor.  Great pie to take to a pot luck.

Having said that, if you are a cheesecake person, don't expect this have exact same taste and texture of a cheesecake.  The pie has a wonderful flavor and is very rich but is not the same as an actual cheesecake (which by the way takes a LOT LONGER and way more ingredients to prepare).

I call this "fast food" cheesecake.  :)  It's a winner.

Followed the recipe exactly, using fresh squeezed lemon juice.  Quick, easy and delicious.  It set perfectly - no need to change a thing.  I'm going to make it again and try a different kind of crust next time.

This is the old classic recipe that our Mother's took to church potlucks and everyone enjoyed so much.  Sometimes it's nice to revisit the good ole days.

This was delicious! I did make a homemade Graham Cracker crust instead of a store bought. Will definitely make this again!

this is exactly what o was looking for. my son likes to take.mini cheesecakes for work.  I make this up and He spoons it into mini graham cracker pie crusts and spoons on the topping. it is perfect. only comment is to blend cream cheese and sweetened condensed milk together before adding lemon juice. makes a smoother filling.

7 hours in..... its like milk. not solidifying at all. what a waste of money on this. I didn't read the reviews until the 6 hour mark... I did add extra cream cheese, I always do. but still not happening. I read one review that said 2 days to harden... my 3 year old will be expecting her "treat" tomorrow this is a disaster recipe. NEVER AGAIN.

This is the so easy to make. The first one was gone immediately. The next day I made another one with blueberries. I have been teaching my 12 year old granddaughter to bake in the last 6 months. She made the second one with no help. Super easy and delicious. I do recommend chilling it overnight though.

I've made a no bake cheesecake similar to this for years and it's always a hit, I've never had a problem with it setting but I've always used two packages of cream cheese.

Super easy and it tasted awesome,  but it didn't really set up properly-I used fat free sweetened condensed milk & reduced fat cream cheese, have since looked at a few reviews here with same results.  It was definitely still edible but not something you'd serve to guests-ended up kind of a mess. It was a delicious mess though; hence the four stars.

Loved the flavor and had no trouble getting it to set like some other reviewers said. My biggest problem was getting a slice before it was all gone.

My mother made this cheesecake when I was about 19 and I've been making it every since. For those who say it never set up I only can think of 2 reasons, either they skimped on the lemon juice(I always use ReaLemon brand) or they mistakenly used Evaporated milk rather than Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed milk. The only time it didn't set up properly is because I used 1/4 cup rather than 1/3 of ReaLemon.

I have been making this for 30+ years. The only thing I change is that I use 2 bars of cream cheese. Always have and it always comes out perfect.  Cream the cream cheese completely and SLOWLY add the sweetened condensed milk. This will eliminate any lumps.

Super easy.  My advise- mix up the cream cheese first, alone, and try to get it smooth.  If you add everything together first, my experience has been that the cream cheese will have tiny lumps that you can't get out.   My kids LOVE it!

The only reason this isn't setting for some of you is that you're not using enough lemon juice. The lemon juice is essential for "cooking" the ingredients and setting the pie.

Clinton Kelly made this on "The Chew" with modifications: 
1. used a loaf pan lined with plastic; 2. stirred in unsweetened berries; 3. froze the loaf solid, then tempered individual slices before serving.  
I've loved all the other Clinton recipes I've tried, but this was too sweet (can't imagine how sweet it must be with canned pie filling! and only chilled.) 
Also, there were temperature problems -- when frozen, it had no flavor; when soft, it was gluey.  There was only about 2 minutes when it was tasty and luxurious.  This would be OK if you're eating alone, but I like a social table and 2 minutes is not appropriate for eating an entire course, so I won't make this dessert again.
For me, it was 2 stars, but it appealed to those with a giant sweet tooth, who didn't care that it collapsed into a sticky mess. They were in the majority so I input 3 stars.

This cheesecake came out really runny, even though I followed the directions exactly as they were written.  The flavor was good and it was quick to make, but I'd probably try a different recipe next time.

This is more of a cheese pie than cheesecake. It is the only one my family has used. My mom made it when we were kids and now i make it. It is a holiday staple. I am amazed at how many people gave it a poor review saying it didnt set. I would guess over-mixing or something-and one review said she added whipping cream and put in a springform pan. THIS IS not a cheesecake. 
It works perfectly every time IF made following the directions and not over-mixing. If you are looking for a new york cheesecake, no, but a cream cheese pie this is. And so much better than the one with cool whip in the recipe.
I am about to make two of these right now! (had to check lemon juice amount as I always forget).

This recipe is an old one! It is fantastic, but not what you want if you are looking for a NewYork style cheesecake. 
for those out there having problems with this setting up, YOU MUST USE FRESHLY SQUEEZED LEMON JUICE. I suspect some who are having this problem are probably trying to use bottled lemon juice. You must juice a lemon to get the juice. That is the ONLY way it will set up!

I tried this recipe and made it into mini cheesecake shooters for the dessert table at my daughter's birthday party. They were amazing and all my guests love it! It was one of the desserts that finished first. Can't wait to make this again, this time I'll make them in a jar. :) I must add that I did not use the whole can of condensed milk. Only about 3/4 of it. It was sweet enough with only that.

This is a family favorite! I have been making it for years now and everyone loves it. Just a tip for those who have a problem with it setting up, add two teaspoons of Knox gelatin and you will be good to go! We always put the cherries on top right away so they can settle down in the pie.

This was my first time making Cheesecake ever. I made it for a friend for Christmas and he said it was the most amazing that he's ever had. I had to try it for myself and he was right. Definitely going to make more!

I used this recipe as a base for a dessert I made yesterday. I made my own graham cracker crust by pulsing graham crackers and cinnamon in a food processor and pressing them into 13x9" pan that held a stick of melted butter. I substituted almond extract for the vanilla. I used the 14 oz. can of sweetened milk, but increased the cream cheese to 12 oz. to help fill the larger pan. Lemon juice was increased to about 1/2 cup. I also added a 6 oz.cup of raspberry yogurt and about 10 fresh raspberries when mixing the filling. It gave the filling a great raspberry flavor and a nice pink color, and the yogurt provided a little more tartness. I added fresh raspberries on top for garnish, and it set up pretty well in about 2 hours. This went over very well with family.

This is an awesome recipe.  I have been making this for years, since I was a child.  I have never, ever had it not set up.  I have probably made this 100+ times.  It is a quick, easy recipe.  It is sweet and tangy, and works well with different toppings.

I have been making this pie for years. My son who doesn't like sweets loves this pie. I have never had any problems in making it and am also confused why it didn't work out for some people. Maybe try making it again.  One thing I always do first though is mix the cream cheese until creamy before adding the other ingredients or else I have chunks of cream cheese in my pie. It is an easy recipe and will be making it for Christmas.

It was really simple and easy i followed the direction except for one thing of one of the other people on here made a comment about putting it in the oven for like an hour and I did that and it seems to have come out really good um I prefer the oven for an hour and then you let it chill in the fridgerator for an hour as opposed to letting it sit for 5 hours then I heard some other comments they will like it was wobbly still so I just put in oven for a hour and it worked

Using TWO eight ounce packages (lowfat, not fatfree) cream cheese & fatfree sweentened condensed milk, you've got a very good no cook cheese pie!  Krista's recipe.  I wonder if it's a misprint since some had runny pies.  That extra block would fix the problem.  Hmmm ... :D

I have made this pie for years. Yes you must use the whole amount of lemon juice. Also many people get evaporated milk and condensed milk mixed up. Condensed milk will not "pour" out of the can it is thick like pudding. Also calling this "cheesecake" is not correct.. cheesecake is baked, and there for very firm. This is a softer set more like a cream or pudding pie. Hope that helps for the folks who have it not setting correctly.

I have loved this since I was a little girl.  Of course, back then it didn't have a graham cracker crust, and no pre-made pie-filling either. Regardless of that, it's still a favorite, and my husband LOVES it.

I like to add 1/4t of almond extract. YUMMMMM!

The taste, the texture, everything about this was gross.  I allowed the cream cheese to sit out for 5 hours, so it had PLENTY of time to soften.  I wouldn't feed this to the dog.  I threw it out.  Very disappointing.

This recipe is beyond wonderful. I've been making it for YEARS! Never disapoints. If you follow the directions exactly, it will work well. I used real vanilla beans, tastes awesome.  I might try Mollycurls77 idea and make multiples with different toppings. I usually stick to cherry but recently tried strawberry.

I was looking for a cheesecake recipe to make and I came across this pie. It has a much different consistency than a cheesecake, but it is a WONDERFUL pie! I did not mix in the entire can of condensed milk so that the filling was a little thicker. I chilled it for two hours. DELICIOUS.

Made this with one minor adjustment and came out GREAT!  Bake @ 375 for 30-35 minutes.  Cool on wire rack, then refrigerate for a couple of hours.  Top with cherries and serve.  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  A huge hit.  Tasted great too - not too sweet - just perfect.  It's going to be my signature dessert dish!

This was a very quick and easy recipe. It turned out really good but not as sweet as I would have liked it to be even with the cherry topping, I'll add a little sugar to it next time to sweeten it a bit. I did add 2 tablespoons of lime juice to bring the tartness on the lemon juice down.

This is ok, but it is not exactly "cheesecake". The taste was too sweet for my liking due to the whole can of sweetened condensed milk. The texture was pie-like, but it still did not set up well enough after being in the fridge overnight. When we cut a piece out, the rest of it just oozed into that spot! I did not put the cherry pie filling on it, we used fresh blackberries and strawberries instead so the sweetness would not be overpowering.

Quick, easy and delicious to make...Can top this with any pie filling not just cherry. Great for pot lucks or just entertaining family and friends.

My mother used to make this for us every Valentine's Day.  I remember it fondly.  She would place a heart shaped cookie cutter in the middle and put the cherries around it and put it in the fridge until it was set and then remove the cookie cutter for a cute white heart in the center.  You could also do that with a star and put blueberry pie filling in the white section after it's set.    My one tip is to use the bottled lemon juice.  I tried to fancy it up with fresh lemon juice a few times and it often did set as well.  The real lemon juice in the bottle works every time.  Beat the filling until it starts to stiffen up a little and you're good to go.  A homemade crust on this is also fantastic if you have the time!  It's really sweet because of the pie filling but you could always swap that topping out for something better.  The cheesecake part is really tasty.

I was unimpressed with this cheesecake. It had an almost grainy texture and was rather lacking in flavor.

I LOVE this recipe. My mom used to make this cheesecake when I was a kid. The only difference is she would not use vanilla extract and she usually used a little less lemon juice. It is so easy to make and it's always a hit with my family. For the holidays, I'll use the mini graham cracker crusts and make individual cheesecakes for everyone. And the best cherry topping is Lucky Leaf. Perfect balance between sweet and tangy.

Taste-wise, this was great.  It didn't set up for me, but I didn't beat it thoroughly so I am pretty sure that is my fault.  It still tasted wonderful when it was a semi-goopy mess.  :-)

This was awesome! Came out perfect, i used blueberry topping instead though. Also I bought the generic graham crust in the store and on the back was this EXACT recipe! Either way it was great :)

This was awesome! Super fast and easy and delicious! I didn't use the cherry pie filling, just made it plain because thats how my husband likes cheesecake. It definitely is not like real cheesecake, but is still very good and you just cant beat how easy it is to make :)

I have used this same recipe for years, love it. Any of you who thought it was 'runny' or 'too sweet' obviously did something wrong, didn't measure , or tried to use something that was not listed in the ingredients. My secret, is I use a spring form pan, and as I add each layer I keep it in the freezer. People here fight over it! I also make my own fruit topping by stewing berries or whatever I have on hand, thickening it, let it cool of course and pouring it over the top.  I see some of you have baked it, I will be trying that myself! Thanks for sharing :)

Delicious! This is something I've made twice now... I can't resist it!  Instead of using pie filling, I took maraschino cherries, the juice from the cherries, sugar, and cornstarch, and kind of made my own cherry topping for it.

My husband likes it.  He thinks it's a little on the "too" sweet side though which is surprising.  I don't like "cheesecake," but from what I've tasted this is good.  It couldn't have been any simpler to make!!!  I would say, though, that it's more of a cheesy pie, than cheesecake.  It will definitely be made again.  The only variations I made were a dash of cinnamon and I used canned cherries in water instead of cherry pie filling to top it off.

I recently made this for a group date i went on as a high school student. it was really good, and only took about five minutes to put together. i love stuff that's quick, easy and really good. i didn't use the cherries, though, i used strawberries, but i can see how cherries could be pretty fantastic

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out just fine. It certainly didn't set real firmly, but it did set. We LOVED the taste and it was extremely easy to make. I will definitely be making this tasty, simple recipe again!

I love the recipe and have also made it for many years. Recently made individual servings using the "Graham Cracker Crust I" recipe (used half brown sugar and half white sugar, and prepared full dessert a FULL day in advance) in cupcake tins. Wonderful!

You can't go wrong with this recipe.  I have been making this for years, as my mother taught me.  Be patient, let the cheesecake set nicely.  After licking the spoon, I know it will be difficult.

This recipe is wonderful!! I also don't understand the people that had a problem with it setting up. My mother-in-law gave this recipe to me years ago and I have been using it ever since. In fact, when I opened my own restaurant, this is the cheesecake that I make and is on my menu. People absolutely loved it, and I had tons of people order a second piece after tasting the first.

Made a few changes, I made it on a chocolate crumb crust and put a layer of brownie chunks on the bottom and also mixed 1/2 the cherry filling into the batter. Set perfectly, very good and easy to make

I made this recipe for my daughter who just gave birth to my second grandchild (sorry, had to brag!) and it came out perfect!  I followed the recipe exactly and softened the cream cheese in the microwave for 10 or 15 seconds after breaking it up in chunks and used bottled lemon juice.  I had no problems with it - it set up beautifully and tasted great.  I liked it even better than baked cheesecake myself.  Thank you for a quick, easy recipe!

This cheesecake is so super easy to make and it is delicious! I used it because it didn't require a lot of cream cheese. I did read the other reviews and have to agree that it does take a little longer than the 4 hours to set. I had it after setting about 6 hours and it still hadn't set all the way but by the next day it was just right. If you have the time to wait for this to set use this recipe. This is a great dessert!

I tried this recipe today for my husband.  It could not have been easier.  I followed the recipe and unlike others, mine set up perfectly.  The only thing I did different was not let my cream cheese soften.  I just blended it while it was super cold.  Maybe that is why it set so well.  It was out of this world as far as taste is concerned.  I will be making this again!

This is the best cheesecake. I've made it several times and everyone loves it. Its so quick and easy just be sure you give it at least 12 hours to set. I have also made this with LIME juice instead of the lemon juice and its just as wonderful.

delicious and so easy.  My 11 year old daughter loves to make this and it always tastes wonderful.  We use all of the lemon juice.

We usually like chocolate desserts, but this was really good for a change.  Not the normal consistency of a cheesecake, but delicious just the same.

I thought that the taste, quickness and easiness of this recipe were wonderful, however I found it to be a bit runny even after refrigerating it for a day.  A great recipe over all though.
