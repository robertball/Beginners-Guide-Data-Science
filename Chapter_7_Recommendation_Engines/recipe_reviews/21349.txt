My grandmother made this all the time and so do I.  The only change, which may help those of you who felt it was gooey, was that we put the chips and walnuts on after we baked it.  They melted on top like a topping rather than leaving the cake batter seem undone.  This really is a great cake!

I tried this cake for a picnic.  It was too easy to make, traveled well, and was great.  Perfect for non-baking chocolate lovers!

This certainly was easy and tasted good, but it was very gummy--didn't cook even after 40 min.  Maybe because the only cake mixes I could find already had "pudding in the mix" and this was too much pudding.

This cake is so easy to make and it tastes delicious. It's like a cross between a brownie and a piece of chocolate cake.

Just made this recipe for a friends Birthday Cake. It was very easy, very quick, and VERY good.  Will definitely make again -- for ANY occasion!  She loved it, and requested the recipe. Maybe she'll make it for MY birthday!  haha

This cake was moist - I'll give it that - but it had a funny texture (due to the pudding).  I would have preferred a more traditional cake with a richer taste.

Nice, fairly simple cake for a picnic, barbecue or potluck. The cake was slight dense and not overly sweet. Great with a little Cool Whip or whipped cream. Try it!
