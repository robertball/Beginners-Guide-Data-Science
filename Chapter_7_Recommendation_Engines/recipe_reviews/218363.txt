I made this jello for the 4th of July and it turned out perfectly.  I would give it 5 stars, except that I was concerned because the list of ingredients and the directions did not match up.  The red and blue layer called for 2 envelopes unflavored gelatin in the list of ingredients, but the directions said to add 1 packet for each layer.  What to do??  I went with the directions and used 2 packets for each of those layers and yes, it did turn out firm - but it looked perfect and served up beautifully like finger jello - the kids loved it - I would absolutely make it again - it may become a 4th of july standard in my home.

It looked great but was disappointed it had to much unflavored gelatin in it.  It was chewy more like finger jello not what I was looking for.  Next time I would leave out the unflavored gelatin or cut back on it.

I made this tonight for 4th of July tomorrow. I love the way it looks but haven't tried it yet! I sprayed a little cooking oil on the glass dish so it should come out easier when I cut it into squares. I plan to use whip cream on the top with a strawberry just to make it pretty and festive. I used only half a pack of unflavored gelatin with the colored jello. I used one full pack with the white.

This looked great and the "jiggler" style cubes were perfect for little hands.  My colors didn't run, I followed the directions and used the 4 packets of unflavored gelatin in the sweetened condensed milk.  One commented their white layer was tan.  Be sure your scm is a fresh can, since it darkens with age.  If fresh, it turns into a nice white layer.  I had no issues with the layers adhering to each other.

I remember this from when I was a kid - my mom used the sweetened condensed milk (not cream) version as well.  Still pretty good!  The way the recipe is written will yield 3 layers, not the 6 shown in photos.  Also, the amount of unflavored gelatin added with the cherry and blue raspberry JellO differs between the recipe (2 packets) and the instructions (1).  I used the 2 packets per JellO flavor and this stuff set up very firm - finger JellO (jigglers) is a great way to describe it.  I'd also consider spraying the bottom of your 13x9 pan with non stick spray; while mine wasn't necessarily difficult to remove I did leave some chunks of red JellO in the bottom of the pan.  Overall fun and easy to make and visually impressive! (Especially if you aren't lazy like me and do more than 3 layers.)

I made this for our community senior center. Topped it with whipped  cream and fresh strawberries and blueberries. It was well received. 
The only thing is the unflavored gelatin should be placed in cold water not hot. The hot water made it clump.

Tried this for a Birthday Party everyone loved it. I used 1 packet (unflavoured gelatine) with the flavoured ones and then used two packets for the condence milk. It wasn't to stiff and we loved that it was to sweet either. I will sure me making this again.

I was uncertain about making this because of all the steps but I'm so glad I did because it wasn't very hard to make and it turned out amazing. You just have to be careful when slicing them out in squares. Use the nonstick spray for easy removal. I ran a small knife around and under each piece before removing onto my platter. It makes a statement on the dessert table. Kids loved them. Will definitely make again next year for the 4th of July!

Unfortunately, the middle layer, (condensed milk) did not adhere well to the 1st layer of jello.   It cooled off too fast !

The taste was pretty good but it's just an okay dish. Jell-O is Jell-O, but this dish is not something I would want again.

We thought it looked good, but was tasteless.  It has way too much gelatin in it.
