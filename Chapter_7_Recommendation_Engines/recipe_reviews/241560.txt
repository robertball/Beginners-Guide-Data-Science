Specifically reviewing the technique since I didn’t have 100% of the ingredients on hand. Never knew why my rice would come out mushy and sticky before even with using leftover rice. The super hot pan and multiple additions of rice made my dish come out perfect. Hubs loved it even though dinner was made with all leftovers.

Turned out awesome. Make sure you take the time to mix the rice one cup at a time. It makes the end result well worth it.

It was delicious! Had a roast pork left over, diced it and added it to the fried rice? Didn’t have peas so added diced green beans with fresh diced carrots. It was a yummy dinner! Thank you!

Liked it very much.  I didn't add cilantro, but did add water chestnuts. Also didn't have canola so used bacon fat.  Was yummy.

Made this using some leftover risotto: turned out great! Great way to use up small amounts of different foods.

I didn't have any fish sauce and I used leftover yellow rice, but this turned out fantastic.  It was so good my husband finished it all and I had no leftovers for lunch.

It isn’t terrible but it’s not very good either. Followed recipe added sriracha, sesame seeds and zucchini instead of cucumber.

I doubled the recipe and ate part with left over beef broccoli, and added rotisserie chicken to the rest.  I didn't have sesame oil, so I used olive oil. I also used saved bacon grease for flavor.  I also didn't use fish oil since we didn't have any, and used black pepper instead of white pepper.  Of the optional ingredients, I used sriracha, green onions, and cilantro.  I also used a corn, carrot, green bean, and peas mix in it.  The family loved it!  Tasted as good as if it was from a restaurant

This was a perfect recipe for some leftover pork chops and rice.  I backed off the sriracha without reading the other persons review and I'm glad I did.  A couple squirts was all it needed.  Very tasty!

I made this recipe exactly a written including the Sriracha except I omitted the MSG. As a lover of Sriracha I didn't even second guess the amount and used the full tablespoon. Although it wasn't blazing hot it just overpowered the flavors of the fried rice. When I make this again I will only use 1/2 tablespoon so yes, as the recipe states, add the Sriracha to taste. Otherwise this is a keeper and no MSG is needed.
