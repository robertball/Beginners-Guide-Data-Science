As far as cauliflower and kohlrabi soups go--this is probably 5 stars.  I used chicken base instead of vegetable base (boullion) and also used 2 lbs of kohlrabi and 3 1/2 cups of each milk/broth.  1 huge onion and 2 green onions dash of lawry's and pepper and I thought it was great!  Didn't have orzo on hand.  Blended it (after slightly cooling) with my immersion blender (while still in the warm/hottish pot) and skipped dirtying the big blender.  Great soup!

I make this soup in huge batches using huge Kohlrabi! Nobody buys the big ones (softball or larger), but they work well for the soup. Use a strainer after you blend it to get any remaining strings of fiber out!

This tasted delicious, but the broth was very thin.  It may have just needed more kohlrabi, but I think next time I would add a couple tablespoons of flour.  Overall, this was a very tasty way to use the kohlrabi from our CSA box.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

So delicious! The only thing I would recommend is making sure to peel the kohlrabi down to the softer white part - don't leave any fibrous bits cause they don't go away even in the blender.

Yum!  I needed a recipe to use of Kohlrabi, which we had never had before.  I followed the amounts in the directions, but had to adjust slightly based on what I had in the house.  I added a cup of diced celery with the butter and onion and sauteed these together.  I mashed the kohlrabi after cooking it in the broth mixture (for company, I'd puree--but it was fine with a bit of chunky texture for us).  I used 1 cup of skim milk powder to 2 and 1/2 cups of water instead of milk (didn't have any reg. milk).  Skipped the orzo (didn't have that either), but we truly didn't miss it.

What a delicious way to prepare kohlrabi! I agree that the soup was a bit thin but I cooked it down to a desirable consistency. Minor tweaks: used ghee, added a clove of garlic, used 2 bay leaves, and tossed the tops in at the end with the orzo. One of the best creamed soups I've made.

The only reason I gave 4 stars is because I thought as written, it's a little thin. After blending the soup, I made a roux (I didn't measure, but I think it was 4T of butter and 3-4 heaping spoonfuls of flour) and slowly stirred the blended soup into the roux. I also didn't have bay leaves, so I used 1/2t of thyme instead.

Added 2 potatoes and 2 tbsp flour to thicken soup. Used savory, 2 tsp and garlic for flavor. Use an immersion blender if available. Lightly toasted noodles before adding to soup. Delicious!

This was an excellent soup. We had never tried kohlrabi and were nervous to try it at first. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable like a few reviewers suggested and added a tsp garlic and used seasoned salt. This recipe is fabulous. Thank you.

Wow, very nice soup! I am eating it as I type. I just pulled the last of the kohlrabi out of the garden and this soup was a great way to use some of them. I have only eaten them raw. I didn't have regular milk so used a can of evaporated milk and the broth. After blending I thought it was a little thin so added about a tablespoon of masa harina and that worked fine. Also, a tiny sprinkle of nutmeg and topped with a grating of Parmesan. Excellent!

This was way more enjoyable then I thought kohlrabi could be.  Made it by the recipe with one change.  I added fresh squeezed lemon in the bowl before I served it.  I think it added just the right about of zing.

Great recipe. Omitted the orzo. Used a little leek i had left over as well, 2 stalks of celery.  Used 2 1/2 cups veggie and chix broth, and 1/2 cup of unsweetened soy milk.  Absolutely delicious.  I like my soups a bit thicker, and this turned out wondeful.  Also, add a clove of garlic.  Highly recommend!

Delicious! Used less of the liquid ingredients; we like our soups thick. Added some garlic powder. Sea salt instead of regular salt. When all ingredients were simmered soft; used a hand blender to blend. Then added a large handful of fresh spinach. Did not simmer any longer. Did not add any orzo pasta. My husband loved it! Now a family favorite...thanks for sharing!

I love the flavor of the soup.  It is a little runny but when you add the orzo pasta it helped to thicken it a bit.  I also let it simmer without the lid after I cooked the orzo pasta so that helped to make it a thicker soup too.  I changed the recipe a little bit.  I made the soup with coconut milk, 2 bay leafs, some garlic and chicken broth.  I added some smoked turkey into the soup so we had some protein and that made the soup over the top.  I served it with a vegetable tray and homemade herb bread.

It's a good base, but very bland if prepared only following the recipe. I added a ton of spices including oregano, garlic salt, Hungarian paprika, Indian cayenne, and some pepperjack cheese. I fried some jalapenos to toss up on top.

Of course I made changes and yes, I will make it again.  To be honest, I was looking for a basic kohlrabi soup recipe and this is it.  I read all of the reviews and came up with my own way to make it thick  and creamy.  First of all, I used 4 kohlrabi bulbs.  I added celery to the onion and I also used Better than Bouillon vegetable instead of regular vegetable broth.  Here's what I really changed, since my kids don't like dairy, I knew 2-1/2 cups would be too much milk so I used a can of cream of celery and cream of potato soups and I added 5 cups of water plus sweet potato greens to the broth after I took out the kohlrabi to blend it.  I let the soup simmer for an additional 15 minutes. My children absolutely loved it.

Delicious!!  I added a few cloves of garlic with the onion, and since I didn't have vegetable broth I added plain water and a whole carrot for taste.  No orzo because I don't eat Pasta.  This soup doesn't need it :-)

Got some kohlrabi from the CSA and picked this to try it. I thought it was pretty good, though a little bland partway through cooking it. Followed some of the other tips to punch it up a little. Lowrys, garlic, lemon juice. Then I put in the orzo per the directions. It never cooked properly and completely ruined the soup. Ended up dumping the whole pot and making something else. Gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I can see the potential without the orzo.

This was delicious!  I didn't feel like dirtying another pot/bowl, so I only blended as much as I could fit in one batch.  I left the rest in chunky form, and I really enjoyed the kohlrabi chunks that were left.  I think I'll deliberately leave more chunks next time.

I also didn't have enough milk, so I substituted about a cup of half and half for a cup of milk.

Awesome!  This is the best thing I've ever made with kohlrabi.  I threw in some carrots and subbed millet for the orzo.  I also added chopped kohlrabi greens after the puree, and added the milk (a bit less) at that time.  No extra salt needed.  Loved by the whole family - Double this!

This was a very tasty soup but be sure to take the time to peel the kohlrabi really well or you'll end up with strings of fiber in your bowl.

Good, easy soup! Chicken stock or broth will also work. Any small pasta will work instead of orzo. I didn't like the taste of plain raw kohlrabi, but I wanted to find a way to use up what I had. My picky toddler loved it, I liked it, and the other adults were so-so on it.
