This bread was very dense but had a wonderful flavor because of the molasses. The loaves turned out much better than the rolls. The rolls were too dense from the beginning. I love the bread as a breakfast bread toasted with jam.

This was tasty bread. I made it entirely in my new KA so it was very easy. I scaled the recipe to one loaf as it is only for me. It is a very dense bread. I did store it in fridge which did seem to cause it to get rather gummy on the bottom. Toasting that fixed it right up but be advised this happens if you store it in fridge
