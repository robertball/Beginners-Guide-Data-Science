I usually don't consider brussel sprouts my favorite vegetable because they have a bitter flavor and after-taste.  However, I decided to give this receipe a try due to the previous reviews.  I have to admit, it really dresses up the sprouts and improves the flavor!  The crumb topping is really yummy and masks the bitter taste.  Great recipe and even my picky husband liked it!  If you have kids, this is a great way to get them to eat veggies that they normally don't like.  As for the the previous reviewer CHADERINKAIA who said, "would not reccomend, unless you are absolutely a brussel sprout fan" ... I think that's a given.  No matter how much you dress up a food, it's still going to have some of its original flavor.  If you hate brussel sprouts, don't make this dish because it'll still taste like brussel sprouts!  Duh!  It doesn't matter how much merlot wine sauce you put on dog food, it will still taste like dog food.

Excellent!  I could live on this, but then again I love veggies!  I substituted 1/2 pound baby carrots for 1/2 pound of the sprouts and made it colorful.  The kids ate the carrots.  Boil the baby carrots about a minutes less than the sprouts. Thanks.

These were sooo yummy!!  I added a few splashes of soy sauce to mine.  I guess I felt like being creative and boy am I glad I did, because it made them taste delicious.  My husband and I enjoy brussels sprouts and this is definitely a recipe I'll use again and again.  Thanks William for this recipe and for all of the others you have submitted to this site!

I followed another reviewers suggestion and used half brussels sprouts, half baby carrots.  The topping was really good and did not over power the flavor of the veggies.  I ommited half the butter by not tossing it with the veggies before topping.  I bet this topping would be good on many other veggies, especially broccoli and cauliflower.

Awesome recipe! I never thought I'd love brussels sprouts! Now I do. I made them twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. The second time, I cut the brussels sprouts before tossing them in the butter & adding the bread crumb mixture. This way they absorbed more of the butter & yummy bread crumb flavoring.

I made this for Christmas dinner. My husband loved it. Mee too. The kids even ate it without complaining, like usual with plain sprouts. I haved the recipie and added an extra cup of baby carrots.  I didn't use the butter to stir in with the veggies.  Just for the topping.  Turned out great.  Will make this again soon.

These were so quick and easy! They tasted fabulous too! This is now my new favorite way to eat brussel sprouts and I will be making them often. I used seasoned bread crumbs and left out the seasoning salt because I didn't have any but they turned out great.

Absolutely loved this recipe and have already made it twice.  So easy to make and so tasty too!  Also, really appreciated the tip about the "x" on the stems--had never heard of this but it did work.  This is a keeper.

This was very good. I substituted broccoli for the brussel sprouts. This would be good with a lot of different vegetables.

Scrumptious! I cut the butter in 1/2 & this was still fantastic. Will definitely be saving this recipe. Thank you William Anatooskin :)

Very quick and easy way to prepare a tastey alternative to plain brussels sprouts with butter.  I used frozen brussels sprouts cause that's what I had on hand and I bet its even better when they're fresh!  Thanks for the recipe

These are amazing! My fiance and I both love them. Even my 3 year old and four year old think they are good. I always add 1/4 cup extra Parmesan cheese though. I don't add garlic powder or the seasoning salt as I don't think it needs it. Oh, and after boiling put Brussels sprouts on paper towel to dry or else you will have water in the bottom of your baking dish after broiling.

I cut this recipe down to 4 servings to sample it before I made a larger serving for Thanksgiving... wish I would have made the full serving, it was delish !!! I thought I hated brussels sprouts, well at least I did as a kid. Yum Yum Yum ! 
I do have a question though, what can I use instead of butter to make it vegan, without losing the great butter taste ??

I didn't care for these. I thought they were quite garlicy. I made the mistake of using the frozen bag and defrosting them only. I thought they were a little hard and could have benefited from being boiled for 3-5 minutes or so, even though they come blanched when frozen. I don't use the broiler too often and almost burnt these. I wish the directions would have said to broil on low. Once these go in the broiler do not leave them. I will not make these again, as I am plenty happy with brussel sprouts steamed with a little butter, which is a lot less work and tastes great.

WOW!  I love Brussels Sprouts, with just a little butter, but these were AMAZING.  My 3 yr old ate three servings!  I will certainly fix this again!  Soon!! Instead of the 4TBSP, I just used 1/4 C each & frozen sprouts cooked according to pkg directions.

A nice way to prepare brussels sprouts! It made a great side dish to my dinner, unfortunately my breadcrumbs were a bit stale so hopefully next time it tastes much better! I give it 5 stars because I am confident that if my breadcrumbs had been fresh the dish would've been tastier!

well i have to say im not a brussel sprout fan, but the hubby is, and let me tell you, before i even got to the last step into the broiler,he had to have a taste lol. I did change it a little because I did'nt have bread crumbs so i used panko instead, which is a Japanese bread crumb and alls i can say is yum yum yum!!!!!

these sprouts came out so tasty! next time though, i will cut them at least in half if not in fourths. they were just a tad big to put in your mouth all at once. i used frozen sprouts instead of fresh because thats what i had on hand. i put about 10 sprouts in individual ramekins, perfect for serving just two people.

These were really really good! It's my first time eating brussel sprouts. I always thought they would be bitter. But for some reason, this batch were really yummy! No trace of bitterness. 
I blanched the sprouts in salt water (1 tbsp of salt + boiling hot water that covers the veggie for 2-3 mins., then transferred them into an icy water bowl for 1 min and drain). 
Then I followed the rest of recipe to the T. I also cut them in half before I served them because they were really big. *thumbs up*

Great side dish for the holidays! I would like to agree with a prior review that the recipe could use less butter. I may also add garlic cloves next time instead of garlic powder to get more flavor. This is why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. Otherwise, this dish was delicious and I will definitely be making it over the holidays with these changes. Oh and by the way, my husband, who hates brussels sprouts, said these were "pretty good!"

Truly enjoyed this variation on sprouts. I love sprouts but I was amazed at how good this was and how different it made the sprouts taste. I omitted the salt and seasoning salt and used garlic salt instead and I added a squeeze of lemon just before it finished baking. My new favorite recipe! Thanks!!

I'm giving this a 3 simply so I can meet somewhere in the middle.  Despite what others had said about non-likers of brussels sprouts even liking these, I loathed them, however, my husband, who is a liker of these little guys, loved this recipe.  All in all, apparently a great way to prepare this veggie for likers/lovers of brussels sprouts...not so much for those not fond of them.

These were fabulous! The only thing I did was to adjust the ingredients based on a 2 lb. bag of Brussels Sprouts because that's what I had. Yum, Yum, Yum! These went so fast that I didn't even get a picture! No problem, I'll be making these again for sure! Thanks for the terrific recipe. No need to change a thing. Very Tasty.....

WOW!! Honestly, I love brussels sprouts and I've tried a million recipes, but I have never made such a great recipe that everyone loves (even my picky husband)!!!  The only thing I did different this last time (for a special occasion) was to add a little extra butter to coat the sprouts after boiling them. And I did not double, but definitly added a little extra to step 4.  Make sure that they are a little more than golden brown after broiling and you will have people begging for the recipe.  Thanks William! I am from a family of chefs so this put me ahead last christmas!!!

These were good, and easy to make.  Watch them in the broiler, though.  My burned quickly.

This was good, but I had to add extra breadcrumbs and cheese to the top.  There wasn't really enough to coat the brussel sprouts.  I still like brussel sprouts and butter the best.

Wow!  These were awesome! The only change that I made was that I used a clove of garlic rather than garlic salt.  Next time I would cut the Brussel sprouts in half so that they could soak up more of the bread crumb mixture.  I will definitely make this again.

These were delicious.  I followed the recipe except I baked them instead of putting them under the broiler because I was baking other things.  Next time I'll take the time to fire up the broiler for a few minutes.  I think that would have made a much nicer crust on top.

My husband really liked this recipe. We dont have brussels sprouts often because of the bitter taste but  with this recipe we didnt notice it.  We will make this one again maybe next time I'll add some baby carrots.

Okay but not spectacular. I love brussels sprouts anyway they come to the table, but this didn't win over my reluctant eaters. Stick with simple roasted sprouts--tastier and saves time and money

Couldn't get any fresh sprouts, but boiled frozen sprouts for 4-5 minutes, then made as written.  I thought they were very good (but I could have eaten the topping all by itself).  It's definitely not the brussell sprouts I remember as a kid.

These were a huge hit at Thanksgiving. They cooked perfectly, stil firm but tender. I used Italian bread crumbs.  I accidently burned them when broiling, but then just pulled off the outer burned leaves and nobody could tell.

I saw this recipe a while back and couldn't believe breading would work on Brussels sprouts.  I finally gave in and tried it and let me say...YUM!!  The Parmesan cheese really makes this.  My super-finicky six year old tried one; hated it.  But my husband and somewhat-finicky teen LOVED it!  The only thing I did different was to cut them in half.  I'm a big fan of Brussels sprouts and these will appear on my table frequently!

These were "okay". We still preferred the "Roasted Brussel Sprouts" from Allrecipes the best.  Might try it again and just cook them similar to the other recipe.  The breading and cheese went well with the taste of the sprouts.

This was a very good way to dress up brussels sprouts for people who don't really like them.  Personally, I eat them plain, but this recipe was a nice change.

These were 'out of this world'. I followed whats his faces advice and steamed them instead of boiling. Have made these a few times now and once in a hurry I fried them in butter after coating them. This was a nice change also, added a crisp coating.

This was pretty good. You must like brussel sprouts. I doubt you could fool a person who didn't like sprouts already into liking them. This was good and we enjoyed it

This is a fantastic way to prepare Brussels sprouts. I cooked them in a little chicken broth till tender, then added a few splashes of soy sauce along with the butter, as suggested by an earlier review. The topping is delicious and the soy sauce adds a nice dimension to the flavor of the sprouts themselves. My children--who are NOT fans of this vegetable--each had an extra helping. Pretty impressive! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I have never really cared for Brussels Sprouts (my mom always called them Martian Heads), but my husband loves them.  When I made this dish tonight, he said they were the best he has ever had.  I substituted Italian-spiced pre-made bread crumbs and therefore eliminated the seasoned salt, and boiled the sprouts for 5 minutes (not 6), and reduced the butter by half. And even I loved them!  I'll make them for the Thanksgiving table.

This was a new addition to our Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone raved about the brussels. Even those who don't usually like them were impressed. This will be a big family dinner keeper!

This is similar to a recipe for green beans my grandmother often made growing up, I adapted it to brussel sprouts.  I use olive oil instead of butter.

I made this exactly as the recipe says, except I used a parmesan garlic butter spread I have.  This was an awesome way to do something different with Brussels Sprouts!  We have them at least once every other week, so I needed a little shake up...and this was exactly it!

This is an excellent recipe. To get better coverage of the bread crumb mixture, I tossed the sprouts in the melted butter and then into a bag filled with the crumb mix. Love this recipe!

So easy and quick ! I cooked the sprouts cut in quarters, directly in a frying pan with the butter and one glass of salted water - 6-8 minutes. When no water left, added the parmesan cheese, garlic croûtons, NO GARLIC and lots of lemon pepper. Serve hot !

I normally hate brussel sprouts but my hunny loves them. I made these to try and make us both happy and it knocked out of the park. They were amazing. The had a nice flavor and I actually had seconds. I only made half the recipe since it is just him and I and I used frozen brussel sprouts instead of fresh since it is what I had on hand. I did still boil the but not for the recommended six minutes it was more like four.

Good change of pace from my usual brussel sprout cooking...which is the steaming method, then I add butter, Dijon mustard, salt and pepper (all to taste, don't really measure ;o) To change this one up, toss steamed sprouts in Dijon mustard and omit the butter, then top with seasoned Panko crumbs and broil.

this is my new go-to recipe for brussels sprouts!  this would be a great way to turn someone on to B.Sprouts for the first time.  i seriously couldn't stop eating them.  i did not change much.  i did not boil them for a full 6 minutes, because i like my veggies pretty under-done.  i also used Panko Japanese Breadcrumbs instead of regular breadcrumbs.  i wish the topping had a way of sticking better, but i cooked them in a very low-sided pyrex that was JUST big enough to hold them in a single layer, and that seemed to contain the topping well enough for me.  i am fine with some topping falling off, because it gives me a chance for sneak-munching the fallen crumbs from the pan when i am supposed to be cleaning up.  after this one, brussels sprouts have replaced broccoli as my favorite veggie.

I chose this side dish to complement my turkey dinner this past Christmas and it was a hit! Absolutely delicious. I used more bread crumbs as a substitute for parmesan (personal preference) but either way I'm sure it will please.

You know I was nervous about fixing these because though I love brussel sprouts not everyone does. But I still decided to fix them for Thanksgiving and they were a big hit among adults and children. Everyone said they never had brussel sprouts like those before and came back for more. The only thing I changed was using seasoned breadcrumbs. Beware though..I was fixing like 5 diff dishes at a time so I forgot about the sprouts and they got too done and some broke apart. It was okay once I got them in the pan and covered with the topping but just be careful of your time because they can get mushy.

Four starts for the quality plus a bonus star for ease of preparation!  I found it works better by drizzling ALL the butter on the sprouts in step 3 and then mixing the dry ingredients with no butter in step 4 before sprinkling over the sprouts, followed by a light tossing before placing under the broiler.  Very tasty.

If you use a dash of ground nutmeg in the water, it removes the bitterness of the sprout and adds a nice "new" flavor.  The seasoned crumbs make a delicious addition to this underrated veggie.

These were good, though the added ingredients imparted only a mild addition to the overall flavor of the dish.  Overall they were enjoyed by the kids and adults in the family and I will make these again.

I won't be making this again. Maybe it reminded me how much I actually don't like brussel sprouts, which is strange because I love all other vegetables. Nothing special about this recipe.

I love this recipe!  I am a huge fan of brussel sprouts and this was a delicious twist.  I ran out of time so I didn't get to broil them for more than a couple minutes, but they were still amazing!

These were just okay.  We love the shredded brussels sprouts recipe on this site much better.  To make this recipe better, I would cut the sprouts in half or more so that the ingredients blend more and would mask the bitter taste of the sprouts.

Terrific!  This is so simple and easy.  I followed the receipe excatly, except for the way the brussel sprouts are actually cooked, and everyone loved it.  I always cook my veggies in the microwave. Just a quick trim and then I throw them in a plastic container with about a tbps of water and steam perfectly in the microwave.  This recipe is easy enough for every day, fancy enough for a special event.  Thanks for the recipe.

WONDERFUL recipe!!!  So yummy!  I first boiled them in chicken broth, then doubled the amount of cheese/breading mixture and it came out perfect!  Even non-loving brussels sprout eaters raved about it!  Must try!  Thanks for the recipe.

Wow, very good!  I had about 2 feet of sprouts on the stalk from my CSA, so I don't know how many pounds that was.  They took more like 15 minutes to boil to tender, however, and they were still al dente.  I followed the rest of the ingredients exactly, with the exception of 1/2 the pepper (I only used 1/8 tsp).  DH, my 5 YO son, and I loved them.  My 3 YO daughter was not impressed.  :)  I will do these again!  Until a few weeks ago I didn't even know I liked brussels sprouts!

I glad a saw this recipe. We enjoy roasted brussel sprouts, but these were even better.  My son did not admit to liking them, but he ate them without the normal amount of complaining-- which means that as far as brussel sprouts go, in his book, they were as good at it gets.

I think we left these under the broiler a little too long so it was probably our fault that even though the flavor was good, the sprouts were just too dry. At the price I paid for them it was a shame to have to throw some out.

My four year old thought brussel sprouts looked intresting in the supermarket and wanted to try them, so we tried this recipe.  Turned out great.  My parents, who said that brussel sprouts were nasty, thought they were great and even had seconds.  Loved the cheesy breadcrumb topping and will definately make again.

This recipe was great!  This recipe really makes the most out of brussel sprouts and cuts down on some of the bitterness.  

The only thing that I changed was the butter.  I melted 2 tablespoons of Brummel & Brown to mix with the breadcrumb mixture.  I also used no-calorie spray butter to spray over the brussel sprouts.  This cut back on calories and I thought that they still tasted fabulous!

Brussels Sprouts are one of my most favorite vegetables, so of course I had to try this.  I only use fresh, never frozen (ick... too mushy) and I prefer to steam them in my veggie steamer.  Very tasty indeed!  I really loved the effect the broiling had on the sprouts - browned, almost beginning to char.  That's probably my oven, since it started to do that even at 4 minutes.  I've got a keeper with this recipe!  Thank you!

Super-tasty!  I find it works better if you cut the sprouts into quarters before putting them in the baking dish -- it's easier to coat them with the breading, and thus makes them more palatable for non-sprout-lovers.

This was delicious and very easy to prepare.  I used frozen brussel sprouts, which I cooked in the microwave for about 5 minutes. Then, I made a mistake and poured all the butter over the sprouts, instead of reserving some of it.  After I realized what I had done, I just sprinkled the dry mixture over the top and stirred it in, then cooked in the oven set to "broil" for about 5 minutes, stirring once. The result was great! My daughter raved about them, but she loves sprouts anyway they are prepared. My husband says he hates brussel sprouts, but even he ate these!

These were very good and so easy.  I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband had 2 helpings - and I've never seen him eat brussels sprouts before.

Everyone loved this...even a few who said they didn't like brussels sprouts! We wanted more of the breading so next time I'll try to coat them thicker. Thanks

Very tasty topping! My first time trying the brussel sprouts and I'm thinking I'm not a big fan of those though.  Will use again with different veggies!! TY!!

Loved it! I had a frozen bag of steamable Brussels sprouts, so I used that instead of fresh. The topping gave it great flavor and crunch, and was a quick way to jazz up steamed vegetables. I halved the sprouts so the cheese/bread crumbs would stick better and be easier to eat. Would eat it this way every time!

I liked it--but I love brussel sprouts--any which way they are cooked.  Tried as written.  GOOD BUT FATTENING!    Next time I made it I lowered the butter to 2 tablespoons  also that is ALOT of breading-- only used 2 tbs parmesan and 2 tbs bread crubs, more garlic powder. a tad Better for you.   Husband liked (and he is not fond of brussel sprouts at all ).  So that was a win but personal I would rather just have them roasted or boiled with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper.   But everyone has a different taste palate.   This would be good to make if you are just introducing brussel sprouts to kids!!

This is my basic recipe for MANY vegetables and how I get fussy eaters to eat them. You can also sprinkle slivered almonds on top before baking. Also frozen Brussels Sprouts (or any green vegetable) can be cooked in the microwave before going in the oven with the toppings. Easy, peas, tasty.

Delicious even though I made the mistake of getting it ready ahead of time.  Should have just baked in oven rather than broil as not quite hot enough.

My husband LOVES Brussel sprouts. When his kids were growing up he called them Martian heads, so that's what we call them. I'm always looking for new ways to make them. So far, this has been his favorite, and mine as well!

I have been trying to find additional ways to make brussels sprouts besides the traditional bacon/onion way. This one is definitely a winner! This will be a staple for me. Next time I might try roasting them first instead of boiling.

Loved it! This is one of those recipes that are simple but elegant, the perfect combination. Let everyone think you slaved away all day long to make it. ;-) The only change I made, and only because I was out of bread crumbs (which is rare),was to use Buttery Garlic Ritz crackers . It's heavenly with them! I won't be using breadcrumbs with this  again. You won't be disappointed if you make it. Now to try this with broccoli or cauliflower or green beans or carrots. Cant wait!

Absolutely delicious.  For those of you who find a bitter taste as well as a bitter aftertaste, it's a genetic marker.  You'll never like them no matter how they're cooked.  Use another vegetable and they'll be delicious.

This was very good. I also halved the sprouts before boiling and didn't boil them too long at all because I don't like them real soft. Very nice.  And don't skip the butter, that's key!

This was delicious! I typically cut the brussels in half and steam them first in a bamboo steamer instead of boiling, which produces the same result. I've had this on cauliflower, broccoli, carrots... just about any veggie you can think of, and it's all been fantastic. I add a little extra parm because I like it, but it's perfect as-is also. Definitely recommend this for kids or other picky eaters.

This is sooo yummy, thanks for posting! My husband and I grate a little fresh nutmeg over the top just before serving. Not only does this enhance the taste but it smells so good too!!

Very good. This was the first time I had fixed/eaten brussels sprouts and they were so yummy. Make sure to keep an eye on them when they're under the broiler, they go from done to burnt very quickly.

Fantastic!  I used Italian seasoning breadcrumbs, and therefore skipped the salt. I think the original recipe would be better, but Italian breadcrumbs were all I had on hand, and plenty good. I will make these at least once a week. Am planning to try on broccoli as well. I've no doubt this is a great way to make any vegetable more appealing.

Loved it!  My family gobbled them up.  I served them along side the swiss chard and garbanzo bean dish (also from All Recipes).  My family begs me to make this dinner all the time.

Excellent way to dress up Brussels Sprouts to make them more edible. (Though not the healthiest way). Needs less time in the broiler (or lower)....cheese burned on top.

Wanted something different for a Thanksgiving vegetable...this was great!!!  I did use the suggestion to add carrots because it was a better color combination.  So very simple, yet the topping made such a BIG difference.  I will definitely make this again but I will not wait til Thanksgiving!!!

Love this recipe. I tried it one Thanksgiving to have something new and fresh on my menu. People just love it and call me well before thanksgiving to make sure im making them. The funny thing is the anti brusselsprout people are the ones that love it the most.

This was a great way to serve and eat brussels sprouts.  The family asked for seconds.  My four year old still didn't like them, but getting a 12 year old to eat them made it a keeper.

We don't generally like brussel sprouts, but I wanted to try preparing them in a different way.  We thought they were pretty good, better than usual.  If we are going to eat brussel sprouts, this is the recipe we'd use.

Served this with "Italian Breaded Pork Chops." I used the remaining breading from the pork chops after adding ingredients originally not in the recipe. I steamed the brussel sprouts, breaded, and baked. After baking, I then added the butter on top. Tasted really good.

My husband just discovered he likes sprouts, and he loved this. My kids enjoyed it as well. I seasoned a little heavier, but that's just my taste. I added to my recipe box, and wrote a review... so that means it was great!

This did not excite me, though I do like brussels sprouts.  It just didn't seen to be worth the effort.  They would have tasted better just well buttered in my opinion.

I actually for one, love brussel sprouts, bitter taste and all. I personally didn't like the breadcrumb ingredient. Would've enjoyed much better without and just melted cheese butter and spices. Just a personal taste for me. overall good recipe.

Yummy, Yum, Yum. I never before liked brussel sprouts until trying some of the recipes on this site and this is by far my favorite way to prepare them. I do add minced garlic to the blend instead of garlic powder and I add onion powder. I also use frozen brussel sprouts as it is easier and they still come out great every time. Thanks.

So good!  Children actually eat these and enjoy it!  The only alteration I make is to steam the brussels sprouts in chicken broth, rather than water.  Takes away any bitterness there may be.

The flavour was not bad but we weren't too crazy about the breaded topping.  Felt more like we were eating a casserole and not a side dish.

I'm a Brussels Sprounts fan.  I like them in their basic form.  

However, I was impressed with this recipe.  The seasons provided just the right flavor, and offered variety from the usual fare.  

The recipe was simple, with ingredients that were readily available in my pantry.  The result was delicious.  I'll make it again in the near future.

Fabulous taste--even with bagged frozen sprouts. I omitted the seasoned salt. Next time, I'll add some white wine. Even though it's a total misnomer, I'm dubbing it "Sprouts Scampi."

These were really good; the breading gave the spouts a really nice flavor.  Thanks for the recipe, William.

I cooked in microwave instead of boiling.  I usually put spray (fake) butter on them then parmesan cheese.  With this recipe I had extra stove top (dry) and put that on top instead of the bread crumbs.  It was delish.
Thank you for a new way to make brussel sprouts.  They are a staple at our house.

WOW! These are fantastic. Only had a 14 oz bag frozen brussel sprouts so scaled the recipe accordingly. Will make more next time b/c they were gone too quick.

This is okay. The flavors have the potential to be great, but they just don't go w/brussel sprouts. My parents love brussel sprouts & they didn't even care for this. It's just a matter of personal tastes I guess.

These were good. I love brussels sprouts, but it was my first time making them. I accidentally undercooked them a bit, and then the breading burned a little even though they were only under the broiler for 2 minutes. Obviously my fault, not the recipe's. Everybody got a kick out of the fact that I managed to make something that was under cooked and burnt all at the same time. I am probably going to get teased about this for awhile!

These sprouts were very good. I used shredded Parm rather than grated and the cheese didn't melt so well. Next time I will use grated. I still liked these... I have never met a brussels sprout that I didn't like!

Like Catthorn, I'm trying to eat seasonally and inexpensively. Plus, cruciferous vegetables are as nutritious as all get-out, so I'm attempting to add them to my diet. This recipe is delicious, buttery, crunchy, and in no way bitter. Confirms that brussels sprouts aren't just for holiday dinners! Can't wait to try the recipe with b. sprouts and mustard sauce....

We just made these Brussels sprouts after I found this recipe. As I suspected, they were great, and a far more interesting serving than the usual "steamed with butter" fare. Nice and nutty with a little crunch.

This was really good. I doubled the recipe and added sliced potatoes boiled for 6 minutes for one half of sprouts. Then tossed everything together in butter, then tossed with breading. I loved the way it turned out with exception of the taste of the sprouts the next day. I will make this again.

Reading reviews prior to making recipes ALWAYS pays off big dividends.  ATOMICLUSH really cracked me up -- I'm a big brussels sprouts fan!  I steamed my sprouts (just personal preference); & used Italian bread crumbs w/cayenne pepper for a different twist.  Have ready on your tableservice some lemon juice.  Try this one!

I love brussel sprouts and had to try this recipe.  I used frozen sprouts and steamed them before adding the topping and broiling.  My only problem with the recipe was the topping was to wet, and it was hard to spread over the top with out it glumping up.  Guess I should have just added more bread crumbs.  I think next time I will add a bit more spices also, you really couldn't taste them.  I still haven't met a sprout I don't love though!!!

I have had brussel sprouts before, and this recipe did not please me, I think because the casserole was to big, but my husband who has never tasted them absolutely hated the taste, would not reccomend, unless you are absolutely a brussel sprout fan.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving...came out pretty good..next time I'll probably try to use a lil more butter or something to get the breadcrumbs to stick to the sprouts better. And the addition of a little soy sauce was perfect, my fiance told me this is definately a keeper.

Okay.  Probably won't make again.  I used a casserole dish that was too large and the crumb/butter topping was too spread out.  Didn't get crunchy under the broiler.  Just had sprouts covered in buttery-cheesy mush.
