to all those sad, sad people who said these wings need breading: come on folks! you are missing out on a world of opportunity by limiting yourself to wings w/ breading! there could be no lime and garlic wings, there could be no jerked wings, there could be no bar-b-que wings if we limit ourselves to breaded wings! besides, half the fun of breadless wings is the scorchingly spicy sauce just DRIPPING off of naked wings and getting on your hands and around your mouth. (But then, i'm from texas, not buffalo. we like our food hot here.) perhaps the hot sauce you used just isn't up to the job. i mean, you use different sauces for different things, right? the sauce i put on my barbacoa is not the same sauce i put on my fajitas, which, in turn, is not the same sauce i use on my wings. all I'm sayin is that this recipe deserves a chance. don't blow it off cause you used the wrong sauce....

I was looking for a basic wing recipe and found this one. I had to cook them for more than 8 minutes though. I used honey bbq sauce for the kids & my wings & used bottled wing sauce for hubby. Everyone loved them. This will become a regular on our menu as we really love good wings & haven't been able to get really good wings where we live now. Next time I will cut the wing sauce with butter for the boys & I. Thanks.

YUM!!! We used BBQ sauce in place of the hot sauce for the kids, and they loved them! All the more kick left over for the parents' wings! :) These are super close to Long Wongs wings... which, if you ever get to Mill Avenue in Tempe Arizona, I HIGHLY recommend you try!

This recipe is a solid 5.  Very good.  I have to say that I did make a small change.  I started out following the recipe exactly, and did make it exactly, however, I used Frank's Red Hot "Thick" Sauce.  However, the butter separated from the sauce so I spooned out the butter and added more sauce so, if you use the Frank's Thick sauce, you can save a whole bunch of calories by not using any butter at all.  Friends loved it.

This is about as basic as buffalo wings can get.  Not original, but not bad.  One reviewer commented on the consistency.  If you prepare the sauce on the stove, whisk in a cornstarch slurry, then add to the freshly fried wings, you'll find yourself a much thicker sauce that will coat better.  If it were me, I'd have a higher sauce to butter ratio and add in a few spices, too.

I don't know if I did something wrong or what, but these just weren't that great.  The sauce didn't want to stick to the wings after being fried.  Although they were edible, I don't think I'd use this recipe again.

These were very good. Just like you get at a wing house.

I was not happy with these wings.  The sauce was too runny and didn't stick to the wings. The wings (minus the sauce) didn't have any flavor.

It tasted good but was a mission to make. We made this in a pan and the oil kept splashing out and it became a hazard to all. We tried the Hot Sauce and decided that we would make another platter with BBQ sauce which was much better. Because of the problems with the oil we ended up just sticking them in the oven. The oven is a much easier way to make this recipe if you don't want to go through the hassle of trying to deep fry them without a deep fryer. Also you can use drum sticks as well as wings.

These are the best wings I have ever made, and everyone I have ever given them to loved them and asked for the recipe! The only thing I do different. Is bake the wings instead of fry them
