6..15.17   This recipe’s name is almost a misnomer because it’s more than a stuffing, it’s a wonderful side dish, as well.  This was positively the perfect side kick to some Baked Cod with Fresh Lemon Pepper and steamed broccoli.  The orange juice and zest really work some magic in this dish, and the result is flavorful, harmonious, and mellow rice, a side dish that will not overwhelm whatever else you're serving with it.  We really enjoyed this recipe, and I'll be making it again.

The recipe was very simple and tastes great! I'm just not a huge fan of citrus in my stuffing. That being said, if I paired it with the right entree,  it would probably be perfect!

It made more rice than I expected but we just happened to have a family gathering that evening. So the two of us were saved from eating rice for days.  We served it cold and everyone liked it.  The changes I made were replacing the butter with coconut oil and I used two oranges for juicing, and only one for zesting. 
I toasted my pecans on parchment paper on a cookie sheet, in the oven at 300 for 10-15 minutes.  We will definitely be making this again and it would be a great side dish for get togethers.

Loved this rice! I was worried the orange might be overpowering, but it was mild and added a delicious flair along side our grilled pork. This was so easy to make and is a great way to  "fancify" a simple side.

We LOVED this rice! Great flavor and we really enjoyed the crunch of the toasted pecans. My only thing was that this took a little longer to cook (for the water to absorb) than the recipe called for, but maybe I measured the water wrong??? Not sure, but it was no big deal either way, the rice was delicious and I will def be making it again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
