Absolute fave. Eggs not neccessary. Cake turned out moist and yummy did need a bit longer than recipe stated. Was in for almost 1hr and 15 mins total.

I noticed there were NO eggs in this recipe, so I added one. What a disappointment . The edges were baked and the middle was complete mush...even after I put it back in the oven for 40 minutes!

My first time baking with persimmons.  Really good. Very easy to make. I saw comments about added bake time, wasnâ€™t necessary.  This now a favorite.
