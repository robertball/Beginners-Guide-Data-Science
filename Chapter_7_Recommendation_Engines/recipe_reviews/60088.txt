Not a horseradish fan, so I left it out. I left everything else exactly the same but I added an egg since one or two people said the burger fell apart while cooking. I also think a key to holding it together is keeping it cold until you are ready to cook it.  It was really a good burger and moist too.

I wish I could give this one 6 stars.  Very well done.  For my own personal taste, I will add more horeradish next time.  The flavor really melded together well.  I had no problem in the burger staying together.  Also, I fried them on top of the stove and they turned out fantastic.

Update:  Made these again last night and added 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke, 2 glugs of A1 and 1 T of the horseradish (DH said go ahead).  Even DH could not taste the horseradish, so I'll definately add the whole 2 T next time.  Man were these good!  Original: These are gonna be so great at the lake this summer!  Was so excited to try the horseradish, was going to make half without for DH and half with for me, & I forgot to add it to mine.  They were still wonderful! Can't wait to make them again w/the horseradish.

I made this for dinner tonight and my red meat loving husband said it was the best hamburger he's ever had! They were juicy with just a hint of bacon. I did add an egg, with splashes of wostershire, A1, and Liquid Smoke, with slice cheese on top. This is the ONLY hamburger recipe i'll use from now on!

Great burger! My husband loves bacon and cheddar so I had to give these a try. I cut the amount of horseradish in half because I was topping these with a horseradish sauce. I added 1/2 tsp. of liquid smoke and had no trouble with these holding together. I got three really nice patties. These were delicious on toasted rolls - YUM!

My husband loves burgers, I'm not a huge fan, but we both loved these ones!  I served this with additional extra sharp cheddar on top and didn't change anything in the recipe.  The burgers were moist and very flavourful.

I absolutely love these hamburgers and we eat them all the time. They are so easy to make and they are bursting with flavor! 

I like to add even more horseradish then is called for and I always throw an extra handful of cheese in for good measure!

I'm not usually a hamburger person, but I really liked these.  They were very moist and tasty. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I cut down the horseradish a bit. Next time, I'll use the full amount: while it smells strong in the raw burgers, it wasn't at all overpowering.  Also- left the meat (90/10) in the fridge until the last minute and the burgers stayed together nicely while grilling.

Good burger. My comment to all -When grilling, try putting the oil or cooking spray on the meat instead of the grill. A hot grill will immediately flash or burn off the oil. Cooking spray works really well with chicken and if you've done much grilling it has a tendency to stick every time. js

D-lish!!! Omitted horseradish because dh doesn't like, but we really liked the taste. I think the cheese really softens up the burger. Will be using again! (and again!)

I had 8 hungry souls (most of te family) over for Father's Day, only missing my daughter and her child. Of those 8 - 3 decided no burgers and took hot dogs.  I had made 17 burgers in all, and cooked 14, freezing 3 for later.
I used 2 1/4 pounds of ground beef with 1/2 pound of bulk ground pork sausage. I doubled (or slightly more) on the rest of the ingredients. I used a full package of bacon, cutting it into 1/4" pieces. Once the bacon was done, and cooled in the refrigerator, I diced it so the flavor was there, but not big pieces (that stick in between teeth).
Grilled them for 6 minutes on one side, and about 4 - 5 minutes on the other side, until I got a 145 F or more reading on the meat thermometer.
My 10 year old granddaughter was the first to taste them, and she could not stop complimenting me on the taste. Even my 87 year old Mom tried them and loved them, although she is a hot dog person right now.  
The last change I made, was to use Dietz & Watson Cheddar cheese slices with pepper flakes in the cheese.  The extra hot flash made these a favorite of my son and I. I will make these again and again, swapping with my Southwest Green Chili Burgers, every other time.

Delicious! I also used an egg to help keep it together and instead of bacon bits I amped it up with real bacon... chopped it up raw and mixed it in with the hamburger meat before making it into patties.  Keep in mind this one is NOT for the dieters out there!!!

These burgers were awesome!  I "grilled" them on the stove and they were super yummy.  Can't imagine how much better they could be actually grilling them.  The horseradish was the extra kick and the bacon a nice surprise in every bite.  To keep them from falling apart, I shaped the patties then put them on a plate in the fridge for about 45 minutes.  Worked like a charm.  Hubby would give these 6 stars if he could!

I thought these burgers had great flavor, even with leaving out the horseradish since I didn't have any. Perfect on a bun spread with just a little mayonnaise & topped with lettuce.

Absolutely love this recipe!  We make it every time we make burgers on the grill and wouldn't change a thing.  The horseradish gives it that extra kick and who doesn't love bacon and cheese? Even the kids want seconds!

I came across this recipe a couple of days ago and have been dying to try it ever since. Our frigid weather, however, has made grilling hamburgers outdoors a dumb move – but where there’s a will there’s a way! With a few minor adjustments to the recipe I was able to make this indoors with no muss and no fuss – as a meatloaf! I adjusted the recipe to two servings, to use 1/2 pound ground beef. I used fresh minced garlic rather than garlic powder and added 1/4 cup of minced onion. To bind it I added 2 tablespoons each of bread crumbs and milk and 1/2 egg (lightly beat an egg and measure out 2 tablespoons). I formed it into an itty-bitty loaf, topped it with some darn fine barbecue sauce, and baked it on a foil-lined cookie sheet at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. I let it set about 10 minutes before slicing it up. Each of the signature ingredients of cheddar cheese, horseradish and bacon (I used real bacon, cooked and crumbled) were barely apparent but the combination of them united to create something unique and special. I’m glad I was determined to make this recipe and simply improvised to do so. This was a real treat, something to remember when the weather is more cooperative to make as a grilled burger on a bun. When I do I’ll omit the binders – the milk, bread crumbs and egg, but I’ll keep all else the same, including my additions of minced onion and barbecue sauce. It is the bacon, cheddar and horseradish, however, that are this recipe’s delicious distinction.

Fantastic burgers. The only changes I made were to use hand-grated cheddar (instead of the pre-shredded kind) and to add some Worcestershire sauce and a little chili powder. I pan-fried the patties in a little olive oil and topped them with sliced cheddar on potato rolls.

I made a homemade sandwich roll recipe and wanted a good burger to eat with it.    I made exactly as directed with one egg added to since some reviews said it would help keep burger together.  It made the best homemade hamburger I have ever had.  By leaps and bounds better than any other I have made.

All I can say is YUMMY! I did add an egg, with about a tablespoon each of worchestershire sauce and A1. I did not add any horseradish. Super juicy and flavorful! Will make again and again. Thanks Lisasnow!

These are very tasty.  Also good when leftovers are used in dishes calling for cooked ground beef like tacos, burritos or casseroles.  Note to self- add 1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke and serve with a slice of cheddar on top and horsey sauce on the side.

I don’t know why these work, but they do! My guests commented on the juiciness of the burgers and several were amazed they contained bacon bits, which they hate.  I recommend using ground chuck vs. ground beef, since the cheddar provides plenty of juice. Also cuts down on grill flare-ups. I also used a red & black pepper mix for just a little extra “kick” and a good season salt.  I cut the buns, buttered both sides and grilled them on a griddle just before adding the burger. A very memorable burger!!

I made these almost exactly as written. I used small cubed pepper jack instead of grated cheddar and used 5 pieces of crumbled freshly cooked bacon in leiu or bacon bits. Next time I will OMIT the 1/2 teaspoon of salt as the bacon and cheese have enough salt to season the burger adequately. The horseradish gave the burger a fabulous zest but you cannot taste that tell tale horseradish taste. My husband hates horseradish as a condiment but could not tell what gave the burgers that great zestyness so go ahead and use the full 2 tablespoons! I mixed the cheese, horseradish, bacon and spices all together with a wooden spoon. I then added the ground beef, 4% fat, and mixed until very well combined. Since some complained of the burgers falling apart I put the burger in a ziplock and put it in the freezer for 20 minutes, then made patties and got them on the drill immediately. I had no issue with them falling apart what so ever. This is a very tasty recipe that I will certainly use again.

Very good taste, but as other reviewers have noted, they didn't hold together very well.  I'll have to try them with an egg next time.  We don't grill in Wisconsin in January, so we cooked these in our All-Clad ridged skillet; pre-heated well, then 4 minutes on each side.  Will definitely be making these again!  Thanks for the recipe!

The others that I fixed this for said it was great tasting for them.  I guess it was only me that thought it would be spicer.  But thanks for the recipe, at least I didn't starve to death.

VERY GOOD!! Very moist and flavorful. I mixed in onion, bell pepeer, bacon, mushroom, shredded mozzarella and garlic into the patties and then grilled them on the george foreman. I did also follow other readers reviews and mix in one egg with the meat to hold it together. DELICIOUS!!! Using 1.5 pounds of ground beef plus all the veggies ended up giving me 6 good size burgers. Served on buttered & toasted buns! YUM!

I liked these burgers. They are really different. I don't even know how to describe the taste? Its sort of like a burger with a smokey cheese on top. I couldn't really taste the bacon or horseradish distinctly. I used sharp cheddar and made sure to buy the real bacon bits. I used lean beef, lined a rimmed baking sheet with foil, and broiled them on high after spraying with a little oil. After flipping, they started to splatter a little as oil from the bacon bits and cheese started to release. Possibly heating the bacon bits briefly and drying off excess oil or changing the foil when flipping would have possibly helped with that. If broiling or using the bbq just be careful. I don't normally have that issue, broiling burgers, always buying the leaner beef. I served them on wheat buns with regular condiments, lettuce, tomato, and red onion. I would try these if desiring a burger with a different taste. I made slightly smaller burgers and got 8 at 142 calories each or about 350 calories with a wheat bun and condiments. Note: Even though these dont taste salty, the bacon, cheese, and added salt, left me awfully thirsty. It also really smoked up my oven the next time I used it. I think I will save something like this for the grill.

I make a very similar recipe, except, I fry some chopped onion with the bacon and use horseradish cheddar cheese.  I also FREEZE the cheese before I add it to the burger, takes a little longer for the cheese to melt....which makes it a bit less messy.

Who doesn't love bacon and cheese? Especially on a hamburger. I thought this would be great cooked over an open fire on our Memorial Day weekend campout. I used lefover bacon from breakfast that I cut into small pieces with scissors and I inceased the garlic powder to 1 teaspoon, added 1 teaspoon onion powder and used seasoning salt. I also used medium cheddar cheese. Unfortunately I didn't have any horseradish sauce (not a huge fan but I can eat it) and that is probably what would have made this recipe great. I was disappointed that the bacon and cheese flavors didn't shine as much as I thought they were going to. If I make again I will either add the horseradish sauce or maybe a splash or two of Worcestershire sauce and I think I would increase the bacon and top the burger with the cheese instead.

These burgers were great! Very flavorful and just a little spicy. They were easy to mix up and actually stayed together when grilled. Since these already had lots of flavor there was no need to pile on the toppings - I just used mustard and a little bit of lettuce. I will definitely be making these again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Yummy but greasy. Lots of grill flair ups. I felt very full eating 1/4 pound burger. I was nervous about the horseradish, but it made it flavorful and moist.

I don't have horseradish, so I didn't use that.  Kids and husband loved these, as I thought they would, knowing how much they all love their bacon.  I am going to have to take their word for it that these were good, as I didn't have any.  This is a nice, simple way to jazz up some hamburgers.

I made a few modifications, because I didn't have the horseradish, so I put A-1 as another reviewer suggested.  I would like to try it as the original recipe writes, but wanted to review it, as the base for the recipe is STELLAR!  It was a hit for the whole family!

Best burgers ever!  Definitely use the horseradish, you really can't taste it in the burgers but it adds unbelievable flavor!  I cooked these on the grill with the coals banked and the lid on, but vents fully open.  5 minutes per side and they were perfect!  Melted cheese on them immediately afterwards. I served them on potato rolls with an avocado/mayonnaise mix, tomato and onions.  My boyfriend went insane!

I made these last night for dinner while grandkids are visiting through Easter. Followed the recipe except for "garlic" and added 2 teaspoons of plain ole mustard. Went to get my camera to snap a photo of burgers which was holding a place of honor among all the condiments, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, onions and when I finally found the camera and got back, 4 of the burgers were already on a bun and being seriously worked on by  folks who you'd think had never had a burger! Next time... and there will be a next time!  Thanks for sharing.

I doubled everything in the recipe except the horseradish so I could make 8 patties. I probably used more than 2 lbs of beef since I do have enough extra to make at least 2 more patties. This was so delicious.  I cooked mine on the stove. My 11 year old gave it thumbs up so it's kid tested and approved lol.

I've made this a couple of times, and it tastes amazing and so juicy and flavourful. I julienne the bacon and then cook it. I love having the cheese cooked right into the burger. I have to reduce the horseradish a bit because my son doesn't like it to be too strong. Oh, and last time I didn't have any regular horseradish, but I DID have Onion Blossom Horseradish sauce and it was INCREDIBLE.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!! New top burger recipe :) I added a dash of worcestershire, extra shredded cheese, included the fat rendered from the bacon and topped with a slice of pepperjack cheese... on an onion bun... had to use a fork- that was fine with me!!!! Be sure not to overcook.... it was SOOOOOOO moist!

Really good burgers. I left out the horseradish since we are not fans of it. Added some fresh parsley and a diced chipotle pepper to make up for the kick of the horseradish. I know they aren't the same but its what I had. Thanks!

I made these the other night, and they are absolutely awesome.  I made it as is, but only had a combo cheese with cheddar, jack, cream cheese shredded together.  Yummy

I also used my own homade buns, which complimented these burgers well.

Fabulous burger! I put the burgers on my home made hamburger buns (which are strong enough to contain a juicy burger like this one). It takes a little more prep but the extra time is well worth the effort. I followed the recipe exactly including the horseradish and I wouldn't change a thing.  The burger didn't even need condiments.

this is really a great hamburger I just hope the lady that said it was too salty realizes she mentioned tablespoon and not teaspoon as the reciepe called for if she confused them it would most certainly be to salty;to her I say try it again it is great and we all make mistakes in cooking otherwise there would be no new recipes for us to enjoy

Best burgers I've made yet.  I made them as written except instead of bacon bits (didn't have any) added two slices of finely chopped bacon (raw) and omitted salt.  Served them to guests and they raved.  Flavor was outstanding.  This will be my standby recipe from now on.

Great burgers, but next time I will leave the cheese out of the patties, and put slices of cheddar on TOP of each burger before they are done. Great flavor, though!!!

OK...I changed this up by using ground turkey but the flavor was still so great that the rating will still be high. I didn't measure anything...just eyeballed it. I had about 1.5 lbs of ground turkey and knowing that it can be a bit bland, I added extra of each spice. I made 6 patties out of it. I grilled them on my George Foreman and they turned out GREAT!! Thanks so much...

I doubled the recipe but didn't double the horseradish because my hubby doesn't really care for it.  Even he said it could use maybe a bit more added next time.  These are really good!!!  I will be making them again.

I made these tonight and quite enjoyed them. As per other reviews I added 1 egg yolk to the mix and kept it cool until cooking on a cast iron frying pan. They stayed together and tasted yummy...oh and I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.

my whole family says that I make the best burgers in the world when I make these. They taste great bbqed or fried. I am nor a horseradish fan so I leave that out and since we are bacon lovers I use real bacon and add a little extra in the mix. My husband has been known to eat them cold the next day too.

I'm sorry, but I did not care for these burgers. I was tempted to tweak by adding, but I opted to follow this recipe to the letter. My review is based on this exact recipe. The horseradish and cheddar flavors were both lost. There was some sort of "taste" but nothing good. We love all the ingredients in these burgers, so I thought they would be good. My family was terribly disappointed with them. This is my first one star rating as I usually try to find something positive to say, but even one star seems like alot for this recipe. I used good quality meat, but even the flavor of that disappeared and melded into some foreign and questionable taste. I should have tweaked, but then my review would not have been for this recipe as it is written.  I am admittedly fussy about my burgers. The best base for any burger- (which I was tempted to add to this)- uses an envelope of Lipton Beefy Onion Soup Mix, some worcestershire sauce, and a little water.

I dislike it when people change things and then review it but I'm going to do it anyway.  :)  This is a very juicy burger.  I made a few changes based on what I had in the house...I was missing horseradish so I used a two leftover Arby's Horsey Sauce packets, I was missing bacon bits so I fried up some regular bacon and crumbled it.  I added a few things based on taste...an extra 1/2 cup of cheese, about 1/4 bread crumbs, 1 egg yolk and a few dashes of Worcheshire (sp).

I just made these for my kids and their friends a few nights ago and hesitated using the horseradish because of the strong flavor.  I read some other reviews and decided to use it anyway.  The kids gobbled them up and wanted more.  They asked me to start making their burgers like that now instead of the way I used to make them.  With the horseradish it allows you to use very lean meat because it holds the burgers together.  Great recipe!  Thanks

Every single bite was surprisingly delicious.  Used ground venison instead of beef; otherwise, didn't change a thing.  This is now our favorite hamburger recipe.

Great recipe! My friends always love it when I make these. If you have any trouble with them falling apart, try leaving out the bacon bits. They stopped falling apart for me. I think they are better without the bacon bits anyway. This gives you a chance to use real sliced bacon if you want to. Also, I left out the shredded cheese. I found that I couldn't taste it anyway. I love cheeseburgers, so I just added a slice of cheese after grilling the burgers.

This is a great recipe. I wanted to make something super simple last night so I tried this. Even though I used my new George Foreman grill and cooked them a little too long, they were still great!! I'll definitely cook this again, only this time make the burgers medium/medium rare....Delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, these were soooo good! I used lean (93/7) ground beef and fresh garlic (doubled the amount of powder in recipe). They hardly shrank at all and turned out perfect and juicy (even the leftovers) when cooked per the instructions.

I served them on lightly grilled, buttered chiabatta roles with mayo, thick-sliced tomato and pickle; plus, I threw on a slice of cheese for extra goodness.  These were quick and delicious! Will stay home and cook these the next time I'm craving a burger - they're definitely better, and probably quicker, than most any burger out there! They remind me a lot of a great burger at this little BBQ spot in Venice Beach; except they use bleu cheese in their burgers and top them with lincolnberry mustard sauce - whatever that is (besides delicious). This IS my new burger recipe!

Even without the horseradish, these were juicy and delicious, and held together well on the grill. Next time, I'll add chopped onion, as I think they'd grill well with the cheese and bacon bits.

I used mayo horseradish, which worked just the same. I didn't put the cheese in the hamburger. Instead we put it on top. The buns were "Simple Whole Wheat Bread" from this website.

This was absolutely delicious! I added a 1/2 tsp. worchestire sauce, a tsp of seasoning salt, and a Tbsp. cold water because after adding the bacon and cheese, the texture of the meat felt a little dry. Served on onion rolls with BBQ sauce. Great flavor!

I wanted to find a recipe where you stuff the meat patty with cheese, but this one topped that plan!  I didn't have any bacon or horseradish, but I used some Worchestire sauce and garlic powder, as well as the cheese.  I did put the mix in the freezer for about 15 minutes before forming the patties and this helped.   I cooked the burgers in a pan and they came out nicely enough as it was too cold to go outside and grill.  Our whole family loved this and we will make it again, especially when I can grill 'em outside!

We omitted the horseradish, and used 1/2 jar of real bacon bits.  Everything else I measured as the recipe says. The next time we make these I will cut the garlic powder to 1/4 tsp, and I may cut back on the salt too. We didn't care for the heavy garlic flavor in our hamburgers.

Very good.  I did not have enough bacon, so the bacon flavor was not as pronounced as it would have been had I had what the recipe called for.  I can't wait to try these with the proper amount of bacon bits.  I used ground turkey for a lower-fat spin.  If you use ground turkey or lower fat ground beef, be prepared to add a little water to the skillet to prevent the meat from burning.  If you are looking for a different, yet tasty twist on the plain label burger, this is recipe is a great choice.

Very flavorful. I was afraid 2 Tbsp horseradish would be too much. Was not so. Next time I might just put more in. I'm cheap enough to cut up my own bacon strips for the recipe. I will make this again.

Many compliments.  I fried up some peppered bacon and used that.  Didn't grill them as it is very cold outside, but I bet they are more fantastic grilled.  Will most likely make again.

These were great.  For all you lazies out there: I had no bacon bits, so I put raw bacon through the food processor until chopped very fine and added it raw to the burger meat and other ingredients.  They turned out fine and the bacon flavor was quite good.

Not bad, to me the horseradish didn't seem to "go with" the cheddar and bacon flavor in the meat.  Not a keeper for me.

The other reviewers were correct...easy and delicious.  We don't eat red meat very often but with out-of-town company coming over for a barbecue, I wanted to make something "kid" friendly but use different ingredients than the traditional "egg" and "breadcrumbs."  These burgers were easy to prepare and received rave reviews.

Excellent!  I added a little more cheese than the recipe called for as well as a splash of Worcestershire (made it a little juicier since I used leaner meat).

I used fresh bacon and then cut it into tiny pieces.  I kept some of the bacon grease to fry the burgers in.  I also added an egg to help hold this together.  While the burgers were incredibly juicy, I felt like there needed to be a bit more zing to them.  Next time I will add more cheese as I didn’t feel 1/2 cup was enough because I could barely taste it and I will add some A-1 or Worcestershire sauce.  Overall they were good as written.

This was the best burger recipe we have ever tried.  Tried many and never found the perfect one.  2 thumbs up from hubby and both kids.  They all said we should never buy packaged burgers again.  Amazing flavour and very juicy even with lean ground beef.  Definite go-to burger recipe from now on!!  Thanks for sharing!

This is a really great moist burger I think I used more horseradish sauce then called for, but then I also had more ground beef, oh and turkey bacon instead of bacon bits, because I needed to use it up.

Sounded too simple to be as delicious as the the reviews were claiming, but I was proven wrong.  Excellent recipe, but I did use real bacon and omitted the horseradish sauce.  I'm not sure what the best percentage ground beef to use.  I used 80% and was very juicy and delicious.  Can't wait to make again.

OMG!! Wonderful recipe. I added 1/2 tsp liquid smoke and an egg as suggested by other reviewers, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Very juicy, cooked medium. I also served it with Burger King sauce used on the whopper that I found online. Easy to make and perfect with this burger. May just have the burger for breakfast tomorrow served as what's called "Loco Moco" here in Hawaii. It's a patty served over hot rice, a cooked egg to choice on top and brown gravy. Can't wait!! Mahalo for sharing an awesome recipe!

Made it with the bacon bits. Sautéed some onion and added. It was great Plan to make again without the bacon, but with the onion.
Everything else worked fine.

Added 1/2 teaspoon onion powder and based on one of the other reviews a couple tablespoons of A1 sauce.  Probably the best hamburger I've ever had.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Followed the recipe to a "T" and did not feel that any ingredient in particular stood out. It was just a good, moist-tasting burger with just the right amount of seasoning. I made it with 80-20 ground beef, which I usually use on burgers for the grill and it was delicious. I will definitely make this again.

absolutely the best hamburger I've made...I did make a few changes. I used 1lb ground bison, 1lb ground beef and 1lb fried bacon. These were sooo frickin' good! Don't be afraid of the horseradish, it is not nearly as strong as it smells.

This was really good. I undercooked them at first and then put them back on the grill and over cooked them. Strictly user error. Will definitely try again.

Beef, Bacon, Cheese, Horseradish...all in a burger... need I say more. As the recipe goes this turned out to be a delicious and filling burger. As for the Horseradish don't hesitate to use it in the recipe, it is not overly spicy. Went well with a baked potato and some cold pasta salad. I will use this again as is, i will also add my own spices to it.  There is a lot you can do with this particular recipe

I made it in the skillet on the stove and it still turned out great.  The only change I made was to add an egg like others suggested.

Absolutely delicious!  The only change I make is the size of the burgers.  They're a little too big, following the recipe.  Still delicious, though :-)

This was truly over rated. I asked my husband how he liked it and his comment was"you've made better". I thought it was pretty ordinary and can't understand the rave reviews.  I expected it to be as good as a bacon cheeseburger with everything in the burger.  Next time I'll make my reqular burgers, with onion soup, bread crumbs and egg and top them with cheese and bacon.

So yummy!  I add a little Worcestershire, A-1, and liquid smoke.  I make them early in the morning and then let them sit in the fridge until time to BBQ at dinner.  Don't usually have a problem with them falling apart then. My family absolutely loves them too!

Soooo yummy! I substituted the ground beef for 1 pound lean ground white turkey, added 1 egg to keep the burgers together and kept it to 1 tbsp of horseradish. I was told these were the best turkey burgers several of our guests had ever add and I woiuld definitely agree. Thanks for sharing, these were amazing!

I gave 4 stars for the flavor, but took off a star because the burgers fell apart on the grill. I've never had that happen before, so I have to assume it has to do with the ingredients. I'll probably try again and add an egg as a binder.

I am rating this 5 stars for the versatility of this recipe.  Will be making this for dinner this evening and I already know what changes I will be making.  Will be adding 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon onion powder and no salt.  All the rest of the ingredients will remain the same.  Will post later how we liked the burgers.


Update....We both thought this burger was excellent.  Had to make one more change and that was the bacon bits.  Had to use some precooked bacon that my hubby fried on Sunday.  Only had enough to make about 1/3 cup.  Next time we have these will be adding more horseradish.  Excellent recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

The horse radish and cheddar gave this burger a enhanced flavor.  My family didn't really notice the bacon but we used a precooked bacon.  We also loved that the cheddar slightly crisped up on the outside of the burger.

I didnt think the horseradish would be to great so i didnt use it and next time i will use less garlic powder, if you use to much garlic it overpowers the taste of bacon but otherwise that this is a great recipe that i will use in the future. I used real bacon i didnt have bacon bits.

These burgers were very moist!! Not nearly as tangy as I expected I guess because of using the creamy horseradish, but delish none the same! I'm sure the bacon would add to the flavor, but really didn't miss it since I didn't have any. Did add an egg, some onion powder, worcestshire sauce, A-1 sauce and liquid smoke. Very good recipe!

These were great. Even my husband, who doesn't like anything other than salt and pepper on his burgers, liked them. I didn't have bacon bits so I topped them with strips of precooked bacon instead. Thanks for a great new burger.

These were absolutely yummy! I did not have any horseradish on hand so I just made them without. They were so juicy and full of flavor. I was looking forward to having a left over one the next day after work only to find out my husband ate all of them!!!

Update.. 11-7-10.. tried it with the horseradish sauce this time  and it added a suprising good 'zing" to the flavor...(I detest horseradish sauce). Next time I was out of "real" bacon so I substituted like 1/8 cup of baco's ( i know...shock) but it added a great flavor the real bacon bits did not.. in the future I think we will definitely make it with the horseradish but sub baco's instead!

LOVE THEM!  LOVE THEM!  Even better warmed up the next day!  Don't skip the horseradish, it really adds something, and if you do don't rate this recipe because it's not the same.  I served mine with a slice of melted cheddar on top, and toasted the buns.

Left out the horseradish, and they were absolutely delicious! Cooked them for about 5 minutes on the George Foreman grill, and turned out perfect.

I made these for Memorial Day and my family snarfed them big time. I followed the ingredients very closely--but at the last minute, I cooked them in a cast iron pan instead of on a grill. Definitely a keeper.

WOW! Definitely the BEST burgers we have ever had! The only thing I did differently, I added a beaten egg to the 1.5 pounds of ground beef and a added the extra measurements per the extra meat. DELICIOUS!!!!

Made this for dinner last night and wow these were tasty.  Instead of using bacon bits I used real bacon chopped up,  once I cooked the bacon I just cooked the hamburgers in the same fry pan.  One thing though is I would omit the salt next time as the bacon added enough.

I love trying new & different burgers all the time and this one will become one of my favorites!  I didn't have the horseradish so I used some dijon mustard and A-1 Steak sauce instead.  Turned out just delicious!  Can't wait to make these again!

Excellent burgers!! I declined the horseradish, it's not my favorite. I didn't measure anything and just basically seasoned it to my taste. I probably used twice the cheese and would suggest that the more bacon you use - the better! Cooked them in a skillet and no problems keeping the patty together. This is going to become a regular at my house!

These were excellent! Only change I made was fresh garlic rather than garlic powder because I did not have any. My horseradish was extra hot, so 2 TB was enough for flavor. Will make these again!!

These burgers were excellent and a big hit with the kids! So easy to make and a lot of flavor. We have made these a few times since I found the recipe, each time exactly as posted. We also used a more expensive ground sirloin as a nice treat and cheaper alternative to steak, this compliments the flavors of the ingredients amazingly. The only change I would like to try is a very sharp cheddar and shred it myself.. I think I would love the extra kick. Thanks for this recipe.

These burgers were quite good, however, I'm still on the quest for the ultimate burger recipe.  Made as written, with the exception of adding a few good shakes of our favorite BBQ sauce to the mixture.  Love the horseradish, for a bit of zip.

Good, but nothing surprising... actually less bacon and cheese flavor than just adding it on at the end... I didn't get hardly any horseraddish so I think I'd need to double it.

Great burgers! I used only half the amount of liquid smoke called for. I thought of adding an egg to help hold them together but went with one tablespoon of olive oil instead. Will definitely make these again soon.

These are wonderful exactly as written. It really bothers me when people rate a recipe poorly but change the ingredients or amounts in the original. Try the recipe as written first before you rate it!   The second time I made instead of adding the shredded cheese to the ground beef, I stuffed about a half ounce of cheddar to the middle of the burgers. The first time I grilled these I felt most of the cheese melted out of the burgers on the grill. I also increased the horseradish to 3 tablespoons because the flavor was too subtle with just 2 tablespoons and we like horseradish. I also drained the horseradish a little so the burgers would hold together better. Either way I’d give these 10 stars if I could!

These burgers were very tasty.  My 5 year old tends to be a little picky about home made burgers (not like McD's) but she loved it and even ate an entire one vs. just half.  Great flavor and smelled great cooking too!

Delicious!  I added an egg to the mixture cuz I feel it holds my burgers together better and I used real bacon.  MY BF couldn't get over how cheesy and good they were.  We will definitely be making this again.

I doubled the horseradish, and added a finely diced jalepeno and these were good. I even froze a couple wrapped up well and they recooked excellent!

This was delish!  I left out the bacon cuz I'm not a fan and didn't have cheddar cheese so I used mozarella.  It was the best homemade burger I have ever had!  I am gonna make this again!

Too much horseradish! I was skeptical about the horseradish considering its strong taste, and not without reason because the horseradish overpowered these burgers. Make sure you are a big horseradish fan before trying these! I only cooked a pound of these hamburgers, thank goodness. I would advise toning down the horseradish for just one pound of hamburger. My hamburgers also turned out to be more of a meatloaf texture instead of a hamburger texture, which is what I was expecting. Will not make these again.

These were great burgers.  I didn't have any problems with them falling apart.  I did make sure to use REAL bacon because I'm a bacon purist (!) and mixed everything together very well.  The second time I made these, in place of the worcestershire sauce, I used some steak sauce and they were even better!  And we love cheese, so in addition to the cheese in the mix, I placed a slice of sharp cheddar on top of the burgers right before I pulled them off the grill and they were awesome!

These were great, and I appreciated the short list of ingredients. The horseradish flavor is more prominent than the bacon flavor, but we liked that. When these were on the grill for a few minutes, the cheddar started to melt, causing the grill to get smoky. This isn't a bad thing. Even more great flavor!! We topped with carmelized onions, lettuce (to make it healthy), and tomatoes. This one stays in the recipe box.

These burgers are SO good! I get SO many compliments on them everytime I make them. I add extra bacon and cheese though it's not necessary and don't worry about the horseradish, you can't taste it. I even add extra because I love horseradish. The burgers do not fall apart if you refridgerate them for 20 minutes or so after forming the patties, no egg is necessary. Great recipe!

My husband LOVED these!  I thought they were good but a little rich.  I made them as written with the exception of using sharp cheddar cheese (maybe that is why they were rich?). I also added a little minced garlic.  I agree with those who said they were a bit salty.  Next time I will omit the salt. I used extra lean ground beef and I had no problem with the burgers falling apart.

I made these for the first time several weeks ago, and now my husband requests them all the time!  I tried using bacon bits the first time, but it didn't taste much like bacon in the burger and left strange red 'dots' in the meat - it looked like the meat was uncooked in spots (and it was cooked).  So we always use real bacon crumbled up now.  
The topping we love is my moms bbq sauce mixed with mayonnaise - it's amazing!  Totally don't need ketchup when you do that, and it goes perfectly with the taste of the burger.

I did not use horseradish, icck. I added garlic salt and parsley to the meat. Instead of putting cheese and bacon bits into the burger meat, I added a slice of cheese and two slices of bacon on each burger.

I found 1Lb. of hamburger for 4 servings to be a bit small. I cook for a bunch of guys and they all complained that the burgers were way too small. Wasn´t sure if the "real bacon bits" were something sold in a jar or chopped up fresh bacon. The burgers tasted pretty good though.

These were really good and easy to make.  I broiled them since it was 0 degrees outside and they turned out great in the broiler.  The only change I will make next time is to omit the salt - a bit too salty for my taste.

Had these the other night. Great flavor. A little salty though. I did add more cheese and bacon as some others stated it was not cheesy enough. I think the saltyness was from the added bacon. Will be making this recipe on a regular basis only minus the extra bacon.

Great burger.  I saw the horseradish and knew my husband would like them. He was skeptical when I was mixing it up--but he loved them.  I used Ground Chuck (80/20)and made sure that I pressed them together hard when making the patties.  They were juicy and flavorful--a keeper recipe.  Thanks for sharing it.

I was skeptical about the horseradish but I used the full amount anyway. Once the burgers were cooked no one could really even tell it was there. I didn't have enough bacon so I only used about 1/4 cup and I added a splash of liquid smoke as others suggested. They were a bit salty so next time I will skip the added salt. They were still quite tasty and I will definitely make these again.

We loved these!  I used 1.25 ground sirloin to make 4 good size burgers and also used real bacon instead of bits - I buy pre-cooked bacon from Sam's Club so it was easy.  Grilled them, then toasted the buns on the grill, too.  Delicious!

These are a nice change from the everyday burger! I didn't tell DH there was horseradish in them, what he doesn't know won't hurt him, and he never made a peep. He did say they were good though- and I agree.

We thought these were a nice change even though we do prefer a plain ole burger with all the fixin's.  I think the 80/20% ground beef works best to keep burgers such as this from falling apart.  I do think next time I will save the cheese for the top because even using sharp cheddar I could not taste it much.

wow, what a great burger! it's amazing how well the flavors in this recipe blend together. i didn't have any prepared horseradish on hand so i used a tablespoon of pure horseradish (to 1 1/4 lb. ground beef) instead. the kick is subtle but i noticed perspiration on my neck & brow half way through dinner ~ lol! delicious served with a little extra cheddar on top & grilled onions. extra yummy on a kimmewick roll. many thanks lisa!

Cannot believe how great this recipe is! A little bit of extra work using real bacon and crumbling it, but SO worth it! I have used wasabi horseradish for an extra kick, and my family LOVES it!

These were delsh,  I used fresh bacon and ground turkey,  I added beef boullions to give it a beefier flavor. I also added liquid smoke and A1 sauce as others suggested.
YUMMY

Very good, I absolutely loved them. I made extra and cooked them also for leftovers. When I warmed one up in the microwave the next day, it was just as good as the night before. Great recipe!!!

I thought this was a really flavorful burger.  I only used a 1/2 piece of bacon (because I burnt the rest chasing my 14-month old)-still really picked up the bacon flavor.  Definitely give it a try when you're in the burger mood.

I made these in hope that my husband who doesn't eat vegtables would love these burgers since all he eats on burgers is bacon and cheese,  not the case.  They were okay but nothing special where I would not make them again.

Very good!  I doubled everything except the horseradish to feed our family.  I think this was right-on and the full amount of horseradish would probably be overpowering for us.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Hubby really liked them.  He isn't usually up for trying new recipies but i think we may use this one again.  I followed all the directions exactly except left off the bacon (he's not a fan) I had no trouble with it falling apart or being dry.  He gave them a 5!

Very good. We omitted the horseradish and used bacon pieces from the pouch. I still think I like hamburgers with a slice of cheese and bacon on top. Thank you.

This was awful, very tough and nasty tasting. I did not have the horseradish and substituted worstershire sauce. Plain hamberger is better than this.

The only thing I changed was adding an egg to help keep the hamburger patties together. Besides that I kept everything the same and it was fantastic! Definitely one that I’ll keep for the future.

Not impressed, we thought it was too salty. If I make this again, I will leave the salt out. The bacon bits add enough salt.

Great recipe. I altered it to my taste a bit and also chose to use strips of bacon rather than bits in the mix. I added Montreal seasoning, rosemary and parsley flakes.

Loved theses burgers!!  They will be my go-to from now on.  If you don’t love horseradish, don’t worry.  It doesn’t overpower, but leaves a subtle zip.  I may add even more next time!

For a family of five I used three pounds of ground beef taking the patties would shrink. They didn’t. Also added the liquid smoke, A-1, and Worcestershire sauce. For flavor, volume and to make it hold together I added Lipton onion soup mix, bread crumbs, and egg. These burgers were awesome. Moist, juicy, flavorful and my picky eater kids devoured them. I have an extra batch for another meal in the freezer. Definitely going to make again.

just made these and doubled the recipe except for the horseradish we are not a big fan of horseradish so I just added what the recipe actually called for and instead of grilling them since we haven't replaced our grill yet so I fried them on the stove. my family devoured them, even my youngest son who is a very picky eater asked for seconds which is a huge deal. so this recipe is definitely one I will be making again.

These are excellent hamburgers.  Although some of the ingredients would be overpowering alone (thinking of ya, horseraddish), in this recipe they blended well and no one overpowered another.  I followed the ingredient portions exactly; no need to add anything.  Used 80/20 ground beef and kept the formed patties in the fridge for 90 minutes before grilling.

These are good burgers. I didn't have bacon bits, but I did happen to have some bacon. So I fried up half strips of bacon and served those on the burgers. Delicious. I'm not a huge fan of horseradish, but it gave a nice tang to these burgers.

Another great recipe, though it's not Summertime, here in San Diego "Grillin" is unfortunately ...... uhhhh Year Round ..... Sorry! Recipe is moist and juicy, followed as directed, though I added a bit of Worcestershire,  a touch of milk, Italian Panko Crumbs and  let sit over night flattened with a thumb print in the middle and this is good to go on any type of bun with the usual fixings ... Thanks again for the recipe!

Made a couple changes (one by accident), I used real bacon instead of bacon bits and I also tossed in about an ounce of whiskey. For some reason I thought the recipe called for whiskey but after I had done it I re-read the recipe and saw that it didn't. But it didn't matter because the burgers turned out great! I will definitely add the whiskey again next time. Made three patties instead of four since the bins we had were pretty big. Will make again!

I didn't have horseradish so I can't give a 5-star rating because I altered the recipe. I also added an egg to help keep the hamburger from crumbing. I thought these were excellent hamburgers (I am quite picky when it comes to hamburgers and don't usually like them as they are generally overcooked and dry when cooked at home) but these were moist, flavorful and super yummy. I will definitely be making these again and again in the future!

They turned out great however I made the mistake of using ground chuck instead of beef. They tried to fall apart during the cooking process. I also melted more cheese on the top after flipping them.

Was looking for a good burger recipe and decided to try this one.  Great decision because they became the hit of the evening.  I saw reviews where people added eggs to keep everything moist.  While I like doing that as well, it is not necessary.  The key for me was making a ball out of the mixture and then flattening it to a desired thickness, then reshaping the outside a bit until it it is round.  I then seared the outside on both sides before cooking them to temp.  Enjoy!

Made per recipe.  I did  grate a good sharp cheddar and browned bacon slices to crumble up.  I also used home made horseradish.  Enjoyed these.

Yum! I doubled this and served to family on the 4th of July and everyone enjoyed them. I added a little Worcestershire sauce and left out the horseradish per our personal tastes. I also added a couple eggs as some other reviewers have recommended and they stayed together well and turned out great. Will def make again.

My whole family really loved this burger recipe. I did add a dash of steak sauce as well as a dash of liquid smoke, otherwise I prepped it as it is written. It was juicy and easy to make. I'll make it again.

Great!!!  Followed recipe as written, but instead of store-bought bacon bits, I cooked 4 pieces of bacon, chopped them up and added it to the mixture.  I had no problem with burgers "falling apart".

If one considers a burger, bacon and cheese, what can go wrong? Well, nothing. I dressed our burgers with thinly sliced avocado and drizzled Ranch dressing lightly over the whole thing. No bun. I served the burger with sweet potato French fries and fresh asparagus. Quick, simple and magnificent.

This was an awesome burger!  We used half 80% Angus and half  90% Angus burger.  Made exactly per the recipe and it was perfectly seasoned.  We love horseradish so next time we may increase that.  Will definately make this again!

Very good, but omit the salt if you're using real bacon. I followed the recipe, but used 4 slices of bacon (thinking 1 slice per burger) and it was waaaay too salty. The next time, I still used real bacon, but omitted the salt and they were perfect!

Very good!  We didn't have horseradish and substituted spicy brown mustard instead.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  I used 85/15 ground beef and the burgers were very juicy and yummy.  Thank you for sharing!

A super-tasty improvement on plain hamburger! 
We followed the recipe, except used real bacon which we had on hand, cut into quarter-inch cubes and fried.
Formed the patties, then pan-fried 5 min each side.
Served with cooked sprouts, and rye bread, this made a dinner meal.
A big success! Certain to be repeated.

This was very good.  Added an egg, some worchestershire sauce, a little extra bacon (cause of course) and chilled for about 20 minutes after mixing before grilling.  When I grilled, they still fell apart a little bit, even with the egg and after chilling the meat.  I left them alone after the turn and they firmed up pretty well.  No issues after that.  Definitely will be medium well or well in you want them intact, I think.  Very good though.

These were good, but nobody raved about them. Followed the recipe to the T, but couldn't really taste the bacon, cheese, OR horseradish sauce, which was disappointing. Plus, they shrunk significantly. I'll probably keep this recipe but will definitely try a few others before I circle back around.

These were delicious burgers.  I read other reviews, and added Worchestersire sauce, A-1, an egg, and liquid smoke.  Everyone thought they were the best ever, as I did.  Thanks so much for the recipe, it will definitely be used again.  And again.

This recipe is so good! I've made them on the grill and on a grill pan on the stove. both came out great! I did add a couple of shakes of liquid smoke and an egg. I topped them with Colby pepper jack cheese. they have so much flavor! I think I might try blue cheese next time. thanks for the delicious recipe!

I skipped the horseradish b/c I was making for two littles. I also used packaged (real) bacon bits. I'd make again with horseradish and real crumbled bacon.

Because my husband doesn't tolerate things too spicy, I only used 1 T. of horseradish.  He says I could have added a bit  more, but not too much more to avoid it becoming a dominant flavor.  I added an egg to hold the meat mixture together.  I didn't add the bacon, and it was not missed.  I cooked the burgers for 5 minutes per side as directed.   Although it was pretty well-done, it was not at all dry, perhaps because I used grass-fed beef.  Next time, I will cook it for 4 minutes per side, and see if we like it a little less well-done.  But I will be making this recipe again and again!

This was very good except for the horseradish.  I love horseradish with ham and roast beef, but I'm not sure I loved it with hamburger.  I've swapped the horseradish for either barbecue sauce or teriyaki sauce and both have tasted better in my opinion.  Everything else stayed the same.

The only thing I changed was to use real bacon crumbled.  These were extremely tasty.  My favorite thing about them is that not one flavor overpowered another.  It didn't taste like cheese or bacon or what I feared - horseradish.  It was just a blend of all the flavors.  Very good.

Thank you so much for posting such a easy and delicious recipe.  The burgers come out juicy and tasty.  I've already made these 3 times in two weeks.  The last time I added a little more horseradish than stated and loved them even more.  Thank you again.

I use a bit less salt and horseradish, but everything else is the same. My family adores these with Miracle Whip, tomatoes and lettuce. So divine.

Good but needs something extra... Onion or herbs. Couldn't taste much horseradish flavor even though we were using a strong one.

Taste of horseradish was overbearing, and flavour of cheese got lost.  The taste of bacon throughout was good.

This recipe was easy to make, and was a hit at a party I had. I do have one huge suggestion though... Instead of using bacon crumbles, fry 1lb of fresh (chopped) bacon, and use both the crispy bacon and the grease in the meat.

Best Burgers I've had in a long time... maybe ever! I followed the recipe exactly, except added an egg to help them hold together. It was amazingly flavorful and delicious! I'll definitely be making these again! :)

Best burger recipe ever! Don't leave out the horseradish; provides great flavor but no heat (our 17-month-old loved them!). I added an egg since I was using venison but otherwise recipe is perfect; will be our go-to burger recipe from now on!

I changed the recipe just a bit; because I don't eat pork.  I diced up the exact same amount of turkey bacon and fried till crisp before adding to the remaining ingredients. And OMG! ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! I don't eat burgers very often, but for now on when I do I will definitely continue to use this recipe. Thank you so very much for sharing.

Flavor was very good. I did add the A1 Sauce that was recommended. My pan was too hot and the outside was singed a bit.  Next time I will lower the temperature and cook it more slowly. I would make this again.

This has such good flavor. I left the horseradish out as I don't care for it.  I made them ahead of time and kept them chilled until I grilled them and they did not fall apart.  A keeper!

These were delicious.  I scaled back the horse radish just to test with the kids.  I may bump it past the 2 TBSP.  I also used real bacon.  These burgers came out sooooooooo good.  Had this is my recipe box for almost 3 years.  Kicking myself now for not trying sooner.  Fabulous burger!

This was great!! I omitted the horseradish and used real bacon (cooked crispy and diced small) in place of the bacon bits. My boys loved these burgers and I loved that it was all mixed together, and super easy to make!

Full of flavor!  My husband absolutely could not stop raving about this recipe.  We added Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce to the buns for a sweetness that complimented everything wonderfully.  I also cooked up some fresh bacon (rather than bacon bit pieces) and chopped it up small.

AWESOME!  The only changes I made were as follows...I used horseradish mustard, as opposed to just regular horseradish, I also cooked and crumbled REAL bacon and I did not use quite 1/2 a cup, I used a little less.  Turned out awesome!  I was very surprised that the burgers held together so well with no egg or breadcrumbs.  I grill 2 to 5 times a week(REAL grilling=charcoal) regardless of the weather and I consider these to be the best burgers I have made to date. Thank You!!

These were juicy and flavorful. Used an egg and put in the fridge as others have recommended. Added more cheddar on top.   Next time might mix in some jalapeños.

It was a good burger, but my squad prefers bacon and cheese as toppings rather than as ingredients.  Added an egg to help the burger stay together and had no problems.

Loved this recipe  I wanted something a little jazzed up since hamburgers can be so dull.  This is it.  It must be the horseradish.

We both hate horseradish, so we left that out.  Otherwise, my husband put this together, but ended up dumping in way too much onion powder for me (I would have preferred some fried onions or something), so I didn't care for them.  We're going to try again with me doing the prep work, and I'll update my review if they're better!

These are the only burgers I make now.  I follow the recipe exactly with the exception of using fresh cooked bacon vs. bacon bits.  Always gets rave reviews.  We like to serve it with sauteed red onion and avocado, but the meat is so flavorful, you could eat it with just a bun (or as a protein burger!)  YUM!

This recipe was delicious!! I had to leave out the horseradish because I didn't have any and the cheddar cheese. Instead I used an Italian cheese blend which is a blend of all white cheeses, such as parmessian, mozzeralla. And it blended the flavors together really well with the Garlic Powder..I can't wait to make it again. Also if you shape them into smaller sizes, it can make mini hamburgers that last a few days

There were very tasty!  I omitted the horseradish because I didn't have it in the house.  Next time I may cut back on the salt as it was a bit too salty for my taste.  Overall, very good and easy recipe.

Perfect Burger!

Normally I wouldn't use the bacon from the jar, but instead chop up a slice or two or raw bacon... today I just used a tablespoon of bacon fat.  Tasted wonderful, and should only be added to the leaner ground beef (93/7).

The garnish should be lettuce, tomato, thinly sliced yellow onion, and a big spoonful of special sauce (the one I make is a ketchup/mayo mix with spices).  Also the buns should be grilled about 1 minute where the burgers were to absorb juices.  Put the onion on the bottom bun and put the burger on top, letting the heat and drippings soften the thin slices for a more mellow flavor.  

Perfect burger!

This recipe is great...however one must understand if you salt to the hamburger when adding all of he other ingredients you will make you burgers a bit more dry...also, use ground chuck and you will enjoy these burgers a lot more as the flavor just stands out. Thanks for the recipe...it is a keeper.

These were really disappointing.  I made them for my husband's birthday and was expecting something really great, but they were just an average burger.  The bacon bits couldn't be tasted and the cheese in the burger didn't add anything.  I won't bother making these again.

Made these last night for the hubby. Only used 1 tbsp horseradish since I wasn't sure if he liked it or not. Replaced with a tbsp of worcestershire. Also, made the patties ahead of time and kept in frig until right before cooking. Had no problem with them falling apart on the grill.

I made these yesterday to bbq for my kids.  Instead of making 4 large patties I made 8 baby ones and served them on little buns.  I didn't put in horseradish since the kids don't like it and I added an egg to help hold them together.  I also put in more cheese then stated b/c I shredded too much!  My kids loved them!  Definately a must make again!

These were great.  I added an egg, but that's just because I'm used to doing that when making burgers.  Other than that, I pretty much followed it to a tee.  I think I may have added a little too much bacon, but hey... everyone loves bacon!

This recipe was a winner at my house.  I followed directions as written, and then topped with some sauteed mushrooms and a sprinkle of the shredded sharp cheddar.  The burgers were very moist, even when cooked to well done.  The flavors of the ingredients really came together; there weren't really "pops" of bacon or horseradish flavor, but a nice blend that added flavor and depth to the burger.  I love finding a new recipe that I know we will be using over and over again! Thanks!

This was an awesome burger! I used 85/15 beef, left out the horseradish, added a splash of A1, and used turkey bacon to make homemade bacon bits.

I made these as sliders for a kids birthday party and omitted the horseradish and added an egg as they didnt seem like they were going to stick together well. I also used real bacon crumbled up. They were very tasty and I would make them again!!

Very easy to make and delicious! I didn't use the horseradish because its too strong for me, but the bacon and cheddar was more than enough for flavor!

I made these for my family last week and they were very good.  My wife didnt like the bacon bits.  I used the real bacon pieces.  I also topped with a piece of cheddar cheese while still on the grill.  I loved them and will make them again. I served on toasted/grilled potato buns.

Although only my family at the burgers and left me no leftovers I have been told that they were excellent.  I put less horseradish in as the kids don't like it very much and they turned out excellent!

I didn't get to try any of these, but they all got eaten, which says a lot since we had a ton of meat at our bbq.  So, I'll say they must've been a hit!  I left out the cheese when mixing but topped with cheddar slices.  Worked very well.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe makes the BEST burgers! Instead of using bacon bits I cooked up 6 slices of bacon and crumbled them up into the mix, I also chopped up about 1/4 of an onion and put that in there as well.  You really have mix all the ingredients in really well but it's worth it! Oh, so good!!

I thought these had a great flavor and were very juicy. They are definitely a good change from the basic hamburger. Will definitely make again. Would have liked to taste the cheese and bacon more.

Excellent flavor. The horseradish isn't overdone, it's just a hint. Fairly messy on the grill but worth it.

These burgers were very good!   I didn't have the horseradish, but I am sure they would have been great with it. The only reason I didn't give these a five star because I think they would be excellent if you used real crushed bacon. The only time I could taste the bacon was when I got a large chunk of it, which tasted fantastic. So by making your own bacon bits, you wouldn't have so many tiny pieces and the true bacon flavor would be in every bite instead of dissappearing into the burger.

Great burgers! Whenever I tried to make hamburgers the meat was dry and tasteless even with spices. This recipe is moist, delicious and flavorful even with my necessary changes. No horseradish sauce so I used 1T of hot taco sauce. Along with the powdered garlic I used 1T of minced prepared garlic. I can't eat pepper or bacon but the taco sauce made up for any lack of flavor. Because it was mentioned the burgers might fall apart, I added 1 egg but then it was too wet. To compensate I added about 1/4 C of crumbled bread (rice and spelt), just enough to dry it up a tad. Next time I'll try without the egg and bread crumbs and it should be fine. As someone else said, it's probably because of the cheese. Excellent recipe - only tweaked for dietary reasons and what I was missing in the cupboard.

Funny - followed recipe exactly except for adding 1 egg to bind it - put more horseradish than it called for (love horseradish) - & yet, didn't really taste neither it nor the bacon bits.  Close to bland...

Husband liked these hamburgers. I used about 1.5 lbs of ground beef to make 6 patties. Served with "Belles Hamburger Buns," "Old Fashioned Onion Rings," "Pineapple Carrot Salad," and "Mom's Coleslaw."

Very good! Followed recipe exactly only cooking on stove. I love horseradish, but even I would cut down the amount by half next time and maybe up the bacon. Will make again. Thanks!

These burgers were good, but I didn't really taste a big difference in them and the normal burgers I make.  The horseradish left a subtle flavor that I enjoyed, but I didn't taste the bacon at all-- and I used real bacon! One of my guests said he could taste it, though.  I also added Liquid Smoke and Worcestershire.  Due to prior comments, I left the cheese out to spare my grill the mess and just added cheese on top.

The horseradish flavor stood out too much. I had no problem with the patty keeping its form, because I used all fresh cheeses. Just okay. UPDATE: Have made twice again and learned it's really good without the horseradish, and using 85% lean (15% fat) ground beef (nothing leaner) renders moist patties.

Got lots of compliments, but a bit bland for my taste.  Very juicy.  Next time I will add a little more horseradish and salt and add wors. sauce.

I made these for our fourth of July BBQ and everyone loved them. I also added about a tablespoon of minced garlic and a dash of wors. sauce. I used real bacon that I fried earlier that afternoon instead of the real bacon bits.great recipe, I will be making this again.

Great recipe.  I left out the horseradish and added about 2 shakes of liquid smoke.  My dear hubby thought they were good but his last comment was "I sure don't won't those everytime we grill burgers".  I have to agree but they are good for a change.

DELICIOUS!!! I thought it would be a simple burger by the ingredients but this burger was more than simple! I didnt have horseradish or baconbits but I did make some bacon and chopped it up. I added some worcestershire, liquid smoke, brown sugar, and crushed red pepper to give it a kick. It was absolutely delicious! Cant wait to use this recipe again.

Thanks for the great idea! Had to sub worcestershire sauce for the horseradish (my family isn't big on it), but I'll definitely leave the recipe as is when I'm just cooking for me and the hubby. Oh yeah - definitely use a sharp cheddar in this recipe. Delish take on burgers!

I used the horseradish, garlic, salt and pepper to mix into the burger.Then I topped it with a pretzel hamburger bun, with a little brown mustard spread on the bun. Had fried bacon, sliced extra sharp cheddar cheese from a block melted on the burger, lettuce, tomato [with a little salt and pepper] with choice of fried or raw onions. My family felt very spoiled. :)

As far as hamburgers go this was very yummy.  I didn't use horseradish, instead I used some Dijon mustard.  The whole family liked it much better than a plain burger.  It taste like what a burger is suppose to taste like.  I will use this recipe again.  It was very juicy too.

These burgers had the texture I liked, but the cheese all melted out onto the grill and made a mess.  We couldn't really taste the bacon either.  Thankfully the garlic gave a good flavour, but I felt I wasted a lot of time and ingredients.

These were wonderful!  I quadrupled the recipe to feed 5 teen boys, myself and husband, we just finished and they are all gone!  The only adjustments I made were to put the cheese on top, used fresh garlic and added a little onion to the meat.  Will put this recipe in rotation this summer, thank you!

This was a total hit.  My husband has been asking for them ever since the first time we made them.  Took others advice and added a little liquid smoke, since we couldn't grill and they turned out amazing!  Great recipe!

These were really delicious!  I was worried about the horseradish because when I made the patties, the horseradish smelled really strong.  I love horseradish but didn't want it to overwhelm the recipe.  Turns out, I could have added even more!  The whole burger was really delicious.

Great taste, very juicy. The Horseraddish is a nice touch to the taste. Might want to add a little more salt than recommended.

These are delicious, i usually eat about two bites of the patty of a homemade burger and then just eat the extra toppings.  With these i find my self forgetting the bun and eating more than one. I have also added onion flakes or a diced onion and that tastes really good to.

This has to be the best homemade hamburger recipe I have ever tasted. It was so easy to prepare too. My husband said he would eat them several times a week if he could.

My husband loved these burgers.  He is picky.  I used my George Foreman and buttered my buns and grilled them.  A thin slice of tomato and a piece of lettuce and it was a gormet burger.  Loved the bacon taste.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I only gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because I felt that the garlic powder was a little too strong. I loved the horseradish sauce, I felt that it gave the burgers a little kick, definitely not overpowering - in fact, I may use more next time! It could even use more cheese. Yum! This recipe gave me one of the juiciest burgers I've ever made. I'll use this again, but next time, less garlic powder!

Very good burgers. I left out the horseradish because we were out.  I thought I wouldn't enjoy the bacon pieces, but you honestly couldn't tell they were there.  Even my kids didn't know they were in there - it just had a nice flavor.

Excellent recipe!!  Will definitely make these over and over again!  I did add some finely diced sweet onion but the rest of the recipe I did exactly the same. Very moist.  Had to add an egg to help keep it together and even then they wanted to fall apart on the grill.  Next time I will freeze the patties and grill them right from the freezer to see if they hold together better.

These were so good, I put it in some green onions, used some sharp cheddar and placed some grilled pineapple on top. They did fall apart a little bit during the cooking, but it wasn't really that much.

Ok - - MAYBE I'm easy to please, because I've done quite a few 5-star ratings, But this was HONESTLY VERY GOOD! I do NOT like horseradish, but I followed the recipe, but DID go ahead and add a "glop" of A-1. Very moist, very tasty!! Neither hubby or 13 year old needed nor wanted catsup or ANYthing on their burgers!! I'm quadrupling the recipe for a birthday bar-b-q today! Originally served this with a Macaroni & Cheese salad found here on this website.

Good! We put cheese slices on top of the burgers instead of adding it to the mix.  I think I would add a little less bacon next time, because the flavor was a little overpowering.  Loved the horseradish, though.

I did not give this recipe 5 stars because anytime I have to modify a recipe a star is deducted.  However, once the modifications were made to my family's taste it was wonderful!  A few things to note. 1) 1lb was not enough to make 4 nicely sized patties (mind you, I'm feeding grown men here). I used 1.5lbs to make 4 patties. 2) I cut down 1/2 of the salt. The cheese adds a lot of salt to the meat so I think it would be overkill to add the full amount. 3) I added the full 2 TBS of horseradish and it didn't overpower the hamburgers at all. 

Enjoy!

Charcoal Grilled these burgers for a small patio party. Nothing but raves and requests for the recipe. The only changes I made were used minced garlic instead of powder and used a little extra horseradish. Excellent!

What a great, easy idea!  Chopped up some onion and mixed that into the beef.  No horseradish, sadly, so I used Worcestershire.  About 2 tsp of Bacon bits, due to my dislike of bacon on burgers (kids love that, so I added it). And, added some breadcrumbs to stretch the beef a bit further.  Cooked 'em inside, as February in MN isn't the best time to fire up the grill.  The possibilities are ENDLESS with these!  (I.E. Blue Cheese or Ranch Dressing - whatever you like or have on hand!)

Fabulous!  I added liquid smoke, like another person who rated this - thanks!  It really made this a stand-out!  I never cared for horseradish before, but I really liked it with this!  I also mixed a little horseradish with my mayo for the burger bun.  Thanks!  I've made this twice in one week - that's how great it is!

I do not like hamburgers very much, but my husband does, so I make them every once in awhile.  I will NEVER make hamburgers any other way again.  These are awesome!!  I am eating the one leftover burger for lunch right now.  Nuked it up and it is just as juicy and delicious as it was last night.  I used real bacon, worth the time IMHO, and left out the salt and the garlic. (We are not big garlic fans.) Very very tasty.  Can't wait to have them again!

Good flavor. The horseradish adds just the slightest bit of bite. Couldn't really taste the cheese so will add a slice of cheese to the top next time.

Delicious!  I used a little more beef (about 1.25 lbs) and kept everything the same.  I used ranch dressing with it and the flavor was great!

I enjoyed these, my DH did not.  He likes just my plain old burgers, and to me this was a nice change.  Thank You for sharing it with us!

These were a hit, especially with my husband.  I used colby/jack cheese and a few Tbsp. of Tastefully Simple's Bacon Bacon.

Delicious! I loved these burgers. Great flavor and so easy. I was bored of the regular old burger and wanted something with a different flavor. These were perfect. I made my own bacon and crumbled that instead of the bacon bits. I especially liked that the cheese and bacon was in the meat instead of on top. They were great!

Wonderful! The horseradish gives them a nice zing. I used bottled minced garlic instead of the powder, as I had run out the day before. They turned out great and everyone loved them! We will definatly be having these again!

We really enjoyed these. I only wish that the horseradish flavor was a little stronger. This is the first burger recipe I've made that didn't include bread crumbs and/or finely chopped onion, and I liked this so much better. Also, I've had problems in the past with patties falling apart during cooking, so I chilled them in the fridge for about an hour before grilling. Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious and easy to prepare. Topped our burgers with a BBQ sauce and served with potato skins. Yum.
