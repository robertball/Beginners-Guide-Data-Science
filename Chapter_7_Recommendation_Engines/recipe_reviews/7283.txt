Wonderful and EASY recipe...I changed it to be a blueberry cake with a brown sugar and cinnamon streusel. I added one cup frozen blueberries (would have been good with 1/2 cup more) to the cake mixture. Here is the streusel recipe I used... 1/2 cup flour, 2/3 cup brown sugar, 2 teaspoons cinnamon and 2 1/2 tablespoons margarine.

The recipe for the cake is great.  Instead of the cocoa I use a brown sugar and cinnamon mix for the streusel.

This recipe was extremely easy to make and tasted great. I wasn't able to go shopping today so I had to use vanilla yogurt instead of plain and hot cocoa mix instead of cocoa. It turned out great and my family loved it. I might add a vanilla glaze to it the next time I make it.

The cake itself was delicious and moist but the struesel remained powdery after it was baked making the struesel very dry.  I will make it again and maybe add some brown sugar to make the stuesel less powdery.

Delicious cake, very crumbly.  Tastes even better the next day and slices better.  I used crushed pecans which were very nice.

This cake turned out great although I did make a few changes.  I didn't have plain yogurt so I used sour cream.  Didn't have any nuts so just left those out (would have been good with them though...).  I cheated when it came to cooking, it was for breakfast and we were all starving so I put this in the microwave for 6min 30sec in the tupperware stack cooker base w/cone.  I did pour some olive oil onto a paper towel and wipe it down so it wouldn't stick (never believe non-stick promises!  LOL).  Came out great!  Held together nicely, no crumbling at all, and moist.  I served this with a little bit of cinnamon role icing drizzled on top and with slices of fresh kiwi.  (And each kid got a scrambled egg, can't have them filling up on cake now can we?)  Next time if I am braver I would layer the kiwi slices in the baking dish on the bottom and the middle to see how well that comes out.  They complimented each other so well!

I am sorry it was kinda bland.
May you could try swirling the chocolate,
cinnamon and nuts, into the cake.
Also get a light frosting for it.

This cake was pretty good. Like many others have suggested, I too would have used brown sugar instead of cocoa. Also, the picture shows a glaze but this recipe does not include that. I found a vanilla glaze that went really well on top. 1 cup confectioners sugar, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, and 2 tbsp. milk.

This cake was stayed moist for days.  The batter was very thick.  We loved the cocoa in the struesel.  I added a powdered sugar glaze.  My family loved this.  I will definately make it again.

This was pretty yummy- I tweeked the recipe a little after reading the other comments. I used fat free sour cream instead of yogurt because that's what I had, made the streusel with pecans and added two Tbls of brown sugar as well. Before topping with the rest of the batter I also sprinkled some mini-chocolate chips over the streusel. It took about 40 minutes to bake in a 9x13 pan. I just had a piece (had to try it before I take it to a meeting...) and I'm going to make a little glaze for the top to add a little extra umph. Overall, good, easy recipe though- I will keep it on file.

I didn't care for the cocoa in the middle.  Cake was moist.  Next time I would use a brown sugar and cinnamon mixture like a few others suggested.

I made this recipe a few days ago. I had a box of yellow cake mix & wanted to use it to make something. I was disappointed in the cake overall. It tasted like a box cake mix. I was hoping all the other ingredients would make it taste homemade, but they didn't. The family seemed to like it though.

Needed a quick fix dessert and because I don't enjoy baking, this fit the bill. Based on what ingredients I didn't have in the house, this cake still came out nicely. I used lemon pudding, peach yogurt, no cocoa and white cake mix. I also made a crumb topping which set it off perfectly. Thanks Terry!

Excellent cake, very moist and easy to make, but the struesel filling was not as great as I thought, and I did add brown sugar as suggested. I will definately make it again though!

I made this recipe for a bible study class.  Everyone seemd to like it and I will definitely keep it in my personal file.  My husband and my neighbor's husband commented on how moist the cake was.  I did add a little glaze on top for presentation.  I think you could use cinnamon, nuts and brown sugar instead of chocolate and have a winner as well.  Thanks for sharing.

Yummy!! I took the advise of another review and used lite sour cream in place of the yogurt. (didn't have yogurt) I also threw in some brown sugar with the streusel for extra sweetness. This is a keeper!! Thanks

I thought this recipe might be wrong because it did not contain any water, which did make it stiff and difficult to spread in the pan, but it came out fine.  I only rated this four stars because I think the recipe needs some additions.  As suggested by others, I added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar to the streusel, to give it a little sweetness.  Also as suggested by others, I made a drizzle glaze of confectioner's sugar, half and half, and vanilla, which definitely enhanced the flavor.  I found my cake to be a little dry, but I suspect that was caused by my using 0% fat Greek yogurt, which is what I had on hand.  I will use 2% fat Greek yogurt next time.  The flavor was very nice; didn't taste like a cake mix at all.  I also like that it was very quick to put together.  I may try baking it in a 9x13 pan and putting all the streusel on top and adding some regular or mini chocolate chips.

Very good. Made 2 - one with blue berries, which didn't turn out that well. The frozen ones I bought were HUGE. Kinda clumped up on bottom of the pan.. Not the recipes fault, but FYI. The second one I used the hot choc mix for streusel - VERY good. And turned out moist and wonderful.
