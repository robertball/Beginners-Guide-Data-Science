Having lived in North Africa, in Algeria, travel to Morocco was an easy and fun trip.  This recipe is very authentic and inspired me to make a jar of preserved lemons.  This recipe is on rotation for my future meal planning.

The sodium count must be off. I added the salt from the broth, Mediterranean olives and the butter and came up with a total of 2,629. Divide that by 4 and you get 657 per serving, if the 4 servings is correct. Not much salt in any of the other ingredients. The olives had the most; perhaps cutting down to 3/4 cup and using salt-free or low-salt broth would work.
