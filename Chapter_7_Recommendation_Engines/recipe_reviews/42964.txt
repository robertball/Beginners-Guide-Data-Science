This is a good basic recipe to make Bulgogi which is the Korean name for this dish.
But I made a few changes to make this recipe authentic.
1. instead of using shallots I used spring onions 
2. I used half brown sugar and half white
3. I also added 1 tsp crushed ginger which is a key ingredient for this dish, I'm surprised it's not listed.
4. Instead of using mirin which is Japanese, I used Korean cooking wine, attention: rice wine vinegar is NOT a substitute!!!! You can however use mirin if that is the only thing you can find.
5. to soften the meat, add shredded Korean pear to the marinade, if you can't find it, someone suggested Kiwi pulp which is good too.
6. The sesame oil should be added after the meat has been marinated for a while as it prevents the flavour get into the meat. 
And if you don't like chuck eye, try topside sirloin, works just as well!
The meat is tradtionally served with steamed rice.
Hope this info is useful.

It doesn't get any better than this. This marinade is fantastic. But here's a few cosmetic suggestions to make it even more authentic: First, add three chopped green onions. Second, add one onion, thinly sliced lengthwise. However, I wouldn't dream of suggesting anything about the actual marinade, since it is absolutely perfect. This dish is the pride and joy of Koreans (and their national dish), and I'm sure you'll understand why when you try it!
* A friend of mine who also makes this dish always has the most soft, tender beef. After years of badgering, I finally got her to tell me her secret. She adds a tiny amount of fresh, crushed kiwi, less than 1/8 tsp to 2 lbs of beef. I was skeptical, but gave it a shot. I can tell you that it really does work! It was melt in your mouth delicious. Don't be tempted to use more, or you'll end up with a powdery beef mush.

I did not make this particular recipie but I know 1st hand (I was taught how to make this dish by my Korean mother-in-law) The choice of meat can be cheap Korean cut ribs (which are just small steaks) and only costs $4.00 for aout 2-2 1/2 pounds. Or for a much leaner disch very thinly sliced (from the butcher) roast beef. The marinate should be made of the ingrediates listed but also a puree of carrots, green peppers, and mushrooms and lots of garlic at least 5 cloves... use this with the other ingredients. Also,not sure if I saw but you should use seamee seed oil. And toasted seamee seeds for the marrinating and final top off.

Very tasty.  The flavor is just like the stuff in Korean Restaurants.  I used flanks steak instead of ribeye.  It was cheaper, and it worked just fine.  I recommend freezing the meat prior to slicing, so you can get the pieces as thin as possible.  THIN IS KEY for this recipe.  Also, you don't need to marinate 12-24 hours...2 hours is plenty.  Overall, excellent recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe!  For those who find the saltiness of the soy sauce a bit too much, darker (Chinese) rather then the lighter (Japanese) soy sauce packs tons of flavor without the intense saltiness of the Japanese varieties.  The meat will have a darker appearance after marinating in darker soy sauce, but it won't be as salty.  My family and I enjoy this recipe at least once a month.  It is truly delcious!

This is indeed "awesome". I can't find mirin, so I substitute rice wine vinegar. I can't always find shallots, I use green onions on those occasions. Otherwise I make it according to directions, and serve with rice. It says serves 6, but at my house, it serves 2. It's that good!

I have had this made by a Korean woman in the past and this came as close in taste to hers as I've ever had. I made this exactly as written using an eye round roast sliced extremely thin. The meat was incredibly tender and flavorful. I marinated it for about 18 hours and when I went to cook it, the meat had absorbed every last drop of marinade. I was worried about how salty it might be after reading some of the other reviews, but the flavor was perfect. I can't wait until it warms up outside and I can try this marinade with slightly larger pieces of meat on the grill. A definite keeper.

I'm a Korean and this is one of my family's favorite.  I use thinly sliced beef such as round bottom, top sirloin or whatever's on sale. I add a bit of grated ginger to the marinade and pour regular Coca Cola(1/4 to 1/3 can for each pound of meat) over the meat and marinade-awesome tenderizer. Aluminum foil comes in handy when grilling sliced meat.  Wrap the cooking grid with heavy-duty foil and place it in the grill.  Then poke holes with chopsticks.  Try wrapping this in red leaf lettuce top with hot pepper paste.

I found this to be exceptionally flavorful and tender. I followed the recipe closely, except for adding a tiny amount of Kiwi to the marinade. To me, the overall flavor was a bit over-sweet in relation to the other ingredients. Next time I will cut the sugar in half, which I think will solve that problem nicely. Excellent dish!

I've cooked around 25 Korean dishes and many of them top with the beef like in this one except the beef in those recipes are julienned to thin strips.

Excellent flavor Michael Patten! Thank you, for sharing.  Love the flavor of the sesame'oil and seeds with beef((I used round steak). I wasn't sure if you meant us to save and use the marinade as a sauce(most marinades are too strong for use as a sauce too) but I DID and it and was so glad I did; it made a wonderful sauce boiled down with the meat.  I did add veggies in the "sauce" (took the meat out) the last few minutes. I used fresh snow pea pods, sweet onion and bell pepper squares, sliced water chestnuts and some green onion although you could add any veggie or mushrooms you like or have on hand and it would be good. Whole family liked as well (even a picky 13 year old).

I've made this twice now. The first time with chuck eye steak. It tasted good when I could actually find some meat within all that fat! Then I used a better sirloin steak and it was wonderful that time. I definitely suggest using a better cut of meat then eye steak. I marinated about 10 hours each time which was plenty. Served with Basmati rice and a veggie sauteed in reserved marinade. Excellent!

I made this dish exactly as presented for a young Korean guest.  When he tasted it his face lit up and he said "That is just like my mother makes"!  That's an apt comment for such a tasty recipe.  Thanks!

This marinade is amazing!  I marinated thin slices of flank steak, and used rice wine vinegar instead of mirin, garlic powder instead of garlic, yellow onion instead of shallots (as you can see, I had run out of alot of essentials!). I also used real soy sauce so it gave a really rich taste... I served this with soba noodles tossed with sesame oil, cilantro and scallions.  This is a marinade that I will continue to use for everything!

I used paper-thin rib-eye slices for this and grilled them on my stove-top along with some red onion.  I was only able to marinate about 8 hours and the flavor was good.  I left out the sesame seeds since I didn't have any, and that was just about the only change I made.  Thanks for sharing Michael.

Wonderful recipe.  I've been introduced to this dish before by some of my Korean friends, but none of them could quite explain to me how to make it.  Finally I can enjoy it for myself.  

I had made the same amount of marinade but only had 1/2 the beef.  When the beef was halfway cooked, I added the extra marinade sauce and some cooked brocolli and it turned out great.

"Awesome" is an understatement.  I used New York steak for this.  Amazingly tender, with amazing flavor.  My husband couldn't believe that I was capable of making such a great steak.

Having lived in Korea for two years and fallen in love with the food, I can tell you that this recipe is truly "awesome!"  My husband wanted to drink the broth when we were finished picking the meat out!  My changes were minor:  I used one whole yellow onion instead of the shallots and threw in sliced garlic cloves to make the dish more like I remember it.  Both my 6 year old and 3 year old gobbled this up and are already asking me to make it again.  Huge hit!!

This was great! Before I kept some of the marinade separate from the bowl with the meat in it and used it for sauce on white rice. It ws super although next time I will leave the sesame seeds out of the reserved sauce for rice. Great recipe.

I followed most of the suggestions made in the review by TableTennis: "1. instead of using shallots I used spring onions 2. I used half brown sugar and half white 3. I also added 1 tsp crushed ginger." I also add the sesame oil half way through the marinade time. 
The result is delicious!

My family didn't like this.  I used the cut of meat recommended.   It was very greasy and the soy sauce really overpowered the other flavors.  Won't make it again.

We used NY strip and I feel like the marinade ruined a good piece of meat. The soy sauce was too strong.

This recipe is easily our favorite! I sharpened my knife and sliced up the beef as thinnly as possible (the key) and marinated for 24 hours.  I also used rice wine vinegar instead of mirin, forgot the shallots, and saved some of the marinade for a sauce while cooking (added some corn starch/water mixture to thicken the marinade up)!  Next time, I will place the meat on top of a bed of grilled or lightly cooked red onions for some added flavor.  We ate this with lightly pickled cucumbers and white jasmine rice, and it was the perfect meal. We even loved the leftovers!

I thought this'd be too sweet for my husband, but he loved it (and it marinated for 3 days!).  I didn't know if I was supposed to drain the slices and then fry them so I dumped everything in a fry pan and cooked on med-high until the slices looked carmelized.

Delicious recipe!!!  I used a flank steak and marinated overnight.  I love the flavor. My husband and I love Korean Bulgogi steak and this really tastes like an authentic Korean recipe. Even my 5 year old son said "this is awesome Mom."  Thank you very much for sharing; I will be making it again this week.

I used 1.5 lbs of eye of round steak for this recipe.  I sliced it as thinly as possible while half-frozen.  I created the marinade exactly as directed (with exception of mirin- I did not have any!).  I let the meat marinate for about 20 hours, and I stirred it twice during that time to ensure that it was being evenly saturated.  When ready to cook I threw it into my wok for about 10 minutes.  The flavor was delicious and I will definitely make this again.  Next time I will try to slice the beef even thinner(I may ask the butcher to do it- I have heard that paper-thin is best).  The flavors are rather strong so I recommend serving with something bland like steamed white rice and broccoli.  Wonderful flavor- thank you for the recipe!

4.5 stars.  I used 2 lbs of flat iron steak and marinated 24 hours.  I agree the key is to cut it as thinly as possible.  Delicious.  I did not cook all of it the first night.  The second night, it was just as good AND the cold leftover meat was incredible.  This would be great with sesame rice noodles (on site) or in a wrap with angel hair cabbage.

This is a great recipe that even my picky kids eat. I place this in a ziploc overnight to marinate, skipping the sugar because the mirin adds enough sweet flavor. The next evening I skewer it with mushrooms and cook it on the grill. Great! Thanks!

Great recipe!  For the beef, ask your butcher or the market for sukiyaki cuts- these are really thin slices- they should be able to do this using a meat slicer; as it's difficult to make paper thin slices yourself at home.  With slices this thin, you only need about 2-3 hours of marinading.  Also, I saw a bunch of reviews saying the soy sauce was too much-  it was just right, use a light soy or japanese soy like kikkoman.  I tried this with both beef and pork.  Yummy!  Will definitely make again!

I had been looking for a good Bulgogi recipe for a long time and this is it.  I had the butcher slice the meat really thin to save me a lot of time and I marinated it for 24+ hours.  I served it with rice and stir fried broccoli...so, so delicious.

Wonderful!!  The only change I made was I used rice wine vinegar instead of mirin.  I stir fried with broccoli and snow peas and served over jasmine rice, delicious!!!  I used chuck and it worked fine, just trim the fat as you are slicing it.  HELPFUL HINT: slice the meat while partially frozen to make getting thin slices easier.

This was really good! Someone had mentioned the steak cut that the recipe called for was pretty fatty so we used Flank Steak instead.  It was a great marinade and we'll have it on a regular rotation!

Fantastic bulgogi recipe!!!
I used RICE VINEGAR instead of the mirin, and ONIONS instead of the shallots.  I added sliced ginger into the marinade for that extra kick.
I stir-fried it with red peppers and carrots, added the meat, and poured a little bit of the marinade.
Let the meat cook for about 10-12 minutes (depending how you like the meat), and the sauce is gradually thicken.

Results? Fantastic dish.
Thank you Michael for sharing this "awesome korean steak" recipe!!!

This was so delicous.  It tasted like the korean beef my mom would make.  I only marinated it for a few hours, but it still tasted great.  I can only imagine how much better it will taste after doing it over night.  If I could give this more than 5 stars I would.  By the way, it tastes delicious if you BBG it.  TIP: I use flap meat, and it is great for this.

I found this to be good, but my husband really liked it. I only had round steak in the house, so I pounded it, sliced and then marinated it. My husband likened it to something you would expect to get for a Beef Bowl. Seemed a little too sweet to me, I will use honey instead if sugar-but alot less than the recipe calls for.

Great basic recipe! I like to zip it up a bit by tossing in a couple of dried chili peppers in the hot oil (fry until almost black) before adding the meat. Other nice additions include sliced shiitake mushrooms, A tsp of grated ginger, grated carrots, and soaked bean thread noodles. This ends up looking a lot like a beef chap chae. My family loved this.

Really enjoyed this dish.  My husband (who is a very picky person) even said he liked it.  I was worried because he usually hates anything that has sugar added to it.  The only change that I had to make was substituting the Mirin with White Wine.  Served this with white rice and a stir fry (that we used this marinade with).

This was really easy and very fast in cooking time. Great for a weeknight as you prep one day and finish the next so it really doesn't take much time at all. We thought this was rather sweet though and my husband said it tasted like beef jerky. The flavor, not the texture or any reflection on my cooking abilities. :)
I don't know whether or not I would fix this again as we liked it but it didn't make our favorites. The cut of beef was not as tender as I would have liked. I didn't have shallots so I used chives. Thanks for a nice meal, we enjoyed having something new and different.

This was delicious and very easy to make. It tastes sweet like teriyaki, but isn't saucy. For the marinade, I didn't have mirin, so I subbed white wine plus one Tbsp. sugar. I marinated the meat overnight (I used the cut recommended, and it took about 15 minutes to trim all the fat off). When it was time to stir fry, I initially dumped it all in the wok (the marinade, too) but there was so much liquid that the meat was just stewing in it. I used a ladle to remove most of the liquid, and then the meat and shallots browned up beautifully. I served it over rice and topped it with bean sprouts and green onions, with a side of bok choy. My boyfriend loved it and asked me to make it part of the regular rotation. Great recipe!

My husband loved this meal! I did tweek a little by adding 1/2 cup each of red and yellow peppers cut into thin strips and also 1 med onion (sliced) in addition to the shallots. Like the Mirin better than rice wine vinegar as it is sweeter. Did have to look a little harder for it. Found it online and at Meijer. I use the leftover marinade and add to meat and vegies after cooking and thicken with a little cornstarch. Served with lo mein noodles as we are not big rice eaters. The marinade is to die for without any changes. Great with Chicken too!

This tastes exactly like the Bulgogi my Korean girlfriend used to make for me... instead of frying it in a pan i grilled it on a piece of foil with about 15 holes poked in it with a fork or knife.  i grilled it until the meat was a little carmalized.  Serve it with rice!!  Outstanding!! thanks for sharing!!

This was so great.  We subbed the shallot for green onion, added ginger and used half brown sugar and half splenda.  Incredibly good. Thanks.

AWESOME is the right word for this one.  We used to have a Korean neighbor lady that made this dish for us.  I have tried several different recipes since she left and this one tastes just like her authentic recipe.

I really enjoyed this a lot.  I used several other recommendations and am glad that I did.  First off, I added extra garlic to the marinade.  I was so afraid that it was too much because my refrigerator smelled a LOT like garlic this morning.  I also added some kiwi to the marinade to keep the meat tender.  I should have gotten a better cut of meat, and I am thinking that I might try to crisp the meat up a bit next time - but it is a definite keeper!

YUM!!  This recipe was wonderful!  I didn't have mirin so I used Japanese Plum wine instead.  I know this probably wasn't a proper substitute for mirin - but the final product came out great!  I did use low sodium soy sauce and also added ginger.  Thank you for this recipe....I will definitely be making this again.

Awesome! I made this for my boyfriend since he didn't get to go home to Korea this year. I made your recipe and another marinade from the bottle, guess which one he liked best? He loved it!! He shoveled food in his mouth faster than I've ever seen him eat before! He kept asking me if it was store brought (pre-marinaded meat from the Asian market) and was so impressed with me when I told him I had made it! Thank you for posting this! Since, I'm not Korean and I know he loves Korean food I will make this for him often!

Great recipe!  Yummy!  Tastes like something you would eat in a restaurant!I didn't have any shallots, so I used green onions instead and it worked fine.  I also cut the meat into strips before I marinated it and I only marinated it for about 3 1/2 hours and it still tasted awesome!

We thought this was fabulous!  I used chuck eye steaks for pepper steak and marinated them for almost 24 hours.  I also recommend using low-sodium soy sauce.  I only fried these over medium heat for about 2 1/2 minutes per side, turning once.  Cooking them any longer would make the steaks too tough.  Delicious!

Yummy!!! I sauteed red bell pepper and broccili(sp) with garlic and shallots and then added the meat. I used low sodium soy sauce and did not have mirin or sesame oil so I just used rice wine vinegar and a bit of vegetable oil.  I served over chow mein noodles.  This was great!! It was a little salty but soy sauce is anyway.  My 2 and a half year old son said he liked the broccili. Would be good with just the vegetables too..Thanks!!!

Great recipe! Having no idea what a Scotch steak is, I used round steak, and, as another reviewer did, I used half the amount of sugar. I was out of Soya sauce so I used Oyster sauce.  I had only time to marinate it for about 2 hours. 
For the last couple of minutes cooking I tossed in 1 sliced carrot, half a sliced onion, and half green pepper slivered; and served it with Basmati rice.  It was really an awesome meal. It has a taste quite different from any dish I've cooked before. 
I will be making this again, real soon. Thanks to the contributer for this great recipe.

This was great!  I didn't use the cut of meat specified nor did I marinate it for 12-24 hours. What I did do was soak the  tri-tip meat I had in the marinade for an hour and cooked it in the marinade.  I also did not add 5 tbsp of mirin (I only had enough for 2 tbsp!)  and the meat was still very flavorful!  I will definately make this again!

This recipe is fantastic. To make it even better, and to increase the volume, I sauteed a 2-pound-pack of brocolli first, then mixed it into the meat after it was done cooking. Great with rice.

My hubby is a Bulgogi!  I have never tasted it before, but decided to try this recipe and it is awesome! I did substitute Sake for the mirin and only had time to marinate for about 4 hours served with steamed rice and a bit of stir fry veggies.  It was oh, so easy to prepare and make and oh, so very delicious.  My hubby declared it to be the best he has ever had.

This was excellent.  Accidentally forgot it and marinated for 2 days, but it was still delicious.

The recipe lives true to its title.
An Awesome dish and very authentic.
In the summer I BBQ the meat rather than fry it.
A must have recipe!

This was absolutely TO DIE FOR good.  I made 1/3 of the original recipe to make 2 servings (except that I used 3/4 lb. of meat).  Marinated the meat about 19 hours.  Used 1/2 regular and 1/2 lite soy sauce, subbed sweet yellow onion for the shallot, tripled the garlic, and subbed cooking sherry for the mirin.  I cooked the meat in its marinate; when it was almost done, I added some fresh mushroom pieces.  This recipe was very quick to put together, except for the meat.  My only gripe was de-fatting and de-grizzling the chuck eye steaks.  I wound up with pieces of meat that were all different sizes, and thinly slicing them into uniform size strips was not only an impossibility, it was a joke!!!  Even though chuck eye was really delicious in this, I think I would use boneless NY strip or rib-eye next time, so that the slicing would be a dream.

My husband is Korean and was very pleased w/ this recipe.  Next time, I think that I will use low sodium soy sauce bec. it was a little saltier than we're used to.  Otherwise, this is a great take on a very traditional Korean dish.  Thanks for sharing.

Really really good! I found a 1 pound piece of Laura's beef tenderloin. I put it in the freezer for about 1 hour, & then sliced thinly. I halved the recipe & I only had time to marinate for about 6 hours. I saute'd for the full 10 minutes- this will make it nice & brown & the sauce to reduce. We just ate it plain- no rice. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very good. I added ginger and left out the shallots because I didn't have any at home. I think the next time I'll add a little more sugar and green onion. Instead of slicing and frying the meat I left it whole and grilled it. It marinated for almost 30 hours and I think it might be better to have marinated it longer.

Came out great, although I would get the butcher to slice my meat thinner and neater next time. I had a hard time with slicing it thin - although the flavor was fantastic. Will make again for sure!

A five star all the way. I marinated the steak for 48 hours, and simmered it in the juices in the frying pan. When I served it, I used white rice to sop up the juice. My husband is Korean and says this is the best thing that's come off this website!
Thanks!

this was one great recipe! my boyfriend and I goobled it up with seconds! it tastes and looks like the the korean dish at the resturant! I did use light soysauce, but other than that..i used the exact recipe( i bought the meat at a korean market, it was presliced for me already! it should be in the butcher section)! The only problem that i had was the skillet started to build up sugar and it started to smoke/burn! maybe it's my skillet?

I was browsing the recipes the other day and was delighted to see one of my favourit recipes was there, in my recipe there is the addition of 1 inch of fresh ginger root and 1 teaspoon of coarsely ground black pepper this tends to make it slightly more spicey which we like and I also make a coleslaw to go with it. I finely shred 1/2 a head of chinese cabbage and add 2 finely sliced shallots (green onions) 1/2 a grated white radish and 1 grated carrot which I dress with 1/4 cup light olive oil,1/4 cup of castor sugar, 1/2 cup white vinegar and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil, shake all in a shaker pour over salad and let the flavours blend! We love it.

i adore this recipe! i've made it several times and it always comes out wonderful. it's also very forgiving... i've made it when i didn't happen to have shallots or sesame seeds around the house and it still comes out great.  i also never have mirin around the house so i usually substitute rice wine vinegar... and it still tastes great.... very easy and always yummy.  i've passed the recipe along to my sister and she loves it too!

The recipe is easy to make and follow and has the authentic Korean BBQ taste

I followed the recipe except for the following:

I sliced the beef in in cubes because we like it chunky.

I addes a combo of sliced Spring Onions and thinly sliced Onions instead of Shallots

Placed the marinated beef chunks in the fridge for 3 hours but will do overnight next time.

I added the sesame oil an hour or two before grilling

And since we are on a No-Rice-Diet, I paired it with stir fry veggies.

Loved this recipe! I substituted half sherry/half rice vinegar for the mirin and omitted the sesame seeds as I did not have any. I marinated the meat for 24 hours, so it was very tender and flavourful. Very good take on a bulgogi recipe.

let me start by saying I am really picky about Asian food. I enjoyed this recipe overall. I didn't read the recipe before I was ready to cook it so I only marinated it for about 15 mins. I'm kind of glad because I felt like the soy sauce taste was a little strong. aside from that it was really good. I will probably decrease the soy sauce next time. I also poured the rest of the sauce in my pan afterwards and let it reduce, then added broc to it. turned out the mixture was great over white rice! next time I might add mushrooms too.

First time was a fail. Second time was great! Slice the steak as thin as you possibly can. It makes all the difference in the world! I'll agree with the person who said to add the sesame oil later so the rest of the marinade can soak in. Do NOT cook the meat all the way through! Leave a little pink at least.

Used sirloin beef instead and added too much red pepper flakes which made the leftovers a bit spicy, but loved it just the same. Everyone loved the meal. Served on rice with local vegetables. Excellent.

I love this recipe and make it often.  I always use a teaspoon of ginger in the marinade, other than that I follow the directions exactly.  I use it as a base for stir fry and let my kids pick their veggies like a Mongolian BBQ.  It's a crowd pleaser every time.

Followed recipe exactly, huge hit. Wife and son each said tastes amazing and meat was perfect. I see no reason to change anything. I served over some steamed jasmine rice. This has already been requested for next week.

I make this so often and everyone loves it every time. I often go several miles out of my way to the asian market so I can get the extra thinly sliced beef they sell there. I tried it as a flank steak marinade once and it wasn't as good, so I stick with the thinly sliced beef now.

This had great flavor. I boiled the marinade and added cornstarch to thicken it and served it on the side. My family likes to dip. Lol The only thing I will do differently next time is use a different cut of meat (probably flank steak). If I'm buying chuck, I'd rather have a roast. But the flavor, yum.

Soy sauce made it a little too salty. I would make it again but I would either use low sodium soy sauce or cut the soy sauce in half.

Very good but I would suggest cutting the sugar. I used boneless chuck steak which was too fatty. Will definitely make this again using higher quality meat.

I've used this recipe a few times and it's fantastic.  I have tinkered with it at times, adding meat tenderizer powder to it, increasing the garlic.  This is pretty tough to screw up.

Use reduced sodium soy sauce as this was a little salty, though still enjoyable.  I added shrimp as well and it was teriffic.  Don't worry if you don't have a butcher cutting the meat thinly.  You can do it yourself and it will be fine.  Overall this was great and satisfied our craving for Korean barbecue.  Will be making again soon.

This was REALLY good. My boyfriend loves trying new things and he said this is his favorite by far for chinese dishes!!  I marinated the meat for 24 hours so it was very soft. I don't know if it was the steak that I got, but it was REALLY fatty so i had to cut away a lot of the fat. I had the meat clerk slice in small pieces so i didn't have to try doing it myself.   I served over white jasmine rice and made home made pot stickers.

I would give this more stars if I could! I did follow one other reviewers suggestion and added a 1/4 of crushed kiwi to my marinade. The meat was so soft and tender it was incredible. Make sure you get chuck eye meat as it makes a huge difference as well. All in all solid 5 stars. I make steamed white rice with green onions, kimchi, and a ginger salad to compliment this dish.

All I could taste was the soy sauce, nothing else from the marinade.  WAY too salty.  After inquiring, the best way to make this type of marinade is to dilute the soy sauce w/ water, 1:2 ratio, eg, if you use 1/2 cup soy sauce dilute it with 1 cup water.

Phenomenal!  We make this exactly as instructed to.  We recently changed a beef marinade recipe to this one for Korean Bi Bim Bop.  It really adds a new dimension of flavor to the dish.  Thank you for this post!

I made this with the exact ingredients and measurments as the original recipe posted. Normally I end up tweaking something here or there. The only thing I did change was not cutting the chuck eye's in little strips. I left them whole and put them in a ziplock freezer bag with the marinade at 10pm the night before, Then the next day at 6pm, we grilled the steaks. The flavor was awesome! Even my picky teenage daughter who swore off steak loved it. We decided for us that chuck eye's were a bit on the fatty side for us, Next time I will use petite sirloin.
Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Made it even without the shallots or sesame seeds and it turned out great. Just used regular thick slices of steak, but sliced them thinly. Added some slices of mushrooms, and they tasted good in the sauce as well.

Very delicious marinade and would go well with most sides.  Keep in mind sesame oil has a strong flavor and will be a prominent taste in this dish.
Yummy!

This was great!  We loved it!  It would probably be even better if I were able to find mirin.  I ended up using grape juice instead, and a little less sugar to balance it.  Thought about using the rice wine vinegar like other reviewers suggested, but replacing wine with vinegar just doesn't seem right to me.

Fantastic, truly one of the best dishes I've prepared. I followed the advice in one of the reviews and I froze the steak in order to slice it as thin as possible. I added some sesame seeds over it after it was done for some of that "exotic" look and served with some broccoli which I sauteed in the same skilet. My wife is not a meat lover but she loved this one.

This was just okay for us. My family liked it but not enough for me to make it again. I followed the recipe as written. It just seemed to be lacking something.

Loved it!! The only difficult part is slicing the meat paper thin...I used a filet knife. I made it the night before and let it marinate. Super yummy. Toddlers and hubby loved it!

I actually just re-read the recipe and I forgot to add the sugar!  It was still one of the best things I have ever eaten, and I do not even normally like steak!  I read some reviews saying it was disappointing and to only marinade 2-3hrs--not so!!  The longer, the better.

Be sure not to over cook the meat.
I made this mistake however it still tasted really good.

I was hoping this would be amazing but was actually a bit disappointed. It sounded great, and smelled really good, but the flavours didn't really penetrate the meat as well as I hoped despite marinating this overnight.   I'll probably try it again, but it's not quite the same as you would find in K-town.

Great marinade! Very flavorful. Definitely go for the 24 hour time frame for the marinade. I think next time that I will keep the steaks whole and throw them on a hot grill to char. Delicious! Served them with roasted cherry tomatoes and sticky white rice. Mmmm..

Great, I will definitely make this again. An easy 5 stars. I added some zucchini, brocolli, mushrooms and green onion during the frying process. The only change I will make next time is to cook the beef less then 5 minutes, we like our meat more rare then most.

Delicious!  Tastes just like my family's favorite Korean restaurant!  It's $18/lb. there so we'll be making this at home from now on.  The only thing I changed was I put only 1/3 c soy sauce.  I made it with a cucumber salad:  http://salad.allrecipes.com/az/63912.asp

Easy marinade.  Did not use the cut of meat specified.  Something about the end product was a bit too strong for my taste.  Tastes good with rice, but would like to tweak a bit in future.

This is amazing. My husband says this is his favorite dish. The sauce is wonderful, I steam vegetables and make rice and put the sauce together and heat it up and it put it all together and it comes out beautiful. A very healhy dinner...

Very good and the only reason it's getting 4 stars instead of 5 is probably b/c I had trouble cooking the meat correctly.  I think I need to slice it very thin next time so it's cooked quickly and is still juicy.  The pieces of flank steak I used may have been too thick to fry properly.  The juicy pieces were great though!

Awesome! Used green onions instead of shallots, rice wine vinegar in place of wine. Truly authentic taste! A keeper for the recipe file and will make it into frequent rotation!!

We tried this recipe today and thought it was fantastic. The marianade is just perfect by itself, full of flavour and I agree with the earlier reviews that it is best served with plain white rice and a small side portion of home made kimchi. Next time we thought about including some spring onions in the stir fry. Enjoy everyone.
