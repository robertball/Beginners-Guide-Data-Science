This was very good, but since we had to cook the rice anyway, we sauteed the onion and celery in a little butter, then added water to cook the rice. To soften the pepper halves, they were put in the pot of simmering rice for a few minutes. The tuna and everything else were mixed into the cooked rice before putting in the pepper halves, to bake with the bread crumb topping.

This is a rather budget friendly meal if you swap out green peppers, however you would lose that sweetness from the red pepper. I would premake the rice the day before to save time. When making again I would add some onion powder, garlic powder, or salt to step up the flavor.  Would make it again!
