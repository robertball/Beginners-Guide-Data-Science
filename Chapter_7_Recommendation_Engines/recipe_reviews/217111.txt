A good recipe when you want something easy with minimal ingredients. It's also healthy, so that's a plus. I served mine over zoodles and used Jennie-O Italian turkey sausages with the casing removed (4 = 1lb). I omitted the cornstarch/water because 1) I didn't find it's necessary after simmering the sauce for 30 mins and 2) I don't care for the gelatinous consistency cornstarch often gives food.  To kick up the flavor, add some garlic powder, and use the canned diced tomatoes that come with added seasonings.
