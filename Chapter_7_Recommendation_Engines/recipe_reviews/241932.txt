I love this recipe!  I did add to it though.  I made a simple dressing of 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon of  balsamic vinegar and juice from half a lemon. I also added some sweet peppers for added color and crunch. It was so good I'll be making this again soon.

I'm constantly looking for new healthy sides to try and was excited to find this recipe. I don't have a food processor, so mincing and chopping was a little time consuming, but well worth i! I made this exactly as written, and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight.  I found myself eating 2-3 portions, since the servings were on the smaller side. Very low calorie and full of fresh flavors. This would also make a great topping for chicken or fish. I think next time I will make some sort of dressing for added flavor, made with olive oil and either lemon juice or red wine vinegar. Thanks for sharing Jewel!

Awesome! I used vine ripened tomatoes and chopped everything so it was fine. It was healthy and delicious.

Made this for Recipe Group...This was tasty! I have to say that I actually liked this better maybe 10-15 minutes after I made it, lol. I think this would be great over grilled chicken or grilled pork chops too. A nice, healthy side! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made it as per the recipe.  For my tastes, the salad was quite bland. Also, the texture of the spinach was not very appetizing. Sorry....we all have different tastes :)

This was tasty although I would use it more for a dressing to place on top of a grilled meat. I did do what other reviewers suggested and added 2 T of olive oil and 1 T of balsamic vinegar for extra taste.

This was excellent.   My husband loved it.  I could have gone a little lighter on the salt but otherwise it is an excellent, refreshing salad that was super easy to make.  I love that it was all fresh ingredients and no dressing.  It lasted well for a few days in the fridge.

This salad was really tasty and the author was correct, it does make its' own dressing.  Be careful to chop up the fresh basil well and don't put more than it calls for because it will overpower the taste and ruin the experience.

Not a lot of flavor.  Fresh tasting but just not worth the effort to me.  Couldn't taste the spinach at all.

I'm not sure how I feel about this dish as a salad, or side dish, per se.  I agree with another reviewer, in that it would make a nice topping for grilled chicken.  I felt the flavors were a little too strong to eat alone as a side dish or salad, at least for our preferences.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, RainbowJewels!

Recipe Group Selection:  23, May 2015 ~ We liked this salad, but wished it had a little something more.  Not sure what 'more' is, but it needed something for us.  It had good flavor and used ingredients that I always have on hand.
