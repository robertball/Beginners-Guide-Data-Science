I made these for fellowship at church tomorrow.  As far as Rice Krispy treats go these are by far the best I've ever tasted!  The browned butter really gives it a wonderful depth of flavor as well as the bourbon. (It gives just the tiniest hint of bourbon flavor).   The only thing I might change when I make these again is to add only half the salt called for if you are using salted butter.  These are very very good.  Try this recipe!

I'm not a big fan of Rice Krispie treats; they just don't taste all that great to me.  This recipe, however, is fantastic. They have a deep, rich flavor that has changed my mind about Rice Krispie treats and will have me making these on a regular basis!  Don't use vanilla instead of the bourbon--trust me. You want the full flavor experience.

I love Rice Krispy® Treats - in fact, they are one of my two food 'guilty pleasures' in life.  This is a delicious recipe.  As soon as you add the 2 tablespoons of bourbon to the pan, it bubbles up and you don't taste it in the recipe.  The sea salt.....you do taste and I liked it!  I took these to girls night out and no one detected the bourbon but everyone detected the sea salt.  Needless to say, I came home with an empty container.  Yes, this is a recipe that I would make again.  Thanks  voraciousgirl, for sharing your recipe.  I've shared it too!

Tip: Start with a pan roughly 5 quarts in size so that everything will fit in one pot and you have room to stir (I use a dutch oven). I've made this recipe with bourbon and with substituting vanilla. Both are great, but the bourbon gives a more complex flavor. The slight saltiness is really what elevates this recipe.

WOW WOW WOW!   Who knew that Rice Krispies bars could have that much flavor?   These are FANTASTIC.   A little, very little, extra work over traditional Rice Krispies bars, but well worth it.   You cannot taste the bourbon at all, but you can taste the salt just a bit.   The perfect amount actually.   It's the perfect blend of salty/sweet and the depth the browned butter and bourbon add is just a great bonus.   This IS the way I will make Rice Krispies from now on.

Woah! Those are incredibly better than your standard butter sugar and marshmallows!  For those who don't keep alcohol in the house, substituting 1tablespoon of vanilla extract and 1 tablespoon of almond extract for the bourbon worked fantastically. Really good recipe!

Good, not too sweet; however, some bites seemed saltier than others, and I don't think it needed the bourbon.

I've made this recipe many many times, and each time it took all of my willpower not to gobble the entire pan immediately.  Friends and strangers have approached me just to rave about these treats. 

The one recommendation I do have is to use salted butter. The recipe doesn't specify which kind to use. I made a batch of this last night and couldn't figure out why the bourbon packed a bigger punch than usual because I made it exactly the same way every time. I finally realized that I used unsalted butter this time...I was shocked at the difference it made. TRUST ME - it will not be too salty; use salted butter! The recipe needs the salt in the butter as well as the teaspoon and extra sprinkle at the end to cut the sweetness of the marshmallows and to balance out the flavor of the bourbon.

They were very good and a little more savory than the regular recipe, but they were not as fantastic/stand out as other reviews led me to believe. I ended up adding a dark chocolate drizzle and a little more sea salt just to add extra oomph.

These were AWESOME!!!
For once I followed directions to a 'T' did not have to make substitutions as I had all ingredients. Just a word of advice,if you don't have booze  on your premises,such as bourbon ,there's no need to spend alot of money if you dont drink hard liquor. The bourbon, sea salt, AND the brown butter is what makes this version of rice krispie treats so delicious!Go to a liquor,or grocery store and purchase an individual size bottle  of bourbon ( I used Jim Beam Kentucky Bourbon) for the quantity you need for these amazingly good rice krispie treats.  I'll never make them any other way after tasting these delights! :D

Rave Reviews!! I have now made double recipes twice in two weeks and the reviews are that they are the best Rice Crispy Treats ever tasted.  My “add” to one pan was mini dark chocolate chips on top and then sprinkle the sea salt flakes on top of that. Who doesn’t love dark chocolate and sea salt with a classic favorite. ??I needed to leave one pan plain for the RCT purists. Ha Ha Ha!!  Both received the rave reviews.

I used 1 bag of large marshmallows and half the bag of mini marshmallows.  Then at end, I stirred in remaining 1/2 bag of minis so that they got a little melty, but essentially stayed whole in the end product.  These are DELICIOUS and have become a fast favorite to family and friends.  A bit more time consuming than the traditional recipe, but  SO worth it.

The first time I made these, I had no bourbon, so I used Brandy flavoring, and they were alright. A few days later, I made them as the recipe directed, and they were much better! :)
I used a finer sea salt when mixing it into the melted marshmallows, then sprinkled a coarser variety on the top. I liked it that way...just enough salt! 
Now I want to add some dark chocolate to these, and see how that turns out!! Great recipe! Thanks so much!

These are seriously addicting! I never craved Rice Krispies until a friend introduced me to making them with the brown butter. Now I'll never make them any other way.  I added cinnamon and vanilla which adds a nice flavor with the bourbon.

These were delicious! I am obsessed with Rice Krispy Treats and these were a great variation. I didn't have bourbon so I used spiced rum, and it was perfect. The browned butter gave it just the right change from the original so it was just "Rice Krispies but different". So delicious. Filled up a 9x13 pan perfectly and if you put the pan in water IMMEDIATELY after cooking, it comes clean like magic.

Perfect combination of sweet and salty.  Don't skip the bourbon...I was leery about it too.  But this recipe is delicious!!  I did 1/2 the salt...because I used salted butter.  This one is a keeper, thank you for sharing!

I made these crispy treats exactly as the recipe read. (That is a rare thing in itself) I used gluten free crispies and it was wonderful. I shared with my golf group and have given the recipe to 5 people already. The bourbon gives it just the right touch. I have made 2 batches in two days.

If I was alone on a desert island with nothing but these, i'd be pretty happy.  I've made them 3 times; once for a bake sale, and they are delicious.

In the middle of melting my butter I realized my package of mini marshmallows was only 10 oz, not 16.   No problem, I reduced my rice krispys to 6 cups. These came out so delicious.  My mom can't stop talking about em!    They have a great bourbon taste and every once in a while you get a nice salty surprise.    I will definitely be making these again.

I've found that adding too much bourbon will make the finished cookies too hard.  Just a splash is all that is needed.

I'm a salted snack fan but I didn't care for these with the salt.  It leaves an after taste.  I will stay with the original Rice Krispie recipe.

Ohhhh sooooo good! I used Pendleton Whisky and vanilla. I also did half plain Rice Krispies and half Fruity. Make sure your bag of marshmallows is 16 oz. I got most of the way through the recipe and noticed my bag was only 10 oz. sent my husband back to the store. I always toss a big handful or two of miniature marshmallows that are unmelted in with the mix too. Don’t forget the flaked finishing salt on the top. The salt/sweet combo is the bomb!

This was very good. Took it to a tennis match and everyone loved it and couldn’t figure out what the additions were. Made it as written except I didn’t sprinkle salt on the top. Thank you, also created a whole new discussion (and controversy) as to what other liqueurs (and flavours) you could add to Rice Krispie Treats!

I make these treats throughout the year, but they are a big hit during the holidays. I use the sea salt and have not tried using the bourbon or the vanilla, but am sure it would be a great addition to the flavor.

This is the REAL DEAL!!!  I made a double batch  on parchment in a jellyroll pan, for work. I tinted the rice orange and cut into neat squares to decorate. I panicked when I first added the bourbon because I could smell the alcohol, but it quickly burned off leaving a nice warmth with no trace of alcohol. I did 2 tbl bourbon, 2 tbl vanilla. Just beautiful!

Who would guess that the original could be made even better?  These treats were wonderful, though I made a couple of changes.  I reduced the amount of salt to just a few dashes, and they were plenty salty.  I also reduced the amount of butter by about 2 tablespoons, mainly because I had found I didn't need that much fat with the original recipe.  I don't think this affected the flavor much, for between the browned butter and bourbon, there was a lovely caramelized butter flavor.  We will be making these again and again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are amazing! so easy to make, I was nervous about Browning butter....just stay on top of it...totally worth it in the end. Also, I measured all my ingredients prior to making this which made it super simple to throw together quickly. patting them down with a sheet of parchment paper is a great trick!

Added 2.5 tsp milk at end of melting marshmallows. Did 1 tbsp bourbon and 1 tbsp vanilla. Delicious! Wish I had done all bourbon.

The best Rice Krispy recipe ever.  These were totally devoured at the party I brought them to. One girl ate five squares. I recommend to add a little extra marshmallows to make them gooey, but other than that no need to modify the recipe at all. No one would ever guess these have Bourbon and salt in them but that combination makes for a definitely improved Rice Krispy  Treat.

They are the best recipe yet. I have made many different kind of Marshmellow Treats this is the best. Just make sure you use a good smooth bourbon. Top shelf only.

Never going back to the original recipe. My husband who is not a Rice Krispy Treat fan asked me to make them again 2 days later.

Absolutely delicious! In all fairness I should disclose that I used cocoa krispies and vegetarian marshmallows, but the result was the best krispies I've ever had. Oh and I only had cherry infused bourbon, which turned out to be yet another delicious addition.  This will definitely be my go-to krispies recipe moving forward! Thank you! :-)

These are crazy good! My hubby who happens to be a chef usually turns his nose up at Rice Krispies. Not these... he could not stop eating them & had me make them for all of his industry friends. Every time I bring them somebody loves them & asks for the recipe

I was never a a big fan of Rice Krispy treats but now I can't get enough.  These taste amazing.  I didn't change a thing and I can't think of any reason why I would want to.   Thanks so much for a great twist on an old standby.

I love this version. For variation, I've added 1/4 cup of Amaretto instead of Bourbon or vanilla.   Thanks so much for sharing!

I like regular rice krispie treats but they are kind of bland.  These up the flavor factor and are a nice change of pace.   Great recipe!

very good. 
peanut butter also tastes good in rice krispie treats and elevates with less work.
