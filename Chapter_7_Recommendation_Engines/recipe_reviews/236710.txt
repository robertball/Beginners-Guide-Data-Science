This was an easy meal with put together. If you like youe chili to be on the softer side, make sure you allow more time for it to simmer on the stove. I don't eat meat so I left out the ground turkey. I followed the recipe as written but found the sauce to be rather thick, so I added an additional 2 cups of water. The sauce is still on the thicker side, but the water helped to make it the perfect consistency. This recipe does have a bite to it with the spices, be forewarned if that is not your thing! I absolutely love the fresh butternut squash, black beans, and southwest corn! This is a recipe I will make again!

Simple and easy. My 2 and 4 year old boys went back for seconds, as did I. Will be great for leftovers, too, and for once the recipe truly took only the amount of time listed. A great recipe for a cool Alaskan fall day.

This recipe was good!  It was really simple and super quick to make. I think the butternut squash adds a hint of sweetness to it, or maybe it was the crushed tomatoes that I used, but it was different. I had thought it was going to be too thick at first but upon cooking it a little longer, it wasn't as thick. Even my 6 year old loved it - so I'll be making it again!

Created a meatless version but added 1 can of red kidney beans and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar to balance the acidity. I cut back the chili powder and added a teaspoon of turmeric. 
I used half of a whole butternut squash, which I cut in half and roasted face down on cookie sheet at 350 for 45 minutes. After it cooled, I removed skin and cut into chunks, which I added near the  end. I think this helped the enhance the flavor of the squash although it did take a bit longer. 
Turned out great!

I added half a packet of taco seasoning and a can of red beans. Topped it with some cheese and plain greek yogurt, this chili is delicious. Which is great considering it will feed me for an entire week!

I left out the squash and put Muenster cheese on my hot rice under the chili but this chili was super tasty!  I saved it in “favorites” and will definitely make it again!!

This has a wonderful flavor and I will definitely make this again. I used herbed olive oil in place of the corn oil to give it a bit more flavor and it is healthier as well. I also added some cubed fresh sweet potatoes along with fresh squash and it really turned out yummy!

I’m vegan so I skipped the portion regarding ground turkey. It turned out great. I used fresh butternut squash so I topped it with a sprinkle of sugar. I’d also suggest if you use fresh squash after you cook it let it sit in the fridge overnight- it’s amazing the next day and reheated.

This was a great recipe and I will definitely make it again. I've shared it too.  I added a can of tomato paste to make it thicker.

I used finely chopped beef stew meat, because that's what was in the freezer ( I didn't cook it first, just threw it in). Also a jar of mild salsa instead of the diced tomatoes. I dumped everything in the crock pot in the morning, set it on low, and 8 hours later had a great soup. Very good flavor, and I'll definitely make it again. Some of the family like it spicier, so I served it with optional hot sauce.

This was an easy, tasty recipe. I did swap out the ketchup for a can of diced tomatoes and the cumin for chipotle chile powder, but otherwise followed the recipe. Everyone enjoyed it.
