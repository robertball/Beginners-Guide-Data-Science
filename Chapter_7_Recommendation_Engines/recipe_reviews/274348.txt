Exactly as Chef John  said it'd be - incredibly rich and decadent!  It was everything I really loved . I heartily recommend watching his video so you can see all the ins and outs of making this.   This reminded me a lot of a cheese ball I had as a kid, and so it just felt and tasted heavenly.

Taste really good but it is very rich.  I turned the leftover dip into a macaroni salad by adding only chicken and pasta because it was already flavorful, it was excellent.

We make this dip all.the.time! Especially when hosting. Our guests always rave about it. It's fairly simple to make and DELICIOUS. We usually make it the night before a party and it a makes for an easy appetizer to pull out of the fridge and munch on while we make the main dish. We make the recipe exactly as written and it is perfect.  We make sure to serve with ritz crackers, wheat thins, and (my personal favorite) Crunchmaster multi-grain crackers. Thank you Chef John!!

I am usually a big fan of anything Chef John makes but this dip just didn't do anything for me.  I made it  for a New Year's Eve party and there was more of this left over than anything else.  I think the green onions were overpowering and the mayonnaise was just too much.  Sorry Chef John, I still love you but just not this dip.

Itâ€™s great. If it is too rich, substitute some of the mayo for sour cream. I like 1 cup mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream. I also like to add extra toasted almonds and bacon.

I made it exactly as written and it was  wonderful!! My son could not stop eating it. I was making a second batch for a party and my son tried to talk me into keeping the second batch. He wanted me to add that it tastes good with triscuits as well lol!!

I've made this dip several times and it is so good my friends trip over each other trying to get to the bowl.  I make it exactly as written above. (reports that I slip in extra bacon cannot be verified!)  My only wish is that it was a bit easier to slip a chip or cracker into.  I wonder if adding something like yogurt or sour creme would work?
