The applesauce doesn't go well with the cream. If I make it again I will use apple pie filling chopped into small pieces and double the cinnamon to 1 tsp.  I am also debating about using apple pie spice instead of the cinnamon.  And I will put it in my Cuisinart ice cream machine.  :-)

Here is what I did. 3 cups of fat free halve and halve..   Please add the apple pie filling instead of the applesauce. I put the whole can in a chopper then added to the mix. 1tsp. cinnamon. 1 carton of coolwhip thawed. I did not use eggs period. Mix this all by hand with a whisk then add to your ice cream maker....This turns out so creamy..the texture is perfect! Try this and I'm sure you'll be making this again

I have made this icecream with homemade apple sauce it makes all the difference in the world I used half and half instead of the condensed milk I did double the cinnamon here is the recipe add heavy cream and half and half and sugar to a sauce pan over medium high heat bring it to 170 f then temper the egg yolks in move to a bowl to cool but in the apple sauce and cinnamon put in the refrigerator over night so the flavors can meld then put it in your icecream maker till it starts to get thick then remove but in a icecream container and freeze for at least 3 hours then serve I just changed the whole recipe but it is really tasty and rich please give it a try and I did add1 tablespoon vanilla and did use the eggs yolk but just follow the recipe I suggested it is really great and you will change your mind and there is a recipe on this site for homemade apple sauce which is great
