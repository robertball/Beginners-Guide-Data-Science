Flavors were great with this! Tasted like a caprese salad.  I threw in a little extra garlic and also halved each breast so they were thin enough to not need pounding.  Glad I made extra because we definitely wanted leftovers!

This recipe gets 5 stars for the ease and quickness of a complete meal.  I also did as other reviewer and halved the chicken breast but still pounded on them lightly to ensure tenderness. I tripled the amount of freshly diced garlic and added dry basil instead of fresh. Also added some garlic and a slight drizzle of salt. i also doubled the recipe and didn’t strain the diced tomatoes because I only had 1 can of tomato sauce.  Also added finely shredded Asiago cheese along with the Italian blend of cheeses.  And topped off the recipe with the shredded Asiago for the final touch.  I poured this on top of shell pasta and added a few Croutons.  My family devoured it and even hubby complimented.

Very good recipe! I did season the chicken with salt and pepper before cooking.

I would give this 3.5 stars if I could. This recipe came together easily and I really like the concept. I liked using tomato sauce along with the diced tomatoes but felt as a while it was a little bland. Next time I make this I am going to sauté some onion along with the garlic and then add in the tomato sauce with some Italian spices; parsley, oregano & basil. I served this with some angel hair pasta and garlic bread.

What a refreshing surprise. I wasn't expecting to enjoy this so much...and it's so simple to put together.  A perfect combination of flavors. Your family will definitely enjoy this. Top with some crushed red pepper flakes for a bit of kick!
