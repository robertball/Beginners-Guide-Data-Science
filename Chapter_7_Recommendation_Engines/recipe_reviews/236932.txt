Thank you for the recipe! 
Made it just like you describe... well almost. 
I 'zested' up some of the lemon and mixed it with the onion that I put into the cavity. Other than that... 
Bottom line is the fish was a BIG hit! 
Gonna have to buy more bronzino (bronzini?) soon. 
Thanks!

I have never liked fish. The last time I ate fish was back in the 80s. I came across the recipe and decided to make it for my husband who loves any kind of fish any way it's cooked. He talked me into taking a small bite, and wow. It was so delicious. Melt in your mouth, no fishy taste. I have written it down and put it in my recipe box. It not only is a keeper but a pass along too! Thanks for sharing this. You rock!

Great and easy to make. I had to cook longer than 25 closer to 35-40. Great tasty fish. For sauce I usually make a blend with yellow mustard and olive oil lemon parsley and onions all mix well in a blender.

The temperature was way too low as others have commented on. After 25 min at 325 degrees the fish was still raw. Turned the fish over and increased temp to 400 degrees and put on bottom rack for another 25 min and was just about done. Will try at 400 degrees on the bottom rack next time. Very clean tasting fish.

Excellent! I didn’t think it would come out as good as it did. I followed the recipe to the T with the exception of the oven temp and cooking time. I cooked on Conv Bake at 400° and about 50 minutes. My Branzino were 1 lb. with the head (which I had taken off). I sprinkled sea salt on the top of the Branzino before it went in the oven. Highly recommend!

Don’t be intimidated by cooking with the head on. If you just can’t stand the thought of it staring at you while you are trying to eat, cut the head off prior to plating. This recipe is very easy to prepare and so tasty. It’s light and healthy worth the price.

Wonderful recipe! The rosemary and oregano are a nice subtle touch on the delicate lemon juice flavoring with the Bronzino.

(I "cheated" and had the Branzino filleted, although I did keep the rest of the fish/head for fish stock--couldn't waste that!)  I didn't have white wine, so I used some vegetable stock in place of that.  This recipe turned out delish!

My 1st time preparing this Branzino.  I followed the recipe but put a couple scallions in each cavity and roasted for about 45 mins.  It was delicious.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I should rate this as 5 star, but  I used every flavor suggestions listed within the reviews.  I also baked at 400 for about 40 mins.  My two good size  whole branzino were the perfect temperature.  The tomato,onion, lemon , garlic and oregano was just wonderful flavor...um um good.  Will make this again, maybe on the grill.

Easy to do and had a nice flavor.  I'd make it again.   I would add a little touch of honey to it so that the coloring  comes out like the picture.

25 minutes are definitely not enough. I suggest a higher temperature or longer cooking time. The cooked parts of the fish were delicious. I'll make it again at 400F.

I had never heard of Branzino before and did not think the local store would carry it, but to my surprise they had it and it was on sale! We followed your directions to the letter and this made for a wonderful date night meal. Next time we will remember to take a photo, it was a beautiful display. The flavor was mild and the fish was very tender. Thanks for sharing!

Divided this recipe in half for just my husband and me. Only substitutions  were sweet onions and dried oregano because they were what I had on hand, and it still turned out amazing. Took longer (40 min. total) than anticipated at 325 degrees. Next time, will try baking at 350 degrees. What a moist, delicious recipe!

This works perfectly. The exact cooking times will depend on how big your fish are. I’ve made it many times and it always comes out moist and tender. I’ve also used orata instead of branzino. Thank you for the recipe.

Omg ! Best recipe the white wine just added so much flavor. Made it for tonight’s dinner & the whole family loved it. Although I cooked it on 400 degrees for 30 mins to get it nicely golden brown the inside was so flaky & the cavity came out so easy it just fell off! Thanks for the recipe !!

I made it with the tomatoes and celery inside.  And based on other reviews cooked at 400 and ended up taking a total of 50 min.  It was incredibly moist and delicious.  We cannot wait to make it again!!

How did you come up with cooking time of 25-30 minutes?
I am now 45 minutes in and it is still not done!  Maybe you like raw fish, I only like it as sushi!

I followed the recipe as written.  It was delicious.  I have never had this fish before but I will now again and again. I did cook it for 30 minutes and put it under the broiler on low for 3 minutes, only because my husband prefers crispy fish skin. Thank you for sharing.

Made as directed just added a tad more citrus and cooked about 7 minutes longer for the flakey texture. Turned out fantastic! We love this dinner. Hope you do too!

Good recipe. Oven temperature and cooking time WAY off.
