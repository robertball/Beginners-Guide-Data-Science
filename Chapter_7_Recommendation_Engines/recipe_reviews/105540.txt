5+ for taste but I would rate it 1 for cooking instructions.  There is no waaaay that you can roast carrots (even baby ones - which I used)at 375 degrees for 20 min.  I followed the recipe exactly until it came to the roasting time - I steamed the carrots for 5 minutes - then I roasted all the veggies in a well preheated 500 degree oven for 20 min.  I cut the recipe to serve 4 people - a mistake - Ron and I ate it all in one sitting!  Fellow chefs you must try this one!!!  So different.  Thanks submitter.

Outstanding! I would never have thought of this on my own. I cut the baby carrots into thirds and boiled them until barely tender. Then I mixed them with the grapes, onion, cumin and olive oil. I also added a little sea salt before baking the mix for about 10 minutes. The grapes still had some pop to them and the onions were done. I sprinkled some fresh parsley on top and it looked beautiful. The perfect fall side dish.

Good but I think the cooking time could do with some adjustment. The baby carrots took about 30 mins to really soften, by which time some of the grapes and onion had burned. Next time I'll add them after 15 mins, so that they keep a little bit of bite. But thanks for a nice recipe, Matt!

It was pretty good.  Better than anyone expected.  I cut the carrots into thirds and pre-boiled them for a few minutes.

Fantastic. I made a couple of revisions: I didn't have any grapes, so I used raisins, and I added about 1/2 cup of chopped onion, and a little basil on top. It was very tasty (of course, I never met a carrot I didn't like).

I was so excited to try this recipe, but unfortunatley, it was not very good. My husband and I are adventurous eaters, but we just didn't think the flavors went together very well. I'm not sure what went wrong. Sigh...

What an outstanding recipe! This was so easy to create with only five ingredients and no prep work. I added some fresh ground black pepper as well as some sea salt. It was tremendous, beautiful to look at and a wonderful accompaniment to our steak this evening. Cannot wait to make again.

I wish I would have read the other reviews before I made this.  The carrots were way under-done.  The grapes were delicious, though.

This is gorgeous - and so quick and easy.  We had a dinner party last night, and my husband went shopping for me yesterday morning - but could only find a mixed pack of vegetables - baby carrots, sweet corn and asparagus.   So I put the sweet corn in with the carrots - and it worked really well.  Everyone was most impressed!

I love carrots, and I love onions, and I love grapes, but this combo just didn't work for me.  Individually the items were okay once salted(the roasted grapes were quite good), but together they seemed not to pair well.  I am usually a very adventurous cook, but I will never make this again...before making my own final judgement though, I asked my husband and teenage children to try it and they all had the same reaction as I did. I actually threw it all away and started from scratch to make a different
 carrot dish to take to Easter dinner.

I definitely agree with the other reviewers that the carrots need to be pre-cooked slightly before baking. This simple recipe was nice, but needs a little something so I recommend adding a Tbsp or two of Orange Juice to the olive oil when you coat everything. This really makes the flavors pop! Also, try sprinkling it with a little sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, plus a bit of fresh parsley if you have it on hand. It just adds that extra bit of "wow" to the dish.

This is a great idea, roasted carrots and grapes with cumin, but like everyone else says, the instructions aren't great. I sliced regular carrots and boiled them for about 8 minutes before roasting them with everything else for 10 minutes. It turned out great!

Excellent!  Was a little nervous about the combination, but so surprised at how good it was.  I will definitely be making this one again.  Didn't have red onion so I used yellow and it added a nice color contract.  My 5 year old even loved it.  I steamed the carrots for 8 minutes ( baby ones cut in 3rds) then cooked at 45 for 20 mins but the carrots were still undercooked and the grapes over cooked.  I will steam more next time and cook less with the grapes.  Wonderful, easy, and healthy!

Very strange flavor, and I ordinarily like a mix of sweet & spicy.  Also, 15-20 minutes did not cook the carrots through.  They were still very hard.

Made this tonight and was not impressed. Followed the recipe to the T but the side dish just tasted like warm grapes and carrots even though I added additional spices to try and overcome this. I just don't see how this is in any way Indian cuisine. Won't make again.

I made this with green grapes instead of red, shallots instead of red onions, and regular carrots instead of baby carrots. Didn't really like it, but I realize the original recipe is quite different so I'll give it a 3 star rating.

the grapes, olive oil, cumin, onion carrot is lovely. authenticity needs much more spices, however as this is dull compared to 'Indian' or desi food. It's a terrific starter recipe. I needed to cook mine at least 40 minutes for carrot 'slices' to be somewhat soft. would definitely add potato to this recipe.

I like this recipe. As suggested, I parboiled the carrots. Also I used 1.5 teaspoons of cumin and mixed this in with the oilve oil - 2 tablespoons - in addition I added about a tablespoon of honey then swirled all the ingredients together before putting it in the oven.  
 I served it with an indian dish (butter chicken) and rice. I like that it wasn't too heavy as many Indian foods are very rich. And this balanced off the rich chicken dish.

I did not like this at all.  The grapes were too soft and there was not that much flavor.  It would probably be better as a cold salad.

I agree with the previous reviews, the carrots need to be precooked before being roasted. Also, I found the flavor somewhat mild, I think next time I will double the cumin and maybe add some marjoram to play up the sweetness of the onions and grapes. Adding some parsley as a garnish may also give a nice light finish.

This is a fantastic side dish.  The combination sounded so weird that I just had to try it but it turned out beautifully.  I too did a quick pre-cook on the carrots and everything roasted to a nice doneness.  It tastes delicious and is quite beautiful to look at, too.  Will certainly make this again.

I made this recipe for my crowd and they all liked it.  We did decide that it should have a little more cumin and maybe we will try adding something else with it next time for more zip. There were no leftovers!

I did just the grapes and carrots (no onions) and LOVE it.  It's been great as a warm nibble for parties and gatherings.

Very easy to make.  Took the advice of others and pre-cooked the carrots before roasting. Seemed like an odd combination to me but it was very tasty.  I will make this again.

Grapes made it a little too sweet.  Maybe half as much would be better.  Otherwise, yummy.

The sweetness of the grapes and carrots are blended by the cumin. It was a nice surprise.

The cooking time really was problematic.  It also didn't have quite enough spice for our tastes.

I was excited to try such a "different" recipe, but was very disapointed. The cooking time was wrong like previously stated, but even after that adjustment the flavor was kind of boring. I served it at a party.  Everyone dished some on their plate but only had a bite or two.

Everyone liked this even though it was a bit unusual.

This recipe, though an odd combination, is delicious.  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and pre-cooked the carrots and increased the cumin.  I would also agree that it takes more than 15 minutes at 350 degrees to cook.  All in all, I would highly recommend this as a different vegetable that is not only good to eat but healthy.

I didn't make this dish in the oven because the directions didn't seem like the ingredients would get soft enough for my liking.  Instead, I parboiled the carrots, while simmering the grapes & red onion in the olive oil & curry in a pot on top of the stove for 30-40 minutes.  I cut the onion in large chunks rather than quarters, and if you use 2 lbs grapes, you will want 2 lbs carrots, or it will be mostly grapes.  I added the carrots in during the last 15 -20 minutes of simmering, sprinkled on a bit more curry as well as some coarsely ground sea salt for added flavor.

I needed to use up a bag of grapes before it spoiled, so I was excited to find this recipe. I like the flavor of the grapes and the onions together, but it took 30 minutes to cook the carrots. Next time I'll let the carrots cook before I add the grapes and onions.

Carrots took much longer  to cook than the recipe time, so by the time they were a little soft, the onions were burning.

Good way to use a surfeit of grapes! I made this with muscadines, since that's what I had (they're big and have seeds, so they needed to be halved and seeded). Also parboiled the carrots (didn't have babies, so I cut up the big ones), and ended up roasting a bit longer 'cause the rest of the meal wasn't quite done. It was quite good! I'll use more cumin next time and maybe a touch of salt, or experiment with different seasonings.
