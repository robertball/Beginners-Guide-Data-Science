Great chili! Had about 2 lbs of venison, so I doubled the tomatoes, garlic, and onion. I added a chopped jalapeno to the onion garlic mix to give the chili some extra heat. I also added a can of kidney beans, and about a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon at the end, and ommitted the tomato paste, adding a few tablespoons of tomato sauce instead. I let it cook overnight (12+ hours) and it was the perfect consistency. I was SO tempted at the beginning to add some liquid to the pot, as it looked really thick. I'm glad I didn't because it made it's own "juice" during the cooking process. I love that it didn't need any salt added!

Gave it 4 stars as tomato paste made it too "tomatoey."  Added another can of diced tomatos.  1 can with 2 pounds of meat definitely not enough.  Will try again without the tomato paste.  This should tone down the tomato taste and the thickness.

I made this to freeze and bring on tour with my orchestra, and everyone who tried it went crazy over it!  I did a couple things wrong though: I had a solid 3 lb block of venison that had to be used all at once and used regular ground pork because I couldn't find any sausage!  Since I had way too much meat, I added a big can of crushed tomatoes to the slow cooker and thankfully everything came out fine anyway.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I had never made venison chili before and this was the best chili that I ever had.  My whole family loved it.  My three year old who has never liked chili before eats it right up.  I had to substitute a few ingredients because it is what I had.  I used a can of tomato sauce and a can of tomato soup instead of a can of tomato paste.  I left out the beans because we are not big bean eaters.  I used a packet and a half of chili seasoning instead of chili powder.  I will be making this recipe all winter.

The family is scraping the pot as we speak so I have to say it's a keeper.  The only change I'll make is either half the tomato paste or switch it with tomato soup next time because it was a little too tomatoey.  We add sour cream and cheese so it cut back on the tomato flavor in the end.  Great recipe!

Awesome recipe! Very tasty and easy to make. I modified a bit to accommodate what I had; I used cayenne pepper (2-3 dashes) because I didn't have chili powder. I also added about one cup of wine and substituted black beans instead of cannellini beans. It came out really great! Very satisfying. Thanks!

Fantastic!  My husband brought home some deer he caught last week for the first time and we needed some recipes.  This turned out wonderful.  We left out the beans, though.  We are not bean chili people.  It was still magnificint.  Added a tad bit more of the venison too.

This was my first venison recipe, and I'm so thrilled it turned out well. From reading the other reviews, I only added half of the tomato paste, and had 1 lb venison, 1 lb ground beef. This was a great recipe. For our personal taste, I will add a can of tomato sauce next time, as we like it with a bit more sauce.

Good recipe, thanks for sharing.  I did alter it a bit because I determined pretty early on that it was going to be much thicker than we like to serve it.  I did not have pork sausage so I added rosemary and salt and pepper to a lb of ground venison to mimic a sausage flavor.  I added it to the deer steak that the recipe called for. I also added in a can of red kidney beans, along with the white. I followed the recipe up to the point of adding it all together into the crockpot.  I then added a dash of Worstershire sauce, a dash of soy sauce, and about 1/4 cup of whiskey.  After the chili had cooked in the crock for about 4 hours, I added another 1/2 cup or so of water, as it was cooking dry.  It was a big hit.  Guests ate it in bowls, on hotdogs, and in Scoops chips topped with nacho dip.  I will make it again, thanks!

This was good, but not quite sure what it needed.  The only changes I made were 2 cans of beans and I added 1 small of can of tomato sauce and a mostly drained can of tomatoes.  I also only had 1/2 lb of sausage and ground venison.  Unlike most reviewers, I didn't think it was too tomatoey.  I did think it was a bit too thick, even with the added liquid.  It just seemed something was missing.  I have quite a bit of ground venison, so I'll be making it again and I think maybe I'll put some bell pepper, and maybe something more bbq?

Wonderful recipe! It has been a hit every time I make it. Have substituted antelope meat for the venison and added in some pork to make it go farther, and added a little more spice to make it a little hotter. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! Easy! Tried it and family loved it.  Sister can's cook and hates to cook. She tried it and her family loves it also. Now she has a recipe she feels confident about making. Win/Win situation :-)

I had to use a can of tomato sauce instead of paste and it turned out great. I served it over baked potatoes and the kids asked for seconds!! Super easy and hearty!

I made this with 1 lb. ground venison otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as is. I think next time I would omit the tomato paste and use tomato sauce along with more crushed or chopped tomatoes. Very good though as recipe directs. I was pleasantly suprised!

Incredible!!! This was my first shot (no pun intended) at venison chile.  It was super easy and it came out phenomenal. Only tweak I made was to add a can of kidney beans and I added another 10 oz of diced tomatoes.

A must make!!!!

Rave reviews from our company and zero leftovers!  I added some celery, a can of green chiles (I only had regular canned tomatoes) and a can of kidney beans to the recipe as written.

I took this recipe, and used the kidney beans, added corn, sliced olives, and instead of the tomato paste I added a can of crushed tomatoes and a touch of tomato sauce. Also adding in a dash of cinnamon definitely worked well. I also used venison breakfast sausage instead of pork sausage and it worked very well! Top it off with a dollop of sour cream and it is excellent!

Have this in the slow cooker now and am seriously looking forward to trying it! One note - in the recipe it does not say what to do wiht the chili powder... I just added it to the slow cooker with the other stuff, hope that's right!  :)

This is my first experience with venison, and I actually had ground venison mixed with ground beef, so that's what I used in this recipe.  I used the beans I had on hand - black and red kidney - and took the advice of others to use tomato soup in place of the tomato paste.  I also added a cup of red wine.  It was not the least bit spicy, so I guess we could have used more hot sauce or chili powder, and maybe some cayenne too!  But, the flavor was really nice and we enjoyed it.

I didn't have pork sausage or tomatoe paste. I used pasta sauce instead. Also used half red onion half white. I  had no cheese but it still tasted great! Oh yeah and added a tablespoon of Kroger's Private selection Chili de Arbul. Sooooo good makes a world of difference.

This recipe was very easy to follow and the chili tasted okay. I used 1 lb of ground venison instead of cubed as that is what I had on hand. After cooking on high for 5 hours, I thought the chili was underwhelming. I added garlic powder, onion powder, dried oregano, red pepper flakes, cumin, paprika and a little bit of sugar and cinnamon and it tasted much better! I topped mine with shredded cheese, corn bread and a little bit of sour cream. With these changes, I would give it 4 stars. Next time I make this, I will add a can of corn and substitute the tomato paste with either a can of tomato sauce or another can of diced tomatoes + 2 tbsp tomato paste :)

Update: Cooked with Elk rump steak, chopped Country Pork Ribs and chunked  Bacon pcs, Just Awesome! This was a very hearty chili, awesome for the cold season. Made a No Knead Beer Bread Loaf to go along with this chili! No changes made except I added a whole Corona Beer!

I used...
 
1 lb Venison(Burger), 1 lb Jimmy Dean Pork Sausage

1 /2 Large Yellow Onion Diced,1 Yellow Bell Pepper Diced

2 Jalapenos Seeded and Diced, 5 cloves garlic minced

Added an extra onion, a few fingerling potatoes, and a can of chipotles. Received tons of praise from my guests, and the bowl was rendered empty!

Tastes great!  Bringing this tomorrow when I go hunting.  My wife and I thought it was too thick so I added 3/4 can Budweiser Select, amazing.   I prefer the warmth of cyan pepper and used that in place of hot sauce.

This was an absolutely wonderful meal! I decided to only use venison for the meat source and added dried chilis..will definitely be coming back to this again this winter!

I changed the onion for red onion and used Chipotle hot sauce. I added two diced jalapeños to the onion and garlic to give it an extra kick. I used black beans instead of the ones they recommend. I also added Cayenne pepper and cumin to the chili powder. Overall it came out so good I couldnt share it with everyone because I ran out

Yaaay...big hit. The tomato paste was way to sweet...perhaps add less than the whole 6oz. We wanted it spicy so I added cayenne pepper to get the heat we wanted...only thing not shown in picture is the beer

This recipe is definitely a keeper. Made it today and the house smells wonderful and it tastes fantastic. Now, if I can keep my hands off of it till dinner time I will be doing great. Thanx for the recipe. I will be sure to make this again and again.
