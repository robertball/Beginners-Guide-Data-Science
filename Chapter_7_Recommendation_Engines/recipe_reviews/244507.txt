Loved this! I made this exactly as written. My topping wasn't really "crumbly", but more of a thick wet paste. I may have pulsed it a few seconds too long.  I wasn't too sure about the topping flavor before putting it on the salmon (the vinegar seemed overpowering), but it turned out amazing. The topping caramelizes with nice crispy edges. So good! I cooked the fish for 12 minutes and that was perfect for me - nice and juicy! I served it over garam masala-scented rice and roasted brussel sprouts. I can't wait to make this for company! Thanks Health Nut!

Loved the recipe! 
I just did little changes to suite my taste better: instead of apple vinegar, used about the same amount of lemon juice; instead of ground onion, used a pinch of ground ginger.

Knocked this outta the park!!! Someone suggested to add ground ginger so I did ( 1/2 teaspoon) ..... B-R-I-L-L-I-A-N-T !!!
I'm from Alaska so salmon is plentiful. Always looking for new ways to switch it up. Definitely will be making this again.

This was not bad, but not my favorite and I probably won't make it again. The combination of flavors was a little odd. On the bright side, the salmon was perfectly cooked!

With all of the positive reviews and that gorgeous picture by LilSnoo, I wanted to give this one a try. I made it as written, but these flavors just didn't work for my family. My husband and kids scraped off the top, and ate their salmon without it. I ate it as is, but it's not something that I'd make again. Sorry!

This was pretty good but if I make the next time, I would toast the pecans a bit, add a little extra vinegar for some tang, then determine what type of fresh herb would give this extra depth. Recommend salting the topping to taste prior to putting on fish. I added salt but it needed a tad bit more.

I’m making it for my second time today. Hoping it’s as wonderful as the first time. I just loved it and went to work raving about it to my coworkers. The only thing I did different was, I didn’t have chipotle, so I just used xtra smoked paprika.

One our favourite ways to enjoy salmon. The flavour feels decadent with the pecans and subtle maple taste, and the little zip of chipotle brightens it up nicely.

Made it a few times, sometimes without time to let it stand and it was fine; I patted the fillets dry and used Himalayan pink salt & fresh ground pepper. The rest of the ingredients were chopped & blended in my nifty hand cord-pulled Tupperware processor. Followed the directions as written, and it was a tasty dish that we'll make regularly.

Made this for my sister in law, she said it was restaurant quality! It was so good! 

Also brought it to my Aunt's house for a pot luck, now she keeps bugging me for the recipe! My uncle said it was his favorite dish.

Didn't have the apple cider vinegar on hand, so I used balsalmic, it was just as good if not better. I also subbed in red pepper flakes which added just the smallest amount of heat as an after bite. 

such a good recipe, I will definitely be making this often

I gave it 5 stars although I left out all the spices. I agreed with others who said the flavors didn't work for their family. What I did use was the maple syrup and pecans. Made a slurry out of the two and baked as per the instructions. I've been trying different recipes for hubby who loves salmon and this is his favorite recipe.

Unfortunately I don’t like this. The only reason I kept it as two stars is because I LOVE salmon, and I refused to waste it even if I don’t like it (which is rare seeing how I will even eat salmon that isn’t cooked all the way). The texture is weird since the pecans become somewhat softer when baked, but still hard enough to NOT go with the salmon. I actually made two separate salmons (the photo being the first) where in the second salmon, I substituted the Syrup with honey and a Tablespoon of Brown Sugar. It taste a bit better, but it’s not enough to persuade me to like it

This is my favorite salmon go-to now. So easy and so delicious. The pecan topping, which is thick and chunky, has just enough smokey heat to bring an extra dimension of flavor. I prepare a day ahead to let the flavors meld overnight in the fridge. Serve with roasted veggies for can’t miss meal!

My family loved this recipe. I followed it exactly except I only had a maple syrup honey blend, which actually turned out perfectly sweet with the slight heat of the chipotle.  This is going in the regular rotation for sure. Tonight we had it with a spinach salad featuring hard boiled eggs, bacon, and a maple honey vinegarette with garlic and ginger.

We loved this recipe! I didn’t have the chipotle pepper and used cayenne pepper instead and it was good but we will definitely try it with chipotle pepper next time.

This was really easy to make and was delicious! It took a lot longer in the oven than it said here, but still was really good.

Very unique and relatively simple salmon recipe.  I liked the combo of sweet/smoky and the added crunch of the pecans.

Made the recipe as is and we did not enjoy it. The salmon was overcooked after 12 minutes and the flavours were not to our liking and we usually enjoy sweet salmon but not this one. We scrapped the topping and than it was ok.

I used a little less maple syrup and included one tablespoon of olive oil to make the topping a little crisp.

Good salmon.   I subbed honey for the maple syrup,  The flavor of the paprika was a little strong for me.

This was incredible.  I olive-oiled the the skin side of the fish and put it on foil out on the grill.  My husband called it "restaurant worthy."

It tasted pretty good but it was a little too sweet for my preference. In retrospect I think I prefer savory recipes. If you like sweet foods this would be a good one.

So easy and delicious.   It was dinner time so I prepared it and cooked it immediately.  Also substituted chipotle sauce for the powder because I didn't have it.  Next time I will follow recipe as it can only get even better.

The first time I prepared it, I had company coming over and took a risk that it would be as good as it sounds. I left out the chipotle pepper powder since I did not have it in my pantry. Everyone loved it. One of my guests is on a gluten and wheat free diet. It was perfect for her.  Next time, I am going to try it on chicken.

I LOVED this. My husband thought it was okay. This is a good recipe and it's easy! How much you like it depends on how well you like the sweet and sour type dish... Although this was not sour, it is blending the taste of salmon with a sweet paste! I'll make it again but only for me, while I'll make hubby something else.

This was delicious! I didn't have apple cider vinegar, but I did have some Applewood Smoked Salt and used a half teaspoon of that with the regular vinegar and boy was it yummy.
