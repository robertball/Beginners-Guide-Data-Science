This was good, but didn't taste like Teriyaki.  I was disappointed as I really was looking forward to a Teriyaki steak.

I was greatly disappointed with this recipe. Perhaps it was the type of steak sauce I used but the majority of our steaks went uneaten and that is unheard of in this house. We definately wanted that "teriyaki" taste and just don't think it was strong enough.

For the steak sauce, I used Heinz 57. I later boiled the marinade to put on the finished grilled steaks. So yummy!

This was the first marinade I ever used when cooking steaks.  This was actually the first recipe that introduced me to this site (10+ years ago).  Since then, my palate has become more refined and I've moved onto better marinades (salt and pepper, butter and garlic, etc.) that don't mask the meat; however, every now and then I'll come back to this one when I have a sirloin and I want to switch things up a bit.

Not teriyaki flavored, but sweet nonetheless.

This was not our favorite, think some Teriyaki sauce may have helped this recipe.
