This was REALLY good! I decided to add 2 tablespoons of heavy cream instead of milk, and it really added a lot to the drink.

The taste is perfectly fine. My issue with the recipe is that I had a cheesy mess in the microwave from the milk getting too hot too fast. Milk scum was all over my mug, which was able to be taken out so it didn't end up in the drink, and I had a mess to clean up. Not sure what happened there but it's still good! I wanted to add a drop of mint extract to make it peppermint hot chocolate but I found out after I made the drink that I don't have any... so there's an idea for someone who wants to try it! Also, I suggest doubling the recipe because 3/4 c of milk isn't that much to drink. All in all, the recipe is still good but I think some could be added to it to make it amazing!

This is an excellent recipe for a quick cup of delicious cocoa. I used one tbsp vanilla sugar instead of extract and white sugar. Also, in step one, I bloomed my cocoa in two tbsp of hot water instead of the milk. Thank you for the recipe.
