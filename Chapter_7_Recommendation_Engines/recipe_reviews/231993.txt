I really enjoyed this simple vinaigrette and followed the recipe to a "T" which is rare for me.  I had all the ingredients on hand, so it was quick and easy.  It's very light and doesn't have the usual vinegary tang... I love it both ways, but this was a refreshing change of pace.  It calls for a LOT of parsley, but I think that is what keeps it tasting lemony and light even with the sharper flavors of lime and capers... so don't be afraid of the parsley!
I can see how it would taste wonderful with seafood as Tatiana suggested in her description.  I served it with a spinach and romaine salad, threw in some red onion, peeled/seeded/diced cucumber, both fresh and roasted red peppers, and a little parm.  Very fresh and light which complemented my other ingredients.
For serving purposes, FYI... I used about 2/3 of a "bunch" of spinach and the same amount of a "head" of romaine along with the veggies listed above, and there was plenty of dressing.  I find that most salads taste best when they aren't drowning in dressing but gently tossed with a modest amount, and this is no exception.  This recipe actually yields enough for about 6 servings.

The flavor lacked a little so I added a little more lime and salt
