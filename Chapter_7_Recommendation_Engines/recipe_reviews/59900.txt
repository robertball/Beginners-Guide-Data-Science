To start with, let me say that I am Mexican, living in mexico and probably my english will not be very good, so I will try my best to make this review. If you come to Mexico, this is what you will get if you order enchiladas in a restaurant. This is the REAL and authentic enchilada and we always make fun of the "mexican" food in the US. 

Let me give you some advice on how to ensure this doesnt go wrong. When using tomatillos buy the smallest ones, because the bigger are bitter. The peppers you cand reduce or increase the amount depending on how hot you like it, it really depends on your taste. When you fry the tortilla, it doesnt mean deep-fry... you just coat it in really hot oil. The tortilla still has to be flexible enough to manage and after you fill the tortilla with the chicken, put the salsa on top. Instead of salt use chicken broth powder (sorry if thats not the name, but I hope you know what I mean). The enchiladas are served with sour cream, queso fresco and onion. Now, I have never seen queso fresco (mexican cheese) in the US... but again, I dont live there. I guess now in the mexican stores they might sell it but whatever cheese you have is fine i guess. And I guess you can add the cilantro for extra flavor.

Im glad that people know how to make REAL enchiladas in the US

These were, in my husband's words, "Boombastic Baby!"  The only complaint we had is that there wasn't enough verde sauce.  DOUBLE THE SAUCE! It's AWESOME! I followed the basic idea of the recipe, making these few changes.  After frying the tortillas and dipping in salsa verde, I filled with sour cream, the chicken, some onions and the cheese.  Rolled them up, put them in a 9x13 pan, covered with remaining salsa verde and cheese and baked in a 425 degree oven till the cheese was melty.  We only wished they were SWIMMING in this AWESOME sauce!

As a follow-up to my previous review, I made the salsa from this recipe again this time using serranos and I have to say that they gave the sauce a much better flavor than the jalapenos. I added them one by one to the blender  (one serrano was plenty to give it a "kick" but not overpower the flavor with heat...but others may like to add more. 5 serranos would have been insane for us!). I also found that it was best to add the chicken stock gradually instead of all at once, until you were happy with the consitancy because the amount of liquid in the recipe can make the sauce too watery otherwise. Very yummy and easy to make. I will be making this verde salsa often!

I am Mexican and this is a wonderful recipe.  Few tips: if you can fill the tortillas with chicken and FRY to make the perfect taco then dip in green sauce you`ll get crunchier enchiladas...if you only top the fried tortilla soaked in salsa and top with chicken you are having "tostadas de pollo".  Anyway you go you can top your dish with lettuce, sour cream, crumbled cheese, chopped onion and cilantro...mmmm...Thumbs up PattyVerde!! great recipe girl!!!

I tried to stick with the recipe as closely as possible, but ultimately had to put my own spin on this. It's hard to teach an old dog new tricks! I deviated a bit by mixing up the cooked chicken with just enough sour cream to bind it. When I filled the tortillas with the chicken, I also added a handful of shredded Mexican cheese blend to each. I did top them with the salsa (used only two Serranos), which I sieved to get rid of the seeds and make  as smooth as possible, the Queso Fresco (good stuff, by the way), thinly sliced onion, and chopped cilantro - and finally, a dollop of sour cream. I SO enjoyed these! Homemade salsa, I believe, makes all the difference! I made half the recipe of enchiladas but kept the amount of salsa the same and it was just right.  For us, anyway, the amount of sauce as written in the recipe would not have been enough. I did resist the temptation to bake these, as that's what I'm used to. I loved them like this, but have to say I still prefer the NON-authentic method of baking them, topped with a mess of gooey, melted cheese!

Wow.  This recipe is fabulous.  I did make a few changes, but not with the green sauce, which made the recipe superb. (Though did only add 3 serranos per others suggestion).  I used 3 boneless skinless breasts and prepared as directed, also sauteed some onion and garlic with the shredded chicken. Rolled up like regular enchiladas with mexican blend cheese and sauce inside and out, topped with more cheese, and baked for 20 minutes so they'd already be assembled.  Served with extra sauce on the side.  
Best enchiladas I've ever had! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

excellent, authentic sauce! the only modifications I made was to strain the pureed tomatillo mix back into the saucepan after blending and simmered until the consistency of light tomato sauce.  The straining after blending removes all of the seeds, skins and other bits of solids. Enchilada sauce should be very smooth...it's not a salsa.
Don't be worried about the heat (I used 3 huge jalapenos)because the corn tortilla needs a strong flavor compliment. I have also used this for Chilaquilles verdes for breakfast... a very adaptable sauce. Also congradulations for a recipe with the Mexican style of enchiladas.. you will never find those swimming in sauce, bbaked mushy things south of the border! Thanks!!!

I'm making it again for about the 10th time. It is our go to sauce for anything "Mexican". I plan to poach eggs this morning and serve with fried tortilla's. I always double or triple the recipe and use it all week.  It also freezes well. The only changes I make are to use chicken stock instead of water and what ever chili'e I have in the garden.

The flavor was good but the consistency/texture leaved a lot to be desired. I shouldn't have shredded the chicken quite so finely for a start. But it also needed something to provide some bite - corn or bell peppers or something. With some tweaking, this could be really excellent.

These were great. I couldn't find tomatillos so i used green tomatoes not realizing the difference.  The package of peppers only said "hot" peppers and they were small, long and thin so I used them.  I cooked four along with the tomatoes, but then used only two with the tomatoes in the food processor.  Boy and I'm glad I did.  It was plenty spicy.  If this is your first time, I would suggest cutting down the peppers.  You can always kick it up by separately blending them in later.  
Will definitely make again.

Some modifications:  To make the enchiladas:   spray both sides of the tortillas lightly with Olive Oil and lay them on a cookie sheet in stacks of two.  Heat them in a 350°F oven just until they're soft and pliable, about 3 minutes.  Turn off oven, leave cookie sheet in and pick one tortilla at a time to fill.  All tortillas will remain pliable for stuffing.  FOR THE FILLING:  In a large bowl,  I combine the chicken,  shredded cheddar and Pepper Jack cheese,  chopped onion, salt, AND  ADD 1/2 cup of the sauce to the chicken mixture and toss to combine.  I also add some whipping cream to the sauce before filling the tortillas 
I place them in a 9 x 13 baking dish as I fill them, then pour remaining sauce over and top with queso frisco and more cheddar and jack cheese.  Bake 20-25 minutes or until warm through and sauce is bubbly.

Very easy and simple recipe to follow. We just heat our tortillas over open flame and skipped the oil. Beware: Even my Mexican partner thought the sauce a tad too hot. I might lower to 4 chiles next time (and we like things with a kick!). Great presentation on the plate with the enchiladas, extra sauce spooned over, and topped with a smattering of the cheese, onion and cilantro. *Very* authetic looking and tasting. This is a keeper.

What a wonderful recipe! Thanks for giving me the courage to make this from scratch and not out of the can!  I used leftover chicken from a chicken I baked, put just a little sour cream and green onions in with the chicken.  I didn't use the full serrano peppers called for, thanks to those that said to add it one by one!  Although I did add 3 and when I tasted it I thought it was way too spicy, but when it is just the sauce in the dish the rest of the ingredients tone it down and it was just perfect!  Don't be scared of working with foreign ingredients (tomatillos for me) the sauce was just as easy as making a homemade tomato sauce.  Thank you!

Very nice, although I add chopped onions and cotija cheese to the shredded chicken. Also, I like to add a dollop of sour cream to top off the enchiladas.

This is the first time I have cooked/prepared food with tomatillas. This recipe was fun. I had to improvise.  I didn't have any Serrano peppers so I seasoned with my habenero sauce (Bob's Fire Sauce from this site) and red pepper chili flakes.  My only regret is I didn't have enough of the sauce.  I will definitely make this again... definitely.  Thanx for the recipe.

Let me start by saying I was born and raised in NJ and spend 4 years in the late 80's in Arizona and fell in LOVE with authentic mexican food.  Since I moved back east, I have been unable to find a "true" mexican restaurant or traditional recipes.  This was truly AMAZING!!   My son and his friends came home to watch the Jets game and were saying how amazing the house smelled.  They could not stop eating them.  Delicious!  Thank you Patti -- This will easily become one of my families "favorites".

Wow! These taste just like the ones at my favorite restaurant. Next time I will double the salsa.  There was not enough for my liking. I'd also recommending adding the peppers 1 at a time to the salsa so you can adjust the heat to your liking.  I ended up using 3 & I like things hot.  Add the broth gradually to the blender to adjust the salsa's consistance to your liking. I used monterey jack cheese because I couldn't find queso fresco. I used flour tortillas which I didn't fry.  I dipped them in the salsa and then filled them with chicken, cheese & salsa.  Next I rolled them up, placed them in a glass baking dish, topped them with cheese and cilantro and baked them for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. Viola!

Like many others, my only complaint with this recipe was that it didn't make enough salsa verde! Other than that, it was a phenomenal enchiladas verdes recipe I made for my husband and some of his friends, one of whom is from a Spanish family and even he thought these were fantastic enchiladas! My husband, the world's pickiest eater who had already shot down two previously tried enchilada recipes, adored these!
I changed the salsa verde recipe a little to suit our tastes, used a pound of tomatillos, five serranos, one jalapeno, and one anaheim (we like spicy!). It was perfect for my taste, but my husband said it could stand to have a little more spice. Next time I'm DEFINITELY doubling the salsa recipe! Also, for my husband's preference when these were assembled I put them in a baking dish, topped with the remaining salsa, queso fresco, and a bag of sharp cheddar (that's the only other cheese we had) and baked them in a 375 degree oven for fifteen minutes so the cheese was melty. He loves melted cheese on EVERYTHING, but I personally would have enjoyed them best just as the recipe calls. I ended up with about twenty fantastic enchiladas! Thanks for this great recipe!

This is going in the Family Favorites folder, to be made again and again.  I can see it being handed down the generations, starting with me, to my daughter, to her children, and so on.  The only things I did different: because some folks had said the serranos made the verde sauce too hot for their taste, I put all the cooked tomatillos in food processor and blended, and then blended in the cooked serranos one by one until the heat was to our liking; the other change, because I'm pregnant and not supposed to eat queso fresco: after I rolled all the enchiladas in a 9X13, I poured the sauce over and sprinkled colby-jack on top and then popped the whole thing in the microwave for just a couple of minutes.  So good, so easy!  Also, I used the left over broth from making the chicken to make a really easy and decilicious homemade soup, using a little of the boiled chicken, some chopped carrots and parsley, and orzo.  Only a couple of servings worth, but muy delicioso, as were the enchiladas...gracias!!!

This is was to die for. It was so good, easy, and inexpensive. The first night, I made it exactly as directed but the second night, I dipped the tortillas in the salsa before frying and they still had the flavor but the added bonus of a crunch and more of a toasty flavor.

These were phenomenal!  Some in our group wanted the Queso Fresco, some wanted Jack or Cheddar and some wanted Jack & Cheddar.  Some wanted the cheese melted in the oven or microwave, some not at all.  Some wanted it topped with Cotijo after the verde sauce was poured over it.  No matter what, everyone raved about it!

These were everything we expected and more! I was very very pleased with this recipe. Living in south Texas in the heart of mexican food country we are very critical of mexican food because we are used to the "real stuff". This was the same (okay, better) as we are used to getting in the taquerias here. I've made these numerous times, they are my "go to" recipe for enchiladas verde. I used chicken breast meat because I don't like dark meat. I used monterey jack and queso fresco because I only had a little of either. I warmed the tortillas on a flat dry griddle until they were flexible instead of frying in oil and dipping in the sauce which is great, but time consuming, difficult working with a hot wet tortilla, and a little messy. The salsa verde is delicious and I will be making it over and over again! The first couple of bites I thought wow this is a bit on the hot side, and considered using less serrano peppers next time, but after eating the cooled salsa with tortilla chips, it was perfect and not too hot for us after all. I wouldn't change a thing! One reviewer commented it made way too much sauce, but we loved that there is still some left because this is way better than store bought. I wish now I'd doubled the salsa recipe so we could keep some on hand. My hubby has been eating the rest of it with tortilla chips and said he can't stop it is sooooo good. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!

These are AMAZING!!!! If I use chicken bouillon, I leave out the salt, otherwise I do everything the same. Every person we have served these to has asked for the recipe!

A bit time consuming, but I love these enchiladas.  I cut back a bit on the heat.  Following suggestions, I add the broth in gradually to the tomatillos in the blender.  I usually need very little.  I also like to add a bit of jack cheese inside my enchiladas and heat up my chicken in a bit of the simmering green sauce just to give it a bit more flavor.  Yum!

Absolutely loved this recipe!  Lived in San Diego for many years and have had this many times at authentic Mexican Resaurants...this recipe is spot on!  We forgot to cover the saucepan when boiling the chicken for 20 minutes, so we were left w/ very little broth to add to the Tomatillos/peppers, etc in the blender when it was done.  We adjusted by just heating up 2 more cups of broth, then adding it to the blender as directed.  You may want to put in a little less broth in the blender than what is directed.  We filled the blender to about 1 inch above the food in the blender as directed, and it came out a bit too liquidy for what we wanted.  We will simply add less broth to get the sauce to a thicker consistency next time.  We can't wait to make these for our next Cinco De Mayo party w/ friends!

This was an excellent dish! I rarely give five stars, so don't let the four stars fool you. I took the advice of another poster and strained out some of the solids in the sauce for a smoother texture, and it was amazing! As far as the heat content; muy bueno! My hubby and I love spicy food, and the kids as well although I didnt add any extra sauce to the kids plate. I used all five serranos and it wasn't overwhelming. If you enjoy hot salsa at your fav mexican restaurant, you'll like this sauce just fine. I did toss the shredded chicken in a bit of sourcream before wrapping them. Hubby said they were as good as my homeade cheesy chicken enchiladas with red sauce, and thats saying a lot. I get weekly requests for that from friends and family!

This recipe was good. I made a few adjustments. I replaced the cheese with Monterey Jack. I also wrapped the Monterey Jack in with the chicken. I placed all the enchiladas in a baking dish and poured all the remaing sauce on top. Covered it with cheese and put it in the oven till cheese melt.

They are awesome! I just made the following changes... I only used 3 peppers, which gave it just enough kick!  and I added mozzarella cheese inside them.  I took the advise of other reviewers and made a little extra sause!  Will be making this again!

This is without a doubt the best recipe for enchiladas. The verde salsa is dead on authentic! Excellent! I added some cilantro to the salsa, and might add some lime juice next time for a different flavor.

All I can say is WOW! This is an awesome recipe! I can honestly say that this is the best recipe I have ever found at allrecipes.com, and I've been using this website for over 5 years! I decided to prepare this recipe last minute for dinner. Which probaby wasn't the best idea, because this recipe does take time. My husband loved it! I didn't serve it to the children, because I thought it would be too spicy for them. I was wondering what I could substitute for serrano peppers that would not make it spicy? My suggestion would be to prepare the chicken and the salsa in advance. You could then reheat the salsa for the tortillas. I also would suggest to mix some chicken with the salsa and chopped onions, and then reheat it over the stove. This way it's nice and hot when you fill the tortilla, and it takes away some of the extra zest in the onion (if you prefer a milder onion taste). And then top with the cheese and cilantro. Wonderful Recipe!

Absolutely delicious and authentic. I am a young Mexican cook and I needed a little help from an online recipe for my first attempt at enchiladas. This is as authentic as you can get.

I like my enchiladas a little wet, so I doubled up on the salsa recipe, but cut down on the spice (I have a sensitive stomach). I used 3 peppers for 2 pounds of tomatillos (double the amount), and it gave it a nice little non-burning kick! If you enjoy that burning sensation, then I'd suggest you add a little more. (I think 5 peppers/1 pounds of tomatillos would be extreme though!)

On top I added julienne iceberg lettuce, watery sour cream (watered down with milk, not actual water), sliced radishes, and cilantro. Don't forget about the rice and beans!

I served this to a group of hungry college buddies, and the guys would not stop showering me with compliments. They are convinced on marrying a Mexican woman because of this recipe :)

A hit with the family. I  made two varieties of  the enchiladas.  A row of enchiladas with chicken and cheese, and a row with chicken, black bean, and cheese. I will definitely be making these often.

Everyone I made this for absolutely loved it! I made a few alternations, instead of using corn tortillas, I used flour since that is what my boyfriend and his parents are used to eating. His parents said that it couldn't get much more authentic! Thanks for this amazing recipe!

Used mozzarella instead of queso fresco. Used only 3 peppers without the seeds and membrane. Very fresh and authentic tasting. Worth the effort.

Very good recipe!  I agree, this is very authentic and, subsequently, a laborious process.  My mother used to do everything pretty much the same way but she'd skip the tortilla frying part and would just dip them in the sauce.  Then, she'd assemble each and place them in a casserole dish, covering everything with cheese and the remaining enchilada sauce.  Most store-bought corn tortillas hold up well without frying because they are so dry.  After baking at 350 degrees until the cheese is bubbly, you end up with "Tex-Mex" enchiladas with an authentic taste.

Came together must faster that I thought, (with boiling-blending etc.) I can easily make this dish in the middle of the week. It was sooo tasty. My co-worker once described to me about how her latino husband makes enchiladas verdes, she described how he does this same frying/dipping method and I was curious. Well, that is what totally make the dish, not only is the verdes sauce delicious the crunch from the tortilla is great! Since there is only two of us in the house we had left overs and just warmed the chicken and sauce, super quick. Will make again and again. Thank you

These were fantastic! We had these last night and my mouth is still watering for them. I only used 3 serranos, seeds in, as others suggested and it was pretty hot, but it was that good hot where I couldn't stop eating it. After blending, I strained the sauce back into a pot and added arrowroot to thicken. I had also made my own corn tortillas the day before and they were amazing with this! We weren't really sure how to eat these so we folded them up like a taco. Excellent!! The only thing I would do different next time is to squeeze a fresh lime over the top. Thank you so much for this recipe!! I think I'll have the leftovers for breakfast.

I can my own green salsa verde every year, so I used a pint of canned salsa verde verses making the fresh which made this recipe really quick to make, my family gave this rave reviews. I have also used left over pork butt roast just shred the meat verses the chicken it is excellant both ways.

A friend of mine gave me a whole bag of Tomatillos from his garden.  When searching for a recipe to use them in I came across this one and I'm so glad I did!  It is fabulous!  I rolled the enchiladas and baked them in the oven for about 20 minutes.  I added a bit of Pepper Jack cheese inside but it really didin't need it.  Hubby was giving me "thumbs up" with every bite and a "high five" after dinner, then took leftovers for lunch the next day.  Guess that says it all.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

This was really good. We grew our own tomatillos and serrano chilies, so we made this and will do so again. I doubled the recipe and heeded the warning of using less peppers. Our hot peppers are hotter than any I have ever bought so even though I used only 3 in a double recipe, it still had a pretty good burn. I also added some sour cream to the mixture in the enchiladas because of that and it tamed it. Yum!!!

GREAT recipe. After frying the tortollas I dip them in the sauce and then filled them with the chicken. Topped with some lighty sauteed onions and sour cream. Great recipe will definately make again! Careful though....the peppers are HOT.

This was SOOOOO good! My son wanted me to make an authentic recipe, so I searched for one and came across this one.  The only change I made was to bake the enchiladas in the oven for about 20 minutes at 350.  Wow, is this just a flat out great recipe!  P.S.  If you are afraid it will be too hot, don't worry!  My family doesn't like really hot food and they loved this!!

I made this yesterday and it was very good. The verde sauce is amazing--but for our taste, 5 serranos would be too much heat. I used 2 serranos and it was plenty. In addition to the ingredients in the recipe, I added about 2 tbsp of cumin. I used yellow corn torillas and instead of heating them on the stove, I dipped them in the hot salsa and rolled them with the chicken, added cilantro and chopped green onions and mexican cheese. The left over mexican cheese I sprinkled on top and added more monteray jack and cheddar. Baked for 30 minutes and 350 degrees and served with spanish rice with homemade guacamole and sour cream as garnish. The next time I think I will add the sour cream to the chicken mixture and try the salsa with a habanero (scotch bonnet) pepper. Thank you for this excellent recipe!

Good authentic recipe, the only thing I change because of family tradition is boiling the tomatillos and peppers before mixing them in the blender, You can puree them raw and then boil the mixture and season with some salt.

These turned out fantastic!  I followed other reviewers advice and doubled the sauce.  Definitely a good idea.  Also added less serrano peppers (I used all 5 but I doubled the rest of the ingredients for the sauce).  Add them one at a time and taste before adding more.  I used only 1 tsp of salt and used low-sodium chicken broth which worked well.  After dipping the tortillas I rolled each one up with chicken, a little cheese, and a few teaspoons of the sauce inside each one.  Added more sauce on top along with shredded montery jack, the onions, and cilantro.  Baked at 325 for about 20 minutes until cheese on top melted.  Served extra sauce on the side.  Also if you like this recipe try 'Taqueria Style Tacos - Carne Asada' from this site as well, equally delicious.

This recipe cooks up some YUMMY enchiladas, which are not only authentic, but delicious! In addition to the cilantro and onions, my family likes the addition of chopped avocado.

These were fantastic!  Just like the enchiladas at our favorite restaurant.  My husband prepared them and followed the recipe exactly.  We squeezed some fresh lime juice over the tops, and they were SO good!  They were slightly too spicy for me, but since my husband loves heat, we'll definitely make them again.  All you need is a margarita!

Great and easy recipe!! Very authentic sauce. I will make it and serve it as cold salsa for dipping tortilla chips or you could use it for a traditional pork Mexican dish! I will never buy can sauce again! I made it exactly and it was AWSOME. I rolled them all up and put them in a dish and poured the rest of the sauce on top and topped with a bit of jack cheese. I let people top with onion and/or cilantro if they wanted. It is pretty spicy, which we all loved. If you are not into lots of spice, cut back on the peppers. Great recipe, I will make it for company very soon!

First let me say I rarely give 5 stars.  That is for food that is "Thank God for this food!".  That said, the adults gave this a 4 star (we love mexican) and the kids gave it 2 stars (they don't).  We also used only 2 peppers based on what others said.

Make with chips, salsa, flan, and margaritas and it is a mexican night!

Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!  My main adjustment was the serrano peppers.  I cooked 3 with the  tomatillos, and only ended up using 1 and a 1/2, the sauce was perfect ( and I LOVE hot stuff).  My experience with peppers, is you have to experiment with them.  The same exact pepper and be less hot or more hot depending on when and where you buy them.  I used fresh tortillas from the market, so there was no need to fry them, I just dipped them in the sauce, stuffed and rolled.  I also made some with Asadero cheese only and topped them all with Cotija cheese.

Amazing Enchiladas, and worth the extra prep time! I too recommend making extra Verde sauce; it's mindblowing on chips, long after the main dish is gone (which will be fast) and better than the pricey green salsa you'll find in the grocery. Like some other reviewers, I also assembled and baked the entire works in a casserole dish with a little extra cheese and sauce on top. I used the recommended 5 Serrano peppers and didn't find it too hot, but I do prefer things spicy. I thought the serving amount to be more than just 4 servings, more like 6. (All the more to enjoy!)

This recipe was awesome! Coming from a 1st generation immigrant family who always makes red sauce and never green, this was a crowd pleaser.  I added a tblsp of Knorr (chicken bouillon)instead of the salt.  It thickened and seasoned the salt.  Otherwise, great!

Very very good! I have never made verde sauce but always loved having it in mexican restaurants. This was very good though not quite as flavorful and a bit thin. I will add less chicken broth to the cooked tomatillos (to the top of the veggies not an inch over) prior to blending next time and see if it doesn't make a thicker sauce. I did simmer it quite a long time trying to get it less watery. I also removed the seeds from the chilis prior to cooking as they are very hot. (This may be the  reason why it was not as flavorful.) Be sure to wear plastic gloves to do this as the seeds burn the hands. Lots of work but I will definitely make this again. My husband was impressed and we both want to serve this for company. We especially like that it is more like authentic mexican than most of the mexican recipes we have used. Thanks for a winner!

Why go to a restaurant when you can get authentic taste at home? A time saving tip the day of, is to make the meat and sauce ahead of time. The assembly only takes a few minutes for each enchilada. Amazing!

These were AMAZING!  I was very proud of myself for pulling them off, being as "white" as I am!  The only thing I added to the recipe was topping them all with the queso fresco and then baking them on 420 for 20 mins to melt the cheese.  That did make them fall apart more when dishing them up, but they were so good we didn't care.  They were pretty spicy for my taste, but again, I'm a true 'white girl'.  I was sweating and my boyfriend was laughing at me.  They tasted amazing though!!!

Fantastic authentic enchiladas verdes! I steamed the tortillas though to save on fat and calories. I recommend putting the chiles in one at a time, blending, then taste and adjust as to not overheat the sauce for sensitive pallets!

Excellent!!!  I used 3 serranos & it was a bit spicy.  I also topped them with the leftover sauce, sprinkled the top with a bit of shredded cheese & stuck them in the oven at a very low temp for a few.  Mainly because I was waiting for my room mate to come down for dinner.  Although, I am pretty sure I will make this my final step for the next time I make these.  They turned out splendid.  Next time I will cut a serrano out of the recipe & sub jalapeño for serrano.  I like heat, but it was a bit too much for me.  Serranos are a wopping 10,000 to 23,000 on the Scoville scale. I will stick with the 2,500 to 8,000 jalapeño for next time!  Or at least cut the seeds out of the serranos...

These enchiladas were wonderful, but I took other people's advice and used only two serrano peppers.  I am Mexican-American and love hot stuff, but I knew my preteen kids would note be able to tolerate the heat.

Also, I doubled the recipe like some people recommended.  I did end up having some left over which I threw over as a topping the next day for tacos.  Really yummy, but probably would have been too hot with 5 peppers.

***Believe it or not, but those of you who are watching your weight/fat content, you can soften the tortillas using only cooking spray.  You do not need oil unless you're making tostadas.  We need to cut the fat out whenever we can, so use spray as an alternative.  You'll be surprised.  Mexican food does not need the high fat.

WOW WOW WOW! AS I WAS MAKING THESE I THOUGHT THEY WERE GONNA BE ALRIGHT BUT AS MY HUSBAND SAID THESE ARE SOOOO GOOD. I MADE IT EXACTLY I HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH SAUCE, I THINK WHAT I DID WAS ADD TOO MUCH BROTH IN THE BLENDER BUT I CORRECTED IT BY ADDING CHEESE ON TOP OF ROLLED ENCHILADAS ALONG WITH  SAUCE AND BAKING IT ON 425 FOR 15 MIN. I THAN PUT SOME QUESO FRESCO AND CHOPPED CILANTRO ON TOP ALONG WITH SOUR CREAM. THIS ALSO COOLED DOWN THE CHILI SO MY KIDS COULD ENJOY THEM TOO.

This is really a good recipe, some suggestions are to whisk in some sour cream into the finished sauce along with the juice of one lime. Make two batches so you can freeze some.

This is a totally awesome recipe...  Whenever I mention making enchiladas, this is the recipe my family begs for.  The green sauce is definitely what makes this recipe and as many others have said, there's never enough of it for me.  You won't go wrong if you try this.

My difficult-to-please parents loved this recipe.  Although it isn't the easiest to make, it is well worth the effort.

I love Mexican food and this hit the spot perfectly. I found the spice perfect, maybe even a tad mild, next time I might throw another pepper or two in there. And a nice little time saver is to buy the already fried corn tortillas, takes a little while to soften back up but worth not having to deal with hot oil and splatters in the kitchen. I can't wait to make this for company!

This is great tasting.  I omitted the serranos and substituted canned diced green chiles.  I also omitted the onions in the final step - my family doesn't prefer raw onions.  I put cheese inside as well as on top and I substituted a combo of cheddar and mozarella cheese.  I will definately make again.

These are so good. My fiance makes me make them every sunday. I however have changed a few things such as cooking the Chicken in the crock-pot with the onions and garlic and chicken-broth.  I also add less serrano peppers and use extra garlic.  Add some embasa salsa verde to the recipe when blending in the blender.

this recipe is amazing! i loved it and so did the rest of the family. i took other reviewers advice and added the serrano peppers one at a time (we ended up using 2 1/2). The only thing I would change is to make more salsa because it's really yummy and to use more chicken. thanks for sharing!

This recipe is delicious and very authentic tasting, however BEWARE, 5 serrano peppers is VERY spicy and I love spicy food.  I can eat the real hot food, but this was little much.  Definitely tone down and add the peppers one at a time to heat to taste.  IF YOU WANT TO IMPRESS, use this recipe.

This one was an "OK" for me.  The verde sauce was good, but the rest was "so so".  I was expecting more.  I tried the recipe as written and then I used flour tortillas.  Maybe I'm too used to tex-mex.

For a nonMexican cook like me, this is truly a Mexican Restaurant creation that I can now cook at home.  Always used to have trouble dealing with the tomatillos. Not anymore!

Other reviewers were right about making extra sauce...it was fantastic! I assembled and baked the enchiladas. I even made an extra pan and froze it for later. The frozen pan was just as good as the first.

This was delicious!  I used boneless chicken breasts, and one jalapeno pepper instead of the serrano peppers.  I used the chicken in burritos with monterery jack cheese.  Wonderful!

Excellent.  A few suggestions...add cilantro into the blender when making the verde sauce.  Also, reheat the shredded chicken in a saucepan on low and mix in some sour cream.  Believe it or not, if you can't find queso fresco, crumbled feta works quite well.

These were so good!  The sauce was excellent: nice and spicy!  They are a bit of work, but if you have help in the kitchen (chopping, etc.), you can cut down the time it takes to make them to about an hour.  They're worth it!  I had some leftover sauce and am looking forward to using as a dip for chips or on other Mexican dishes.

I feel like I worked on this all day today and I don't know if it was worth it.  I did not fry the tortillas, just warmed them in the microwave for a few seconds to soften them up.  My ingredients were kind of cold so I put the enchiladas in the oven just until the cheese melted.

I made this last night and,oh my word, it was amazing! It was extremely easy and turned out perfect. I have two small children so I only used 2 serrano peppers. I never cooked with them before so I wasn't sure of the heat.  I'm glad I did because my two year old says, Ooooh Spicey! but she still ate it.  I would have liked 3, so I just added some Chulula hot sauce to mine.  I also added some some sauce to the chicken before rolling up, and baked it in the oven for 20 minutes so the cheese was bubbly. I posted a picture online and now have dinner requests. You must make this!

Doubled the sauce by others recommendations, used thighs because that's what I had on hand, and I baked them with cheese on top and the end results were so good I will never make another enchilada recipe again.

I love to try new things, but I am very fussy when it comes to the foods I truly love. I have had very few chicken enchiladas that I really like. We visited a restaurant in San Diego CA many years ago that had the most delicious chicken enchiladas, and I can tell you I have been disappointed with chicken enchiladas in nearly every other capacity since. Until I tried these! WOW!!! These are WONDERFUL! I have tried this recipe three times. It is divine every time! This is a keeper! If I could rate it 12 stars I would!!!! My husband loves these as well! In MHO it is best as is... I love to experiment, but the way this recipe is put together is truly the way to make it.

Super good!!!  Taste was awesome and authentic.  We thought that the sauce would be too thin and too hot, but not to worry when you put it back on to boil it thickens right up and the flavors blend so nicely when added to the chicken, tortillas, cilantro, and sour cream.

I thought this was an excellent recipe. We enjoyed the sauce although I did add a little cilantro directly to the sauce as opposed to topping with it as I felt it just needed a little "brightening".  Thanks for the recipe!

The flavor profile of this recipe is excellent and I will definitely make it again.  But next time I will take another reviewers advice and strain the sauce - because I found the texture of all the seeds detracted from the excellent flavors.
I also made a few changes:  I added sour cream, some shredded jack cheese and some of the sauce to the chicken before I rolled it in the "flash-fried" corn tortillas.  Made for a very rich filling.
A delicious recipe - thanks for sharing!

I loved this authentic-style recipe! I did follow the suggestions of Rosa Marina. The salsa turned out great - admittedly when I tried it after boiling it it seemed too spicy, but served with tortillas and fresh tomatoes, cilantro, and cheese was perfect! My husband loved it! I will definitely make this again. Frying the tortillas somehow creates a wonderful flavor with the salsa and chicken. I will admit, I did not have any corn tortillas or queso fresco (which I usually buy at Walmart), and so I filled my fried flour tortillas with the chicken and some cilantro, rolled them up and placed them in a 9x13 pan. Then I poured salsa all over the top and shredded cheese over that and baked at 400 for about 10 minutes, then broiled at 425 for maybe 10 more. I love corn tortillas and believe the recipe could be even better as written. Thanks for sharing!

This was amazing!!!  I made it with fresh tomatillos & onion & garlic & cilantro out of my garden and it was great!!  Next time I will add a sour cream/cream of chicken to my chicken mixture just because I like it that way but as is, it was AWESOME!

I wish I could give this more stars! This was incredible. I've never really liked enchiladas, but I'm used to having them with red chile. These.... These may be the greatest enchiladas ever!! I read other reviews and became afraid of the serranos and only added two. I wish I would have used more. Otherwise, I made them as written.

This was wonderful!  The only change I made was to reduce the serrano peppers from 5 to 3.  Oh, I also forgot to add the cilantro!  Will definitely make again and again!!

Great recipe! Like everyone else, I added my own twist.  I had to make enough for 25 people.  I first thought I'd make some with chicken, some with shrimp, and some with spinach.  But as the list of people get getting longer and time was running out, I changed the filling.  I put the chicken in a bowl, added sour cream, chopped spinach, queso fresca, onions and cilandro and it made a chunky paste that was easy to fill the tortillas with by hand. I did the same thing with chopped shrimp instead of chicken. Rolled them and covered with the sauce.  I topped with jack cheese and melted it in the oven. I ended up with 4 jelly roll pans full and they were all gone.  To save time, I used roasted chicken from the grocery store. I cut it up the night before as I had to feed these people at 12:00 the next day.  Everyone loved them and wanted to take some home.

These were delicious and very authentic! We boiled the chicken for 20 minutes to get it cooked thoroughly. Don't be alarmed when the salsa looks too liquid when it comes out of the blender, it reduces greatly when you let it simmer in the pan. Quite delicious! We served with mexican rice and beans.

I only used the verde sauce in this recipe and it turned out better than I could have ever hoped for!! I made a slight change in the recipe and did not  boil the peppers. I roasted and peeled the skin off my peppers instead. So good!!!

The chicken filling was a little plain and needed something extra despite the fact that I added cumin and the salsa verde mixture. However, the salsa verde was amazing! I didn't add any chicken stock as it was already thin enough and I only added one serrano pepper since they have a lot of heat.

Resist the temptation to Americanize this dish by smothering it in cheese because you will miss out on a wonderful experience.  Excellent recipe, but be forewarned you'll never want to eat American Enchiladas again!

This was pretty good, although my sauce tasted a little bitter.  To compensate, we ended up adding some New Mexico green chili.  I still felt like it was missing something but it was good.  Next time, I would use green chilis instead of the serranos because of the flavor difference.

Wow - so delicious! As with most authentic Mexican dishes, the preparation is a little bit time consuming but well-worth the effort. As another reviewer suggested, I would recommend doubling the verde sauce. Even if you have leftovers after the enchiladas are done, the sauce goes great cold as a dip for chips. Personally, I preferred stuffing the enchiladas with the cheese, cilantro, and onions as opposed to topping.

My boyfriend is from Mexico City and this is EXACTLY how he taught me to make enchiladas verdes.  This is fantastic and fresh and if you cook the chicken and combine the salsa ahead of time, you can have delicious enchiladas verdes any time!  Also, since I live on a budget, I often purchase canned, green tomatoes to create the salsa verde since the fresh tomatillos are more expensive.  I just combine the salsa ingredients in a blender (careful not to over-blend to avoid breaking seeds as they can be bitter) and then fry the salsa in a little oil.  And yes, like Rosa Marina, I was taught to use caldo con sabor de pollo but i prefer to use sea salt to avoid the MSG.

I was very anxious about trying this recipe, fearing it a bit beyond my culinary skills. However, the enchiladas came out fantastic! My husband gobbled them up before I could blink! Take a chance and try this recipe, you won't be disappointed.

I wasn't sure how these were to be eaten. It didn't matter though, because these were very delicious!! The only problem I found was that the recipe didn't make enough salsa for 3 people. I made the home-made tortillas and it turned out wonderful with this recipe! Definitely will make this again!

My tomatillos never did turn "dull army green" when I boiled them, but no matter... this recipe is very, very good and I will be making these enchiladas again.  Finally, a good use for the tomatillos in our garden.

Very good - made twice the sauce verde and baked the enchiladas with lots of sauce and cheese on top. Undoubtedly, that took away from the authenticity, but we liked it!  Used some Thai peppers and we really liked the flavor they lent.

Let me start by saying this recipe is E-X-C-E-L-L-E-N-T!!! Thank you for sharing it. We made it as directed for the most part, but due to the warnings about the heat we mixed things up a little with the peppers. For those who like a little spice but can't handle the intense burn, try this pepper combination: 2 Serranos, 1 Pablano, and 2 Anaheims - and be sure to de-seed all peppers before boiling. This way, you keep that awesome green chili flavor without all the burn. As a general rule, peppers typically get hotter the smaller they are. Knowing that makes it easier to mix and match a pepper blend that's right for you and yours. But make sure to stick with green varieties for this recipe! Oh, and as others have suggested, doubling the sauce is a must!! We doubled the chicken and trippled the sauce and it turned out to a perfectly delicious 6 servings. Yum, yum, YUM!!!

This is almost an exact duplicate of Rick Bayless' recipe ... only difference is that he adds a little sour cream to chicken to bind it a bit before filling tortillas.  If opting to bake, he recommends only 10 minutes @ 400 (which I, like so many others, shamefully prefer).

AWESOME!! I used to work in an authentic Mexican restaurant and they closed. I am always looking for ways to feed my cravings for their food and this recipe has done it! This is the REAL DEAL! Also, I love making fresh salsa and I will be making salsa verde based off of this recipe quite frequently from here on out. 2 thumbs way up!

The salsa verde is excellent!! (and so very easy to prepare). I boiled all 5 peppers but added only three to check on the heat and it was just perfect for me. My only issue was with the chicken. It wasn't very flavorful as is. Consider adding some cumin or other seasonings as you please. Otherwise, it will rely A LOT on whatever else you are serving the enchiladas with. I served them with pico de gallo, diced avocado, and sour cream on top. Very yummy.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I doubled the sauce recipe as others recommended and came out with just enough to mix with the chicken and then pour on top and in the bottom of the pa.  I baked at 375 for 20 minutes.  I used 10 serrano peppers (as I doubled the sauce) but only left 2 uncleaned/deseeded.  There was some spice to it but nothing overwhelming.  Next I will throw a few more whole ones in to bump up the spice.

the salsa is AWESOME.  I had never cooked corn tortilla enchiladas before so the whole dipping in oil thing got me at first.  Once I got the hang of it, it was super easy.  I'm doing the sauce again today because now I'm craving it to go with some carnitas I have cooking.  Great sauce!!!

This is good.  I would recommend doubling the verde sauce as it is a little dry.  I was a little disappointed that the queso fresco did not melt at all. I will probably try a different cheese or prepare a little different next time.

I haven't had Enchilada Verde ever before so that is why it's getting 4 stars. I had to use canned whole tomatillos and jalapeno peppers instead of the fresh tomatillos and serrano peppers. I even had to substitute the queso fresco with a light feta. Despite the substitutions everyone enjoyed the enchiladas and I would say they were a hit. No one noticed it was light Feta on top. You just have to like spicy food to like this one. If I make this again I may take the advice of another review where they added the peppers gradually into the blender - I just went ahead and put 5 peppers into it. Can't wait to try this one again if I find fresh tomatillos at the market one day, I'm sure it will taste even better.

These taste just like the ones my Mexican friends make.  The verde sauce is very flavorful.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Delicious as is.  Next time I may mix the cooked chicken, onions and cilantro together and use that mixture to make the individual enchiladas, to save on time.  Will make this again and again.

Outstanding recipe.  One of the best on the site.  My boyfriend said that this was his new favourite dish.  I've never cooked with tomatillos or serrano peppers.  I trekked half way across the city to go to a mexican grocery store to keep this dish authentic.  I followed the directions to a T, except I didn't add the extra salt to the broth (and I didn't notice it lacking).  As for the serrano peppers, I started with 1 and took out the seeds.  I  like heat, but I almost died when I tasted it right out of the blender.  I cooked it for about half an hour and it mellowed out.  It was the kind of heat that was quite hot, but the spice tasted great.   I can't imagine 5 full peppers, but next time I could probably handle 2 after a long simmer.  I'd rate this dish more than 5 stars if I could.  I will 100% be making this again and again.

This was outstanding.  I have really never had authentic Mexican but if this is any indication...YUMMMMMMM!!!  My son just came back after studying in Monterrey and he said that the food was fantastic so..I decided to find some great recipes to make for him. He is back at school now but I WILL be making these for him when he comes hom on spring break..Hopefully he approves.  I did change a few things as did some of the others..I only used 3 peppers ( I seeded them..) I wish I would have used more.  I may leave the seeds in next time.  I did not add any salt as I feel the chicken broth was enough salt.  They were seasond perfectly!!  I did not fry the tortillas in the oil instead I just warmed in a fry pan and then rolled the meat with sauteed onion, cheese, about 2 tbsp verde sauce.  (I had previously sauteed the shredded chicken with 1/2 sliced onion and some of the leftover chicken broth just to give a little more flavor to the meat) I then put all of the enchiladas in a 9X13 pan and covered them with the remining sauce and then covered them with some Quesedilla cheese.  I mixed up a salsa made with 2  diced tomatoes, cilantro, diced oinion, and a  little lime juice.  I served that as a topping along with sour cream.  OUTSTANDING FLAVORS!!!!!!!!!!!  I also made the refried beans without the refry and I can't tell you how much we enjoyed this meal.

My husband's favorite food is chicken enchiladas. I used this recipe to make enchiladas. Turned out great! This is his new favorite. I am going to eat them for lunch in a few. I used 3 sarrano peppers in a DOUBLED batch of salsa. Next time I will remove the seeds because my husband doesn't like things overly spicy and I think this was just a bit. AWESOME RECIPE! Thank you so much.

I live on the border of Mexico and Texas and these enchiladas are the BEST I have ever eaten, even my local friends with family in Mexico think they are the best they have ever had.  This recipe is a winner .. we eat it once a week.

used shrimp instead of chicken, and vegetable broth. added onions, shredded mexican cheese, and tomatoes to inside of enchilada. topped with shredded cheese also, then baked for 25 min on 375. STRAIN the tomatillos/serrano mixture after blending! it removes the solids from the sauce and makes it smooth. topped with onion rings instead of chopped, cilantro, queso fresco, and extra green sauce. didnt fry tortillas and used flour instead of corn.

edit: i have made these a few times now since my boyfriend is in love with them. its perfect to make for a group coz you can leave things out depending on taste without any inconvenience. with the shrimp i also added a little imitation crab, it makes a really nice flavor. i also got brave and added another pepper, the sauce is spicy on its own but on the enchiladas it isnt too much at all. dont forget the cilantro!

Everybody raved about this on Cinco De Mayo. I cheated and used Herdez Salsa Verdes (3 cans), and doctored it up with garlic powder, chopped jalapenos, and chicken bouillon (to make it more like the recipe's salsa). Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T. Tasted great, and just the right amount of heat. Thanks so much, I'll be making these again (when I have time of course, b/c these were so time consuming!!)!

Very good!  Labor-intensive, but well worth it.  I followed the recipe as is up until the end.  I rolled up the enchiladas and placed them in a 13x9 dish.  Topped with some more of the sauce, and some shredded Monterey Jack Cheese, covered with foil and baked 30 minutes.  Then topped with the fresh sliced onion and chopped cilantro after they were plated up.  Yummy!

We absolutely loved this recipe! The verde sauce is a winner! After reading the reviews, I decided to only go with 2 peppers, which was more than plenty for us. We like mild-medium spiciness and it was just right. Also, after boiling my chicken for 20 minutes, I didn't have much broth leftover to puree so I had to add a little bit extra canned chicken stock, but it turned out terrific still. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

The tomatillo salsa was so good, and much simpler than I thought it was going to be to make. I wasn't too keen on the chicken, it was a bit bland to me. I might make this again if we have company.

I used Salsa Verde in a can. I found it in the international section of the grocery store. It is already blended with every ingredient except the chicken broth. I highly recommend this because it is very simple to do and it is a great crowd pleaser.

These are really good, my family loves them. I made a few changes. I omitted the salt, (figured you get enough from the broth, I use canned or bouillon). I used only one anaheim chili and one jalapeno, they were homegrown, and I wasn't sure about the heat they'd have,
(plus my kids don't care for really spicy food). I used homegrown tomatillos, and I did not fry the tortillas in oil, to lower the calories and fat. I did dip them in the hot salsa, then rolled them up and put in a dish, sprinkled some grated Chihuahua cheese (mild white mexican melting cheese)instead of the queso fresco, over the top and put in the oven till cheese melted. The only thing that bothered me was that I expected the salsa to be green, like my homemade green salsa, but the canned broth turned it brown. Maybe if you use homemade chicken broth it is not as brown. But the flavor was outstanding and my family did not care about the brown color. Very delicious!

Wow, my family loves it .  The  adjustment s I made was add some salt to the sauce and double the sauce.  I also didn't add any chicken stock to the sauce because I like mine thicker. I also sprinkle chopped scallion on top with cheddar cheese. Served with mexican rice and sour cream.  The best...

i wish the chicken had more flavor.  use less chicken broth in the step with the blender making the tomatillo sauce.  mine was too watery.  i recommend adding a little at a time.  i put sour cream on top and it was better.  i thought the queso fresco had a strange flavor.

Made this last night and it was a hit.  I used a bottled green salsa because I had it on hand and it worked great.   Rolled them up and put in a casserole pan covered in sauce and cheese and broiled until cheese melted.  Will be making this one again.  Served with a side of refried beans, some salsa, sour cream and salad. Great!

The sauce was ridiculously good, but made waaaay too much for the enchiladas. The chicken was a little dry. Next time I will add a little cheese in with the chicken, put the stacked enchiladas in individual casserole dishes, dump a bunch of cheese on top, and stick it in the oven for a few minutes. I can't say enough about the sauce though, spicy, sweet, delicious, and worth the couple extra minutes it takes to make.

A lot of people have mentioned one of the 2 comments I have about this recipe - that it is HOT!! and I only used 3 peppers! - but no one else seems to have had such a hard time with them!  I think it's probably because I had very little space to work with in our old apartment, where I lived when I tried this.  Anyway, I thought it was a pretty labor-intensive recipe, but well worth it.  I may have fried my tortillas too long because they didn't totally soften in the green sauce, and I had a hard time rolling them.  This only affected the presentation though, the taste was still fabulous.  Mexican lovers, do try!

Very good.  I couldn't find queso fresco so I used Jack.  Three peppers (with seeds) was perfect for me.

Very good recipe. A lot of dishes to clean up, but well worth it. Only thing that wasn't clear is how much of the reserved broth to use...it said to cover the tomatillos in the blender by 1", but the liquid I had left after boiling the chicken didn't cover the tomatillos so I used all of the reserve broth. It was really good, but I didn't know if I had the proper consistency or not. Other than that it was excellent.

This dish is very tasty. My family loved it and wanted more. The fresh green salsa has great flavor and caries a little kick.  Tasting it stratght I thought it would be too hot, but when added to the enchalidas it was just right. There was plenty left over that we're using in other dishes.  This will be a regular menu item at my house.

I don't like a lot of Mexican, but this was delicious! I halved the recipe and used 1 serrano pepper. The sauce was pretty hot and I can't imagine it with 5! I also did NOT dip the tortillas into the green sauce. Frying them in vegetable oil, however, makes them taste like they're fresh-baked. I may add tomotoes next time, since I didn't use the chopped onions.

I've made this dish three times and I love it. Recently I prepared the enchiladas for 20 people and they were a big hit. The only thing I did differently this last time is that I skipped frying the tortillas.

I found this recipe and became a member only to comment how absurdly terrible it is. First off, these aren't enchiladas, they're tostadas. Secondly, this was the MOST bland, boring, high-maintenance mistake I've ever made in my life.

I honestly can't recall anything this terrible. UN-believable.

I made this dish this evening for dinner and I really liked it. Unfortunatly, I went to 4 different markets and no one had the green tomatoes, or the right cheese, so I had to substitute the salsa verde for store bought and I used Mexican dipping cheese mixed and heated with sour cream. My husband and I loved it but the kids were scared of the 'green'......their loss.
Thanks for the recipe!

These tasted very similar to some enchiladas that a family in Mexico City made for me.  Very Good!  I also doubled the salsa and had enough left over for chips and salsa. Yumm!

These are the best enchiladas! I make them all the time. This recipe is wonderful as is, but sometimes instead of the chicken filling, I make an avocado filling to make it a little different. It's wonderful with this sauce.

these are really REALLY good!  My boyfriend took some leftovers into work.  the guys there tried them and their only complaint was that there wasn't enough of them!  I made another pan for him to bring in and share!  I baked mine for 30 minutes at 350 degrees to melt the cheese and blend flavors.  At first I was worried that they were too spicy...but they weren't at all.  My kids hate spicy-hot food and they LOVED these!  Easy to make, too.

Wow, I've been looking for a green chile sauce, and this is the best.  You can find the tomatillos and queso fresco cheese at WalMart.  This is very spicy with 5 serranos.  Substituting a couple of jalapenos reduces some of the heat.!   Delicious!

This is the first time that I made my own enchilada sauce and everyone loved it!  It was a little bit hotter than I was expecting, which my husband and father in law loved, otherwise, be sure to put some sour cream on it!  It was very flavorfull.

Made this tonight after wanting a more authentic recipe for my leftover roast chicken.  The authenticity of the prep and ingredients attracted me.  I doubled the sauce with 6 serranos and will enjoy freezing the leftovers for future use.  This made a pretty spicy sauce.  Next time I will probably double the sauce and use 3 serranos.  As a previous reviewer stated, if you have the choice, go with the tiny tomatillos for the best flavor.  I didn't strain the sauce as another recommended as I was preparing this for a weeknight meal and time was of the essence .  My regular ole eating blender made quick work of purifying the sauce to an acceptable consistency.  I omitted the salt because I used prepared chicken stock and cities cheese .

The salsa verde is amazing. For an easy cheat on the chicken, I used the breast meat from a readymade garlic-lime rotisserie chicken and some low-sodium chicken broth.

just as a side note: dipping corn tortillas (not flour) for enchiladas is to help them keep shape, as they will crumble when trying to roll them up. it isn't needed when using flour tortillas and will save you the mess if you avoid that step. good recipe but, is even better if you roast all the veggies (and garlic, if you don't like it raw)

This was great! My husband loved it and the heat was perfect for him, but a little too much for me. We will definitely be making this again.

Loved this recipe.  It was a bit time consuming but well worth it.  The only change we made was decreasing the serrano peppers to 2 and adding 1 green pepper.  We had a little extra sauce leftover to freeze. So good!

I was surprised it was so tasty!  I normally won't fry anything in oil. Beautiful presentation.  Might as well make extra sauce, and if you don't use it, freeze it.

Fabuloso! Tangy hot salsa, really tender chicken- and you can buy queso fresco at walmart, which is awesome. I recommend doubling salsa- I have made this at least ten times and it is always a hit. People want the salsa for chips, and I usually have barely enough for the enchiladas. Recommend removing seeds from the serranos if your friends or family doesn't love spicy foods :) - delicious either way.

Wow...so delicious! I found it easier to spoon and swirl the verde onto the fried tortilla, but otherwise I followed everything to a T. The raw onions, cilantro and queso fresco are a perfect topping.

Wow! This was good! I used a rotisserie chicken instead of cooking my own and did not cook the tortillas in oil before dipping them in the sauce since I didn't want the extra calories. Since the recipe didn't say to remove the seeds and ribs from the peppers I cooked them whole but only ended up using one in the sauce and it was plenty hot. My lips were burning! So good. I can't wait to make them again for my oldest son! This recipe is a keeper!

AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING. Made double batch= 9x13, 9x9,& pie dish, each a slightly dif variation. Used the full amt peppers- 7 serranos, 1 red chili and 2 jalaps. Used small tomatillos (max golfballish) as suggested to avoid bitterness. Bought fresco cheese even though $8/10 oz*. Added 1c chopped onion, a little sour cream (1/3 c*) and a little mexican cheese blend (1/2 c*) to the shredded chicken. The first 9x13 dish I forgot to dip the tortillas in the verde sauce after frying them. Poured sauce over top and sprinkled fresco cheese on top. The second dish 9x9 we fryed and dipped, poured sauce over and sprinkled fresco & mexi blend. The third dish I just dipped in the sauce; poured sauce over & sprinkled fresco + generous mexi blend. If not fried, the tortillas break when you try to roll them up. All three dishes were popped in the oven at 375 until cheese melted and slightly browned and sauce bubbly- maybe about 15 min. Results of three variations: Tortillas best is fried and dipped in sauce (original directions); little dry if not fired and slightly less spicy if not dipped. Fresco cheese tastes a lot like mozzarella but doesnt melt as well. Mexi blend cheese on top was fantastic - melted, browned, and tasted best. Will sub shredded moz for Fresco next time- tastes similar, melts better. (if not baking used fresco b/c crumbles nice). I rec using a red chili in sauce just b/c looks great. Use full amt of peppers if u like good spicy; more if u like tears/puffing spicy.

I give the recipe 4 stars as written. I found the tomatillo sauce a little bland for our taste so I amped it up with 6 cloves of garlic, a diced and seeded jalapeno, and two big roasted green chiles.  I used Pam to soften my corn tortillas and then I rolled them with chicken, green sauce, and cheese inside.  I stacked them in a 9x13 and made about 30 enchiladas (two layers). After the first layer I ladled some green sauce over the enchiladas, then more ladled over the top of the second layer.  I covered with foil and baked in a 375 oven for about 30 minutes and TURNED THE OVEN OFF.  I removed the foil and covered the enchiladas with a layer of shredded cheese and popped them back in the oven for another 10 minutes to melt the cheese.  Holy cow, these are SO YUMMY!!  I give the enchiladas I made TEN STARS!!

This recipe was GREAT!!!!!! The only thing I would do different is use more broth to make more of the sauce. If you want to feed a large group add more to the ingredients. Awesome Dish!!!!!

A fantastic recipe!  It was easy, and everyone ate until it hurt.  I took a few shortcuts like using a rotisserie chicken and mild Jalapeno peppers that I had on hand.  I also used fresh tortillas from the refrigerated deli case which stayed very moist during pan-frying and didn't need to be boiled in the sauce to soften.  Amazing, thanks!

Absolutely the best Enchiladas Verdes I have ever eaten.  I love them even more than those had at my favorite restaurant.  I made the dish exactly as is, with the exception that I left out the cilantro.  I did not feel the extra strong flavor of the herb would be needed, and I believe that was correct in my case.  The chicken was wonderfully moist and seasoned just right, and the fresh tomatillo salsa is to die for.  I would advice being very conservative when adding the chicken broth to the blender when making the salsa.  Start with a little and add more to get the proper amount of liquidity.  Too runny is no good.  I served them with a dollop of sour cream on the side.  These enchiladas are some work to prepare, but well worth it.  Easily a five star recipe.

Wow. We absolutely LOVED this!!! The sauce is incredible, as stated by many people! I did seed the peppers before using them, so it wasn't quite so hot... still had spice, though! Next time, I'm making a quadruple batch of the sauce and smothering these babies in it... I did cover it with cheese, onions and cilantro, then baked it. Other than that, I didn't really change anything. I used homemade corn tortillas. Yum, this is definitely being made again!!!

These were absolutely FANTASTIC, and even better the next day as leftovers. We did a batch and a half of the sauce and only used 3 peppers in the batch, but probably could've done one more. It was pleasantly spicy but not overwhelming. We also dipped, rolled, and baked and sauteed some onions for inside, as that's how we're used to loving enchiladas. The sauce is wonderful!

Excellent... a definite keeper...I used half the serrano's and not enough kick..mine were small. There was not enough sauce (I would double it) and the cheese did not melt.  I think I would have to think about nuking them in the micro before adding the sauce.  I too would add a little sour cream to the meat to bind it and a few sliced olives on the top with sour cream and the cilantro.  Will definitely make it again and the family loved the sauce but it needed salt as I used low salt chicken broth.  We fed 5 of us and had chicken left over but not enough sauce to continue making them.

This is a really good recipe! I followed the directions precisely but the sauce seemed a bit too thin so I added more tomatillos. Great flavor in the sauce. My only complaint is the chicken had that standard boiled taste to it, I used 4 boneless/skinless breasts. Next time I will put the chicken and other ingredients in my crockpot and then mix in some of the sauce before I roll the tortillas. This should get rid of that flavor I dislike. Other than that, this is a great recipe

This is my family's favorite dinner. We always double the sauce and make several times the chicken. We then freeze the chicken to use in our next batch. I more than double the garlic just because we LOVE garlic and due to the fact that I have 3 kids we only use 2-3 serranos in the sauce. DELICIOUS!!!!!! Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

Wonderful...I had to go to two supermarkets (one mexican one), to get all the ingredients, but it was worth it.  I made as is, but used only 3 peppers per other reviews.  I think next time I will double the sauce and maybe leave seeds in at least on pepper for a little heat.  We put the enchiladas together, poured most of the sauce over them, topped with cheese and popped them in the oven for about 15 minutes.  They were yummy!  Thanks I'll make these again.

Awesome!  So fresh tasting, and so much flavor! I followed the advice of other reviewers and baked the shells instead of frying them.  I used only 3 serrano peppers and removed most of the seeds.  Perfect amount of spice for us.  I used a rotisserie chicken to save time and it was delicious.

Oh boy, this is good!  I used all the serrano's called for, but only put three through the blender and that was for a double batch of sauce.  I'm glad so many people suggested doubling the sauce, it wouldn't have been enough otherwise.  Even with only three peppers it was almost too hot for us.  The queso fresco helps to tame the heat.  That and a little sour cream made these delicious! Okay, I am editing my rating...The above rating was taste testing only.  The real dinner was FABULOUSO!!!  Used "Best Black Beans" by Cameron and "Mexican Rice II" by  Mommyto2 on this site.  Served with fresh guacamole....Yummy!

I made these for cinco de mayo and have to say that although they were different from the non-traditional baked white sauce enchiladas that I was used to, they were delicious. And i loved the unique tangy taste of the tomatillos. When choosing tomatillos try to choose smaller, bright green firm ones.I used flour tortillas (did not have any corn ones at Superstore!) and heated them in a pan without oil. I then dipped the inside into the salsa verde. Then i filled them with a chicken, sour cream and mozza mixture (couldn't find the right cheese). I boiled a whole chicken, and it filled up 8 larger tortillas. I added sauce to the bottom of a 9x13 and 8x8 pan and put the enchiladas in and covered with the rest of the sauce and mozza cheese. Baked for 15-20 mins on 400. It was great, but think it would be better with corn tortillas, and more sauce ( I had just over a pound of tomatillos and it still wasn't enough).Also for the sauce I didnt use very much broth at all because the tomatillos were very juicy on their own, and only used 2 peppers. Spicy but not inedible. Yum!!!! With some more practice I think these will be above + beyond a 5 star recipe. A real keeper.

Totally yummy!  I substituted poblano chiles for the serrano.  Ya' gotta' use what's available!  Blistering chiles is just something that I am used to doing, so I did make that change. Otherwise I made them according to the recipe.  Seasonings are pretty personal so I added some Adobo seasoning to the chicken.  This recipe goes into the winner's circle for sure.

So much better than restaurant enchiladas! I added some fresh lime juice to the shredded chicken and finished it in a pan with some vegetable oil to make the taste a bit more rich. I also agree with the other reviews - you can cut down on the peppers by 1/2 and it'll still have a lot of kick. We made this twice in a row (once for a party, and the next night at home) because it was so good!

This was great! Everything smelled wonderful while cooking and I could not wait to try it when they were finally done! This was my first dish using serrano peppers, and I really like them. They are not hot, just leave a nice flavor and a little tingle on your lips and tongue. I will be making this again!

12/29, I reheated the leftover chicken and sauce and put it over potato perogies - it was a little hotter taste but fantastic :)

These were the best enchiladas ever.  Even my picky husband scarfed them up. I didn't soak the tortillas because after coating with the oil they were very flimsy and tore easily. I stuffed them with the chicken, sauce and cheese, lined them in a baking pan and poured the remaining sauce over the top with the rest of the cheese. I baked them for 20 mins at 375 and they were perfect. Served them with sour cream shaved onion and refried beans with jalepenos.  Will definitely make again and loved the authentic taste.  These were better than most restaurants.

Fresh and delicious!  Next time I will break up the tortillas into bite sized pieces after frying in oil and before dipping in the green salsa.  Makes eating a little easier.  Other than that, a wonderfully fresh meal!  Will definitely make again :)

absolutely amazing!!  Double up on the sauce.  oh, and one trick i had was to take the reserved broth and put it in a rice cooker with the onion and garlic still in it.  add rice and cook - then discard the onion and garlic after the rice is done.....awesome!  my favorite recipe so far!

What a refreshing change to the enchilada swimming in red sauce, which is all I knew how to do! Just a few changes due to time and what I had in the kitchen. Three boneless, skinless chicken breasts cooked for about 10 minutes-1 sauteed onion went into the shredded chicken-roasted 3 jalapenos under the broiler instead of boiling with the tomatillos-blended sauce really well then strained into a saucepan to warm through. I put some of the sauce on the bottom of a 9X13 pan. I spread some sour cream on a tortilla, placed shredded chicken and sauteed onion mixture down the center, topped with colby-jack cheese and a sprinkle of cilantro, rolled the tortilla up and put in the dish. Filled the casserole dish with 6 enchiladas, topped with all of the remaining sauce, more cheese and a sprinkling of chili powder over the top for a bit of color. Baked uncovered at 375 degrees for about 20-25 minutes. When out of the oven, topped with a bit more cilantro for taste. Served with extra sour cream and bottled salsa on the side (no one used the extra salsa). This one has been added to my recipe collection. Thank you for sharing, Patti! It's a keeper.

I LOVE this recipe!!! Its a hit every time! I usually cut back on the serrano's by at least 1/2, otherwise its too spicy for me to enjoy. I reserve the chicken broth for my rice. B/C the peppers and tomatillos produce enough liquid once processed. Plus I also throw the onion and garlic that was cooked w/ the chicken into the processor as well. No sense wasting it, besides my husband and I can never get enough onion and garlic in our meals! Anyway, this recipe always brings me back to my wonderful experiences and the fabulous tastes of Mexico. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious.  I didn't have enough chicken broth so the salsa verde was a little runny because I added water, but otherwise one of the best enchiladas I've ever had.

My small change was adding some lemon to the chicken.  Next time I'm going to add some crushed potato chips and see how that works out.

This was really yummy but also really HOT. I thought cutting out one pepper would be enough, but I wish I had used only 2. Will definitely make again! (I also agree that it's a bit time consuming, but worth it.)

These are to die for.  Very easy and so pretty.  This is def. something I would be proud to cook for guests. I made it veg. by skipping the first steps and using vegetable broth and using morningstar griller cooked in the George Forman grill cut into strips.  I have actually made this twice now and will make again in the future!

Absolutely worth the time it takes to make! I have made this three times now. It's one of my favorite things to eat. Guests say they feel like they have gone to a wonderful mexican restaurant. YUM!

These are quite hot, but incredibly delicious!  HUGE hit at a Mexican-themed potluck dinner for 10 I brought it to.  It did take much longer than the recipe indicated it would, even accounting for the fact that I tripled the recipe.  I will definitely be making them again (but sometime when I'm not in a hurry)!

I would give it a 10 if I could! I have made this several times now and it is SSSOOOOOO good!  The one and only thing I do differently is I don't put in the broth until it covers the veggies by an inch.  I put it in one inch below the top otherwise it is too runny for my taste. I have also used boneless, skinless breasts and it's good with them too. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Oh my God!  I would give this 10 stars if I could.  I kept true to the recipe except for number of peppers and the preparation.  I only used 1 large serano instead of the 5.  I couldn't imagine using 5 peppers.  I love spicy food, but wow that would have been way too hot.  I made the chicken and sauce ahead of time.  So, when it came to warming and serving, I put my shredded chicken with the chopped onions in a pan with enough sauce to just coat the chicken then heated through.  I used flour tortillas but did not fry them, just warmed them in a pan making them just slightly crispy but still soft enough to roll.  I rolled the chicken mixture, the cheese and a little cilantro in each tortilla, placed them in a dish and covered with the rest of the sauce, sprinkled with cheese and heated in a 375 degree oven for about 15 minutes.  Then served with a dallop of sour cream and sprinkled with cilantro.  I served with black beans and I mean it was one of the best enchiladas I've ever had.  I want to try this next time with pork to mimic my favorite Mexican restaurant.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I found queso fresco at a Mexican grocery store.  Couldn't find it in a regular grocery store.

These are so delicious, and very easy.  I loved the heat, but I'm thinking if I make this for company I'll use fewer serranos.  Luckily, I'm in Texas and Queso Fresco abounds at my favorite grocer. Take note, if you use a food processor to make the salsa, you won't need to cover the tomatillo's with as much broth.

One word - AWESOME. I've been living in Texas for two years but have been too afraid to even try green enchiladas, but for some reason this recipe just struck me as sounding delicious so I made it myself. They are incredible! The only change I would make next time is to add the broth to the salsa a little at a time to make sure it doesn't get too runny. It was hot, spicy, and the queso fresco was the perfect touch.

My husband, who is Mexican, couldn't get enough of these enchiladas. They were amazing even though they were a little hot for my taste. I think 2 peppers would make a great mild salsa for the enchiladas.

These were pretty good.  I wound up using fresh green chilis as I could not find serano chilis.  It was not spicy at all, which is fine since I have kids.  This is a very easy recipe & the sauce tastes so fresh.  I will definitely make these again.

Wonderful tasting sauce! The one thing I did different was thicken the sauce up with some fried flour.  Was a little to thin for my taste.  I also roll the enchiladas and bake them at 350.

I made a vegetarian version of these enchiladas verdes, and they were the best I've ever had!  We filled them with  chihuahua cheese in place of the chicken and used vegetable stock rather than chicken broth.  I can't wait to make them again, because they're simply out of this world.

I used an entire chicken instead of just two breasts since other users said there was such an excess of sauce. I also added sour cream, tomatoes, and green chiles to the chicken before putting it in the tortilla. I baked it for about 20 minutes at 350 to keep it hot. I did not fry the tortillas in the oil, but still soaked them in the sauce before adding the chicken to make it a little healthier. It was great and my kids liked it, so it will become a staple recipe in this house!

This meal had good ingredients, although it impossible to eat as per the directions! You can't eat it, it falls apart, the chicken gets cold, therefore the cheses doesn't melt.... This wasn't a good experience.

Some family members thought it was a little too spicy and some thought it was perfect. I myself LOVED IT! I had a HAPPY BELLY! I would suggest if spicy is not your thing then reduce the serranos to 3.

i couldn't bring myself to fry the tortillas first since we are on a diet, but it was still incredible. the queso fresco really made it taste different than anything you can get at most restaurants.

My husband and I couldn't agree on whether to give this 4 or 5 stars... He said 4, so that is what I'll give. This was really good! I did switch some things up... I used sliced up jalapenos that I had in the fridge, just because I wanted to use them up. Once it was blended, it was all the same! The sauce was so good, I am kind of sad I don't have more extra! The only thing I would do different it melt cheese over the top. YUM!!

I'm hoping it's easier to make the second time.  I got a bit mixed up the first time.  I want to make this again ASAP though!  LOVED it.

This was very good.  My chicken was a little dry so I will make adjustments for that in the future.  I also added extra garlic to the green sauce because I like garlic.  Wouldn't recommend that.  It was very overpowering.  Pretty good stuff though.

I gotta say... EXCELLENT sauce!  Loved the enchiladas, although next time I may use Monterrey Jack cheese instead to have the cheese melt more.  I also baked after rolling them up.  Overall my husband and I enjoyed it and I will DEFINITELY be making it again!  Thanks for a great, authentic recipe!

This recipe turned out great! I used less serranos because we don't like our food too hot. But over all, it was fantastic. I used sliced green onions instead of regular white onions. I will definitely make this again. I had enough of everything leftover to make it into a Verde Enchilada Caserole for the following night. I highly recommend this recipe for anyone who loves Mexican food.

This is one of our favorite recipes on Allrecipes.  My wife loves this and asks for it frequently.  The sauce is what makes this dish and the leftover sauce gets put on EVERYTHING.  It is absolutely fantastic on scrambled eggs or in breakfast buritto.

This is a really delicious recipe, but be aware that the heat of both serrano and jalapeno chiles varies WIDELY .  I just finished preparing this dish for later this evening, and I wish I had listened to my insticts and not dumped all five serranos in the blender.  I love very hot food, but I think this will be too hot for my family.

This Enchiladas Are Authentic.  Most restaurants have made them different and ppl expect those to be the real ones... but they are not.   This enchiladas are so tasty I make them to many times a week.  Anyone can make them taste so good without being a great cook.

Wonderful.  Fantastic.  Can't get enough.  I've made these twice now and will make again soon.  It's too spicy for my children (ages 5 and 2) so we serve it without the green sauce for them.  But I must say, the green sauce is amazing.  We are growing our own tomatillos this year specifically for this recipe!

I loved this! The green salsa had just the right amount of spice, and surprisingly I had no trouble finding fresh tomatillos and serrano peppers in my small town grocery store. Will make the salsa again to use on other things!

Great recipe for easy "authentic" Mexican flavor.  Salsa is great for many other things - I made a big batch and kept it on hand for fish and mixing with veggies for a side dish later that week.

Great recipe, but was a little hot with the recommended number of serrano peppers.  I am a "chili head", and didn't have a problem, but my wife thought it was extremely hot!!!

My husband loves this recipe.  It's very similar to a dish he loves at a popular Mexican restaurant in our city, but it costs a fraction of the price to make it at home! I doubled the salsa, as some others had suggested, and we just had way too much. I decided to freeze some for next time.  My salsa also was very hot, and I don't know if it's because I didn't remove the seeds from the peppers or not.  The recipe does not say to remove the seeds, but I usually do when making regular tomato salsa.  Not sure why mine was so-o-o hot...maybe someone can address that in the future.  Overall, it's a wonderful recipe, and I know I will make it again!

They were okay. I left out the pepper since I'm very sensitive to hot spices. It definatly needed to be eaten with lettuce and tomatos and salsa to make it good. I'll make it occasionally

Excellent, just like Patti says, these are just like Mexican restaurant enchiladas... The family loved them. I used only one Serano Chile as I do not like things too hot. This is now a family favorite. Many thanks for sharing Patti. My quest for the perfect enchilada recipe is now over.

Love these enchiladas!!! I substituted monterrey jack for queso fresco, and poblano peppers in place of the serrano peppers. The first time we did them with jalapenos and they were WAY too spicy, so I improvised by adding sour cream to the salsa verde. YUM!!

I loved this recipe!  I marinated the pork in the lime juice all day. It gave the meat such great flavor.  It was such an easy to follow recipe, and my boyfriend loved it.  I will make this again soon...perhaps for some friends.

I love these enchiladas!  But to save time...I use the Las Palmas GREEN Enchilada Sauce instead of the tomato.
I use the same sauce in all my enchilada recipes...I have a recipe of Cottage cheese, sour cream and cheddar cheese and Onions and the sauce...Great!

Look no further for an easy and absolutely delicious recipe for chicken enchiladas!  I made these tonight and used only three serrano chiles, seeds and all, and also added the cilantro to the blender. I left a little of the broth on the shredded chicken so it would not get dry.  I actually made a silly mistake and fried and then dipped the tortillas in the sauce and THEN put the tortillas in between the paper towels, and they still rolled perfectly without breaking and I didn't burn my fingers. I also added no sauce to the chicken and only put the sauce, a fairly generous amount, on top of the rolled/filled tortillas. Use the queso fresco if at all possible. It is worth the cost!  I garnished each plate with a dollop of sour cream (which cools down the "heat" of the chiles) on a slice of tomato on a bed of shredded lettuce.  I also added a side of refried beans as well, so two enchiladas would probably be enough with these side dishes, although both my husband and I ate three enchiladas and the side dishes and left nothing on our plates!!  Thank you so much for this recipe. Bravo!

These are awesome.  The green sauce is really really good.  I was in Buffalo NY and couldnt get serrano's so I substituted Jalapenos and added a bit extra.  I also rolled them a whole pan at a time and topped with Monterey Jack cheese instead, then served with a little choppped onion and cilantro and sour cream.  Everyone loved them!  Thanks for the recipe, I will definately be using it again and again.

These enchiladas were fantastic!  My only bit of advice would be to add the serrano peppers one by one until the spiciness is to your liking.  I love spicy dishes, but I only used three peppers and it was pretty hot!  My husband and I loved it and I will definitely make it again :)

This was good enough to make again.  Mine turned out too salty - I think the broth is salty enough on it's own.  Next time I make them, I'll roll them up and bake like the enchiladas I'm used to and add cottage cheese with the sauce over the top.  The sauce is a little hotter than medium.

These enchiladas will turn out really well if you follow the instructions as given.  We have a tried & true recipe for cheese enchiladas with red salsa and have never had much luck with adding chicken to those as they just don't taste right to us; we've come to like them with cheese, onion, and nothing else.  These, however, came out delicious with the chicken.  This recipe, I think, will be our go-to for chicken enchiladas from now on.
Take care with the serranos, maybe adding a few at a time.  You never can tell from one batch to the next how much heat they'll have so don't rely on a set count.  You can also roast the tomatillos & peppers if you'd like but it's not necessary; just another option.
Rather than serving directly after rolling them as instructed, we prefer placing them in a baking dish (or two, as needed) and giving them a quick 15 minute turn in the oven.  The main intent is to dry them out a tiny bit and give them a bit more of a bite but this is entirely a preference and they work well either way... my son couldn't wait and ate his fill as we were rolling them so you can't go wrong.  I think baking does make them a bit more suited for preparing ahead of time... then you can heat & serve right from the baking dish.

Pattyverde you are my hero!!! My favorite Mexican dish is green chicken enchiladas. My husband is Mexican and I am not, so I have been trying to find a recipe good enough for him for a decade. I had almost given up when I came across yours. We couldn’t get enough. These were too delicious!! Changes I made: I had to double the recipe and I used 3 Serrano peppers because 5 might have put me in the hospital. Also, I stack my enchiladas because it’s easier. I used the queso fresco with a Mexican blend because we’re cheesy people. So so good!! Thank you!!!!

This recipe is the same my grandma in Mexico uses. TIP: Use small tomatillos because they are less bitter. If your sauce is bitter, add sugar until the bitterness goes away. Simmer your sauce to thicken and don't over blend  sauce or it'll be too watery.

Really good. I used 2 whole chickens and boiled them down instead of the breasts (9 adult mouths to feed).  They were a hit but hard to save leftovers :)

Delicious recipe.  I used 2 large poblano peppers instead of the serrano peppers.  I like the flavor and color of the poblanos in the salsa verde.

Excellent recipe.  I doubled the sauce and had plenty left over for chips and dip.  A little bit of a challenge to get it to the table hot.  Get your tomatillo sauce very hot prior to the last pour over the enchiladas.  Enjoy!!!

I loved this recipe. The only thing I did differently was to put in a dish, top with cheese and bake for a bit. probably a no no.....but so Good! We loved the heat level. Did not last long, as we ate the leftovers quickly because it was so great!

this is very flavorful and pretty easy to make. the difficulty was in cooking it for 25 plus people ahead of time. ended up having to roll the fried tortillas place them in a baking dish and then pour the Verde sauce over top of it when we were ready to serve. probably not as good as dipping it in the hot salsa from the start. but this is the only way we could get them to hold together in order to serve later. I'm looking forward to trying this for two or three people and following the instructions.

I literally just finished making this recipe for dinner. I followed the instruction basically to the tee in hopes of not screwing it up. I have to completely agree with the other reviews, the verde sauce is delicious! the only alterations I made were that I used chicken thighs instead of breast (because I already had thighs thawed and didnt want them to go to waste), and I used only two peppers and the heat was just right for me! A nice kick but not overwhelmingly hot. I didnt get the right sized tortillas (i had the small ones) so I could not wrap them properly- ate them like tacos. However they were so good I didnt care! I threw cooked onions in with the chicken. Next time i will use the bigger tortillas and throw in some green pepper and avocado on top.

These might be authentic in parts of Mexico but IMHO, it missed the spot. I have been cooking since I was very young and in many restaurants near the border. The green sauce was meh....I used two and half Serrano peppers, a handful of cilantro, juice from half of a lime, a couple shakes of salt, and vinegar to give it the missing zing. I also used a whole chicken cooked crockpot style in the 2 cups of broth with onion, garlic, and a stalk of celery. After deboning and shredding, I added garlic salt, a pinch of cumin, and chili powder  as well as some cheese, sourcream, and the salsa verde. I added sauce and cheese to the top before baking. It came out delish!! Good basic recipe but needed more flavor not just the heat from the Serrano peppers.

I made this last night. My husband is Mexican and he loved it. Definitely a keeper recipe. Thank you so much!  Only change I made was 2 lbs of tomatillos to the 5 Serrano chilis and a little cumin in the water for the chicken.   Very yummy dish

Had 2 lbs tomatillos to use up and made this recipe as is. Wish I read this recipe and reviews first before I bought them. I had larger tomatillos, which I think resulted in a bitter tasting sauce (see notes from Rosa Marina’s review). 2 pinches sugar helped a little, but didn’t want to risk making it too sweet. Doubled recipe to have extra sauce and will say only add enough broth until you reach smooth, but not too thin consistency. As written, sauce was far too runny (even for enchilada sauce), but I was able to reduce it down about ½ way—took a while to accomplish. As suspected, didn’t think using chicken broth would add much flavor to the chicken. So, when boiling chicken replace the broth with water, especially if using bone-in, and use that broth in the sauce. My only complaint is the chicken seemed bland. So, maybe add a tiny amount of the sauce to the shredded chicken too. I think everyone knows enchiladas are typically rolled, so here’s a TIP: In lieu of fry, dip, fill, roll…you can dip tortilla in sauce, then fry, fill, roll; or fry tortillas, place a little sauce in bottom of platter (or baking dish), fill tortillas, roll and place seam side down in platter/dish, top with sauce. Latter method is less messy in assembly and you can place in oven @ 350 F for 20 minutes (sauce will be absorbed in tortillas), remove and top with cheese, onion, and cilantro. For us, this was OK, but will try this again with smaller sized tomatillos and see if that makes a difference.

This recipe comes really close to how my Mexican college roommate showed me how to make enchiladas.  I used shredded pork, queso fresco, and sour cream as my filling. I only ended up using 2 serrano peppers because I was afraid it would be too spicy, but I will use more next time. Will definitely make again!

They are very good and very authentic! I added mozzarella cheese at the top too! The only thing is I would not add 5 serrano peppers because I put 3 and it's so spicy. I am Mexican and I like spicy but dang those are hot lol

This had such a great flavor! I followed the directions, estimating the tomatillos as they were from my garden. I used 4 detains, but next time would drop it to 3. To make up for the missing pepper, I used a pepper without heat. The salsa verde alone was fabulous!

This is an absolutely amazing recipe,  however I bake my chicken thighs is a deep glass dish and I use that broth to add to the green salsa. I found (baking the chicken) retains a slightly  firmer texture and the seasonings are more flavorful... in my opinion...thanks for sharing, I've been making this for 3yrs now, my family loves it

Delicious. As good as a nearby authentic Mexican restaurant. I did stir in some fresh lime juice, fresh cilantro and a pinch of sugar into the salsa before I began frying and dipping the tortillas. And taking  another reviewer's advice, I used only one chili. I can't imagine what would've happened if I had used all five. Kaboom?

It made too much for just my hubby and myself but it was tasty and had just the right level of spice and heat. I would definitely make it again in a smaller amount. It was easy to make.

I didn't have serranos, so I used 1 banana pepper and it was just the right spice for my family!  Also, I made it with steak and beef broth instead of chicken.  A great mix of authentic and different at the same time. This recipe is fantastic, I'm going to make it again and again!!  Fortunately, it's great with beef too!

I made this with chicken before I became veg (was fantastic).  I recently made this with rice, beans, mushrooms, peppers with the verde sauce (used veg stock) and it was super tasty too (it's a hit at my house!). Also, don't use 5 serranos if you can't deal with super spice.  I usually use 1 1/2.

This recipe is a staple in my household.  The salsa verde is phenomenal.  It is definitely spicy, but my husband and I really like spicy food, so I use all 5 unseeded serrano peppers.  The only thing I do differently is bake 2 boneless chicken breasts in the oven (350 degrees, covered for 30 mins., uncovered for 15 mins.)  instead of boiling it in the chicken broth/stock.

FAntastic authentic flavors.  My husband loved it!  I added some cheese to the top and popped the whole tray in the oven just until the cheese melted - it was delicious!  I will make the again without a doubt!  In fact, my husband even said "this is a keeper".

Very good! I definitely recommend this recipe. I used queso Oaxaca, not for authenticity but simply because it's my fav. I did bake them off in the oven with extra cheese and sauce because I love the cheesy yumminess!

I have been following this recipe exactly as written for years and it is a family favorite. My husband asks for it on his birthday and Father's Day.  Whenever I make it for other people, they always ask for the recipe.   5 serrano peppers give the perfect spice.  Not too hot, not too mild.   When we do make a change to the recipe, it is to use flour tortillas instead of corn.
 
Once, as a change, I decided to try these baked in a 13x9 dish.  They were ok, but nothing in comparison to following the recipe as written.  I do not recommend baking them.

This was absolutely delicious! I found the chicken to be a bit too salty, though. Next time, I would reduce/eliminate the added 2 tsp. of salt in step #1. 5 stars, without a doubt though! This might have been the best meal that I ever made.

This recipe is my FAVORITE of this whole website - and there are a lot of delicious recipes on here! Also made this for a friend when they had a newborn and they loved it too! This meal has a lot flavor. The salsa verde is delicious and the star of this meal. We always double the salsa and freeze some for later. The salsa is spicy with the Serrano peppers, so we usually reduce it to only one Serrano pepper. Love the tomatillo flavor in the salsa too. The chicken boiled in the garlic, onion, and broth makes it very tasty too. It doesn't taste as good with chicken cooked or boiled differently. We garnish it with shredded cheese and cilantro. From the salsa verde to the chicken to the garnish, all of the flavors compliment each other perfectly. Try this and you'll be hooked!

WoW! These were good! I make enchiladas all the time, but this was my fav recipe. I did my chicken in the crock pot for 4 hours which i believe adds flavor. Grilled my tortillas for a minute per side to leave out any added fat. Loved the verde sauce. Couldn't find cilantro and didn't really need it. Baked at 350 for 15 minutes, dolloped with sour cream and they were great. Will make again.

Less salt, but otherwise brilliant. I didn't find it necessary to double the sauce. We had just what we needed for 16 enchiladas. Also, I went ahead and used two halved chicken breasts (4 halves total) and only had a bit extra meat. It really just depends on the size of the breasts, so eye it up before you cook. 

This was my first time making enchiladas this way, and there is no going back. Who wants a soupy mess from the oven when you can have wonderful, fresh ingredients prepared from scratch exactly to your liking? One question: how to keep the early batches warm while you're making the rest? By the time we sat down to eat, they were already pretty cool.

I am always extremely skeptical when I see the term "authentic" applied to any mexican dish. This recipe isn't claiming to be something it's not. It is the real deal. Thank you so much for sharing!!!!! We love it!

This was super delicious, but dipping the tortillas in the sauce was weird. Kids did not like the sticky wetness when trying to eat their enchiladas. Best salsa verde I've made so far though!

These enchiladas had some heat, but it was just right for people who love heat. I grilled the chicken with a chipotle seasoning and then shredded it. Other than that, I stayed true to the recipe. I can't wait to make it again.

I doubled the sauce and used cotija cheese - the queso fresco I was buying at first was not the correct type.  Since our market is Hispanic and not just Mexican foods, there were different things called queso fresco but the owner suggested cotija and he was right!  Awesome recipe.

This recipe is fabulous! The only thing I did different was I lightly tossed the shredded chicken with Wishbone Southwest Chipotle Dressing just enough to lightly coat. I also doubled the sauce recipe because everyone wanted more! I tried this because of the review by Rosa Marina; she said it was authentic and it is. It was also easy. We loved it!

This recipe is awesome. Exactly what I remember from my days spent in Mexico and like nothing I've been able to find in a restaurant here. Very authentic. Made the tomatillo sauce exactly as written. My only change to the rest was that I shredded a rotisserie chicken instead of boiling chicken, and added the bones from the rotisserie to flavor the broth mixture. Sooooooo good. My hubby and I can't stop talking about it :)

These are the best enchiladas I have made! They are full of flavor and my family loves them. As written, the recipe is too spicy for my kids, so I cut back on the amount of serrano peppers.

These are definitely the best Enchiladas I have ever made! They are as authentic tasting as if you ordered them from a real authentic Mexican restaurant. I took the advise of using less Serrano peppers (I used 3)and the sauce was still extremely spicy. My husband and I love hot, spicy foods but this was too much spice. I added a spoonful (1/8th cup or so?) of sour cream to a small amount of the sauce and it was over the top!!!! I will be eating the leftovers this weekend and it's going on my rotation list most definitely! Go make some of these, they are delish!

I made this for a group of 8 that came over to the house for dinner. Everything about these enchiladas were irresistible! The frying then coating with salsa was a little difficult at first. However, after a few (Delicious) attempts I got the technique down. I even had one guest as for more of the tomatillo salsa. They were looking for heat, so I made certain to chop up the fresh jalapeno that they contributed to the meal and add that to the top of their enchilada. These were a hit! Not even remotely easy to make, but a great way to feed a bunch. I think the next step is to make them when they're here rather than ahead of time.

Fantastic!!  I roasted my tomatillos, serranos, and 1 poblano, sweated them and peeled them.  Doubling the sauce was key to getting the components right.

I took the inauthentic route of baking the whole shebang (with raw white onions, sour cream and cheese) for about 30 mins at 350 degrees.  Wow!!

This was really good. I did follow as directed but I tasted the salsa verde and ending up adding a tsp of cumin. I also added queso blanco inside the enchiladas with the chicken and drizzled crema on top. My family loves cheese enchiladas and chicken enchiladas so I made a combo.

This recipe generated amazing enchiladas.  We eat out at a number of Mexican restaurants that make great Enchiladas verde and this recipe meets, and in some cases, exceeds in taste and texture.  We went with one Seranno chilli and I removed the seeds before boiling to cut down on the heat. (what can I say, i don't do well with the heat)  Next time I will add another couple but still remove the seeds before cooking.  Thank you, other reviewers, for suggesting to double up on the verde sauce ingredients, it makes such a difference to have extra sauce to pour over the dish.  Also, I baked ours for about 15 minutes in a 400 degree oven after having placed the enchiladas in a baking dish and topping it with a Jack and Feta cheese mix.  It is difficult to get the required cheese where I live.  When one puts in all this effort it is a pleasure to get these results.

These were AMAZING.  My only reason for giving it 4 out of 5 stars in heating level.  I recommend cutting the pepper quantity in half, or even more.  They were too spicy for me, and I usually can take the heat.

This recipe is amazing!  About 10 years ago I studied abroad in Cuernavaca and ate enchiladas verdes at a restaurant in Mexico City.  Ever since, I have been looking for a recipe to come close to that wonderful dish.  This is it!  Homemade enchiladas verdes have become a favorite at our house.  I frequently make it when we have friends over for a meal too, and everyone loves it.  The recipe is perfect.  My only suggestion is double or triple the amount of sauce you make because you are going to want more of this tasty Mexican dish again soon & making more to freeze will save you the effort next time. Que rica!

This tasted just like what you'd find in a Mexican restaurant.  I've never worked with tomatillos before and found the sauce wasn't hard to make.  It's all the other steps that makes this labor intensive - but worth it.

My friend's husband is from Jalisco and he taught her that instead of frying the tortillas, she should simply dip them in the verde sauce for a few seconds. it makes it absolutely amazing. plus, you get extra sauce. then you spread a thin layer of sour cream over the top of the rolled enchilada and top with a crumbling.cheese. we also add onions on top sometimes but we prefer to top it with cream, lettuce and then cheese. good work on this recipe though!! :)

The sauce makes this dish, and worth the extra effort (although I only used 2 Serrano peppers, mine were really hot). We topped them with all the taco toppings, lettuce, tomatoes, and black olives.

This was very good and simple. I found this when I was looking for something new enchilada wise, and I was pleasantly surprised. 

This is definitely on my keeper list. I enjoy making it a few times a year.

The green sauce is amazing! I didnt add all the peppers because some family members cant handle too much spice but it was so good anyway. I plan on using this sauce on everything!

These enchiladas were pretty good, but I felt like the sauce lacked in the flavor department.  Honestly I'm not sure it was any better than the Old El Paso canned sauce.  I may try an alteration to this recipe next time to improve the flavor.

Simply the BEST! My husband loved them! I took the advice of the first reviewer...on the salt substitutions and size of tomatillos. I am afraid to order these @restaurants because sometimes they are too bitter....these were not bitter! They were delicious...

This was fantastic!!!  I only had 2 peppers (not sure if they were sorreno or jalapeno), but they were just the right amount for us.  Not too spicey, but just the right amount of kick so that I didn't guzzle my drink to cool off!

i made these for a dinner party.  luckily i made the sauce well in advance because it was so spicy that it was inedible.  i had to go out and buy another pound of tomatillos to calm the sauce down.  with my modifications, the recipe was good.  but i wouldn't put this recipe out there without a serious warning of the spiciness.  and i love spicy food.

Soooo delicious!!! I loved them. The only thing I changed is that I put them in the oven for 15 minutes at 375 degrees and in a 13x9 pan with sauce on the bottom. And then put sauce, cheese, chicken and mexican style cheese [from the bag] in the enchiladas then more of the sauce over the top then more of the cheese over the top. It was sooo delicious. I loved it. :) Great recipe.! My favorite one ive ever tried.

Yum! Will make these again and again!  I used jalepenos and bonless skinless breast (with some stock I had frozen).  I did not fry the tortillas in oil, simply crisped them in a hot non-stick pan. Worked fine and saved calories.

These were very good, but lacked the spice or heat needed to make them great.  That was partly due to my over discretion.  My husband doesn't like overly spicy food, and I scaled the recipe up to 6 servings from 4, but only used 3 serranos.  Next time (and there will be a next time) we will use the full amount of serranos.  Other than that, these were great!  It also gave me the perfect opportunity to visit a supermercado in the area as well as another small market around the corner.

These enchiladas verdes were AMAZING.  I followed the recipe to a T.  These are a bit time consuming and takes some patience but it is WELL worth it.  I really, really recommend this recipe.  Look no further.

The five stars are rated on MY adjustments, which were as follows:  I coated the chicken in a mixture of salt, pepper, cumin and garlic powder and sauteed.  I subbed jalepenos for the serrano peppers.  I subbed jack cheese for the cojita.  I cooked the onions (a whole one) and garlic in with the tomatillos, and blended with an immersion blender right in the pan.  I wrapped the enchilades and covered with the sauce and the baked to blend. So, quite a few changes.  But I have to say these were FANTASTIC.  I will absolutely be making this again, and again, and again...

First let me say these were delicious. However had I used 5 peppers we would not have been able to eat them. I used 1 pepper and that was just the right kick for my family. We all like a little heat and may have been able to tolerate 2 peppers but 5....no way! I followed another review and assembled mine and baked to melt the cheese. They were GREAT!! Thanks.

Very good enchiladas. Next time I will use one less pepper because it was very spicy and I will add a little monterrey jack cheese in with the chicken. Other than that, they were delicious!

This is the best verde recipe I've ever tried. The freshness really comes through when you use whole tomatillos. Sometimes if I'm not feeling like the heat of 5 serranos I'll modify it to 3. If you're serving people who are really adverse to heat you could decrease the number of serranos further. In any case, this is a crowd pleaser.

Excellent!  The only change I would make would be to add a jalapeno to the salsa, but that is only because I like it more spicy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except I also added 2 whole jalapenos to the pot because we like it HOT! My husband was thrilled that I've finally learned how to make at least one authentic Mexican dish. :) Thank you so much for sharing. I will definitely be making this again.

These are terrific!  I made several pans for my husband's 40th birthday party a couple of years ago.  The sauce is wonderful and has just the right amount of heat.  Just be sure you wear gloves when working with jalapenos so you don't burn your hands.  We made a few pans vegetarian by using a rice and veggies in condensed cream of mushroom soup as filling.  Not your everyday eating, but great for company or a special event.

Yum. This sauce is awesome. I only used 3 serranos and the heat was perfect for us. The sauce was super spicy right out of the blender, but after simmering it for a while the heat was somewhat reduced. I also just used a splash of the stock in the sauce, as others claimed the sauce was runny. The only problem is keeping these suckers from falling apart. Any ideas? Granted, all I could find were the small corn tortillas. I really love the queso fresco. Tastes like a mix of fresh mozzarella and feta.

I really enjoyed this dish.  I've made it twice now and am still tweeking it to my personal tastes but I look forward to making it again.  I made extra sauce the first time and used it on my quesadillas too.  This is definitely part of my ongoing repetoire of meals.

Personally, I would rate it a 5. However, my wife wasn't crazy about it. Out of all five of us in my family, three loved it and two just thought it was o.k. But all of us loved the sauce.

I really enjoyed this recipe!! As everyone else has mentioned, the serranos heat things up quite a lot - I used four and tend to like the heat, but it was a bit too powerful for me. I'm going to cut it down to 2-3 next time. The tortillas kind of started crumbling after dipping in the sauce, so if anyone has a trick for that, share it! However, it was a very good recipe, not too labor-intensive, the ingredients are simple, and it tastes good. I like it!

This turned out excellent! The sauce is very authentic. The only changes I made to the sauce was adding a handful of  cilantro and 3 tablespoons of sour cream...Perfect! The sauce alone makes a great green chip dip. Thanks!

This is the best green enchiladas I have had!  I did use chicken base instead of the salt in with the chicken. Used 2 jalapenos with the seeds with the tomatillos, and then in the blender Iadded a handful of cilantro, 1/2 of an onion instead of 1/4, and an avacado (the sauce was a little bland before I added these ingredients, maybe the tomatillos weren't quite ripe, but it was great after).  Then instead of frying the tortillas I just rubbed a little oil on each side and then heated them up until they were crispy.  This is diffently my new green enchilada recipe!

!Muy delicioso! These were fantastic and I will make them again for sure. A TIP about the tomatillos and peppers...add the entire fruit/pepper to the pot.  Just cut off the stems of the pepper. Adding the sour cream was a good tip; it took away some of the hotness. I made it with 5 peppers and my boyfriend says that it tastes like it was cooked in Mexico - leaving your tounge on fire at the end of the meal. Use fewer peppers if hot food is not fo you. Not adding all the reserved chicken broth was a good tip too. The salsa verde came out perfect.

I used @ l.5 lbs of tomatillos & 3 small serranos, added chicken stock just above veggies, the and it was really hot. I lightly fried the tortilla's and coated them w/ sauce.  Meanwhile the chicken cooled down and evenmore so while stuffing them. I put them in the oven w/ cheese to heat everything back up. In the end I forgot to add more sauce on top. For all that work, I'm not sure it was worth it. My boyfriend said it looked authentic and it was good, but nothing fabulous like other postings. Now I have got left overs, and a lot of hot sauce.  I'll have to see how I can reuse the sauce.

This is an excellent recipe.  It has a long prep time especially when making side dishes along with it, but so worth the effort.  Thanks to this recipe, I will not be having my routine Mexican restaurant take out bill in my budget anymore.  I will definitely make this again and again.

This is very good! It's not as complicated to make as the recipe might make you believe.  I'm not big on HOT Mexican, so for the 5 serrano peppers, I substituted 1 jalapeno and 1 can of diced, mild green chiles.  That gave it enough kick for me!  We call it Nor-Mex around here!
I even found the tomatillos and queso fresco in my WI grocery.

Added some Monterey jack cheese to the inside of the enchilada & topped with some additional cheddar cheese on the top. Cut down the cilantro added to top & didn’t add anymore onions (my boyfriend’s not into that much onion). I put it in the oven after soaking in oil and dipping into the salsa at 350 degrees F until cheese on top was melted.

Sooooooo yummy!!!  They tasted just like the Enchiladas Verdes that I get at my favorite mexican restaurant.  The only thing I would change...it was way too spicy for me.  I only put 3 peppers but it was still super spicy.  Next time I will either do 1-2 with seeds or 3 without seeds.  You've gotta try this recipe if you like mexican food.  It's SUPER!!!

My rating is for the sauce--its amazing.  My store doesn't always carry tomatillos, so when I buy them I freeze them in their husks (they freeze very well). I also cooked the chicken as directed, wonderful and moist.  I gave the left over broth that it cooked in to my dogs--poured right over their dinner.  They went wild over it :-)

very good! I usually use a canned green sauce & monteray jack cheese when I make them. The flavor was much better and more authentic. I was concerned with using 5 serano's, so i only used 3 and scraped out the seeds. It came out very bland, so I sliced the rest and put them on top of the dish. Whenever we make chicken enchiladas we layer them in a cassarole dish. Torts, chicken, sauce, cheese - repeat.  Thanks for the recipe! Will use again and again !

Ok to make these you must have alot of time.  I have to agree with some of the other reviews and get the already fried tortillas.  I made it using very little spice was afraid would have been too hot.  I think next time I do it i will spice it up. Thanks.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a hit!  I didn't follow exactly to a T, I decided to make Burrito's instead of Enchiladas.  I also added cilantro to the salsa and added a topping of cheese sauce and sour cream to the burrito's. The chicken came out great and the sauce is amazing!!

So so good!  I think our serrano peppers were a LITTLE too ripe or something, cause it was very very spicey.  I have grown up with mexican food, so I can handle spice, but this had me sweating!  :P  But it was still excellent, I'll definitely cook this again!

It was pretty good. Very authentic but tasted very pesto-y. I only used 3 serrano peppers was the perfect amount of heat for me. If I make it again I will cut the tomatillos down to half.

Absolutely delicious!!!! Made 1/2 lb. of the tomatillos and also used 2 boneless chicken breasts and a can of chicken broth.  Used only 1 serrano but sliced and did remove some of the seeds, also at the very last minute found I ran out of corn tortillas so used flour - worked great.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

Very yummy salsa. I made chicken and salsa in adcance, and sauteed onion and garlic with chicken when I reheated it. I also added sour cream to this mixture before assembling the enchiladas. I only had flour tort's, so I skipped the frying process and just dipped them in the salsa. Heated through in oven. Thank you!

Incredible,  I only used 2 serrano peppers and it was perfect.  I found a store that sold the tomatillas and the queso fresco which made the meal superb.

This was very good.I only used 4 serranos instead of 5 and it was nice and spicy.I may try next time cooking the meat and broth in the crock pot instead of boiling, but this still was delicious!

We made this recipe last night and absolutely loved it!  We did use all 5 serrano peppers, but fortunately can take the heat.  We chose to bake the enchiladas instead of baking them, and I used fresh Parmesan.  This is quite a keeper!
