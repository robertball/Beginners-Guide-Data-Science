We really liked the flavor for this. I didn’t have any Chile flakes so I used chili powder. The only thing I will do differently is how I bake it. The squash didn’t get cooked all the way through. I usually cook at 400 and for the first half hour I cook it upside down in small layer of water. Once I turn it over then I (very carefully!) add whatever butter or topping I’m putting on. Definitely going to make it again.

It was good but in the end it felt like it was missing something, so I added more salt and some parm.  Very easy dish to make that impresses.  I also served it right in the boat for presentation.
