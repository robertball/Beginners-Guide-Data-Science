This was an ENORMOUS hit on Christmas morning with my entire family! Everyone loved the presentation at first and was surprised at how refreshing the drink was. Thank you! This has now become a Christmas morning tradition in our family!

I made this for a party and it was not a hit at all.  Something was lacking...it could be that the pomegranate juice did not have a really bold taste.

Very fresh and tasty!  Tried it one time with 'all natural' pom juice, it wasn't bold enough.  So the next time I made it I used a can of frozen juice and reconstituted it with only half the amount of water required. Also I used superfine sugar in place of the powdered sugar. Powdered sugar adds a taste that I don't personally like.

I left out the sugar -- the rest of the mix is sweet enough. I did toss a splash or two of sweet and sour in, and then about 1/4 cup beer to mellow it out. Very yummy.

I made this drink for my husband and myself one night and it was great. I made a bigger batch (double) for a party the following weekend and it was AMAZING!!!! The difference was in the technique and very minor ingredient changes. The night before the party I juiced the limes but prior to cutting/juicing them, I zested them. I added the zest to the lime juice and then combined it with the pomegranate juice and granulated sugar and put it all in the refrigerator. (Doing it this way really intensifies the lime flavor and allows you to use regular sugar.) I put the liquors in the freezer that night. The morning of the party, I strained the pom/lime juice and then combined the juice and liquor and put the whole thing in the freezer until party time. This means it is REALLY cold before serving and your ice won't melt right away and dilute the drink when you pour into the salted glasses. Doubling the recipe used 2/3 of the liquor in each 750 ml bottle and yielded a half-gallon of the cocktail. If you want enough for a gallon, be sure to buy the larger liquor bottles. ENJOY!

The first time I made this thought it was missing something.   So I  added one can frozen lime aid concentrate and took out the sugar, but I did leave in the fresh lime juice.  It was so refreshing.  This has become a signature drink of mine.

A great drink to serve with two other recipes found on this website: Mexican salmon and avocado stuffed sweet potatoes.

My husband and I thought this was VERY good.  I used fresh squeezed juice from a couple of pomegranates that I needed to use up.  I left out the sugar, but used Rose's sweetened lime juice (instead of fresh) so I think that balanced out nicely.  Will definitely make again!

Just add Grand Marnier!  I also used limeade concentrate instead of lime juice!  Yummy!
