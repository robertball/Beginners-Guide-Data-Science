My family and guests devoured this dish. Definitely will make it again. As another suggested, I marinated the chicken first--I used lemon juice, garlic and italian dressing.  Also, after assembling everything, I put it in the oven to melt the cheese and finish cooking the chicken. Since I didn't have cheddar on hand, I used an italian/mozzerella blend.

This is delicious!! Changes I made... I fried the bacon first (used bacon fat instead of oil). I know it's not as healthy, but it gave the chicken more flavor. After sauteing the onions, I removed them, then I put the chicken back in the skillet and put bacon & onion mixture on top, sprinkled with the shredded cheese, and warmed it all til the cheese melted. Hubby, kids, & myself enjoyed it!!

This is a great recipe. I changed it just a touch when I made it. I added a green and a red pepper and about a cup of mushrooms to the onions and cooked until soft. I then placed the chicken in an oven pan covered with the veggies and cheese and crumbled two pieces of bacon over the top and then baked at 470 for ten minutes.

This is awsome chicken, how could it not be with cheese, onions, and bacon?  However, I decided to let the chix marinade in about 1T of lemon juice, 1T chopped garlic, salt and pepper, and a little olive oil for a couple of hours instead of using the lemon seasoning.  I also set it under the broiler at the end for a few seconds to ensure the cheese melted.  It came out great and got rave reviews from my company, and family.

This recipe is great. The only thing I did different was set the chicken in the oven for a few minutes to help melt the cheese.

I made this last night and It was GREAT!!! I took the advice from others. I cooked the bacon first. I then took two tablespoons of bacon drippings and a small amount of oil and added it to the brown sugar and cooked the onions in it. I then cooked the chicken in the bacon drippings for about 8-10 min.. each side. I then placed them on a cookie tray - placed the shredded cheese on, then the bacon, then the onions and then more cheese - i then covered it with foil - allowing the sides to stay somewhat open so that the cheese would not stick to the top and cooked it in the oven for 12 min at 380 degrees.

It CAME OUT GREAT!!!!!! AWESOME!!! I WILL  BE MAKING THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!!

Sorry. This sounded like it was going to be terrific with those ingredients but it wasn't. Way too sweet.

I cooked this amazing dish tonight... and my husband loved it.  I did add some garlic pepper and lemon juice along with the lemon pepper and salt. I let it sit for about an hour.  I liked the idea about putting the chicken( bacon with toppings-onions and cheese) in the oven... it just made everything melt into one.  I loved it!!!

This was really good - not "knock my socks off" good - but a nice, different taste.  Here is what I did different.  I did not have lemon pepper as I thought I did, so I browned the chicken with salt, pepper and a splash of lemon juice.  Then I removed them and added the onions, brown sugar and already cooked and crumbled bacon.  I topped each chicken breast with the onion mixture and cheese then broiled for a few minutes.  I would make this again.

I LOVED this!  I did change the order of how I cooked things though.  First I crisped diced bacon in my cast iron skillet, strained, threw in my onions until brown.  Then I threw in a ton of mushrooms (with a bit of butter) until golden.  Then, I threw in the chicken breasts and cooked on one side until that side was nice and crispy.  I flipped the chicken, threw everything on top (including cheddar cheese) and baked at 450 for 20 minutes.  OMG, it was amazing!  Too unhealthy to eat all the time...but wow, next time I have my in-laws over, I'm making these!

This was AWESOME...15 stars!!  Here's what I did diff: I cooked the chicken in the bacon grease, removed the chicken and candied the onions in the bacon/chicken drippings, then poured that onion mix on top of the cheese covered chicken and put in oven for a few minutes to melt...DELISH! I will make this again!

This is our favorite Chicken Recipe!  I've been making it for a few years.  I skip the lemon pepper b/c I never have it on hand and just season lightly with whatever I do have.  I find that the 1/4 brown sugar is too sweet; I use about 2-3TBS.  I've also skipped the whole bacon drippings part and used the pre-cooked bacon or the kind used for salad (not the crunchy ones though).... still turns out well too.  I've even skipped the cheese - and we all still love it!.... Obviously it's a very versatile recipe!!

This was so easy to make.  I received raves from the family.  I followed the recipe pretty much, but I didn't use as much brown sugar.  Two tablespoons was perfect.  Also I crumbled the bacon over the top of the onions and cheese.  I put the pan in the oven at 400 degrees for 10 minutes and it came out perfect!

I made this just as it's written. I only cooked two very large chicken breasts that I had pounded to flatten a bit (helps it cook evenly). One for my husband and one for myself. I was amazing. Such a burst of different flavors all mixed into one great dish. My husband hates onions, but loved this since the brown sugar brings down the "oniony" flavor. Thanks for the share!

This is a restaurant quality dish! My husband and I love this one. I do not add as much brown sugar to the onion mixture, about a tablespoon instead of the 1/4 cup. It gives the onions just a hint of sweetness and that is just right for us. I served it with twice baked potatoes. Delicious.
**UPDATE**
I just made this recipe on the grill and it turned out even better than on the stove top. I marinated the chicken with half a bottle of Lawry's Garlic and Herb marinade for 4 hours. Preheated the grill to medium heat and grilled the chicken for about 8 minutes on each side. Then I put a piece of tinfoil on the grill and put my chicken on it and topped the chicken with the onion mixture, bacon, and cheese and continued to cook it until the cheese was melted. Using the tinfoil prevents you from losing your onion mixture etc in the grill grates.

Very very good! I reversed order on the prep., I fried the bacon, next then fried the onions, and finally the chicken, so the chicken is still hot. Using the same cast iron skillet I plied the bacon on then the onions and cheese and popped it into a hot oven to melt the cheese. Excellent, moist and so flavorful. I also did a quick one hour marinade of lemon juice, oil with my mix of herbs which of course includes garlic and some hot pepper grind and drained before frying.

This is now our favorite chicken recipe.  I made a few changes simply because I needed to use ingredients I had on hand.  We all know how that is!  I didn't have any lemon-pepper seasoning, so I just used S&P.  I used maple flavored bacon and only 1 strip per breast - it was PLENTY and the maple flavoring added to the flavor!  I did back down the brown sugar to 1 Tbl because of the maple flavoring though.  I also used extra sharp cheddar cheese since it's what I had on hand.  I served it with the cheesy brown rice recipe from this site and baked sweet potatoes with butter and salt on them.  The blend of the flavors of those 3 dishes together was like a party in my mouth and my hubby love it too!  I WILL be adding this meal to our rotation!  YUM!  BTW, we reheated this for meals on the 2 following days and all 3 items that I served reheated very well - the chicken never lost it's flavor.  Again, I say - YUM!!!

First of all, I'm not a fan of onions.  I made this recipe bc my boyfriend LOVES sauteed onions, and I wanted to make a special dinner for him.  He did love it- scooped up every last bit of onion and sauce on the plate.  And even I, someone who hates onions, wanted seconds, bc they were soooo good prepared this way!  Didn't do much differently.  I baked the chicken in the oven.  Didn't measure out two tablespoons of bacon grease, just left it all in the pan.  When the chicken had a few minutes left I scooped the onions and crumbled bacon on top of the breasts and added the cheese, and let it all melt together, as other reviewers suggested.  Since I had extra bacon grease I spooned a little of that onto the chicken as well, to add some flavor.  Also, my bf doesn't like seasoning on his chicken, so I skipped the lemon/salt step.  Other than those tiny changes I followed the recipe to a T and it was delicious, can't wait to make it again and maybe add some peppers!

This was very good but a little on the sweet side. Next time, I'll cut the sugar by at least half, and possibly add some pepper flakes or use pepper jack cheese to heat it up a little.  We grilled the chicken and added the toppings afterwards.

We made this at my home and substituted the onions for apples (Because we didn't have onions) and added a little bit of onion powder.
  I was still delicious!

This is a great recipe that can be modified or it is wonderful as is!  Sometimes I make it with out the lemom pepper seasoning and use a grill mix from my local spice shop.  I have also used a bloody mary seasoning on it which is awesome of course if you do this leave out the brown sugar.  You can also switch up the cheese, I like to use provel or harvarti sometimes yummy!  It is on our dinner menu at least once a month!  Thanks for sharing!

Yummy.  With 3 teenage boys that just love bacon, this was a hit.  I did as others suggested and cooked the bacon first in a cast iron skilled then browned the breasts up in the carmelized onions.  Put it in the 420 degreen oven for about 15 minutes after putting the bacon on the breasts and then the cheese on top of that -- excellent!  Kudos to Brenda Carpenter.

Super yummy, but I would cook the chicken in the oven in stead for about 25-30 minutes. Then, put it under the broiler with all the cooked toppings for a minute. I would definitely make this again, maybe seasoning the chicken with some garlic powder too. Husband says, "it was good."

I give it 5 stars, but I did change a lot haha, first I omitted bacon and cheese because I didn't need all the extra calories.. I marinated in lemon and garlic overnight and skipped the lemon-pepper seasoning..

That being said, it was a pieceof HEAVEN, i couldn't stop eating it.. yumyumyum!!

We loved this, I would probably make some changes next time that I read on the reviews here - making the bacon first, cooking the chicken in the bacon drippings, sticking the whole thing in the oven after so the cheese and onions all melt together.

Family LOVED this dish!  We used glaric powder instead of the lemon pepper and crumbled the bacon over the chicken and onions instead of using the whole pieces.  Will cook this one again and again.  Hubby said he would give it 10 stars if it were possible.  lol

I made this as directed to in the recipe except I didn't have that kind of cheese...I subed it for the Kraft Mexican cheese.  This recipe is great with or without the cheese.  We all loved it.  It's easy to make and the onion/bacon mixture really tops it off.  I would definitly make this again!

This recipe is just okay; not nearly as good as this site's "Aussie Chicken".  That is a way better chicken/bacon recipe.  This recipe tastes fine, but it needs some kind of sauce like a honey mustard to keep the chicken from tasting too dry.

Loved this recipe! Hubby and son devoured it. Followed jeannie048's suggestion, fried the bacon first. And yes, I thought 1/4 cup brown sugar was too sweet, so used one tablespoon of it. Added some paprika to give it that hot zesty flavor! Will definitely make it again. I wonder if anyone could suggest a sauce that could go with it.

Loved this chicken recipe, my husband HATES chicken unless it is deep fried, but he did try it, I did cook the chicken a little in my crockpot then I fried the bacon then I took the chicken with the lemon season on them fried it in the bacon grease I know harden of the arteries but so good then I took the chicken set it aside then took the onions chopped them up put 2 tablespoons of brown sugar caramelized then added onto of the chicken then bacon but I broke the bacon in pieces, then added Colby jack cheese then put in oven until melted plus had twice baked potatoes from this site , just one word my husband LOVED IT said I could make it again, for someone that won't eat chicken other than deep fried , thank you for a wonderful recipe

This is the modification I did to this dish: microwaved the bacon a little and tore it to big chunks.  Browned the bacon with onion until the onion was soft.  Added the lemon-pepper.  Push the onion mixture aside while brown the chicken tenders.  Covered the tenders with the bacon mixture.  When chicken was almost done, add the brown sugar.  I also added a splash of marsala.  I skipped the cheese.

This is definitely lacking flavor, the bacon and onion on top was the only flavor. I added more lemon pepper than the recipe called for and also marinated it in buttermilk but the chicken it self was very bland even with using bacon grease instead of oil

Excellent meal! I made it for Father's Day because my husband LOVES bacon - he devoured a giant breast. I had bone-in on hand which turned out fine (juicy, even!). I took the advice of other posters - cooked the bacon first, then the onions, then the chicken and finally baked the chicken in the oven for about 15-20 min at 380. I used just a few tbsps of brown sugar and cheddar cheese. It was absolutely delicious!!!!!!!! Will make again!

My husband was a bit skeptical about my cooking dinner tonight.  But when he walked in the door he commented that it smelled good.  He had the first taste and said, wow, this is good.  He added that he would make and serve this recipe to company.  

On a side note, I did not have lemon-pepper seasining so I just used lemon juice and pepper, I cooked the bacon in the microwave and sauteed the onions in the same dish as I used for the chicken.  I only had cheddar cheese but I am sure the colby/monterey jack would have been just as good.  I guess this is a keeper in the recipe box.  Thank you!

I followed this recipe as written except that I followed the recommendations of several other posters and finished baking it in the oven.  The family really enjoyed this recipe but all agreed the lemon-pepper seasoning was an odd taste with this recipe.  I will use salt and pepper next time.  Otherwise, it was a great recipe and the family raved about the onions.

This recipe has a LOT of potential, but as others have said, 1/4C. brown sugar makes the onions entirely too sweet for my taste - I sliced the onion and sauteed it in a little olive oil then sprinkled roughly 1/4 tsp. of brown sugar in and they turned out perfect. 

I also used a marinade which included what is listed here along with olive oil, lemon juice (with the lemon-pepper) some minced garlic, and sprinkled in some chicken seasoning and parsley flakes.  Then I let them marinade for about 2 hours before cooking them.

Another issue I had was cooking the chicken breasts through in the skillet, so I slightly browned them then put them in the oven at 350 until the center reached about 150 - at that point, I pulled them out, added the bacon, cheese and onions (I sauteed in a red pepper as well), then returned them until they finished cooking (160).

It turned out delicious and the chicken was incredibly juicy and full of flavor!  We will definitely be making this again, with the minor changes I made!

I can now get my hubby to eat chicken breasts!  Up until now, he hated chicken breasts, no matter how I made them.  This is a keeper just as is.

DIVINE!! Anything with bacon rules but it went so well with the caramelized onions. We  really loved all of the flavors. It is sweet, salty, savory and scrumptious! I didnt have lemon pepper but I soaked the breasts in lemon and then used cracked pepper. I squeezed lemon on the chicken at the end to make it extra tangy. Definitely plan on making this again very soon!

This recipe is GENIUS! Wasn't sure how the brown sugar was going to fit in, but it is amazing! I made enough for leftovers and I didn't have any. My husband was giving it to the neighbors to try! :) Love it!

This was an excellent recipe! I made a minor change by marinating the chicken first in soy sauce and rosemary. I followed the recipe otherwise. It did end up a little sweet so will cut back on brown sugar just a bit. My husband loves my cooking but said with this I had out done myself.

This was an instant favorite with my family!  I will definitely be making this again.  I used all the ingredients as written, but I did as one reviewer suggested and cooked the bacon first, then I drained the fat (saving it) and cooked the onions in about 4T of fat and cooked the chicken in the rest of the fat.  Then I put everything together and put it in the oven on low temp just to melt it all together.  It was delicious!

amazing!  I didn't even add the cheese and the taste was still incredible.  The bacon and carmelized onions really make this dish.  I prefer however, to cook the chicken without seasoning so there are not any flavors competing with the bacon and onions.

I fallowed the receipe except I fried the bacon first, then drained all but 2 tbps of bacon fat, mixedthe brown sugar into the bacon grease that I had drained off. My wife and daughter who was visiting raved how good it was. Will use this receipe again.

I did not have lemon pepper and the only bacon I had was already cooked.  So, I saled and peppered the chicken and browned in a little oil.  When the chicken was browned, I removed it from the skillet and added the onions, crumbled, cooked bacon and brown sugar and cooked on low.  I cut the chicken up into bite size pieces and put back into the skillet, and cooked on low for about 10 to 15 minutes.  This tasted sooooo good that I never even added the cheese.  I'm not sure it would have been as good with the cheese.

this is the best chicken breasts we have ever eaten.  I made a change and it still came out, had to use breasts with skin and bone.  What happened was the chic hen first was baked at 350 for half hour, then fried, and then baked in oven at 200 for 2 hours with a bowl of water to keep from drying.  Came out m
Moist and tasty.  Thank you for recipe.

This one is for sure going into the rotation!  I used turkey bacon and low fat mozzarella cheese; also used thin sliced chicken breasts and only a quarter of the brown sugar listed.  The chicken was juicy and the flavors from the bacon and onion were fantastic!

I thought this was awesome. I only used about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and it   was the perfect sweetness, I think any more would've been WAY too sweet. It turned out really good and I will definitely make it again....but maybe next time I'll try mozzarella or pepper jack cheese.

Absolutely delicious!  I made a few minor changes, ,I marinated the chicken in Kraft Zesty Italian and I also put it under the broiler and melted the cheese before serving.  It was an easy recipe to follow, easy cleanup, as you only have the one pan!  My family loved it!!!!  This is definitely a dish that will be fixed often!  Thanks!

I was looking for a recipee that was not as salty as Anniversary Chicken found on this site.  This was the absolute answer.  I fixed this for a large family meal, and everyone from my picky 6 year old to my gourmet type daughter to my "meat and potato"  husband loved the moist chicken and rated this a "do again".  I did make one change.  I drizzled 1/4 cup Yoshida's teriyaki marinade on the chicken breasts and rubbed it in well before baking.  Thanks for a great, easy and elegant chicken entree!

I've cooked this recipe several times. I hadn't made it in awhile but my daughter is here from college and requested it so I made it tonight. My entire family loves it! This one of the few recipes all the kids and my husband of course agrees on. Tonight the only thing I did differently was use butter instead of oil but either way is delicious.

I followed other reviews using bacon drippings to sauté chicken in, then warmed all in the oven when assembled.  It was one of the best dinners I've ever made!

Huge hit with family!  I also did the bacon first, then used the drippings for the cooking the chicken. Used a second pan for carmelizing the onions, adding a clove of minced garlic close to the end.  Also squeezed the juice and pulp of a lime and 'steamed' the covered chicken while waiting for onions.  Broiled in a baking dish for several minutes to melt the cheese.  Yummy!

Yum and yum!  I prepared it as directed, then put it under the broiler so the cheese was nice and bubbly. Husband not only loved this, he loved the fact that it was all done in one skillet because he does the dishes!  Will make this again and again!

What I loved about this recipe was how easy it was to throw together and alter (for a healthier meal). My bf loved it, and I opted out of the bacon and monterey jack cheese for some light mozzarella and grilled red peppers. Keeps both of us happy taste-wise and keeps my calories down!

Made this tonight..it was great! I had bell pepper and fresh mushrooms, so included them with the onions (just 2 teaspoons sugar). I chopped the bacon, and added it to the veggies after they were cooked. Made mine in a iron skillet, so was able to put it in the oven to melt the cheese. Wonderful!!

Very good,my boyfriend loves it. I did use bbq sauce instead of brown sugar like one review suggested and I also added some sliced green peppers and spinach to the onions. It was delicious, will be making this again for sure.

Butterflied the chicken. Marinated in a little lemon juice with lemon and garlic pepper. Browned in a little oil.  Removed, kept warm. Sauteed onions - added mushrooms and garlic.  Used cooked bacon bits. Placed onion, mushroom mixture on top of chicken.  Sprinkled a little Italian cheese blend on top - placed in over for about 15 minutes for cheese to melt.  Delish!

A very good recipe, we did use turkey bacon.  I know it would have been even better with real bacon.  How can you go wrong with bacon cheese and onion?  Comfort food at it's best and so easy to make

This was absolutely delicious.  I prepared the dish a little backwards.  I cooked the bacon and onions in the pan first, then cooked the chicken in a little oil and some of the bacon drippings for extra flavor, and omitted the brown sugar altogether.  After the chicken was cooked through, I covered the breasts with the chopped bacon, cheese, and the sautéed onions, covering the pan with a cover to melt the cheese.  Yum.

Excellent recipe with a couple of minor changes. I chopped up the bacon then fried it up so that it was already a crumble then removed from the pan leaving the oil. I divided the oil. Added red and green peppers to the onion to 1/2 of the bacon grease and sauted with 1 heaping TBSP of sugar. I cooked the chicken in the other half of the bacon grease adding seasoning salt and lemom pepper. After the chicken was cooked, I added the chicken to a pirex baking pan, topped with the sauted vegies and 1/2 the bacon crumble then added the cheese and topped with the rest of the bacon crumble. I baked it at 375* for 15 minutes. My husband and kids loved it.

Great! Made a couple changes as well.  Cooked chicken in PAM non-stick spray.  Used 4 pieces of Butterball turkey bacon and used fat free chicken broth for the extra liquid with onions and brown sugar.  Finally topped it off with 75% reduced fat CABOT cheddar and placed it under broiler until cheese was melted.  Delish!

Very good, will make this again.  Followed other reviewers suggestions and did not use the lemon pepper seasoning.  Marinated the chicken breasts in italian dressing and 1 TBS of minced garlic for a few hours.  Also added fresh diced tomatoes on top of the chicken.  I baked the assembled chicken in the oven at 350 for 20 mins in addition to frying in the pan.  Husband loved this.

This dish was very yummy! I fried the bacon first, then caramelized the onions plus the brown sugar in about 2 tbls of the drippings. Then I scooped the onions out with a slotted spoon, leaving drippings behind. I let the chicken cook in the drippings for about 10 min on each side. Then added cut bacon and onions. Sprinkled cheddar cheese and covered it until it melted. My family loved it! This is a keeper.

This is was a really good meal, as a young single professional just starting out,  this meal was not too exhausting after a long day of work, and was super flavorful. I did bake it afterwards for about ten minutes at 450 degrees just to ensure it was thoroughly cooked.

Very good chicken!  I cooked the bacon first and then cooked the chicken in the bacon fat.  I added a garlic clove to the pan while cooking the chicken.  I didn't use brown sugar, instead I used bbq sauce.  Finished it off in the oven to melt the cheese.  This recipe is a keeper!

I Love This!! This is by far the best chicken recipe I have ever come across. Really appreciate this being shared with us. My change to the recipe was to marinade the chicken in some Italian dressing with some lime juice, seasoning salt, and lemon-pepper. Marinade for about 30 minutes and it gives it a nice flavor. My whole family loved it and said it was the best chicken I have ever made. Thank you for this, will definitely make this again.

This was yummy.  I already had some cooked bacon so just added it to the pan with the onions.  I didn't have the Colby-Jack cheese so used Mozzarella.  I also used maybe 1 T of the brown sugar because I didn't need the extra sweetness.

My entire family loved this chicken.  We don't eat bacon, so I used the drippings from the chicken and added butter to caramelize the onions.  I will definitely make it again.

First, I dont like sweet anything!  BUT....  this was GREAT and sooo easy.  My "shortcut" was  I made extra bacon with Sunday breakfast so I was able to skip that step.  I did not use quite 1/4 cup brown sugar and I used extra onions b/c my family loves  onions,  slo this is the FIRST time I rated any recipe...it was THAT  good and easy

This recipe was great.  The only thing I changed is that I used jalapeno cheese to give it a little kick. I also put it in the oven to finish it off and melt the cheese.  My husband loved it!

This really is a GREAT dish.  I get tired of the same old chicken, but this recipe really added a lot of flavor.  I used Italian marinaded chicken breasts and added some red, yellow and green peppers to the mix, but everything else i kept the same. Everyone LOVED it!!!!

Wow!  This is yummy!!!  It takes just like an entree that I get from a restaurant.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer & put the onions & crumbled bacon over the chicken, then the cheese and baked in the oven until the cheese melted (about 5 minutes).  I can't imagine that this is the healthiest recipe, so I will have to make it sparingly, but I will definitely be making this again.

I marinated my chicken for an hour with a little italian dressing and some garlic powder a long with the lemon pepper.  I also cooked the bacon first, then the chicken, to get the extra flavor on the chicken and it was definately worth it!  I threw some mushrooms in with my onions too and overall it was awesome!  My husband ate 2 servings and then took the leftovers for lunch today!!

A new family favorite. I also put it all in a dish and baked it for about 8 minutes to melt everything together. I will use more onions next time. Great mixture of textures.

Yum-mee! My husband raved over this chicken and said it's one of the best dishes I've ever made. Omitted lemon pepper (didn't have any) and used white cheddar. Also, as others suggested, only used 2 T of brown sugar. Excellent -- will definitely make again and again!

The bacon adds a great crunchy saltiness to the chicken and the cheese just brings it all together. Like several other reviewer I cooked the bacon first then the chicken then the onions.  I was a little worried about the brown sugar but it actually didn't taste overly sweet at all.  I'll definitely be giving this recipe another go around in the future.

I made this last night and my family loved it. It's easy to make and the chicken comes out juicy.  I used my hand meat tenderizer to  flatten the chicken a bit before cooking. I also cut it back on the brown sugar, used 1tbsp. I found that amount was sweet enough for me.  I didn't have Colby-Monterey Jack cheese but used Gouda cheese slices that I had in the fridge.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks.

I made this for the kids (all grown & visiting) and everyone loved it! Very different spin on Chicken to say the least. The caramelized onions & bacon were great flavor sensations. Next time I would increase the amount of onions so they are really smothered!

This has become a family favorite in our household. The first time I made it, I thought the sauce was too sweet, but the second time, I really let the onions caramelize and scraped up the bits off of the bottom of the pan, then added the brown sugar and let it really caramelize as well. Much, much better! I serve it with rice pilaf and a saute of zucchini/squash/onion in olive oil with a little seasoned salt. Delicious!

Made this last night and will definitely make again. It was easy and delicious. After I topped it, I put it in the oven for a moment to let the cheese melt. My hubby called it "restaurant" fare! Served it with steamed buttered green beans and baby red potatoes.

Excellent.  A favorite restraunt of mine has these and I order them often.  Just like the restraunt I recommend adding sliced mushrooms as well.  Delicious, my family gobbled it up!

I cut the amount of brown sugar in half and used green onions. OMG was this good! I have made a similar recipe using browned fresh mushrooms and cheddar cheese, seasoning the meat with fresh ground black pepper and Mrs. Dash Original. The sweet onion sauce was a great change, though!

This was exceptionally good.  I only used 1 piece of bacon per chicken breast and it was great.  I also used the over for 10 minutes to make sure it was done.  This also makes a great sandwich.  Use a hoogie roll.

AWESOME, family even loved it. Modified it for kids-no onions. I like recipes you can modify for personal preference extra this-less of that.I am not a big onion fan but w/ the brown sugar they were great. I used precooked bacon and just added EVOO to onions. Heated them in oven to melt cheese. Took awhile to make but really worth it when we sat down to eat.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was great. YUM what is not to like. My husband is not a chicken lover, so I pick recipies carfully and he LOVED IT. Thank you so much. I did use twice the onions and baked it at the end but other then that followed it to a T. It is a keeper........

Wow! This is a wonderful comfort food and also quite impressive to serve to company. My only changes were adding a can of mushrooms with the onion mixture and a lot more cheese which was melted under the broiler. I didn't just smother the chicken....I outright killed it! It is just the perfect blend of ingredients and the flavor just knocked our socks off! I'm already thinking of other dishes that I can use the onions with....they were so incredible. Thank you so much for this recipe. It will be a standard in our house.

This recipe was good, easy and tasty.  I cut the chicken into strips and return back to the pan where onions and sauce were awaiting, mixing all together.  The chicken got sweet great flavor.  I melted some swiss cheese on top(didn't have the other cheese)and wrap into tortillas.  awesome quick and easy fajitas, thanks!

Good recipe, my boyfriend liked it. I just used a spice mix instead of the lemon pepper and added mushrooms with the onions, since he really likes them. He thought the brown sugar part was too sweet, so next time I'll leave that out. Thanks for the recipe!

I think this is excellent!  I marinate the chicken a little before w/ olive oil, lemon juice, garlic powder, salt and pepper b/c I keep forgetting to get lemon pepper.  It comes out awsome!  Thank you!

This was a very easy and yummy recipe.  It certainly isn't the lowest in fat content, but the entire family cleaned their plates.  My 7 year old twin boys "liked the onions even!"

While the bacon was cooking, I placed the chicken on a plate in the oven on 170-200 degrees to keep it warm.  When the onions were done, I just put the toppings on and let it sit in the oven for a few more minutes to melt the cheese.  It was very tender and flavorful.

Thanks for an EASY and great recipe that uses items I usually have on hand.

I really enjoyed this recipe - thought it was great but my husband was not as sold on it. He thought it needed some bbq sauce to dip it in - will probably do this next time. I also bumped up the lemon pepper to 1 tsp to give some more zest and thought that worked nicely.

Very good, added a lot more cheese and onion and used thick bacon.  DH swears it tastes just like Alice Springs from Outback.

We enjoyed this dish very much.  The flavors blend nicely and the carmelized onions add a tastey finish.  I used less bacon than called for with no impact on the final product.  Would make this again.
