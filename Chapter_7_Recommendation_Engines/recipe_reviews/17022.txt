Excellent!  I baked it at 425 for 30 mins and it turned out great.  To keep the bottom crust from being soggy I pierced it with a fork several times and baked it in the oven a few minutes before adding the filling. I brushed an egg wash on top and it was golden brown.  I also added lemon pepper, garlic powder, a bit more salt and fresh ground pepper to the filling or it would have been a little bland.

Excellent recipe! Easy to do, easy to tweak to your liking...I took some shortcuts...I used perdue shortcuts chicken...used frozen broccoli florets and chopped up...used bagged baby carrots I steamed and chopped...cream of chicken w/herbs (as another reviewer did, great idea) tossed in half a can of diced new potatoes...used store brand pie crust...and after filling crust put one more layer of shredded cheddar before putting on the top crust.
It came out phenomenal! Even better today than last night when it was fresh...my first pot pie and hubby and baby girl LOVED it! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was delicious! I used the Campbell's cream of chicken & mushroom blend. The only thing I would suggest is lowering the heat (maybe 375* or 400*) and cooking it a bit longer. I noticed my pie was not quite hot in the middle, but the crust was getting really dark. I will definitely make this again!

I made this for tonight's dinner.  I altered the recipe a bit though.  I omitted the cheese (because I'm not a fan). In addition to the veggies I used one stalk of celery, half a sweet potato, and half a red onion.  Instead of regular cream of chicken, I used campbell's cream of chicken and herb.  Also, I used pre-cooked chicken strips.  Then I topped it off with 1/2 cup of bisquick mixed with one egg and 2 tbs of water.  It's beautiful!

What a great way to use up vegetables!  I used a Pilsbury pie crust and thought it was delicious.  Added 1 baked potato (peeled & cubed) & 1 stalk of chopped celery.  Cooked at 350 for 60 minutes.  My husband was working late so I kept his portion warm in the oven at 200.  Can't wait to make this on a cool evening in the fall!

This is an instant favorite in our home.  I didn't have any chicken breast thawed out, so I used a can of precooked chicken (10 oz I think) and it was perfect!  You could also use left over turkey.  Next time I will add a can of mixed veggies as well.  Both my 3 yr old & 1 yr old ate a ton of this-NO left overs.  I'll make two next time!

This pot pie was perfect.  My husband raved about it as well!  One note - I don't think it serves 6, unless you're having something along with the pie, as that would be quite a small serving.  We'll definitely make this again!

I would have been happy eating just the filling!  Cooked the chicken and then steamed the veggies in the same pan the chicken was cooked in.  Little extra flavor, less to clean up, and best of all...it was quick!  Nothing beats quick, cheap, and easy.  Especially when it's good for you!  Definitely something we'll be making again.

Great recipe. I used 1/2 cup of milk b/c at first it was slightly too watery for my liking. Also added potatoes, some fresh pepper, and baked at 375 b/c my pie crusts were burning on the edges. Also, had to take out cheese b/c i'm lactose intolerant. 

I can't stop cooking this though. it's soooooo good!

All I have to say is, it tasted like cream of chicken soup.  I don't consider this cooking, and I wish I could find a better pot pie recipe on this site.

This pie was easy and delicious! I added asparagus and zuchinni to the mix of vegetables. And I added garlic, parsley, and pepper to make it extra flavorful! Will definitely make again.

This was great! So easy too. I dumped in  a can of corn, a can of carrots, a couple parboiled potatoes, a can of cream of celery, 1/2 a can of milk, some salt and pepper and garlic powder and poultry seasoning and a cooked, shredded chicken breast into a bowl and mixed it all up. I used store bought pie crust, put one on the bottom of a 9 inch pan, and then poured the filling in and put the top crust on and sealed the edges, and cut a couple steam holes out. Then I coverded it in foil and froze it. 2 days later, I baked it at 350 for an hour and a half ish, and it was ready. It was delish :)

Omitted the broccoli and used mixed veges instead.  Added chopped onion and seasoned garlic for extra taste.  Spread egg wash on top of pie to give it a special touch and cooked the pie at 400 for 45 minutes.  Everyone raved about it! I am making it for another dinner tomorrow night.

Best chicken pot pie i've ever eaten! rivals restaurant pies. The only thing I will do differently next time is to prebake the bottom crust for a bit before added the filling, as it was a little soggy- but didn't detract from the deliciousness!

Very delicious and easy to make! I added in one small yellow potato, and one stalk of celery. I also followed some suggestions in the comments to use two cans of buttery crescent rolls for the crusts, which worked extremely well. They are light, flaky and buttery. I would suggest using more soup to make more gravy, but that's my personal taste. I put in less salt - just a few shakes. I put in pepper and basil for more flavor. I'm sitting here eating it right now, and I'll definitely be making it again, especially now that it's getting colder!

I give this  starts b/c it is a great base recipe. You can change it in so many ways, depending on what you have one hand. Once I threw in left over green beans and corn. I usually cut down the milk slightly. At the end of cooking the chicken I throw in diced onion and garlic until satueed. I cook the broccoli in chicken broth and throw in some diced potatoes and the carrots until tender. Often time I will put a dash of parsley in the mix, before filling the crust. Delectable!

This is crazytown delicious. I made the following changes, all of which turned out great - 1) Baked the bottom layer of the crust in the preheated oven for 5-7 minutes before filling. I used a premade crust and it worked just fine. 2) Didn't precook the chicken. I just put it in the pie raw. This worked great and saved time/cleaning. It cooked just fine in the pie. 3) Used a Kraft mild/sharp/white cheddar shredded cheese mix. 4) Baked at 400, not 425. This turned out GREAT. It was a little salty, but that could easily be remedied by cutting down on the 1/2 tsp salt. I've been looking for a pot pie recipe that I could make "mine" for a long time. Looks like I've found it!

I loved this. Like a lot of people I made a few changes. I used cream of potato soup and I added up potatos. Next time I want to add mushrooms too. And instead of the pie pastry I used Pilsbury seamless crescent rolls. Oh also I added Itatlian seasoning. I thought this receipe was great because it was so easy and you could really cater it to your likings.

I used almost 2 cans of cream of potato soup. I had no milk so I thought the cheese was a great idea. I used 3/4 cup of cheddar and used the traditional vegetable melady (corn, carrots, Lima beans, green beans and potato) I added 1/3 cup water since I had no milk. Baked my bottom crust for 7 minutes so the ingrediants would not make it soggy. I added Paula Deens pepper mix, garlicpowder and Mrs Dash table blend. This turned out fabulous! I went back for 2nds and so did the hubby. Oh! I also tossed my chicken in a pat of melted butter because I got side tracked doing laundry and over boiled it. I can't wait for leftovers for lunch!

This was delicious! Easy too.  I think next time I will use a little less milk because I found it too runny for my liking, but I will be making this again for sure!

i omited the carrots, substituted a hickory smoked swiss and cheddar blended cheese, added a little garlic powder and black pepper.  This was a wonderful recipe.  My 2 and 5 year olds both loved it and my husband (who dosen't usually care for pot pies) ate almost half the pie himself.

I have made this pot pie many times. I usually make it to take to friends when they are in need of a meal when they are sick because it is such a comfort food. I do add an extra 1/2 can of soup along with a little extra milk to make a little more gravy. Wonderful recipe and fairly simple!

Pretty good base recipe. I used a frozen Pilsbury crust for the bottom, then whipped up a top crust made of 1/2 c. Bisquick, 1/4 stick of butter, and 1 tbsp. of water. I rolled that out on top of flour dusting with a flour-coated rolling pin then topped the pie with it. 

Really, you could use any veggies you want. I used what we had on hand: celery, a diced small potato (boiled about 10 minutes), cut carrots (boiled for a bit with the potatoes), garlic, and a cut zucchini. 

The only drawback I see is that the condensed soup makes it fairly salty...it would be nice to do the recipe where you made your filling completely from scratch.

I changed this recipe up quite a bit, that is why I gave it only 4 stars. My hubby said it was definitely one of his favorites. 
Using refrigerated pie crusts, I filled the inside with fresh broccoli (steamed), grated carrots, steamed chunks of sweet potato (basically cooked in the microwave w/ water until soft),corn, onion, garlic, and cooked turkey breast I had marinated in s&p, broth & worchestershire sauce.
I then had a can of cream of chicken AND cream of onion, and about a 1/2 cup of milk. 
Poured it all into the pie crust that I flash baked for 10 min, at 350 degrees. I had extra filling so I froze that and will use it again another day. 
This turned out really flavorful and rich. Since the soups were not diluted, they were almost TOO strong. But the taste test came out great!! Definitely something I will make again. 
PS I didn't add any cheese and you would not miss the cheese at ALL!!!!

This Pot Pie is delicious!  I used about a cup or so of a frozen veggie blend of carrots, peas, green beans and corn instead of the fresh broccoli and carrot, and also added one medium Yukon gold potato peeled and diced small.  This recipe is so easy and definitely "tweakable" to your own taste.

This is such a simple and easy-to-adjust recipe (although it is great as is.)  I often use low-fat sour cream instead of the milk and rotisserie chicken leftovers.  When I have extra time I saute some onion and celery to give it an extra depth of flavor. Bottom line - my husband is eating broccoli and the recipe is easy enough that I don't even look at it anymore!

I also used a store bought pie crust. I started by cutting up 3 med. sized carrots, one small onion and one large celery stalk and cooking until the carrots were half-way done. I added three diced chicken breasts to this and cooked till all were cooked. Then I drained in the colander. I then added one can of cream of celery soup (what I had on hand) to this mixture as well as some hungarian paprika, black pepper and garlic salt. As another reviewer noted, I par-baked the bottom crust for about 8 minutes on 375 to ensure it was not doughy. Then I added some cooked sliced whole potatoes and about a 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese and topped that with my chicken/veg/soup mixture and added top crust with slits on top. I baked it at 375 for 30 minutes, then at 420 for 10. It was really good and my husband even liked it, which is surprising as he doesn't generally like these types of dishes. I would say that I think I should have added 1 1/2 cans of soup, just for my own personal taste, but this came out great. Thanks for the recipe.

I've made chicken pot pie countless times using this recipe and it's always been delicious. I recommend adding peas or some other smaller vegetables so that there's more fillers between the chunky pieces of meat, carrots, and broccoli.  I also like to lightly satay the chicken breast chunks with some seasoning beforehand so that it doesn't taste too bland in the pie. Those that have tried this pie really enjoy it. It's much better than the ones you get from restaurants! I do heavily recommend making your own crust. If you really don't have the time, get the Pillsbury one. I've made mini pies using homemade crust and Pillsbury crust and my fiance could tell the difference. He always prefer the homemade crusts!

This recipe was great!  The only thing I recommend is adding more seasonings.  I added about 1 t. dried thyme, 1 t. poultry seasoning, 1 t. garlic powder, and 1 t. of onion powder.  Great and easy-thanks!

It was very good - Instead of a crust on the bottom and top, I put it in a casserole dish with no bottom to the pie and then used crescent rolls for the top crust.  Bake covered with tin foil for 15 minutes and then add the rolls and remove the tin foil for last 15 minutes.

I think this is a great starting point for chicken pot pie.  It's so easy to make and you can adjust it for your family's tastes.  I throw in canned potatoes and corn and leave out the carrots.  I also divide everything into 3 or 4 ramekins and bake them with a layer of puff pastry on top instead of using one big pie crust.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is so good and easy. Used frozen mixed vegetables rather than the brocolli but otherwise followed directions. This has become a family favourite which isn't easy with four picky children and an even pickier hubby.

I normally don't modify the recipes that I use on here, but after consideration, I did modify this one. This turned out to be DELICIOUS. I loved making it, eating, everything. SO EASY. I used frozen vegetables (corn, carrots, peas, green beans, lima beans) frozen potatoes that were pre chopped. I steamed the vegetables and potatoes for about 3 to 4 minutes just to get them started. I used a can of cream of chicken and mushroom (a little added flavor with the mushroom) and mixed the chicken, vegetables, potatoes all together in a bowl with the soup. Used a premade pie crust (great time saver) and spooned it all into the pie plate. Put in a few dabs of butter (again, more flavor) and then sealed it with the top of the crust. Sprinkled milk on it (to give a shiny appearance) and baked for 45 minutes. DELICIOUS. I can't wait to make it again.

This was delicious (and I don't like pot pie!).  I make my own homemade cream of soup & it's way better than the canned stuff.  Sometimes I add some chopped onion, corn, &/or edamame to the veggies.  My husband said to add some potatoes next time so I may throw in some frozen (thawed) hashbrowns if I have any.  Cauliflower would also be a good veggie to throw in here.  I had to bake for about 10-15 extra minutes because the top crust didn't seem done (I used the basic flaky pie crust from this site, I would not use that again).  Next time I think I would also do as others have done & pre-bake the bottom crust a little - it got lost in the filling.  But the filling texture was great for a pot pie - not too thick but not watery, and it surprisingly tasted good without any extra seasonings (I thought it would be bland).

Turned out great! I used cream of chicken with herbs and it was delish. Also boiled the veggies for a couple minutes instead of steaming them because I didn't really have steaming cookware and that worked out fine as well.

Love this recipe! It's quick and simple if you opt for pre-made pie crusts, frozen veggies and precooked chicken strips! I highly recommend doing the egg wash and cooking the bottom crust for 5 or so minutes. The crust does begin to burn toward the end of the 30 minutes...I covered mine with tin foil to try and protect it for the last 10 minutes.

This was amazing.  My husband and I both loved it.  I used frozen vegetables, and added chopped onion to give it some extra flavor.  I also added a tablespoon of minced garlic and mixed that in as well.  I would definitely reccomend this recipe to anyone.

SO GOOD! I had been searching for a good pot pie recipe, and I love this one. Admittedly, it isn't a traditional chicken pot pie filling, but it is so delicious and creamy that I don't care. All I did was to cut back on the milk, as I found it a bit runny, and I've experimented with my cheeses. Even better the next day!!

This makes an excellent quick weeknight meal. I add peas, sliced mushrooms, and a bit of rosemary, and I omit the salt.

I made individual pot pies out of this recipe.  The only thing i really changed was omitting the carrot and using crescent rolls on top instead of pie crust.  It looked fantastic, but i was disapointed at the flavor, the gravy tasted like the crm of ckn straight out of the can. i thought it would take on some of the other flavors... next time i'll use much less, maybe half a can of soup and some chicken gravy.  although, presentation in those individual cups is to die for and fun!

I made this using the "Cream Cheese Crust" recipe from this site. I pressed half the dough into a 8x8 casserole dish and rolled the other half in between 2 peices of wax paper. I steamed the brocoli and carrots in a steamer bag, cooked and cut up chicken breasts, then combined with all the other ingredients. Cooked for 30 minutes. It was easy and turned out awesome.

Although I made this in my crock pot, the taste should have been about the same...I found the broccoli over powering. After it was fully cooked I tasted it and wasn't thrilled so I added 1/2 a potato, a sauted onion, a pinch of rosemary, a pinch of sage and a bit of onion powder. I liked it much better afterwards. Then I put it in a corningware w/pastry on top and baked it. Next time I'll omit the broccoli and add other veggies.

I am an amateur cook in every sense of the word.  I made this recipe as is with store-bought pie pastrys and using the exact timings and specifications for the ingredients and it turned out excellent!  I receive compliments every time I make these pies.  Usually I make about 3 at a time for my wife and kids.  They're easily used up by the end of the week.

Yummy!  I used this recipe for my co-op dinner night, so I made 4 8" deep dish pies at once. Actually, I made the filling the night before, then filled the pies the next, put them in the oven and they were done! My measurements were rough, but I used a little less soup and milk than the recipe called for and it still came out great.  I also added garlic salt, but other than that I didn't mess with it. Following other reviewers' advice (and with my previous experience with frozen pie crust) I lowered the temp to 375 and baked for 50 minutes which was perfect. Every kid and parent in the co-op loved it, including my picky daughter. Easy to lower fat content with LF soup and cheese! Thanks, Stephanie!

Fast food with home cooked feel!!!!  Love it!  I took recommendations from others and tried the pillsbury roll out crusts - this was a great suggestion!  I also used frozen veggies and steamed them - a wonderful cheat!  This will be in regular rotation at our house from now on!

We loved this recipe.  We used premade Phillsbury pie crusts and added a few different veggies to break up the brocolli.  I think the key ingredient was the cheese.  Will definitely be making again.

I thought this recipe was great. I did make a variation, which I thought I'd tell people about, because it turned out so awesome. I used two chicken breasts which were seasoned with lemon pepper and it gavve the pot pie a great flavor. I also used a vegetable variety of corn, brocolli, carrots, and red peppers. I have to agree with others comments about the oven temp and time...375 degrees for 45-50 minutes was absolutely perfect. Thanks so much for an awesome pot pie. This one definitely goes in my personal recipe stash. My fiancee raved for hours afterwards!

HOORAY!! I've finally make a pot pie that wasn't bland!! Added some garlic and onion to this one and followed another users advise and topped with cresent rolls. This gave the flakey texture I was looking for. I also used chicken from "Boiled Chicken" , a must- have recipe on this site for pot pies. I'll definately add more chicken next time. Also, does anyone have suggestions for cutting the sodium??? Thanks ;-)

This pie is very nice and easy to make, I made little ones in patty pans and topped with cheese instead of pastry and my 8 year old son liked these better. The 1st time I made these I followed the recipe exactly, the 2nd time I made them in Texas Muffin Pans, I liked those ones better. I used frozen puff pastry.

Love this recipe!!! I added celery and frozen peas, and a layer of extra cheese over the mixture before topping with the crust. I have made this twice and a word of advise. Lower the temp to 400 degrees, and cook a little longer. That worked for me. When I baked at 425 degrees, the inside crust was too gooey. I also make it in a square cassrole dish. A++++

Great, easy and versatile recipe!  Use whatever veggies you have on hand or use frozen melody.  I cut my pastry into small circles and filled a muffin pan; making 12 individual pies with pastry tops. **Be sure to poke holes in the top pastry and line the lower rack with foil because the sauce bubbled all over my oven** I used many dishes preparing fresh veggies, raw chicken and pastry.  I think I will only make this when I have leftover chicken.  Can't wait to make it again!

This was great!! I went a little overboard on the amounts for the ingredients so I had plenty of filling left over. No problem! I just put it in a bowl and ate it! My family devoured this. I used fresh broccoli and carrots that I steamed. I also sauteed chopped chicken breasts in garlic and a little seasoned salt for flavor. Very good!

This was great.  A little different from the traditional pot pie, but very good & so easy.  I made it easier by using canned sliced carrots & frozen broccoli I defrosted first.  Will definately make again.  There were no leftovers!

This is one of those recipes that is easy to make your own. I had leftover grilled chicken thighs and garlic sausage. I only had cream of mushroom soup and has some fresh mushrooms. Less cheese, but lots of fresh cracked pepper and fresh garlic. It was a good, economical meal using what I had on hand.

Excellent!   However, I'm not a fan of "cream of" soups, so I used turkey gravy instead.  The whole family, 4 kids included loved it.

I made this last night and it was fabulous!  It was my first attempt at a pot pie and not only did it look beautiful but tasted wonderful.  My boyfriend even said it was better than the last pot pie he made (and since it is his favorite meal that was a big compliment).  I did use a store bought crust and it was just as good as homemade.

mmm mmm good.  Cut up chicken and boiled in chicken broth and bell seasoning. As suggested I cooked the bottom crust for about 5 mins and did an egg wash on top.  Added salt. pepper and garlic powder to the meat filling.  Yum Yum Yum

Followed recipe to the letter, I just added a potato to the veggie mix being steamed. I pan roasted the chicken breasts with a poultry seasoning, which added a great flavor. End result was delicious!!!

Great recipe!  I used mixed vegatables, broccoli, fresh mushrooms, french fried onion rings crushed, and reduced fat provolone cheese.  I did not add any salt as the soup and cheese has enough for my family.

This recipe is just ok for me, after trying a much better one. The sauce is just not that good, but I guess it's good for a quick dinner, but I've had much better.

I love this easy recipe!  Even my picky boyfriend requested it again!  I'm very happy with the easy ways to customize this recipe-different "cream of" soups, more/less cheese, different vegetables, etc.  We used extra chicken breasts we had grilled the previous night specifically to have for the pot pie the following night.  Very very yummy!

This is very similar to my recipe I use.  I use 1 can of cream of chicken soup, only 1 vegetable (corn usually by Green Giant)1 low fat cream cheese and 1 cup of mozarella cheese on top.  Very fattening but the taste is better than none especially with the cream cheese added.

So good! Not like pot pie that I'm used to, but it's better! My husband even liked it and he doesn't like cheese or cream of whatever soups. I used "Mare's" modifications. Perfect!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the recipe closely but made two small changes.  One, I baked the bottom crust for 8 minutes before adding the filling.  And, two, I added a tsp or so of Nature's Seasoning salt and some fresh ground pepper to the filling mix so it wouldn't be bland.  I always use the No Fail Pie Crust III recipe from this site (substituting 1/2 the flour with whole wheat flour).  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

Yay for this recipe!  Easy, quick, and tasty!  I'm a novice cook and after some bad attempts at other recipes this was a great success!  I used less cheese -- maybe 3/4c -- still great!

This is an excellent recipe if you want something easy that tastes like you cooked all day.  It is also very good the next day as leftovers.  The only things I changed are that I added some different spices that meet our family's tastes and I brushed egg whites on the top crust.

I wasn't expecting much, as I hate the frozen chicken pot pies and that's all I've ever had.  This, on the other hand, was wonderful and even reheated well the next day.  I used a 12.5oz can of chicken, Walmart-brand pie crust rolls, and I steamed a bag of frozen broccoli and a bag of frozen peas, carrots, and green beans.

I loved this and so did my family. I of course made some changes. I used all canned veggies and added corn, peas, and limas. I added some worcestershire and some fresh garlic. I didn't put in the cheese (because I forgot).  It still turned out top of the line wonderful, and I will make it again and again!!

I didn't like the cheese in this. It made the filling kind of slimy. The taste was good, but I couldn't stand the texture. I would try something else for binder and get rid of the cheese next time.

This was very easy to make. This was my very 1st time attempting to make a pot pie, & it turned out great! I just used chicken, corn, & potatoes (my significant other is fussy when it comes to veggies) and it tasted great. I did put aluminum foil around the edges so they didn't get too done. Overall, very good!

This is pretty good for a quick pot pie recipe. I really prefer the ones with chunks of vegies and a thinner gravy, but this was quite good for only taking me 30 mintues to make.

I added some onion, a couple of stalks of celery and one carrot. Before I put the top crust on I sprinkled celery salt (instead of regular salt), pepper and basil. I thought this was awesome, but my family grumbled about it. It was easy enough, however, and is a great recipe.

This was an awesome recipe! I used a store bought pie crust and added some garlic powder, potato chunks and peas. I didn't use fresh produce because I had frozen brocolli florets and a bag of frozen carrot and pea mix. I boiled the potatoes until they were only slightly tender (so that they wouldn't be mush in the pie). I also added about half a cup more of cheese because my husband is a big cheese fan. He absolutely loved it!

This recipe turned out great! I used the Jiffy box mix for the crust and then substituted whatever vegetables I had on hand (potatoes and beans work well). I put it in the oven for 45 minutes at 400. It overflowed a little, but tasted  wonderful.

Loved it!! I prebaked the bottom crust. I used a bag of steamed broccoli and cut up some baby carrots and steamed them in the microwave too. I baked the chicken in the oven with a little olive oil, paprika, onion powder, garlic salt and thyme sprinkled on it. Very good. I would especially recommend this recipe for times when you have leftover turkey or chicken on hand.

This was a tasty and easy meal to make. I used a can of carrots and peas, and a prepared box of frozen broccoli with cheese sauce that you would find in the freezer section. I used one of the reviewer's suggestions and pre-cooked the pie shell (which I bought pre-made) for about 5 minutes before filling. I found that this made enough filling for almost (2) deep-dish pies (I did add an extra chicken breast as well), so I had some leftovers which I put in the freezer and will hopefully be able to use in the future.

This recipe was verrrrrrrrrry gooooooood!! It usually takes my daughter an hour, mostly picking at her food when there are veggies present, I served her a small piece, in case she did'nt like it. She swallowed it, literally, I even asked her if she chewed any of it! ;) She asked for seconds. I will definitely, be making this recipe over, and over again!

Great recipe, very rick and tasty. My kids loved it. I will definately use this recipe again. I added some peas in the recipe as well. It is the only way to get peas in my kids. It was not over powering, and was a nice addition to the recipe. Thanks for a great recipe. : )

This is absolutely fabulous. I have never made pot pie before and wanted one i could use fresh veggies with. I skipped the carrots, but did everything else as written. I use a pie crust i found here. Wonderful so rich and thick.

I used a deep dish pie plate so I pretty much doubled the recipe.  Except I put in extra veggies instead of just the ones listed.  I added a chopped green pepper, two ribs of celery, and half of a large portobello mushroom.  I also used the "Healthy Request" condensed soup (two cans) and 1-1/3 cups milk.  It turned out yummy with the Butter Flaky Pie Crust, but could use a little more salt (I was used to the high sodium chicken soup).

It was good, not great.  I forgot the step of steaming the carrots and broccoli.  So they were a little crisp, but still good.  I did add 1 large potato.  I put mine in a pie crust and covered it with crescent rolls, because I am not much of a pie crust fan.  Good recipe, will make again.

Used carrots and potatoes instead of brocolli. I also used the Butter Flaky Pie Crust (also from this site). IT was excellent. My husband devoured in a day.

Oh my goodness!  This was wonderful!  I am used to the standard chicken pot pie with the canned or frozen mixed vegetables.  I've never thought of using the fresh broccoli and carrots.  I used cream of mushroom soup because it is what I had on hand.  It was absolutely the best.  A definite keeper!

Very good recipe!  My husband commented that this was the best chicken pot pie he has ever had. I added a few ingredients to my steamer on top of the Broccoli and Carrots: Potato, Green Pepper, Onion. I also added ground black pepper to this recipe. Thanks for sharing!!

I didn't steam the veggies long enough, and they were still crunchy after baking. Will not neglect this step next time! I substituted Cream of Mushroom soup for the Cream of Chicken, and it had a great flavor. We all loved it!

Quick, easy, and incredibly delicious!  I substituted a 10 oz. can of chicken and cheddar-flavored veggie shreds and the results were fantastic! Leftovers can be heated in the toaster oven too, a plus.

Quick and yummy! Totally changed this recipe. Can I still review? Lol 9 months pregnant and totally over slaving over the stove. Mixed together 1/2 a bag of Tyson's Grilled and Ready Cubed Chicken (cooked in microwave first), 1/2 can of mixed peas and carrots, 1/2 can of corn, 1/2 small onion, 1 stalk of celery, used 1 can of Cream of Potato rather than the cream of chicken, 2/3 cup of  milk, added the cheese, and seasoned to my liking with garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, pepper, and seasoned salt. Simmered for thickening and taste testing purposes before filling the crust. =) Baked at 425 for 30 minutes. Turned out so so good! Crust was great. Both my 4 year old picky princess and my Honey loved it.

Adding a little fresh tarragon, rosemary and sage leftover from thanksgiving made this recipe 5 stars. I added half a can of cream of mushroom and additional salt was NOT needed. I also prebaked my pie crust. I suggest altering this recipe to serve your tastes and to use up whatever veggies available. I used cooked turkey breast. My hubby and son gobbled it up. Husband really liked the broccoli.

It was definitely comforting and my kids loved it! It would be great if there is a way to make it a little bit healthier. Perhaps making the pie crust with spelt flour?

Changed up the recipe a little when I made it tonight.  Added some chopped celery to add flavor (wish I'd added peas too...next time I guess), and seasoned the chicken with some Peruvian Chile Lime powder from this place (which is local shopping for me): http://www.savoryspiceshop.com/blends/peruvian.html - I seasoned the chicken before throwing it in the skillet to cook, so it absorbed the flavor a bit more.  Seasoning a couple hours before would've made the flavor even stronger, so I'll do that next time.

Next, I added a little bit more salt, and some fresh ground pepper (about a 1/2 teaspoon per pie) and just a little bit of corn starch to thicken up the sauce a little bit.  The pie cooked perfectly at the time/temp in the recipe, so no complaints there!

Overall, I want to make a couple adjustments next time, but it's the tastiest pot pie I've made at home, whereas most of mine are bland.  Next time I'm planning on a bit less pepper and chile lime powder, some peas, and whatever else comes to mind (I want to try to find something to use instead of the condensed soup, so it's healthier).  That said, I'll be making this one again

I had to make my own version of cream of chicken soup, as it is not available here in the Mexican highlands.  I basically made a thick white sauce using chicken stock instead of milk.  We enjoyed the result very much.

We really enjoyed this.  My girls love broccoli and I hadn't used it in a pot pie before but it was a big hit.  I found this to be less fattening than most pot pies that have extra butter added.  Was able to use a low fat cream of celery and it was delicious.

This was SO good!  And easy which makes it that much better.  I altered a few things...bought a box pie crust, added canned corn and canned green beans (along with the carrots - no broccoli).  The only thing I wish is that I would have added maybe an extra half can of the soup.  I like it creamy!  My bf LOVED it.  He went back for seconds and kept raving about it which prompted me to write this review!

Yummy!! I made just a few modifications...

I used two premade 9 inch crusts (Pillsbury brand, I think), a box of frozen veggies with a rosemary sauce, and used reduced fat cream of chicken, skim milk, and half of the cheese to reduce calories. I boiled a chicken breast with Fox Point seasoning (from Penzey's spices) and cubed it before mixing it all together and pouring it into the pan. I also baked the bottom layer of the crust first for about 10 minutes. This turned out fantastic! Thanks for this recipe!

My family loved this, I used some shortcut, roll out crust from the market. I replaced the milk with canned milk which gave the pie an extra richness. I think next time I'll make two and freeze one before cooking.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was very good. It was my first time making a crust from scratch and it was okay. The filling was delicious and the family enjoyed it as well. I will definitely make this one again.

Mmmmmm...I liked this recipe.  I sauted the chicken breast in butter first which adds some fat but it makes it taste sooooo good.  I only used carrots and finely chopped celery.

This is such a versatile recipe. I have made it several times, changed it up and it's always well received. The one thing I do each time is I don't use a bottom crust and usually add some frozen veggies and always diced potatoes. I don't precook anything, just chop smaller. My granddaughter always requests this when she visits. I also use the rolled-up pie crust for the top and it's perfect. Last time I made it I used a deeper dish and it didn't "bubble over."  I don't even look at the recipe any more, just throw it together. Thanks for such a great, change up, recipe.

This recipe is a family favorite!  I too add the Cream of Chicken w/ Herbs soup and HIGHLY recommend it.  It seems to add alot of flavor.  I also microwave 2 baby red potatoes for 2 mins and add those.  This meal is always a hit ... and so easy!

I must have put in too much broccoli, so it wasn't that great.  My husband loved it but my kids didn't. And I like broccoli, but it was just too overpowering.  Other than that, it was just okay. It was easy, so I'd probably still try it in a pinch, but use different veggies.

We really did like this recipe. I would agree to cook this at 375 and cook it for a little longer. I had read the previuos reviews and did this and still needed to cook just a little longer! The cheese in this make it so yummy! Will make again!

This was the best pot pie I have ever made. Even my my husband said that it was the best. I did change some a few things. Instead of cream of chicken, I used cream of celery, and I also did not use 2 pie crusts. I only used a top. It seemed to work much better. I used the homemade pie crust (Flaky Food Processor Pie Crust).

I had this recipe for a while before I made it. I am not a big fan of pot pies, then I had only had the frozen premade kind. I used frozen broccoli, sweetcorn and peas and carrots as well as a frozen pie crust. I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper then used my George Foreman grill to cook it.
It was excellent!

This is great.  My son's and husband loved it.  I did some mixed frozen veggies in it.  Plus I used 1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken with rice soup instead of 1 can condensed cream of chicken soup

still it was great

Great and easy recipe! My husband ate two bowls of it and in his words when I told him what was for dinner "I hate pot pie". He loved this one though! I used frozen broccoli and canned carrots. I went a little overboard with the broccoli this time but next time I'll know better. Other than that, didn't change a thing. Great!!

I’ve been making this one for years now. It’s my husband’s favorite pot pie. I use about half the milk so it doesn’t run all over the plate and let it cook 15 minutes before slicing and serving. You’re going to love it!

Delicious! I made this with baby carrots, broccoli, onion, and celery. Baked the bottom dough for about 7 minutes first so it wouldn’t be soggy then added the ingredients. I added extra cheese, some onion and garlic powder, and thyme. Love this recipe because you can use whatever vegetables you prefer. Baked in the oven at 400 for about 40 minutes. It was so good! Will definitely make again!

It was ok but I won't use store bought pie shells again. Wished it was  more savoury . And it needed more `sauce`. It just needs tweaked a little bit

I made this exactly as directed my family and guests enjoyed it. I personally think it was a touch too cheesy for chicken pot pie. I will definitely make this again with just a little less cheese.

This is one of those recipes that you always need on standby when you have leftovers... just chop up veggies or dump the bag stuff in a bowl and go for it.  You can vary it as little or as much... I used leftover chicken tenders and fresh veggies.  I took the advice of one reviewer and topped it with bisquik mix. Lowered it to 325 in a convection and cooked away... awesome.

This is my absolute favorite go-to! It is super simple to make and super delicious. I sometimes like to add some potatoes or cauliflower just to add some more chunk. Sometimes I'll double up and make a couple pies to portion throughout the week. It saves really well. Yum!!!

This is a great quick and easy pot pie recipe to toss together. I used cream of bacon soup and mini diced potatoes instead of carrots. It's still not as great as a pot pie made more from scratch but I loved that I was able to toss it together after work.

Everyone loved this, even the ones that don't like vegetables.  It was a big hit and I was asked to make it again, but next time make two.  I'm going to make some small ones and freeze them for my husbands lunches.

After looking at other reviews, I made several additions to this recipe. I added 1 baked potato, 1 celery stalk, an extra can of soup, and 3-4 T of melted butter to the sauce. I added some pepper and garlic salt. I baked the crusts alone for a few minutes before filling. Baked at 375 for 45 min. We loved it and I will definitely make it again!

I followed other suggestions & seasoned my chicken while I cooked it & added garlic powder to the veggies.  I added 1 stalk of celery too.  I used Golden Mushroom condensed soup b/c I had it on hand & my hubby said it was the best Chix Pot Pie he's ever had!

I rated this four stars because the flavor was really good. However, it was extremely runny, so the next time I make this, I will incorporate some cornstarch with it.

As one othere commenter did, I substituted a bag of frozen mixed veg for the other veg in the recipe.  I still like it and my husband, who doesn't like pot pies, said I should definitely make it again....  That's a practically glowing review!!!

The best!!!  So easy and freezes well!  I doubled the recipe to make two and added mushrooms, peas and celery(next time I will add potato as well)I also added one can of cream of broccoli soup because I had added so many extras to it.  Everyone I have passed this on or served this to has gone crazy over it!  it's a keeper!!

Made this tonight . Really yummy .  I left out the broccoli,  used chicken thighs, carrots & peas, & added potatoes. Now it's time to try it in smaller containers - it was too much for just two of us.

Simple & delicious. I used Heart Healthy cream of mushroom soup which had much less sodium.

Made this for me and my boyfriend over the weekend, and it was a big hit!  I added some green onions and put extra cheese and a bit more milk with it, but only because I cooked so much broccoli and carrots and was concerned there might not be enough moisture.  Serves more like four, but I will make this again, sooner than later!  Takes a little more time to make than indicated, but really not bad at all. :)

I saute a bag of mixed frozen vegetables in butter for 10mins. Add flour stirring well cook 2 mins stirring constantly. Combine ck both & half&half instead of milk, gradually stir into skillet of veggies. Cook till thickens. Add chicken.  Then put into a casserole dish that is lined with one pie crust. Then add an another pie crust on top. I cut the pie crust to fit casserole dish. Bake 400 40mins. My family loves it

I made this for the first time tonight. Family loved it. I put peas in instead of broccoli. I am not sure why one reviewer didn't think it didn't serve 6. I had two helpings my daughter did as well my husband 3 big helpings and my other daughter had one and still have a good size portion left. It filled us up and my husband wants it in the rotation.

This is a good start, but I changed a few things.  I sautéed carrots and onions.  Added mushrooms with broccoli.  For the sauce I added thyme leaves, garlic and onion powder for flavor and quite a bit of pepper. Mixed in a bunch of monterey jack cheese.  I put puff pastry on with a few vent holes and egg washed for a beautiful golden brown crust.  Baked at 400 for about 30 minutes.  Family enjoyed it very much.

I've tried at least 5 other chicken pot pie recipes and this absolutely is the best hands down.  I seasoned my chicken with Chef Paul Prudhomme's Poulty Magic (it's magical!).  I also just used a bag of frozen mixed vegetables to make life easier.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  My son (13 yrs old) adored this and was licking his bowl, literally.  Leftovers tend to sit in our fridge until finally thrown out and the leftovers for this dish were gone in record speed.  Also, I'm a working mom, so I did all the prep the night before and had it wrapped in the fridge ready to go.  I was able to pop it in the oven and go about my busy life until the oven beeped and dinner was ready.

A great recipe for pot pie.  With a little prep the night before, it was easy to assemble and cook after I came home from work the next day.  Used turkey and the green beans that were leftover from Sunday dinner, microwaved some broccoli added cream of chicken and mushroom soup and followed the recipe.  I did use Pillsbury pie crusts and it was given a thumbs up by all.

Great recipe! I've made it twice now. The crust I have used is on this site (Mom's pie crust for double crust) absolutely no problems with sogginess in using it for this recipe. I add a tsp of poultry seasoning, pinch of garlic powder and some seasoning salt. Also this time put a little cauliflower in it. I find it's a great way to use up my left-over roasted chicken (which I cook once a wk). Thanks for the recipe! My 3yr old daughter 
and husband love it!

I took the other reviews advise and baked at 375 for 45-50 minutes.  I didn't have cream of chicken so I used cream of mushroom and added 4 oz of chopped fresh mushrooms.  I didn't measure the cheese but probably did not use an entire cup.  My husband actually helped me make it and he thinks it was so easy he could make it by himself next time.  Looking forward the leftovers tomorrow night!

This was so yummy!  I added way more cheese than it called for (I love cheese) and I think next time I will add more chicken.  I love that you can use almost any vegetables with it.  Definitly a keeper!

This recipe is wonderful & great to eat on a cold night. I didn't us broccoli
because of picky kids.  Instead, I used 1 med. potatoe-chopped, 3/4 cup of carrots, 1 stalk celery, & some left over green beans. The cheese really adds to the flavor.  It turned out great!!!  Thanks for a nice tasty dish!!!

This worked great. I doubled the recipe and froze the second pie for later. To make it even easier, I made them with pre-made pie crusts from the grocer's freezer. I used a combination of Bisquick and milk to create the top crust of the pie. Just put enough milk in to create a dough and roll it out. Very easy and visually very pretty.
