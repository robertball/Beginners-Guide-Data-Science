This recipe is very delicious.  I made some minor alternations that made a big difference.  I used Italian breadcrumbs and mixed in a dash of garlic powder, salt, pepper and cayenne. I am very diet-conscious, so I completely eliminated the use of butter.  Instead of buttering the pan, i placed a cooling rack in the bottom of the 9x13 pan and lightly coated it with cooking spray.  Instead of adding a pad of butter on top of the chicken, I lightly misted them with I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Spray.  Since the chicken was not saturated with butter and because it was elevated with the use of the cooling rack, the chicken was crunchy all around, rather than soggy on the bottom.  Very delicious flavor, though.  My family loved the zippiness of the lemon yogurt.

This recipe is a wonderful one for chicken breasts; I did a little change to the original recipe, though: I added a little bit more lemon juice to the yogurt than what was called for, I marinated chicken for 6+ hours in the yogurt mixture and seasoned plain dried bread crumbs by myself. The results were perfect: I ended with tender lemony chicken breasts, seasoned just the way I like them. I didn't wait 5 to 10 minutes before serving (kitchen smelled too good to let this chicken sit that long).

This was quite delicious. The chicken stays tender and juicy and the flavor of the lemon garlic yogurt is just right. I put fresh pressed garlic into the yogurt as opposed to garlic salt. I also used fresh cilantro instead of parsley. The hard part was coating the chicken -- the crumbs became lumpy after two breasts. I think next time I will sprinkle coat the breasts instead.

Very moist chicken. I cut up the chicken breasts and marinated for one hour. I used panko bread crumbs seasoned with my favorite cajun seasonings and garlic salt. Turned out perfect. One hour was just right. The only thing I missed was a dipping sauce! This recipe just calls for it. I like to cut a piece and dip. Found one on this site that has a Thai sweet and sour sauce.

Great jumping off point.  To tenderize the chicken a bit, I actually cut it into tenders and marinated it the yogurt (Greek, non fat), garlic (fresh), lemon juice, and 1/4 tsp of celery salt and 1/2 tsp of onion powder.  After about 10 hrs in the fridge, I dipped the tenders in panko (seasoned with cayenne, paprika, salt, onion powder, garlic salt and pepper) baked them for 15 mins on one side, 10 mins on the other side (350 degrees) and then put them under the broiler for about 2-3 mins to crisp them up.  They turned out GREAT! And there was no need for the extra fat and calories of the butter (although I'm sure it taste good with it!)  Thanks, Twila

This is a really yummy chicken dish! I made it with cut up chicken pieces (half a chicken for this amount of coating) which is alot cheaper than breasts. I peeled off the skin and threw it away so it would be less fat but you don't need it anyway, the yogurt does the trick to keep it very moist. This will definitley be a regular at my house.

This was a nice recipe, but nothing spectacular. I encountered the same "problem" I have with all chicken recipes that don't require marinades--the outside of the chicken is very tasty, but the inside is bland because none of the coating reaches the meat underneath. However, this recipe was quick and easy to prepare, and the coating was crunchy and flavorful, so I would make it again. I served the chicken with the "Baked Mac and Cheese for One" recipe on this site--it all made a very nice, comforting fall meal.

whoops - I accidentally made this with vanilla yogurt instead of plain yogurt and it was STILL good. However, I certainly don't recommend this as a recipe modification :0)

Will make again using plain yogurt or even a prepared tzatziki.

The chicken was very moist and came out nicely.  Next time I will add more lemon and more garlic as I felt the chicken needed a bit more flavor.  But this recipe is a keeper!  Very easy.

Excellent recipe. I modified the recipe by marinating the chicken 
for one hour and then using cornbread stuffing instead of bread 
crumbs. I also used crushed garlic (about 2 teaspoons) instead of the 
garlic powder.

I loved this recipe!  I followed some of the other reviews and marinated the chicken for about an hour and also used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I also used a little less butter and sprayed the baking dish with olive oil instead.  Great dinner and used the leftovers for lunch, too.

My students really loved this recipe. Make sure you only have a very thin coating of yogurt otherwise the breading will become gummy and not crisp.

I had plain bread crumbs so I added a little Italian seasoning to the mix. Next time I would use the thinner chicken filets so there is more flavor compared to the amount of chicken.

This is really good. I added fresh garlic to the yogurt/lemon mix and  marinated the chicken breasts overnight. Very tasty indeed. 

Not as good the next day, but still pretty good.

Delicious. Use real garlic and marinate 3 hours before cooking for a deeper flavour. I used japanese (panko) bread crumbs and I had no problems with lumps. I added a handful of grated Parmesan cheese to the breadcrumb mix and the finished product was fantastic. Will remember this recipe next time I have friends over for dinner.

I liked the recipe, however, next time I will make a change.  The chicken breasts I used were fresh and pretty thick and therefore only the outside edges got the lemony yogurt flavor.  Next time, I'm going to cut the chicken into tender size pieces and follow the coating and bread crumbs, so that more of the lemony yogurt flavor can be tasted in each bite.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I made a couple of modifications: added cumin and a dash of tumeric to the yogurt and lemon juice. It added a nice spice to it and an added bonus was the chicken underneath the crumb crust was yellow, hinting at the lemon flavor. I followed other's advice and let it marinate for an hour. I didn't have bread crumbs so used Ritz crackers. It needed a couple minutes underneath the broiler to crisp up the crust.

This was so simple!  Like another reviewer, I also have a little baby at home, so I've been looking for easy, inexpensive, quick recipes that are also delicious.  That's usually hard to find, but this is a keeper!

I was looking for something easy to make with what I had on hand and made this tonight and didn't have any leftovers!  I didn't have a lemon so I used an orange for the juice.  I also used garlic croutons instead of bread crumbs because it was what I had on hand.  All I had was Greek yogurt and it worked nicely.  I followed a few other suggestions and marinated in the yogurt mixture for a couple of hours before baking and the chicken was so tender!  This will definitely be added to the list of dinners we have regularly!

Very good. I seasoned my own breadcrumbs, which is important, because it's where most of the flavor comes from. I think I will try keeping the chicken slightly frozen so it will come out more moist. It was pretty moist, but I think I could do better.

This made a moist chicken breast with a nice crispy coating. Next time I think I will add some of the lemon zest as well and maybe a bit more seasoning. Needed a little "something" more (just my tastebud's opinion!).  Everyone enjoyed it. Thank you for the recipe!

I had high hopes for this recipe. I marinated the chicken in the yogurt & lemon for several hours like others had stated, used garlic & herb seasoned bread crumbs, and added salt, garlic powder, and pepper. It turned out somewhat bland anyway. I may try it 1 more time with buttermilk instead of yogurt and find better bread crumbs.

This chicken was so easy yet delicious and moist! My husband and I couldn't stop saying how yummy it was. I use Italian bread crumbs and added 2 tsp of paprika, 3 minced garlic and didn't have to add salt. I like others put the chicken on the rack and placed a baking sheet under the rack to catch the dripping.  The chicken turned out crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside, and super tasty.

This chicken recipe was very tasty: moist, flavorful, & tender, & the whole family liked it. That being said, however, I modified the recipe which I really don't like doing the 1st time I make. I substituted olive oil for the butter because I try to be very conscious of saturated fats & reduced the baking time to 40 minutes, &, as I said, it turned out great!

I thought for the first go at this with no tweaks, the recipe was great and can be built upon. I used greek yogurt and only 3 chicken breasts. It definitely needs a roasting rack of sorts if you want crispy chicken over all. The bottoms were soggy, but not a turn off. Next time, I'll do the ziploc bag idea from below and let the chicken hang out in there for some extra tangy flavor. I also would add some seasoning to the yogurt mixture like dill or lemon pepper. I'm sure chicken that is pounded to just under a half-inch thickness would make it have good flavor throughout the chicken, not just the outermost parts. I'm keeping this recipe and plan on playing around with it. Bet it would go great on a firm fish, too! Thanks for sharing!

So good and SO EASY! I usually put the chicken in the yogurt/lemon juice mixture in a Ziploc and leave it in the fridge for a few hours. Then just use herb bread crumbs so you don't need the parsley or garlic powder. My husband loves this...we have it a couple of times a month.

This recipe was a hit with me and my husband!  I followed some of the other review advice and marinated the chicken for a couple hours and also added fresh garlic instead of the garlice salt.  I also only cooked them for 45 minutes.  They turned out tender and very flavorful.

This was great!  I used a greek yogurt because it is thicker and thought it would stick better.  When I bought the yogurt I noticed they had lemon greek yogurt so may try that next time.  I also baked on a cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet as another reviewer suggested so the bottoms get nice and crunchy too.  It was fabulous!  I will make again and again!

It was delicious. The kids enjoy when I make "nuggets" by cutting the chicken into chunks before. I used a pretzel crust as we like that extra crunch and bit of salty. Just throw them in the food processer to get a fine mix. I used greek yogurt and added a little garlic extra lemon to the mix for some extra tang. Yummmm.

Hmmm…. Mine didn’t come out like the picture and it wasn’t very crunchy. But it was still good. I think I put too much yogurt because the side of the chicken that touched the pan the crust was super moist and came off the chicken. I added some shredded cheese on top of the cutlets to add flavor. It was tangy and different!

Oh my I actually LOVED this! The lemon gave the chicken such a tasty zesty flavor & the yogurt was SO good, the chicken turned out moist & flavorful. My boyfriend really liked it. : ) I am adding this one to my recipe box to make again. Note: I followed the instructions to a 'T' my only small addition was 2 lemons and I tossed two cloves of crushed up garlic into the pan with the chicken & butter so they all baked together. The chicken was really flavorful! THANKS!!!

The recipe is a great quick recipe. I used Italian breadcrumbs instead of mixing the seasonings to the plain bread crumbs. It was great in taste and very tender.

What an quick, easy way to make great chicken!  I followed the recipe, and sprinkled fresh garlic on top....delicious!   I have a 1 month old baby, so my time is very limited and this was a true time-saver.  I'll be making this a lot in the future!

I was in a hurry.  I cut my chicken into strips and skipped to butter.  Kept all ingredients the same.  This was a refreshing change.  I will do it again. Next time I will live my pan with foil for easy clean up.  Thank you for the recipe.

I made this with a few small variations. I used nonfat Greek yogurt, Italian bread crumbs and used Olivio buttery spray. 
This was very good and a nice variation to have for a chicken meal.

Having the chicken in marinade first provides a lovely intense flavour. Baking time is perfect for moistly cooked chicken.

This recipe yields just "okay" chicken. The lemon and yogurt did add nice flavor, but an hour was too long to cook the chicken. Turned out quite dry. A little too plain for me. Suggest adding spices to the bread crumbs and could really use a sause served with it.

This recipe is fantastic! I followed it exactly, except I used chicken tenders instead of breasts. I also followed the advice of the reviewer who put the chicken on a roasting rack to allow the bottom to get crisp. For five tenders it took only 30 minutes in the oven. Served it with a curry chickpea salad and topped the chicken with just a dollop of mango chutney. Flavors were perfect!!!

My husband could not stop raving about how moist this chicken turned out! I used panko breadcrumbs instead of regular breadcrumbs because I enjoy the light texture. I also find that they have a tendency to stay crispier. I seasoned the breadcrumbs with paprika, black pepper, salt and a bit of onion powder. I also tossed in some dried parsley flakes. The taste was great! I think the chicken breasts I used were too large - next time I may try this as strips or will pound the breasts thinner for an even more flavorful meal. Great recipe!

This recipe is so yummy!  The chicken always turns out so moist.  When cooking, I usually add some onions or broccoli in the pan around the chicken to be cooked in the extra yogurt that drips down.  Very nice!

Gave this recipe a try because of all the positive reviews.  Unfortunately we really didn't care for it.  It was way too "tangy" to suit our tastes.  It wasn't inedible but there are lots of other ways to cook chicken breasts that we like better!

I used to make a recipe similar to this, but it called for mayonnaise instead of  yogurt.  I haven't made it in a while because I don't usually keep mayo on hand (we don't eat it on anything else).  This recipe is BETTER using the yogurt.  It's delicious and EASY.  Thanks for posting it.

This was pretty good.  It wasn't as crispy as I had hoped, but about as good as it gets for oven-baked.  It was very tender.  The yogurt-lemon combination sounds weird at first, but I think it tastes like buttermilk.  For oven-fried nuggets, this is a good pick for the whole family.

This turned out really well. I used chicken breasts that had the bone in and I used Greek yogurt. Other than that, followed recipe. Lemon juice gives it a little tang.

I think this is one of the yummiest chicken recipes ever!
My family loves it and I find I look forward to making it again, and make it often! I make a lot of recipes with my teenaged daughter and we both enjoy cooking this one too (fun).
I found the reviews very helpful. If I remember, I marinate the chicken in the yoghurt mixture ahead of time..I poke holes in the chicken with a knife too before putting in the yoghurt mixture. It's still delicious even if you don't have time to marinate first.
I also took Martha's advice to put the chicken on a cooling rack coated lightly with cooking spray instead of right on the bottom of a pan (though I still put a tiny bit o' butter on top), and it did make a big difference. The chicken did end up nice and crunchy all over. 
For the breadcrumbs, we make our own the old fashioned way..break up bread I've saved and manually crush it into tiny pieces (not fine crumbs but tiny bits) then we season it. I think it might contribute to why our coating turns out so lovely (not sure).
This recipe is a winner ..the lemony yoghurt is such a great flavor, and this one is definitely a part of my family's regular rotation now!

My husband and the 3 kids eating it loved it, my best friend and I did not like it at all. He said it reminded him of lemon pepper chicken (I had to add pepper on his since he eats it on everything) - it didn't seem to improve the flavor much for me. Granted mine came out quite mushy (although I cooked it for what I thought was entirely too long.) It was juicy but lacking flavor for me.

Both my boyfriend and I did not like this recipe. It had a strange taste to to it. I used a low fat yogurt that had artificial sweetener so that may have contributed, but even still I wont make this again :(

Delicious & simple!  It's a recipe that will please just about anyone.   The only thing I do differently, is use lemon flavored yogurt instead of plain yogurt.  I still add the lemon juice to it, it gives it a little stronger flavor.  Thanks so muc for sharing the recipe!

This was pretty good.  I didn't have a lemon and so used lemon juice - 1/4 cup.  However, I think that was too much.  It was a bit too lemony...and I'm a lemon lover!  Next time, I think I would use 1 or 2 tablespoons.  I will say that the dish was very pretty when it came out of the oven.

Excellent recipe. I loved the tang from the lemon juice and the smoothness of the yogurt. I used crushed corn flakes instead of bread crumbs for extra crunch and followed other reviewers' suggestions of baking on a cooling rack placed on a cookie sheet.

This was really good and very simple to make. I made the following modifications. I used crushed saltine crackers in place of bread crumbs. I then added sea salt, lemon pepper, rosemary, basil, oregano, and parsley to the crushed crackers. I added minced garlic to the yogurt mix, and to cut down on fat I used cooking spray and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray in place of the butter. I served it with risotto and asparagus, and it made a great meal.

I love how easy this recipe is! The lemon, yogurt & bread crumb coating added a lot of flavor and kept the chicken breasts very moist. It didn't make much sense to me to use low-fat yogurt, but then a 1/4 of butter, though. I used plain Greek yogurt (full fat) and skipped the butter.  I sprayed the pan and tops of the chicken lightly with an olive oil cooking spray. I only had plain bread crumbs, so I added a lot of Italian seasoning to them. Will definitely make this again!

Fantastic recipe!  My toddler ate a whole breast!!!  He is hard to please and loved the chicken!  However, I did modify the recipe slightly by using greek yogurt and panko bread crumbs!  We added a little greek seasoning to the chicken too!  It was very tender and juicy with a nice crunch on the outside!  Try it ~~~ you'll like it!  If you have a toddler, start cooking now!

Very good & the chicken turned out super moist.  The changes I made were minimal - used plain bread crumbs (used what I had around), opted for dried parsley (again, using what I had) & added in a bit of chili powder for some zing.  My only complaint is that 16oz if yogurt was waaaayyyy too much & felt like alot of it went to waste.  Thank you for sharing this recipe though; loved how simple it was and look forward to experimenting with different herbs & spices.  :)

Very yummy! The chicken was really moist and delicious. I only had unseasoned bread crumbs, so I seasoned them with some cajun spices. It turned out great. I do recommend cooking them on a wire rack if you want them more crunchy. In a glass dish, the undersides became a little soggy but they were still really good.

The flavor was delicious! I marinated in the yogurt mixture (adding fresh garlic) for a couple hours before. Then I cooked it for 45 min and it was completely done. Could maybe have cooked a little less even. The breading on the bottom completely detached from the chicken and stayed in the pan though which was a little disappointing. The cooling rack trick might solve that.

I felt this was really tasty but not as crispy as I expected. Did I coat it with too much yogurt ?  I marinated the chicken overnight with lemon garlic marinade...followed the recipe but the coating didn't get crispy at all. Best thing I could do was broil it at the end to try to get it a little crispy... BUT the flavor was good...

Great recipe.  Very lemony and moist.  As per previous advice, I marinated the chicken in the yoghurt (which I also added fresh crushed garlic too) for a few hours.   I think this made it extra flavourful.

Delicious. The yogurt/lemon mixture gave it a nice yet subtle tang. I used chicken thighs (much prefer), and also added some parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes to the bread crumb mixture. It still needed a little more kick, so I will add more pepper flakes next time.

I took advice from others and cut the chicken breasts in half, added a little extra lemon juice, marinated for an hour, dredged them in Italian breadcrumbs with extra garlic and baked it on a rack for 40 minutes. It came out very moist and the crust was crispy. It was a little bland for us, so I will add more garlic and lemon next time. I will definitely do this again. very quick and very good!

oh man! my picky boyfriend said to add this one to the repertoire ;) i marinated the chicken in the yogurt mixture overnight instead of putting it right in the oven and i think that helped the garlic flavor really meld with the yogurt (especially since i used fresh garlic instead of powder). the only other things i did differently were adding less butter and doing it at the very end (last 5 minutes); and cooking it for 50 minutes instead of an hour (i let it rest under foil for 15 minutes). served it with zucchini and quinoa and it was a filling, healthy, tasty meal. thanks for this recipe!

When my granddaughters were toddlers we made a variation of this. My two year old would roll the chicken tenders in yogurt and her 3 year old sister would roll these in a mix of Italian bread crumbs and parmesan cheese. You do have to be careful that they don't put their hands in their mouths but I found out that they eat much better when they share in the preparation. While the chicken was baking they would tear lettuce and mix a salad.  Both of the girls are now grown and are excellent cooks.

Absolutely delicious and super easy. Everyone loved it, from my teenager to my 83-year-old mother. It's definitely going to go into our regular dinner rotation.

A nice chicken recipe -- I used a little bit of pepper and added the parsley to the yogurt mixture. I used margarine so I'm not sure if that made a difference, but I don't think adding the pat of margarine on the top of the breasts helped to make the crumbs crispier. I also added some lemon juice to the breasts once they were on my plate, and I used nonfat greek yogurt. Good recipe, and I would make this again!

This was a great recipe! The chicken is very tasty and moist. Like previous reviewers, I changed a few things and did not use any butter. I seasoned the bread crumbs myself and spiced it up with thyme and cayenne pepper. I also cooked on a raised rack, so the breasts did not stick to the bottom of the pan. This is my son's favorite way to eat chicken and I have tried a few different recipes and variations of it, but he thinks this is, by far, the best of all. Enjoy!

Great family-friendly recipe! I didn't have any bread crumbs so I crushed flake cereal and it worked just fine.  The lemon flavor was great in the chicken (I let it marinate about 6 hours) and I added a bit more garlic, pepper and minced onion for added flavor. Little messy, but it's worth it!

This was yummy. I used Greek yogurt and took the advice to put a rack under the chicken so it crisp all around and some lemon zest in the yogurt sauce. Will surely repeat this again..

I will admit, I was a little hesitant when I first came across this recipe. I wasn't sure how it would turn out. However, it was excellent! I made the mistake another reviewer did and used vanilla yogurt. It was still good, just gave the chicken a weird zing of sweetness. Next time I'll be sure to use plain yogurt (and add a bit more garlic powder), but either way, this recipe is definitely a keeper!

This was pretty yummy. The yogurt keps the chicken very moist. I used oats instead of bread crumbs for a bit healthier approach. I served this with sauteed asparagus and garlic. Good solid recipe.

Very moist and tasty.  The yogurt added a little tangy touch.  I sprayed the bread crumb topping with butter flavored cooking spray to cut down on the fat from the pats or butter.  I would make this again because it was so easy and experiment with adding different spices.

Easy to make, very tasty, nice crunchy texture (as made with panko bread crumbs.)   The on the bottom side of each slice did stick to the pan.  That was a minor drawback.

I came across this recipe because I was searching for something I could make with the few ingredients I had at home: Chicken breasts, plain yogurt, lemon, and breadcrumbs. Well, I didn't technically have breadcrumbs, so I took a couple pieces of bread and lightly toasted and crumbled them. I pretty much stuck to the recipe, but upon seeing other who mentioned it's best to marinate the chicken in the yogurt sauce, I chose to do that. So it marinated for probably a couple of hours and then I put it all together. I forgot to season the bread crumbs, so I just sprinkled some basil and salt on top of the crust. I served this with zucchini noodles that were sauteed with butter, salt, and pepper. My husband said it tasted great, and he can be kind of picky! Will definitely make this again and try some variations.

I made a single chicken breast and only cooked for 30 minutes; can go shorter. Wish I could taste the lemon more. Might try panko next time to get more crunch as regular bread crumbs fell off or were soggy. Worth trying again with a few tweaks.

This chicken turned out so moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside! I used a few squirts of mustard in the yogurt, because I do not care for lemon chicken. It turned out perfectly after an hour!

Really good. Plus versitle. Although I love cooking with yogurt, I didn't have any so I used a sour cream and mayo combo, marinating the chicken in this while I prepared the other items. I also used crushed oval butter crackers (instead of bread crumbs) with a little dry Italian dressing mix added for seasoning. (I think crushed seasoned croutons would work well too.) I sprayed the pan and then the chicken tops  with butter flavored spray before sprinkling on the parsley. I did cut each breast half into 3 or 4 chunks so it would cook faster. We liked this meal and will add it to our rotation. I appreciated that this recipe did not call for dipping in egg, saving time and a messy step in the prep. I think the beauty is being able to adapt easily to different seasonings and coatings. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a very tasty way to make chicken. Instructions were so simple, I had my husband put everything together. This was a hit! The chicken was very tender and flavorful.

Not one of my favorites but I think it was my fault. I didn't like the vanilla yogurt I used. I also added french onion soup mix to the yogurt mixture which was not a good idea either. I should have added that to the bread crumbs. I did use my toaster oven grate under the pan and it did turn out great. I also didn't add the butter because I didn't think it needed extra fat.

This is a great recipe!  I will make this often.  Mine didn't turn out crunchy -- maybe because I used greek yogurt.  I will use regular yogurt next time and see if I get another result.  Regardless, it was very good.

Added some extra spices to the bread crumb mixture but otherwise followed the recipe. It was moist and delicious. Will definitely make again.

I think this is simple and delicious. I buy the cheapest plain yogurt I can find and Greek works fine too. You can use any kind of bread crumbs and spices you like; the possibilities are endless.

Not bad.  Could have used more salt.  Should have put some Parmesan cheese with the bread crumbs, fresh garlic.

Loved this recipe! I did swap the bread crumbs for a healthier alternative; rolled oats which I pulsed in my processor till they formed into a crumb like texture. I found coating it with butter made the bottom stick and not crisp up like the top. Still amazing! Just would not put butter on it again

Really good flavor.  I used Greek yogurt and Italian bread crumbs.  Came out a little dry, but I think my chicken breasts were small.  I'll adjust accordingly next time.

Very good and can be Gluten free by using GF crushed crackers in place of bread crumbs. BUT DO NOT RINSE CHICKEN! Most cooks are now saying it is not safe. Rinsing can cause cross contamination of bacteria. Other than that, nice recipe.

This was EXCELLENT!  I used half a lime instead of a lemon since that was all I had.  I also used Panko Bread Crumbs instead of regular.  Will definitely make this again!

Made this with crushed matzo vs breadcrumbs, lots of spices, and 1/2 C of flat leaf parsley over the top. I put butter under the chicken, but none over.

It was a hit!  Pleasant, mild flesh, with a complex interesting coating. The lemon-yogurt cut down some of the spiciness.

I was afraid I wouldn't like the yogurt and lemon juice coating, but I loved it! This is such delicious, moist chicken. I give it 4 stars but only because the recipe calls for regular bread crumbs instead of Italian style which lend much more flavor.

This was really delicious! I followed other suggestions as well as made changes because we were out of certain ingredients. Here is what I changed:
* doubled recipe and used 3lbs of chicken breasts but cut them down to smaller pieces
* used 1 cup of italian breadcrumbs and 1 cup of crushed Ritz crackers (because we ran out of breadcrumbs)
* added some parmesan cheese, garlic salt + garlic powder and italian seasoning to breadcrumb mixture to give it more flavoring
* melted butter in bottom of baking dish but did not add butter on top of chicken to make it healthier
* marinated chicken in yogurt/lemon mixture all day before baking
* did not sprinkle parsley over top of chicken (we didn't have any)

Loved it!  Used greek yogurt and omited the parsley and it was still great! We like our chicken a little drier (and out bread crust a little browner) than this recipe allows, so I baked it at 400 for the last 10 minutes. Definatly a family fave!

I used low fat plain Greek yogurt and Italian seasoned panko crumbs.  I cooked some chicken on a rack with no butter and some with a small shaving of butter underneath on foil with no rack.  All the chicken was delicious and moist but the pieces with the butter browned much better. I would use the butter again next time. Just a tiny bit of butter is all that is needed. I was amazed at how the chicken breasts did not shrink after an hour of cooking due to the moisture being locked in.

I didn't have a lemon so I substituted an orange.  Gave it a great flavor. I should have listened to others and put it on a rack.   The breading was a little too soggy and not as crispy as I would have liked.

Very moist chicken, we loved it. Glad I took other reviewers advice and cooked for 30 minutes. Would have been dry if cooked longer.  I found the bottom was soggy, so will try it on a rack next time.

Not what I expected. Not crispy at all! Perhaps the yogurt makes the chicken too moist? I tried not to coat them too much. I used legs and thighs instead breasts, as well as seasoned crackers crumbs, these changes may have been part of the reason the recipe didn't work too well. It tasted fine, but the lack of crispiness was a major turn-off. Worth another try some time (maybe).

My hubby (Who loves breaded chicken) told me "Don't ever make this again!" He hated it! The kids and I could eat it, but didn't like it! I thought with all the high reviews that this would be really good! Sorry!
