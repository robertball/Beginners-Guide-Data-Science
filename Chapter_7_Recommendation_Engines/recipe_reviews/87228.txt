Very good basic shrimp salad. Make sure all ingredients are dry. I cut mayo to 1/2 cup, added a tblsp. of lemon juice, and used sweet vidalia onion. I seasoned with Old Bay Seafood seasoning for an extra zing. Chilled VERY well and served on bed of butter lettuce and baby spinach with crusty whole wheat rolls on the side (and corn on the cob from the garden!). Thanks for a nice recipe.

Really great recipe - I took other user's ideas and cut the shrimp, dried the shrimp well before mixing.  I also substituted 1/2 the mayo with sour cream and a tsp of horseradish sauce for some extra kick and used green onionsinstead of white onion.  Added some cilantro and a dash of balsamic vinegar. Excellent results!

This was good... I only gave it three stars because I used frozen shrimp, and I suspect that they weren't thawed and drained adequately because the salad ended up being too runny/watery. If you use frozen shrimp, make sure they are fully thawed and dried!

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it!
An important tip I don't see mentioned was after the carrot was shredded I squeezed out the excess moisture.  I added an extra egg and used green onions instead.  I didn't see much water drained with the shrimp and I left the mixture overnight.  I like celery, so next time I would increase the dosage.

This was YUMMY!  I used fresh shrimp and made sure to chop them up and dry them prior to putting them in the bowl.  I also used 3 hard boiled eggs since we like those and used just a few organic green onions instead of the regular onions.  We were out of regular mayo so I used Miracle Whip.  After tasting it, I also thought it needed a bit of a kick.  So I mixed in about 1/2 tsp. of half sharp paprika from Penzeys.  That did the trick!  Served on croissants.  Everyone loved it and we will be making this every time shrimp goes on sale.

Perfect for spring, perfect for a Friday night during Lent, perfect for a light lunch or supper.  I just think it's perfect! The recipe is just fine as written, but I used it as a springboard to personalize it to my own tastes.  I added a little extra egg and less carrot.  I used green onion rather than regular onion - it adds color and it doesn't linger with you hours after.  I added some green peas just for fun and I particularly liked that addition.  I cut the mayo half and half with sour cream adding just enough to hold the salad together and make it creamy.  I gave it a squeeze of lemon and a few shakes of dill.  Nutritious, fresh, light, delicious and "shrimple." (I couldn't help myself...)

I am the person who submitted this recipe.  I have read through the posted comments and am pleased to see the majority of the people who tried it...liked it.  My mother created this recipe as she was very fond of "shrimp salad sandwiches" and preferred to  taste the shrimp, NOT to have it overpowered by other ingredients or seasonings.  So, to those who like it, you have my blessings and I hope you continue to enjoy it for years to come.........

Good combination of ingredients.  I think there was a little to much mayo.  Next time I will add a little less.

This was pretty good, I think it could use a little more flavor, and the onion was maybe a bit too much.  I served it over a big bed of mixed greens.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made it for four people and ate it to myself in one sitting!  The mayonnaise was not overpowering like many recipes and the celery gave it a good crunch.  Great!

Maybe it was just my onion, but the "bite" of raw onion in this was too strong for me.  Next time, I'll try reducing the amount of onion and putting in another egg instead.  Very tasty otherwise!

This recipe has too much mayo. The dressing shouldn't be the most important ingredient. It should just bind the rest of the ingredients together. I've made this recipe for over 40 years, and use less than a 1/4 of a cup of mayo. Don't be tempted to use canned shrimp. That will produce and different taste than fresh shrimp. Also good with fresh crab, tuna, salmon pieces (either cured or leftovers from a salmon dinner). I prefer green onions in mine. Less of that onion bite.

So delicious...deserves more than five stars. I had a two pound bag of frozen shrimp uncooked so I cooked it in some butter with garlic, pepper and paprika. Let that sit in a colander until cooled. I doubled the recipe except for the mayonnaise, left that about the same. I did add 2t of horseradish for a little zip. Chilled for several hours before eating. I believe cooking the shrimp myself instead of using already precooked shrimp added much more flavor to this salad. My husband said I can make this all summer long. I do think I'd chop the celery up a bit more next time.

I just whipped this up for a quick lunch, and we love it! Rather than leave them whole, I roughly chopped the shrimp. I swapped out the 1/2 cup of onion and instead used 2 green onions Also, I cut the mayo to 1/3 c. (still plenty!)  It was indeed "shrimply delicious" just seasoned with salt, but I decided to sprinkle in a little curry powder. YUM! I served it on a bed of salad greens, but it would make a great appetizer scooped onto cucumber rounds or crackers. And I'd also like to try it with diced avocado. Thank you, Nikijo!

So I didn't use the eggs because well I don't like eggs in my salad but I followed everything else. The big mistake I made is I made it the night before and I did add the shrimp! DOn't do that. Make the mayo let stand alone till you are ready to serve last minute. Other wise you will have shrimp soup. Very yummy will make again

As is, this is a delicious, simple, good old fashioned shrimp salad. I love the combination of ingredients & recommend adjusting the amounts to your taste. We prefer less mayo and more egg so I made those adjustments. Love the crunch of the celery & carrots in this salad. I also used red onion for added color. Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe!  :)

I had leftover cooked shrimp from a shrimp cocktail platter.  They were nice size shrimp, 21-25 count, and I couldn’t let those beauties go to waste, so I made this recipe.  This is a nice, basic shrimp salad that you can season to your own personal tastes.  I added a little Sriracha chili sauce to mine for a little kick.  I also loved the extra color the carrot contributed.  This could be served as a lovely salad on mixed greens, or as a sandwich filling.  Either way, it’s great!

Such a refreshing salad! Thank you for giving a base recipe. I must admit I tweeked it a bit. Instead of 3/4 cups of mayonnaise I used 1/4 cup mayonnaise and 1/4 cup plain greek yogurt. I then also added to your recipe, the juice of 1 lime, 1 garlic clove minced, and 1/4 teaspoon of dried dill weed. Served on dinner rolls with spinach and tomato to make little sandwiches. DEEELISH!

I had uncooked shrimp to use so I sauteed it in a little  oil and Old Bay.  I added another 1/2t.-3/4t. to salad mixture, like another reviewer, and added the tablespoon of lemon juice.  Gave the shrimp a coarse chop and used 1/2 c. mayo + 1/4 c. sour cream.  Served it open faced on a romaine lettuce leaf and a piece of toast - yummy.

I love the recipe!  I did however, add a few things.  I didn't have any celery so I substituted blanched asparagus.  I didn't have a fresh onion so I used dried onion flakes.  I used 1/2 mayo and 1/4 sour cream.  I also added a little over half a can of whole black olives.  Seasonings that I added to 'taste' was: Old Bay, Cayenne pepper, dried chives, celery salt, and parsley.  I hope this is helpful.  ENJOY!!

Very good and very easy. Way too much mayo, though.  When I make this again, I will start with 1/4 c. and go from there till I reach the desired consistency. Also, I did toss the shrimp with the juice of 1/4 lemon and let it sit while I chopped the vegetables.  Used fresh ground pepper and sea salt. Will experiment with other spices like garlic or dill next time.

With the exception of carrots, this the recipe my grandmother used 60yrs ago in Florida.  Shrimp was so cheap back then that she served it a lot.(according to my Mom)  I still use that recipe today & was thrilled to see you had it too. Its hard to find a seafood Res. that serves it. If served the same day you need less mayo, but if it sits over- night, you'll find that 3/4 c. mayo is perfect.. Sometimes even more..

We like egg salad so I doubled the boiled eggs and I had some fresh peas so I threw those in too. YUM! Very good, easy, and cool preparation for those hot days!

This is by far the absolute best shrimp salad I have ever eaten!  Hands down this is a winner.  I added it to our menu for the year!
 
The only changes I made were: 
*Use a low-fat mayonnaise and only enough to bind the stuff together, not make it soupy 
*Use already hard boiled and peeled eggs from the dairy section if you are like me and hate peeling hard boiled eggs 
*Use 1- one pound bag of frozen, jumbo shrimp that are already peeled and cooked. Pull the tails off and roughly chop them up into large chunks
The end result was spectacular! This would be a fantastic meal on top of some Bibb lettuce leaves and some crusty bread on the side.
So if you find yourself wanting to make something, I highly recommend this dish. Oh, and it’s easy and hardly any cleanup.

I liked it a lot! It dissapeared so fast! But it's missing something it desperately needs - spice. I was thinking about trying a marinade for the shrimp because I barely tasted it, maybe I'd cut down a little on mayo too but it was yummy! Ate in a croissant! :) Mmm

As a new cook, i'm always looking for quick and easy receipes. This dish was quick and delicious.  The only change I made, was that I used green onions. My husband requests this all the time now :)

Yum! Just what I was looking for. My shrimp were huge so I did cut them up some. Per other reviewers I was careful of the mayo, just added spoonfuls at a time and used half Mayo half miracle whip. I subbed a chopped fresh jalapeno for the onioin b/c it sounded good. Added a pinch of Old Bay at the end.

A tasty, easy shrimp salad recipe that turned out beautifully.  I added a splash of lemon juice for needed acidity.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Made this tonight with grilled chicken breasts...this is a great salad with very little effort! I added chopped radish and used light mayo. I only had cocktail shrimp on hand but it was still excellent. I highly recommend this salad. My wife and I loved it!!!

Love this basic Shrimp Salad!  Didn't change much other than used green onions in place of others as they are always mild and don't over take the delicate shrimp flavor.  Used frozen shrimp...well dried, too.!!!  Thanks for the great reminder of what summer is about!!!

I followed the advice of another reviewer and seasoned with Old Bay, cut down the mayo and omitted the onion. Yum! I'm serving this over a bed a greens and tomatoes with a hard roll on the side.

This is simply delicious! It is extremely quick & easy to make & can be made in large batches too. I used frozen precooked devained shrimp. I just thawed & peeled them. I then used a food processor to shred and chop the other ingredients. Clean up was a breeze! I did take the advice of other reviewers and I chopped the shrimp and added some Old Bay Seasoning. So versatile can serve with or without a bun or as tea sandwiches. This was so good my husband and I argued over who got the leftovers for lunch! Thanks for the great contribution NIKIJO.

My husband created a similiar recipe by adding small shell pasta, cole slaw mix, chopped cucumbers and Creamy Italian dressing; mixed together with your recipe makes a perfect side dish for any meal esp. barbeque times.

Very good! I omitted the onion and added a tsp. or so (to taste)of Dijon mustard and a splash of white wine vinegar for some kick.  Served with freshly baked potato rolls at brunch. Was well received by guests.

This was great.  Just to say made it for me and my husband ended up eating it all.  One change though.  Instead of using chopped onions I used onion powder since I am not an onion fan.

I am rating a good score because the boiled egg just didn't work for us at all. I added 4 oz cooked large elbow pasta and used miracle whip instead of mayo and this was a huge hit for the man-friends lunch. He loved the cool and refreshing option to his usual lunches of pasta salads. Make sure you use the right ratio of shrimp to celery, it could drown out the fact that this IS a shrimp salad not celery salad. NIKIJO, this is a wonderful basic recipe to tweek to individual preferences!

I chopped the shrimp because they were too large. Had on crackers as a dip/salad. Only used 1/2 cup mayo and it was A LOT of mayo, so 3/4 cup may be too much, but it's all about your personal preference. May add some Old Bay instead of salt next time to switch it up. Thanks for the recipe!

This is so good and so easy.  Great for a light meal.  I used green onions instead of regular onion because my family doesn't eat raw onions.  Also,  based on some of the reviews saying to use less mayonaise, I added until there was enough to coat the ingrediants;  probably about 1/2 cup.

An excellent basic shrimp salad.  I used light mayo and reduced the amount to 1/4 c and added 1/4 c extra virgin olive oil.  I also added an additional egg, a tsp of garlic and onion powder and just a tsp. of yellow curry powder and some fresh chopped dill and 2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice to the dressing.  Everyone loved it.

I found this to be an okay recipe. Followed the instructions "to the T" and felt like it was overwhelmed with the onion. I plan to try it again but reduce the amt of onion and add some other things like dijon mustard and cayenne pepper.

Really easy and delicious recipe!! I tripled the recipe and made for 18 people!!! Great for a lunch brunch! I boiled the shrimp myself so it was super fresh (simple to do - boil water with a handful of old bay and a few sliced lemons-squeezed and tossed in, let water boil when it does drop shrimp in, turn to medium low heat, cook for 4-5 minutes, place directly in bowl with water and ice to cool and firm the shrimp, leave for 20 min-1hr). I cut the shrimp in half, sliced down the middle. I halved the amount of mayo the original recipe called for.  The only thing I will do differently next time is add the egg at the end so it doesnt get so mushy when I mix it. Everyone enjoyed it!!

I added a little more celery than called for, four eggs instead of two, and used Miracle Whip rather than mayo (as we don't like mayo).  I also cut the shrimp into smaller pieces, as my shrimp weren't the salad size, but were really large.  Hubby liked it--he ate two helpings!

Very good.  Needed to use up some fresh shrimp.  I added a touch of lemon juice and old bay seasoning to punch up the flavor a bit.

I know I shouldn't rate a recipe I changed so much but I really loved this -with my changes. I was looking for a shrimp salad similar to the kind I used to have in Baltimore. This wasn't it but it inspired me to try a few different things - to this recipe I omitted the carrot & eggs, used sweet vidalia, added about 2 TBS Old Bay (more or less to taste), a pinch of cayenne and a couple of splashes of worschester. It was FABULOUS!  I served on crusty rolls with lettuce.  Yum!

This was good, with modifications.  Like other reviewers', I used sweet vidalia onion.  I also added a Tbs. of dijon mustard and a tsp. of horseradish for some zing.  Chopped a few herbs from my garden too - - thyme and parsley.  Then I hollowed out a couple of nice ripe Jersey tomatoes and filled them with the shrimp salad.  A very healthy and delicious dinner on a hot summer night.

I used 1 lb. bag of smaller frozen shrimp thawing them and patting dry with paper towels. I used 1/2 cup mayo, 1/4 sour cream, and 1/2 tsp Old Bay Seasoning. I added a little too much salt so will go light on that next time. We loved this recipe.

I added some lemon juice and cucumbers. Next time I will also add some fresh cilantro. Very good on crackers or lettuce. Could also add noodles.

This recipe was very good....I did as the others have suggested by chopped the shrimp into bite size pcs. I sauteed the raw shrimp in a creole seasoning. THis gave it a great flavor. Add I added tuna fish was added a great taste to the salad. For a richer taste add salmon instead of tuna.

Very good. I used canned shrimp and crab. I thought I drained it enough, but I had a runny-issue, so I had to add lemon juice to cover the slight fishiness. Still good, next time I will be sure to drain it longer.

I love shrimp prepared in almost any way but especially in a cold salad.  For this recipe, I used 3 eggs, boiled, separated the yolks and whites.  Chopped the whites for the salad and used the yolks to dress it.  In a separate bowl, I mashed the yolks with a dash of lemon juice and added the mayo (1/2 cup) and seasonings (salt, white pepper, and a dash each of paprika and dill).  After blending the dressing, I poured it over the other ingredients and tossed well.  Yum, yum!

I don't care for shrimp a whole lot but I liked this. I added a few touches of my own. I chopped up some Green Pepper and diced some Feta cheese. I prepared a bed of shredded lettuce and added some chopped Tomato for color. Yummy. ;)

this is a great starter recipe. yep, it needs some giddy-up. i added a half of a lemon squeezed, eye-balled some dried dill. maybe a tea-spoon, reduced mayo to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 sour-cream, added some cajun sauce to taste. left the salt on the side-line and added fresh ground pepper. i gnawed this with ritz crackers. great appetizers, especially in summer. update---I stuffed the salad in al dente jumbo pasta shells and sprinkled more Cajun seasonings on top and let chill for about 5 hours.

I halved the recipe in order to use up a 1/2 pound of steamed shrimp leftover from Valentines Day dinner.  I was using baby carrots so I just had to estimate how much would estimate 1/2 a regular carrot.  I whirled the carrots and onion in my small food processor and chopped the celery fine.  I added a couple good shakes of lemon pepper.  DH said it was a keeper.

Excellent Shrimp Salad, but you can give it a bit more flavor by adding some sour cream and capers! My husband loves this in the hot summer months in Florida.

Like others, added my personal touches, added red bell and jalapeño peppers, green onion, sour cream, shredded cheese, cut back on the mayo, extra egg, radish, and tomato. Drained and chopped everything really well and seasoned with costco non-salt seasoning with a touch of cayanne.....Yummy!

I've made this at least 5 times now, and every time it's amazing. My whole family enjoys this, which is quite a feat in itself. Just be sure to dry the shrimp quite thoroughly, one time I was in a rush and the dish came out watery. This is my go-to meal when I want something crunchy, fast, and to share.

Flavor is bad BUT i thought to many things going on that took away from the shrimp itself.  I may try it again to see and  leave out the eggs.

I LOVE IT! I added cucumbers and id used shallots. The only thing that I would suggest is to not put it in the fridge, the liquid from the veggies makes the salad watery instead of creamy like when id first made it. ..Also, I made a wrap w/ mine. It was nice, lite, and healthy. :-) I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN...AGAIN...and AGAIN! ;-D

I liked this recipe for it's delicate taste. I made some changes. Used four green onions for milder flavor. used half cup mayo. Used ready bagged carrots already shedded. put salad mixture on romaine hearts. I had leftovers to fill pita bread, this was most enjoyable.

Very good. Just like my Mom's. I used frozen, but thawed and put them in a thin cloth and squeezed till no juice came out.  Added old bay's and some dill.  Other than that, it was exactly the same. Thanks!

This is a good basic recipe, which I used as a base for making a vegetable shrimp salad.  I had leftover fresh green beans and broccoli, so I cut them up and used in place of the carrot.  I added a few squeezes of lemon juice and a few torn fresh basil leaves.  Made a refreshing salad to serve over fresh greens.

I used what was in the fridge -- small salad shrimp, radish instead of carrots and red onions. Others have commented about needing more bite, so I added dried dill, paprika, dried marjoram and Old Bay, then replaced half the mayo with horseradish sour cream dip. It's not the same recipe, but that's what I love about online recipes -- reading everyone's twist to the original!

I added a little fresh dill which was lovely.
Next time I'm going to try some curry powder.
It's a good base to work from, nice texture, visually appealing, tasty.

I'm that big of a fan of seafood, and this was okay for me. I wouldn't make it for myself, but my husband likes it though.

Quick and easy, particularly if you're already making shrimp.  I use some lime cilantro marinated shrimp that I had cooked on the grill, used lower fat mayo and added cayenne and cilantro.  I would cut the shrimp into smaller pieces as someone else recommended.  I also found it a little too "eggy" and would use just the whites in the future.

Good basic shrimp salad.  The second time I made it, I omitted the mayo and used ranch dressing. Added some olives, chopped bell peppers, capers, and some pimentos for color. You can tweak this to make it as spicy or elegant as you want.  Nice recipe!

I used 3 eggs, green onions vs. other and didn't add the carrots. Extra celery, 1/2 cup mayo.

This is SO awesome, even my mom will enjoy it. And she is VERY picky.

Thanks for sharing.

Very good. I modified it a bit, chopping the huge shrimp to smaller pieces and adding a teaspoon of white wine vinegar to the sauce. Didn't have an egg on hand, so I omitted that.  It turned out great!

This recipe is very nice- easy and delicious! I decided to make it because I had a pound of frozen shrimp I wanted to use, but it was raw, so obviously I cooked it but it cooks down to ~1/2. So I made the recipe with 9 oz of shrimp and it was still good. Since I didn’t have as much shrimp, I only used 1/2 cup of mayo, but otherwise I used the listed amount for everything else. Also the shredded carrots make it a little watery so I’d suggest prepping that first and letting it drain on a paper towel or something to get some of the water out. Would eat again and again :)

It was tasty, but a little bland. I think adding some spices next time will amp up the flavour. A refreshing change from lettuce-based salads, though.

Super easy and one of my daughter's favorites. She won't eat meat, but will eat fish and shrimp. Nice to have something simple I can make for her while I also prepare dinner with meat for the rest of the family.

I added several seasonings to this recipe, because we have to cut salt way down in our diet.  I added: Smoked paprika, ground mustard, celery seed, lemon, white pepper, and Mrs. Dash Garlic and herb seasoning to the mayonnaise. 

We both went for seconds, we liked it so well!  Thank you for the basic recipe from which I could "make it my own".

2.16.16   I didn't measure, but I did use all of the ingredients plus some green peas, a squeeze of a fresh lemon, and a shake of Old Bay® seasoning.  The recipe's name is appropriate because it really is "shrimply delicious."

It is the simplest most delocious recipe ever. Too bad I am trying to lose 20 lbs :(. I prefer the celery chopped too, and omitted the eggs. I love eggs, but I believe it is nutritious enough without eggs

I forgot that I had this recipe in my box, but I have to say, the couple of times I've made it, it has been pretty delicious. My one and only addition was to add about 1 tbs of dried dill to the mix. I'm going to have to make this again soon!

Very fresh and delicious salad! In place of the onions, I used scallions and also added a little lemon juice. This seems like something I would enjoy taking to the beach as a light lunch or even for a dinner on a hot day! Thanks for the nice recipe, NIKIJO!

As one of the reviewers said:  Perfect for a Friday night during lent!  I didn't really measure, but used four celery stalks, around 10 mini carrots (I put them in the food processor)half of a Vidalia onion, two (really minced) boiled eggs (I don't like them in chunks) -- I put in the mayonnaise by the spoonful until it was to my liking - by the way, I use Trader Joe's mayonnaise which is DELICIOUS ...My whole family LOVED it!!!!!!

Easy!  I had some frozen cooked shrimp from Costco which made this recipe even easier.  I didn't have celery, just carrots, so I just chopped the carrots for some crunch.  Added a sweet onion, eyeballed the mayo, cut the shrimp into pieces, threw in some Old Bay seasoning and some lemon juice like one reviewer suggested and added parsley from my garden.

It is very good...and particularly tasty on a whole wheat wrap with a little shredded cheese and then grilled on a George Foreman grill.  I replaced the mayo with Greek yogurt to cut the calories and add protein...and it tastes really good!  Healthy and fresh.  I threw in cilantro too!

Very good! I did make sure my shrimp was dry and cut back on the mayo (as a personal preference I mix 1/2 mayonnaise with 1/2 Miracle Whip to alleviate the overwhelming flavor or one or the other) and used Old Bay seasoning instead of salt. After all, what's a seafood recipe without OB? Thanks for sharing the recipe, we'll have it often!

I personally think this recipe is a good base, but made as is I think it's very boring.  So next time I would try horseradish sauce, garlic salt, maybe some mustard...  I'll have to read they the reviews and see what "zip" people have used.  Also, its a good idea to cut up the shrimp.
Thanks!

Don't change the recipe.  It is good as is.  Just goes to show you, that simplicity is sometimes the best route.

Love, love this salad!  I did not have any celery so I substituted chopped cucumber.  I also cut the mayo in half and substituted plain greek yogurt. I too chopped and dried the shrimp.  What a fresh, delicious taste, served with crackers!  I WILL be fixing this one again!

Delicious.  I substituted dehydrated onions to stop it from getting wet and used "old bay"  instead of salt & pepper.  Definately a keeper.

I made this for my mother she said it was the best shrimp salad she has ever had. I unfortunately cannot taste this recipe due to a SEVERE shellfish allergy so I am taking her word for it. I subbed bacon in for the celery cause I was out of celery. It still gave it a great crunch and she loved the bacon accents(due to bacon used a only mild pinch of salt for seasoning).

This was so great! I added lemon juice & used purple onion for color & flavor. I would definitely make this again. I ate this three ways: on toasted bread, with saltine crackers & in a bed of romaine lettuce.

Very good recipe.  I served this salad with a variety of crackers at a party. I also used this recipe to make BLT sandwiches using french bread and thick cut pepper bacon.

I did this yesterday and turned out just great :) I didn't have celery so i used shredded green bell peppers instead and i added sliced spanish balck olives too.  Its a very easy recipe and doesn't consume much time and i think it would be good either cold or warm.  Next time i will ad mustard, to add a more tangy taste to it. will definetly do it again :)

This was great made a few slight changes. First I used two pounds of shrimp shredded. Then I only used 1/4 cup mayo and added 6oz plain nonfat yogurt. Finally I used a sweet onion and a little less celery(not a fan)and added a tblspoon of lemon juice. Seasoned with a dash of chile powder, pepper, and adobo.

I followed the recipe and found it to be bland. I added a slight touch of Old Bay Seasoning and cayenne. I so wish it was a "keeper', but sadly it is not. My husband liked it, however.

I liked this recipe it was quick and easy. I love cheese so i added some "kraft" crumbles 3 cheeses and a half piece left over baked chicken, I dont care for raw carrots so I didnt use any. I used precooked shrimp and i let them thaw out all the way and it came out perfectly!!

I found the salad to be a little bland so I added some curry powder. The buttery toasted bun helped. I recommend using fresh shrimp, and letting it chill for at least a few hours to set.

so disappointing, I ended up heating it and making a pasta sauce out of it, that was good.
