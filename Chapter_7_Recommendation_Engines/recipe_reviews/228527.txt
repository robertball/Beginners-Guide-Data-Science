I used a box of couscous with the prepared seasonings for this tabbouleh so it might have tasted a bit different from how it was supposed to but it was very fresh tasting, summery, and delicious! The whole household liked it. I wouldn't change a thing. :)

Made this as written.  Flavor combination was odd (lemon juice was too strong).  Will not make this again.

I added a six bean medley (540ml can, rinsed), 5 oz  baked chicken breast, sliced into very small pieces, extra lemon juice and olive oil.  I let it sit in the refrigerator for an hour and it was faboulous even without feta cheese....we added it  before we ate it with the rest of the family. :)

I loved this recipe! I changed it up slightly by not using onions and added celery (nice added crunch) instead...as well as a few chickpeas.
Very fresh tasting, I'll definitely be making this again.
A great way to help me stick with my low sugar diet.

I make this about every other week at the request of my youngest...she loves it!  The only change I do is use all chicken broth, no water.

Wow! Made it just as the recipe stated and it was absolutely delicious. Used flat leaf parsley (Italian).

Followed the basics of this recipe and it turned out very tasty. I substituted quinoa for couscous; added half an avocado instead of feta; and used half the amount of oil called for. But the ingredients' texture and the mix of spices was all very appealing.

OUTSTANDING. I used Israeli (pearl) couscous and seasoned feta. I always decrease olive oil by 1T. & find I don't miss it. You can eat this for several days. Thanks for sharing.
