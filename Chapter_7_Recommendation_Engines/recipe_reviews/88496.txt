This was really good, but I made several changes.  First off, I sauteed garlic and onion in olive oil, when that browned I added one small zucchini and one small summer squash, chopped.  I didn't have a red pepper, but I did add a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce. This added a nice smoky flavor, along with a little heat.  I used egg whites and salsa instead of the tomato sauce, I didn't have any... Then when it was all done I topped with a little shredded cheddar cheese.  Ummm Ummm good!

I used mushrooms instead of onions/peppers and olive oil instead of vegetable. Used leftover spaghetti sauce flavored with meat. Sprinkled a little parmesan on top. REALLY good and fast!

Zucchini for Lunch Haiku: "Eggs an after-thought. Tomato sauce was wierd too. Unusual dish." Well, I salvaged my leftovers by mixing them into omelets for the next day's breakfast, b/c the 2 eggs in this just got lost amongst the veggies. The scrambled egg & tomato sauce became a kind of clumpy shade of "brain" pink, making this not the most attractive meal, but it was a great way to use the chubby zucchini that I'd just plucked from the garden. If I made this again, I'd swap tomato sauce for diced tomato, add minced garlic, S&P (I had to eat mine w/ considerable splashes of Sriracha due to its ho-hum taste), and increase the eggs.

I've been making a form of this for years, but I never considered adding eggs!  Great idea!  I try to eat low-carb, therefore, I don't eat bread.  This is a great lunch idea.  Can also top with some cheese!  I usually add mushrooms, too, or whatever fresh veggies I have on hand!

I didnt find this to be ugly looking at all, in fact I thought it was very pretty looking. I didn't however care for the taste. The favors didn't really blend or go together much, and I found it to be a bit bland, even with the addition of some garlic & black pepper. Not a waste of my ingredients or time, but nothing some craving to have again either.

This was quick, easy and tasty. I made a few changes - used tofu instead of eggs and added some garlic.

delicious mush, and only 10 minutes to make. i added chopped garlic and crushed red pepper to the eggs. also, used less tomato sauce, but added a chopped tomato at the same time. it may not look like much, but it's a great tummy filler when that's all you have in the fridge.

This was surprisingly good for brunch. My (picky) husband even liked it! I used butter instead of oil though, and not quite as much tomato sauce.

I really liked this for a quick light healthy lunch! I did make a couple changes and additions though. I used olive oilinstead of vegetable oil, a green pepper instead of red, and 3 green onions instead of a regular onion. I also only used the whites of the eggs. I added a serrano pepper, 5 halved cherry tomatoes, and 2 tablespoons of low fat cottage cheese. The sauce was a bit too much for me, so next time i will minus the cherry tomatoes and use a can of diced or stewed tomatoes as the sauce. I also topped it with a bit of shredded Dubliner cheese! This recipe was a great basis to start from!

There are not 3 lunch servings in here; maybe just one. I doubled the recipe, and it was barely enough for two. But it was delicious! It didn't need any added salt or spices I will certainly make it again, but I'll make a lot more!
