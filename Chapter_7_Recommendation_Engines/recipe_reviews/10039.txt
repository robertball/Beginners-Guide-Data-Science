Wonderful! My chocolate-and-peanut-butter-loving son gives these the thumbs up! Peanut butter is decidedly the predominant taste with just a touch of chocolate. If you prefer more chocolate taste then either frost with chocolate frosting or add 3-4 Tb cocoa to the existing frosting recipe here and adjust thickness with a few drops of milk to get it spreadable.

For some reason maybe because of the pix I thought these were going to be bars but it'e more like a really thin sheet pie/cake. Gooey messy & super rich. Some loved it some liked it. Someone commented that these would be good using chunky pb for the base.

Good but makes WAAYYY too much frosting! I suggest cutting that part of the recipe in half. Good treat for kids though.

I loved these. Use chunky PB for the base because others commented that they needed texture and used half the frosting (it was plenty). I'll make these again for sure.

My sister liked them I didn't- but we agreed there was really nothing special about this recipe. If you're not a frosting fan (which I'm not) fear and anticipate about 3/8 of an inch on top of these bars. We added extra chocolate drizzle and some chopped peanuts to the top which was nice. But If i ever made these again I'd add something to the cookie base- like corn flakes or oatmeal. I'd definitely add some chocolate chips. The bars as a whole are pretty soft and smooth and could use a little textural variety.
