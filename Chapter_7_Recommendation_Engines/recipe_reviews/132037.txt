Easy and quick in the crockpot, with precooking the potatoes in the microwave.    Changes I made were adding one more potato, more onion, about a cup less milk, 2 stalks of diced celery, and one can of low sodium chicken broth.  I also added less seasoned salt, using about 1 T of Mrs. Dash's Southwest Chipotle, along with celery seed instead of celery salt.  Near the end of cooking, I also added in fresh broccoli.  Will make again!!!

The final product tasted great!  But there were two problems with the recipe that really affected my rating:  1.  The prep time either needs to be changed 1 hour or instead of using the crockpot to make the base, do it in a pot on the stove and then transfer to the crockpot.  I started in the crockpot, saw that it was going to take more like 1-1.5 hours and moved over to the stove.  Followed the recipe exactly and then transferred back to the crockpot before adding the potatos, etc.  2.  This is just an opinion issue really, but 1 T of crushed red pepper flakes made for a REALLY spicy potato soup.  Next time (and I will make it again) I will probably cut that in half.  All things considered, it is a very tasty and simple potato soup and I love how it starts carmelizing around the edges of the crockpot as it cooks - SO yummy and pretty!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I doubled this recipe. I threw my potatoes in the crockpot with the onion and garlic and covered it with chicken broth instead of milk. I did not need the butter. When the potatoes were done, I did a quick mash with my potato masher, then I added in the bacon, one cup of fat free evaporated milk (my soup was thick enough already so I did not need the flour), a quarter cup of sour cream, the cheese, and a pinch of salt. After tasting it, I added my own personal touches (I sauteed some green onion with a mess of minced garlic in a little butter and threw that in with chives, hot pepper sauce, onion/garlic powder). Good recipe for soup that I could bend a bit and make more personal to me, lighter so I could enjoy without a lot of guilt, nevermind it was super cheap to make both on the food budget AND heating bill. This'll be lunch for the next couple days for my husband and I and we'll both enjoy this a great deal.

This recipe is a keeper.   I read most other's reviews and modified myself.   I only used 1/4 tsp red peppers and it was perfect.   I also sauteed the onions and garlic in a pot , using the same pot I had used to brown the bacon (minus the grease, of course).    I decreased the salt and added several whole stalks of celery for flavor (with leaves) while cooking and removed before serving.    I also used some low sodium chicken broth, mixing in during the cook time to prevent it from getting too thick.   I used one more potatoe and more onion.    Topped with bacon, shredded cheddar and green onions.

I used fresh celery instead of celery salt and saved my bacon for topping instead of cooking it in the soup. This is a very tasty and easy potato soup and would get a 5 except as written there is too much salt. I cut WAY back and it was still pretty salty. The addition of Parmesan was nice and I will make this again!

A tasty, spicy soup, but (I suppose this is somehow my fault) I could NOT get it to thicken! Anyone else have this trouble? I added extra flour too, but still nothing.

We like hot and spicy, but my oh my, too much red pepper flake.  We will cut it by at least half the next time we make this.  Also, too much seasoned salt...will also cut in at least half.  But all that being said, the soup will be one we make again and again I am sure.  We did add more bacon and onion and simmered in the skillet with bacon drippings and then moved to crock pot.  The basic recipe is good and we will tweek it to our tastes.

Very good soup with a few changes. Cook the veges on the stove first, not in the crock pot.  Also, I only used a few sprinkles of red pepper.  I would suggest not adding it at all for a wonderful traditional potato soup.  I also added half of the season salt because it looked like way too much and it was perfect.  Very filling and tasty!

Lol! Logically 1 tbs of pepper flakes is wrong, and anyone who thought 1 tbs is correct is an idiot. I do 3-4 shakes and it comes out perfect. Use your brain people. This is the only potato soup I use and everyone loves it. When my parents come over they pay me to make this for them.

I left out the celery salt & red pepper; added in diced celery and cooked it in the butter w/ the garlic/onion.  I also cooked all ingredients (except potatoes) in a large pan on the stove together before adding them to the potatoes in the crockpot.  This made it really easy to mix the herbs, cheeses, etc. prior to trying to blend with the potato.  I will absolutely double this recipe next time, it is delicious!

It has potential but is waaay to salty and hot as is.  I LOVE salt, but this was overkill.  I would definitely cut the seasoned and celery salts in half next time.  Also, I only used 3/4tsp of red pepper flakes as other reviewers suggested cutting back significantly.  This was still too hot for our liking, so I would go with 1/2tsp next time.  I didn't find the recipe had much flavour overall, but I'm guessing the salt overwhelmed the other flavours.  I boiled the potatoes instead of microwaving them.  Also, I did Step 3 on the stove instead of in the slowcooker as a few other people suggested -- it thicked well this way.

I think this recipe is great just as it is. I did adjust a couple things to my taste but it is an awesome recipe. I don't think people should give lower rating because their tastes are different. I will be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious! I used half the red pepper, no celery, 1/2 teaspoon all-spice, and about 2 cups of cheddar... other than that everything else was the same. Served it with some really soft cheese bread... the perfect Sunday night cold weekend meal! My husband is texting me asking if there's leftovers... so I'll definitely be making this again!

I make this soup exactly as is, except I do everything on the stovetop instead of the microwave/crockpot. I also use twice the amount of potatoes, and mash 1/2 of them before adding to the soup to create a thicker broth. I sometimes add fresh steamed broccoli at the end as well. My husband and I thoroughly enjoy this soup on a weekly basis during the winter months. Enjoy!

LOVE this recipe!  I only changed the crushed red pepper flakes to 1/2 teaspoon because I was serving it to young kids and didn't want it to be too spicy.  I also let the ingredients simmer in a pot on the stove instead of the crock pot until it thickened because the crock pot wouldn't simmer fast enough.  Then I just transferred it over.  Great flavor with the bacon and cheese!  I will double the recipe next time to have leftovers!

Very good.  Followed others advice and cooked all the ingredients on the stove until thick then added to the crock pot.  I would leave out the pepper flakes next time, adding only 1/2 of the pepper flakes made it too spicy for some family members.

I used fresh celery and cooked them with the onions and garlic, I used 4 ribs which was good.

I also added about a cup and 1/2 of fresh, steamed broccoli to the soup, it made for a nice full soup.

Kids eat it so it much not have been too bad. 

I think you could reduce the cheese and butter and still have a pretty thick soup.

I used 1/2% milk and it was very thick, I even thinned it with the water from the microwave steamer that I used to cook the broccoli because it seemed a little too thick even before cooking in the crock pot.

Since all the ingredients are cooked before hand I put the crock pot on High and only had about 1.5 hours to cook the soup before we eat and it did not taste like it needed any more cooking time but I think it could have handled more time in the crock pot if you had to leave it a while.

I will make this again just without the pepper flakes and I might try to cut down on the fat a little next time by cutting the butter and the cheese.

Delicious. My husband loved it. Added one more strip of bacon and half the red pepper flakes. I did this on the stove top and added the potatoes raw with the rest of the ingredients. Will absolutely make again.

This was SO GOOD!!!!   Tastes like something you'd order in a restaurant!   My husband and daughter's boyfriend loved it!   Next time I will use a little less red pepper because it was kinda spicy...but other than that, the BEST!

This is a great easy recipe.  I have also prepared this on the stove and simmer for 45 min when pressed for time.

FANTASTIC! I added 2 more potatoes, more cheddar cheese, and more bacon. Omitted celery salt as I didn't have any. Substituted red pepper flakes for 1/2 tsp chili powder. Will be my go-to recipe for potato soup from now on. Was super easy, flavorful, and delicious!

Made this only changes made were 
I prepped it on that stove, than transferred to a crock pot. I cooked on high 1 hour than low for 1 hour right before serving I added 2 cups cooked diced ham. I omitted the crushed red pepper.

I didn't like this recipe, the pepper flakes made it way too spicy. Had to add cream to try to fix it. Also prep time was much longer than stated.

I like it. I will make it again but with many changes. I added broccoli. I would also double the onion and garlic and spices. Except the pepper. I would half that. Maybe even less. I would also add more cheese. 
I used turkey bacon because it was all I had. I wouldn't recommend it if you're ok with eating pork. It was good, but not the way real bacon is!

I did this soup up with a few changes myself, I made a triple batch and I added one full package of Hickory Smoked Bacon(crispy) instead of 3 piece's.One lb of butter, 8 large red potatoes unpeeled and not fully cooked, a little crunch in them, 3 large cooking onions, 1 full buld of garlic cloves, 6 cups of milk total, 2.5 cups of sour cream, 1.5 cups of cheddar cheese, I used 1 cup of fresh grated Parmesan cheese, I also used Green onions to top off when served. This a excellent. Hope you try it. 2 thumbs up

I made this recipe almost exactly as written, with two exceptions. 1. I didn't add the bacon. I made this for a Lenten soup supper, which is a holiday where people don't eat meat. 2. I added more potatoes.  It was a huge hit. It was one of the two most popular soups at the event. Yes, it was spicy; and that's why people liked it. I think I took a little longer to prep this dish than the 30 minutes suggested. I only used a crock pot. Unlike some of the other reviews, I didn't find a need to use the stove at all.  I will definitely be making this soup again. It was a huge success.

This is a wonderful potatoe soup!  It is spicy, so if you don't like spicy food, adjust the red pepper...we loved the recipe as stated and brought it to a pot luck and it got rave reviews.

A whole tablespoon of red pepper was way to much. Next time I make it I'll probably cut back on that and the salt. Otherwise it's a pretty good soup.

This is super!!!  I made it for the first time for my friends who both were down with the flu.  They ate the whole thing along with some bread I made.

I don't see why you could not add broccoli, carrots or my favorite asparagus.  I will make this many times over.

I used a mixed bag (not all) of small red, purple, and Yukon potatoes (so just a few more than four).  Still turned out great! Yes, I would make this again.

I made it twice, once to test the original, second to make changes. I followed other  users' suggestions, like making the soup base in a pot, reducing salts, and  halving the pepper. I think the next time I make it I will add the pepper flakes back to full strength, my husband and I both like a little more kick.

I used two stalks of celery.  I omitted the celery spice.  Heated the crock pot, added the garlic.  Whisked in the flour and milk.  I cooked the celery/onion in the microwave for about two minutes.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  Pretty easy and very tasty!

For a potato soup, this is packed full of flavor! I always just get a random recipe from the internet, but I will definitely be saving this one. I had most of the ingredients in the kitchen already. I spent 11$ at the grocery store!

I had a hard time with the texture.  I struggle with cooking in general but even though I followed the recipe, it separated.  The flavor was delicious

I am not very gifted in the kitchen but even I was able to successfully create this dish.  I do plan on making it again with a few changes: 1) As other reviewers suggested, start out the soup base on the stove and transfer to the crock pot.  Otherwise it will take forever to simmer.  I ended up giving up and continuing with the recipe with no simmering. 2) Cut the salt content in half next time.  The first thing my boyfriend said after his first bite was "Hot much salt is in this?"  Still tasty, as I am a salt lover, but may reduce a bit for all palates. 3) I omitted the onion and garlic and only added a pinch of red pepper flakes - perfect!  Prepared the dish otherwise as directed and served with bread.  Great meal for a cold night in.

Good recipe.  Added celery and carrots steamed in the microwave.  Also like many other reviewers, I did the prep work on the stove before putting it in the Crock Pot.  Cut down on the red pepper and the salt

A little too spicy with all that red pepper.  I adjusted the amount of red pepper and the amount of seasoned salt.  I also added more red potatoes.  It turned out excellent with these adjustments!

I made this yesterday. It took longer than I though it would. I should have cut back on the peppers a little bit more. It was good but not as creamy as I would have liked. Not so sure I like the sour cream either. One other recipe I tried use cream cheese, I think I might try that the next time.

I originally tasted this recipe at a work potluck -- and, yes, it was very peppery. I still liked it, though, so I asked for the recipe. I did make a few changes per Jan's review -- I added one more potato and added a can of chicken broth instead of the extra cup of milk (because the final product at the work function wasn't soupy enough for me). I used less red pepper, too. I also used dill in place of fresh parsley because that's what I had on hand and I used 3 polish kielbasa links (sauteed in some butter) instead of bacon as I'm not a fan of bacon/ham. It was a good!

Way to much salt.  Used less pepper flakes also. Couldn't think of a way to save the ingredients we wasted.

I made the last night for my fiancee & I and it was fantastic! Although him & I absolutely love spicy food, I dont think it went well with the recipe. I will be making it again but will either omit the crushed red pepper flakes or only use 1/4 tsp for this. But this was very easy & yummy!!

This is a great recipe. But the base needs to be done in a pot first and then put into the crockpot with the potatoes and spices. Otherwise prep time is way to long.

I really wanted to like this but not one person in my family cared for it. I realized it might be too spicy from the other reviews so I started out by halving all the seasonings except for the red pepper flakes which I quartered. It was still so strongly flavored that I ended up almost doubling the milk to try to tone it down and still not even my very unpicky husband could eat it. Sorry.

Overall the soup was good. Too much red pepper and also too much seasoned salt. I added a couple extra pieces of bacon, which was good. I did not pre cook the potatoes in the microwave, because of the health concerns of cooking in the microwave and I didn't see it as necessary. I was right; the potatoes cooked up perfectly just being in the crock pot. Also, as a side note, my daughter is allergic to dairy so I used soy milk and dairy free butter as substitutes. Thirty minutes before dinner, I removed a bowl for my daughter and then added the sour cream and cheese to the rest. That worked out very well.

Had used the app to change amount to 2 servings. Did not use bacon. It was way too salty, and I even halved what the recipe said. Do not make this in a Ninja 3 in 1 crock pot. It started out looking great. Had to keep adding milk. Ate less than half a cup, too salty. I may try it in a regular crock pot, or better yet just stove top, and cut salt to nothing as the cheese etc has salt in it. People can add their own.

I love this recipe for cold days. Simple,easy and I never thought of doing the potatoes in the microwave first to cook them a bit or all the way depending on how long your leaving your soup in the crock pot. I do leave the red pepper out and put paprika in because we are a family of wimps that do not like spicy. =)

My picky husband loved this soup! I did make a few changes. I added an extra potato. Also, as other users commented, I halved the amount of seasoned salt I put in. I also used only a little sprinkle of red pepper flakes. As for the prep, I did it all on the stove, then added it to the crockpot to cook. I'm going to double this recipe next time!

Delicious!  I only made a few slight changes. I used onion power instead of chopped onion, and only a pinch of red pepper flakes. I cooked the bacon separately and crumbled on top instead of cooking in soup.  Perfect for a fall weekend!  Thanks for sharing!

SO YUMMY!!  I tweaked a few things - did not use bacon (i just didnt feel like cooking it), used only 2 cups of milk, and added one cup of chicken broth and 1/2 cup of water.  I also cooked the onion and garlic on the stove, then transferred to my crock pot.  Love this, will make it again!

It calls for too much salt, and I love spicy hot but a tablespoon of red pepper flakes make this taste awful. I love to cook, and to get creative but i will never make this again. I do not recommend this to anyone!!!!!!
