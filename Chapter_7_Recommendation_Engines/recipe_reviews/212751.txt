I used only 1T oil, then I added onions and some more okra to the recipe.  I used ground coconut and water instead of coconut milk.  This made a wonderful meal!

I love eating and cooking Indian food, and this was a nice change from the go-to chick peas and veggies. The okra gives it a great, almost sweet flavor. I used a little more jalapeno (I like things spicy), and 2 cups coconut milk so I had more sauce for my naan. I would make this again. The leftovers were even better.

Really good. I make this recipe a lot, and I've found that to keep it creamy like it is shown in  one of the photos, I wait to add the coconut milk until the okra has finished cooking, and just let it get warm. Simmering the coconut milk seems to make mine break down and separate and loose it's pretty color and creaminess.

Add more of the spices. 1/8 is too little.

I made this as written and we really like it a lot. I have made the recipe twice as we have fresh okra and tomatoes (I may add a bit more okra and tomatoes) from our garden and we both think it is a delicious use of the okra and tomatoes. It is definitely a change from just okra and tomatoes and with the spice from the peppers and sweetness from the raisins the flavor is balanced.

These two definite non-vegans inhaled this! Creamy, crunchy, spicy, sweet, this had it all. This is a Meatless Monday keeper for any day of the week.

I doubled the spices since I used a whole can of coconut milk (which is about a cup and a half) and a can of drained diced tomatoes since our garden has stopped producing them for the year.  Bulked it out a little more with onion and frozen green peas. If was probably a bit saucier than it was supposed to be but that just soaked into the rice and made it wonderful. We love spicy and we love Indian spiced food so we really enjoyed this recipe!

This was good, but I expected it to be much more flavorful with all these spices; next time I'll add more.

Fell in love with okra in India. For years I've been trying to find a recipe that tastes authentic--this is it! This has become a weekly meal and to my delightful surprise my 20 month old son LOVES it too. "More stars please. More stars please." The "stars" are the okra.

came out delicious the first time. I love the balance the raisins bring to the pepper and spices.

Wow, this was excellent!  I doubled the recipe and used lite coconut milk.  I skipped the tomato, cardamom, red pepper and jalapenos, simply b/c I did not have them on hand.  The flavor was still amazing.  I also added shrimp before adding the okra (I know it's supposed to be vegan, but couldn't resist).  I definitely had to add some salt at the end.  So good, adding it to the family dinner rotation!

This was an amazingly flavorful recipe and a creative way to use okra. Didnâ€™t have cardamom or bay leaves but it still tasted beautiful without it. Next time I make this, I will be leaving the golden raisins out. Simple to make and healthy as well. Garnish it with cilantro and serve over a bed of rice.

Used chicken instead of okra and added brown sugar to this.  Brown sugar helped the dish a lot.

Love Inidan food and this recipe is simple and delicious! It's a great way to use up okra from the garden.  Ready to make it again!
