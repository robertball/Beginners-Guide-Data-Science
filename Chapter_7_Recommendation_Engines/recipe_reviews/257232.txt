I made this for a potluck that had the theme "Architecture".  I stuck to the recipe except I used toasted pecans instead of walnuts and added a bit more honey to the dressing.  It was such a hit that there was none left!

This is very similar to my mother's Waldorf Salad except she added Maraschino Cherries and put a little of the juice in the salad dressing (just enough to make it a pale pink).  Also her recipe does not have lettuce in the salad but she would put the salad onto a lettuce leaf so probably either way would work.
