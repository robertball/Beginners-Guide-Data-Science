So delicious! I halved the cake portion of the recipe, replacing the nuts for mini chocolate chips (for the kids) and baked it in an 11x7 baking pan, so it came out a bit thicker, more like a cake, but it was perfect for us. I do wish that, just for the sake of knowing, the size pan would've been indicated. I did use the full recipe of the frosting, which was also delicious. Loved the hint of cinnamon in this too! This was so simple to make and came together in minutes...this recipe is a definite keeper~YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made as directed minus nuts. I used a 17.25" x 11.5" baking sheet, but it still came out more cake like than brownie. Tasty way to use up zucchini!

I will make these again and substitute applesauce to make them more moist. Also consider doubling the frosting.

Yummy and very moist. Even my zucchini-shy husband approved! Instead of 1 1/2 cups of oil, I used 3/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce. Omitted the nuts and used ready-made frosting. I baked it in a 9x13 pan, so it took much longer to bake and turned out more like a dense cake rather than brownies.  I will be making this again.

This recipe yields enough for a very moist, delicious cake in a 9x11 pan! Follow the recipe but then Bake 50-60 minutes!

Delicious! my frosting turned out nothing like the picture- however it was still the perfect way to get rid of some zucchini.

I used a jelly roll sized pan since it did not say specifically.  It was not big enough, so ended up going over and everywhere.  Texture was not like a brownie.  Only use if you are planning on a sheet cake.

These brownies are okay.  I think next time, I will make more frosting (maybe a batch-and-a-half).  Just needed more than the thin layer.

frosting is good, but the brownie part is too heavy and wet. Very disappointing.    will keep looking for a better, more tasty way to use up the zucchini from my garden

They were very good! I didn’t have any powdered sugar on hand for the frosting so I just used semi-sweet chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, & butter which I put over the stove until all the chocolate chips were melted for the frosting. It gave it an extra fudgey chocolately flavor :).

I have made this recipe in years past.  It is a winner.  I have made the brownies/cake and share with many people.  They always want this recipe!!  This is the most yummy flavorful moist cake.  I make mine with California Walnuts I get at Trader Joes.  Thanks for having this wonderful recipe on your site for us zucchini growers!!

Awful! I had super high hopes from the 6 five star reviews and what a waste of my time & ingredients! Firstly, the recipe doesn't state the size of the rimmed baking sheet, so I went with the medium sized one in my drawer. The batter went to the brim! Had me wondering if I should've went bigger? But I didn't want a 9x13 casserole dishes since these were supposed to be "brownies". I had to cook for 30 minutes and once cooled, the bottom was gooey. It did NOT have a chocolate taste, heck, it did not even have a good taste at all. I didn't even bother to make the frosting, but surely that might of made it taste better? I dunno, I give up! It is very dense, not much flavor and a total regret. Zucchini cake bars are far more delicious & I'll never make this again.
