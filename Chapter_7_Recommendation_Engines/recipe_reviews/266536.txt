I used these tasty little meatballs and the dipping sauce to make mini meatball sliders.  Aside from increasing the greek seasoning to 2 tsp I made as written and will do so many more times in the future.  If you enjoy things a little bit out of the box then this is a must try!  The few leftovers I had got crumbled into a salad along with the extra kalamatas and feta some cucumbers and tomato and a hummus ranch dressing.  So perfect for a light dinner.
