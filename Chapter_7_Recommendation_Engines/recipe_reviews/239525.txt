I did.i added some onion , garlic, red pepper and spinach. Found some dried porcinis I needed to use up so threw those in with pasta. It was good.. needed another egg white though, but that was due to me adding veggies  Next time I'll try this with ketchup as per recipe submitter.. i forgot and it was great without it

It was very good! I added some shredded cheese and garlic, and it went very well. I'm definitely gonna make this again.

I made this myself as a child in Brooklyn, NY -- and yes, I used ketchup!  I loved it.  Sort of a variation on Matzoh Brie using noodles instead of matzoh!

It is so good! I used Ramen Noodles for the Pasta, and I sprinkled some Parmesan Cheese on top.

My mom always called this "The WPA Eggs." When I asked her why she said that's what her mother called them because that`s how they made them in the WPA. I gather my grandmother must have either been a cook in one of the programs or gotten a hold of their recipes.  It was used to stretch eggs so everyone could have some; and during those years,when they had seven mouths to feed, it was a rare day indeed when everyone got their very own fried egg! But grandma made "the WPA" most days.
