We threw in some extra veggies, including shoe peg corn, and a little garlic. When it was time to add the cheese, we switched to broil to achieve more browning without having to wait a while for our oven to brown the dish (admittedly, our oven is very slow). It was delicious and goes on our keeper list. I wish I hadn't looked at the calorie count. Oh, well. Too late now!  Blessings and Merry Christmas to all fledgling and seasoned cooks out there.

I've made this several times and the first time, followed the meat portion of the recipe to a tee, but used boxed mashed potatoes because I'm lazy like that. We loved it! I'm making it now with leftover smoked pork loin roast, a bag of frozen mixed vegetables and 3 cups shredded zucchini from my summer harvest, and using real mashed potatoes since I have an abundance of potatoes right now. It's a quick recipe using frozen veggies and boxed potatoes or a great way to use up leftovers. Play with it and enjoy, thanks so much to the original poster!!!
