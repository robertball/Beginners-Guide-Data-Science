Super simple.  I accidentally grabbed the "buttery" crescent rolls and it just make it more delicious!  
I used some floss to remove some of brine and cut the round of brie is half horizontally.  I put the bottom half on the crescent roll, put a huge glob of fig spread on the cheese, then capped it off with the other half of the cheese and more crescent roll.
Be sure to press the creases together real well.  One tip I learned was to bake it in a shallow round dish that you can serve the brie in.  This way, if it starts to leak while baking, it's no big deal.  Enjoy!

This has been a favorite for years. One big change is to add a couple of large tablespoons of pesto on top of the brie and then seal. It really makes a difference

I have been making this brie for the past year and each time everyone loves it!  I have also put an apricot preserve on top of the brie and then covered with the crescents.  You can also try cranberry chutney, walnuts cooked with fresh cranberries and some brown sugar, use your imagination!  This can be a show stopper!

Great recipe. If you're cooking for one or two, just use a small brie wedge and two crescent triangles. Serve with sliced apples and wine!

I too have been making this for years, using the crescent rolls in the can is key to it being easy and tasting like you spent all afternoon making it. Try adding stuff to it like,olives,pepper flakes,mushrooms, walnuts,tobasco, capers, smoked salmon,sun dried tomatoes, the list is endless. Great crowd pleaser

I top with brown sugar, cinnamon, a few pats of butter and dried cranberries.  Great for parties.  I've prepared up to 2 hours before baking.

This takes a little practice in getting the seams in the dough sealed, but wow was it worth it. This has lovely presentation and is delicious with whole cranberry sauce served on the side. This pairs perfectly with a cabernet sauvignon.

They really aren't kidding when they tell you to pinch the crescent roll seams together! I tried this recipe but cut the brie in half to put in some apricot preserves like I've seen in other recipes. The cheese leaked out, but even after that mishap it looked great with the sides disguised by some bread and crackers. The apricot preserves sweetened up the cheese. It tasted great, and my boyfriend was very impressed!

So easy and so delicious. The egg really helps to make it shine. Guests were impressed. The brie doesn't have to be round; could be a wedge. Also, try experimenting with the flavors -- herb Brie is fantastic with this recipe.

Took 2 minutes to wrap the crescent rolls around the brie and popped it in the oven.  We served with Granny Smith apple slices and french bread!  It was perfect, elegant and easy!

I love this recipe and make it as a treat for my husband and I with a nice bottle of wine. We enjoy and nice Merlot with this or Champagne. I cut my brie in wedges to fit the size of servings I want as a whole recipe is a little too much for 2 people but I have reheated it later and it heats up nice.  I change this recipe with different toppings often. I usually drizzle the wrap with honey before baking and sprinkle with nuts of choice. I serve with apples or firm pears or a nice artisan bread or baguette bread. A nice topping inside the wrap before wrapping is a little applesauce or marmalade. Like I said the changes are endless. I always put in a glass baking dish that fits the wrap as close as I can so if it ooze's, it will not run all over.  This is a must for the holidays or any other "special" evening.

I have been making this as an appetizer for years and it always turns out perfect.  I usually serve it with a jalape√±o jelly or cranberry chutney.  You can also top it with pine nuts or sunflower seeds after you brush on the egg.  One tip to help seal it better is to let the dough warm to room temperature after you open it.  By letting the dough relax it is easier to wrap and pinch the seams to avoid leaks.

It was gone by the end of the night!  Very, very easy!  Next time I'm going to try putting brown sugar and pecans on top, then wrap the crescent over it.

i made this as a tryout using half the pack of croissant roll and a wedge of brie with truffles. i modified it slightly and topped the cheese with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, a dash of salt and a tsp of brown sugar. after sealing it i added small pieces of butter on the outer crust and drizzled honey. it was awesome. this was paired with some smoked salmon and granny smith apples. i plan on making this for our upcoming christmas gathering.

I need to try this one again.  Almost my brie leaked out into a baked puddle of cheese.  I am sure if it stays inside this will be great! It still tasted good though

Beautiful and delicious! I made two for New Years' - one with cranberry chutney and one with pesto. They both disappeared pretty quickly in a group of 12 people. I didn't bother with the cut outs, I just arranged the crescents with points out, like a sunburst, and then wrapped the Brie inside. Lovely.

When I was in college and couldn't afford Brie we made this with cream cheese (which is pretty darn tasty!)  Nowadays I make it with real Brie and usually pour a spicy pepper jam on top or serve it with fruit and nuts on the side.  Easy and super tasty.  If you're having a dinner party though, don't make too much or the guests will be too full for dinner!

This was terrific!  I put raspberry preserves and chopped pecans on top of the brie, then wrapped the crescent dough around it - and topped the whole thing with maple syrup before baking.  Yum.  Definitely crowd pleasing.

I made this and placed sliced pear and raspberry perserves on top of the brie before wrapping with the dough. I topped it with sliced almonds after brushing it with egg. My husband and even 7 year old loved it.

Super yummy- just don't brush it with the ENTIRE egg like I did (that was dumb) the outside got done way before the inside had a chance to melt. I just popped it in the microwave for a minute and no one knew the difference. But delicious! -Oh, and I also cut it in half and spooned some apricot preserves in the middle, made a sandwich and then wrapped. Super good.

This was super easy to make and absolutely delicious.  I removed the rind and topped the brie with raspberry preserves.  I then topped the dough with some almonds.  I took it to a holiday gathering and there was nothing to bring home.  Will definitely be making again.

I've made baked brie with frozen puff pastry but didn't want to buy a whole package for just a 4 oz. brie, so I used crescents... preferred puff pastry because the crescent dough was kind of soggy, and too sweet.

Five stars because it's easy and excellent! I topped the brie with a tablespoon of apricot preserves before enclosing it with the crescent roll dough. I made it for a New Years treat for my fiance and I. It will be great to take to the next party we're invited to!

Delicious.  I sliced the cheese in half,  sprinkled with fresh chopped garlic, put the other half back on top, sprinkled with more garlic and then wrapped in the crescent rolls.

Having never used Brie cheese before, my first mistake was not knowing that there is a very thin soft cover (or rind) on it.  (I'm still not sure how to get that off easily.) ha  Regardless, I followed the directions as indicated and though it did not look as pretty as the photo attached to this recipe, it tasted okay.  I toasted some French baguettes to go with it.  Overall, we ate it but we did not love it.  I really think if I had added some apricot preserves on top of the cheese before wrapping it up, it would have been better.

Simple and beautiful! I will make this again for the holidays, it's that elegant. The imagination can go wild with this recipe at the core, but please try it as written first. It is fabulous unadorned!  For additions I'd go with garlic, olives, parsley, pesto inside on top of the brie, sesame, poppy or caraway seeds outside... um! Can't wait to make it again!

Delicious! I baked this in a decorative stone pie pan and placed bread chunks around it. Very pretty! I only wound up using half the dough. I think I may have had a smaller cheese? I cut the rind off, there was nothing in the instructions about that and I have baked "in rind" before but I prefer it without. We sopped up the deliciously decadent result with french bread cut into 1-2 inch cubes. I will definately make it again. You must eat it right away or it congeals quickly.

This was fantastic! I just wrapped the cheese in the dough, ignoring the cut-outs. I also topped it with apricot preserves out of the oven. Served with regular wheat round crackers and we couldn't stop eating it! Definitely let it cool at least 20 min before cutting into it or the cheese runs out everywhere.

Fiance liked it but I found this overly rich. Not sure of the type of cheese used, but it was called "Meteorite" by Alexandre de Portneuf (it had a vegetable ash exterior, but was a soft cheese like Brie). We didn't use the egg.

This is an awesome recipe and guests love it. I add carmelized walnuts (the kind you get right in the bag), craisins, and sometimes just a few small slices of apples, and it's so good. I've also added sauted portabellos and a bit of carmelized onion for a completely different modification (not the the walnuts and fruit - completely different one, just for clarification)..get creative with it..easy and great!

Made this for a party last night using the 20 oz brie from Costco and a can of the Pillsbury Recipe Creations Crescents (a flat sheet of the same crescent dough without the cutouts).  Baked on 350 for about 30 min.  The entire plate was gone!  What a hit.  I'll be making this for any party I go to or have!  Perfect!!!!

very good.  i used the seamless crescent dough, cut a circle around the brie, wrapped it up, then used the excess dough to cut out shapes for holly and placed them on top before baking.  it came out so pretty looking.

Easy ingredients, but the overall directions on how to actually wrap the crescent around the cheese are lacking. Rolling pin was required. Also added lingonberry jam on the cheese in the wrap for an extra flavor boost. Let it cool out of over for at least 15 minutes plus, otherwise you have a cheese mess!

My cousin made this for Christmas several years ago.  It's something I've made for roommates and parties through the years.  I crave this and have opened my husband's eyes to this cheese' powers (he was formerly a "string-cheese only" guy).  It's so easy to jazz up by using small cookie cutters to cut holiday shapes and arrange on top of the cheese.  I know a lot of people throw in a layer of preserves, nuts, veggies or fruit in between the cheese and crescent, but I love my mine plain and simple.  Can't wait to make it again soon.

So good and so easy...I sliced my brie down the center (to make two thinner rounds) and sandwiched apricot jam and toasted almond slices in the center then wrapped it up.  Everyone loves this, thank you!

Fabulous!  My mom and I have been making a similar recipe for years.  We use Phyllo dough instead of crescent, but either way is great.  Also, we cut the wheel of brie in half to make two wheels then fill the middle with whatever filling you choose (like making a two layer cake) then wrap it with the dough and bake.  It looks great when you cut it open and all the flavors meld together really well.  Sweet or savory - use your imagination!  I have yet to meet a person that didn't LOVE this recipe!

I made this with the Holiday Cranberry Chutney and Mint Chutney. It went over big time at the party I took it to. Everyone's mouth was watering when I got it out of the oven, and I'm not exaggerating. It was super easy to make and I'll most definitely be making it again.

Made this twice in one week, once for a family dinner and then again for a work function.  It was a HUGE hit at both placed with EVERYONE!  I added praline pecans to it and topped with strawberry preserves prior to baking.  Served with some yummy crackers and was told I had to make it again! ?

I randomly chose to make this and was able to turn my entire family and boyfriend onto brie. Also, I used a full wheel of Joan of Arc brand. The consistency of it was EXCELLENT! Make sure you pick a cheese that is not too creamy otherwise you'll have to make sure the corners are sealed well. Apricot preservative served on the side balanced out the earthy flavor of the cheese (much recommended). I'd also stress serving it after it has slightly cooled that way the cheese doesn't flow out easily and each slice can have an even amount of brie.

I made this for a party and everyone was thinking I was so fancy and such a good cook!  I put raspberry preserves inside and sliced almonds on top and served with those crunchy crouton-like mini toasts.  Put it on a crystal cake plate and let the compliments roll in!  Pun intended!

Love this recipe! So simple and delicious. I've made it plain & with jalapeno jelly on top of the cheese. Both versions are always a hit at parties!

The first time I made this, it was the first time my husband and I had ever tried Brie. We all loved it sooo much! We make individual cresent wrapped brie with each crescent in the pack. They are great to go with everyday dinners!

I top with a mix I make myself of good French brandy, nuts (almonds, pecans, or wlanuts, whatever you like) and chopped figs. I just toss a chunky, not too thin layer on top. It's messy, gorgeous, and yummy!!

Excellent and EASY! The second time I made it I spread homemade chile sauce and minced garlic over the brie then wrapped it in the dough and baked.  Our Christmas guests raved about it.
Thanks.

This is a simple yet sophisticated recipe. The presentaiton is impressive for guests and makes it taste all that much better. For brie cheese lovers, serving this as is, without flavors goes over best. I have served this with a cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving, which was a hit as well.

SUPER yummy.  I found crescent roll in a sheet which made it easy to wrap. Topped the Brie with apricot jelly and glazed pecans than wrapped it and sprinkled more pecans on top. My guests and I found this outstanding.

This recipe, with a few modifications, is a big hit! I use homemade cranberry sauce and chopped pecans (and sometimes a little brown sugar). Put some inside with the brie, and some outside for the topping. Bake in a dish that allows for spillage. I serve it with sliced granny smith apples. Yum!

I too accidentally bought the buttery crescents which tasted fabulous and I have to admit, since it was just for us I didn't bother making it look too fancy--but it still looked great!!! It must be the egg. Served with sliced baguette and apricot preserves. Fantastic!!!

This brie is not near as tasty as the baked brie's with the toppings baked into the chese and wrapped in pastry.  Try one of the other baked bries.  They are to die for and you dont have to worry about the Pillsbury dough breaking like the dinner rolls.

Topped the brie with a home made pesto paste before wrapping it in the bread but didn't realize that the crescent dinner roll bread is sweet so the flavors clashed. Probably would have been delicious with an apricot spread instead (or something sweet).

This wasn't as big of a hit as I was anticipating.  It tasted bland and awkward when guests were trying to cut it and the cheese was spilling out of the crescent wrap.

This is a very easy but really great recipe.  Everyone loved it at Christmas eve dinner.  My dad, who is such a fuss-pot, couldn't get enough of it.  Thanks for a wonderful, easy recipe.

Served this as an appetizer on Christmas.  Delicious and so easy!  I added 3T of strawberry perserves.  YUMMY.  It was gone in minutes--seriously.

A hit! Super easy, and delish.  I made it at my dinner party and was asked to bring it to a party the following week as it was so popular.  Topped mine with brown sugar and dried cranberries.  I did cook mine a bit longer than the recipe called for -- maybe 30-35 minutes?

Loved this!!! I used another reviewer's suggestion and added peach apricot preserves on top of the cheese (before covering with the crescent dough). It was delicious! I served it at a holiday party, and everyone loved it.

I always put apricot jam over the brie before I wrap it up. Hands-down the best appetizer I've ever made, extremely easy and my guests always go wild when I have it waiting for them!

I have made this MANY times for various occasions, and everyone always loves it! Depending on my mood, I sometimes add some preserves, like apricot or raspberry or honey and nuts, and sometimes just make it as is. Any way I make it, everyone REALLY enjoys this~YUM! :)

Always a huge hit. And so easy/fast. Yes, best with raspberry or apricot preserves. BTW: You don't cut rind off Brie cheese or use a different cheese for this (which accounts for a couple of the negative reviews). And you do have to like Brie to love this.

I added a couple of big tablespoons of apricot preserves to the top of the brie before i sealed it up. One thing i would fix to make it a 5 star recipe is to flatten out the crescent rolls more and use a larger round of brie-the first time i made this the brie was too small and there was WAY too much bread to cut through and eat.

A great and easy party fav.  Make sure to not over lap the dough to much.  It will not bake as even. I could not find the 8 ounce of brie so use a 16 once and cut in half.  Worked great. I used sugar free jam and that was also good.

I put a couple small slices of butter on top of the dough and drizzle it with a little honey before baking.  Quickest and easiest elegant appetizer ever.

Exceptional. Worked perfectly and was yummy. Only donside is the little ducks I cut out sank intoi the rest of the dough a little bit and came out looking more like little blobs than ducks. Minor criticism - this was very good!

This was really good!  I found out after the fact that I really don't care for melted brie, but hey, what are you gonna do?  I added some cranberry jalapeno jelly over the top before I sealed it and it was to die for and the guests all raved about it.

Oh my god this is a great recipe.  It was so simple and quick.  My guests loved it.  My only warning ti make sure that the seams on your dough are sealed well.  I had a little leakage from one of them, other than that it was perfect.

Yuck! I tried this with a little apricot preserve fruit spread inside. It didn't taste good. A waste of money for the brie. My entire family wished we had used monz. and pep. inside more of a pizza crescent wrap.
