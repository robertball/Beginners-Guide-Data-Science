Fantastic! I used gluten free all-purpose flour instead of wheat flour. I also chose the "healthy alternative" in the notes and made them in a non-stick skillet. This made them look a bit more like a pancake but they were light airy and crispy nonetheless. Definitely a treat for your next brunch. Thank you for the recipe.

Too dense. I dusted them with powdered sugar and it made a nice sweetness
