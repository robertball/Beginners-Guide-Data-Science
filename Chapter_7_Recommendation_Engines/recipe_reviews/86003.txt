I recommend that you use LONG grain rice and increase the liquid to 2 cups.
The ratio should be 1 part rice to 2 parts liquid for long grained rice. I also added mixed vegetables (SEE MY PHOTO).

To tell the truth, I cheated by cooking it in the rice cooker. First I dumped the rice in. Next I poured in the chicken broth and onions. I melted the butter in the microwave and mixed it into the rice cooker as well (I melted it so it would get evenly distributed)... Then set to cook. Turned out fine that way.

This is a great base recipe.  I  used regular rice, added some garlic, finely diced carrot and some fresh mushrooms.  I will definately be making this a lot!

I love this basic recipe. I have used it as is and have also added some extras (Like Minced broccoli) depending on the main course. It is perfect when you need a bed of rice for salmon!

Good simple recipe for a rice side dish.  I used brown rice, increased the broth to two cups, and used a whole small onion.

Nice recipe! Didn't have any chicken broth in the house, so I used a can of french onion soup. I used Basmati rice and browned it in a bit of olive oil to bring out it's natural nuttiness. Kids and hubby loved this side. Thanks!

Just the sort of basic rice with just a little pizzazz I was after.  Since I wasn't convinced making a special purchase of calrose rice was critical to the success of this recipe, I simply used common long grain converted rice. This is lightly flavored which was exactly what I wanted so as not to compete with my main dish.

I only used a 1/4th of a med/large onion, which might be the same amount as the recipe, or maybe a little more, but it was fine for us. I also didn't have any broth on hand so I used two cups of water and dissolved a bouillon cube in with it all. I simmered for 20 min, which seemed a good time, and poof, delicious!  (I also didn't add anything in- I was eating it with shrimp and lobster and didn't want to overpower with too many flavors - the onion was just fine on it's own)

I went out and bought the Calrose rice specifically to make this recipe.  Although I enjoyed the flavour of this rice I was not a fan of the risotto-style texture.  Anybody want my leftover bag?

I don't normally alter a recipe until I try it as first written, however, I did this time. I had some green onions I needed to use and so I used them instead of regular chopped onion. I also added a handful of chopped walnuts and browned the onion, rice and walnuts in the butter. I then added my broth and simmered until the rice was done. I will make this again but I think I'll use pecans next time.

This was a solid base. 30 mins is too long though. The rice was sticking after that time. I guess if I add 1/2 cup more of broth it should be fine. I'll add some more stuff next time.

A good basic side dish. Instead of using a skillet and a saucepan, you can add the rice & broth to the same skillet that you sauteed the onions in..less for you to clean up later!

Add onion powder, garlic, or onion soup along with beef or chicken broth.  Depends on what your main course is. Delicious!

This was a great base for pilaf but it seemed like something was missing.  There was salt in the chicken broth so it wasn't salt.  I tried to add a little garlic powder but that didn't cut it either.

This was a really great side dish. Due to what I had on hand I used regular long grain rice and upped the cooking liquid to 2 cups as others have done. I also sauteed the rice with the onions as this is the way I always cook my rice. The onions and broth gave this a very nice flavor.

This is a great basic recipe from which to start, adding and substituting your choice of veggies in the sauteing step. (I prefer onions, celery, green pepper and garlic.) Like other reviewers, I prefer to use long grain rice, using the 1 to 2 ratio of rice to broth.

Being beginner cooks, we made a slight cooking error & burnt the rice!  However, it was still DELICIOUS and we ate every last bit of it!  Our cooking error occurred due to us deciding we should cook the rice in the skillet, rather than dirtying up a sauce pan!  We have no idea what we are doing in the kitchen, but we know we love this recipe!  Next time we cook, we'll follow the directions!

This rice is really easy to make and delicious. I don't really like white rice, so the chicken broth gives is a great kick, the onions give it flavor. Great with almost anything! I use a little extra broth because I like my rice tender.

We really enjoyed this! I used regular long grain rice (that's what I had on hand), which I toasted slightly along w/ the onions, and upped the chicken broth to 2 cups (only needed to cook about 20 mins.). Nice, simple side, and one that I will make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

this was very tasty and extremely easy to make. I sauteed the onion in the same pot I made the rice in to save on dirty dishes. Calrose rice is medium grained, so it comes out ofter and stickier, but that is the way it is supposed to be. The flavour of this dish was lovely. Thanks!

Tried this dish for the first time and absolutely loved it. It only makes a little bit of rice though, so I'd recommend doubling the recipe.

I made this for sunday night dinner and it did, not go well. I found the rice very dry and that there was not a very strong flavour.

I thought this was a great and easy recipe. I also added mushrooms. I can't imagine anyone being able to mess it up.

I made this with grilled fish but I altered it a little.  That is the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't make exactly what was there.  I followed previous advice to use 2 cups of broth.  I made my broth from 2 boullion cubes.  I didn't have onion so I used Lipton onion soup mix.  I also added garlic powder because my family loves garlic.  It tasted great!!  We loved the finished recipe!

I served this rice beneath herbed feta chicken.  I also used long grain organic rice and used the 2 parts broth to 1 part rice method, as another reviewer suggested.  It was very good with the tartness of the chicken, however, it would maybe be a little bland for my tastes on the side by itself.

I made this the other night as a side dish to fish.  I followed the recipe exactly except I did add more onion and I cooked it in my rice cooker.  The end result was "ok"; nothing fantastic.  It needs something for sure, I just don't know what.

Our family loved this rice.  Very easy and flavorful.  I used brown rice instead of calrose.  Lightly browned it in the butter with the a whole small onion and then put it in the steamer with the broth.  Made a bed of it with salmon on top and was fabulous.  Was looking for a good rice recipe to serve with fish, and this is just the one.  It will definately be making a regular appearance on our table.

I added some chopped mushrooms (as suggested) and upped it to 2 cups broth. Silly me, I used sodium free broth and unsalted butter so it came out a little bland. Next time I will add 1 clove garlic and sautee it with the onions, as well as a pinch of salt. Still, very good.

Good recipe - I used Lucy's variation (1 cup long grain rice, two cups liquid).  Want to make it look extra fancy with zero effort?  Throw in a teaspoon or so of dried parsley.

This was a great side dish!  Simple to make and FULL of flavor!  I and, more importantly, my fiance both loved it!  Just be careful with the liquid...if you don't add enough, it can get pretty dry.

My mom always made rice pilaf with vermicelli browned in it first.  Maybe the definition of pilaf is looser than I imagined because I don't quite understand why this is considered pilaf.  Because you brown the onions first?  At any rate, this is a nice standard recipe for rice and a nice side dish.  It tasted good and I'll probably make it again.

Delicious!  It will be a favorite at our home from now on.  There are 6 in my family, so I doubled the recipe, used short grain rice and put it in my rice cooker....it came out perfect.  Definitely a keeper.

Thanks for this recipe.  I have made a similar one (with many variations) for years and find the proportions excellent. Turns out much better than 1 c. rice to 2 cups liquid.   Always well received.

A very flavorful but simple upgrade from plain rice.  We use jasmine rice and make the chicken broth from boullion cubes.  We really like onion flavoring, so we may go heavier than the recipe calls for, plus we add fresh ground pepper.  We'll be hard-pressed to eat 'plain old rice' again!

I also used a rice cooker, long grain rice and increased to 2 cups broth.  I actually left the onion out too and just put onion powder in it instead.  It turned out very well, I will try this one again for an easy side dish.  Thanks so much!

This is very tasty, and easy to prepare. Jazzes up white rice and adds extra flavour to a meal. Served with chicken and asparagus.

Light and delicious!  We served this with salmon and it accompanied the fish well.  It was quick and easy to make.

This is a good basic rice recipe. Unfortunately I didn't cook the rice long enough, but the flavor was good.

Didn't like this at all. Just rice with onion, and the broth didn't do anything for it, although I increased to 2 cups as well per other reviews.
