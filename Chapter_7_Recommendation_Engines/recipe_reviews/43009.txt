This recipe was very easy to make. They turned out perfectly, but they were very very crumbly. They were alot of fun to make, but I don't think I'll make them too often.

I followed the recipe to a T, and all I ended up with pancake looking cookies.

These cookies are heaven!!! I used dark chocolate kisses instead of the almond kisses, only because that is what I had on hand.  This recipe has made it to the top of my favorite cookie list!! Do not overmix dough. The consistency of the dough should be crumbly before forming into balls. One tip I would like to share is that I formed the dough into balls and then flattened them out slightly before pressing the bottom of the kiss into the dough.  I then pulled the dough up around the kiss, and rolled into balls again.
Cookies should be very tender, comparable to a Russian Teacake. It is a very easy and fun recipe, great for kids.

I used plain kisses and they still came out well.  Though, I had to use a littlor more than 1 tablespoon of dough to ensure the chocolates were covered.  They were a bit big, but still a hit.  (and did not make the 3 dozen mark because of it)
