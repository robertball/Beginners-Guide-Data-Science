Hubby really liked these. The finely diced onion is very nice. Tip - if the potato mixture will try to stick to your hands when forming the patties. I used an ice cream scoop and wet my hands. Placed a scoop of the mixture onto my wet hand and then gently flattened them into patties. You don't really need a half cup of oil - just enough to coat the bottom of a heavy non stick skillet.

Used this as a base to expand on....this is what I did/had on hand.  Had about 1 1/2 cups mashed potatoes from the previous night to which I added about 2 Tblsp. green chili sour cream, 2 Tblsp. chopped onion, the egg, a tsp. of a salt/pepper seasoning mix and about 1/2 cup flour (sorry, didn't measure exactly but added enough to make a somewhat thick (not pourable) batter) and two strips cooked bacon which I had chopped before cooking.  I used the remaining bacon grease, added a bit of cooking oil (not evoo) and about 2 Tblsp. Smart Balance to cook the cakes in.  Used a medium-size cookie scoop to measure and dropped them into the med-hot pan.  When I flipped them, I squished them down.  Will serve with more sour cream.  Have already tried them and they are DElish!  Enjoy!

I used leftover mashed potatoes and substituted green onions for the onions.  I found two eggs are necessary for 2 cups of potatoes.  Easy and really tasty, too.

O.....M.....G......

So good.  So very good.  I made these to serve with roasted chicken/spinach sausages as my spin on "bangers and mash".  I know that's a stretch, but that's was my inspiration when I decided to serve with sausage.

The amount of oil called for is more than what you really need.  I used maybe half and got great results.  I also followed another reviewer's advice and used half green onion and half yellow onion.  Wow.  The green onion really added something special to what was already a fantastic recipe.

Tip:  To make the actual cakes, I used an ice cream scoop and dropped scoops into the skillet (four at a time in a regular size round skillet).  I then sprayed the back of my spatula with cooking spray and flattened them into pancake size without the potatoes sticking to the spatula.  Worked like a charm.

I served with roasted chicken and spinach sausages and green beans on the side.  As others suggested, I served the cakes with sour cream.  HEAVENLY.   Thanks for the recipe.  It's a winner.

I used 3 green onions, and less flour, maybe 3/4 cup. Made one batch and it still very much like fried potatoes and sort of bland. So I added some shakes of garlic powder, paprika, added another egg and some grated cheese in the next batch, which took this to a five star for us. Great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes.

My 75 year old mother said they were the best potato cakes she has ever eaten in her life and she has sampled many. I added 1 tsp of garlic powder to flour mixture. I reserved a little of flour mixture to coat outside of cake. I found putting butter on my hands greatly helped to form cakes and keep them from sticking to my hands. I did fry them in one part butter to one part olive oil. Must admit they were pretty awesome. My husband asked that the next time I mash potatoes to make extra so there is plenty left for potato cakes.

I shaped these by hand and will use less oil next time (1/2 cup is way too much for these!)  This is a nice way to use up extra mashed  potatoes.  I served them with dollops of sour cream.  I will definitely make them again!

I made these potato cakes to go with roast pork loin and sauerkraut - definitely a winner! I did reduce the flour to 1/2 cup and used less oil as others suggested and these came out perfect. I will probably add a bit more salt and pepper next time. Thanks !!

Fine as a base recipe, as I view most recipes. 
Several reviews post concerns about being oily and bland but I suggest that these cooks need to mod the recipe to their liking and also understand simple physics and chemistry of cooking.

Solution to pancakes being too Oily: First address why you are using the oil. 
Thin layer on pan to assist with non-stick: use less oil but more frequently between batches.
Thick oil = deep fry or semi-deep fry. More oil+More Heat+Small batches= more stable cooking temperature for more consistent results.
Still oily: Your oil temp is not high enough, or you are placing too much in your pan while cooking thus resulting in the temperature of your oil dropping too much to effectively sear the outsides. To oversimplify: the concept of frying is to instantly sear the outsides of your substrate (pancake) keeping the moisture inside and the oil outside. Temp of oil for potatoes should be over 375f but should be under the smoke point of your oil - adjust temps based on your oil selection. Quantity of oil in your pan helps stabilize your temp while placing your batter in the pan.
Also remember that your pan also has properties that affect quality. Cast Iron and aluminum have a higher degree of heat radiation than does stainless steel (basic SS only, exceptions for multi-layered pans) meaning that SS does well to sear the outside while Cast Iron or aluminum will cook the inside to a greater degree by providing more heat above the surface of the pan.

These are delicious. And they do not have to be shaped by hand .... Just drop by spoon into a greased skillet to get the size of potato cakes  you want...4 inches or so is a good choice.... Easy!

Perfect breakfast.  Made with garlic rosemary potatoes from last night.  A dollop of sour cream on top and these were perfect.  Used a bit less flour and they were very stiff but cooked up nice.  My 1 1/2 year old made yummy noises as he ate his breakfast.

Very nice! Would make these again, skipped the vegetable oil and used Pam - sprayed both sides; spray the pan, then put the cakes in and then spray the tops. I keep them warm in the oven on a cookie sheet until I am ready to serve, cooked them in batches of 5. My new go to recipe for potato cakes! Thanks for sharing!

Turned out great! I only used about 1/3 cup Flour and added Onion Powder in place of onion.  Served  with sour cream and a side of Applesauce.  Perfect!

My husband is a very picky eater. I made these tonight and he loved them. I did make a few changes. I used less flour, just enough oil to coat the pan. I also added 1 tsp of baking powder. VERY GOOD! YUM!

My family loved them. Only thing I added was some seasonings per our families tastes (Emeril Essence, some garlic salt, onion powder). I didn't measure the oil, just coated bottom of pan. Kept them warm in the oven til served. Will definitely use this recipe again!

I left out the onion because I’m not a fan of them but they turned out great my husband has asked for his Moma’s potato cakes forever and since we lost her years ago I could never learn it from her. He said they were perfect and took him back to another time. So thank you very much for sharing.

Great recipe- I substituted Mrs. Dash for salt and instead of raw onion I used dried chopped onion and my best secret is to flatten patties wax paper. I glopped The mixture in the pan and then used wax paper to smash them flat -the wax paper does not stick to the patties

I didn't use exact measurements. I used what potatoes I had from last night and added flour until I had a sort of biscuit dough consistency. I also added a couple tbsp of good white cheddar and a can of diced green chiles. That  with the onion was delicious.

I thought it tasted a bit dough-y... maybe too much flour? I may try them again with less flour and add cheese and bacon crumbles.

I can verify that kids do love them, or at least mine did! They have a pleasant almost sweet flavor. The kids added ketchup, but I enjoyed plain. It's a great recipe as a starting off point! I made a few small changes based on something I saw Gordon Ramsey do in an episode of "Gordon Ramsey's Ultimate Home Cooking" ep 1: "The Food I Grew Up On."

I didn't really measure out the potatoes. I used 5 medium to large sized potatoes. As seasoning I left out the onion, and in the dough I used a few dashes of garlic and onion powder instead.
Instead of using the vegetable oil I used a drizzle of olive oil (just barely enough to coat the bottom of the pan) and then added in a few slivers of butter around them as they're cooking, but not too much because the butter will burn otherwise. You get the nice crispy edge and butter flavor, and not too much of that unhealthy vegetable oil splattering around.

Very good!  No one had ever had them before, as I don't recall ever having leftover mashed potatoes before, and I wouldn't originally thought to make mashed potatoes just for potato pancakes.  Everyone loved them and went back for seconds!

Pretty good, and tasted like what I remember potato pancakes tasting like. Found them to be rather thick; would most likely make the pancakes half the size/thickness next time. These went well with applesauce and sour cream (not at the same time). I would add extra salt and pepper and probably some parsley, as the flavor was just slightly lacking compared to what I grew up with.

Love the taste of these, and they are so simple and easy to make. I had some leftover mashed potatoes that i needed to use and i find this recipe. This was the first time that i have ever had this and i must say they were good and the family loved them too.

I found them to not have much taste. I even added cheese to the mixture. But I would try them again

I grew up eating these with the added ingredient of 1 can of drained whole kernel sweet corn. Around 20 years ago, I started adding 1/4 cup of diced bell pepper as well.

You cannot mess these up!  Very forgiving recipe for whatever mashed potatoes are leftover. If I have green onions, in they go. Ditto parsley. More or less flour—still works. I use an ice cream scoop to place in a hot, lightly oiled pan, then flatten with bottom of a measuring cup. We never have enough!

Too much flour. They tasted like flour. Would try either without flour or much less (maybe 1/4 cup). These could be good, so will try again.

Melted cheese on some not bad , believe I will mix shredded cheese into the dough next time. I don't like the way cheese slices look after they melt and made the cheese presence a little more overwhelming than I would have liked.

I made a double batch.  It was really hard work.  I cooked 8 potatoes and added enough milk and margarine for them to have some creaminess. I also added paprika, minced garlic and seasoned salt. I did not remove any skins. I used my trusty dusty hand potato masher. Added milk and margarine as needed. 

When I finally had them at a decent consistency (with a few lumps) I started putting scoopfulls of the mixture into a big fry pan with a layer of evoo. Flattened them with a metal spatula. They turned out great but were certainly a lot of work!! 

Served them with pulled chicken in cr of mush soup gravy along with vege salad, broiled asparagus, green beans.

Everyone from papa, mama, daughter, to grandkids loved them.

I made this using the 1 cup of flour. My husband asked if I was making paper mache? 1 cup of flour is to much cut that in half. Then they was good, I also but chives in them.

Perfect receipt for left over mashed potato cakes.  Might add more onions next time but that's a personal preference.

I made these tonight.  Initially I added the flour, egg, potatoes, onion and salt and pepper.  I tried to stir the ingredients  to make a batter, but the consistency was too dry, so I added about 3/4 to 1 cup of milk.  Also added 1/2 tsp. of garlic and another egg.  This worked.  I filled the frying pan with about 1/8 in deep vegetable oil and began frying on medium high heat.  They took about 5 minutes on each side as the recipe stated.  Very tasty.  Will make them again.

Yummy...used half the amount of flour & oil.  Also mixed in a couple of tablespoons of butter w/the oil.  Sprinkles of garlic salt & grated cheese put it over the top.  Had it once for breakfast and leftovers for supper with chicken & veggies.  It's a keeper!

Love these, I used green onions as well. I only had a little over 1 cup of left over mashed yukon gold potatoes, so I halved the flour but still used 1 egg and it was delicious. Next time I will use much less oil since I use a teflon pan.

I have never had a potato pancake in my life, so I'm not really sure what it was supposed to taste like.  I had some left over mashed potatoes in the fridge and decided to give frying them a try.  I don't know what I was expecting.  I just didn't think the end result of this recipe  was spectacular.

It worked out very  well but I added some parsley, dill and garlic powder.  I also used Italian style bread crumbs instead of flour.  And used less oil as suggested by one reviewer.   Yum, yum.  Thanks for this great idea for leftover mashed potatoes.  Will use again.

Batter was way too thick for me, had to add a lot of milk to it.  It tasted ok in the end, but I prefer my potato pancakes better where you actually grate the potatoes  not mash or shred them.  may try again but use less flour and add  milk.

I followed the recipe but used minced onion (1 T) and fried in butter not oil...I think it had too much flour...planning to cut it back if I try it again...I LOVED my mom's potato cakes,  hers always tasted fab! I think I simply have to find the correct combo of potato, egg, and flour...

Ah! the flavours from my youth. These potatoes took me back to when I tried eating the flour and water paste we used to stick pictures in our scrap books 60 years ago. It was great, thank you. I had forgotten that taste and texture.

These were super easy and quick to make. I had to substitute onion powder for diced onion because my toddler wouldn’t have eaten them otherwise, but i definitely plan on making them again.

Was kinda leary on this.  Made it with my leftover spuds.  Wow what a hit.  My husband had two.  I will make these again.  Much better than my  Mom's was.  Keep your heat on medium high and watch them carefully.  Great breakfast item!

I didn't have onion, so I added some chopped, dried chives to the mix. I think the green was a great colour idea. My husband took the leftovers to work the next morning. I might also consider adding some garlic flakes in future.

Made these using 3 cups of mashed potatoes, one egg, 1/2 tsp each salt, pepper, and onion powder and 3/4 cup flour.  Made into 7 patties, spritzed with olive oil and fried them in my airfryer at on potato setting at 400 degrees for 14 minutes, turning over half way through the cooking time.  They were very good.  Passed the husband and grandson test!  Will definitely make these again!

This was a good, classic recipe.  They were easy to make.  I would highly suggest adding a little more seasoning to them as you make them, because the flavor was lacking slightly.  But other than that, I have zero complaints.  My family enjoyed them!

I read another review saying they are bland. I'm not a spicy person, but these are horrible. All we could taste was flour and egg.  Maybe use italian bread crumbs instead of flour?

I added a small amount of shredded cheddar and chopped green onion.  I thought the finished cakes were a bit chewy.  I didn't care for the texture, but loved how they stayed intact as they cooked.

I made them just as written so I will review. These were outstanding. Remind me of my grandma's house. She always used up leftovers but these weren't leftovers to me.

I will definitely make this again. I finally made potato cakes that didn't fall apart, had some flavor, and there were no leftover leftovers! Added some finely chopped green peppers. Oh, and I used my leftover instant mashed potatoes!!

These were OK but I prefer shredded potatoes for my pancakes instead.  I cut down on the flour and still was a bit stiff.

These were a big hit.  My onions were chopped a day or two ahead and were bigger than I would have liked, but it still turned out good.

The mixture was sticky, but I used two spoons to put into the pan.

Someone complained they were oily and bland, but you need to start with a hot pan.  Make a small cake first and taste to make sure they have enough salt and pepper.

I had about 1 1/2 cups of mashed potatoes on hand. I added an extra egg & used about 3/4 cup of flour. I only used about a 1/4 of oil and didn't press the batter, they weren't really greasy after draining.  I also added diced bacon and some shredded cheddar cheese. They turned out so good! I will definitely make again ??

This recipe has been in my family for generations. The only change I ever make is to add onion powder if I'm too lazy to dice onion. Also, I typically make these from leftover mashed potatoes.

I used two cups garlic mashed potatoes, one egg, approx. 1/3 cup of flour, and maybe a tablespoon or two of oil in the cast iron pan.  These held together well and were great with fried eggs and hot sauce.

As others suggested, I added another egg, some sour cream, and cut the flour back to about half. Other than that, I followed the cooking instructions exactly. They tasted great, but I had the most difficult time getting them to cook. I found I had to turn the heat up, add more oil, and really flatten them out once I flipped them over. The key seems to be to make very small, thin cakes. I thought this was going to be a quick, easy undertaking, but I was in the kitchen for well over an hour trying to get these things to cook. My rating is based on taste, rather than the experience, but I don't think I will make them again.

I made these for my boyfriend and I, and we loved them! The onion gave a pleasant flavour.  They are VERY filling.

I used olive oil to cook them, and added half a teaspoon of Italian Style seasoning (blend of Basil, Oregano and Thyme) to the ingredients.

My boyfriend likes them so much he now makes them!

I added some grated cheese and omitted the onions as the kids don't like them (added some garlic seasoning to compensate) - didn't use oil at all as the mash had plenty of butter in them, once fried off I put them in the oven for a few mins on high - even the 'fussy' one  thought they were delish!!

I've been making these pancakes for years and I've tried other ones that claim to be the best, but have never found ones as good as these. The only things I do different is that I add a tsp of vanilla, and I melt the butter but then add it to the mixing cup of milk and whisk before adding to the dry mix. These are my favorite! By far

These reminded me of potato latkes, just creamier and thicker. Since my potatoes already had green onion in them (and some horseradish, as well), I didn't add a large amount of onion. I also used about 1/2 cup of flour and added some onion and garlic powder and a little paprika.  A few tblsps of oil was all that I needed for frying. Since I like a little sugar with latkes, I tried these with sugar and some plain Greek yogurt on the side (in place of sour cream). Very good recipe!

These potato pancakes were perfect; exactly what I had a taste for.  I made them almost exactly as the recipe states.  I added 2 cloves of minced garlic.  I used two eggs as another reviewer suggested.  I also did not use the 1-1/2 Cups of oil for cooking.  I just put (corn) oil in the pan until it seemed right.   There is another recipe on here (Potato Cake recipe by Dave Silsby) which is nearly the same recipe., just uses less flour.  I liked the grated cheese in the middle idea in that one so I did do that.  It was delicious.  Either recipe would work fine, but I chose this one with 1 Cup of Flour.  I wanted a recipe using leftover mashed potatoes.  I found that pouring a little bit of oil on my hands kept the potato cakes from sticking.  I think I did fry them about 7 minutes per side -- mine were pretty big and I wanted to be sure the flour cooked.  They could not have turned out better and I thank you very much for submitting this fantastic recipe.  We ate ours with fried eggs -- but I put some applesauce on part of one and mmmm, delicious.

Yummy! Had lots of leftover mashed potatoes and didn't know what to do with them - this is the perfect recipe! The onion added so much flavor! I didn't use quite a cup of flour (as per other reviewers), but honestly, I think it would have been fine just as written. Will definitely make again!

Loved them. Hubby doesn't like potato pancakes but he did these. Only thing I did different was add some garlic powder. 
What can I say, we like garlic.

Love potato cakes:-)
I used 2 eggs, 1/2 c flour for changes and fried in non stick fry pan with 1/4 c oil. Fry on medium until a nice golden crisp color. I served these for breakfast with a sunny side up egg on top with a side of ham. Best breakfast award! If you have leftover mashed potatoes, you must try these. I like a dollop of sour cream on top of these also. I mixed these on low in my food processor and the consistency was perfect. They made a nice mound which I flattened in my hands before frying. Now I have to make lots more mashed potatoes so I have leftover to make these soon. They are a nice accompliment for any meal.

29 Dec 2015: Just like my Mom's!  I wouldn't change a thing!  My husband said the same regarding his Moms recipe as well.  We had not had them in years and they tasted just like when I was growing up at home, many, many years ago.  Thank you for sharing, these brought back wonderful memories!
 1 Jan 2016: Update:  Hubby asked me to make them again for New Years day even along side the pinto beans and ham and the cornbread.  LOL!

Only substitution was whole wheat flour. There was no "batter consistency", and that probably had to do with the firmness of the mashed potatoes to begin with (I make my potatoes pretty dense).

With the amount of flour called for in the recipe, I found them to be gnocchi-like. The family said that they thought they were too heavy.

If I make them again, I would cut back considerably on the amount of flour added. You really only need enough to bind with the egg and keep them from falling apart during cooking.

made this tonight on the fly, so my ingredients were a tiny bit different, but they came out absolutely incredible.

I have to use gluten free flours so it came out a little chewy, for I didn't even have  g.f. all purpose flour on hand. but...I really liked these even so. Didn't have onion on hand but used dried onion flakes.i did not fry these on top of stovetop, but put potato in cast iron skillet in the oven with about 1/8 of an inch of coconut oil. Looked just like the picture.(golden brown) soft in the center, though I baked too long(20min) darn! I was damaged as a child having to eat potato cakes. This is the first time since. (40yrs?) this is a 
keeper!

These were delicious! The only things I added were garlic powder and an extra egg(as some previous reviewers did). I felt the extra egg made them difficult to handle and shape. Next time I will try them with just the one egg as the recipe calls for.

Sauteed the onions first with garlic and added chives & white cheddar.  Otherwise followed to the T.  REALLY good!  Even my picky 11 year old asked if I could make them for Thanksgiving.  Will definitely make again with my mashed leftovers.
