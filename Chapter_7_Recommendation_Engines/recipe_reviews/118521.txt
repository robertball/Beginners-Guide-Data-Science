This was quick and easy.  Served it with garlic bread to the kids for lunch.  They liked it.  I didn't have canned beef broth so I used bullion cubes.

My son and I couldn't even stand to eat one bowl of it and soup is my favorite type of meal. I wouldn't recommend making it, almost anything else would be better.

I have tried several times now to make good homemade soups, but this is the first keeper!  I didn't have alphabet pasta so I used egg noodles instead.  I used italian frozen mixed vegetables (carrots, zucchini, cauliflower, peas)  because I didn't have any regular frozen mixed veggies.  This recipe turned out wonderful, I had similar on hand ingredients, and it was healthy.  Thanks for the post!

Easy & really good.  I added cooked ground beef to the vegetable broth while it was simmering.  The whole family really liked it.

VERY VERY simple to make.  It was nice and warm in my tummy.  It worked for what we were craving and my fiance loved the alphabets!

very tasty and yet i did make a few adjustments according to our taste and what was available in the kitchen.  i had rice pasta shells instead of the alphabet type. i sauteed a little red bell pepper & then a little minced garlic as some of the mixed veggies (mine were fresh celery, frozen peas and frozen green beans) and lastly i added a bit of dried parsley.  yummy - thanks.
