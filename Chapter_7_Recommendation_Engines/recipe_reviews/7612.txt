This is heaven! Thanks to other reviewers' comments, I made one major change. This is a lot of batter, and it would have overflowed my pan and been a disaster. So: I filled the Bundt pan to within 1.5" of the top and put the remaining in an 8 x 8 pan. I kept the baking time the same. They both turned out beautifully, and everyone raved! Also, I used 1/2 tsp. almond extract, 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract, which was great; and I used 12 oz. of mini chocolate chips (the regular-size chips would be too overpowering, too chunky). This is the best chocolate cake I've ever, ever had. One small slice is very rich (and addictive). I will definitely be making this a lot. It's really easy, too. Just be sure to really grease (butter) the Bundt pan. I did (I even had a Teflon Bundt pan, and stuff still sticks) and the cake slipped out wonderfully. Presentation is gorgeous: I swirled chocolate sauce on the plate, dusted it with confectioners' sugar, which I had also used to dust the top of the cake; and served with a small side of best-quality vanilla ice cream.

I made this cake twice and the first time it flopped.  I read through reviews with one star and found mine flopped exactly the way others did.  It fell after being taken out of the oven and was a gooey mess.  So I spoke to someone who does cake making professionally and to make a long story short I found I had overprocessed it.  I use a kitchenaid mixer which is more powerful than a hand held and I used the whisk attachment instead of the paddle attachment.  So when I remade it I followed her instructions which were to mix the eggs, sour cream, butter, and vanilla together really well.  Then I sifted the cake mix and pudding together and added the wet ingredients to dry and processed it for 2 min with the paddle attachment. This time I was successful.  It made a very rich very chocolaty cake.  My friend also said another reason cakes fall is the oven is not hot enough and so check your oven temperature with an oven thermometer and make sure the temperature isn't too low.

This cake was fantastic.  A personal tip that I think would have helped all of the folks that had so much trouble . . . make sure you buy cake mix that DOES NOT already have pudding in the mix.  I bet some people accidentally had double the pudding.  Some other people's tips that I followed - 1 Tblsp of flour mixed in the mini chips before adding to batter. Really butter the non-stick bundt pan and leave 1 1/2 inches space between batter and top of pan.  There will be batter left over.  Vanilla instead of almond extract.  Ovens vary so watch the cake carefully - mine was done in 60 minutes.  Let the cake rest for 10 minutes and you will notice it falling significantly.  That is supposed to happen.  That's why the cake turns out so dense and fudgy!  We drizzled the cake with a dark chocolate ganache and filled the center hole with fresh raspberries and chocolate leaves.  It looked like something from Better Homes and Gardens!  My 8 year old son won Most Chocolatey Cake at his Cub Scout cake auction.  It also set a record for most money paid for a cake - $31.00!

I read many review on this recipe before I tried it.  I took many of the recommendations listed and for those of you who have yet to try this recipe, I will share with you the success I had with this wonderful cake (so you don't have to waste time reading them)!  First, I did use an angel food cake pan so that I wouldn't have the overflow problem.  I sprayed it with cooking spray and floured it to prevent sticking.  I had absolutely no trouble getting it out of the pan.  I did bake in a dark (non stick coated)pan and had to decrease the oven temp. to 325.  I increased the baking time to about 65 minutes.  I used 2c. MINI chocolate chips that I mixed with 1 T. flour before mixing them into the batter.  I used the vanilla instead of almond extract.  When I took the cake out of the oven, I let it cool for 10 minutes in the pan and then inverted it onto a plate.  It came out perfect.  I made a chocolate glaze (which I chose from this website) and poured over while still hot.  I allowed it to cool completely before serving.  All the members of my family of 5 were in agreement that this recipe deserves a 10+ rating!!I'm sure I will be using it many times over.  Enjoy!

5-STAR all-the-way! I followed the recipe exactly, except I made these subsitutions:

*Mini dark-chocolate chips (tossed in 1 tbsp of flour) as opposed to the reg. choc. chips

And added: 

*The "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" (recipe from allrecipes.com) and drizzled it on the cake

*Mixed reg. and white choc. chips together (1 cup each) and sprinkled over the icing, before the glaze set

*NOTE!!!!! I do not have a bundt pan nor an Angel food cake pan.  INSTEAD-I bought a "Flex Form" silicone pinwheel cake pan from Walmart for 6.99. and thoroughly greased and floured it.  

After the cake cooled, the sides virtually rolled down and the cake was absolutely perfect.

With or without the icing and choc. chips, this recipe is simply outstanding.

VERY IMPORANTANT SIDE NOTES:  I added sliced strawberries inside the middle hole of the cake, thus, refridgeration was required.  This somewhat altered the texture and taste, which was very disappointing.  Plus, the next day, the berries were wilting and obviously changed the appearance.  Next time, I will not refridgerate the cake, and the berries will be kept separately and cut just before serving.  DO NOT forget the powdered sugar, which adds class to every dessert.

LOW FAT SUBSITUTIONS:  I have tried this recipe one time with egg whites and low fat sour cream.  It was decent, but not as decadent as with the real thing.

I'm neither a dessert lover nor a cake lover, but his recipe takes the cake!

It's easy to make, even a non-baker like me gets it right every time. 

I bake this in an angel food pan and then top it off with a chocolate ganache made by heating one cup whipping cream, removing from the heat and stirring in one cup chopped semi-sweet chocolate. Stir till smooth. Pour on top of the cake and let it drizzle down the sides. Refrigerate and talk about decadent!

This cake is incredible!  I make a lot of different cakes for work and my co-workers tell me this one is the best yet.  I decided to sprinkle powdered sugar over the top and then drizzled Hershey's Double Chocolate Sundae Syrup over it when it was cool to make it look better.  Hint:  When you are baking it, put a cookie sheet underneath, because it overflows a bit.

Can't think of a more rich, dense, chocolatey cake that I've had!  All I had was fat free sour cream, but it turned out just fine.  I had to bake it longer than 55 minutes because it was so dense.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent and simple to make cake.  I warmed up my slice in the microwave to soften up the chocolate chips for about 20 seconds and it was great.  I would say you could even omit the chips and it would still be very good.

This cake was quite smooth and moist. It did develop some cracks, though - almost too soft to cut properly. I served it with a raspberry cream topping and it was very tasty.

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving. Everyone young and old loved it. I did not change a thing, and I don't think there is anything you could do to make it better. I will definately make this again.

UPDATE: 2nd Review.
TRY IT IN VANILLA!!! Not sure if anyone has made this suggestion yet so I thought I would. I've made this cake so many times (see first review below) and made a vanilla version for my "allergic to chocolate" husband. It was amazing and I think I like it better than the chocolate. I used a Duncan Hines French Vanilla cake mix and a vanilla pudding. Used vanilla extract and omitted the chocloate chips. I cut the baking time by about 5-10 minutes so it's extra moist. It's best served at room temp. I also used a cream cheese icing on top. You have got to try it! First review:
Wow! What a delicious cake. Everyone raves whenever I make it... and I make it a lot. Just to make it even more rich, I drizzle melted Lindt chocolate on top and sprinkle it with white and dark chocolate curls! This makes an otherwise not-so-pretty cake look fabulous.

I am not a fan of your typical chocolate cake, but this is phenomenal. I have never taken it anywhere where they haven't raved over it. It is very dense and has almost a fudgy consistency to the slices when you cut it. Very, very flavorful without being TOO rich. I always substitute vanilla extract for the almond, as I don't care for that particular flavor. I think the vanilla gives a nice rich homemade taste to this cake. This is now the only chocolate cake I will make. Be advised that the batter is VERY stiff and you almost have to spread it in your bundt pan, so don't be alarmed!

OH MY GOSH! This was the absolute best cake I have ever eaten! Thank you so much for posting this recipe, you really saved me. We were invited to a dinner party and I offered to bring dessert. I love to bake, but needed the PERFECT dessert. The taste is amazing! It definately reminded me and several of the guests of brownies. I made a few adjustments though- I did not have almond extract, so I used vanilla. I had to increase baking time by about 10 minutes because it was not quit done. I used a chocolate glaze, filled the middle with whole strawberry's, and then placed sliced strawberry's all over the top. I then drizzled a little strawberry glaze over the top, and around the edges for presentation, and finally I sprinkled a little powder sugar over it all. I had so many compliments, and the best part is I came home with none. Which told me this was a winner!

This cake was FABULOUS!  I made this for someone's birthday and it was a huge hit!  I read all the reviews first which were very helpful.  I used a the pan recommended and the batter came within an inch of the top so I didn't need an additional pan.I greased the pan w/ butter and used 12oz. mini chips.Sifted together the pudding mix and cake mix (no pudding in the cake mix!) and added to the already mixed eggs, sour cream, butter and almond extract. Add wet to dry! Processed for 2 minutes w/ paddle stand mixer. This cake came out of the pan really well and did not stick. I cooked down some frozen raspberries, added a little sugar and drizzled on top of the cake.  Sweet icing would have been too much on this already rich cake. I figured out the Weight Watcher points plus for this cake to be 17 points per serving (minus the raspberries) and it was worth every point!!!  I'll make this cake again for sure!!

Okay, I am definitely one to modify a recipe, but not this one!  I followed it verbatim except that I did not have my bundt pan available so I used 2-9inch round pans.  I was worried when the batter was so thick, but this didn't pose to be a problem. The cake rose perfectly and was very moist and chocolately.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Just as an FYI because I had to double check for myself! A 12oz bag of semi-chocolate chips = 2 cups and a 16oz container of sour cream = 2 cups :) Thanks for the great recipe.

I would give this 6 if I could. That good. I have never needed to deviate from the original recipe. Except maybe to add extra chips- seriously perfect recipe. I have been baking this recipe for several years. It's my go to.

My oh my, that's a good chocolate cake.  The only thing I varied was I only used a half bag of chips.  And instead of a bundt pan I used three 8" round pans, baked about 35 minutes, and made a layer cake.  The hint of almond flavor makes people wonder what that tiny little extra something is.   This is the best cake I've ever had, period.  Thanks for sharing!

I've made a version of this cake before and loved it.  I misplaced my recipe and made this recipe for my son's Cub Scout Cake Walk.  Paired with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze also from this site he won a blue ribbon for "Most Delicious Looking Cake."

I made this for a New Year's Eve party.  YUM!  Turned out great.  Actually, I made this twice for the party.  I read the reviews and noted how others said to really, REALLY, grease up the pan so it turns out.  Then in another review I read that you should put this upside down on a wine bottle (or some such) so the cake doesn't fall.  Can you gues where I'm going with this?  Yep, as I was trying to turn in over onto the wine bottle, the whole thing fell out, all over my counter.  Oops.  Made it again, and just let it sit in the pan until I turned it out on a cooling rack.  I don't believe it fell at all.  When I greased up the bunt pan, I sprinkled coco powder in the bottom.  I didn't want any white from flour on my cake. I also read that it's better the next day, so I too made this a day ahead of time. LOL, Fortunately for my family, they had the first one to snack on.  I used a Chocolate Ganache, then striped some White Cho. ganache over that.  Then I did as the pictures, and added chocolate covered strawberries inside the hole and around the base of the cake.  Looks so pretty and professional.  Try this, you won't be sorry.

Wonderful and moist!  However, we had to cook this about 30 minutes longer than the recipe suggested and it still came out moist in the middle.  Could be due to cooking ours in a silicone bundt pan.  Highly recommend silicone bundt pan because it pops right out without any sticking or breaking apart, and it was only $6.00 for the pan.  Used a 1/2 cup whipping cream (heated) stirring in 1 cup semi-sweet choc. chips for the icing drizzled over the top, and strawberries in the middle.  Very yummy!

When my friend made it, 5+ stars. When I made it, the middle didn't finish, it sank, and the top was dried and cracked. Next time, maybe 60 minutes and 1/4 c water to keep it moister and reduce the thickness of the batter. Maybe 1 less egg too. Also, I appreciate the suggestions to keep it 1.5 inches from the top of the bundt pan and make an 8x8 with the leftover batter.

This cake is great! It almost doesn't need any frosting. It is really moist but very rich and heavy, so you may want to eat a huge piece, but usually a small piece will do. I used dark chocolate chips in mine, and a cup of vegetable oil instead of the butter. I agree with another reviwer's recommendation: do NOT use a cake mix that already has pudding in the mix! I used a devil's food cake mix and it was delicious. This cake is best when served a little warm, so the chocolate chips are soft. It's great with ice cream.

AMAZING!!!! I can't tell you how perfect this cake turns out, every time! All of my friends want the recipe and when they ask what's in it, I don't feel comfortable telling them 2 cups of sour cream, 5 eggs and two sticks of butter. It is delicious but def. not heart smart. But when it's brought to a party, it's always a hit! Always! I've never made any changes and never will. Oh, and it goes well with Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze by tunisianswife. Perfect one two punch...lol.

I've made this cake several times.  Be sure that you use a big enough bunt pan (fill the bundt pan leaving at least 2" from the top of the pan - otherwise the cake will overflow).  I've started using mini chocolate chips (vs. the regular sized ones)because they melt completely.  Sometimes the regular size chips don't melt completely - nothing wrong with this (still is delicious), but I prefer them to be melted.  I do not make any changes to this recipe.  I use the Whipped cream cream cheese icing found at Allrecipes.com and shave chocolate on top at the end.  This is a fabulous chocolate cake recipe - and simple to make!  Enjoy!

Hi! :) Reading advice throughout reviews, each baker, of course, will have different results. 65 mins w/ my oven. Taking almond out, replacing with vanilla actually makes this an "ordinary" chocolate cake. That hint of almond, a note of "what IS that special, wonderful flavor" is part of what makes this cake unique. The almond also brings out the chocolate flavor even more. And much depends on the pan you use, I bake in a copper bundt pan, required just a light spray of canola (Pam equivalent), each time I've made it, slips right out without a crumb left in the pan...it absolutely "falls" as it sets/cools the first 10 minutes. As others mentioned, this is part of what gives it dense, chocolatey yumminess. I've made it (by request) many times. Each time, perfect results after following the recipe exactly. I've never had extra batter, makes the perfect amount for a 10 inch bundt pan. For bakers without a lifetime of experience, advice to "mix chocolate chips with flour" could ruin the recipe if  the reason and method is not understood. I use a sieve or colander (depending on size of holes so chips don't fall through)...chips or other additions (such as heavy choc chips or fruit etc) tend to sink to the bottom (like blueberries in muffins) a light coating of flour keeps chips etc, distributed evenly throughout the batter. You don't want to "mix" with flour, additional flour would alter the final result. I suggest as little additional flour as possible, sieve works great:) Enjoy!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I made a full course meal for my mom on Mother's Day and she said this was the best part! She asked for something chocolate and I gave her chocolate! She has renamed this "Mother's Day Cake" because I am now supposed to make this every Mother's Day. Literally the best cake I have ever had in my life! I put Hershey's syrup and fresh raspberries all over the cake after it cooled and it was heaven on a plate!

Totally yummy cake. Not a difficult recipe to follow (and I am NOT a baker). My 9 yr old son and I made this and took it to a holiday gathering- it was a hit! Moist and mmmm. Of note: ton of batter, as has been mentioned, so definitely messy; we sprinkled the choc chips in a layer in the middle of the batter (very thick batter) instead of incorporating and it was an awesome 'extra'. We used a bundt pan and dusted it w powdered sugar to present.

Yummy!  I wanted to try a new chocolate cake recipe and this seemed like a good option.  It's very similar to another very popular one on this site.  I followed the recipe to a "T" except I used a pudding in the mix Devil's Food cake mix and cook and serve pudding mix as that was what I had on hand.  The  results were excellent but I do agree with one reviewer who said 2 cups of sour cream was a bit of overkill.  The other recipe calls for 1 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup warm water along w/cooking oil instead of the butter and they taste equally as good.  As the two recipes are so similar, I will probably continue to use the other one to cut a few of the calories and some of the fat. All in all an excellent cake, however!

Came out perfect. Before serving, I dust it with powdered sugar or drizzle chocolate sauce on top. Always a hit at dinner parties. You'd never know it was from a cake mix! Very rich, great texture.

Excellent.  First time I made it I topped with chocolate ganache but after tasting it, I sifted confectioners sugar on top for the second one.  I have the third in the oven now.  After reading about the overflow problem, I make 6 cupcakes with additional batter and it comes out just right.  This cake is delicious and perfect to serve for any occasion or just because it's really, really tasty!

This was the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted! Being from the south, I have access to some of the best tried and true chocolate cake recipes, so I was a skeptic about trying a recipe from a web site.I made it exactly as the recipe stated. Being an absolute chocolate lover I iced it with my favorite chocolate glaze. 3 Milky Way Bars melted with 6 tbls margarine. Delicious and a keeper!

I made this cake for my Dad's 62nd birthday, and after tasting it, he said (quote) "This is, by far, the best cake I've ever put in my mouth!"  It was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!  Allow me to suggest an addition to this cake that made the flavors INCREDIBLE!

Thaw one small bag of frozen raspberries and drain juice into a bowl.  Set raspberries and juice aside.  When you are ready to pour the cake mixture into the Bundt pan, only pour in about half.  Then, layer the top of the mixture with the drained raspberries.  Then pour the rest of the cake mixture into the Bundt pan and bake.

While it's baking, pour your raspberry juice into a small saucepan and cook at medium heat.  Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine 1 Tbsp cornstarch and 1 Tbsp COLD water and stir.  When the raspberry juice begins to simmer and bubble, add the cornstarch water and stir.  The cornstarch will thicken the juice into a rich, AMAZING cake sauce.  When serving the cake, pour the sauce generously on the cake slices.  Your guests will be completely floored.  I can't wait to make it for my Mom & Stepdad!

Wonderful and delicious! Followed recipe exactly. Sprayed large non-stick bundt pan with cooking spray (don't need any flour in the pan)- and filled it, it baked perfectly in 50 minutes, didn't overflow, and after cooling 10 minutes, slide perfectly onto the plate.

I recommend following this recipe pretty closely, but omitting the almond extract. The first time I made this recipe, I followed it exactly and it turned out a dream (I had also omitted the almond by accident, and used a larger Bundt pan.) The second time I made it, I added almond, and substituted white chocolate chips, and I made it in a cake round. This made for huge complications. The cake overflowed out of the pan, took at least 20 minutes longer to cook (and wasn't cooked evenly), it tasted sticky like bad caramel, and was really disappointing given how good it had been the first time.

Some recommendations: add some raspberry jam to the cake, and some powdered sugar. It enhances the flavor of vanilla ice cream or raspberry sorbet. Also make sure to use a 12" Bundt pan!

This recipe produced so much batter it overflowed from my 10 inch bundt pan while baking. The taste was good- very fudgy, but not any better than the standard "Chocolate Better Than Sex Cake" which uses only 1 cup of sour cream and 4 eggs.

I honestly don't know why it didn't recieve a perfect 5, I read some of the reviews and was hesitant to make the cake, because of the instructions and complaints.. I did change a few things to avoid the cake from flopping or not expanding correctly.. After reading the reviews! I added 1/2 water and did 4 eggs instead of five, and also I did 2 hershey bars broken into pieces for chocoloate chunks. I also ran out of buter and imporvised by adding 1/3 oil.. I was very hesitant but it came up very superb... My husband loved it he said it was the best chocolate cake ever! Also for frosting Hint: I did chocolated pudding mixed with cool whip and put on cake then put cake in refrigerate.... Oh it is to die for, just had some with cofee and I had to ply myself away!!!

I tested 4 chocolate cake recipes at the same time with similar ingredients and this cake was a good one. My first choice was the Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe and the Double Chocolate Brownie Cake recipe. I sprinkle my chocolate cakes with powdered sugar after it has cooled, no need for frosting.

Simply THE BEST!!! I cooked exactly as stated and made it for a suprise birthday party I hosted. Everyone LOVED it!! I filled the center of the cake with chocolate chips to raise it up and placed chocolate strawberries in the center and around the rim of the cake. I addded some chocolate frosting as well by marbeling white and milk chocolate together and letting it drip over the sides. To top it off I took white chocolate and made little white hearts on the dipped strawberries. Wow did this cake look professional and was to die for!!!! MAKE THIS CAKE!!!

Let me first tell you that I am one of the 3 people in the country that are not big chocolate fans.  I know, I know, what's wrong with me?!  So I needed some help when I decided to make a cake for my mother-in-law's birthday.....she is one of the 5 billion chocolaholics.  She loved it!  The whole family loved it and I also tried and piece and I even loved it.  It's so easy to make too.

Great recipe!

Outstanding recipe, Susan! Everyone wanted the recipe to this chocolate-lovers dream! It was rich and moist. Most of us felt that the almond flavoring really enhanced the chocolate and sour cream. I will try vanilla as others have suggested, but for now, I am really pleased with the results as written. Thanks for sharing.

I brought this cake to a friend's house- 5 of us were playing a game and we ALL had second helpings. I have never had such a moist cake. I melted and stirred in my chocolate chips, because the first time I made the cake we didn't like that the chips went hard when the cake cooled- it kind of made the cake texture a little wierd, but that could be just us. I want to try a white version!!

Oh my STARS!!!  This is one incredible cake!  I made it for dinner guests on Tuesday, and my husband asked me to make it again on Thursday.  We are not a family of cake eaters, yet we cannot get enough of this.  So YUMMY!  The first time I was out of almond extract, so I used rum extract and it was delicious.  The second time I used almond and it was equally good.  It does tend to run over - I put a little less in the pan the second time around and had no problems.  I also baked it at 375 the second time because the first time it took about 20 minutes longer than the recipe stated.  This is from now on my chocolate cake recipe...

I loved this sinful recipe!  I followed the directions exactly and did notice the cake baked a bit out of the bundt pan.  I recommend not filling the pan more than 2/3rds full.  Also, butter the pan, even if it's a non-stick.  The cake slid out perfectly and I dusted it with confectioners sugar.  I would also try either eliminating or reducing the amount of almond extract and perhaps replacing it with vanilla.  I also used low fat sour cream.  Not that it helps much!  If was perfectly done in 50 min.

Best Chocolate Cake ever!  Didn't have quite enough low fat sour cream so I used 1/2 C. of Greek Non Fat Yogurt to so that I'd have 2 C. worth of that sour cream portion and it still turned out AWESOME!  All the kids have asked if I'll make this as their Birthday Cakes from now on!!

This is a wonderful recipe! I agree that it makes too much for one bundt cake, so another alternative is to purchase single serve size bundt cake pans to manage the overflow. Also, I think I will prepare it with bittersweet chocolate next time, as I am more of a chocoholic. I used the "Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze" from this site. It was more than enough for this cake, so it will provide enough glaze for additional mini's as well...however; once again, I think I will use the bittersweet chocolate for it next time. Both recipes are very good, and VERY simple to make. Thank you for sharing these recipes with us all!

Delicious!  I only had a cake mix with pudding already in it so I used that without adding the box of pudding called for in the recipe.  Used vanilla instead of almond (personal preference).  Also, I don't like chunks of chocolate in my cake so I melted the chips (1/2 dark and 1/2 semi-sweet) and added it in at the end of the mixing.  Sprinkled powdered sugar on top.  Turned out very moist and delicious! Will make again!

I made this for my coworkers and 3/4 of the cake was gone in 30 mins! I've actually been asked to remake it this week b/c many people missed out. It is actually very easy to follow.  Pay heed to others advice of using mini chocolate chips and spray the pan VERY well.    **8/9/09 Made this in a vanilla form (French Vanilla mix, vanilla pudding, vanilla chips) and everyone loved it as well! I made 3 layers and put strawberry preserves between each layer. I frosted the cake with vanilla frosting and topped with coconut. It was a hit.

This cake is fabulous.  The batter is very thick and I had enough to fill my bundt pan and make 6 cupcakes.  I did sub the mini chocolate chips and was glad I did.  My cake did fall some, but not enough to get upset about.  I definitely suggest mixing the wet ingredients in one both, the dry in a second and then slowly and gently mix just until it is all moistened to help with that problem.  It was a wonderful cake that I will definitely make again.  My entire family loved it.  I topped it with the Satiny Chocolate glaze from this site.  OMG!!  So good!

You're gonna think you died and went to heaven when you taste this! I used sugar-free chocolate fudge pudding mix, because that was all I had. No one could tell. The butter makes it incredibly, satisfyingly rich. The sour cream makes it a great keeper, but I doubt you'll have any hanging around. I made it in my new castle-shaped bundt pan, drizzled it while still warm with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this website, and it looked like it belonged on the cover of Bon Appetit. Deep, coal-dark chocolate that will satisfy the cravings of your most ardent choco-holics.

My husband has made this cake for me the past two years in a row for my birthday by request.  It is absolutely delicious!  I requested one small change this past year... I had him add a package of thawed, drained raspberries to the mix and reduce the almond to 1/2 tsp since it can be overpowering for some people's taste.  Also, the Satiny Chocolate Glaze listed in a previous review is excellent.

I made this in a 9x13 cake pan as I thougth it would be easier to serve to a large group. It was for a 55th wedding Anniversary and Ukrainian Christmas. All the guests had ate so much dinner that they only wanted a small slice of cake. Absolutely everyone went back for seconds.,some thirds..,and even..,forths!
It was so good! The best Chocolate cake I have yet had. I sprinkled with icing sugar and garnished with Strawberries and Vanilla Ice Cream. Perfect combination! Thank you!

First, I have to say that this recipe was very good. But I think a few changes need to be made to make it a five star recipe.

The almond extract with the dark chocolate just doesn't do it for me. I think the combination doesn't fit well. Almond and vanilla or lighter flavors seem a better match. I think next time I will substitute either vanilla extract or a coffee liquor.

The next suggestion would be to use chocolate chunks. Some reviewers thought mini chips would be better. I disagree. The reason being, when the cake is warmed up, the chips turn into goo and it makes the cake so much better.

And the last thing. This is one of those cakes that needs to be served warm. When it's eaten cool, it doesn't have the same chocolatey impact. But warming individual slices really does the trick for this recipe. (And I added some Cool Whip on top. YUM!)

Others mentioned greasing the pan well. This is a must. I had no problems with the cake sticking. And I did choose to let it cool a little longer than 10 minutes before I transferred it to a wire rack.

Overall this was very good, but a few changes will take this cake over the top.

i made a devils chocolate/white chocolate bundt cake with this recipe...  half of the batter from this recipe went in the bottom of the bundt pan, and i switched everything to white chocolate for the next layer (white cake mix, white chocolate pudding, white chocolate chips).  drizzled white & dark chocolate glazes over the top, then filled the center with juicy red strawberries.   just gorgeous, dahling!

WOW!  
I love chocolate and this recipe won RAVES from our friends and family.  As bad for my arteries as it is, I will always request this one for my birthday cake!!!  I ommitted the Almond as well, and added some melted chocolate chips and a little Hershey's syrup!  (As if it wasn't bad enough!!!)  By far one of the most incredible cakes I've ever eaten!

I have made this cake multiple times to rave reviews.  It is so easy and looks stunning too!  I make just a few changes - use Betty Crocker devil's food cake mix,  1/2 tsp. almond extract, 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract, 6oz. bag of semi-sweet morsels (not the mini ones).  once the cake is cool,  I drizzle Duncan Hines Amazing Glazes in chocolate and finish it with raspberries around the cake.  Yummy!

I made this to bring to work to celebrate a co-worker's last day.  She is a chocolate lover so I thought this sounded perfect.  Well, it was perfect!!!  After the first few bites, she emailed me to say "This cake is AWESOME!!!".  The rest of the crew loved it too.  It was devoured before lunch!  I added chocolate-dipped strawberries around the edge and in the center like the picture and I received many compliments.  All in all, a real winner for anyone who loves chocolate.  And so easy to make!!!

With the small changes, this rating is off the chart!  6 stars if I could!  My friend made this for me on my bday since I LOVE chocolate, and this IS the best chocolate cake ever!  Followed tips to use Vanilla extract, mini choco chips, and don't over mix batter.  Glaze: 1 cup choco chips, small can condensed milk, and 1 tsp vanilla extract.  Melt together and pour over cake, top with mini choco chips.   Enjoy with a cup of milk or ice cream, it's super rich and totally satisfying!

Best chocolate cake I ever made!  Used 3 9" cake pans to make a layer cake instead of a Bundt.  I didn't want it to be overwhelmingly chocolate so substituted 2 cups of crush almonds for the 2 cups of chocolate chips.  It added something different and really made it a treat.

Hands down the best chocolate cake ever!  Did have extra batter and used it to make cupcakes - they took about 17 minutes in the oven along with the cake proper.  Used the Chocolate Glaze II recipe from this site for the cake.  Everyone moaned in delight at their first taste!    The utensils and platter from the cake were literally scraped clean after the rest had been demolished by my co-workers!!!

I made this for the guys at the fire department where my husband works. He called me to tell me it was a HIT! Said a definate do-again!  Only thing I did was add a little water, my batter was way thick..and I did have to mix by hand because my hand mixer was broken at the time...but well worth it. I did the same as far as putting my miniature chips in some flour to keep them from sinking and I used vanilla instead of almond extract...Thanks for the recipe..was awesome according to the firefighters..and you know that they KNOW good food ;-)

This was very good, but not the best I've ever had. I was expecting it to be more dense, and less fluffy. I topped it with a dark chocolate ganache, and everyone loved it! I also used vanilla extract instead of almond. I will make this again, but maybe do a little experimenting.......

I don't know why it's taken me so long to review this recipe, because I've been making it for about 5 years now, but let me just say, "the title says it all!" If you love chocolate, you will adore this cake! I like to double up on the almond extract, but other than that, I don't change a thing. Be sure to have some vanilla ice cream to serve along with it; it'll make your taste buds want to get up and dance!!!

I initially made this cake for a super chocolate lover and it came out perfect.  My oldest son is not a big fan of chocolate cake, so I decided to tweak it a little bit for a different take.  Instead of chocolate cake mix, I used a vanilla cake mix, white chocolate instant pudding and folded raspberries into the batter before baking.  When it was cool, I topped it with cream cheese frosting/glaze while still warm.  He absolutely love it and told me it was going to be his favorite cake from now on!!!!

I made this exactly as it was written, and it has come out perfect every time.  I do use a KitchenAid mixer, with the wisk attachment--just be sure you only put it on the second level--medium on the KitchenAid is NOT the same as medium on a hand mixer.  The batter is always very fluffy when I put it in.  Also, I can only find cake mix with pudding in the mix, and I STILL add the pudding, and it comes out wonderful!  Just be sure to follow this recipe exactly, and you should have no problems!  (Be sure to only let it cool for 10 minutes--if you let it cool too long in the pan, it could end up sticking.)  Also, I recommend trying it at least once with the Almond Extract (as the recipe calls for.)  I'm not a huge fan of nutty flavors, but Almond is known to bring out more of the chocoltae flavor, which it does. If you don't try it, you don't know what you are missing!  :)

Wow, this is a really rich cake!  They weren't kidding when they say it's for chocolate lovers.  It's very moist, but the chocolate was a bit overpowering for me - all the chocolate chips plus the tang from the sour cream was a bit much.  I will probably make this again, but cut back on the chocolate chips to about a cup.  If you REALLY love chocolate go ahead and stick to the 2 cups of chips, otherwise I would suggest using a bit less.  I also used vanilla extract instead of almond.  Overall a very pretty cake, incredibly moist, and pretty easy to make.  :)

This is a family favorite. The cake comes out moist and very chocolaty. I had only about 1 cup of chocolate chips left and even then it was good, just like how a chocolate cake should taste and also I used vanilla extract because I didn't have almond extract.

I just made this delicious cake, and it was sinfully decadent! I recommend making this for your family on special occasions (because it's very high in calories) But, make sure to bring it to pot lucks and such (your friends don't have to know how fattening it is-but will praise you for what a great baker you are!) I have to say, I couldn't stop eating the batter which was even more addicting than cookie dough! Be warned!

I have been making this cake for 2 years now, I think. Delicious! You can lighten this up a bit (without sacrificing taste) by using low-fat sour cream. This cake impresses chocolate lovers everytime I make it. For a wow first impression melt some white chocolate chips and drizzle over the top of the cooled cake. Just a little though--it's for presentation only! YUMMY!

OK, I didn't see fireworks when I ate it, but it's a DARN GOOD cake and you won't be dissappointed. Much more dense and moist than regular cake.  It really doesn't need anything more than powdered sugar on top or some whipped cream or something, since it has the chocolate chips in the mix.  Would also be awesome served warm with a scoop of vanilla icecream.  I drizzled melted white chocolate on top and it was almost too much.  I made 2 cakes and I think it tasted better when I used the Duncan Hines Dark Chocolate Fudge mix rather than the Devils Food.  Tasted slightly less like cake mix.  I think I'll try it again putting the instant coffee in the mix.  I saw some reviews about the almond extract tasting too strong, but I could barely taste it.
I know it says to make a well and put all the wet ingredients in and mix it up, but whenever I make a cake, I've always whipped my eggs separately and mixed my wet ingredients before mixing it all.  I don't know if it really makes a difference.  Also, I did bake it about 7 minutes longer until only a tiny bit of wetness appeard on the tip of my knife and they were not too gooey at all.  I also had the bundt pan on top of my pizza stone.  Don't know if this makes a difference either... all I know is they turned out perfectly. Yum!

I made this recipe and it was a total disaster!  I baked it for 15 minutes past the suggested time and still, when I turned it onto the wire rack, it completely sank and oozed through the wires of my cooling rack!  I had to throw the whole thing away!

Just to add my two cents on an already first rate cake.  This is the best chocolate cake ever.  It was a big hit at my superbowl party.  Well worth the reviews and the 5 stars.

Awesome.  My whole family loved this cake.  I made it for my Mom's surprise 54th Birthday Party, and it was a hit.  I DID use Betty Crocker cake mix with the pudding already in the mix, and still added the full amount of pudding mix to the cake mix, and I though it came out better then the 2nd cake I made without the pudding in the cake mix.  If you DO decide to go with pudding in the mix though, be very careful to let the cake cool completely before removing from the cake pan.  Also, unless you just despise almond, think twice before substituting the almond extract with vanilla.  The almond sooooooooo much to the flavor, and I don't think this cake would be as terrific as it is without the almond.  I drizzled the satiny chocolate glaze over the cake, and I added some almond extract to the glaze too.  Excellent.

I picked out 3 different cakes from this site and let my mom pick which one to make me for my birthday...and-holy moly-this is the mother of all chocolates cake.Gorgeous  dusted with powdered sugar...the smell even after being out of the oven for over 2 hours was enough to drive you over the edge-and the taste was wild-the almond just kicks it staight into the deep end-SIMPLY PHENOMENAL for a cake!!!

'Hate to disagree with Susan, Allrecipes & the others who thought this cake was good, BUT this is a dressed up mix & it tastes like it.  It doesn't taste better than a mix, just different.  The minichips were a good idea.  I'll try that in another recipe.  I'll be taking all the similar recipes for cake using a mix, sour cream, butter or oil, pudding & chips out of my box.

With all the great reviews, I was expecting a rich, chocolately delicious cake. This was anything but. It is not very chocolatey and just tastes like a boxed cake with almond flavor added. It is much denser than a regular boxed cake but not much better. I made this for my own birthday cake and wish I had made a cake from scratch because I was very disappointed and ended up throwing it out. I did make the satiny chocolate glaze to ice it and that turned out good.

Quite yummy. I will add my warning to the others who have already said DO NOT use "pudding in the mix" cake mix for this unless you cut back the egg by one and reduce the butter or you will have a gummy mess. Duncan Hines mix is the brand to use if you want to follow the recipe exactly. That said... I had a LOT of batter. I made two 6-1/2 inch bundt pans and ten cupcakes and the batter was still bubbling over the centers of the bundts. I'm sure my cooking time was thrown off by me opening the oven and scraping batter off the bottom of the oven with my barbecue spatula to keep the house from filling with smoke from burning overflow! I only gave this recipe four stars because the expense of the ingredients added to a cake mix made me consider that maybe I should have just used them on a "from scratch" cake. It went together quickly and is very good though. I am having a hard time resisting repeated "taste testing" of those cupcakes!

Moist, rich, and delicious. No need for frosting on this one, I dust mine with a little powdered sugar and serve it with ice cream. I follow the recipe, EXCEPT I use 1 cup of mini chocolate chips. I tried it with 2 cups of regular chips and it was too chocolatey and sweet for my tastes. With that one change, it's perfection in my book!

I love this cake.  I mean, I LOVE IT!  I usually don't care for cakes because they are too dry and dull in flavor, but this one stands apart being moist and full of chocolate and almond flavors.  It reminds me of a Godiva truffle.  I have been reading over some of the poor reviews and have some words of caution.  

If you don't like wet cake, don't make this.  If you don't like chocolate, don't make this.  If you don't like rich desserts, don't make this.  If you don't like almond extract, don't use it.  This seems self-explanatory, but I noticed several reviews that said, "I don't like chocolate, but I thought I'd give this a try, and I didn't like it," and then they gave it 1 or 2 stars.  Well, surprise, surprise.  It's a chocolate cake!  Anyway, bon appetit.

Great chocolate decadent cake.  Do not make unless you want a very rich chocolate cake.  I made it twice as the first one burned.  the 2nd time here's what I did: 4 eggs, 2 C sour cream, over 325 and baked 60 min. and did not fill all the way to top (used almost all the batter and then made 2 cupcakes).  Frosted after it was cooled with a 1:1 corn syrup and water that I heated, added 1/4-1/2 c white sugar and then lots of milk chocolate (6oz) and poured this over top as a beautiful glaze and then chilled.  Some like the cake heated others like it cold. It does havea crust on the outside which makes heating nice and also it should be frosted as it's not too pretty looking. Greased with lots of butter then flour. No prob getting it out!thanks for recipe!

I usually don't like to make a new recipe to take to a gathering without trying for home first--but I made this on short notice for a back yard gathering. It was a huge hit!! Came out of pan beautifully and was so pretty and moist. Yum!! The next day one of the ladies, I'd just met the evening of the gathering, came to my place of employment to ask for the recipe! I have since made this with french white cake mix and cheesecake instant pudding with white chips and this was equally as wonderful. This is now one of my most favorites.

I think this cake deserves six stars. I can't even tell you how many times I have made this cake to take to work. It works out much better to use a bundt pan. Everytime I make it I receive more and more comments. I also think it is even moister the next day. I would tell anyone craving chocolate to make this cake. It is the best!

My sister and I made this cake for my mom's birthday.  We used the vanilla extract, light sour cream and reduced the butter to 3/4 cup.  We also had to cook it quite a bit longer than the recipe said.  The cake was delicious and everybody liked it, especially Mom.

One fantastic cake.  I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted vanilla for the almond extract (which I now see many people have done).  Worked out wonderfully.  Baking time was 55 minutes.  Very dense, very chocolately... mmmm.... chocolate.

Rather than using the butter, I used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of water.  Very rich, dense and delicious.  Perfect for the chocoholics just like the submitter suggests.  Thanks Susan.

My family enjoys this cake very much. It is very easy to make and tastes phenomenal. Never mind some of the horror story reviews posted. Those folks must be doing something very wrong. No goo, no spillage, no mess. 

I fully support cutting the almond extract in half and using vanilla in its place. I also suggest baking at 325 for a little longer, and rotating the pan half a turn after about thirty minutes (mine takes exactly an hour in a non-stick pan.)

My family enjoys a peppermint icing that I spoon over the top. But not too much icing, this cake is very rich on its own.

very moist, and very yummy. you have to follow the instructions about cooling- this is one of those fudgy cakes that finishes cooking as it collapses after taking it out of the oven. I greased the pan generously with crisco- no flour- and it dumped out perfectly clean. Dump onto plate, not a rack, because it is moist enough still that it may drip through.

What a horrible waste of ingredients and time!! The toothpick came out clean and when I tried to remove the cake from the pan, it crumbled all over the place, like it wasn't fully cooked. Definitely not worth the fuss!!

There couldn't be a better cake out there.  What I loved about this cake is that it tastes and looks like a cake from scratch, but it's really a boxed mix base.  Such a rich cake - to put a glaze/frosting on this cake would only take away from the cake itself.  Very moist, rich cake.  Good for any occasion.  Make NO changes!!

I loved this cake and had tons of compliments on it.  I made it with the almond extract and thought it added something different too.  I did make a chocolate glaze for the top and served it with vanilla ice-cream.  I had no problems with the cake falling, coming out of the pan, or anything.  EXCELLENT cake, will make again and again!

This was good, really moist. I did not think it was the best I've ever had...to me it just tasted like a really moist chocolate cake from a mix. However, I would make it again. Oh, and another thing, I used 1/2 tsp almond and 1/2 tsp vanilla, and I still thought the almond flavoring was too pronounced...would only use 1/4 tsp next time and the rest vanilla...

Very easy and popular dessert! 

It was scary at first because I thought the batter was missing some sort of liquid (i.e.-water, milk)but the eggs and sour cream worked perfectly to keep this cake moist, rich and delicious.  

I added a milk chocolate coating for the top and used a blend of semi sweet and milk chocolat chips for a change. I also substituted the chocolate pudding mix with fudge pudding mix. The recipe was very accepting to change.

My wife wants this one for her birthday, thank you!

I made this cake last night. I used vanilla extract instead of almond and mini-chocolate chip cookies. I had to bake a lot longer than just 50 minutes. It came out very very moist - almost too moist. My husband won't eat it, he says it doesn't taste done (I know it is, the outside is crispy). I doubt I would make this cake again, there was too much pudding. If I did, I would only use 1/2 the pudding mixture and maybe less sour cream.  I've had better cakes.

This was the BEST!  I brought it to a family gathering and everyone commented on how delicious it was!  It was a huge hit!  Everyone kept going for my cake rather than the other desserts that were out. I would highly recommend this choc. cake!  My husband is a choc cake lover, and this definitely became a favorite of his!  The only thing I did differently was use vanilla extract instead of the almond..and added powdered sugar to the top just to dress it up a little. Thanks for the great recipe!

I have made this cake twice , and it turned out wonderful.  I like to top it with powdered sugar and cool whip.  I want to try raspberries on top next, this is a rich cake so you would not want to use frosting.  I tried this in a bundt pan, but prefer to use a spring form pan.

I have made this cake twice in 3 weeks.  My family devours it - it has yet to last two days. 
The fudge-like consistency is awesome - I baked it in three  9" round cake pans and put a light layer of choc frosting between each layer and on top - It was totally chocolate,beautiful and delicious! I will make this a permanent part of my desserts collection.

What the heck review number am I anyway!!!I used several of the previous suggestions (flour the chips, tube pan, grease and flour pan, vanilla extract rather than almond, etc).  Well I've got to tell you this cake is soooooooo rich and soooooo good, you can only eat a tiny bit at a time.  That's the ONLY reason this cake lasts a little bit longrer. Superb!!

Maybe somebody could fill me in on what went wrong here.  My pan was the size specified in the recipe, but the cake almost overflowed and as a result the edges were almost burned by the time the cake cooked.  As a result, the edges stuck to the pan and only half the cake came out.  Why did this work so well for everyone else?

This is a very yummy cake.  I added orange extract instead of almond.  Definitely doesn't need icing.

I made this cake over a week ago and it is STILL MOIST!  Will definitely make this one again.  As another reviewer said, I think next time I will add another cup or two of chocolate chips, and maybe a drizzle chocolate icing for the top.  Excellent!  Thanks for sharing.

It took me less than 30 mins to prepare this cake.  I love the texture - so soft and moist. However, I think there is too much batter for my bundt cake pan, I have to spoon some out and make a few cup cakes.  As I do not have chocolate pudding in hand, I used chocolate fudge pudding.  The taste is bitter-sweet which is exactly what my husband like.  I dusted some powdered sugar on the cake and it looks beautiful.

I made this cake this past weekend and it was absolutely delicious.  It was really most and chocolaty, I served it with powdered sugar on top and whipped cream.  I plan to make it again for my co-workers...they will flip.

Amazing cake! It is just to die for! I also substituted vanilla for almond extract but otherwise left the recipe the same. It is so chocolatey that I felt it did not need any extras but I might try it with strawberries or raspberries in the future. The next day it was yummy warmed up a little in the microwave because the chocolate chips melted in the cake. I cant say enough how delicious this cake is!

This cake turned out to be amazing.  I made it for my bro's birthday and he absolutely loved it.  No one was content with just one piece.  I topped it with a pre-made chocolate glaze that I bought at the store, which turned out great.  The cake is great cold, but I think better when it's been out of the fridge for a few minutes, because it allows the glaze to soften and you can really taste the chocolate chips.  Yum!!!

I have now made this twice in the past 3 weeks - and have received rave reviews. This is definitely a chocolate lovers dessert. I frosted it with Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting (also on Allrecipes), which is our favorite chocolate frosting. They are perfect together.

This was an amazingly chocolate cake, everyone loved it.  As for other reviewers saying it overflowed, maybe they didn't put it in the right size pan.  Loved it.  Will make it again for sure.

I was disappointed in this chocolate cake. As I was making it I thought 2 cups of sour cream for a chocolate cake would take the chocolate taste out...I was right...I would not make this cake again.

OMG! followed the recipe with tips from other reviewers: greased pan well,filled to 1 1/2" of space between batter and top of pan, used mini choco chips and made sure cake mix did not have "pudding in the mix". Having done all this it turned out perfect. Best chocolate cake EVER!

Oh yeah, this cake really is as good as the reviews say it is.  I took it to a party and everyone loved it. I used vanilla extract instead of almond and drizzled with milk chocolate after cake had cooled.  Yummy, yummy but way too fattening to make very often.

This is one of the best chocolate cakes I have made.  I couldn't wait for it to cool and had a piece as soon as I took it out of the pan.  I used 1/2 almond and 1/2 vanilla.  My husband doesn't like icing and this cake definitely doesn't need it.  A great recipe!

The final result was good but getting to that point was not.  The first one I made flopped after taking it out of the pan to cool.  The second one came out better after I tweaked the recipe a bit.  It was not worth the second trip to the grocery and the money to make this recipe again.

I followed the recipe.  It DOES make too much batter - I think if you left the chips out of the batter it's the perfect volume for a typical bundt pan.  I knew it would likely overflow beforehand, and it did.  I have a teflon oven liner, so no big deal.  It really wasn't that messy anyhow, just a couple of drips.  After it cooled I cut the top off level with the pan.    This is my first attempt.  It came out delicious!  Very moist and very chocolately.  My husband's only complaint is that he would have preferred I used milk chocolate chips, since he is not a dark chocolate lover.   One week later we still have some left over and it's STILL very moist and delicious. (Keep in a glass cake plate on our buffet table.)    I used the satiny chocolate glaze recipe here on this website, and sprinkled a handful of chocolate chips into the glaze as a final touch.  Looked gorgeous!

I made this cake and must say..... YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!!!!!! This is incredible!! I did use only vanilla extract, not the almond though. It is so moist, and even with all the chocolate, it is not too rich or sweet. I used the satiny chocolate glaze recpipe from this site, and  doubled it as suggested and used 1/2 semi sweet and 1/2 milk chocolate chips. This recipe is a keeper, and will certainly be made many times in our home and passed around to friends and family.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated. My husband wanted a chocolate cake for his birthday so I thought I would make him one from this site. I borrowed a bundt pan. Needless to say I have to now buy our own pan because he liked this so much he wants me to make it again. Used the satiny chocolate glaze from this site to top it. What a great combination. Thanks for the recipe.

Fabulous chocolate cake recipe. I have become the baker extraordinare at work as a result of this cake. Out of a team of 10 at work, it was gone in under an hour (from when I took it out at 10 am!) Only change was vanilla instead of almond.  I just used powdered sugar on top and did not bother with a glaze.

Great cake for us chocoholics.  Did put it in an larger cake pan and was so glad I had.  My bundt pan would not have been large enough for all the batter.  Thanks for another keeper.

I made this cake to bring to the office and they LOVE it!  I've heard a couple "this is the best cake I've ever had"s.  I made it with the suggestion of vanilla instead of almond extract and glazed with half of the Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze (from this site).  I must admit, it's pretty darn good!

Very yummy, easy, and can make a beautiful presentation. I followed one suggestion and used mini chocolate bits. To make it pretty and extra yummy I added the Satiny Chocolate glaze and a confectionary sugar glaze, mini chocolate bits on top, and chocolate covered strawberries. I took it to a Women's Club meeting and it was a big hit and my husband also loved it! Great recipe and VERY easy! I will definetly make again.

Baked exactly and turned out amazing!  The almond extract complemented the chocolate beautifully.  Instead of removing from pan after 10 minutes, I let it cool in the pan for about an hour, and then removed it.  No problem at all.  Superb when topped with chocolate ganache recipe from this site.

I made this as a birthday cake for one of my co-workers who LOVES chocolate. It was so good she HAD to take some home. The part of the cake she did share was goobled up and the other part went home to her hubby and probably a late night treat for her too! I topped it with chocolate ganache recipe and used vanilla extract. I am making a holiday version of this cake tonight with white chocolate drizzle and strawberries.

Fabulous recipe!  I used the mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and they melted better.  I used margarine and it seemed to work better than butter.  Make sure you let the cake rest and cool a lot before turning it out or it will stick.

Great recipe!
First of all, I've made this several times and I have not had any problem with it overflowing. I used a standard size bundt pan, so there's no problem there. 

A BIG tip. Everyone I've made this for says its "good" the day of or the day after, but "AMAZING!" 2 or 3 days after you make it. Sounds strange, I know, but I'm just saying, if you are making this for a birthday or something, make it a day or 2 ahead, and keep it in an air tight container and you will have an amazing cake!

Uhh--YUM.  I have made this at least 3 times now.  Most recently I used rum extract instead of almond, and everyone commented on how good it was.  I may try orange extract next time??

Excellent cake.  The kids loved it.  I made  a topping using 1 can sweetened Condensed milk, a little milk and Nesquik chocolate, cooked it in low-medium heat until it started to thicken.  Delicious.

I really only had three stars for this one until the day after I baked it.  It was actually TOO moist at first!  I guess it set up overnight b/c it was quite good later, even without frosting or glaze.  Very rich.  I'll probably make it again - sure was easy.

Excellent flavor & consistency! Very chocolate-y & quite rich - but not too rich. I thought it was just right! I used mini semi-sweet chips and drizzled chocolate satiny glaze over the top (on this website & recommended by another reviewer). Also drizzled confectioners sugar white icing and added fresh raspberries in the middle and around outer edges right before serving. It looked beautiful and tasted even better! Thanks for a delicious recipe!

Very rich cake.  Not quite worth all the fat and calories that are in it. Honestly, I thought it was going to taste much better than it did.  I brought it to a party and only 2 people tried it..

Oh my gosh what a fantastic cake!!!  So rich, moist and chocolatey!! It was so easy to make too.  Everyone raved about this cake.  If you are a chocoholic, you MUST try this, you will not be disappointed. Made the cake as stated except I used a chocolate fudge cake mix instead of devils food. Simply amazing!!  Thanks Susan!!
Update, I made cupcakes out of this recipe today with a few minor changes.  Could not tell the difference.  Outstanding, just like the first time!!  For the cupcakes, I again used chocolate fudge cake mix, fat free/sugar free chocolate pudding (1 small box), light sour cream, 3/4 cup of melted butter and 1 less egg. I also used rasberry chocolate chips instead of semisweet chips. The batter is a little thick but the outcome was excellent!! They were ready in about 30 minutes.  Note for both recipes, the cake and cupcakes deflated a bit during cooling.  I used Paula Dean's 7 minute frosting both times.  Yum yum!! Will make again and again.  The friends we gave the cupcakes to loved them!!

With a house full of chocolate lovers, I was sure this would be a hit.  However, it just wasn't what we expected.  It was very moist, but too rich, even with the semi-sweet chips.  Just not crazy about it.

A great chocolate cake recipe. Very moist. Very easy to make. I've made twice. An idea for a lower fat version: omit the butter. The first time I made the cake I omitted the butter by accident (forgot it in the microwave after melting it!) and it still turned out well, just not as rich.

A great cake.  I made it for my husband's birthday and it was a big hit, I just sprinkled powdered sugar on top and served it with sliced strawberries and whipped cream.  My husband was in seventh heaven!!  Thanks.

Best cake I ever made! I followed the recipe exactly, except I reduced the almond extract to 1/2 tsp, which was perfect...more would be too strong for my taste. I served it with cool whip at a party at my house, and everyone loved it! I am making it again for a ladies meeting at church. I think that will be THE desert I make for functions from now on!

EXCELLENT RECIPE!!!! I used a dark chocolate fudge cake mix and added 1 tablespoon of instant coffee. I didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla and I used only four eggs instead of five. Served it at Easter dinner topped with the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze". What my guests didn't devour,they took home in doggie bags. Will definitely make this again.

I'm really of two minds with this cake. I prepared recipe as given. I used my electric hand mixer and everything blended beautifully. As per other reviewers, I let it cool in pan for about 30 minutes. It slid right out - no problem. Great chocolate taste and I didn't think it screamed box cake at all. It's the texture that threw me. It was definitely completely baked and looked perfect but - and maybe this is what other reviewers termed moist - it was wet. My cake wasn't goohey or heavy like a brownie it was what I can only term as wet. Since many people have rated it so highly, I would say try it. My husband and friends enjoyed it so I don't at all consider it a waste of time but unless someone asks me to make it again, I probably won't.

Honestly, I was a disappointed.   I made this cake exactly as directed and took it to a family Christmas party and no one was thrilled with it.  I didnt like the almond extract.  It was a little much and several asked if the cake had cherries in it bc of the strong almond flavor.  It was also a little dry & heavy.  I ended up putting a chocolate cream cheese icing on it, which helped, but I still wasnt crazy about it.  If I made it again, I would definitely cut back on the almond extract.  I was expecting the chocolate to be the dominating flavor but the almond extract was too strong.  I probably wont make this again.  Thanks for submitting!

I made this cake for my sons birthday and it is fabulous!!  I realy did not think that it would be this good!  I didn't want to make just a regular box cake and this cake does not taste like a box cake at all.  Its decadent, moist, and the almond extract is definately a must!  I made my own glaze with another members suggestion of melting 3 milkyway bars with 6 tbsp margarine and that was a great glaze for the cake even though it realy does not need anything at all.  I am so glad I made it, it is definately a keeper!

This is one of my most requested recipes! I have made this cake dozens of times and have never had one come out less than 5 star quality! I have found that this cake is better if you DON'T use a cake mix that already has pudding in the mix. Duncan Hines is truly the best cake mix to work with. I also melt some canned chocolate frosting and drizzle it over the top of the cake. Talk about rich! It's oooohh so worth it ! Thank you Susan!

Sorry, I suppose I'm one of those evil anti-chocolate people.  I thought that since this recipe had converted so many others, perhaps I had a shot.  But alas, no.  Something about the texture and the addition of almond extract.  Sorry!

This cake came out fine, but we didn't like the flavor.  Either we don't like "devils food cake" or the almond was to pugnent.  If you like either, you would enjoy this cake

Definitely deserves 5 stars!  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time, to cut back (a little!) on the fat, I used 4 large eggs, reduced fat sour cream, light butter, and about 1 1/2 cups of mini chocolate chips.  Still amazing!  We liked it even better the second day.  Thanks so much Susan Feiler!

This cake was okay but not as good as other chocolate cakes I've made. The batter is too much for a Bundt pan, so make sure you keep about 6 to 8 ounces out. It also took 75 min. to cook. As I tried to slice it, each slice would crumble. It did not go over well with my guests.

While this recipe wasn't horrible, it was definitely not fantastic either. After reading the majority of the reviews, I thought I would have a definite keeper- NOT SO! Do yourself a favor and just use the box of cake mix the recipes calls for, you will have yourself a much better cake.

This chocolate cake recipe was disappointing. I had to make another dessert since it turned out bad. It flowed out of the pan, the texture was too fudgy like, and the taste was just the same as fudge brownie you buy in the box at the store. Totally not gonna keep this recipe.

I am so glad some of the other reviews had the rise and sink experience.  I am not the best baker but this was an extra special train wreck for my kitchen.

I tried to leave the 1.5" one of the reviews suggested but even with that, the cake flowed like a volcano all over the oven.  My guests haven't arrived yet but the smoke smell is ALMOST out of the house.  I have a very short somewhat tasty cake to offer, but I don't think I will be attempting this one again.  What is left of the cake is too pudding like for my taste.  I am afraid my guests won't think I cooked it long enough...oh well, every dinner party needs a good conversation piece and my pitiful looking cake should do nicely.

This cake rose beautifully, and the pick came out clean. As soon as I removed it from the oven, it sank before my very eyes and I would not serve it to company. I would be afraid to try this recipe again and waste the ingredients!

After reading all of the great reviews I couldn't wait to make this cake and have my inlaws over.  I followed the recipe exactly, only I baked it a few minutes longer that the recipe stated.  The cake came out of the oven looking beautiful, it had raised way up over the pan and looked real thick, then after a few minutes out of the oven it sank!  Does anyone know what caused this to happen?  I don't think I will try this again unless I find out what to do differently.   :(

This cake is good, but would change just a few thigs: Use olive oil instead of butter, 1/2 cup not whole.  Use mini chips instead of regular size, and add different kinds.  3 eggs not 5, taste too eggie.  Not 2 cups sour cream use 1.  That's just how I will make it next time, but the original is great and easy, I baked mine in rounds and iced litely.

This was perfection! I used a bag of mini chocolate chips and they melted just perfectly to give it that creamy chocolate texture. I also used German Choc cake mix just out of personal preference (I think it is a little more moist).  I also used vanilla instead of almond extract because we aren't big almond fans.  Make sure you spray your pan really well, and the cake will slide right out.  Also, bake on cookie sheet because it does boil over a little.  This was DELISH! Moist and creamy and SO great! I made it for my MIL's birthday, and everyone loved it!! Keeper for sure!

I thought I'd tried every "super-chocolate" cake recipe there was, and then I stumbled across this one.  I knew I would like anything with all that butter and sour cream, but I was still amazed at how awesomely delicious this is.  Unfortunately it has turned out to be quite inconsistent and unreliable.  When it is good, it is fantastic - sort of like a giant chocolate truffle.  But more times than not, it falls, fails to cook through or does other weird and unpleasant things.  I've moved on to another recipe.

I liked this cake very much.  I made it for my sister-in-laws b-day and it was quite a hit.  I did follow one other review and added a bit of flour (amount stated on side box) because I am at a high altitude. I will make this again!

Great Cake. I used only the bundt cake pan despite others suggestions to use another small pan because of quantity. I thought I would regret it at first-but I just turned the oven off and let it bake for an additional 10-15 minutes. I used mini chips & poked holes in the cake and poured a melted a tub of store bought icing over the cake. My PICKY family absolutely loved this cake.

Delicious cake. I like to drizzle ganache on it with crushed mint candies for a fabulous holiday treat. You can also add a little flavoring to the cake including raspberry or orange. MMM.

I have made this numerous times. The only problem is that there is too much batter to fit into my decorative bundt pan.  I keep trying to cut back the amount I pour itn, but it still rises over the top. However, this gets rave reviews everytime I make it. I suggest using the recipe on this site for "Satiny Chocolate Glaze." The combo is awesome.

I used this recipe to make cupcakes for my daughters birthday. They were great! Since I live in a high altitude I added 1/4 cup of flour and 1 tbsp of water to keep the cupcakes from sinking. I replaced 1/2 of the butter with applesauce. and baked them for 22 min. each. VERY RICH!

Yum. I followed the recipe except for using vanilla instead of almond extract.  I used mini-chocolate chips as well and topped with Satiny Chocolate Glaze, a glaze also on allrecipes.com.  This is YUMMY with whipped topping or ice cream! :-)  It makes a bundt pan FULL and about 6 cupcakes.  It rises a LOT, so leave about 2 inches from the top of your pan.  Grease and flour well, and it doesn't stick at all. Enjoy!

I bake this cake everytime I need  no-fail and easy dessert.  This makes an excellent "welcome to the neighborhood cake" or bake sale treat.  You can buy all the ingredients at the Dollar Store! This cake is moist and decadent, and there is no reason to ever try any other cake recipes.  It is tempting to put icing on all cakes, but trust me; this cake needs nothing added to it.  You can put a simple powdered sugar/milk glaze on top if needed.  Enjoy!

Huge hit for us. There wasn't a slice of cake left over for my son's birthday party. I used this cake for his birthday cake because my son is a chocoholic and it turned out so well. It's a pretty dense and rich cake (almost like a brownie) so I used a light, fluffy, and creamy frosting to go with it as to not compete with the chocolate cake flavor (used the '7 minute frosting' from Joy of Cooking cookbook...and it was perfect). I also baked mine in two round cake pans rather than a bunt and the batter divided perfectly between two pans. I really wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. This is a cake for chocolate lovers...that's for sure.

Delicious! I made it for my boyfriend's mother's birthday, and everyone loved it. It was rich enough that a glaze was not necessary. I balanced out the sweetness by filling the center hole with fresh raspberries and lightly dusting the whole cake with confectioners sugar. It was an easy recipe to follow. The result: chocolatey goodness!

This was a very moist cake, and the chocolate chips are a nice addition. I wasn't a fan of the almond extract, so I probaby won't add that again. Also, be very careful to choose your bundt cake pan wisely, as mine bubbled up way too high and I ended up 'trimming down' my cake to look normal. Larger bundt pans should be fine. All in all, a tasty and rich cake.

The only change I made was to use 1 cup of semi sweet mini morsels instead of 2 cups. This cake is dense, rich & delish.  No need for frosting.

I took other reviewer's advice and used one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of two. This recipe is easy to follow and the cake is sure yummy. I also used the satiny chocolate glaze from this site.

Be sure to let the cake cool in the pan for ten minutes as the recipe instructs.  I was hurried and didn't read that part of the recipe.  I tried to invert it onto a bottle as you usually do with cakes baked in bundt and tube pans, and the cake literally fell out of the pan onto my arm!  No problem with sticking in the pan. :o) I served the broken pieces with vanilla ice cream and everyone loved it.  Great recipe.  I will definitely make it again.

Perfect for birthdays!  My new son-in-law loved it and my son-in-law of 5 years said it is his new favorite cake!  I put it in an angel food cake pan, increased the baking time by 10 minutes and it was perfect.

I've made this cake a few times and it always come out great. It pops out easily, is always moist and very chocolately. I've tried it with both almond extract and vanilla, it's good with either one, depends on your preference. Pair it up with the Satiny chocolate glaze from this site and a few berries and you've got a classic!

Best chocolate cake I've ever had!  I took the tips from others and used 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp almond extract, and it was perfect!  For the topping, I used the Chocolate Glaze I recipe from this site (you really need to triple that recipe to have plenty on the cake).  Would also be delish with a raspberry sauce.  Thank you, thank you, for this recipe, Susan!

This cake looks beautiful and you certainly don't need to frost it - just some strawberries and powdered sugar.  It is easy to make but I don't think it is worth all the fat and calories.  Once guests knew what was in it no one ate it and I threw half away.  It spoils quickly since it is so moist.

This is my youngest son's favorite cake.  Today it is his birthday cake. I only had 1 cup of sour cream and didn't add anything else to make up the other cup and still turned out great. Also, only had one cup of milk chocolate chips--had no problems or complaints-moist not wet. I sprinkled with powdered sugar, none of my bunch are into icing or glaze and this cake is 'a lot' on it's own! very good.

This cake was really good, I rated it 4 stars because the reviews were a little over zealous in my opinion.  It was really good, but  not earth shattering.  I did not glaze or frost mine, it didnt need it.  Serving very warm is a must, it makes it gooey and yummy.  For presentation I did it kind of like the picture shown here, but I dipped long stem strawberries in chocolate and lined them around the cake on the cake plate.  I also put strawberries in the center of the cake and dusted it lightly with powdered sugar.  Very pretty.  It was a nice b-day cake for my mother in law, presentation was great but no raving on the taste from her.

I made exactly as instructed and was NOT impressed.  I can still taste the "cake mix" grainy flavor. The only problem I had, was that it took 8-10 minutes longer to cook until "set" and it was a little on the dry side...but if I had taken it out any earlier it wasn't cooked all the way thru. A chocolate sheet cake is just as easy (maybe easier) to make with a much better flavor and texture.  I won't be making this again.

With all the five star ratings on this one, I thought I would love it (and I too am a chocolate lover). It was extremely dense, not really a cake at all but more like eating a chocolate bar. It was tasty but I wouldn't say I was blown away and can't wait to make it again.

Wow!!! This cake was fabulous!!  I made it for a co-worker's birthday.  I couldn't find my bundt pan so I just made it in a regular 10x3 pan.  It still came out great!!!  I sprinkled the top with confectioner's sugar and placed a cluster of strawberries in the center.  It was a hit in the office!!!  My friend absolutely loved it!!  I will definately make it again!!!

I've made this cake several times for parties, etc.  I always get at least one request for the recipe.

We have a 9" bundt cake pan and have to add about 10 minutes to the cooking time due to the reduced surface area of the pan.  We put a cookie sheet under it when baking.  The cake rises above the center rim and forms what our children call a volcano.  We frost (see Carolines' Chocolate Fudge Frosting on this site) and let them eat this little cake so we can arrive at our destination with the cake in tact.

This is a huge favorite at work and I add an icing to it. In sauce pan combine
4T cocoa, 4T butter, 2T water, 2T corn 
syrup and cook over low heat until mixture thickens. Remove from heat and add 1/4 t almond flavoring and 1C powdered sugar. Spread over top of cooled cake. You'll love it!

Used vanilla extract and mini chocolate chips. Delicious. Cake was almost fudge-like, and stayed moist for DAYS. Great for chocolate lovers. Will definately make this again and again!

This cake is truly outstanding!  If you are wondering how it will turn out-- just make it!  It is so easy, but SO GOOD!  It tastes like a combination of a brownie and a cake.  I used vanilla instead of almond abstract, and semisweet/white chocolate swirl chips instead of plain semisweet.  I also used light sour cream and you could not tell at all that it was light!  I would suggest leaving this cake in the pan after it cooks.  It is so moist, it may fall apart on you if you try to take it out, even after it cools.  It stays moist for several days, however!  A phenomenal recipe-- one of the best on this website.

This was a wonderful & simple cake to make.  When we ate it with ice cream, it reminded me of the "warm chocolate cake" I have ordered in an expensive restaurant.  This is the cake you will want to make for the next church dinner!  Excellent!!!

This cake was wonderful. I made it just as the recipie said and it turned out wonderful. My sister and mother both commented that it tastes similar, though better than, a chocolate cake you would order in a high-end resteraunt. Dont read any negative reviews on this one. They arent true!

I must add to the already astounding amount of great reviews for this cake. It was HEAVENLY. Very chocolaty, so moist and yummy- EVERYBODY loved it and wanted more. I love frosting but this totally did not need frosting. Added shaved hazelnuts and crushed pecans to my mix and that made it even better. WOW! I will definitely make this cake every time I think of a chocolate cake that is sure to please. It was gone within a day!

I decided to bake this for a friend's birthday and had high hopes for this cake because of the high ratings. I used half/half dark chocolate chips and milk chocolate as semisweet weren't available.  Taking the first bite out of the cake sent all my hopes and expectations crashing down - the package mixes lent the cake a very 'i can't cook properly so i bought package cake' artificial taste. Luckily I made this 1 week in advance as a 'practice' and baked a devil's food cake (from scratch!) instead which turned out great decorated with fresh cream, mixed berries and chocolate shavings.

Fantastic!  Thank you Susan for a super easy, bullet proof cake recipe.  We used a chocolate fudge cake mix, and added a heaping teaspoon full of mayonnaise.  For frosting I made a simple caramel glaze and served it with merlot and espresso for a friend's birthday.  This is a winner, I will be making it again.  Thank you.

Don't bother with this one just use Lisa's chocolate chocolate chip cake recipe on this site, much better and you don't have to worry about it deflating into a fudge goo.

Very easy, moist and good! I deleted the chips and instead melted them with some confectioners sugar and milk for a fabulous glaze. This cake isn't too sweet so if you are looking for sugary sweet make sure that you either powder sugar or glaze the cake. This one is a winner, great base cake.

My goodness...this is my favorite!  I make this on occasion and freeze it.  When guests come over I slice a few pieces and microwave it then add a scoop of ice cream on the plate.  I've been told it's just like the resturants.  This is by far the best recipe I've tried from this site!

This should have 10 stars! I used the Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe cake mix, and vanilla extract instead of almond (Didn't have any) and I used the regular size chocolate chips. This cake was the very best chocolate cake that I have ever made!! I also cooked it in my Pampered chef bundt stone, and put the Chocolate Glaze I on that I got from this sight! I am sure my children will be asking for this on a regular basis! Thank you so much for sharing!!

Absolutely love this easy,simple but out of this world chocolate cake. Cost me next to nothing, took less than ten minutes to prepare it and "wallah" came out this moist rich chocolate cake....even better than buying it from the bakery. Use Duncan Hines cake mix,Jell-o pudding mix and Ghiradelli chocolate.  My husband who's a carrot cake man has changed his ways.

There are 2 reasons why I'm giving this recipe a 4 star instead of a 5, first of all there was WAY too much batter to fit in a 10 inch pan.  Next time I'll divide it into 2 pans.  Secondly I didn't like the taste of the almond extract, I'm not a huge fan of it and I should have known better.  Next time I'll substitute it for regular vanilla extract or use 1/2 the amount that the recipe specifies.  Otherwise it was FABULOUS!! Extremely moist, very delicious, it just melts in your mouth.

This cake is awesome.  It is very moist and chocolaty.  I only used 4 eggs and left out the almond extract and it turned out perfectly.  Mine didn't collapse when I took it out of the oven like some other reviewers said.  I also used 1 1/2 cups of mini chocolate chips instead of the larger ones.  I dusted it with powdered sugar when it was cooled off.  This is my new favorite chocolate cake.  Wonderful!

This cake is to die for! It is the absolute BEST chocolate cake I have ever had! My whole family raved about it. I mixed some glaze up quick with powdered suger, milk and vanilla and drizzled it over the top. This cake is simply the best! It definitly lives up to its name!

Sorry-found this to have too much of a pudding like texture, much too wet.  More importantly  there is no refined chocolate tastes.

I was VERY reserved about using a store bought cake mix, because you can reallllly tell the difference; but, I was in a fix so I used this recipe.  It was fabulous and noone could tell that it was made from a mix.  I topped it with a chocolate cream cheese frosting.  Very nice.

Wow! This was a wonderful dessert... I brought this out to a friend's house for Thanksgiving, and everyone raved about it! I'm not much of a cook: this cake was so easy to make... and really a lovely presentation despite it having no garnish. An outer "crust" is formed, while the inside is dense and very moist. Delicious!
I was apprehensive about the addition of almond--thinking it may over power, however, it only complemented the chocolate flavor. Awesome recipe! Thanks! Try this one, everyone!

This cake was fantastic! I melted the chocolate chips with the butter because I didn't want a lumpy texture. I also used fat-free sour cream and pudding...and you can't tell I did! I don't have a bundt pan, so I put it in a 9x13 cake pan and cooked it for about 45 minutes. Next time I might add an extra couple teaspoons of cocoa to the mix. I also used a milk chocolate frosting. People loved it!

WOW!!! Definetly a keeper.  Best chocolate cake out of a box I've ever made.  It took 1 hour 10 minto cook, but worth every minute of it.  I follow the 5 eggs suggestion and the vanilla instead of almond exract.  Thank you for sharing :)

This has got to be the best chocolate cake ever!  It just melts in your mouth.  I thought perhaps it needed a glaze or frosting or such, but after trying one bite... PERFECT THE WAY IT IS!  It's even better when still warm! :)

My husband said this cake was just "okay", similar to an ordinary chocolate cake.  He didn't like the almond flavoring at all and I didn't realize others had mentioned not to use it, but instead use vanilla.  Wish I had.  Won't make again :(

This cake was awesome my family loved it, 5 eggs is deffinetly a little much found it to "eggy" if that makes any sense,next time I will deffinetly use 1 less egg. I also put a glaze on it  melted 5-6 tablespoons of butter and added a cup of chocolate chips poured over the top and sprinkled it with powdered sugar made a great presentation. Will deffinetly make this again. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a very easy recipe and makes an extremely moist cake.  I could tell there was too much batter for my bundt pan so I poured about a cup into a small pan.  I had no over flow and ended up with a little cake for my kids to share.  Mine came out of the pan fairly easily.....one small area stuck a little bit.  Make sure to spray the pan really well with Pam.  I dusted the cooled cake with powdered suger.  It is really rich & I didn't think it needed frosting or glaze

OH MY GOODNESS....What a yummy cake.  It was a bit heavier than I anticipated (duh on my part) but very good.  It was easy to make.  However, I found that the batter expanded quite a bit.  I thought I would be ok making 2 9" round cakes w/a batch, but alas, it was too much batter.  3 9" rounds would have been more appropriate.  Also, I found using mini-chocolate chips made it a little less dense and a nice surprise when you're expecting chocolate chuncks by its looks!

I loved this moist cake.  I could eat it fine plain, but my husband needed ice cream or milk to tone down the intense richness.  Definitely a must-taste for chocolate lovers.  I used low-fat sour cream and one less egg, and it turned out fattening enough for me!  Delicious.

Excellent!!  I used an Angel Food pan so the batter wouldn't flow over, it does rise up alot then sink down after it comes out of the oven & settles.  Tastes best after it cools completely.  Thanks for your reviews, it really helps.  Definite Chocolate Lovers Dream, i can't keep out of it!

This recipe already has so many great reviews, but I want to add that I won a dessert making contest over about 30 other entries with this cake.  I used a chocolate glaze and garnished it with candied cherries.  Thank-you Susan for this wonderful recipe.

ok, First of all I love chocolate and most things chocolate but I didnt find this any more special than some of my mothers chocolate cake recipes. It was moist, it was chocolaty, I think it would make better cupcakes with cream cheese frosting (which I am going to try next with this recipe) but I cant give it 5's across the board. I will however next time put in 1/2 almond flavor and 1/2 vanilla flavor. I used the cream cheese recipe from "clone of a cinnabon" and doubled it. So again, good not great!

Very good!!! I would chop up the chocolate chips a bit, Getting 2 or 3 in one bite can be a bit much. Other than that it was the best! EXTREMELY chocolatey! I made a chocolate moose to put on top and drizzled chocolate syrup on it. Everyone loved it. If you need to get a fix this is the way to go!

I am a BIG TIME chocolate lover and this is the best cake I have ever tasted, and believe me, I have tasted many.  I took it to a party and every single person loved it.  They wanted the recipe and it disappeared so fast I didn't even get a piece. It was SO easy to make and it looked so nice with powdered sugar dusted over it. Also, you can make this cake the day before. I actually like it better the second day.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and I didn't like the taste of this cake at all.  I am a big fan of chocolate.  I made this to go to a Christmas party and I wouldn't take it.  I made the cake because of all the good reviews and I was so disappointed in it.

With the combination of not testing this recipe before I made it the night before Thanksgiving and the ratings telling me to be careful about this and that, I was stressed the whole time I was preparing/cooking it.  I followed all the tips about using a non-stick large pan, greasing and flouring both the pan and chips, and closed my eyes and hoped that it would work.  Luckily, it turned out perfect!! I did have to cook it for any extra 15 minutes, but when I took it out I had no problem with sticking. I let it rest for 10 minutes on a rack before flipping it over.  The pan came out smoothly.  I put a chocolate glaze over the top, and now it's sitting in my fridge waiting to be enjoyed as a Thanksgiving dessert.  I can't wait to taste it!

This cake was great.  Try using vanilla or yellow cake mix, vanilla pudding and white chocolate chips.  I made the white version and served it with a raspberry chambord sauce.  Everyone went crazy!!  Do be careful to not let the cake cool too long in the pan - that's when it sticks.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  I read all the reviews and was excited to try this especially since my husband and I are chocoholics.  I needed a recipe for a family reunion I'm hosting.  Thank goodness I did a test cake first.  I followed a couple of the suggestions in the reviews such as putting it in a bigger tube pan and flouring the chips first.  I left it in a few minutes longer as it wasn't done within the given cook time.  It fell like a torte would except I wasn't making a torte.  It oozes grease and coats our mouth with grease.  Although my husband thinks it has a wonderful chocolate flavor, I won't be making this again.

Wow!!  This was the moistest, densest, cake I have ever had!  Definatly have lots of milk close by to help wash it down with!  I made it to take to work and had none left to bring back home - everyone said it was awesome and several asked for the recipe.  After reading some of the other reveiws, I used vanilla instead of almond - but will try it with almond another time.  YUMMY!!!!!  ***Just a side note - after reading about others saying that it fell apart, be sure to let it cool for about 10 minutes in the pan on a wire rack!  I think it also took a bit longer, but I just kept testing it until it was done.  My choco chips didn't sink, either. :)

This is the first recipe that I reviewed on this website, and I have a few comments to make about it. First of all, it was absolutely delicious. It was moist, rich, and delicious, essential components in a great chocolate cake. I brought it to a party and everyone absolutely enjoyed. I was even approached for the recipe a few times. One person even thought I got it from a bakery! Another thing: This cake should be made for a special occasion or as an indulgent dessert; the fat and calorie content is extremely high! I know that cakes aren't notorius for being low in calories, but this cake doesn't even have any frosting. (Not that it needs frosting, I am just making a point.) So, don't make it too often! Finally, I just have to share a suggestion that I will use next time I will make this cake (it won't be too soon, though!): I am going to use a white cake mix, white chocolate pudding, and white chocolate chips. Yummy! So, in conclusion to my lil' essay (hehe), you should definitely try this wonderful cake, but only in moderation! *~The Princess~*

Great cake.  Here's a tip on the "sinking chips" problem.  Use the mini choc. chips.  Coat them with a Tablespoon of flour (I shake them in a baggie), then add to batter. Voila! No sinkage. Ü I learned this trick on a chocolate chip cheesecake recipe I have.

Take this to the bank: Print out this recipe, laminate it, and keep it forever...because that's how long you'll keep making it. But despite my grand and glorious love of chocolate, this particular cake definitely DOESN'T need any frosting of any sort. The only problem I had was getting the cake out of the pan while hot without it ending up in pieces..you see, I was sooo anxious to eat a piece. So perhaps a healthy dusting of flour in the pan might be helpful. My serving suggestion: Serve nice and warm, right out of the oven, topped with FROZEN Cool Whip. That's the best definition around for "Died And Gone To Heaven!" This is one recipe that deserves far more than 5-stars!

Have tried this cake several times.I use vanilla extract instead of almond and pour melted chocolate frosting on top for extra kick! I agree it does take longer to cook than recipe states,but is well worth it. To the previous reviewer, the first time I used a regular bundt pan & it did stick. I suggest a black nonstick bundt pan. Flip the pan over and let the cake cool for at least 45min before removing.

Delicious and easy.  I used vanilla instead of almond extract.
I layered the chocolate chips, and I topped with the chocolate chip glaze. 
Big hit at my daughter's 4 year old birthday party with kids and adults.

I must have messed this one up because it turned out terrible (I am sorry to say).  It ended up gooey (even though I cooked it longer).  The almond flavoring was too much.  My husband hated it so I had to rate it low for kid friendly.

This is the most fabulous chocolate cake i've ever made!  It should be called chocolate velvet cake.  this is the kind of cake you have in 4 and 5 star resturants.  next time i would increase the chocolate chips to 3 or 4 cups.  Thank you, thank you, thank you Susan.

this is an amazing cake, it almost has the texture of a brownie.  I drisseled chocolate frosting over the top and served it for my sister's baby shower with whipped cream and chocolate covered strawberries.  It was marvelous!

I made this for a dinner party last night and it was AMAZING- everyone had seconds.  I followed the advise of other reviews and used my kitchen aid paddle and made sure I didn't overmix.  I also mixed wet ingredients together before adding to cake mix.  For icing I applied store bought whipped cream cheese icing while cake was hot and it melted beautifully on top and down some sides. I decorated with strawberries but we ate it before I was able to take a picture.  Definitely will make this again.

My, oh my, oh my!  This is fantastic!  I made it just as written except baked it in an angel food pan.  I topped it with the ganache recipe from this website. I added Amaretto to the ganache instead of rum. I also heated some frozen raspberries and added just a touch of sugar (enough to allow them to keep their tartness). I sprinkled powdered sugar on the slice of cake and served it with a spoonful of the raspberries on the side. Heaven on earth!  
I had tried (twice) a different "too much chocolate" cake recipe on this site and my entire family felt it was too heavy and not very flavorful. This one is smooth and delicious. Wow!  Thank you, Susan, for a spectacular dessert recipe. This is definitely one to prepare when you are trying to impress!

It was ok. Did not have the really chocolatey taste that I was trying to achieve. I did fit all the batter in one bundt pan and it did not deflate much at all after baking. Maybe if the glaze recipe was included that is shown in the photo,  it would have tasted better.  The glaze that I did use, found on this website, wasn't that great either. Sorry.

Have made this cake many times...but I got everything together today and realized I didn't have an instant chocolate pudding mix.  Used vanilla instead and told no one.  No one knew the difference or mentioned anything about it tasting differently.  SO!  If ever you find yourself without a box of instant chocolate pudding to go into this cake...use vanilla!

Great result despite having no power mixer. Currently, I only have a little hand-held mixer and the stiff batter overwhelmed the motor. I did all my mixing with a wooden spoon, and certainly not for four minutes as I felt the batter was starting to develop its gluten framework within one minute. So, I had not much volume at all, and considered a potentially bad outcome. However, after baking 60 minutes and resting for ten minutes, that puppy came beautifully from the Bundt pan, even with standard chocolate chips mixed in.
Needless to say, I am re-doubling my efforts to buy an original Kitchen Aid stand mixer on EBay, as I understand they are superior to the current new ones.

So easy & super delish!  Followed recipe to the T. 1 recipe made a bundt cake plus a dozen cupcakes. Topped with a vanilla glaze. Will definitely make this again. Endless ways to vary this. Might be great with dried cherries :-)

This is GOOD!  Although the cake fell after removing from the oven, that only served to make it very dense and rich, and wasn't gooey as one reviewer experienced.  I topped it with chocolate ganache, and oh my, it disappeared in a hurry!  I will use the tiny chocolate chips next time--already had a stockpile of the regular ones to use up.  This is a very good chocolate cake.  UPDATE:  I have made this several times, and always use the mini chips.  It's become my "go to" recipe for chocolate cake, so I felt it only fair that I raise the rating to 5 stars.  It truly is my favorite chocolate cake recipe.

OMG!  This cake is amazing and I usually don't make box cakes!! (I'm a homemade snob!) Anwyway, It's very moist with a geat texture!  I added a few things and it was simply devine!  After putting the cake in the pan, sprinkle some coconut flakes on top.  Instead of the satiny chocolate glaze, I made a rum-cream cheese glaze!  I'm telling!  It was awesome!!!!!

This is my go-to recipe for a moist, dense chocolate cake.  It is always a crowd pleaser.  I like to top mine with chocolate ganache poured over the top and down the sides.  I have also melted coconut pecan frosting and poured over it.  Delicious!

I've made this cake three times now with no changes from the original recipe.  I get raves each time and have been asked to make it again this weekend for a fundraiser cake sale.  Definitely an easy cake to make -- very rich and moist.

I don't think there is anything wrong with the recipe if your ok with the taste of cake mix cakes. I was suprised that all the extra ingredients didn't enhance the taste of the cake. It was very moist though

the recipe is TOO MUCH! i used a bundt pan and followed the recipe to a T... and i smelled smoke, and i opened the oven 40 minutes in and there was batter bubbling over onto the oven wire on the bottom... if you make this cake, only fill it up so much....

onto the tasting! it was so dense, heavy, chocolatey and good!

This is a wonderful chocolate cake and to date my family's favorite.  I use vanilla instead of the amaretto (family preference) and also use a tube pan..it overflows in a bundt.  Comes out perfect! I also use the "satiny glaze" recipe that can be found on this site on top.  I pour it on while the dake is still warm...boy oh boy a yummy gourmet cake.

This cake was amazing. I made this for my mother's birthday and my entire family absolutely loved it! I added a great big pile of fresh delicious strawberries in the middle of the bundt, and drizzle melted white and milk chocolate over the top. It tastes great and is very easy to make. For anybody that loves chocolate, you will love this cake!

This cake is the one I make my daughter-in-law every year for her birthday. I make a major change, though-- I bake it in two 9" pans. I prefer a layer cake to a bundt so I do it this way. I take out enough batter to make 3 cupcakes, then divide the rest between the two pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes.

My boyfriend LOVES this cake!!! His mom was a stay at home mom and bakes everything from scratch. I tried this recipe for him, praying that it would compare her's. OMG...he said that it was BETTER than her's!!! I get raves everytime I bake this. I did substitute 1/2 almond extract and 1/2 vannilla extract, and I also added the mini choc chips. Overall, it was GREAT!!!

Moist, delicious, and not too difficult.  The batter was thick, but it made a beautiful bundt cake.  I used a ganache recipe from this site to make dark chocolate ganache, poured that over the top, then drizzled melted white chocolate over it.  I served it for my boyfriend's birthday party, and he LOVED it.

I have baked so many different cakes from the website.  Thus far my co-workers say this is the best they have ever tasted!  I was shocked as previously I had never baked a chocolate cake because I have never thought I could bake them well!  This recipe is excellent I have turned it into a double layer cake and add a raspberry filling- which adds an extra depth of flavor.

for the past two years, it has become a tradition in my family that I make this cake for birthdays.  I just dust it with powdered sugar and put it on a pedistal.  It has that semi-homemade quality........super easy, moist and delicious.  Thanks for the family favorite!

Very moist and delicious cake.  I used vanilla extract in place of almond.  I also drizzled with a chocolate glaze frosting, which I absolutely recommend!

DEE-LISH!  I used dark chocolate mix and vanilla instead of almond extract.  My family liked the cake better cold than at room temp-  It had a denser/ fudgier consistency after it was refrigerated.

My whole house smelled wonderful while baking this simple cake!  I just used a store brand devils food cake, left out the almond extrct simply because I was out.  For the icing I used store bought cream cheese icing and added 3 drops of green food coloring and 2 cap full of peppermint extract.  SUPER YUMMY and dense cake.  It was a HUGE hit!

mmmmmmmmMMMMM!  Very very good!  I used a dark chocolate fudge box mix and did add the almond extract.  I'm glad I did because it gave it a bit of a different flavor, and I feel like it cut the sweetness a bit and made it taste more like the bite you get when you eat something made of dark chocolate.  I just dusted it with powdered sugar, it definitely is tasty on it's own.  Next time I'm going to try the satin glaze everyone is talking about.  I used only 1 cup of chocolate chips based on other reviews, having more wouldn't have bothered me so next time they all go in!  Delish.  I'll be making this one again for sure!

Very rich cake.  I had enough for a bundt pan and an 8x8 dish.  I cover mine in bittersweet chocolate ganache and topped with chocolate covered strawberries. Mmmmm good.  My husband and my five year old loved it.

This recipe is the bomb. I follwed the recipe exactly.  I think probably if I didn't add all the chocolate chips, I would have done the satin glaze; however, it was perfect the way it was. Very moist.  Will make again and again. Thanks for a great recipe!

Oh my gosh...I think this is perhaps the best cake I've ever made. I also used the 'Satiny Chocolate Glaze' from this site...that recipe calls for vanilla extract but I substituted peppermint extract to make a mint chocolate glaze for this cake. I am a sucker for anything mint chocolate. Absolutely fabulous!

If you Love chocolate, you will love this cake!  I made it just to see how moist and gooey it would really be even though I'm not that huge of a fan of chocolate.  My 8 yr old son is though and he gave it a thumbs up!  He didn't think it would be right to just leave the cake as is so we poured the "satiny chocolate glaze" from this site on it which in my opinion made it too sweet.  Next time no topping.  Followed to a T and used a bundt pan, it had to bake an extra 10 minutes but its very good.  It did kind of "fall" after setting out of the oven for a while.  the top sort of caved in so I don't know what that was about and it didn't affect the taste so I guess all is good.

My husband loved this cake.  So did my parents.  I on the other hand didn't see anything so special about it.  It tasted like a boxed cakemix with chocolate chips added.  I had to give it 4 instead of 5 stars.  Sorry.

I made this for a dinner party this past weekend and served it with Hudsonville, MI Grand Traverse Bay Cherry Fudge ice cream!  Very rich, but if you love chocolate . . . !!  I made the Satiny Chocolate Glaze as suggested, then made a small amount of white confectioners icing and made drizzles as in photo.  I topped it off with Maraschino cherry halves.  Very festive looking!  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe.

This was a major hit! Everyone at my hostess party RAVED about it! I topped it off with a choclate ganache that I found on this site too! I did not change a thing. I used one of those silicone bundt pans and it slid out with ease! A keeper!!

This is fabulous! I made it for my husband when we were dating, used it for our wedding reception (in miniature bundt pans) and also for my church's bazaar. I've heard so many compliments. Absolutely delicious!

This cake was a big hit with everyone, even those who claim to not like chocolate! I also substitued 2 cups of yogurt for the sour cream and the cake was mighty rich enough. Other than that, I did it just as the recipe said and iced it with "Satiny Chocolate Glaze", as found on this site. I will definitely make it again!!

A recipe has to be outstanding for me to give it "5 Stars", and this recipe supercedes even that.  I made it for my husband's birthday, and he took leftovers to work today.  His co-workers raved about it (and ate it before lunch!). I will make this cake over and over again. Thank you, Susan, for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I made this cake for a friends birhday cake. (I will submit a picture). This was by far the best Chocolate cake recipe I have EVER had. I started decorating and making cakes as a side bus. after my son was born. I get called to do quite a few including wedding. This cake was "fluffy" and so moist. Fantastic... now if I could find a white cake recipe this good!!

I have made this cake three times and have gotten rave reviews every single time and many requests for the recipe.  I always use vanilla extract instead of the almond and just dust with powdered sugar.  It does not taste like a brownie, it's very moist, not gooey.  Using PAM on my bundt pan it has always popped right out after ten minutes of cooling.  Frankly, I am perplexed by the negative reviews.  It's a fantastic cake!

This was ok, but no one was wowed. With all the great reviews, I thought it would be an instant it. I followed the directions exactly and used the satiny glaze as suggested by others, but am not impressed (and I LOVE chocolate).

I have made this twice.  My husband is allergic to almonds, so I used vanilla extract the first time, and the second time I forgot to put it in at all.  Regardless, it was incredibly yummy both times and got nothing but raves from everyone who tried it.  I had to bake it a bit longer than the recommended time (I used the usual toothpick test) and had no problems with consistency -- it was moist but not wet or runny as some other reviewers said theirs was.

Easy to make and it came out perfect.  I didn't even think it needed frosting, so I just dusted it with confectioner's sugar and made it look pretty. ^_^.  Will definitely be making this again.  I work in cancer research, and when I brought this in to my lab, everyone gobbled it up and it disappeared in no time.  Do yourself a favor and bake this cake!  You will NOT be disappointed!!

This cake is very,very good. It turns out very much like a brownie, therefore, the next time I will add chopped pecans or walnuts to the recipe. Definately a keeper.

****CAUTION****** This recipe fails to mention the mess this cake will make if you do not use an X-TRA large bowl or use a kitchen-aid with a splatter guard!!  The final product is a fairly decent cake but more like a brownie.  For the price you spend to make it ($6.00) was not worth it.  Not what I was looking for, but for the brownie lover I would send them this way.  Thanx anyway.

I have made this cake for a few years now.  It is my daughter's requested birthday cake each year.  The almond extract gives it a nice flavor and it is a very moist cake. Very good warmed with vanilla ice cream on top.

Quick and easy and excellent.  What else could you want?!  Kind of scary using a full two sticks of butter and 2 cups of sour cream and 2 cups of chocolate chips but hey, you don't eat it all (at once)!  A definite winner!

I literally just finished making this cake ( my first cake ever), and it is so yummy! It is moist, delicious, chocolate heaven. I did however, make a few changes to suit my own personal taste. I used dark chocolate fudge cake mix instead of devil's food, and vanilla extract instead of almond. And instead of just plain semisweet chocolate chips, I used semisweet/white chocolate swirl chips. A subtle, yet very pleasing taste. I also spinkled confectioner's sugar over the top, to make for a lovely presentation. I would highly recommend this cake. It is sooo good, and very easy to make. I like it so much, I'm baking a second one right to take to my work tomorrow.

This cake is wonderful..I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. I was a little worried about using the almond extract but I barely tasted it...will be making this cake many more times! Thanks for the great recipe!

Oh my lord! Sooo wonderfull. I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and ended up sharing it with everyone at the pool hall. I made two square cakes and put caramel between them. I poured a store-bought espresso/chocolate ganache over the top and drizzled with more caramel. Over 14,000 calories total and well worth it.

This cake is absolutely delicious. I simply can't recommend it enough. I've made it probably close to a dozen times by now, and each time it has come out perfectly. I recommend letting it cool very well before taking it out, unless you are serving it warm, which is delicious with ice cream. It's also very good as a layer cake, with thickened pudding between the layers and a light frosting on top.

This was FABULOUS!!! The only problem I had was transfering it from the pan to a wire rack. I think I would let it cool for more than 10 minutes in the pan to help it solidify a little more.

Wow! This is like a mouth full of heaven. I made this for a men's desert bake-off at my church and it won first place. Who ever created this should be rich by now, because this is amaizing.

As a chocolate lover, this cake was okay. I'd suggest not using the almond extract, instead use vanilla. Also, make sure you're using a 10" bundt pan. I've only used mine a few times and didn't even think about checking the size. Luckily, I was able to salvage the cake. I topped it with a few glaze recipes I found on this site, which helped dilute the almond taste.

This is great!  Hard to see if it is done using a stick because of the chocolate chips but I found about 1 hour cooks it perfect.  Delicious!  Pretty when dusted with powdered sugar and sliced on a plate.

This cake is very moist and thats a big A+, I found it to be a little too sweet for my taste but the kids loved it. I will make this again but think I will use the mini semi sweet chocolate chips. And I think that some orange flavoring might be interesting... I did like the subtle taste of the almond extract. Thanx for the recipe.

Very chocolaty and moist. Everyone enjoyed it! I also used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze on top, which added an extra layer of chocolate and made the cake look extra special.

This is very good. I'm not a fan of almond extract (I think it overpowers anything it's in) so I substitute vanilla extract and it's awesome.

I used this recipe to make a birthday cake for my friends mom, and I have to say it was the best chocolate cake I've ever had!  She absolutely loved it and so did I.  I really like the addition of almond extract.  You could really taste it and it was wonderful.  I do have a question, if I wanted to bake this cake in 2 8 inch cake pans instead, how long do I cook it for?

Alhtough this cake presented beautifully, I found the flavor to be bitter and unappealing.  There was no complexity, just bitter chocolate.  I wish, however, it had tasted as good as it looked.

This is a good recipe if you don't want to make a chocolate cake from scratch. Although it was delicious, you can taste that it is made from a Devils Food Cake mix.

This is a very fast and easy way to make a decadent dessert. I definitely recommend using the chocolate chips--they add a lot. I used mini chips and they worked great. I also think the cake is better with some kind of topping. I used a chocolate ganache made with dark choc chips and cream.Absolutely delicious warm with vanilla ice cream.

This cake was really good! I left out the chocolate chips due to personal preference. My only problem was that the outside of the cake got too done before the inside did. I used a silicone bundt pan, which I have never used before, and it seemed to work okay. I used the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" from this site on it also. It made it that much better. I served it to company. Very chocolatey!

Incredible recipe! I made it in a silicone bundt pan, and had to bake about 20 minutes extra, but it was definitely worth the wait. 
For my son's 11th birthday, we frosted it with Butter Cream Frosting II (from this site), and it was sooo incredibly good, and rich. The whole cake was gone in a day!

I was making a cake for a bridal shower and needed to use my flower shape pan and not a bundt.  I kept my fingers crossed!  It turned out fine.  Maybe just a bit too moist.  I would cook it longer next time.  I got tons of compliments on this cake.  They loved it. It made a lot of batter, so I made three layers and put strawberries between the layers. I iced it with the cream cheese icing receipe I found here on the site and it was the perfect match.  I piped a sunflower on the top of the cake and left the sides exposed then piped little flowers around the base.  The deep chocolate next to the yellow was beautiful.  The cake was even better the next day.  Wonderful recipe.  It was rich, but not overwhelming.  I used vanilla butter nut flavoring.  Will definately make again.

We couldn't believe how delicious this cake was! I'm not exactly the most talented chef, however, despite that problem this cake tured out perfectly! I recommend using your Kitchen-Aid mixer or if you don't have one, use a huge bowl and a strong arm.  This has become my husband's FAVORITE chocolate cake recipe, chocolaty and moist, yet not too rich that you can't have seconds!

I took this to work on bring your kid to work day.  Everyone loved it.  The adults were fighting with the kids over it.  Next time I'll try it with vanilla extract since I'm not a fan of almond extract, but it was still great.

Very disappointed in this recipe- much too gooey, not really cake texture at all!  I give it 2 stars because my husband liked it, but it was too messy to serve to guests and really didn't have that much real chocolate flavor.....

This was absolutely the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted!  I made it for my family for Easter and they loved it. Plus, it was super easy for an inexperienced baker!  The only things I did differently were I used light sour cream, used vanilla instead of almond extract, and I added 1 1/2 cups mini chocolate chips instead of the regular chocolate chips.  It turned out perfectly!

I have been making this cake for 30 years, but use 1/4 c. oil,4 eggs & 3/4 c. water, no extract, no butter.
When you unmold it wrap it immediately in foil to hold in the heat and meld together all the chocolate flavours.Best served with whip cream mixed with a bit of instant powdered coffee and a bit of kahula. Cake keeps very well refrigerated and can be frozen and served at a latter date.

The Cake had a good texture but I did not like the almond exract. But that's just my feelings. I gave it 4 stars because you can get the same textute using less eggs maybe three.

The flavor was fabulous!  The only real problem I had was that though it was lovely coming out of the oven, it sunk down to half the height within an hour and was very dense and moist.  Moist is not a strong enough word. Gooey is more like it. I am sure it was cooked through because I sampled it early when it was very very hot and it wasn't gooey then.  One note, be careful if you sub yogurt for sour cream as some reviewers did. I used half yogurt the first time and our yogurt is so tangy that the whole cake was sour.  Satin Chocolate Glaze (from this site) fixed that problem, btw, but the next time I used just sour cream and we opted out of the glaze because it was so dense without.  Did anyone else have it collapse into a dense gooey mass?  Any suggestions?

This cake is AMAZING! This was the first bundt cake I ever attempted, and not only did it turn out perfectly, but it was even more decadent than I imagined.  I put a simple chocolate glaze over the top (it didn't even need that!), and it looked and TASTED like something straight out of a four-star restaurant.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this for the holidays or for anytime!  Just be warned--it is highly addictive!

This cake was awesome!  Rarely would I give 5 stars to a cake without icing.  It was very moist and delicious.  I did not add or take away from the ingredients.  I enjoyed it with a cup of coffee.  Yummy!!

The cake was VERY rich but delicious. However, should I make it another time, I will omit the chocolate chips and substitute it with its equivalent in cocoa. I prefer a smoother texture rather than the crunch of chocolate chips (or use mini chocolate chips).

This cake is fabulous!  Not overpowering with the chocolate...just right.  I love dense chocolate cake, which was the consistency of the cake.  I used vanilla extract and 4 eggs, with only 1 c of sour cream, and I thought it turned out perfect.  Thanks for a super recipe!

This has been a great hit wherever I bring it.  It's so moist and rich that a little slice goes a long way.  For really decadent results, serve it warm with a scoop of ice cream and either chocolate sauce or caramel sauce drizzled on top.  Yummy.  Best of all, it's quick and easy, but tastes like I've really fussed over it.  I love it.

This cake was definately chocolatey. My son's friend said it was the best chocolate cake he had ever had. It took a lot longer to cook than the time indicated. I just kept checking it every 10 minutes after the original time. (mine took 30 additional minutes.

I wanted a dessert recipe to bring to a picnic and found this one. Because of all the positive comments, my expectations might have been a little too high. This was okay but it didn't "WOW" anyone. The batter was very thick, almost like a mousse but heavier, which resulted in a very dense cake. For convenience, I made cupcakes with the batter (which shouldn't have made a difference as cake pans may be substituted for one another). Yes, it was chocolatey but where I was looking for spectacular, this was only average.

This is the best chocolate cake ever, used vanilla extract instead of almond as others suggested and topped with cool whip.  It is a hit everytime I make it.  My husband asks for it everytime there is a special occasion.

I don't really eat cake at all but this cake was the best I've EVER had.  It was so moist!!  I iced it with a powdered sugar icing with 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract.  That totally made the cake.  I will make this again and again!  Thanks.

Taste like a fudge cake.  My 3 year old neighbor called it the best chocolate cake ever.  I agree with one poster that is is VERY IMPORTANT not to use a mix with pudding already in the mix.  It will make the cake overly moist and most likely to fall apart after baking, which seem to be most of the problems in the review.   The cake does sink some as it cools but that is part of it's appeal.  Kind of like one of the "fallen chocolate cake" or "pudding cakes" you can get in restaurants that are dense and kind of wet it the middle. My family likes it best warm with vanilla ice cream.

I was a little disappointed in how this cake turned out.  It was incredibly moist, which I loved, but it just needed something else flavor-wise  -- more sugar, chocolate, maybe vanilla?  I made it for a get-together w/ friends yesterday and commented to my hubby on the way home that I didn't particularly care for the cake and he said he hadn't either.  I followed the recipe exactly.  One thing that could have hurt my cake, though, is that my bundt pan might have been smaller than what they called for (I need to measure it) because there was too much batter for it.  I left some out and STILL had it overflow into my oven.  Though I cleaned it out and scraped the top of the cake off (to prevent another spill during cooking), the "burned smell" from the oven might have penetrated the cake, causing the slight tastelessness.  I might try it again adding some vanilla and some chocolate frosting.  It's definitely worth working on.

WOW!  We didn't know it was possible to squeeze this much fat into a delicious dessert!  It was outstanding and tremendously easy.  The batter is very thick!  It looks more like mousse than cake batter.  The only difficulty we had was with the outside burning a bit before the cake was fully cooked.  After shaving off the outside, though, it was wonderful.  We suggest serving it warm because the flavors aren't as intense after it cools.

I'm not a huge chocolate cake fan but this one is WONDERFUL.  I don't have a bundt pan yet (newbie baker) so used a 10x13 cake pan - I cooked it too long and it burned some around the edges, but it still tastes great!

I love chocolate and this was wonderful.  I made it for company and served it warm with ice cream.  It is very moist and delicious.

This is the second time I've made this.  The first time, it was delicious, but the cake sank, and after refrigeration, it oozed grease.  This time around, I used 4 eggs instead of 5, and used 1/2 vegetable oil, 1/2 water in lieu of the cup of melted butter.  I also used 1/2 almond extract and 1/2 amount of chocolate chips.  It was perfect!  Topped with Cinnamon Coffee Frosting from this site, it was amazing.

I love Chocolate and this cake fell short!  Like others it poured out of the pan when baking, made clean up very time consuming.  With all the chocolate in this recipe you would think it wonderful but the Almond is overpowering.  The pudding does make the cake seem "raw".  Very disappointing.  I made this cake, then had to make another dessert because this was such a disappointment

Oh this was fabulous. I took other's suggestions and swapped the vanilla extract for the almong. Wow was this rich! I topped this with the Chocolate Glaze recipe also from this site for a quadruple chocolate gut buster... :)

This cake came out VERY well.  I've had trouble with bundt cakes before, but this must have been the easiest I've ever tried.  I wasn't totally sold on the taste, although I did have a friend tell me that it was the best chocolate cake he'd ever had... so maybe I'm just too picky.

Liked this cake very much, but was surprised at how powerfully the almond extract flavored the cake.  I might try only 1/2 teaspoon next time, or try 1/2 t almond and 1/2 t vanilla.  I think some sifted powder sugar on top of the cake would enhance the presentation.

Awesome Stuff!  Added a band of Cream Cheese/Pwdr Sugar/Cocoa Mixture to the middle to break it up a little.  Also went ahead w/some simple chocolate icing.  Very, Very, Good.  Very, Very Rich.  Might try a little raspberry syrup in the above mentioned mixture next time.

Everyone in my house loved this cake.  I sprinkled it with powdered sugar--made it look pretty.  I didn't fill the pan all the way-almost 3/4 full.  I used the rest of the batter and made some cupcakes..my husband loves taking them to work as a snack...YUMMY!

This is an excellent chocolate cake!  I made this for my sons birthday party. EVERYBODY loved it! Even the non-cake-eaters enjoyed it. There were no left overs and everyone wanted the recipe.
  I made it in a greased and floured angel food cake pan.  I added the floured mini chocolate chips as suggested. I had no settling and they blended perfectly. I also used vanilla instead of almond extract. For frosting, I made a simple whipped cream frosting with strawberries as a decoration. They were the perfect compliment to the cake.  Make this cake- You won't be disappointed!

I made this cake for my choc-o-holic boyfriend, and all he could say was "wow" with each bite.  This is the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted.  It was so moist and absolutely perfect.  One thing to remember when making this cake is to make sure that all ingredients are at room temperature.  Specially the sour cream, if it is too cold, it will make the batter hard and "pudding like".

Yummy!  We made this and used mocha chocolate mousse as the 'icing'.  Served with a cup of Irish Cream coffee.  D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!

Cut up the leftovers and freeze...the cake tastes just as good as when first baked.

This cake was so wonderful!  It was deliciously moist, and oh so yummy.  People keep asking for more!  One thing I noticed is that the cake rises quite a bit when in the oven, especially the edges.  Be careful of overflow!  I used mini chocolate chips (as one reviewer suggested), and it was excellent!  I didn't have any almond extract around, but vanilla works just as well.  For variety, I also tried mint extract (about half a teaspoon, it's much stronger than vanilla), and it was great!  Anyway, this was a great recipe, thanks!

This cake is absolutely amazing.  If prepared properly, it is light, moist, and incredibly delicious.  A few recommendations: 1) flour the chocolate chips to avoid sinking, 2) per the recipe, do NOT use a 10-inch bundt pan -- IT WILL NOT HOLD THE CAKE!! Instead, use a taller angel food cake pan if possible, 3) (I know, I know...complete common sense, but...you never know...) only use the cake mix and pudding POWDERS...otherwise the cake WILL turn into more of a pudding than a cake! LOL.  Alright...well...again, I thoroughly recommend this cake...truly amazing!

I think we had a major problem.  The cake overflowed in the oven and spilt out everywhere.  When we finally pulled it out it looked so pretty and moist.  But then when I tried to take it out of the pan, which I DID butter, it fell apart and looked like a large deer/elephant took  a dump on my plate.  It tastes great though.   I guess mine was more of a chocolate pudding than cake.  Oh, yea and we couldn't find any boxes of instant pudding in the 3 oz. size.  Okay...bye

Great cake but definitely better without the almond extract. Vanilla worked great.

Made this at 6000 ft.  It was very good considering how fast it was to put together.  My husband declared he doesn't like cake and proceeded to eat the whole thing over 4 days.  I think thats called "denial".

This cake was great!  It was fast, easy and very moist!  I don't think I will use the almond extract again.  Maybe add more chocolate chips!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This cake is fine if you want something not too sweet, but it is not very chocolate flavored at all.  I will not be making this cake again.

Made this last night for a party.  People said it was the best chocolate cake - ever!  Was easy to make though the dough gets pretty stiff and even with the smaller 15 ounce cake-mix it almost overflowed the pan.  Will definitely make this again!

A favorite of our family!  I am even making this one for Father's Day for some friends and their family. One of the great things about it is that with the chocolate covered strawberries, it's like having two different desserts in one!

I made this for a birthday/ welcome back for my friend and myself and it was amazing and I’m definitely not one for cake. I did make some changes for those who might find the chocolate too rich or if you like a little texture in their cake. I just yellow cake mix (mainly I couldn’t find devils food cake mix ANYWHERE) and used chopped almonds instead of extract (ALSO because I couldn’t find it anywhere) Either way it was a huge success

I made this recipe exactly as directed, except I used mini chocolate chips.  On my GOODNESS, this is the BEST chocolate cake ever!  I do not usually like chocolate cake because it usually does not actually taste like chocolate, this cake DOES!!!  Imagine a cake that tastes like a big brownie!!! It is so yummy!  I received LOTS of complements and inquiries about the cake (we used it for a grooms cake.)  It worked wonderfully in a decorative cake pan.  We used a He-Man cake pan.  Try it you will love it!

Excellent cake. My daughter made it for her dad for Father's Day. The entire family enjoyed it. Easy recipe that even an 11 year old could master it. She made it 2 layers instead of the bundt so there was just enough batter. She put fresh strawberries in the middle and on the top. It was delicious!

I love this recipe. Easy to put together, a nice rich chocolate taste. Serve it with strawberries..yum. I used dark chocolate pudding, Duncan Hines Devils food and dark chocolate chips. My mother is a chocolate snob and loved this one.

The only changes I made was to use a Ghiradelli Chocolate  cake mix instead of Devil's Food, and vanilla extract instead of almond.  The batter had an almost mousse-like texture.  I have a large bundt cake pan, and so used the entire amount of batter.  While baking it rose quite a bit, but then fell some while cooling.  It came out very moist and chocolatey.  I covered it with the chocolate  "Pro Ganache" from this site.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This is a  moist, very delicious cake, I made it for a cook out with my neighbors.  They all raved about it!  I didn't like the glaze I chose to use on it, not because of the taste, but because it wasn't pour-able.  I will definitely be making this again but with a different glaze!!!!

I let it sit in the bundt pan about 20 mins but  when I turned it over, a big chunk stuck, ruining the cake because its for someones birthday. Im headed back to the store. This time I will let it cool probably overnight and use mini chocolate chips because there were a bunch of chip chunks stuck to the bottom. It tastes good though

The cake has such a good flavor. I made it three times in one week. The chocolate chips fall to the bottom which is actually the top of the cake and melts. That is the best part. Love this cake.

Made this for my daughters birthday as she hates cakes with frosting. She loved it! In her words, it's like fudge, brownie and cake all in one. Note I subsituted almond extract for vanilla and used mini morsels.

Came out perfect - nice spongy texture, very good chocolatey flavour. I substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream, and only used about 80% of what the recipe called for (I only had 400 ml on hand which is about 1.6 cups), used vanilla rather than almond extract, and threw in a dash of Kahlua because of course I did. Would not recommend using almond extract. Some sort of drizzle overtop would have made it even better, I think. As others have said, don't overprocess it (two minutes with an electric mixer on the lowest setting was plenty), and make sure to grease the pan really well.

I used this exact recipe but with smaller bundt pan (6 cakes to a pan).  I did this multiple times and 27 mins @ 350 seemed to be the best time. Great recipe!

My daughter hates cake, but this is the cake she requests every year for her birthday. She said it's not cake, but a large, decadent brownie! That it is. We serve it with a sprinkling of raspberries, and whipped cream - yum! Thank you so much for the recipe.

More like a brownie/pound cake consistency...VERY dense.  Still tasty, but too dense to call a cake.  I'd cut the sour cream, butter, and chocolate chip qty in half.

I've made this cake twice now and probably will many times again. It wasn't too much batter for me. I thought it would be but it turned out just right for the cake I was making. But the advice that others gave given is sound. The recipe is right on, just watch that your mix doesn't already have pudding in it and don't over process the cake! 

Mix the wet first, then add the dry and mix it just enough. 1-2 minutes. 55 minutes was perfect for my oven. Always gets raves!

I have made this dozens of times now.  I have mini bundt pans that I use for the extra batter and glaze with the satiny chocolate glaze found on this site.  This is my most requested recipe!

I have browsed over this recipe several times (it's in my "favorites" book), but never gave second thought to making it. I was at my local grocery store, and, while browsing through the magazine section, met a lady who I began to have conversation with. We both LOVE Allrecipes (go figure!) and started talking about recipes we had tried. She suggested this one - with a couple of modifications (i.e. substituting Ghirardelli dark chocolate cake mix and mini chocolate chips, baking in a 9x13 pan and frosting with melted white chocolate chips). I tried her suggestions, except I frosted my cake with Betty Crocker vanilla frosting (I don't care for white chocolate that much). Brought this to work and was surprised to see that it was not devoured (I've brought many dishes to work and they were licked clean), but I think it has to do with timing (I made this in the spring) - everyone is trying to shed those winter pounds : ) I didn't care for this b/c of the dark chocolate flavor (I don't care for the taste, but, b/c I was making this for a crowd, and knowing that dark chocolate is so well-received, I gave it a whirl). I think the batter was better than the finished product (but watch, it is REALLY thick and difficult to mix). One other point to note: use mini chips (I didn't have any on hand). The regular-sized chips don't melt completely. I may make this again (as directed) to see if I like it better. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for my husband last Valentines Day and he says it's his favorite chocolate cake ever...that says a lot because he is the ultimate chocolate lover. I drizzeled mine with white chocolate and strawberries...next time Ill probably do a glaze or something. Its super moist... and definately worth the calories!

Too much sour cream, too much butter and the almond extract took away from the chocolate taste of the cake.  It was way to wet when it had cooked for 55 minutes and the outside was way too done.  Will not make this again.  The best chocolate cake is the Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe frome this site.  If you really like chocolate try that one

This is the best chocolate cake...almost as dense as a brownie. It taste even better the next day after it's had a chanceto sit and become denser. I made it in a full size tube pan-had plenty of room but it did take an extra 15 mins to bake thru. For the little effort this takes, it's a wonderful dessert. Topped it with the satiny chocolate glaze and it was totally yummy. It's so rich though that unless you have a crowd of people, you'll have leftovers cause you can only eat a little at a time. ***addition...made this a second time and forgot to but 2 c sour cream. only used 1 and it wasw every bit as good as the 1st one. My office LOVED this.

Yum!  I did not have semisweet chocolate chips and used milk chocolate chips (the regular sized ones are not too big) instead and it still turned out great.  I got all of the batter in the pan even though my cake mix had pudding in the mix and as it was baking it was puffing out the top but it did not overflow. The cake will sink down a little when it cools and is just fine. Make sure to serve this with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream. I just dusted the cake with powdered sugar. Delicious and easy!

Amazing!! I've had blah results every time I've tried to make a homemade chocolate cake, but had never tried adding to a store-bought mix. I should have tried it sooner! This cake is pure wow. Better than any bakery cake I've ever had. I didn't have any troubles at all and didn't change anything except I used vanilla instead of almond extract. YUMMY!

Wow!  This is the best chocolate cake ever.  Very rich.  The aroma while it was baking told me there was something special in the oven!  No need to divide between 2 pans.  Just follow the directions.  The cake will rise above the bundt pan while baking, but then settle back down while cooling.  The ONLY change I made was using mini chocolate chips.  I drizzled icing on the finished cake and added strawberries as pictured.  It made a nice presentation.

Excellent.  Didn't have almond extract, so I used orange.  Used 1 cup mini morsels, and 1 cup special dark chips.  Baked in an tube pan, no problem.  Served with fresh whipped cream and whole strawberries.  Delicious!

If any of you love Applebee's brownie fudge dessert you will want this recipe!  I used a bundt pan and filled within 1 1/2 inch.  Also MINI chocolate chips.  Serve with chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream.  Simply heaven!

This cake is so increadibly delicious!!  I replaced some of the butter with applesauce and left out the chocolate chips.  I actually really liked the almond extract in this cake, so I'll stick with that instead of mixing it with vanilla extract.  I'll be making this again!

Best chocolate cake I have had so far. It is easy to make and very delicious. Thanks to another reviewer's comment I omited the chocolate pudding because the cake mix that I bought had a cup already in the mix. It turned out very moist. I will definitely make this cake again.

Oh what fun I had making this. I did hold back a little of the batter as stated in another post. I baked it in the Nordic ware fairytale cottage bundt pan and then sifted powdered sugar over. Smells and looks and tastes delish.

This recipe was great.  Really easy and turned out wonderful.  My husband even asked me if I got the whole thing from a box.  I threw some flour on my nose and told him I worked all day!!!  Easy and good.

I'm not crazy about chocolate, but this was delicious. All of my friends were impressed. I used 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp almond extract. I didn't have any more batter after filling it up to 1.5" from the top. It didn't overflow. I baked it for about 55 minutes and left it in the oven for about another hour or two just b/c I didn't have space to put it elsewhere. Thanks for the recipe!

This cake is better than some I've had at five star restaurants...and you can present it with a few rasperries on top. Rather than just the almond extract, I also added almond liquer. I also made a chocolate glaze with chocolate/almond liquer...totally deadly. The addition to toasted almonds to the batter, well you can imagine the response The semi-sweet chips are amazing.

This was a very good cake!  It was very rich, and I'm not that big on chocolate, but I still liked it. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but when it was baking the batter rose above the pan and when I took it out, it fell and made an indention on the side of the cake. Still looked nice though. I used "satiny chocolate glaze" from this site as well.

I had started to combine ingredients for this cake and realized that I only had 1/2 cup sour cream.  So I decided to make up the difference with 2 flavored yogurts since that was all that I had.  It turned out very good without tasting fruity at all.  Very moist and not at all wet like other reviewers have described.

Very good cake, good flavor, took other's suggestion and used Vanilla Extract instead of Almond. Made Caroline's Fudge Frosting (recipe on this site) and drizzled over cake. Let cool in pan about 30 minutes or more and came out fine, without sticking or falling.

Excellent chocolate cake.  It's very moist, dense and very chocolatey.  I topped mine with a ganache, which was a bit too much.  This cake can definitely stand on its own.  It's become a favorite!

OH MY GOD! I just finished eating this and it was AMAZING! I don't know what these people are smoking that gave it a bad rating..it was fantastic. My husband HATES cake and he LOVED this. He said it was more like a brownie than cake. My take was it was rich like a brownie, but light and airier like a lava cake. I served it warm with homemade whipped cream. Mmmmmmm! Next time I think I might serve with icecream and a rasberry sauce. The almond in it was a nice touch although I might add just a touch more next time. My kids also loved it..but hey, it's got sugar so what do you expect? I will definatly be making this for my inlaws next time..I will be a HERO! Thanks so much for this recipe!

Original Review: I was quite disappointed with the cake.  I made this cake as written.  It shouldn't be called Chocolate Lovers Cake, but Chocolate Almond Cake.  The Almond taste is overpowering.  Second Review: Made a second time, about a year later.  This time with vanilla instead of almond.   After waiting for it to completely cool overnight we tried a slice in the morning.  The cake is so moist and rich, those who aren't expecting a really dense  brownie like cake may be disappointed.  In reality, that's what it tasted like.  The texture is more like that of a brownie just out of the oven.  Very fudgy...yet surprisingly light at the same time!  Melt in your mouth might be a way to describe it.  I cut 1/3 inch slices, dusted generously with powdered sugar and that was enough to satisfy.  So rich you can't each much in a sitting!

Very easy to make, and delicious! It was my first time baking a bundt cake and it came out just right! If you really want to go all-out, try icing it with Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting - they make a rich and yummy combination.

This recipe was awesome!  I was really looking for something from scratch so I could adjust it, which I did, but using the box cake took the guess work out of it all!  I made the following changes, instead of the pudding I used a half a box of instant white chocolate pudding, instead of the sour cream I used 8oz. of vanilla yogurt, I used Vanilla extract instead of almond and I omitted the chocolate chips.  I also added 16tsp. of cranberry concentrate and stirred in dried cranberries (which I sat in water for 15 minutes to reconstitute) and chopped walnuts.  The results---wonderful, a light cake (I expected dense) with great flavor, it even baked even (made it hard to taste :))  Made a orange cream cheese frosting for on top.  Will definetely try this recipe again, Thanks!

A big yummy treat.  I used tin foil pie pans since I wanted to make a layer cake. They were 8” and I could have used three as opposed to two. Since I only used two pans I had enough batter left over to make 4 small mini bundt cakes. I spray butter flavor pam cut 2 round pieces of parchment paper for the bottom and greased the sides with butter. Let this cool at least 20 – 30 minutes. The cakes will slip out of the pan but just remember to peel off the parchment paper before layering. I thought the batter was too thick, almost brownies texture so I decided to add ½ cup evaporated milk and ½ cup of water. I did replace the almond extract with the vanilla. I also used butter in place of the oil, DO NOT overfill. Fill no more than 2/3 or you will have a huge overflow and make sure you place under a cookie sheet. BTW the overflow tastes great. This cake tasted fantastic, a rich lighter texture since I added the liquid. Omit the liquid if you want it denser. Do warm for a richer taste. I made a raspberry layer with extra raspberry sauce.  This is now my basic chocolate cake recipe.

Very good, I used a cup of white chocolate chips and the cake tastes awesome. I also used 6 foiled baking cups and put the rest in the pan to avoid overflowing. The baking cups only need half or less of the baking time and although they fall flat they turned out wonderfully.

I made this cake twice and got rave reviews both times.  Only thing- use MINIATURE chocolate chips.  The cake I made with the minis turned out much better.

If you like chocolate you'll love this cake! I didn't have almond extract so I added some chopped almonds and it tasted great! I also didn't have a wire rack to cool it on so I tried to use the microwave rack...don't try it. It sunk through so I ended up picking up hot cake and trying to put it back together on a plate.:) Still tasted great smashed. lol

I thought this cake was just ok, it just didn't have the WOW factor I was expecting after reading the reviews. It wasn't bad, just wasn't fabulous either.  I agree with the lady who said it tasted like a spruced up cake mix, definatley had that cake from a box flavor.  I used a duncan hines cake mix.  Tasted like a box cake with chocolate chips thrown in.  It was easy though.

This recipe produces a super-rich, delicious cake.  My only concern is the almond extract.  Normally I love anything with almond/amaretto flavoring, but I felt it was unnecessary in this one.  I may try it without the next time and see if I like it better.  My husband loved it for his birthday cake, though!

I made this cake for Valentine's day of '05...It does taste very similar to boxed cakes, but slightly denser and with melted chocolate chips throughout. I give the cake itself four stars, but if you top it with Hershey's Cocoa Cappuccino Mousse it's absolute perfection...ALSO...PLEASE NOTE THAT IF YOU PURCHASE CAKE MIX WITH PUDDING ALREADY IN IT, YOU SHOULD DECREASE ONE EGG AND ONLY ADD HALF OF THE 3.8 OZ. BOX. YOU MIGHT EVEN DECREASE THE BUTTER OR MARGARINE BY A TINY BIT. I had to do this, but the cake came out fine. Last but not least, the cake topped with mousse looks great when garnished with raspberries, if you want something extra fancy.

Yum Yum!!  Chocolaty and moist.  A real keeper.  I used two 9 in baking pans instead of a bundt and it turned out great!  This will be a mainstay of my dessert recipes.

i bake for my dad's police district. when i first read this recipe and saw that cake mix was involved, i was a bit skeptical (i don't like cheating) but after reading the reviews, i thought i'd give it a shot. well, let me tell you, one of the guys at my dad's police district asked for my hand in marriage after eating that cake! i also used 'satiny chocolate glaze' on top. next time i'll have to actually have some myself ! thanks for the great recipe.

Loved this cake!  Used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe from this site to top it.  It certainly does not NEED a topping, but it does look better with one!  My mother-in-law says this is a "widow-maker" cake!

I love this recipie! Mix it well or it will be cake-like in texture. Also, make sure you use a big bundt pan, because it does make alot. During the holidays, replace the almond extract with mint extract. Yummy!

This is a fabulous cake!  I have made it twice and it is a huge hit.  Plus I love that it is sooo easy and doesn't need frosting!  I like it better without the almond extract and I found I have to bake it about 15 minutes longer than the recipe says.  I just sprinkle it with confectioners sugar when cool and it is such a pretty cake to serve.  It is great for picnics and potlucks.  You can just pick up a piece and eat with your hands!

I made this recipe for my husband who is a chocoholic.
  I altered the ingredients a bit to try to cut some fat, I used only 1/4 cup of butter + 3/4 cup applesauce.  I used 2 eggs and 6 eggwhites.  I used only 1 cup chocolate chips.  It baked up nicley but wasn't very nice looking so I said forget the fat.  I melted 3/4 cup dark chocolate chips  then add 3/4 tbls corn syrup and 3 tbs butter mix together and drizzled over the cake.  Wow.  Husband Loved I loved, Friends loved , I took the last 4 pieces to work and everyone wants your recipe.  I allso used low fat sour cream

This cake is indeed moist and delicious and needs no frosting, however you may want to add a frosting or a light glaze to make it more aesthetically pleasing.  A delicious cake, perfect for take-ins at work or for a quick dessert.

We used the vanilla extract instead of almond.  Very rich so icecream does lighten it up a bit!

Luscious! I used vanilla instead of almond extract but otherwise followed the ingredients precisely.  I did reserve about 1/2 cup of batter and do think the cake would have otherwise overflowed (it got pretty high!). This cake was absolutely incredible - we'll make it again and again.

Loved this cake!  I didn't think it would take a whole 55 minutes to bake but it does and it's worth the wait.

Yes! Yes! Yes!  This is the best chocolate cake ever!!!!!  I adored the moist consistency of the cake.  It was almost fudgy.  This is one my top 3 favorite cakes.  I will make this cake so much that I will have the recipie memorized. CAUTION:  I took the advice of several others and only put ~3/4 of the batter in and it didn't overflow the pan while cooking. It made an additional 6 large cupcakes.

I bought cake mix with pudding already in the mix (oops!), but it was easily remedied...  the cake mix already had 1 cup of pudding in it, a package of pudding makes 2 cups, so I only used half a package of pudding.  I used only 4 eggs and left out the almond extract.  It turned out perfect.  I've baked it with choc chips and without... it's great either way!  Leftover batter?  Make cupcakes.

This was the hit of the BBQ!  I had company coming over in 4 hours and I needed a decadent dessert.  Instead of chocolate pudding, I used french vanilla pudding mix then I used vanilla extract instead of almond and then I added the toll house mini morsels.  The taste was decadent, fluffy and with a dollop of cool whip, the bundt cake was gone in minutes.

Alrite, this is the first time I baked a cake. For a first-timer, it is considered a success. Thanx to the many reviewers below, I'll stress it too,.. DO NOT USE A CAKE MIX WITH PUDDING IN IT.. (like the doughman brand.. you know which..) Duncan Hines really worked well(my trial run was a mess.. cos I used the wrong cake mix..)! I used 4 eggs instead of 5 and it's still great.., vanilla essence cos I dislike almond flavour. As for the choco chips, I only used half the packet and chopped up a portion. Works really great. My bf liked it and he brought it to campus where all my friends at camp snatched for it! Some even asked where I bought it.. hurhur, my best friend was like whining that she wants one for her bday too... Perhaps a lil too costy though! A lil whip cream will be nice..

I have been eyeing this recipe for a long time and I finally decided to use it last night. It turned out beautifully. The cake was not too moist at all. Everyone liked it, even my mom, who doesn't usually prefer chocolate cakes. I followed people's suggestions and added flour to the chocolate chips. I used an angel cake pan to avoid an overflow.

So good and so easy! This cake was very moist and delicious. If there were more than two people in my house it would have been gone the first day. I will make this again. Try topping with a chocolate glaze or cooking with cherry pie filling. Mmmmm!!

I have made this recipe several times and everyone absolutely loves it.  I like making a double-batch, so I can fill the bundt pan a little bit more, and then used the rest for cupcakes.

I thought this cake was fabulous!! Moist as ever.  I used vanilla extract instead, (not much of an almond flavored person) I wasn't going to ice it, but that chocolate butter cream can icing made it double fabulous! You must be a chocoholic for this one.

This cake was off the charts! If you like chocolate at all, then you will love this cake. It is moist and the chips within bring out even more of the chocolate flavor. I used vanilla extract instead of the almond extract. I used Chocolate Fudge can frosting and oh MY was it good.

I gave this recipe a five, because of the great taste. I just don't think I will make it again, because I don't think it tasted any better than a cake mix w/ pudding it already w/ chocolate chips mixed in it. Which is much easier and probably less calories.

I made this cake for a friend's birthday and we really liked it.  I used mint extract instead of almond extract which was really nice flavor.  Instead of mixing the chocolate chips in the batter I sprinkled them on top of the batter once it was in the pan and then covered them with the littlel batter I scraped from the sides of the pan, so the melted in more rather than having chunks of chocolate as other reviewers had mentioned.  I only used 4 eggs instead of 5 cause that was all I had home, which might have been why it didn't turn out quite as good as I was hoping.  I will definately make this again using the mint extract.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made this cake three times. The first two for family events and I used the almond extract. I didn't really like the after taste of the almond. I substituded the almond extract with mint extract on the third cake and it was a huge hit. It tastes like chocolate chip mint. We topped it with a little bit of whipping cream. Yummy!!

I made this cake yesterday for my husband's birthday and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD! I didn't change a thing in the recipe ~ other than the fact that I frosted it. Wow, the almond extra really makes the flavor unique ~ but OH SO GOOD! I think this cake was the moistest chocolate cake I've ever made. Simply the best! Thanks for a great recipe! :o)

Seconds, thirds, fourths... You'll keep going back till it's all gone. It is supposed to be moist inside, don't wait till the toothpick comes out clean or the cake will be dried and may burn at the bottom (top when flipped).

This cake was fabulous. Its only bad mark is its fat content (2 c. sour cream, 1 c. butter, 5 eggs, and 2 c. choc chips), and therefore I'll only make it for a special occasion. But it fit the bill for my daughter's request: a very chocolately birthday cake. I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site and it made it even more decadent and delicious.

I read some of the previous reviews before I made this cake, which was out of this world wonderful! I did make a few changes, instead of the sour cream I used nonfat plain yogurt 1 1/2 c, and 1/2 c sour cream, I used fat free & sugar free pudding,4 eggs,  and then I melted the choc chips w/the butter and it came out wonderful, every one in my office loved it! Thanks Susan!

Very good cake and extremely easy to make.  It was very moist but I found that the degree of "chocolatiness" depended on the bite you got.  I tried it with powdered sugar because it looked too plain.  I tried it again with a simple chocolate glaze (from a betty crocker cookbook) and it looked and tasted better.  Definately a keeper but not worth all the hype.

Wonderful recipe!  Took it to my family reunion and everyone raved!  Very moist and great for a  chocolate fix.  Super easy to make.  Definitely use mini chocolate chips.  Powdered sugar on top made for a great presentation.  Thanks for the recipe!

TOTALLY delicious and decadent!! My family loved this, especially my two year old. It was so rich and moist and tasted fabulous with vanilla ice cream. I have been searching for a great chocolate cake for a 4th of July party and now I have found it. Thanks Susan, I will be making this one a lot!!!

We all loved this cake.  Made it for my mother-in-law's bday and she raved.  We especially like it because it's such a good chocolate cake that needs NO icing on it.  What a hit...moist, chocolatey...any chocolate lover will enjoy.  And of course, my 2 yr old ate it up too!

This is a very good recipe and my whole family enjoyed it.  I poured my batter into a bundt pan and I had enough batter to make 8 cupcakes.  There is no way all the batter would fit in my bundt pan.  My husband really liked this cake too.

Yum! Yum!  Yum!  I took this to our family get-together for Easter and everyone loved it!!  I used an angel food cake pan, vanilla extract and milk chocolate chips (that's what I had in the pantry)and it was great.

Oh dear! This was a soggy mess!  I recommend less pudding mix.  It overflowed and there was a lot to clean up.  It tasted good though but I had to throw it all away!  A complete disaster and not a recipe that I will try again in a hurry!

Not bad - very chocolatey, dense and moist.  Felt that the texture was a bit like 'pudding', which i was not after.  Having said that, it was a big hit with my family.  Still searching for the ultimate 'mud' cake.

Wonderful chocolate cake. My family loved it. Not the nicest to look at so I dusted it with icing sugar. This is a easy and deliciously moist cake. I would definately make it again.

The taste of this cake was incredible!  However, I like some others, had a problem with the cake falling totally apart.  I live at high altitude and did not adjust for that.  Most recipes come out fine with no adjustment.  The cake tasted so good, that I will try it again.  Since it fell apart, we couldn't take the cake to the party it was intended for, but my husband and I loved it and ate almost all of it within a few days.  It was wonderful!

Cake turned out very well.  It is a little bit too oily with the butter and the sour cream. I don't know if the taste is worth the calories.

This was for sure Chocolate!It was Good...but I'm not sure about the almond extract, I could taste it very strong. And to me, seems to take away from the chocolate flavor, strange combination. Just didn't do anything for me.

I received all great comments when I made this for an office party.  Because it is so moist a batter, I cooked it for about 15 minutes extra.  A great, moist chocolate cake.  So good, I do not frost it, it stands alone.

Why did my cake rise way above the pan and take over an hour to cook??? After it was finally done, it came out tasting pretty good, but not phenomenal. We warmed it up and served it with Godiva White Chocolate Raspberry ice cream and there were definitely no complaints, but we probably won't be making it again.

I've been making my mom's chocolate cake since I can remember. Not anymore! :)  This beats any chocolate cake recipe ever!!
Since the batter is so moist, I found that it took a little longer to bake in the center than the edges but it may be my oven.

This cake was deliciously rich.  I used the wrong kind of pan, which made it sink in the middle.  To cover this up, I sliced strawberries and drizzled chocolate syrup on top.  Despite my ineptitude, it was still a hit!  The next excuse I have to make this cake, I am going to try using the proper baking pan and serving it with fresh raspberries!

Made this for Easter Sunday and my husband is already requesting it again. He loved the taste, texture, everything! I used mini-chips and even only used half the amount called for and it was still a hit.  I think you can also cut back a bit on the butter, too, if you're in a pinch.  Grease your Bundt pan thoroughly and you should not have a problem getting it out.  Mine was picture perfect.

Delicious! I made this for Easter and everybody LOVED it! I used vanilla extract, mini chocolate chips, and dusted the cake with powdered sugar. A new family favorite!

This was the best chocolate cake I have ever eaten!  I made it for a Birthday cake for my sister-in-law's party, and everyone just loved it. I will definitely make this one again. Thank you so much Susan Feiler!

I LOVE this recipe.  Everyone always raves over it, and it is so easy to make.  I use butter flavored Crisco instead of butter...I think it makes it more fudgy.  Anyway, it's fabulous!

I must admit, I am not a chocolate fan, but my husband and son are so I made this cake and the reviews are : GREAT!! WONDERFUL!! My son's friends asked me to take it to their school easter party. I guess, this recipe is a keeper.
Really moist. Thank you for posting it.

Amazing!  This is the first recipe I have ever rated, and I thought it deserved the credit.  This cake is very rich, but goes down so smoothly that you feel wonderful after eating it.  I simply used a non-stick pan and sprayed it with Pam.  I had absolutely no problems getting it out.  I also used the mini chocolate chips and vanilla instead of almond.  Any variation would be wonderful.  Experiment and have fun with the recipe.

This cake has been my favorite since I was pregnant (over 2 years ago) I make it every time someone asks me to bring something. I use walnuts instead of the chocolate chips.

Next time I'll reduce or omit the almond extract.  I thought the almond flavor was too pronounced.  Other than that, however, I think the recipe is great.  Nice moist texture, and rich without being cloyingly sweet.  I'll make it again, for sure.

Very intense chocolate rush!  I made two of these cakes for my son's birthday party.  I sifted a bit of powdered sugar on one of them just for looks.  The other cake fell apart a bit when I attempted to remove it from the pan.  I followed the other posters' suggestions and allowed it to cool completely, but still got some crumbling.  I put a white buttercream frosting on that one to conceal the evidence.  (I couldn't bring myself to use chocolate frosting because I thought it would just be cocoa overload!  The cakes were moist, not too sweet and certainly live up to their name as - "Chocolate Lover's Favorite Cake".  I would advise cutting thin slices because this is so rich.

I have a family of chocolate lovers and I just made this cake tonight and everyone gave it a thumbs up and said this was definitely a serious chocolate cake.  It was very quick and easy and I followed the tips and it turned out perfect.  Thanks Susan, I'm sure this one will be found in our home a lot.

I have made this cake many times and it is always a big hit. Take the recipe with you because everyone will want it. The only thing I dont use is the almond extract. I just dont like the flavor so I leave it out. It is a great cake for choclate lovers. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!

I thought this cake was great but my boyfriend thought it was way too sweet.  It was very moist and rich.  I used Jennifer's Chocolate Glaze (recipe on this site)on the cake - next time I will not add any topping.

This cake is delicious if you are a huge fan of Chocolate. I did not use the extract. This cake also makes for great mini-bundt cakes. Served slightly heated with some vanilla ice it the best!

This cake was excellent.  I brought it to a Hanukkah party yesterday and everyone raved about it all afternoon.  I poured a chocolate glaze over the top while it was still warm (the chocolate glaze was also from all recipes), and sifted powdered sugar over top.  I used malted milk balls along the bottom to make it look like it was sitting in a pearl necklace.  It looked and tasted fabulous-Thanks Susan!

I loved this recipe! I just had a piece of it a few minutes ago and it was delicious. I used mini chocolate chips but that was my only change. The only problem I had was half way through the baking the gas ran out on my stove and the oven quit on me. So about 3 hours later the gas man gets me running again. By this time the cake had fallen. I turn the oven on and throw it back in and about 30 to 40 minutes later it came out perfect. That's a first for me! Never give up! Definitely a keeper recipe.

Delicious and easy.  It's more like a rich brownie than a cake--great with vanilla ice cream.  It's become my favorite chocolate dessert!

What can I say....this cake is awesome!  My whole family loves chocolate and this cake definately meets our requirements on all aspects of chocolate.  It is is moist, flavorful, and believe it or not but not as sweet as one would expect.  Delicious, scrumptous!  Need I say more.

This went beyond wonderful!!!  I took some of the other suggestions and greased and floured my pan, I also used mini-chips instead.  I had no problem with overflow.  I also made a ganache to go on top, which is VERY simple, the name makes it sound fancy. My hubby is NOT a dessert guy and he had four pieces in one day!!!  I will make this again!!!!!!

I made this cake for my husband in June for his Birthday.  Everyone must of loved it because I am always asked to make this cake for other family birthday's.  This week my nephew requested his choice of cake to be this one, I was thrilled he had requested me to bake this cake out of all the cakes that are shared with other family members.  Looking forward to making this cake once again.  Thanks again.  ps reading the reviews, I had never had any problems with the 4 times I baked this cake.  Enjoy:)

This is one of the best cakes i've ever made! In addition to greasing the pan, I floured it and had no problems with sticking. I used mini chips and layered them. I also used a chocolate glaze while the cake was still warm.

I made this sensational cake for my grandson's 7th birthday and everyone loved it.  Just added confectioner's sugar for a topping after reading all the ingredients, it sounded like it was sweet enough without putting any icing on top.  It was just right.  I did a variation on the chocolate chips.  I used only 1 cup of mini choc. chips because I felt that it would be too much chocolate.  Filled the tube pan just half way after reading about the people who had trouble with the batter flowing over the pan.  Had no such problem and the cake was absolutely great.  Have e-mailed it to my sister who has lots of choclate lovers in her family.  THANKS FOR THE TREAT.

Great cake (I omitted the almond extract though).The chips don't really melt so you could totally skip that part if you didn't want to bite into chips and wanted a smooth texture. Kind of wish I would of did that. But the cake itself is excellent! Thanks for the recipe Susan.

I made this for a three-year old's birthday party and it was WONDERFUL!!!  I also used vanilla instead of almond extract and it turned out great.  I then iced it with the Hershey's Buttercream Frosting and the entire thing was heavenly :)

This was the best chocolate cake I have ever had.  I am glad that I took the suggestion of not putting on a frosting because it did not need it.  Very very rich!  Make sure you have some milk on hand.  I also took the suggestion of layering the chocolate chips.  It turned out great!!!

I am not a chocolate lover.  I made this for my husband who is the chocoholic.  He had to fight me to get to the cake. This is absolutely delicious and very easy to prepare.

I made this for Mother's Day and it turned out wonderful.  Easy to make and it was delicious, I took the advice of others and left it in about 7 minutes longer and it came out perfect.  I had no problem with it sticking.

This was amazing, everyone loved it! However I found it took a bit longer to cook and it was very difficult to remove from the cake pan (and it was well greased). Maybe all my chocolate chips were settled there, any suggestions? I am making it for again Easter so even lopsided this cake was terrific!!!

Gets top marks for ease!  Very good, made for my dad's 81st b-day and then took some to work....raves all around...for those who think it needs more chips, try using Ghiradelli double chocolate chips instead of regular chips...I'm a die-hard chocoholic and it was perfect!

I made this for a recent dinner party and it was truly a wonderful recipe.  I melted a very bittersweet chocolate bar and drizzled over the top then dusted with powdered sugar.  My husband, the chocoholic, is in love!  Thank you for sharing Susan.  I'll definately be using this recipe again and again.

Whole family gave it thumbs up.  I did add chopped walnuts for my nutty family.  Recipe was easy and delicious.  Make sure and keep covered it does get hard in two days-but if it does serve with ice cream and mix it up. yum

So easy and there is no chance you could mess this one up! I did go with the suggestion of layering the chocolate chips and that kept them from settling at the bottom.

This is a wonderfully rich, moist cake that is fabulous paired with a tall glass of milk. I've made it for company twice now and it has a pretty presentation when lightly dusted with confectioner's sugar once it is cooled.

WHenever I need to make a chocolate cake, this is the one I'm making from now on.  I was amazed at how good this was.  I frosted mine and spinkled nuts, and used vanilla instead of almond extract and it was delicious.

This cake was a hit with my family. It's a keeper in my recipe book!  Great Chocolate Cake!  Thanks for sharing the recipe with us!  If only there was a way to take out all those calories.  I guess that's what makes it so good though!

I couldn't stop eating this cake!!  It was very moist, dense, and chocolatey.  It doesn't need frosting, but I think it would be delicious with some type of sauce drizzled over it (raspberry?).  I substituted one cup of peanut butter chips and it was excellent!  After reading all the comments, I decided to stick to the vanilla extract.  I don't normally bake cakes from a mix, but it was incredibly easy and I am tempted to make it again!

Made this cake twice in one day.  Once for my chocolate loving son-in-love's birthday.  He loved it!  One for my neighbors to taste test.  Rave reviews from all.  Will try 'layering of chocolate chips' to  spread them around, otherwise they settle to the top.  Add vanilla ice cream, and a light dusting of powdered sugar.  A chocolate lovers dream come true!

This cake is wonderfully rich and moist.  The only problem I had is that the chocolate chips sunk to the bottom.  Not sure how to avoid that next time; maybe sprinkle them in layers on top of the batter?  I drizzled chocolate ganache on top of the baked cake.  Totally decadent, but NOT low-cal!

So rich and delicious!  I've been using this cake recipe ever since I first found it at this site.  My nine year old has recently been put in charge of making this cake for bake sales and special guests and has been receiving rave reviews!  Most people seem to love the almond extract.

I loved this recipe!! First time ever making a bundt cake and it turned our superb. I left out the vanilla and added an extra cup of chocolate chips. My husband is a true chocolate lover and he couldn't even finish the piece that I cut for him. Definitely will use this recipe in the future. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe makes a very thick, rich chocolate cake - no icing needed!  A simple sprinkling of confectioners sugar is all I added.  I didn't care for the almond extract & would use vanilla next time.

This cake turned out perfectly!  I made two of them for family Christmas feasts.  They were very moist.  The sweetness is somewhat offset by the semi-sweet choco chips.  I opted for vanilla instead of almond extract and I also dipped out a little batter for a few cupcakes. This way I was able to indulge my addiction in the privacy of my own home!  YUM!!!

If you love chocolate and want a lot of compliments this is it. I have made this about 5 times and everyone just loves it. The sour crean gives the chocolate an interesting taste that no one can figure out.

Absolutely wonderful!  It keeps for several days covered (if it lasts that long), is easy to make, and tastes absolutely incredible.  Just don't try to add up the calories, and try not to feel your arteries hardening as you eat it! :-)

This case was filled with chocholate flavor, very moist, and delicious. The only thing I would change for next time would be to delete the almond extract.
