Oh my. What a fabulous dish. The smell was so good while baking. Chicken was so moist and flavorful and looked so beautiful when plated. Both hubby and I loved this meal.

We loved this recipe, I will definitely be making it again. A few notes: I used chicken broth instead of white wine, because that's what I had. The reason I gave it four stars not five is because while the flavor was great, the lemon overpowered the other spices and flavors. I used 2 whole lemons; next time I will use just 1 lemon and I will juice half and slice half.
