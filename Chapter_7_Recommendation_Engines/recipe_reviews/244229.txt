This cake is so moist and easy to make.  I amended the recipe by adding 1/2 cup applesauce and reduced the oil to 1/2 cup.  Turned out perfect.  It was in the oven for 45 min at 350 degrees.  Will make it again.

This cake was delicious and had just the right amount of sweetness. The texture is fluffy and moist and the flavors are the perfect blend of chocolate, bananas and peanut butter. I substituted coconut oil for canola oil (it's healthier and in my opinion, tastes better), crunchy peanut butter for creamy peanut butter (the peanuts are a nice addition), soy milk for almond milk (just because that's  what I had on hand). I also added a peanut butter frosting on top: 1/2 cup softened butter, 1 cup peanut butter (I use crunchy peanut butter), 1 cup powdered sugar, milk (optional, to adjust thickness).

This is really an amazing cake. I made mine in a round pan so I can make a double layer cake.  Don't make it if you don't like dark chocolate.

I subbed applesauce for oil and regular chocolate flavoured milk instead of almond milk... Will definitely be making again, it turned out moist with perfect blend of tastes.

This is a great cake, you can taste the bananas, peanut butter and chocolate.  It was a hit with non Vegans.   I didn't change anything.  Thank you for a excellent recipe!

Made as written with the exception of subbing semisweet chocolate chips with white chocolate chips (had some that needed to be used) and the addition of 'The Best Chocolate Glaze' from this site. Wow!!! Make sure you have a glass of milk on hand for this cake? brownie? You really can taste the chocolate, banana and the peanut butter.

It turned out great, but I had to keep it in the oven for over an hour. I would suggest raising the baking temp. to 375 and leaving it in for 50 minutes. I didn't do that though. I kept it on 350, and let it bake a while.

Excellent recipe! l used super ripe Ulu (breadfruit) instead of bananas and a few other small changes but it turned out so well, and not overly sweet either.

Made it exactly as written.  Only made 1/2 recipe and baked in a 9 inch square pan.  Was amazing!  Will definitely make again.

I substituted oat flour for wheat flour... coconut oil for the canola oil and white chocolate chips for the semi-sweet.  It is DELICIOUS.  I will be sure to make this again, and again.... we loved it!  Thanks for this great recipe!

This was totally amazing!  I read the reviews and thank-you for the peanut butter frosting - it was perfect!  I also used coconut oil and cake flour and all-purpose mixed, and it still turned out great.  It wasn't heavy either, or too sweet, just right!
