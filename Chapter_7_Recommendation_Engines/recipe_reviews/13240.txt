Good example of westcoast style clam chowder.  Using less water makes for a tastier soup and lets you use fewer potato flakes.  I added some thyme to mine and a little garlic.  Reminds me of the soup served on the ferries and at the White Spot restaurant chain.  Thanks for posting.

Tasted terrible, and looked worse.  I should have followed my instincts.  Tomato-based clam chowder is just wrong.
