These cookies came out with a rich, brownie-like taste.  After putting dough in the fridge like stated, it was still sticky.  I put it in the freezer few a few minutes and was much easier to work with.  I drizzled white chocolate over them and they look very festive for Christmas.

I absolutely loved these cookies.  They are a great different cookie for the holidays.  I especially liked the cookies cold from the fridge.

This is a wonderful cookie, cook 10 minutes for a soft delicious cookie.  They are pretty as well.  I made two batches for a cookie exchange for Christmas and they were a big hit.

BEST cookies my family has ever had!  If you love chocolate covered cherries, you MUST try this recipe.  My daughter (3) loved to help me make the "thumb prints" on them for the cherries.  I've already added this recipe to my recipe box, will make often!

These were outrageously good cookies--every one at our Christmas gathering raved about these cookies.

These were okay.  I don't much like oatmeal in cookies, and these turned out about like I expected them to.  A bit dry for my taste and not really much flavor.  They look pretty though.
