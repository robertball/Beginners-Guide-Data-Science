I'm not sure if this recipe got lost in translation but its directions weren't right. I followed as is and I should've listened to my instincts & experience. First, although I cut the carrot pieces pretty small, I should've grated them. The motor of my blender almost burned out. Second, putting all the ingredients in the blender wasn't such a good idea; it wasn't enough liquid to process until smooth. I had to add more oil. I also transferred the mixture to my food processor otherwise I would be shopping for a new blender today. When it comes to the chocolate sauce, this step I did do my own way. I started on medium, decreased to medium-low and stirred until bubbly and thick. If I would follow the directions and do my sauce on low, it would take me much longer to make the sauce with the same result. Overall the cake tasted good but I found there wasn't enough moisture in it and  if I make it again, I'll add more oil.
