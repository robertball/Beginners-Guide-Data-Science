LOVED IT!!  Used Captian Morgan's spiced rum and it was a wonderful flavor.  Had tons of people tell me it was the best rum balls they had ever had!  Have given three people this recipe so far.  This one goes in my favorites for sure!  Thanks for sharing it.

Quite tasty! I didn't roll them in my hand. I used a small cookie scoop-like an ice cream scoop-with a squeeze handle that ejects the dough. You get a rounded top with a flat bottom. (Perfect for portion control).  I put the ground nuts in a small deep bowl and dropped the dough balls into it. You can do  about four at a time. Just shake the bowl in a circular motion. The dough rounds itself out and coats each one. It really speeds up the process. I gave these as gifts as got rave reviews.

Turned out great! They get better with age. Also, I put the walnuts IN the mixture rather than rolling the balls in them.

Very easy to make, especially with a food processor and a small scoop with a release.  Chilling the chocolate mixture for at least 30 minutes before attempting to form the balls made the process much easier/less messy.

LOVE IT!!!
I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for corn syrup since an old recipe I had didn't call for it so I went with this one. I did not see a vanilla wafer box that was 16 ounces, just 11 & 12. I bought 2 boxes and just added a little at a time from the second box until I got the right consistency. I kept it simple and just rolled them in powdered sugar. I also didn't think that I would need so much powdered sugar so I poured a lot less into the bowl and did just fine.

Is this recipe is really great.  I only tried a sample batch aat first, just to see how they would come out.  When they tell you to let these things set up, you better do it.  Anyway, I ended up making about 200 rum balls this holiday season because everyone loved them so much.

Very tastey!  I followed some ideas of the others and added some of the walnuts to the mixture.  I only found a 12 oz. box of Nilla Wafers so that's all I used. Chopped the Nilla Wafers and the nuts in a grinder for my own sanity.  I also made sure to refrigerate the chocolate mix before forming the balls.  I used a "tiny ice cream scoop" with the release handle and it formed perfect shapes.  I dropped the balls into a bowl of confectioners sugar and nuts and swirled them around for a good coating.  I fit about 4 into the bowl.  Worked great and not too messy.  I will make these again!!!!

Quite tasty the second day.  I made mine with Myers Dark Rum.  

If you omit the crushed walnuts, roll in additional Nilla wafer crumbs before rolling in the cocoa or 10x sugar.  This helps the ball firm up.  I put my additional Nilla wafer crumbs in a ziploc baggie and just shook up the balls in there before rolling in the 10x.  

Make sure you keep these away from the kiddos!

We paired pecans with brandy, because our tree just gave a ton this year.

The results were pretty good, but I think it should be a tiny bit more chocolate tasting and, perhaps, a tad more brandy.

I will play around with this recipe a bit.

Don't get me wrong, it is an excellent basic recipe, but it can be done just a bit. But, for not a whole lot of hassle, I am really happy with this recipe. Yes, I would recommend this to a friend. Sometimes these desserts are like burgers and burritos; everyone's got their own version.

These came out good. I did chill the mixture for a few minutes before attempting to roll, otherwise it would have been too messy. I also think the next time I will mix some of the chopped nuts IN to the chocolate and nilla wafer mixture - they just didnt stick that well to the out side of the balls.

Oh my goodness!  I just made these today and they have been in the fridge for a few hours.  I went ahead and tasted one and just went crazy!  This is an extremely delicious and simple recipe.  I cannot wait to share them with my family tomorrow at our Christmas Eve celebration.  The only thing I changed was I substituted Bourbon for Brandy because my family is a bunch of Bourbon drinkers!  Thanks so much for sharing.  This is a fantastic keeper!

Sorry to spoil the ratings, these looked great but come out very greasy.  After doing some research it seems there are two types of Vanilla Wafers - the round plain cookie and the sandwich wafer.  I used a box marked "vanilla wafers" although they were the sandwich cookies.  Hmmm... I think there needs to be some clarification in the recipe.  I am new to Rum/Brandy  Balls.  I will try the other kind of wafer next time.  :(

It is a great recipe. At first the mixture was a bit sticky so I chilled the mixture for a 15 min before rolling it. I loved the texture of the rum balls. It is very addictive! :-)

These are to die for! I have to double or even triple the recipe every time I make them! I have rolled them in cocoa powder (my personal favorite) and coconut. I added the nuts to the recipe because I couldn't get them to stick to the outside of the balls. Also, I learned the hard way that these really need to be refrigerated before you roll them. I tried without refrigerating and it was just a big sticky mess in my hands.

Best Brandy Balls EVER! I used 12 oz of Vanilla Wafers and added 1/2 cup of Graham cracker crumbs. I also used 1/2 cup of chopped pecans plus a 1/2 cup of Emerald brand glazed walnuts. Just put the nuts together in a food processor for a quick spin and add the chopped/blended nuts to the mixture. Fantastic! For a more pleasant appearance, hand-roll each portion first before rolling in powdered sugar.

Really good-not too sweet and not too boozy.  I refrigerated my chocolate mixture for about an hour before rolling into balls and into chopped walnuts.  I skipped the confectioner's sugar.  The food processor is a life saver with this recipe.

I used to like when my neighbor made rum balls, so I wanted to try this recipe.  In the directions, I would suggest that the nuts be added IN the mixture, as opposed to rolling the balls around them, since the former is easier to do.  I would also suggest that you indicate in the directions that the mixture needs to be refrigerated for at least a half an hour.  This will make it possible to form balls out of the thickened mixture.  In any case, I knew enough to do those steps myself.  I also added a half of tsp allspice, and it tastes good.  I will refrigerate the balls overnight.

What worked for me is to keep your hands powdered with confectioner sugar when forming the balls. The other method that worked was to keep very damp paper towels by you to keep rewetting hands if using the wet method. This are yummy!!!!

Just made these for the first time using a good brand of aged dark rum. Yummy. I had no problem with these at all even using the smaller box of cookies. My mini food processeor made the "chopped fine" ingredients a snap. This recipe is a keeper.

Favourite Christmas recipe to substitute ingredients with. I used spiced rum the first time and like Cece says it is a wonderful flavour. Try using Irish Cream or Kalua next time! I had to play around with the amount of milk and sugar to use since they are heavy and sweet enough on their own but it was worth it in the end. This past Christmas my daughter and her friends used marshmallow vodka and rolled them in graham crackers. I was not a fan of it but they loved it and yes they were all 19 and over which is the legal drinking age here.

Made this last year for cookie exchange. Fun to make with friends too and a simple recipe. Will definitely make again and again - and luckily I can't lose the recipe thanks to allrecipes!

Brandy balls are a holiday favorite at our house and this recipe is perfect every time! They're requested every year, and usually devoured in a day or two!

the two stars is FOR MYSELF. i'm making this at the moment and for some reason, it's not exactly hardening for me to roll into balls. the only thing i did different is the wafers, which i crushed by hand, so of course there were some chunks here and there. but then i took the entire mixture and blended by blender, so it's just a liquid mess at this point. what did i do wrong??

I thought the outcome was a little too mushie for my taste, and not quite rummy enough. I prefer something with more crunch. I omitted nuts since my boyfriend is allergic and it's a good thing because he LOVES this recipe. I would make it again for him, but they're safe with me... not my favorite.
