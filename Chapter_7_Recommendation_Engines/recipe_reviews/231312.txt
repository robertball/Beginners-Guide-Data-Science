I made these muffins this afternoon.  Way to much batter for 12 muffins, should have read the reviews first and made 18.  I had 3 ripe bananas and one ripe mango that I wanted to use up.  I didn't put the icing sugar/lime glaze on as I think the muffins taste good without adding any extras.  I would cut the butter down a bit too.  Muffins are more "cake like" and I think would go well with custard!  They taste very yummy.

Texture was nothing like a muffin. Way too much butter! They were dripping with butter when i took them out of the pan, didn't even bother the glaze.

Incredible!! Don't skip the lime toppings (I wasn't sure if I'd like or I needed it) but a little is DIVINE! 
• My mango was totally overripe and meaty so I used my hands to squeeze off all the pulp and then strained it into the mixture, a little messy but I was nervous about adding all that stringy stuff. Very happy with subtle mango flavor.  
• Used SALTED BUTTER to compensate for not seeing salt in the recipe (I used 1/3cup as indicated was good)
• Also I MIXED INGREDIENTS BACKWARDS; starting with the egg, butter, brown sugar then adding in the flour mixture, strained mango "mess" and after blending very well, folded in sliced bananas -- the result was that I had some banana patches in the muffins,YUM!
• Coated muffin pan bottoms with OLIVE OIL instead of cooking spray and no burns!

I like the concept of the tropical flavors, but the mango got lost!  Cooking time was accurate, good texture, but I think a pinch of salt would benefit this recipe.  My batch made 18 nicely rounded muffins.

Great recipe! I didn’t glaze the muffins.
I ended up adding 1/4 cup walnut and a cup of blueberries.
Scrumptious!

I added a tiny bit of grated cooked beet in place of some banana and mango - we only had a half mango and 2 tiny Mexico bananas... I also added blackberry jam so additions may affect your results, but mine were spectacular! Hubby ate THREE muffins!!  This software wont let me put up a photo....

Tasty! I subbed coconut sugar in place of brown sugar, juiced my mango (as it was suggested in another review) because it was overly ripe, and folded in chopped walnuts.  I also creamed the sugar, butter, lime juice, bananas, and mango before adding in the dry ingredients that I previously combined as was suggested by someone else.  They turned out perfectly!  18 standard sized muffins, not too buttery at all and a delicious texture.  The lime glaze really sets these muffins apart!  Thank you for sharing a great way to use the over ripening fruit I had!

It comes out too soft and flat and took more than 40 minutes to cook.

These muffins are the perfect combination of sour and sweet! Entire family loved them. Perfect amount of batter for 12. I USED 1 CUP BROWN SUGAR INSTEAD OF ONE AND A QUARTER CUP WHITE SUGAR AND THEY TURNED OUT PERFECTLY!!!!!!! Enjoy :)
