I hesitate to give this recipe even one star.  I followed this recipe exactly.  Been making muffins since 1968 and have never had anything come out so awful.  They not only looked unappetizing, but after cooling down, they were hard as a rock!  Went directly into garbage can.  What a waste of good ingredients!

These came out perfectly!! I made a dozen and they were gone in a couple of hours!! (even my husband who is insulted by muffins in general loved them)I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used vanilla soy milk instead of cream since that is what I had on hand, and I added a little bit more milk until the texture seemed right. I was a little worried because of the bad reviews here, but I remembered reading in "The Joy of Coking",that different flours have different properties depending on moisture content and age and how they are stored:some flour will need more milk, and some will need less, so use your best judgement when adding liquid to avoid hard muffins!
Thanks for sharing a super recipe!!

These muffins are FANTASTIC!  I made a couple modifications based on other reviews...and here's what I came up with:  (By the way, I doubled the recipe) I used 3 cups of flour, 1 cup of white sugar, and 1 cup of brown sugar.  All other ingredients were just as the recipe calls for.  I was concerned at first because the batter was very, very thick...but they turned out wonderful.  I took these in to work as a birthday treat for my co-workers and they would not stop raving about them!

I loved these muffins and so did my kids. I doubled the batch and didn't have enough cream cheese so I also used non fat yogurt the only flavor I had was Cream Brule and also didn't have cream so used non fat milk and used 1/4 cup less flour. I also used brown sugar instead of white. They turned out so soft and light not cake like. Thanks for putting the recipe here for me to try!! I will make them all the time now!!

I added more chocolate chips than it called for, they were a huge hit.  The cream cheese adds just a hint of flavor.

I made these for my daughter who loves a similar muffin at our local store. She really liked them, next time I would add a bit more sugar and use mini chocolate chips. I think these changes would make them even better.

I think they're really delicious and my boyfriend loved them.  I modified the recipe by accident by putting in 1 cup flour instead of 2!  It's a blessing in disguise as they turned out to be nicely moist.  Also, I used 300g (instead of 224g) of cream cheese.  The only complain that I have is that they collapsed after I took them out of the oven.  They didn't stay puffed up like they did in the oven.

These are fantastic!  I was so impressed and will hold on to this recipe as a new family favorite.  I used 2% milk instead of cream and doubled the sugar (because we like our muffins sweet).  They were excellent!

I was looking for a strawberry cream cheese muffin.  Didn't find one specifically so I decided to modify this one a bit.  I didn't have cream so I used 1% milk, I used brown sugar instead of white as others had suggested and last I used about 1 1/4 diced strawberries instead of chocolate chips.  Before I added the strawberries I thought the batter looked a little too thick, but after I added them it moistened up nicely.  I will make these again, but next time I will smash the strawberries & add a little white sugar to them to sweeten the muffin up a little more.  I'm sure they would have been sweeter with the chocolate chips.  One other thing I baked them at 350 vs 400.  I think 400 is too hot when you are baking.  Only 4 stars because I think the batter would have been too thick w/o the strawberries.

wonderful! The only changes I made, was to use skim milk instead of cream, 1 c of chocolate chunks instead of 1/3 c chips and I sifted the dry ingredients (and I measured the flour post sifting, I think this really helped cut down on the thickness) These came out perfect and very moist! A new favorite! I added a pic!

I made these this morning for a breakfast treat.  I have 2 extra children all week and ww wanted something to make.  They really enjoyed these.  I did follow the advice of some others and doubled the sugar half white and half brown.  I know I used more chips too....but I didn't measure, we just dumped them in.  We made them into mini muffins.  Baked for about 15 minutes....I got 48 tasty little treats.  Thanks Eggy for the recipe!

They were good, but didn't have much flavor; they were a bit bland.  Good for those who don't like sweet foods.

These are great! Taste is perfect. I had to use a little extra milk, i didnt use cream. Made exactly 12. You need to fill up the entire cup, and they are just right. They came out beautiful.

These came out great.  I was a little nervous at first since the dough seemed a bit on the "gummy" side, like it had too much flour, but the end result is almost perfect.  The muffins are light, fluffy and have the right amount of chocolate in them.  I'll make these again.

I made a half batch of these to use up some cream cheese, but did use a whole egg which may be why my batter wasn't as thick as other reviewers have found it to be. I also used milk instead of cream as my cream had spoiled. My daughter and her boyfriend seemed to love them. Thanks Eggy.

I've made this recipe several times now.  First the consistency of the batter is more like cookie dough than muffin batter.   Next, I usually get 24 muffins as opposed to 12.  This decreases the cooking time to 14~15 minutes.  While they aren't as big as the ones in the picture, they still peak over the tops of the muffin cups. Next, I've found that adding the egg to the butter/cream cheese mixture without the cream works best for overall homologous mixture.   Also, 1/3 cup of chocolate chips..ppphhht!  I add a full cup.  I love these, they keep well for an entire week in a loose-fit container.

Four star rating is with the changes recommended in the reviews - extra vanilla, 1/4 c less flour, double the sugar (and I used brown), and a touch more milk (didn't have cream) than called for.  I also used the traditional way of making muffins (alternating dry/wet ingredients) to whip these up.  VERY yummy and tender as ever!  They got gobbled up in no time!

they are very luscious when raw, but turn out a bit spongy in the end and you find yourself chewing and swallowing...I will try with more chocolate morsels too, because 1/3 cup wasn't enough.

Perfect substitute when I am craving Chocolate chip cheesecake. These are best when eaten warm right out of the oven.

I'm the baker of the house, this was my first muffin recipe.  I tried this recipe recently and I added more milk because the batter was to thick, my dad didn't like them. He didn't say that but he only ate one, (he loves sweets! :D) so that they  that was sign that they weren't good.  They were not sweet enough, and just tasted weird and they tasted worse the next day!!!!!  Maybe i did something wrong...

Unfortunately, I am quite disappointed in this recipe.  The batter was very dry, despite adding more milk.  I personally didn't care for the taste, though both my husband and daughter enjoyed it.  I will make again-but only for them.

I thought this recipe was great, and easy to make. I used milk instead of cream, 3/4 cup sugar, and twice the chocolate chips.  They were perfect.

I'm not overwhelmed with the results of this recipe. I had to decrease baking time because the muffins browned unpleasantly after only about half of the baking time was over. They turned out ok, but I'm sure that if I hadn't pulled them out of the oven early they would have been as hard as a rock. Taste-wise they are ok but not exceptionally great, some extra-kick is missing here.

The secret to making these taste like cream cheese is to NOT soften the cream cheese.  That will leave it somewhat chunky and adds to the flavor tremendously!  I also make these with some of the other suggested modifications: 3/4 milk instead of the cream, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 3/4 cups flour (I sometimes use whole wheat, too!), and 3/4 to 1 cup sugar (white or sucanat).  One of my favorite muffins when made this way!

i used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and used milk in place of the cream. i used 1 tsp of vanilla and 3/4 c. of chocolate chips. i also used a deiffernt method for mixing them. i creamed the butter, cream cheese and sugar together. then added the egg & vanilla. then the milk. after that i added the dry ingredients. and folded in the chocolate chips. mine didnt get nice and brown like the picture. but they still tasted pretty good. i got 12 regular sized muffins and 15 mini muffins.

We didn't like these at all, they have a rubbery texture that reminded me of stale eclairs... and taste extremely bland. Will not make again but thank you anyway

Delicious muffins! I tweaked the recipe a bit by adding about a 1/4 cup extra of cream (this was because the dough was incredibly thick when it came to combing the wet and dry ingredients together.) I used a 24 mini muffin pan instead of the standard 12. They came out fine with the cooking time recommended. The only thing i found was that the muffins tasted and had a very similar consistency to a scone. Regardless, they tasted amazing.

These were fantastic. I'm surprised that they got a one-star review from anybody. That review said they were hard; mine came out golden on the outside, fluffy and tender on the inside. The cream cheese gives both moisture and flavor. Since a couple reviewers suggested they were a little bland or not quite sweet enough, I upped the vanilla and sugar...I think I used 3/4 c. sugar and 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla. I think following the recipe as-is would be fine; I just have a personal preference for a sweeter muffin, and I really like vanilla. I did also increase the chocolate chips...I'm not sure by how much, I just stirred some in until it looked right. :) Just watch the bake time depending on your oven...mine were thoroughly golden-brown (even a little darker than I wanted them) at around 18 minutes, so 20 would have probably burned them. Anyway, these were delicious muffins. Thanks for a great recipe.

Wow the thickness of the batter scared me for a moment but I went with it.  Also I think I will use more sugar next time. Found out I guess I do like my muffins alittle sweeter.  All in all they were pretty tasty.

Rated by my 8 year old: I think this is good. 5 STARS!!!!!!!!!!! we were eating this while football was on. we have 3 computers but the Windows XP is the one i use. it's odd that it has cream cheese in it but i like it. you can't really taste the cream cheese.

Three & A Half stars.  Following suggestions, I doubled the sugar (1/2 brown & 1/2 white), 1/4 cup less flour, and 2% milk, and a full teaspoon of vanilla, plus a FULL bag of semi-sweet (reserved some to place on top of muffins before baking)  The half cup of milk was *not* enough, so I added more until the dough texture was where I'd like it to be.  Checked at 18 minutes, weren't quite ready, pulled at 20 and although the tops were nicely golden, the bottoms were too dark for my liking. Only mildly sweet, with the additional sugar...  GREAT texture - light & fluffy. Pretty good flavor, but didn't knock my socks off.  If I make these again, I'll try to jazz 'em up more.

Made exactly as the directions called for.  I think they were a bit too dry and could use more cream cheese or something.  They were okay, but not something I will make over and over.

This recipe calls for WAY too much flour!!  Egads, was this batter thick!!  I had to add more liquid.  And even after all that they only tasted "ok".  The texture is rather weird and I've had tastier recipes.  If I use this recipe again, I will definitely make some changes.  They weren't sweet at all, so if you like your muffin a little "bland" (no offense), then by all means, try this one!

Hmmm... this was only okay.  There were a few problems- My batter became so thick when I added the flour, the mixers couldn't even mix it!  I had to add an extra 1/3 cup of cream!  After fixing that problem, I was skeptical, but put them in the oven.  They have to back for 35 minutes for them to be thoroughly cooked.  After the muffins came out, I tried one.  They were okay.  The cream cheese flavor wasn't too evident.  (But that could have been my fault because I used a package of fat free cream + 2 tbsp. of reduced fat cream cheese)  Overall, maybe worth a try- But this isn't my favorite muffin recipe.

I'm not a very good improviser, so I was a little nervous about needing to deviate from the original recipe in order to make these turn out well.  However, I'm proud to say I did okay and these turned out very yummy!  I reduced the flour by 1/4 cup and used whole milk instead of cream (3/4 cup).  I also added 1/4 cup of brown sugar as some other cooks had suggested.  And finally, I used mini chocolate chips because that is what I happened to have on hand. These muffins looked and tasted great!  The texture is a little more dense than a traditional muffin however they were not hard at all!  This recipe is worth a try.

I thought these were wonderful!!  I added 1/2 c brown sugar (after reading other reviews), I used 1/2 of a 10 oz. bag of white chocolate chips, and I used fat free half and half (which I ended up adding a little more because batter looked thick to me).

They smelled and tasted warm and sweet and wonderful!!

After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to modify this recipe a bit. I increased the sugar to 3/4 cup, used milk chocolate chips, and added 1/3 cup Skor toffee bits (available in the bulk foods section of my local supermarket). I wasn't sure I had a keeper when they first came out of the oven, lumpy and cakey looking. But I found them addictive (loved the cheesy taste, a bit like baked cheesecake) and my kids devoured them and insisted I pack them in their lunchboxes.

I just now finished making this batter and it was so thick that it stopped my mixer from turning. I had to add about 1 1/2 cups of cream to get it to a batter I could work with!

It did not have that "wow" factor at all. I was disappointed. It tasted all right, but if I ever decide to do this again, I will increase the number of chocolate chips!

These were yummy, our new favorite muffin. I didn't have cream so I just used milk and I added 1/2 cup of yogurt because other reviewers said they were dry. Came out perfectly with just the right amount of cream cheese flavor to make them different and delicious!!

These came out good. My family ate them up quickly. I did add half cup of brown sugar and used half cup less the flour too. Thanks for recipe.

They taste like a cookie to me. My husband, who is a critic and tells you exactly what he thinks, even said it was good.

these are delicious! the batter worried me as it was very thick,  but they came out tasting great. you can see in the photos that some peoples muffins came out with a pretty smooth top and some have a rough /edgy top. mine came out rough but they were delicious anyway. I think I will try 1/4c more milk next time like some of the other reviewers suggested.

I used milk instead of cream, and added a little extra as some people suggested. I also cooked until they were golden on top as the recipe said, but that made them over done. It took more than 20 minutes. Was that my oven, or is it the recipe? They tasted good though, and I will be making them again but keeping a closer eye on it.

Really nice the way they came out. Used milk instead of cream. I was really worried about them coming out dry/hard so added more milk till it looked like a sticky slightly thick cake batter. Also added about 1/4 cup brown sugar and more vanilla. First pan made with silicone cups and were perfect with recommended cooking time. Second pan used a metal mini muffin tin and the bottoms started to brown to quickly after only 10 mins. Would have lowered cooking time for those so they could brown better on top. Really happy with result as these came out fluffy and pretty

The batter was VERY dry, causing the need for an addition of milk. The consistency was very dense with a somewhat bland flavor.

Just ok.  I felt like they were missing something.  I added extra chocolate chips and that still didn't do the trick.  Not sure I will make again.

People should only eat this recipe if they want to go on a diet from because it was not sweet. It was so horrible I didn't taste the cream cheese and was was very bland. It tasted like we took white bread and through some chocolate chips on it and served it to my class mates. You should of seen their faces it was not a pleasant taste.

the look of the muffin turned out well for this recipe, it lookand ed like how the professional picture looked. the instructions were very easy to understand. forgot to add salt, making our muffins miss some taste that should of been there. i would add salt and a little more sugar to bring out the flavor. the final product looked very delicious. i would recommend this recipe for another person because it was actually good and fullfilling

The muffin ended up coming out just like the picture on AllRecipes.com. The recipe is clear cut and easy to follow. We forgot to add the Salt, so we are not sure if that had much of an impact. The recipe seemed to not have enough cream cheese, due to the fact we could not taste it. I would recommend this recipe, although they may consider adding more cream cheese to enhance flavor.

This recipe turned out very well, it was easy to follow, but one thing that should of been altered was the amount of sugar that the recipe requires as the muffins kind of turn out a little bland. Other than that I would have made no changes of how I followed the recipe only except I WOULD throw in a little more sugar but overall, the muffins turned out very nice and tasty looking and I would recommend this recipe to any one who loves chocolate and muffins put together :)

These were very good. Had some cream cheese I was trying to use up and I came across this recipe. Only thing I did differently was that I used mini chocolate chips and they worked great. The cream cheese gives these such a nice and rich flavor and texture. Not overly sweet. Since I like my muffins on the sweeter side I might use a bit more sugar next time. So good warm out of the oven!

Wow this came out good. The cream cheese and cream made the muffins so...soft and creamy! When I started blending in the cream, I was worried that it wouldn't turn out right because I didn't have a mixer...but I carried on with the instructions and it came out perfectly. For a batch of 12, it took 17 minutes to bake.

Thank you, Eggy, for posting this recipe!  My family and I enjoyed them very much.  I did add orange flavoring rather than vanilla, and made mini muffins (which only needed 10 minutes to bake).

Loved these!  Doubled the sugar as someone else suggested because we have sweet teeth here :) and skipped the choc chips as a personal preference.  They were delicious.  Moist and light with a nice cream cheese flavor.  Next time I might even throw in some fresh raspberries or blueberries in place of the choc chips.

So disappointing.  Followed recipe exactly.  Batter was entirely too thick.  Set timer for 18 minutes.  They were too brown on bottom. Cooked second pan for 12 minutes, and they were better.  My oven is usually right on track.  Very bland, only saving grace was the chocolate.  Will not try again - even with changes.

These were really yummy.  

We did tweak a little-thanks to other reviews.  1/2 C brown sugar, 2 T extra cream, and we used milk chocolate chips(all we had but it seemed to help sweeten it).  It made about 24 mini muffins and they were gone in a flash.  My kids love cream cheese and I could definately taste it in the recipe.  The batter was still pretty thick.  

We took them out of the oven just as we saw a little brown.  I think these could easily overcook.

I doubled this recipe since muffins traditionally don't last very long around here. I was a little surprised about the texture while mixing everything together.  That's a lot of flour! Once I combined everything, I had to kneed it like bread dough with my hands. I was expecting to end up with muffins that could substitute for a door knob. Surprisingly, however, the cream cheese and cream create a great texture. They are good! I think the cream cheese taste is in there but subtle. The only change I made to the recipe was that I used Hershey's chocolate cream. I think I'll reduce the amount of flour next time tho and see what happens.

Great muffins, BUT, they need more sugar!  I halved the recipe to use up some cream cheese I had and I used the full amount of sugar like another reviewer.  Glad I listened to her because it wasn't very sweet to me even with this modification.  I will be making these again and probably adding in another 1/4 c.  Thanks!

I made a half batch of these to use some left over cream cheese I had on hand.  After reading other reviews, I kept the sugar at 1/2 cup instead of halving that.  They could have used even a little more!  I guess I like my muffings a little sweeter?  I used 1/4 C brown sugar and 1/4 granulated sugar.  I also increased the milk a little and decreased the flour a bit.  The batter was still incredibly think, but baked up nicely.

This recipe was good- it disappeared quite fast when we made them. Unfortunatly, i was hoping it would have more of a cream cheese taste- at least taste somewhat like cheesecake. To me, they just taste like chocolate chip muffins- but very very good muffins. For the misleading title, I am forced to give it only four stars :-(

This recipe tasted good but i had to add another 1/2 cup of milk just to make the dough not so think. i also used 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of peanut butter chips in this recipe which gave them more flavour. i used the suggestions from some of the other people and added 1/4 cup more sugar and they tasted very good but had a slightly weird texture, kind of rubbery.

I tend to like a heavier muffin, and these were a bit light for my taste.  The flavor was only alright as well.  People ate them, but not all of them.

My husband didn't want chocolate in his muffins again so I put lemon juice and a little lemon pulp in in place of the chocolate chips.  I baked them the same amount of time and added a lemon juice powdered sugar frosting to the top after baking.  They are wonderful!

i must be one of the few who only thought these were just "ok." i think it was the texture i disliked, but the rest of the family liked them.
