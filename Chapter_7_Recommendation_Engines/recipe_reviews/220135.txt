What a delicious and creative wrap.  I love the recipe for the raspberry dressing and I just happen to have it from the store in a spray bottle.  It is great for this recipe and I recommend adding walnuts, almonds or pecans to this wrap.  Cooking the tortillas is essential to the flavor of this wrap and it makes the wrap more pliable.
