This is a version of boeuf bourguignon except with canned tomato soup. The flavors were nice a little sweet I would omit the sugar next time because of the natural sweetness from using condensed tomato soup. Instead of cooking this in the stove for 2.5 hours I placed it in a slow cooker for 4 hours.I added salt to taste at the end.

The first time I made this I was looking for a recipe for stew meat. I followed the directions except i used about 3/4 cup cabernet savignon instead of sherry. I served it over egg noodles and it was DELICIOUS. The second and third time I made it instead of using beef stew meat I used a venison roast I had cut into cubes that had been sitting in milk for a few days. OMG! It was soooo DELICIOUS you couldn't even tell that it was made with venison. It was a good way to use the venison roasts I had in my freezer. Plan on making it again tonight. But I do recommend using 3/4 cup of a good cabernet savignon instead of the sherry. The wine gives the gravy a nice deep flavor and using 3/4 cup increases the amount of gravy to pour over the noodles. Great recipe!

This was yummy. I added a bit of Worcestershire sauce and left out the thyme. I was busy and instead of flouring and braising the meat, I put everything in the slow cooker. Cooked on high for about an hour, and then on low for about four hours. The meat was very tender. I thickened the "gravy" before serving by slowly stirring in a couple of tablespoons flour mixed with cold water into the slow cooker until it was a good consistency. I served it over mashed potatoes because a family member wouldn't be home until later and that seemed easier to reheat. Will make again.

Very good... It was a little sweet but delicious none the less. I will definitely make this easy dish again! I served over mashed potatoes instead of noodles though.
