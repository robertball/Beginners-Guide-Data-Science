over all alright.. the creps are fine but the recipe it self is flawed.. For best Chocolaate Whipped cream, melt chocolate squares in a double boiler or metal bowl set in a pan of boiling water once the chocolate is melted turn off the heat but leave in the water start to add the whipping cream a little at a time whipping as you go... once it all added you can transfer to a mixer if you wish or finish by hand.

The chocolate whipping cream should be made with cocoa powder instead of melted chocolate.  Nutella with cherries and plain whipped cream is what I might try next time.

when I tried this the crepes were great, but the filling totally flopped. I did let the chocolate cool but as soon as I put it in the whipping cream it hardened and made a gritty mess instead of a nice smooth cream. Should I hae brought the cream to room temperature first before trying to mix them?
