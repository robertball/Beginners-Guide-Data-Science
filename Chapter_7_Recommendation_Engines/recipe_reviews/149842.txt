I took other reviewer's suggestions and upped the tea bags to six. Other than that, I made no other changes. I made this early this morning and let it set until lunch--there's not more than one cup left. We love this tea!

Gentle pineapple flavored tea - light, refreshing, sweet enough but not *sickening* sweet. But the pineapple flavor definitely dominates.  This would be better kicking up the tea to probably six bags.  I used a half cup of Splenda rather than the simple syrup, only to avoid the sugar.

This splendid beverage is a refreshing change from plain iced tea.  I added simple syrup to taste, probably about 1/4 cup, and found that I was refilling the pitcher often as my guests went back again and again for refills.

I tweaked this a little and it was great!  I brewed the tea in boiling hot water for about 10 mins and added 1/2 cup a sugar to dissolve (instead of the simple syrup).  then I added the pineapple juice and enough cold water to get it to the strength I liked.  it was yummy and everyone loved that it was pineapple instead of your typical lemon iced tea.  I'm going to make this will all my favourite juices.  yum!

Great - thanks for the main recipe, very helpful! 
But we used brown cane sugar instead of common sugar or syrup, and added almond slivers, small coco pieces and 3 rose blossoms - now its genious!

This drink we will need while sailing to and around Antarctic Peninsula on our next expedition, besides regular Magarithas and Caipirinhas and ron, of course...smile

Light and refreshing!  I balanced the juice/tea ratio to my liking, as should you. Will definitely make again!

Hmm.. I trippled the recipe for a huge party and made it using the "sun tea" brewing method (i.e. not using the direct-boil method). This amounted a much weaker tea than expected. Sad. Looked promising but I will try a more flexible recipe.

I wasn't that excited about this. It tasted like those bottled Lipton flavored teas. At least I know how much real fruit juice is in it, when they make that claim. I used a regular Lipton tea bag. I changed the recipe to 1 serving and it made 2 1 cup glasses. I added everything but the pineapple garnish. It needed a little sweetness so I added 1/2 packet of Splenda to my glass. I guess, in the future I can add 2 Tblsp. of fruit juice to a glass a tea if I want a hint of that flavor.

I loved this tea! I had to make lots of tea for a dinner for 50, so I cheated and used instant (gasp!) tea but it was loved by all at the dinner. Will try it with steeped tea next time.

I liked this, I am not a big tea fan but this added a little sweetness that I enjoyed without adding sugar. I did not add the simple syrup. Thanks for the post.

It was good but I'm not wild about it, just not my taste I guess.  I added some cranberry juice to the mix and liked that much better, helped cut some of the sweetness of the pineapple juice.

Something I won't try again.. I made a whole batch for my family, but it didn't really hit it. It just tasted watered down.. so I tried adding more pineapple juice, even some sugar, but the taste stayed just somehow off. I guess, it just wasn't the drink for us!
