I liked the use of 3 cheeses on these pizzas. We've made tortilla pizzas before, and I find it best to put the tortillas in the oven for about 4 minutes first, and then put the sauce and toppings on. I took Christina's suggestion and put the sauce down first and then the cheese. I used pepperoni on my son's pizza and left out the red pepper flakes. I liked the salami and red pepper flakes on mine. I baked for about 5 minutes after putting the toppings on.

Very good! Next time I will put the cheese on top of the sauce instead of mixing it in, just because. The family always enjoys tortilla pizza, so I knew this would go over well. Thanks for sharing. :)
