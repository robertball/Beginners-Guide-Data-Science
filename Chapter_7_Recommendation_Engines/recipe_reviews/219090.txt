OH BOY!  This is REAL Chicken Gravy!   Don't be afraid to cook your roux - if needs to be cooked slowly to a blonde stage - like Chef John says it will smell like pie crust.   Good chicken stock makes a huge difference with this gravy.  I did add a pinch of cayenne pepper to the roux along with some white pepper.  Then proceeded as directed....taste tasted and added a bit more.  Will I make again?  You bet!

Just ok.  I dont know if the cream was a good addition.  It was looking beautiful (color and texture) before i added the cream.  It lost the "look" of what i consider chicken gravy.  Easy recipe for the novice though

This recipe was delicious. I used half and half instead of heavy cream because I didn't have any.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I've never bought gravy mixes and have always tried my hand at homemade gravies, but they've never come out this good.  I've always used oil and never butter and I think that, that makes all the difference.

I didn't use cream, as I did not have it and the gravy was just as good.  I did add a little bit of whole milk though.  I will definitely use this time and time again.  I know it was good because my husband enjoyed it and he is picky, picky, picky!!  Thanks!!

Excellent easy recipe.  I didn't have the cream, added just a touch of milk and a little bit (about a teaspoon) of cornstarch.  I also added a few dried parsley flakes and a tiny bit of sage.  Just mainly for color and because I was serving it with a sage stuffing.   Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a good, basic, well-written recipe for gravy that will appeal to all those who either have never made gravy or who aren’t confident preparing it.  I used the drippings from a roasted turkey breast plus enough boxed chicken stock to make up the difference. The cream was a nice addition, something I don’t generally use.  I didn’t care for the light color of the gravy, however, particularly since I was using it for sliced roast turkey, but a little dribble of Kitchen Bouquet fixed that right up.

Mmm, amazing! So good with our roast chicken and mashed potatoes. My gravy wasn't getting thick at a simmer so I increased the heat and brought it to a low boil whisking constantly (this is how my mom does it) until it was thick to my liking, then turned off the heat and added the cream, s/p and cayenne. Thanks so much for the recipe:)

This is similar to the old Fanny Farmer chicken pot pie gravy recipe.  I add a touch of poultry seasoning to mine and a dash of nutmeg.  I then pour it over roughly cubed chicken, drained can of LeSeur peas, carmelized onion pieces and well-cooked sliced carrots.  A topping of Bisquick biscuits finishes it off, with a sprinkling of grated parmesan cheese over the biscuits.  There usually aren't any leftovers!

Made this gravy tonight.  The texture is very nice and it has a nice shine to it.  However, both my husband and I thought it was somewhat bland and maybe even a little "flour-y" tasting.  There was something missing.  It needs some zing.  Like maybe drippings from the chicken roasting pan??  Does anyone have an answer.  It looks like we are the only ones complaining about this.  Thanks much.

Disaster. Over an hour and still runny. Kept trying my luck and nothing half an hour later. Added flour and cornstarch a little at a time until I had quadrupled the original specifications of the recipe and it was still runny and tasted awful. Continued on until it thickened (with the addition of yet more flour) and by the time it set up it tasted like dough.

Perfect gravy! Super easy to make and no lumps. I added some dried thyme to the roux and a couple drops of Worcestershire sauce at the end (a tip from one of Chef John's other recipes). Make sure you sample as you go and add salt if it's tasting too "chicken broth-y."

This was great! Very good for a base recipe, but I had to add some extra spices for more flavor. I added cooked, cubed chicken breast and served over mashed potatoes, with homemade biscuits on the side. Came out wonderful, and the whole family LOVED this gravy. Definitely saving this one (:

I made this 2 times already this week. First with leftover chicken from a roast, I used chicken broth instead of drippings & cut the recipe in half. We all loved it & honestly I was never a gravy fan. Today I roasted a 4lb. pork shoulder. I coated the roast with a  can of cream of mushroom soup. When cooking was complete the juices measured 2 cups, then Iadded 2 cups of water. I took the advise & cooked the roux for the 12 minutes. OMG, I normally would have eaten the pork plain, it was juicy & so tasty but I ate each bite dipped in Chef John's gravy! Yummy

This was my very first attempt at making gravy from scratch and this recipe is delicious and so easy.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  I will never buy gravy packets again.

Chicken Gravy 101 to me!! I think this dish has a lot of potential, Before attempting this again, I'll have to figure out what seasonings to use, by reading all of the review, and see that will work for others, and than for me, to make it more flavorful or lot better for me to do! Anyway, excellent to do a SCRATCH on recipes. The more I play with my food, the more I love cooking, to make a recipe that will work for me, that is!! Than I can do the happy food dance!! I've will added this to my recipe book with my additions. THANK YOU!! It O.K. with potential........

I use this simple recipe as the replacement in any recipe that calls for "cream of" canned soup as a "gravy."  (I do NOT use it IN recipes as a replacement...it is not the right consistency for that.  I use it just in the recipes that call for thinned soup as a gravy or sauce to an already cooked dish). It is easy and quick to prepare, light, and a wonderful alternative to the processed condensed soups.

I made this last night.  I did not however use the heavy cream in it.  I did add some spices for flavor, but overall it was great.  This has to be the prettiest gravy I've ever made.  No lumps, very smooth texture.   Loved the butter flavor.

Chef John is correct;  You will never go back to the store-bought stuff again.  Not even for simplicity or convenience as this is JUST as easy  and quick, but the flavor is awesome.  I do recommend using organic chicken broth - is have a much better flavor.

Simple and delicious!  I omitted the cream due to food allergies and used homemade stock.  I only cooked the roux about 5 minutes.  I will use this again!   Everyone loved it!

This is good stuff. I did use 1/2 n 1/2 and corn starch, instead of cream and flour. Very smooth with great consistency and flavor.

Wow, this may have been the best gravy I have ever made.  We loved it.  I just made two servings of this for Hubs and me.  The changes I made were to add the white pepper and cayenne with the flour, and I omitted the heavy cream because I thought it tasted great without it.  This took a lot longer than any gravy I’ve ever made, but maybe it was worth it.

I htought this was an amazingly bland recipe.  The kick of cayenne is the only supporting feature of this recipe.

Very smooth texture, but very bland. It tasted like flour. I can't imagine anyone enjoying the flavor of this gravy, yet apparently they do.

This is a great recipe.  Browning the butter and letting it simmer in the flour gives it such a great flavor.  It's so simple and easy and uses ingredients I usually have on hand.  I've even used beef broth to make gravy for beef patties.  I've used cream, 1/2 & 1/2 and milk.  Each time it comes out great.

My family LOVES gravy and this gave me a new one to add to the mix. I didn't change a thing and followed the video exactly. Came out perfect and my gravy loving guys all gave it two thumbs way up. Thanks for the great recipe Chef John.

This is delicious! I really like that you told us how many minutes to cook this at different steps or stages. The times were right on point. I cooked the butter and flour at a low heat, or really slow boil, so nothing burned, and stirred it often. My butter and flour mixture was a pretty golden color in about 10 minutes, and then I added the cold chicken stock. I cooked this another 15 minutes, like you said enough to coat the back of a spoon. I was afraid to add the heavy cream at the end, but boy did it make the flavor pop! It is definitely worth it. Thank you so much for the great recipe and instructions!

Easy peasy. I used beef broth instead of chicken broth to go on chicken fried steak, used milk instead of cream, and added some onion flakes. Did the trick!

I was a bit concerned about adding the cream at the end, but I did since it was part of the recipe.  Glad I did!!  Made for an added richness that was lovely.  Do not be afraid to cook the roux as directed, it makes all the difference in the world! 
Thanks for another great recipe, Chef John - you always come through!

I have never made my own gravy before, but since gravy is one of the reasons I get up every day, I figured I ought to try it. ;)
This was phenomenal. I eliminated the cream, but otherwise followed the posted recipe. My roux did not cook for quite as long as called for, but no big deal. My gravy was a little bit light in color. It still tasted rich and chickeny and perfect. WILL be making this often!

I used a nice rich homemade chicken stock, all ingredients and instructions filled exactly...but I wish I had never used the cream, made it milky and diluted, whereas before I added it, it was perfect. My advise, follow everything,use rich homemade stock, and totally skip the cream. I should then be PERFECT!

This gravy is excellent!  I substituted salted butter, whole milk and left out the cayenne pepper.  My (boxed) stock wasn't cold, so while I was making the roux I let the stock cool in the freezer.  My family loved it.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was easy and tasty, although I thought it needed a little something to boost the savoriness.  I added just a dash of tamari (less salty, thicker, gluten-free soy sauce) and that did the trick.  Also didn't have cayenne on hand so I threw in a touch of paprika.   I also omitted the heavy cream. This made a LOT of gravy!

I had to use great value brand salted sweet cream butter stick and it turned out really good. I also didn't salt it any extra or put any cayanne in it. I don't think I cooked the flour and butter enough because it still turned out pretty light. Good still but probably would have been better if I was more patient with it.

I can't explain why my attempt ran contrary to most reviews. I used a high quality chicken stock and followed the instructions. It had an odd flavor that didn't have a hint of chicken. I added more stock in hopes of boosting it, but it didn't help.

This is an amazing base. I only gave it 4 stars because I made some modifications. I seasoned the roux before adding stock. I eyeballed white pepper, black pepper, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, a pinch if cayenne, and some dried parsley. Then added 4 cups of stock and no cream. It turned out great! I will keep this recipe at my fingertips. Delicious!

I was a bit worried since while I was making this recipe the sauce seemed super runny. But after 15 minutes of cooking the sauce started to thicken up. It tastes delicious too. Thanks Chef John :)

I followed this recipe exactly as written. I paired it with biscuits. It was so easy to make. I love the fact that most of these ingredients can be found in my fridge quite often. I would make this recipe again and again for sure! Thank you!

Made the broth out of rotisserie chicken carcass which I will admit could have been more chickeny.  Made it per recipe but thought it could've been brighter flavored. A little wine and thyme did the trick.

I found the video to be VERY helpful!  I made one change and that was to use Wondra instead of regular flour.  My roux didn't look like Chef John's with the Wondra flour so I cooked it a "little bit" longer.  I think that changed the flavor of the gravy.   I will try it again with regular flour and update my rating.  The rest of my family liked it but I thought it tasted off.

Bowl of gravy? Yes please!  This gravy is so incredible, I literally ate a few bites from a spoon while cleaning up after dinner.  I didn’t even cook the roux or finished gravy nearly as long as called for. This is a great “dump” recipe—just add the ingredients in approximate quantities and adjust for thickness.

I made this last night as the recipe states and it was very bland.
I had to add poultry seasoning, more salt, more pepper, and Better than Bouillon chicken seasoning to provide any real chicken taste.

This is why I use packet chicken gravy if I didn't bake a chicken myself.  Sorry John.

I kept cooking and stirring and it never thickened.  I could also taste the flour.  I added a package of chicken gravy mix to salvage.  I will not be making this again.

Excellent little gravy recipe! I normally take a shortcut with cornstarch and had forgotten how to use flour. This turned out perfectly creamy and delicious. I had no heavy cream in the house, so I melted a similar amount of cream cheese in the microwave and it came out all the same. Definitely will be relying on this method in the future! Much better and not too much more of a hassle than using cornstarch.

Even after cooking the flour until it was fragrant and deep brown, and following the rest of the recipe exactly up until the point of adding cream, this gravy just tasted like straight butter. I tried to add some browned onions and drippings from our roasted chicken and some poultry seasoning and sage to salvage, but it was not great. I did not add the cream since thought that it would only make things worse. Wouldn’t make again.

Didn't have enough chicken broth so added a little vegetable broth. Didn't have any heavy cream either so used 0% milk. Really, we loved it.

This recipe is a keeper! Pretty good for not having chicken drippings that I would normally use. It’s a bit creamier than a regular gravy but very tastey. Had it on mashed potatoes & everyone loved it.

Followed the directions to a T. Season to taste.  If you have a floury or pasty tasting gravy, you didn’t cook your roux long enough.

Best gravy I've ever made! Thank you!
I didn't have chicken broth so used vegetable.  Can't wait to use chicken.  Also I used light cream.
Loved the touch of cayenne.
Gravy is so comforting!

This was delicious, I did two shakes of cayenne pepper for a little extra heat.  The directions were easy to follow, I will be making chicken gravy this way from now on.

I didn't care for this gravy.  To me - the taste was like flour.  My daughter liked it.  I will not be making it again.
I did the whisking of flour and butter and it seemed like it wasn't doing anything... so I turned the heat up a little and then it smelled burnt - and I threw out that batch... so I started over and then my husband took of doing the whisking.... and he thought that it looked good and it coated the back of the spoon... but the flavor just was not there...

I skipped the cream and added a little onion powder. It was quite nice, comforting, pleasant. Will certainly make it again as a basis for some comfort food.

Made this tonight to top mashed potatoes and fried chicken. I halved the recipe and subbed chicken bullion/water for stock and half and half for cream(didn't have stock or cream on hand). My roux became fragrant after about 5 minutes, but I attribute that to cooking on a gas stovetop. Really a great chicken gravy!

I was looking for a quick & simple recipe to make for lunch (my daughter loves mashed potatoes & we were out of gravy). I used vegetable stock instead of chicken w/no problems. I did forget to let it thicken before adding the cream, but I let it simmer until it got to the right consistency w/out having to add anything extra. Just a little bit of patience.

This gravy turned out amazing. I cooked it a little longer than suggested during the first phase because it wasn't thickening up but it turned out great. My son who refuses to eat potatoes and gravy had seconds. This is a keeper.

I had a hard time getting this gravy to thicken up. It was not only too runny, it lacked flavor. The only way I would make this again would be to modify the recipe significantly.

NOT homemade if using a can of chicken stock (or broth)! Also, try adding a pinch (for 1 qt) or so (depending on amount being made WITH REAL CHICKEN STOCK) of standard poultry seasonings--sage, thyme, marjoram--and if desired, rosemary and/or nutmeg--instead of overused cayenne pepper. I would recommend 1/2 cup flour/corn starch blend--2:1 flour to corn starch, or approximately 1/3 cup flour plus 3 tbsp corn starch. I'd also suggest cutting heavy cream to 1/4 cup (or 1/3 cup whole milk, if substituting). Use fresh ground black pepper (not white) or a peppercorn blend to include black pepper. The aroma will permeate the home, entice the olfactory senses as it simmers, and will bring diners to the kitchen before the meal is ready.

Otherwise, the premises here are ok, especially that of using a roux instead of a slurry; I just dislike misnomers like "homemade." For a quick, packaged/processed fix, this recipe is just ok.

Delicious!  My only criticism is it takes a lot longer to bring to a simmer than stated.  I would allow at least 20-25 minutes.  I ended up turning the heat way up after fully incorporating the stock to speed up the process .  Then once it started to simmer, turned it way down again.

I used this recipe as a guide on how to make a basic chicken gravy with broth and Putnam it over mashed potatoes. I made a few changes, however. First, I took a boneless skinless chicken breast and added salt pepper, lemon juice, garlic powder, paprika, rhyme, cayenne and dill, put it in a cake pan with a little bit of water to keep it moist, and baked it at 400 degrees for 30 min. When it  comes poked I shredded the chicken and to the gravy I added garlic powder, a little more cayenne than recommended (I thought I accidentally added too much and ruined it but it still turned out really good and not too spicy -- had a little kick but it really wasn't spicy), I added pepper and the shredded chicken and it was the best gravy I've ever made fr and tasted! I'd recommend this recipe to everyone and I'll definitely be using this recipe again

I haven't bought can gravy since finding this recipe. It's just what I needed, a simple recipe that I can adjust to our taste. The key, like another reviewer wrote, is to really simmer the butter/flour mixture until fragrant.  I add a little onion and garlic to the butter. I skip the cream because it's so good without it, why add the calories?!

Made exactly as written, added homemade poultry seasoning, a little basil, garlic, onion powder and paprika. I only had chicken broth but this would be even better with a good stock. I served it over a rotisserie chicken and rice with peas on the side. Very delicious! For those complaining about it tasting too much like flour, cook the butter and flour longer, before adding the stock, that will cook the flour. Also, don't be afraid to use your favorite seasonings. If it's not thick enough, cook it low and slow for a longer time and slowly stir continuously until it comes to a full boil, then let simmer while continuing to stir. It should thicken up but it won't be super thick, it will just coat the back of a spoon. Be sure to stir the sides of the pan as well as the bottom. So yummy!!

Delicious! I used half and half instead of heavy cream because that was all I had. The color is very pale. It would be more attractive with a darker color, but I don't know how to achieve that.

First time making this gravy from scratch. I opted out on the 4 cups of chicken stock and settled for 2 1/4 cups, we're a family of 4 so more would've been too much with our young boys. I also omitted the cream, I found it wasn't needed and other reviewers claimed they didn't like it when it was added. All in all a great and easy gravy! Look forward to making again.

Pretty much followed the recipe as given. Browned the flour first to give the gravy a little more color. Turned out very good. I received many compliments on the end result.  I chose this recipe since I didn't have any pan drippings from the chicken to use.

This is a very good base recipe, and as CF says, you can dress it up with flavorings that you like. Here is what I did, and the result was so delicious, and best of all, I made it two days before Thanksgiving, then just reheated on medium heat for about 30 minutes, stirring often, then let it sit on low until dinner, about 30 more.  

So in a nutshell, start reheating about one hour before dinnertime.  Watch the video for technique. It is so easy. And I used an ordinary carton of Campbell chicken broth, regular salt, so definitely do NOT add any salt at all to the sauce.

After stirring in the broth and bringing that to a boil, I cooked gently for about 10 minutes. That gets the flour taste out. After that I stirred in 1/4 cup marsala wine, 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning and 1/4 white pepper. Cook that for about 2 minutes then stir in the cream and do not boil again. Let it cool to room temp, then keep in fridge. Reheat per instructions above. Don't boil it when you reheat, as the cream could then separate. I had no issues. The gravy is good. 

You can double everything, which I do if I am cooking for more than 8.  This is so, so easy, and I would not dream of making this right before Thanksgiving dinner, with the stress of using turkey drippings, etc. Not for me. Make this a few days ahead and enjoy a stress-free T-giving dinner.

This is a nice gravy base, but I agree with other reviewers that felt it was bland tasting. I ended up adding some chicken bouillon to taste,  and it was perfect.

I've made this recipe a few times now with and without the heavy cream. I prefer it without the heavy cream, since in my opinion, you get more of a chicken flavor leaving it out. It's really delicious homemade chicken gravy as is, but sometimes I add a few chopped herbs as well to change the flavor around.

Made this for chicken tenders and mashed potatoes. Doctored it up some with thyme, basil, and a flavored salt. Thick and tasty. Will keep this as a favorite!

I liked it!  The next time I make it I will be sure to brown my butter so that it has a little more color.  I was a little cautious since this was my first homemade gravy.  My brother liked it and that made me happy.

Made it for dinner chicken & biscuits. Did not have heavy cream, so I added 2% milk & tsp of corn starch. I usually  just use flavorgod seasoning  (garlic lover & everything  spicy &pink Himalayan ) DELICIOUS!

This was really good. I think I've always undercooked the roux and this time I did everything slowly and methodically.  Finally get the "fragrant stage".  I'll will be making this ahead for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner. Easy and delicious if you follow directions!!

The addition of cream, half & half or milk is not necessary in this recipe.  It will probably remind you more of chicken without the dairy.  I wouldn't bother adding it and I think Chef John didn't really mean it was necessary if you watched the video.

This is a pretty decent gravy recipe but it wasn't exactly what I was looking for. The flavor isn't a strong chicken gravy flavor. Its subtle and somewhat bland, on its own. I've never added heavy cream to a gravy before and I'm not sure I like that flavor. You could definitely tell it had a hint of cream. However, the consistency was excellent and when I added it to cooked chicken, mashed potatoes, and corn, it was a very good meal.

Used whole wheat flour and added cooked, shredded chicken.  I also used ham stock (since it was what I had) and added some chicken bullion. It was delicious!

This is fabulous! I can't believe that *I* just made this gravy!! Versatile enough to add in whatever flavors you like...I added a bit of poultry seasoning, salt, black pepper, & onion powder. I loved it before adding the cream but the cream definitely adds a richness. I'm glad I included it!

Really good, light flavor. I put some onion in my roux, and some bacon drippings in my homemade stock. I mixed it with some cut up chicken and served it over mashed potatoes. Would be great with rice, noodles or biscuits. Will be making this again.

This is the best gravy I've ever made. I used boxed stock and added some chicken bouillon granules to enhance the flavor even more. I also added a pinch of poultry seasoning. Very velvety texture with no lumps! Thank you so much, Chef John!

I've been a lacto/ovo vegetarian for 30 years, but lately for some reason I've been having a terrible craving for chicken gravy over biscuits like my grandmother used to make when I was a child. I sometimes make chicken meals for my meat eating family and have never been tempted to eat it. I normally make a version of whatever I'm making for them using vegetable broth instead of chicken, but today I made this and loved every bite of it! I doubled the recipe, using homemade chicken broth (a whole Amish chicken poached with onion, celery, carrot and bay leaf). I cooked it exactly as Chef John advised until it smelled like baked pie crust, about 8 minutes over low heat. I added my broth hot since I had just made it, making sure to whisk vigorously as I added it. It was lump free. I did not add cream or milk since it was so good without it. At the end I added sea salt, freshly ground pepper, and onion powder. I added cut up chicken to half of it and served it over buttermilk baking powder biscuits and my family loved it. I had no desire to eat the chicken but I have to admit that I loved the gravy sans chicken and will use this method to make turkey gravy this Thanksgiving. Thank you, Chef John, I can't believe I ate anything with chicken juices in it but it was worth it, just like I remember my grandma's.

I made this with my own chicken stock and no cream. It was terrific.  It was a bit runny with all of the suggested liquid so I simmered it back to a thickness I liked.  Poured over chicken and veg and biscuits. Would definitely make it again. I might saute some onions in the butter to start though.  Very well explained for a rookie like me. Thanks!

How do I say yummy with my mouth full.  This is an easy recipe that works.  My husband has a lactose problem so I switched the butter and milk for less offensive ingredients.  Then I made the gravy and added my own little touch.  I will make this again, thanks chef!!!
