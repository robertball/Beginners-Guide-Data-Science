These are pretty tasty and were well received.  I made 3 appetizers though and the others were all eaten but there were left overs of this one.  Most people commented on how good they were.  If I make them again, I'll broil them before topping with the green onions.

The are amazing, I made them for christmas eve as we always have small dishes that day, everyone loved them and I have since made them for many parties and showers.  I couldn't find the cream cheese called for in the recipe so I bought the one with onion in it.
