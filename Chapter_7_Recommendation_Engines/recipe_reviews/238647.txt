Delicious! I drink protein smoothies several times per week and am always looking for new ideas. I had all the ingredients on hand, and this one sounded really good - and it was!  Of course the calorie count will depend on what whey protein you use (they vary greatly) and also your yogurt and almond milk choices.  I used Optimum Nutrition French Vanilla Creme whey, Dannon Light & Fit vanilla greek non-fat yogurt, and Blue Diamond original sweetened almond/coconut blend.  The calories came out to only 290 per serving, and the serving size is VERY generous (I got to fill up my glass twice - YAY!).  It is plenty filling and perfect as a quick breakfast or after-workout snack.  Thank you Lela, I'll be making this again and again!

What a guilt free mid afternoon pick me up!  I have shied away from protein powder because my DS uses it in nasty looking and smelling potions, but it is fine this way.  Thanks, Lela!

I was just looking to make a mango smoothie without the protein, so I took out the protein powder and the smoothie still taste great!

Wonderful smoothie! My mango was very ripe so I thought this would turn out very sweet but it didn't. Needed to add a few tsps of the optional honey for my taste. I had to go with what I had on hand so I used plain Greek yogurt (adding a small amount of vanilla extract), and vanilla soy milk in place of the almond milk. I don't like to change out ingredients like that, but sometimes you have no choice if you really want to make it. The texture was excellent, and I didn't miss the usual banana. All-around great smoothie, Lela!

I was looking for a yummy protein smoothie for my growing son to send him off to school with a healthy addition to his breakfast.  Now the whole family drinks it!  We love it!  I was out of mangoes, so I also have used bananas.  Delicious!

I used coconut cream and milk instead of yogurt and almond milk, and used vanilla extract instead of protein powder.  It was pretty good, and made a tasty, filling breakfast, although, even when I added more mango, It lacked some flavor.
