I'm disappointed in myself for even picking this recipe out.  I should've known better.  The color and texture was off.  The flavor was far from mexican. The tomatoes soup part really threw things off.  It was also an extremely unhealth dish.  I have learned a huge lesson here...

This is a good base recipe that I played with an made my own. For more flavor, I used my own slow cooked mexican-style pork and my own enchilada sauce. I think the tomato soup was just.....not right for us. I should have went with my gut and used all enchilada sauce.

Best enchiladas I have ever made! I too added onions and since I had a little more than 2cups of pork I added the entire can of enchilada sauce 19oz. To me it made it even better. A total hit!

I would have rated this a five if I hadn't changed it because I had to be creative with what I had on hand. I used meat from leftover chicken and pork barbecue, fresh diced onions and minced garlic, substituted the green chiles and condensed soup with a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles and added a tablespoon of taco seasoning in place of the cumin. I didn't have tortillas but I did have Flatout brand spinach flat bread and it was delish!

I followed some suggestions and used enchilada sauce in place of the tomato soup and it was excellent. a great way to use up leftover pork roast and make it seem like an entirely different meal.

I didn't even know I liked enchiladas until I made this with left over BBQ pulled pork.  It was wonderful!  I added some onions, but followed everything else and it was great!  Can't wait to have again tomorrow!

Skipped the tomato soup completely; used all enchilada sauce instead.  Doubled all the spices.  Used jalapenos instead of green chilis.  Served it with hot salsa on top.  Worth trying again.  I haven't ever made enchiladas before, so this was a learning experience.  Good, although I don't have much to compare it to yet.

Used pepper jack cheese instead of chilies and Colby-Monterey jack cheese which turned out to be quite hot so added Cheddar on the top to cool it down and a bit more tomato soup and sour cream (1 full 16 oz tub) and 1 1/2 cans of tomato soup. It was a bit much but it at least covered for 4 servings. Served with Spanish rice.

This was easy and very good.  I liked the tomato soup - it added a sweet flavor.  I only put chiles in a few of the tortillas and marked them with a toothpick due to varied tastes in our home.

These were okay, I omitted tomato soup and used only enchilada sauce, added more meat and some other spices to jazz it up a bit. My family liked these so I would make them again with my additions.

These were tastey!  I would add some rice into the mixture next time just to make them more hearty.  Otherwise, great flavor!

It sounded good, and the reviews were generally positive, so I made a batch following the recipe exactly as instructed. The enchiladas were pretty good, except for the tomato soup taste.  Although a time-saver, I almost didn't use this recipe, because I usually don't really care for recipes which use canned soup as a main flavor ingredient. The enchiladas had a sweet taste which seemed out of place for this type of dish, and produced almost instant indigestion because of the soup used in the recipe. The directions were clear and produced a good looking dish, but I think that I'll continue looking for a recipe that makes a more authentic enchilada dish.

Great recipe for leftover pork I had cooked in the crockpot. Used enchilada sauce instead of soup as others mentioned. Made with whole wheat flour tortillas. A saver recipe!

I didn't have leftover portk. I used a pork tenderloin which I cooked in the  morning in a slow cooker. Perfect consistancy. I made a double batch of enchiladas. one batch I used green enchiladas sauce on top instead of the tomato soup mixture. I liked that much better. I would omit the tomato soup mixture all together. It made the bottom of the enchiladas too mushy. and use Green enchilada sauce on top instead. Otherwise it was good.

If only a photo could also send the smell!  My family won't get out of the kitchen waiting on this to come out of the oven.  It is amazing!  The only thing I switched was I used some of our left over smoked pulled pork.   This is Keeper recipe for sure.

The whole family rated this one a keeper! I put country style ribs, some diced onion, black pepper, a bit of garlic, fajita seasoning, and 1 cup of chicken bouillon in the crock pot on low for about 6 hours. Let it cool some and then shredded it. I did everything else pretty much the same although I did add a bit of the fajita seasoning to the tomato soup and a little taco sauce. Definitely not for those looking for healthy or low calorie, but it is very tasty and makes a wonderful family meal or excellent choice for a potluck dinner.

There is way too much cheese in these, so I only used a half a cup.  I did use spicey salsa instead of the tomato soup.  My husband loved them

Bland, needed much more cheese/enchilada sauce.  I added my own jalapeno sauce and still thought it was bland.  Also could use more meat

I didn't read the reviews until after I made these.  I thought with all the ingredients (I"m a horrible cook that must follow recipes) they would be out of this world, but no.  Maybe there is something to say for simplicity.  Next time I make pork enchiladas I will use a more simple recipe with fewer ingredients.  The pork was edible with everything in it but the tortillas got soggy.

I guess, as a starting point, it's OK but we had to change it so much to give it the flavors we like that it ended up being an entirely different recipe.

I also changed it up a bit. Used only enchilada sauce and replaced sour cream with fat free yogurt. Also used corn tortillas and made it more like a casserole rather than enchiladas. Really good!

When I rolled the enchiladas I did add some Spanish rice with the pork. The tomato soup mixture worked out on the enchiladas. I served these with the typical condiments, shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, mild salsa, Spanish rice, refried beans, and sour cream. Everyone thought the enchiladas were delicious.

I used green enchilada sauce and it was delicious. I made the mistake of using a llean cut of pork which is why mine turned out a little tough. We loved the flavor that the sour cream added. I will definitely make it again but with a pork shoulder to butt instead of loin roast.

Did not use tomato soup, used enchilada sause. And added onions. My husband loves onions. This dish was a total success! My husband and daughter enjoyed every bit of it! My husband said it tasted authentic! So proud of myself! I will be making this again guaranteed!!!

I did not care for this.  It may have been the enchilada sauce I purchased.  Won't make again.  In its favor it came together quickly.

I followed the recipe as it was written. It was scrumptious! I will make it again but I'll add more pork and spray my baking dish prior to pouring the ingredients in

I used ground pork with a small amt of taco seasoning. I absolutely loved this recipe, tomato soup and all. it was a huge hit, even my picky 2yo devoured it! DEFINITELY will be kept in the rotation. Is it the healthiest, not really. But it sure is yummy!

I had some leftover pork from dinner last night and made this.  It was so good!  I got a lot of compliments.  Will be making this again!

Like many others, I swapped the tomato soup with enchilada sauce and onion powder and garlic powder for a small sized onion and fresh minced garlic, which I cooked in some olive oil.  Combined that with the green chiles and some cumin powder, which made a glorious substitution.  I used leftover pork tenderloin, which I slightly heated up and moistened and then shredded it with a fork.  I must say this turned out fabulous.  The family loved it and I found a new way to use the leftovers.

This was a great way to use leftover pork roast! My pickiest eaters gobbled it up. Instead of tomato soup, I used a can of diced tomatoes with chiles.  I think this was a great adaptation, and would not even attempt tomato soup...which is why I gave it 4 stars.

Forget the tomato soup.  I used twice as much green chile enchilada sauce.  Added sauteed onions and leftover rice to the pork for filling, then added green onions and black olives mixed with cheese on top.  Use flour or corn tortillas; both are good.  I always make at least 2 pans and put one in the freezer for a future meal.

made it as written and it was good.  Needed a bit
more seasoning to make it great and I used corn tortillas
to make it gluten free.

I gave this 4 stars because it's a good base recipe that I tweaked and it turned out nice. You can really add whatever you want to this and really personalize to your liking. I rarely follow instructions exactly,  except in baking... I didn't use canned soup, just because I never have any. I made my own enchilada sauce and used that instead of the tomatoe soup. I didn't add chilis to the meat as it was already spicy enough, and again, I didn't have them on hand. I could have probably used jalapeños or something like that. I also omitted the cumin and garlic powder because my sauce was spiced already. Overall it was an easy dish to make and tasty as well once tweaked to my preference. Good, easy way to use up pulled pork.

Very simple way to use leftover pulled pork. Skip the Tomato soup just use another can of Enchilada sauce. The tomato soup is not very "authentic". Also don't worry about using more cheese it makes them so nice and mix up the kinds of cheese for more variety.

Wonderful recipe.  The only thing I did different was add a second can of enchilada sauce to the soup mix because we like our extra saucy.  Finally something useful for leftover pork.
