Great simple recipe. I think it needed a bit more sugar but I also used half and half so not sure if that affected the taste. Will bake again though!

The recipe reminds me very much to the cheesecake I had at La Viña in Spain. So very easy and fun watching the cheesecake "burn!" 

Very sadly no leftovers when I served this dessert to guests!

Best cheesecake I've ever had! made some Blackberry sauce and whipped cream to go with it, but I'd happily eat it just as is!

Made per recipe....and it was incredible.  The hardest part is the buttering of the pan...and waiting...really.  Well unless you forget to let the cheese come to room temp.  Awesome recipe...going to have a slice now!

We increased the recipe by 33% so it would better fit our 10” spring pan. We didn’t have parchment and also forgot to butter the pan. Now worries!  Still came out delicious. Perfection, and it was very easy to prepare. We baked at 380f for 65-70 minutes in an convection oven. Thanks Chef John

It was first time for me to try this recipe but it went almost well.

I cooked with  400g cream cheese, 2 large and 1 small egg,  with 15cm cake pan. Baking time was 50mins in total (45mins: 200 degrees C, 5mins: 220 degrees C).

For the next time, 
make with half volume of ingredients for 15cm pan.
 baking time should be less than 40 mins at 200 degrees C,
   and last 5 mins 220 degrees C.
 
Anyway, at this time  the topper part burnt a bit much, but inside was so moist and tasty.  Me and my daughter love it!

Made it today for Easter dessert.....it was a bit scary watching how dark it was getting.  Haven't tasted yet, but should be wonderful!  Made a blueberry compote to go with it.
