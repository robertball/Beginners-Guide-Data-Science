After reading some reviews I almost did not try this recipe. No it is not "made from scratch" authentic Avgolemono soup(which we ARE familiar with). But it sure is VERY GOOD QUICK and EASY. I will definitely make again and again. The consistency and the amount of lemon is perfect to us. My suggestions: don't use a real cheap or instant rice (I like Riceland's Extra Long Grain) use FRESH-squeezed lemon juice 1%(or creamier) milk and add lots of fresh cracked pepper. I served with french rolls with honey-butter(recipe from this site). Great creamy quick hearty (although lacking-in-veggies) meal. For more novice cooks;add the rice and the lemon juice JUST BEFORE SERVING. I appreciate your sharing this recipe Lyndsey thank you. Dyann

Avgolemono soup by definition includes eggs and lemon.Even after doctoring it up with more lemon juice some salt and some dill it was inedible.

I tried the recipe and it actually tasted good but it was not Avgolemono Soup.

This soup really is so so simple and fast. Having said that I served this to company and NO ONE could finish a small bowl of it. It isn't awful and the lemon does a nice job of stirring up your hunger but it isn't tasty enough to finish. Give it a try though you may like it more than me and mine. Just remember to have something else to serve on hand. (A nice Greek salad hummus and crackers and fresh pears drizzled with honey keeps with the theme well.)

The greek restaurant that was by my house closed and I used to get lemon rice soup. This is the closest recipe that I have come upon. It's GOOD!

This soup was a hit at a family dinner. It is easy and lower in fat than most recipes for this soup without sacrificing taste.

I grew up near Detroit and most of the Coney Islands served a soup similar to this one. However I wanted to double the recipe and also make it more hearty. Since I did not have two cans of cream of chicken soup I added some chicken broth and milk then boiled a boneless chicken breast and shredded it into the mix. I garnish mine with dill and it is lovely and delicious! I've made this twice already and am ready for more!

Delicious! Will make over and over again. Quick and easy... and exactly the flavor I was looking for. My husband tasted it (a lot!) and said he can't wait for dinner time. I made this as written and included all 2 oz of lemon juice since we really enjoy the lemon flavor.

After learning what 'Avgolemono' is since my family and I are ignorant of Grecian cuisine I would call this soup 'simplified' instead of 'easy'. Tasty though it does feel as if it needs something else like spices and more chicken than came in the off-brand cream of chicken I used. I will say that it was a convenient soup as all ingredients are always in store at home and I've never had lemon in a soup before so the experience was enlightening. This recipe has inspired me to study and likely prepare Greek dishes and soups in the future.

I saved this but I will add the egg avgo. In a bowl I place the lemon juice and a slightly beaten egg yolk and to this mixture I add two or three tablespoon of plain chicken soup. Then I put this egg mixture into the already mixed soup with rice and turn it slowly over low heat until soup is thick. I have not tried avgolemono without the egg but must be fine.

Very creamy and a delicious quick and easy version of greek lemon soup. I substituted chicken broth for the water and added garlic salt and lemon pepper. This is a keeper for cold nights and quick and easy savory soup. Make it a meal with some additional white meat.

I was home alone tonight and we had our first snow shower of the season: put a chill in my bones thinking of what's to come... LOL Saw this recipe and figured a nice hot bowl of soup would warm me up. Well if you like canned cream of chicken soup... go for it. To me this was nothing more than that... canned cream of chicken soup with some lemon juice and a bit too much rice. Some recipes made fast and easy just don't measure up. Won't make again but now I'm on the hunt for a really good recipe for authentic Avgolemono Soup which really isn't that difficult or time consuming to make in the first place.

This recipe just didn't do it for me. I've had Avgolemono soup before at Greek restaurants and Greek Orthodox church festivals and this recipe was not similar. It wasn't even a very decent soup. I made the recipe exactly as it was written and there was way too much rice in it. I saved some of the soup for leftovers and now it looks/tastes like a casserole or rice bake not a soup. Wouldn't make it again.

Like many have said this isn't authentic Avgolemono. However for being quick and having only 5 ingredients that are usually at hand I liked it. I used a fresh lemon white jasmine rice and added garlic and parsley.

This was very good. I've never had the original so I had nothing to compare it to. I think I added too much rice because it wasn't very soupy. I didn't use the whole amount of lemon juice and it still seemed very strong to me. The second time I made it I added dill because I thought it needed something green. It added a nice bit of extra flavor. I think I may trying a touch of garlic or onion next time just for some extra kick.

I think this soup is wonderful! I have made it twice and loved it. I liked it better after the first day once the flavors had enhanced. I also like to add chicken breast. I definitely recommend it!

This is a favorite now! It seems to be best if you make this when you are planning to serve it. I let it sit and it turned into a rice pudding texture and needed to be thinned.

I thought this soup was very good although I did change a few things. I added some boiled chicken and some shaved carrotts to the recipe. I also substitued 1/2 cup of uncooked angel hair pasta broken into small pieces for the rice and I added a cup of water. It turned out very well.

As stated this was quick and easy. However it definitely is not an option for those on reduced or no-sodium diets.

Wow such a variety of ratings! I thought it was OK but definitely nothing exciting about it. I love cream of chicken soup and I guess I felt the lemon flavor killed a good thing... but also thought perhaps I just didn't like Greek. Until I read Steve's review and now wonder if this is the 'real thing.' Well whatever the reason I didn't think it was bad but it didn't excite me a lot and I doubt I'd make it again. I was easy sure and would certainly be something different to throw into a 7-course meal w/guests... it might look impression that I would come up with such a different recipe. (As long as they're not actually Greek I guess.)

Will do in a pinch but nothing like the real thing. To be expected with a base of canned soup. Satisfied the craving but think we will stick to ordering out from the local Greek joint.

I have cheated many times and made this for myself when I was craving it if you thought it had to much rice just put it was good but next time you'd cut back on the rice. Would I serve this to fellow Greeks No but again when Mom is too busy to make this for the family because you know only Mom makes it best I make this myself for a quick fix.
