I had no clue what "liquid amino acid" was. Had to look it up....gluten-free soy sauce or gluten-free tamari is a more helpful term.

I make curry dishes a lot. This sounds like a good recipe. Curry's are really good topped with slivered almonds, raisins and shredded coconut. These topping  really compliment any curry dish. Will try this tonight.

I made this last night and my wife is still raving about it. Only modifications I made was substituting almond butter for peanut butter and went a little heavier on snow peas. Served over jasmine rice. Actually tripled the recipe as we had house guests. It was super quick to assemble.

Was really excited to try this recipe, but flavours turned out very bland. :(
