Easy recipe. My wife and I really enjoyed it but it was not the kids favorite. (Not too many kids like beets after all.)For the future I will add half again as much cheese and almonds.

Great recipe.  Took to a christmas lunch.  Enjoyed by the beet lovers. Used bulgarian feta from a mediterranean deli which is salty and crumbly.  Used more lemon than called for.  Salt seems to be incidental to taste.

I added pecans and some balsamic vinaigrette.  I left out the chives due to personal preference.  This salad is the perfect complement to the spinach and feta turkey burgers (also from this site) and corn on the cob.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe works really well with yellow beets. The flavor of feta really takes over with subtle sweet earthy beets and an interesting crunch from almonds in the background. I did splash a bit more lemon juice and used homegrown tender green onions. I recommend chilling the salad for an hour or so prior to serving. Even my husband ate some of this salad, where he wouldn't eat my other beet salads. Thanks!

I had never made beets before. Got some in my CSA and needed a recipe. Now I crave this!

I followed the recipe exactly and was rewarded with a delicious salad! The flavors blend ino this tangy, earthy delight. Recipes like this make me want to have beets all the time. A keeper!
