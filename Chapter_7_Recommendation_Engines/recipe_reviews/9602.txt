Maybe it's just because I'm a guy, but I don't understand the need for these oddball measurements.  Who measures cream cheese by the tablespoon? or butter by thirds.  Here's my simplified ingredients list:
4 oz. (1/2 pkg) cream cheese
4 oz. (1 stick) butter
2 cups confectioners sugar
1 tablespoon cream
1 teaspoon vanilla

More or less to taste or to adjust consistency.

I made the following adjustments in response to other reviewers:

8 oz cream cheese
1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla
1/2 C butter
3 C powdered sugar
NO cream 

I whipped this all together with an electric mixer and it was great. Not too sweet, not to cream cheese intense. You'll want to lick this bowl!

A number of reviewers have changed the measurements of ingredients in this recipe to the point where it isn't even this recipe anymore. Only because I wanted to pipe this frosting on cupcakes did I eliminate the cream, leaving all else the same. While I do have my favorite recipes, I'm always game to try variations.  Unfortunately, this recipe will not take over others I've tried. It was not firm enough to pipe even after a half hour of refrigeration--the point being that even if you intend to just simply frost the cake I would still do so without the cream called for.

I made this to decorate a cake for a bridal shower.  It was a bit soft for intricate designs, but did well for my purposes.  I was using larger tips.  The taste was wonderful.  I doubled the recipe and had a sandwich bag size left over.  I imagine you could firm it up with more powdered sugar and be able to pipe more difficult shapes.  The taste of this is so much better than icing made from shortening!

The only change I made was to use the whole package of cream cheese-8 oz- and a 1/4 cup less powdered sugar because I like the cream cheese flavor..Excellent recipe!!  Also, omit the vanilla and add 2t maple flavoring if you want something different.

I made several changes.  I used 1 stick butter and 1 cup whipped cream cheese.  I originally started with 1/2 c cream cheese, but I could hardly taste any cream cheese flavor, so I put in the rest of the container.  Also, I only put in 2/3 cup of powdered sugar, and even my husband thought it was plenty sweet enough (and he loves sugary sweet frostings).  I also didn't use any cream, as I did not have any on hand.  Still, a good basic recipe to work from! Very creamy and easy to spread.

I read the reviews and took one viewers advice. 8 oz cream cheese, 1/2 c butter, 2 teaspoons vanilla, 3 cups confectioner's sugar, and just a dash of milk to make it softer. Everyone wanted to eat the icing straight from the bowl!

This was a great tasting frosting that was quick and easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly, however I found that the finished product was very runny. I used it to top pumpkin muffins and on the first couple it ran all down the sides. I added almost twice the amount of confectioners sugar as was stated in the recipe and eventually ended up with a nice thick, sticky frosting. I will definately use this recipe in the future.

I made it as written and thought it was a little runny, so I added the rest of the brick of cream cheese (for a total of 8 oz) and added 1/4 cup of powdered sugar (to bring it to 2 cups) and it seemed a bit sturdier.  It still spread a bit when I frosted the cupcakes, but it tasted decent.  Not my favorite cream cheese frosting recipe, but certainly not the worst.

So much better than I anticipated not too sweet and not too cheesy or tangy. I did follow the advice of Adagio and Karen Buzzi and it was perrrfect. I colored it pink and frosted a strawberry cake with it and was able to make a perfectly smooth cake after it made its "crust".

Instead of measuring 6 tbsp cream cheese, I sort of winged it...I used a full package cream cheese and vanilla coffee creamer instead of regular cream. After mixing the ingredients in the recipe I added a half container of whipped topping for more yield. It produced a great frosting consistency with a great cream cheese flavor. Thanks!

This is a very good cream cheese frosting, just a little sweeter and softer than the Cream Cheese Frosting II.  I prefer this one on strawberry cake, use the other one on carrot cake.

Mmmm, good.  I subbed orange juice for the cream and vanilla extract.  It still wasn't orangey enough so I added a tsp of orange zest and a splash of Triple Sec and a pinch of salt, c'est magnifique!  Thanks!

This recipe is great I just needed to tweak it a little. I read on one of theese reviews to use a full 8 oz pack of cream cheese, 2/3 cup of sugar, the same amount of butter and vanilla and no cream. It is the best frosting I and everyone who ate my carrot cake has ever eaten. sAnd I do suggest that you only use Philadelphia Cream Cheese it will make it taste 10 times better than any other.

A really quick, simple, delicious, and forgiving glaze to spread over any bundt or snack cake (even while the cake is still warm).  Measurements don't have to be exact plus you control the consistency/thickness of the end product by the amount of cream you add.

Delicious! It was a bit gooey, but I live where it's very humid and in the 80's even in November. For something a little different, I added in a bit of pumpkin pie spice. It was even more delicious!!

Being snowed in with a tub of cream cheese and no frosting for a cake in the oven, this recipe was perfect. The measurements being how they are worked perfectly. Thank you! It tasted much better than what comes in a can and I will be using this recipe again. The only thing I changed was this -- I was out of vanilla, so I used a tablespoon or so of French vanilla creamer instead. Didn't seem to affect it any. We made more the next day for banana bread and it was just as good also.

very tasty--used a little more of the confectioner's sugar than called for, but otherwise, the recipe was very good. Has a very distinct cream cheese flavor, which makes it taste more homemade and unique!

Easy and tasty. Added a whole package to the frosting to up the cream cheese flavour. Would make again.

this is an excellent frosting.  it tastes great, but was really thin, maybe it will harden a little in the fridge.

I used milk instead of cream because I had it on hand, I only used four tbs of butter, and 6 oz of cream cheese,and a bit less powdered sugar. it is perfect for the Christmas cut outs i frosted with it. Quite soft though.

We felt like this was good. No issues with texture. I thought it was a bit too sugary, not enough cream cheese flavor for us. It was good though.

Will never buy store bought frosting again!!  I needed cake frosting so I left out the cream to give it a thicker consistency.  It turned out perfect!  I added food coloring to make it a really fun, bright frosting.  Thanks for sharing, this was easy and its really yummy!

Yummy! I did not have cream so I used vanilla coffee whitener. Instead of vanilla I used almond extract. This was very good on Homemade Chocolate Sandwich Cookies. A big hit with the kids.

YUM!!!
I didn't add the cream as I wanted a frosting that I could pipe and that would sit and stay on top of my cupcakes, also needed to add a bit more icing sugar to thicken it up a bit. The result was a really scrummy frosting that really made my cupcakes.

This is very good and so easy!  I used more cream cheese than called for so mine wasn't thin or runny at all.  There was extra left over, so I have some on hand for my next carrot cake or cupcakes...thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious frosting! And so easy to make. I also used the whole 8 oz. of cream cheese & cut down on the sugar (I love a lot of cream cheese flavor). It turned out creamy & wonderful! I had some left over after frosting my banana bars, so I'll have to keep myself from eating the rest of it by itself! :)

The best and easiest frosting ever!  I only used 1 c. sugar and it turned out perfect for our easter cupcakes!  I loved that you could taste both the butter and cream cheese, but they were not overpowering.

I liked this frosting but wanted more of a cream cheese flavor.  This could have been due to the fact that I used whipped cream cheese but I ended up adding a lot more to get that undertone.  Overall a nice, simple recipe that tastes great

I used about 1/2 cup extra powdered sugar in this.  I put the frosting on cupcakes that had to travel, and I didn't want all the frosting to slide off.  The flavor is delicious and it's easy too.  I omitted the cream because of the soft consistency of the frosting.

This is a very good cream cheese frosting.  However, I only used 1c. of the sugar and it was plenty sweet for me!  Nice and creamy too.  It made just enough to use as a filling between layers.

This is my go-to frosting recipe for any of my cakes... from chocolate to lemon or vanilla it tastes great! It's not too sweet. I use slightly less confectioners sugar and just a bit more cream cheese to balance it out but otherwise it's a great recipe!

Fabulous!! Rich and creamy recipe. Makes enough to do the top and middle of an 8” cake, so if you want to frost a whole cake, double the recipe.

Very good! I frosted my Fabulous Carrot Cake recipe. I got the recipe from a cookbook that was put together of all the ladies that live on Galveston Island. It truly is the best I have ever found. I will try to post it tomorrow.

Very good and easy cream cheese frosting, sometimes I have found cream cheese frostings to be too sweet, but I used just 1 3/4 cups of powdered sugar and it is perfect, a little soft, but great for a banana cake and not too sweet! I did not have cream, just used a little milk instead, might be why it was thinner. Great flavor no need to alter too much.

I doubled this recipe and I'm glad I did. I don't care if ya'll don't care for the funky measurements, this frosting is super good!!  I frosted the "iced pumpkin cookies" from this site and i'm not sure I've ever made a better dessert.  Fantastic frosting.

I made this recipe to go on Pumpkin Cake III and it turned out delicious.  I only made one small change, and used coconut milk instead of cream because it's what I had on hand.  Combined with the cake, which was not overly sweet, this was a big hit.

Great recipe! I used 8 oz cream cheese as another reviewer suggested but I used the suggested icing sugar. I didn't have cream so I used milk and it was fine. Worked great for carrot cake!

This is my favorite frosting recipe.  I use it for chocolate, lemon, and carrot cakes and cupcakes.  I do add a little additional powdered sugar to make it more stiff, and then it's perfect to pipe.  Great cream cheese flavor too.

This was exactly what I was looking for! I was a little concerned at the consistency at first but after sitting overnight it firmed up well on the cookies. I put this frosting (with a little food coloring added) on the 'Mrs. Fields Sugar Cookies' found on this site.

This is the best Cream Cheese Frosting I've ever tasted.  It's very creamy.  I use it on carrot cake and the pumpkin cookies from this site.

Great idea! You get the flavour of cream cheese without being hit in the taste buds with it. Thanks for sharing!

My family loved it! I used it on "iced pumpkin cookies" from this site. What a hit. I will be using this recipe again.

Excellent, and very simple.  I ran out of the store bought frosting...and needed to finish frosting some chocolate cupcakes.  Yum!

I agree with other reviewers that the final consistency is a bit soft, but it's perfect for cupcakes and sheet cakes.  The flavor is incredible.  If you only have whipped cream cheese in the fridge, add an extra two tablespoons to compensate for the air content.
