My husband's family makes this recipe with a couple changes. They use two pounds of ground beef, one hot and one normal sausage roll and another can of green chiles. They also do not drain the chiles or jalapenos. If you freeze the mixture it will get hotter. It is very good. I have given the recipe away to a lot of members of my family.

I'm sorry, but both my husband and myself, did NOT like this dip.  I will say neither one of us care for american cheese, but I thought with the meat, and peppers that it would be okay.  I was wrong.  Maybe it will work with a different type of cheese.

Made as written except that I had a little bit of canned Rotel left from another recipe so I added it in this recipe and used a little less tomato paste. This was good with the beef and sausage combo and the jalapeno's gave it a nice kick. It was a little on the salty side but American cheese dips usually are. If made again I will start with 1 1/2 pounds of cheese to see if that works better for me.
