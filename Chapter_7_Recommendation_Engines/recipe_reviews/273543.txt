6.10.19  I make smoothies with avocados occasionally, so I was pretty sure that I’d like this, and I wasn’t wrong.  The avocado brings incredible creaminess, but I’d suggest that you start out modestly with the sugar.  I’m not into super sweet these days, so I did cut it back quite a bit to suit my taste, and it was still plenty sweet for me.  You always can add more to the blender if you want it sweeter.
