We made these wings today for the NFC championship game. Perfect football food! It was pouring rain, so we baked them at 400 degrees for 45 minutes instead of grilling, and they were perfect. The soy sauce in the marinade caramelizes and makes these wings a gorgeous golden brown. They are mouthwatering-lick-the-bones-clean-and-fight-for-the-last wing good. Can't wait for the Super Bowl so that we can try them on the grill. Thanks PartyFil

This is a great dish.  It even surprised my wife.  The only real change that I would make is --  NOTHING.  Leave it alone.  It is a nice and easy  change from just chicken with a hot sauce on it.  Sneaky mix.  This cook is to be watched for other recipes that are this tasty and simple.  Thanks for your recipe!

I tried these wings for the Super Bowl, and they were fantastic! I doubled the marinade I made 6 pounds of wings, and marinated for 24 hours, I grilled them over Kingsford hickory charcoal, for about 20 to 25 mins to get a nice crisp and a little char on them, then popped them in a 325 degree oven for about 20 mins since I used some large wings, then served half with my own garlic buffalo sauce, and half plain and they both were wonderful, great marinade, thanks for the recipe!

I usually bake my wings without the marinade and just serve tossed with Franks and melted butter, but it's worth it to try this marinade - very tasty and it makes a difference!  And I had to laugh at the post that said they won't serve this too often due to "adding fat to an already fatty meat" Hahaha - THAT'S BC IT'S A BUFFALO WING!!  It's a snack meant for serving while watching a football game - not as a formal entree.  Some people and most all restaurants actually DEEP FRY them before adding the sauce and butter, so definitely not "health food."   It's a good thing the author didn't mention that they are traditionally served with Bleu Cheese Dressing for dipping!!

Its 7 degrees here today, so I baked these in the oven for 45 minutes at 400 degrees.   Served them with brown rice and a salad.  Perfect!  Will definately make these again.

I am very critical of food usually, but these wings are AMAZING! When I marinated the chicken in the soy sauce and italian dressing, I also added chopped garlic and it was so good. Also, if you are cooking larger pieces of chicken, grill for a bit and then finish in the oven to avoid charring.

POSITIVELY YUMMY!!!  I have been searching for a chicken wing recipe and this is the one.  First of all it uses easy ingrediants and you can prep it ahead of time.  I marinaded overnight and cooked in the afternoon.  I flipped the plastic bag a few times last night and a few this morning.  The second point is that you can cook them on the grill or in the oven depending on the weather/season.  I cooked them per a previous recommendaton at 400 degrees for 40 minutes (lining pan with non stick foil).  They browned beautifullyand looked just awesome. They were cooked just right. Make sure that wings are facing up.  Third point is that they are delicious and the sauce gives it the perfect spice.  The house smells great, too!!  Thank you Grillmaster!!

First off thank you to whoever posted this recipe. These wings are incredible- I cook them for about 40 minutes on my Weber charcoal grill over indirect heat using lump charcoal (not Kingsford junk). After they come off the grill they sit in a large bowl with foil over them for about 10 minutes to make them fall off the bone tender. While these are foiling you'll want make up the sauce. Toss the wings/sauce in the same bowl used to foil and let sit for another 5 minutes and then throw back on the grill for 5-10 minutes and you're good to go. These never last longer than 15 minutes whenever theres a game on.

Really easy and really good.  Replaced the hot sauce with honey (same measurements) for a sweet alternative to the hot. Worked great.

My husband went nuts for these.  I didn't have any wings, so I used drummies, and cooked them at 425 for 40 minutes.  After marinading, I didn't drain the marinade and pat the chicken like the recipe states.  I cooked the drummies in the marinade then drained the  pan and added the sauce mix.  I also read the recipe incorrectly and only added italian dressing mix instead of actual Italian dressing to the soy sauce, and it still worked out great.  These never even made it to the table, my husband ate them all standing over the pan.  He loves wings and said these have the best flavor he's had.  I only used a few table spoons of Frank's instead of 1/4 cup, but other than that I made exactly as written and they got rave reviews.

This has become the "only way" to make wings at our house! Very tasty! I prebake (@375) my wings after marinading to cook off some of the fat (about 20-25 minutes, turning half way through) before grilling. I've made the buffalo sauce to recipe as well as adding a 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder. We have also used this for barbeque wings or any other sauce. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

These wings were amazing. I let them sit in freezer bags in marinade over night, and added a little red hot sauce to the Italian dressing and Soy Sauce. SO good... will definitely be making again!

These are awesome Buffalo style wings. I served them with home made Buttermilk Blue Cheese dressing. There were none left, and everyone was licking their fingers.       Cooks note: Don't discard the wing tips, throw them in a ziploc bag and freeze for the next batch of home made stock!

I'm from Buffalo and these were the best wings I've ever had.  I didn't change anything about the recipe.  They were perfectly spicy (they didn't burn your mouth, but had a nice kick).

In a word, awesome! I couldn't resist tweaking just a bit - I added 1/4 cup of light brown sugar to the marinade and about 1/8 cup of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce to the sauce...cooked as per directions. The brown sugar gave the wings a nice caramelized quality while only producing just a slight hint of sweet. When combined with the sauce, the result was really spectacular. Some of the best wings I've had, bar none.

Pretty good. My husband would like them more spicy, and my daughter less spicy, but that's not the recipe's fault. I would hesitate to serve this too often because of the fat added to an already fatty cut of meat. Thanks!

Would have given 5 stars, but I have never understood how anyone thinks butter on chicken wings makes them better.

I marinated the wings for a day and a half.  Based on other comments I basted the wings on the grill with the sauce after they were fully cooked (once on each side and one flip on the grill).  I used a pre-made buffalo wing sauce instead of the hot sauce recommended and they were wonderful and really did need the sauce at the end.

Are you kidding me.........these were awesome!!  I didn't even have Franks hot sauce at home, I had Tobascco sauce so I never got to do the second part of the recipe.  If these wings taste better after using the Franks than from just from being marinated, I may have to make them weekly.   My DH was lovin' them too!!!!

Excellent simple marainade!  Great just off the bbq w/o the added  buffalo sauce (5 stars for just this part)...Not as great with the buffalo sauce - pretty greasy.  I'm going to try step 1 thru the bbq process...then toss into a crock wiith a bit of buffalo sauce -- or something with an asian flair -- to keep warm.  The wings produced by the first part of the recipe are just too good to give up on!!

These wings are just STUPID good! We all loved them! I marinated them overnight and the flavor was great!
My advice is to use a charcoal grill if you can. I push all the coals to one side, creating a hot & cool zone. Get the widest spatula you can (think mini shovel). Constantly turning 30-50 chicken wings can get old FAST! 
I throw the wings onto the hot side of the grill for a little bit. Then shovel them back to the cool side. Place lid on grill & let them cook indirectly for a while. Repeat this process..eventually the wings will be perfectly browned & crispy!

Two thumbs up on this one! Substituted skinless chicken breast, low sodium soy sauce, light Italian dressing, cut the butter in half and after coating with sauce, put on a foil lined cookie sheet and broiled 5 minutes on each side. A little healthier but still full of flavor. I will make it again!

For just two items in the marinade, they were fantastic. Cooked them in the oven and they turned out great! Used Franks Extra Hot Sauce in the sauce. Many compliments.

Excellent chicken. I used light soya sauce as I like a lighter taste. After marinading over night....I  cooked the chicken in the oven in the marinade @ 400 for an hour then I grilled it on the bbq. untill crispy and added the final sauce. My family loved it and because it was cooked in the oven in the marinade the chicken fell off the bone.
Thanks for the yummy recipe

These were perfect!  I only put the hot sauce on half so that people that did not like spicy could have some.  Great either way!

pretty tasty.I found the sauce made the wings a little soggy.I think a very quick kiss back on the que would have helped that.

a nice change in taste from your traditional wing...we don't think we will even use the butter sauce next time because the marinade was more than delicious!

Follow the recipe exactly and you can't go wrong!  I did cook them at 400 degrees for 45min since it's winter here though.  They were still excellent!

Excellent recipe!  Made these for an appetizer at a bbq...  Marinated the wings for 36 plus hours... Yum!  After grilling I decided to do a 60/40 split of saucing...  60% sauced with the "Buffalo" and 40% unsauced...  They were both a big hit!  Who knew that some people don't like buffalo wings as much as we do?  The flavors of both versions are outstanding!  Have made this a least 4 times now, always leaving at least a few unsauced.  Fantastic change from the standard buffalo wings, an unexpected pleasure!!!  Thanks for the post!!!

I've been wanting a deep fryer for a long time now just so I could make some good wings.  With this recipe I no longer feel the need.  I've made it twice now and it is spectacular.  The second time around I only made a minor change and that was using slightly less soy sauce.  I'm a salt fan, but I found that the extra teaspoon in the sauce was unnecessary.  It could be because I use the high test soy sauce.  Also, I used frozen, pre-cut wings simply to save time.  But, either way, both attempts came out great.  These are easily the best tasting wings I've ever had.  Thanks PartyFil-Grillmaster for sharing this recipe.

Bake at 400 for 50 minutes. I use a large baking pan with a grill that fits inside and I flip them half way. If you do this they will be somewhat crispy on both sides and you won’t even need the hot sauce, trust me.... Perfect

I thought these were very good even without sauce. Because of personal tastes, I made two sauces for these. The one exactly as directed and one the same except for switching out honey for the Frank's. And they are great without sauce too. Perfect footballl food. Oh, and I baked at 400 for 45 minutes, turning once.

Delish!! I made these tonight to go with a BBQ dinner; didn't put the pepper sauce on them because kids were dining with us, and the marinated wings were just as good as the ones we dipped into the hot sauce! The only change I made was baking them on a rack above a drip pan at 425 degrees for 40 minutes to free up grill space. Thanks for a keeper!

After reading all the reviews about this recipe, I must admit I wasn't that impressed. I followed the recipe almost to a T..only changes made were in the time I marinated the chicken (about 6 hours). Flavor wise they were OK..nothing spectacular.

wow these were terrific!  not too spicy I love spicy it doesn't love me!  Hubby liked them but even though he denied, they could have been ramped up for him.  Also with 9 in of snow on the ground I did cook them in the oven, and following oven reviews, baked them, didn't wipe off marinade and then set them to broil for a couple of mins to get the "char"  love them love them

Ok, this was really good according to the wing connoisseurs. I should have read the directions before offering to make this for the Rose Bowl party (love you Badgers!). Why? Well, revving up the outdoor grill the month of Jan in Wisconsin is DESPERATE :) Oh well, the guys NEVER complained and ate every single wing. I used FRANKS RED HOT BUFFALO WING sauce (regular heat) as recommended by other reviewers. I made NO changes. I would definitely make this again but next time...a football game before it's below zero.

The wings were awesome!  As it was storming when I made these I put them in the oven at 400 degrees for about 35-40 minutes as a couple of reviewers suggested. I couldn't find Frank's sauce so used my favorite, Sriracha chili sauce, which is the wonderful hot sauce used in Chinese cooking.  In the interest of cholesterol management I did some substituting and used only one tablespoon of butter and 3 of Smart Balance, olive oil variety.  Even with the substitution I think the sauce had a really nice texture and consistency.

These wings are AWESOME!  Threw 6 wings  in 2 ziplock bags, and squished out as much air and laid it flat in the fridge.  Flipped as often as I remembered, around 4-5 times.  Cooked 2 batches and found that the second batch - we cooked it longer, and the first marinade carmelized and crusted on the wings, then the second coating was another level of flavor.  Served with some ranch dressing, but these wings could easily stand on their own.  Awesome!!!

Wonderful!!!  I LOVE wings and am so glad I can make them at home and them turn out to be as tasty as a restaurant.  I followed recipe to a "T" but only was able to let them sit in marinade for 4-5 hours. (I would have liked to have them sit over night.)  I also put them in the oven because it's about 30 degrees outside and I didn't want the wings bad enough to freeze while making them on the grill lol.  The only thing I DIDN'T do was pat the wings dry after taking out of the marinade.  I will do next time because it caused the wings to get a little crisp where the marinade stuck to the cookie sheet I had them on, in the oven.  Husband and guests were VERY pleased with them and I WILL make them many times in the future.

Absolutely delish! I marinaded my chicken wings for 2 hrs and baked them for 40 mins at 400 degrees. I only used 2 tbsp of butter, but it honestly didn't need it. I also used franks hot buffalo sauce and it was perfect. Will make again!

I have made these a few times now and everyone loves them. Did not change a thing. Marinade the night before leaving for a comping trip and grilled a few days later. Made these for my mom and step-dad who do not like anything hot and they loved them. Great chicken wings just the right amount of heat.

According to my son, I'm now the "Best Chicken Wing Cooker, EVER," thanks to this recipe.  We used 5lbs of wings and there wasn't a single one left!  Everyone enjoyed them.  We didn't toss them in the sauce, but left it out for those who wanted it to drizzle over their own wings.  And we used Franks BBQ Wing Sauce for it rather than hot pepper sauce b/c there were kids eating it.  We did  cook them in an oven and while they turned out GREAT, I'd love to try them on a grill.  THANK YOU!

I made this with chicken thighs and it was great.  I just used the sauce as a dipping sauce, cause some didn't want any on theirs but it still tasted great.  Simple recipe but tasted great.

I made these for dinner last night and just had some for lunch today...these are some of the best hot wings!  My husband had seconds for dinner last night and that is always a compliment!  At the last minute I decided to bake mine in the oven.  I looked at other reviewers and they suggested 400 F for 45 minutes and they came out so good.  I stuck to the recipe, which is so simple, and I will definitely be making these again and for company too.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just finished eating these and they're FABULOUS. Didn't separate the wing parts as they grill easier still intact. Marinated mine for nearly 24 hours. I didn't have Italian dressing but I looked on a recipe called "Italian Dressing Mix" on this site and I happened to have all of the ingredients for that so I just mixed up the herbs and spices (except with only a third of the salt), added a little cayenne for a little kick in the marinade/dressing, and then added a little bit of vinegar, water and olive oil to the completed marinade as would be in a store-bought Italian dressing. That Italian dressing recipe is a godsend as well, what I do know is I wont be buying that stuff at the store anymore with that easy to put together and very versatile recipe.  But anyway I charcoal grilled these wings and they are like sex on bones! Seared for about 2-3 minutes each side, then put the chicken off of the coals, covered and smoked on indirect heat for another 20-25 minutes or so while I fried some french fries and had some delicious garlic bread in the oven. EXCELLENT meal altogether even if some don't like to use chicken wings as an entree center.

These were great!!!  Made a double batch these wings for our SuperBowl party.  We tasted the wings after grilling and the taste from the marinade was so good we decided to put sauce on only half of them and to serve the other half as is.  The only thing that I changed was that I didn't pat them completely dry before grilling them.  Left some of the marinade on them.

First off, let me say that I cooked the chicken too long. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cut them into smallish tenders. Browned them in a hot skillet on the stove then added them along with the sauce to a baking dish, covered it with foil and kept warm in the oven at 200 degrees. Even with the marinade they were a tad dry and a bit tough. But that was my fault, I need to prepare them better next time. I really want to comment on the sauce. It was excellent! Both hubby and I really enjoyed the taste and as a matter of fact, this Texas girl just found a new favorite hot sauce in Frank's Red Hot from New Jersey!! Who knew? lol!!! Spicy and tasty but not burning hot. Thanks Grillmaster!

These got RAVE reviews at my superbowl party!  What a great recipe!  The only thing I added was a bit of cayanne pepper to spice up.  I put the wings on the smoker for about 20 minutes (at 375 degrees with Cherry wood), then covered with sauce and placed in oven at 375 degrees for about 10 minutes.  I covered in sauce again before serving.   I made a batch of honey garlic wings which didn't have the marinade and they weren't even close in amount of flavor!  Thanks PartyFil-Grillmaster, this is a definite keeper.

These are amazing, my husband had his doubts but was blown away.  Note, don't use Franks Chicken wing sauce, like we did,it is 2 1/2 times saltier than regular Franks, which we didn't realize.  But they were still amazing, a keeper for sure, as is. Thank you.

This is truly a delicious recipe, though I made my own additions: added about 1 T of garlic powder to the hot sauce as well as about 2-3 T of honey.  Came out FABO!!

Excellent wing recipe. For people worried about over charring just grill these indirect medium and then there's no need to finish in the oven. If you have a charcoal grill just pile coals to one side and put meat on the other. Gas grills just leave the middle burner off.Huge hit and worth a try if you are skeptical.

WOW! Best wings ever! Since we don't like hot, I used mild wing sauce in place of the hot pepper sauce - other than that followed to a T. This is the only way we will eat wings from now on! Delicious!

The reviews are correct, these wings are amazing!!!  I followed the recipe to a T the first time, but now, I omit the butter part and just toss the wings in Frank's Buffalo wing sauce after I take them off the grill.  They are fantastic!

These were delicious.  I live in an apartment, so I don't have a grill.  I used a grill rack and baked them for 45 minutes at 425.  They were definitely cooked, but when I make them again I'll cook them slower for a couple of hours.  It was taking too long to properly caramelize them in the oven, so we just ate them.  They were delicious, and I would make this again.

These were great! I halved the recipe for 1.5 pounds of wings, marinated them in mojo and soy sauce for 30 minutes, cooked them in a 9x9 glass dish uncovered for 60 minutes at 400 degrees in the marinade, rearranged them halfway through, brought them out and added the wing sauce to the whole thing. Mmmm so yummy! Just the right amount of hotness!

I baked the wings for 30 minutes in a 350 degree oven after removing from the marinade and before placing on the grill.  This expedited the grilling time to under ten minutes with excellent results.

I wanted a quick and easy recipe for doing wings on the grill and came upon this one. Boy did I strike it rich! Not only is this a great wing recipe but have since used the same when preparing bone in breasts and thighs. Just adjust the amount of hot sauce to taste. 
This one is a keeper.

I LOVE CHICKEN WINGS...and thought I would try this recipe.  I usually make my wings by either grilling or deep frying, adding the hot sauce & butter.  But this marinade just adds a nice flavor!  Really liked them.  Will make again...and followed the recipe just as it is.

OMG! 5-lb wings on sale for $5.00 and while looking for new & different recipes, came across this one. Lucky us :) These are one of the most delicious wings we've ever BBQ'd!! ONLY change, cut the soy sauce in half for the marinating part due to the salt factor and left in bag all day. The marination time is important (at least 5 hours) and "babysat" them on the grill, turning often...WOW!! Thanks PartyFil..THE Grillmaster :)

It wasn't bad, but I guess we just prefer the traditional buffalo wings.  We probably won't be making this again.

Great! But you MUST use a good hot sauce, not Crystal, as it does not have enough heat to come through.

So easy - and made easier in the slow cooker.  I threw frozen wings in at noon on high along with the sauces.  I added a bit of sugar as it had a teriyaki taste that needed a bit of sweetening (Splenda works, too).  They were crisped up in the oven but would be awesome on the BBQ.  I didn't use the dipping sauce. These were really tasty and easy.

Excellent!! I used a lower setting on my grill and turned the wings every 5 to 10 minutes.  I don't like charred wings or flare ups and although I still had some char on them by the time they were cooked, it wasn't as bad as it would have been with the grill set to medium. And once the hot sauce was poured over them, the char went away and they were fantastic!!  Will do these again frequently.  Thanks for posting.

Absolutely the BEST chicken wings ever. Must use Frank's Hot Sauce. Followed the recipe as written. Take the time to bbq the chicken wings. End product is to die for!  Can't wait to make is again.

This recipe is outstanding.  I doubled the sauce and only had to cook the chicken a total of 16 minutes (8 minutes on each side).  My wife usually doesn't like chicken, but after tasting these she demanded an equal portion.  I used low sodium Soy Sauce as the other reviews suggested.  Just follow the directions and you can't go wrong!

We are loving these wings! Added a couple minced cloves of garlic to the marinade. I fail at grilling raw, on the bone chicken so I baked them in the oven at 375 degrees for just over 20 minutes before I put them on the flame for the good grilled taste. Five Stars!

followed the recipe except for at the end when you mix the chicken with melted butter and hot sauce.  I used fat free hot wing sauce to cut out fat content.  these turned out great.  the marinade had great flavor! thanks for sharing

They were good but it is easier and less fattening to just grill the wings with a little salt and pepper, toss in sauce and put back on the grill for a couple of minutes. We use Anchor Bar and there is never any leftovers!

Husband didn't want to grill so followed the advice of other reviewers and baked at 400 for 45 and these were delicious!  Couldnt really taste the butter in the sauce so I'm thinking about reducing to 1 tbsp ( from 4) next time. Thx for sharing such a yummy easy recipe!

Absolutely fantastic! I did the marinade exactly as is and they were great. I didn't use the butter and hot sauce as my son does not enjoy anything spicey. However, he raved about the wings in the marinade. This is a keeper.

This recipe is AWESOME!  Makes the BEST wings EVER!  I literally could have stood over the crockpot and ate them all night.  I got a ton of compliments.  Very easy to make for a party.  I marinated overnight, grilled them and then put them in the crockpot to keep warm during our party.  PERFECTION!!

I will make these again, for sure!

These wings were delicious!! I marinated them overnight and BBQ the next day.  I put half in the hot sauce and then some in BBQ sauce for my daughter. I actually got a compliment from her which is rare that these were sooo good. She ate about 12 wings. She said we don't have to go to PlanetWings anymore. Can't wait to make again. I will also use this receipe on steaks cant wait to try.
ENJOY!!!

Just a thought....I will grill 10 to 20 pounds of wings at one time spread out in batches.   After they cool throw them in a freezer bag and freeze.....Need a snack or people come over just throw them on a cookie sheet and warm up in the oven...make your sause and you are serving in no time flat..

These were excellent and easy to prepare. Instead of chicken wings, I used chicken drumsticks to feed a crowd. Got many compliments on the sauce -- I used Frank's hot sauce as recommended with a few dashes of Trader Joe's jalapeno pepper hot sauce. You will not be disappointed if you make this recipe.

So so so so good!! After they were cooked, I dipped the wings in the sauce and put them on the top rack of the grill for about 10 minutes and then coated them again before serving.

This is the best chicken wing recipe I have ever used. I did bake them in the oven due to the weather. 400 for 45 mins and then added the sauce for an additional 15 mins. They were delicious. Can't wait to make them on the grill!

WOW - made 6lbs of these wings for a party yesterday - it was a HUGE HIT!  Everyone said they were the best wings EVER - and I totally agree.  Had a hard time finding Frank's at first, but finally found it here in So CA at Albertsons - many varieties to chose from but I ended up with Frank's Red Hot Wings Buffalo.  I Thanks for this keeper and repeater recipe!

used good seasonings packet made per salad dressing instructions (1 cup), 1/2 cup kikkoman soy sauce, 5 crushed garlic cloves, dash cayenne pepper, smidge brown sugar.  Marinated a flat iron steak 6 hours. Delicious, tender, a tad too salty...may try reduced sodium soy next time.  Thanks for a great marinade base.

Highly recommend. .. very picky about wings and had NEVER attempted to make my own tull these. I now grill them at least once a week.  They're good even without the sauce as "plain" too.  I used Frank's Red Hot sauce... I also made homemade ranch dressing and Mmmm nice pairing.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Yes, these are just that good!  I decided to cook these in the oven and they were just as good.  I did marinade them overnight and cooked them approximately 35 minutes at 375 convection oven temp. I made them just as written otherwise.  My entire family liked them with the sauce and just with the marinade as well. Either way they were tasty.

These came out really good. After the chicken was grilled to perfection I tossed them with the butter sauce and put them back on the grill for a few minutes. Nicely charred and crispy on the outside, super tender on the inside. Great, simple recipe.

All I have to say is that this recipe is awesome! Made these for a small dinner gathering and everyone was complementing on how delicious they were. I tripled the recipe and used 8 lbs of wings. Added more of the hot sauce at the end. Thanks for this wonderful recipe ??

Delicious! I grill the chicken wings to get a nice char on them, then finish in the oven. The longer they marinate, the more flavor they have, so if you can, let them marinate overnight. I also accidentally used buffalo wing sauce instead of plain hot sauce.

So glad we marinated these, as directed.  This imparted a layer of flavor not usually found in hot wings.  However, these were not spicy at all, in spite of basting continually with the hot sauce during the portion of cooking.  The flavor was great, however, just not a "hot" wing, even though I sprinkled them liberally with cayenne after marinating and before grilling.

I've made this SO many times. Every time I have to buy an extra pack of wings. I went from one 3 pound pack, to THREE, 3 pound packs. It's super easy, and I've given the recipe to everyone I know. Thanks so much for this! :-)

To my husband, nothings screams SUMMER like wings on the grill. This is an excellent recipe for that.
The marinade is phenomenal and shouldn't be skipped. I have done these in the oven, in an infrared oven, and of course on the grill. They always turn out flavorful and juicy. I make these over and over and they always disappear quickly.

It was alright. My daughter did not want to continue eating it. She thought the addition of italian dressing was weird and by adding the same amount of soy sauce as the dressing made it very salty.

Our first attempt at cooking wings on the grill.  They were fabulous!  I didn't use the marinade, will try it next time.  Also doubled the sauce, as we wanted them really saucy!!  Will make again!

I made these yesterday for the super bowl.  I baked them in the oven at 400 degrees for 40 minutes.  They were amazing, the best wings I've ever had!  My husband--who does not normally eat wings--also thought they were the best wings he's ever had, and he ate a bunch!  Thanks for the simple recipe!

My husband made the sauce they are dipped in after they are cooked.  He did like the flavor.  He added many different things to this sauce, simply because we didn't have enough of the red chili sauce.  He said he would make this again.

I followed the first part of the recipe adding the juice of one lime. I made boneless wings and baked for 20 minutes. After baking I tossed them in 1/4 cup chipolte Tabasco 1/8 cup lime and 1 tsp honey. They were a HUGE hit. Will definitely be making these again!

I hadn't printed off the recipe so I kind of "winged" it (horrible pun intended!) However, that just goes to show you how flexible this is, and that the combo of these flavors is fantastic. I used Sriacha instead of hot sauce, and I wouldn't change a thing!

Tasty.  I wasn't sure if the dark soy I used caused the meat to turn dark or the fact I marinated them in a vacume marinator.  I will try light soy next time.

WOW! Not only were these easy to prepare and cook but they were delicious!  Nice flavors happening here with just enough heat.  This will definitely be my go to chicken wing recipe from now on.  Thank you for sharing this one.

Best wings I have ever made.  I usually deep fry them but usually ended up with dried out wings.  I baked them for about 45 min at 400 degrees as someone else suggested and the meat fell off the bone they were so tender.  The best part of this recipe was the marinade and the method of cooking (even though it was in the oven as opposed to grill) I may try different sauces on the wings in the future but those two things in this recipe will not change for me.  I was asked to make this again and will oblige.  Cheers!

These were very good.  A nice change from regular wings.  Not too spicy, but can add more Franks if you like it hotter.  I broiled them this time due to a monsoon outside but can't wait to try them next time on the grill.  Thanks!

These wings are AWESOME.  I'm not sure I can describe how awesome they are, as a matter of fact.  The wing sauce was great, spicy with just the right amount of kick but not "melt your tongue" hot.  The only change I made was to bake them at 425 degrees for about 50 minutes.  It made the wings nice and crispy.  Now I'm off to eat some more of these wings.  Seriously.

These were good, but after all the rave reviews, I was expecting a bigger flavor.  Everyone enjoyed them and they're great for a large crowd when there may be some who don't like the spice that I like on my wings.

Great recipe!  I used boneless skinless strips instead of wings.  I also used worchestershire because I didn't have soy.  The only thing I DIDN'T do is marinate it long but they were still great!  Next time I will definitely plan to let marinate.

Fantastic! Used boneless chicken breasts instead of wings and it was mouth watering. You can even get away with less butter/hot sauce if you desire.

We've made these four times now. Just as the recipe states and they are wonderful. My son first wanted hot wings for his 9th birthday and this was the recipe we used. We ALL loved them. Then we made them for my husbands guy day, they were a hit, followed by game night, again another hit and again for just us and dinner. Amazing. They are wonderful wings and an outstanding recipe. Thank you so much for sharing

I have to say for someone who grills/smokes year round and always looking for news ways to cook meat, these wings where great! I normally use rubs and spices but these where really good. took longer to cook 2hrs because i smoked them (low and slow)I will definitely be doing them again

Perfect! We loved this so much! The only difference for us is we made this for chicken thighs instead of wings, but the Franks didn't make it too hot but perfectly flavorful - we only use Franks, it's the best!! Delicious, we'll make this regularly!!

These were great. More mild than I thought it would be. Kid friendly. It ended up raining so I broiled in the oven, about 40 minutes altogether. Thanks! It was a hit at the party.

Great recipe, I have been using a similar one for years.  The only thing different is I add some worcestershire sauce to the soy and Italian dressing mix.

I loved these wings! They were a big hit. They were not overly spicy, but still didn't have that wimpy watered down taste. You will want to eat and eat and eat! You might want to double the recipe if this is for a party. It didn't seems to make that much food. YUM

Instead of grilling, I cooked the wings in my NuWave oven for 8 minutes on each side. Otherwise made as directed...FANTASTIC!

These were amazing. I actually ran out of wing sauce, so I added some BBQ sauce and they turned out yummy. I would suggest using low sodium soy sauce. They were a tad salty.

In a word "WOW"...these are the best wings I've ever eaten. Hubby agrees. I have never heard my kids say "MMMM" so much during dinner. I used Franks red hot for the sauce and it was the perfect amount of hotness (I don't like things super spicy) This was also my first time ever cooking wings on the BBQ and that's the only way to do them from now on. This will be a staple in my home from now on!!

WOW!  I use these same ingredients on bite sized chicken, but add garlic powder and nature season (all Wal-Mart brand) to the marinade.  My family calls it "candy chicken"! (I fry them WITH the marinade).  Great on hot wings!  I use double the hot sauce and Italian dressing, but same amount of soy and butter.  Leave some plain for kids.  GREAT recipe!

My husband loved them, I could not find that particular hot sauce, so I didn't think they had enough zing to them.  But I will make them again and again.

Delicious! I did change the cooking method. We were not able to griil so, I popped these into a hot 400 degree oven for about 30 minutes and then broiled them for a few minutes. Great flavor and the sauce was perfect! We are going to use this recipe on chicken tenders next time - and there will be a next time. Thanks for posting PartyFil!

used boneless chik breasts & followed recipe to a tee (except a little more soy & little less butter in sauce part) and it is SO GOOD!!!  i patted the chicken dry before grilling & i feel like that made some kind of big difference in the way ti cooked.  anyway - definitely great & will make again for sure!

the best marinade. this makes the chicken wings tasty with or without any sauce. made these for super bowl and did three different sauces and people raved about them. one trick i found online is once you take the wings out of the marinade, if you are going to bake them and not grill them, use a tablespoon of baking powder for every pound or two and coat the wings with the baking powder. this will oven bake them crisp.

Was a little skeptical but wanted to grill some wings with a different recipe. Cooked wings to spec. (Sans sauce). They turned out great. Only marinated for 3-4 hrs and seem to be enough. We didn't even think of the sauce once they were plated. (Not to mention I completely forgot to make it). They were super flavorful and super juicy (thanks to the cooks best friend... a thermometer). I was afraid they would be a little salty or have a strong oriental/soy sauce flavor but they didn't at all. My 5 year old daughter even gobbled then down and sang my praises. Thanks for the recipe. Can't wait to try with the sauce next time... and there will be a next time!! Cheers!

I used chicken legs with the skin on and marinated them overnight then baked them and added the sauce at the end.  Hubby and I loved them.  Lot's of flavor and it is so easy.  I am on my 3rd batch of these and will adding them to my regular rotation.

I was looking for a little zip in our grilled chicken and this was a great marinade.  I did add a little Hickory smoke flavor to it and a dash of peri peri seasoning!  I actually used it as a marinade for chicken quarters.  I also did use half the recommended hot sauce.  Definitely a season to taste!

This recipe is great!  The only change I would make is make sure you use low-sodium soy sauce!  Gets a little salty with regular soy sauce.

By far the best Grilled Wing Recipe I have found to date. I let them marinade for about 6 hours. I, also, tweaked the recipe a bit by adding "Buffalo Wild Wings: Desert Heat©" Rub after we dried them.

I'm still getting random text messages telling me how good the wings were....2 days after. Great Recipe! Highly Recommend!!!!

BTW: I did not use the sauce recipe provided & just let people sauce them as they liked........most people ate them plain .

We thought they were  too salty also.  It might be because we use small drumettes.  Will give it another try with reduced sodium soy or skip the soy sauce although.  First time grilling wings and the grilling aspect was perfect and hopefully a little healthier than frying.

This is an excellent recipe, but I would not bake these wings in the oven as many reviewers have suggested.  These wings are fantastic on the barbecue where you have that smoky flavor mixed with the teriyaki marinade.  But the marinade is far too strong for baking the wings--with that method you end up with wings that taste far too strongly of soy sauce.  Stick to the grill with this recipe and you will be very, very happy.

These wings were excellent. I thought the combination of soy sauce and Italian dressing was a little strange, but tried it anyway. Cooked them on my large Big Green Egg and they came out delicious. Didn't change the recipe at all except used Crystal Wing Sauce.

I boiled down marinade and divided it between 2 ramekins. One ramekin I left as is, the other one I added some Frank's hot sauce. I divided the wings so that 1/3 were basted w/ just marinade, 1/3 basted w/ marinade & hot sauce & the other 1/3 I basted w/ just the hot sauce. All delish!!

I make these wings all the time. Everyone I have made them for absolutely loves them, and I'm always being asked for the recipe. I don't have a grill, so I make mine in the oven. I think they would be even better on the grill because it's hard to get that crispy skin in the oven. The sauce is amazing though. Such an odd combination of flavors, but they make a surprisingly good mix.

These wings were AMAZING!  My girlfriend said they were the best she’s ever had that I made or that she’s had at restaurants.  

Our only criticism is that they were a tiny tiiiinny bit too salty.  I only used 1/3rd of a cup of soy for the marinade.  Next time I will use low sodium soy and I think they will be perfect.  

I grilled them, tossed them in the hot sauce mixture, then put them back on the grill for a few mins.  I used Frank’s hot sauce and unsalted butter.  The total grill time was 35 mins.  Enjoy!

Great recipe, I just added a few tweaks. When adding the spices I also used Fox Point  seasoning by Penzeys spices.
Garlic powder by Penzeys, and roasted garlic & bell pepper seasoning by McCormick. I don't like things to spicy so I also used Franks mild hot wing sauce.

These wings have been a hit both times I've made them!  I'm a super lazy cook so I purchased a 5lb bag of frozen wings that is resealable.  After they thawed in the fridge I dumped all the liquid out, put the marinade in the bag, resealed it and placed it back in the fridge until ready to grill.  If you change the recipe to 17 servings it is perfect for 5lbs of wings.  Once they were grilled I added the sauce and mixed in around really well then placed them into a crockpot to take with us.  This is the second time I've made them and they are really good without the sauce and perfect for anyone who dosen't like spicy food.  I can't wait to try what others have suggested by substituting the hot sauce with honey for a different flavor.  This is definitely our "go to" wing recipe from now on!  Thank you so much for posting this!

Awesome!  I was a little skeptical at first with all the soy sauce in this recipe.  I thought they must surely taste like a salt lick.  And I'm not a fan of "salty".  But nope...they're incredible :)  Must remember to follow directions and pat the wings/drummies dry prior to placing on the grill...otherwise they're more likely to burn.  My husband LOVES LOVES LOVES these!  I have to say, they ARE pretty darned YUMMY ;)  Thanks for the GREAT (not to mention ridiculously EASY) recipe!

Made this with a cut up fryer on the grill and it was delish! Cooked slow and low. Cannot wait to try with just wings. Will be a staple come football season.

Less sodium Soy sauce
& Italian dressing.  
Marinade meat for 2hrs(or more depending on thickness of meat)
Fire up bbq and grill.
AMAZING!!! 
I didn't have wings on hand so I skipped the sauce and used boneless skinless chicken thighs.
Can't wait to try it with wings.

I have 2 favs now, this recipe & mahogany chicken wings.  Thanks so much!

Sorry but we did not like this recipe. It did not stay on the wings and was bland. I was disappointed.

This works as a basic recipe for grilling wings.  I didn't make the sauce, just grilled the marinated wings and they tasted great!  I had large, whole wings so grilling took a bit longer but it was worth it.

Took these to a SuperBowl party where several people had brought various types of chicken wings.  These were the only ones completely gone at the end!  Will definitely do again.

My husband and I did not care for these.  We both thought the Italian dressing gave the wings a weird taste.  We prefer to just salt and pepper the wings when grilling and then use Frank's Hot Buffalo Sauce spiked with a little hot sauce (we love spicy).  We don't use butter in the sauce.

I made these as a "trial run" to find the best wing recipe before making them for a super bowl snack.  My two teenage sons and myself felt these were wonderful and the best I've ever made.  My oldest said "they were to die for."  This WILL be our super bowl wing recipe and for any other occasion. ( Which may now need to be weekly...) I WILL make these again... and again... and again...Other than making 1/2 of the original recipe,  I followed it exactly.  Thank You Grill Master!!

Ok, so I was looking for a good wing recipe and saw all the hype surrounding this recipe so I decided to give it a shot.  OMG, thank you All Recipes for this!!!!  Best wings I have ever had.  My friends were all impressed and I stuffed myself into a chicken wing coma.

I made this for the 1st time and followed the directions exactly. The family loved them!  I might try a little pineapple or orange juice in the marinade next time for a little variation. 
Definitely a keeper!

I followed this recipe exactly, except I did 4 lbs. instead of 3 so I increased ingredients accordingly! I looked at several wing recipes for the slow cooker but wound up with this one because of the ease of grilling the wings and how simple the recipe is. They turned out really good and plenty spicy. I can’t stress out how important  it is to use Frank’s sauce. I had never used it before, but realized that it was a main ingredient in some of the best  wings I’ve had! I’ll definitely make this recipe many more times, and you should too.

I have been making these for 10 yrs. Love how simple but delicious they are. I use drumsticks instead of wings. We call them Yummie Drummies. Now my daughter makes them too. New family hand-me-down. And always with Bleu Chz!Thank you to whoever’s recipe this is.

I used the cooking method but did not use the sauce.  Simply coated with olive oil, salt and pepper and baked so everyone could coat as they liked.  So simple and tasty, will be using this method from now on!

These turned out great! Ran out of propane and then did in the oven like another reviewer had to do. 400 degrees F. for 40 min. Will make again for super bowl. Thanks for the recipe!

I only marinated the chicken wings for 2 hours but there was ample flavor. Plus if you're going to toss them in a hot sauce or buffalo sauce at the end, the flavor already goes a long way. Super easy, super simple. Love the recipe!

Absolutely yummy!!! A bit salty, so next time I will try low sodium Soy sauce.  I also didn’t have any hot sauce on and, so I didn’t make the finishing sauce and they still tasted great!!  We will make these again!  Oh also did 15 minutes on the grill and finished them in the oven- perfect!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Cooked at 400 F but they cooked little too much. I would probably lower temp next time but they were a big hit for everyone.

Baked at 400 degrees for 40 minutes. Wings were super juicy and moist. Although  not the best wings I have made from this site, they were pretty darn good.

I first tried these about a year ago and they have since become a staple in my household. We do these wings several times throughout summer. So glad to have found this. I definitely recommend using a charcoal grill for these, makes the flavor unbelievable. 5 stars all day, baby!

I love Frank's RedHot sauce on everything. i added 1/4 cup to the dressing and soy sauce and increased the amount in the basting sauce to 1/2 cup., 
It is an easy and fantastic recipe.

Delicious!! The only changes I made was after marinating them for 4 hours I fried them in my Air Fryer for 15 minutes one tray at a time and I skipped the sauce. They were wonderful without it. Will be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this recipe as an appetizer for my annual Christmas feasts for the last several years and they are always a smash hit. By far the tastiest wings recipe I have ever come across. I recommend using a very basic Italian salad dressing and a minimum ¼ cup of Franks hot sauce. Thanks for sharing.

So.... we tried these today. Absolutely amazing! Didn’t change a thing. Making them on the grill, we were a little skeptical (we are used to frying them), but the flavor and crispness was to die for!! I suggest that when you make them, DO NOT alter the recipe! We marinated the wings overnight.

I didn't marinade as long as suggested as I started late.  I only marinaded for about an hour.  I didn't make the finishing buffalo sauce and everyone still enjoyed and raved about the wings.  Will definitely make again!

Fabulous recipe.  My family commented that they were the best wings ever.  I cooked them on the grill over indirect heat for the first 20 minutes and then used direct heat on a low flame.  My only suggestion would be to use low-sodium soy sauce.

Followed the recipe exactly.  They were good.  Had some at first without the hot sauce and they were flavorful. Husband thought they were really great.   Added the hot sauce, hoping to like them more, but imho a bit of sweetness would have done it. Still very good, just not what I was hoping for.

I love hot sauce but no one else in the family does so I left that out. Don't have a grill so I  broiled them in the oven. My 86 year old mother who doesn't really like chicken Loved them and wants them again. They were great and we will be making them again, soon!

Made NO changes--well, except that due to time constraints, ending up marinating the wings for 48 hours instead of overnight.  Excellent as is, and SO easy to make.

Cooked 7 lbs. for family dinner and they were a big hit. I used the hot sauce on about 1/3 and a mild sauce for the rest. I have to appease the timid and the kids. Only difference was I drained them in a large colander. Great!!

I marinated these wings for about 24 hours, added a little garlic and black pepper to the wing sauce right before I tossed in the grilled wings. Very good, hubby ate a bunch and kept saying "ok, just ONE more".

Look, I made this recipe. I went through the steps and really wanted to enjoy them. They are entirely too salty. Look at the ingredients. Look how much salt is in this. I appreciate the original poster but for me personally. They tasted like a salt lick. Thanks anyways.

Excellent flavor.  My husband and my daughter  said they were the best wings they have ever had.  They were just a tad too salty for me.  Next time I make them, I will use low sodium soy sauce.  Otherwise, great recipe.

Make these for our fishing trip every year and it's a staple. I'm huge on flavor so marinating overnight is a must. I even mix up the wings in the bag after several hours. 
Suggestions: Add fresh crushed garlic and crushed red pepper flakes to the marinade mix. Don't get the cheap Italian dressing. I prefer the olive garden brand. Add 1 tablespoon of honey and about 1 tablespoon of brown sugar to the sauce mix.

Was in a rush so I mixed the hot sauce with the marinade and skipped the butter/hot sauce basting step. Flavor was still excellent and I will make again soon.

This is the first time we’ve grilled wings. They were really good! The only thing I did differently was to use creamy Italian dressing instead of regular Italian because that’s what I had on hand. I absolutely loved the taste of the butter/hot sauce/soy sauce mixture.

Loved the marinade.  I put the whole wings in a gallon bag and marinade overnight. My husband grilled them whole.  So juicy and flavorful! We're making them again tomorrow.

I added a little teriyaki sauce, onion powder and 2 diced garlic cloves to the marinating sauce. Very tasty.

This was delicious, easy to make with minimal ingredients. My family loved the wings, not one left over, the only thing they said was they wish I had made more. Thanks will make these again!!

OMG! My wife is not a wing person and she raved! Very important to oil your grill on high before making these. Constantly rotate the wings while on medium or else they get charred very fast. This sauce should not be adjusted - true tangy finger licking hot sauce. Going to make these again next week!

My wife and I love hot wings. We made these tonight and they were fabulous!  I used more Frank's than recipe called for because I like wings extra wet. But otherwise stuck to the recipe. Excellent recipe.

I didn't enjoy this recipe as much as the others. I thought it lacked a depth of flavors. The soy sauce was the only flavor I tasted. The butter and hot sauce was good to bring a hot wing flare but it wasn't enough for me to give it a good rating.

These wings turned out great! Normally I would add a little bit of this or little bit of that. I'm always skeptical of how folks season the recipes. I can tell you that I didn't add anything extra and these turned out fantastic! I did them on the grill so that enhanced the flavor. We definitely make these again.

This recipe is amazing! !!  I marinated the wings for 24 hours then I baked them on 300 for 30 minutes, turning once.  Then I tossed them in the hotsauce and grilled them. I got so many genuine compliments!

These were yummy and easy.  We don't love spice, so I used barbecue sauce in place of the hot sauce.  They turned out wonderfully.

I love grilling chicken wings marinated many different ways. I like the idea of the salad dressing and hot sauce. Use a sodium reduced soy sauce.

Since we found this recipe last year, our tailgate at the University of Alabama Football games has doubled in size! Low and slow on a charcoal grill, with or without the sauce it is amazing! We have used it with wings, drumsticks, and thighs and they turn out perfect every time. Love it!!!

These were so so so so delicious.  I am not a wings fan but these were scrumptious.  I did not change a thing in the recipe.  Marinated for the full 24 hours.  My boyfriend said that they were the best wings he has ever had and he eats wings at many different establishments.  The marinade definitely made them as good as they were but the sauce on top was even better.  Will be making this during football season for sure!

These turned out great! I marinated the chicken overnight, and after grilling, coated half with the buffalo sauce and half with bbq sauce. I put them on cookie sheets in a 400 degree oven for a few minutes to bake the sauce in a little, which is just our preference. I'll definitely make these again!

This is a really yummy chicken wing.  The soy sauce added to the hot sauce gives it a little different flavor than your traditional buffalo wing.  To lighten up the calories, I use Frank's Buffalo sauce, instead of the butter with hotsauce.  Just add the buffalo sauce to the soy, and slop it on.  Zero calories in the sauce when you omit the butter.  I've even done the wings with no skin, and it's still very tasty.

Best grilled wings ever! Everyone thinks I'm a grilling champ, but I just use this recipe, haha. I don't think the amount of butter is necessary, I use less and it works just fine for me--butter here is a matter of preference. Yum!

Amazing. Was worried would be too spicy for mom and the 8 yo but it was perfect. Biggest problem? We are going to need a bigger grill!

These chicken wings were delicious!  Don't bother cutting up the wings, save time.  I baked them in the oven at 400F for 40 minutes. I'll be making them again!  Might cut down on the butter next time.

These were awesome! I am not really a chicken wing fan, and even I think they were 5-star! My hubby and daughter who love chicken wings loved these too! All around a great solid recipe. Only thing I did was reduce the amount of marinade slightly (1/3 C each soy/Italian dressing) to make sure I didn't use all of my soy sauce. Will definitely be making these again!! Someone commented on thinking they were salty. I used unsalted butter, maybe that makes difference?

I use low sodium soy sauce and it is still a bit salty but delicious non the less. It is now my go to for wings. Sure beats deep frying them from a health prospective. And I really don't even need a sauce. Just make sure you get the skin good and crisp.

I made this recipe to have more to grill for the holiday. I also wanted to try something new. Well there was too much food for me to Grill the chicken  so I did marinate  it the night before with the soy sauce and dressing . The next day I decided to  bake the chicken I marinated. I didn't get to the dipping sauce that  was part of the recipe , but I must say the flavor of the marinade  was amazing. The chicken was juicy and very tasty, I can't wait to taste the full recipe.

These are wonderful. Just the right amount of spicy. I added just a touch of sesame oil to the finishing sauce and finished them with some fresh cilantro out of the garden.  this is my new go to recipe.

These were GREAT!!!  I used honey instead of hot sauce as recommended in one of the reviews. So yummy!!  I'll definitely make these again. And again. And again.  May even give the hot sauce a try. ;)

Made the sauce but put it on grilled chicken breasts because I didn't feel like running to the store to get wings. The sauce was so good. Will make with chicken wings next.

This chicken was so yummy... I actually doubled it and made 6 pounds, also I used thighs and legs. It was a very delicious and sutle flavor, I love that it wasn't super busy, it was just perfect!

Awesome and easy....I usually marinade the night before in a ziploc bag and take them in the marinade/bag to the boat the next day.  Everyone loves them and super easy to cook on boat grill.  I make ranch dressing and wing sauce to dip in if anyone wants, but the flavor alone is great.

Wow.....incredible.  I did 4 dozen (five pounds) and doubled everything.  We like our wings well done, so I grilled over medium low heat for about an hour turning frequently.  I also hit them with some smoky seasoned salt while grilling.  I went with about half of the hot sauce because I don't like super spicy and it was perfect.  These were the best wings I've ever had anywhere.

Made this recipe twice and came out great both times.  The second time, I baked in the oven at 400 for 30 minutes, and then finished off on the gas grill for 7 minutes on each side to get those nice grill lines!

I have used it both exactly as planned and with additions. The big deal on using any marinade when grilling is to use a rotisserie. One, you can "set it and forget it" and not have to worry about burning the marinade. Two, you can spend your time watching the game and visiting with your guests. 
Using the Rotisserie Master add on spit kits, I have cooked 64 large wings at one time with additional space to spare. 
I have also added rub herbs, a pinch of brown sugar and Worcestershire to add a special tange to the marinate.

Made & shared with neighbors.  Enjoyed by all.  Not very spicy, although my hot sauce was fairly old.  Very flavorful though.  Will make again.

These were a HIT! Followed recipe exactly & LOVED it! Everyone raved about them. Almost didn't get a chance to toss them in the sauce...everyone was eating them hot off the grill! The flavor was AWESOME! Making more today!

I added honey to the final sauce. I used good seasons zesty Italian dressing,  marinade for 8 hours, and everyone loved them. I added the honey because I wanted a sweet and spicy grilled flavor and this is it. Football game day tradition is now in place.  Thanks

Fantastic.    Did do the buffalo toss at the end.   I used a mixture of hienz 57, franks BBQ and sweet baby rays and glazed them at the end.   Not a single piece of chicken left.   I marinated for 4 hour.  Chicken was tender and delicious.

I have tried this recipe twice. ..first time I followed the recipe and they were great.   I like my wings dry ,also, so the next time I skipped the hot sauce and just sprinkled Tony's Cajun spice on the wings when I put them on the grill.

These are so simple and tasted amazing.  You could just use Frank's Red Hot Buffalo sauce to dip them in after instead of making the sauce here.  Either way, delish!!

These were wonderful! Crunchy on the outside yet moist and fall off the bone. I followed others advice to bake at 400 for 45 min. It's my first attempt at making my own wings, so much better and healthier!

This is my favorite way to prepare wings! So flavorful and tender! The skin caramelizes beautifully on the grill giving so much flavor and crispy skin. Don't change a thing....incredible as is. I cooked mine for 15 minutes on a charcoal grill over direct heat (turning constantly) until I got them nice and crisp and then moved to indirect heat for the last 15 minutes. They were perfect! Such an interesting combination of ingredients but it really works!

I was surprised by these.  I didn't expect them to have as much flavor as they ended up having.  We marinated large drumsticks overnight and grilled them the next night for 4th of July.  These were packed with flavor and so easy! I would definitely recommend!

I make these often and love them. The recipe as written is perfect, but, as with all chicken, I cut the skin off the wings with kitchen shears before marinating. Kind of a pain, but grilled chicken skin is ... well, grilled chicken skin. Yuck.

I've made this recipe many times and we love it just like it is, however, I love to grill in the summer time and try to watch the carbs so I omitted the oil and flour, grilled the wings and then tossed with the sauce. Still amazing!

I was skeptical because of the soy sauce and Italian dressing combo, but I followed the recipe exactly (using Ken's Lite Northern Italian with Basil and Romano dressing) and couldn't be more pleased!!!!  Delicious and easy!   My family is brainstorming ways we can do this for other chicken parts so we can eat this more often.  You will not be disappointed if you make these - except when they disappear before your eyes!

We all loved this!  Most amazing wings-great flavor and easy to make. Bravo!  Only change-we tossed a small portion of the wings with a BBQ sauce for the little ones that do not like spicy.

These were great. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Marinated in the fridge for about 4 hours or so. I only put the sauce on half the wings, but either way, they were delicious. Will definitely be keeping this recipe to make again.

I used reduced sodium soy, half the hot sauce (not a fan of spicy), and about a tablespoonful of honey in the tossing sauce. Grilled on green egg for about 30 minutes. Very yummy! Will be sure to make again. Thanks for the recipe!

These were delicious, but way too salty. I'll definitely try them again, but with low-sodium soy sauce and/or eliminate the soy sauce in the sauce. I put some grill marks on them first with my grill pan then finished them off with the sauce in the oven.

I tried this recipe yesterday.  When the wings were grilled on a gas grill, it took 30 minutes on the low flame, my kids ate them without coating them in butter and hot sauce. I omit that last step completely because we eat low sodium and that could add more to the wings. I already used low sodium soy sauce. Looks like I will drench them in hot sauce and will try adding some cayenne pepper to the marinade. Overall I liked the recipe and it is a keeper :-)

Excellent recipe ... I slow cook my wings in the oven on 250 for 8 hrs.  The last hour I uncover and turn up to 300 to carmelize the wings.  Then I toss in the sauce.  Perfect every time.

Killer marinade,I added a dash of cayenne and chili powder to the marinade to kick it up a little, and used Tabasco Smoked Chipotle pepper sauce. I grilled indirectly for 40 minutes then finished directly over the hot grills at the end, 5 minutes a side to get a good char. Amazing flavor, sweet, spicy, savory!! A homerun for sure.

I think it would be better to add the sauce after grilling the wings, but to each his/her own.

This has  become our go-to wing recipe. I prefer it to regular wing sauce. Edited: I made this so much I do like to add garlic and a little hot sauce to the marinade.

All I can say is Boom! Best Drunkard wings ever......if you thought they were to salty just do 3/4 Italian dressing to 1/4 soy problem solved.

Do yourself a favor and make these!  You will love this recipe... super easy and the wings were the hit of the party.  I used a bag of frozen drumettes.  I thawed them and marinated them overnight in a large Ziploc bag, turning several times.  Before grilling, I made the sauce, doubling the recipe.  I fired up the grill to medium heat and threw them on for 20 minutes, turning frequently with tongs.  After 20 minutes on the grill I brought them in, placed them on a foil lined cookie sheet and basted them with some of the additional sauce I made.  I put them in the oven at 325 for 10 minutes, flipping them once at the 5 minute mark.  I took them out, threw them in a bowl with the rest of the sauce and coated them.  I'm telling you... they are awesome and will be made at all future get togethers.

Delicious and super easy!  Used low sodium in the marinade (marinated 4 to 5 hours) and I skipped the soy all together in the sauce.  I didn't think the sauce would be enough but it was plenty (we don't like our wings swimming) and the grill time was perfect.

Because my husband and I both love wings, we try a lot of different recipes for them from this site.  This is  one of the best.  Very good on the grill or in the oven, either way.  The marinade is so easy, and always have the ingredients in  the house, which is a plus. It works really well for other meats on the grill too.  Really yummy!   Being NFL fanatics, this is a Sunday staple around here.  Thank you for posting.

Love these wings and I don't really like wings. I like to marinate the wings for 6-8 hrs. My husband puts them in an aluminum pan along with the marinade on his Big Green Egg and smokes them at 200-250 degrees for 1-2 hrs. He then puts the wings directly on the grill for 25-30 minutes to get a slight char on them. I leave some without the sauce for the kids and they are amazing! I even used the mild Kroger brand sauce and they are unbelievable. This is our new family favorite wing for Auburn football games on Saturday night. I can think of absolutely nothing I would change about this recipe.

This recipe is easy and it's great.  The wings turned out awesome.  My kids loved them and declared them to be better than any restaurant wings that we've had.  We added a little bit less hot sauce and a wee bit more soy sauce, but other than that, we kept it simple.  Also, to the people who don't understand how anyone thinks butter is better on chicken wings...you've obviously never spent any time with a Frenchman, or you'd know that butter makes EVERYTHING better. Oui oui!

Cooked them for about 20 minutes using indirect heat and hickory wood to get some extra smokey flavor then finished them off over the hot coals. Excellent with or without the the sauce.

Amazing! Followed recipe exactly as written except I doubled the sauce recipe as it definitely wasn't enough for 3 lbs of wings (I like saucy wings). These were the best wings I've had in a long time - beats many of the restaurant chain wings out there (and these aren't deep fried!).

If you are like myself and not a big salt user, you may find this recipe is very salty. I am going to substantially reduce the amount of soy sauce the next time. I was only able to marinade for four hours, but found that to be more than enough time for the chicken to take on the flavor.

Really good - tricky to get the sauce to stick to the wings though. The first time I made them I had no problem, but the second time it didn't work out as well - not sure why.

Very good wings on the grill. My teenage son loved it and wants to make it our primary grilled chicken recipe.

Overall, not too hot at all. I marinated the wings overnight and I think that added to the flavor.

Absolute hit with my guys.  We added more hot sauce to the marinade because they like things "hot".  Have shared with recipe with several friends and high raves from all.  Thanks!
