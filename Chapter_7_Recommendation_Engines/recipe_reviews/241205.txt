This is a good change from the normal pico de gallo. I like the sweetness the carrot adds.

Made it as written. Really good flavor and texture. Just looks a bit funny with the carrot in there, but blended with the peppers and stuff is quite delicious. Will make regularly!

It was great like the carrot twist!
