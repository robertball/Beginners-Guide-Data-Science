I love this recipe for it's simplicity.  It's so easy to throw together (in one pot no less) and my guests enjoyed it with their beer.  I threw in some caraway seeds to go with the German theme.  Thanks Herbanspoons

I made this of a Oktoberfest party last year . And it was a big hit. I'll be making this recipe again this Oktoberfest. I make it the day before the party and put it in aluminum pans. Then just heat up the pans in the  oven and pop them over sterno, to keep them warm.  The chicken and cabbage is just as good heated up.

This recipe is surprisingly good!  The chicken wasn't very crispy when all was said and done, but I'm not surprised...I might cook it separately next time.  Other than that, I made the recipe almost exactly as it said, including the cinnamon...the only substitution I had to make was to use apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar b/c I didn't have any when the time came to prepare this.  The other comment I would make about this recipe is that it took longer for me to prepare than the recipe time said.  10 minutes for the bacon, 5 minutes for the apples/onions, 30 minutes for the chicken (I had to fry it in 3 separate batches), 8 minutes for the cabbage to soften, then another 10 minutes for the last step before the oven.  That right there is just over an hour.  Since I was trying to make this before my husband went to work, I turned the oven up to 380 degrees and baked it for 30 minutes...maybe that's why the chicken wasn't super crispy?  Anyway, there's that.  I'll definitely make this again the next time I receive a red cabbage head in my CSA box!

I would definitely make this again!  I would not bread the chicken next time though.  I would just season and cook as directed.  Thighs have enough flavor without the breading.

My wife and I followed the recipe almost exactly, but made just a couple minor changes.  We had a sweeter, spiced red wine open already, so we used that, and then cut back on the brown sugar a little. We also didn't do the cinnamon (the spiced wine actually had some cinnamon in it).  Everything else we did just as written here, and it turned out fantastic. We would make this again in a heartbeat.

Having German heritage this recipe brought back memories of my Grandma's cooking.  The chicken was tender and flavorful and the cabbage provided a sweet and sour compliment.  I included some roasted red potatoes and of course some October fest beer to round out this tasty dinner.

I was a bit skeptical but I really enjoyed this recipe. It was a tiny bit on the sweet side so I might reduce the brown sugar in the future but it was fine as is and I would make it again.

A perfect fall dinner.  The only change we made was adding a couple of pieces of bacon to the mix to simmer with the cabbage, onion, and apple mixture.

Solid, tasty 3.5 star dish. Nothing special. I used 1/2 the brown sugar and even that was a touch on the sweet side.

I made this as written and included the optional cinnamon. It was east to put together and was delicious. What a way to close out the month of October. Thanks for sharing.

My family absolutely loved this.  We had to keep them from piling their plates full!  I used diced turkey breast (what I had leftover), dredged it with the flour mixture and fried briefly till a crispy texture.  Also threw in some thinly sliced carrots and used cooking sherry, balsamic vinegar and Merlot because that's what I had.  Will definitely make this again!

I really liked this. I did change it a little. I used one yellow onion and one red onion and caramelized them to add to the sweetness. After they were caramelized then I added the apples. Then I substituted honey for the brown sugar, white wine instead of red , 1/4 cup of white vinegar instead of 1/2 cup of wine vinegar, turkey bacon instead of bacon, two apples instead of one, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon instead of 1/2 teaspoon. The chicken I used was a whole cut up chicken. I did actually cook the cabbage separately from the chicken and then combined them when finished...that was just because my pan wasn't big enough. It was really really good. My husband and I liked it even more the second day. I will definitely make this again!

Didn't have any apples, so I left that ingredient out and this was delicious!  At my wife's request, I omitted the cinnamon.  The only thing I will do different is either salt and pepper the chicken before the flour coating, or add more salt to the flour mixture.  This is a keeper in our house.

This was really good on a cold day! I kept the chunks of apple large so their flavor didn't get lost and I also added caraway seeds! Thank you for sharing! *I did use the cinnamon

I love purple cabbage fixed this way, and it goes so well with the chicken! If it doesn’t all fit in the pan right away, put the cabbage in in batches and let it cook down a bit before adding more. I even put the lid on for a few minutes to let the steam cook it down faster.

It’s generally very good but needed a little more seasoning for me. My prep time was about ten minutes longer but no big deal.  I also added some cubed potatoes to it and that worked great. Will make again.

This was one of the best homemade dishes I’ve ever had! We used boneless skinless thighs and cooked it in an electric skillet instead of transferring to the oven, so only one dirty dish. So good!

Where to begin?  I'd like to see the frying pan that can hold an onion, an apple, and a head of cabbage, let alone 2 lb of chicken thighs.  If I'd read the recipe through, I would have halved it!  Otherwise, the flavors are really good.  Also, the fat from 4 pieces of bacon doesn't nearly cover the rest of it!

Huge hit in my family! I wish I knew earlier in the day that this was the plan for dinner so I could have prepped better but the flavor it's delicious. We'll definitely make this again!

LOVED this dish! So easy to make, flavorful, relatively healthy and equally good served fresh or as leftovers. The only change I made was I used gluten free flour, and I cut way back on the brown sugar (used 2 tablespoons).

Delicious.  Used sweet onions cause I had no red. Then made it again using red onions. I liked it better with regular onions.

Excellent recipe!  Made it exactly as per recipe and it was amazing.  Chicken was incredibly moist and tender.  Great meal for a cold fall evening.

This was really delicious. I made some thyme roasted potatoes to go along with it and we washed it down with some Pumpkin Spice beer. Great Oktoberfest meal. Will definitely make it again.

Didn’t have “smoked” paprika.  Rest of recipe was followed.  It was a three and  a half hour process with the prep and all.  Chicken was very tasteful cabbage was blah.  Don’t think  I’ ll make this again.

I loved it. Six year old grandson not a fan of the cabbage. Chicken very tender and needed to add salt.

I made this as per the directions with the exception of using cooking chery and distilled white viniger ( it's what I had on hand). It turned out excellent, everyone enjoyed it very much. Will make this again.

Excellent! Can’t wait to make it again. I did skip the cinnamon and due to dietary restrictions cut the sugar in half. Still absolutely delicious.

This was delicious. I used skin-on, bone-on chicken thighs,  I browned the skin side until crisp. I totally recommend that. I also misread the ingredients and didn’t have a red onion, just a yellow and forgot the apple all together. So I used the yellow onion and substituted apple juice for the apple. That worked out great. Over all I will definitely make this meal a regular in my meal rotation.

Will definitely make it again. I did 2 things not asked for. When the onion and apple were in the pan I chopped up a large clove of garlic and chopped in which the garlic no more then a small tsp. Of chopped caraway seed and it simmered. It gave it an awesome taste. 
My mother in law was a prof. Cook so I called her and read the recipe, I asked her what's missing. She said it'should good. I THEN asked her what she thought about the two ing. Above and she agreed.
I also thought a tablespoon of sour cream would be awesome. Thank you for sharing.

this was really good-- I love red cabbage and I think this was my favorite .  I had some slices of cooked bacon already in the fridge, so I used avocado oil instead of the bacon grease , but otherwise, followed the recipe.  I thought it was great.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! I have made it multiple times as written with both chicken thighs ( bone in and boneless) . I made this recently with pork chops ( picture is posted) and it came out UNBELIEVABLY DELICIOUS! I made an Allrecipes recipe “German potato pancakes “ that was posted by Swizzlesticks and it paired up fantastic.

I loved this! Some reviews said it was too sweet but I thought it was perfect. I also did not pack the 1/4 cup with brown sugar. I also used apple juice instead of dry red wine. I will, without a doubt, make this again.

We really liked this dish.  I will make it again but reduce the red wine vinegar a bit.  I didn't add as much brown sugar as suggested in the recipe nor did I include cinnamon.  Served with oven roasted potato, carrots and beets.

A bit too sweet for me.  MY Austrian mil always used 2 or 3 whole cloves or a pinch of ground cloves.  Go easy or will take over.  I prefer it to cinnamon.
