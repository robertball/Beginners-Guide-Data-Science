I’ve made it with fresh tomatoes, and I’ve made it with canned diced tomatoes.  I strongly recommend canned tomatoes, as it makes the sauce soooo much saucier.  

Also, it doesn’t need sugar added.  It’s simply delicious.

Very tasty and easy to prepare. I used a good quality prepared pesto instead of making it from scratch as in the recipe- estimated that it would be a generous 1/2 c. I reduced the amount of chicken to 2 small breasts (actually one whole 2 halves) but kept all other amounts as listed hoping to have excess sauce that i could use the next night in another dish. While the sauce was delicious we found it to be a bit skimpy for our tastes and if it had been served with something like noodles or rice I d think it would not be sufficient. Next time I d double all the sauce ingredients.

Indeed this recipe has possibilities for a wonderful meal. I think that I had problems with the chicken I chose because it didn't brown up as well as I'd have liked. I did use a little butter along with the oil to brown it. I felt initially that the sauce wasn't going to produce enough liquid to make a sauce or topping but it did come together. I would have seasoned the chicken in the beginning more and that is an easily rectified situation. We thought our dinner was very tasty and would make this again. Thank you very much!
