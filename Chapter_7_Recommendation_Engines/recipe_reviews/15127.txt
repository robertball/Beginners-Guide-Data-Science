This was surprisingly good even though I made some changes (mistakes?).  I didn't have cheddar cheese soup so I heated up some cream of mushroom in the same pan I used to brown the chicken and melted in some of the cheddar cheese.  I also misread the recipe and layered the cheese, then the bread crumbs and bacon and baked at 400.  The chicken was perfectly browned and crunchy.  Initially, I only thought to make an OK dinner, but this turned out much, much better than expected.

I didnt care much for this dish. My husband loves green beans and cheesy food but he thought it was just ok. I wont make this again. Too much prep time for the end result. My breadcrumbs didnt get soggy, but the whole thing just didnt live up to my expectations.

Pretty good!  I made some changes because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, and happily enough, those changes made it healthier!  First, I didn't have any bacon so I fried some shaved, diced ham and that was just like bacon except a lot less fattening.  Also, I used a mix of frozen green beans and broccoli because I didn't have 20 ounces of either, and I also used rice.  I mixed about two cups of cooked rice with about half a cup of the cheddar soup and spread it in the bottom of the baking dish, covered it with the veggies (I think I used more than 20 ounces), then put the chicken and ham and soup over it.  I used two cans of the soup for it and am glad I did!  And I used a lot more than a pinch of cayenne pepper and sprinkled salt on everything.  For the bread crumbs, I just sprinkled a handful of Italian bread crumbs over top.  I didn't have any cheese.  I think I'll make all of these changes the next time (the bacon and cheese really weren't missed), except I'll mix some milk into the soup so it's not as translucent and isn't as thick.  I think I'll also skip the bread crumbs or sprinkle them on before I pour on the soup.  And finally, next time I won't cook it under the broiler because the bread crumbs got too dark in places after just a couple minutes.  Just bake it like a normal casserole :o)  With these changes, I think it will be a five!

We really liked this recipe, but made it with some modifications. Supermarkets here don't carry cream of cheddar soup and Canned soup's too salty for us anyway, so I made a white sauce and added some good New York State cheddar to it to create my cheese sauce. I added additional water to the sauce since other reviews here indicated the dish could be a little dry, a little more cayenne as we like a bit more spice, and some poultry seasoning to add even more flavor. Turned out great!

I gotta say, I didn't love this recipe. It was just too much, but not enough flavor. I sauteed the chicken with garlic and pepper, which helped, but the cheddar cheese soup was just too bland. I think cream of mushroom would be better. Also, I don't think the breadcrumbs were all that necessary. They didn't add much to dish at all. The bacon was nice, but wasn't enough to help this recipe. Thanks, but I don't think I'll make this again.

This was very good.  I did change this up just a little bit.  I didn't crumble the bacon, instead cut in half and placed on top of the chicken.  I also added just a little bit of onion to the green beans while cooking.  Hubby loves cheese and thought this was good.  I do agree that the chicken needs some flavoring before frying up...but still good.  Thanks for the post.

I added brown rice which turned this into a complete meal in one casserole.  I pre-cooked the brown rice and made it into a bottom layer. My other changes were cutting the chicken into serving size portions for each family member then just laying 2-3 strips of that pre-cooked bacon over each one.  I decided not to use bread crumbs cuz it seemed like there was enough going on in that pan already!! Came out delish.  Even the leftovers were yummy.

Very tasty...However, next time (and there will be a next time!) I will add an extra can of soup and some milk so it is creamier.  It was quite good tho!

each of the ingredients appeals to me, but when combined, it's not really that appetizing, once you take a bite.  Family liked it somewhat.  Don't think I'll make it again.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have cayenne so I added onion powder and paprika to the top.  I also didn't have cream of cheddar soup so I used cream of chicken (healthy request = less salt) and I added almost a whole can of milk.  It was really good and I will definitely make it again.  It isn't as easy as some one dish recipes but it doesn't take too long either!  Perfect week night meal!

I really loved the crispy cheese on top with bacon. I wasn't as big of a fan of the cheddar soup component. It needed more flavor and substance. This seems like good hearty country eats but not a recipe to return to that often.

I made some modifications as noted by other reviews.  I used more liquid. I mixed the can of cheese soup with a can of cream of chicken.  That turned out good.  I also added more spices to the entire dish and the chicken before I fried it.  My only suggestion to myself for next time would be to cook the beans less before baking in the oven, as these turned out a little mushy.  Great recipe idea!

I made this for my parents since my mom had surgery. I used the make ahead directions, but my dad would have liked the green beans less crunchy. I didn't use the soup and made my own cheese sauce (something like mother-in-law's cheese sauce from this site but used mozz shredded chz instead). Instead of the seasoning called for I used basil and garlic. I also used turkey bacon and seasoned the chicken as I was cooking it w/ garlic and basil.

It was tastier than expected - but the chicken could use some seasonings before plopping them in the casserole to bake. Otherwise overall is was pretty good. This does not re-heat well AT ALL.

We all liked this so much it will be Sunday dinner once in a while. I used chicken with bone and skin, I seasoned the meat with salt and pepper,and cooked it in the same skillet I made the bacon. I used frenches fried onion rings on top of the green beans instead of bread crumbs. I used a half of the soup can of milk to loosen the soup a little. So much flavor and the meat was juicy and tender.

This was actually quite good for an everyday meal. I did not include the cayenne (it doesn't say where to use it, and I'm not a fan anyway. I used only three strips of bacon to reduce the fat, which still worked well flavor-wise. I also baked the chicken instead of sauteing it, as baking or poaching is the only way I can keep chicken from being too dry. The only other recommendations I would make is to heat the cheese soup separately, as the broil time is not sufficient to heat it, and to buy Trader Joe's frozen French green beans if you can. It makes it so much easier to make this as a "pantry" dish if you have frozen green beans, frozen chicken, and a couple cans of cheese soup on hand for a last minute-meal!

I didn't like the Cheddar cheese soup. With all of the fresh ingredients that canned soup tasted canned and stale, definitely NOT the trick. The chicken and cheese and bacon were WONDERFUL together and this would have been MOST excellent with some Hollandaise sauce instead of the cheddar soup. Next time, green beans on the side, too!

This is actually pretty good. I was a little doubtful, but we really liked it. And it was pretty easy. I would really suggest seasoning the chicken before or as you are cooking it. I did this, and I don't think it would have had much flavor beyond the cheese and bacon if I hadn't. Another thing I may try next time is actually cooking it as a casserole. Maybe not even cooking the chicken before, and just cooking it on lower heat for longer. If I do that I may season the cheddar soup with something. Anyway, it was good.

This was just OK.  The cheese was hard and it was pretty dry.  I would probably use Velvetta if I made it again.  It is also VERY unhealthy (bacon, 2 cups of cheese, cheese soup) and not really worth all of the calories.

This is yummy!  Wasn't sure that I got the right soup, though.  The closest thing my supermarket had was Campbell's Cheddar Cheese (no mention of "cream of" or "soup" on the label.  Was still good, though.

I have made this twice.  My family loves it.  I made my own cheese sauce because I didn't have the soup on hand and made it ahead of time, which was great.  I served it with basmati rice and salad.

Sorry, can't give this much in the keepers department, its okay, quick and easy and a way to get kids to eat veggies but I probably wouldn't make it again for myself.

To reduce fat, use a low-fat cheese sauce in place of the cheddar cheese (w/ butter, flour, milk, and cheese). Double it if you would like it really moist. Use low-fat cheddar cheese or only half of the cheese, and half of the bacon. Wonderful.

Ce poulet est notre favorites. Nous étions un hesitant de morceau au début, mais il est le meilleur! Apprécier! (This chicken is our favorites. We were a bit hesitant at first, but it is the best! Enjoy!)

I give a three only for taste. The recipe itself is vague as it does not state Low or Hi broil (electric ovens) and the mention of Cayenne Pepper in the recipe but the application is not documented.  I suggest blanching the green beans of up to 8 minutes and put the bread crumbs on top, otherwise, everything slides off. throw some melted butter on top of the bread crumbs.

I thought this was really good. I too made some changes though.
I substituted boneless skinless chicken thighs for the breast and used cream of mushroom soup that I thinned with half a can of milk.
I also combined the bread crumbs and cheese before topping the dish with them. Then I baked it in a 350 oven for 25 minutes.
My wife and son thought it was very tasty.
Definitely will make it again.

I found this when I searched for a way to use my fresh garden green beans.  We really liked this!  I followed the advice of cooking the chicken in the same pan after the bacon was done, and it did flavor it nicely.  I will be making this more often!  Thanks for posting it, Marilyn!

My whole family enjoyed this.  I made it extra good by sauteing the chicken in the bacon drippings.  Yum!  I also made it up ahead and just had it in the fridge.  That worked great.

Not good. The flavors did not seem to go together and it was a bit dry.

did NOT turn out well
breadcrumbs apeared to be in the wrong place. Directions not clear if you did not refigerate.
Do not recomend this as it is written
I may try it again a month from now with many changes.
