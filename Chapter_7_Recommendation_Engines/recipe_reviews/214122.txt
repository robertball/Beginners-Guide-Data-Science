I have used this recipe for the last 36 years, was given to me at my bridal shower. I omit the juice off the pineapple as it tends to be too sweet. As we are diabetic, I use 1/4 cup brown sugar substitute. Sometimes I add sliced hot dog to it also. I usually get asked to bring this to pot-luck dinners, make it for camping etc. My husband loves it cold.

This was fantastic. We also used crushed pineapple. It was a bit thin. I think it could have used less syrup from the canned pineapple, but it was still great. Even my VERY picky 5 year old liked it. It's also great the next day.

Great, my family loved it.  Easy to make and wonderful to eat.  I made a double recipe and used crushed pineapple for one of the cans.  We think that the flavor is better with the crushed but also like to see the chunks.  Use both.

it was very tasty. my beans were a bit dry tho. I served it over rice to soak up some of the juices. I loved the pineapple in it. it was very easy to make and good enough to make again.

We really enjoyed this meal tonight.  I used fresh pineapple with no pineapple juice and I would consider decreasing the bean juice also.  I put it in a 9x13 for 30 min instead of 45 (hungry kids!) and it was heated through well.  This may also be yummy over some rice or with something starchy...according to my husband.  But I thought it was delicious as is.

I was really disappointed with this recipe.  Even with the unusual combination of ingredients, I had high hopes due to the great reviews.  No one in my family liked this.  But...I think that's because it was very, very sweet.  The best way to describe it is like a sweet and sour chili.

This was an excellent dish to serve for our Hawaiian theme potluck dinner. Everyone enjoyed the taste.  Next time I make this I will use a little less pineapple juice in the casserole. I had to bake it a little longer to soak up the juice.

I wasn't quite sure on the combination of kidney beans with pineapple when I read this but decided to go for it. This was very tasty and not overly sweet, turned out a little like a hawaiian chili. Delicious served over rice.

Everyone loves it... We have it over rice... Only modification I have made is using crushed pineapple instead of chunks it more smooth and incorporated.

This was a yummy dish! I served it with Jasmine rice and Hawaiian dinner rolls. I was a little unsure about the sweetness of the pineapple and the onions and beef but it went together very well. We had leftovers for lunch the next day and it was even better. Next time I will make it the day before and let it marinate together overnight.  Thank you!!

This turned out really delicious for me.  Following the advice of the other reviewers, I drained most of the pineapple juice, though I did leave a little.  The other thing I changed was I subbed out half the ketchup for Frank's Red Hot "Thick" sauce.  I was trying to add some spice, but the end result wasn't really spicy at all. It did however add an AMAZING flavor, so I will definitely make it again (with the hot sauce).  I think bacon would be a great add to this recipes well.

Yummy! I just added 1/2 tsp more dry mustard to cut sweetness, and two completely drained cans kidney beans...consistency perfect for serving over rice, and not too sweet. My family likes it...definitely making again. Daughter said may be good with later melted cheddar cheese too...

Very good, I will make this again. I also did not add the pineapple juice after reading other comments. My husband liked it as well, and he normally does not like fruit mixed in with meat dishes.

I have made this dish and it was really great. the only changes I made was to cut half the juice of the pineapples. next time I will use crushed pineapple. I think it would look more pleasing to the ete that way. the recipe wasn't that sweet probably because we put it over rice. I will definitely make it again.

This is definitely a quick dish to make when the grand kids are coming!    Beyond that, I thought it was fabulous for quick dining with just my hubby and me!  Great taste..keep a can of kidney beans and chunk pineapple in the pantry and you've got an easy meal...

Talk about easy!  Didn't add the pineapple juice (after reading other reviews) and strained the beans and added water instead.  Ran out of tomato sauce (ketchup in Australia) so I used a tin of tomato soup instead.  Left out the sugar as it was sweet enough for my family.  Thanks for posting!

Loved this! I skipped the salt. I sprinkled the corn starch and mustard on the browned beef and mixed it well before I added the liquid mixture. Loved the smell in the house while it was baking; loved the caramelized look when it was cooked; loved the flavour over rice! Definitely making this one again!

Ok so I made a whole lot of changes. First, I used chicken breast, not beef. Then I used Apple sauce instead of brown sugar. I used crushed tomato in place of the ketchup. I didn't have any beans, didn't need them! I used crushed pineapple and added my concoction to a slow cooker for 4hrs on HIGH. very tasty! I loved this, and will try it with beef and beans next time. I put my chicken and sauce over rice and really enjoyed it. It's really interchangeable, you could do chicken, turkey, sausage or whatever you like. Thank you so much!!

This is a little sweet, but overall the family was OK with that. I did drain the pineapple (I used crushed), and only added half the amount of ketchup & brown sugar that the recipe called for. Still seemed a little sweet so then added a little regular mustard (besides what recipe called for). Brought down the sweet to an acceptable level.

I added sliced bell pepper for color, and drained and rinsed the beans. I added about a quarter cup of water to the catsup.

love this recipe!! A household favorite!! is always requested by my husband and our friends. we like it sweet so I add a little extra brown sugar to the mixture, and also sprinkle brown sugar all over the top once it is in the casserole dish, this carmelizes on top. so happy to have found this recipe, even better the next day!!!

This was very good. Most of my family liked it. Due to renal disease I can't have beans so I switched out the beans for chopped cabbage. Worked beautifuly! I did omit the added sugar but used all the pineapple juice. Sweet, but not too much so. Try it with soy sauce!

This casserole has such a unique and wonderful flavor. I used dark and light kidney beans for more color, ground turkey instead of beef, and quinoa instead of rice. Left everything else the same - my 4 year old and I have been VERY happy with the results twice now. I call it "Hawaiian Chili":)

I made this last night and it was amazing! The only changes were I added an extra can of beans, used spicy mustard (didn't have ground on hand) and mixed the whole thing in the same iron skillet I fried the onions and beef in. It was super easy to just pop that into the oven that way.

Even my 4 year old, super picky eater ate it up. It was NOT too sweet at all. It was amazing. We served it over brown rice. I will definitely be making this on a regular basis.
