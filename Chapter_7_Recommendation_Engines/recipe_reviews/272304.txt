Made exactly as written and these were quite impressive. They were extremely tender, super crisp, and not rubbery at all. Definitely the best I've had. There was just one thing wrong and that was the salt. I like salty things but it was too much in here. I'm still giving this 5 stars but I highly recommend reducing the salt by half.
