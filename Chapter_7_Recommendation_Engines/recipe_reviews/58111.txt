Very good! I love feta cheese and scrambled eggs together, but this recipe was a bit heavy on the dried basil....  I cut the recipe in half and added just a bit of milk to the eggs to get them nice and fluffy. I knew just by looking at the recipe that the amount of dried basil would be too much and since I didn't want to ruin this I used a bit of fresh basil instead. I scrambled the eggs a bit then added the rest of the ingredients vs. mixing everything together. I also added in some cherry tomatoes cut in half and upped the feta a bit. This only needed just a bit of fresh cracked black pepper for seasoning. This was great tucked into some flour tortillas for a breakfast wrap!

These are delicious scrambled eggs.  I made the recipe as directed, but cut it in half for only one serving.  I added a few chopped chives and omitted any salt.  The ham and feta are salty enough.  I also added the feta torward the end of the cooking, so it wouldn't get lost.  Wonderful!

This is an absolutely great twist on conventional scrambled eggs. Vibrant, filling, and popping with flavor. Like many other reviewers have mentioned, cutting back from 1 tablespoon of dry basil to 1 teaspoon helps to not overpower the dish with the basil flavor. I also added the feta cheese in later when the egg was on the pan cooking as to not have it lost amidst the egg when it was cooking.

LOVED THIS! I will never be able to eat boring scramblers again. The only change I made was a 1 teaspoon i/o tablespoon of the basil. Simple, amazing...Thanks!

I left out the ham, as I'm vegetarian, and also used fresh basil, as it was what I had available. I thought this was really delicious, even without one of the main ingredients! The fresh basil was great, and I would now only try it with dried basil if I didn't have any fresh available. Really quick, easy and tasty!

WOW what an easy, quick and flavorful recipe.  I have made this over and over.  It has become a family favorite for breakfast.  The only change I have made is to use three eggs, discarding 2 of the  yolks so there are three egg whites and only one yolk, this brings down the fat and helps with our lower fat and carb diet.   Try adding a tablespoon of chopped fresh mushrooms, perfect addition to this recipe

Though I like all the flavors this has to offer it was just average for me.  I'd rather make an omelet with these ingredients so the tastes are recognized better.  Scrambling did nothing for this dish.  Despite my review, we ate every single bite.

I cut back on the basil and it was still too much and we normally enjoy basil.  I doubt I will make this recipe again but if I did I would use 1 tsp dried basil.

i just made these eggs for my hubby and he loved them. we slightly altered the ingredients to a few dashes of basil instead of the 1 tablespoon. it would have been overpowering. with the few dashes of basil it was fantastic :)

I tried this recipe with only one variation- turkey sandwich meat in place of ham, as that's what I had on hand- and it was delicious!  As others said put the feta in at the end in order to keep it from getting lost.  Delicious way to make scrambled eggs!

This is a great recipe. I'll give it a rare (for me) 5-star rating. Not that it's the best thing in the world, and I might give it only 4 stars for taste per se, but because it's so quick and easy to make, the whole recipe deserves 5 stars. I made it exactly as written, using a little sea salt and some freshly ground black pepper (I had some whole peppercorns on hand). I thought that 1 1/2 teaspoons of butter (i.e., 1/2 T.) was an unusual amount, but I measured it out and it indeed seemed to be the amount needed. I've already told a friend about this, and plan to make another batch tomorrow. It makes a decent-sized breakfast for one person (not a huge amount). Thanks!

Excellent eggs! These were very moist and full of flavor. No salt needed to give these some taste. I loved this dish. Thanks!

This was very good.  I added turkey sausage instead of the ham and used egg substitute.  Instead of a tablespoon of basil, I used a teaspoon.  I never thought of adding basil to my eggs...what a delicious change!  The flavor of the basil went well with the feta cheese.

I followed this recipe to the letter with the exception of using Black Forest Ham shavings as I had none diced. Regardless, it tasted amazing!

I made these the other day and they were simple and delicious. I cut back to I think a teaspoon of basil like others and it was just the right amount for me. I'm definitely making these every time I have leftover feta. =D Thanks!

Only changes for me: 1T fresh basil instead of dried, and lots of added black pepper. I thought the taste was incredible, and only wish I'd added more basil! I heeded the advice of others to use less basil (it would have taken 3T fresh basil to equal 1T dried basil), but I guess I like basil so much I would have preferred more, as per the original recipe. I served it with a sliced apple, which was a great accompaniment.

I must have done something wrong. This sounded so good, but none of us cared much for it. I pecten more of a savory flavor, but it wasn't quite there.

I loved these eggs.  I used canadian bacon inplace of the ham. Never want plain scrambled eggs again. Thanks
