This is a very good recipe. I added one more flavor packet and replaced the water with chicken broth. It goes well with potatoes, and next time I'm going to try it with rice.

It could use just a little more taste. I may try some garlic salt. also next time, I will use a green pepper and a red pepper. The two red peppers cost more than the meat.

Very delicious. Tweeked the recipe a bit. I added green peppers and a bit more salt and pepper to the beef. I also skipped the oregano.

With just a tweet or two this recipe turned out great! We use 4 flavor packets instead of 2, chicken broth instead of water (if it's on hand) and combine red/yellow peppers for some color.  been making this for years and just recently we started marinating the meat

Needs more flavor. Didn't stop my boys from devouring. We ate it like a fajita on soft tortilla with cheese and sour cream. Delish!
