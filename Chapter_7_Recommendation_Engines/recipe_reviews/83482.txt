This sounds really strange, but it was very, very good and very refreshing. I used a mix of baby greens with fresh herbs for the lettuce portion of the salad. The combination of the shrimp (I grilled them) and the mild sweetness of the blueberries was surprisingly good. I did think the dressing had too much mint and next time I'll only use a small amount. I will also add some finely minced onion to the dressing and possibly some capers. This dish was a great surprise!

Oh YUM!  This was SO good! I had some purple cabbage and added that, along with a few strawberries on each plate.  I did include the sugar in the dressing because my husband prefers a sweeter dressing, and it was fine.  I will definately make this again, it is an ideal summer meal!

My husband was convinced that this recipe was too weird and that it would be bad -- he doesn't even like avacadoes, especially with the fruit.  So he honestly seemed confused when it was absolutely delicious and he gave it a 5 star rating.  Grilling the pineapple really brings out the sweetness and all the flavors fit together in a very elegant way.  I also cut back on the mint and didn't add the extra sugar to the dressing (thought it was sweet enough).
