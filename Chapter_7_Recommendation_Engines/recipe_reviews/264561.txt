There's an old saying that in Scotland, oats feed the populace, and in England, oats feed the horses—and there are no better specimens of each than in those places.So I've been trying to feed us oatmeal, but never until this recipe have I actually enjoyed it!

These are delectable. I didn't have cream, so I used buttermilk and omitted the lemon, and it was perfect. And (I blush to admit this but oh well) I used a packet of apple cinnamon muffin mix in place of the flour. So yeah, these were pretty incredible. 

I tripled the recipe last night, and it was great for our big family. I've already got another bowl in the fridge for more tomorrow! Thanks for another winner, Chef John! :)

I made these as soon as the video tutorial was posted on YouTube. I made the mixture in the morning and stored it in the fridge until dinner time. The lemon-y zing is what makes these special. They taste even better the next day, in my opinion!

I made a double batch and let the batter sit over night. They are very good and very filling. I didn’t measure how much lemon zest and juice I put in as I enjoy lemon so I may have put more in than recommended but they were delicious.

I love this! I've made it several times and I love the texture and the hint of lemon. I'd rather have these than pancakes any day.

Made the oat mixture at night and then fried them up in the morning for a quick breakfast. I'm new to cooking and this was super easy and delicious. Officially added to the breakfast rotation.

I altered the recipe by. adding small diced apples, cinnamon and vanilla to the cream and oats while they cook and left out the lemon. it tastes a little like apple fritters when done.

These oatcakes are worth the wait! They are a hit in my household & I will make them regularly. The texture is soft, but it has more body than a pancake & is more satisfying. I got 5 cakes out of this recipe, so one may consider doubling for a larger family. The only change I made was not melting the butter, but rather using it as needed.

Yum.  Used half & half instead of cream.  Mixed oats with the half&half and left in refrigerator until next day.  Then added the rest of ingredients and fried in two batches using 1/2 of the butter for each.    Popped the leftovers in the toaster the next day to reheat for a easy hearty breakfast.   The Lemon really pops some awaking flavor!    Thanks for the inspiration!

I can’t wait to make these oat cakes. I think these would be great to make and wrap a warm one or two in a paper towel and hand it to your child or spouse as they walk out the door in the morning, I’d probably sweeten them a bit more in that case.  Actually I’d probably add fresh grated apple and finely chopped walnuts to the micas it cooks the minuteThats just me .But they look and sound scrumptious

Love the idea of this, but (cringe) I did change significantly based on other reviews and my own wishes.  I substituted blueberry muffin mix for the flour, egg nog (that time of the year) for the cream, skipped the lemon juice and rind in favor of vanilla, and no honey needed since I used blueberry muffin mix and egg nog.  Again, because of my substitutions, we didn't need to use syrup, just picked them up and ate them - loved them.
