Absolutely delicious! My prep time was definitely more than 30 minutes, even with my daughter's help (although probably due to my substitutions), but well worth the effort.  I used part sweet, part hot turkey sausage, lots of minced fresh garlic cooked with the sausage & onion, fresh mushrooms (added with zucchini & tomatoes).  I used brown rice, doubled the amount as per others' suggestions, and lots more than a pinch of oregano. I also followed another reviewer's suggestion to remove the mixture with a slotted spoon and allow the liquid to reduce. Per my family's tastes, I used a mixture of shredded parmesan and mozzarella in place of the processed cheese, then topped with more shredded mozz.  Only needed about 30 to 40 minutes in the oven.  Everyone raved!  Thanks Mandy!

We loved this recipe! Made some adjustments though. Used old cheddar intead of processed cheese and hot italian sausage for a little kick. We actually prepared it in advance and froze it for a quick weeknight dinner. Worked well enough. Will definately make again!

My neighbor brought me a huge zucchini. I made this recipe, and what a feast! The taste is delicious. It takes a little time to make, but I think it's worth it.

I didn't want to try this recipe, but I had all the ingredents on hand.  I followed some suggestions, also posted here, like using a spicy Italian sausage instead of using plain, and added other herbs, garlic, salt and pepper.  I found the recipies was too big for my pan, by the time I needed to add the rice, cheese and mushrooms, so I used a mixing bowl.  I also recommend using a slotted spoon to remove the zucchini mixture as the zucchini and tomato sweat a lot and reducing the 2 cups of liquid that remained in the pan, until it is about 1/2 cup of beautiful flavour. I also made a breadcrumb topping with just 1/4 cup of cheese added.  This one is a winner!!!!

Update: I no longer eat processed cheese.  Organic cream cheese is a perfect substitute for the processed cheese in this recipe!

Original Review:
This was really good.  I was worried that the processed cheese would be too strong of a taste (I'm not very fond of it), but it just added a creaminess and didn't detract at all.  I was also afraid that 1/2 cup of rice wouldn't be enough, but it was great.

I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe--and coming from me, that really means a lot!

So delicious, it's inspired my husband and I to start planning for a garden! I followed others' advice and increased the rice to one cup. The first time I made this, I accidentally purchased hot italian sausage, which my husband LOVED. I couldn't handle so much spice, so the next time I used medium and it was perfect. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Didn't like it with the tomatos, so I made it again and took them out.  Then it was awesome!  I also don't put it in the oven for more than 35-40 minutes.  All the stuff is cooked already, there's no reason to put it in there for an hour!

This dish is absolutely wonderful!  I used spicy Italian pork sausage, 1 cup of cooked pasta instead of the rice, and sharp cheddar cheese instead of the processed cheese.  So good served with cheddar garlic biscuits and a nice Shiraz.  This one is a keeper!

This was great!  I would add more rice next time though & substitute ground turkey for lower fat.  My husband ate the leftovers with green peas & loved it, so I would add green peas next time too.  Overall, fantastic!

Do not hesitate to turn this into a healthy dish.  I used a box of Morning Star vegetarian sausage patties, whole wheat rotini instead of rice and fat free shredded cheddar cheese instead of cheese goo.  It turned out fabulous.   I also used fresh mushrooms, one fresh tomato and one can diced (to keep enough liquid) and added garlic, lots of oregano, minimal salt cause the sausage has it.  Only cooked it for about 10 minutes since everything was already cooked.  Just needed to melt the cheese on top.  You could even go vegan and make this with soy patties and no cheese or vegan cheese.  It was so versatile, filling and delicious - a definite keeper for the rotation.

Wow!  I made this almost exactly as written, except for the following changes:  I used a combination of Mozzarella and grated Parmesan for the cheese, and a sprinkling of Parmesan on top.  I also added a tsp minced garlic while cooking the sausage and onion.  All I had on hand was minute rice, which worked just fine (I prepared it according to package directions and then added it when it was called for)  I did not increase the rice or decrease the liquid, as some have suggested.  I used a pork sausage labeled "Spicy-Medium" which was just right for us.  I also used an 8oz pkg of fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned.  This was really surprisingly good.  I didn't expect to like it as much as I did.  All but my 8 year old devoured it.  He was having an issue with the zucchini chunks.  My husband suggested that next time I might grate the zucchini so that it would be less conspicuous.  I'll give it a try.  One thing is for sure, I will definitely be making this again and again.  Thanks for such a tasty recipe!!

I was on the fence about this recipe but I had the ingredients on hand so I decided to give it a whirl.  All three of my kids loved it so it gets five stars from me!  I made it with pasta (no rice on hand).  I used fresh mushrooms and two cans of diced tomatoes with basil and garlic.  I didn't have velvetta so I used a cup of Monterrey Jack and a cup of cheddar.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is such a quick and easy recipe and I have most of the ingredients on hand all the time (well, not the zucchini).  I make this up ahead of time, in the morning or even a day or two ahead, then just put it in the oven while preparing the rest of supper.  My family prefers the Italian sausage and I usually use an Italian or Mexican cheese blend.  It is AWESOME!  A tossed salad and some crusty Italian bread - YUM!  
Additional Note: The next time I made this I stuffed several large, long, sweet Italian red peppers with it and baked them in the oven for about 20 to 25 minutes,  topped them shredded mozzarella cheese and baked 5 minutes longer!  OMG!!!  They were AWESOME!!!

This was a wonderful recipe, and it is so easy to experiment with.  The only adjustments i made was adding a chopped italian frying pepper to the onion/sausage/zucchini/tomato combo, and some italian seasoning and parsley.  I also diced up the sauasge before putting it in the oven. We will definately make this again! i think i might stuff this mixture inside an eggplant! Yummmy!

We.Love.This.Casserole!  It just tastes good, period.  I use whole grain brown rice and will use sharp cheddar next time just because I'm not a fan of processed foods when I don't have to use them.  Really though, the ease and taste is so unique and wonderful!

I made this for a family in need. I tried a bit of it before I sent it to them,and then decided that I would make it for our dinner as well. I thought it was an easy one dish meal and will make again.

Excellant dish!  Easy to make.  Only suggestions I would give is less sausage and cheese.  My family loves both but these were a little overpowering to the veggies.  Loved it!

Very nice! I didn't read the reviews beforehand but still ended up doubling the rice (which I would recommend). I also used a mix of pork sausage and beef chipotle sausage, as that was what I found in the store that was organic - it gave a nice more varied flavour. 

I also used more and fresh mushrooms, which I'd also recommend, and I don't even know what processed cheese food is, but it doesn't sound like something I'd want to get mixed up in (no offence). I used shredded gouda, mostly old, which I think also added to the flavour. 

The oregano plays an instrumental part so I wouldn't skimp on it. May try adding some more herbs and garlic next time. All in all it was a really nice dish, that's easy to make a large portion of, so you can eat it for a few days or freeze some for a quick meal during a busy week. Which is always a plus for me, getting home late every evening.

EXCELLENT Recipe.  Came out even better than I thought it would...but I (of course) made a few changes.  First, I used Italian Sausage instead of regular pork sausage...it gave it a great Mediterranean flavor.  Then instead of diced fresh tomato, I added a can of drained fire roasted tomatoes.  I used 10 oz. of fresh portabella mushrooms instead of canned, and then cooked the meat mixture until most of the liquid had cooked off.  Then I used an Italian blend cheese (mozarella, parmasan, romano, etc.) instead of the processed cheese food, reserving a little to sprinkle on top.  I served it with pita bread and a salad.  OMG was it good!  This is definitely a keeper!  Thank you Mandy!  Mmmmmmmm.....

I make this with whole wheat spiral pasta which adds a nice texture.  This is an excellent recipe for a novice.

This was very good.  I usually don't change recipes I find on here but I did not have some of the ingredients needed.  I used ground turkey in place of the sausage and spanish rice [seasoned with the mix in the box]in place of the white rice. It was amazing!

I didn't really care much for this recipe.  It was ordinary at best.  Not enough rice, and for some reason, the zucchini didn't taste good to me.  I couldn't finish my portion, but my husband ate all of his.  It's probably not the fault of the recipe, it just didn't appeal to me for some reason, even though I generally like all the ingredients.

YUMMY!!  I cubed & used Hillshire Farm ready-to-eat smoked beef sausage (available in luncheon meats section in the store) because it's my husband's favorite & I always have it on hand.  Saved time!  Like another review said, only gently cooked the zukes and they were still tender-crisp perfect when the casserole was done.  Also added a handful of FRESH mushrooms & coarse chopped Vidalia onion, instead.  I also used a full box of  Zatarain's wild & long grain rice not knowing it had seasonings already in it (Oops, in a hurry!) but it turned out GREAT!!  I just omitted both the regular & garlic salts, and just kicked it up a few notches and added about four minced cloves of fresh garlic, instead. Mixed with a variety of cheeses (no Velveeta!!) I had on hand.  Fabulous!  Thanks, will make again!  Even better the next day!  Made a BIG batch!

I am extremly late in reviewing this recipe!  I made it throughout the fall season about once per week!  I always ask my boyfriend to rate new things I cook so I can decide if I should write them in my recipe box and he said this one was a "10"!

I added a lot of extra spices to this recipe, but as a base recipe it was good. I sauteed fresh mushrooms, onions, & garlic in some olive oil for 5 minutes and then added the zucchini and seasonings (italian seasoning, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and some basil). Then I added the sausage (already cooked, leftover from biscuits & gravy), cheese, a drained can of italian stewed tomatoes and rice.  I should have doubled my rice because my mixture turned out a bit soupy so I just served it in a bowl with flatbread. I made it all in one pot and didn't bake it because we were short on time.

Just made this last night! I didn't do everything exactly to measurement, since I cut the recipe in half. I used turkey sausage, and used some shredded Monterrey Jack cheese I had. It turned out pretty yummy! I personally think it would make great breakfast burritos in the morning.

The flavor is GREAT. But I really wish there was some creaminess to it. Something binding it all together better. Any suggestions?

This was really good. I used Italian turkey sausage, both zucchini and yellow squash, garlic, black and crushed red pepper. I used two cups of rice and the entire 16 ounce cook of velveeta. Very creamy and cheesy. Although it was good with turkey sausage next time I will try with the pork sausage.

Used this recipe with the first of the season zucchini and it was terrific!  Changes -- used about 4 links of sweet sausage {casings removed and broken up), 1 can of drained diced tomatoes, about 1 c. of fresh sliced mushrooms and a mix of different cheeses (some cheddar and mozzarella/italian shredded cheeses).  Yum!

My family loved this.  I made a few changes... turkey sausage instead of pork and canned tomatoes (drained) instead of fresh  I also used cooked pasta instead of rice and reduced to cooking time to about 35-40 minutes.  Yummy!  And yes... I used Velvetta and it was so creamy and tasty and I'm not a Velvetta fan!

My family loved this! I made just a few modifications...used brown rice, italian-spiced ground turkey instead of the sausage, and 3/4 cup of reduced fat cheddar.  We're on Weight Watchers so this helped make it a little healthier.

As with many others, I substituted fresh mushrooms, extra amount of sharp cheddar cheese rather than processed, doubled the amount of rice, added a bit of basil, only baked 30 minutes  -  easy to prepare, tasty, nice consistency  -  especially liked being able to prepare in morning & simply pop into oven 1/2 hour before dinner

This was really good, I did change a few things, per other's suggestions. I doubled the rice (and added more water) and used Jasmine rice b/c that's what we had. Used a can of diced tomatoes, added garlic, basil, oregano and shredded cheddar instead of processed cheese. Added some panko w/a couple of squirts of butter spray over the casserole when putting in oven. Baked for 40 minutes then 1& 1/2 minutes on broil to brown top. It was great and my 2 year old niece even loved it as did my the rest of my family.

This was really yummy! I hate to rate it 5 and say I made changes, but I think it would have been good as written too. We don't like canned mushrooms, so I used fresh and I used 2 cups grated cheddar because we don't do processed cheese. It's definitely a keeper no matter if you make it the way it's written or my way! :-) YUM!

So tasty and fresh!  Used about 8 oz fresh mushrooms and added some minced garlic as well.  Threw in some green pepper I had on hand.  Also increased the rice to 1 cup and I used brown rice.  Used some leftover mozzarella melted on top. Delicious!  A new favorite at my house!  Thanks for sharing :)

This was pretty yummy. I didn't change much except doubling the rice and using shredded sharp cheddar. I also used italian seasoning instead of oregano. I undercooked the rice just slightly so that it could soak up any excess moisture from the tomatoes and zuchinni and let it bake in the oven for the full hour. Tasty and filling! Will make again.

Pretty good. One thing I messed up - When the cheese was cubed, 8 oz didn't seem like enough, so I put in 16. Big mistake! 8 oz. would have been perfect, mine tasted too processed and was too cheesy. In an effort to make it healthier, I used Italian turkey sausage, fresh mushrooms and 2% velveeta. I made a topping with quarter cup bread crumbs mixed with some light margarine. Next Time I will use a whole onion and add a couple yellow squashes. Couldn't hurt to have twice the veggies since they cook way down when they are sauteed.

I made this with regular shredded cheddar cheese and added a little jalapeno. This recipe didn't sound appealing but tried it anyway and WOW was it good. My fiance asks for this dish once a month now.

I was hesitant about this recipe...I mean, sausage and zucchini?! :) But it was amazing. I substituted a bit though…used spicy kielbasa and sharp cheddar, per other recommendations. I used only about 2 cups of zucchini (just because that’s all that I had) and added a can of corn after the casserole was finished…delicious! Will make again.

Excellent!!  Really delicious.  I made minor adjustments to the ingredients and methods.  I used the recommended amount of rice, but more would probably also be good.  I used Lundberg's Wild Rice Blend.  Used Italian sausage.  Omitted mushrooms (personal taste).  Used a combination of mozzarella and cheddar/jack.  Sounds good with Velveeta, but I just don't keep Velveeta on hand.  [No offense to the cheese purists, but if you're eating a casserole made of white rice and sausage, I'm sure a little Velveeta wouldn't hurt.]  One suggestion on the methods:  saute the zucchini LIGHTLY, not until tender.  If you saute until tender, and bake for one hour, you will have mushy zucchini.  Already cooked veggies of any variety probably won't take baking for one hour after they are already cooked.  Thanks for the recipe.  I look forward to making this again.

I didn't see the YUM coming!  She's a keeper.  Even my "this isn't real cheese" and "I wasn't expecting much" husband was pleasantly surprised.  I double the rice (and water, duh) per some reviewers and cut the cook time down to 30 minute as dinner was running very late (and I figured everything was cooked anyway) and it was perfect.  I didn't even realize until it was in the oven that it DIDN'T call for Italian sausage and I'm glad I used it -- though that combined with following the suggestions to up the oregano was overkill.  I just barely cooked the zucchini so it wouldn't get too mushy in the oven.  Next I'll try with pasta or orzo.  UPDATE:  The orzo wasn't as good as the rice!

We loved this casserole.  I followed the recipe to the "T", except for using Italian Sausages, cooked and cubed, approx. 4, because I doubled the recipe). I thought the prep time was a bit long, but it usually takes me longer the first time anyway.  Next time I make rice (I used brown), I'll cook up plenty of extra, then freeze for future use in recipes like this. No leftovers at our table. Praise God!

A terrific combination of ingredients, but a recipe that did allow for a little room for changes: I substituted the pork sausage, for boneless pork chops, as the bottom layer of the casserole dish; and as I'm not a fan of processed cheese, I used cubed provolone and Monterey jack, instead, with a little shredded provolone on top. Otherwise it was as is in the recipe, a great way to cook with ingredients from my garden, and a fantastic addition to my recipe box! Thanks!!

This was very good.  The first time I made it with hot italian sausage and it was too spicy.  The second time I made it with regular italian sausage and it was great.  I did use 1 cup of rice per other suggestions.  Also, be careful not to overcook zucchini.  Thanks!

I substituted ground turkey and cheddar and added a sprig of thyme and minced garlic.  Very tasty.  Also used fresh mushrooms tops.  Good dish for garden zucchini.

This was good - I added some banana peppers instead of mushrooms and added some garlic powder. Next time I would add more tomatoes.I also used linked sausage and cut into pcs. , I also added fake (tofu) sausage to it for me....infact this would be good without sausage it would help cut down the saltiness too).  I I will make it again and very it some more with different veggies.

I made several changes after reading the reviews. First, I substituted chicken sausage, added garlic and pepper flakes. I also doubled the rice and used fresh mushrooms. Since I am not a fan of processed cheese, I used 8 oz mild cheddar. My sausage was fully cooked so I decreased the baking time to 40 mins and it was yummy!

Made this a second time, using quinoa and broccoli.  It was fantastic!

This was pretty good.  Added some power greens, garlic and a little red sauce to keep it from being dry.  Also used real cheese, fresh mushrooms, and sprinkled some bread crumbs on top.  Thanks!

This recipe is awesome!  I am not a "squishy" veggie eater - I like my veggies raw for the most part, but I had fresh zucchini given to me and this sounded good.  On the advice of other reviewers, I also substituted out the processed cheese for 2 cups of sharp cheddar cheese and doubled the rice. I also increased the onion and tomato portions to balance the zucchini since I used more than the recipe called for.  I added about 1/4 cup of roasted garlic (I think I will use fresh next time as this did not make a whole lot of difference in taste).  I used fresh mushrooms and Jimmy Dean Breakfast Sausage, Sage flavor.  To top it off, I put a Mexican blend cheese on top with Panko bread crumbs.  There was very little leftover.

My family usually doesn't like my recipes from the internet, but this one was a huge hit !!! I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, added fresh green pepper and garlic to the zucchini, and added shredded cheddar to the velveeta. The only other thing that I did different was use 1 cup of whole grain rice. It is a recipe that we will be making for years to come.

This is a summer favorite.  I use cheddar instead of cheese food, and substitute hot Italian sausage for the pork sausage to give it an extra kick.  I do not use canned mushrooms, but instead add sliced black olives and sliced water chestnuts.  Delicious.

I did have to use a little more rice simply because of all the extra liquid the tomatoes created when cooked ( I used a can of drained rotel).  I used a spicy sausage (which ended up being too hot for the kids) but was great for me and my husband.  My husband isn't a huge fan of zucchini, but he ate this without complaint.

I cooked this for me and my g/f. I didn't have the onion or tomato, so I used salsa and I substituted half the sausage with ground beef, also I used Italian sausage. I doubled the rice portion and we loved it! She said this has become one of her new favs!! I think it would be good with extra zucchini, or even some squash. Thanks so much for the new dish!

A big hit at our house! We will be making this many times over & only a few changes too. Added bell pepper, left out the mushrooms & also stopped cooking about half way through & added about 1/4 cup of heavy cream.

Substituted 1 can black beans for mushrooms, used two kinds of sausage (spicy and sweet), regular shredded mild cheddar and some italian breadcrumbs on to. It was amazing! I actually used a little olive oil to brown the cut up sausage (cut to size as you like, my slices could have been smaller) and I liked having a little extra moisture for it all to bake with (rather than straining it) because it would dry out otherwise by being cooked for 1 hour uncovered.

I loved this recipe.  I skipped the mushrooms and just used grated cheese and canned tomato. I also used an Italian sausage. Kids didn't love it but I did. Will definitely make again with a different dish for the kids.

This is just plain good. Not fancy, but super comforting and delicious. I doubled the rice and used a jar of salsa in lieu of the fresh tomatoes. I also used a roll of breakfast sausage and it was perfect. I am eating the leftovers for lunch and it's just as good as it was last night for dinner. Yum!

Yummy!  I was leary of this because of the processed cheese but it was GREAT!  I changed a few things because I needed to use up things from my garden: used ground turkey, omit the oregano and substituted grill seasoning, no mushrooms, added 5 minced bananna peppers, 1 red pepper, and 2T minced garlic (we are garlic lovers). I only baked for 15 min because that's all it really needed to melt the cheese and make it creamy. Also, I avoided an extra clean up step by baking it in my skillet (make sure your skillet is oven safe). Husband couldn't get enough and I loved it.  This is a keeper!

I thought the base for this recipe was great.  I wanted to use up some zucchini and squash I had and wanted a hearty recipe (no way I was going to eat them plain).  Some changes:  tripled the amount of rice (may have been a tad too much) used about 2 minced cloves of garlic instead of onion, used turkey kielbasa instead of ground sausage, shredded mild cheddar instead of processed cheese, doubled the mushrooms (I love them!) and used a can of diced tomatoes (with juice) instead of fresh tomatoes.  I really liked it, especially the flavor pop of the tomatoes.  ETA:  The oregeno is key to this tasting great.  I definitely put more than a pinch in!

This was very good but I used "real" cheese (cheddar) and didn't add tomatoes or mushrooms. I also added cracker crumbs to the top so it would look a little more appetizing. A new favorite that I'm making for dinner tonight!

Great receipe with some minor changes.  I didn't read the reveiws beforehand, which I usually do, but I would certainly double the rice next time as suggested.  I used sharp cheddar cheese rather then processed cheese (yuck).  I also added about 2x the onion and tomato.  I didn't have straight oregano so I used Italian seasoning (mostly oregano anyhow), and I used considerably more then a pinch.  I also used turkey sausage rather then pork and a wild rice blend I got at Costco (we never use white rice anymore).   All minor changes but worth noting.  I will certainly make this again.

I peeled and seeded my tomatoes before adding them, as I don't like the skins. I also added some mozzarella, and used 1 cup of orzo instead of rice. I used spicy Italian sausage and added dried basil and Italian seasoning. I omitted the mushrooms as I didn't have any. I made a topping out of panko crumbs, parmesan cheese, and parsley. I baked it for about 20 minutes, and broiled the top until the crumbs were brown, maybe 5 minutes. This was really good!

I enjoyed this casserole very much.  I substituted brown rice for white, and hot turkey sausage for the pork sausage. I cooked 3 chopped cloves of garlic with the sausage.  I did not find a need to drain the mixture before baking.  If anything, it was a little dry.  I think it depends on how watery your tomatoes are.  Mine was very ripe and meaty.    I will definitely make this casserole again.

This turned out really well!  I used some elbow macaroni instead of rice, but I had everything else and it was delicious.  I think next time I would consider making a cream cheese based white sauce instead of the processed cheese.  A very good recipe and a great way to use up pthose tomatoes and zucchini (or summer squash in my case) in the garden.

I really liked this one.  I made it as written except less baking time, I was too hungry to wait.  Thank you for sharing.

Like other reviewers said, it's a basic recipe that needs more seasoning/zip.  I used 1/2 can of diced tomatoes because that's what I had on hand and 4-cheese mexican blend.  Also used instant brown rice to make it quicker, baked it at 350 degrees for 25 minutes and it was done.

This was yummy.  I sauted fresh mushrooms, used hamburger, and added 2 cloves of garlic.  I will be making this again.

I used brown rice and shredded cheese - it was easy, tasted great.  It only needed about 30 minutes oven time.

I thought this was good, but not great.  Like others, I used real cheese (fresh mozzarella) instead of processed cheese.  I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, orzo instead of rice (and I added more than what is called for), and half a red bell pepper since I happened to have it in my fridge.  It might be better after it has sat in the fridge overnight... we'll see.  Not bad, but it didn't take my breath away.

Perhaps one of my new favorites -- definitely going to become a staple in our house!  The only change I made to the directions was to only bake for 40 minutes and that seemed like plenty to us!

Fabulous casserole!  You can use a ton of squash from your garden that you keep trying to get the neighbors to take!  My kids had thirds of this recipe.  I used canned tomatoes and I didn't bake it at the end. My mom made it exactly like the instructions and we both liked the changes I made better.  Baking it makes the zucchini too mushy!

My zuk and tomatoes from the garden are crazy so with that said I am constantly trying new things to use them up.  This was perfect, with a few changes. 1st I didnt read through the whole recipe, like you should, before I started and when I saw 1hr cook time I decided to let it sit in the fridge and make the next night since I was short on time.  I used ground Italian Turkey and mixed that with the zuk and tomatoes it was watery but was not the next night. Added some different seasonings per taste and then the next night through in a bag of Birdsey frozen brown rice put some mozarella in then on top with parmeson and more mozarella and a bit of cheddar.  I cannot stand processed cheese! I did not measure but didnt use alot. It was pefect loved!  Hubby thought a bit bland so added some salt, my 4yr old ate but protested (he does with everything) my 6 year old liked. Definately a keeper and next time might experiment a bit more with some seasonings.

My husband and I loved this dish!  I only used 1/3 lb. of chicken Italian sausage because I prefer less meat, it was perfect.  Also, I love basil so I added quite a bit of that.  We'll be having this regularly!

Very good!  Prep work is a little time consuming with the chopping and pre-cooking of veg., sausage, and rice.  I used yellow squash from my garden and a can of cheddar cheese soup...all I had.  I did add bread crumbs drizzled with butter on top which really added something extra.  Turned out great.  I always make enough to freeze.  It reheats wonderfully.  Enjoy!

This is really good! Of course, I changed it up a bit. We had Italian sausage on hand and no mushrooms. A little yellow summer squash added in too. Wonderful! Oh, I also used Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses. My picky 1 1/2 yr old LOVED it! Thanks:)

Even got the kids to try it!! Made a few changes. I doubled the rice and used 1/2 brown.  Added Sazon seasoning from Goya to that. In a pan I sauteed onion and garlic and added tomatoes.  Then I substituted broccoli (didn't have zucchini in the house!!)and cut up some  fresh mushrooms really small (kids again). Threw in veggi chorizo and used both fresh chedder and the mexican velveeta (about half).  To be honost, I had bought the velveeta at a buy one get one free (hadn't tasted it in years) and was thrilled to find a recipe to use it  since I discovered I no longer liked it.  It was GREAT in this recipe.  I really suggest keeping it in.  I put the rice layer on the bottom, and put the chorizo layer on top of that in the casserole dish rather than mixing it all together.  I added the fresh cheese on top and baked for like 15-20 minutes (until the cheese melted and I could get everyone at the table).  It was fantastic.  Even better the next day.  This recipe inspired me to plant some zucchini's in the garden the next day.  Can't wait to try it out with them.  Thanks!!!

This is really really good. I changed just a few things. I used 1/2 cup chopped onion instead of 1/4. I used seasoned italian sausage instead of just plain sausage. I never added the rice. Just cooked the rice seperate and used the sausage mixture as a topping for the rice.  I springled the sausage mixture w/ garlic salt and flakes in addition to the salt and pepper and then baked in a 9x13 as stated then sprinkled it w/ a full bag of shredded cheddar cheese and only baked for about 30 min since everythings already cooked. Several people have said to leave out the processed cheese which I think is not a good idea. The processed cheese helps solidify the mixture and 8oz is such a small amount to even make a dent in taste, if anything just makes it a little cheesier thicker and better. Next time I might even add 4oz more of the prossed cheese. And then I might just take the whole sausage mixture and mix it w/ spaghetti sauce and serve it over noodles instead of rice. Anyway great idea for a recipe. Uses my 3 favorite vegetables and I love sausage so thats why I made this!

This casserole was great. I too added more rice and used shredded cheese. Also used canned diced tomatoes with green chilies. It came out perfect. I hoped we would have enough for dinner the next night (since it is just me and hubby) but I was wrong. He had two huge helpings for dinner and even had some for breakfast and lunch the next day. This is now one of his favorites. Next time I will double it. Thanks for the great recipe!!

My boyfriend and I absolutely love this recipe!!  It's the perfect summer recipe.  We use fresh tomatoes and zucchini from the garden, along with wild boar sausage that my dad hunts.  I used a combination of green and yellow zucchini.  I also used 2 different kinds of wild boar sausage and a variety of shredded cheese.  We have already made this recipe twice within the last few weeks.  Great recipe!!!  Thanks!

This isn't a particularly attractive dish, but it's good comfort food. I don't like mushrooms so I leave those out and add a bit more zucchini. The leftovers reheat nicely. Thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe. Not an overpowering flavor of sausage, which I am glad.  Used shredded sharp cheddar (2 cups) plus some cubes of Velveeta cheese I had left over.  I topped the casserole with yet some more cheddar cheese (I LOVE cheese)before putting in the oven.  I had prepared this ahead of time, but even when cold from the fridge it only took about 30 minutes to heat thorougly in oven. Will make again!

I followed the suggestions from several other reviews and doubled the rice, but decided the original specified quantity would have been plenty.  With the additional rice, there was more starch than vegetables, and that's not the direction I am trying to go in.  Used fresh mushrooms and canned tomatoes.  I did use velveeta slices to top off the casserole - next time I will use cheddar.

This recipe was pretty good.  I made it with turkey sausage and I left out the mushrooms, because I did not happen to have any on hand.  I also added garlic and green pepper to compensate for not having mushrooms. I used only half of the cheese because that is all I had also.  I think it was fine with less cheese. Next time I would probably bake it in a smaller dish or for less time because the top got a bit crusty and dry. But overall this was a good recipe.  Thanks.

This recipe is a keeper.  The first time I made this, I doubled the rice (after reading other reviews). Too dry! The second time, I followed the recipe (omitted the mushrooms)and it was perfect.  My picky 14 month old son loves it, and so do the rest of us. Thanks for the addition to my recipe box.

Nice recipe.  I used ground turkey sausage and shredded cheddar cheese.  Baked it for only 30 minutes since it was still hot from the stove.  The texture and flavors were good.

28 oz. italian canned tomatoes, a red bell pepper, 2 yellow squash and 2 zucchini, and a mixture of low-fat mozzarella and asiago, romano, and parmesan because that's what I had in
the refrig.  I cooked it in the slow cooker because I had errands. I think I will use the low-fat turkey sausage next time.

YUMMY!  We loved this.  The recipe didn't say whether to remove the sausage from the casing so I just sliced mine up after frying it a bit.  I used Mexican style Velveeta, and it turned out a little spicy, but delicious.  I also used about twice as much rice as the recipe called for as we are big rice lovers.  It turned out wonderful.  The only thing I would change was my own fault; I used one sausage that was 'hot' and two that were 'mild' next time I will just stick with the 'mild' ones.  Thanks for the excellent dish, this is a definite keeper in my recipe book.

When I served this to my husband he said that it looked quite boring, but when he tried it he said that it was awesome.  I didn't have processed cheese so I used 1/2 cup cream cheese for a creamy texture and 1/2 cup old cheddar for taste.  Since I like things a bit spicy, but only had regular pork sausage, I added a bit of dried red pepper flakes to the meat before cooking.  This was a great recipe and now I have another use for all the zucchini in my garden.

This recipe is outstanding. My wife thought it was one of the best recipes I have ever made! I forgot to put the mushrooms in but all the other ingredients were the same except for more rice. This is definately one that I can't wait to make again.

This was such a hit with my family.  I made 3 changes, 1) used 12 oz chorizo sausage, I'm not crazy about plain pork 2)added more rice 3)added 1/4 c red pepper to onion and sausage while cooking.  It came out soooo great!  Thanks Mandy!

Thought this recipe was great. I made with linguica instead of sausage, added garlic and put peppridge farm corn bread stuffing mix over the top of the casserole.  Tastes even better the next day.

I used Cheez Whiz just so my kids would try it (they LOVE Cheez Whiz) They all liked it.  I also used a medium spiced sausage to give it a little more flavor and my husband loved it also!
Next time I am going to put some eggs in it and try it as a breakfast casserole

This recipe is delicious and easy to prepare.  Instead of the mushrooms, I used artichoke antipasta and I steamed the squash a little in the microwave before adding it to the sausage.

I've made this twice so far, first as written was a 3.5, but I am not a fan of the overwhelming processed cheese flavor.  However in order to keep the creamy factor, some should remain.  Instead of 8 oz though, I reduced to 4 and subbed shredded cheddar for the rest of the cheese.  Otherwise it's a delicious recipe.

Just finished making this & it was really good!

I used hot sausage to give it some bite and used a can of Italian diced tomatoes instead a fresh tomato because I didn't have fresh.  I also added more rice & instead of Velveeta, I used a 5 cheese Italian blend (again, because I had it on hand).  And I didn't bother with the oven, but followed another's suggestion & used the stove.

This really hit the spot!

My husband said it's amazing and my daughter said it's phenomenal! 
I used a whole onion and 2 large cloves of garlic, 1/2 pound spicy and 1/2 pound regular sausage. I also used brown rice, fresh mushrooms, a couple extra tomatoes and cheddar cheese on top. 
Instead of dumping the extra liquid from the extra tomatoes and veggies as others did, I added a small amount of corn starch to thicken it up.

Made as per listed,  used less sausage as it was what I had.
Have a friend who is gluten &  hoof animal free due to tick 
bite...going to make this for her & substitute shrimp...
think this is good without any protein for anyone who is vegetarian.
update 7/11/19  made this without any protein as a side
dish, used  a bag of mixed Mexican cheeses that I had on hand...lovely.  will be making this again, great way to use 
a large zucchini that lay hidden at bottom of plant & can be changed to meet ones family likes

Oh my goodness, this was delicious. The only changes I made was pressing 2 garlic cloves in with the sausage and onions and substituting 8oz shredded sharp cheddar for the processed cheese. It was an immediate favorite!!! Thank you!

Loved everything about it! All my favorite veggies! It actually didn’t take me long to prep, and I baked it for 15 minutes at 400 instead to speed things up. Some changes I made was use mild Jimmy Dean’s sausage for some spicy goodness, used shredded sharp cheddar cheese instead of blocks of cheese, and topped it off with French’s fried onion - delicious!

This is delicious! I did make a few changes. I use noodles/pasta, fresh mushrooms, chopped garlic, a jalapeno and cheddar cheese. I also don't bake it, I just stir fry veggies into the cooked sausage. It's fresh, light and delicious! Some would say I should post it as a new recipe, but I need to give Mandy the credit. Thank you for the recipe!

So glad I found this recipe--helped me use up all that zucchini my neighbor gave me from her garden! I had Italian sausage on hand, so I used that,  used shredded mozzarella for the processed cheese, and served it with grated Parmesan on top.  I did omit the salt, pepper, and oregano, because I figured the Italian sausage had enough. Super yummy! Thank you for sharing!

I was surprised at how great this was even with all the good reviews. I used brown rice because that's what I had; one cup instead of 1/2 as per others' advice. I used a red bell pepper in place of tomato because I suspected that would solve the problem of too much liquid that other reviewers had, without affecting the overall taste, and I had no issue with too much watery-ness (made that word up.) I threw the chopped red bell in with the sausage and onion. I also added a some mozzarella to the top. My husband and all four kids gobbled this up, which is rare. Definitely will be making again.

Absolutely delicious! I added 1/2 cup of pine nuts and garlic. I also used cubed Monterey  Jack cheese. It's a first time favorite. (Also topped with more cheese if desired!!).

I was looking for something lighter than my usual sausage casserole...this is it! I made a few changes...I used both squash and zucchini (since i only had a little of each), did not use mushrooms, swapped out the processed cheese for cream cheese, and used a can of Italian style tomatoes. I used seasoned salt and garlic to season. Baked at 350 for 30 minutes and it was delicious!! This will be going in my arsenal of recipes.

Yum! I made changes based on what was around the house. I didn't have tomatoes or mushrooms handy so left them out. And I didn't have processed cheese so I substituted tomato soup for a cream and flavoring. I also doubled the rice and added fennel to the recipe. Instead of baking, I cooked it will on the stovetop. It turned out really good.

This recipe was easy and wonderful. I prepared it exactly as suggested, other than using hot ground pork in lieu of mild, and fresh mushrooms instead of canned. The results were a really, really tasty dish that I will definitely prepare again. I was a little skeptical about using processed cheese (i.e. Velvetta), but guess what, you purists? It actually brought all of the ingredients together and enhanced the taste. If you're not into grilling, I can't think of a better use of summer zucchini than this recipe.

I made this with kielbasa as the meat! So good! Also, I used  zucchini & summer squash but no tomato and some shredded cheese instead of processed cheese. And skipped the oven. Very delicious and just as good, if not better, as leftovers!

Delicious! though we used kelbasa-like sausage and  1 cup grated cheese instead (rather than the breakfast sausage and processed cheese food) and cooked it for only 1/2 an hour

Everyone loved it! Even my very picky eater. Didn't change much. Used mild Italian pork sausage, shredded cheese instead of cubes and I had a mix of zucchini & yellow squash on hand instead of all zucchini. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was awesome. Will definitely make again.

I can't really rate it because I needed to use some different ingredients. So I'll rate it at least a 4, maybe 4-1/2 using my version! The bulk sausage I had on hand turned out to be chorizo so it became kinda TexMex. I had 2 yellow squash and 1 zuke (had to give 1/2 of that to local critters, mainly squirrels. Those were diced and I had 2 ears of fresh sweet corn, all of which were purchased at a local farmer's market and were "on the edge". I broke up the chorizo and added the onion - next time I'll use more onion - and sauteed as directed. Added a bit of water and covered to hasten the softness of the veggies. Had some mozzarella, some shredded cheddar and some 4-cheese as well. Mixed them all into the rice & veggie combo and then put in 350 oven for about 20 mins. Should have made a green salad as a go-with but it was very good, other than needing more onion. Served with green taco sauce. Mui bueno!

I would double the rice next time, maybe go a little easier on the cheese. But this was delicious! The servings are on the small side so make a lot.

I made this as written except for a few minor deviations.  I used sweet sausage and I cooked the rice with chicken broth, also doubling the amount called for.  This recipe was easy to make and delicious in my opinion.  I did cook with garlic salt and some Cheyenne pepper for a small kick.

I doubled the rice as suggested by others and left out mushrooms, because I didn't have any. I topped it with seasoned bread crumbs and baked it a 375 degrees for 30 min. It was a hit with my family. Always looking for ways to utilize the products of our garden!

I thought this was a pretty healthy recipe with a couple of minor changes! First I used sharp cheddar cheese and cream cheese instead of the process cheese. I used about 8 ounces of cheddar and one third of a block of cream cheese. It was delicious! Also don't be afraid to be generous with the veggies. I added a little extra tomatoes and zucchini. Overall I thought this recipe was great with minor changes and that's why I came in at four.

This was a big hit in my household!  My two finicky boys even liked it!  I substituted the processed cheese with shredded cheddar cheese in that I don't care for the taste of processed cheese.  This will be a dish I will make over and over again!

I made this on the stove top hamburger helper sytle, skipped baking in the oven to make it a faster dish to prepare.  Just cooked long enough for the zucchini to soften a bit then added the rice and cheese.  Also added diced bell pepper and sliced fresh  mushrooms instead of canned.  This is a great recipe to use all of those zucchinis, peppers, onions and tomatoes from your summer garden!  Kid tested and approved even with all the veggies!

Very very good. I used fresh mushrooms and the mozzarella / Parmesan variation of a recent reviewer.  I also added some garlic with the onion.  I cut the amount of sausage in half ( cooked a pound with the onions and garlic, then removed half of the mix from the pan for another dinner, I do this so I can buy yummy organic turkey sausage, which is a bit pricey).  I didn't cook the zuke until it was soft, just until it pierced smoothly; I think that is why I didn't have the liquid some folks mentioned.  I did bake it, but only for about 20 minutes, the zuke still had form but was soft. I will definitely make this again, love those casseroles with lots of veggies!

This dish is wonderful. Made this twice in 3 days at the request of my husband. Had hoped to freeze leftovers but there weren't any and there are only the 2 of us eating it! Only changes were using equal amounts of mozzarella and cheddar rather than processed cheese, upped the amount of rice and no onion (allergic). Must stock up on zucchini so that it can be made during the winter months. A new comfort food. Thank you so much for this recipe.

Nice and hearty for my husband and son.  I used hamburger instead of sausage and omitted the mushrooms.  I took the others' suggestions and added cheddar.  I also only baked it for 1/2 hour, just enough to heat through because I prefer my zucchini slightly firm.  I also used twice the rice.

Really liked this recipe...it's one of those that you can change things up if you want and it still works.  I didn't have any fresh tomatoes on hand, so I used a can of diced tomatoes.  Also, I needed to speed things up so I used some leftover couscous (instead of rice) and used Jimmy Dean turkey sausage crumbles in place of the sausage. Ate with tortilla chips.  Turned out great!

I have to give this 5 stars because my kids ate it and loved it!  I can't get them to eat zucchini any other way.  My husband loves it too and he is a vegetable aficionado.  We grow our own and he hates the fact that the kids won't eat them.  Now they do!  Awesome!

Great recipe to use up some zucchini! I excluded the mushrooms as my husband does not like them, and it was still great.

Great recipe but I made a few tweaks. Definately needed to double the rice. I didn't have velveeta on hand so I used 4 slices of american cheese and 2 cups of a cheese blend (montery jack, chedder, asadero) and a 1/2 cup of milk. I used a can of tomatoes because our tomato plants haven't produced red tomatoes yet. My 8 and 11 yr olds both loved it and my hubby did too...excellent in my book!

This was very pleasing. Yum!  I made a couple of substitutions. I used Italian sausage instead of pork and yellow squash instead of zucchini. We will make it again!

I made lots of substitutions (green tomatoes, hot italian sausage, delicata squash instead of zucchini, a feta/cheddar mix instead of processed) and this turned out great - it outlines a good basic method for making casseroles. You can use any grain (or pasta), any veg, any herbs/spices and any cheese (as long as all the flavours work together, of course!).

Yummy.  Younger kid enjoyed it, while the picky one didn't.  But mom did, and that is all that matters.  I was out of tomatoes, so I used a small can of tomato sauce.  Using the sauce, I did not have to worry about cooking down the liquid before baking.  Easy and yummy.

My DH loved this. He thought it may be just "ok" but said it was great, even my 3 & 4 YO boys liked it. The only change I made was to add a little minced garlic and used 2C shredded sharp cheddar as per other reviews.  Thanks for recipe!

plyuck -- If you're going to make this recipe do not use the processed cheese. It ruined the dish. Other than that though, I enjoyed the combination of sausage and zucchini very much.

Bland, but good enough to satisfy.  Tried upping the spices, but still needed more.  Perhaps it's just too much cheese.

This was pretty good. I only baked it for about 25 min and that was perfect.  It was a bit too cheesy for my taste, so maybe next time I won't put in so much.

This was great. I must confess my husband made it and gets the credit (but hey I found and printed the recipe for him right?). Couple changes, used real cheese instead of processed, and brown rice instead of white... also, he layered the casserole and cheese alternatly instead of mixing the cheese in. Yum. I love my hubby. (Next time... spicy sausage might be better!)

What a great casserole!! A good way to use all that zucchini from the garden!The only thing I'll change next time is the cheese--the Velveeta made it a little too rich for me--I think shr. cheddar or a shr. Mexican/taco blend would be more to my liking. My husband said he loved it just the way it was.

This was really good!  I have to say, I really liked the Velveeta!  I also used Chorizo sausage which was key.  It ended up being more like a stew than a casserole but it was still really good and made great leftovers.  Goes well with some crescent rolls fresh from the oven!

Think this turned out so yummy cos I used chorizo sausage, so the taste permeated the whole dish.  With reg sausage think it would be bland.  Also was verging on being dry, which is to OUR taste but obviously wouldnt please some people.  Defo a dish I will make regularly- thanks.

This recipe was great, except when I went up for seconds, the zucchini had become mushy.  Still, it was a good recipe, and a way to get my hubby to eat veggies!  I used hot Italian sausage to give it a 'kick'.

This dish wasn't very appealing to the eye when it came out of the oven... but man it was sooooooo good.  It did take quite a bit of time to prepare, though.  This recipe made a lot, we had leftovers for a week.  I would definitely make this again!

Wonderful Dish!! No left overs and we loved this. We will definately be making this again.  I used hot turkey sausage and I also added minced garlic.

I don't have much of an appetite these days, so I'm relying on Husband to give a fair verdict. I agree with him that was pretty tasty but nothing really outstanding. I think maybe we've been eating too much zucchini recently, because I felt unenthusiastic about this while I was making it. The only changes I made were to use grated extra-sharp Cheddar instead of plastic cheese, and fresh mushies instead of canned. This was a good meal for a week-day, but I doubt I'll make it again. Thanks anyway!

This is a great recipe!  My family loved it.  When you're getting tired of your usual squash/zucchini recipes, this is a great change of pace.  Since my family doesn't like onions, I substituted onion powder/salt for the chopped onion and still got great flavor.

This was awesome, one of the best dishes yet. I will use this one over and over. My husband even ate it and he doesn't like tomatoes or zucchini, and my boys ate it and the leftovers. I used Italian sausage, and it was GREAT!!Five stars for sure.

Very good. I would make a few changes next time though. I would use regular cheddar cheese rather than processed cheese and I would either double the tomato or use rotel. Also doubled the rice & water as suggested by others.

Absolutely wonderful! I took out the rice though since I'm on a low-carb diet. I also took out the mushrooms because I'm not very fond of them. It was still fantastic! I will definitely make this one again.

Oh yum!!  Extremely decadent!  Come on, it's veggies bathed in cheese!  I used chicken andouille sausage in lieu of pork, one zucchini and one yellowneck instead of all zucchini, and an 8 oz bag of shredded four cheese blend instead of velveeta (yuk!  give me real cheese!).  Next time I think I will leave out the rice...it really didn't contribute much in my opinion.  I also added minced garlic.  It is salty, so next time I won't add any extra salt.  Thanks for the keeper!

We loved this one - made it without mushrooms, with canned tomatoes, and cheddar and with brown rice - excellent.  DH ate thirds and he hates vegetables.

I will make this recipe again.  My husband and children enjoyed it very much.  It's hard to please all of them at the same time. Plus it was something new to do with all the zucchinni we have from our garden.

I made this recipe for a friend of mine who had just had a baby.  I halved the recipe and fed both her family and mine.  She and I both agreed this was a very "manly" recipe.  Our husbands enjoyed the casserole, but we both thought it was just okay.  Not disgusting but nothing we would cook again.

This recipe is great as is, I used long-grain basmati white rice and Bob Evans brand regular ground sausage. My husband and teen daughters loved this, ate every drop and requested it a second time in the same week!

Excellent recipe! I used feta cheese instead because I didn't have any other on hand, but it worked out great. I even used 2 cups of rice, but the saltiness was just about right.

My husband and I both loved this casserole!  I used half sharp cheddar and half mozzerella instead of processed cheese because it was what I had on hand.  The flavor was great!  We ate leftovers for 2 days and did not get sick of it.  Will definitely recommend to others!

This was a great recipe. My family loved it! Thanks Mandy! The only thing I did different was to take a users advice and put PF corn bread stuffing on top. YUM!

This is very flavorful.  Besides halving the recipe, I made no changes.  DH said it was salty, but I didn't find it to be.  Could have been from the Velveeta?  Anyway, there were no leftovers.  I would definitely make this again.
