My family really enjoyed this cake.  It is very moist.  We cut down the sugar by 1/4 and added an egg to make up for it.  We didnt have margarine so we just used vegetable oil instead.  We used vannila extract and vanilla yogurt instead of lemon.

I love pound cake, but I'm always concerned about all the fat and the sugar. This cake was really good, I only used 1 cup of sugar, 3/4 cup of butter, fat free plain yogurt and vanilla extract. My husband and the kids also enjoyed it. I will definitely make it again!

Yum! I halved the recipe and used vanilla and butter instead - please do use butter, it tastes so much better! The edges baked up crispy and tasted like butter cookies right out of the oven. Be sure to use cold butter and do not overmix - my batter was still lumpy when I poured it into the pan.

Excellent, Excellent, Excellent is what I will say! Here are the changes I made: like others I used 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1 1/2 sticks butter, I did not have lemon yogurt so I used low-fat plain, I added the zest of 3 lemons into the batter. I also used a lemon glaze made of powdered sugar and fresh lemon juice. This is one of the best cakes that I have ever made. So moist, so delicious, truly amazing. Extremely quick and easy to make, mine baked in 55 minutes. Thanks for a GREAT yogurt cake, my 1st and it's a keeper :o)

This was a really good cake!  When I first made it, I left out the lemon extract  (by accident) and glazed it with a mixture of 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar and 2 tbsp lemon juice.  Everyone thought it was a rum cake!  You could probably sub rum extract for the lemon.  If I make it again, I would also add about 1/4 cup of poppy seeds.

This was absolutely sinful! I used whole milk vanilla yogurt and real butter, and vanilla instead of lemon extract. Next time I will try with the lemon extract! Also made a powdered sugar glaze for the top of the cake. Yummy!

Very good recipe.  The cake was moist and the texture was light.  I subbed butter-flavored crisco for the margarine, used 3/4 c. sugar, as other reviewers suggested, and used vanilla flavoring and vanilla yogurt.  I love that this recipe is so flexible and I will definitely make this again.

We  followed others' ideas and used 1.5 cups of butter and sugar....grated lemon zest into plan yogurt, and baked for just 57 minutes. After allowing cake to cool for 10 minutes, we inverted it onto a glass plate then using a wooden skewer, poked holes all over the cake. We prepared a  glaze of .5 cup powdered sugar, 2 T honey, juice of one lemon, 1 t lemon zest, and .5 t of cardomom - which we then poured over entire surface of cake. Allow to "set" for a few more minutes and enjoy with a hot cup of tea!

This is an excellent cake. I cut down on the margarine by about 1/4 c. and cut the sugar to 1.5c. I didn't have yoghurt but I had some Clotted Cream (A substitute recipe from this site) left over that I used in place of the yoghurt and added some sour cream to get the 8oz required.
I was generous with the flour as well.  I find that using a KitchenAid Stand Mixer to really beat the margarine/sugar till really creamy, and the same when adding the eggs, I can increase the flour or cut down the number of eggs.  The point of all this is that this recipe is a very forgiving recipe.  It's delicious, a pretty color, lovely texture, and light (lighter than a traditional pound cake in my opinion but nonetheless excellent).  Rather than use a Bundt pan, I made it in two loaf pans so that I could put one in the freezer.
In spite of the two pans, they each still took about 1.5 hours to bake.  After an hour at 325, I raised the temp to 350 and next time I'll start it at 350. I'll be making this again.  Great with fresh strawberries.

Wonderful cake!  I also used 1.5 sticks butter, 1.5 cups brown sugar instead of white, and a full tablespoon of lemon extract plus lemon zest (we like lemony!) and then did vanilla yogurt since that's what I had on hand.  Delicious, moist, flavorful.  We did not do the glaze as we thought the cake was sweet enough, instead we drizzled a homemade raspberry sauce over our slices.  Lovely summertime dessert.

So versatile and delicious! I've been swapping out the flavours and adding frozen berries. So far I've done peach yogurt with raspberries and blueberry yogurt with blueberries. My go-to coffe/pound cake from now on! About 1/2 to 3/4 cup of berries is good, thawed they won't add to the cooking time.

This was very good, fast to make. I used 2C nonfat vanilla yogurt, 1T vanilla and stirred in a handful of chocolate chips, served warm with vanilla ice cream.

This is a fantastic recipe.  Very easy to follow and turned out great.  I even froze half of the cake to save for later and after defrosting it still tasted great.  I would have given it five stars except the cook time was off.  Luckily I always check early when I'm baking because after 40 min. the cake was perfectly done.  Perhaps it's because I live at sea level?  Or my oven?  Just beware when baking, you may not need the full 60min.

Made this with my homemade plain yogurt.  Everyone loved it.  Next time I will use less butter (should have read reviews!).  A win!

Lately, I've been baking a lot of vegan cakes and they don't really stand up quite as good as cakes with eggs - so when I found this recipe I thought I'd try it because it contains yogurt and that is something I almost always have - I never have sour cream... I used regular vanilla yogurt, and vanilla extract - no lemon for me... and this cake was just the perfect consistency - it held up very well and it tasted so perfect and yummy - i will definitely add it to my permanent recipe book - and use it again and again...  hey maybe next time i'll try it with strawberry yogurt and strawberry extract just to give it a little something extra ;)

I made a few alterations to suit my needs: I cut out 1/2c of sugar as others suggested, I made it into cupcakes, I used Greek yogurt because it's what I had on hand, and I replaced the lemon with vanilla. They turned out fabulous. 1/4 cup batter in each wrapper yielded cupcakes with beautiful golden domes just above the top of the wrapper, they cooked all the way through and had a perfect texture. I am serving them with a drizzle of Martha Stewart's Caramel Bourbon Vanilla sauce (http://www.marthastewart.com/338951/caramel-bourbon-vanilla-sauce?center=0&gallery=274972&slide=199286). I will certainly make these again.

Very yummy yogurt cake.  I used 1.5 sticks butter, 1.5 cups sugar and vanilla yogurt.  I used zest from 2 lemons and approx 1 tbsp lemon juice.  I poured batter into 2 loaf pans and baked for 50-55min at 325.  To make it extra lemony, I made a glaze from 1 cup powdered sugar and 2 tbsp lemon juice.

This cake  delicious!  I made it four days ago and am making it again today because everyone is clamboring for more.  I didn't have a bundt pan and used a springform pan instead, which worked fine.  I didn't have any lemon yogurt.  So, I doubled the lemon extract and used vanilla yogurt instead of lemon.  It turned out perfectly.  I frosted it with vanilla buttercream frosting.

This cake was wonderful, quick and easy. Used vanilla yogurt, and vanilla extract, 3/4 cup butter, 1 cup sugar, 2 cups vanilla yogurt, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, and 2 TBSP's lemon juice.  Remember proper mixing techniques, and don't incorporate too much air.  Also, started in a cold oven 300 for 60 min. (my oven runs hot). Simple glaze of icing sugar, and lemon juice makes the cake.

This was fantastic!  I had some raspberry yogurt that I need to use or lose, so I used that in place of the lemon yogurt and used raspberry extract.  My only other change was using butter instead of margarine.  The cake was moist and was pleasantly crisp on the outside.  DH wanted a glaze on this, so I used "Vanilla Glaze" from this site.

This was a great cake! I did however make a few changes to make it to my liking. I used real butter, vanilla fat-free yogurt, almond extract, and added a glaze on top of powdered sugar, milk, and a little more almond extract. I also topped it with some slivered almonds that I toasted in a pan. Delicious! (Oh, and I also only baked it for about 52 minutes, not 60.)

This is an absolutely easy recipe and the cake was GREAT!! Not a fan of lemon so I replaced the lemon ingredients with vanilla and used half of the recommended amount of sugar. Another must is replace butter for the margarine. You will taste the difference.

I used 12oz of peach yogurt and only 1 stick of margarine. I also only used 1 cup of sugar and it was definitely still sweet enough. I used vanilla extract. The flavor was great but the cake was a bit heavy with a light flavor.

Yum!  This cake was loved by all.  I'm a harsh critic and felt it was a bit dry on the outside.  This could have been due to my oven however.

I followed the suggestion to reduce the sugar by one half and used vanilla instead of lemon yogurt which meant I had to double the amount of lemon extract.  Overall, I highly recommend this cake!

This recipe turns out well time and time again. I usually don't have lemon yogurt on hand. I use it when I do, but normally I use plain yogurt and double the amount of lemon extract. It's a winner; thanks for posting.

Delicious.  Not overly sweet.  I was worried that it might be too sweet but I went ahead and followed recipe exactly.  Even the baking time was right on the money.  Next time I will add an extra teaspoon of lemon extract along with lots of poppy seeds.  I will note that I used Chobani Lemon Yogurt.  The packages say 5.3 ounces.  Good thing I measured becase as it turns out they actually contain 4.5 ounces in the pacakage as measured with the Pyrex 5 ounce  liquid measure cup.  It took just shy of two packages of the yogurt.  *(This recipe calls for butter and when I read some of the reviews it sounded like people thought it called for margarine.  I wonder if it called for margarine and then was later edited.  I would never use margarine anyways but I found that curious.) - Thanks for sharing.

Delicious, even without frosting! I made some changes: used butter in place of margarine, 1 tsp. lemon juice instead of extract, and used plain Greek yogurt instead of the lemon flavored yogurt. Again, yum!

AMAZING! I switched the recipe up a bit to better suit what I had on hand. I used 8oz of ZOI Greek Honey Yogurt. I only used 3/4 cup of white sugar and then 1/2 cup dark brown sugar and used vanilla extract instead of lemon and real butter every time!  I passed on the lemon flavor this time bc I didn't have fresh lemons. In the future I want to use my changes once more, but add cinnamon to make it a bit spicier. The one I baked though, WAS INCREDIBLY MOIST and light. I also stirred everything by hand and slowly folded in the ingredients. better overall outcome.

I didn't have lemon yogurt so used French vanilla.  I DID have lemons so zested 2 of them into the batter ... delicious, moist, definitely making again.  Oh, I will NOT eat/use margarine so used real butter...minor changes with amazing results.  

I made 2 loaves instead of a whole bundt which was great b/c I froze one of the breads & will be enjoying the other with my daughter this week.

This was a great tasting recipe, not sure what I did wrong but the cake broke when taking it out of the pan :-( because of that I'm not likely to bake this again.

I've made this twice now. I used butter instead of margerine. And like another reviewer, I didn't have the lemon yogurt, so sub'd vanilla with some lemon zest. It is a wonderfully moist cake. The first time, I baked it for the full hour and thought it was a bit over-baked. The second time I baked it for 55 minutes, and it was perfect.

YUM!! This is a very moist cake! I didn't have the lemon yogurt, so I used vanilla. As others have said, I also only used 1 1/2 sticks of butter and 1 1/4 cups of sugar. We didn't have the lemon extract either, so I just used vanilla. It turned out to be more of a vanilla yogurt cake rather than lemon, but I used a lemon glaze on top and it was still delicious!  For the lemon glaze I followed the "Lemon Glazed Cake" recipe on here, but cut the confectioner's sugar to 1 cup.

I needed to use up some leftover vanilla yogurt so I decided to make this. I did make some minor changes. I used vanilla yogurt & as others suggested, I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups & margarine to 1 1/2 sticks. Delicious! I drizzled vanilla glaze over the top! We all loved it!

I've made this great cake 7 times now.  Four were perfect  in texture (like a moist, VERY slightly chewy bread, good air holes but not what I'd call airy and light).  With the others I'm obviously doing something wrong; the texture is smoother, denser, no holes, finer grain.  Does this mean too much liquid, or overmixing, or what?  I'm new.

I made this with my 2 small children helping out and got really distracted when combining everything. Well, I ended up putting baking powder instead of baking soda in it...which I didn't realize until about mid-way through baking. Even though it didn't really rise much and was thick because of my mistake, the flavor was still great and I can't wait to make one with the correct ingredients!

OMG!!!! This was one of the best cakes I have ever made.  The only thing I changed was I used 2 tbsp. of lemon extract instead of 1 tbsp.  I wanted a more powerful lemon taste.  And used butter instead of margarine.  It was delicious, very moist  and soooo easy.  I will be making this cake a lot.  Probably next time I will try orange yogurt and orange extract.

This cake was incredible.  The only modification was decreasing the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  I pulled it out of the oven 35 minutes ago and my family has already eaten half of it!  Thanks for sharing . . I will definitely make this again!

this was so good. the texture came out perfect. I had everything but the lemon yogurt. I used homemade plain Greek yogurt. I added a splash of lemon juice and the zest of a lemon, as a replacement to the lemon flavored yogurt.

I topped it with a blueberry glaze. honestly, it was so good, everyone was asking how I made it.

A really good yogurt cake!  I didn’t have any lemon yogurt so I used plain and added a little more lemon juice.  I also cut down on the sugar.  It’s a great dessert with ice cream or an afternoon treat with a cup of tea.

This cake tastes amazing but I had troubles with the middle sinking in. I followed the recipe as followed. Wondering if I needed to add more flour for high altitude or if I didn't bake quite long enough. Any suggestions?

I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, added a 4th egg, used butter instead of margarine, and used whole milk greek plain yogurt.

I combined the sugar with the grated zest of two oranges and let is sit overnight to really infuse.

I used 1/2 teast vanilla, and 1/2 teas orange extract.

Turned out great. Nice and moist with a mild orange flavor.

Four stars because I use 1-3/4 c. sugar. I like sweet a lot but that was enough, could be 1-1/2c. Other than that, great cake, will do it again, perfect moist, used a bundt cake pan, butter instead of margarine and greek plain yougurt and vanilla extract. This is a keeper.

Loved it, my son especially! I used vanilla extract & yogurt instead becuase my son loves vanilla. I only used 1 cup of sugar, not a fan of overly sweet baked goods. Loafs only lasted two days!

Cake turned out good. Only thing I did was go with peach yogurt and added spices for an appropriate Autumn theme. Also vanilla flavoring. Allspice and cinnamon added with 2 8oz. Yogurts. Very good. Thanks!

My daughter and I followed this recipe exactly as written...it was so good!! The entire group loved it. We served it with a side of whipped cream. Very delightful. All the girls wanted the recipe. (That's a great sign).
------update-----
We were just asked for this cake for grandpas birthday and I'm going to double it as we had everyone calling last time to see if we had left overs??

I followed some suggestions here, and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, I used butter, one and a half sticks, and plain yogurt. The flavoring I used was vanilla and coconut extract. I baked it in a Bundt pan sprayed with pan spray, and it released easily. My cake turned out moist, delicious, exactly sweet enough. I had company, and everyone loved it. This cake is very basic, but amazing. I will be making it again. And thanks to those who reported how their changes worked. I am always trying to reduce the sugar since my hubby is diabetic, but we hate artificial sweeteners.

It's a really good recipe. Follow the recipe you will make something amazing. Our family love it very much. I used a cup of brown sugar instead of white sugar. Thank you for sharing the recipe with us. Next time I will try other flavor yogurt.

Made it twice. made some adjustments the second time. I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, only used 3/4 of margarine, and plain yogurt. also added another 1/4 tsp of baking powder.  Added about 2 tbsp of milk at the end as it got a bit thick. My kid ate it all up during the week ... thank you for a great recipe!!

Really tasty! I made lots of substitutions but still ended up being fantastic! Ran out of vanilla so added vanilla soy milk instead... Also used plain green yogurt...only needed 1 cup sugar and 3/4 cup margarine/butter mix...and added chocolate chips! amazing!

This is the third cake I have baked in my life. 
Used oil instead of butter. I set the oven al 165C as indicated but for some reason I had to bake this cake for 90 min. I used a silicone pan. 
Overall it was good. A bit too sweet. But i'm proud with the result.

Delicious and moist. I made it mostly as written, except that I had no lemon extract, so I subbed vanilla extract and the zest of one lemon. I glazed it with a simple lemon juice and powdered sugar glaze.

Yummy! According to suggestions I used 3/4 c butter, 1 c sugar,  vanilla extract, and plain yogurt. I would love to try this with lemon extract some time but I didn't have any. I was looking for a bundt cake recipe that used yogurt and didn't use baking powder. Perfect cake recipe for ingredients I always have on hand. So easy too!

So easy to make, I followed other people's advice and reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup. This cake is awesome, so moist and delicious, my whole family loves this cake. Great for lunchboxes too. I also use vanilla yogurt instead of lemon and it turns out perfect every time.

My 4-year-old had a blast making this cake! Easy recipe to follow. We used vanilla extract and yogurt instead of lemon. I also reduced the sugar and used vegetable oil instead of butter and it still turned out great. This is a great recipe if you have yogurt in your fridge that needs to be used before it expires.

Very good! I had been looking for a recipe like this that resembled one that I used to use a while back. I used two 6 oz containers of lemon yogurt to make it moister, and I double the lemon extract. It was so good!

Excellent cake! It was very moist and had nice texture.
I did, however, had to reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup. Also, I used lemon juice (didn't have any extract), and used plain yogurt.
It came out wonderful and was a hit with my family (especially the little ones).

marvellous..fantastic..excellent yogurt cake recipe..but its too sweet..next time i would reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, i forgot to change the burner to upper and lower ..i used lower instead..so it burned the sides of the cake,,so i reduce the temperature and put it upper burner..then after few minutes i used the upper and lower burner.so it cracks in the middle..some parts are not evenly cooked.i would definitely try again this recipe.it is so soft and fully..and moist..very very soft..thanks for the great recipe!.

Any recipe that can withstand substitutions gets my vote. I used 3/4 cup of oil instead of magarine, added orange essence instead of lemon and used peach & mango yogurt because that's what I had on hand. It came out moist and went down very well.

This was a good cake. It tasted exactly like a pound cake to me. I was hoping the lemon flavor would be stronger, but I used vanilla extract instead of lemon since I didn't have it, and I am assuming that was the reason. Good moist cake though, especially if you made a good lemon glaze to go on it.

I made this cake according to the recipe. Except that I used 2 loaf pans instead of a bundt cake pan. I really liked it! I made a wild blueberry sauce to pour over it (used recipe from this website). Turned out great!

So wonderfully soft and moist! I didn't want to buy lemon extract because I have lemon powder so I used 2 teaspoons of that...it wasn't quite enough for me so next time (yes, there will be a next time) I'll increase it...I love a deep lemon flavor. I baked it in a loaf pan that has lemon shapes on it and it really showcased the cake. (I put the extra batter in a 7 inch buckle pan...it was adorable!) I served this cake with the  8-layer Fruit Salad Supreme recipe found on this site... the juice from that soaked into the slices of cake and we all (had neighbors over) love it!

I didn’t have any lemon yogurt so I used vanilla Greek yogurt and vanilla extract. It’s amazing! I’m buying lemon yogurt next time I shop to try it that way too! Thanks for the recipe!

Yum. I'm giving 4 stars because I didn't like the recipe as much the way it's written. I followed another reviewer's suggestion of using 1 cup of sugar and vanilla Greek yogurt. I also zested a lemon in place of the lemon extract and it was wonderful. My whole house smelled of warm lemony goodness. I also don't recommend banning for a whole hour. Mine was ready to come out of the oven at 50 min.

Made this with strawberry yogurt and oil for butter. It came out super moist. The husband is super picky and loved it. The next time we will make a drizzle for the top just for something extra.

I thought the cake was alright but it it lacked the flavour I expected it to had. I could hardly taste any lemon in it at all.

I used vanilla yoghurt and vanilla extract instead of lemon.   I baked it in two  9x5 loaf pans for about 50-55 minutes.      The taste was very good, but it was so flat that I wondered if I did something wrong?    I used the non-stick pans and wondered if that had anything to do with it..
Not sure I will make it again as it did not present very well..

I used only one sick of butter and substituted the other stick with extra virgin coconut oil. I preferred to use the juice and zest of two lemons instead of the lemon extract. And I used plain yogurt instead of lemon flavored. I also substituted half the all-purpose flour with  100% whole wheat and used four eggs instead of three.
No disappointments!

It came out delicious. I followed the same recipe mostly except I used 1 1/4 cup sugar and plain yogurt. It still came out  perfectly delicious.  It is a great recipe for beginners.

slightly stiff batter so added more yogurt (only had vanilla flavoured) until runny cake batter. also used orange essence as didn't have lemon. lovely and moist. needed longer to cool in tin before trying to turn out. very sweet - could have done with less sugar.

I enjoy baking breads and cakes for my husband to have in the morning with his coffee.  I have been testing recipes in my Ninja Cooker in preparation for a long road trip in the RV, and decided to give this a go.

Changes made were:
1 cup of sugar instead of 2
1 cup of coconut flour and 1 cup of regular cake flour
Plain yogurt instead of flavored
The juice of 3 meyer lemons and lemon zest from our garden
1 tsp. of real vanilla

I preheated the cooker for 325, poured the batter right in, and baked for 1 hour.  The bottom was a little darker than I would like, but the cake was perfectly moist and very lemony.  Next time I will lower temperature to 300 degrees and bake it a little longer.

Made vanilla flavored for family preference. Nearly doubled the amount of yogurt after reading reviews and was really happy with the results. Sweet and moist while still having the density of a pound cake. Husband said it was the best he'd ever had. Icing or glaze is completely unnecessary, which makes it even better in my book.

I made this in a decorative 
Bundt pan and then glazed the surface with a lemon glaze.   Received great reviews from all and nothing left after 1 hour.  I will definitely make this again.

Delicious! I used vanilla extract and vanilla yogurt instead of lemon, this came out great. My father in law, who doesn't much care for cake, went back for seconds and then thirds. The texture of this is pretty unique; the outside gets nice and caramelized, while the inside is quite moist but not as dense as most pound cakes I have had. At first, I didn't think it was coming together, because when I checked on the cake towards the end of its baking time it was oily and grainy, but after another 5 minutes or so it worked itself out and was cake! I will definitely be making this again.

I made it and it was great! Made lots of changes but the original recipe here inspired it. For one loaf pan, I essentially halved the recipe: 1.5 cups flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 2 eggs, 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 3/4 cup of 0% Greek yogurt, 1 tablespoon of zest, and 1/4 cup of lemon. Very lemony, very good! 50 minutes and it was done. Yummy!

This is so delicious! The  crust is so yummy  and crunchy. The inside is so moist. I took other members' advice and used 3/4 cup sugar,  vanilla extract and plain yogurt as we didn't have the lemon flavoured ingredients.  It was the perfect sweetness for us.

I used a total of 12 oz of yogurt and cut the sugar by about 1/2 cup.  I could not find lemon extract at our local store, so I used the juice from 1/2 a lemon as well as lemon zest. On top I used a raspberry lemon compote. This recipe could surely work as a base for other flavors. It came out beautiful and I will be sure to make it again!

OMG! I used vanilla instead of lemon and these are awesome!! I also made them into cupcakes and cooked them at 350° for 18-20 min and they came out great!! I also tipped them with a cherry butter cream frosting!! I don’t like cherries but my husband and son do and they loved them!! So I just got to eat the plain cupcake and I already want to make more tomorrow just for me. It was almost like a angels food cake. YUM!!! I used Greek yogurt

This was good. My eight year old stepson inhaled his. I knew I was going to drench the cake in lemon syrup so I cut the sugar in the recipe to 1 ²/3 cups. Baked it in a 9x13 pan. Will make again but will also keep looking for the ultimate lemon cake.

This is at least the 5th time I've made this cake. Always a hit. I have made a few changes: I use vanilla yogurt, lemon and vanilla extract, and I always add the zest of one lemon or orange depending on what I have on hand. Sometimes I add a light lemon glaze.

I made this and it was delicious! I ended up using an it more yogurt but it came out fluffy. I was a little concerned when I put the batter in the pan because the batter was quite thick. Definitely keeping this one in may baking rotation.

I didn't have lemon extract, so I used the zest of 2 lemons and the juice of one.  The yogurt I bought came in 5.3 oz containers, so I just used 2.  I cut the sugar in half (used 1 c) and it was just fine, I can't imagine how sweet it would be with the full 2 cups!  Baked in a loaf pan for about 70 mins and served with a blueberry sauce.  Very good!

Very good! I made mine with coconut flavored yogurt and used coconut extract. I dusted it with powdered sugar as the top wasn't beautiful. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe! I substituted margarine for butter. The cake was dense and moist. I ate it 2 days after making it and it didn't dry out. Will definitely be making this again, looking forward to getting my kids involved as it is a pretty easy foolproof cake!

This is a great tasting cake! I made the recipe basically as written. I didn't have enough margarine on hand, so used half margarine and half canola oil.  Also I didn't have lemon yogurt, so I used light vanilla Greek yogurt and then squeezed in about a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice (omitted lemon extract). This is probably the sweetest tasting cake I've ever eaten without frosting or glaze. I made these as cupcakes and the family loved them as perfect sized snack treat. Next time I will probably cut back a little on the oil and sugar, by a quarter cup each, this cake is  super moist (stays moist for at least 4-5 days) almost a tad greasy.

Second time I have made this, I love this recipe because it's simple and delicious!  This time I adjusted it to suit my tastes. I decreased the sugar to 1.25 cups, used authentic strained greek plain yogurt (thick), and flavored with zest of 2 lemons as well  as juice of 1/2. I also used real butter but only 3/4 cup.
The color, texture, density and flavor were all excellent!! I will never purchase pound cake again...
Thanks for sharing

I didn't have lemon yogurt on hand but used orange instead. This is a wonderful cake with a very delicate orange (or lemon or whatever) flavor.  I made it in a loaf pan and next time, I will make sure that it is thoroughly greased ahead of time. I thought I had done a good job but it stuck to the pan in spots despite 15 minutes of  cooling time. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Made as directed except for the lemon (used extra vanilla and plain yogurt because husband doesn't like lemon) and baked in mini bundt pans. Cakes were moist even though they were too big (my fault as I didn't know how much batter to use in my new pan). Served to guests with ice cream and strawberries. Everyone loved them.

usually make 1/2 recipe, with 1 egg and 1/4 less sugar with plain yogurt and vanilla extract.  Recipe is forgiving with substitutions.  Kids devour it every time.

I made this pond cake using 1/2 yogurt and 1/2 sour cream because I didn't have enough yogurt. It turned out pretty nicely. I wish my altitude wasn't an issue(am 7k above sea level) because I never can tell, even with the appropriate modifications having been made, if any issues are my fault, the recipes or the altitude creating a shift in pressures that the food just cannot adjust correctly to.

My family enjoyed this cake very much.  I made as directed.  I did make a little icing from confectioners sugar, lemon extract and half and half not because the caked needed it but because the cake unfortunately got a little stuck in my bundt pan and needed a little cosmetic help.

Yes, I ended making a couple changes only because I didn't have any more yogurt, so I used sour cream 1/2 cup, then 1/2 cup cream cheese.  Then I was short on butter, needed 1/4cup more so I used coconut oil.  With all  that this turned out to be the best pound cake I have ever eaten.

This was an amazing, forgiving recipe that I will use again. I messed up many times during the processes of making my cake but even so, in the end, it ended up perfect and amazing! I used extra virgin olive oil, tangerine jam and vanilla extract. Next time I will make sure to add more baking soda (I accidentally added half the amount) and I will also use butter instead of oil. But seriously guys, if you want something unique and extremely easy You MUST try this awesome cake!!

I used 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour, 1 cup unbleached, 1/4 less sugar, vanilla yogurt, and lemon peel instead of almond extract, and it came out great! We live at 9,000 feet so used only 1-1/4 tsp. baking powder and slightly less than 1/2 tsp. baking soda. Upped the oven temp to 360° to help it set up faster so it didn't fall too, cooking it 5 min. less than recipe says. Put the juice from the lemon and confectioner's sugar together to drizzle on top. Excellent!!!

Very easy and delicious recipe!  We reduced the sugar by a 1/2 cup and thought it was perfect.  I also used Butter flavored margarine to keep the fat and calorie count down.  I didn't have lemon yogurt, so I used low fat yogurt 1 tbsp of lemon  juice and the zest of 1 lemon in the recipe.  I also made a syrup glaze for the top (made it in a square 9x9 pan and a few small petit four size cakes)    The glaze was 1/4 cup of lemon juice, zest of 1 lemon, and 1/4 cup of sugar, brought to a simmer on the stove.  It it was reduced and glaze consistency.  I let the cake cool in the pan, then when it was just barely still warm. I pricked the top with a fork, and brushed the glaze on slowly bit by bit, so everything had time to soak in.  It is by far one of the most delicious, and refreshing deserts ever.   Next time I might reduce the sugar another half cup and sub splenda.  A very yummy treat!

I made this for a Super Bowl party and it received rave reviews.  It's as moist as a boxed cake, but made from scratch.  Kudos!

I thought this was a great recipe.  Easy and super rich.  I added a banana and doubled the banana.  Next time i will use two bananas, and use half the sugar.  Thanks!

Love this. The texture of the cake is lovely. Its not heavy and very light on the palate. The Lemon flavour was not overpowering as well.

One of the best/easiest cake recipes ever!  I used Coffee yogurt and vanilla extract.  Added in mini chocolate chips to the flour mix - turned out fantastic!

Great cake.  Easy to make and loved by all in the family.  I cup the sugar to 1 cup and it made a wonderful cake that wasn't so sweet.  I didn't have lemon so I used key lime yogurt.  Great flavor.

Delicious! I cut down the sugar to one cup, used butter instead of margarine and cut that down to 1.5 sticks. Also, I used one tsp of Vanilla extract and one tsp of lemon. It was so moist and delicious! It got many compliments.

4.5 stars. This is an easy and delicious cake. Beautiful thin crisp crust, soft and tender inside. Twelve servings will make less than ten cups of cake, so I didn't get the full design of my bundt pan. But I think loaves are the way to go, more of the yummy crust.

A simple way to use up yogurt. Moist and very cakey. Used 1.5 cups of sugar instead of 2. Will definitely make again!

I've made this cake a few times and it always turns out moist and delicious. I've also made it with vanilla extract and vanilla yogurt instead of lemon and my family loves it even more. Good, versatile recipe.

A wonderful cake!  I made a few modifications:  butter instead of margarine, only used 1 cup of sugar, doubled the amount of lemon extract and added 1 1/2 cups of lowfat lemon yogurt.  This cake was demolished within an hour of being cooled.  Delicious!

Probably one of the best cakes I've had in a while, with a few minor adjustments. Didn't have lemon yogurt so I used fat free vanilla & strawberry, and double lemon extract. I also used a lemon and confectioners sugar glaze like suggested before. I don't think there will be any left for lunch tomorrow.
Thanks for the delicious recipe!

This was so good, I made it 3 times in one week.  I used vanilla extract and vanilla yogurt and it was fabulous.
