This is very good! Really love the flavors, but my only problem was that the grease/liquid never evaporated enough, so I did have to end up draining it, which was fine (the flavor was still there), but I thought it would all cook down better. I would call this more of a bacon 'topping', b/c to me a jam or chutney would be thicker and more on the sweet side, IMO. Anyways, I think next time (yes I will be making this again), I would drain some (if not most) of the fat from the bacon before adding the onions, butter and garlic so maybe the bourbon would evaporate better. Thanks for sharing. :)

Get the good bacon! We're talking a meat here. My first go around came out bland but I knew there was some minor tweet to make this exceptional. I got some better quality, thick cut bacon and it came out much better. Smothered a hamburger with this chutney and really added something.
