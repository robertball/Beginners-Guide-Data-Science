This salad tastes good but I ended up leaving many of the ingredients out or lessening portions because of the calorie count per serving.

If you don't like cumin, this dressing is not for you.  Although not all my company enjoyed it, I loved the dressing.  My salad consisted of out-of-the-bag spring greens (mesclun) and baby spinach onto which I tossed a couple of handfuls of blueberries, red and green grapes and mandarin oranges.  The salad was surprisingly delicious.  If I had added chickpeas and a piece of bread, I would have considered the salad a complete meal.  To save calories and fat just omit the cheese and peanuts.

The cumin just doesn't belong.  I'll keep looking for a citrus-ginger dressing.

This salad has beautiful colors.  I love that it's healthy.  I didn't have cabbage or cauliflower, so I left it out, but it was still delicious.  I would have loved the crunch from the cabbage though.  I might use sliced almonds instead of peanuts next time, as I think it would compliment the salad even better.  Make the dressing ahead of time, so the flavors have a chance to blend and don't forget the cumin!  It adds wonderful flavor the dressing.
