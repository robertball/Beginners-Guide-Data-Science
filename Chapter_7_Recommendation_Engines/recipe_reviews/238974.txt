Super simple, and came out delicious! I did reduce the amount of olive oil to just 1/4 cup to reduce the calories per serving, but that did not seem to hurt it any at all. Great recipe, thanks!
Ps, I'd suggest a garnish of a basil leaf and a drizzle of creme fraiche

I tried this recipe twice and it is such a nice combination of flavors I don't know that I'd change a thing. The basil is the perfect touch. I served this at a party and it was a huge hit.

I didn't change a thing on this recipe and we love it!!  I've made it twice in the past month using the produce from the weekend farmer's market near me and the fresh basil in my herb garden and everyone who has tried it has loved it and asked me for this recipe.

I used mint instead than basil, it is just as good.

Holy cow, this is amazing! Made with zucchini and cucumbers from the garden, just a delicious summer dish.
