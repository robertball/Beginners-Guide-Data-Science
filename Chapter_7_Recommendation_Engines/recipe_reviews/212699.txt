This is a delicious soup. You'd probably want to add more bean paste (just put in to your liking-- taste as you go), and while you're at the Asian market, pick up anchovy powder (my package says "Iriko Dashi Shimaya", or you can ask the grocer for the fish powder used in 'TEN-johng-chee-gay').  The friend who taught me to make this soup uses it in hers, and it's a magic ingredient that enhances the flavor of the soup but doesn't make it taste fishy.  You only need to add a teaspoon of it or so.  Good luck!

My mom is Korean and it tastes just like she makes it.  I've used this recipe several times and my family loves it just as it is.
