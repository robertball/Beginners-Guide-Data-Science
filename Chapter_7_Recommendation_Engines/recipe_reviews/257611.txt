Made this exactly as instructed, and it was delicious.  The reason I docked a star is that it took SO LONG to get the ingredients together.  And that was using frozen riced cauliflower.  Now, I’m not the fastest food preppier, but not the slowest either.  That said, once it was finally done (over an hour later), my husband and I loved it.  He is trying to control blood sugar so we are trying new things, and I will definitely make this again.

Pretty much stuck to the recipe.  The only thing I may change the next time is make the cauliflower rice separately and put the chicken and veggies on top instead of mixing it all together. I did think it was a bit salty for me, but my family thought it was ok. I will make it again.

I always follow the recipe the first time out. This is fantastic! (I should say here that I did find the cauliflower ‘rice’ at my local grocery store & I believe this made prep easier) I’m going to try this again with my own modifications...like vegetables in the ‘rice’ ..but everything else will likely stay true to the original. Thank you for sharing this!

First time making cauliflower rice; VERY good. Prep is time consuming, but result was worth it.  Used yellow sweet pepper instead of carrots—good. Had various garlic-related items in the fridge (ramps, green garlic), added those too.  I think you could add most anything and it would be good.

Lol how do you say good in Chinese? I was skeptical at first cause this sounded like something served in a restaurant in a gentrified neighborhood but it’s really good. I would like to note it takes a while to prep!!!

I  halved the recipe but the next time I’ll only half the chicken and cauliflower and leave the rest as is so it’ll  have a greater flavor profile. It was great!

Pretty nice recipe. I made my own "rice" but left in the core because it adds crunch and eliminates waste. I used romanesco cauliflower so it was a beautiful green color. The method is quite simple and true to times. I thought it needed some zip so I added Sriracha and garlic chili sauce to the scrambled eggs. I also added white pepper. Thank you for the recipe.

The cauliflower became soggy when I added the frozen peas and carrots which was a disappointment.  If I were going to make this again I would thaw the carrots and peas and drain any moisture from them before adding.  The flavor was good, but the sogginess was a game changer.

I had extremely high hopes for this recipe and was super excited when I found it. I love cauliflower rice and have cooked with it many times professionally and at home. I had an absolute disaster with this one, and it may have all been an operational error, not the recipe. I don't own a wok so I just used the biggest metal pan that I have. This pan is not the best and the caulflower kept sticking and was just becoming aanoyingly mushy.  I had it on med-high heat, but I think my pan was too big for the burner on my stovetop so it wasn't heating evenly. Just a complete disaster. The pinneapple and the chicken were the only saving grace for me. The pinneapple brings a beautiful sweetness to the dish and I was able to find one that was perfectly ripe. The chicken was full of flavor and tender. I doubled most of the ingredients except for the brown sugar, and I think that was appropriate. Definitely give it a shot, but, make sure you have the proper cookware to achieve  "friedrice" and not "musshyrice". This recipe has a lot of potential, if someone really nails it, would appreciate some advice.
Happy cooking!

It was all right. Not as weird as I thought the combination would be, but there is really a lot going on. I'm pretty shocked by the amount of soy sauce that goes into this though, and I feel like this all needs more time to cook together.
