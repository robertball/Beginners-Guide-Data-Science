This was excellent!! 
I made very minor changes: cooked the red cabbage in a pan for about 5 min, just to soften slightly. Used fat-free sour cream. Also, added cilantro to the slaw and as a garnish on top. I don't believe the recipe instructions included what to do with the cilantro.
This was the perfect dinner for a hot day!!

I make fish tacos all of the time with tilapia sprinkled with a Louisanna style rub! My husband loves a little kick so I am anxious to try this recipe! I would use Greek yogurt instead of sour cream though.

My family loves this recipe! We are not big fish eaters usually, but this dish has become a regular in our house. I don't like having to deal with the fresh jalapeno, so I subed for the jarred sliced kind. I just added the juice to the oil and it tasted great without too much heat. I also chopped some of the jalapenos up and added them to my sour cream mixture along with a couple of tablespoons of the jalapeno juice. I like to go ahead and add the cilantro directly to mixture too. Instead of cabbage I chop up romaine and add on top of the sour cream sauce and fish :)This recipe is also great with pacific snapper!

I made these even healthier since we had the gas grill going with some corn cobs and grilled the fish. Just put the slices on an oiled foil lined cookie sheet and drizzled some fresh lime and creole seasoning. They cooked up to a perfect flakiness at 425 degrees in only ten minutes. The sauce just needed more flavor, was very limey tasting, and I had some chipotle peppers in the fridge, so I chopped one and put it in the sauce that went on the slaw, boy was that ever good, but not too spicy.  I made my slaw up early in the day and gave it time to marinate. I did use the plain sauce as a topping without the chipotle in it. These were so very good and really easy to make and. Served with some juicy Florida corn on the cob.

This was amazing! I was somewhat worried if I would like the flavors together, but everything came out great. The jalapeno really made it over the top yummy. I will make this again soon! Thanks for sharing!

I made this with shrimp instead of fish because that's what everyone in my family likes... I used Blackened Seasoning on the shrimp when I sauteed it, the rest of the recipe was the same...loved it!  My son who is home from college saw me making the sour cream/lime dressing and said the restaurant where he works (in Lubbock, TX) makes this to serve on enchiladas.  It was great on the slaw and as a topping for the tacos. Will definitely try this with Tilapia too.  Great recipe!

Pretty much stuck to the plan, with one exception. We used white corn tortillas instead of flour. We are watching calories, and every little bit helps. Great recipe, easy to put together, and tasted great. Thanx for posting this.

These were very simple and quite delish! I really only made a couple of simple changes. Because my family likes sour cream, I doubled that. Additionally I fried the jalapeno and fish together, not discarding anything when it was done. It added a perfect flavor for us.

I've never made fish tacos before and this recipe was incredible! I thought it'd be good but the slaw was so flavorful and it has just the right amount of bite. I fried up cod and it came out perfect. Went over so well it'll definitely be a staple meal here, thank you!

This was fantastic! I accidentally added the cilantro to the cabbage slaw but that turned out to be a good accident. And I used breaded tilapia that I baked, so I can't review on that aspect. But the cabbage slaw and the remaining mixture, I believe are what pulled it all together. Will definitely use this again. It was a hit all around the table.

This has quickly become one of my favorite recipes! If you have time to let the cabbage sour cream mixture set in the fridge for a while it's even better.

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes for a weeknight meal. Easy to make and really, really tasty! I bake the tilapia at 350º and with olive oil spray and add a little lime juice and zest. The fish comes out in about 8 minutes perfectly cooked. I also tried shredded green cabbage instead of red, and really liked the mild flavor of the slaw. I also added cilantro to the mix and as a garnish. The whole family loves these!

Good recipe, but we had problems getting our fish "golden brown." The fish cooked in the given amount of time and flaked nicely, but did not turn golden brown or crisp up like we were anticipating. Since it wasn't crisp, it got a little lost in the cabbage mix when we made the tacos. Overall great taste, and we will try it again with flour or breading on the fish to get it crispy. One other note - we used green cabbage instead of red and it tasted good, just make sure to cut the cabbage into very thin strips. Finally, the recipe doesn't say what to do with the cilantro, so we used it as a garnish.

The fish was delish!  I doubled the slaw and glad I did.  We liked it so much that we had it the next night as a side.  The only change was greek yogurt for the sour cream per another review.  Light and yummy.

Very tasty.  Slight changes were instead of red cabbage (grocery store was out of it) I used broccoli slaw and the texture was perfect.  Also used flounder and no jalepenos were used.  My husband is my worse critic and he loved the flavor.  Did add some Penzey salt free spices too. Definitely serving this again for a meal.

I didnt have cabbage, so I used green leaf lettuce, and cut up tomatoes and sprinkled them with lime salt (the kind you use for tequila shots)and for the fish I sprinkled Cajun seasoning on it and lightly covered with Italian bread crumbs, and broiled them 10-12 mins each side.  For the toppings I used the lettuce and salted tomatoes, and added guacamole and sour cream. Very delish!

I made this for a healthy dinner choice it was really good and my husband loved it, next time I make it I might cook the cabbage a little and cook the fish before I cut it up to make it more flaky but the recipe was wonderful and we added some mango salsa on top.

This was so good! I took the leftovers to work and my coworker raved! I followed the directions pretty accurately. Added avocado and shredded cheese at the end. I could eat the slaw just by itself. Yummy!

This was pretty easy and really good. I skipped on the red cabbage since i didnt have any, added some cooked bacon strips as well as sliced avocados and the bacon makes a huge difference. I did run short on the sour cream so id advice to double up on it, Other than that this is a great recipe and i will be making it again, Maybe with some grilled chicken next time

This was definitely a winner!  Raves by all even the non-fish eaters.  Put different toppings on the table and people helped themselves.  Added a little chile into the mix.  Fish cooked up fast and dinner was done.  Will make again and again.

My fiance and I love this recipe.  We used regular sour cream and also tripled the sauce.  We also halved the cilantro.

These were great! I used fresh cod and blackened it. Mixed some cilantro in the slaw too and used corn tortillas. Also chilled the slaw for a bit while cooking the fish. Next time I'll make extra sauce sauce for the topping. Delicious!!

Delicious!  I omitted the jalapeño (didn't have any), and instead sprinkled some ground chili pepper in the sour cream and on the fish before I fried it.  Fried the fish in larger pieces, just because I find it easier, and then broke it up to put into the tacos. Easy!! Served with Mexican rice.

This did not come out well at all. I made it exactly as per the ingredients/instructions. The sour taste was too overwhelming and the cabbage was too hard and didn't go well with the fish. Won't be making this again.

My wife made this for dinner tonight, I was a little skeptical because I don't like slaw mixes at all, but it came out very good. This is definitely going to stay in the recipe box for our family.

The fish was a little spicy, so for my kids I did half the batch infusing the oil with garlic instead of jalapeño. It was also very good.

Absolutely fabulous! Next time I will put more pieces of jalapeño in with the fish when I sauté them, because they were awesome to eat (not too spicy at all). This recipe is a keeper!

Simple tasty and pretty healthy if you get low fat tortillas.  Between the two of us we pretty much ate a whole raw cabbage in one sitting.  I pan fried some mahi mahi in light oil, added extra jalapenos for kick.

Very good and easy.  I used canned green chilies, and maybe that was a mistake, because I thought it could have been a bit spicier.

AWESOME!  I still can't believe how QUICK and EASY this was to put together and the flavors were truly delicious.  I am definitely going to add this to my arsenal of speedy week-night dinners; there's nothing to it!  My husband raved throughout the meal about how much he was enjoying it.  I served mine with black beans, also.  Thanks so much!

I have to give this three stars because the fish really did not have any flavor, only the slaw did.  The slaw was nice, you could really taste the different flavors.  I will probably just use the slaw as a side for our next meal.

Four stars because it was really simple and quick to make. Talapia was on sale fresh, so cheap too. I substituted preshredded rainbow slaw (broccoli, green and red cabbage, carrot). halved a lime and squeezed half into the slaw mix and half into separated sour cream. unnecessary to seperate and spice sour cream for topping - sort of bland and didn't make a huge difference. Followed slaw instruction and it seemed bland, so I added extra green onion, cilantro, some diced banana peppers I had on hand and a slash of insanity dave's habanero hot sauce. (i'm 8 months pregnant with terrible indigestion and it just did enough to give it a kick w/o being too spicy.) Cooked the talapia with fresh jalapeno in the oil but used Tony's Creole Seasoning instead of just salt and pepper. Yum! Husband ate four big tacos, but agreed even with my additions it was sort of bland so he had them swimming in hot sauce. Definitely think the amount of lime should be increased, especially if you aren't using a hot sauce for flavor, and perhaps added to the fish while cooking. Otherwise, pretty good dinner for taking less than 20 minutes!

I was motivated to make this because I had mango salsa and fish. But I think I would have liked the salsa better if I had made it.  I used it for fish taco's and it was wonderful. I cooked it on a pizza pan with holes on the grill and it worked out great. I also used the same marinade for chicken and I liked it too.

So delicious! Made a few changes as per my preference. I zest the lime, and I only use  1Tbsp lime juice for the slaw. Half of the zest I put in the slaw, the other half in the reserved sour cream. I use 1/4 cup sour cream for the slaw and 1/4 for additional topping. Put the cilantro in the slaw to taste, then add on a bit to the tacos later. Only use white and light green parts of the green onions. I also love throwing some bread crumbs on the fish before cooking!

This sauce is amazing! My husband loved it too. We had extra fish for a second meal, but not enough sauce. I had to make more of this delicious  sauce for hubby. It's been several months since I made this and while looking through recipes, I ran across this one again. I decided to make it again tonight with fresh fish. I decided this recipe was worth writing a five stars rating review! I will only give five stars without any alterations. Once a recipe has been altered, it's a new recipe. Too many cooks have been burned by positive reviews from following the original recipe and not getting the results of a five star rating.  Who has time to read hundreds of recipes reviews to get it right. This recipe truly deserves five starts!

This  dish really is quick and tasty! 

I did make a few substitutions. I switched flour tortillas for corn tortillas, which really gave it the restaurant taste. I also didn't use the jalapeno because I foolishly made it for the kids also - who are super picky (1 and 4 yrs).  

I topped it with fresh tomatoes and a yummy cilantro lime salsa from Aldi.

All of my ingredients were purchased from Trader Joe's, which I swear is one of the best spots for quality ingredients. 

I will most certainly be making this again!

The only change I made was to add a little sugar to the slaw just because I like it that way.  Really great recipe.  It's all about the slaw.

This turned out great! The slaw was a nice break from normal taco sauce. I chopped up the other half of jalapeno and cooked with fish. I also added chili powder and coriander when cooking the fish.

I added a little more lime juice (fresh) and used plain, lowfat yogurt instead of sour cream.  I used a type of chili pepper since we had one in the freezer. I also added some garlic powder to the sauce. The whole thing turned out so well. I MUST make these again!!!!

I LOVED this. The slaw was fantastic. As others did, I added the cilantro to it and used the rest as garnish. I seasoned my fish with cumin and paprika. I had left overs of everything except fish, so I used a chicken breast seasoned the same way and had left overs.

These were so AMAZING. Super fast prep, full of flavor, just perfect. I'd bet that slaw would be killer on a burger too. A new house favorite!

Great recipe! My husband said it was restaurant quality. I used plain Greek yogurt rather than sour cream. Everything else, I kept the same. It's being added to our  normal rotation!

Another quick and yummy meal.  The only thing I will do different next time is grill or bake the fish.  I also added avocado to add as a topping.  The sour cream and lime "dressing" was a great addition!

As far as quick and easy fish taco recipes go, this is great. What I did differently was add cayenne pepper and lime to the fish, corn tortillas instead of flour, and I ate the jalapeño that cooked with it instead of discarding it.

I made a few modifications to this recipe, to be specific, I used Crappie that I caught the same day instead of Talapia. I added Jalapeño sauce and Cayenne pepper dust to the slaw for some heat. Next time I might just use Cerrano peppers instead. I also used a 1/2 and 1/2 of Lime and Lemon juice in the Reduced Fat Sour Cream and let the slaw sit for 45 minutes in the fridge to allow the citric acid to soften the cabbage, which worked very very well. I used low-fat tortillas to help reduce the caloric intake as 2 just isn't enough in a serving. This is an amazing recipe with ultimate flexibility.  I would suggest trying Non Fat Greek Yogurt in place of the Sour Cream and possibly corn tortillas in place of flour if you are truly on a stricter calorie intake.

I made the following changes based on personal preference:
I used flounder fillets (I hate tilapia)
I added the cilantro to the slaw instead of leaving it whole as a topping
I mashed an avocado with a little lime juice, salt, and garlic
I used corn tortillas with mine (to keep it gluten-free) while my husband loved it with the flour tortillas
I used nonfat plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream
This was all on personal preference only, this recipe was definitely excellent to begin with! Thanks for sharing it!

These were very good! I'll be making them again. I doubled the sauce so the slaw was creamier. Easy and light dinner.

Increased to 1/2 Cup reduced fat sour cream. 

In food processor - Combined- Sour Cream, Cilantro, jalapeno (and jalapeno juice), ADDED hot sauce,  and TxJOY steak seasoning (or any creole seasoning) to sauce for better flavor.

Why reserve 1/8 of a cup of sour cream mix for 8 tortillas?  We had to add Mao and a bit of sugar to the slaw and garnished with a little salsa.  Then it was fine.

I had never made fish tacos before  and my boys were very skeptical when they heard. However, we were very pleased with this recipe! Like some of the others, I sprinkled lime juice, salt, pepper, and garlic powder on the tilapia before I baked it in the oven at 400 for 8 minutes. I served additional "taco" toppings that each person individually added. It was easy to prepare, felt fresh, and tasted great!

I sauteed the tilapia in pan w/taco seasoning.  I added taco seasoning and cilantro to the sauce mix.  I sauteed a little onion and garlic and then added the broccoli slaw and just cooked it slightly.  I also added some cumin to it. I topped the tacos also w/ch. tomatoes and ch. avocado.

This was pretty good. I also did shrimp the same night with the fish. The shrimp was much better but the fish was really good. I think I need to leave the jalapeño in round form with seeds instead of mincing it or maybe add more. It lacked the kick we needed because we like spicy food. I shared the recipe with a friend the next night and she made it as well. This was a hit with my family and I will definitely make it again.

This was really good!  I made a few changes.  I used non-fat yogurt instead of sour cream and seasoned the sauce with Spiceology Smoked Honey Habanero and Chili Margarite rubs instead of salt and pepper.  Also added 1 T light mayo to the sauce.  I cheated and used shredded cabbage mix.  This was great with grilled tilapia seasoned with the same rubs I used in the sauce.  Will definitely make again!

Good basic recipe. I used Tony Chachere’s to season the fish and added kale to the slaw. We topped it with avocado and mozzarella cheese. Charlotte loved!

The only thing that I added was some chili powder to the sour cream. We enjoyed it. I will make it again.

I don't normally rate a recipe if I make changes because I think it's unfair to change something then rate it as if you made it as is.  However, this recipe was so good I had to leave feedback.  I was already into mincing ingredients when I discovered I didn't have fresh jalapenos.  So, I used canned--and not just canned--but pickled jalapenos; an ingredient I had in my pantry but had never tried before.  Because the canned jalapenos were mild I also sprinkled the fish with chili powder to put back in some of the zing.  Everything else was done as the recipe was written.  It was delicious.

THIS VANISHED!!!!   Family of 4, (well...6, but I don't think the infant twins count for this review).  I doubled this recipe because I know how teenage boys can eat!  This... DISAPPEARED!  There is enough to make ONE more taco... (yay lunch for me!).  This is amazingly good!  So light, yet so flavorful.  I also, along with others, threw a handful of cilantro into the slaw just to round the flavors out.  I'm SO glad I did! I will make this again!

This was excellent and received thumbs up from all the kids too. The only change I made from the original was to use Adobo dry seasoning on the fish instead of salt and pepper. It's found in many grocery stores in the Hispanic food section. If you can't find it, I'd recommend a sprinkle of chili pepper along with the salt and pepper.

Really enjoyed this recipe. It's become a family favorite, and so simple to make. We leave out the jalapenos, and add other toppings like tomatoes. Also, I don't bother to leave any sour cream mixture separate - keep things simple.

I did make just a few slight changes and still liked it - I put 1/2 cup of sour cream in with 2 tablespoons lime juice, also my mother does not like spicy foods so instead of jalepeños I used a banana pepper. It still tasted really good.

We liked these a lot.  The slaw is really good even by itself (who knew so few ingredients could be so good?), and really makes the tacos.  We did add sliced avocado (pictured, but not included in the recipe.)

This was really tasty and so easy to make.  I would change one thing... I would use all of the sour cream/ lime mixture called for in the recipe to the cabbage mixture and make more of the mixture to add as needed for serving.

Very tasty, very easy.  We're not big jalepeno fans here so I skipped that and dusted the salt and peppered fish with a bit of Piri Piri rub instead and then threw a few avocado slices over the whole thing after assembly.   As others noted, mine cooked a bit faster than this recipe describes and I ended up with a bit more fish and a lot more cabbage than I had cream sauce to support.

Family loved it!  I basically doubled the whole thing, used plenty of lime, salt, pepper, and 1 bag of regular slaw.  I did pre-fry the slaw for a few minutes to soften it as someone else suggested which worked great.  I just folded all the sour cream mixture right into the slaw.   For us, we could have used a little more kick/seasoning on the fish and in the slaw which I'll add next time.  Definitely a winner though!

This recipe was a delicious and easy base for us. We grilled the fish instead of frying it but followed the other instructions for the slaw which was the perfect accent to the fish.

Awesome tacos. Easy and quick. A couple changes i made. 
1. Soaked the fish in milk prior to frying
2. Added more sour cream
3. Stirfried the cabbage quite a bit to soften them.

Very good! Super cheap for ALL of the ingredients+sides at our local Gelsons (about $20).  My husband loved it.

I made it with corn on the cob. It was a nice dinner if you don't want to feel heavy after eating.

We loved it!  We needed more sauce but wouldn't change a thing. Quick, easy and fresh tasting.

Made With a few minor personal changes, (I have a habit of adding my own twist to recipes) but would have been fine just as is. Oh, the only big change was I made with salmon, because it was what I had on hand.  I was worried about my fish choice, but it was a Big hit with the hubby!! He even said that he really liked it with the salmon! Excited to make again!

This was a delicious dish.  I used broccoli coleslaw and softened it up before adding to the recipe.  My family loved it and didn't realize it was a healthy dish.   #winning.

The boyfriend and I really enjoyed the sauces. 
I used tilapia as my fish and cooked in a pan seasoned with pepper, salt and all purpose seasoning with a squirt of fresh lemon. 

*for the sauce did not use lime, I used lemon instead (its what I had) 
I would not halve the sauce, I would keep it all together. There is no reason to dirty another bowl since its both going on the taco anyway.

WOW! This was SO good. It was a last minute dinner and I had everything in the house. So glad I did. I used the tilapia loins from Costco. They are nice and thick so they hold up well. I loved the jalapeno infused oil to cook them in. I also used some Gates seasoning on the fish (kinda like Old Bay meets BBQ).  The slaw was the perfect combo. We all devoured it. Will for sure make again. Thanks for the recipe!

I used Swai fillets (it was all I had); cut them into strips & baked them in a pan sprayed with cooking spray in a 425-degree (f) oven for 20 minutes or so. I sprayed the fillet pieces with cooking spray and sprinkled them with salt, pepper, dried cilantro, and chili powder, and put 1/2 the chopped jalapeno in with them as well. I stirred it around once as it baked.  Otherwise, used green cabbage instead of red, and we topped them off with our favorite hot salsa. I was stunned that not only did my husband like it, but both our sons (20 and 22) actually liked it as well (they complain about fish, usually).

Made it exactly as the recipe instructed (sans the jalapeno pepper)  So GOOD!!!  It tasted identical to a fish taco I had at a really nice restaurant in town.  I imagine the pepper only makes it Better!!!  Will Absolutely make this again!!

This was a good “quick” fish taco recipe with no breading or weird batter requirement. I put minced garlic with the jalapeno while frying the fish and I added tomato and avocado to the cabbage mix. The original is good but I just wanted a little more flavor. My wife loves it and keeps asking me if its taco Sunday again.

These were great!  I used plain yogurt rather than sour cream, and found the end cuts of yellowfin tuna at a fish market (much cheaper that way) which worked great for tacos.  We all LOVED these tacos.

We actually prepared the fish two ways. 

One half per the recipe and the other half using a traditional Fish Fri "breading", which allowed for the creative use of the sauces made,  per the recipe. 

Not only was it delicious, my 12 year old son, who helped cook the meal, has been harassing me to make them again. We loved the tangy-ness of the recipe as well as the crunch of the fried version. 

Definitely a "must try" recipe. :)

I used avocado in the mix instead of sour cream, used white onions instead of green onions, added paprika to the salt and pepper for the tilapia, and used the larger soft taco tortillas and added extra cabbage for a greater cabbage to fish ration, and they turned out fantastic.  Overall prep and cooking was like 40 minutes, so not exactly "quick" or cheap, but the tacos turned out pretty amazing, and foodie worthy.

I'm disappointed because the reviews were good.  In my opinion, the sour cream dressing needed to be doubled.  The red cabbage was too overpowering, even though I sliced it very thin.  I'll continue my search for a good fish taco recipe.
