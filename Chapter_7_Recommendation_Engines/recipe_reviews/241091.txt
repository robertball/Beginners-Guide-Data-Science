This stir fry came together quickly. We just did not care for the sauce so I would add a couple teaspoons of sugar to cut the salty sour flavor and a tablespoon of freshly grated ginger root and a tespoon of sambal to add some zest to the flavor.

Very easy, I did add a 1/2 cup of chicken stock at the end, in addition to the soy sauce mixture.  We like our stir fry with a little more sauce.

This recipe will burn when put the broccoli in at the end. I ended up with raw broccoli and burnt carrots. Put the broccoli in before the pork or earlier. Another option would be to cook the broccoli before you add it to the pan.
Also note that this will make A LOT of food and could easily feed 5-6 people if you put it with rice.

I like salty food, so I enoyed the recipe as is. The one thing I'd say is there was a lot of sauce and the dish could have used rice to soak some of it up.

Used low sodium soy sauce. Baby bok choy. Water chestnuts and bean sprouts. Was delicious. I would add the broccoli next time or double the bok choy!

I didn't have bok choy so used kale instead and it worked well. I found there was not enough sauce for our liking so I doubled the sauce and it was good!

I had all the ingredients on hand, so followed the recipe exactly.  However I found the sauce to lack some zip... too salty.  Finally just doused it with some Sriracha!  Also note, this doesn't work as a left over as all the veggies get soggy.

I used a bag of frozen asian vegetables instead of broccoli. Used napa cabbage instead of bok choy and skipped the chili pepper.

1. WAY WAY too much soya sauce - my recommendation is to cut back to 2.5 tablespoons and then add 1.5 tablespoon of oyster sauce. A stir fry without oyster sauce ...is simply not Asian! 
2. Up the ginger to a tablespoon! You can’t go wrong with more ginger. 
3. Add shallots...also a key part of Asian cooking

This was easy and tasty. Will definitely do again. I scaled back meat and sauce to half (only two people eating) and did the vegetables I had in my fridge: garlic, celery, onion, yellow pepper, carrots, broccoli  and mushrooms...probably about 4 cups chopped total volume.

I used an orange bell pepper, red and Vidalia onion, a little bit of purple cabbage finely cut, and I couldn’t find fresh red pepper at either grocery store I went to, so some Gourmet Garden red pepper “paste.”
My family really liked it, but we decided we might add cashews and pineapple next time!

This has become a household delight - I've made it twice now, and oh is it tasty!  It's equally tasty made with regular low-sodium soy sauce, and tamari soy sauce (the tamari kind is a little less intensely bitter, and has a delightful taste). The steps were easy to follow, and we're all looking forward to when I make it again - even the one person in the house who doesn't like peppers!

One of the best stir frys I have ever made. I did use a red bell pepper instead of the green bell pepper. I can't wait to try this out with beef, and then I will try chicken.  Whoke family loved it!

Made this for my family and they really enjoyed it. I made some changes though.. just because of the things I had. I cooked fresh garlic,butter,onions, and shrimp together in the pan until the shrimp was cooked through. Then I scooped out the shrimp so it didn’t over cook and threw carrots, green beans, and cauliflower in the buttery garlic goodness and let them cooked all together for like 20 minutes. Then I cooked sticky rice in another pan. (Which is super easy.) And our the soy sauce and white rice vinegar in the vegetable mix. It went great!
