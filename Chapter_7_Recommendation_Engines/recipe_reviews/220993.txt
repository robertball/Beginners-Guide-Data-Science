Made this tonight using only bone in, skin on chicken thighs.  I cooked as directed and once I added the potatoes I removed the chicken from the pot to take off the skin and bones, shredded the chicken and then replaced it in the pot to continue cooking with the potatoes.  I am making burritos with it.  It is very yummy!  It could almost use some fresh cilantro and lime juice at the very end to give it a little more punch.

This recipe was flavorful.  I will definately make it again.  It was very simple to make.  I used 3 jalapeno's because we like it hot but next time I'm going to use the 2 recommended in the recipe because it really was too hot.

This is a very good recipe I've made this twice now,  although it does need a little something to kick it up a notch.  I'm adding some hot sauce (2 Tbsp).  I also used pork butt rather than chicken for a little "beefier" flavor.

Absolutely delicious!!! My husband and son both loved it and soaked up the sauce with warm tortillas. I made the recipe as is except used chicken thighs and baby red potatoes. It's excellent the next day rolled up in a tortilla. Watch chef Johns video, it's very helpful in making this dish perfect.

Followed the recipe up to when it came to sautéing the onions. I sautéed them in the oil that was used for the chicken instead, all the while scraping up any bits left on the bottom of the pan. Also, I did not use sour cream, instead I used creme fraiche. Hope this helps and happy cooking!!

Something was missing in the flavor. Had to do a lot of fussing to get my taste buds happy.

Hybridized this recipe with another I found and it was UH-MAZING!  Some changes:

4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (it's what I had).
1 more Jalapeno (2 total), 1 Poblano, and 1 Anaheim pepper (fire-roasted before adding).
1 cinnamon stick.

Reduced simmering time to 40 minutes before adding potatoes and simmered for 40 minutes more.

I just finished having some leftovers of this I made last night.  Really wonderful; thank you Chef John!  I may throw in some corn next time.  To adjust to everyone's different "heat" expectations, I made as written (2 jalapenos), and then set some cayenne pepper on the table for anyone who wanted more kick.  This is fabulous!

This is really good.  We used chicken breasts and adapted the recipe for 4 servings.  One fresh jalapeno was plenty hot for us.  We used tomatillos from our garden that we had frozen.  Great taste and we will definitely do this again!

I roasted the tomitillos, peppers and chicken on the grill. added extra cyan and chili peppers, some cinnamon, cilantro, and lime. and No potatoes. served it over vegi-spiced South-western rice. And topped it with avocado, sour cream, and cilantro. Was a little dark in the green, but tasted phenomenal. I now use the base for several chicken dishes.

My kids and I liked this.  It is a really different take on a comfort food.  The snow is falling and it warmed us nicely.  It does NOT look appealing at all but that is a minor issue.  The only difference I made was that I had frozen some tomatillo, jalapeno and cilantro puree (from my summer garden) which I used and only added half the stock cause I don't like it.
I will make this again...but not on a night that my hubby is home because he does not like meals that don't include pasta as the primary ingredient!

Chicken Chile Verde (should there be some chilis in this recipe?).  Used skinless chicken thighs to avoid skimming fat.  Found that 1 jalapeno was enough.  Not sure if potatoes are the right compliment for this dish; might try some beans next time.  Served over couscous with a dollop of sour cream (guac would be good also).  I'll add some mild chilis to the sauce next time.

I halved the recipe. I didn’t have cilantro, so just omitted that.   I substituted a can of mild green chilies for the jalapeños because we don’t like spicy.  This was easy and delicious. I will definitely make it again.

Really delicious.  Only change to the recipe was I just used boneless skinless breasts instead of a whole chicken.

Be aware, depending on the jalapenos you use it can get pretty hot.  Some people (like myself) like this but if you're serving for someone who's not into spicy food you might want to ditch a jalapeno.

It's not a dish you're going to impress anyone with the looks of, but you will with the taste of it.

I made this dish. but instead of using a whole cut up chicken I used two breasts and four thighs. It was too much meat for the sauce. Next time I'll use just a whole cut up chicken. The flavor was great.
