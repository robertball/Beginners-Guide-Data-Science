I skipped the almonds, and I used strong coffee instead of liqueur because these were made as gifts for my children's teachers. However, they were quite lovely. I did have to chill the mixture between making and rolling it because it stuck to my hands. Also, I suggest the use of a food processor to grind your wafers if you have one. I used a rolling pin over a plastic baggie, and there were light-colored spots in my truffles. Their texture was fine and consistent with the rest of the truffle, but if you are going for perfect presentation, I would say to get the wafers as ground up as possible. These are the first truffles I ever made, and I used dark chocolate for dipping. I found, by making a few other recipes as well, that candy melts give a much more consistent coverage and lay more nicely, so I will likely use them in the future. Very very good recipe. I will make these again and again!

I made half a recipe, and got exactly 24 truffles, so the serving size of 48 is spot on for a full recipe. I only had sliced almonds on hand, and I just toasted them in a frying pan on my stove top, rather than in the oven. Rather than just crushing the vanilla wafers with my rolling pin, I ran those through the food processor along with the almonds until ground into a fine flour.  I used brewed espresso in place of the coffee liqueur, as suggested by the submitter. I melted the semi-sweet chocolate chips in the microwave, adding the espresso right into the chips first - to give the chocolate some liqued to prevent it from scorching in the microwave. It worked perfectly. I dipped some of these in white chocolate, which I had added some WiltonÂ® orange gel coloring to, to make them look like pumpkins. I then made up a bit of brown for the stems and green for the leaves. They turned out pretty cute! The rest of them I dipped in regular chocolate, like the recipe said. I think the pumpkin flavor DOES shine through in these. I think the coffee really enhances the pumpkin flavor as well. Kind of like a pumpkin spice latte! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Used Coffee instead of coffee liqueur added a tad of "Dark" Corn Syrup to Get closer to that signature kahlua coffee liqueur texture/taste. Cooling in the fridge Before rolling into balls recommended, I know it says cooling but some people like me might not get that it means to put it in the fridge for a minute. I thought I had messed up the recipe and was going to use the "goop" for frosting. Went to place seram wrap on it and it was the perfect consistency for rolling :D

A previous comment Recommended "Candy Melts" (it's a brand not melted candy) for an easier, and prettier dipping  experience. I agree. Although I used regular chocolate chips for the inside, wasn't as easy to melt decided to get Candy Melts. 
Was great uwu

Excellent, easy and delicious! I didn't need to change a thing. I made these with my nephew and we delighted in the decadence.

This is good but the pumpkin gets lost in all the chocolate.  I like chocolate hence the three stars.

I did not like these at all. No pumpkin flavor, very odd texture.
