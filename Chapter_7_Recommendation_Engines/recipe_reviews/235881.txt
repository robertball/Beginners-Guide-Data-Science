This is CRAZY!  I love all the ingredients separately, and was pleasantly surprised at how much I LOVED this recipe.  Avocados are a favorite, and it's normal to add tomatoes, lime juice, and green onions for a "normal" guacamole, but the capers gave it a nice salty bite and the tuna adds more!  I don't know where you came up with the idea for this recipe, but it's one I could see myself noshing on with wheat crackers for a healthy and delicious lunch.  YUM!

Like the earlier reviewer, I liked this way more than I ever thought I would. I didn't have scallions, so did a fine dice on 1/4 white onion and added a red bell pepper (again, finely diced). Both of these ingredients helped to make it crisp and fresh-tasting. 
I served it just with crackers and cheese as a snack or light meal.

This was amazing! I wasn't sure how the flavors would blend, but it was a great combination. I put it over roasted eggplant and topped it with cheese and it was delicious.

Excellent as written.  Adults ate it in lettuce wraps, kids ate with paleo crackers. I agree it would also be excellent as a dip with fresh veggies. I did add a few shakes of cayenne pepper and will do that again next time as well.

I really enjoyed this. I used sun dried tomatoes because that's all I had and had no capers :(, but the basic idea is great and this will be a weekly lunch.

This was great! I was a little worried about how the tuna would taste in the mixture but I wanted the protein so I said what the heck. It was AWESOME! Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this recipe to the T.  My husband and I thought this was bland.  I am not sure what would take it over the top for us, but I am open to some ideas:)

I just made this. I followed the directions. I used my food processor & pulsed the avocados & the whole lime. Added 2 teaspoons of salt & pepper for taste. Served it with lime tortilla chips. This tastes awesome!
