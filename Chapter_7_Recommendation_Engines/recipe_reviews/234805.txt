Absolutely the talk of our Thanksgiving dinner! Out with boring sweet potatoes and the sticky sweet marshmallow topping...this recipe is going to be a family tradition. The only thing I changed was the preparation of the potatoes: Bake those bad boys for 1.25 hours on a baking sheet at 325 degrees. Then follow the recipe exactly...perfection. I did use pecans instead of pistachios but to each his own on that.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was a winner!  Here are a few comments that might help other people: I substituted a lemon juice & milk mix for buttermilk (just google "buttermilk substitute" and you'll easily find that simple recipe). I used dark brown sugar instead of light brown, and whole wheat flour.  I used a casserole dish with an 8" radius (smaller than the baking dish shown in the video) and I needed only about half the pistachio-nut mixture to cover the top, so I'm freezing the other half to use when I make the dish the next time.  And one final word, perhaps mainly for novice cooks like me: The raw sweet potatoes were HARD to cut! Don't cut them the long ways first, as shown in the video -- my knife got stuck when I did that. Better to cut the short way through first so you can get some leverage with the knife. They were so hard to cut that I actually nicked my fingers twice -- so use caution when cutting them.
But anyway the dish got raves from folks at our Thanksgiving table.

I have made this for our holiday meals for two years now. It has been specifically been requested for our family get together for Thanksgiving again this year. I make it exactly as written except that I use a little more vanilla extract and I have to use a gluten-free all-purpose flour. I use King Arthur's multipurpose flour and it comes out great. I usually use the pistachios, but have also used pecans and both are delicious. We love it. The pinch of cayenne may sound weird to some, especially if you're new to Chef John's recipes, but don't question it, just do it.

The topping is genius - so good. Husband is allergic to pecans so works out well for us.  The potato mixture is not overly sweet, very tasty but could use more butter to make it a little richer tasting. I will save this for sure.

Good recipe, liked it a lot as others last thanksgiving (2013).... easier for me to bake the sweet potatoes, then scoop out the flesh ... my opinion is that the sweets are tastier and easier to handle.  You'll see it is the way to go.

Everyone raved about this dish. I did not have buttermilk, so I used one-fourth of a cup Greek yogurt instead. I also used pecans on top. It was such a nice change from the marshmallows. Great recipe!

I tried this recipe because it was a healthier version of this casserole.  I thought it lacked depth of flavor.  It was good, just not great.

I made 2 versions. One exactly as written with pistachio crust, the other one as written without pistachio topping. Both were excellent! Definitely a keeper! Thank you Chef John!

I tried this as a side for Thanksgiving '13.  It was delicious, the flavors balanced and came through well with one another.  The crunch from the topping makes it even more satisfying.  The whole family liked it even some who seemed hesitant.

Literally the best sweet potato casserole ever I made this for thanksgiving and every one loved it. I added some leftover chopped pecans in with the topping I had leftover from another recipe. I think it added a variety.

Amazing!  My sister said this is the best sweet potato casserole she has ever had, and it was her favorite dish at Christmas.  I followed the directions exactly.  Since it was for Christmas, I used whole milk and regular buttermilk, which I normally don't do.  It was delicious.  This will by my go-to sweet potato dish from now on!!!

Used pecans for topping.  Felt a little greasy, so may cut back on the butter in the future.

I am a fan of Chef John especially his commentary during his video, LOL and most of my recipe comes from him.  I was really doing my best on this recipe. One advise, do not overcooked the sweet potatoes, follow Chef John advise.  I make a mistake in leaving the it a little too long under the broiler and it burnt:(  Does anybody know what is the best dish to compliment this sweet potato casserole.

Best Sweet Potato concoction of any variety I have ever had/made. The topping is soooo good (I used pecans) and the potatoes were amazing.  Not overly sweet - it let's the potatoes sing naturally. Just perfect.

This is phenomenal! Absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except to make 1.5 to fit a 9x13" pan and doubled the topping because we like extra. I'll be bringing this again next Christmas!

Loved it.  First, you do not taste the cayenne and it isn't spicy hot.  It seems to enrich the other spices and flavors.   Mine did seem to grow!!  I used 5 sweet potatoes (baked them whole for 1/5 hrs at 325), and needed 3 eggs.  I used a small can of evaporated milk instead of buttermilk.  (buttermilk would probably make it even better)  I also doubled the topping mix which I make with pecans (just because I already had them).  I will definitely make again using four potatoes, buttermilk and pistachios.  Thanksgiving dinner side dish...perfect!

I should start by saying I'm Australian, I live in Australia, I've grown up on Australian foods. But we share so many food styles with the US and after a wonderful trip through Florida this year we wanted to add some traditional home style American dishes to our Christmas menu. 
I know this is a side dish, served with the main meal but everyone at the party thought it was dessert. People were adding cream to their slices.
Guests thought I was making some sort of "healthy hidden vegetable dessert".
The recipe was fine, the end result was as per the photos but the dish was perhaps  just too different for our taste buds.

This is better than our traditional sweet potato dishes. I used less than 1/4 cup syrup because we're nearly out and added about a tablespoon of brown sugar. I forgot about the butter so can skip that for sure. I didn't want to buy buttermilk so used half n half in place of it and the milk. I skipped the topping altogether. We had some pecan halves so toasted them and just laid on top before baking. This is so good without all the extra sugar and fat. Rave reviews.

This was quite good.  After tasting the mix I added so coconut palm sugar to lightly sweeten the mix further but not add too much maple flavor and it was quite, quite good.  I also added pecans to the pistachios as one reviewer note and it was fantastic. Will be a staple recipe from now on. Chef John recipes are always the best

Very good, would definately make again. Next time I will make more of the topping, I think there should have beenough more to have completed the whole top of the casserole.  Big hit at my dinner party.

Tried this For Thanksgiving. It was the hit of the table. The pistachio mixture along with the sweet potato ingredients melded together as tho they were always meant to be.

Excellent dish! For family Thanksgiving dinner, I'm always in charge of the sweet potatoes. The family loves the candied yams but I decided to bring this in addition this year as something different.  A Big Hit, rave reviews. I will definitely make this again.

Nice smooth rich flavor. On the suggestion of others, I baked my sweet potatoes and used pecans in the topping.  How much topping you need depends on how much surface area you have to cover. I followed the recipe and mine came out just right. Don't be scared of the cayenne pepper. In my experience, it can easily overshadow other flavors, so I put in a tiny pinch and we couldn't taste it. Next time I will put in more, maybe a scant 1/8 tsp. In the right amount, it should complement the other flavors very well without being hot.  Thank you Chef John for another excellent recipe.

The only sweet potato recipe I'll make from now on. It's perfect. So creamy and not too sweet and that topping. So good. And definitely use garnet yams like he recommends.

This was a hit. OMG, it was good!
I also made chef Johns french onion green bean casserole.
The only down side to these two dishes on Thanksgiving day is that the turkey comes in third place. And I am not talking about dry turkey. It was Alton Brown's most popular turkey recipe which I have mastered and made for at least 6 Thanksgivings.

I followed this recipe exactly - and it was AMAZING!!  Even the family members who aren't big fans of sweet potatoes loved it. The pistachio topping really knocked it out of the ballpark.  I'll be using this recipe from now on!

My nephew loved it and asked for the leftovers.   I prefer a recipe with fresh squeezed orange juice, brown sugar, butter, a little salt.  To me this recipe is on the bland side.

We both (my husband and I loved it !) Changes: inside-3 1/2 Tbsp. Butter, very little regular good syrop + little dark brown sugar; when mashed potatoes were slighty warm, I added 1 Tabsp. flour to the buttered mash and stirred well carefully.  For Crust: I had no nuts. But have discovered that I had in my fridge Dried Sweet Cranberries, and used  them -about 1 cup, added 1/4 tsp. salt and the rest of ingredients as in recipe.

I have a pretty-looking  thick-sided glass baking dish-2 Qt. I took a piece of a Very cold butter and covered with it the bottom and sides of the dish; I then powedered the inside of it with a little dry bread crumbs (unflavored).  Baked for about 40-45 min. and then browned under broil (WITH OVEN DOOR SLIGHTLY OPENED) for about 8 minutes.   The result was outstanding ! Especially-the crunchy topping with cranberries, pie itself was a good consistency, but a bit on a sweet side. I have never eaten the dish before nor made it myself: the cranberries were awesome !   Next time I'll try to use all buttermilk instead of combo of milk and latter and try adding a bit of honey inside, as well. This is a very good detailed recipe and a video. Thank you, John.

A great change from candied yams.I only made two changes to the recipe instead of pistachio nuts I toasted some oatmeal to a golden brown by spray a light layer of Pam and sprinkle them with salt. I also added a little bit of sugar to the mashed sweet potatoes the family just loved it will definitely make this again.

After 20 years of the much-too-sweet usual mashup of sweet potatoes, white and brown sugar, and pecans, I wanted something different.  That recipe was just so sweet, even when I cut the white sugar down to 1/4 cup.  This recipe by Chef John was magnificent and our table of 20 at Christmas dinner asked me to bring it every year.  It has a wonderful flavor.  The pistachios - oh my!  I did not change one thing.  Thank you, Chef John.

No changes. No need. This recipe, as printed, is just the right balance for me. The sweet potatoes against roasted, salted pistachios enveloped so much buttery goodness. My mouth waters just thinking about it. Easily my favorite dish on the table this holiday.

It was very good, and not too sweet.  Four instead of five because the family simply is not that enamored of sweet potatoes.  I would probably use a touch more maple syrup, as our sweet potatoes were more on the starchy than the sweet side and needed some help.  Really liked the pistachio topping!

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner party at a friend's house and it was a big hit, some guests said that they normally didn't like sweet potatoes but loved this dish! No leftovers!
I wonder if pecans on top would be as good and perhaps less expensive

I made this and it was a huge hit. I made two small changes: 1) I used half the white sugar
2) added marshmallows on top and cooked on 350 until they started to melt then turned oven to Broiler setting til they got dark brown and crispy. It was amazing! I also made ahead the day before and put in fridge over night. We chopped our pecans very fine  for the crumble topping and the flavor with crispy marshmallow topping was delish. It was all gone.

I made this recipe last year and it was a major hit. Less sweet than most traditional recipes, this one is a more "adult" tasting sweet potato dish.   The pistachio topping adds an unexpected flavor, really different from the inundated flavors of pecans and walnuts which are so prevalent this time of year.  I am making this one again this year. No changes.

I followed the recipe except used pecans instead of pistachios.  Made it for Easter lunch. Family loved it. Sweet enough but not overly sweet like most sweet potato casseroles

I used pecan pieces, not pistachios, lemon juice + milk instead of buttermilk, and only about 80% of the egg etc. mixture, as I thought it would be a bit soupy otherwise.  Worked out great - rave reviews!

I made it just as the recipe said and it turned out to be just as I had hoped.  It was not too sweet and everyone loved the topping.  The pistachios was a nice change from pecans or walnuts prevalent during holiday season.  I love eating sweet baked potatoes without anything on it too. I love sweet potatoes and I love this recipe.

This was so good.  I have never been a fan of the sweet potatoes with marshmallow dish, so this alternative looked great to me.  It was a huge hit at Thanksgiving and I absolutely loved it.  Definitely going into the keepers pile.

I made this for Thanksgiving and Everyone loved it. I didn't use buttermilk but I'd like to use it next time. The dish was a little too sweet for me and buttermilk may add that tang I love. Love the pistachio topping! Highly recommend this dish!

Excellent. Prepared this side dish for TDay and it was a hit. I vowed to be a little more bold with the cayenne the nex time and I subbed the buttermilk for sour cream. Also, I used agave instead of maple syrup. Made this dish again tonight. Nice segway from dinner into dessert.

I've concluded that 90% of my family is insane and doesn't like sweet taters very much because I and a few others thought these were good. The primary thing is it's really not too sweet. I think, however, that this comes in on a "I can make this for sweet potato lovers anytime and pass" but not on a "I can make this and blow everyone away". It's a quite reliable recipe but definitely not a WOW one.

I roasted the sweet potatoes first -easy peel -and mash -as others noted on this recipe-otherwise I would not change a thing. If you want a non sickly sweet side of sweet potatoes this is it. The  pistachios were perfect addition.  It's worth the effort!

This came out way too sweet.  Next time I make it I will cut the sweeteners in the casserole and the topping in half.

Perfect Sweet potato dish!! Used this for Thanksgiving this year to go with a Rib Roast. I did add an extra 1/2 lb of potatoes, 1 more egg, and 1 tsp of nutmeg, and it turned out perfect.

This is another excellent chef John recipe. I made it to share at Thanksgiving and would not change a thing. Not too sweet and seasoned just right.

I didn't have buttermilk so I used  half and half instead. I also used Pistachios and walnuts on top. It was amazing!!!!!!!!  Everyone absolutely loved it for Thanksgiving day dinner.

Awesome. A little too sweet, but cut back slightly on the brown sugar and you should be good to go.

This was the perfect sweet potato recipe to serve as a side at Thanksgiving! Just the right amount of sweet. I despise sweet potatoes that taste like dessert instead of a side dish...I did make a couple changes to the recipe out of necessity.  I couldn't find pistachios in bulk (at the last minute) so I used pre-chopped pecan pieces. Super Easy!  Also I did not have much time so I used canned sweet potatoes. I ended up doubling the recipe for a larger crowd so I ended up using 110 ounces of canned sweet potatoes (2 large cans and one small) and it was great! (It might have been fine with just the two large cans too-but I was trying my best to replicate the way it looked in Chef John's video!)  I boiled the sweet potatoes in the syrup they came in and then drained well and followed the rest of the directions to a "T"!  It was savory with a deliciously sweet, crunchy topping! I think next time I would like to use some Pumpkin pie spice so that it tastes more seasonal! :) I think this will be my go-to recipe! I will update this when I make it exactly as stated. I am sure it will be even better - Thanks Chef John!

It truly does not get better than this..not a fan of marshmallows or sticky syrup I was elated to find this! As stated it is not overly sweet and you can actually taste the maple and the seasonings that are in it and the tang of the buttermilk adds a wonderful flavor..I also do not like walnuts or pecans so this recipe was a grand slam side dish..Snaps for Chef John !!!

Delicious and topping was unexpected for my family THX meal. We all specifically enjoyed how this sweet potato dish wasn't overly sweet. The pinch, just a pinch of ceyenne pepper was genius. Adds a little kick that helps add some depth and interest. No more sticky/boring sweet potato dishes with the browned marshmallows on top, I feel like I've grown up. Will definitely make this dish again.

A hit! We love that it's not so sweet. I even cut the sugar in the topping in half, and it is still delicious.

My new go-to recipe for sweet potatoes. My family likes pecans rather than pistachios. Nothing but raves from everyone.

Made this for Thanksgiving this year. I was looking for an alternative to marshmallow topping. I followed the recipe exactly except for doubling the amount of topping.  I found the pistachios got a bit soft/mushy which was not really what I was hoping for. I think pecans might have worked better. The sweet potatoes had a consistency that was more souffle like which I was not entirely opposed to but again was not quite what I was looking for. I personally  liked the dish, but was not crazy for it overall.

I have made this recipe for many years and it is now a staple at our family gatherings. The only thing I change is using brown sugar for the maple syrup. I may try some nutmeg and cinnamon next time.
