I have never had chicken with nuts before so I was a little skeptical about trying this recipe but these little puffs are wonderful!  They are soft and slightly crunchy at the same time.  I served them with a honey-mustard sauce for dipping.  They must be served immediately because I found they cool off quickly and get harder as they cool.  I found that they reheat very well in the microwave for next day treats.

Man, what a disappointment! I found these to be extremely bland and had to serve them with a sauce...I think they need to be fine tuned with some better spices.  Don't try these for a big party as your guests will be sorely disappointed.  A lot of work for not so tasty treats.

I really didn't care for this recipe.  I thought they lacked in flavor and were a little dry.  You would think a 1/2 cup of oil would help, but it didn't.  The almonds were a nice touch, but didn't make up for the lack of flavor.  Thanks anyway.

This sounded really good, but after trying the first batch, I quickly added more flavoring.  They are quite bland if the recipe is made as written.  I added 1/2 tsp onion salt, 1/4 tsp garlic salt, 1/2 tsp celery salt, and 1/4 tsp additional red pepper to what was left of the dough.  That helped some, but not enough for me to serve them to guests.  I will try again though, using butter instead of oil and the same spices.  If that doesn't work, I am going to have to scratch this one--but it sounded good, didn't it?

Time consuming.
Extremely well received at a Ladies's Christmas Get Together and what was the big addition was I had a small dish of Cranberry Mustard (purchased from Trader Joe's) I shared the recipe with them.

In reading the other postings, I substituted 1 tablespoon of Mrs. Dash seasoning for all of the listed seasonings.  (It has most of what was called for anyway.)  I also used ground turkey rather than chicken (made it easy to chop after it was cooked - plus it was in my freezer)  People raved about these - I had three people ask me for the recipe right away.  This is a keeper - just change the spices a bit.

My guests really liked these.  I added a little "spicy" all spice, Teriyaki sauce instead of the Worchestershire sauce, and they had a lot of flavor

Not difficult to make.  Very bland, you need to add additional flavoring to suit.  Also, very "heavy" for an appetizer.

Don't let the other reviews fool you, this is an AWESOME recipe!  Of course, if you are used to freezer style appetizers, deep fried appetizers, or anything involving a multitude of Kraft products rolled together, then obviously you won't like the home-made goodness of this recipe.  I don't think this recipe is bland at all... I think it tastes like CHICKEN, which most people over-season so much they've forgotten how it is suppose to taste.  I've served this at several gathering and family affairs and everyone always RAVES about it and wants the recipe.  It's hearty, not over powering, and just makes you feel happy eating.  So for those who still enjoy old-fashioned, home-made, FRESH flavors... Enjoy!

Hey ya'll! I've been gone a while, moving to another state. This was the first recipe I tried in my new kitchen! I had such high hopes for it. It just didn't deliver. I wouldn't say this recipe is bad, it just needs some help. I loved the way they looked, there was just nothing to make you say ummmm! I would like to make it again and tinker with it a bit to get more flavor. Perhaps a dip would be great with it? Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Oh I was hoping these were going to be great but I am sorry to say I wasnt fussy.  I dont know if I did something wrong but they turned out with a distinct lack of flavour I thought.  Maybe I just didnt know what to expect.  So sorry.

I expected great things of this recipe and was sorely disappointed.  I made these and knew instantly, only mustard could save these!  If you like your food to "burst" in your mouth, this isn't the recipe for you!

After reading previous reviews I decided to use turkey breakfast sausage, thinking it would have more flavor than plain chicken....but I was disappointed.  I found this recipe to be "ho hum".  Will not make it again.

Very tasty! My family loves them. I cut the recipe in half and made the puffs a little bigger (I put two squares together) and then I made a second bath with a tablespoon of cream cheese, a dash of milk, broccoli, garlic and chicken and both rocked! Will def. make a gain.

These were way dry and just weird overall. It's too bad, because they sounded good. They actually disappeared at the party that I brought them to, but more out of curiosity than good flavor.

It seems to me that this recipe is one that needs some tweeking to make it delicious.  I have done this with recipes before, and found that if the reviews (which get better as people change them) are best deleted and resubmitted in the improved manner.

They were delicious, and really easy to make. They were a hit, I put nuts because I didn't have any almonds, and next time, I'll even add more. I think that it's important not to overcook them so that they don't become hard.

These are amazing and a unique appetizer.  This inexpensive recipe makes a lot!  I doubled the cayenne pepper and used garlic flavored chicken broth to give them more flavor.  Serve with honey mustard (simply mix equal parts honey and dijon mustard).  Best fresh from the oven but can be made ahead and rewarmed.

I'd have to agree with most of the reviews of the recipe, for the time and expense of putting this together I was very disappointed. They were dry, lacked flavor and did not look very appealing. I even tried making a spicy dip to go with these and my family didn't like them.

The Chicken Puffs were great!  I actually used some spicy chicken with this, the one thing I had to add was more buttery, because the mix was becoming too thick to continueto stir.  Very good!

I took other reviewers' suggestion and added in dry roasted thai chili powder (just a pinch)and sharp Cheddar cheese. I also added garlic powder and a pinch more seasoned salt than called for. The party attendees I served this to really liked it. I thought they were actually tastier at room temp than just out of the oven. Served them a 2nd time with soup for dinner and the family liked them very much. I will save this recipe and make it again. Thanks to Karen Bush for sharing it.

Apart from adding more seasoning and also some garlic powder, I made these as written, and we enjoyed them. I think they would be good with some Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. Thanks, Karen!

I was glad to see this recipe here, which I used a few years ago for a New Year's party.  They were a hit- I served with a few different dips- Cranberry Mustard, and a Honey Mustard as well as a Plum Sauce.
This recipe makes a lot and was worth making it- they were the first thing gone!

I received a lot of compliments on these, but I did add more spice. I think that if I make them again, I will melt some shredded cheese on top.

Hi!  After reading all the reviews I was going to double the seasoning,  but then I thought about my guests who cannot eat spicy foods, and decided to leave it just as written at least for this time.  This was the last dish I made and so my guests ate them hot from the oven  and Boy, this was the Hit of the party.  I made a double batch. The menu was all appetizers and this one is the only one there wasn't a piece left at then end.  I served it with a spicy Chipotle Mayonaise (From the bottle) and so those who wanted a bit of heat could dip them in that.  Karen, these were great!  And easy!  I will make these again and Again!

This recipe was not what I expected.  I think adding some shredded cheese or cream cheese could improve this recipe.  I had many leftover, and served them with gravy on top and they made a tasty meal that way.

I had to substitute celery flakes and Tex Mex seasoning, AND cook them on my George Foreman grill (my oven was out of commission from last night's dinner...long story), but I think they came out even better than if I'd have baked them.  Not dry at all, almost like crab cakes.  The almonds were perfect, too!  I'm definately going to make them again.

5 stars WITH ALTERATIONS. 
I tried the recipe as is and found it, like others, to be very bland. So, I substituted 1/2 lb ground sage sausage (Italian sausage would probably be great too) for the chicken. I only used about 3/4 tsp seasoned salt and I omitted the cayenne pepper. Boy were they good! The sausage really made the dish. This will go in my keep pile for sure.

I read the reviews prior to making this appetizer, and I added about 2 teaspoons of Creole seasoning.  I didn't find this recipe to be overly time consuming.  My guests really liked this finger food and were very complimentary.

I served this recipe at our christmas party last year and everyone loved them so much, they have asked for the recipe.  I tell them to grab a cup of coffee, log onto allrecipes.com and enjoy looking all afternoon.  Thanks for a great recipe site!

A nice substantial appetizer to bring to a potluck party. I feel it needs a little more kick than as written. . . More cayenne or Worchestershire, or something else, perhaps.

Didn't work out so well. There was something missing for me, though they were easy to do and would've been great finger food if they had had a little more flavor...too bland.

This was the First time i made this recipe so I went  exactly by the recipe.
Very interesting mix of chicken and almonds.
