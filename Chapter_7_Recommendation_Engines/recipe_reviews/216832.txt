These were great and easy.  When you first mix up the cream cheese filling it tastes a little spicy, but once you stuff and top the mushroom it isn't at all.  I ended up making these twice in two days they were so good.

I am still making these.  People beg for them!

Truly delicious! I followed as listed and had enough to use 4 (8oz.) packages of white mushrooms. A keeper and WILL DEFINITELY make again!

These were easy and very good.  I only made half a recipe.  1/4 of the total recipe filled 8 oz of mushrooms.  I then froze the cream cheese mix that was remaining.  Two days later I used the rest in some more mushrooms.  This was a great amount for 3 adults at each of the two times I served them.  I also want to just mix the melted margarine with the stuffing next time before dipping the stuffed mushroom into it.

These are really yummy!
These are the changes I made.
    Did not use the ground red pepper
    Added freezed dried tomatoes, chopped
    Used Pancko breadcrumbs instead of the stuffing mix.

People always go crazy when I serve these.   I limited the Italian seasoning to half a packet, and cut down on the parm cheese.  Other than that, these are spectacular!

This was amazing. Made as a valentine appetizer, and my hubby loved them. His only critique was there was to much of a kick. So next time I will omit the cayenne. Also, I used portebello mushrooms.
