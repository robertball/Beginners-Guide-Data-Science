This is a thick sauce. It is ment to be put over potatoes for scalloped potato or a mac & cheese (which gets a thicker sauce). The onions were suppose to say optional next to them. My family loves onions with everything. So if you are looking for a thinner sauce for things like over chicken then definitely use less flour the 1T for every 1 cup of milk.

This was a very thick gloppy sauce. I also found the diced onions in the sauce not to my liking.  I added more milk and pureed the sauce to smooth.. much better although i didnt have any more goat cheese so that flavor was diluted by the additional milk. I posted two photos.. one with the thicker sauce and one with much more milk and pureed. I realize the recipe says  milk too taste but doubling the milk is way more of adjustment and also results in less goat cheese flavor..

I made this sauce and kept it thick enough to use as a pizza sauce. I topped it with grilled steak & peppers, spinach, mushrooms and mozzarella cheese. My kids were begging me to make more.

So I find myself in need of a cheese sauce to stretch my expensive goat cheese for the healthy enchiladas I am making.  I LOVE ALLRECIPIES - you guys are my go to.  

Duh!  

Karrie (I hope that is how you spell your name) you helped me think outside of the box!  

A quick whip of goat cheese, hot water and coconut flour with some salt and pepper made the perfect compliment to my dish!  

Thank you so much.

It was quick and easy. I added some yellow, orange and red peppers, as well as chicken and more milk. I used bruschetta goat cheese (I'm sure any type of spiced goat cheese would work). All was placed on a bed of pasta. Pretty decent.
