I have made this several times now, and have found two main factors that make the difference between this being a 3* and a 5* meal. 1. Use at least 2 or 3 tortillas thick per layer. Otherwise, it gets soggy and mushy. 2. Let the meat simmer with the sauce at least 30 minutes, otherwise it does not meld together. This is a great recipe all in all, though, and I always look forward to making it. It is also a great freezer-to-oven meal. Simply take it out of the freezer and cook it at 350 for 40-50 minutes, or until bubbly. I always divide a full batch into several 11X7 pans, so I can freeze a couple for future meals. VERY IMPORTANT: I FREEZE IN A FOIL PAN...IF YOU FREEZE IN A GLASS PAN, YOU CAN'T PUT IT STRAIGHT INTO THE OVEN, OR ELSE THE GLASS WILL SHATTER. DEFROST IT FIRST.

This recipe was good, but I know I will make several changes next time:  I too will use taco seasoning in the ground beef(no water), and I won't mix the beans in with the meat mixture - makes it too gloppy & all one texture.  I like the idea of spreading the beans on the tortillas, and will definitely use zesty beans.  The new layering order will be: meat, cheese, beany tortillas (bean side down), meat, cheese, beany tortillas etc.  I'm also going to split this into two 9" disposable pie pans - bake one & freeze the other for future use (this is a VERY big recipe). It was pretty good the original way, and I know we'll really like it this way.  Can't wait!

Boy am I glad I didn't follow the advice of other reviewers to cut this recipe in half!  This was absolutely delicious!  Any easy, too!

This is the first recipe I've made in a LONG time where everyone at the table cleaned their plates - and asked for seconds (or thirds in my husband's case!).  With two young kids (3 and 5) this rarely happens (unless we're having hot dogs!) 

Using the same amounts of ingredients as called for in the recipe, I divided it up to make two different casseroles,  a spicier version for me and my husband and a mild version for the kids.  After browning the ground beef and onions, I divided the meat before adding the taco sauce.  I used medium sauce for the adult dish and mild for the kids.  For the adult dish I used all of the same ingredients as called for in the recipe (except olives).  For the kids, I just used tortillas, ground beef/onions/taco sauce, refried beans and cheese.  They loved it!  

Rather than mixing the refried beans into the beef mixture, I used a spoon to spread them on top of the tortillas before adding the beef mixture.  This worked very well and allowed me to adjust the amount to suit our tastes.  I ended up using about 1.5 cans between the two dishes.  

This will definitely become a regular in our house.  Thanks for a delicious, easy recipe that made dinner a very enjoyable occasion after a long day at work.  I can't wait to share the recipe with others.

This deserves ten stars! Absolutely amazing dish. I made this when I was visiting my parents and it was a HUGE hit. None of us were expecting to be so crazy about it, but wow.

I'm trying to cut red meat out of my parents' diets, so I substituted the beef with turkey--without telling them (my dad wouldn't have tried it otherwise). I added some spices--cumin, season all, a couple of different kinds of pepper. I also did as others suggested and used one can black beans, one can spicy refried beans. I would up forgetting to add the taco seasoning, but it definitely wasn't missed.  Instead of taco sauce, I used chunky salsa. I served it with a handful of shredded lettuce, a couple of spoonfuls of fat free sour cream, and extra salsa on the top.

This made a nice sized casserole--I had to cut the tortillas to fit, though, because I bought the extra large ones and only had a...whatever the normal size cass. dish is. It's a very filling meal, and mom ended up freezing half of it, which she told me they plan on eating this coming week. There was *still* enough for us to have left overs the next day--it tasted just as good after a night in the fridge, by the way.

Fat free tortillas aren't your best bet for this, just fyi. I was hesitant about them, so I only used one in the middle, the rest were regular tortillas. Upon later inspection, the fat free tortilla kind of dissolved. So use fat free sour cream and use your fat grams for the cheese and tortillas. It's worth it!

Since there are so many reviews to this recipie, I do not know if this was mentioned. When I made mine and instead of the 4 quart casserole pan, I used two 9 inch cake pans. I am only cooking for two so I froze the other. This was so very good! My husband, a tex/mex food fan, loved it (he added his favorite hot sauce to it since he loves extra extra heat)! No alterations need to be added to this. The ingreidents weren't hard to find and very inexpensive. Preparation was so easy! I served it with tortilla chips, sour cream and salsa. It's a good weekend or Friday night dish.

HELPFUL TIPS AFTER MAKING THIS FOR YEARS: Halve the MEAT but used 3/4th a can of the olives, whole can diced tomatoes & entire can of chiles (can't cut too much out or you won't be able to stack your pie).  Sometimes I add chopped red/green peppers and cut out onions. Eyeball the salsa (use enough to coat the meat) which I use instead of taco s.  Don't be afraid to layer this with 2-3 tortillas starting at the SECOND layer b/c it makes it taste just perfect (like taco bell mexican pizza)! I sprinkle taco seasoning over the beef while it's cooking (awesome flavoring) but not necessary.  It helps tremendously to let it simmer as long as it says because the ingred. start to stick together for a nicer consistency.  Apply a THIN layer of refried beans on the bottom of each new tortilla (i submitted pic), THIN layer of meat, & buy extra mexican cheese b/c you tend to use a lot to layer perfectly!  This made 3 thin layers of meat, cheese, refried beans w/just the right amount to add the last amount of meat on top & have enough refried beans to serve as a side (b/c you only use 1/4th of it).  If you make the full amount, it freezes well, so you can use it for a quick meal!  Update: I cook until edges of tortilla are not soft (almost crisp so never soggy) & people go nuts over this!

This recipe calls for a "large skillet".  That is an understatement.  If you add all of the ingredients to the skillet, you will require a skillet of about 18-inches in diameter or a "rondo" (sp?).  Therefore, I did not add the refried beans to the pan.  Instead, I layered them onto the tortillas first, then the cheese, (which the recipe calls for 9 ounces but isn't quite enough, you need more like 12).  And, I still had 4 tortillas left over after I layered.  She also stated that a 4-quart casserole dish would suffice.  No way.  An 11"X 15" casserole pan is required to use all of the products.  The recipe also stated that it serves 7.  Seven what?? Giants??  I was able to get 12 servings from this recipe with leftovers.  If you want more "spice" than what the recipe states it has, add some jalapeno flavored refried beans instead of the basic and use a HOT taco sauce.  Overall, I'd say the author has a good recipe, but far from perfect.

I made this recipe last night for dinner and it came out great. I halved the recipe and made it in a 9x13 inch pan. I cooked green onions instead of regular onions with the meat, the kids tolerate green onions. Instead of olives I added an 8 oz. can of mushrooms. I used a 7 oz. can of green chilies, we like them a lot. I used 1 whole can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, we like them a lot also. I used 8 oz. of homemade salsa, I always have some on hand, instead of taco sauce. I did use 1 whole can of refried beans, and we did not think it was too beany as other reviewers said. I used cheese to our liking, probably much more than called for. It was excellent! Thanks Kathi for a great, fast recipe!

This is such a nice change from all the regular dinners I cook.  It is very tasty.  I am not a fan of refried beans but the mixture worked well.  My daughter of 5 yrs kept asking "mom, why haven't you made this before?" We topped our mexican lasanga with lettuce, green and red peppers and sour cream.  What a treat! I will be making this alot in the future, esspecially when I am looking for a way to spice up our dinner life.

I'm only giving this one 4 stars because I modified it so heavily.  With the mods it was a 5.  Here's what I did.  First I scaled it in half and used a 13 x 9 pan.  I omitted the diced tomatoes and substituted 1/2 can tomato sauce since my kids aren't crazy about chunks of tomato.  I subbed my own fresh salsa but I think it would be fine with something like Pace.  I also squeezed in a bit of La Victoria red taco sauce for flavor.  I seasoned the meat mixture with 1 Tbsp. chili powder, 1 tsp. garlic powder, salt and lots of fresh ground pepper.  I used the whole can of green chiles (undrained).  I didn't mix in the refried beans or olives.  I sprayed the 13 x 9 pan with cooking spray and then put a very thin layer of meat mixture in the bottom of the pan.  Then I spread refried beans on 2 tortillas and placed them bean side down on top of the meat (overlapped they covered the bottom of the pan perfectly), more meat, cheese, olives.  I repeated this layer one more time ending with meat, cheese and olives on top.  I covered with foil and baked for 40 minutes.  Removed foil, topped with a bit more cheese and baked another 5 minutes.  It was REALLY good!  The main problem I heard from the previous reviewers was that the flour tortillas ended up soggy.  I believe this is because as written there is too much filling and it is too liquidy.  My tortillas were not the least bit soggy.  I will definitely make again with these mods.

Delicous! I followed the recipe exactly and found, as others said, it made a lot. I made two large pans full. We ate one and froze one. Recipe freezes very well!  Both were delicious. I would recommend using more shells than the recipe calls for as well because it can get soggy.

This is a wonderful recipe. I have only 1 comment to add but I'm not sure if others have already mentioned it. I pan fried my tortillas (dry on a non-stick skillet) until they were lightly crispy. This helped decrease the sogginess significantly. Hope this helps, and thanks for the recipe and everyone's helpful comments!

This is my 13 year old's favorite meal and we have it all the time. I do use kidney beans instead of refried bean, add a cup of frozen corn. I use taco seasoning and two cups of water. If you let it simmer long enough the water and seasoning cook right in. You do want some liquid in the filling because it absorbs into the tortillas. This is a huge recipe. I sometimes split it and freeze one of the dishes in a disposable metal pan. Cooks great from frozen. 90 minutes at 325 - uncovered the last half hour. Enjoy!

This was pretty good.  I think it lacks slightly in flavor.  Next time I will add 1 tsp. cinnamon to give a richer flavor.  My husband really enjoyed this so I'll be making this again!!!

This recipe was delicious! The only change I would make next time would be to spice it up a bit with some jalapenos. Otherwise it was great. It reminded us of our favorite food in college-burrito enchilada style-from a restaraunt that is not located in our hometown so it is nice to know we can duplicate it at home now!! Thanks for sharing this great recipe, looking forward to making it again soon!

Great recipe, but my family liked it much better with corn tortillas.  The flour tortillas just seem gummy compared to the corn, and the corn adds a great flavor dimension.  Followed other's suggestions and this is a winner!

I just made this recipe!  It was great.  Based on the prior reviews, I made a few changes:
*used a pack of taco seasoning to flavor ground beer (no onion/garlic)
*Mixed chunky salsa, corn, and diced green chilis in w/seasoned beef (I would prefer jalaps, but dh is a little wimpy when it comes to hot stuff)
*used a round casserole dish to layer, starting w/salsa, tortilla, meat, cheese, tortilla spread w/refried beans, etc
*halved the recipe and it fit perfectly in the casserole....could feed 4-8 depending on hunger and sides
*served w/sour cream

I'm always trying to eat healthier, so I used 97% lean ground beef, fat free refried beans, 2% cheese, and fat free sour cream and it was still very tasty!

This recipe ROCKS! Definitely top 10. I make it at least twice a month & everyone loves it. I've passed the recipe on to quite a few people as well, and they love it! I only make a couple of minor changes, it's excellent as is.... but I add some jalapenos to turn up the heat & I also use a jar of salsa instead of taco sauce. I use refried beans with chiles, and I season my beef with 1 envelope of taco seasoning, but I dont add water. Thanks for a great dinner, and thanks for all the compliments!

This was soooo goood!  And it is one of those perfect pot luck dishes or any other time you have to feed a lot of people or prepare a meal in advance!  Very convenient and very filling.  There is so much flavor in this pie, you really need  no other garnish but we did  top it with sour cream and avocado slices and served it with tortilla chips.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves burritos.  Yummy!!!!  this is a definite keeper.  Thanks.

Very good and easy to make, but a bit time consuming.  It is quite heavy and makes A LOT!  I fed 6 people, including 3 hungry teenagers, and still had about 1/2 left.  Everyone loved it.  Will make again and probably cut the recipe in 1/2.

This was great.  I used salsa in place of taco sauce, and used only one can of ro-tel.  Also, I used the recipe for 12 servings and it fit perfectly in my 9x13 casserole dish.  Previous reviewers said that this made a huge amount, but I didn't think so.  We fed six adults and had a two servings left over.  This is great and thanks for the recipe!!!!

I have made this twice now and both times it was a big hit. I did not use black olives or the chiles in tomatoes. I also used a Mexican blend of shredded cheese instead of Colby, 16 oz total, and black beans instead of refried.   I cooked the beef, drained any fat, added the onions, (1 time I omitted the garlic-didn't have any), cooked for 10 minutes. Then I added the chiles, 1 packet of taco mix, and 20 oz of Southwestern style salsa. I simmered for 15 minutes. I then put it together following a tip by another reviewer: crush the black beans and spread on tortilla. I layered starting with beef mixture, then cheese, then tortilla with beans (beans face down), and repeated. I ended the pie with a tortilla which I smothered with enchilada sauce and then the remaining shredded cheese. I used all mild ingredients. I served it with a side of sour cream. good stuff!!!!

I made this very mild by not adding the can of green chiles and using mild taco sauce.  Everyone really liked it.  This would feed 10 adults in my opinion.

This recipe was really good! Wonderful taste! My husband loved it! I only changed a few things.
1) I used HOT enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce. Enchilada sauce is spicier than taco sauce and also has a better flavor.
2) I spiced up my meat to taste with some chili powder, paprika, cumin, and so on. 
3) I was worried that the flour tortillas might get mushy so here is what I did.  I took a skillet and sprayed it lightly with Pam. I then lightly browned my tortillas on both sides until they were crispy. This kept them from getting mushy or soggy while baking. This doesn't add to the prep time because I browned them while the meat mixture was simmering.

Also, I wanted to add that I had a pot luck party to attend the next day. I had to bring appetizers. I heated up some of the left overs and cut them into bite sizes. I then took some tostida scoop chips (the kind that look like little bowls) and filled them with some chopped lettuce, a scoop of the heated burrito pie leftovers, and topped them off with a small dollop of sour cream. I called them "mini taco salads" They were a hit!!

OK, I read all these negative reviews before Making this.  To eliminate the "mushy" texture I didnt add refried beans to the mixture.  I simply bought two small cans of pinto beans, rinsed and cooked them with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and chili powder, and added the can of diced chiles with them, and a little water. Once boiling I smashed them and smeared them on the tortillas. I doubled the layer of tortillas so the tortillas wouldnt end up a mushy mess. I also used a cheesecake pan.  I added a lot of seasoning to the ground beef, like garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, chili powder, cumin. I drained the canned tomatoes well before adding.  I just added chopped jalapeno for heat when I was cookin the onion.  I added MORE cheese. In between the layers.  I mixed half a small can of enchilada sauce with half the bottle of taco sauce, BIG DIFFERENCE. i poured the taco sauce in the layers instead of mixing with the meat.  It came out way better this way, and we topped with sour cream, lettuce, and guacamole!!!

This is a great recipe.  For my husband and I, I half the recipe and it's still plenty for a meal and leftovers.  For personal preference, I omit the green chiles.  I've made it as written (except the chiles) several times and it's great.  I most recently substituted black beans for refried and added frozen corn to the mixture before simmering.  I liked the extra color and texture that added.

I thought this was wonderful!  I read a lot of the reviews before preparing this, and the number one complaint was that the meat wasn't spicey enough.  So I added a few beef bullion granuoles, a splash of red wine, some cayanne pepper, and about a half pkg of taco seasoning to the meat mixture.  I had no problems with soggy tortillas, I did overlap them.  Also, I used the mexican cheese, as I don't care for Colby.  THis was an easy and fab. meal that my husband loved and that I will prepare again soon!  I also thought it cut well.  I let it cool for about 10 minutes before cutting into it and it cut just like a lasagna.  Beautiful presentaion garnished with jalapenos and sour cream and a little extra salsa.  Served with chips to scoop up the extra filling! The leftovers were wonderful as well.  I thought about cutting the recipe in half and I am so glad I didn't.  Between 2 dinners and sharing with a few co-workers at lunch its all gone!  THanks for a great recipe!!

So delicious. I actually used the whole can of refried beans because we love them, plus a can of black beans. I added taco seasoning powder as I felt it needed the extra flavor. You can't mess this one up, just throw in whatever floats your boat. Kids loved it!

I made this tonight and it was FABULOUS! Even my three yr old daughter ate all her plate and she dosen't eat ANYTHING... I followed the recipe exactly except I cut it in half ( theres only 3 of us) and I used corn tortillas because thats all I had. I dont know why some people had trouble with it being mushy because mine was not mushy at all, it was moist on the inside and kinda crispy on the outside. DELICIOUS!!!

Near perfect!  We all love this tasty recipe... both my teenager and preschooler cleaned their plates.  The only modification I made was to 1). Cut the recipe in half and bake it in a 3 QT casserole [which made about 8 servings].  
2). Substitute canned black beans for half the refried beans.  Fantastic recipe... Thanks Kathi!

Pretty darn good. The "this one is hot!" warning gave us a laugh; it's not anywhere near hot to a Texan. So we spiced it up a bit, added taco seasoning to the ground meat before the sauces, added the whole cans of chilis and olives and put in some Chipotle tobasco to boot. Still came out a little on the bland side. Will try the "hot" taco sauce next time. The sour cream is a must! But it was quite good and worth making again. Four stars.

This was a fun one!! And this California family didn't find it hot at all. Even our fussy teenager agreed. I followed the suggestion of others and used one can of refried beans and one can of black beans. I also added a can of whole kernel corn for a little crunch. I used cake-type pans the same size as the tortillas and it made 3 very full pans. Enough for us, guests and for a family in our church who recently had twins. I couldn't imagine refried beans stirred in and started out pretty skeptical but I was very pleased. We'll have this again but we'll make sure we invite plenty of friends to help us eat it.

The first time I made this I noticed that the flour tortillas were more trouble than they 
were worth. Didn't seem like they added a lot of flavor, either! I switched to corn tortillas, 
and it not only made the casserole easier to cut and serve, but added that corn zip to the
recipe. I also added some crushed red pepper, and used half the can of green chiles, but
added two minced Chipotle Peppers and about two tablespoons of the Adobo sauce from the 
can. Added a really smoky flavor to the dish, and raised the heat/flavor level a bit at the 
same time. We don't like olives, so we add more onions to make up for it! I also only use one
can of beans. Really good recipe, just needed some tweaking on the spices and the tortillas!

This was easy and delicious.   I used a combo of cheddar/pepper jack cheeses.  I also substituted black beans(drained) for one of the cans of refried beans.  Substituted chili sauce/salsa for the taco sauce and used a little larger cans of diced tomatoes and diced green chilies. I also preferred to use corn tortillas.  This recipe is a keeper.

Made several times, we love it!  I half the recipe because it is plenty, and I make it in my springform pan and it fits perfectly!  After baking I always wait 15 minutes before removing the outer part of the pan and slicing.  It gives it time to settle and it is still hot.  I double the cheese, use 2 tortillas per layer(6 total), and use Original Rotel and medium taco sauce.  I have eliminated the extra chilis and olives because it tastes exactly the same without them and saves me a couple bucks.  Then I spend that money on sour cream, salsa, and lettuce to serve with the meal. Thanks for the 5 star reipe!

This recipe was great! My entire family loved it. My kids hate onions and tomatoes but didn't even notice they were in there. I made sure to chop the onions small and when I opened the can of tomatoes with green chilies I chopped those up too so the tomatoes wouldn't be so large. I only used one can of refried beans and I didn't add the can of green chilies because it also call for a can of tomatoes with green chilies and I though that was enough. I have never used Colby cheese before but it was much better than cheddar I am glad I bought that instead. So all in all I will be making this again and again. If you are looking for something new to try, TRY THIS ONE! It is easy and doesn't use a lot of dishes and everyone will eat it. That in itself is always a plus.

Very good! I used more than double the cheese called for. I only used 1 can of refried beans and combined it with the meat mixture. I used a 10 oz. can of enchilada sauce as recommended by several reviewers and added some of my homemade salsa as well. Also, I added 2 cans of sliced ripe olives, 1 wasn't enough for all that sauce. Layer 2 or 3 tortillas at a time so they hold their own and don't get mushy. I put it in a 9x13 pan and it worked perfectly. Then cut it in squares and we put sour cream, lettuce and chopped tomatoes on top. HINT: I didn't think this was very HOT at all. If you like real hot food, I would recommend adding some jalapenos or hot sauce according to your tastes.

The recipe was excellent.  I would have given it five stars, however my boyfriend thought it was great, but not amazing.  It was very easy to make and you can modify the recipe by adding corn and other favorites, to make it unique.  I cut the recipe in half and used a 9 1/2 x 13 pan.  I was worried about the tortillas, but I used six 8 inch flour tortillas. I placed one in the middle and cut two in half and placed the flat edged side on each side of the pan. It worked pefectly.

I am giving this 5 stars because it is simple and tasty.  It is great as it is but the next time I make it I will try and add a layer of some sort of filling (depending on my mood) and take away a layer of tortilla.

This is a family favorite.  My girls love to "make" this themselves...I give them each 1/2 the recipe and they layer it all.  We make one 8x8 pan, and freeze the other half in a foil pan wrapped in foil and then insert it into a feeezer ziplock bag to freeze for later.  Frozen, it takes about 75 minutes to cook if you forget to take it out early.

I added a batch of homemade taco seasoning as well as some fresh chopped fresh cilantro to the ground beef mixture. I also did not have Rotel (diced tomatoes with green chili peppers) so I just used one can of petite diced tomatoes that I drained the juice off of. I only had one can of refried beans in my pantry but in the end, that worked out well for me. This was a quick supper that my boys seemed to like--my husband didn't have much of an opinion either way but he did have seconds. Next time, I'll cut back on the meat a bit and add in some chopped veggies. I think this would be good with enchilada sauce served on the side, too.

This was excellent!  I did make a few changes though.  Instead of re fried beans, we used black beans, drained and rinsed and added to the meat mixture.  I also added 2 cans of olives, used fresh garlic, left out the onion, and instead of using canned tomatoes with chilies, I added peach pineapple salsa.  This was very good and will make again.

This is pretty ok; I doubt I'd make it again.  I relied on other reviewers' suggestions:  1) added a packet of taco seasoning (don't need to add water because the juices from other ingredients make it moist enough); 2) added a cup+ of frozen corn; 3) added extra green chiles cause I love them; 4) used white corn tortillas (personal fave); 5) spread the frijoles on the tortillas and then placed the tortillas, bean-side down on the cheese layers; 6) layered it meat/cheese/bean tortilla/repeat, then end with a meat layer followed by a cheese layer; 7) served with sour cream which was an excellent touch; 8) I also cut the recipe in half (for 8 servings) and it all fit in a 9x9 glass baking dish.  Think that's it.  It's a casserole-y meal; so nothing out-of-this-world but fit the bill for a Cinco de Mayo night for the neighborhood potluck.

This was excellent!  I used a jar of salsa instead of taco sauce by mistake and it turned out great! I was skeptical about mixing the beans with the beef, but the consistency was great and it was very good.  I also added some taco seasonings, which added some flavour.  Served it with some mexican rice with green peppers and corn.  Thank you for a great and different recipe!

There are so many reviews on this recipe, does it need one more?  Well, here goes.....I would agree on the following:  very heavy, makes a huge quantity (I used a stock pot to make mine!) and not a lot of texture.  However, it is a lot like a burrito!  I made many changes per other recommendations.  1)  1/2 refried beans, 1/2 black beans.  2)  salsa instead of taco sauce.  3)  added lots of spices (some reviewers added taco seasoning, but I prefer to use my own seasoning) like cumin, chili powder, and oregano.  All in all, this is the kind of recipe that is a launching pad for your imagination and personal taste.  Have fun and be creative!

So good!  My family loved this.  It was a great alternative to an expensive visit to the local Mexican restaurant, and was quick enough to prepare after an afternoon of soccer practice.  I added a packet of burrito seasoning to the ground beef and followed the suggestion to spread the refried beans on the tortillas rather than adding them into the beef mixture.  I used fat free refried beans.  For the tortilla layers, I placed one layer of bean-coated tortillas, bean side down, and topped with a second layer of plain tortillas.  I placed the sliced olives on top of half of the casserole and omitted the olives from the other half (picky kids).  Everyone seemed to enjoy this topped with fat free sour cream.  Great recipe!

The meat mixture is yummy, but making it into a casserole was a waste of time. I threw out the leftovers. None of us ate any after the first night. The family liked it, but would have been sooo much better if we could have personalized each burrito to our own tastes (more or less meat, onions, cheese, salsa, taco sauce, sour cream, etc.). I've saved the meat mixture part of the recipe in my files for future use. This will replace my current burrito recipe for sure!

SOOOOOOOOO Good!!!  Definitely something we will have on a regular basis.  I cut the recipe in half and it still made a ton.  We had it for dinner last night and have plenty for leftovers.  Followed the recipe and served it with sour cream and some jalapenos. YUMMMM!

Thanks so much for sharing this simple and tasty recipe!  Very easy and very good.  I generally use a cup or so of frozen corn instead of the olives and I have subbed salsa in place of the taco sauce in the past.  I always use ground turkey in place of the beef and use about a packet and a half of taco seasoning because of this.  Great comfort food and my boyfriend, who HATES Mexican style food, loves this.

we call this mexican pie at our house.  excellent recipe and easy to make.  I usually brown the ground beef add taco seasoning with 1 c. salsa cooked until the liquid is out (kind of like a picadillo mixture).  I also used cheddar cheese instead of colby.  Layer the ingredients according to recipe.  makes alot and is good as leftovers.

This recipe was a hit at the Super Bowl party last night! I did make a few modifications...I added a packet of taco seasoning to ground beef (did not add water though). I left out the green chile pappers, and used salsa instead of taco sauce. And I used taco cheese instead of colby. I ended up using about twice as much cheese as the recipe called for. 

Thanks, Kathi!! No doubt that I will be making this again!!

If I could give this "zero" stars, I would.  I live in San Diego, and I love to make Southwestern types of food. For one thing, if it was my recipe, I would have told the cook what dimensions of baking dish to use.  For another thing, I would have told the cook how much meat sauce to put onto each layer.  I used my own judgement, and it didn't matter.  Folks, if you truly like Mexican styly food, DO NOT make this recipe.

This was fantastic! I did as others recommended...cut the servings in half, used 9 x 13 and added corn. I prep'd everything the day before and refrigerated till following evening. Definitely something we'll make again.

The recipe was good and easy to make, however I recommend using either white or yellow corn tortillas rather than flour tortillas as the flour tortillas became mushy.

This was good. Like other reviewers, I spread the beans on the tortillas before placing them face-down - so layered beef mix, then cheese, then beans, tortillas. Topped with lettuce, sour cream & salsa. I divided everything into three small casseroles & froze two of them for later. And I used venison burger for the meat. My only complaint was there was something "sweet" about it. I'm sure it was from the tortillas because I've gotten that same "taste" before wit other tortilla dishes - may just be that particular brand, or maybe I just just use a hotter sauce in the meat mixture.

This is an absolutley delicious dish! I have made this twice so far, and everyone who has tried this, loved it. I prefer to use a deep 9x13 inch disposable aluminum pan for this. I make the meat filling exactly as written, but I use a few more tortillas per layer, and I also use more cheese, because we love it! I found that using a shredded seasoned Mexican blend cheese adds wonderful flavor also. I serve this on a bed of shredded iceberg lettuce, with a side of guacamole and top with salsa and sour cream. If your prefer a lot of heat, layer some sliced jalapeno peppers between the layers. This really is a fantastic recipe, and it's easy. I will definitely make this again and again! Thanks for posting :)

I've made this for years, but I prefer using corn tortillas and, instead of taco sauce & diced tomatoes with chilies, use only the diced canned green chiles & a chopped fresh hot green chili then liberally seasoning it with oregano & cumin.  I use shredded chicken instead of the beef & use cilantro as one of the garnishes.  Tastes like I'm back in New Mexico.

I've made this several times and everyone loves it. I make it in two deep dish pie pans and freeze one before baking. I definitely took the advice of others and layered the beans in between the tortillas. I love knowing I have a dinner ready to go in a pinch. I also think this one of those dishes that tastes even better the next day!

I love this spicy dish!!  My family does not like spicy food so I leave out the green chili peppers, use diced tomatoes without green chili and mild taco sauce for them.  This is also great without the tortillas and served as a dip!

I had to make a beef mexican dish for my Dad's 50th Birthday party. This was an absolute hit from my great grandmother to my 9 year old cousin! I changed it up as some had recommended 1) Double layered the tortillas 2) spread only 1 can of beans on the tortillas 3) added Taco Seasoning 4)Omitted the cumin and olives 5) simmered the beef mixture for about an hour. I think the mixture would also be good as a Mexican Chili topped with cheese and tortilla strips! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I can't say enough about this recipe, especially if you love burritos like I do...but can never quite get them wrapped right!  I cut the recipe in half, and still had half a dish left over!  I used a round deep dish casserole, which the tortillas fit in perfectly.  I only changed the recipe to make a healthier version, but honestly you don't lose any of the taste!  I used ground turkey, whole wheat tortillas, fat free re-fried beans, and reduced fat cheese and sour cream.  I did follow other reviews advice and added taco seasoning to the meat along with a little ground cumin.  Instead of the can of tomatoes, I used a homemade Mexican chunky style salsa and a homemade black bean and corn salsa to add into the meat mixture.  I also did not mix the re-fried beans as another review suggested, I spread the re-fried beans onto the tortilla and placed that over the meat mixture!  I usually never go for seconds, but with this, I couldn't help myself!

We really liked this recpie.  It is a great change from the traditional burrito recipe.  The left overs were the best part and it freezes well also.  Good thing to make in advance and to freeze.  Just take out and bake in the oven for an hour! Or until thawed and warm.

Good Stuff!  I actually made this recipe close to the way it was written which is unusual for me.  I did add a can of chopped tomatoes because they are so good for you.  I used jalapeno refried beans, medium hot taco sauce and a 7 oz can of green chilis.  It was spicy but I am from Texas so that was just fine!  I think next time I will use one 8 oz bottle of taco sauce and one packet of taco seasoning with a larger can of tomatoes to make up some of the liquid I would be missing.  It was a little vinegary tasting due to the taco sauce, which was a premium brand.  I loved the way this wasn't too wet and stayed in portions so nicely.  It would make a great potluck and you could add the lettuce and tomato right on top with little "kisses" of sour cream on each portion.  Nice and easy.  Great recipe!

This was great!  I used corn tortillas as I don't like flour ones in casserole type dishes. This went together quickly and was delicious and satisfying.  I left out the green chilis and used plain petite diced tomatoes as I was afraid it would be too hot for the kids.  Everyone loved it and this is definately something I will make again. (I'm thinking of adding cheese directly to the mixture and using it as filling for fried burritos.)

A great hit with my friends, I substituted with low fat cheddar cheese and fat free re-fried beans, to reduce the fat... I plan on using this recipe again and again!

This is delicious. It was so easy to make and everyone loved it. I couldn't find tomatoes and greenchilis together so I used a half a can of each. We found tht the whole 4oz. can of peppers made it a bit too spicy so I used half the next time. The best part of this recipe is that it is even better the next day!

I love this dish! Being of Mexican heritage I know it's not very authentic, but it sure is delicious. I have made it with refried beans and with whole pinto beans and we prefer it with the whole pinto beans. I season the meat with salt and pepper and I leave out the olives because we don't care for them. I substitute Pace salsa for the taco sauce and we top it off with sour cream, tomatoes and green onions. Very tasty!

It's pretty hard to screw up this recipe and the only limits are your imagination and what you have in your kitchen. It work great with just about any meat, any peppers, any sauce, any cheese, or any beans. This is like your spaghetti sauce: nobody makes it quite like you do. So have fun with it!

The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is because it isn't as good as mine. But mine isn't as good as yours, I'll bet.

I made this recipe for dinner last night, and it was good. I added red, yellow and orange bell peppers to add some more flavor, and double layered the tortillas. I also added a layer of tortillas on top so that there would be a little crunch. Overall good dish.

I've made this recipe so many times over the years, but tonight was the first time I made it with chicken.  It was great.  However, I make it, I only use one can of refried beans and normally add a bit more salsa.  Served with lettuce, sour cream and maybe a bit more cheese and it's a great meal.  Leftovers go a long way as well and are still great days later.

Was very tasty however, mine did come out a little watery. Would possibly omit the can tomato juice and use less taco sauce but perhaps add taco seasoning.

Excellant. My 19 year old said it was the best dish he has ever eaten. I used 1 jar of clints "Perfect Hot" salsa and like another suggested, I spread the refried beans on the tortillas, facing up and layered as directed. Rave reviews from family. Thanks for sharing!

This is a pretty good recipe.  I halved it and made it in a 9x13.  I also mixed a packet of taco seasoning in the beef instead of a bottle of sauce (thought a half bottle of sauce would make it too runny) and added a half cup of salsa instead. it turned out pretty good. I also used much more cheese than what the recipe called for.

This was tasty and filling. There are so many reviews on here you just don't know what to believe. I am watching my calories constantly, so figured I would try to make it without doubling up on tortillas as others suggested. They weren't soggy at all. In fact, I only used 9 flour tortillas - three per layer. I also only used 1 lb of beef and 1 can of refried beans - also perfectly fine. I used salsa instead of taco sauce, and 2% cheddar cheese. These changes basically halved the recipe and it made 8 servings in a 9x13. Will make again!

I left out the olives (because I'm not a big fan) instead of putting the bottom coat of meat, I started with a layer of just taco sauce so that when you go to lift out the pieces of pie, you start with a piece of tortilla -- easier cleanup too.

Very tasty.  I made it WW friendly by substituting boca ground burger for the ground beef, using fat free refried beans, fat free tortillas, and using 2% cheese.  I omitted the olives.  I cut each tortilla in half and arranged them so the flat (cut) side would fit nicely to the edges of the rectangular pan I used.

This recipe was really great!  I was so surprised that it really does taste just like a beef and bean burrito and the tortilla layers were not soggy at all!  I didn't have a 4 quart casserole pan so instead I used a 9 x 12 pan and had a few less layers (probably about 3 layers in all) but I surely got the desired effect.  I also used about two cups mexican style shredded cheese rather than the 9 oz of colby.  I omitted the black olives - not a big fan - and in the end I  had a really delicious dinner!  My husband picked out this recipe from allrecipes and was the first one to make it and now I am adding it to my own recipe box.  As everyone else said, lots of leftovers that taste even better the next day!  Thanks Kathi!

I used 1 can of refried beans, and added 1 can of black beans and one can of whole kernal sweet corn, and used homemade copycat taco sauce. I layered this in a 16x9 baking pan and it turned out great.

We really liked the flavour and idea!! Will make again & again :)
I only use 1 lb beef and 1 can beans and medium or hot salsa. Sometimes add a little cumin and chipolte chili and whatever else??
I grew some hot peppers this year and put those in as well.
Making again this time just rolling individual red and green tortillas topping with some of the cheese and olives. Looks colorful...

A winner!  We prefer more spicy, so added some cumin.  As there are only two of us, I made one casserole (with yummy leftovers), froze another, and froze excess filling for future use.  Think I will use corn tortillas next time with excess filling (personally prefer the taste of corn, but found they don't freeze well in casserole form).

Really good! I made this not realizing how much it really made.  I would suggest halfing the recipe or splitting it into two dishes and freezing one.

This is a big hit at my house.  I half the recipe and make it with fajita sized tortillas in a round, 2L casserole dish then cut it like pie wedges over shredded lettuce.  Following some other's suggestions, I brown the tortillas in a skillet while the mixture is cooking so that they don't disintigrate while baking.  Also, for half the recipe, I use a whole can of Rotel and leave out the chilis and olives. Also replace the taco sauce with chunky mild salsa and add most of a packet of taco seasoning and some cumin and it's plenty spicy for my house.    I use low fat tortillas and fat free cheddar instead of the colby, as well as 4% fat ground beef and fat free refried beans and it comes out great and fits very well into our diet.

I was really disappointed with this recipe. The only flavor that comes through is the green chili peppers...very one-dimensional. If I were to make this recipe again, I would substitute (1) spicy enchilada sauce for the taco sauce, and (2) black beans for the refried beans (oh, why didn't I take the advice of reviewers?!). My teenaged son, who loves Mexican food, thought this recipe was horrible. One final note: I will concede that one's results with this recipe probably depends upon what taco sauce and refried beans one uses, since both items come in a variety of styles/flavors.

Very good recipe.  I halved the recipe to make 8 servings, but still used the full amount of black olives.  I also added half a package of taco seasoning and used a full 8oz. pkg. of mexican blend shredded cheese.  I used a round 2qt. casserole and only used three tortillas.  Topped it with lettuce, tomato, sour cream and more shredded cheese.  Wonderful!

Thanks for a wonderful and easy recipe! I added a TBS of salt (personal preference), i also used a can of black beans in place of one of the refried beans (make sure to drain them well). after tasting it while cooking i decided to add 1/2 ts of cumin and also half a small package of taco seasoning. The recipe tastes very good even without adding the things i mentioned but i thought these added to the flavor. I didn't have colby cheese on hand so i used sharp chedder cheese for the middle layers and a mixture of cheddar and mozarella for the top layer. I too increased the amount of cheese since i'm a cheese fanatic. I will definetely make this recipe again and again. thank you Kathi :-)

This is wonderful!  I lightly toasted the tortillas in the skillet so that they didn't end up soggy like the other reviewers were saying.  I didn't have green chiles and I used ground turkey instead of beef.  This has great flavor and makes a lot!  Serve with your favorite mexican rice & guacamole. yummmmmm

I used a tortilla as the first and last layer and an oven-safe plate on the pie and baked for the first 10 mins or so, to give the stack some weight. It turned out the fillings were just about to overflow and the melting cheese... The sight of it made it even more delicious and everyone just suddenly grew hungrier! We also had some sour cream with it to tone down the spice. We've had this over and again and we still love it! The best burrito sandwich ever!!! THANKS!!!!

Seems redundant to write another great review (I'm #331), but this is the bomb.  I scaled it down to 8 and made it in a deep dish pie pan.  I added my own spices to the meat, and left out the beans.  It is awesome!!!

I make a version very similar to this, but with these adjustments:
Add taco seasoning to the ground beef when cooking (cumin, chili powder, garlic & onion powders, salt & pepper) to taste. Leave out the taco sauce. I always put the flour tortillas in a pan on the stove and crisp them up just a bit to avoid the sogginess. I top mine with cheese and crunched up tortilla chips and bake. When done, I serve with salsa, sour cream and avocado slices. It is always a hit this way!

Super easy to make. Our entire family enjoyed this! It passed the expectations of my Husband (he's a chef, always "expertly" critiquing my cooking) and made our family menu! I will be making this plenty more times!

This has a very good taste to it. I did not change anything about the original recipe. I DO NOT understand where people think this is a "spicy" or "hot dish", everything is from a can. There is nothing hot about this dish at all. The flavors meld together nicely. I did not find it to be soggy or gloppy. Next time I make this I will make home made tortillas, and put fresh green chili in it.

I just made this last night for dinner.  OMG!  This is amazing.  I didn't use the diced green chillies for medical reasons and olives I don't like.  But it was unbelievably good.  On every recipe I try, I rate it (poor, maybe, great, amazing).  I guess you know the rating was amazing so I will definitely make this again.  We have a lot of people over all the time for things, and this recipe makes a lot,  so it works great for a big crowd at the house. I also added a couple of taco season packets to the meat mixture.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

This was quite tasty!  

Hunting season just finished around here, so I actually made this out of elk burger, yum!  It made enough for dinner that night, lunch the next day, and a whole pan went into the freezer for another night.  So although this did take quite a bit of preparation, it's saving me from cooking for an additional 3 meals.

Followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the tortilla layers, and also spread the beans on instead of mixing with the meat.

I have made similar recipes in the past with corn tortillas, or even chicken, so this recipe is highly versatile.

One can of refined beans, not two. Dashes of hot sauce. Added one package of taco seasoning with 3/4 of water. Simmer for 45 minutes. Longer the better. Burrito size tortillas cut in squares to fit the pan. This will overlap to give more layers( plus the left over bits of the tortillas that was cut off) Did meat sauce, corn and black beans(drained), cheese then tortilla. Served with lettuce, tomato and sour cream. Made in a 11x9 pan and three layers. Add hot sauce or more peppers for some heat. Great recipe!!!

This one is a winner - tastes great and everyone cleaned their plates.  None of us thought this was very hot/spicy, but it does have a very good flavor - next time I'll add diced jalapenos instead of diced green chilis to give it more kick. Followed the recipe very closely except I always add more garlic and I used a large 6oz can of sliced black olives and saved some to put on the top layer.  I was concerned about the meat mixture being too runny, so I simmered it until most of the juices were reduced.  I also didn't mix the refried beans with the meat - warmed them separately and added a little of the taco sauce to thin it a bit.  I used a 3qt rectangular Corningware casserole dish and trimmed large tortillas to fit. Made the tortilla layers only 1 thick even though some reviewers suggested using 2 or three per layer.  Glad I did - it wasn't too runny at all and I didn't want to add extra carbs.  Spread warmed refried beans on the tortilla layer, then added a layer of the meat mixture, then a layer of cheese - repeated 3 times until all ingredients were used up.  Cooked it longer than the recipe called for - about 45 minutes so the top would brown.  Then let it stand about 20-30 minutes before serving it so it would set.  Served with sour cream and green onions.  I will definitely be making this one again.

I made this for dinner last night and it was so good. I followed some reviewers suggestions, only using one can of refried beans and one can of black beans. I cooked the black beans with the meat mixture, but reserved the refried and spread them on the bottoms of the tortillas while I was layering. Since it's just 2 of us, I split this into two pans, and froze one for later. I also ended up adding some taco seasoning and enchilada sauce because I felt like the meat was missing something. Overall, really good dinner, and probably something we will make again. We liked it with some shredded lettuce and sour cream on top.

mexican lasagna! The kids liked alot! It was a great meal to make with leftovers from taco night. I didn't have refried beans which would have probably made this really good.

I used corn tortillas instead of flour (2 per layer) and crushed up some tortilla chips and layered on top with cheese for a little extra texture.  Very good!

We thought the flavor, texture, and the way this is put together was just a little to "mushy" for us. All the flavors just sort of ran together. We do believe though that certain dishes suit certain people better than others. This one was not for us, but you might like it.

This is sooooo good.  I used a 5-quart 11x15 pyrex dish to bake it in.  I mixed spicy and regular refried beans together and left them separate to layer with instead of adding to the meat mixture.  I also added the black beans separate.  I cooked the meat mixture with an envelope of taco seasoning because I wanted it spicy but did not add any water.  I first poured about a cup of the meat mixture in the baking dish sprayed with Pam.  Then staggered 3 burrito size flour shells on that.  Then I spread 1/3 of the refried beans, then sprinkled 1/3 of the black beans, then sprinkled with 1/3 the cheese, then the meat mixture again till I had 3 layers.  I topped the whole thing off with a little more cheese before baking.  My husband and son have not stopped raving about this recipe!!!!  I served it with lots of chopped green onion, sour cream, and extra taco sauce.  What luck finding this fabulous recipe!  Thank you!

i have some very slight variations of this recipe. I use the super size yellow or white corn tortillas. I make my own refried beans (hate the can kind) and i spread the beans on the tortillas (like i would peanut butter)instead of mixing it with the meat and i sprinkle the olives on top of the casserole. sometimes i put shredded lettuce, sour cream (the mexican 'creme' kind) and tomatoes on top after it's done cooking. kids and grown ups always love it :)

This was very easy to prepare and delicious!  I was wondering if it'd be bland because there aren't any spices, but it's very flavorful.

I changed this recipe a bit based on reviews, but overall we loved it.  My biggest changes were salsa for the taco sauce (simply because I couldn't find it) and layering the meat and beans separately with more burritos between each layer.  Will make again!

We liked it, but I make another similar casserole with corn tortillas, and the texture of those are much better in a recipe like this.  I added 1 t cumin, 1 t chili powder, and used 1 lb of morningstar farms crumbles instead of ground beef.  Great flavor.

I've used the idea of this recipe many times, with all kinds of indgredients and it comes out yummy everytime.  I prefer to do a dish like this instead of enchiladas or multiple burritos - it's much easier and faster this way.

Made this last night.  After reading many reviews, I made the following changes.  I added in one packet of taco seasoning to the browned meat (I used ground turkey).  I didn't put the refried beans in with the meat mixture, but instead spread them on top of the tortillas.  I could only find packages of 8 count tortilaas so I cut each in half and doubled up on the tortillas when layering to prevent them from getting soggy.  I used an 11x17 baking dish and layered it:  meat, cheese, beany tortillas...meat, cheese, beany tortillas...topped with more shredded cheese.  I covered and baked for 30 minutes, then uncovered and baked another 7 minutes.  Let it rest for 10 minutes and served with salsa and sour cream on the side.  Was delicious and tasted even better today.

I saw this recipe and used it for a PTO teachers dinner.  I kept my fingers crossed as I hadnt tried it before taking it into the teachers.  It was a HUGE hit!  I made it again for a birthday and even froze one and brought it out a week later and it was fabulous.  By placing them in a round cake pan, it fits perfectly! Getting ready to make it for a friend who just came out of surgery as I know it will freeze well and she can cook it at any time.   
I too spread the refired beans on the wraps and placed them "bean side down" instead of mixing it in with the meat.    I plan on adding some mexican corn the next time I make it to brighten the color.   Great for a crowd, you can make it ahead of time and just throw it in the oven when the guest arrive.    ENJOY!

Delish! Tried to make a few healthy modifications and used lean ground turkey,whole wheat tortillas and decreased the amount of cheese. I halfed the recipe and made one super thick 9 inch pie.

This recipe was great!  I followed many of the other review tips.  I used 2 tortilla's per layer, spread the refried beans on the tortilla's as opposed to adding it to the meat mixture and cooked the meat sauce with a package of taco seasoning for about 30 minues.  The last five minutes of baking I broiled on high and voila!  Perfect!  This would be a great dish to bring to a party!!!

I doubled the tortillas, as per the reviews.  They were still soggy.  This recipe was time consuming, and wasn't enjoyed by my family.  It's so much like a 7 layer dip, I'll stick with that from now on.

I was underwhelmed by this dish. While it tasted great, the tortillas didn't really add anything to the dish, and some of the ones in the center got downright soggy. If I made this again, I would make it with fewer layers, or possibly use crushed chips as my dividers.

I halved the recipe and omitted the chiles (for the kids), added a can of pinto beans, and about 2T taco seasoning from this site...did as some suggested spreading refried beans on tortillas before layering...this was SOOOOOOO good...thanks so much for submitting!!!

This is great.  You really need to add taco seasoning to the meat.  I didn't have every exact ingredient, but close enough. Only used 1 lb ground sirloin.  This will definately be a staple around here. After taking it out of the oven it was a bit sloppy, and layers didn't hold up.  But next day after being refriderated it was great..everything melded  togethr.just cut a piece and nuke.  I think I always make a day ahead.

Very good and very easy.  I pretty much followed the original recipe, but I did add taco seasoning as others had suggested.  I also added a can of corn to the meat mixture, thought that turned out good and would do it again.  I topped it with sour cream before serving.  My 5 year old son said, "I want to eat this for breakfast tomorrow, it is soooo good."

The first two times I made this, it came out 5-star delicious. The third time I made it, I decided to make it the day before, as others suggested. Don't make it ahead unless you absolutely have to. It's not near as good. There were three things I didn't like when doing it this way. 1) Because you're starting with a cold pie, the cheese started to get too brown on top without it getting completely heated through the middle. 2) I did not like the texture of the tortillas as well. 3) The bottom tortillas stuck.

Wow....this was not a big hit.  I'm not a picky eater....and I took one bite and was instantly not impressed. I always follow the recipe as written the first go around. (one of my goofy rules)  But I should have read the reviews on this one and took some advice.  If you do not like refried beans or only "kinda" like them....DO NOT MAKE THIS!  It was so bland.  I'm not sure where people are getting the "heat" element from.  It wasn't there....I'm just not sure what to say other than I think this needs major adjustments....but I don't think I'm wasting my time.  I'll just make burritos or taco's.

I thought this was really great!  I did change a few things based on the suggestions from other reviewers.  I added a packet of taco seasoning to the hamburger mixture and about 1/2 cup of water.  I let it reduce until it was thick.  I also spread the refried beans on the tortillas instead of mixing them with the hamburger.  Definitely put in two tortillas per layer instead of one.  It was just the right consistency and wasn't mushy.  I made in a 10" springform pan that was the exact size of the tortillas I used so it worked perfectly.  Really good and it made a ton.  I would definitely recommend this recipe and just adjust to your taste.

Very very good!  (didn't give it 5 stars- just cause i changed several things).  But WILL make again!  used 1.5 lbs of beef and a packet of taco seasoning.  thought it was a little "beany" - so next time i will only use 1 can of beans and use only to spread onto the tortillas, and not mix any with the beef. only used 10oz of taco sauce. many suggested double stacking torts.  I did a layer of flour tortillas - then layer of corn tortillas on top of them (cause my husband loves corn torts.).  this was the perfect addition to keep the layers - and great flavor!  will add more cheese next time, and a can of corn!  Served on bed of shredded lettuce w/ diced tomato and dalop of sourcream on top.  (sour cream is a must!..mmm)

Great recipe! I've made it with ground beef, shredded left over pot roast and just made it w/leftover shredded pork roast. I've also used  enchilada sauce instead of the taco sauce..always a family pleaser!!!

You absolutely must taste the meat mixture while cooking it. It tasted pretty bland, so we added 2 envelopes of taco seasoning and prob.about a teaspoon of salt. I also toasted the tortillas in a dry skillet as suggested, and spread the beans on the tortillas instead of adding to the mixture. Oh, I also added several dashes of Tabasco, and chipotle dry seasoning. I also used diced tomatoes with jalapeno (Del Monte brand, I think). Excellent recipe--feel free to tweak it to make it your own. And yes, it did make a lot of food. I filled one 9x13 as well as a 9" pie plate.

This was a great recipe with a few modifications.  I omitted the olives and spiced up the beef with cumin, adobo and chili powder.  I also used corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas with a little oil on the bottom of the pan.  I then used cooked rice to layer in also and added some fresh cilantro.  It was then topped off with fresh salsa.  WONDERFUL!  Then entire family was well pleased and is fighting over the left overs!

This is another one of those recipes that I see reviewed so often, I knew I had to try it myself. I thought it was incredibly easy and quick, and it uses things that I pretty much always have on hand. Flavor-wise, I thought it  was just ok and nothing really spectacular. I like the concept though - I might try again but use my own chili recipe. Thanks!

FYI - If you have leftovers on this dish - it freezes extremely well.  I froze individual portions and then reheat in the microwave.  It makes for a quick and delicious dinner or lunch!

This came out great!  I omitted the olives (hubbie doesn't like them,took the suggestions of other reviewers and made the following alterations-

(1) Use 1/2 refried and 1/2 black beans 
    (drained)
(2) Add canned corn (drained)
(3) Add taco seasoning to meat(don't  
    add water)
(4) Substitute salsa (I used 505  
    southwestern salsa w/ flame roasted 
    New Mexican green chile)
(5) Don't mix beans with meat
(6) Layer refried beans, meat, black   
    beans, cheese, corn, repeat 
(7) Fry tortillas b/f baking (no need 
    to double layer if you do this)

Serve with sour cream, cheese, avocado (opt), and salsa

* wrap leftovers in new tortilla for   
  lunch

This made an easy and tasty supper and even my picky husband liked it. I scaled the recipe by half since it originally made such a large quantity. Because of this, instead of using taco sauce and tomatoes, I used a 14.5 oz can of plain diced tomatoes (in my household even MILD Rotel tomatoes it too spicy) and seasoned the ground beef with a packet of taco seasoning. I wasn't sure how thick to spread the filling and ended up only using 4 tortillas before running out of filling and cheese but it would have been better if I'd managed all 6 called for. My husband said he thought he'd like the filling rolled up inside of the tortillas like regular burritos also.

Yum!  I added 1/2 package of taco seasoning to the meat along with the garlic and onion.  I used 8 oz of taco sauce and a mixture of Mexican cheeses.  I used half of the beans and mixed it into the meat mixture.  The other half I spread onto the bottom of each tortilla before layering it.  I had enough for one 9x13 casserole dish and I froze a round cake pan sized portion.  Finish with a dollop of sour cream and salsa. Serve with chips, dip, and margaritas. It doesn't get better than this!!:-) Ally

I made this last night and really liked it.  I have a family of 4, including 2 small children (who loved it too!) so it made WAY to much!  I froze the remainder, we'll see how that goes.  I made the recipe just as listed, but didn't have tomatoes with green chiles, so I just added a can of regular tomatoes.  I was very careful to REALLY drain everything well, so that it would not be runny like others have described.  I think it worked well, because I did not have a runny mess.
Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Worthy of the great reviews already received!  I incorporated many of the previous suggestions.  I doubled the cheese and used a jar of salsa in place of taco sauce.  Also, instead of mixing the beans with the meat, I used only 1 can and spread the beans on the tortillas (like ricotta in italian lasagna!; this provided a great texture. Thanks Kathi for the fantastic recipe!

This was excellent.  I used fat free refried beans and put a little extra cheese in it.  Everyone loved it.  It's great served with Spanish Rice (Rice-a-Roni or Lipton Rice) and sour cream.  So easy to make too.

EXCELLENT!  This was a hit for my boyfriend.  I made it along with Sara's Salsa (also excellent I might add) and it turned out great!  We added sour cream, lettuce, tomato, black olives, chives & some of the Sara's Salsa on top of this yummy burrito pie!  TRY IT!!!

My family loved this dish.  I cut it in half like the previous reviews suggested and ended up having no leftovers.  My husband ate 3 sevings at dinner and the rest before bed he liked it that much!  I did make it with chorizo instead of hamburger because I like a litle more spice.  We will definately be having this on a regular basis.

my family loved this recipe. I took some ideas from others--- such as I added a bag of frozen corn, I fried the taco shells in vegetable oil--- to try to make them harder, but it didn't make a big difference (and I probably won't do it again because it's such a waste.) I did find that the meat was a bit bland-- so I added 2 packs of taco seasoning and no water. I used salsa instead of taco sauce and kept it seperate--- as a layer close to the top. I added a lot more cheese... but we are cheese people! We've had it twice now, and I would highly reccommend it. It is a HUGE portion. It feeds my family of 6 twice with left overs.

What an excellent idea: lasagna with a Mexican twist.  We liked this when it was hot out of the oven, but I heated it up in the microwave the next day and it was OUTSTANDING.  The flavors blend and the individual layers take shape overnight in the fridge.  I added a layer of cream cheese and regular cheese on the inside.  I also used a mexican cheese mix instead of just colby.  This recipe makes a TON.  Now we have tons of leftovers to savor!!!! YUM. Note: be sure to use a double layer of tortillas each time you use them.  It holds up better and the taste is excellent.

Good and easy!  I would suggest that you do brown the tortillas and use more of them than the recipe calls for.  I cut the recipe in half and used a 9x13 pan - but there weren't enough tortillas to make this sturdy.  And I don't know what types of bland food most of you eat - but this is NOT hot!!!  Spice is a good thing - try it.

This was a great easy recipie! I made a few essential changes that made it to die for! 1) I added a bag of frozen corn that gave it a great sweet crunch 2) I crushed frito chips over the top which gave it a great texture 3) Finally, I added extra cheese and thicker layers of tortilla's. What a great recipie! Also, this recipie can be divided and frozen very well! Enjoy!

After reading several reviews, and as the recipe didn't state to drain some of the canned ingredients I did drain some.  Stayed pretty close to the recipe and only substitued pepper jack cheese in place of the Colby, and scaled it to serve 8.  My hysband likes a lot of heat, while I prefer mild.   He added hot pepper sauce, and we both thought it was very very tasty.  Excellent and I will make again.  Thanks Kathi.

We liked this but I would cut the hamburger and refried beans in half (one pound burger and one can beans).  There was too much of them!  This does make a lot.  I will probably make it again using less of the above ingredients.

Wow this made a lot of food.  It was a little too goopy the first time we had it, so we used burritos to mop it all up.  After refrigerating it for a day or two, it held up a lot better.

This recipe was a hit with my 8 year old daughter - it's great when served with a side of sour cream. Beware though, this recipe makes 16 servings unless modified - that's a lot of food!

I make something like this... it's called mexican lasagna. When making the layers, I add a spread of pinto beans to the bottom of each tortialla shell.  It gives it more texture.

This is a very easy and filling recipe. Perfect "Comfort Food" for the winter. Try it with mashed avocado and sour cream. (and maybe an ice cold corona)

It makes a lot as written! It is just like lasagna but in Mexican form and it does taste just like a burrito. I used a 9X13 with 10in wraps. I would suggest using the smaller ones and maybe even trying the corn tortillas. It freezes well also.

This recipe is great.  My son loved it as much as we did.  Although I didn't use the Taco Sauce, because I am New Mexican (the chili is grown fresh here), I only used fresh green chili instead.  The meal was exceptionally good, especailly with the sour cream to finish off this masterpiece.

I made this recipe with a few tweeks based solely on my family's like's. I used two pounds of ground pork. While cooking, I seasoned the meat with Lawry's Seasoning salt, garlic powder and minced onion. In a separate pan I fried up one link of chorizo (Mexican sausage) and added that to two cans of authentic refried beans. In a baking dish I layered meat first, burrito sized tortillas, beans, then cheese. I repeated this until the pan was full. My top layer I added black olives, green onions and a jar of Herdez mild salsa. I used the same temp and baking time. I also had Mexican crumble cheese as well. Enjoy!

This was really good. Everyone in the house ate it, well most. A couple of us are new vegetarians. :) However, my kids are usually very bland eaters with regards to chilies, tomatoes and the such. But this went over well. I subbed ground turkey because we don't do beef, and did extra basic seasonings pepper and cumin on meat. Didn't add granulated garlic or dried minced onion, as the recipe already had fresh. I also used taco seasoning with the liquid from the tomatoes to simmer in and I think that helped with any sogginess problems that could have happened had I used taco sauce. Didn't have to double layer tortillas or anything. Did refried beans as its own layer. Kept olives out and people added as they wanted, along with shredded lettuce and sour cream. Will definitely be making again. Thank you!

I made this recipe before and while it was good, I tried it again with some of the suggestions from other reviews and it was fantastic!

Even still, the modifications were pretty minor:
- double the thickness of the tortilla layers
- spread the beans over the tortillas (do not mix them in the sauce)
- simmer the sauce longer, about 30 minutes
- add extra seasoning to taste, to the sauce mixture...chili powder, ground cumin, salt, pepper and extra garlic if needed

Made it for a potluck. Yummy!

I made the recipe almost exactly as written.  The only change was I added my homemade taco seasoning to the meat when I cooked it.  I didn't expect a whole lot going into this recipe.  Quite frankly, I am a food snob and whole food purist at heart and any recipe that uses jars and cans kind of makes me cringe.  BUT, my family loves Mexican food and we desperately needed a break from the same old dishes I was making.  I had a killer craving for some burrito style food so I took a chance and thought, "one meal from jars and cans won't be that bad".  What a mistake!  My family LOVED this.  My husband and three kids 13, 11, 10 went burrito pie crazy.  We almost had a riot start over the last two pieces.  My husband asked me to make it again three days later.  So needless to say this recipe has single handedly adulterated my whole food fed soul. So I feel I must warn others who may be mindlessly browsing through recipes and feel the supernatural tug of burrito pie power pulling them towards the endless pit of cravings it brings.  Save yourselves!  It is too late for my family but for burrito's sake, save yourselves!

I cut the meat and refried beans in half added a can of black beans and 2to 3 cups of boiled white rice to the burrito mix. I love beef and bean and rice burritos so this was a preference.

I tried the recipe tonight for our family dinner and what a huge hit.  Everyone loved it and we finished it off.  I did not change a thing, I made just as the recipe was suggested.   I did  not find adding the refried beans to the mixture made it gloppy, I did summer the suggest amount of time though.  I thought missing all ingredients together and cooking the suggested time made for a great flavor.  I will make this again and again.  Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe.   It was fantastic.

Delicious! I have been wanting to try this recipe for a while now and am so glad I did! Very easy to put together and great flavor for a one pan meal. I did alter it a bit though to what I had on hand. I had no taco sauce so I used a can of enchilada sauce with a bit of taco seasoning mixed in. And as our family isnt crazy about all things spicy I left out the chiles. I didn't have tortillas so I made the homemade flour tortillas from this web-site and it was a family hit! I halved the recipe and used two tortillas per layer. Fit perfectly into a 9X13 pan. I let everything simmer for about 30 min. And spread the warm refried beans on the tortillas in their own layer instead if mixing into the meat mixture. I did meat on the very bottom like stated, then tortilla, beans, meat, cheese, etc. So yummy! A keeper for sure. Cant wait to make again!

I made this last night for the first time!  I was pleasantly surprised at how much it makes! (I should have had a clue with the ingredient list!!) But, I am glad I didn't read the reviews first or I may have been tempted to make changes that certainly weren't necessary! I tried cutting some fat by using fat free refried beans and substituting ground turkey for half the meat and using lean ground beef for the other half.  All the flavors meld together well, and I found no other seasoning was necessary!  Plenty of flavor in the bottle of taco sauce it calls for. My casserole dish was a little wider than the tortillas so I cut and pieced a little and it worked fine. I actually made one large and one smaller casserole. This heats up wonderfully the next day and doesn't need anything extra.  I am sure you can add all kinds of toppings, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, avocado. But it doesn't need it.  I did use more cheese, since I like it and so I just used what I felt looked good.
All in all, I made it exactly as written.  My girls loved it!  Next time I will either half the recipe or invite more people to dinner!

I made just half recipe for the two of us; froze the half cans of tomato and chilies for another batch! It was very easy to make, but takes longer than an hour to put it on the table. Seems to be a good idea to make a full batch and freeze half for another meal.

Made this tonight for the first time. It's Easy & quick and delicious. Note I did drain the juice from the olives , I didn't see it noted but thought it would be best. I will bake again but will try the Corn Tortillas.

My husband LOVES this recipe. We are big fans of tex mex and it has all the important elements. I use ground turkey instead of beef and I also love to add green chiles, tons of cumin, cinnamon, and cilantro to this dish. At the end it's fantastic with sour cream on top and shredded colby jack! If you're vegetarian just add black beans instead of meat and it's still amazing. It also freezes well if you want an easy dinner night for later.

Entire family loved it.  I used drained black beans instead of refried beans and added some jalapeño peppers, otherwise followed the recipe.   Used a 9x13 pan (3 qt) and it was full to the top.  And it was quick and easy!

Very yummy--read reviews and made it a little spicier.  Thanks for sharing this!!  PS  Dawn G, a few of the reviews on here mentioned people had used corn tortillas so they probably come out fine.

Great recipe!  As for freezing and then baking, if you use a glass pan, just line it with foil first, then when fully frozen, remove from the glass pan, wrap thoroughly and you won't have the issue with baking in a cold glass baking dish.  You can also put your cold glass baking dish in the cold oven and let it preheat along with the oven gradually and it won't crack.

Very good and simple! Made recipe exactly, but used a 9x13 baking dish & doubled the tortillas. Next time I will add taco seasoning to the ground beef as it's cooking and will throw in some pickled jalapenos for a little more kick.

The flavor was fantastic but visually it was quite revolting.  This really doesn't plate very well.  I will make it again but will plate the individual servings with garnishs of lettuce, sour cream, avocado and cheese to camouflage how hideous it looks.

Wow, I am happily surprised that my dinner turned out so tasty.  Funny thing to say that you didn't really expect a dish you invested money and time into making would be great, but that's the truth.  I made this because I wanted to use up some canned goods that were close to expiration and leftovers.  So, here's what I did:  Defrosted 1.5 lb already browned ground beef in the microwave and then cooked it for a while with about 2 cloves of garlic and the remainder of a red onion (probably 3/4) left in the fridge.  Then dumped one can of refried beans, a 4oz can of Hatch chiles, a LARGE can (28 oz I think) of green chile enchilada sauce, taco seasoning packet, a tablespoon or so of cumin, a tablespoon of chile powder, a tablespoon of ground cayenne (I like spicy.) and a teaspoon or so of chipotle chile powder.  (Wish I'd used even more cayenne.)  Cooked all of this about 25 minutes to let the flavors meld.  Meanwhile, I chopped up black olives, gathered the remainder of a bag of shredded Mexican cheese, a baggy of leftover Cotija cheese and the corn tortillas in my fridge that also had to be used or tossed.   Spread some of the meat mixture on the bottom and then a doubled layer of crisped tortillas, more meat, Mexican cheese mix, Cotija cheese, black olives and jalapeno slices.  Repeated this about 2 more times, ending with more tortillas with cheese, olives and chopped green onions on top.  Cooked about 30 minutes at 375.  Delish and used everything up I intended. :)

Good recipe for a potluck. I would recommend using fresh corn tortillas that you can get for $2/lb at a Mexican grocery store if possible, and really layer it up. I used salsa in place of the taco sauce. Corn would also be a nice addition. I only used 1 lb.  ground beef, and added homemade taco seasoning.

i will add this to the collection of recipes i make! this recipe makes a lot so I cut in half beings I'm only cooking for two. I used 1lb hamburger, 8oz taco sauce, 16oz refried beans, and left out the olives otherwise followed the recipe for all the other ingredients. Also layered with 2-3 tortillas at a time like other reviewers suggested. Served with mexican rice. Turned out delicious!

I think that this recipe was really good. My husband kept saying this is good and eating more! A few changes based on comments on the site. Added 1 package of taco seasoning to the meat. Next time I will use turkey instead. Used regular diced tomatoes - 14 oz can. Used salsa instead of taco sause- I'd recommend mild salsa. I used medium and that gives quite a kick. Used 1 can refried beans and 1 can hot chili beans. spread the refried beans on the tortillas and then layered the beans with the meat and cheese.  Used whole wheat tortillas, low fat cheddar cheese. After cooking I put sliced avacado, shredded lettuce and some non-fat sour cream on top . The toppings add a lot in my opinion so don't omit. 
The other issue I had was that it seemed like there was too much liquid so I drained some off. DON't DO THAT! You will need it as the liquid gets absorbed into the tortillas. 
This makes two 11x 7 ( 2 quart ) casseroles. Freeze one and enjoy later! I will definately make this again!

This was so easy, but made a TON! I followed other suggestions and let the sauce simmer longer, also used 3 tortilla per layer. One big thing to note here, in the instructions it says to use a "large skillet" this is fine for the hamburger/onion/garlic, once you add everything else there is no way it will fit in a skillet. I used a large pot. Maybe if the recipe is halved it might fit in a large skillet, but I would recommend combining like chili to simmer in a pot.

I cut the recipe down to 4 servings.  Scaling it down I still used more beans and olives than called for, because I like them!  I used 4 large 100-calorie tortillas and cut them into 4ths so they would fit in my dish.  I added taco seasoning (minus water) to the meat then browned it.  I did not mix the beans into the meat mixture, but instead spread them on the tortillas.  I ended up with 4 layers.  I baked it covered at 350 for 30 minutes.  I uncovered it and added more cheese to the top and baked uncovered for 5 more minutes, until melted.  Super yummy!

Wonderful recipe! For once there were no leftovers! I did make a lot of changes though. As the reviews suggested not to use just one, I used two tortillas per layer and took out anything hot outside of the taco sauce. I topped the meat mixture with sour cream and medium cheddar cheese before doing another layer. This recipe was a HUGE hit my husband even brought it to work and had people try it. :)

This was very simple to make and very good.  The leftovers were even better!!  To make it a little more healthy I used ground turkey and black beans.  I'll definately be making this again!

Made as directed, with the exception that I spread the beans as a separate layer next to each meat layer.  Pretty tasty. Might add a little seasoning to the beef next time. (Edit) I gave this five stars now because it turns out to be the BF's favorite dish.

I thought this was very good. It was well seasoned, but per other reviews, I added Taco Seasoning I (by Bill Echols on this site) to the meat. I also used homemade taco sauce. This was very well spiced. I do agree with others who did not prefer the re-fried beans. Next time I will use only whole beans. I made a couple of additions: 1 pastilla pepper, and 1 cup of sweet frozen corn (adds a nice sweet crunch). I didn't add the green chilies because I didn't have any, and I used regular diced tomatoes (in pantry) More cheese would be an improvement. Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe!

I used 1lb of meat but left everything to same. I substituted ground turkey since that is what I had. I also used whole pinto and black beans to make up to lack of extra meat. Everyone loved this dish and it will prob be a regular in my fall/winter dinner rotation.

This was awesome. I did as most suggested and added taco seasoning to the ground sirloin, used a chunky hatch chile salsa instead of the taco sauce and added the refried beans on the tortilla's...I also doubled the tortilla's on each layer to give more stability to the casserole. My final modification was adding corn and removing the olives (my hubby hates them)...and topping with sour cream. This was an instant hit!

Good recipe!  I took my flour tortillas and cut them to fit square baking dish, halved recipe to serve 8.  Followed advice of another reviewer and made sure to put three tortillas in each layer.  Was out of rotel (gasp!) so used whole jar of taco bell taco sauce and some fire sauce packets kept in fridge.  Thanks for sharing!!

This was very simple and tasty.  I omitted the olives and due to pan space I just heated up the beans in the microwave and spread them on each layer of tortilla.  Also, I used half black refried beans as well.  Will definitely become a regular.

So far so good.  Didn't have the taco sause on hand so I used taco seasoning and mixed w/ water.  Also used Tobasco Hot Sause.  It turned out wonderful.  It was spicey and delicous.

OMG - delicious!  I cut the recipe in 1/2 & used ground turkey.  YUMMY!  The meat & sauce alone would make a great dip or topping over tortilla chips for nachos.

OMG, thank you for this amazing recipe. All my family finished at one time and my stepson even said he can have this every single week! Same as usual, i have changed some ingredients, used taco seasoning and salad instead taco sauce, added abit salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder. I listened to other suggestions that i didn't mix the refried beans in the meat mixture, but spread on the tortillas, then added others. Also i didn't use black olives, since we don't like it. My stepson suggested add some tortillas chip should be a good idea. How smart he is, definitly gotta try it next time.

Super easy to make.  I made 1 1/2 times the recipe, and it made three 9" round casserole tins.  Everyone loved it!  I used medium taco sauce and it had a perfect little kick.  I recommend mild taco sauce for kids and/or those who prefer less heat.  I did, like other reviewers suggested, add taco seasoning to the meat mixture and spread the tortillas with beans instead of adding them to the meat.  Served with some fruit and a nice salad.  Yum!  Will do this one again.

Good hearty meal.  Used corn tortillas because that's what I had. Added chili powder also.  Tastes like a tamale pie. MMM good!

If people would just use common sense, this recipe is great! You can always add and adjust seasoning and flavors to what you and your family prefer. And depending on how much your family eats, cut in half if all ingredients seem like too much~ This is a great recipe, thank you!

This was so delicious, I regret halving the recipe for my family of 4. I should have made the whole thing! This will be my new go-to recipe for "Mexican lasagna".

YUMMY!

I only use 1 lb of ground meat....both beef and turkey work well with this recipe.  I spread the beans on the torillas instead of mixing them in with the meat mixture.  I split the batch: I buy the throw-away deep dish pie pans, it makes two heaping pies.  Then I cook 1 and freeze 1.  My husband is proud to pull it out of the freezer and "cook" dinner for the family.  Very Very yummy!.  Each pie easily feeds a family of 4; add a side salad and waaa-la.  YUMMY

Very good. I made a couple changes: I used a can of black beans and a can of pinto beans instead of refried beans. I only used 1 lb of beef. And I added a package of taco seasoning. I also ommitted the green chilis and black olives. I let the mixture simmer for about 35 minutes. I will make this again. Very good and easy.

I made this almost exactly, however I omitted the green chilies, since the diced tomatoes already had them, and I used Cheddar Cheese instead of Colby, as it's what I had at my house. I think I should have used more tortillas, as I used 2 per layer. It was good, but didn't think it was fantasticl.

We loved this recipe!  It was even better the second day because everything stuck together better and it seemed more like a pie.  Made it as is and topped with lettuce and sour cream.  Husband added more cheese.

This was delicious and enjoyed by all!  I made two of them and froze one, each in a 9" foil pie pan.  Made each tortilla layer two tortillas thick, and spread refried beans and cheese to keep the tortillas in each layer together.  Used 1 can of refried beans in the meat mixture, and the other to spread on the tortillas.

Good starter.  Makes a lot of food. After making several times I find that we like it best with black beans and refried beans.  I only use 1lb of ground beef.

This is fantastic - but a few modifications are necessary, otherwise the layers aren't very defined.  Instead of mixing the beans, it works best if they are spread on the tortillas and then layered with the meat mixture.  Also, I use taco seasoning instead of taco sauce.  With the sauce, the meat mixture is a little to soupy, and makes the whole dish a little soggy.  We use corn tortillas (double layer) instead of flour and add jalepenos to the mixture, but that's just personal preference.  My husband always eats 3 helpings, and if there are any - the leftovers are fabulous the next day!

Made this quite a while ago, but am just now getting around to reviewing it--I remember quite well how good it was though.  It took a fair amount of time to put together.  But once you had it made, it was really good for leftovers for several days.  I doubled the layers of tortillas and sandwiched refried beans between them.  Made a nice presentation with all the layers.  Very good!

This was excellent! I followed the reviews...need to use 2-3 tortillas per layer or else they will get too soggy. I read not to mix the bean mixture in with the meat and sauce. Here is what I did: I like the idea of spreading the beans on the tortillas. The new layering order will be: meat, cheese, beany tortillas (bean side down), meat, cheese, beany tortillas etc. Top with meat sauce and cheese.

Very good!  The whole family loved it!  Sets up beautifully.  I didn't have a 4qt. casserole dish, so used two 2qt. instead.  That cut down on the tortillas I needed.  I used a mild taco sauce, 2 tbl of the diced chili peppers, since my 4 year old grandson is very sensitive to spices!  No major ingredient changes.  Great recipe, I will label it in my recipes as a "A Comfort Food!" Hearty, fillling and dellicious!

This was delicious and very filling!!  Made a few changes - used 1.5 cans of refried beans, as well as 1/2 a can of black beans and 1/2 can of corn.  Also used whole grain tortillas (from Trader Joes) and doubling up on them worked really well.  Made the recipe very mild - no chilles and no olives (I hate them).  Couldn't find taco sauce in store, so used a packet of taco seasoning powder, which was very good in a pinch.  Probably could have used more liquid as it was a little dry.  Used cheddar cheese.    Overall, this was very good, and my hubby requested that I make it again  :)

I loved this recipe! Rather than making it into a casserole, however, I simply simmered the ingredients and served in a burrito or with chips. I also substituted corn for the beans and instead of hamburger used Morning Star Ground Beef Crumbles. This made an excellent vegetarian meal that kept well in the refrigerator. All in all, I loved it and will definitely make it again!

Good recipe as long as you follow a few of the changes others have suggested.  I used 3 tortillas thick per layer.  I let the meat simmer for 30 min and I did not mix the meat mixture and the beans.

This was great! I took it to a pot luck and everyone liked it. It was really easy to make and it is easy to customize if you so choose. The only change I made was to leave out the black olives as not everyone likes them in my family. I had them available to put on top if someone wanted them. I may go with a spicier taco sauce next time as I like extra kick (I used medium).

SUPER YUMMY! My husband is allergic to beans, legumes, & soy so at 1st glance this recipe would either not work for us as a family or would be kinda boring if we just omitted the beans. B/c of his allergy, we eat some sort of meat w/almost every evening meal. Needless to say, it gets pricey. I wanted to start adding beans into my son's diet more & try to save a little $ so I started out w/this recipe. I 1/2-ed all the 'filling' ingredients (subbed salsa for taco sauce; couldn't find organic taco sauce anywhere!), left out the beans & cooked that in one pot. In another pot, I made homemade refried pintos (beans, salt, water) (SO much cheaper & IMHO SO much yummier!) & added the other 1/2 of the 'filling' ingredients to it (saute onion 1st) (& using only 1/4 of the jar of salsa b/c my son & I don't really care for super spicy things) & left out the peppers & olives too. As I was getting the beans ready, I felt bad for my husband - they were so yummy & creamy & his filling was so... ground beef-looking. LOL So, I added about a cup of sour cream, thinking it would thicken it up. WRONG! It was SO watery! So I removed some of the watery-ness & mixed it w/corn starch, stirred it back in, cooked it up again, & voila - creamy. I used two square glass baking dishes w/the meat filling in one & the bean filling in the other. I used 6 tortillas total (2 layers for each dish) & just tore them into pieces to cover the filling/cheese. If you are vegetarian or allergic to beans HTH!!

This was a big hit. I used ground turkey and 2% colby jack to make it healthier. I also added a packet of taco seasoning to the turkey as I browned it and added sour cream when serving.

Yummy!!!  I didn't even bother to read the reviews and make changes.  I think that my can of chilis was bigger, and I used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce.  Standard can sizes of the other stuff.  I used about 1 lb of cheese total.  This turned out very tasty; I may read the reviews and get additional change ideas, or I might just keep making it this way because we thought it was great!

I'm giving it a four as written, but some tweaking will definately make it a five. To start I used a non-stick 2" high 9" springform pan. My recipe ends up being medium not hot, but adding a can of jalapenos instead of green chili's will take care of that. One can of refried beans is plenty, but don't add them to the meat mixture. I browned the beef with a little salt then added 1 can of enchilada sauce, one can of tomato sauce, one jar of hot salsa,and 1/2 tsp of chili powder, garlic powder, and cumin. I used whole grain tortillas which hold up much better and don't mush out, and with all the sauce no one will ever know.  If you use a non stick pan don't spray the bottom. Starting from the bottom the layers go...tortilla, pepperjack cheese onion and chili's, tortilla, meat sauce, tortilla with beans placed bean side down on meat, cheddar cheese, onions, and chili's, tortilla, meat sauce, tortilla with beans side on meat, pepper jack cheese onions and chili's, torilla, meat sauce, tortilla with bean side on meat, and finish off with cheddar on top. Bake for about 30 min. until the cheese is brown and bubbly, and let it sit for at least 30 min before releasing the pan sides it needs to cool in order to set well. served with sour cream on the side. DELISH.

I found this recipe to be easy and VERY good!  I was in the mood for Mexican last night, so I used what I had on hand - no can of plain chilis, but there were chilis in the can of tomatoes.  I added some extra tomatoes, diced, from the garden, a can of corn, and used corn tortillas in place of the flour because it was all I had.  It was VERY good and I will make it again - and maybe add a bell pepper next time, too!

A great recipe! Of course I've played around with it, according to what I have in the house.  The first time I made it, I followed someone's advice and doubled up on the burritos when layering, but found it's not necessary.  Thanks for a new family favorite!

I have made this many times now. It's always good! I put sour cream on top after it's done cooking. I like that there are flour torillas in this casserole, not corn.  Definitely has become a favorite.

Me and my kids love this.  I made changes to the recipe and it turns out to be even tastier.  I use taco seasoning without water instead of taco sauce, I add a couple cans of drained mexicorn, and use black beans (drained) instead of refried beans.  I use more tortillas, and use a fiesta cheese blend.  This is really good and never lasts long at my house.  I also omit the black olives, as we do not like them.  Have made this several times and will continue to do so.

I tried 5 various, new recipes this week and this is the ONLY ONE my 19 yr/old son wants me to make again.  Great recipe and the comments were helpful.  Worked great in a springform pan and let sit for 5 min and sliced perfectly.I also used 1/2 pkg of taco seasoning, and spread the refried beans on to the tortillas as suggested.  I did use taco sauce (hot-was perfect)and cheddar cheese.  This recipe is awesome since you can customize it to your liking or whatever you have on hand. Can't mess this up, no matter what changes you make.  (a 1/2 recipe in a springform pan serves 4 very large appetites)

This recipe gets a 4 because it's an inspiration for an improved customized version.

I made three changes:  I used ground turkey instead of beef and I omitted the olives.  I also did not mix the refried beans in with the meat, but instead used them as a separate layer.

I cut this recipe in half since we are a household of 2 and it made more than enough for dinner and lunch the following day.  This is a great starter recipe, but I will make changes in the future.

First, it was not spicy enough for my taste.  Second, the use of taco sauce and diced tomatoes made the casserole taste suspciously like lasagna, not what I want in a Mexican-inspired dish.  I will use enchilada sauce, taco seasoning, and fresh jalapenos in the future to avoid that tomato-y Italian flavor.

On the positive side, the texture is beautiful, it slices easily, and the refried beans are really great in this dish.  The consistency reminds me of a bean burrito.  The only thing I didn't like about the presentation of this dish is that the cheese never bubbled and shined.

Overall, this is a good family recipe that needs more spice and less tomato-y flavor.

I think it was pretty yummy.  Probably would be better if I made the exact recipe but I tried fixing it for my Weight Watchers points.  So I ended up using a 300g chicken breast, a can of kidney beans mashed and 4 1/2 tortillas.  I had to cut back on a bit of the cheese as well.  Topped with sour cream and avocado and loved it!  I cooked my chicken and then shredded it and seasoned it with Mexican seasoning.  My kids loved it as well!  OH and I added double the amount of olives cause my girls love 'em ;)

I've made this three times now and everyone has asked for the recipe.  I agree that spreading the beans on the tortillas is definitely the way to go.  Cutting the tortillas in half and placing the flat part against the side of the baking dish makes for the most efficient use of space.  This fits exactly in a 13x9 pan.

Absolutely scrumptious. I could eat this all day. 

You'll need a couple very deep pans for this though. I manage to fill up two deep casserole dishes each time i make it. Serves eight comfortably.

This is definitely a great base recipe for the ultimate mexican 'lasagna'.  I've found that the more I make it, the more I like to modify and add in other favorites.  I personally think that a can of black beans in place of the refried beans is just as tasty, and love to add other faves such as fresh corn, cilantro, and chipotle peppers in adobo (for a great spicy, smokey flavor).  Always add extra cheese and make sure to have sour cream waiting.

This was a big hit. It was even better the next day as the flavors were able to meld together a little more. added extra chile and will probably season the meat next time.

This was so yummy and easy to make.  I combined all of the ingredients before work and put it in the refridgerator and when I got home I stuck it in the oven. My only criticism would be that I'm not sure I like the soggy texture of the tortillas but I'm not sure how to change that...

Both my picky sister and husband loved this.  I took the advice of others and added a packet of taco seasoning, but next time I'll probably only do half a package as it overpowered the dish a bit and became more of a "taco pie."  Served it with sour cream and it was delicious!

I used 3 tortillas per layer and I let it rest for about 10 minutes before trying to slice it up.  I think that helped because we didn't have the soupy mess some people seem to have had.  We probably could have just used 2 tortillas per layer.

I followed the recommendation of others and doubled each layer of tortilla and served this on shredded lettuce.  I found that when we went back for seconds, the meal tasted a little better the second time around (it wasn't as 'wet' and held together much better).  I think that next time I'll allow the Burrito Pie to sit for 20 or so minutes before serving.  

My husband had leftovers at work and emailed me to tell me how great it tasted!  I'll definitely make this dish again!

Fantastic! My whole house smelled like our favorite Mexican restaurant!  I agree with Taylor..I cut the recipe in half as well and it STILL made more than enough! Hopefully, it will freeze well.  A couple of "serve with" suggestions.  I made homemade quacomole ('course you can buy it too!), salsa, sour cream, green onions (scallions ~ for garnish) and corn chips.  Sort of a big "fiesta"! I didn't change any of the ingredients...we love olives .    When choosing the sauces, chiles, etc. you can opt for hotter varieties (to those of you who thought there wasn't enough flavor/spice) or, as was suggested, add hot pepper sauce, cumin..whatever.  We loved it and it's a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

I tried this two times. Once with flour tortillas and once with corn tortillas and honestly I liked it a LOT better with corn tortillas. It almost seemed kind of lasagna like then. And make sure the top of the Burrito Pie is layered with tortillas and cheese but not meat, meat on top burns easily.

I have prepared and eaten the traditional Mexican recipes of my heritage all my life.  However this "gringo-Mexican" dish is really good!  I easily cut the recipe in half as it makes so much.  I added the entire amount for the olives and chopped green chiles so they wouldn't go to waste.  Turned out great.

Made this weekend after receiving it as my daily email. This is great... Made a few changes, used aroung 1 1/2 lb ground chuck, no olives,no green chiles, mexican cheese and used the thicker flour tortillas. It was spicy enough for us and the leftovers warmed up great. Definetly a keeper for my family. Thanks

My family loved it. Next time I think I'll half the recipe (it makes a TON!) and add crushed taco chips on top before serving. Also, my family likes spice and hot! This was pretty bland to them w/o spicing it up w/salsa and hot sauce after. Next time I'll add the spice to the receipe when cooking!

I made this the first time it came around.  I add a can of rinsed and drained kidney beans.  I don't put the green chilis in as I don't think they add too much to a dish.  I also only use 1-1/2 lbs of ground meat, and it makes a lasagna dish full.

Very good.  Alterations I made included reducing ground beef to 1 pound, using only 1 can of refried beans, and substituting a can of diced tomatoes for the ro-tel style tomatoes. It was perfectly spiced to my taste, and popular with the family.

This was just way too heavy for me. If I ever did make it again I'd cut the amount of meat to half. Sits like an anchor in your stomach.

The meat & bean mixture is great!  BUT, I noticed the tortillas were soggy after you baked it & that I didnt like.  So, I made burritos out of the mixture I had left over & thta was GREAT!  I will countunue to make the meat/bean mix. just not in the pie form but for tacos & burritos.

I love this recipe and have made it many times. I add taco seasoning to the beef for added flavor and use low-carb tortillas instead of regular flour ones. I omit the olives and top with sour cream and salsa.  Follow the directions and combine the refried beans to the meat mixture in the pan before you spread it in the dish.  It saves time (instead of layering the beans and meat seperately) and tastes the same either way after cooking! Burrito Pie is well worth the five star rating!

Very good, tasted like a wet burrito.  I would have rather used the filling to MAKE actual wet burritos though.  Also, FYI for anyone who does make this lasagna style.  You might want to consider putting 2 layers of tortillas when you layer them, one layer seemed to bake into the filling and become too mushy.  The photo of it, HAS to be more than one layer of tortilla, or else they are just VERY thick!

We loved this Mexican idea.  My husband and I made it together and we thought it was easy and delicious.  So what else do we need???
This recipe is one of my favorites.

This was very good.  I did omit a few of the ingredients because our eaters don't like them, and it still turned out well.  We didn't use the olives or the green chiles (because of this omittance of flavor we added some taco seasonings to the meat for added flavor).  This was an easy meal to prepare and tated great.  Will make again, thanks for the post.

Not great.  Even with all of the ingredients, it still tasted pretty bland to us and the flour tortillas were sticky.  It might be better if the tortillas were toasted a little before adding to the casserole or corn tortillas might work.  It wasn't worth the effort and this is one I most likely will not be making again.

The meat filling is the best I've tasted; however, I won't layer with flour tortillas next time, since it tends to get soggy.  Might try just filling individual tortillas and add lettuce and tomato.

This came out SOOOO good!  I took it to a Christmas potlatch and everyone LOVED it!  It was really easy to make too!  I would suggest that you use your largest skillet/frying pan for cooking this; there's a lot!  Also, make sure that your layers are really thin or else you won't be able to use all 12 tortillas (it still comes out great though!).

This was soooo very yummy.  Add a little salsa on the side, and watch it get gobbled up.  Ok, you can have sour cream too.  Make sure to use your absolute largest pyrex you have, I used a 15x19, and I still could have gone up a size.  This will leave you with leftovers for the next few nights, but it's so yummy you won't even care that you're eating the same dish three nights in a row.

This was a very good recipe.  My husband ate 3rd!  Only thing I did differently is that I bought refried beans from my favorite Tex-Mex restaurant, way better than canned. Very easy, very fast - its a keeper.

2006: I thought this recipe was great! I halfed most of the ingredients and left out what I'm not a big fan of (ie olives, green chili peppers) and it came out perfect.  Boyfriend loved it and ate most of it!  Definitely a keeper. ***2009 UPDATE*** I had completely forgot about this recipe having lost my recipe card, found it again after looking through my recipe box. We tried it again last night and it came out great again! I think we might try it with chicken next time. Assuming I can hang on to my recipe card this time, I think this will be in regular rotation at our house! Oh, and bf who is now hubby, still loves it! He had the leftovers for breakfast, which is truly the mark of a great recipe at our house ;-)

My family LOVES this recipe!  I incorporated some of the previous reviewers' suggestions.  I added our favorite Taco Bell seasoning to the meat (sans the water)and also pulsed the meat in a food processor before adding the olives, chilis, tomatoes w/ chilis and salsa.  I spread spicy refried bean on the tortillas; used jalapenos in place of the green chilis and canned tomatoes with jalapenos as well.  I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9" cake pan (perfect!) because I wasn't sure how the leftovers would be.  The leftovers were even better, so I'll make the full recipe next time.  Thanks for sharing Kathi.

Since it's just me and my husband right now, I used only 1 lb of beef and also used 12 oz. of cheese.  I made 3 big layers and I like sour cream so I  put a tortilla on top and spread a layer of sour cream on it,  then added some shredded lettuce and fresh tomato. Will make again!

I thought this was pretty good, but my husband loved it! I did alter it a bit, I used a jar of salsa in place of the canned tomatoes and chiles and omited the taco sauce(since I had neither on hand) and I buttered the tortillas slightly and sprinkled garlic salt on them then heated in skillet before each layer and added more cheese. But all in all I will make again since my husband said it was a keeper!  Thanks!

Oh My!!!  Wonderful!  My family LOVED this - kids and all.  I left out the olives (didn't have any and used sharp cheddar cheese.  I found I didn't have to be too picky with the ingredients.  I look forward to making this again and changing things up a bit.  Boy it makes a ton (couldn't fit it into my casserole dish)!  I used the leftover beans and tomatoes in a hearty soup from this site.

OK first off, i half this recipe.  Sometimes i vary taco sauce with salsa.  I use chedder cheese cause thats what i have onhand.  Overall a very versitle recipe you can play with, try using enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce for a different flavor.  I have been using this recipe as a base for years, it is one of my husband's most asked for meals.

The whole family enjoyed this.  It looks good and cuts great if you let it stand 10 minutes or so before serving.  Even better the next day.  I reviewed other's suggestions before making this and decided to add 1/2 tsp. cumin and 2 tsp. mexican oregano to the meat mixture. (After trying it this way I think adding an entire envelope of taco seasoning, as other reviewers suggested would be unnecessary and also too salty, the flavor is already in there.) I also used an entire 6 oz. can of olives because we really like them.  Instead of 10 oz. rotel tomatoes I used a 16 oz. can of Del Monte petite cut tomatoes with jalapeno peppers.  I used mild taco sauce to make it kid friendly and the end result was flavorful but not hot at all.  Those who like heat will want to use medium or hot taco sauce.  I did replace one can of refried beans with 1 can black beans.  Gave it nice texture and color.  I did not have to cut the recipe in half to make it fit in a 9 x 13 pan.  In fact I added a few more tortillas and another cup of cheese (I used 4-cheese Mexican blend) so I could make a third layer.  It fit perfectly.  I think I will make it in two 9 x 9 pans next time and freeze one for later. Sour cream on top was really good.  This is a very filling dinner.

This was a great and different mexican dish.  My husband isn't even a mexican fan and we both loved it.  I took the suggestion of previous reviewers and halved it to make a 9x13.  I actually made an 8x8 and froze the other 8x8.  I also added corn and black beans and deleted the olives.  Thanks for the new recipe.

Very tasty. I only used 1lb beef and 1 can of refried beans. I couldn't find "taco sauce" so I used 1 can of tomato sauce, 1 package of taco seasoning, and a dash of tabasco. I also added some chopped jalapeno peppers. It gave it just the slightest kick.

Great recipe - will be using this again. :)

I wish I could add more stars!!  *******  This was a wonderful dish...very filling too!  The only changes I made were the amount of tortillas (only used 2 per layer, for a total of six 8in tortillas) And I used much more cheese (Mexican Blend) than called for!  Was not too spicy either.  I have a six year old who is anti-spicy; and she loved it!  I also served with sour cream on top.  As the family now says: "It's a keeper"!

This was awesome! I added a lot more spices including red pepper, hot sauce, and taco powder to ground beef.  I also added diced jalapenos and used a mexican cheese blend.  I messed up and started with beef layer first but it did not make a difference.  My husband and I ate nearly half the burrito pie in one sitting!  This is going to be a regular at our house. Oh I also used a 9x13 dish.

This was "great".  I made it last night and have about half left over which will probably be even better for leftovers! I halved the ground beef and used only one can of beans and used a 9x13 pan.  I also used corn tortillas which probably held it together better.  We like the taste of black olives so to be sure the taste of the olives wasn't smothered by the other ingredients, I layered them "sliced" with the cheese.  Turned out just right!  Thanks for a great recipe.  Oh yes, one of the best parts is that clean up is easy and once you have it in the oven, that's it!

This recipe was enjoyed by my family. I halved everything except the cheese. I baked it in a 3 quart Corning Ware casserole, which was perfect!! Like many others, we thought the recipe a bit bland. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, but next time will add even more. Like many others, I used salsa instead of taco sauce, since that is what I had on hand. I also used crushed tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes. Next time I would add extra crushed tomatoes to make the recipe a little more moist. Overall, a great recipe!!!

I made this tonight, and have to admit I was re-reading the reviews while it baked.  Began to get a little scared, but we LOVED it.  If I was serving it to a group I would probably garnish with a little lettuce, cheese, sour cream and quacamole!  However, my husband and I ate it with some warm tortillas and sour cream and it was DELICIOUS!!!  Definately a keeper in our household!

Easy to make and sooooooo deelicious!!! Whoever says that this looks and tastes bad, probably didn't do this right. I added a little more beef than what was called for to make the sauce/meat thicker. It tasted great even with the tortillas being soft. I will make this again for sure.

I had made tacos two nights before and had a lot of leftover taco meat to use up so I tried this recipe.  My husband is on a mostly protien diet and trys to stay away from white flour.  I used 100% whole wheat tortillas instead of white flour tortillas.  I also skipped the chiles so it wouldn't be overly spicy for the kids and served it with a spicy salsa on the side for the adults.  It turned out great for all.  Easy to make and a crowd pleaser.

My 10 year old said, "This is a 5 star recipe! I rate this right below mac and cheese!" That about says it all coming from a kid. 
My husband said "Oh yeah. I'd eat it again" so it's been added to our recipe box! We don't like our food too spicy so you might want to add more spice if you like a "kick" in your mexican food.

This was AMAZING, everyone that tried some couldn't stop themselves from eating it.  I added some corn and a can of red kidney beans and mozeralla cheese.  This was fantastic and I would recomend it to everyone!!

Very good.  Thanks.  I halved the recipe (with a little extra meat) and still had enough for 2, 9" square pans.  Put the extra one in the freezer for a quick meal later on.  Family loved it and we don't usually go for refried beans.

This was pretty good.  I used one can of black beans and one can of refried beans so it wouldn't be so thick.  You'll probably want to use small tortillas, because I have a bunch left over that didn't fit in my baking dish.  This really needs tomato, lettuce and maybe cilantro to lighten it up - it weighs a ton and there's a lot of it.

Very bland taste with no texture.  If you like this type of dish, I'd recommend making enchiladas or something that has some flavor to it!

Loved this recipe. Have made it several times, always good. We did not find it spicy at all. Makes alot, but great as leftovers! Topped with lettuce, tomato, green onion, taco sauce, & sour cream. I did have to cook alittle longer than recipe asked.

Fantastic!  It's so good and makes a lot! More than 6 servings, like it says.  One thing I would suggest is to drain off most or all of the fat.  I made this twice and forgot to drain off the fat, it turned out really soggy and greasy at the end.  Second time around, I drained the fat and it came out perfect.  Topped off with sour cream and hot sauce, it's magnificient!

Faaaaannnnntasstic!!!!  This is my favorite recipe!  I generally cook the main mixture 2 or 3 hours and use lots of cheese and a dash or twelve of Texas Pete (which I find the best hot sauce, ever!).  One square of this and you are a couch potato and ready for a nap.  But you wanna eat more.  Very dense.  Top with lettuce, cheese, sour cream and tomato or salsa and you're good to go.  I like it with homemade cornbread or baked creamed corn and a small salad.

I added fire roasted corn to the ingredients. I did as a few others and doubled the tortillas. That made a big difference and more like the lasagna.

Made a few changes: 1 lb ground beef, 1 can refried beans, 1/4 cup of salsa and 1 T Mexican seasoning, the rest stayed the same.  I used a large baking dish.  Layers: meat, cheese, 2 extra large flour tortillas. Served it with sour cream and salsa and avocado on the side. I would not say it was "mushy".  Just soft and cheesy and really delicious like a burrito!  Will make again for sure.

This was such an easy and delicious recipe. My whole family loved it! I used 8oz of mild taco sauce and 8oz of medium. You can also make it hotter by adding chipotle pepper.

We really enjoyed this!  It needs something with some crunch, but the flavor was great!  Will make again!

I made this recipe for the first time yesterday for friends, and it was a huge hit! Everyone loved it, and there were hardly any leftovers. What I read from quite a few other reviews was that the mixture was too wet, which made the tortillas mushy. So I only used about half of the 16oz jar of taco sauce, and did not mix the refried beans into the meat. I let the meat mixture with everything else cook for about 30 minutes, which helped the mixture to absorb much of the liquid. After spreading a thin layer of the meat mixture in the pan (a 9x13 pan worked great), I dolloped the 1 can of refried beans on top of the meat and cheese before placing the first layer of tortillas in the pan. Then repeated with the second layer. I ended up only using 1 can of refried beans, and it was enough. I also placed the tortillas in a dry saute pan one at a time to dry them out a bit before placing in between the layers of the meat, cheese, and beans. After baking the dish for about 30 minutes, I drizzled the remaining taco sauce on top and added some sliced scallions. Served with fresh guacamole, sour cream, and salsa. Fantastic!

Halved the recipe and used salsa instead of diced tomatoes. I added frozen corn to the meat mixture and spread the refried beans on the tortillas. I would definitely make this again, but only use half a can of refried beans to suit our tastes. This a great base recipe you can tweak to your preferences.

This was great! The recipe makes quite a large batch so take that into consideration. I originally thought it would be too much taco sauce, but it really bumped up the flavor without being overpowering. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I made a double batch of this recipe for a homeless shelter dinner. Since several guests are children, I omitted the extra green chiles. I also kept a small pan for my family. Everyone enjoyed this dinner, but I made it with corn tortillas which I pan fried first. Very easy to make in a large batch and transport. Thanks for a good recipe, will likely make again for shelter guests and our own family.

Followed this recipie exactly - only thing I did was half the ingredients so it would fit in a 9x13 pan. I Totally understand the importance of adding the refried beans in the meat mixture - it's a thickening agent.  Served with a little sour cream and salsa- sooo good. Hubby and I ate half the pan.  Thanks for sharing!!!!  Will make again :)

Easy & tasty! A little on the hot side - we eliminated the green chilies and that made a great difference for us.

This is a solid recipe. There are just two of us, so I split it into two separate pie tins and popped one in the freezer for an easy meal later on.  The tortillas I bought fit just about right in the pie pans. Followed other cooks' advice and smeared the beans on a double layer of tortillas. Worked out great! Can't attest to the frozen pie yet, but the fresh one was on point. I pretty much used what I had on hand - just 1# beef, half an onion, some taco seasoning, picante instead of taco sauce, cheddar and jack instead of Colby, whole wheat tortillas - the recipe is pretty forgiving that way. I think corn or additional beans would also be nice in the sauce layers, or some condensed cheddar cheese soup.  I served it in wedge shaped slices with a dollop of sour cream, picante sauce, a couple of olives, and some sliced avocado. My honey gave it a "D" and then clarified that the D stood for "Delicious ". :)

Made this recipe as is and it was gone in one night. I like somebody's idea of putting the beans as their own layer and I think I will try it next time. But even with it mixed all together, it was awesome. I served this with a dallop of guacamole and sour cream. It was cheap, quick and easy to make and my family ate every last bite.

This was great and will be part of our menu rotation. I especially like to use recipes that can be frozen for later or shared with friends and family who need an occasional meal. I followed happywife05 review and used more tortillas in the layers and also LISAKP71 review to use taco seasoning in the meat (definitely needed!) and spread the beans on the tortillas instead of blending with meat mixture. Took this to a potluck last night and got rave reviews and recipe requests. Good job KATHICM!

This was a little bland until I added a packet of taco seasoning.  I also used seasoned black beans instead of the refried beans.  Used only two (double) layers of tortillas. It was very good, but not at all spicy. Would be good with some jalapenos on the side.

Amazing. I used low sodium everything and low carb shells. Organic low sodium refried beans and just a half pound of turkey. ( reduced recipe for two people) i used a glass pie plate. I did add just a half a spoon full of no fat cream cheese to make it a little creamy and weight watchers Mexican cheese. I broiled it for a few minutes to get it crispy on top. Red pepper flakes while cooking turkey .. Oh I used turkey instead of beef ??

This was awesome! I also left the beans and meat mixture separate. I did a layer of 3 flour tortillas on the bottom, beans spread on them, one thick layer of meat mixture, a layer of cheese, then a layer of 3 white corn tortillas, and another layer of beans, meat, then cheese. I also saved the olives and put them on top about halfway through cooking time. BIG HIT!!

Didn't like this at all, didn't even want to give it one star, but had no choice.  Definitely needs seasoning very bland and mushy, and recipe should have been cut in half for sure.

Thought this tasted really good!  Made as directed, but next time I will cut back on the amount of refried beans and maybe not mix with the meat.  Instead I would layer beans separately like another reviewer suggested.  All in all a good recipe and I will definitely make again.

This is incredible. I had to leave out the onion due to some here not liking them but wow so good. Made 2 9 in. pans full. We did add an extra bag of cheese to it otherwise there wouldn't have been enough to make 2. Topped with sour cream, tomatoes, lettuce, and salsa. Wish I could give this one 10 stars..We still have a pan left in here for tonight.

My family loved this recipe and asks for it almost every week! It's a bit high in caleries so I do not to make it that much though. 
I changed a few things: I use ground turkey with some flavoring of my own and I use enchilada sauce inside the recipe instead of taco sauce, we use the taco sauce to spicy it up on our plates. Other then those, we loved this recipe!! Thanks!

you can use corn tortillas for a gluten free recipe and use salsa instead of a jar of taco sauce, and just use taco season. if you can't find a jar of taco sauce. Just Yummy

Simply Fantastic!!! The only thing I changed was adding my Pork Green Chili instead of a jar taco sauce however that is simply a matter of taste. I also cut this recipe in half because I don't have a large family but this is great for a party, office party, pot luck and so on.

i essentially turned this into mexican lasagna. made some small changes....

1. I used 1/2 chorizo and half beef with taco seasoning.
2. i used the tomato and chile w/cilantro and lime juice (all in 1 can)and mixed that in with the refried beans.

here is how i did the layers.

taco sauce, tortilla, bean/tomato, meat, cheese and then repeat.  after the last topping of cheese i ran some taco sauce in rows over the top and sprinkled with some olives...very very good.

you can add some fritos for crunch and sour cream for creaminess when served.

I've made this 2-3 times now and the first time I made it exactly as written. It was very good, but as everyone says makes way too much for just one dish. I divide in two an freeze one for later as well. We enjoyed it and we'll be keeping this one in the rotation.

I did make a few modifications. I added a pkg of taco seasoning to the cooked meat mixture and about 4oz mild taco sauce and simmered for 30 mins. I spread the beans on the tortilla, meat side down and doubled up on the tortillas each layer. Topped it off with sliced pickled jalepeno peppers and the cheese. Made in a 9x13 pan. So yummy!!

I made this last night, but 8 servings instead of 16.  I also skipped the can of green chilis and only used the tomatoes with green chilis and half of the amount of taco sause.  I used mild taco sauce.  I'm not a fan of spicy hot.  Everyone loved it.  I topped it with diced fresh tomaotes, chopped lettuce and some sour cream.  YUMMY!

This recipe is very kid friendly,  kids can help assemble their own individual pie with the toppings they like.  I used whole wheat tortillas and only used three for each pie.  I made two small pies, and three larger ones using this recipe.  One small pie was for a vegetarian, so just used sauce and a variety of beans (whole and veg refried) , tomatoes, onions and cheese.  Made one kicking up the heat for my son and minus cheese and my husbands without beans ( allergic to them) and my daughters minus tomatoes and extra beans.  Everyone enjoyed their pies!  Much quicker to make than enchilladas and just as yummy!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I was very happy that this turned out so well. The hubby and kids loved it. I didn't think I would but I did too.
I used taco seasoning instead of chopping onions and garlic. Also, I didn't have taco sauce so I used a small can of tomato sauce. Everything else was pretty much the same. I did take the advice of others and used 3 tortillas for each layer and it made a huge difference. So, make sure you do too.

Really good recipe. I made the following (minor) modifications: I have a 4-year-old son and a boyfriend who eats a lot, so I definitely didn't cut the recipe as some suggested; the leftovers got eaten. I omitted the green chilis and used regular diced tomatos rather than the ones with chile peppers. I also used mild taco sauce and I'm sure if you prefer spicy then medium would be good. I also took the advice of another reviewer and used 2 tortillas per layer. This recipe is a keeper.

Just got through eating this and OMG!! It was sooo yummy. I did do a few things different. I added taco seasoning to the meat, used salsa instead of taco sauce (that's what I had on hand), and I used tostada shells instead of tortillas. Oh and I put the refried beans on the shells, bean side down, like a few others suggested. In the end it made an awesome casserole that I will make again and again.

The husband loves this dish. If he could he would eat this three times a week. I love the flavors. It is awsome. M one year old daughter eats this with no problem. I do add taco seasoning to the meat, but everything else is the same.

We all enjoyed this. I only used one pound of beef, and I used a jar of chunky salsa rather than the taco sauce and the diced tomatoes. I also kept my meat sauce and the beans separate rather than mixing them.

Lovely!  Made this for my hubby and 2 young kids... although cut down on the amounts and the spice!  Used one pd beef, half an onion, 2 cloves minced garlic, half can olives, no chili peppers, regular diced tomatoes with celery and onion, mild taco sauce, 1 can refried beans and 3 large tortillas cut up to fit a round glass casserole (it's all I had on hand).  Loaded up on the cheese and cooked as directed.  SOOOOOO good!  Served with mild salsa and sour cream.  Hubby and kiddos (1 and 3.5) LOVED it and clamored for more.  This would make an excellent potluck dish.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe! I did change a few things. Instead of using the taco sauce, I just seasoned my meat with taco seasoning. To the meat mixture, I added some black beans and let it simmer for 30 minutes to help meld the flavors together. When layering I used three tortillas for each layer as stated in other reviews, I did notice that it helped keep the structure and texture.

Yummy!!  This is a delicious recipe.  My husband loves it.   I have only one suggestion.  When combining all the ingredients, my large skillet wasn’t large enough.  I will use my Dutch oven next time.  Thanks for sharing.

Pretty good meal. Real simple to make. We left out the tomatoes and taco sauce and instead dumped some salsa in there. We also added spicy taco seasoning to the meat.

Halved recipe. Used ground venison instead of beef and didn't have olives. Other than that, followed recipe exactly. Used 2 tortillas per layer, had 3 tortilla layers overall. Put in round 2 qt dish. Very good. Just the perfect amount of heat, not too hot at all.

This was amazing!  Like, you keep taking another bite because something so simple cant really taste that good, fantastic!  I even used ground turkey, fat free refried beans, whole wheat tortillas, and reduced fat cheese and it was still great.  This is definitely going to make it into our rotation. This made a FULL 9x13 pan for me, so I think the next time I try this I'm going to try to put it in two 8x8 pans and freeze one.

 Thanks KATHIMC  for the great recipe!

Let me start by prefacing with "I am not a casserole dish/dinner type of person." But this one is a keeper recipe. I followed the advice to spread the beans onto the bottom tortilla shell and to use 3 tortilla per layer. I only had enough for 2 layers in a 9x9 pan with 1/2 of the recipe. Which means I had tortilla with cheese sprinkled on it as my top layer. I was nervous it would burn but it didn't. In fact, it added a nice crispiness to the dish. Next time I'm making a full batch to save one for the freezer!

The kids like it with regular tomatoes, not hot ones. It makes it a little blander, but that can be adjusted a little with the taco sauce. This is a staple in my house: there are five of us, and this makes quite a bit.

I didn't end up following the recipe exactly as I discovered in the midst of dinner prep that DH hadn't purchased taco sauce at the store. I also used the bean mix from our homemade burritos because I had leftovers. However even with the tweaking I was pretty true to the recipe and it was a huge, huge, hit. My 7 year old had thirds!

I don't like to review recipes that I didn't follow exactly but this was such a good base recipe that I have to give it 5 stars! I made changes to suit my own taste. For the meat sauce I followed the recipe except made the following changes: 1 lb ground beef, 6 oz can black olives, 16 oz can black beans- drained and rinsed, 1 large chopped jalapeno with seeds, 1 chopped green pepper, 1 package taco seasoning, 3/4 of the jar of taco sauce, and about 1 cup of salsa I threw in just to use it up. I also seasoned the meat right away with salt and pepper. I mixed a 16 oz can of refried black beans with about a 1/2 cup of sour cream in a separate bowl then layered it on the tortillas followed by the meat sauce then cheese. I used pepperjack instead of Colby except on the top. I'd give it a spice rating of 3 on a scale of 1(mild) to 5 (hot). I used two tortillas between each layer but next time will use three. I also only made three layers to try to cut down on carbs but the bottom half turned out soggy so next time I will use a shallower pan, more tortilla layers with less filling in between, and nix the bean/sour cream mix for another can of whole beans in the meat. The mistakes were my own and the flavor still excellent! I made 6 small burritos with the leftover meat sauce, tortillas, and extra cheese I had, wrapped well and froze for later. Again, 5 stars for a great base recipe!

This pleasantly surprises me every time I make this!  Very easy and very good! I usually use salsa instead of taco sauce.

Like other reviewers, I browned the ground beef with cumin, chili powder, etc.  I also divided the recipe into 2 glass pie plates...one to try immediately and one to save for later.  It was delish!  I can't wait to get the other one out of the freezer!  The next time I make it I will put more than one tortilla in the layers to give it a little more substance.
Great recipe to add ingredients that you love.

We loved this! I used all the ingredients plus a can of black beans and half a bag of frozen yellow corn. We used a 9x13 baking dish. Per others' suggestions we put the refried beans on the tortillas first. The way we layered the tortillas was we put one on each end of the pan so that they over lapped in the middle and then cut one in half and put a half on each end so the tortilla layer was close to the same thickness the length of the pan.

very easy and exceptionally yummy. Will make agian. This recipe will surely satisfy your mexican food craving with out the big hacienda price. And a tip. for those of you watching your fat intake. I used ground turkey instead of beef. I also used plain low fat strained yogurt instead of sour cream and low calorie enchilada sauce. And it was amazing.

Fun and different!  My husband and I really enjoyed this meal.  He loved the amount of re-fried beans but I thought they were a little strong.  Other than that, it was great and tasty.

Just made this tonight. My wife and I loved it. Fits into the "comfort food" category. Used double tortillas which I lightly toasted in our toaster oven beforehand to keep them crispy.

This was good although I didn't find it to be spicy at all.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and substituted the jar taco sauce with Newmans Own farmers garden medium salsa.  Oh yeah, and I added some chili powder and cumin to the meat.

Great dish followed all instructions except only 1/2 chopped onion.  Made retried beans and layered them in one batch instead of mixing into the meat.  Doesn't change anything, just aesthetic.  Will definitely be using again soon!

I expected this to be just ok, but this was surprisingly tasty! It was not nearly spicy enough, so I added a significant amount of hot pepper spices from our farmer's market. In the future, I think I will leave the tortillas out and just serve this as a hot dip with tortilla chips.

Cooked as written by engineer husband who can't improvise... must follow instructions!  We only had one can of beans which turned  out to be a good problem.  Family LOVED it.  He cooked in a roasting pan, but next time I will double the tortillias and try in a round casserole.  We loved having left overs!  Fantastic recipe!

Great recipe. Super cheap and super easy on a Monday night. I make two pies with this recipe and freeze one for a later easy meal. I have before crumbled tortilla chips on top for the last 10mins of cooking time, adding a nice crunchy texture. Serve with corn and a side of sour cream. Mmm...

This is a great & easy recipe. Wonderful idea!  My preference is to drop the 2nd can of refried beans...just too much.  Next time would add more veggies to make it "lighter".

I wasn't sure if n 2 year old or 13 year old would like this but my 2 year old said it tasted like "Taco Bell" which is his favorite resturuant.  The only thing I would change is to use a spicer green chile.

This turned out very well and was hit with my family.  As suggested by other reviewers, I doubled up on the tortillas.  I also opted to spread the refried beans onto the tortillas then layered the meat mixture  and cheese.  Because I have a 4 year old and we're not accustomed to spicy foods, I omitted the extra  green chillies and did just the can of tomatoes with chillies in it.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  This will become a regular dish at our house!

Yum! This was a great addition to my recipe box. Only addition I made was to add taco seasoning to the meat (I used ground turkey). I really think it would have been fine without since it marinates in taco sauce for 30 minutes, but it was still good. I used a 3 qt casserole and a 1 3/4 qt casserole dish  - one to eat now, and one to freeze for later. This recipe makes A LOT, but easier to make the two dishes than cut down servings.

I just served this for dinner and it was a big hit.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and replaced the green chilis with chipote peppers in adobo sauce to compensate for the lighter flavor of the meat and it was great! The chiopoltes needed to be choppped up, but it was well worth the extra step. I also mashed a can of black beans and added them to the refried beans, smearing them on the tortillas as others suggested, but wonder if it would have held together better with the beans in the mix.  I used 1/2 the recipe for homemade taco seasoning found on ths site because I didn't have a packaged version on hand.  Next time I may just make the filling and use that in burritos.

Everybody loved this. I halved the recipe and it fit perfectly into a round 2 qt glass casserole dish.  I didn't have the small can of green chiles, so I just omitted them.  I also didn't have the taco sauce, so I substituted medium salsa.  Worked great.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion to spread the beans on the tortilla and then layer "beany side down" as opposed to mixing the beans in.  It worked very well.  I also used more cheese than called for because we love cheese :)  I did want to say, that per other reviewers, I used three tortillas per layer. It was a little too thick for my preference.  Next time I will only use two tortillas per layer and it should be perfect.  All in all a GREAT recipe that I will DEFINITELY make again :)

This recipe is great and very easy.  No measuring, just toss everything together in the skillet then layer it in a casserole dish.  The flavor and texture is perfect, although we more than doubled the cheese simply because my family loves cheese.  I will definitely make this again!

This was fantastic! I took some advice from someone else and doubled up on the tortillas between each layer. I also didn't add the chiles, but it still tasted great! I'm definitely making this again.

I actually used lasagna noodles, because I didnt have tortillas. This was good, plenty filling, but the flavor depended mainly on the type of taco sauce used, so ours was pretty mild (to please my 2 year old).

This was an instant hit in our dining room! I served the pie on a bed of shredded romaine lettuce and topped it with a dash of spicy taco sauce and a dollup of sour cream.....mmm...mmm good people!

this was wonderful!!! i did as suggested and doubled the tortilla layers which made it really sturdy to pull from the baking dish. I did the tortilla, beans, meat mix, cheese and etc. so it took a little longer but still came out great!

Not sure if I can really add much insight to this dish since over 2,000 people have all ready commented on it. However, my family and I thought it tasted very good. I thought it might be spicier than it was and I worried that my three year old might not eat it, but he ate his whole serving. This was a nice change of pace from having just regular tacos again. Thank you for this recipe, Kathimc!

Very good!  Even my kid liked it.  Used taco seasoning instead of taco sauce, added some sour cream, used jalapenos instead of green chilies, spread the beans on the tortillas and double layered so they wouldn't get soggy. Very filling meal.  Thanks.

This recipe is nice. The Pie turned out delicious. I added a lot of hot sauce and chili powder to spice it up. Plus, I added mushrooms. I have no idea why, but I assuming it's because I had them in the fridge. Also, no jalapenos? What is that all about? Well, to answer those questions, I simply added them. Great and simple recipe!

Delicious. Doubling up on the tortillas worked out well for us. Also, it filled 3 9" foil pie pans! Makes a ton! We froze two for later!

This is SO good and so easy.  It's a great recipe for freezing too, you can make several at once and freeze a couple.  I followed advice and put 3 tortillas between each layer and I spread refried beans on one of the layers.  I also used ground turkey to cut back on some of the calories and fat.  Delicious and very filling.  This makes a complete meal, add a salad and your done!

Really liked this recipe. I make enchiladas with the mexican rice (rice-a-roni) and add corn and black beans with it, so I thought I would try it in the "Pie"... it was very good. Just mix it in with the ground beef. nomnomnom

I made the 8 serving version and it was excellent!  I added a packet of taco seasoning (no water) and it really added an enhanced flavor.  I used mild taco sauce and this dish was not too hot at all.  I used Mexican cheese.  I did the refried beans separate, but next time I'll just mix it in with the meat for ease of spreading.  I put this in a 2 quart casserole using only 4 tortillas (I had no problems with sogginess).  I layered it 1/3 meat & beans then 2 tortillas....1/3 meat & beans with 1/2 cheese then 2 tortillas....topped with 1/3 meat & beans and remaining cheese.

Love, love, love this recipe! I made it with the homemade flour tortillas from this website and none of the layers were soggy as some readers have suggested. I too split the recipe and froze half of it in a disposable pie plate. Very delish and easy to make :)

GREAT RECIPE! I scaled it down a bit to suit a toddlers taste. Also added frozen mixed veggies. Substitued mild taco seasoning for taco sauce. This was a hit with the little one. I loved it!

Very good.  I didn't read the reviews before-hand and did not make any of the changes suggested.  I think doubling up the tortillas would just make it too "bready" instead of allowing for the flavor of the meat/bean mixture.  And I did mix everything together as instructed.  I do not like spreading layers like this and always think it's a hassle, so I wouldn't want to spread twice.  (I'm not sure I find the point in separating the beans.)  I scaled this down to only 1/4 the recipe and it was plenty for me for a couple of days, including taking it for lunch.  (It heats up in a microwave reasonably well.)  Not sure how you'd fit the entire recipe in any casserole.

Fantastic dish.  I made up all the filling so that I could freeze leftovers in smaller amounts.  With only 2 of us eating this I made it in a deep dish pie pan.  I made as written, minus the olives.  I froze two ziplock bags with the leftovers to make it 2 more times.  The taste and blend of the ingredients is spot on!  Thanks Kathimc for sharing this recipe.  By the number of reviews it has we're not the only ones who loved it!

Excellent for a crowd!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and used twice as many tortillas and used several per layer.  I also simmered the meat mixture for 30 minutes.  It is spicier than I thought it would be, even with mild taco sauce, but lettuce and sour cream on top helped to cool it down.

I did everything according to the recipe.  I finished my last layer and it looked delish.  THEN I saw the cans of refried beans on the counter -- the UNOPENED cans of refried beans!  Oops.  The greatest thing about it was that it still tasted fantastic!  I'll def. be making this again and will add the refried beans, ya know, IF I remember to. ;)

This was really good.  I did not add the entire bottle of taco sauce, jus about 1/4 of it.  I was worried that the whole bottle would make it too spicy for my little ones to eat.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I left out the olives because I didn't have time to read the reviews and I thought it turned out great!  I actually took it to my Mom and Dad's for supper and usually I don't get "excellent" reviews from them because I  am always trying new recipes, but they loved it!  My Mom even asked to keep a couple of pieces!  My husband also really liked it too!

Everyone asked me for the recipe!
I make this all the time- kids love it!

I sprinkle a tad bit of taco seasoning into the ground beef when browning and double up the tortillas which is a great idea. (Thanks allrecipes gals and guys) These are the only teeny changes I make. Sometimes I use refried beans sometimes drained chili beans- it depends on what I have around- either way- it's great. 
Thanks so much!

Excellent Recipe.  I only made the half the recipe because I only had 1 pound of ground beef, but next time I will probably make the whole recipe and freeze a pie.  I left out the tomatoes and added taco seasoning to the ground beef.  I also, as suggested, spread the refried beans along the bottom of the tortillas.  I was also out of olives, but will add next time.

This was really good. My daughters loved it! I did omit the extra can of green chilies since my daughters aren't into spicy foods. It is great, you can change the cheese you can spice it up or in my case mild it down to a kid friendly meal. I was very pleased with this dish. I didn't have a problem with it fitting in a 9x13 dish. It just kinda piled high.

This was so easy and flavors were awesome. I too spread the beans on the tortillas instead of mixing them in with the meat mixture. It was even tastier the next day!

This burrito pie is exceptional! I cut it in half since it's just my husband and I and the only thing I changed was using corn tortillas instead of flour and it was perfect! Just like Kathi said, be sure you like spicy because it's just that but, if you like spicy then this recipe is for you. I will definitly be making this one again! Thanks for posting!

This is yummy. I use flour instead of corn and haven't used taco sauce, but mix taco seasoning with the refried beans.

This has got to be one of the best dishes my husband has ever made me.  We did modify the ingredients slightly to make it VERY spicy because we love it that way (almost burn your mouth!).  I bought hot taco sauce, habanero/jalapeno refried beans, habanero spicy shredded cheese, super hot salsa, chipotle hot sauce, added 1 habanero pepper, and can of diced tomatoes with habaneros (seeing the hot theme here).  Basically anything I can substitute a spicier version of the item I did.  FYI - if you have a Mexican section in your grocery store, that's where you will find these items and they typically are cheaper.  We let the mixture simmer longer (40 minutes).  This could easily be made in the crockpot to slow cook the mixture then follow the directions to layer/bake afterwards. I can only imagine how delicious that would taste with all those spices simmer all day long.  I will try and let you know!

I reduced the meat by about 1/3 and only used one can of refried beans.  It fit perfectly in my springform pan. Family loved it.

Excellent! Halved the recipe. Used taco seasoning on the meat. Used 2 to 3 tortillas at each layer. Next time I'll use more cheese!

LOVVVEEDDD THIS!  I couldn't believe how good this came out.  It didn't make as much for us as it sounded like it made for others, and I added 1 tablespoon of taco seasoning (from this site) since the meat mixture was going to have to stand for all the flavor between tortillas and beans.  Whoever suggested doubling the tortillas is totally right on.  I also smeared the beans on as its own layer.

This was a great basic recipe.  I skipped the refried beans altogether and added a can of drained black beans to the meat mixture, added a package of taco seasoning as so many suggested, and used fresh jalapeno and serrano peppers instead of canned chiles.  I used a lot more cheese, too, but that's personal preference.  This was a really good and easy week night dinner that made great leftovers!

I gave this 5 stars simply because my entire family of 6 (age 11 months to 36 yrs) loved it and cleaned their plates.  The picky 10 yr old asked for seconds!  GASP!    I didn't add the olives but only because I don't like them.  I used spicy refried beans and didn't add them to the meat but instead did as others suggested and smeared it onto the tortilla as I layered them.  I used probably WAY more cheese than it called for.  4 cups of colby shredded and 2 cups of mexican shreaded.  We like cheese!  I browned meat and added 2 packs of taco season (one mild and one cheesy), drained, added tomato, green chili, and taco sauce (mild) and simmered for 15 mins.  Layered into dish, then layer of tortilla bean side down, and then smothered with shreaded cheese and repeated.  When serving while still hot I added a little more cheese for the kids.  I served with shredded lettuce, chunky tomato with habeneros for the husband and corn for the kiddos.

I made this for my family and they absolutely loved it! Definitely a home run. However, I did switch out the taco sauce for green taco sauce which upped it about 1 and a half stars. Since I'm not a fan of soggy tortillas, next time I think I'll crisp them on the stove first. Maybe I'll even use corn tortillas. Overall this dish is perfect for any family!

We make this quite often for breakfast by adding softly cooked eggs on top, refried black beans.  the eggs stay a little runny and add so much flavor. When it comes out of the oven add fresh tomatoes and chopped cilantro! We will try doubling the tortilla layers, good suggestion!

My kids LOVED this.  My five year old cleaned his plate and asked for seconds.  Very easy to make, I pre-made it and kept in in the fridge overnight, it warmed up very well the next day.  I didn't add olives since I didn't have any and my kiddos can be picky.

This is very good.  Didn't have any Colby cheese so I used some mexican cheese and cheddar.  I used taco seasoning, a can of diced tomatoes and a small can of green chilis for the meat misture.  As suggested by another user, I simmered the meat mixture for about 30 minutes.  Sour cream is a definite needed addition upon serving. :) Thanks for the recipe!  I'll definitely make it again.

One word.... Cumin!  where's the cumin?  I made this, forgot to buy the green chiles, so started looking for ways to spice it up.  Then realized... you can't have burritos without cumin.  Loaded it with chili powder, cumin and a little hot sauce and it was fantastic!!!!  I didn't try it with the chile peppers, but I'm sure that's good too.   I had to hide the leftovers from myself, or I would've eaten way more than my 5'0" frame should be eating.

I made this for a group of 6 (3 being guys w/very large appetites) and there was still PLENTY leftover.  It was really, really good though!  I omitted the diced tomatoes and olives because some people are not a fan and doubled the amount of cheese.  Also (and I think this is what knocked it out of the park), I added in crushed doritos between tortilla layers.  It added in a great flavor & also a crunchy texture.  Oh, I also opted to serve my onions raw on the side (as opposed to cooked into the meat), along with avocado, sour cream & green peppers.  YUM!!  Thank you for sharing!

Not a keeper for my husband and I. I made the most popular changes listed here - putting the beans on the tortilla, adding taco seasoning, etc. It was just really bland and rather mushy. We didn't care for it.

This is so delicious!  Followed the directions, no changes made with ingredients...But I did take the advice of others and spread the beans between two tortillas, pressed them together and then used each pair to layer.  Everyone loved it...even my toddlers!  SO YUMMY!!!

This was really good.  I put 4 tortillas in each layer and made it in a 9x13 dish.  I didn't put the beans in with the meat mixture but instead just spread them on top of the tortillas, then layered the meat and cheese.  I also added one packet of taco seasoning (without water) to the meat mixture.  Will be making again..thanks for sharing!

This recipe was a hit with my boyfriend.  I chose not to add the diced tomatoes to the recipe.  Next time I may try using a hot taco sauce instead of mild, to give it more flavor and hotness!!  

Update 3/9- made this again for my Bunco group.  I added a little extra taco sauce and a packet of taco seasoning this time and layered the tortillas 2 thick.  YUMMMMMMMY!!!

This was pretty good. I think that using Taco seasoning would make it much better. Also serve with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream

This was very good.  I added frozen corn and velveeta mexican cheese to the filing and used taco seasoning mix as others suggested.

I have made this a couple of times and have been disappointed in the results.  The texture once baked is very slimy in the middle.  It tastes like a glorified bean burrito from Taco Bell.  The ground beef is just lost in all the goop.  Not my cup of tea and my family defintely did not care for it.

I hate when people change the whole recipe... but I took others' advice and double-layered tortillas, used salsa instead of taco sauce and used taco seasoning to brown meat.  Husband and kids loved it!  It made a lot but leftovers heated well in microwave.  Could cut in 1/2 and just use 8x8 pan perfectly.  Also, kids don't like spicey and I accidentally used hot salsa and refried beans with jalapenos but I made the whole dish the night before for ease of use and it was not too hot and reheated well (not mushy) so a timesaver for me.  Definitely in the rotation!

My 18 year old daughter decided she needed to learn to cook, and she used this recipe for her first attempt at a family dinner.  It was absolutely fantastic.  She followed the recipe for the most part but did leave out the peppers.  The Rotel tomatoes with added chiles gave the flavor plenty of heat.  Great, great, great.  She's eager to make it again!

This was a really easy and delicious meal.  I followed the advice of others and spread the beans on the tortillas instead of mixing them with the meat.  To the beef, I added salsa instead of taco sauce and chopped jalepenos along with the taco seasonings and onions.  We can't get colby jack cheese here, so I used sharp cheddar and it was a great substitute.  A dollop of sour cream/creme fraiche and sliced avocados made the meal extra-great!

We enjoyed.  I used my cast iron skillet to layer the burrito pie and bake. I also made the re-fried beans using a can of pintos.  Heat small amt. of oil in skillet, add cumin and cayenne to taste, when hot, add can of beans with all liquids.  Mash with ricer and cook to proper consistancy.  Better and healthier than canned refried beans.  Also, I will try green salsa in place of taco sauce next time.

I'm in total agreement the al lthe other many that have reviewed this recipe - DELICIOUS!  My 7 year old and hubby couldn't stay out of it.  I made it with the following substitutes - ground turkey, fat free shredded cheddar cheese and I used salsa instead of the taco sauce (ChiChi's Thick & Chunky Medium).  A definite keeper!

I changed a couple things around but followed the basic rules of the recipe which I'm sure would be great without my changes.  I used 1lb of ground turkey in addition to the lb of ground beef, a verde taco sauce.  I like to sauté my onions until they are almost translucent and then add the meat.  Then I didn't add the cheese until the end and I put it on top.  Next time I will add more green chili's I really like the flavor.  Also spray the bottom of your pan place tortilla then put refried bean (98% fat free) then meat mixture and continued to top where I placed the cheese.  I was able to save calories and it was still just as delicious.

Next time I will cut this recipe in 1/2 unless you have a large family. I used refied beans with Jalapeno, this gave it a little zip. Otherwise I followed the recipe. I served this with lettuce and sour cream and the more black olive on top.

This turned out great! I made a few changes along the way. I halved the beef (used veggie beef crumbles),used 1 small onion, used about 1 tbsp of taco seasoning on the beef,  used half a bottle of taco sauce, used more than half of the lg. bottle of chunky salsa,used a ton more cheese (mexican and chihuahua cheese), used the whole can of mild chiles and less than half a can of the tomatoes. I kept the beans separate from the beef mixture. Instead of topping with beef and cheese, I topped with 3 tortillas and cheese. It was nice and crisp, giving the pie a good texture.

This was great!  I had to make lots of substitutions because I didn't have green chilis or olives, but it was delish anyway.  I can't wait to make it again, this time with all the proper ingredients.

OMG THIS IS SOOOOOOO GOOD.
I used 10 oz of enchilada sauce and 1 cup of chunky hot salsa in place of the taco sauce. I did not mix in the beans, I spread them on each tortilla. I split the recipe and did half in a decorative round pan and half in a disposable deep dish pie pan that I put in the freezer. Everyone loved it, especially with a salad on the side, a little salsa and sour cream on top!

This was way salty, but it is not the recipes fault...I made the recipe as stated, but followed the advice of other reviewers who reccommended the taco seasoning. Do not use taco seasoning...it is far too salty. There is several recipes on here that tell you how to mix your own spices for taco seasoning, and it allows you to have control over the season that you are adding. I would ammend the recipe as follows:

I believe this is best made in 2 deep pie pans as other reviewers have stated.

Double the tortilla's, it will hold up better.

Do not mix the ingrediants all into one big glob, spread the beans on the tortilla's as others have reccommended.

Spray pie pans, and use the tortilla as the bottom layer, it get's nice and crispy. 

Skip the taco sauce...slimeville. Serve it on the side. 

Cook the ground beef, onion, chili's and all the other spices to allow for flavor melding.

Wow!  I took the advice of others and added a few tweaks of my own and they definitely made this a 5 star recipe!  Here is what I did:
I doubled up the tortillas so the pie wouldn't get soggy.  I didn't add the beans to the meat mixture but put a layer of beans in between the tortillas. I added 2 T. taco seasoning to the meat mixture and let it simmer 30 minutes. Definitely need more cheese with this recipe (I used double.) I baked it for 3o minutes and broiled it on low at the end to make it brown on top. With these changes it is fabulous!!

This was a big hit with all my guys!  The recipe makes a huge amount but no one in my house seemed to mind.  The leftovers were devoured.  I did take the advice of using taco seasoning (no water) with the meat and spreading the refried beans on the tortillas and layering them 2-3 at a time.  I can see where it would just be a big gloppy mess otherwise.

This burrito pie is amazing. Substitute 2- 2 1/2 Quart casserole dishes. Bake one and freeze the other. My son kept going back for more until the first casserole dish was empty. Next day I baked the 2nd one and it was more of the same. Delicious!

This was really good!  I made it pretty much as written.  The only made two changes.  I cut it in half so it would fit in a 9-inch pie pan (which it still didn't.  And I made it with ground turkey.  Next time I will probably spice the meat a bit more as it turned out just a little bland for our taste.  Maybe a half package of taco seasoning...  Otherwise a really good recipe!  Thanks alot!

YUM!!!  So good!  I used a little less than 2lbs. of meat (1.65 I believe) and I was able to fit everything in one 9x13.  I also added a packet of taco seasoning and more cheese and for the beans I put half of them in the meat mixture and half I spread over the tortillas.  Other than that I pretty much followed the recipe as is.  Took it to a party and everyone loved it up.  Definitely a keeper.

Whoa! WAAYYY too much refried beans for our tastes.  I spread them on the tortillas as suggested and only ended up fitting 10 in the dish. USE MORE TORTILLAS as there was too much filling this way.  I have a chicken recipe similar to this and it instructs to cut the tortillas in fourths so they fit easier in the corners of the dish. I may do this again but with more cheese and 1/2 the beans.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used more taco seasoning and a little more meat, and lots more cheese. It turned out GREAT.  Wonderful flavor, filling and easy.  I would recommend this to anyone. EDIT 7/30/09 - this is still a household favorite in the winter months.  I normally add more tortillas now so they don't get too soggy while cooking.

AS others stated, it was too soggy and I made so may alterations, it was not the same dish.  I did however love what I came up with, so I gave it a 3, as it was an inspiration for my dish.

I really enjoyed this recipe it was really easy and turned out great.  I only had a pound of ground beef, so I added some brown rice to the beef and let it simmer with the other ingredients.  I also didn't add the beans to the mixture, but spread them on the tortillas. The last thing I did differently was I added sour cream right on top of the tortillas and then put the meat mixture over the top, it is amazing!

Yum! This was my second time making this and we really enjoyed it. I made it in my springform pan, which made for easy serving. I did use 3 tortillas per layer to make it a bit more sturdy. My husband really, really loved it. Thanks :)

Very easy and oh so good.  I make this all the time for my husband, and have passed the recipe on to many friends.  It's so easy to make and reheat.  Don't let the chile peppers scare you- it's not hot.  The flavors blend perfectly.  Will make again and again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy!! It's just me and my husband, so I halved the recipe. We still had enough for 2 nights. I used an 8x8 dish. I chopped 1/2 of a large yellow onion. Sauted it in butter. Added minced garlic. Added 1 lb ground beef.Add 1/2 pack of taco seasoning. When the meat was cooked I added 3/4 can of black olives(sliced),a whole 4oz can diced green chilies, 1/2 of an 8oz bottle of hot taco sauce(hubby doesn't do spicy)I then gave it 2 big squirts of the mild green taco sauce, 1/2 can of tomato sauce(I don't do diced tomatoes)and let simmer for 10 to 15 min. I heated up a can of refried beans. I then began layering. I sprayed the dish and put down 2 tortillas, then beef mixture, then grated cheddar (it's what I had)then following other suggestions I smeared the refried beans on a tortilla and place it bean side down added another tortilla and repeated the layer again. Then I added the last of the meat mixture and more cheese and the rest of the olives. I used approx. 12oz grated cheese and 6 tortillas total. I then baked for about 30 min at 350. This was the perfect amount for me and my hubby for dinner and leftovers.

I've been using this recipe for about a year.  My teenagers are crazy about this recipe.  They would want me to serve it at least once every week!  Easier way to eat Mexican flavored food than messy tacos.  Thanks so much for sharing this!

This is a big hit at my house.  I've made it too many times to count.  I have tweaked it here and there.  Actually made just yesterday and mixed Chorizo in with the beef and my husband and teen son loved it.  Of course the meat lovers that they are.  I also use spicy everything.  We like it hot.  What is great is that you can make any degree you like and it is still great.  I do agree with the skillet size.  The first time I couldn't fit in pan, but now 1/2 it to make a perfect 9x13 pan.

*A regularly rotated dish!  I've found that it's better if you do use 2 lbs of ground beef, one pkg of Taco Seasoning (I use Lawry's), TWO 7 oz cans of Embasa's Salsa Mexicana (instead of taco sauce), a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with chiles, extra onion, less than 2 oz of black olives, and I chop up a few jalapeno's for some heat.  We don't like beans, so we don't add them. And, GOBS of cheese - generally, we use the Mexican Four Cheese blend.  Also, I rip up the tortillas to fit into the 9X13 pan.  AWESOME!  Everyone who I've made it for LOVES it.

Wonderful! We have this often and the only variation I've tried is using corn tortillas instead of flour from time to time. Both are great! Everytime I make this my husband has seconds or thirds! Thanks for a new regular!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  It is really flavorful.  I followed the recommendations of the others and didn't mix the beans with the meat.  I cooked the meat with seasoning 5 min, added the garlic and onion and cooked for another 5 min, added can of tomatoes, green chiles, and taco sauce.  In my opinion, you shouldn't drain the tomatoes b/c there isn't enough liquid to simmer.  Then I layered meat, cheese, bean covered tortilla (bean side down) like the others.  IMPORTANT: I think the amounts have been changed from the original recipe b/c there is NO WAY this is as big as others have rated it.  I layered all the meat, etc. with 6 tortillas and it all fit into a 2 1/2 quart deep baking dish (corningware).  Just thought I'd let everyone know that before you cut it in half and don't have enough to feed everyone!

I took this to a Potluck at work and it was well received by everyone and I got many complements.  I personally thought it was excellent and will be making it again for family and guests.  I think there is little that you can do to improve it except to have maybe sour cream and guacamole on the side.  Thank you for a fantastic recipe Kathi!

Made this tonight and let me quote what my hubby said..."I'm lovin this"  The only changes I made were omitted the olives (dont like them), used taco seasoning instead of salsa, and did not mix the refried beans w/ the meat, I layered separately.  I couldn't decide if I wanted to use flour tortillas or corn tortillas, hubby a fan of corn and flour for me, so I used a huge casserole dish and on one half I used flour and the other half I used corn.  I sprinkled cheddar cheese all over the whole thing and baked.  Yummy!  I did pre fry both kinds of tortillas prior to layering them.  Will most definately make again.

This recipe did not do much for us.

This was great!  I was a little hesitant to put in an extra can of chilies, but I am SO glad that I did.  We had bought mild taco sauce and also bought a can of diced tomatoes, lime juice, cilantro and chilies.  It added a nice little kick.  I think that if I omitted the extra chilies, it would have been a little *too* mild.

This recipe was a hit at my house!  My husband made it, and it turned out perfect.  Thanks!!

Yuck! I agree with the previous reviewer that called this mush. It looked horrible and tasted bland. I ate a few bites and trashed the rest. Would not make this again. I gave it the second star due to the ease of the recipe.

Great recipe!  Like some others, I added a packet of taco seasoning to the mixture plus other spices, and I only used 6 tortillas.  I spread the beans on the tortillas rather than mix them in the meat.  Also used two bags of cheese and everyone loved it.  Will definitely make again. Put this together Thursday night and after work on Friday sipped margaritas as it baked.  Perfect!

This recipe was really good and easy.  I used thin strips of chicken, instead of beef, seasoned in garlic powder and Tabasco.  I also used 1 can of refried beans instead of 2 and rotel with cilantro and lime juice.  Thanks for the recipe.

My family really enjoyed this, they all had 2 helpings. I thought it would be a bit spicier with the Rotel tomato/peppers, green chili's and the Pace "medium" taco sauce, but it wasn't at all. My guys topped theirs with sour cream, but said it was great either way. It made a huge pan, would feed a lot of people. It was simple to make. I didn't care for it much, it was okay as far as my tastes...maybe I expected too much with all the reviews and high star rating. I would give it a 3 because it wasn't bad, it really was okay, but my gang liked it well enough for 4.5 stars. I did double the cheese as one 8 oz. package only covered the first couple of layers. It didn't say exactly if the flour tortillas overlapped, or if you had to cut them to fit the gaps, I overlapped mine and used 18 (3 layers of 6). It was worth preparing and my gang wants it again sometime. I, however, was not impressed.

I made a smaller version of this by using 1 lb of ground turkey and only 1 can of refried beans.  I also put it in 2 regular Pyrex pie pans and froze one for later.  This was really good--does indeed taste just like a burrito.

This was a real hit with adults and children. Followed suggestions of others by adding taco seasoning to browning meat, using medium taco sauce and skipping the canned green chili, using one pack of large tortilla shells, and cooking in a greased 9x13. This would be a great dish for a pot luck.

A huge hit!  There is a reason why so many have given this 5 stars.  My family couldn't get enough of it (including my two-year-old).  I also followed the advice of others and tweaked it a little. 1) I used taco seasoning with the ground beef 2) I left out the black olives 3) I used so much more cheese - 2 full packages of shredded cheese 4) I didn't use a can of green chiles and instead used 2 cans of Rotel 5) I doubled the tortillas and put the refried beans on the tortillas 6) I served it on lettuce with sour cream and our favorite salsa on the side.  I don't understand any of the bad reviews of it tasting bland or being horribly mushy looking.  It was packed full of flavor and looked really good.  As my husband said at the end of dinner, "this recipe is definitely a keeper."

This was fabulous.  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers ad added taco seasoning to the meat.  I also doubled up on the tortilla layers, but next time I won't.  It was not necessary.  I will definitely make this again!

I won't make this again. It was just a pile of mush.  Since everything pretty much gets stirred together except for the cheese and tortillas it looks very unappealing.  Very bland flavor. My three kids did not care for this either.

LOVED it! With chunky refried beans for added texture, canned tomatoes with green chilies AND jalepenos and about 1/8th cup of fresh, chopped cilantro we garnished our plates to taste with lettuce, garden-grown chopped tomatoes, guacamole, fresh sliced avocado and sour creme. Delish!!! Thanks for sharing!

Throwing this Mexican Lasagna together, it didn't look all that great, but when it was time to serve, it was delicious!  I would say it's even better the 2nd day.  The only thing I would recommend is having some sour cream handy to throw on top when it's time to chow down!

My mom used to make something like this when I was a kid. I went with some of the other reviews advice and doubled the tortillas and spread the beans insted of mixing with the meat mixture.I also added taco seasoning to the meat mixture in addition to the taco sauce.Turned out great!

This was awesome, my husband loved it.  I have never used refried beans before, but everything turned out amazing.  I used regular salsa in place of taco sauce.  I also used an oval shaped casserole dish and found that the tortillas fit well if you cut them in half and then placed the rounded ends in the end of the dish.

I loved it... although, i didnt pay attention that the recipe was for 16  servings, and that it was so filling.  I actually ate 6 servings by myself the first night (fortunately, I used the refried beans with no fat), and enjoyed it for the next few nights.  It still tasted great after 4 days!

We loved this!  It REALLY makes a lot.  I used 1 lb. of ground round and 1 lb. of ground turkey as that's what I had on hand.  Also, because we love the taste of chipotle peppers, I shook some drops on each meat layer as I assembled it.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing.  Thanks for sharing!

LOVED it!  Made it with a few changes but as most everybody is finding out you can't really hurt this recipe!  I didn't have refried beans so I mashed black beans and left them a little lumpy for some texture, loved the chili peppers, this is a definate "keeper".

My family raved about this! I've been requested to make this instead of "regular" tacos from now on! I did make two changes... first, I used two cans of black beans instead of refried beans because I didn't think the look of refried beans mixed with the meat would be appetizing. Second, I only used 8 oz. of taco sauce but only because I didn't read the recipe thoroughly enough and it was all I had in the house. It came out perfect so I don't know if I would use 16 oz next time... might make it too soupy..?  Anyway, I give it 5 stars and I will definitely be making it again!

I thought it was quite tasty, and my husband loved it.  Very easy, lots of flavor, and would make it again.  Based on other reviews, I used only 1 lb. ground beef, 1 can of refried beans (though next time might add 1 can black beans), and kept everything else.  It fit perfectly in a 9x13 baking dish, with two tortillas per layer.

I made this dish last night, I cut it in half. I actually prepped in the morning and left it in the refrigerator covered so when its time for dinner I can pop it in the oven. It was fast and easy. Although the outcome looks a little gloppy. It tastes very good in fact I am going home for lunch today to eat the left overs.

I am rating this with 5 stars cuz my husband & my son said I had to. I ended up using too large of a baking dish so I didn't have enough layers and I forgot to add the taco sauce. Even with that this still turned out excellent. I added some cumin to the meat & we added our own taco sauce at the end. I halved the recipe and then my husband seemed to be upset when he saw that there was only a little left over. As far as someone saying the tortillas are soggy, well that's true. Every casserole type recipe I have ever made with tortillas in them have always comme out soggy. I like them soggy. My 8 yr old said that the meat filling would be great in tortilla fried like a chimichanga. We will definatly keep this recipe and make it again.

This tasted really amazing, but I only gave it four stars because it really is quite the mess.  I made it last night and had leftovers today, and it kind of spread out all over the plate and into a big blob while in the microwave.  Still tasted excellent though!

This is truly one of my husband's favorite meals, though my 6-year-old taco pizza lover won't touch it.  I love it too, but gave it only 4 stars for 2 reasons: (1) It is messy to serve, never neatly coming out of any of the numerous dished I've tried; and (2)The tortillas turn to a mushy, nondescript mess when reheated, so if I make too much, I usually have to pitch the leftovers.  That being said, I'll still make it because hubby loves it and I like it too!

This was a great recipe!!  Very good!  I decided to only use the can of tomatoes with the chilies and eliminate the extra can.  My husband and my mom ate this and my husband was sweating because it packs a little heat.  They both said it was very good!  I thought it was very easy to make.  I used chopped olives. 
We'll definitely make again.  Perfect for potlucks, too!  Stayed together nicely.

Me and my fiance loved it.  I made it the second time with ground sirloin, fat free refried beans, and fat free cheese to make it a little healthier.  He couldn't even tell the difference.

Basically this is a flattened burrito cassarole. Tastes good and you can add ingredients to your liking. Left overs are good warmed up in the microwave or oven. Yum!

Honestly, my husband and I were not too pleased with this recipe.  I followed the ingredient list exactly.  For us, it was way too many refried beans and too little cheese.  Unfortunately, I cooked the recipe in two dishes and froze one... However, we're not really looking forward to round two of burrito pie.

Loved this!  Be sure to cook everything up in a Dutch oven...it makes enough to feed a small army!  I like Mexican dishes extra spicy, so I used a can of tomatoes with jalepano peppers and HOT picante sauce.

I made this last week. I thought it was very good. I cut the recipe down a little,  only used about a pound of ground beef and one can of refried beans.  It turned out great!

This was awesome.  I added taco seasoning to the meat and some cayenne pepper cause I like spicy food.  Topped it off with a little sour cream.  Great recipe, I loved it.

I followed the directions and used the same ingredients.  I made just two big layers instead of several, and I put a big dollup of sour cream on top when ready to serve.   This was SOOOO good and tasty!!!!  My hubby kept telling me what a great cook I am LoL!

This was very easy to convert to a vegetarian dish by using meat crumbles and vegetarian refried beans. I didn't think it was that hot. Next time I'll kick it up with fresh jalepenos.

This was a great recipe!  My husband is kind of picky, but he loved this!  I halved the recipe, and it still filled a 2 quart glass dish.  I served it with tortilla chips on the side for some added texture.  I used reduced fat cheddar cheese, fat free refried beans, and added some homegrown jalepeno peppers.  We will be having this again!  Thanks!

This is a pretty good recipe with some modifications and a combination of other users’ suggestions.  It’s like Mexican lasagna.  Halve the recipe for a standard 9X11 pan. I used salsa for texture, not taco sauce. I used one regular sized can refried beans and one black beans - again for texture or it’s a mushy mess. I used regular tortillas but overlapped a lot (if not - it’s a mushy mess). I did not mix in the beans with the meat, but I instead spread the beans on the tortillas, laid them face down on the pan, and then added the meat on top. Nothing fancy or amazing about this one. A quick and easy dish for a group.

My husband and guests LOVED this recipe and it was pretty simple to make too :) I did subsitute some of the items for things I thought would make it a bit better tasting. I'm from the South where we like it zesty & spicy :) I took out the olives, used Taco seasoning instead of taco sauce, used one can regular refried beans and another of Chipotle refriend beans (spicy beans), and fresh homemade tortillas. It turned out awesome. When I was making it my husband was kind of judgemental, but he was apologizing afterwards! Enjoy!!

Quick and easy! I only used 1 can of refried beans and 1 pound of beef. I used shredded cheddar instead of colby. I placed in a 9x13 and only had 2 layers of tortilla's. I used tomatoes without the chile's. I was so afraid that this would be spicy but it wasn't at all and I could have gone full strength. This turned out great! I placed foil over top the last 10 minutes in the oven to keep the cheese from hardening. This is a fabulous dish that isn't fancy but is very great family fare.

Just got the Allrecipes Cookbook w/this recipe in it.  WONDERFUL!!!  Very easy to make because with a conventional lasagna you have to boil the noodles instead you use tortillas.  I want to try using tortillas in making a conventional lasagna too. I ommitted the chillies, olives, and tomatoes w/chillies and just used 14.5oz. of stewed tomatoes w/garlic.  That's what I had in the house.  It turned out great.  My family doesn't care for spicy/hot food so ommitting the chillies didn't make a difference in the taste to us.  If you like mexican, you'll love this guaranteed!!

This was real good.  I used corn tortillas as that is what I had in the frig and toasted them along with the recommendations for enchilda sauce instead of taco sauce.  It turned out like a mexican lasanga.

This filling is very good, you may use it for many other dishes also. First time I used a 9" rd cake pan.  Now I take the 9 inch springform pan.  It is very convenient.  Let it cool a short time open pan and slice a wedge.  I top with lettuce and sour cream.  A great leftover also!

I didn't make a full batch of this (it's just me and my husband). I used 1lb beef, cut out the can of chilies, 1/2 of the taco sauce, and 1 can of beans. I did, however, use more cheese. I added some chili pepper, cumin, and hot sauce to the meat. Like some other reviewers suggested, I did not put the beans in with the meat mixture. I spread the beans on the tortillas and layered that way. This turned out great. We loved it.

A 4 star rating means that I will make it again, but it's not a "WOw" dish.  I cut back on the beans and the peppers because my family doesn't love them.  Other than that, you could tweek it any way your family likes.  (I usually double all my recipies, but I didn't double this one; no need to unless you want to freeze one.  for other doubling recipe ideas, check my other reviews

I fully intended on preparing this recipe as instructed but we just couldnt wait to eat. Too hungry. So after the mixture simmered 15 mins. we just put it right into the flour tortillas and covered with cheese and had some totally awesome burritos. It was a great dinner. There is still some beef mixture left so we'll have burritos tomorrow too probably. I would like to try this recipe again and this time prepare to completion. I bet the casserole is really good.

I enjoyed this but I thought that it needed more tortillas so I made it again and layered it useing twice as many tortillas--much better!! I also used a deeper dish to bake it in. This makes a great presintation with shredded lettuce and chopped tomatoes.

I made this the first time and halved the recipe per other reviewer's suggestions.  It made approximately one 13 x 9 pan and was quite enough for a meal.  However, I had half a can of each ingredient leftover as they don't come any smaller.  The next time I made two 13 x 9 pans with very little extra effort and froze the second one in individual portions for reheating later.  This is a big hit with my husband and daughter - highly recommended.

A HUGE hit at home!  Very yummy. I agree that taco seasoning in the mix and little sour cream on the side make it better.  I also made thicker layers than described.

Really yummy!  I tweaked it a bit, however, mostly following suggestions from other viewers.  I did the following:  Added an envelope of taco seasoning to the meat mixture (no water though), omitted the green chilis and black olives, added a small can of corn, spread the beans on the tortillas and used corn instead of flour tortillas.  The recipe is VERY hearty and extremely yummy.  It was a hit at my house!

Was expecting alot more from this recipe with all the great reviews.  Thought it was pretty bland and boring!  Not terrible, but it certainly didn't live up to all the hype in my opinion.

I skipped the green chiles, only used 1 can of refried beans and just added a packet of taco seasoning....it came out great!  I also couldn't find a 4 qt. casserole dish so I made do w/a 9x13 pan.  It came out just as good I had to cut the tortillas in half to cover the entire layer though.  Great mexican recipe!

One of our all time mexican favorites!  Sometimes I add a can of black beans (drained) instead of one of the cans of refried beans.  Mmmmmmmm!

This was pretty easy to throw together and the taste was good.  I did omit the black olives (don't like them) and the can of green chiles (didn't want them to overpower the flavor).  Also, after I started cooking I realized I only had an 8 oz. jar of taco sauce but it worked out fine.  I used quite a bit more cheese than this called for, and substituted cheddar and monterey jack which is what I had on hand. Tasty and filling, especially good with a dollop of sour cream!

This was a great dish! I used one reviewer's suggestion and used pie pans. Then, I put them in gallon ziplock bags and placed them in the freezer.  The only problem I had was that my husband and I fought over the last slice! Next, time I'll try and bigger pan so we will have leftovers.  Also, I spread the refried beans on the tortillas as suggested by a previous reviewer. I'll be making this one over and over again!!! Thanks for sharing!!!

My husband loved this!!  He took it to work, ate leftovers for dinner and raved about it in general.  He calls it "Mexican Lasagne".  Instead of using refried beans (I usually make my own) I was lazy and just dumped in one can of whole pinto beans.  Turned out great.  It was even better the second day served with sour cream and salsa on top.  Will add to the regular rotation.  Thanks Kathi!!!

The whole family enjoyed this dish. I substituted  jarred salsa + a sm. can of tomato sauce for the taco sauce and used a combo of Colby and Monterey Jack cheeses. It came out great. I served it over chopped lettuce with a dollop of hot salsa on top. A winner!

Can't get enough of this dish. I made one addition. I pour a can of green chile sauce over the top, before the last layer of cheese to make it a little more juicy.

We really enjoyed this.  I followed the advice of others and used corn tortillas.  I also added some chipotle pepper to the mix and it gave the dish another kick.  It made a ton, and I think the leftovers will be even better after it has a chance to blend in.  Yum!

Yum Yum Yum!!!  This was quick and easy to make.  I omitted the chiles and added very little onion and extra black olives so my 3 yr old would eat this.  I used the chiles, lettuce, sour cream and guacamole for garnishes and served with Spanish rice and tortilla chips.

I had a feeling that this would be a hit in my house when I first saw the recipe. I love making Mexican dishes and this was just the update I needed for my same old recipes. I expected it to be a bit messy but it wasn't at all, sliced easily and served beautifully.

OH MY GOODNESS!!!  This was HORRIBLE!!!  Maybe I was expecting too much being that I am hispanic and know what hispanic food is suppose to taste like!  "Normally" there is alot of wonderful flavors that flow through our dish.  This is not an original hispanic type dish, so do not expect that when you cook it!

This recipe was good but I knew it wouldn't be spicy since green chilies were the only thing that resembled anything spicy and they don't have a lot of flavor.  I made the meat sauce per directions and then tasted.  I added about a TBS more minced garlic, garlic powder, onion powder and chipotle pepper powder.  It was then acceptable to all tastes -- those that liked spicy foods and those that didn't.  Without the add-ins the sauce was VERY bland.

My only problem with this recipe is that, after reading the other reviews, I decided I would probably add some taco seasoning.  So when the recipe was as it was, it really lacked something, and, as I added the taco seasoning bit by bit, it started to bite back a little (a good thing), but it still needed something.  The way it worked out, it ended up being a little too spicy for my taste, but I liked it and my family loved it.

This recipe was simply quick and delicious.  Being we are only a 2 family home,
I reduced the recipe size in 1/2 and we still have left overs to enjoy.  The only
thing I did different was to add a can of beans with the chile's already in them..ie
giving the beans a little more heat.  I could not ask for a better recipe on a cold
night...thanks.

Good mexican casserole.  Use 9x13 pan.  Buy pre-shredded cheese to speed up.  Could add corn or black beans.  Easy and quick

This turned out pretty good, but it's not a recipe that looks very appetizing.  I changed a few things: I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, and I used a black bean & corn salsa instead of the taco sauce.  When I served it, we topped it with light sour cream.  This was very easy to make.

The man loved it-- even sought out and then consumed all the leftovers, which he never does!! I halved the recipe & added fajita seasoning for more mexican flavor. Very good with sour cream and tabasco chipotle sauce! Would like to try with corn tortillas instead of flour.

With all the great reviews I must have down something wrong, it was OK, I did make 2 casseroles and froze one, maybe it will be better. my husband thought it was pretty spicy, I love spicy food and thought the flavor was good, but maybe I layered the tortillas incorrectly they just were musshy, maybe someone can clarify Do u use 1 layer or layer several shells together?? Maybe I did not use enough tortillas??

This is a new family favorite!  I've made it several times now and its very easy to make and doesn't take a very long time.

We found it easier to use the large flour tortillas 4 1/2 of them.  If you tear some in half, you can use one, and then one half to make a perfect layer.

I serve it with a salad for a complete meal.  Oh, and I find it makes about 12 servings, not 16.

For those of you on weight watchers, at 12 servings, it's 11 points per serving.

This turned out good, I did add taco seasoning to it to add flavor.  Although it was easier than tacos, I would prefer to use this as a dip type of thing as well.  Thanks Kathi!

Great recipe!  Very tasty, quick and easy preparation.  I altered it a bit though.. I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I used a regular ground turkey and a Mexican flavored ground turkey, both made by "The Turkey Store".  I used fat free tortillas also, all to lower the fat content.  It tasted great, and I think the Mexican spiced turkey complimented the dish VERY well! My whole family loved it.  I will make it again. Thanks for sharing it~

Easy and excellent!  I did some layers with corn tortillas and some with flour tortillas.  This added a nice flavor.  A real keeper!!

My family loved this recipe and it is so easy.  One problem to be aware of.....  Since the first time I made it I have had to make at least once a week.  One week even twice.

I made this with homemade fresh tortillas & this was a huge hit at my house. I served it with extra tortillas to scoop it up. My 1yo ate 2 bowls of it and my hubby proclaimed it "a keeper". I cut the recipe in half (except for the peppers) and put it in a 9x9x2 baking dish.

I made this dish vegan... using some whole kidney beans seasoned with salt, pepper and cumin instead of meat.  I reduced the refried beans to only one can, and used soy cheese instead of colby.  It turned out really well, though next time I will be adding jalepenos as found that it wasn't spicy enough for my boyfriend and I.  Overall, a great recipe that was easy to adapt to vegan.

We thought this was excellent. I used one can of blackbeans and one can of refried beans. I also used Rotel milder tomatoes and green chiles, along with mild taco sauce. It was really good and I'll make this again and again. Just the right spice.

Wow! What a great meal! We omitted the can of tomatoes and chiles and used diced tomatoes instead to tone down the heat. Everyone here loved it! Great job!

Tastes just like a burrito without the hassle of putting one together.  Makes a lot!! Very good flavor. I did add some taco seasoning to the ground beef for a little extra flavor.

This was GREAT!  Since it was only my husband and I eating it, I halved the ingredients, keeping the whole can of tomatoes with chilis, only putting 1/2 can of the beans and saved the diced green chilis for the top of my husband's half of the pie.  I also put more cheese in it than was called for.  We put shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes and sour cream on the top.  My husband had enough left over to take to lunch the next day!  Will definitly make this again!  Thanks!

I too would recommend a package of taco mix.  The flavor was still there without it if you prefer a more hamburger taste.

One of the best meals I've ever made and I will definitely make it again.  Even my 14 month old daughter loved it!  I used one pound lean hambuger meat, about 1/2 onion, 8 oz. mild taco sauce, one clove garlic, 4 oz. diced green chili peppers, 4 oz. black olives, about 7 oz. diced red tomatoes with green chilies, 1 can low fat refried beans, 4 flour tortillas, and 2 cups of cheese and I baked it in a square baking dish.

My 2 8 year old boys liked it.  I loved it.  I prepped and refrigeratored it a couple nights before.  Come home, heated oven, put it in, and a quick 20 mins. later, YUM!  oh, BTW, I used sharp cheddar, leftover  refried beans, garlic, and beef -- no onions, etc.  My kids' palates aren't that sophisticated yet!

Used a package of taco seasoning, no onions or garlic or green chile. Spread the refried beans on each tortilla, followed by meat and then cheese. Heated the tortillas shells in a skillet on each side to crisp and used 2 tortillas per  layer. Very easy recipe to adjust to your personal preference. Cut recipe in half.

After reading other reviews I decided to try spreading the beans on the tortillas instead of adding to the meat mixture, great decision! It was very delicious! Will definitely make again!

This is a very versatile recipe. I decided to make my pie in two separate cake pans to suit my families different tastes. I made one with seasoned black beans and one with seasoned pinto beans. They were both a hit. I made my own taco seasoning and used salsa instead of taco sauce. I didn't want this to turn out soggy so I drained the beans and the tomatoes. I doubled the tortillas for each layer, as suggested by other reviewers. I did not have any issues at all with this turning out soggy or the tortillas dissolving.  Fantastic and easy way to have delicious burritos!

This was alright. I made it as written and thought it tasted fine, but I found the tortillas to be unpleasantly mushy and it was a bit soupy in general.  I may or may not make this again.  Thank you for posting the recipe.

Perfect. Easy to make followed the recipe just added some more salt, crushed garlic and onion powder. Only thing is the tortillas got soggy a little bit. So double layer them.

Made this for book club last night.  Very tasty, very filling. Only changes I made were using ground turkey, and green taco sauce.  I read a review that suggested 2 layers of tortillas which I did, but I feel that made it too heavy, especially next day when they had soaked up all the moisture in the leftovers.  The mixture turned out great tho, and in general a great dish. I used the olives as a garnish along with avocado and diced tomatoes.

To make it vegetarian, use a 16 ounce can of refrained beans instead of the meat.

Great, easy gluten free recipe if you use corn shells instead of flour. My 17 year old daughter loves this as does my hubby. For me, a teeny tiny bit too spicy but it doesn't stop me from eating it.  From others suggestions, I cut it in half & used a taco seasoning packet instead of onion and garlic. The first time I used one layer of corn soft shells but the second time I did a double layer. I prefer the double layer. My family said it didn't matter to them. I am not a cook so mine doesn't look like the picture. LOL

Instead of starting with meat mixture on the bottom, I put in a layer on tortillas to make serving easier. Plus I added about a 1/2 cup of frozen corn! It was a smash hit! This is a definite menu item!

The flavor was very good, but a few issues...  First, I only used 7 tortillas (?), as I layered it like I would lasagna, and ran out of toppings and pan before I got near 12 tortillas! I guess I needed clearer direction. Second, I ran out of pan - this meal was huge! I could have cut it in half or made it in two pans and frozen one if I had known.  Third, it was missing a crunch... Maybe add raw onions as another layer throughout?  Or top with tortilla strips?  Something needed a new texture, or it was overall too consistently mushy.

Nice but bland and very fatty.
I changed the recipe by adding 1 teaspoon each of cumin and red chili pepper to the meat.
I also switched out the ground beef for gound turkey and used low fat cheddar, also used low fat refried beans, no one noticed and it still had great flavor.

Great recipe! It was cheap to make and my whole family loved it. My boyfriend usually doesn't like refried beans, but he still had seconds and thirds. I used four large flour tortillas in total.

Delish!  Have made it several times, sometimes I halve it and use a deep dish pie plate.  Add shredded lettuce and sour cream.  Most of the time I use ground turkey...so good!  Don't be fussy about the amount of tortillas you use.  I always have some left over, and no one would know any difference.  Thanks to the person that shared!  :-)

Awesome!  Just Awesome.  However, a few tweaks just like everyone else.  I don't like the fat content in refried beans so I used two cans of rinsed pinto beans dropped in the food processor with a little oil, some Garlic Pepper seasoning and a couple spoonfuls of the Tomatoes with Chilis.  I used taco sized corn tortillas just because I like the way they bake into dishes like this. I also agree with one of the other reviewers that more cheese is better.  I used a 24 oz. mix of 4 Cheese Mexican and Taco blend. Hey, we're from Wisconsin.  Start with the largest fry pan you have and it will still be full once everything is in it. I didn't have green chilis so I used a few pickled jalapenos finely diced.  Simmer the meat-bean-olive-tomato mix for at least 20 mins, and PLEASE, taste it before you assemble it.   Make sure the flavor is right before you build this. I used a 9x15 foil pan and it made three layers with 6 corn tortillas overlapped on each layer.    Tent it with foil for the first 30 min then remove it and let the top cheese get a bit brown.  Did I say Awesome?  This is a keeper and a great take and bake meal.

I made exactly as written, except for reducing the amount of meat to just one pound (per the advice of another cook) and used a 12 oz bottle of taco sauce instead of 16. Had I used 2 lbs of meat, then it would have been WAY too much! I kept the amount of all the other ingredients the same. My family likes things a bit spicy, so I used hot green chili peppers, refried beans with jalapeno, and a medium spicy taco sauce. However, you'll definitely need to up the amount of cheese. I used two 2-cup bags, which worked out just fine. Family would like to eat it again!

when my teenage daughter started bringing her friends over after football games and they brought their football player boyfriends, I had to figure out how to feed a lot of hungry people on the cheap and this recipe is definitely one of the favorites. I took it to a family gathering and they all loved it too so it is now something we all have on our regular meal rotations. as far as the soggy tortilla thing goes, I have found if you use cheapo tortillas and double it up rather than one of the thick and fluffy mission ones, you won't get the mush in the middle. I also season my meat with a package of taco seasoning and that adds a ton of flavor.

A good hearty meal that will feed a whole army! I halved the recipe and still had lots of leftovers. I didn't any chili's because I don't like the heat,  and used powered taco seasoning instead of liquid since I had it on hand.  I also didn't add the refried  beans to the beef-tomato mixture because it seemed so thick already,  instead I spread them on the tortillas like another reviewer suggested. I also put a layer of guacamole and sour cream over the top. It was a hit!  Will definitely be making again.

BIG WINNER! The kids & the husband loved this dish. I made this once so far & I used some of the suggestions right off the bat...I used 2 tortillas (not 1) for each layer & spread the refried beans on top of the tortilla (instead of adding to the beef mixture) before starting the next next layer to avoid sogginess. I made 2 pie plates but definitely ran short on the meat mixture for the 2nd plate. Next time I would go a little lighter with the meat while layering to avoid falling short again. Will certainly add this to my recycled recipe list for sure! It's awesome the next day too...not soggy!

This was delicious and easy. Followed a couple of suggestions to lay the tortillas 2 at a time and also used taco seasoning. Made it Friday night and ate off it all weekend, which usually gets a "again" from husband by Sunday. But he was actually upset when there was nothing left for him to take for lunch on Monday.

I made this tonite and I found it to be a little heavy and the tortillas got soggy. I do like the flavor. Would make a great dip or a burrito.will try this again but layer more of the tortillas , instead of a single layer I will double it together. But other wise a good dish cj from Yosemite national forest

The only changes I made were to add taco seasoning to the meat mixture and used Rotel tomatoes. I had some mixture left over so I made a regular burrito and it was awesome. Goodbye Taco Bell.

The recipe was good, and easy to follow, which I did, very closely.  I made half of the recipe, for just the two of us.  My main personal objection is that it is so RICH ! I couldn't eat any more than one serving.  I didn't add any sour cream or salsa, etc., for that would have made it even richer.

I'm a huge fan of Mexican food and although it had all the right flavors, it wasn't spicy whatsoever. I tasted the meat mixture while it was simmering and had to add habanero hot sauce to give it some spice. Turned out okay. Next time I make it I'm going to dice up some habanero peppers and toss it into the mix.

This was pretty good. I tweaked the process a bit however. I have trouble swallowing so when meat is overcooked I pretty much can't eat it. It's alot easier to overcook meat than ppl would think. With the directions you're cooking the ground beef to death. Cook the onions and garlic when you start cooking the ground beef and when they're is just a tiny amount of pink in the meat add the mixture then simmer. I only  did it until it looked like it was about to boil, then a little over 5 mins after that. It continues to cook taken off the burner and in the oven. It came out really good. I'll prolly still fool around with the time on the meat, but that's the only thing. Other than that I changed nothing.

By substituting corn tortillas for the flour ones, this becomes a great gluten-free meal!

Made 1/2 the recipe as directed in a 2 1/2 quart round dish which was the perfect size for the tortillas! I used 6 tortillas and made 6 layers. It came out perfect and was not runny or soggy as other reviewers suggested. Will make again, but will add some taco seasonings to the meat mixture. Family liked it and we voted to keep it in the make again file :)

This recipe was great.  My family loved it. I used taco seasoning and increased the diced tomatoes in place of the taco sauce that I did not have on hand.  I cut it in half since it makes so much and I only had 3 people to feed and I still had leftovers.

Excellent! Even my husband who doesn't normally eat Mexican food gave it rave reviews and asked for seconds. I didn't have green chili peppers and I only used one can of beans, but it was just right for us. And I also added a little chili powder and cumin, salt and pepper to the meat as it cooked. I definitely plan on making this again.

My husband loved this dish.  I swapped the canned black olives for slices of pimento stuffed green olives.  Much better!!  Feel free to add more to taste, it really makes this dish.

Awesome recipe!  I did take the advice and double up my tortillas and it turned out fantastic.

I added corn and rice just because I had leftovers in the fridge. With some sour cream, salsa, and lettuce it was a big hit with the family

I was afraid of the crushed tomatoes since I do not enjoy them typically, but they worked out great! I followed some other reviews and used taco seasoning and toasted the tortillas before layering them. It tasted so good my husband wanted me to make it again the next day!

I am glad I took other reviews advice and doubled up on the tortilla layer. It gave it a better texture and didn't get as soggy. Also to simmering longer for added flavor. I added more cheese then the recipe calls for and added green onions and Jalapeño peppers for more heat. I will make this again

Good flexible recipe. I halved the recipe. Left out olives (2 don't like them). Had some cooked ground beef, but not that much, added onion, pepper, fresh tomato and corn for bulk along with some taco seasoning. Didn't have a lot of shredded cheese so did part American cheese. Once I had it assembled looked dry (no canned tomatoes or taco sauce). Put a small can of tomato sauce, a big spoon of red salsa and two big spoons of green salsa (from the fridge) and a tsp of chili powder in the blender to make my own sauce. Poured that over the top and then added the final layer of cheese. A little salty (American cheese?) but still very tasty.

the trick to this recipe is letting all of the ingredients simmer for as long as possible. It was also not spicy enough for my taste, so next time i will be adding some jalapeño or serento peppers as well

Omg this pie is soooooo good! I halved the recipe and used leftover chicken from the Easy Cheesy Chicken recipe on allrecipes instead of ground beef. I heated up the chicken in the skillet, then added an onion and one clove garlic, and then mixed in 3/4 can black olives, 1/2 can green chiles, whole can rotel, and 3oz taco sauce. I used a 2.5 qt casserole dish and layered my casserole as follows: chicken mixture, shredded Mexican cheese, tortillas (with refrained beans spread on) bean side down. I repeated that twice. On top I had a layer of chicken mixture, refried beans, 1/4 can black olives, and cheese. Baked it for about 27 minutes and it was amazing. Will definitely be making this again but next time will try ground beef. Next time I will also have to make 2 separate pies bc my picky husband doesn't like any of the veggie ingredients. I'm sure I used more cheese than called since I just sprinkled it over each layer. Great recipe!! Thanks for posting!!

I made this recipe today but did not have everything I needed to go exactly as written, however it was really good!! I used green enchilda sauce instead of the taco sauce, a can of whole kernel corn instead of the black olives, only 1 can of refried beans and I used hot green chilies for a little punch!  I also added about 1 tsp. (give or take a little) garlic salt, black pepper and season salt...DELICIOUS!!!!

This recipe was great!  Followed closely except forgot to get 2nd can of refrained beans so used one can black beans.  Someone said to simmer ingredients long enough.  That is right on...comes all together nicely and not too runny..will make this again. I have an oval glass casserole dish which was perfect!!  Will make again!!

Loved it!  I forgot taco sauce at the store and used a jar of salsa in place of diced tomatoes.  It was delicious!  I made it in 2 deep dish pie plates and still had 3 tortillas leftover.  I think next time I'll double layer the tortillas in between the layers.  I might also do this in a casserole dish instead of the pie plates.  Either way my husband and I loved it!  The kids weren't so keen on it, more for us!

I made this last night. Overall very delicious. I followed other advice and put two tortillas on the bottom to make a sturdy base, but used one for the other layers. Mine did not get soggy at all. Will make this again. Thanks for posting!

I read through the reviews as well and made the following changes. I added taco seasoning to the ground beef mixture and did not add the refried beans. I spread the beans on the tortillas and it worked well! Great flavor - will definitely make again!

I had my doubts about this one, but it came out FANTASTIC! The only change I made was to keep the beans and meat mixture separate. I spread the layer of beans directly on the tortillas then put the mixture on top. FABULOUS. I cut this recipe in half and still fed my fiance and myself for dinner. Brought the leftovers in for lunch and fed both of us again plus 3 co-workers. It is A LOT. They all loved it so much they had me send them the recipe. It was a success! I will be making this again for sure.

I observed many comments, so i decided to deep fry the flour tortillas in peanut oil.  The middle one may be a little soggy, but not gooey.  I used a Pie Tin and put a tortilla on the bottom, (this is better for serving), then add some mixture, cheese, then repeat again. I add another tortilla on the top, adding shredded cheese and chopped green onion to the top after 20 minutes. and let cook another 10.  A lot of variations for this recipe, I love it.  This batch mix was shredded Chicken, Pablano Pepper, Red Onion and crushed Black Olives and refried beans.

Yum Yum Yum.  I prepared this for a poker party and not even a crumb was left.  I prepared (exactly as written) the day before and kept in fridge.  After baking it, I cut it into small squares so you could either eat as a finger food or add toppings and eat with a fork.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  This is a winner!  Thank you.

This was pretty good. I used a 9 in pie glass so I could only fit three tight layers. It needs a little more spice. The guys really liked it. Very heavy dish. Also, separate the refried beans. Do not mix them into the meat, spread them on the tortilla.

All kids ate and liked.  The enchilada sauce or chili powder make it a tad spicy so more sour cream was needed as a side.  The corn tortillas were a winner!!!

I used less meat and more refried beans.  I followed another reviewer's advice and spread the beans on each tortilla.  This was a big hit, and I was able to make it up earlier in the day and just bake at dinner.

This was a hit with everyone. I made this vegetarian with the ground Morning Star "beef" and next time, I will probably smash up black beans and put them directly on the tortilla. Top it with good quality salsa or pico de gallo, shredded lettuce, and sour cream. Kids really love it.

This was wonderful!  Made exactly as written except that we cut it in half as it's just 2 adults and a 5 year old, and we doubled the tortillas as suggested to avoid sogginess.  It was more than enough with left overs.  Served with tomatoes and sour cream.  Didn't find that this needs any adjustments to be a great dish.  This will become a regular in the house.  Thank you!

We're from SE Texas so TexMex is the way of life,LOL! I prepare Mexican dishes often and am always looking for more to try. This dish is good. I added a little corn. Add taco seasoning and/or cumin and chili powder to make it taste truly authentic. I sub'd salsa for taco sauce cause I didn't have any. I followed someones recommendation to use 2-3 tortillas for the tortilla layers instead of a single layer. A salad on the side and some sour cream on top and it's good. I often put avocado or guacamole with these dishes if I have it. The cumin and chili powder make it taste like Mexican food should in Texas. It makes a ton so half it or freeze it unless you need that much. I had to use a lasagna pan! We have big eaters, and this type of dish is almost better as leftovers!

Very good dish.  All I added was a envelope of taco seasoning with the browned beef,  I put it in a 8"x12" dish so I had lots left.  With the left over I put in a couple small oven safe dishes covered with cheese and baked until the cheese bubbled and called it my Loaded Queso dip for chips.  I also sprinkled a few Jalapenos on both dishes.  Easy to make and lots of flavor.

This was amazing! My family loved it. I varied the recipe a bit for what I had in the pantry. I used red enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce, and did not add the tomatoes. It turned out wonderfully and was a hit. I'd like to add cilantro next time. This is a definite addition to the rotation.

This was really good and I will make again for sure. The filling is fantastic and would work for regular burritos as well. I cut the recipe in half and am glad I did. It was plenty for my family of 4 and we even have leftovers. I used 1 can of Kuners refried black beans with roasted chilies. I skipped the can of green chilies since my beans had them in it already. I also did not mix in the olives with the meat and beans. I layered them on top of the cheese layers. My tortillas did not get soggy at all, so maybe it is the brand of tortillas that some folks are using. I only used 1 pound of ground beef and 6 tortillas. This dish fit perfect in my Corningware 2.5 qt oval casserole dish. I served it with guacamole and sour cream.

Looking for a new little 'something,' I was delighted when I saw this recipe.  I had all the ingredients on hand.  As someone suggested I simmered the ingredients 40-45 minutes to meld the flavors.  I had one and a half pounds of ground beef so added sausage that I had on hand.  I personally like the taste of the combination.  I had corn tortillas, that I prefer to flour, spread the beans on the tortillas again as suggested by another reviewer, and layered meat, cheese and tortillas - bean side down. Voilà - soggy tortilla problem solved.  Following the recipe with the recommended amount of beef (sausage) mix I had enough for 2 complete layers and finished with the last bit of meat mixture and topped with slices of sharp cheddar cheese. Halfway through baking added another can of sliced olives.  Again, taste being subjective I used half red and half green taco sauce as I love the green. You can top this recipe with any number of fun things - tomato, green onion, sour cream, etc., or eat just "as is." Delicious.  Thank you Kathie for sharing.

This was easy to put together, and everyone in my family enjoyed it. I made it from memory & I forgot a couple of things, but it still turned out very good. It would be easy to tailor it to your own tastes.

I MADE THIS LAST NIGHT. I USED 1LB. LEAN GR BEEF THE LARGER FOUR TORTILLAS, AND SALSA,OLIVES AND GREEN ONIONS ON TOP. BUT, EVERYTHING ELSE WAS THE SAME. I COOKED THE MEAT WITH ALL THE INGREDIENTS WITH BLACK BEANS AND COOKED IT DOWN TIL MOST ALL THE SAUSE WAS EVAPORATED. I PUT FOIL ON TO COVER IT, THEN LAST 15 MIN UNCOVERED IT. THE RECIPE DIDN'T SAY TO COVER OR UNCOVER. WE LIKED THE FLAVOR, ETC. BUT,THE TORTILLAS WERE A LITTLE DOUGHY. SO, NEXT TIME I WILL LEAVE IT UNCOVERED THE WHOLE TIME!

My family devoured this! While I am not a fan of changing recipes around, then giving a review on the "original", I only did one thing different. When I was looking at the bazillion taco sauces/salsas, etc, out there, my eye was drawn to Paul Newman's Salsa with Black Beans and Corn. "Why not?" I thought to myself...So I tried that instead of the taco sauce, and it was terrific! Thank you for sharing this, it will be a regular for us!

DH and I really liked this one! I skipped the olives, used 9 LaTortilla Factory wheat tortillas for 3 layers.  I added salt & pepper and several dashes of hot sauce and used Mexican blend cheese. Baked for 40 minutes in a 13x9 pan. Great served with shredded lettuce, a dollop of Greek yogurt, and a few tortilla chips around the edge. It had a similar mouth-feel of a 7 layer dip! Cut the remainder into several squares, refrigerating overnight, then will put into a vacuum-seal bag and freeze for easy leftovers over the coming months.

I know, I know, it's frustrating when recipes are reviewed after being significantly changed, but I made a VERY much scaled down version of this for my family of two tonight with great success, so I thought I'd share. I used the site's tool to change the servings to four and followed the proportions exactly EXCEPT for ommitting the can of chiles, adding a tablespoon of chopped jalapeño when cooking the diced onions, and using one full can of refried beans and one full can of tomatoes with chilies, just because I didn't want to have a half can of each leftover. I used an 8X8 dish sprayed with cooking spray, and I spread the first tortilla with the bean mixture, flopped it bean side down into the dish, then proceeded as per directions. I couldn't figure any other way to get the bean/meat mix evenly on the bottom without messing up the non-stick spray, and it worked. I let it rest for about ten minutes before slicing and serving, and topped it with a few chopped olives, a couple of dollops of sour cream, and some chopped cilantro. Delish, and I only have leftovers for one meal. Maybe when I'm entertaining, I'll make it as written, but with some tweaks, this worked for my small family.

Loved this recipe! Won't change a thing.  Thanks for a great recipe.  My family was dipping corn chips in the meat mixture before I could get it in the oven.  Would make a great hot dip!

Made this last night for dinner..what a hit. I used a few less tortillas than called for. Strained juice from tomatoes, used salsa (drained) instead of taco sauce. And, as recommended by another review, I spread the beans on the tortilla shells, worked perfect. Hubby loved the aroma when he came home from work while cooking. Thank you

After reading some of the reviews I did make a couple of small changes.  We always substitute ground turkey for ground beef so I did add 1/3 of a pack of salt free taco seasoning to the meat mixture. As I was adding the rest of the ingredients I could smell the spiciness of the dish so I asked hubby to taste test the mix prior to adding the can of chilies. He thought it was spicy enough to I left them out but decided to add a cup of black beans and a cup of corn to help with the texture. I used the 97% fat free ground turkey with a 1/3 of a packet of salt free taco seasoning instead of ground beef, non fat refried beans, all salt free canned goods when possible and low fat cheese. I did also spread the refried beans like cake icing on the tortillas rather than add to the mix. This was awesome and will be added to my list of casseroles!

We really liked this recipe for a quick week night dish. I used half turkey and half beef (hubby couldn't tell). I only had 8 oz of taco sauce so I used that and 8 oz of salsa; added extra olives because we love them. I followed others advice on doubling the the tortillas and spreading the beans onto the tortillas to make the job easier. I baked half of the recipe in a 9x9 dish and froze the other half in a 9x9 disposable foil pan covered with foil. A few weeks later, I removed the frozen one from the freezer and placed straight in a 325 degree oven for about 85 minutes (Uncovered the last 30 minutes); it was super and we did not find this soggy at all. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe! The only thing that I changed was to use another reviewer's suggestion of spreading the beans directly onto the tortillas and laying them bean side down on top of the meat. My whole family enjoyed it.

I've made this twice now and thought it was pretty good. I am only giving it 4 stars because I had to make  many modifications for it to be delicious. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added the beans to the tortillas. I used both refried black beans and refried pinto beans to mix it up. I also substituted white corn tortillas for the flour tortillas. This was a personal preference, and I don't think it makes or breaks this dish, but it was a nice variation. I also did not find it to be spicy as it says in the blurb, but that's fine with me, because I am not a fan of super spicy food. This dish is a good one. I love that it makes enough to freeze for later. There is plenty of room for variation, and I think it's yummy enough to serve to company. I will definitely keep this in my collection.

M family loved this recipe.  I did make a bit of a change.  I substituted a half poud of chorizo for a half pound of ground beef and I added a can of diced jalapenos and spanish rice. I also followed recommendation of prior review regarding putting the beans on the tortilla rather than mixing in. Turned out delicious.

Excellent.  Went with hotter sauce than recommended and put in half a can of the green chills mixed with a half a can of diced jalapeños.  Family loves it, served with chips for dipping and sour cream on the side or top.

On a side note, I doubled the cheese and used a whole normal sized can of olives. :)

Made it per the directions and the other reviewers were right...this recipe makes a lot!  I have plenty leftover to make another Pie or use it in burrito nights here at the homestead.  I got very positive feedback from my kids and a coworker who got a small version of it at work tonight.  The next time I make this though I may go lighter on the taco sauce and use more taco seasoning...All in all, a very good recipe...Thanks for sharing

The recipe was turned out amazing. The only change I made was taking happywife05's advice and I layered 2 tortillas in each layer. I also a package of spanish rice and added it to the mix.

excellent, easy, family pleaser. I substituted salsa for the tomatoes. Easy to add spices to suit your tastes. Took another's suggestion and doubled up on the tortillas when layering and added a can of black beans...wonderful! :)))

This recipe was FABULOUS!!  I added the taco seasoning as several recommended and halfed the recipe to make a 2 quart casserole.  Next time I will make the full serving so that I will have an additional for the freezer!  Yummy!!!!

Made this minus the green chiles.  Used medium salsa instead of taco sauce (that is what was in the fridge)and that was plenty of heat for me.  I split the recipe and froze half of it.  Probably used a little bit more cheese between two casseroles than the 9 ounces. Simple to make, filling and quite tasty.  Thank you for the recipe

I just made this and we thought it was great! I did read many reviews and everyone was right, it does make a lot!! :) I also covered the tortillas with the refried beans, as suggested by others, instead of adding them to the meat mixture. I made some homemade guacamole to go with it! It was a wonderful dinner! We are having it for leftovers again tonight! I will for sure keep this recipe and will be making it again soon!  Take care everyone! :)

I used 13oz of cheese and 8 lower carb tortillas (our brand tastes like normal); I made the meat layers a touch too thick so I wasn't able to use all 12, which meant the end result was kind of sloppy (but still tasty). I also added a finely minced jalapeño and used half a tablespoon of granulated garlic in place of 2 teaspoons fresh. I used a 9x13 pan and my biggest skillet without anything overflowing, so complaints regarding the recommended pan sizes are very subjective. I will make it again but I'll use all 12 tortillas and probably add another can of olives.

A favorite and so easy! Produces leftovers for days. I used one pound of meat instead of two, ground turkey instead of beef and whole wheat tortillas instead of flour. Tasted great and still very meaty!

My 13 yr old son made this for the family for a class project grade at school.  Although I had to keep on him to follow the directions, he was able to complete by himself and have the family really enjoy it.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this last night and it was awesome! I am newly married and didn't pay enough attention to my mom's cooking lessons growing up, so I'm trying to start of easy. This recipe was definitely easy to follow and came out great. I followed the advice from some of the other reviews. I cooked the 2 lbs of meat with the chilis and tomatoes, 1/2 of an onion (my husband is not a big onion guy), 1/2 of a red bell peper, and 1/2 of a green bell pepper. I threw in one packet of taco seasoning (without water) and used half of the amount of taco sauce so it would have a better consistency. I layered everything in a 9 by 11 pan and amazinly it all fit. This is how I layerd it: meat mixter, cheese, tortilla with beans (bean side down).I also doubled the amount of tortillas in the layers. It ended up tasting like an unfried chimichanga! My husband and I love it!

My husband loved this. I opted out of the olives, and I took other posters recommendations and tripled up on the burrito layers. I also split it into two casserole dishes and froze one for this week. Lots of lunch leftovers too!

My husband was bored and apparently hungry at work on day, he emailed this to me to make for supper. I don't care for refried beans, he does, so I made it just as burritos, not a pie so he could have the beans, I didn't have to. It was very good.

Fantastic. I did follow comments and added taco seasoning to the beef, spread the beans on the tortillas instead of mixing in with the meat, and I also did two layers of tortillas. Came out great. Will definitely make again.

This IS a lot like lasagna, just Mexican-ised! Tasty dish and easy to prepare. I skipped the refried beans, just because... but overall an easy dinner to prepare and yummy.

This is a very fun recipe to play with! I change it up a bit every time. Usually I like to  vegetarian style, using black beans and corn along with salsa, cheese, and green chilies. 

If you like Mexican food you will love this, and have some fun with it. Add your favorite ingredients and it's sure to please!

This recipe is great, I used it for bean and beef burritos. I substituted the taco sauce for half a pack of taco mix, this made the mix thicker (more appropriate for burritos) and I prefer the way it taste this way.

Can anyone tell me would it matter if I use corn tortillas rather than the flour tortillas? I usually use the flour, but my bf went shopping ad got the soft corn tortillas. Thanks.

Excellent!  I took the suggestion from others and spread the refried beans on the tortillas rather than mix them in the meat.  My husband and I like it hot so I added 1 can of diced jalapenos to the beans.  Beans are easier to spread if you mix them in a bowl and put them in the microwave for a couple of minuets. They soften up.

Changes made: mixed beans and olives seperate and made another layer with this mix. Added two packs of taco seasoning instead of garlic and onion into beef mix after browning. Used so much more cheese, in between layers - almost 4 cups. It was a very good tasting dish but better the next day type casserole. The reason is because it just falls apart when you cut into it hot. It was so overwhelming that the presentation turned the kids' noses upwards. After I stuck it in the fridge and cut a piece in the morning to take to lunch, it was manageable and square :) Will make again if I need to have something all ready to go and can heat up individual pieces.

Good. Combining the beans with the meat made the texture a little mushy, however. Might try spreading them on the tortillas as some suggested.

This was a great recipe for a quick easy weeknight meal. My only changes were to add a packet of taco seasoning to the meat after it was drained as well as a drained and rinsed can of black beans. Me and my boyfriend both loved it and now have plenty of leftovers to bring for lunch this week! Easily 5 stars in our book!

Wow.  Yum, yum, yum.  My new favorite!!! I almost licked the plate!  Very easy, too.   I changed a few things... I used corn tortillas instead of flour just because I like them better (I think it makes it taste more authentic mexican) I left out the olives because my family doesn't like them.  I used Rotel with green chilies and instead of a can of refried beans, I used Frito Lay bean dip which has more flavor.  I also didn't have taco sauce so I just used salsa.   It was wonderful!

I've got a lot of fussy eaters at my house and this was a hit. Everyone loved it! Don't think I would change much in the recipe. It does make a huge amount, so freezing one for another time would be a great idea.

This is a great recipe.  Instead of doubling up on the tortillas, I put them in the oven while it was warming up so they were not soft anymore.  Will definately make again!

This was easy and yummy and gobbled up by the family.  As other reviews have stated the meat mixture does make a LOT.  I used a big dish and had room for 2 "pies" and we have leftovers.

I didn't have any tomatoes with chiles so I used a can of fire roasted tomatoes. It was a very good burrito pie.  I have also made this dish using taco seasoning in the meat and salsa instead of the tomatoes but I think this has a better consistency when all put together.  Delish!

I absolutley loved this recipe, I omitted the green chili peppers and olives but I feel it came out amazing.  My husband usually puts sour cream on all Mexican and Italian dishes, but he never thought to add any until I mentioned it.  That tells me the recipe was great!

Absolutely stellar. This recipe is very adaptable to personal taste and whatever ingredients you have on hand.  I was slowing cooking a pork butt in some chicken stock (go figure, I know it sounds crazy but it's what I had on hand) to turn into pulled pork sandwiches. But when I found this recipe, I decided to use the shredded pork in place of the ground beef. I served the dish to my bible study group and everyone (super hungry men, women and kids!) raved over it. I served it with some brown rice also cooked with chicken broth as a side dish. People had the option to top the pie with sour cream and shredded lettuce, if they chose to. I plan on making this again tonight just for me and the kids.   Oh yeah, I used black beans instead of refried; omitted the chili peppers cuz i'm just a punk like that; and used whole wheat tortillas. I also mixed the taco sauce with some ricotta cheese and then began layering the meat, tortillas, beans, sauce mixture, and cheese as if making a lasagna.

I made mine by the directions and did not find any spicyness to it at all. So, if you like spicy, I'd add spicy to it.   Other then that, It was WONDERFUL! Everyone loved it! This one is a KEEPER!

I love this dish and so does my family.  I made some changes just because I didn't want to run to the store.  This is one of those recipes where you could add whatever you want as long as you stick to a thick consistency for mixture between the tortillas.  I substituted black beans, corn with chiles, and spanish rice for the refried beans and it turned out absolutely fabulous.  We will most definitely be making this again.

Great weeknight meal.  Didn't use the olives because we don't really like them.  Also used homemade salsa instead of the taco sauce.  Everyone, including my pickiest eater, liked this one.  I liked that it was easy to make.

The recipe was basic.  I used only 1 can of refrieds, added 2 small finely chopped jalpenos, used corn tortillas instead of flour, and used cheddar and pepperjack cheese, double what it called for. Very tasty and will positively make it again.  My husband really liked it, so I would give it 5 stars.

I thought this recipe was just ok, I added ground cumin,cayenne pepper,a can of pinto beans and jalapeños for more flavor. I didn't care for the flour tortillas, I thought they got way too soggy. I have a chicken enchilada casserole recipe that calls for corn tortillas and they hold up perfectly!

Excellent and easy! Had it for dinner (two young kids and hubby loved it), lunch the next day, and can't wait to make the one I froze. (I divided it into 2 like others suggested.) I also spread the tortillas as others suggested instead of mixing in mixture! Came out great!

This is an excellent change from regular burritos, enchiladas, tacos, ect. I followed the advice from other reviewers and spread the refried beans on the tortillas individually, keeping the meat in separate layers and adding taco seasoning mix to the meat. Also used two tortilla thickness to eliminate soggy torts...it was really good and the leftovers hold up well (which is great because I take them to work for lunch). I used more cheese than the original recipe called for, but this recipe is really adaptable...you can eliminate certain ingredients and add what you like to customize it. Topped off with shredded lettuce, chopped cilantro, sour cream and slices of avocado made this a delicious dinner~thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent!!  I did follow the advice of some of the other reviews by not adding the refried beans into the meat mixture.  Instead I used 2 tortillas with beans in the middle for each layer.  I also chose to use 9" disposable cake pans.  This recipe actually made 3 - 9" cake pans for me.  I froze one.  You can't go wrong with this one.

This is very good...and easy! We left out the olives simply because we don't like them. I made this with 2 lbs of hamburger and we couldn't eat it all. I think I will halve it for just the 2 of us.

This is a very easy, tasty recipe and with these few adjustments can be healthy as well.  First I did cut it in 1/2.  I used 1 lb of ground chicken breast, used fat free beans, low fat cheese, whole grain low fat tortillas and in place of taco sauce addes a bit of salsa.  It was delicious.  With all the other flavors you don't miss the extra fat or calories.

OK, I made this just as it says too. My family LOVED it & so did I. It does make a big batch so hope you like left overs or put some in the freezer for another night.  I have seen here where everyone changed it around & never tried it the way it is written & then based their review on that. That is not a true rating  as it is now different! I did just as it said. It was fast & easy & was very yummy but a little spicy for the younger kids...

Tastes great, and is easy to make (just takes a while)! I only used 1 pound of ground beef, half a jar of chunky salsa (instead of taco sauce), and followed the recipe for everything else (omitted the olives), and ended up with enough for two 9 inch pie trays. Popped one tray in the oven for dinner and another in the freezer for later. Followed other reviewers' advice to spread the refried beans on the tortillas and to add taco seasoning to the beef as it cooked.

This was good, but would be much better if topped with sour cream & lettuce or cilantro. I used medium taco sauce, and that gave it a little kick. Two pounds of hamburger was a bit much. Next time I may skip the hamburger altogether and use black beans in its place.

Was amazing! So glad I found this recipe. Made for my boyfriend and his parents and they loved it!  I used only one can of refried beans, & diced jalapenos instead of chilies.  I would use more tortillas per layer next time, or use corn tortillas. They were slightly mushy.  Would be great topper for taco salad also :)   Great flavor

Very very delicious!! Big hit with the family! My hubby, 2 yr old and 6 yr old devoured it! The only thing I would change is to not mix the beans and meat together to variate the textures.

What a great recipe!  I added black beans to hide the refried beans and my teenagers didn't even notice (I told them I substituted them in).  Everyone raved about it.  I used a larger oval casserole dish, used additional wheat tortillas and cut some in half fit in the dish.  I also microwaved the dish for about 15 minutes on 80% power since it was quite hot out and it turned out perfectly fine.  This recipe is definetely a keeper!  Thanks!

This was really, really, good! My three kids loved it. I did follow the advice of  double laying the tortillas to prevent soggy layers. I split the fillilng in half and made a corn and flour version. Both turned out great. I will this again.

This receipe has quickly become a favorite in our household.  Very tasty- I fry the flour tortillas lightly and add fresh chopped cilantro, other than that this is an awesome receipe and the only change I made.

This is a fun recipe that you can alter/customize easily to suit your tastes.  Husband and I both liked it.  I've tried making it with shredded chicken as well and it was delicious.  I don't add the black olives and I've also tried adding a jar of hot salsa and used black beans instead of refried.  So many options and it's been delicious each time.  Will make many more times!

We love this spicy so this is what I do. I use a 9 X 13 pan. I use 2 pounds of hamburger meat, 1 can of refried beans (probably could use 2 but I liked the texture and taste with one can so I don't add the other can), I use 2 cans of rotel, half a jar of taco sauce and a lot more cheese! I add 2 packages of taco seasoning to meat and cook it with the onions and garlic, add in the other things listed above pluse the black olives. I use 3 tortillas stacked and break them to fill the shape of the rectangle pan. So simple, spicy and good.

I made this for dinner last night and I absolutely loved it. Followed suggestions and cut the recipe in half, but still using a 9x9 pan left plenty to share with my neighbors & co-workers ( way too much for me alone). I was out of onions so I used shallots instead & it was great. Added some banana peppers & green peppers from my garden instead of the olives. To top it I embellished sour cream with thin chopped shallots, cumin & a little season salt... it was to die for!

Fantastic combination of ingredients.  My family declared this the bes Mexican "lasagana" recipe I've ever tried.  I used the suggestions of spreading the beans on the bottom of a tortilla rather than mixing them in (ended up only using 1 can), used two thick tortillas per tortilla layer, and made this in two 9" round pans, one to eat right away and one to freeze.

I only had 10 flour tortillas and it seemed to work fine with just 10.   After I made the meat mixture, it seemed bland, so I added a packet of taco seasoning and that did the trick.  Next time, I'll skip the taco sauce and just use 2 packets of taco seasoning.  Yummy delicious!  Thanks for sharing

This Was AMAZING!!!! It is my new favorite!!  I didn't use any black olives (because no one would have eaten it besides me)  The kids and my extremely picky husband loved in.....it was gone in a matter of minutes!  I halved the recipe and and baked it in a 9 in pie plate, we topped ours with a little sour cream and shredded lettuce, will make over and over and over again!!

This was pretty good! I made this with the exception of the olives. I found that 2lbs of ground beef and 2 cans of beans were too much for my liking. Next time I think I will use 1lb ground beef and 1 can of beans and layer 2 tortillas at a time to prevent the soggy problem and balance the flavor.  This is a great recipe if you play around with it, it can be better.

I can not believe how much my boys loved this dish.....I too made some of the changes that were mentioned in some of the reviews....Great idea!  We won't be having plain old burritos or tacos any more....it is just as simple to make!!!

It was good, but too heavy, even with lots of tomatoes, lettuce and sour cream.

FANTASTIC! I was really doubtful about this recipe, but because of all the great reviews I tried it. Boy am I glad I did! I will be making this one often. The flavors all came together wonderfully. This is what I did different, only because I used the ingredients I had on hand. I omitted the black olives and in place of the canned tomatoes and taco sauce, I used a jar and a half of salsa. I also added taco seasoning to the beef. I only used 1 can of refried beans and chose to layer the beans rather than mix them in with the beef. My layers went like this, meat, tortilla, meat, cheese, tortilla, beans, meat, cheese, etc. ending with meat and cheese. I trimmed the tortillas to fit my casserole dish, not doubling them as some reviewers suggested and I added more cheese. Serving with sour cream gave it a finishing touch. This was very easy to essemble and quick to put together.

Made this last night for dinner and really liked it. My only mistake was that I used Hot rotelle and it made it alittle too spicy for my kids. Next time, I'll have to tame it down for my kids and just spice mine up.

Scrumptious!  I didn't put in the can of chiles, so it wasn't hot at all, but it was very good, nonetheless.  I used more cheese than called for; the cheesier, the better!

Pretty yummy. I followed other reviews and added a bit of taco seasoning and separated the refried beans. I used the original rotel and medium taco sauce and it wasn't too spicy for our 16 month old. Everyone was happy.

I skipped the olives cause I don't like them and followed the recipe as printed.  I thought it was delicious!  My kids wouldn't try it--they don't like refried beans.  I froze the leftovers and took it to a Ladies card night.  They finished every morsel!

This was delicious. Next time, I'll try using 2 flour tortilla per layer as someone else suggested and I'd also add more heat to the meat mixture. Also, must remember to serve with some avocado and sour cream on top!

Tried this today and it turned out delicious, as many have commented! Instead of using a jar taco sauce (I didn't have any) I just used canned tomatoes and used the taco seasoning recipe found in allrecipes as well. I added some mushrooms and used monterey instead of Colby. This recipe can easily be modified to suit your taste. I had some all-beef hotdogs as well, which I chopped into small pieces and added it into the ground beef. Everybody loved it! As other reviews have mentioned, two or three tortillas per layer did produce good results and also let the sauce/seasoning simmer with the ground beef for some time to enhance the taste as they blend together. Try it and you'll make it a staple! Good eating!

Took this to a birthday party last night and I got rave reviews.  After reading other reviews, here are the changes I made.  I added a package of taco seasoning to the beef while cooking.  I also added some cumin.  I used salsa instead of taco sauce and used mexican cheese instead of colby cheese.  I used two tortillas together spreading the refried beans betweeen both tortillas.  Because of all the reviews I thought this dish would be a lot juicier that it was.  I do not think a double layer of tortillas was necessary because I thought it was a little to dry.  Will make again using only one layer of tortillas.

I used crumbled tortilla chips in place since it was what I had on hand.  I also used whole beans, just what I prefer.  This was a great dish and seemed even tastier the next day.  Next time I'll use ground turkey or shredded chicken as a variation.

Overall it's good.  Very kid friendly if you omit some of the spice in it.  To tell you the truth it's a little heavy for our families tastes, but good to put on the meal plan once every 2 months or so.  My mother in-law loved it.

i used 1 pound of ground turkey in place of the beef and omitted the olives and chili peppers.  i took the suggestion of happywife05 and used 2 tortillas per layer instead of one.  end result was delicious with enough left over to freeze.  will definitely make again and maybe add some corn to the mixture.

This was really good but it was hard to know how much meat mixture to put between each layer. Had I had a better idea of that I think it wouldve turned out much better. I would say to put quite the thin layer of the beef. My taco sauce was only 12oz. Couldnt find a bigger jar & didnt want to buy two. I also added 1 taco seasoning pack after garlic/onion (no water just the seasoning). I ended up not using as many tortillas because I made the meat mixture too thick and filled the pan before being able to do enough layers. Perhaps I will do more tortillas on each layer next time too as I read in some other reviews. It was definitely a recipe I will use again.

This will be a new family favorite.  I did make a few changes to suit our family tastes.  I omitted the olives and green chiles.  Instead of a jar of taco sauce I used 8 oz. of tomato sauce and the taco seasoning found here on allrecipes. I used a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of refried black beans.  I layered as described adding additional shredded cheese. I also simmered the meat mixture for about 45 minutes allowing it to naturally reduce. This is easy to alter to meet your family's preferences and what you have on hand.  I

So good!!  Followed other's advice and added taco seasoning and cumin (eye-bolled it)and tore the tortillas to fit the pan, worked perfectly.  Two layers of double/tripled tortillas. Skipped the olives, we don't like them. Used salsa instead of taco sauce, didn't measure but it was probably 2 cups....forgot to add or spread the refried beans but threw in a can of black beans into the mixture. Made one for dinner and one for the freezer, not sure how long it'll last in the freezer, we're ready to have it again! Topped with sour cream and guacamole.  Will definately make again.

Easy recipe and I had 'most' of the ingredients on hand.  I added chopped green & red peppers and substituted black beans for the refried beans.  As most, I added a bit of taco type seasoning to liven up the mixture.  Good recipe for kids.  My teenager loved it.

I made this tonight for my family's dinner & it was a hit! I made a few modifications based on what I had on hand and it turned out great! Used taco seasoning on the beef, left out onion, olives & canned tomato only because I didn't have any. I did add a can of diced green chili's for a kick & after making the layers I poured red enchilada sauce over the top. I also used corn tortillas instead of flour because of my food allergies, it's a hit with us, I'll be making this again for sure!  Thank you!!

This was just wonderful! I double layered the tortillas so that they didn't get soggy. I also added taco seasoning and salsa (since I didn't have some of the ingredients) Top it off with sour cream and this is a great meal! I will certainly make this one again!!!

This was a hit at my house.  It wasn't too time consuming.  I added cumin and chili powder to the meat & onion mixture along with a little salt.  (I was afraid of it being too bland.)  I used a bottle of red enchilada sauce as I couldn't find taco sauce.  My family decided that next time we might try it in a 9x13 pan with corn tortillas.  (By the time I had layered 12 full size tortillas and meat mixture to the casserole dish the final produce was a little unruly to serve.)  We also decided it needed to be served with fresh chopped tomatoes, fresh chopped avocado, chopped green onions and a dollop of sour cream as garnish.  Delicious.  Worth a try!

Pretty darn good!  Even with some modifications I had to make due to my pantry.  Only had 1 lb of ground beef, and no taco sauce (I used a few dashes of cayenne pepper).  I used a 8" pie plate, and not all of the meat mix fit.  Yum!

Wonderful recipe. This recipe also works using leftover taco meat. I used my 1 1/2 lbs of taco meat, mixed with Taco Sauce, the can of refried beans, and can diced tomatoes, and warmed it in the microwave. Then followed the directions for layering. It came out absolutly great and was able to use up my leftovers!

I made this serveral times. I bake this pie in a springform pan to help it hold better. It's best to use two tortillas to prevent the pie from getting soggy. Also, I use mexican four cheese blend. This is a great meal with sour cream and a side of spanish rice.

A very good, simple recipe that even my Mexican in-laws loved! The only things I did differently were to use two deep dish disposable pie pans, one spicy for the adults and an extra mild for the kids and I spread the beans on the tortillas instead of mixing with the beef. It was a bit soggy on the bottom though; but still great!

to cut fat use ground turkey breast and low-fat everything else except tortillas, they get mushy. also, no taco sauce.  use plenty of southwest type seasoning (penzey's) and 7oz can of green chile for meat.  1 can of rotel for beans. 1 package of chez and only 6 tortillas.  so easy. bake and let sit for 15 or so minutes.  serve w/ lo-fat sour cream, shredded lettuce & salsa on the side. yumyum

I don't know why many reviewers changed this recipe so much. I made it exactly as instructed and it was delicious. I only substituted corn tortillas for the flour ones, and omitted black olives (we don't like them). I used lean versions of everything (97/3 ground beef, FF refried beans).  Overall it is a good recipe - but plan to serve something light with it as a side - it is a bit heavy and filling.

I followed the recipe with the exception of adding taco seasoning to the meat mixture & I spread sour cream on the tortilla shells between layers. The family loved it!! Very good recipe, I would strongly recommend making extras to freeze for those busy nights :) Thanks for sharing.

This was pretty good....  good enough my picky husband had seconds.  I used the "refried beans without the refry" recipe off this site and spread those on the tortillas (thanks to whoever first gave that advice).  I changed some things in the meat, mostly because I only had a pound, so cut some things back and added some taco seasoning to get more flavor with less meat.  Garnished with sour cream and avocado pieces.

This is a great recipe cause you can modify it very easily and still have it taste good.  I didn't use as many tortillas, but did make the 2nd layer double.  Used Monterey Jack cheese - didn't use the taco sauce, but used taco seasoning - it was a bit on the dry side so we used salsa on top when we served it - I would use the sauce next time ! Also I used turkey rather than beef . My version was probably quite different from the original, but.....I doubt you could ruin this if you have any kind of good cooking sense !  It's very tasty and I'll certainly do it again.  My husband loved it !

This was really easy and delicious.  I did add some chili powder (regular and chiptole), some cumin and some taco seasoning mix.  Substituted a can of tomatoes and green chiles for the green chiles and used refried black beans instead of regular because we like them more. I cut the recipe in half and it still made a ton of food.  Nice change from tacos!  Will definitely make this again.

This was just OK. I followed the advice of others and didn't mix the beans with the meat, and double layered the tortillas. I feel that this recipe was more work then I wanted to put into it. Mainly because it tastes just like burritos.  A regular traditional burrito is MUCH easier to make and tastes just a yummy.

This was excellent! I followed the recipe to a "T". I did split it into 2 9x9 pans and still had some left over. I used the remaining filling rolled it up into two burritos a froze them. Now we have dinner for another night and two brown bag lunches!

I made this last week with a few variations.  I did not have any taco sauce and my last onion went bad, so I simmered the beef in medium-hot salsa instead.  My husband dislikes refried beans, so I used canned chili w/beans and simmered together with the beef and salsa.  I also used corn tortillas rather than flour as I had just purchased some freshly made at our local store.  I layered meat/bean/salsa mixture, then cheese, then tortilla, and repeated.  Mine was a little hot for my kids, but they ate it up with white rice.  I will use mild salsa next time, and try the flour tortillas, and add some frozen corn in the mix.  Thanks for an excellent change to regular tacos and/or burritos.

Yum, this was so good!  I cut in half for hubby and me, and it made a 9x13 dish which was plenty.  Looking at the ingredients, I didn't think this would be spicy at all and since we like things hot, I used spicy jalepeno beans and didn't cut the green chiles in half.  I also used medium heat La Victoria taco sauce.  Wow, was it spicy!  We loved it!  We added sour cream on top to cut the heat.  Thanks for a great recipe!  I will definitely make this again!

I made this exactly as written...but tried controlling fat and carbs... also, I divided the recipe in half... which was the only other "change" I made, seeing as there were many comments about the amount of "pie" that the recipe made.  I used 1# 93/7 beef, 1/2 onion, 1 tsp fresh garlic, 1/3 lg can black olives, 1/2 small can chilies, 1/2 can diced tomatoes w/ chilies, 8 oz mild taco sauce, 1 can vegetarian refried beans, 6 low carb tortillas and about 5 oz of an 8 oz block of 2% reduced fat sharp cheddar.  All this fit into an 11 X 7 pan and was enough for my husband and me and our 2 crabby kids who I knew wouldn't eat too much.  Honestly, it didn't look that great... and at first, it was just okay... but the flavor was really increased by adding some of the taco sauce right on top of the "pie."  I will be making this again... I do think I will use some more spice though... via tomatoes + jalapenos instead of "mild" rotel and medium taco sauce vs mild and maybe stick to full fat cheese, or maybe a mix of both.  It was easy, and really hit the spot for an inexpensive Mexican-inspired dish for a cold and lazy Friday night at home! Thanks!!

This was suprisingly good.  I did substitute and alternate the recipe just a bit though.  I put in green olives instead of black ones (because no one likes them in myfamily).  Then i was afraid it would be too hot so i didn't put in the chiles and i put in mild taco sauce instead of medium but it could have used the medium really.  It wasn't as spicy as i wanted it.  I did half the recipe and it made enough for 4 people plus leftovers.  I will defintely make this again my kids and hubby loved it!!!! If your wanting to make this for a big get together (like superbowl etc...) then make the double batch.

EXCELLENT!  I took advice from others who reviewed the recipe.  I however, used a package of taco seasoning and 3/4 water to the beef, onions and garlic, simmered 5 minutes then continued on with the other ingredients with the exception of the taco sauce.  I instead used 1/2 to 3/4 cup of salsa to the mix.

Not bad but far from hot. I am a spicy guy so to kick it up a notch, BAM add some Jalapeno's to it which gives an extra flavor burst with a bit more heat! Not something you want to eat everyday or a heart attack will ensue but well worth the time of making once every 4-6 months!

This was an ok recipe, so I changed it a great deal. I prefer corn tortillas, so substituted those. I also did not add the olives, made my own enchilada sauce, added chipotle in adobe sauce to the beef mixture, and mashed black beans instead of using refried beans. Following advice from another poster, I used two stacks of tortillas for each layer.

To make sure it sticks together well, I added about 1.5 more cups of cheese. 

It came out nicely, but I'm glad I didn't make the recipe exactly as it is on the site.

I have made this recipe probably 10 times now and loved it every time. I personally put extra cheese on mine though. I have been reading some of the reviews and am going to try it with more tortillas next time. This is a most excellent dish, and yes, it makes alot. cutting the dish in half would feed four but the leftovers are fantastic. enjoy

Even my picky 3 year old liked this ((and she never eats Mexican-style food)) I used others advice and split this into two pie pans and I doubled the tortillas in each layer. I had enough to make the layers as follows: meat, tortilla/meat/cheese twice, and the final layer of one tortilla, little bit of meat and a little bit of cheese. It overflowed the two pans still!! So it makes a lot. I am going to bake one and freeze one next time!! ((I will also use more cheese, as what I used just wasn't enough for us!!)) Thanks....we will use this again and again!!

Excellent recipes just don't follow it exactly like it says to.(Haha!) Don't mix the refried beans and the hamburger meat together. Also, add two tortillas at a time instead of a single layer. Try it this way and it is delicious.

We really liked this recipe.  The only thing I changed was to use just one can of beans.  I managed to stuff it all into one 9x13 pan.  Any of the recommendations from other reviews would be fine, it's all a matter of personal preference.  Since my son doesn't like it too hot - we used mild taco sauce.  Next time I will probably use the taco seasoning instead of taco sauce and use the taco sauce on the side.  We will use green olives and cheddar cheese.

Very enjoyable.  I calculated for 8 servings, but went ahead and used the whole can of Rotel and the diced chili peppers.  I also doctored up the ground beef with a little chipotle powder and cumin.  

With the 8 serving proportions it worked well in a 9x13 pan.  

Very tasty and fun for the kids.

My family really enjoyed this. I followed others advice and spread the beans directly onto the tortillas. I also did not use the taco seasoning, it would have been way too salty. I served it with sour cream and homemade salsa. Delicious!

Loves this twist on lasanga! Didn't use the olives. Also did season the meat with taco spices.  Served on a bed of lettuce I shredded and topped with a heaping spoonful of sourcream and homeade salsa. Delish!

This was pretty good.  Next time, I will use medium or hot taco sauce for a little more flavor.  I also used a lot more cheese than called for because my family likes things cheesy.  I followed the advice of others and made it in two round cake pans.  We ate one for dinner and I froze the other one.  It worked out great.

I just made this today and I have to say that I am really surprised at how good this is. I made this thinking that there is no way that this could be as good as everyone says it is. This is really, really good. I did layer the refried beans separately and I am glad that I did. The texture of the beans layered with the beef mixture is really good. I also used 2 tortillas per layer, no sogginess at all. This went together rather quickly, I did simmer the beef mixture for 30 min. and then baked for 30 min. I made 2 'pies', we had 1 for dinner and we have 1 leftover for lunch this week. Try this one, it is yummy!

This was great w/a few changes; put chopped iceburg on top; used rinsed blackbeans instead, they come seasoned,I added more cumin and put the boat motor on them a second to cream them (less fat & cal). I also used whole wheat tortillas the second time and no one could tell the difference w/ + seasoning. I used PAM and crisped them a little in a huge skillet before stacking. Such a great slumber party dinner for the granddaughter!!

I didn't change anything (except that I halved the recipe).  My 14 year-old thought it was the best and gobbled it up without adding anything on top.  I added sour cream, shredded lettuce, tomatoes and sliced olives to the top of mine.  My 6 year old hated it.  Will make again for sure.

This recipe came out very yummy with a few modifications. I halved the recipe with the exception of the olives, green chiles, and rotel. However, it was so darn good, I'll likely make a full batch next time with the previously mentioned ingredients doubled. Since I read some reviews that this could be bland, I added a pack of taco seasoning and a minced jalapeno. This recipe is foolproof! Season it to your liking and you won't be disappointed. I followed the recommendation to spread the beans on the tortillas and in a 9 inch pie pan, I only used 3. Also, I made the meat mixture a day ahead of time and the taste went from a 2 star to 4 star! Terrific!

Totally tasty stuff.  We all liked it.  I made exactly except for adding the packet of taco seasoning to the meat mix as suggested (is a great suggestion).  I added the beans (not quite all of the 2 cans) to the meat and it was fine.  I did let it simmer for about 30 min. before putting it all together. Just make sure you mix it up well, takes a minute to thoroughly distribute the beans. Mixture should be very thick. I put it in a large deep casserole dish and ended up with about 6 layers and I did double up on the tortillas in between layers.  Nothing soggy or mushy here at all.  Also needed extra cheese but this turned out great.  I used medium hot taco sauce and rotel tomatoes.  The spice level was just perfect for us.  Easy enough to spice it up if you like more heat.

This was very tasty and easy! The recipe made way to much filling for 1 pie so I refrigerated it and made a second one later in the week. In order to make it look 'pretty' I used 3 tortillas per layer to give it distinction. I made the pie in a cake pan. The tortillas were slightly larger than the pan so I was able to put them in the pan and turn the excess up against the pan. I repeated this for each layer. This created a "crust".  Very nice looking and it kept its form nicely. I have had requests to make this again!

I tried this recipe. It was good, but next time I try this, I think I will use 1 can of beans, I think 2 was too many.

This was not only fabulous, but super easy!  I used salsa instead of taco sauce, (because I couldn't find it in the grocery!) and I heated and spread the refried beans on each tortilla layer.  I used an envelope of taco seasoning for the meat, minus the water, and I  added about a cup and a half of cheese to the meat mixture before I assembled the dish.  The flavor was great, and the texture was firm enough to cut nice size wedges without the meat mixture running all over the plate.  I will definitely make this dish again!

What a great recipe.  I omitted the olives as my family doesn't care for them.  I also split it into two 8x8 pans and made one with cheese and one without for a friend who is allergic.  It was good even without the cheese.  Sooo yummy!  We just ate leftovers of it and they tasted wonderful too.

Delicious!!  I halved this recipe and used a 2 1/2 quart baking pan.  I also added some mild cheddar cheese to the monterey and made my own taco sauce since I couldn't find it in the store. It was soooo good.  The family loved it.  I will definately be making this again!

My family and I really like this recipe.  It freezes very well.  I try to make it healthier by using fat free refried beans, lean ground beef and 2% cheese.  My picky husband has yet to notice and always eats the leftovers.  Actually, we both agree that it tastes better the next day.

Another recipe to add to my collection of favorites! While eating it, I asked my husband, who refuses to eat leftovers, if he would eat these leftovers. He said, "there might not be any leftovers!" He loved it.. and took the leftovers to work for lunch! Yeah!

I wish there were half stars because this one deserves 4 & a half!  I changed a few things mainly cutting back on the amount of ground beef to 1 lb which was plenty.  I omitted the green chile peppers and the dish wasn't lacking flavor at all because of it.  Although I think it's just a matter of preference I recommend using refried black beans.  I added in a couple palmfuls of chipotle seasoning which gave the dish a little heat.  

One thing I will do next time that was recommended in another review was to double/triple the tortillas when layering them so each layer or tortilla is a little more substantial.

Wow! This was REALLY good!!! My boyfriend, who doesnt care for hardly any sort of mexican food really liked this! After reading the reviews I made some alterations. First, I didnt use any olives cuz we didnt have any. I followed the suggestions of others and instead of mixing the zesty beans in w/the meat I spread on tortillas, which I layered 3 tortillas together in a stack. Oh, Also, when I browned the meat I used some of the Taco Seasoning I on this site for some extra flavor. Very Yummy. Next time, I might try using two layers of tortillas instead of three though.

I took the advice of someone and halved the recipe since it's just two of us.  I used a 1 lb of beef and mixed in taco seasoning as directed on the pkg.  Layered as instructed but put the beans on the tortillas to make it easier.  I didn't add the taco sauce and it was good without it, but will add next time to give it an extra zing.  Really an easy recipe that gives an old standby a new look.  Thanks!

Excellent!!!  I love that you can add your favorite items.  I added a can of corn and used 2 tortillas for each layer with some refried beans between each.  Will definitely make again and again.

I thought this was pretty good.  I will probably skip all the peppers next time.  Including the ones in the tomato.  It was a bit spicy so next time i will get reg tomatoes instead of them with peppers in it.  I too did not mix the beans in, instead just use them as a layer by smearing them on the bottom of the tortilla layer.

I have to say I was pretty skeptical about this recipe.  I didn't think that the taco sauce would taste very good in it.  Wrong!!  This was actually a really nice change, and the kids ate it.  Thanks!

I didn't read the recipe correct as I was rushing off to the sote, so I ended up using Salsa instead of taco sauce. Still worked out nicely. Also couldn't find colby cheese so just used "mexican" and my tomatoes didn't have green chilis, oh well still tasted wonderful. I also used the same technique as many reviewers had suggested, by putting the beand on the tortilla instead. It dawned on me that I was making more or less a mexican lasagna. My husband is of hispanic background not to mention and VERY picky eater and he loved it! Even my picky kids had seconds! Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good.  I used homemade canned tomatoes.  Very good flavor through out.  I spread the beans on the tortillas as other reviewers suggested.  Worked out great.  I think next time I would put a couple more tortillas down at a time. Still turned out great!

I used 1.5 lb of ground beef. After cooking the onions, a jalapeno and garlic I added a package of taco seasoning. I used diced tomatoes with Lime and Cilantro. Subbed a can of enchilada sauce for taco sauce. Follow recipe. Cook for 10 min. Top with crushed tortilla chips and bake for 10 min more. Let stand 5 min. Top individual servings with chopped green onion and sour cream. Quick easy dish to prepare,

I did not like this recipe.  The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is because my 4 year old son actually woofed it down (highly unusual) and told me "Thank you for cooking this yummy dinner" (even more unusual).  The flavors didn't mix well to me.  I usually really like recipes like this.  Maybe I was just having an off day!

This was really good.  I used veggie meat instead of beef and you couldn't tell the difference.  I cooked the "meat" with taco seasonings and the onion and garlic.  Put the beans on the tortillas and layered in that way.  Even with the recipe cut in half, it was still huge.  Made really good leftovers too.

This is soooo good!!  I did fiddle with it a bit.  I added frozen onions and peppers in with the ground beef, then added taco seasoning,a can of rotel(green chiles and lime) can of  green chiles,olives and some garlic.  Then I followed others advice and did meat mixture, cheese and beans spread on the tortillas bean side down.  My husband said its better than our local mexican restaurant.

This tasted really good.  I took the advice from some comments and put the beans on the tortillas instead of in with the meat, and I think this is the smarter way to go.  I added a little to much of the diced green chili peppers, but it just added a bit of a kick.  My only problem was I put it in to small of a casserole dish.  This recipe makes ALOT even if you cut the servings.  I will definatly make this again!

Warning this recipe makes a TON.   That being said, this is a great meal, and the leftovers are even better!.  I like a little more zip to mine, so I add a can of diced jalepenos instead of diced chiles. This would be great for a potluck dish.

This was nice change to eating regular burritos. I did as others and left the hamburg and beans separate. I added taco seasoning to the burger along with the half onions, green chiles, tomatoes. I then spread fat-free refried beans on wheat tortillas, reduced fat cheese, blk olives and more onions (since we like crunchy onions). I used red sauce from can in lieu taco sauce, topped with cheese and garnished with more black olives. We put shredded lettuce and a dollop of light sour cream on top after baking. I did use an 11 X 15 baking dish, it was a lot but leftovers next day were great heated in microwave.

I was hungry for something with Mexican flavor but didn’t want to stand over the stove. This dish was perfect, easy and my husband loved it. I threw it together in the afternoon and warmed it up as I took my walk.

Made this recipe vegetarian by using veggie crumbles in lieu of ground beef. Easy to make, and really tasty.

I had to work late one night and my 14 year old son ended up preparing this dish.  He used corn tortillas (in error) but it still came out pretty good.  This was easy enough for him to prepare and my family enjoyed it.  Thanks for the recipe.

I really liked this recipe. I haven't followed it exactly either time I followed it. I omitted the olives, and did like the other people suggested and put the beans on the tortillas. I always use ground turkey as well. Very good and versitile.

This recipe is fabulous.  Used black beans instead and added mexi-corn and taco season, as well as green chilies.  Sprayed the pan with Pam and started with the tortillas.  We LOVE it!

Great recipe. It's better called "Mexican Lasagna", since you're spreading a sauce made from burrito ingredients between layers of flour tortilla. The tortilla acts like lasagna noodles in a traditional Italian recipe. If you make this recipe, be aware that it is HUGE - it says it makes 16 portions. We made a half batch and basically it's at least three dinners for two. We used salsa instead of the taco sauce the recipe calls for, and we added some cumin and oregano to add a little extra flavor to the filling -- by itself, the filling was a little bland. I definitely think the filling portion of the recipe is open to substantial tweaking.

I thought this was wonderful with the changes I made.  Halved the recipe, no onions or olives, added a packet of taco seasoning, browned the tortillas, and spread the beans on the tortillas. Layered as recipe called for.  Will be making this again.

Love this!  My mom requests this whenever I go home to visit and my guy friends love it!  Best of all, you can control how hot it is by using mild, medium, or hot taco sauce.  I use 3 tortillas for each layer.  It's never been runny, but I drain some of the liquid from the chiles and tomatoes.  Also, you might want to gradually add the taco sauce if you're worried about it being runny.  I serve this with lettuce, sour cream and cold beer.  Delicious!

Wow, this makes alot of food!  But tastes great!  I followed others' advice and spread the beans separately.  Also added corn.  My husband isn't a casserole fan, but went back for seconds and thirds on this!

I made this for my family recently and they loved it.  My daughter thought it was a little too spicey, but my husband and I thought it could have used a little more heat. I will make this again, but next time I might try corn tortillas instead of the flour. Flour was good, but didn't add much to the flavor. My only problem with this recipe is the name.  I think it could be called Mexican Lasagna or something other then Burrito Pie. Very good though.  Thank you for the recipe.

I thought that this was great.  I did add a packet of taco seasoning and instead of the 4 oz can of chili's I just got a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with chili's.  I put 1/2 of the taco sauce in the meat mixture and the other half on the bottom of the pan.  I also put a double layer of burrito shells in for each layer.  We put both sour cream and salsa on the top when served and it was great.  Easy too.  It makes alot and I froze the leftovers and I think they tasted even better when it was reheated after freezing!!!

This was very good.  Although I didn't read the directions very well regarding the tortillas but it still turned out good.  Next time, I will definitely use more than one layer of tortillas and I'm sure it will be that much better.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this! I followed other reviewers advice: halved recipe for 2, skipped the onion, garlic & olives and just added taco seasoning to the meat, spread the beans thick between two tortilla's so that each layer had two, then baked in a 9in cake pan and the torilla's fit perfectly!

I made this recipe last night and it was fantastic.  I will make again.  I change somewhat after reading reviews from others.  I sprayed my 13X9 pan with Pam and then spread a 6 oz. jar of medium taco sauce in bottom of pan in replace of the meat mixture.  This worked well.  I added only 1 6 oz. jar of medium taco sauce, 1/2 pack of taco seasoning, dried corinader, salt, valentine mexican sauce, 1/2 cup Pace Picante Sauce, meat, onions, garlic, 1 can of Rotel mexican style tomatoes, 4 oz or a little more of chopped hot jalapenos to the meat mixture and let simmer for 40 minutes.  I also warmed the tortillas before I started layering.  I cooked my beans separatedly with a little bit of butter and 1/2 cup of Pace Picante Sauce.  Then I layered as follows:  Spray Pam on bottom and sides, spread 1 6 oz. jar of taco sauce. Layer with warm tortillas, I also cut to make more of pie effect and made sure that it was covered as such.  Layered the beans on first layer, top with cheese and sprinkled hot jalepenos on top.  Then another layer of warm tortillas, toped with all of the meat mixture, then cheese, baked in oven 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes.  Let sit for 10 minutes after taking out of oven.  Serve with sour cream and salsa if you wish.  Had a really good taste.

I made this with Mexican Rice III from this site for a group of Firefighters and it was a huge hit! As other cooks mentioned, the meat mixture filled my pan, so I took the 2 cans of refried beans and added a little milk to make it more spreadable and used that as an extra layer (tortillas, beans, meat mixture and then cheese).  Worked out great!

Very easy and very tasty.  I don't like onions so instead of the onions and garlic step, I used a packet of taco seasoning - worked out great!  We ate the dish with tortilla chips.  It didn't take much to fill us up!

I fixed this over the weekend for a Mexican potluck dinner and it was a hit!! Will defintely prepare it again.  I mashed the leftovers, spread that mixture on tortillas, rolled them like a burrito and heated in microwave, just for something different.

A great mexican night variation. I used 1.5 lbs ground beef mixed with 10oz bot. of taco sause, 1/2 c chunckey salsa, 6oz green chili sause, taco season packet,  1 can of refried beans 12 tortillas. Baked tortilla's on stone 5 min at 375. Used a 13X9 pan and followed the recipes layering instructions,used 4 tortillas per layer with 3 layers.  Used mozerrella and cheddar cheese.  Baked at 350 for 25 min. Looked and tasted great and stayed together and served well.  Definately will make again. Topped with lett/tom and sour cr. Super leftovers. Thank you for this great concept!

I think this would also make a great mexican dip (minus the tortillas).  I made mine with Corn tortillas as my husband can't eat wheat and this recipe still turned out great.

This was good. Easy. I don't normally like refried beans, but with them mixed in with everything else, it was good.  Served it with sourcream.

This recipe makes a lot!  I cut it in half and was still able to get several meals out of it.  I used two tortillas per layer and it worked out great, no problems with soggy tortillas here, just delicious.

I followed the directions and the torillas just got too gummy.  We ended up scooping the mixture into tortillas and eating it like burritos.

Kids and husband really liked this one.  I thought it was pretty good for what it was...a kid friendly change of pace.  Next time will probably spice up a bit more and add some black beans, green onions, etc.  Thanks!

Great recipe! It was very tasty. We used corn tortillas instead of Flour and a mexican blend of cheeses. The kids loved it as well. This dish would be great for potlucks and big gatherings.

This is a GREAT recipe! I have made it twice now....once for a Monday night football party of 20 people and EVERYONE wanted the recipe. Since I have a heavy hand and always end up with left over meat mixture....both times I have used this for Taco Pizza. Just place mixture on a pizza crust topped with cheese then bake until done and top with shredded lettuce, tomatoes and ranch dressing! My 4 year old twins LOVE it!!!!

LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT!!! Great recipe... the taste was EXCEPTIONAL! I didn't think it was mushy or bland as some of the other reviewers mentioned, not at all! I too added some corn with the meat mixture, cut the recipe in half, and let the meat simmer a while longer with the sauce (about 40 mins). Husband and I enjoyed it and will definitely be making this again!

Very good, easy recipe. I make this regularly now. I have a family of 4 and I find this makes enough for 2 meals (with plenty of leftovers). Instead of halving the recipe, I assemble it in two smaller 11X7 casserole dishes and freeze one for later.

We were quite happy with this recipe.  It was tasty and easy to throw together.  I added some leftover blackbeans to the mixture and used more cheese than the recipe called for.  When layering I spread refried beans on top of the tortilla instead of mixing it in with the meat.  We will make this again.

It was AWESOME... I could not believe how much my husband ate.  Definitely a 5 star keeper!! 

All I changed was adding taco seasoning, used turkey instead of hamburger, and throwing in a couple green "all natural" tortillas to give it a little more color and make it feel healthier.  :)  I made it the night before and put half in the fridge and half in the freezer.

This recipe has all the characteristics of a five star recipe:  relatively easy to make, relatively quick, appeals to all ages and tastes very good!  Everyone had seconds, including my 16 month old who hardly eats anything.  I made the recipe almost exactly as written, and I thought it had plenty of flavor.  The only change I made was to use some corn and some flour tortillas, because I had both on hand.  I thought the corn tortillas were a nice touch.  I will make this again and again!

My family loved it! I added a touch of taco seasoning and cut the recipe in half also. In only used 4 small tortillas in a 2 qt. dish, and I kept the cheese amount the same as the original recipe. Very good - my husband took it to work for lunch the next day. Served with Spanish rice and refried beans w/ cheese on top.

I made this but omitted the olives as we do not care for them, and all I had was Tex-Mex cheese blend, so I used that instead of the Colby.  My husband and I enjoyed it although it was not a hit with my kids.  Next time I will try adding taco seasoning to the ground beef.

Very Good!!  Everyone here enjoyed this dish, I only made a few changes. First, I omitted the olives and green chili's, since I have two small children.  The meat, rotel, taco seasoning and taco sauce was just fine for us.  Second, I did double up the tortilla's, I actually ended up using 16 in all for two layers and I spread the beans directly onto the tortilla.  The girls had sour cream with theirs and we had some homemade Salsa Verde with ours since we like it hot!  Homemade Mexican rice went perfect with.  This makes a ton so plan on sharing or freezing! By the way....I didn't tell my dh what this was called, he said "man this is good, tastes just like a burrito"  He had 3 servings!

This was awesome! I added a packet of taco seasoning as suggested. I served it with shredded lettuce, cheery tomatoes, sour cream and salsa. Just throw some taquitos and spanish rice alongside it and you have yourself a Mexican feast! Thanks!

Very good.  I used corn tortillas and added frozen corn.  I also used 2 cans of chilies.  DELICIOUS!  I also froze 1/2 after it came out of the oven.  We ate it a few weeks later and it was still wonderful.

Great recipe just the way it is listed. I did add taco seasoning to the hamburger which added some needed spicy flavor to this recipe. I will definately make this recipe again. It is yummy when I substituted chicken for the humburger.

I always like trying out mexican style recipes and this one was fun and new. I added in a packet of taco seasoning to the meat along with some cumin. I also didn't add the beans to the mixture- I spread them on the tortillas while layering them. I split the mix into two 8 inch round pans and froze one since I was only cooking for two. I served it with shredded lettuce and sour cream and it was great! I'm having some leftovers for lunch right now!!

I added taco sauce to the meat, left out the chilis, and served it with sour cream.  I thought the meal was good but my family wasn't as impressed.  I guess we'll just stick to tacos.

This was so easy to make and very yummy.  I have added this to a list of recipes that my cooking challegned husband can make on nights I don't feel like cooking.  We used reduced fat cheese, very lean ground beef and fat free refried beans to try a cut some calories/fat.  I also cut everything in half since it makes an incredible amount of food.  Half a recipe fed my husband and I for 3 nights.  Will defintely make again.

Excellent taste but clumped together.  Next time will try with a 9x13 pan insted of round casserole dish to look more like lasagna.  Used fat free refried beans, low carb/whole wheat tortillas and low fat shredded cheese to cut down on fat and calories.

I served this for my husband and his guest one night.  I was told that this was the best thing they had ever put in their mouths!!!  When layering, I used 2 tortilla shells instead of one.  I also left out the olives since my husband doens't like them.  I don't like refried beans, so I didn't eat it at all.

We loved it!  I have 2 very picky boys and my oldest did great with this one.  My toddler wasn't too sure about all the "colors", but liked it anyway.  I followed a lot of the advice of others (added salsa and frozen corn).  This one "gets a smiley face" (as my husband puts it).

I love this recipe, with the modifications suggested by other reviewers-- I cut the ingredients in half and assemble the casserole in a tall round dish, and it fits perfectly.  But because it's higher & denser, it needs to be baked for maybe 15-20 min. longer than the recipe says.  I add a package of (low sodium) taco seasoning to the browned beef, and nstead of taco sauce and tomatoes (and sometimes chiles), I just use a 16-oz jar of salsa.  I use a different one every time, but the ones I will use again are Newman's Own Chunky Salsa (Medium, with the small can of chiles) and La Victoria Suprema (Mild, doesn't need the extra chiles).  I add a big can of sliced olives instead of a small one, and a whole bag of frozen petite white corn kernels.  I use low carb/high fiber tortillas because they're hefty and so don't lose their integrity in the mix.  I probably use 2x the cheese as in the recipe, usually the pre-shredded Mexican-mix kind.  I serve it with corn chips, fresh diced avocado, and sour cream.  I always look at it and think "Wow, that's so much food" but every time, there are hardly any leftovers-- and this is really good reheated.  Highly recommended!

I scaled this recipe for 12 people and served it this Memorial Day to 6 people, and there were NO leftovers.  I served with homemade spanish rice, tortilla chips and homemade pico de gallo.  This was one of the most delicious and flavorful dishes I have ever made.  I bought all mild ingredients and added my 1 spoonful of my pico de gallo and own dried spices before simmering (cumin, cilantro, cayenne pepper, salt and pepper). I also used 1/2 colby cheese and 1/2 american/pepper jack mix (I ran out of colby) and cut the tortillas into strips before overlapping in the dish.  I also used a 9 x 13 dish as suggested in reviews for 12 servings.  One of my guests had 4 servings!  Thank you so much... I will be making this again.

This was really good. I left out the green chilies, because I didn't have any. We took it to a school dinner and it was a hit. People loved it. I put out some Sour Cream with it. Yummy, one of hte best burrito pies I've had. Oh and by the way I split it into two - 3 qt dishes and it worked well. Thanks.

Very filling!  We liked this and found it to be fairly easy although a little time-consuming.  I omitted the olives (personal preference) and added a packet of taco seasoning to the ground beef.  I kept the beans separate and made their own layer.  Also, I halved this recipe and made it in an 8x8 pan.  Hubby loved this one!

This recipe was so easy.  I left out the chili's because my husband has stomach problems, and I used whole wheat tortillas instead of regular flour tortillas.  It was very much like a Mexican-style lasagna.  A big hit!

This was pretty good. I used whole wheat tortillas, and fat free refried beans. Like others suggested I spread the beans on the tortilla instead of mixing it with the meat. I also used more cheese than call for. Will probably make again, as it is simple but I didnt fall in love with this one.

They weren't kidding about this dish being spicy. It was way to spicy for the kids and my husband even thought it was a bit hot. I added some taco seasoning and I'm glad I did because otherwise it would have been all heat and no flavor. I like the idea of the recipe will cut out the chiles  next time so it isn't so hot for the kids. We garnished with fresh tomatoes, sour cream, and guacamole. Had really good flavor and not too dry. The leftovers held up well when they were reheated.

My family loved it, although I did leave out the olives and added 1 pkg of taco seasoning to give the beef a little more flavor.  It did seem like it needed something else, though, so next time I will try adding the can of corn.

This made a lot!  Let sit at least 10 minutes from the oven to make cutting and serving easier.  The left-overs held up very well.

I thought this was great, and reheated really well. I ended up using about three quarters of the meat mixture layered between 6 tortillas in a 2 1/2 quart dish, then rolled the rest of the mixture with some extra cheese in four leftover tortillas and popped them in the freezer -- 2 minutes on high in the microwave, and you've got a quick homemade burrito for lunch!

This was pretty good, I had to leave out the olives and onions just because my kids wouldn't like it.  There were leftovers that were never eaten so I guess it wasn't a real hit with them but they did eat what was on their plates.  My husband and I thought it was pretty good.  The tortilla shells were a little too mushy for my taste.

Very good.  It made enough to feed an army!  Next time, I think I'll cut out one of the cans of beans.  Topped with all the sides (sour cream, salsa, cilantro dressing) it is a winner!

I'd give this 4 to 4 1/2 stars because as the recipe stands, it's good. But, I had to spice it up a bit. If you like your mexican hot, this isn't going to cut it for you. I added hot sauce, red pepper flakes and cumin to the meet mix. I also only used 8 oz of hot taco sauce and it wasn't runny at all when we reheated it for left overs. But, it was excellent. We at it for a Sunday dinner and then had left overs on Monday. This was last week and my husband is already asking for me to make it again. Good base recipe!

Read most of reviews and I did not end up with a mushy mess with the following changes. I made the recipe for 8 people; 7 1/2" x 11 1/2" dish.
Added to 1# gr. beef-- 2 tsp. cumin & chili powder, salt & pepper to taste, 4 lg. minced cloves garlic plus the onion called for. Did NOT use the tomatoes and used only 1/2 can refired beans and a 1/2 jar of salsa. If you like hot food as
we do I added some jalepeno peppers. I
cut in half, six 8" whole wheat tortillas, laying the halves length-wise (overlapped a little) in the dish. I laid the first & third layer with straight edge of tortilla against the sides. The second layer I put the straight edge of the tortilla toward the middle. This way you have a tortilla with each bite!!! I used at least  1/2 pound of grated cheddar and topped the last layer with torilla chip crumbs easily found in the bottom of the bag!!! 
Made this 24 hours ahead so had to bake for about 45 minutes. It was not soggy or mushy. Served it on bed of shredded lettuce topped with sour cream, homemade salsa and guacamole. YUMMM!

Fantastic recipe.  I cut this recipe in half and used a 9X13 pan.  I did not find that this was mushy at all.  Like others I substituted salsa for the taco sauce.  I also added some chili powder and red pepper flakes to spice this up a bit.  I will definitely make this one again.

This dish got rave reviews!  I took another reviewer's advice and split the recipe into two 8-inch round cake pans, then froze them.  I let them thaw in the fridge the night before, then baked for about an hour.  Delicious!

We really enjoyed this dish, instead of Beef however we used chicken, it was a hit, we were hoping for leftovers but there were none to be had.

This was great and easy to prepare.  I scaled it down to 8, and now we'll have leftovers for a while.  Might try freezing it for a quick meal.

This turned out great!  I used meduim salsa in place of taco sauce and refried beans with spicy chorizo.  Served on a bed of shredded lettuce and sour cream.  The texture was much like Italian lasagna except with Mexican flavor.  VERY YUMMY

I made this last night( I halfed the recipe) and there was more then enough for tonight. I used a thicker brand of totilla shell. It was very good. My 11 year old ate it both nights with a smile on her face. Almost a miracle. Thanks!

This is s great easy recipe, my husband said it was awesome!  I did change a few things though, I used Jalapeno flavored refried beans to give a little kick and also 1 1/2 lbs. of ground beef instead of 1 lb.   The end result was tasty, but I would have used about 1/2 a pack more cheese if I had it in the house. Still a winner at my house!

Being a HUGE fan of mexican food, I was sure I would love this recipe but that was not the case. This was very bland and mushy. We did not care for it. It would have been simpler and tastier to just make burritos.

As my husband said - this has potential. Although it has all the ingredients that we like, it was still missing something. Not sure what but will try again. It did not seem hot to us, maybe that is what was missing.

Very good.  I omited the can of green chili peppers since the can of tomatoes had green chilies in them, it still had plenty of kick.  My husband liked it as well.  Will definitely make again.

We liked this recipe, however I did not find the leftovers as appealing as others.  We wasted a lot.  Next time I will cut the recipe in half.

Ok- I made some changes (we're VERY spicy people!)
used ground turkey (browned in taco seasoning)
cooked the meat with taco sauce AND a jar of salsa
1 can of refried beans instead of 2 
It was DELICIOUS!!! and EASY!!!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

This is a KEEPER. Next time I make this recipe I will try it with corn tortillas. I am not a fan of flour tortilla. Just my preference. I also used less hamburger (1 lb.). What I had on hand at the time and will stick with that amount next time.

I made the half recipe and it filled an 8.5 x 12 inch baking dish perfectly. The recipe is just about perfect as is, but seasoning the ground beef/onion/garlic mixture with salt and pepper while browning is mandatory. Also, I strongly suggest topping the entire casserole with a medium to hot enchilada sauce a couple minutes before it comes out of the oven...it's the perfect way to finish this off (we use Margarita's brand hot salsa from Kansas City).

YUM!  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and put it in a 9x13 cake pan, worked great, had 2 layers of tortillas.  I've made a similar version before in a crockpot, but this beats that hands down.
I can't wait to make this for my nieces husband who is from Honduras (he loves Mexican food!).  Thank you!  It's a keeper!

My 5 yr old had seconds.  My husband REALLY LOVED it! Normally, when I make something new, he says it is okay.  However, he raved about how good the burrito pie is.  I used enchilada sauce instead of the taco sauce.  I did not put olives.  I was only able to fit about 5 tortillas into the casserole pan.  There was a total of 2 layers of tortillas. I tore the 5th tortilla into pieces to cover the exposed edges after the 2 tortillas were laid for each layer.  I used fat free refried beans. I will make it again.  It is easy and filling.

Great recipe.  I used only 1 can refried beans and used 1 can black beans.  I took the advise of the other reviewers and spread the beans on seperate from the meat mixture.  My husband and I loved this recipe.  Makes a lot, so I freezed the other half.

This was very good and easy to make.  Let it sit for about five minutes before you cut it and it slices very prettily also.  I didn't mix the beans in with the meat mixture but spread them on the tortillas as I was layering them, and that worked out deliciously.

I cut the recipe in half (and fed 7 people), added taco seasoning to the meet, and spread the beans on the tortillas instead of mixing them in.  It was very good, but didn't taste more exciting than a quicker Mexican dish might.  Makes me wonder if the people giving this 5 stars don't eat Mexican often?  And it is DEFINTELY NOT HOT...

My girls even like this one.  They like to treat it like a dip and eat it with tortilla chips.  We leave out the can of diced green chili's to tone it down a bit for the kids. Recommend cutting the recipe in half unless you plan on freezing part or eating burrito pie all week.

I made some modifications, nothing major though....I halved the recipe (which still made enough for leftovers!) and rather than a "pie", I made it into more of a lasagna in a 9"x13" pan, and I cut the tortillas to fit the pan entirely.  As far as the actual ingredients go, I kept them basically the same, except I added cumin, red pepper flakes, and chili powder to the meat mixture while it was browning.  Fantastic!  Even my kids devoured it, and neither of them like olives.  I will be making this again!

This recipe is the best!!  I use ground turkey in place of beef and fat free refried beans to lower the fat.  It is my picky sisters favorite meal, and the rest of my family loves it too.  If made ahead of time I place it in the microwave on 1/2 power for 10 - 15 minutes before placing in the oven, or it seems to never get hot all the way through.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I was a little disappointed seeing as this is a 5 star recipe. I used ground turkey instead of beef, I also added a taco seasoning packet and ommitted the olives. I used non fat tortillas and instead of including the beans in the meat mixture, I spread the beans on the tortillas when I was layering. My daughter didnt care for this and hubby thought it was so-so....

THIS MEAL WAS EXCELLENT... I SCALED IT DOWN TO 4 SERVINGS AND IT CAME OUT GREAT. I USED TWO GORDITA TORTILLAS EVERY OTHER LAYER AND ALOT MORE CHEESE.. I RECOMMEND USING THE MEAT SAUCE IN THIN LAYERS OVER THE TORTILLAS OR ELSE IT WOULD ME TOO MEATY...  GREAT DISH... VERY FILLING:)

I have made this twice - once for work and again for a gathering of friends.  Everyone was asking for the recipe.  The first try of the recipe, I thought was slightly bland (I had gotten the original taco sauce and original Rotel).  My tastebuds like a little more zing so the second try I switched to a hotter taco sauce, HOT Rotel and added jalapeno peppers instead of the dinced green chili peppers.  This really changed the flavor, but I would recommend them both.

Doubled the recipe which filled up a 6-Quart Nesco oven. The meat mixture came out kind of runny so I skimmed it a bit before baking. Came out great, and the entire family said to 'keep that recipe'

I made this for dinner tonight. It was very easy to make. I would have given this 5 stars except I felt something was missing for my taste. I would make this again. It would be a good casserole for a potluck.

I tasted it before I layered it and it wasn't spicy enough for me.. but then what I think is mild will burn other peoples mouths off. I added about 3 jalapenos and it was just right.. Thanks!

I love mexican food. I couldn't wait to try this recipe, and I wasn't disappointed. I cut the recipe in half and left out the olives, it was perfect for the two of us (just enough for leftovers the next day)

I found this recipe over a year ago and it has never done me wrong!  Add a little more spice or take it away and it is still a pleaser.  I like to make a double batch and freeze one and serve the other.  EVERYONE I have ever served this to has LOVED it.

This was really good. I made it for my husband last night. We both try to eat healthy low-fat meals so I made some substitutions. I used ground turkey instead of beef. I used wheat tortillas instead of white tortillas, and I used low fat mexican cheese instead of the colby. It tasted fantastic and you could't tell I made some substitutions. My husband sad it was a keeper.

We made this ahead of time and then froze it to eat for
some of our meals after our son was born - when we knew
we would be incredibly busy.  Surprisingly, for a meal
with these ingredients, I found it only good but not 
great.  It tastes a bit heavy on the beef, beans, and
tortilla, and a bit light on everything else.  Perhaps
this is because it was frozen for a while....

This was very good!  I added some jalapenos and some salsa (instead of the canned tomotoes) to it the second time around.  I think its actually better in the microwave warmed up as leftovers.  Mmmm!

I generally love all Mexican dishes.  I am not picky, I usually like them all.  However, this recipe was very unremarkable.  Nothing special about it.  Rather bland and definitely not worth the trouble.  Wouldn't make this again.

Very good!!  Cut recipe in half. Followed other reviewers advice and seasoned meat with a packet of taco seasoning.  Needs more cheese then what recipe calls for.  Served with lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream.

I really liked this, but my husband didn't, so I can only give it 3 stars.  It's pretty much Tex-Mex, which I like.  We live in So. Cal. near Mexico, so the hubby only likes authentic Baja.  Thank you for the recipe; I'll just make it for myself.

Excellant casserole!  If I was making for just myself, I would definitely kick up the spice scale.  My wife can not tolerate "spicy" though, and by making according to the recipe was mild enough for her.  Only changes, I omitted the olives(don't like them), added a tablespoon of cumin, and layered bottom of dish with crushed tortilla chips and shredded cheddar cheese(instead of colby).  I also topped the dish with the crushed tortilla chips & cheese.  Try some Franks Chili & lime Red Hot on top with sour cream smeared on. YUM!

Definitely half this recipe if you're not cooking for a huge crowd! haha.. I half it (thankfully), and it's still way too much for my family of three. However, it is a tasty dinner. I followed someone's suggestion of spreading some beans on the tortillas. I'm not sure if it makes any difference at all, but it tastes good that way. Word of caution, though - be sure to spread some of the beef/bean mixture in the bottom of the pan before putting a layer of tortillas in! I learned this the hard way - you'll end up with crispy tortillas :)  Also, to turn down the heat a little if you have kids, you can use mild salsa in place of the taco sauce and use the mild Rotel - still tastes great!

I thought this was good, but not really any better than the usual taco dinner.  As suggested by other reviewers I added a packet of taco seasoning to the beef and I also added a layer of jalapenos to the top of the pie to give it added spice.  I suggest adding more cheese than the recipe requires.

Pretty good.  I cut the recipe in half, and it serves about 4 that way.  Do NOT, however, use the refried beans with jalapenos as one user suggested.  I like things spicy, but that really made this WAY too spicy.

I know it's been said before with this one, but it was sbsolutely delicious. I made only half the recipe and it was more than enough for dinner and lunch the next day. My husband enjoys spicy food, so next time I'll add a hotter taco sauce. Thanks for a keeper!

Delicious! Made a few minor tweakings, such as using ground turkey instead of ground beef, omitted the olives and the extra can of diced chiles (to keep it more friendly for my kids), used only 8 oz. of taco sauce, and Monterey Jack/Colby cheese blend. Make sure to have a circular, deep casserole dish on hand to bake this so that it doesn't tip or fall over as you build it. I made one with about 6-8 layers, and that fed 4 adults (with seconds and leftovers) and two small kids and still had half the meat/bean mixture left over to freeze for the next time I make it. Awesome recipe--a definite must try! Thanks!

Made this dish low carb for my husband by omitting the beans and using low-carb tortillas.  I'm giving it five stars not only because my huband loved it, but because it was so easy to make.  I also added hot chile sauce to give it a little more kick.  Thanks Kathi!

This is so good! It's a great recipe to prepare in advance and give to someone who is moving, etc., along with instructions for heating it up. It can even be made gluten free by using corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas.

I omitted the olives and added some canned jalapenos.  I also just spread one can of refried beans right on the tortillas. My husband loved it, and the next day he was so excited to eat it for lunch.  Definitely a keeper.

My family loves this recipe.  Like most of the reviews advise, I cut back to 1 can of refried beans and 1 lb of meat. (I used ground turkey breast)  I also added a package of taco seasoning and almost double the cheese.

This was alright. Very filling/hearty! I halved the recipe, but used the full  amount of olives, tomatotes&chiles. Plus a added cayenne pepper and taco seasoning. Oh and a dash of ground cumin. I will probably make again. But next time a will make the layers thinner.

I use lean ground beef, leave out the olives (don't like them), and use my lactose-free cheddar, and it's a good meal. Does last forever in a small household, so it re-heats well for leftovers!

Excellent & filling meal.  I left out the olives & substituted salsa (less than called for) for the taco sauce. Also I topped with a layer of tortillas & cheese to make it a little crispy on top.  It was great!  Thanks for sharing.

I halved this recipe. While cooking it, I found it needed more of a mexican food taste so I added 2 tsp. of chili powder and a tsp of cumin and tsp of salt. It turned out great! We ate it with some sour cream on top, delicious!! Will definately make again!

Nice comfort food.  Even better warmed up the next day.  We didn't find it spicy at all.  I added a packet of Taco Bell taco seasoning to the meat because it tasted too bland before I baked it.  I also used just one can of refried beans, as someone else had suggested, and a two cup bag of Mexiblend cheese.  I topped it with a dollop of lite sour cream, and served it with a salad of shredded lettuce, chopped cilantro, fresh tomatoes and red onion, then kind of mixed it all together.  Really nice this way!  I will make this again and will try corn tortillas for a different taste.  All in all, worth a try if you're looking for a different use for ground beef.

My husband and I liked this recipe, even though I may try tweaking it a bit in the future, maybe making it a little spicier.  I made only a half portion and it was still a ton of food!  This recipe is good because it gives you a great start from which you can tweak to suit your tastes.  Very simple to make too!

This certainly isn't the prettiest dish that I've ever made, but you can't beat it for being tasty and easy.  I put my "pies" together in disposal, foil cake pans.  We have one for dinner, and the other one goes into the freezer for another night-- the recipe freezes beautifully.

By far the best mexican dish I have ever had.  AMAZING & very simple - a great 'casserole' without feeling like a casserole.  Can't wait to make it again and again and again!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was awesome! Very filling. Total comfort food. We're cheese lovers so we added more cheese to the layers. Exchanged the taco sauce for enchilada sauce-good move. I didn't think it was too spicy. We live in Ca. so we eat a lot of authentic Mexican food-guess we're used to it. Be sure to buy enough tortillas. My husband thought we'd run out so he only put two on the bottom two layers.  The tortillas layers really need to completely cover the baking pan. I'd recommend three and a half to four a layer to make a complete layer in the dish size recommended. In other words, don't skimp like we did! It makes a lot, so plenty of left overs.

I loved this. My husband was not as thrilled, but I think that was because I made it a little too spicy. I didn't have the tomatos, so I substituted salsa, and I also used enchilada sause instead of taco sauce. Really good. Thanks!!!

My whole family loves this. I usually cut it in half because there is just 5 of us. But I dont usually make any other changes. I have altered the cheese kind and amount. I also add leftover rice or other stuff that I have in the fridge. All in all a great recipe

We really liked this. Used a small round casserole and it fit perfectly. Cut the ingredients in half because it seemed it would make alot. The recipe is very forgiving. I was short on taco sauce, so added enchilada sauce in addition to the taco sauce. Also, some other adjustments and it turned out well.

I was kind of skeptical at first.  When I mixed the initial ingrediants together it seemed too soupy.  But it came out great!  Recipe makes a lot!

This recipe was pretty good. Here's how I think it could be improved: (1) More cheese!  (2) Higher meat to refried beans ratio. It seemed a little mushy. (3) Use lasagna noodles instead of tortillas, unless you like really mushy casserole. (4) Did I mention more cheese? (5) Add some taco seasoning to the meat mixture for a little more flavor.  Still, the recipe *was* pretty good just as it is.

I made a more of a "taco" pie. I omitted the refried beans and black olives and used salsa in place of the diced tomatoes. It was great!

Great stuff.  Used only one can of beans, red enchilada sauce (from this site) instead of taco sauce, added spanish rice and used mexican blend cheeses instead of the colby.  I blended the diced tomatoes, green chilies, garlic, enchilada sauce, one package of taco seasoning mix (kids would have picked all these things out if I didn't).  Use a serrated knife too cut this one.  Turned out great.

What a hit!  I omitted the the chili peppers and used the mild Rotel for the tomotaoes and green peppers to suit the likings of the kids.  This is a great recipe!  Makes a LOT!! So, plan on leftovers or have some friends over!

I made this for my boyfriend since he loves spicy and we both love Mexican food.  I substituted El Pato sauce in place of regular taco sauce, at my boyfriend's request, and we both loved this recipe.  It also made great leftovers.

Like many of the other reviewers, I made several changes to the ingredients and have not made it the same way twice. It is a complete hit at our house!  We use enchilado sauce, salsa, and whatever strikes our fancy.  I keep increasing the ingredients and making more!!! It just gets bigger and bigger and always eaten.  Wonderful recipe!!!  LOVE IT!!

This recipe is a delicious potluck dish and tastes even better the next day.  I like to make it in a round casserole dish and cut into it just like a pie!  If you're entertaining, try making it directly in a springform pan ( you may have to trim the edges of the tortillas to make them fit) and lift the ring just before serving.

I'm really not sure why everyone raves about this?  My brother-in-law commented that it reminds him of something you'd get at Taco Bell, and that pretty much sums it up for me, too.  The flavor is OK, just nothing special.  Much better over fresh lettuce and with extra sauce or salsa on top, and I wish I'd have skipped the green chilis and added some Jalapenos instead -- they would have looked nice on the top I bet.  This is a nice basic recipe, probably really good for kids or picky eaters, but too bland for my taste.

Super good.  A huge hit with the Strictly Meat guys in my house.  I used ground turkey and vegetarian refried beans and they didn't even notice.  It makes a great lunch the next day, too.

Delicious!  I believe I followed the recipe exactly (although mine didn't look like the picture) and I really don't think I would change anything except to add more tortillas.  I served with shredded lettuce, salsa and sour cream.

My family really likes this recipe. I am always looking for delicious meals that I can freeze a portion of,  as I have a chronic illness that severely limits my activity. This one fits all the criteria and it was wonderful yesterday when I didn't have the oomph to do meal prep to get the second pan out of the freezer and pop it in the oven. My family was saying yum all the way through supper. Thank You Kathi

The most requested meal at our house.  Even the little ones can't get enough. I did make a few changes, which I thought enhanced the already wonderful flavor. First, I used corn tortillas instead of flour.  I also added some corn to the meat mixture, along with some taco seasoning, and cumin, and added a layer of spanish rice. I omitted the black olives (as I don't care for them) and I used a 4 cheese mexican blend instead of colby, and put chopped green onions on top layer. Great on a plate of lettuce and topped with sour cream.  Can't get much better than this!!!

I added some chili powder to the meat mixture (about 2 tbsp) and spread one can of refried beans on the tortillas instead of mixing them in with the meat. A standard 15 oz can of tomatoes works fine...just cook a little longer to thicken.

This was pretty good, but I had to "tweak" it a bit.  I added a couple of tablespoons of taco seasoning, some cumin and extra garlic.  My family liked it but we agreed it wasn't quite five stars.

Was looking for a different Mexican casserole from the usual, and this fit the bill.  I substituted salsa and tomato sauce in the meat mixture and left out the olives just because of what I had on hand.  Also used corn tortillas, as that's all I had too.  I alternated the meat mixture, topping with longhorn cheese, with the beans mixed with some sour cream and jack cheese, to stretch it out to make a large casserole with what I had.  It was wonderful and everyone was happy.

We absolutely love this recipe!  I double the amount of chile peppers, use hot (not mild) taco sauce and top with jalepeno's and that gives us the "kick" that we like!  My hubby is from San Diego and grew up on great Mexican food.  He moved to Tennessee to be with me so the least I can do is make a great mexican meal for him!!  Thanks so much Kathi!

As another person wrote, this recipe was bland. We each ate one serving the night I made it and then 2/3 of it sat in the fridge for a week! No one in my household even wanted seconds. It was "nothing special". I was really disappointed to tell you the truth. After all the rave reviews I thought it would be a tasty, melt-in-your mouth dish. I was wrong.

The meat mixture almost didn't make it into the casserole dish.  I am usually pretty disciplined about ignoring the temptation to nibble while cooking, but with this meat mixture, one bite led to another and--well, you know how that can go!  This meat mixture could be used for SO many other recipe ideas, including straight-- as a soup or goulash type dish.  Man, it was SO good.  Then, with everything else added, it came out spectacularly.  After a blooming onion for an appetizer, this Burrito Pie tasted great.  I highly recommend it.  As others recommended, I used one can of refried beans and one can of black beans.  I used medium taco sauce.  Next time I may take the plunge with HOT sauce!

Considering I didn't have any green chiles, I used chilpotes? spelling?.. it was delicious!  The tortillas really did end up getting a "lasagna" feel to them.  It was very delicious.. would DEFINATELY make it again!

This was so fantastic!  I didn't change much, other than adding a packet of burrito seasoning to the meat.  I halved the recipe and made it in a 9X13 pan, and it fed six of us with a huge piece leftover.  Everyone raved about it, including all my kids :O  My three year old even had two helpings!  Great served with a little sour cream.  Mmmmm!

Very good recipe.  Easy to make.  I thought it needed to be topped off with a little taco sauce and sour cream.  (I like rich food with lots of flavor) My husband liked it and he doesn't usually like casserole type dishes, especially ones with "hot ingredients". Definately a keeper.

We all enjoyed this recipe.  Very tasty, very easy.  Even the kids liked it, but I did omit the jalopenos and used mild taco sauce so it would be kid friendly.  Will make it again!

Over all this was a tasty recipe.  I liked it and so did my children.  I was a little hesitant on the green chiles.  But in the end was glad I used the chiles.  Definately not too spicey. I used medium taco sauce and added medium salsa.  I found that it was still somewhat mild.  As for my husband he gave it the 4 star rating because I make my own similar recipe (called enchilada casserole) to this one and mine (he says) is much better.  I have to say I do like my original recipe better too but this one is nice for a change.

This was a great FAST recipe!  The family really liked it.  (however, I did not include the black olives and used salsa rather than taco seasoning.  We have a few that do not fancy black olives...)

I cut the recipe in half and it still made plenty for me and my husband.  I used salsa instead of taco sauce by mistake and it made it a little watery but it was still good.  I did use a full pack of taco seasoning on the ground beef.  This was really good the night I made it, but was even better the next day.  I will definitely make this again.

So simple, yet delectable. Kathi's right - the filling makes great taco or burrito meat. My 2 year-old loved it. We called it 'enchiladas' and she bought it. My husband loved it, too. I think a more appetizing name, however, would be Mexican Lasagna.

Very good.  Made for a covered dish.  Filled a 9/13 for the luncheon, plus a small casserole for my family.  I too used more cheese and added ancho chili powder (a mild chili, powdered), 1/2 teaspoon cumin, and about 1 teaspoon mexican oregano to the meat mixture.  Regular oregano would work too.

This is a very yummy recipe - took it to a neighborhood block party.  I got tons of compliments on how good it was.  Very easy to fix - I will make this again soon!!!! I garnished the top with some sliced olives just for deco also.

I used ground turkey instead of the ground beef, and chipotle flavored salsa...it was super yummy.  Even my roommate who doesn't like beans had seconds!  It's even better the next day once the flavors have mellowed.

This was okay.  A great idea and it does feed a crowd.  It made great leftovers!  I'll make it again, but will probably add more stuff to it to give it more flavor.  My sister suggested using mole sauce instead of the taco sauce!

I served this with fresh homemade guacamole on the side and it was a huge hit with both my husband and my father.  I used a 3 quart rectangular pyrex dish and only needed about 7 tortillas.  I still used all the cheese and the little bit of meat mixture I had left made a great dip.

I loved this recipe.  The warning is right on though, it IS very spicy.  It makes a whole lot too and oh my goodness it was just so yummy, I will definitely make this again.  It was pretty easy to put together and didn't take a whole lot of time.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

One word-AWESOME! Absolutely loved this recipe. Didn't make it as spicy as it could have been and it was so good. Served it with sour cream for dinner and guacamole for lunch the next day. Just as good! Thanks.

This was really good.  I halved the recipe and it still made a lot.  I added taco seasoning and used considerably more cheese than the recipe stated.  I overlapped the tortillas and it gave it a firmer texture.  I will make this again!

Wow!  All my girls (even the ones that hate olives, onions, and chilis) LOVED it and asked for seconds!  I chopped the olives (better to hide them) and topped the servings with a dollop of sour cream.  Yum!

If you are a fan of Mexican-type casseroles, you will like this also.  I put a tablespoon of sour cream on top of my serving which made it more tasty.

This was a really really good dish.  The only change I would make next time I cook it is use only 1 can of refried beans.  Two was too much.  It ws great though!  Thanks for the recipe.

This dish packs a lot of flavor! I will definately make again. I am not big on hot dishes, so I didn't put in the extra can of green chili's, and I used diced tomatoes with jalapenos instead. I also added about 1/2 package of taco seasoning to the mix for even more flavor. Very good recipe!

A great casserole when you need something different.  It was easy and tasty.  It makes enough servings that there is leftovers for lunch the next day too.  I loved it and you can do so many variations with it to make it more or less spicy!

this recipe continues to be a big hit with famliy and friends...i have used different ingredients and made some changes and have used tofu, black beans, vege cheeses, fried egg whites (tastes like bean curd)...used sour cream and guacamole on the side as a topping...still great every time, its the main ingredients along with the layering that makes this work with any ingredient you use...

Very good. I use more cheese because I always run out by the time I'm done layering. We like our casseroles cheesy and bubbly.

Sooooooo good.

YUM!  What a different dish.  My husband made this for dinner and it was just awesome.  I forget how he tweaked the recipe, but I did add sour cream as a topping, as I do to anything mexican.  We will make this again.

Very good.  Took the suggestions to double the tortilla layers and substitute Mexican 4-cheese blend though I think next time I'll use extra sharp cheddar.  I halved the recipe and put it into 2 9-inch pie pans and froze one of them.  Served on a bed of lettuce with salsa & sour cream.

This is awesome!! It was a little spicy, but not too bad. I used corn tortillas instead of flour. I thought it had a better flavor. I only used 1 can of refried beans because that is all I had. I will definitely be making this again!!!

This is a great reciple.  My husband and I both enjoy it.  I use a dry packet of taco seasoning and add it to the browned hamburger rather than the taco sauce.  Makes good left-overs too
Terrific!

It was good, but not as good as people are making it out to be.  I will, however, probably make this one again.  It's not stellar but good for a repeat.  Oh, even if you cut this in half, with a family of 4 you will have leftovers.  It makes a ton.

I down-sized this recipe and it turned out pretty good.  My husband has gluten intolerance so I used corn tortillas instead of flour which tasted just fine.  Looks good in the casserole dish, but not very appealing when dished out - basically all one big brown color.  Definately benefits visually by addition of tomato and lettuce when served. Sour cream on top is a must.

YUMMY!!!  Thanks Kathi!!  My husband and I loved this.  We were out running errands kinda late tonight, so this was a real easy one to throw together.  We didn't see why it was called "hot" in the description though.  It is perfect the way it is, but next time we are going to use more spices and hotter sauce...only because we both like spicy foods.  Everyone should try this at least one time.

Just another review to say we loved it!  The leftovers were even better than right out of the oven.  As others have said, it is easy to lower the fat content of this recipe- we used ground turkey and it turned out delicious!

This was very tasty, to avoid soggy tortillas I used corn tortillas and fried them for about 3 seconds each side in peanut oil.  They held up great even as leftovers.  My family loved this they called it mexican lasagna and asked me to make it again soon. Thank you Kathi.

Very good!  Especially using my own home-made refried beans (which I recommend).  Good with sour cream and guacamole, and salad.  Made half and was plenty.  Reminds me of something I made before - mixing leftover taco meat with refried beans and putting them inside a flour tortilla.  I will use smaller dish next time so I will get more layers (got 2 in 9x13" pan, halving recipe).  Also, I used Taco Bell Taco Sauce.

This was pretty good and tasted just as nice as leftovers!  We used salsa instead of taco sauce and used 1 1/2 lbs 'veggie crumbles' (instead of beef).  Next time I would add another layer of flavor such as a sliced avacado, green pepper, or something else to make it a little more interesting.

Awesome Dinner!  It make's a lot and I made this with only 1 lb. of beef and 1 can of refried black beans.  I substituted corn for the black olives, used salsa instead of taco sauce and added a layer of sour cream, too!

This recipe is easy to make and tastes wonderful.  I use Lightlifes's Smart Ground in place of the beef (to make a vegetarian-friendly dish), and it comes out great.

Great recipe! I used our homemade hot salsa in place of the taco sauce and white corn tortillas for the flour ones to help control sodium. It was quite tasty and ver filling. It reheated well and was great for lunch the next day. We will make again! Thanks.

This dish was a little bland for me (I like *spicy* food), but my husband really loved it.  Keep an eye on the number of servings, though; this recipe makes a lot and I found it didn't keep very well as leftovers (the tortillas got all soggy).

I am usually free-wheeling with my 5-stars, but this wasn't my favorite dish.  Maybe if I was blindfolded??  The taste was pretty good and it definitely "sticks to your bones".  But it looks pretty icky.  On the other hand, if you have lots of teenage boys or men around your house I'm sure that this dish would be a huge hit.

I have to admit I was a little worried when I took it out of the oven but it was really good! My whole family liked it which was amazing. We served it with sour cream. Very fast and yummy!

This was actually good.  Didnt have a bigger baking dish other then a 10 by 13 so we used that.  I also didn't use that many tortillas, which I should have upon tasting it. This will be made again in this house. Thanks!

I used to have a recipe like this, but always fried the tortillas first.  Not only is it easier to cut, but it adds a different flavor dimension.

The recipe itself was somewhat bland.  Not spicy at all - and I'm pregnant!  I added a couple of jalapenos and will use Hot taco sauce next time.  Also will use 1 can whole pintos and 1 can refried to add texture.  I doubled the cheese though.  It made a TON!!!  I'd suggest freezing half or scaling it down. Make sure to use a big enough dish if you don't.

I liked this and so did my family. I added about a half cup of sour cream, some chili powder and a dash of cumin to the meat mixture to give it more of a "Mexican" taste. If you are like me and get in a rut as far as what to make for dinner this is a nice change of pace. I will definately make this again.

A winner here!! Everyone that tries this at my house asks for the recipe-it truly is easy to prepare and down right tasty. We serve with guacamole and sour cream on the side. Doesn't get any better than this folks.

I was very disappointed in this, although my husband liked it. I used ground turkey (which wasn't the problem), whole pinto beans, a can of Rotel, sharp cheddar and only three tortillas.  I simply ran out of room in my dish (somehow I missed that you were to use a 4 quart casserole dish and I used a 10" pie pan instead BUT I had cut the recipe in half). If I were to make this again I wouldn't use Rotel and I would stick to using refried beans. I would mix the beans and the meat mixture as well. Too many "improvements" ruined this one for me. Thankfully, my husband is gracious and loves Mexican food. He had no complaints.

This is terrific, the texture of the beans made it smooth and creamy.  I especially enjoyed how easy it came together.  I will continue to make this, a great week night dinner.

Very delicious indeed!

I have a big family with huge appetites.  I could have cut this in half it made so much.  I also found it wasn't necessary to cook the mixture for 15-20 minutes.  I also cut down on the tortilla and just ripped them and made a layer that way putting it together like a puzzle.

Everyone loved it.  Thank you!

Okay this is my new favorite! Totally easy and sooooo yummy! I didn't have any taco sauce on hand, so I substituted with salsa, it was still very good. This time around I'm trying the taco sauce, so we'll see. Even my 2 year old, who won't eat anything, ate it and loved it! My 1 year old even loved it. It's a new family fav. Thanks Kathi!

Took this to a church potluck and it was gone in no time at all...I used fat free refried beans and lean ground beef.  It tasted super.  Used lite sour cream, lettuce, and tomatoes on top.  This is a keeper in our family.

I didn't used taco sauce - just tomato sauce, and added my own Mexican spice mixture.  I only needed one can of refried beans, but I was playing a big "fast and loose" with the quantities of other ingredients.

It was pretty good, over all, but definitely benefits from that dollop of sour cream (and some fresh chopped cilantro!) for a "freshness" hit.

good, but needs something "crunchy" to give it a little more texture.  Will try sprinkling crushed corn chips at the end next time and see how that works.

This really satisfies your craving for Mexican food.  We were suprised just how much it does taste like a burrito, but so much easier to make and not messy to eat.  I took the advise of other reviewers and used only one can of beans. I'll be making this again for sure.

My son and I liked this. (My daughter wasn't crazy about it, but the neighbor lady had already fed her pizza. That was probably a factor.)
I think this a great basic recipe that is easy to change and add to. I halved the recipe for the three of us and it was more than enough. Next time, I'll leave out the refried beans - I thought they made the meat sauce too mushy. I served it with sour cream and extra taco sauce drizzled on the top.
Using the amount of peppers the recipe calls for, didn't make this too spicy for us (we don't like hot-hot foods), so don't be afraid to give it a try.

I am organizing a tex mex progressive dinner for 40 people and tried this recipe out to see if we could use it.  Not only is it easy, but it is VERY GOOD!  Don't hesitate making this one because it is worth your while (and since it is easy.. really worth it).  Good flavor.

We enjoyed this resipe, but if I made it again, I'd probably change the quantities/ingredients a little. I only used half the amount of beans that the recipe called for and we still found that the bean flavour really overpowered the dish, so I would reduce that quantity even further.

Yum!  My husband isn't crazy about Mexican food, but had 2-1/2 servings of this tasty meal!  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and used 1 can of diced tomatoes with lime juice and cilantro in place of the tomatoes with chiles and the can of green chiles.  I also used mild taco sauce - the result was a meal with a small amount of zip that was kid friendly.

I cooked this tonight & my family loved it.  We don't like real spicy foods so I used all mild products.  Served with my cheese dip recipe, mexicorn, & lettuce, tomato, sour cream & salsa.
Great Recipe.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was a huge hit with my family and friends.  I used the 10" tortillas and a 10" round dish.  I used Cheddar cheese instead of Colby and ground turkey instead of beef.  It was even better the next day.

I like this recipe, but next time I make it I'll add some jalepenos, and use medium taco sauce instead of mild, I'll use one can of refried beans instead of two, and I'll make the layers of meat thinner and use more tortillas.  I think I made the layers too thick, and that was a mistake.  But overall, I like it.  Easy to make, tastes good, inexpensive, but fattening.

Lots of people at our church fellowship supper really enjoyed this dish, and I got lots of requests for the recipe.  To me, that's proof enough that something is REALLY good!! Mine wasn't all that hot....but then I didn't use the HOT taco sauce. It's really up to the cook!!!

I wouldn't say I loved the pie, but I liked it.  It was WAY TOO FATTENING, and extremely filling.  Maybe I'll try it with corn tortillas.  It may alter the taste too much though.  I did add Cumin, Chili Pepper and browned the meat in a package of Taco Seasoning.

Yummy Yummy and suprisingly authentic tasting.  I made this with chicken and used fat free refried beans, part
skim cheese, and lowfat sour cream!  Cut the chicken into strips and do everything the same except only use 1 1/2 C Taco Sauce.  
It was still very yummy and cuts the fat grams in half!

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  My family loves Mexican food, and this one is a sure winner.  HOWEVER, it is WAY TOO FATTENING!  If anyone knows of a way to slim down this recipe, I'd sure like to know!  I would only make this recipe once and a while because of its high fat content.

This recipe is fantastic, definitely a keeper! I made this for my boyfriend for valentines dinner, since we are both huge fans of mexican food, we both loved it, especially my boyfriend. :) I did add some other seasonings to the beef such as cumin, ground black pepper, chili powder, paprika, cayenne pepper and a jalapeno pepper to kick it up a bit more. I will absolutely make this recipe again, but not for a while, it is very fattening, but definitely tasty. Yummy!!

We enjoyed this spicy burrito pie very much!  I doubled the cheese, using a mixture of colby and monterey jack.  We topped with lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, green pepper, and sour cream.  DELICIOUS!!

My husband and I thought this recipe was great.  The kids (1 & 3) weren't crazy about it, but they are pretty picky.  I cut the recipe in half and used salsa in place of the taco sauce.  Pretty quick and easy to make and tastes great.  Will definatly make this again.

This really is a good one!  I did not use all the green chiles,and taco sauce, so it would be more kid friendly,  and I added taco seasoning to the hamburger. Served it with salsa, sour cream, lettuce and tomato and we all loved it, including the 3 little ones!  We will make this one again!  Thanks for sharing.

OUTSTANDING!!! I took another reviewers advice and I seasoned the beef with a packet of taco seasoning mix.  I also halved the recipe and it was way more than enough for my family of 4!

Yum Yum.  This is now a Christmas tradition with my family.  It just can't be beat.  I rated 4 stars for quickness because it is a little time consuming but it is really worth the effort.

This was a huge hit with my kids. When a 2 year old eats something this messy with her bare hands, you know it's got to be good. :) My 4 year old ate it too. I think next time I will use this as a filling for soft tacos instead of making it a casserole. That would make it easier for my little ones to eat. It was just spicy enough for us. (I have a toddler that eats the hot sauce with a spoon when we go to our local Mexican restaurant!) Kimber says A+, Miles and Jada say A. Thanks for this great recipe!

I made this last night and made some adjustments.  I added cumin, cilantro, and hot pepper flakes to add a little kick to it. I made this in a 13 x 9 baking pan and only needed 8 tortillas. This is definitely a keeper. I'll try it with chicken next time.

Very good, but I'd suggest placing a double layer of torts between the bean mixture layers (the single layers got a little soggy for my taste).  ALSO - I like it HOT, so used diced jalapenos instead (for those of you that can handle it!)

My husband and all six of my boys loved this recipe!!  They were asking me to cook it again as they had their second helpings.  It is unusual to find a dish that they ALL like.  We like it so much I printed the recipe and shared it at work the next day.  I found this recipe to be cheap and easy and also made enough for my large family.

This was so easy to make and turned out so good.  I was actually suprised how good it was.  It's like taking a big, over stuffed burrito and enjoying it with out all the mess.  My husband loved it!  I ended up using about 12 oz. of cheese.

No one in my family was impressed with this recipe. We found it quite bland.  There are other versions that we have tried that were much more flavorful.  Love the idea of this meal just not this version.

Certainly not low carb, but it is good. I suggest making it your own on the spices.

We loved this dish.  I did add a packet of original Taco Seasoning to the meat!  I'm glad I did.  Thanks for the recipe!  I topped the serving with shredded lettuce, black olives, avocado, garden onions and baby tomatoes.  Looked and tasted great!

The recipe didn’t call for any seasonings.  I added my own and eyeballed it with cumin, pepper, chili seasoning, oregano, and Goya adobo seasoning. I used corn tortillas for an authentic taste.  I love flour tortillas usually.  I layered a few tortillas as one previous reviewer suggested.  It came out pretty good but don’t put any tortillas on top or they’ll crisp up.  I would make again for myself but I don’t think it looks good enough to serve a guy-friend.

Really good! The only change I made to the recipe is that instead of adding 2 cans of refried beans to the meat mixture, I used one can (not a refried bean fan)as a separate layer on top of the tortillas(at the suggestion of a previous reviewer). Next time I’ll double up the tortilla layer (another reviewer suggestion).

I made recipe "as directed"  
(4 servings). My husband really liked it as did I. When I plated 
mine, I topped with more raw 
onion, a little salsa & sour 
creme! It really is a great 
recipie, thanks so much for sharing. This one is a definite keeper!!

This dish was yummy.  I followed the recipe pretty much the way it was written.  The only thing that I didn't add was olives because my kids don't like olives.  I might add some mexican seasoning to the beef next time.  But otherwise it was great.  I will make it again.

I think this is an OK recipe, but a great base for making a killer Burrito Pie. It was a little bland. Next time I am going to season the taco meat with my homemade taco seasoning that I use when making tacos and burritos. This will give it the extra kick and authentic Mexican flavors. Also, I need to play around with the Taco Sauce or make my own. Good base, a lot of room for experimentation.

I used a deep dish 13 x 9 lasagna baking dish and it all fit perfectly.  I cooked the ingredients in a dutch oven which plenty of room for all the ingredients  and made mixing easy.  I have a deep 12 " skillet and this recipe would have been too much for it.   I  used one can of refried beans with jalapeños which I mixed into the mean mixture. The other can of traditional beans I spread on the tortillas as other have.  Having that stand alone flavor was nice. The extra kick was perfect.  My teenage kids loved it. Tastes much like a fast food meat, been and cheese burrito. Makes great left overs. Will definitely make again. Will try using one can of whole black beans.

I made this vegetarian by reconstituting 2.5 cups of TVP with 1/4 cup of soy sauce and hot water to cover. Sautéed an onion until lightly browned and added the typical Mexican cuisine spices, TVP and a can of mixed beans (rinsed). Once the TVP was browned, I added a can of Rotel and a can of enchilada sauce to thicken. I heated the tortillas on a cast iron pan until slightly crisp, and then layered the casserole with more enchilada sauce in a 13x9 baking dish. I only used about a half bag of shredded queso cheese for the entire thing since I don’t like too much cheese. Turned out great, everyone had a second helping. Nice change from tacos. Thanks!

This was really good and made a lot for just 3 people, but I like to try recipes as they’re written the first time I make them. I’m definitely going to adjust it to make it smaller so that fits in a pie plate. The ingredients were a delicious combination. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this a few times it's great. Last night  I changed a bit. Used ground turkey instead of chop meat, removed olives and added corn. Also used a bit more cheese. My family loves it. Thanks loads for sharing it.

Very tasty recipe! I used most of the ingredients I didn't add in the black olives, not a fan of them. I also top it with lettuce and sour cream once I plated it.

We have had this several times now. The only change is we usually don't have taco sauce on hand, so I cook the ground beef with a packet of taco seasoning. It is good reheated, and also just cold if you are in a hurry. I have even cooked the meat ahead of time, then assembled it when I was ready to put it in the oven. We halve the recipe, it makes 4 nice size servings.

The dish was delish! I added some sliced Jalapeños, black beans and used retried black beans. Used the Mexican blend cheese fircthe layers and top. I omitted the black olives, since the family doesn’t care for them. It was a hit for sure!

I've made it twice in days delicious, quick, simple. That Ro-tel REALLY set it off...topped with sour cream...the Ro-tel didn't make it as spicy as i thought per recipe...so for those ho like a little  kick/zest, jalapenos complimented the dish very well

This was amazing!  I took out the black olives (hubby doesn't like) and put in black beans.  Added some cayenne pepper (we like some heat).  Very easy and will definitely make again!

I divided this recipe in half, made a vegetarian version on one side of the pan substituted black beans for the ground beef. A small cut-out of parchment paper made a good barrier and baked it in the same dish as the meat version.

Made this mostly as specified but had to add enchilada sauce to stretch the taco sauce, used one can of refried beans instead of 2, and I also crisped up the tortillas in a dry pan before layering.  The tortillas still got gooey and generally unappetizing. I had one serving with sour cream, shredded lettuce and hot sauce but did not give this to my family, as I knew they would not like it. Very disappointed.

This is a family favorite!  I always make one as stated in the recipe and one for the vegetarians in the family.  On the veggie version, I just replace the beef with black beans and add a can of corn.

Decent but could have offered optional spices since it was a little bland. I cut the taco simmer sauce in half and glad I did since it would have simmered way too long and been too runny.

The flavor was very good but next time I will need to add some heat to it. I did not like the texture of the soggy tortillas but my husband loved it. I had extra mixture so I made some burritos with it. This makes an excellent stuffing for burritos if you have a problem with "soggy bread" texture. Thank you for the recipe.

I used this recipe as a guideline for basically burrito lasagna. Used corn tortillas (my babe is diabetic so had to go sugar free), refried beans, cheese, tortillas, chicken tenders seasoned with cheesy chicken taco seasoning, cheese, tortilla, and topped with a jar of salsa and more cheese. Yummy!! Thank you

Just like a few others had posted, the tortillas were soft and soggy. Would be better with some sort of crunch. This is a tasty meal and I will make again with some small changes.

This was delicious!  I added taco seasoning to the beef mixture along with a can of black beans. I also followed another reviewer’s suggestion and used double layers of the tortillas to prevent them from becoming soggy. Thanks for the recipe- it has become part of our repertoire now!

I used Taco seasoning and salsa, but it wasn't very spicy.  I should have used a hotter salsa.  Also, I didn't estimate the amount of meat filling to use in the early layers.  I ran out of meat mixture before using all of the tortillas.

Awesome meal! Brown the meat, add taco seasoning & water. Cook until water is drained & then add there refried beans. I cut the taco sauce down to 2/3 of the recipe & make to drain everything else. Amazing!

Thanks so much for the recipe. I modified it for what I had laying around. I used shredded chicken and black beans. Seasoned the chicken with taco seasoning. Kids loved it and wife was happy.  Thanks again.

This recipe makes a veritable mountain of food.  Added extra chilies, and a bit of extra cheese.  Did not have a casserole dish of an appropriate size, so used a lasagna pan (9 x 13 or so) and this filled it with some filling that could not fit.  All of the family loved it, and ate all but a modest lunch sized serving (1 cup).  Will definitely make again for my overly picky hoard.

Will definitely make this again. The top 5 helpful reviews were spot on. Simmer on med - med/high for at least 15-20 more minutes to meld mo mo betta. Spread spicy beans on tortillas (I always use large white corn) & add a little to mixture to stiffen & place face down. Taco sauce was a little over-bearing so Ill use a little less next time. I used 3 bags of shredded cheese (don't  judge me!) Mexican blend/sharp cheddar/pepper jack. Last but not least: a small amount (very small) of fresh jalapeno & habenero pepper for taste. Divinity!

Thank you for a great recipe that is delicious, easy and IMO very economical.  Halved the recipe as only cooking for 2 and still had 4 pieces left to freeze for a few more meals.  Used a 9x9 pan and simply cut the tortillas (2 thick and 4 total per layer) in half then lined the straight ends to the side of the pan with the curved tortilla edges overlapping in the middle. Produced solid layers easy to serve and freeze for later.

We loved this although I had to make a few changes because I was short of supplies. I didn’t have taco sauce so I added the taco seasoning from this site along with the tomatoes and chilis. As written allow the sauce to simmer for a while to get the best out of the flavours.  I also only used 1 pound of ground beef. This made enough to feed 4 people.  I didn’t add the refried beans to the mixture instead I spread the refried beans onto the tortilla then put the meat, then cheese. I wasn’t able to layer all 12 tortillas. It was thick enough at 5. I would recommend giving this recipe a try. It is really delicious.

Yum!  I used three tortillas, which I tore to cover the meat mixture, between each layer. On the top layer, I used queso instead of shredded cheese. It was wonderful and filling.

I made this for dinner and the hubby LOVED it. The only thing was I forgot to buy the can of tomatoes so I had to use fresh ones, but it tasted fantastic. I might mix it up a little and add corn and black beans. So yummy!!

I made this as is only cut the recipe in half for 2 people. It was very good and made enough for 2 nights. I doubled up on the tortillas and baked it in one of those round white Pyrex pie pans. It was perfect. Will be making this one again!

Agreed with some of the reviews about the number of servings.  This is a huge recipe.  Use a VERY large skillet.  I used the largest I had and I had to slowly stir it.  I still lost some over the side.  Would make again.

FAMILY FAVORITE! We call this burrito casserole because we always double the recipe and bake it in a 9x13 pan.  We love the original recipe but over the years we have made a couple minor changes.  We don't add the salsa because the Rotel chile tomatoes have plenty of spice.  We also add thinly sliced tortillas on the top.  They brown on top of the cheese and add a little crunchy texture.  My kids always beg for the piece with extra crunchies.  You must try.

We loved this!  It goes together easily and uses simple ingredients that are easily found.  While this was in the oven I tossed a quick salad and dinner was ready in no time. This is a great basic "Mexican" recipe that can be tweaked to suit individual tastes and still come out amazing.   I chose to substitute red enchilada sauce for the taco sauce because of the flavor differences and also added pepper jack and queso cheeses as well.  Be sure to give this time to set up after removing from the oven, just like lasagna. It's easier to serve and makes a better presentation.  This is a winner!

This was very good! Didn't have green chili peppers, so I added some red pepper flakes.  Didn't have taco sauce but I added  taco seasoning to the ground beef. I toasted the tortillas in a frying pan first to make them crispy before layering. Used Tex Mex cheese blend. Served topped with sour cream, guacamole, lettuce and tomatoes ... Yum.....Will make again!

Love this for a make ahead and freeze meal for a few or many.  I have made it multiple times now. I tend to hold back 1/2 cup of the refried beans to "frost" the tortillas up as I layer them.

It was great it tasted amazing and so easy to make all I did was take out the olives (to my families liking) and cut back on the beans with only 1 can because it seemed like a lot  I would recommend that if your using a smaller pan put a baking sheet underneath because it may overflow but all in all this was a great recipe and I would definitely recommend it

Was really good. Left out the chilis because I have kids.  I also only had 4 ounces taco sauce so I used salsa to get to 16 ounces.  Kids loved it.  Split the recipe in two pans and froze one before baking.  Was just the right amount for our family of 4.

I have made this recipe too many times throughout the years.
The only changes I made is not add olives (i hate olives). When I brown the meat I add packet of taco seasoning without water before I add the onions and garlic. I also uses colby jack cheese. For extra kick I add extra can of green chile or I use hot taco sauce. This has been my go to recipe for a long time now, most people thought this was my own creation lol...

Delicious! I took the advice of some others and put taco seasoning [I chose hot and spicy] right into the ground beef while simmering. I cooked the onions and fresh garlic for about 10 minutes and then added the ground beef to brown. I used 2 tortillas per layer, 3 layers per 9" aluminum pie dish. I put one in the freezer for another time. So good!!

This is great!! My husband and 2/4 of my kids agree. Added one packet of taco seasoning without water to the meat. Used medium Pace salsa instead of taco sauce. Only had one can of refried beans on hand. Used Mexican cheese instead of Colby. I eyeballed the cheese. I'll measure to use less next time. I spread it across two 2qt casserole (square) pans. Used two tortillas per layer, and only two tortilla layers. May try to thin out the meat layers in order to have three layers of everything next time, but it was great anyway! I ate mine with some lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream. Delicious.

Hubby loved this meal!  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and toasted the tortillas and spread the refried beans on one side of them before assembly.  I used Mrs Dash taco seasoning, 1 tbsp. tapioca flour, and a little water to the meat/tomato mixture and simmered for 20 min.  Also sprinkled  roasted sweet corn after each meat layer which complimented the spices and heat from the chiles.  Served with homemade guac and salsa on the side. Yummy!

A new favorite for my kids and it even made the birthday dinner list!  I only had one pound of ground meat, a smaller  jar of taco sauce and smaller fajita style tortillas.  I threw it all together overlapping two tortillas  and it turned out great!  Really easy and lots of flavor

I followed the recipe as written. I just added a little cumin , turmeric, black pepper, and red pepper.. I used a 9x13 dish and it was very full, but it fit. I also used a large pot instead of a skillet.Next time I'm going to replace one can of refried beans with a can of black beans for texture. I baked it uncovered , it  was not soggy .  It was very good. Thank you for the recipe!

It was a good weekday recipe. Quick and easy. Still have some left for tomorrows  lunch. I would make it again.
p.s. I did make a change, instead of refried beans, I used a can of black beans. They are healthier and tastier.

This was so darned good! Like several other reviewers suggested, I definitely had to add (1/2 tsp) kosher salt and (1/4 tsp) ground pepper while browning the meat for an all-around balanced flavor. I halved this recipe, as there were only four of us that night, but ended up with enough leftovers for five people the next night! I served with shredded lettuce and halved cherry tomatoes on the side. I also included sour cream "laced with" a bit of adobe sauce to add a bit more zing for an amazing topping! Great "pie"!! 
P.s. I feel the salt and pepper is a must in most of my savory cooking, but I know some people can't/don't eat salt...so  I still give this recipe 5 stars because to me those two staple ingredients are just a given tweak ;) Thanks for recipe!!

Recipe was easy to follow, a little rich but it turned out pretty good. I did however make my own taco seasoning to control the amount of salt and spice. Other than that the recipe is a good one for a filling meal all in one.

I agree about the taco seasoning and the beans maybe being served on the side.  It was good but I will put a few of my own spins on it next time!

I've made this dish several times everyone loves it. Over time I've started adding a can of diced jalapeños just to spice up a little. I'm not a great cook but when I make this people think I am.

I made this recipe last night and it was a big hit. The only changes I made was the tomatoes. I used diced tomatoes no green chilies to calm down the heat a little. I also put them in to pie plates 1 to eat and 1 to freeze for later. Thanks

I made this for a party last night and it was a huge hit.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and layered the refried beans on top of the beef, with layers of: beef, refried beans, cheese, 2 layers of burrito style (thicker) tortilla shells, and then repeated this as the directions noted.  I placed it in a deep stoneware 9x13 pan and it filled it nearly to the top.  I had expected to bring home most of it from the party as it was a small gathering with other food but I was wrong!

We had brought home food from our favorite Mexican restaurant and the family meal came with like 4 cups of refried beans. I decided I needed to find a recipe that used refried beans and I am happy to say that I found a good one! I only had a 1/2 cup of taco sauce, so I decided to add 2 tablespoons of taco mix to make sure there was enough flavor. My husband and son who don't care for refried beans really liked the dish.

I've made this twice in two weeks! My husband and his friends loved it!  I did add a couple of different things though . I diced up two fresh jalapeños and did Monteray jack cheese and cheddar .  Spiced it up with a little cumin as well. Then when it was done I topped plates individually with guacamole, sour cream, and fresh diced tomatoes! This is definitely an added staple to our household!

I halved the recipe for our family of three. I made it but simplified it a little to suit ingredients on hand. I used a packet of taco sauce from a kit and added salsa to the rest of the meat mixture. I also added cumin and paprika to the meat while browning. I used a mix of mozzarella and cheddar for the cheese. I took the advice of others and smeared the beans on tortillas and I baked it in a brownie pan. Served with lettuce and sour cream with a side of corn. Yum!

This is a crowd pleaser, I made a few changes....
I browned the beef with onion and garlic in frying pan, the remainder of ingredients combined in large saucepan.  I also used two jars of salsa.  Once beef was browned, I added the mixture to the saucepan.  This made it much easier when layering.  Double the tortilla layer.

I made this recipe but did change some things to what I had on hand.  I used canned beef,  mixed in taco seasoning,  cooked diced onion, minced garlic, refried beans and layered enchilada sauce, tortilla and meat mixture.  I didn't measure anything, but it was good.  My kids didn't like the onion so I will omit them next time, but otherwise this was a hit.

I thought this was pretty good, but definitely not better than my homemade enchiladas. So, for about the same effort, and ingredients, I probably won't make again because it wasn't different enough, and since it wasn't phenomenal, will just stick with my enchiladas.

I liked this! I cut the recipe in half and baked in a 9x13 casserole dish. I think the original recipe would be too much food unless you're feeding a large family. I took other commenters' advice and added taco seasoning and I'm really glad I did! I also subbed chunky medium salsa for the taco sauce, and I added in some chopped jalapenos and about a cup of corn. I would make this again with those substitutions.

I've made this recipe several times. I changed some of the ingredients to suit our diet, and I took the advice of someone else and separated the beans from the meat. Even though I halve the ingredients, it makes a lot. I use my food saver to freeze individual portions or  a meal for two. It freezes really well!

Good recipe but I prefer more spice. I added more heat by mixing fresh, diced jalapenos while cooking the meat mixture and added cayenne pepper. So for me, this is a good recipe but fell short on flavor based on my flavor palette.

I did some healthier choices by adding no salt black beans and instead of Taco sauce I added a roasted salsa. It turned out fantastic. I also used corn tortillas instead of flour. I think it is almost gluten free.

Did a few of the changes other suggested and did tone down the heat a little bit.  Also took others advise and put the refried beans on the bottom side of doubled up large tortilla's to keep it less sloppy.  Put sour cream, lettuce shreds and tomato pieces on top.  Loved it and will make often.

I added an envelope of taco seasoning to the meat, and used corn tortillas rather than flour (a little less fat). Otherwise this recipe is just fine. It is certainly a prodigious recipe, requiring a substantial casserole dish. I've attached a photo taken before putting it into the oven.

Excellent recipe.  I substituted toasted corn tortillas for the flour tortillas.  The flour ones got too gummy for my taste.  Otherwise, everything else stayed the same.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I love this kind of recipe. Tasty,  hearty and feeds a lot! Ok, I was  a little concerned about the flour tortillas since they have so little flavor compared to the corn ones. Also after reading the comment about using several tortillas for thicker layers I decided to not use tortillas at all. Instead I used a bag of Fritos, crunched them while still in the bag then layered them instead. They absorb lots of liquid and provide a great corn flavor.

I'm not a spicy person so I didn't add the green chilies. I did double up the tortillas and it turned out amazing. Next time I'm going to add either Mexican rice or white rice with cilantro to the layering.

So good! I left out the olives because I don't like olives. And left out the individual green chilis to keep the spiciness down. So with the one can of tomatoes/green chilis (I used Rotel) it was actually not spicy at all. I think next time I may add the extra green chilis because we like spicy here. Paired it with a salad of romaine and strawberries. Fantastic!

I added a packet of taco seasoning to the beef (just seasoning, no water) and even then it was not spicy at all! Even my 5 year old liked it!

I have made this a couple of times now, and it's been a hit at my house.   The first time, I followed the recipe except (based on the reviews..) I used 2 tortillas thick per layer and spread the refried beans on those tortillas instead of mixing it in the meat mixture.  The second time, I followed that technique again, and I also added taco seasoning to the meat while cooking.   Second version wins!   It was really good.   Both times, I cooked half and froze half.   The frozen ones baked up just fine and it was a pleasure to have something ready to go in the freezer for busy days.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this. I used taco seasoned ground turkey instead of beef but I sort of wish I used non seasoned so we could really taste all the other flavors. We don't like olives so I didn't add those and I used cheddar jack cheese. Also I only ended up using 10 tortillas.

This was very tasty!  I halved it and it was plenty for our family of four.  Stick to the original recipe if you have a larger group to feed.  I also used a round cake pan and it fit the tortillas perfectly.  Great family dish!

I just made this for the first time last night, and we enjoyed it very much. I made some changes that I think improved it. I followed the suggestions of a few reviewers -- I used 2 flour tortillas between the layers, AND I pan-fried them (dry in a non-stick skillet). I also spread the refried beans on the bottom of the lower tortilla instead of adding them to the meat mixture. I also added a small can of whole kernel corn to the meat mixture. My 12-year-old dislikes chunks of tomato, so I used a smooth picante sauce in place of the diced tomato, and I used a can of tomato sauce, + a tsp each of cumin and chili powder in place of the taco sauce, because commercial taco sauce has way too much sodium & is way too chemical-y for me. Oh, and I also added a tsp each of cinnamon and unsweetened cocoa, which made it really rich, and deepened the flavor. 

I used a pound & a half of ground beef & cooked the whole thing in a large souffle dish. It towered above the sides, so I placed it on a cookie sheet before putting it in the oven, and I'm really glad I did. Cooking was a little messy and cutting it was uber-messy. It oozed all over the place, but I saved the overflow & I'm eating it on a leftover baked potato for lunch today. This was a delicious dish, and I will certainly make it again (with my modifications).

so good!  I used what I had.  a mix of sautéed 1 lb.ground chicken, onions, garlic, drained black beans, drained yellow corn, drained and squeezed frozen spinach, taco seasoning, cumin, salt and pepper, tomato sauce, chopped fresh tomatoes, and cooked rice, all sautéed in olive oil.  I layered 2 flour burritos at a time, with mixture and shredded mozzarella cheese on top for 3 layers in a 9x13 pan.  baked at 350 for 30 min.

Whoa, this is delicious!  I made a couple of substitutions because I didn't want to run to the store.  I used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce and salsa instead of diced tomatoes.  I didn't have green peppers so I picked a variety of peppers from my garden.  I took the advice from other reviews and spread the refried beans onto the tortillas.  I ended up using fewer tortillas than the recipe called for and more cheese, just because I had it.  Thanks KATHIMC for the tasty recipe!!

This one is really great. We think it is better than the World's Best Lasagna! Spicy food. And since my boyfriend loves spicy food, I secretly added a little habanero pepper. And he passed that test again lol.

My family loved this dish. I made the dish per recipe except used mild salsa instead of taco sauce. I also followed recommendation of others and put beans on the tortillas instead of mixing with meat.  I was feeding my husband and two teenage guys, and the recipe size was perfect.  They requested I add it to our regular dinner rotation.

This was great, I did make a few changes.  I layered it like a lasagna in a 9x13 pan, using a larger tortilla because this makes a large mixture.  I didn't have just green chilies so I used a generic rotel and I added two packets of taco seasoning.  Oh I didn't have taco sauce so I used salsa.  I would say this feeds 8-10 we are a family of 4 that had seconds and we will be having leftovers tonight.  I am sure it will be even better the second time.  It can be easily halved to 2 9x9 pans and freeze one for later.  It's a great freezer meal in general.

Absolutely will be making AGAIN!
This meal is wonderfully flavorful!  I made it with no additions or alterations except for  I accidentally misread ingredient list and only used 8 oz taco sauce. Next time I will use the required amount.  I drained all ingredients that had liquid (except for taco sauce) because of other reviews indicating it was soggy.  When it came out of the oven it was perfect and not even slightly soggy.  This dish  was an easy recipe to make.  It would be extremely simple to divide in half as you make it and freeze.  It makes a ton!  As another reviewer stated, be sure to use an extra large skillet or a dutch oven.  It makes stirring easier.  My husband kept raving about how good it was and how tasty. He had three helpings.  We will keep this in our "favorites" and I plan to make it frequently.

I'm sure I would have liked this recipe as is, but I made changes due to what I had on hand and because my husband prefers corn over flour tortillas. I too added taco seasoning, about half a packet. I used chili beans instead of refried beans cause that's what I had in the cabinet. Used corn tortillas instead of flour.  I think because I didn't use refried beans the mix wasn't as thick as it would've been, so I added some flour after it simmered to thicken it up. My family enjoyed it very much.

Absolutely loved this. We added Tostitos Scoops on top and a layer of cheese - sooo good. ALso, we added Taco Sauce from Archer Farms (Target) to the meat. I can't wait to make it again...

This was delicious. Need to find a way to give it some crunch though. Especially re-heated the tortillas tend to get soggy. Very tasty dish though. Don't be afraid of the heat!

Latino style Lasagna with a kick! Family loved it, my picky hubby had seconds and he doesn't even like "Mexican"style food. saving it to my recipe box to make again. The only thing I did differently from the recipe was that I added a layer of sour cream that I combined with taco seasoning and cheese. I also added taco seasoning to the ground beef and didn't drain the grease. I doubled layered the corn tortillas as another reviewer suggested. Thanks! Great recipe! (-:

I made this with one pound ground beef and one pound ground turkey to lighten up the meat a bit.  I also added taco seasoning and used chunky salsa instead of  taco sauce.  I cooked the meat for a while, to cook out most of the liquid.  I did not want my dish to be too soggy.  I used another reviewers advice and layered two layers of flour tortillas, to help avoid any sogginess.  I layered just like a lasagne (meat, two layers tortillas, thin layer of refried beans, then cheese).  This turned out wonderful , everyone loved it and I can not wait to make again!

Delicious.  I halved the recipe and used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce because I wanted it to be thicker.  Next time I will use the thickest sauce I can find or add tomato paste.  I didn't have any refried beans so I pureed some black bean soup.  It was ok, but probably would have been better with the thicker beans.

This made a delicious burrito sauce that, instead of placing it in the pan as a lasagna, I used as a filling for burritos.  The kids loved it and it made enough to fill 16 burrito sized flour tortillas.  It also allowed me to add the cheese, lettuce, and avocados to the burrito shells as they were stuffed.

Super delicious-- and even better the next day!

Next time around  I think I might add jalapenos or something else to spice it up a little more. I like spicy, and although this was good, the spice wasn't enough for me.

As happywife05 said, you should also use more tortillas per layer. The beans and sauce do tend to soak into the tortillas and cause it to have a very soft and saturated texture.

We enjoyed this pie.  However, I did not use the chili peppers as I don't enjoy hot flavored food, so I just added green peppers.  I used cheddar cheese and topped it with some mozzarella cheese.  Next time I would add some red pepper flakes to give it a little spice.

This was very tasty.  Everyone at Sabbath dinner loved it.  I made it with 1 lb of ground beef and 1 lb of ground turkey.  I also added homemade taco seasoning and hot Arriba salsa instead of Taco sauce.  Took the advice of others and cooked tortillas in skillet first and made sure to overlap in casserole.  Thanks for a great base to a delicious meal.

This was easy and good!  I added some taco seasoning to my beef as I browned it.  This makes a good sized dish for a family.   Served it with sour cream, salsa and guac!  Yummy!

Made it and family loved it. I made the mistake of draining the green chilies and the Rotel. Became a little too thick, so I added a little bit of chicken stock . Turned out great!!

I cooked the pie in an  EZ Foil 13×9 cake pan, I subbed the ground bf with ground tky and I used 16oz's of Colby instead of 9. When using more chz I suggest adding more taco sauce when combining mixture.

This is very easy to make and I did follow the recipe as it was written but, did add bell peppers. However, I did not like it very much.  There is something missing that I can't put my finger on.  Maybe it was the Taco Sauce I used. I had never cooked with it before and may try a different from scratch recipe. If that doesn't improve the taste, I will not be making it again.

So easy and so good!  I used ground turkey in place of beef, and added black beans to it also!!  As usual, I made too much for a house of 2 so I took it to the salon to share and it was a HUGE hit!!

This has got to be the easiest recipe I have ever made. It was absolutely delicious! The only thing I added was 1 teaspoon of cumin. I also used ground sirloin (lower in fat), low carb tortillas, and fat free refried beans. My family gave me a big thumbs up! Needless to say I'm keeping this recipe!!!??

I made this recipe according to KathiMC's instructions, with 3 exceptions:  I cut the recipe in half to match our family of 4's usual appetite, therefore making two burrito pies of 6" diameter.  Second, I added 16 oz of salsa to the meat sauce, along with the taco sauce.  Third, I kept meat sauce and beans separate as suggested by another  reviewer.  I followed the suggestion of spreading the refried beans on the bottom of each tortilla layer.  That said, I was delighted by my family's enjoyment of this recipe!  I got complements when the kids got home from school and smelled the kitchen aroma while the  burrito pies were baking!  Not a drop was left on anyone's plate.  My family gave this an "8 thumbs" rating.  I will definitely be making this recipe again soon!  Thanks for sharing, KathiMC!

I don't care for olives so they were not a part of the meal. Was excellent. I like really spicy so next time I think I'll double up on the sliced chilies.

I liked the sauce/filling ingredients but would suggest leaving out the tortillas.  They do nothing to add crunch as they are just soggy. They do not add any flavor either. Better to use some type of Frito or tortilla chips on the side. Interesting as a dip with chips also.

I followed the reviews and doubled up on the tortillas so they would not be soggy. However they were still a little gummy. If I make this again I may try to use a crispy tostada shell. However the flavors were very tasty!

This was delicious! And made SO MUCH FOOD. I only changed it by adding some garlic salt, pepper, cumin, and oregano to the meat mixture. Either use a huge deep skillet or just a nonstick soup pot to mix the beef and beans. I topped it with green onions. Next time I'll buy salsa to put on top as well.

At first I wasn't sure I liked it - it was almost too beany (I made a half version of the recipe for our family of 2) I think next time I will separate the beans from the meat by spreading the tortilla's with the beans as one reviewer suggested.  But left overs the next day were excellent and we ended up eating and really enjoying the whole pan. We served ours with extra salsa and sour cream.

Needs corn tortillas as opposed to flour-My husband and I didn't like gummy texture of flour tortillas. Very Large recipe. I ended up making one, and freezing 2 as suggested by another reader. Otherwise tasty.

Loved this! I changed a couple of things tho, instead of 2lbs of ground beef i used 1lb ground beef and 1lb ground pork.  I also added refried beans along with a can of black beans. The taco sauce wasnt spicy enough, therefore added cayenne pepper to the mix. My hubby and his friend loved it!

With minimal changes (suggestions from other comments), this is a FANTASTIC dish! I've made it twice now, plan on continuing making it and have suggested it to friends. 5 stars all day!!

Made this for my Fam and it was a instant fav. They liked it so much they wanted me to make it again for dinner the next night. Only thing I recommend using taco seasoning for the meat. Also decided to cut up some avocados and use as a topping w the shredded lettuce and chopped tomatoes.

I made this as directed due to that only being fair the first time and rating it. It was great! But I have to say the lettuce and tomato on the side I served with it really adds a lot! It had really good flavor and was easy to make! Be aware....it makes a bunch, call your friends and neighbors! Will make this again!

This is great, although I followed suggestions of many other reviewers here (two layers of tortillas, taco seasoning, etc.).  I've made many times to rave reviews.

It was very delicious and simple to make. You will be sure to want seconds. It is honestly too good for words. One thing I did differently was add the tomatoes as a topping instead of sautéing it. Mmmmm...

This is a simple recipe. I don't think you could mess it up. I used black beans instead of refried and put  some jalapeños on the top.

It was good. I made a smaller portion of it though. I used a round pan about the same size of the tortillas, so I just layered them one on top of the other using only 5 tortillas. I was interested in this recipe because I had made something similar to it, it was one of the Old El Paso kits. I thought it was pretty much the same thing just with more to it, but I didn't realize it was supposed to be more like a lasagna type dish. I didn't realize this until I was making it, and I then realized that's why there was so much of each ingredient. Either way this turned out great and I'd definitely make it again, just with half of the ingredients.

I have made this a few times.  I would drain the fat after cooking beef.  It's too fatty if you don't.  I added fresh tomatoes once and it made it even better.

One recipe that my picky family liked...  However, I did not use rotel.  I added the green chilies and then just added a can of diced tomatoes.  It was still spicy enough.  I think the recipe could call for more cheese and maybe 1/2 can less of refried beans.

I felt this was missing something but I'm not sure what.  I do think it tasted better reheated in the microwave than when freshly prepared.

It was pretty good! I had to make some changes based off what I had on hand. I used chunky salsa so I didn't add in the can of Rotel. I also used a can of chili beans instead of refried. I also had to use some sliced jalapeño cheese along with some shredded pepper jack. My son and my mother really liked it!

Delicious even with all low or fat-free, and gluten-free ingredients.

For gluten-free, use corn tortillas.

I made this for dinner tonight, and the chorus of "mmmmmm, mmmm, mmmmmmmmm" coming from around the table was almost comical.  It made me so happy that something so simple was being enjoyed so much!  The only thing I added was a can of rinsed black beans.  Outstanding!  It made enough for me to serve half and freeze the other half for a quick meal on a busy night.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Actually tasted even better the next day. I follwed the recipe almost exactly.....I had only  1 can of refried beans - mixed those in the beef mixture and spread a can of ranch style beans because that was what I had on hand. Didn't feel dish was as spicy as expected from the description. Served with salsa and sour cream. Great flavor, will spice it up next time and maybe add a little more cheese.  This makes a very full 13x9 pan. Thanks!

This was yummy! I made a few changes too. No olives.  I also added the homemade taco seasoning from all recipes to the meat mixture when it was simmering. Didn't add the refried beans to the meat mixture. I spread it on each tortilla and added the meat on top.  I also added black beans and corn before topping with cheese on each layer. Came out great! Will make again!

Kids and hubby loved it! I added the taco seasoning to the meat, and didn't add the black olives. I separated it into two containers, had one that night and put the other in the freezer for another meal. Freezer version came out perfect, will make again and do the same.

Definitley like the earlier review changes as well. I too added taco mix to the beef mixture and didn't add the refried beans.  I only added about 1/4 of the taco sauce to the simmering mix. Also put the refried beans on the bottom of each soft shell. Layered as described and also spooned a bit of the remaining taco sauce on each layer after the cheese. No where near 12 layers. Turned out great and gone!!

Great recipe! I halved the recipe and added a few teaspoons of taco seasoning.  I was surprised the flour tortillas stayed intact and loved the refried beans.  Will definitely make again.

Made this for the kids I babysit ( ages 5-13) they all loved it - even the picky one.  Don't you just love it ( not) when someone gives  a recipe a less than 5 stars and then tells you all the changes they made - crazy.  I made it with the one suggestion of placing 2 tortillas per layer.  It came out fantastic!!!!
Update:  I recently made this with shredded chicken - better yet!!

This recipe was very good.   I used enchilada sauce instead of tomatoes and chili's because my husband is very picky, but the 4 boys I feed daily loved it, including my Husband. This will be added to my recipe rotation for sure!!

This recipe was awesome.  I did change a few things my family doesn't like hot spicy foods.  I used 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb of turkey, trying to cut back on red meat intake in my house.  I didn't utilize the green chili peppers or tomatoes,my family is pretty basic.  I add spinach to make the meal a little healthier and used Mexican cheese. It turned out great, this recipe is a KEEPER.  Thanks

This was a great recipe. The only thing I added was Spanish rice to the mixture. I didn't use some of the spices or can tomatoes since my husband and son are picky. the rest I followed. I didn't need to add more tortilla' s like some had said. We really enjoyed it. I will be making again.

I did not follow this recipe word for word..but my goodness was it good! I had to cook my meat the day prior to prevent it from going bad so I did not cook anything in with the meat other than a packet of taco seasoning. I used black beans instead of the ones suggested and I did not use any chilies because I am not a bug fan of spicy stuff. I layered it salsa, tortillas, (2 for each layer) meat, more salsa, olives, black beans, then cheese. It did not look very appealing on our plates but it sure did taste good! :)

We ended up scooping it into hard (heated) taco shells and topping with salsa and sour cream.

Excellent! I used two 9" cake pans instead of a 4 qt casserole so 2 lbs of ground beef was too much. I used 1-1/2 lbs instead but did not cut back on the other ingredients. I oiled the pan bottoms a bit, put 3 tortillas on the bottom, then the meat mix, shredded cheese, 3 tortillas, meat mix and topped with shredded cheese. One pan was plenty for 2 people, surely 3 if there's a side dish or a big salad. Thank you KathiMC!

Man, I'm two for two this week.  This was a really good meal.  Very filling.  I did as others stated and put the beans on the tortillas.  I only used 1.5 pounds of ground beef and I didn't have an abundance.  I cut all the ingredients back a bit but really just eyed it.  It was really good and this is truly a recipe that you could probably play with.  I'd think I'll throw some corn and black beans in it next time.  Truly good base recipe that you can make all sorts of changes to, to make it to your family's liking!  Thanks!

it came out great the first time I made it.  I left out the olives and toned down the heat. I found some Kroger Classic taco cooking sauce (mild) and it was excellent! Much better than the powder stuff.

Try this recipe with Corn Tortillas for a GLUTEN FREE alternative. I use fresh serranos from the garden for a fresh pop.  I added cayenne and GF taco seasoning.  We like it hot.  Also, I use a 6 quart dutch oven and bake for about an hour.  I have also made it in a crock pot/slow cooker on low for 4 hours.  We garnish with avocado and sour cream with red pepper flakes for a pretty finish.

We loved this recipe. I only made half, using ground turkey for the beef. I didn't have any taco sauce, so I used taco seasoning. Also, left out the can of diced chilis to keep the heat down. Used corn tortillas and topped with Mexican Crema. Delicious!

This was really good! We used black beans instead of re-fried, and a fresh jalapeno instead of green chili, and a Mexican blend cheese. You can make it as spicy as you like. The flour tortillas were a little mushy so next time I might try crunchy corn tostada shells instead.

We LOVED this recipe. I switched it up a little but by adding taco seasong to the meat with a little water then adding the chili peppers, onions and garlic. I didn't use any tomatoes and didn't mix the beans in with the meat. I just spread the beans on the tortilla shells and then started layering. It was sooooooo good !

Delicious recipe.  Can be altered to your family's tastes.  I cut the tortillas to fit the pan and essentially used them like lasagna noodles.  I used spicy fat-free refried beans to coat the tortillas.  Served with fresh chopped tomatoes, olives, and pickled jalapeno slices.  Leftovers were great!

Delish!  I made this with corn tortillas instead of the flour, it seemed to have better flavor.  My kids ages 5-16 gobbled it up.

This is awesome and super fast and easy! I double the olives and use fresh salsa instead of the diced tomato w/green chili.  My husband asked my to make it for his 12 guy golf weekend and they now request it each year.

I cut the recipe in half and made a mild version since I'm the only person in my family to like spicy food. However, it was very delicious.

I was searching for Mexican theme ideas for Cinco De Mayo theme and found this recipe...
I didn’t use olives and skipped the can of diced chili peppers as I did not want it to be too spicy and the tomatoes already have them in it – it was perfect that way. I also put 3 tortillas between each layer which worked out well (someone else suggested more like that.
Great recipe!

Meh...
I was really excited about this recipe because my boyfriend is a HUGE taco fan and I'm not a huge fan of making them.
It was ok but a slight let down. We both refer to it as 'taco-mush' because even after doubling the tortilla layers it is just so mushy! Good flavor though (note-not great, but good)
Points for freezing well for reheating.
I think I will stick to my usual taco casserole recipe.

I followed the recipe with the only exception being I used mild enchilada sauce rather than taco sauce as that's what I had in the pantry.  This was delicious and the family loved it.  I served it with sour cream, additional black olives and sliced green onions.  Next time I may use less refried beans as they are not my family's favorite.  This makes a lot and goes a long way.  Will definitely make again!

REALLY GOOD!!!I also made some changes...I too used taco seasoning instead of taco sauce and added black beans, and just to make me feel like I wasn't cooking something totally unhealthy I threw in a layer of spinach! Two dachshunds are dying to try it too!

Awesome meal. I added taco seasoning instead of salsa. My family loved it.

The filling tasted fine, but the flour tortillas got  mushy. I never would have made it if so many people hadn't raved about how great it was.

This recipe was easy and really good.  
I used half of all ingredients and it filled a 11X8 pan. I served 3 people with it and had a lot left over! 

I utilized the suggestions from other posts when it came to the beans.  I layered beans in a tortilla and then put another tortilla on top.  Then, I slathered on another layer on the tortilla piece that I laid down on the meat mix.  It truly did taste like a Mexican pizza at Taco Bell!

I prepared the meat filling in my 5.5 Le Creuset French Oven. I seasoned the meat with chili powder, garlic salt and ground pepper. I used mild taco sauce, fat free refried beans, and four whole wheat flour tortillas for each tortilla layer (total of 8 tortillas). This was baked in a 9X13 foil pan. I was able to fit most of the meat filling in that pan. I only had about 1 cup of filling leftover. Once ready to serve, I topped with fat free plain Greek yogurt (instead of sour cream) and served with a side salad. This makes about 8 adult sized servings. I would serve with tortilla chips and guacamole. Very easy and tasty recipe.

instantly  now in my regular rotation of meals..  we don't like really spicy food,  so we just omitted the chilI peppers,  olives,  and made sure the taco sauce and canned tomatoes were mild.  very easy to make. I mixed all ingredients together  even  sour cream.. and chopped up s ome fresh cilantro,  then sprinkled lightly over the cheese before doing the next layer.  delicious!  even the kids ate it.

The only change I would make is that I would use enchilada sauce in place of the taco sauce. OR like many others I would season the meat with taco seasoning to achieve more of a taco flavor. The taco sauce did not do the job on its own. All in all, delicious & quick meal.

First and foremost - the amounts of ingredients would not even fit in a the pan.  Secondly - it was bland mush. Even the consistency made it inedible

This was a huge hit with the family.  My wife is not a big fan of spicy food, so I toned it down a bit by cutting out the green chiles and using a jar of Ortega mild taco sauce.  Left the Rotel in though for a little zip.  Followed others' advice and spread refried beans on tortillas instead of mixing in with meat mixture.  Otherwise, followed the recipe and it was muy excellente!!  Made it in a 9x13 glass pan and it could have used a little more meat for my liking.  Maybe a half pound or so.  It was just as good left over two days later, so no need to freeze any.

I like to make the recipes as the person posts them so people know my rating is based on what was suggested. This was fantastic! It was easy to make and tasted just as great as leftovers. It makes a lot, which is why we had leftovers. When my 2 boys are home from college, this will be made in a large rectangular baking pan for the 4 of us and it will be perfect since they eat alot! This time, my husband and I enjoyed it for 2 meals AND I send over enough for my parents to enjoy. Thanks for the great meal!

Great recipe! My family loved it. I used ground turkey instead of beef, and substituted green enchilada sauce for taco sauce. Next time I will add corn and cilantro. Garnishing with green onions, sour cream, tomatoes and avocados makes a tasty and healthy meal. I also split the recipe into two pans, as it was huge. Also, don't forget the tortilla chips. I used scoops, and my 16-year-old inhaled it Kirby-style!

Excellent meal.  Very popular with the family.  Substitutions: Added chili powder and cumin, 1 can jalapeno refried beans, added tomatoes, lettuce, olives and sour cream as fresh/cold toppings.  Chipotle tabasco sauce for added heat and flavor.  Cold rice pudding for dessert.  I'm stuffed.

This dish was really good. I followed the suggestion of some other reviewers and didn't mix the beans with the meat mixture. I spread the beans over the bottom of the tortillas as I layered to create a "buffer", and added onion powder, cinnamon, cumin and lots of chili powder to the ground beef since I didn't have ready-made taco seasoning on hand. It turned out great! Definitely adding this to my short list of go-to dinners. Like some other reviewers said, the recipe does make a lot, so plan on using more cheese than the recipe indicates. I went through 1 8-oz bag and got halfway through another one before I finished assembling.

Amazing and easy! I used 3 tortillas thick per layer as suggested, and it was perfect. I also used a huge electric skillet... this dish is massive! I let simmer in skillet for a little over 30 mins and baked for about 25. I plan to use the extra meat combination for nachos! This dish is really tasty and so simple. Must try!

Easy to make. I used one can of refried beans and one can of black whole beans to give it some texture. I also used a chunky salsa instead of a taco sauce..again to add texture and a bolder flavor. Have made this with both ground beef and ground turkey. Both were  good and both I have been asked to make again. Next time I will use a taco seasoning on the meat to add flavor.

I made this for my two very picky eaters during the work week and it was great! I did have enough to freeze later but as a single working mom that's a bonus! My kids normally hate beans but if you make it according to the recipe they can't tell its in there!

This is really good! Definitely a keeper! The only thing I will change is to reduce the ground beef next time. This was a little on the "meaty" side for me, but hubby will love it that way!

Made it with half the beef and it's AWESOME!!

I found that the mix made before putting into the pan is good for anything, like a dip with chips or just regular burritos. Make a big pot of it for a lot of people and let them decide what they want to do with it.

This was hit with my family and friends. The only adjustment I made was I used only 1 can of refried beans and a smaller jar of taco sauce.  It was delish with sour cream on top! Will definitely be making it again!

Very Good!  It was very similar to Rachal Ray's Mexican lasagna but this one has some refried beans.  Double the tortilla layers as some reviews recommended.  I personally may like less meat mixture in between each layer...

I've made this recipe about 3 times; the first two as written and the third with a couple of adjustments (hence 4 stars instead of 5).  Now I use 2-3 tortillas per layer (depending on meat consistency) and diced tomatoes with cilantro (instead of tomatoes with the green chili peppers). It scaled the heat down a notch and added a small amount of extra flavor.

Adults and kids all loved it. Had leftovers for a few days and was still good. I used a mix of mozzarella and cheddar cheese instead of Colby and it was delicious.

I loved this recipe!  The only thing I changed was to put 2 tortillas per layer to avoid it getting soggy, as others had mentioned.  I didn't have the right cheese, so I used a mixed pepper shredded cheese, which combined with medium taco sauce and original rotel made it a little to spicy.  Next time I will just use the recommended cheese.  I topped with sour cream and it was awesome!

I love this recipe, all I change to the original recipe is add taco seasoning and some chopped jalapenos. A big plus, it makes a huge batch so I freeze one pie for a busy night.

Made this recipe for YEARS.  Always called it a lazy burrito.  Only main differences is I put a layer of tortillas on the bottom and the top and more cheese on top. The top cheese gets crusty and is my favorite part. Kids used to always show up when I made it. Even better the next day.

This is a great recipe to build from. I added more seasoning; 
1-2tbs cumin
1-2tbs chili powder
1 tbs oregano
1 tsp cayenne pepper
I also tore my tortillas (to make serving easier)
I added tortilla chips (yummy, crunchy texture)
My kids rated this 5 stars!

Five stars! I halved the recipe since it's just me and my husband. I still thought we would have plenty of leftovers, but he ate half the pan! I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and added to it half a packet of taco seasoning; not as many tortillas; and not as much cheese. I baked it in a 8x8 inch glass dish. It was super flavorful and filling. This one's going in the rotation!

I changed some things with the recipe also. I used one can of refried beans and one can of dark red kidney beans. I seasoned the meat with cumin, garlic, chili powder and oregano. It turned out delicious!

This recipe was OK, but would have been much better with corn tortillas.  The flour tortillas went soggy, which ruined it for me.  It was also WAY too much ground beef for me.  If I made this recipe again, I would cut the meat in half and substitute ingredients like corn, kidney beans,  maybe double the diced tomatoes.  I would like it much better if it wasn't so heavy.

Overall a great, easy comfort food recipe.  I agree with some of the reviews stating that it becomes a one-textured somewhat mushy meal.  If I was ordering this in a restaurant I could see this being disappointing because you expect a little more effort/creativity, but I don't mind this at home when we are looking for a easy, satisfying meal.  If I were going to try and jazz this up I would use ground chorizo instead of ground beef and keep the meat separate from everything else, then layer like so....bean mixture on bottom, tortillas, meat mixture and cheese, tortillas, bean mixture, tortillas, meat and cheese, tortillas, etc.  If you make this in a deep 9" pie dish you can just use burrito size tortilla's, 2 per layer and have a nicely layered lasagna effect.  We fit all the ingredients into one deep pie dish.

Wow this was delicious!! I will admit that my family does not like spicy food so I cut out the spicy stuff. I used mild taco sauce and diced tomatoes with lime and cilantro. It had just enough heat to warm our mouth but not enough to have a glass of milk handy. Thanks for a new meal to add to the weekly dinner menu!!

My husband and I loved this recipe. This is of particular note because my husband actually looked at me and said, "This is really good," whereas, his usually description for everything is "It's okay." 

I did as others recommended and spread the beans on the bottom side of the tortillas. I also used mild taco sauce and a mild can of tomatoes with green chilies. There was zero spice, so in the future I plan to use medium taco sauce and/or the original (rather than mild) diced tomatoes with green chilies. I also drained the liquid from the tomatoes and what I could from the can of green chilies. Before putting everything in the pan, I tasted the meat mixture, and did think it could use a little more flavor, so I liberally sprinkled garlic and onion powder and a just a bit of cumin then mixed well. I cooked it in a 9 X 13 cake pan in the order of meat, tortilla, cheese, meat, 2 layered tortillas, then meat (there wasn't much meat left at this point). During the last 10 minutes of cooking, I sprinkled cheese on top. Will definitely be making again.

My husband started making something similar to this a while ago from a recipe coming with a brand of Mexican food. My husband also does not like ‘beans’ - most any kind of beans. I also have vegetarian friends. I make ‘Spanish Rice’ which is basically rice made with tomatoes or salsa substituting half water called for making regular rice. I use Spanish rice instead of refried beans for my husband. For those who do not eat beef – I use the rice again as a layer with beans. Another thing I also do just for the variety of color, with my refried beans I add some black beans. I add taco seasoning to ground beef after it has been drained of fat, and add a little salsa or tomatoes.  I have never used more than one layer of tortilla shell – but will the next time to see how it works. I have used low calorie whole wheat tortilla shells that have held up very well. Depending on what I have on hand – I layer onions, sweet peppers, poblanos and other mild peppers – use smaller amounts of hotter peppers – accept for those who like hot – (husband DOES like hot!)

Made this for Cinco De Mayo pot luck at work and it was a hit.  It does make a lot but that just meant everyone was able to take some home.  Was not too spicy and seemed to appeal to everyone.  I also made one for my family and it was a huge hit there.  I did follow some people's advice and used the taco seasoning and cut down on the taco sauce.  It was so yummy, a definite recommend for everyone and will make it again very soon.

Use only 1.25 lb of chop meat, black beans instead of refried, one hot and spicy taco mix, hot green chilis (small can), less taco sauce than called for.  PREPARE ON MONDAY NIGHT SO CAN BE EATEN ALL WEEK

My roommate and I made this a few weeks ago, with a few changes. First, we halved the recipe and made it in a round casserole dish. Since she's vegetarian, we used soy crumbles instead of beef, and we added sauteed peppers and onions to the crumbles. Like some others suggested, I spread the refried beans onto the tortillas as I layered them. This was a good recipe; will definitely make again.

We loved this recipe - although I did not follow the recipe exact.  I omitted the refried beans, using black beans in place.  I cooked the hamburger, added 2 tsps taco seasoning and about 1/4 cup taco sauce and 1 can of diced tomatoes (draining the juice).  Allowed mixture to simmer about 25 minutes.  I placed two flour tortillas in the bottom of the casserole dish (used 12 inch flour tortillas that I folded in half and cut into 10 inch diameter to fit casserole dish), layered hamburger, shredded cheese, black beans, sliced olives and sliced jalapeno's, placed two more cut tortillas and repeated the shredded cheese, black beans, sliced olives and sliced jalapeno's 4 times.  Last layer I cut up the 'rings' (remains from the cut up flour tortillas), placed them on top and layered with remaining shredded cheese.  Baked for 30 minutes at 350.  It was GREAT !!  Will definitely fix again

This is one of my faves but I use shredded rotisserie chicken instead of the ground beef and I also spread the refried beans on the tortillas. I substitute sliced jalapenos instead of the olives & pepper jack/cheddar instead of colby cheese. DEEEELISH!

The only reason I haven't made this again is that it was so delicious, I found myself eating 2nd and 3rd helpings... When I make it again (and I will, seriously, SO DELICIOUS) I will likely split it into two pans and freeze one since it makes a lot.

This was a huge hit with my family!  I halved the recipe, used a packet of taco seasoning, simmered for 40 minutes for the flavors to meld. Layered with jalapeño refried beans (2 tortillas per layer) and  I used the shredded Mexican blend cheese.  I made it in a cake pan and it was the perfect size. Topped with green onions, sour cream, guacamole, tomatoes, and Cholula  hot sauce. My husband and daughter both raved about how good it was - definitely a keeper!!

This is such an easy, yummy way to serve all your Tex-Mex favorites in one dish! I have made this several times now and probably will for the rest of my life! I use soy crumbles instead of beef and salsa instead of taco sauce.  Also, I definitely agree with another reviewer to spread the bean mixture directly onto the bottom side of the tortillas . So good!

Delicious! The whole recipe is a bit much, so I either halve the recipe or make it in two dishes, then freeze one for later. Substituting ground turkey and low fat cheese doesn't change the great flavor.

So so tasty!  The only things I did different was simmer the meat and taco sauce for 30 minutes and then divided the whole mixture up into 2 9x11 pans, using only one middle layer of 4 burritos and adding all the cheese on top.  So...meat mixture, 4 burritos, meat mixture, then cheese.  I thought there would be too many green chiles, but that wasn't the case.  My husband and I really enjoyed this!  Thanks!

This was a very different recipe, it MAKES A LOT! I used round torts and layered them in a deep round casserole dish. I also layered the beans in between two torts instead of adding them to the mix.

I've made this recipe twice now. The second time was easier, naturally, as I knew what to expect. Results were consistent. This is a delicious dish that goes very well with a nice salad and garlic bread. And there's plenty for leftovers or freezing.

Excellent. I followed advice of others and did the following: 1. Use at least 2 or 3 tortillas thick per layer. Otherwise, it gets soggy and mushy. 2. Let the meat simmer with the sauce at least 30 minutes, otherwise it does not meld together.

I made this tonight for supper and it was amazing! I only used 2 tortillas a layer I think next time I would do 3 or 4.  Also I used black beans instead of black olives just a personal preference but they worked really well!  I will definitely make this again.

Yummmm!  Followed a few other reviews: added taco seasoning to meat (pack & a half), used salsa instead of taco sauce, doubled up the tortilla layers & made 2 8x8 pans...turned out fantastic!  Will be adding this recipe into my regular rotation.  Going to try ground turkey or chicken next time & I'm sure it will be just as good.

I used less meat & added a can of beans. My family is used to that, so it's fine for us! I don't keep taco sauce on hand, but have salsa. I still wanted the taco sauce consistency, so I just blended the salsa up for a second in my mini processor. I was lazy tonight & used dehydrated onion & garlic in the meat.  I used the suggestion of another reviewer & made the tortilla layers 2 thick so it wouldn't get too mushy. That was actually perfect & I don't think we would have liked it as much without the extra tortillas.  I also added a cup of sour cream to the meat mixture.  I have another recipe that is very similar to this one, & the sour cream gives it a good little twang!  I used rotel tomatoes & combined with the chili peppers & salsa it was quite spicy! I thought the perfect amount! It was very very good, a definite keeper recipe for us!

Good but I changed by only using 1 pound hamburger and 1 pound Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage. Gives it a little more bit. I also cut the juice in the can of tomatoes and added about the same amount in Old El Paso Enchallata Sause. I make a simular filling but try to keep it thicker, then lay out a tortilla and fill with 2 teaspoons grated cheese and 2 tablespoons of filling. Roll the tortilla and lay in casserole dish. Pour enchalla sause over all, bake for 15 minutes at 350 and sprinkle more grated cheese over top.

I found this to have some zip, but not spicy. I used a jalapeno instead of the canned chiles and canned black beans in place of the refried beans. Also used 2 cups of salsa instead of taco sauce. If you want super spicy I would recommend using at least 2 jalapenos or even a habanero. Otherwise, flavors rocked!!!

This is a fantastic recipe!!!  It makes my whole family happy & that is a tall order!!  I have made it as is & it is excellent!  I have also , in a pinch when I realized I didn't have tomatoes, substituted salsa for the tomatoes, peppers & onions & it works well that way also & it nearly tastes the same as the original recipe.  It is really great as leftovers or frozen into individual portions & frozen for another day.  THANKS for this great recipe KATHIMC!!!!

My husband loved this! I placed all ingredients in a 9-inch round pan and almost had a mess in my oven. I will definitely buy extra tortillas and use two round pans next time. I followed other reviewers' suggestions, spread the refried beans on the tortilla and placed it face down on the meat mixture. Also, we like our food spicy, so I added 1/4 cup of chopped Hatch green chilies to the meat mixture. I am excited to make this casserole again very soon and experiment with other suggested variations, or I may just stick with the recipe as is. It was delicious.

We loved this! Took advice of others and sprinkled taco seasoning on the meat and spread the beans on the tortillas. I put a double layer of tortillas in the middle layer. Make sure your layers of meat are thin so you have enough on top! Ours wasn't spicy at all, this is easily controlled by the heat of the taco sauce and Rotel that you use, etc...yummy ( :

pretty good! I've made this recipe twice now. As written, I give recipe is 4 stars. With the reviews and/or recommendations of fellow "AR'ers", the dish came out a 5 star. Before laying the tortilla layer, I lightly toasted the the tortillas on an open flame. This gave the tortillas more flavor and a tad bit of chewiness.  I also went ahead and made the tortilla layer 2 tortillas thick. Doing those two steps made a big difference in the quality of meal. *** Tip: do not simmer your meat-bean mixture to long or the pie will become dry after baking it!***

This wasn't hard to make at all and my family loved it.  Both daughters asked for the recipe.

However, I did make changes. Instead of using a 16 oz jar of taco sauce and adding green chili peppers and diced tomatoes, I just use a 24 oz jar of chunky salsa.  The other change was to use cheddar cheese instead of Colby because that's what we had in the frig.

I also took the advice of several people who commented on the recipe and did the following:
 - Let the meat, onions, garlic and salsa simmer for 30-40 minutes to better infuse the flavor in the meat
 - Don't add the refried beans to the meat.  Instead spread the refried beans on the tortillas before layering them in the pan
 - The recipe calls to lay a single layer flour tortillas.  I used several tortillas to form a thicker layer.

I used the meatless crumbles instead of ground beef and every thing else the same as the recipe.  It tasted very very good.

Mmmm!  I make this at least twice a month now.  I only use 1 pound of ground beef and 1 can of beans.  I omitted the black olives because we arent crazy about those and then added a can of enchilada sauce to the meat!  Dont be shy with the cheese either!  This is so good with sour cream, fresh tomatoes, and cilantro on top!

I thought this was okay.  It seemed to almost taste more like a dip, though. I ate it with chips and it seemed a little better like that.  It's worth trying and seeing if it goes well with your family's taste.  My  daughter actually liked it and she's hard to please at 13!! But I'm not sure if I'll make it again.

Other than using ground turkey rather than ground beef and doubling the tortillas as suggested, I made this recipe as written.  It was awesome!  I'll will make it again, for sure!

My whole family LOVES this meal.  I have also made it with shredded chicken breast for a healthier version we like mexican dishes with chicken in them.  It is even better.  The only other thing I add or change is minced fresh garlic cloves.  just personal preference. Serve with shredded lettuce, sour cream, diced tomato, avocado, YUMMY thanks for sharing

This ended up tasting more like glorified chili casserole than a burrito. It was ok, but not the fantastic dish I was expecting given all of the other reviews. I made exactly according to instructions - except substituted cheddar for colby cheese. I would not make this again.

We left out the peppers and onions and WOW. My family loved this! Im not a huge fan of flour tortillas but this was wonderful. My teenage son asked if I would make this every week! It's hard to find something to please everyone from adult to teen to 4 yr old but this did it!

This is such a beautiful dish -- I wanted so much to really love it, but it was just "okay" to us. I used 2 tortillas per layer, as per others' suggestion, and used Taco Seasoning 1 on this site, which I really like, BTW. I also added Queso Fresco cheese, sour cream, and cilantro.  I can't put my finger on why, maybe too many refried beans (and I LOVE bean burritos), but I simply did not enjoy it after 6 or 7 bites, so I probably won't be making this one again. *************
UPDATE ***** Okay, so I've changed this from 3 to 4 stars, after talking to my son who cooks and DID like it. He didn't know there were beans IN it, so that's not the issue. We decided that it probably had to much taco seasoning in it, which is not even in the original recipe. Next time I'll cut it in half.  More cayenne or pepper flakes and less chili powder, perhaps. I'm eating leftovers as I write, and I think it actually tastes BETTER today than a few days ago! Who'd a thought??

Exellent!!!  Hands down a winner.  I did not make in 4 qt casserole. Instead, I made several 3 layer versions in 9 in cake pans.  Then froze extras for later!  I did use 2 tortillas per layer and spread the refried beans over each layer.  Making this again tonight!

I made this last night for family and it was great!! Everyone raved about it and called it a "definite repeat" dinner. I made it exactly as the recipe called except for one small change (because my skillet was too small). Unfortunately, the beef, taco sace, chiles, and tomatoes filled my skilled to the brim, so I had to heat up the refried beans seperately. Then I layered it as beef mixture, cheese, then spread the beans on the tortilla and put it face down on the cheese. It worked out perfectly that way!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone! 5 stars!

Its a great dish, the only thing I did differently was swap 2 cans of black beans for the ground beef (I'm vegetarian). The dish does take a bit of time to prepare but you get leftovers for the next few days so for me it was worth the time.  I didn't double the tortillas when layering, and it didn't end up soggy.  Thanks for the recipe, I'll be using it often

First off I halved this recipe because halving it still took up an 8x11 baking pan. Except I used a whole 4 oz can sliced black olives. Instead of the diced tomatoes I used 1 large fresh tomato chopped up because that's what I had on hand. I used an 8 oz bottle Ortega hot taco sauce and one can drained pinto beans, not refried. This recipe can be less time consuming if you brown the ground beef, add in 1 package taco seasoning and 1/2 cup water, then add the garlic, onion, olives, tomatoes, green chilis, taco sauce and beans altogether and let simmer over medium heat for 10 minutes. I sprayed the bottom of the baking dish with cooking spray and put a layer of meat mixture, a layer of colby jack cheese, and a "2-ply" layer of whole wheat tortillas. (4 tortillas total) then did another layer of meat and cheese and topped it off with plain monterrey jack cheese, popped in the oven for 10-15 mins and it came out wonderful. Top it with diced tomatoes and sour cream and shredded lettuce if you like. This got really great reviews from my family.

This is a really good recipe as-is.  For me though, I prefer to use it as a base to do my "throw-it-in-and-see-what-we-get" thing.  For my family, I skip the jar of taco sauce, add 1 1/4 (or so) cup of chunky salsa and 1 pkg of taco seasoning.  I also skip the cans of refried beans and packaged tortillas and use my own homemade variety. Because I make my tortillas a little thicker, I haven't had a problem with soggy tortillas or mush-mush.  Then, for garnish after it's done cooking, thrown on some sliced green onions and put out fresh lettuce, tomato and extra black olives as sides for my family to add to their plates.  We have this meal at least 3x's a month.  It's really quite good.

A little bland, I cut the recipe in half since it is just me and my husband eating and it still lasted 2 dinners and 2 lunches!  I substituted the taco sauce for salsa and 1 can refried for 1 can black beans to help with the texture which turned out good.  I will make again this time no black beans and just 1 can refried beans.  More cheese!

This recipe is super good.  My kids called it the best lasagna ever!  So we've titled it Mexican lasagna in our house.  I did put a package of Taco seasoning in the meat mixture and it turned out great.  Maybe a tad spicy for the kids so next time I think I'll pass on the onions and peppers for thier batch.

This recipe does make a lot, but I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor.  I bought some aluminum pans so next time I can put some in the freezer and go directly to the oven.  I used half salsa and half taco sauce, and it was a bit too spicy for the kids so next time I think I will use all mild salsa and just add a little taco sauce to taste.

Great Recipe!  My whole family loved it!  I (accidentally) put only one can of refried beans instead of two.  I don't think i will put two in anyway, as this was perfect the way it was.  It does make a lot, so make for company or freeze half.

I really liked this recipe. I dont if I didnt follw the recipe close enough or what but mine ended up really thick so I think next time I make this I will cut the recipe in half. I would also love to try it with diced tomatoes, sour cream and shredded lettuce on top.

This is soooo good! My husband loved it. I halved the recipe, as there are only two of us and I took other reviewers' advice and spread spicy refried beans on the tortillas instead of mixing it with the meat, which made for a nice overall texture and consistency. I forgot about the sour cream last night, but tried it with my leftovers for lunch today, and it was good. This is going on our list of favorites!

This recipe is the BEST!  My family loves it and requests it often.  It is a very easy recipe to make.  We sometimes have it with mexican rice but mostly serve it alone.  I have added mexican rice along with the other ingredients and it is yummy mixed into the casserole.  I also use mexican seasoning in my ground chuck.  I cook the ground chuck, drain the grease, pour in 2 pkgs. Ortega or any mexican seasoning package, add 1 1/2 cup water.  Cook some of the water down, then add the other ingredients as directed.   My husband and girls just cannot get enough.  It makes enough to freeze half of the casserole to enjoy for another time.  I have also taken this to a sick neighbor who loves mexican food.  They loved it, too!

This was an awesome dish.  My 3.5 year old daughter loved it and she has been pretty picky lately.  My in-laws had it too and loved it.  The only thing I did differently was I did not put the black olives in it as my husband does not like them.  Otherwise, made as is and will definitely make this again!

This was delicious!  I made it just how the recipe says, but added a dolup of sour cream upon serving.  Easy to make!  Will definately be making again soon.

I thought this dish was ok. Hubby ate it, but I noticed the leftovers stayed in the fridge for quite a while so it definitely wasn't a huge hit. I don't know about anyone else, but it kind of reminded me of a 7 layer dip. So, not bad, but not superb either.

My family really enjoyed this! Husband loved it! I thought it to be a little bland so I had to add salt. I will definitely make this again but add in season salt possibly and next time I will add lettuce, salsa and maybe sour cream. Otherwise, very good.

I loved this! And everyone in my family did as well! (Even the picky eaters!) I used two cans of olives in my mix though and also used two packages of taco seasoning in the meat. At first it seemed a little spicy for my Midwestern family but everyone ended up loving in that way so it worked out.

It was a good recipe. Kind of bland. Maybe it was the products I used. I'd try to spice it up next time. It certainly was very easy and I had tons of filling left over. I'm going to freeze it and make another one at another time.

Great recipe! My hubby enjoyed it very much. I used less tortillas, and they were wheat. I also used turkey meat, and my hubby couldn't tell the difference. I made my meat layers thicker and doubled up on the tortillas in between. I also spread the beans on the tortilla, rather than mixing beans into meat mixture.

This was a delicious, easy-to-assemble recipe that my family loved.  I bought two foil 'casserole' pans (round, 9x3" - perfect!)and filled both.  I baked one and froze the other.  I liked how easy it was to modify the recipe to make it more or less spicy. I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Mmmmm, this was a delicious!  I halved the recipe, but used extra cheese and olives, and it completely filled a 9x13 baking dish which fed my family (2 adults and 1 child) for three meals.  Even my toddler thought the taste was fantastic.  Will definitely be making this again!

This is very good - and easy to make vegetarian!  I use Morningstar TVP crumbles instead of ground beef, that I cook with taco seasoning. I also use vegetarian refried beans (some have lard) mixed with taco sauce. I use a 13x9 (this is way more than will fit in there, but halving it isn't enough mixture.) I also accidentally used jalapenos instead of the green chili peppers. I layer like this: tortillas, beans, tvp, toppings, cheese. Top it off with sour cream & more taco sauce.

This is AMAZING! I did change a few things: I browned 1 pound ground beef, partially drained a half a can of rotel and 1 can of kidney beans (I didn't have refried beans on hand) and put it into the cooked ground beef. Pour in 1 package of taco seasoning because I didn't have a jar of taco sauce. I sprinkled about 1 tablespoon of garlic salt and 1 teaspoon of onion powder in the meat mixture. My husband and I are not fans of onion so I didn't use any.. I also used cheddar cheese. I put a tortilla, the meat mixture then cheese and repeated. The second time I put an extra tortilla on top with cheese on it. It was GREAT! My husband raved over it and so did my neighbor who we invited over!!

Great recipe.  I alter it greatly though now that I have made it a few times.  I use ground turkey verse beef.  We cut ground beef out of our diet over a year ago. I don't like spicy things, so the taco sauce is mild. I skip the black olives and green chili peppers.  I switch the canned diced tomatoes to one without peppers and with an Italian flavor to them.  And I have added enchilada sauce which really adds a boost. When cooking the turkey first - I add meat tenderizer, garlic powder, onion powder, worchestire sauce, and what ever else I am feeling.

Definitely easy and and a nice change from the ordinary.  I followed the other reviews and doubled up on the tortillas.  I would make 2 changes next time a) the filling was too dry for me, I would have added the rest of my 28 oz can of tomatos and b) a little more seasoning, maybe cumin or part of a burrito seasoning packet.

I thought this was quite tasty, but my family thought it was just okay.  I was afraid it might be too spicy, but it was just right!  It did make a lot, but that just means I'll freeze some for another time.  Yum!

Wow! I wasn't sure what to expect with this recipe, but it's like a mexican lasagna.  It kind of tastes like a beef enchilada.  I bet this would taste great with shredded chicken.  I used Rotel with Habaneros and nixed the extra can of green chiles.  It was plenty spicy, but not overpowering.  I used burrito sized tortillas as they nearly cover the complete dish.  Layered two tortillas between fillings and next time may use 3.  My husband didn't look encouraged when I was making the meat filling mixture, but a good cook knows looks can be decieving.  It's the taste that matters.  This is a family hit and a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

My family was skeptical when I was making this dish, but they are believers now! My husband and 3 of my 4 kids went back for seconds! I love trying a new dish and having success. The great thing about this dish is you can adjust the ingredients to your personal taste. I trimmed two sides of the tortilla and layered them in a casserole dish. I did use 2 tortillas per layer. Then I spread the refried beans on each layer,  added the meat, which I cooked in enchilada sauce because I didn't have taco sauce, then added a thick layer of cheddar cheese. I cooked it covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for another 10. Served with lettuce, tomatoes, black olives and sour cream on the side. It was delicious and held its shape! My kids did rename it mexican lasagna!

pretty good.  good lingering flavor.  will make a few changes to add a bit more flavor (i have dulled senses).  some pepper.  as a suggestion i would get the best taco sauce you can get, will make all the difference.  MAKES A LOT.  next time i will follow others advice and split and freeze one.    my wife and i ate an entire 9x9 pan.  and were not big people.

Made this tonight and it was incredible!!! Will definitely make again. I only used an 8 oz jar of taco sauce and spread the beans on the tortillas as recommended. This recipe made one good sized 3 qt. casserole. EXCELLENT!

Great recipe!  My family just gobbled this up. I added some taco seasoning to the beef and didnt put the beans in the meat but used them as an additional layer like some others reccomended.  I also substituted green peppers instead of chili peppers since thats what I had on hand.  Very good!  I will have requests from my family for this again I am sure.

This was awesome!  Even though it made a HUGE pan my family consumed most of it in one sitting, ( a growing teenage boy and daughter and football size husband)  I had to get the left overs the next day and it reheated Great!  Tasted even better the next day!  Thanks for this recipe, it is a definite keeper! I love Mexican food!

This is one of our favorite recipes! The only change that I make is to lessen the tortillas by half, otherwise it seems like too much tortillas and not enough filler! Great recipe!!!

I am sorry to say that this was really disappointing for me!  I saw 'spicy' and should have known better!  Very bland and not spicy.  I followed the directions too!  Next time I will season the meat more (I did some), maybe with a taco seasoning packet.  Overall it was easy, but if you are looking for something that is full of flavor, you may want to work the ingredients some.

I loved this.  The only changes I made were Black beans instead of Pinto, added Cumin when browning the beef, and a mixture of Mild & Hot taco sauce because my family enjoys Heat!  I Will most definitely make this again!!

This was surprisingly wonderful.  I didn't have a can of tomatoes so I used an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce.  I also used wheat flour tortillas instead of the regular.  This was amazing.  The only thing I would have on hand is some sour cream or even guacamole on the side.

This is a great base, my boyfriend and I use black beans, sometimes jalapenos, and serve it with sour cream. We also season the beef with taco seasoning. Ground turkey/chicken works great too. We also put a layer of tortillas on the bottom of the baking dish instead of a meat layer to make it a little less messy. Leftovers are even better!

As per the guidelines of creating this dish, I found the step by step instructions to be perfect and I ended up with a fantastic looking and tasting casserole (pie).  I chose to use black beans (drained) instead of refried beans due to personal preference and I also added a layer of mexican rice after the first layer of tortillas, sauce and cheese.  Being someone who loves super spicy foods, I also added 2 sliced jalapenos to the meat mixture as well as including two cups of pepperjack cheese.  I have no doubt that this recipe would have been equally as fantastic as is, I just have a tendency to go for a bigger kick :-)

I'm conflicted, we didn't like it all that much, but I also used red chili sauce, not taco sauce.  I think I'd like to try it again with the correct taco sauce and re-rate it.

I used carne asada that I slow cooked in my slow cooker all day and then shredded instead of groud beef. It came out wonderful!  I also did 3 tortillas per layer instead of one. Very filling, everyone had seconds!

Excellent!!  I followed the recs of others and spread the refried beans on top of the tortilla layer.  I also held the olives out until the layering so I could put them on only half.  I was able to fit the entire recipe in to a 3-qt 9x13 inch casserole dish, but it was very full.  This one is definitely a keeper!

Super good! Following other suggestions, I added taco seasoning to the meat and layered the refried beans separately alternating with the other ingredients. I did not add the can of green chiles, since the Rotel tomatoes have plenty in the mixture already. Don't think doubling up on the tortillas is necessary - mine came out just right with single layers.

I cut out the chili peppers and the olives because I didn't have them. Make sure to use 7% or better ground beef and a decent quality cheese to cut down on your grease factor. I halved the recipe because we were just trying it out. I'll make it full next time!

I made this recipe for 2 families and they both RAVED about it!  I used the mild diced tomatoes and green chilies to reduce the "kick" since children would be eating it.  I thought it had a great flavor and was simple to make.  This is definitely a keeper!

Delicious and very easy recipe! To make it even easier, I skipped cooking the burger and instead used 2 cans of chili, 1 with and one without beans. For the top layer, I combined whipped cream cheese and chili powder and spread that on the top, then covered with the shredded cheese.  Serve with sour cream and freshly chopped cilantro. EXCELLENT!

My husband and I host a lunch get-together every Sunday for a bunch of his guy friends, and I made this today for them.  It was a big hit.  I made a few changes: 1) I used some leftover pulled BBQ pork meat instead of the ground beef mixture.  I know, not very Mexican, but I had a LOT leftover that I needed to use up and it went very very well with everything else. 2) I made the tortilla layers by making "sandwiches" out of the tortillas and beans (a couple big scoops of beans between two tortillas.)  This worked out very well since I thought the beans and meat mixed together may have been too thick, and the two tortillas per layer kept the casserole together without getting soggy. 3) I served the black olives on the side, along with various other toppings, since some of my guests don't like black olives. All in all, this was very quick and easy to make and very good.  Our guests loved it.

I am so glad I tried this recipe and it was my first time. I brought it over for a potluck for my club's event and they loved it. It was funny, because we didn't have enough forks, so people were trying some crazy stuff to get some. If you are reading this review, BE SURE to check everyone else's reviews ESPECIALLY ones that give suggestions. I doubled the tortilla layer, so there was four stacks of two tortillas. Don't mix the refried beans with the meat mix. Leave the meat sitting in the taco sauce for about 30 min like how one of the previous reviews said. I did the meat-tortilla-bean-cheese-meat layering pattern. I think next time I do this dish I am going to add lettuce, guacamole, and sour cream. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Add my 5 stars.  This is fantastic.  I can't eat spicy foods, and for me, it had the slightest hint of zing.  I didn't include the beans because of family preference and used corn tortillas, but everything else was the same.  I put 3 tortillas per layer and it was not soggy at all.  I made a half size because we are a family of three, but will make full size next time.  You need leftovers on this one.  This is outstanding and I'll be making it often.

I thought this was really good after I changed it that's why I'm giving it 4 stars.  The whole family loved it.  First I did not mix the beans with the meat.  Instead I spread it on the tortillas, and placed the bean side down.  I also used some taco seasoning in the meat without extra water.  Even after draining the meat, and canned vegetables the meat mixture was still to runny.  May also leave the taco sauce out of the mix next time, but still add it in somewhere along the line.  With each tortilla layer I used 3 tortillas instead of one because it would have been to soggy.  Also, I used alot of extra cheese.  I'm not so sure about freezing this because it gets soggy easiliy.

Super yummy!!! My husband made this last night for supper and I am going to have to ask him to NOT make it again! I ate almost the whole dish it was SOOOO good. Seriously though it was easy enough for a novice to make and could be altered iun so many ways, but is perfect as it is. Thanks for this great recipe!

We love this recipe!!!  I have made this at all of my friends house and they loved it.  I double the tortilla's and cheese. When serving, add a dab of sour cream and gacamole, all on a bed of lettuce.  We crave this meal at least once a month.  Just as good the next day if not better.

This was pretty good. I thought it was a little beany! If I make again will only use one can of refried beans. I used double the tortillas in each layer and voila it wasn't soggy!! ( I think I read that in one of the reviews for this recipe ) Oh I also used two packages of zesty sausage. Topped with sour cream and fresh cilantro. This makes ALOT so be ready to eat for a couple days.

I couldn't believe it!  I actually tried a new recipe and my husband LOVED it!  I modified the recipe by using a cast iron skillet, spread refried beans between 2 tortillas, omitted the olives.  I seasoned the beef with taco seasoning. I topped the pie with some shredded lettuce, then sour cream, reserved tomatoes and fresh onions, and a few jalapeno peppers.  I sliced the pie into 6 pieces - it came out perfectly from the iron skillet.  It's a keeper.

As written, I'd give this 3 stars. The meat mixture was very bland and the beans gave it an odd texture, so I didn't add them all. I added taco seasoning and salsa to the meat mixture. Next time I will add more olives and chiles. I took someone else's suggestion and spread the beans on the tortillas instead and stacked 2 of them bean side down instead of using 1. I served with sour cream and taco sauce and it was delicious.

This is a fantastic dish that freezes and reheats well, which is a must in my house for weekday nights.  I only cook for two right now, so I would definitely suggest cutting the amount of meat in half to 1 pound.  To that I added a can of diced tomatoes, a white/yellow onion chopped, most of a can of pinto beans (instead of refried), and at least one packet of taco seasoning mix.  That's your filling.  Use at least two flour tortillas per layer and finish with some cheese on top.  The best mexican rice I have found was by Goya (yellow rice, chicken flavored).

I made this for our wed. night church meal and it was all gone!! I accidentally left out the diced tomatoes and you could not tell. I even up the servings to 50 and it still was a wonderful recipe in that large of quantity. I will be making it again for my church family and my family.

This was very good...made enough for a small army! I used one package of the taco seasoned ground turkey , & I just used 8 tortillas, 2 per layer. I also spread the refried beans on tortillas, & used cheddar cheese. Topped it off with sour cream!

I have been married for 31 years and created a dish similar to this, back then,and I call it Tortilla Stack Up, but I cook it in a cast iron skillet, and cut it like a pie. It was simpler to put together and even though my children are 30 and 27 they still request I make this for them when they are coming to dinner.

This is a great recipe - my family loved it.  I halved the recipe and my family of four still ate less than half of it.  This recipe makes a lot!  Per another reviewer, I used black beans rather than refried beans and it was delicious.  The only other thing I changed was that I used 8 oz. of mexican style shredded cheddar/jack cheese rather than the 4.5 oz. half the recipe called for.  We love cheese and this was awesome.  Will definitely make again!

This is a good recipe and it makes a lot which is handy because I just froze most of it for future meals! I did what others mentioned by putting the beans on one side of the tortillas instead of mixing them in with the meat and it worked out well - it kind of gave it more a layering of flavors. I also added in a packet of taco seasoning mix to the meat which gave it good flavor. I didn't have a 4 quart casserole dish but I used my 3 quart one and it worked fine. It was at the brim but I got it all in there without overflowing. I'll make this again for sure. thanks!

This is pretty good and filling, and it's very easy to make! I scaled it down since I only have my husband and myself to feed, and I made a few changes.  I browned 1 lb. beef, drained, added taco seasoning and fiesta nacho cheese condensed soup instead of taco sauce.  I then stirred in a can of Rotel and a small can of sliced black olives (rinsed/drained) and let it simmer for a few minutes. I spread zesty jalapeno beans on 4 10-inch wheat tortillas and layered with the bean side down. The layers were thus: Meat mixture, 2 beany tortillas, cheese, meat mixture, 2 beany tortillas, and a final layer of cheese.  I baked it in a 9 X 13 casserole dish at the temperature/time indicated in the recipe.  We both liked it (even though we're not big fans of ground beef). I'll make it again probably.  Thanks for the recipe!

WOW!!! Amazing!!!! I halved this recipe for my family cause I definitely didn't need the 16 servings worth! I used a 2 1/2 qt baking dish, 2 tortillas thick for each layer,omitted the olives by personal preference and holy moly was it good!!! My family loved it!!!! This will definitely go in the rotation! My husband added a little bit of hot sauce and sour cream, and devoured 2 huge helpings! Also 10 stars on easy-ness!!!

My family raved about this!! I did change it up a bit, though.  I omitted the olives, added black beans, reduced the meat to 1 1/2 lbs., and added taco seasoning.  I also used both taco sauce and salsa to give a good kick to it.  I can't wait to make this again!

This recipe is so good and easy to make. I leave out the olives as my husband really doesn't like them and it's still just as good. I try to buy thick flour tortillas so it isn't soggy. Makes great leftovers!

This recipe is great! I made a few changes. I don't like beef so I used 1 lb of chicken instead. I also skipped the olives. I used black beans instead of refried and fresh versus the canned tomatoes. It was so good! It was a little soupy so next time I'll simmer a little more and also make the tortillas 2-3 layers thick as others suggested! Definitely a big winner!

Substituted vegetarian chorizo for the ground beef and roasted pepper salsa for the tomatoes and taco sauce. Tastier than expected! Will make this again for a filling, delicious, quick & easy meal.

This was very good. Next time I would like to use 2 tortillas for every layer. I used "Refried Beans Without the Refry" for the beans and "Taco Bell Taco Sauce" from Recipezaar for the taco sauce.

I tripled the tortillas and also layered the beans and meat separately. I wanted it more like a lasagna and less like a casserole.  I also added extra spice and peppers to the meat mixture, as i LOVE things spicy.  This recipe was so easy and really delicious.  No matter what you put in here, you cant go wrong!

my boyfriend hates beef and tomatoes so I used ground turkey with taco seasoning and told him there were no tomatoes (but there really was) and he loved it. I will be making this often.

This recipe is a KEEPER!!  I added a can of rinsed black beans, and a can of mexi-corn.  I also used salsa instead of taco sauce, and saved the black olives to top the sour cream before serving.  It was DELICIOUS!!  I even used multi-grain tortillas to make it even more healthy.  Then I freeze the leftovers in individual containers for lunches!!

This was very good! I crisped the tortilla's before layering and used red enchilada sauce instead of the taco sauce and tomatoes because that is what I had on hand. Next time I will follow the recipe too a "T" as I'm sure it will be even better. Thank you for the great recipe.

I have to give this recipe an amazing review because my boyfriend loved it and he is SOOOOOOO picky.  I didn't include olives or beans and I used chopped jalapenos instead of green chilies.  I followed the suggestions and doubled the tortillas.  It was delicious!  I made 2 pies and froze one.  My guy and his son ate the whole thing before I could get back to it!  It's a hit.  The next time I make it, I'll put cheese between the tortillas.  Thanks KathiMC

My husband loves this recipe, I ommited the olives (don't like them). I recommend what other's say - add the beans to the tortillas, much easier and double up on tortillas. This is a favorite at our home, and now my aunt wants the recipe... Thanks!

Excellent!  I used ground turkey, whole wheat tortillas, and fat free refried beans.  After reading several reviews, I made the following changes: I divided the recipe between a pie pan and a springform pan and cut the tortillas to fit.  I used 8 tortillas, spread refried beans, then meat/tomato/sauce mixture and topped with cheese.  I don't think double-layering tortillas is necessary.  Served with shredded lettuce, chopped fresh tomatoes, sour cream and extra shredded cheese.  WONDERFUL mexican dinner!  It does take a bit of preparation time, but very good.

The simplicity of this recipe makes it ideal. The ability to switch out ingredients fro what you have on hand makes it one you will use over and over. I didn't have any taco sauce so I used red enchilada sauce instead. I fried my tortillas first to keep them from getting soggy. This is just one you have to try and tweek it to make it your own. Excellent recipe!

This was just okay for me.  Made it for a potluck & most of it was eaten.  I didn't use as many tortillas as called for & didn't add the beans to the meat mix, spread them on the tortillas instead.  It made a ton & was good, but not great.  Probably keep this one if I need another mexican dish, but not a regular recipe for me.

I have been making this recipe for the past 5+ years or so.  It works every time.  My husband doesn't like refried beans, so I use pinto beans and crush them a little bit.  The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because it is quite heavy...But it IS delicious!

I love, love, love burrito pie. One thing way I cook it is in a circle dish (about the size of tortilla shell) that way it loos a little more like a pie. I also skip the olives.

I'll be making this again tonight for my boyfriend and I. I made it once a couple months ago and we really enjoyed it. Although it was a little bland for our taste w/o the chilies. This time we've decided we are going to use the Rotel tomatoes w/ green chilies and mix it in w/ the turkey after cooking and let simmer. I do not use beef for anything I use ground turkey, to make it a little less greasy and fattening and it turns out very tasty. This is definitely a recipe I'll recommend to others, very delicious! Thanks for the great recipe :)

This was okay - I don't know if it was better than taco bowls but maybe worth another go.  I made a few changes . . . 1. I added a packet of taco seasoning (just the seasoning - no additional water) to the meat. 2. I also added a can of rinsed black beans and a can of drained sweet corn to the meat mixture. 3. I also added some peach salsa to the top before baking for some extra flavor. 4. Before serving I sprinkled some finely chopped cilantro for some extra color.

This was really good!  Both my kids (ages 4 and 2) really enjoyed it.  I did take some of the other reviewers advice and spread the refried beans onto the flour tortillas. I also didn't add taco sauce, I added taco seasoning to the meat, and added 2-3 flour tortillas for each layer.    2 weeks later....I just made this for a big party and everyone loved it.  There was only one piece left!

I made this for dinner the other night and I was very pleased with the way it turned out.  I added black and green olives to the layers and I also mixed a can of black beans with my refried beans.  Like other's, I didn't mix my beans in the meat, I just layered it.  My dish remined me of a Mexican Lasagna.  Anyhow, it turned out awesome and I will make again.  I served it with Mexican yellow rice and (Mexican corn) which is also a recipe on this site.  Yummy meal, thanks for sharing.

Very good!  Everyone loved it!  The measurements are enough to make 2 casseroles, and I froze one to make later.  You simply thaw and bake at 375 for 30 minutes.

Cut the recipe in half, did not have Rotel tomatoes, so used 1/2 can of petite diced; had no chilies, so diced some jarred jalapenoes; did not have 8" tortillas but had 5 burrito sized, so tore them into bite-sized pieces; added taco seasoning packet as suggested by others.  Made two layers, plus the bottom cover out of the sauce, which was a bit scarce at the end. DH enjoyed it.  I put plain yogurt over my serving, as sour cream sounded like a good addition and that was all I had.  Easy and pretty tasty.  Thanks for sharing.

I came across this recipe while looking for good make ahead meals. With 1700 mostly good reviews, I thought I'd give it a try. It was just ok, nothing fantastic. I made it as written other than omitting black olives. I ended up with a 9x13 casserole and a 8x8 in the freezer. I may make this again in the future but it won't be any time soon.

An excellent recipe. Pretty easy to make and plenty of room to make tweeks to suit individual tastes (ie alter heat level, use different cheeses or ingredients in meat mixture) Definately will make this again!

We loved this recipe !  I used the layering method that LISAKP71 suggested.  By hubby's recommendation, we also used a layer of crunchy tostada tortillas in between two beany flour tortillas.  While they became soft in cooking, I think they added a nice flavour to the finished dish.  I also used refried black beans.  I'll definitely make this again.  Great leftovers too !!

Overwhelming taste of beans and very heavy.  It needs something to lighten it up like sour cream or more tomatoes maybe?  I made in a spring form pan and that worked out very well.

It makes a ton, but I divided it into thirds and froze two portions for later.  Served with lettuce, sour cream, and salsa, it is just like a burrito- only easier to prepare.  Plus, who can find the seams with a spatula and keep rolled burritos whole and well formed in a pan while serving anyhow?  I sure can't- this solves that problem!

Very good!!!  I took a chance and made this for some dinner guests who like mexican food.  I halved the recipe for the 4 of us and it was the perfect amount with no left overs.  The men did have second helpings.  I doubled the tortilla layers and spread the beans on top of tortillas.  Used salsa instead of taco sauce and added more cheese.  Opted for no olives for our tastes.  Thanks for the recipe idea.

YUM! I am only rating it four stars because quite a few changes were made. We used shredded pork instead of the ground beef, and green enchilada sauce instead of the taco sauce. WOW! This was so tasty, and easy to make ahead and freeze for later use. Thanks for the recipe!!!

This was really great! I used ground turkey instead of beef to help make it a little more healthier. And since we like it cheesy, I added more cheese (4 oz) Its really great for next day left overs.

This is HEAVY.  A little too much on the refried beans.  Will try another reviewer's suggestion of "buttering" the tortillas, prior to arranging.  Not a scrap was left behind!

This was really good!! I did learn a few things that I will change. I didn't have enough salsa so I used taco seasoning with a little water and used what salsa I had, about 3 TBSP. (I did like the flavor the taco seasoning gave.)I also did a double layer of tortillas with the beans spread on the first layer. With my seasoning/salsa mixture it wasn't as moist as I would have liked; I'll do a single layer of tortillas the next time. I used a 9x13 pan which is too big for one recipe. You don't get the concentration of meat that I would have liked. My girls don't like black olives so I used them as a garnish,along with sour cream and shredded lettuce. Delicious!!

Not my cup of tea. It tasted a little bland despite using taco seasoning and the tortillas made it too soggy. Will not make again. Usually I love the recipes from this website, but so far this was the worst I've tried.

Very good.  I followed suggested changes adding a packet of taco seasoning to meat and spreading the refried beans onto the burrito.  I used a cup of cheese per layer for a total of 3 cups.  Will definitely make again,thanks!

This was a very good dish. I did use the suggestions of some of the other reviews and use more tortillas in each layer to make it easier to serve. Also I used a taco seasoning packet in the meat also to give it a little more kick. It worked perfectly. It was simple to make, it is still great the next day reheated, and my son ate his entire plate which is very rare. So This is definetly an excellent dish.

Very good.  Kids loved it.  Next time I would add some salsa between the middle layer.  Also on the advise of another I did use disposible pie pans.  Excellent idea.

I liked the flavor but the tortillas got soggy and ended up with a strange texture.  It was good, but I don't think flour tortillas are a good mix in a casserole.  Next time, I'll crush chips or use corn torillas.

My daughter made this for myself and my husband for dinner one night and it was very good!  I think the only thing she did different was to add the j. pepper to the hamburger when she was browning it.  We both thought it tasted even better acouple of days later!  Very good!!

Tasty! I only added 1 can of refried beans (totally forgot the other), omitted the olives (ick), and added taco seasoning (I used Taco Seasoning I from this site). Cheap, easy, and made a lot of food!

Husband LOVED, LOVED, LOVED.  I thought it was pretty good, especially with extra salsa on top. Keeps and reheats well.
Use a ~1/4c. chilula sauce to spice up when don't use spicy taco sauce/etc.

This is a nice little, easy recipe that can be easily tailored to your specifications.  I used soy ground beef, some leftover salsa, mozzarella and of course WAY more garlic than in this recipe as my changes and it was delicious.  It makes great leftovers too!

I thought that this was OK. I followed others comments and spread the beans on the tortillas, which I think helped the overall recipe. That said, I didn't think it was that great. I wouldn't make it again.

So amazing! I added Jalepeno Jelly in one layer and it gave it a little extra kick. I agree with others that you really should layer the tortillas thickly and I think black beans would help it out alot as theh refried are missed. I made this for my boyfriend and I and was worried that since it made so much, we'd get tired of it right away and it would sit in the fridge forever, but it only took a couple days. And it was the first time he's ever asked me what was in. He was impressed :)Delicious!

This was a great meal!  Very filling and the entire family loved it!  We have a few picky eaters so I left out the olives, green chili's and just used a huge can of regular diced tomatoes.  I used a taco seasoning packet instead of the sauce and ended up having to blend a big can of beans in the blender to make the refried beans as I didn't have any on hand.  I also used whole wheat taco shells and it's the first time I haven't heard the kids complain about eating them!  You couldn't taste the difference.  Thanks for the great recipe . . . oh, I also almost doubled the cheese.  It was great!

A really good recipe. I halved the recipe and made it in a round pie pan. It was plenty for my family of 4. I took the advice of others and didn't mix the beans in with the meat. I put the beans on each tortilla and layered 2 tortillas thick. It did fall apart when cutting it up, so I may try to mix the refried beans in next time to see if that makes a difference. Both of my kids like it, which isn't a common occurence. We will add this recipe to the rotation. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a keeper! I kept it on the mild side by using mild taco sauce and mild green chili peppers etc. I only made one modification by adding a pouch of taco seasoning to the ground beef. This is a delicious recipe that can feed an army for about $20!

This recipe was really good, and easy to put together.  I did make a few changes, just due to family preference.  I omitted the green chillies,  and used tomatoes ready for chili, instead of the ones with green chillies as my kids won't go for the hot stuff.  Instead, I threw in some frozen corn.  I also used wheat tortillas, instead of regular flour.  Needless to say, this recipe went over very well.  My 6 year old had 4 helpings! I will most certainly be making this again.

Half-a-dozen Burrito Pies later... We absolutely love this- still!! With just two of us, this usually goes into pie plates (half fits nicely in one 9" plate). My favorite tweak has been to spread refried beans on ALL the tortilla bottoms (any leftover beans simmer with the meat mixture) and sandwich two beany tortillas in one layer. Don't forget a little taco seasoning!

My family loved this recipe and it's so easy. I did change a few things I used a 28oz Herdez salsa cadera hot instead of the taco sauce and can tomatoes makes it a little spicier. Also used 2 cans of refried black beans along with a can of whole black beans to extend the recipes a little. Next time I'm going to try it with corn tortillas and see how that is. It's yummy

Excellent. I also added the taco seasoning. Dont add the extra water though. Just throw in th erotel tomatoes and let it simmer. Its best to spread the beans from the can onto the tortillas. Extra zing, put pickles japenos on the top prior to baking. Also I alternated with Quesadilla cheese and then put the Quesadilla cheese on the top. It has a great mexican flavor. I didnt add the taco sauce to the beef, i put it over each layer as assembled. When ready to eat, add guacamole, sour cream, and pico degallo. I also think spreading the beans on th eotrtillas keeps them from getting soggy. Enjoy

MY HUSBAND AND I REALLY LIKED THIS RECIPE.  I DID NOT MIX THE BEANS WITH THE MEAT. I PUT IT AS ANOTHER LAYER WITH THE CHEESE. I WILL MAKE IT AGAIN IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

Very easy, inexpensive dish.  I used a big round casserole dish.  Served with a salad and rice.  Not sure why the other reviewer said 448 bottles of sauce... maybe they had too much "sauce" when they reviewed! ;-]

This was VERY good.  I added sour cream to the top of the tortillas and then added the mixture and cheese.  I actually made two dishes each in a 2qt baking dish and added more spice to one dish so the kids would eat the one with less spice.  It was a hit!

This was very good. I did add the taco seasoning by bill echols from this site and simmered it about 45 minutes. I spread the beans on the shells so I had a meat layer, cheese and then beany tortilla on top. Everyone wants me to make this again. It was even good the next day for warm ups.

Actually - with a few of the tweaks that other reviewers offered - this is a 10 star.  I, too, spread the beans on the tortillas and put the beef on top of it.  I seasoned the beef with chili powder and cumin.  I left out the green chilis, and instead used jalapenos.  Skipped the taco sauce altogether.  Used two tortillas in each layer.  Topped with salsa, sour cream, and some shredded lettuce and tomatoes.  My crowd LOVED it.  So good - a DEFINITE keeper.  Makes a ton, too.

The ingredients were enough to make 2 9" pie pans; 1 to eat now and 1 to freeze for later. I used Pace chunky salsa instead of the taco sauce and I also added taco seasoning to the meat. I think I made my layers too thick because I could only fit 2 layers of the meat/cheese so go easy on your meat filling if you want more tortilla layers.

This is great! I used refried beans with chili peppers in them, which was just great. I would've like a little bit more zip so will use hot taco sauce next time. Otherwise this is a keeper!

This would be good w/ more meat and half the beans.  Lots of leftovers which no one would eat.  Only use one can of beans and increase the meat and this will be good.  Will try again with these changes.

This was good - hot and filling, beans and cheese, can you go wrong?  I only gave it a four because I made some changes. Cut the recipe in half and used taco seasoning since I did not have salsa or taco sauce.  Covered a shell with beans and placed a second on top (making a bean sandwich) for each shell layer.  I will make this again and try freezing it for a quick meal on a busy night.

I loved this as so did my family.  I don't like spicy food so I tweaked the recipe alittle. I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the diced.  I also did follow the others suggestions and use a pack of taco seasoning with the meat.  
Has anyone thought of adding a thin layor or rice?

This was very good, but it tasted like it was missing something.  I will definitely make this many more times and adjust it to suit my taste.

this was wonderful! I did what others did and made two of them and froze one for later. I also sprayed a little pam on the tortilla and put in in the skillet to make it nice and cruncy. it was so good! my kids cleaned their plates and wanted more! 1 more thing  I did was add some seasonings from Tastefully Simple( I do not sell it, but I like to buy it!) I spiced the meat up with the fiesta party dip seasoning and I also used some Garlic Garlic in the meat mixuture. theis was an excellent recipe and I cannot wait to make it again!!

My husband first said, "Oh no, not burrito pie!  I never like burrito pie!"  But after one bite of this burrito pie, he changed his mind!  My modifications:  used semi-mashed up black beans instead of refried beans, added some taco seasoning from a packet, baked in two pie plates (one with no meat), and added a few cubes of Velveeta cheese to the filling.

I used ground turkey instead, this will be in full rotation in my house!  There is no need to go overboard on the cheese and ingredients on this.  I only use 6 tortillas and i cover them with the beans then I cut them in half for easy layering.  I am pretty calorie conscientious so making this as light as possible.  There is no lack of flavor in here for sure!

My family loved this one and decided it got an 8(would of gotten a 10 but I had the layers to thick and only used 6 tortialls due to pan size)-definitely do the 12.  Didn't change a thing perfect!

This was SOOOO GOOOOD!!! Anyone who likes Mexican food should try this.  I took the advice of other reviewers and only used 1 can of beans and I spread the beans right on the tortillas.  I used 2 packages of shredded cheese.  I put 1 package of taco seasoning in the meat mixture.  Make sure you simmer the meat mixture for 20 to 30 min so all the flavors can come together.  VERY VERY GOOD!!!

absolutely delickious!  I used 1 lb hamburger and 1/2 lb ground sausage. Only used 1 can of beans.  My flour tortillas had been previously been frozen and when sampled the now thawed tortillas -they tasated a lil' freezer burnt taste.  I masked the flavor by putting alittle ranch dip on top of the flour tortillas before adding cheese layer...  it was wonderful.  Ranch dip or sour cream just adds another compliment to this flavored dish!  Thanks for the simple yet delicious new favorite...

This was pretty good, however I added the following so it would not be bland like some reviewers said:  1 tsp each of salt, cumin, chili powder, and about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon (from the advice of another reviewer, it gave a great flavor) I also spread the refried beans on the tortillas like others did. Next time I will add a couple of tbsp of hot sauce, as this was not spicy at all.

This was pretty good. I followed some of the other reviews and used taco seasoning instead of sauce and then spread the beans on the tortillas (face down) instead of mixing with the meat. Next time I will layer 2 tortillas each time rather than one.

YUMMY!  I made this for 2, so I put it into a 8X8 baking dish and used the smaller "taco" tortillas and only 1 pound of ground beef and 1 can of refried beans.  I used Rotelle and a small can of diced green chilies.  I also took other reviewers advice and spread the beans on the tortillas.  The was amazing served over shredded lettuce with a dollop of sour cream on top.  I can't wait to taste the leftovers today!

Wonderful! I am married to the one person on earth who doesn't care for Tex-Mex type stuff, and he really liked it. I halved the recipe and made some changes; omitted garlic and seasoned with a packet of taco seasoning, used green onion, and pinto beans instead of refried beans (don't care for refied beans).Also, since a two-year-old would be eating this, I used mild sauce, and regular diced tomatoes. Topped the pie with olives and sour cream, and served it with Mexicorn. I cooked the pie in a pie pan that fit the tortillas perfectly. It looked awesome and held together well. We all enjoyed it, and I can't wait to make it again. Thanks for sharing.

Awesome!  I made a vegetarian version without the ground beef.  I put whole beans in the beefs place.  I followed the recipe exactly after that and next time I'll turn the heat up by using "hot" Rotel instead of the "original".  THIS IS A HUGE RECIPE!

UPDATE: Leftovers are just as good. It also made me think that the pie filling might be good on a Mexican pizza. Yum! Yummy, yum, yum!!! Made this for dinner tonight for my bf and I. We both really enjoyed it, even though the bf thought it to be too "beany" (but he doesn't care for beans that much anyways). I made only half the recipe since it was just for the two of us. I layered all ingredients as directed - except for omitting olives (neither my bf or I care for them) and using DOUBLE the amount of cheese (Mexican blend). My tortillas were slightly wider than the dish I used (a round Corning Ware casserole dish), but after pressing them down, they fit perfectly. I did find that the tortillas were a bit mushy (but not too bad) and that the pie needed to set for about 10 mintues before slicing in order to firm up. My bf was HUNGRY, so I served us right away and dealt with it. : ) I wonder if using two tortillas per layer would solve this problem??? Served with fiesta corn and tortilla chips for scooping! I think I might try the meat / bean mixture over nachos sometime. A very easy and delicious dish that I'm sure kids would love (just use mild chilies and taco sauce - I used the medium-heat variety). This one's going in my "keeper" file and replaces the Mexican Lasagna recipe by POPCKLGAL that I usually prepare. Thanks for sharing!

Okay, maybe I didn't make it right--that's always a possibility--but this just wasn't good... With the same ingredients, I would've rather made simple burritos. This tasted like a burrito/taco mutant with soggy tortilla.

Easy great recipe.  I spread the refried beans on the tortillas and used much more cheese and twice the amount of black olives.  The kids loved it

It stayed together relatively well, even when I cut it up. I was a little worried it would "slide" because of the cooked cheese and beans. I changed it a little bit because I don't like olives, so I used layers of salsa, cheese, two types of beans, and a stir fry of peppers and onions.

I love this recipe, it has always been a success with everyone. Instead of hamburger, however, I put in 2 tubs of the taco seasoned shredded chicken. Yummy, yummy.

I was a bit unsure of this recipe when I made it.  I thought it was going to be a bit bland and boring.  I was delighted when my 4 year old told me she loved it!  My husband and I liked it also.  I did make a few changes/additions.  I made a half version with fewer layers.  I used ground turkey, added some taco-like seasoning during the browning process, used green enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce and spread the beans on the tortillas.  Great and easy recipe that I will make again.

Thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  Split it up between 2 11x7 pans, and froze one.
Did two layers of tortillas, meat, cheese.  Definitely going into my rotation!

My kids wouldn't eat this but my husband thought it was pretty good.  I may try this one again and knock down the heat a bit.  It was really easy which gives this a 4-star rating instead of a 3!

This is a great recipe because it's so easy to make.  I made it for my dad and he said he wished he could eat it everyday.  I usually cut it in half though unless I'm cooking for a bunch of people because this recipe really makes a lot!!

My children loved this. This recipe made three pies for me. I made one without refried beans for the kids, and I froze one. I did as another suggested and spread the beans on the tortilla and put it upside down over the cheese. Thought this recipe would taste like regular old tacos with more work, but it was quite tasty and different. The pie that I froze  came out just as good or better, just allow for more cooking time.

This was good.  I cut the recipe in half for the 4 of us and I still had leftovers. It was a little spicy for me.  I used a small can of El Pato sauce.  I might have used the wrong thing, so maybe that's why it was spicy.  It was still good and had a great flavor.

This was very tasty!!  I halfed the meat, taco sauce, and rotel.  I spread the spicy beans on the tortillas instead of mixing it with the meat and had at least 3 tortillas per layer.  I also added taco seasoning to the meat.  I used a whole bag of cheese. 8oz is not nearly enough for my liking.  This all fit nicely in a 9x11 pan.  Great leftovers too!!

Oh My.. this was so good!! My family just ate it up right away. This is also good as leftovers. Instead of a can of diced tomatoes with green chile peppers I used a can of diced tomatoes with onion and garlic, It still worked and taste wonderful. Also I used less refried beans and my favorite cheese, Cheddar. 
Thanks for this awesome recipe!! =D

Really good! I took some advice from a fellow user and made my tortilla layers 3 thick so they wouldn't get soggy and I'm glad I did. Very easy though and really flavor full and spicy! Was very good with the mexican corn. My boyfriend said we would prefer more beans, and I agree so next time I make this I'm going to try adding a layer of just refried beans in the middle.

This is one of my new favorite dishes.  Super easy to make and you can't beat the amount of food for the amount of ingredients needed.  We are a family of 5 and had half the pie leftover.  We topped ours with a few different items... tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, olives, and shredded cheese!

This recipe was very good...I too however noticed that the ingredients werent consistent.  After cooking this I realized that we would need to put the mixture in a burrito shell.  This was very yummy and you can add more cheese, salsa, etc if you have people in your family that dont like certain items.  I had to add olives to my individual one because noone else enjoys them but me.  This recipe does make an enormous amount of food.  I was thinking we could eat leftovers for lunch...more like a week!!  As a recommendation, do shrink the size of the recipe if you aren't feeding an army of people.

This is a great recipe and as with any recipe you should alter it to fit your liking... as I did. I used 1 1/2 lbs meat, substituted the diced green chiles for jalapeno(sm can), added taco seasoning, used one can of beans(jalapeno)added more olives and extra cheese. I layered the beans seperate in the dish between the tortillas and doubled the tortillas.Served it with a salad with lime and cilantro dressing... mmmmm! Thanks for the great recipe, it sure is a keeper. The whole family loved it.

I used soy "meat" crumbles and I think corn would've been a great addition to this dish.  In addition to the refried beans, I also added some black beans.  What a great meal idea.

This was really good! Before layering, I dipped each tortilla in oil and heated on cast iron griddle until lightly browned. For the refried beans, I added cream cheese, sour cream, salsa, shredded cheese & taco seasoning...heated in sauce pan until cheeses are melted. I substituted enchilada sauce for the taco sauce. I then layered as recipe states. Perfect pot luck dish. Thanks for sharing!

A family favorite!  I always make double, as it freezes well.  I have made this many times, often with variations.  Most recently, I used chicken instead of ground beef.  This was YUMMY, more texture than gr bf.

Great recipe, but it will serve an army as written.  I would recommend that folks cut the recipe in half, unless you're cooking for alot of people.  Very tasty and has a nice zip to it.  I would do this again.

This is really good and if you want an extra kick, substitute a can of sliced jalepenos for the green chilis. My kids loved this. I also made it vegetarian by using a bag of meat substitute crumbles for the beef. Also added a can of balck beans cause I love them.

Awesome recipe!!! We dont eat ground beef so I used shredded chicken instead, doubled the tortillas, only used one can of refried beans and put that and cheese as its own layer instead of adding it to the meat sauce. It was sooo good. My picky one year old loved it!

easy, fast, delicious! (always keep cooked ground beef in the freezer!)  I made this in a pie plate, spread the beans between two tortillas. This fed 5 with some leftovers for lunch!

This was a great and tasty dish.  I was in a hurry shopping for groceries and accidentally bought jalapeños instead of green chilies.  It was a little spicy for my taste, but we loved the dish with the extra kick.  We'll make it again, but with a little less spice.

First time making mexican food. It was a success! After reading some reviews, I made some changes. Use ground turkey, rotel lime cilantro diced tomatoes, chunky hot salsa, 4 mexican cheese, fat free refried beans. Layered with turkey then cheese then beans and topped with cheese again. It was spicy and great!

This was great, and easy, and it will go into regular rotation! Added pack of taco seasoning to the beef, and layered refried beans between two or three tortillas instead of mixing it into the meat . . . wonderful taste, satisfying dinner, super leftovers!

Very easy to make and a great dish! I used the springform pan to make this seeing the tortillas fit perfect in it. Be careful when you go to take it out of the springform. I let the dish set for about 5 minutes then cut it in the pan and then released it. Otherwise I think it would all ooze out. I doubled the layers of tortillas and spead the beans on top as suggested in other reviews. Also used salsa instead of taco sauce. Just before I put on the top tortilla I spead sour cream over it then topped with more cheese. Will make again!! So easy to make it the way you want it!

My husband suggested - and I agree - that it gets a bit doughy with so many tortillas. We prefer about half the amount. Otherwise, this was a quick & delicious meal.

Very good.  Layered it differently so that the tortillas did not get mushy. Halved the recipe and that still fed a family of 7.

Cut the recipe in half for our little family and baked in an 8x8 2qt dish, but otherwise followed it exactly. Came out wonderful! I will definitely be making this one again and again. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe does make a lot!  I added a couple chipotle chilis in adobo for heat and it came out great.  I'd make it again, but probably cut the recipe in half.

I made this recipe for our Super Bowl Party and it was an unbelievable hit!  My mother-in-law (who is vegan/vegetarian) LOVED it, and so did my 15 year old nephew who hates "fake meat."  It was an all around success!
Like many of the others that reviewed this, I "messed with" the recipe a bit myself.  I used thicker, burrito-size tortillas and used vegetarian protein instead of ground beef.  Also, I didn't mix the beans into the "meat mixture," but layered them on the tortillas as previously suggested.  My Burrito Pie was layered: meat mixture, bean-side-down tortillas, cheese, bean-side-down tortillas, meat mixture, etc.  On the very top layer, I layered two tortillas and sprinkled extra cheese on top before baking.  This left a crispy top crust with a nice moist inside.
As other people have mentioned, definitely get more than 9 oz of cheese.  I used 16 oz.
I highly recommend this recipe.

hubby and i had this last night, and it was o-so-delectable. good way to get me to eat refried beans, seeing as i hate them, but unnoticable in this!! :D hubby said would have like it to have crunched tortilla chips instead, so next time i will make half and half. simmered all the spices for 30 min (really lets it all blend) and forgot salsa/taco sauce, but had some mild sauce taco packets on hand, lol, so used about 15. :D i also added mexican rice already cooked, so my layers were as follows:
meat, rice, cheese, beans on tortillas, xtra tortillas, ect...

MUCH better with rice!!! :D a new fam fav!

This was so good! I halved the recipe for my family of 6, and we didn't have any leftovers. I used a round casserole dish. Also, I saved 1/3 of the refried beans and spread a little between 2 tortillas and sandwiched them together, so I had only three layers. My kids and picky husband couldn't think of one bad thing to say!:) This definitely goes in my regular rotation.

This recipe was great. very quick and easy to make. this recipe does make alot so  we did divide it between 2 disposable pie pans - one for dinner one to freeze for later:) we also doubled up on tortillas so it didnt get to soggy. For those of you that like wild game, we used ground venison. we definately will have this again!

Very good!  Like another reviewer suggested, I didn't add the beans to the meat mixture.  Instead I spread the beans on the tortillas.  I then layered four tortilla's together.  I layered the meat layer first, then the beany tortillas (face down).  Repeat.  Turned out wonderful!  Served sour cream, salsa, and other traditional burrito toppings alongside.

This recipe received a thumbs up from my husband.  I did change things up just a bit due to lack of ingredients.  I used "hot" taco seasoning mix and juice from diced tomatos and peppers in lieu of the taco sauce.  It was pretty spicy, but we like it.  Thanks for the recipe.

This tasted really good.  The only problem I had was that I followed another reviewer's suggestion of putting it in a spring-form pan so that it would look pretty.  As soon as I tried to cut it, the meat mixture oozed out everywhere and made a huge mess.  Luckily my family didn't mind it's appearance since it tasted so good.

Very good and easy.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it...was one of the first things to disappear.  I minced my onion and sauteed it with the garlic before adding to the ground beef.  I also added a packet of taco seasoning to the ground beef while it cooked.  Yummy!  Thanks!

My husband loved this recipe.  I made it heart healthy by using ground turkey, fat free refried beans and fat free cheese.  I used more cheese because we are cheese lovers.  You couldn't tell the difference and it cut the calories and fat in half.

Quick and easy to make.  My family loved it, even my fussy two year old.  I did follow some of the previous reviews and spread the refried beans on the tortillas instead of mixing with the meat mixture.  I also used taco seasoning with the meat, added no water just mixed the seasoning in dry.  I drained most of the liquids from the tomatoes and green chilies as well.

My family loves this dish.  I do leave out the olives or put just a few on top so my kids don't have to pick them out.  We eat a lot of black beans and if we happen to have any leftovers I add them to this casserole.

I only made a few slight changes to suit the taste of some picky eaters (can of chilies and olives) but otherwise it is an outstanding recipe.  Very much a keeper!

It tasted good, I added salsa to the meat, and ploblano, on top of the onions and garlic, and taco seasoning, It still needed more flavor for me, my kids loved it though,(shocker!) I also used corn tortillas, Next time, I will add fresh chopped tomatoes, more seasoning, and I will try with homemade salsa, that packs more of a punch. Good recipe and will do again.

This is a family favorite!  They ask for it at least once a week.  I wouldn't change one thing about it.  I guess my family eats a lot, we can usually only get 2 meals out of it.

I halved this recipe and made adjustments as others stated and STILL did not like this. I thought it was bland. It tasted like it was missing something. I also thought it was doughy from the flour tortillas.  I added taco seasoning to the meat and garlic powder too. No one else complained but it's not something I will make again.

I followed the recipe exactly.  It makes way too much food, there are too many ingredients, and for the way it tastes, it's just not worth it.  I really wanted to like this recipes, but I won't make it again.

This is one of my favorites!  My sister has made this for me several times.  I like to add a jar of jalepenos and taco seasoning to the meat.  It is great that you can make it as spicy as you want.  I have also made a vegetarian version by adding more beans making sure they are not made with lard.  I mix the taco seasoning with the beans for the extra flavor.

I love this recipe.  I used the scaler to  reduce it to two servings but still ended up with a ton of food.  I like the idea of splitting it into two pans and freezing one.  I used ground Turkey instead of beef and used a lot more cheese then the recipe called for.  I used Medium taco sauce and it was a bit to hot.  Next time I will use Mild taco sauce.  This will be great for big family gatherings or Football Saturdays/Sundays/ Mondays ;)

4.5 stars!!! I substituted corn for tomatoes and didn't add the chilis. Next time I'll use medium taco sauce because mild doesn't have enough spice. Great recipe! You might want to halve it. =)

This was really good (even made with whole wheat tortillas and light cheese like I used), but definitely makes a TON of food (I used a deep lasagna pan and it filled the whole thing).  Great to make for a large family or gathering with friends.

This was great. I made no changes to the recipe other than following other reviewers advice to spread the beans on the tortillas. I love the taste of the meat mixture and I think I am going to use it for serving over nachos. Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent! As other reviewers suggest, I do not add the beans to the meat. Instead, I spread them on each torilla before layering. This is now a regular at our house..... so versatile, too.

This was a nice change from the usual tacos or burritos.  It was very easy to make and was great topped off with lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream.  We will be adding this to the rotation!  Thanks :)

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site.  It turns out great every time and is a true croud pleaser!  It is my "go to" recipe for a croud.  The only thing that I have found I had to change about the recipe is the amount of cheese used.  I use A LOT more!!!

This was a good one but I don't know how you were able to stuff all the ingrediants into one skillet. I thought the taco sauce instead of taco seasoning was a delicious touch. I spiced mine up by using the Hot style Rotel. Another interesting thing about this recipe is that the leftovers were better than when it first came out of the oven.
   I didn't use as many tortilla layers as the recipe recommended because I thought it would be too much but I was wrong. My dish actually would have been better had i put another layer of tortillas.

This is a very good and easy dish. I actually forgot to add the refried beans to the meat mixture and it was still very good. I think it would have held together a little better but it wasn't a problem. I also used medium heat taco sauce and it gave the dish a great flavor. This makes a lot-think lasagna-so plan to make it for a crowd. Enjoy.

This was great.  Very much like a Mexican lasagna!  I cut the recipe in half for the two of us and it was still a LOT of food.  Sent the recipe to my sister and her family loved it too.  I spread the refried beans on the tortilla shells instead of mixing it with the meat...seemed to work well.

Delicious and hearty. I used small whole wheat tortillas(maybe 8 inch?)and it worked out well. I also sprinkled in a little burrito seasoning, oregano, and cumin. Will definitely make this again.

Made this twice.  The first time I would have only given it a couple of stars because I could not cut through the tortillas.  The second time I spread refried beans on one side of the tortillas and it came out perfectly.  I used whole wheat tortillas both times.  The taste was delish and everyone enjoyed it!

I too only made half a recipe since there were only 2 of us (had plenty for left overs!). I agree that you can tweak it according to your taste.  I liked the beans mixed in.  This made an eye appealing mexican dish.

This was excellent!  We don't like olives so I substituted black beans and had to layer the refried beans seperately as they didn't fit into the pan I used but those were the only changes.  I will definately make this again soon.

This was pretty good. I didn't add the olives and added the beans in separately (not to the meat mixture). I also, cooked my flour tortillas in oil. I liked the meat cooked with the taco sauce so I may just do that next time and make tacos/burritos instead to time.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet. This is my husbands favorite comfort meal. We love the flavors and the simplicity. I add a little extra tortilla just to keep it from getting to mushy but other than that I follow this recipe completely.

Everyone in the family liked this dish, except for my very picky 12 year old. You can easily make this as spicy as you want for those who can "take the heat". A good dish to take to potlucks too.

This was very good! My fiance' and I loved it and my co-workers were oogling my leftovers at lunch! I did take the advice of others to spread the refried beans on the torillas and not mix it with the meat. I halved the recipe and it was more than enough for us.

This was very good and easy to make. The whole family enjoyed it.  I did omit the garlic and onions and used 1 pack of mild taco mix. I also used to flour tortillas per layer. I did cut mine with scissors to fit. I mixed the meat with the beans and it was good. My 8 year old son asked me to make it again!

Very easy to make.  Looked and tasted good enough to serve to company or take to a potluck.  I don't like beans or olives so I only put them on half, which worked out perfectly.  The ingredient amounts were perfect, the only reccommendation I have is to add some sour cream.  I will definately be making this again.

I give this recipe a mediocre rating simply because it lacked "pizzaz."  Perhaps, using corn tortillas would make it tastier.

My family loved this recipe.  I only used one can of refried beans since that was all I had.  I thought that was plenty.  The only other thing I will do differently next time is start the layer with the flour tortillas instead of the meat mixture.  We also put a dab of sour cream on top when served.  Delicious!!  I'll definately share this one.

Easy and delicious.  A little spicy, but my kids still ate it.  I think I'll mix in some rice next time.  My hubby suggested using the filling for regular burritos, so I'm going to try that too.

Delicious and easy! I used leftover taco meat from the freezer we had cooked, seasoned and then food-savered so it made this very quick - after it was heated thru I followed the rest of the ingredients/instructions. Great weeknight meal.

Great recipe! I'll tweak it next time to make it more spicy, just because that's how my family likes it. I also used taco seasoning in the meat and put the refried beans in between 2 tortillas instead of mixing it in the meat mixture, as per previous reviews. It definetly has its designated spot on the family menu!

Great recipe!!  Super easy to make and my husband loved it.  The only substitution was I used light cheddar instead of colby to help the heart.  I will be making again for friends!

I made this for the first time last night and my family loved it; it was even better today as leftovers!  I made one 9x11 casserole and one pie casserole dish (to freeze).  I was going to try and make 3 pie casserole dishes, but it seemed there wouldn't be enough of the meat mixture to layer all 3 dishes.  I made the following changes based on reviews: 1) I pan friend the tortillas for more texture.  2) I spread the refried beans between two tortillas per layer. 3) I added one full packet of taco seasoning to the meat. I somehow ended up with the tortillas on top, so I just top it with cheese, and another can of sliced olives, then I baked it covered so it wouldn't dry out.  It came out great. I may actually try mixing the refriend beans with the meat mixture next time to make it easier to assemble.

This was awesome! My Hispanic husband took 3rds. I halved the recipe and added 2 cans of tomatoes instead of one! This recipe makes a lot! Great!

It was pretty good. I could have changed it up a little. I didn't love how 'wet' the tortillas were.

wow!! this was awesome! i followed the tip of spreading the beans on the tortillas, and it worked wonderfully. i also made my own taco sauce, (cause i had none on hand) with tomato paste, taco seasoning, some water and a bunch of vinegar. i found vinegar worked really well in spicing up the meat mixture. it made it just a little more exciting. this is definitely something i'll make again!

I made this recipe last week for the first time, and my husband and I adored it!  I made it extra spicy by adding jalapeño peppers instead of green chilis; I added a very spicy Mexican salsa instead of your run-of-the-mill taco sauce.  I took the advice of other reviewers and spread spicy black refried beans on top of the tortillas.

I gave this recipe high ratings. My family loved it and it was something easy to make after a hard days work. I did like many people change up the recipe. I used 2 pounds of beef and seasoned it with garlic and onion powder and some old el paso taco seasoning. I left out the chilies and olives. I used a 14oz can of Del Monte tomatoes and zesty mild chilies. I used a pound of Mexican blend cheese in place of the Colby. After I browned the ground beef and sautéed the garlic and onion. I drained the grease then cooked the mixture in a bigger pot. I layered everything like in the recipe and cooked it about 20-25 minutes. I let it rest for about 10 minutes. Then I cut and served it with salsa, sour cream,and lettuce.

I made this exactly how it was written but used 12 oz. of cheese.  Use a large casserold dish because I was only able to use 4 tortillas (2 layers) due to size constraints.  The whole family LOVE it!

Good base recipe. I made these changes. 1 lb of ground beef
1 tsp of fresh chopped garlic
1 can of stewed tomato
1 can of corn drained
1 packet of mckormick white chili mix
I had no green chilies (they are in the white chili mix)
When I layered with tortillas, I put one layer of refried beans, one layer of beef, one layer of uncle ben's ready rice (garden veg.) with fresh avocado slices. Keep layering and top with tortilla and fresh avocado slices.  Serve with side of sour cream, paul newmans mango salsa, and lettuce...yum yum.

I even messed up and only put one tortilla per layer and it still turned out great!!! I only used one can of refried beans, but other than that I followed the directions exactly.  It was superb served with a big dallop of sour cream....mmmmmmmmmm :-)

Yum!  I made this in 2 2.5Q dishes.  Each serve 4 people with a side dish. Easy and tasty!  We left out the chili peppers and taco sauce and it was still quite flavorful and a bit spicy!

FANTASTIC!  My husband never compliments my cooking!  I did dry "pre-heat" the tortillas, added taco mix to the meat, spread the refried beans instead of mixing them and added a jalapeno!  YUMMY!

WOW!  My roommates, my boyfriend and I all loved it, I'll be making this often.  There's lots of leftovers too, I hope it reheats well--otherwise I'll have to halve the recipe next time.  Absolutely worthwhile, I can see it being a favorite for any family.

This was great. My husband & I very much enjoyed it. A couple changes to give it some kick. I used jalepeno refried beans & hot taco seasoning for the ground beef.  It was perfect. And I don't know why people are saying it's soggy, wasn't soggy at all!!

Yummmm!  This is a family favorite -- one that mom, hubby and all three kids look forward to eating.  It's also easy to make; reheats well and travels well.  The taco sauce you use, both brand and heat, makes a huge difference in this dish.  Mine always comes out a little different since I switch up sauces alot, but the results are always delicious.  If you're serving young kids or adults who can't handle spice, try using a mild sauce and eliminating the chiles as this dish can be quite spicy (which I love!)  I've made it with and without the beans and it's great either way.  You really can't go wrong with this one.  It's awesome!
Note:  Use a deep casserole where you can get at least three or four layers of tortillas.  Two few layers and it's a mushy mess.

I added taco seasoning to the meat, but otherwise prepared it as directed. The taste was definitely 5 stars, but the ease in serving was about 3 stars. I will make this again, but next time I will make it the day before, let it sit in the fridge overnight, and then cut it into slices and reheat it the next day. I thought it tasted even better the second day!

I thought this came out well. I cut the recipe in half and it still made sooooo much. My husband really liked it. This is something I will make again, but not often. A farely easy recipe.

This is way too good! We aren't huge fans of beans so I only used one can and it was still very tasty. I only used the recommended amount of flour tortilla's and it wasn't too soggy or anything. I think it may have to do with how you layer it. I also added a pinch of red pepper to spice it up a little since all of the ingredients I found were mild- I may add more next time because I love that spicy aftertaste! Great recipe!

Loved it!  I used only diced canned tomatoes - without green chiles and instead used a medium taco sauce.  I left out the olives because I don't care for them. Next time I will double or triple the tortilla layers for a thicker pie.  Fiance went for seconds and even my picky 8 year old ate it!  I will put this in rotation at my house!  Very easy to make and it's done in no time flat.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

My entire family loved this. Easy to make, I could even prepare it before I leave for work in the morning and pop it in the oven when I get home. I left the chilis out and it was spicy enough with just the rotel. I cut the recipe in half and it was more than enough for the three of us. Thank you!

It's a great dish to make alot of "burritos" in 1 shot.  It doesn't taste much different than a burrito - but that is what I expected.  Whole family loved it!  I did use corn tortillas instead of flour and next time I would definitely drain off all the meat fat, only to take out more liquid.  It was even better the next day!

Very good, but with a few changes.  I cook for my husband and I, and the original recipe said it served 16!  So, I used a pie plate to make this pie and it came out to be only about 4-5 layers.  I used ground turkey and mde it with some taco seasoning instead of taco sauce becuase that's what I had on hand.  It worked out well becuase the liquid from the tomatoes helped to dissolve it and I ommitted the water it calls for on the taco seasoning packet.  Because everything was so hot when I put it together, I only baked it for about 15 minutes and then I put it on broil for less than 5 minutes so that the cheese got brown and very bubbly.  We loved it.  VERY tasty.

I read the reviews and added taco seasoning to the meat, doubled on the tortilla layers, spread the refried beans onto the tortillas, used a 9X13 pan, cut the tortillas so they would fit, let the meat simmer for 30 minutes and even added jalapenos to the sauce. I did try putting tostitos chips on top then putting cheese over before putting in the oven. Don't do it, it makes it really hard to cut into. Overall it turned out very tasty and I’m giving it five stars; however, I’m not sure if just making burritos or tacos would have been just as good. I will make this again but not anytime soon.

I would definitely add taco seasoning when browning the beef next time. But it was pretty good. I was expecting something amazing given that it has over 1500 5-star reviews. It was good but definitely needed something else with it, namely some spice. I think adding corn is also a good suggestion like someone said.

This was ok; the flavors were good. I probably won't make it again because I didn't care much for the layers and prefer to eat soft tacos. But that's just me. I did garnish it with sour cream, tomatoes and lettuce.

I used one pound beef and one pound ground turkey and omitted the olives.  Other than that I followed the recipe as stated.  I thought it was good, but a regular home made burrito is better and takes less time to make.  My husband specifically asked to have do-it-yourself burritos next time.  Brown the meat and have all the extras on the side to put on yourself.  Doubt that we'll make this again.

I thought it was okay but nothing to rave about which is why am surprised by the rating and other reviews. I probably won't make this again.

I really enjoyed this recipe. However, I did make a change or two. I didn't have ground beef so I boiled 3 frozen chicken breasts and then shredded them into the pan with the onions and garlic. It didn't seem to make as much as others said it would, I think thats because I used less chicken. Also at the suggestion of another reviewer, I spread the beans on the underside of the tortilla instead of mixing them into the sauce, and I only used one can of beans. 3 out of 4 in my family loved this recipe. For something crunchy my husband ate it with nacho chips.

This was a fantastic meal.  I used about a half of a jar of salsa instead of the tomatoes and chile peppers.  I also used home made tortillas from a recipe on this site (Mexican Whole Wheat Flour Tortillas).  My kids loved this meal, and it's hard to get them to eat anything.  I will definetely make this one again.

Yummy. I did not use chiles, but put jalapenos on half of the pie for my hubby. I also used 4 blend mexican cheese (all I had). It was little dry, but sour cream and salsa on top solved that problem. Next time I may try not to drain the fat from meat to have more moisture in it or use salsa instead of taco sauce. Willmake again.

Absolutely awesome!!! I didn't add the extra can of peppers. I also used a 13X9 in. pan. Instead of colby, I used 1/2 mont. jack and 1/2 cheddar! This was a great combo! I also snuck in a layer of tostadas. This added an extra crunch that was nice. I used the recommendation of someone else's review and spread the beans on the burrito (and tostada) shells. This worked great! The only other thing I did was add some of the taco seasoning to the meat. Our family will make this one frequently in the future!!!

I enjoyed this but I thought that it needed more tortillas so I made it again and layered it using twice as many tortillas--much better!! I also used a deeper dish to bake it in. This makes a great presintation with shredded lettuce and chopped tomatoes.

I gave this 5 stars cause it's so versatile.. you can make so many changes or leave it as is and it's still great. My family loves it no matter which way I decide to make it.. with tortillas or with chips. Makes a great taco salad as well. =)

I had to post a review only to warn other viewers. It's probably my fault but I didn't realize this meal turns out flaming hot! My throat and ears burned for a long time afterwards. Take out all the hot stuff (taco sauce, tomatoes with chilies and chilies) add regular tomatoes and it would be just fine.

One of our favorites!Beware if you're counting calories as this is definately NOT a low-cal meal. I try to limit myself to one serving,however, the men/boys in my life just devour this!!! The kids call it Mexican Lasagna. This is one of the few recipes on this site I make "as is". Excellent the next day! Thanks!

Everyone in the family AGREED this was great... I have a house full of picky eaters, and it seems no one ever likes the same things.  Only thing I changed was I used fresh diced tomatoes and 1 4 oz can low sodium V8 juice (I didn't have diced tomatoes on hand) and I put velvetta cheese slices on top.  It was great, thank you!

This really makes a lot of food!  I would rate this recipe as OK.  I took the advice of others and added a packet of taco seasoning mix.  The flavor of this dish was absolutely wonderful, but it didn't have a great texture.  It sort of ended up looking like a pile of mush, BUT to be fair, the meat mixture tasted great.  I think I would make this again, but I would substitute broken up taco shells or corn chips for the tortillas.  I would probably also only use 1 can of the refried beans.  Overall, a good recipe.  Thanks!  :)

SUPER recipe!  only used 1 can of beans, no green chilis - kids don't like too much heat, and added 1 T. taco seasoning.  oh, and used corn tortillas.  SUPERB!

This was good, I halved it and used an 8x8 pan, and only used 4 or 5 tortillas. No one was excited about the way it looked, but even the picky eaters were pleased by the taste.

Really good!  I left out the peppers, since the kids can't (or rather, won't) take the heat, and set out chopped peppers for adults to garnish.  My kids don't like casseroles on principle, but they loved this.  It's a bit on the bland side without the peppers, but still very tasty.  I loved how easy it was!  I halved the recipe, and after feeding four of us, there were still leftovers for another night.

Had great taste. I followed a couple of the reviews and added taco seasoning, i think it added a lot of extra flavor. My husband loved it. Will make.

I halved the recipe, used a round Corningware dish, used corn tortillas, added corn, fresh cilantro and homemade salsa.  I seperated the refried beans from the meat as suggested by others and won't use the black beans next time.  I added extra onion and seasoned the beef with taco seasoning; next time I'll add a little garlic salt as well.  Topped it with sour cream and more homemade salsa.  Excellent!

The beauty of this recipe is that you can use what you have and change it to your tastes. I really wanted easy Mexican but was short on supplies. Instead of ground beef I used ground soy and I used a regular diced tomatoe plus a can of green chilies. I only needed 3 tortillas. It was great. I'll defintely make it again.

My entire family loved this dish. It's easy to make and sure makes a lot. Next time I make it, I'll use my roasting pan instead of my 12" skillet because the skillet wasn't big enough.

This was an excellent quick and easy dish.  I lightened it up using extra lean ground beef, fat free refried beans and light cheese.  I halved the recipe as the serving for 16 was a bit much for our family.  My husband really enjoyed this recipe.

I made this for my husband the other night and he really liked it. I was a little nervous as I was cooking the meat mixture but it turned out pretty good. It makes quite a bit of meat/bean mixture so I froze half of it to put together at another time. I did add taco spices to the meat as I browned it and added some hot salsa, since I didn't have enough taco sauce. I will definitely be making this one again!

We enjoyed this, but didn't love it. I used hot taco sauce and added extra seasonings, but it still wasn't what I would call spicy or hot. I didn't like that some of the tortillas got almost mushy. I mixed the refried beans in with everything, as written, as my husband won't eat beans; he didn't mind them mixed in. I will probably make it again, definitely adding in corn as other reviewers suggested.

Very good.  Make sure you use a round casserole dish, not a rectangular baking pan.  A rectangle won't allow you to easily stack the tortillas.  I've made this a few times, and have only used about half the tortillas before I run out of sauce!  Also, I use Boca Crumbles instead of the ground beef.

This was very filling! We liked this and I found it to be very easy to put together. I also added taco seasoning to the ground beef.  We added sour cream and avocado.  The teenagers in this house really enjoyed this recipe.  Thanks!

This was a good recipe.  I used the suggestions of VARISSUL.  
In place of the diced green chili peppers & can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, I used a can of rotel tomatoes and to that, I added a can of cream of chicken soup.
Family LOVED it.  Will definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe. I did not think it was so hot(as in spicy)-I live in Louisiana and I and my husband are used to much hotter but my husband could not stop telling me how good it was. He took it to work for lunch and when he heated it in the microwave everyone asked him what that wonderful smell was. His work is used to me cooking some good meals -they raise money for their extra activities and they have cook offs.I will be making this again.

Wow. I halved this recipe and wished I didn't,but I was just working with what I had. I used the can of refried beans with the chiles instead of a can of chiles to keep the heat down a notch. I guess it depends on your appetite,because my husband downed 1/2 the dish the first night and the leftover(which was about 2 servings left)the next morning. Next time I'll just freeze some of it if I make the full amount because it was that good.

Very good dish. Depending on the spice, you can adjust with mild or hot peppers. We added extra olives since we love them. Very flexible to change a big hit with the entire family. A++ recipe

This was so easy to make, everyone loved it (including my picky six-yr-old)and it makes a lot. I made this recipe as is and threw half of the meat mixture away. Half of this recipe fed my family of five with leftovers for me the next day! Yummy!

Made the following changes, as suggested by others: used 1 can refried and 1 can black beans; added extra cheese, 1 can corn, and taco seasoning.  The taco seasoning added great flavor, but I recommend using mild seasoning (or at least mild taco sauce) since the dish is pretty spicy already... but very, very delicious!

This was a great recipe! Very easy and full of flavor! I added some frozen sweet corn kernals and black beans too! My husband and kids really enjoyed it!

I thought this dish would be full of flavor but it wasn't. My man didn't like the olives in it. I did add corn from the previous suggestion. I also added more seasoning but it still tasted bland.

This recipe was pretty good, though my husband and I thought it needed more of a kick so we added some chili powder and cayenne pepper. Topped it with sour cream and it was a hit with the kids, who I might add are picky eaters!!

I must have done something wrong to screw up the recipe because when I made mine it really lacked taste. The pie s definitely looked good but has no spice or flavor. Like I said it must have been me who messed up the recipe. Will try and make this again

This was good, but I unlike some of the others would have stuck with Taco Sauce, I used salsa, and thought taco sauce would have been better.

This was very good and easy to make.  I spiced it up some by adding cumin, chili powder, and salt and pepper to the meat.  Next time I will serve it with lettuce and tomatoes or pico de gallo, maybe some sour cream.  Infinitely "doctorable."

tasty and very easy.  More layers would look nice, but i don't really see the point in separating the ingredients unless you want more work.  I added taco seasoning and a dash of hot sauce and it was great.  I wouldn't change a thing except to maybe add more cheese.

My husband and I loved this recipe. It has a nice spicey kick to it and it is very easy to make! you can make it as spicey as you want by using a hotter taco sauce.

Awesome!  I handed this recipe over to my boyfriend to make for dinner and he did a fantastic job.  I did read previous reviews and made changes accordingly.  I used one and a half pounds of ground meat as well as refried black beans.  Next time I will use more spicy green chiles for a little bit more of a kick.  I suggest small servings with a dollop of sour cream.  Yum!!!

Not too bad, I suppose it was what it was.  The tortillas I used got a bit too soggy, maybe toasting them in an oven would help first.  I left out the chilli's and the hot sauce.. WAY too hot for us!  It all got eaten, I suppose that's a good sign.

Delicious and so easy, very little mess. Made with ground turkey to make it a little lighter.

I've been making this recipe for about 3 years now.  My husband loves it and asks for it all the time.  I leave out the taco sauce - instead just cook the meat and add taco seasoning and water as the recipe says on the back of the seasoning package.  I also cook a bag of white rice and stir the cooked rice into the meat mixture - sometimes adding a little extra taco seasoning and water.  I layer refried beans on one half of the pie because my husband is not a fan. We love this dish.  The tortilla is never too soggy.  And the casserole is so much better the next day.

This turned out terrific!  I did make a few changes...I used a 2 quart dish and halfed the recipe.  I ended up only using 4 tortillas.  Very good, though!

Pretty bland....my mother in law liked it but she hates any type of spice or seasoning on anything. Hubby didn't finish it and that says a ton. We prefer Mexican to be a lot zippier. I'll stick to going out for Mexican food.

This is absolutely wonderful.  It seems to be even better the second day.  I served it with shredded lettuce and sour cream.  Made once already this week and am making tonight to take to a friends for "Mexican Night".  Will add chips and salsa tonight.  Thanks!!!

I thought this recipe was really good.  My husband thought it was great, but would have been even better if it had something crunchy in it.  I modified this recipe as such: instead of adding the refried beans to the meat mixture, I added a can of mexican black beans with corn- San Antonia mix, as well as some chuncky salsa (left out the tomatoes) as well as adding a packet of taco seasoning per reviewer suggestion.  I also spread the refried beans to the tortillas.  It was a fun recipe to make as well, and easy to adapt to your own taste.

I had taken advice that the others had offered, I spread the beans on the tortilla layers and added the taco seasoning. I added Mild Taco Bell taco sauce (1/2 the amount required) with held from adding the tomatoes w/ green chilies, in stead I added Picante Medium - Chunky Salsa (16 oz). It was great, especially if you love spicy foods,it tasted pretty good as a left over(if you don't mind the look of eating wet dog food). My boyfriend didn't think it was the best, but his roommate loved it.

I love this, but I do change some things. I only use one pound of meat, and I sub ground turkey. I increase the olives, and decrease the refried beans to one can. This always seems better the next day....my husband suggested that I make it a day in advance from now on.

Great tasting, filling meal.  I reduce everything by half and add taco seasoning to the ground beef.  I wouldn't say this is really spicy. It depends on what type of taco sauce you use.

I just made this tonight for my husband and 5 children.  They loved it.  My husband had thirds.  I made my own taco sauce using tomatoe sauce and some spices.  I also used taco seasoning when cooking my meat.  I baked this in a 9x13 inch pan and we topped it with sour cream.  I'll definitely make this again.

This is a very flavorful dish! You can adjust the heat by the taco sauce you chose, we usually go for mild. We always half the recipe and use a round pyrex container to cook it in. The other half of the ingredients get sealed in a glad container for a few days till we're ready to make it again.

We really enjoyed this!  I've had burrito pie before and it wasn't nearly as flavorful.  I used slow cooked shredded beef instead of ground beef, and added jalapenosand extra cheese, and ended up only using 3 layers of tortillas instead of 4, and only about 1 1/2 cans of the refried beans.  Also did not mix the beans in, just spread it on each layer before the beef mixture.  Will make again.

I usually have no luck finding recipes my family will agree on. This recipe worked, my husband and kids absolutely loved it and are already asking for me to make it again. They even ate the leftovers the next day. It does make alot so you can cut it in half. I used jalepenos instead of green chili peppers and I used 3 cups of Cheddar cheese instead of Colby. We like cheese! Will be making it again real soon.

Good recipe...not too spicy...makes a lot!! Really good topped with salsa and sour cream. I think it would be even better, if there were some Mexicorn added to the mix and top it with avocado! Even my two year-old loved it.

very easy and tasty to make. I enjoyed the simplicity of using one saute pan to basically cook everything,then just tranfer into a baking pan. I would call it more a mexican lasagna. very good will make again.I can see my self using chicken maybe for a different variation.

Really delicious and easy to make. I was very impressed by this recipe and so was my family. Makes great leftovers too. I served with shredded lettuce, sour cream and tortilla chips. This is top of my list of favorites right now.

This was very good, and very easy. The ingredients are mostly things I have on hand at all times. My husband was suspicious of it at first but when I told him what was in it, he tried it and was pleasantly surprised. It is a good family casserole, not something I would feed to company. It would also be really good for a Mexican-themed potluck. This is easy to make in advance and reheat. Also, if you let it set for a little while, it slices neatly. The only change was that I didn't put in the olives. No one in my family is that crazy about them. We will be seeing this one at the dinner table again, with some mixed vegetables or salad.

Great recipe! I left out the olives because my husband doesn't like them and it was wonderful. My inlaws loved it as well and it's hard to make something that impresses them. Thanks for this recipe. It is definitely a favorite now in my household =)

I was just positive I was going to love this but I just didn't.  My kids wouldn't eat it at all.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was just sort of blah.  The mixture needs some work.  I think next time I will half the recipe for sure!  It makes a huge amount.  I will use taco meat and just spread the refried beans on the tortillas as suggested by others.  I served it with chopped tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream and cheddar cheese.

This was really easy and a hit for my husband and some friends.  I used one can of black beans and one can of refried since I didn't have two cans of refried.  I also added some jalapeno and green onions to spice it up a bit.  It's a great midweek meal.  We'll definitely use it again, thank you!

This was a big hit at our house.  I used both flour and corn tortillas in alternating layers. I added fresh cilantro (about 1/2 cup, chopped) and about 1 tsp cumin in the meat/bean mixture.

This was pretty good, definitly did not look pretty when it was lifted onto plates! I did spread the beans on the tortilla shells like others suggested and not in with tomamtoes/peppers. Also cut the recipe in half and had plenty. Was quick and easy.

I made this recipe tonight and it was okay.  I also halved the recipe, but forgot to half the jar of salsa, but it didn't make much difference.  I added some crumbled tortilla chips as someone else did and I felt this made it better wiht some crunchiness to it.  Not sure what anyone is meaning by spicy.  This was so not spicy.  I left out the tomatoes.  Felt it would have been to "tomato-ey".  I also used two full flour tortillas as the base, meat, tortilla chips and cheese, then repeated this, though mixed up flour and corn tortillas since I ran out.  It still came out fine.  Wouldn't give it a 5 star rating.  Adding sour cream to the finished result made it better along with some taco sauce.   Will try again though.

Very tasty! A little on the heavy side. Add a healthy vegetable or salad on the side and that helps to balance it out. Overall - great taste!

Very very good.  I used a can of drained pinto beans in place of one can of refried beans.  The whole tomatoes/taco sauce/green chiles seemed inefficient so I tossed out all that and added a 16 oz. jar of salsa instead.  I sauced it up with about 1/3 cup Marsala wine to the meat while browning.  I swear, other than that it was exactly as you suggested!  Served with lettuce on the side, this was fabulous stuff.  Quite filling and made plenty.

I loved this. I happened to have a bowl about the size of my tortillas and that worked perfectly to make this in. Maybe not your most classy meal to serve to guests but for a easy family meal, it was great!

Very good recipe.  There's a lot of room for flexibility with this recipe.  For the sake of my digestive track, I omit the can of chili peppers as I think the recipe is spicy enough without it.  I use less cheese, ground turkey, and fat free refried beans for a lower calorie version and it's still very tasty.

I made this for my boyfriend and brother-in-law. They both loved it and have since requested that I make it again. I severed it on top of shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, sliced green onions, salsa and sour cream.

This is soo good and very easy. I reduced the recipe to 4 servings and followed it to the letter.  It turned out wonderfully.  I reccomend letting is cool down for a few minutes before serving to give it time to set.

I was expecting spicy from other reviewers, but it was not.  I will add some HOT SAUCE next time.  I will also use GREEN ONIONS next time. I will definately make this again.  My husband ate half of the pan!

The whole family liked this recipe, but we all agreed it would be better if it were tweaked a little.  We thought more of the onion, green chili peppers, cheese, and beef would make it fantastic.

Even my somewhat picky teenage son loved this.  We didn't think it was that spicy, though.  I cut this in half for a family of four and baked in a 1 1.5 qt round casserole dish.

We really liked this. I made it in the a.m.,refrigerated it then cooked it about 50 min at 350. I drained the canned tomatoes then added in a little juice as I needed. We ate it with lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream. I cut the recipe in half.

8/2019 - made the full recipe of beef and added corn, made up one pie and froze the rest of the meat.  Added homemade taco seasoning to the meat and used about 1 can of refried beans, otherwise tasted great and cooked up nicely. 
 AH and ZB didn't love it, but SH and I did.  4/29/2008 - Very easy and delicious!  Makes a lot!  I've made this twice now - the 2nd time I halved the recipe.  Very good, easy to make and yummy!  I only gave it 4 stars because it's kinda bland - I added in some taco seasoning when cooking the meat and next time would use a medium salsa and taco sauce.

This is a wonderful dish that your whole family can enjoy!  Not too many dishes to clean up either.  I usually serve mine with chopped lettuce and tomatoes to surround each slice, seasoned with salt and pepper, and maybe a little salsa.  I, too, add sour cream (sometimes salsa) on top of the serving.

Yummy!  I tried this last night with a few modifications - we had some ground venison which I subsituted for the ground beef and I altered the portions a bit, but WOW!  I kept the taco sauce to the mild variety and made sure to use just a bit to top each layer of the dish rather than putting it into the filling.  My husband (who doesn't care for mexican food) loved it!  This one's a keeper - hot, quick and satisfying, one helping's enough.

I love Mexican food, and this recipe is at the top of my favorites.  I misread the recipe, and only used 1/2 the amount of taco sauce.  I think I would keep this mistake in the future as the consistency turned out perfectly.  I did add a couple of dashes of ground red pepper, and a few shakes of the hot sauce to the meat mixture, but I love spicy.  The recipe as it stands is probably spicy enough for most.

My boyfriend will not let a week go by without mentioning burrito pie! Allthough I realized after the first time making it that it needs a big dish to cook it in, I put it in 2 casserole dishes now, and my boyfriend eats 1 all by himself. Thanks a bunch,this recipe is soo good!

i really enjoyed this dish, so did my husband. i read other reviews and people said it was bland and the torts ended up soggy.  that didnt happen at all. it all depends on the bands you put into it, it can be as spicy or mild as you like depending on what taco sauce you put in it.  i'll make it again

I chose this because it really does make for a huge meal, perfect for a dinner party consisting of a few hungry alpha males. I substituted salsa for the taco sauce, which I couldn't find anywhere. It went over very well, although it certaintly wasn't spicy at all. It is, however, a great treat for meat lovers, and I received requests for the recipe.

Oh My ...this was sooooo good!  My entire family loved it and normally when I make a dish this large, I have to freeze the other half...not with this one!  Everyone took it to work the next day for leftovers.  This is definately a repeat recipe.  My husband is already asking when I will make it again!

AWESOME!
I made it the other night and my wife and I were ranting and raving about how good it is. I didn't put refried beans because I forgot to get them when I went to the store...but it was still amazing.

To much work without an extraordinary return! I was expecting much more than this recipe had to offer. The flavor of it was good, don't get me wrong, however the first bite wasn't one of those moments where you think, "This is the best thing I've tasted in a long time." That's what I look for in a 5-star recipe!

This was delicious. My son loved it. My family thought it was like the mexican pizza you get from Taco Bell, only thicker and more flavorful. Will make again. Only, if you have a small family you might want to make a smaller batch. This recipe makes a lot, unless you like a lot of leftovers.
I have a family of four and we ate it for two days plus we took some to work. Very Yummy!!!

Love this, made it first a few months ago and have made it again, altering it as to what I had in the house.  Last time I used shredded chicken cooked up with some taco seasoning and used black beans instead of refried, love it both ways. I also used corn tortillas with the chicken instad of flour and it was still great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I did knock this recipe down to half for my family of three and my husband doesn't like refried beans but he likes regular cooked pinto beans so I used whole beans instead of refried and I used stewed tomato and 1 can of tomato paste
and home-made folour tortillas right on the money

This was WONDERFUL!  I made a mistake in not using all of the tortillas...you almost have to double them up if you are using the large ones.  I think it would have been even better if I had used all 12.  I topped it with sour cream... YUM! New family favorite!

I made this for my weekend guests.  It was a big hit.  I added red pepper and chipotle seasoning to the ground beef for some extra spice.  We decided that next time I make it I'm going to add some sweet corn as well.

I really loved this recipe. I switched only two things, I did not add olives--unfortunatly for me, the family hates them and I used 'Pace mexican creations mild taco cooking sauce'.  I was afraid that the tortillias would get mushy but they didn't. 2 thumbs up from me!

All I can say is Wow!  This is one of my stand-bys!  Once it's done, we add sour cream on top then serve.  My husband loves it, and so does our toddler!  Beware, it will clean you out!!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!!

This was a pretty good recipe.  I think next time I will season the meat, but I loved that I had plenty of left-overs that reheated pretty well.

We all really enjoyed this. I do make a Mexican casserole that is similiar, but this is less time consuming, so much better for weeknight meals.
Thanks for sharing!

My husband loves spicy food, I'm not quite so keen on it, but we both loved this dish. Made a half recipe since the original is A LOT of food, but we polished it off pretty quickly.

Yummy!  Excellent! Just what I was looking for.  I used 1 pound of beef, 1 can of beans and half of the taco sauce.  I used the full amount of tomatoes and added a packet of taco seasoning!  Great when I made it and great the next day too!!!  Thanks!

This is a "Fabulous" recipe!!!! I substituted ground turkey for the beef....super easy to put together....my kids didn't detect the refried beans in it, they gobbled it up! I server w/sour cream, lettuce & tomatoes.....next time I will probably whip up a batch of guacamole to go with it! A++++++++++

I LOVE mexican food but I thought it was just "okay" and my boyfriend said to make it only once a year.  I cut the recipe in half but ended up adding the whole jar of taco sauce because it was dry & there wasn't enough of the mix to spread.  I suggest if you do cut it in half to go ahead & use the entire jar of taco sauce, black olives, green chili's & diced tomatoes, but still only use 1 can of the refried beans.  Also use at least 8oz. of cheese.  It didn't seem very spicy to me at all.

My husband hasn't stopped talking about how good it is since he took a bite two hours ago.  The only warning is that is makes SOOO much.  So make a half recipe or even a quarter.  Though, the leftovers are also great!

This is a great recipe.  It is good the first time you serve it and is just as good if not better as seconds.  It also freezes nicely.  I make a full recipe and freeze half for later.

I love this recipe! I made this for a church camping trip. I cooked it the day before we left then froze it. Not the easiest meal to reheat on a propane gril..lol.
This one of the first meals to go. I did make a few changes based on other reviews. Only 1 can of beand and about a third of a jar of salsa.
This is a keeper...thanks!

This is a keeper. I used low carb torillas and at free refried beans.  Still very tasty.  I didn't have any chilis in the pantry so I chopped up a few pickeled jalepenos - nice kick!

This is now a family favorite; it's a complete meal and easy to make.  I changed the recipe by using just 1 pound hamburg, 1 can refried beans, and 6 flour tortillas.  All the other ingredients remained the same. I also added a can of drained Mexicorn and 1 can of drained & rinsed black beans.  I served it with a dollop of sour cream.  Yummy!

I served this tonight for a dinner party...it makes alot! We have leftovers for another night which is good. I followed the recipe except for I only added one can of beans since my husband is not a bean fan. 
I did use alot more cheese than the recipe called for. I think 16 oz. of a mexican blend.
It looked like a mexican lasagna. Good recipe. :)

I made this last night for a family dinner and everyone loved it. I substituted ground turkey for the beef and added some cumin. I also made it in a 9 x 13 inch pan.  It turned out really well and I'll definitely make it again.

This recipe was fantastic! I halved the recipe and put it in an 8x8 square dish. It fit perfectly.  The flavor wasn't too spicy nor too mild.

Loved it!  Very easy, very tasty and very filling.  Kids were skeptical -- but became believers with the first bite.  Thanks for a great meal to add to the rotation!

This was a great, simple and quick recipe to make!  I made a few changes....I added On the Border salsa rather than taco sauce and used Rotel Extra Hot and Spicy rather than original which made it a little zestier and more of a bite!  I will make again!

I used one can of kidney beans and one can of refried beans.  It was a hit at my house.  The left overs are even better!

This is very easy and good recipe for company. Kids really like it. I have also used left over chicken or cooked up chicken breast in chicken broth and used them them and that is a big hit. 


I have also used cans of refried black beans for a change and leftover rice. Serve with a good salad and flour tortillas, sour cream and guacamole. Ummmmmmmmmm!

Easy to make and pretty good taste.  I left out the peppers to tame it down some.  I recommend using at least the number of tortillas suggested if not more.  (Filling is a little heavy without it.)

Excellent!! I did not have some of the ingredients so instead just added 1 jar of salsa, instead of taco sauce, peppers and olives. They were wonderful, my husband  requested I make it again :) ...thanks for the great recipe!

This was good, my family really liked it.  I thought it was way too heavy.  I'll make it again, for them, it's a good one for the kids, but not for myself.  I cut the recipe in half and it was still enough for 8++ people easy!

Soooo good!  Spicy, but not too spicy.  Had excellent flavor and texture.  Made fabulous left overs too.  I only used 1 can of the refried beans, since I'm not much of a bean eater.  It was perfect!

This is a keeper!  I'm a newlywed so I'm trying this cooking thing. Until now this is the first thing I've cooked that my husband really liked.  I too browned the tortillas first.  This helps them from being so soggy.  Thanks!

This is good.  I always nix the refried beans.  I prepare and serve in a round casserole dish, this way the tortillas fit perfectly atop the ingredients.

This was good, but not nearly what I would expect of a Hall of Fame recipe. It certainly fed a bunch and is a good starting point, but it seemed kind of flat, flavor-wise.  The only sub I made was corn for the olives.

Very good.  I didn't have refried beans so I used drained and slightly smashed black beans adding just a touch of garlic to them.

This recipe truly feeds a crowd.  I split the mixture into two casserole dishes for 2 meals.  It was really easy to make and tasted delicious.  My husband raved about it and I will definitely make this often.  I made a couple adjustments that really worked for our family.  I added a package of taco seasoning after the meat was browned and took off the extra grease.  I also was nervous about the "heat" of the recipe.  We love a good spicy dish and the ingredients looked harmless with the exception of the taco sauce.  I used half the jar of taco sauce, medium heat, and the rest medium heat salsa and it was just right..had a good kick, not overbearing for our taste.  I also found it needed more cheese than the 9oz Colby.  I used a 2c package of shredded Colby Jack and a 2c package of shredded cheddar. I may try it with ground chicken or turkey next time for a different twist. I can hardly wait to defrost the second serving for a future meal.  This recipe would be great for a pot luck.  Be sure to bring the recipe, because they will be asking for it.

We enjoy hot food but not so that you miss the taste. This was very good and it was eated all but one piece. My husband took this to work everyone loved it. Will make again and again. I did brown the flour tortilla. I added alittle more cheese on top.

A really good casserole, that is pretty easy to make, but does take a bit of time to get ready.  Next time I plan on making double the meat mixture and freezing some so that it can be put together quickly for dinner. I made some changes, used enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce and added an extra cup of salsa to the meat mixture to make it a bit "runnier".  Used one pound of low fat cheddar cheese, and low fat refried beans.  I have a really large casserole so I was able to make 2 "pies" or stacks of the tortillas which was then cut into 6ths.  I made one stack hotter by adding jalapenos for the more fiery people. It made 12 good sized meal portions, 16 portions would be kind of small.  Served with lettuce and low fat sour cream.  Will make it again. Thanks Kathi.

This is a pretty good recipe.  I may use enchilada sauce instead of taco sauce next time because it is a little spicy for my daughter.  It does make a lot but I was glad I didn't cut the recipe in half because this tasted better the second day.

DELICIOUS!! I used 16oz cheese, and blended types rather than colby. This was a huge portion, so I divided into a rectangular casserole dish and a round one. I added jalepinos rather than black olives. Caution: this makes it even hotter! I would definitely recommend!

This has become a favorite in our house.  I've made it several times cutting the recipe in half, but will begin making the full recipe so there will be more leftovers.

UPDATE: I've started substituting low carb soft tortillas in this recipe and don't notice any difference.  With the beans, this is still not a low carb recipe, but it does add even more fiber.  I like this best topped with shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes for some crunch and color.

I make a few mods to the recipe, but it provides a good starting point. I use black beans, veg. refried beans, 2 jars of taco sauce, add diced jalepenos, cook the ground beef in taco seasoning, double the green chili, and add some additional spices -- crushed Chipotle really puts this over the top.

Totally awesome!  My son-in-law who is not a Mexican food eater really loved this and actually ate two helpings!  I didn't change a thing to this recipe other than adding some hot taco sauce to the meat mixture to make it spicier.  This is definitely a keeper!

This was a good recipe and my family enjoyed it. I just felt like it was lacking something.  Maybe some rice or something.  I will make it again and maybe try adding some spanish rice to it.

Great flavor, and excellent versatility.  The meatbean mixture freezes well, and I've used the mixture with nachos, as taco filling, and burrito filling.

Delicious. I used jalapenos instead of chilis and it was quite spicy, but we loved it! I also used sharp cheddar instead of colby, and that was perfect. Lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream would also be good, but it was excellent on its own too!

This was okay.  I will probably make again but use a different kind of cheese rather than colby.  I like colby cheese but not in this.  I will probably try a Colby-Jack mixture or something next time.

I made this recipe earlier tonight as I was making dinner.  I plan on having the burrito pie for lunch tomorrow and decided to make it ahead.  It was an easy recipe to follow.  I didn't have all the chilis and taco sauce the recipe called for so I made some substitutions:  To the ground meat mixture after browning, I added diced green peppers, a can of diced tomatoes (undrained), a small can of sliced olives (drained) and a packet of taco seasoning.  I used this as my meat mixture and followed the rest of the recipe.  I'm sure it will turn out since I stuck with the familiar mexican flavors.  When done, I plan on serving it with tortilla chips and a dollop of sour cream.  YUM!  I can't wait until lunch tomorrow!

Excellent.  I omitted the olives and added more cheese then topped with sour cream before baking.  It was great.  Next time I will use rotel without chilis since it was a little too spicy for my family.  I will definately make this recipe again.

This recipe is a hit in our house, and I have taken the basic recipe and modified it a bit. In the meat mixture I like to add a little bit of chipotle, and then layer sliced avacado, refried beans (I don't mix them into the meat mixture), black olives and spanish rice. I know how to make it without looking at the  recipe now and it is always a requested favourite by my husband and his family!

Excellent--made this when I had out of town guests--it was so good that we had the leftovers the next day instead of making a new dish.  I used medium Pace Picante Sauce and that really made it spicy.  Great Recipe.

I was not that impressed with this recipe.  It did seem like something you would get from Taco Bell.  I would suggest adding some Velveeta cheese to a few layers of the Burrito Pie.

Very Good!  I cut the recipe in half and recommend that if you do that - use a smaller casserole dish than 4 qt.  I doubled up on tortillas in the layers and had no problems with them getting mushy.

Very nice, fed five hungry kids in their early 20's and still had over half left.  I added a few extra peppers to increase the heat.  Outside of that, I think a layer of tortilla's on the bottom would make it less messy.  Overall it was very tasty and I would highly recommend giving it a try.

THIS RECIPE WAS DELICIOUS! HOWEVER I DID NOT FIND IT TO BE VERY SPICY. I FEEL THE MEAT MIXTURE NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE MORE FLAVORFUL AND YOU NEED MORE CHEESE THAN IT CALLS FOR. BETTER THE NEXT DAY ALSO. GREAT RECIPE.

Great flavor, although my tortillas turned to mush.  It almost seemed like we were eating tacos with no shell - all meat.  I might try to double up the tortillas next time.  I will make this again, but I will work on the tortillas.

The appearance of the filling was unappetizing; the consistency was pasty, and the taste was a little bitter from excess chili.

Easy to make and very, very good.  Leftovers reheat nicely the next day too.  Rather than Burrito Pie I call this Mexican Lasagna.

This recipe had a good taste to it but was a bit runny... more like eating a thick soup.  Will make it again but with some modifications.

Absolutely AMAZING!  I can't even find words to express how good this is! So much easier than everyone assembling their own burrito too.  Much less messy for everyone and even better flavor!  Thanks for this awsome recipe!

This was really quick to put together and it tasted good.  I used enchilada sauce in place of the taco sauce and left out the black olives since I didn't have any.  Lunch was ready in under 30 minutes.  Thanks for sharing Kathi.

This recipe is fantastic! I used one can of regular refried beans and one can of spicy refried beans for the perfect heat. Next time I make it I will toast the tortillas before baking to make them more firm.

I've made this 3 times. I like this twist on the usual lasagna, and the idea of using tortillas instead of having to boil lasagna noodles. A good one to take to a potluck.

I had tried this recipe on my family.  They really liked it..Both adults and children complitmened me on the Burrito Pie.."Grandma, I like it",says my 2 and 4 year old grandaughters.I used the traditional beans because I didn't want it too hot for my grandaughter. Also, do use the 4-qt. dish. In one of the reviews, they used a smaller one. DON'T change the size of pan using this full recipe.  I didn't have the tomatoes but did serve with leaf lettuce.sour cream and extra sauce....A Winner!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was just TERRIFIC. I have a very hard time making everyone in my family happy with the same meal (my husband and two boys ages 15 and 8. This pleased everyone. No complaints from anyone. Everyone went back for seconds this is very unusual in my house that EVERYONE went back. I have very big eaters so I did not halve this recipe. I have enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow and thats it. I didn't change much other than I used corn instead of flour tortillas and I also put taco seasoning in my hamburger when it was browning I didn't add any water. The great thing about this is you could make this as hot or as mild as you would like. I served this with salsa and sour cream. Thank you for posting this recipe it was just great.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish.  I substituted a can of Jalapeno Relish for the taco sauce, which brought the heat level up quite a bit.  I also used more cheese (shredded cheddar since that's what I had on hand) since I am a cheese lover.  I used pre-browned ground beef from my freezer, which meant that prep time was minimal-- I just simmered the ingredients about 10-12 minutes and then layered them in the casserole dish.

Spicy!  Hubby really likes this recipe.  He said if he could have this he would never go to taco bell again.  I thought it was good too.  I took the advice from some of the other reviews and used 1 can of black beans, reduced the taco sauce in half, added a few jalapenos, left out the onion and added a packet of taco seasoning. OK so I changed it a little, but I knew I would like these tastes together.  I think I would have been wonderful without the changes too.

This recipe was great. My husband loved it. It makes a lot but it didn't get wasted. We ate it several times for leftovers. It was just as good two days later as it was the first time. I'm permanently adding this to my recipe box.

Oh wow, this was awesome!  Let's see... changes I made... I halved the recipe and served it in a 9x13 inch pan.  I used 3/4 can of olives, 1/2 can of green chiles, 1/2 can tomatoes with green chiles, 3/4 can of refried beans, and more cheese than was called for.  I used about 3/4 package of taco seasoning mix and substituted about 8 oz. salsa for taco sauce.  Also sprinkled a bit of ground cumin in the meat mixture.  All of my seasonings were mild, as I have young kids.  Took this to a church pot-luck and the dish was scraped clean in no time!!  Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe is great, and easy! I have a hard time getting my 3 year old girl to eat anything with meat in it. She asked me for seconds! My husband and I were shocked, she doesn't asked for seconds of anything! Thank you so much for this recipe.

I liked this but my husband liked it better.  I'm just not a big ground beef fan.  I think I might try steak tips or chicken next time. :)

This dish was easy to prepare and I thought it tasted ok except for the fact that the tortillas were a little soggy for my liking. I left out the chili and put in mild taco sauce so that my children ages 3 and 11 could eat it. They didn't seem to care for it much.

I made this recipe for a Mexican fiesta, and everyone raved about the recipe.  I used the refried beans recipe on this site (Fat Free Refried Beans).  This was definitely a keeper, everyone raved about it.  This is the type of recipe you can use approximate portions for the recipe.  Except for the cans of diced tomatoes, chili peppers, I approximated everything else.  And, it turned out great!!!!

Very good.  I didn't cook the onions long enough, so they were a little crunchy for my taste.  I will make this recipe again.

Even better the next day!  I served this with sour cream on the side as well.  It makes a lot, but if you don't mind leftovers...and what busy woman can pass up a night off from cooking?...then make as directed.  Otherwise, use your judgement and scale accordingly.

This was pretty good. I forgot to read the reviews first, though. Next time I will fry the tortillas first and use double-layers, so it holds up better. Other than that, the recipe was quite yummy!

Easy to make ahead and refrigerate until ready to bake.  We have made it a little different each time with seasonings and such.  Love the variety that we do and it always turns out perfect.  Thanks!

If I could I would give this one 10 stars.I have never been big on this kind of food but hubby is so I tried it and loved it so did the kids. I didnt have the diced tomatoes with green chilles so I used diced tomatoes with garlic was still delicious. One thing though I didnt get why they say it is hot or even spicy mine wasnt maybe I didnt get the right something.

Good recipe, but nothing spectacular.  My husband says it tasted like goulash with tortillas.  :)  My kids wouldn't take more than one bit, though, so we probably won't make it again.

We loved it.  I halfed the recipe and used 1/2 can refried & 1/2 black bean, also used a package of taco seasoning with beef and omitted the green chili peppers but used a whole can of the tomatoes w/peppers and used corn chips rather than tortillas and 8 oz of taco cheese.  My husband went back for 3rds, which he rarely does.  You've got to try it!!

Wow!  I have been looking for a recipe to impress my new family (got married to a man with 3 teenagers and  have one of my own).  This recipe definitely made points for me.  I did change it some however, I added a can of whole corn(drained), a can of black beans (drained) and reduced the refried beans to 1 can.  Everyone says to make this again.  Thanks.

This was good, and different than what I would usually make. My six year old had seconds, and that is saying something! You will definitely want to garnish this with sour cream, also, I agree with another review that suggested serving with corn chips. I made it as is, but I  think next time I will sneak some more veggies in (you can camoflage a lot with this recipe!) Maybe corn and green pepper?

This turned out really good! It was simple although it took a little time, it was certainly worth it.  The textures and flavors were "just right" even though I didn't have any ripe olives at the time, which I would have loved.

I made this for a Memorial Day picnic and everyone loved it!  Next time I would add more cheese and follow the suggestions of only 1 can of beans.  I didn't think it was that spicy.  I think I'll also add jalapenos nex time.

This was great!! My boyfriend made it for dinner, and I loved it. My only suggestion is that it needs something crunchy...some corn chips on the top perhaps? It is great.

This was pretty good! I followed previous advice and used only 1 can of refried beans,added cilantro,and taco seasoning. I kicked in some chopped jalopenos and used hot taco sauce so it was nice and spicy like we like it.The family loved this. We will definately make this at least once a month.

My family and I loved this recipe. I never found it spicy though. I guess because I uses La Restaurante Salsa Original. It is very flavourful but not hot. I will defiantly make this again.

Thank you Kathi!!! I had been in a cooking slump and I think your recipe put me back into my family's good graces!  My husband actually raved about it at work! Didn't get to try it out on my 7 year old, because leftovers were gone for lunch the next day!  This recipe was so easy and a lot less messier than putting together your own burritos.  Will definately make again and again!

Very good!  I halved the recipe because it is only me and my husband and used a 9 X 13 pan and it came out wonderful!  I also used more cheese than the recipe called for.  Thank you!

Really Great, we don't like refried beans so we used 2 cans of Hot Chili Beans drained.. Adds more body to the Meat Filling this way. I have also used Corn Tortillas instead of flour.. Good Too. We make this often.

Excellent recipe!  Thank you for sharing.  Made it for my husband and myself for dinner and it made SO much that we wound up eating off of it for 3 days!  Will definatly make it for company next time.  Wouldn't change a thing about the recipe!

Fantastic!  It is very much like lasagna, but even my picky fiance who hates lasagna liked this.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipes was so easy to make.  However, it was a little bit too spicy for me.  My mouth was on fire the whole time.  It was filling and I had lots of leftovers for lunch.  Overall, I thought it was good.  Next time, I may halve the taco sauce and leave out the can of diced green chilli peppers since there are peppers in the tomatoes.

A wonderful dish.  I added 16 oz sour cream to the mixture before layering.  Very spicey and with a good kick to it.  Hubby loves it.  Served it at a party last night and it was a great hit.  It makes a hugh cassarole, but I have 3 tennage sons and it's just enough us for 2 nights. Will make again!!!

Yummy! Made for Super Bowl and it was a hit! Didn't find it at all spicy, even after adding a packet of burrito seasoning. I'll probably add cumin and a dash of cayenne next time. I do suggest adding fresh cilantro to each layer.  I bought double the cheese and ran out.

This would be good for a party, but for dinner it just didn't do it for us. Also, there are a lot of ingredients to buy, none expensive, but it does add up, so this is not a budget stretching casserole. I might make this again if I was throwing a party, but I don't think it will grace our dinner table again.

VERY GOOD! Similar to Mexican Lasagne recipe. Didn't use the diced tomatoes and we aren't tomato people. Used taco sauce/enchilada sauce mixture to my taste. Can be used as a appetizer as a dip. Thanks for sharing

This was okay.  I wasn't totally impressed with it like everyone else seemed to be.  It was good, but not fantastic.  It was not that spicy, and I would definately recommend sour cream on the side.

My husband didn't like the idea of eating this like a lasagna so I used the recipe to make regular burritos instead.  It worked out great!!  I made the mixture, filled the soft shells with the mixture (and some spanish rice) and stuck it in the oven for about 15 minutes with cheese over the top.  It was great and it made great leftovers!

This is a great dish if like mexican food. It is very easy to fix and my family and I love it. It is also a big hit at family get-togethers. And another thing, this recipe is perfect, no need to adjust anything except the chili peppers if you don't like alot of heat.

My dh and I liked this and so did my 2 year old, but my 7 year old hated it.  He's pretty picky, though.  It's not a fast recipe, but it was fun to have to shake up the usual menu.

My family loved this.  I did the mild version.  I did not add the chili peppers and I used mild taco sauce.  It was great!

This recipe was absolutely fantastic!  Since I'm only cooking for 2, I cut the recipe in half.  We topped it off with a little sour cream which was terrific.  I will definitely make this again.

I was happy to find this recipe.  I made half and it was more than enough for 4 of us.  I added the taco seasoning per other suggestions, used diced tomatoes with jalopenos and made a few other adjustments for what I had on hand.  We all loved it.

My husband and I felt this was a good recipe.  I also added 1/2 pack of taco seasoning but next time I will use a whole pack because I felt it needed more flavor.  I also added about 1 cup of white rice leftover from chinese takeout.  We thought this was a good addition.  I used corn tortillas instead of white which I think gives it a more authentic flavor.  Used a 14.5 oz can of tomatoes instead of 10 oz.  I used 1 can of refired beans and 1 can of black beans, drained.  Added more cheese too.  Will make this again.

This is a great recipe. I actually doubled the cheese and added some tabasco sauce to spice it up even more. It makes a ton. We have a family of 4 and it made it through three meals and still had some leftovers for my daughter's lunch.

I made this for dinner tonight...everybody loved it!  The recipe made way more than I could use so I cut it in half to feed 5 hungry people.  I used the original 9 oz of cheese to give it an extra cheesy taste.

This was great! I did do a few changes though. I reduced the amount of meat to 1 pound and used lean ground turkey instead. In place of the tomatoes I used a 16 oz. jar of medium salsa and an 8 oz. jar of taco sauce. I cut the amount of cheese to 6 oz and used pepperjack cheese instead. Nice and spicy and full of flavor. I've already printed the recipe out. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

I made this yesterday and it was very good. But after reading all the reviews i decided i better listen to people and spice it up a bit. I added only 1/2 c extra spicy chunky salsa,threw in a packet of taco mix, and WHOA! WAS IT HOT. Be very careful people, it doesn't take much to put this one over the top. Thank goodness my family loves the hot stuff. I had to really souse mine with sour cream. Will definetly make again,WITH CAUTION!

This is a good recipe. I had to adjust some of the ingredients because the tortillas become a little too soggy in the center when following it, but other than that it was good! Don't make too much, though! It is very filling!

This recipe is wonderful. The first time I made I scaled the recipe down to 3.5 servings and it was perfect for my husband and I along with several servings of leftovers - which we didn't mind since the recipe was so great. Great for get togethers.

It was very good; just a little spicy for my 4yr old but the rest of us loved it.  I added corn to it since that is my husband's favorite and topped it with sour cream as suggested.  It did make a lot so I used two 9x9 pans and froze one to reheat in the near future.  Great recipe!!

while the authors say this is hot - I found it very mild -to spice it up a little, I added sliced jalapenos on the top - you could substitute hotter chiles or taco sauce if so inclined - otherwise was easy and good tasting and even the kids liked it.

I made this recipe for my family, and my parents and I enjoyed it, but my brother and sister did not even want to try it because they are picky eaters. I would definitely make this again, just a smaller portion than the original recipe.

Loved it!  Made it for a group and was asked for the recipe by many.  I used 
ground turkey instead of the beef, a fresh jalapeno instead of canned chiles,
added cumin and a Mexican seasoning blend.  Wonderful!  Top with sour cream,
green onions.  Husband loved it as well.

My family loved this!  We used salsa instead of taco sauce and ground turkey instead of beef.  I also used a 13 X 9 inch pan.  My only suggestions: Make sure you have a LARGE skillet (mine wasn't big enough). If you use a 13 X 9 inch pan,put four tortilla shells to a layer (I had 3 left over).  And, make sure you are feeding an army (LOL).  It definetely makes a lot!

Very good....even better the next day.  Not as spicy as I like.  In fact, I added about 1/2 pkg of taco seasoning to the meat mixture.  Served with guacamole, salsa and sour cream.  Will make again....by the way, if this recipe serves 7 people, they must be 7 VERY hungry people!

SUPER -easy and delicious.  My family really enjoyed this dish.  I inadvertantly used Salsa instead of taco sauce and it was great.  Next time
though I'll use taco sauce and then decide which is better.  Don't be afraid to try Salsa - I used medium.

This was very good.  It looked too big for a 13x9 so I used an 11x15, I have no idea how many quarts that is (recipe says 4 qt dish).

This was wonderful. Quick and easy. I left out all the hot stuff (and the olives since I dislike them) and added extra diced tomatoes to make it very mild. Added sour cream when I served it.  What a hit. Great dish to take to a party.

Tastes even better the second day.  I plan to place meat mixture in shells and bake with green chilies and cheese on top.  I think meat mixture would be good in corn tortillas like enchiladas.

I rated this 4 stars a few years ago, but after trying the recipe 3-4 times and tonight for a Cinco de Mayo gathering, I'm dropping my review. The recipe makes 4-5 times the amount of a typical pie recipe, so make more or quadruple the recipe. Plus, it's too tart.

This was good but I thought it needed something...I would definitely make it again but not put in as much refried beans.  It could be because I used fat free refried beans.  I'll have to try it again. I was expecting too much.

I changed this recipe slightly when I realized I didn't have enough stuff on hand to make the full recipe.  Instead of baking it in a casserole, I just used the meat mixture as my burrito filling.  After making the burritos, I arranged them in a baking dish, sprinkled a little cheese on them, and baked them til the cheese was melty.  SO SO GOOD!  I will definately make this again.  It would be great if you were having people over to "make their own burrito" night!

i made a few adjustments to this recipe by adding about double the cheese and also adding about 1T of cummin powder i used large tortias so it only took about 5 1/2 instead of 12 and i ommited the chiles as we dont like anything too hot

Great and easy recipe.  I love this mexican dish and you can make it as spicy as your family wishes.  We will definitely make this one on a regular basis.  My husband and kids (6 and 3) say this one is a keeper.  :)

This is a great dish! It wasn't at all too hot for us.  Adding the taco seasoning made it much tastier.  I am tempted to make it more than I should.

An excellent dish.  You can't go wrong, you can substitute as I did, salsa for tomatoes, and I used only 6 tortillas and it was still wonderful.  I also added a can of corn (drained) You cant' miss with this one.  Go for it!

Great tasting but the presentation wasn't that great.  Next time I will omit the tortillas and use the filling for burritos.

To increase the taste of the beef, additional spices and garlic were added.  To make it less spicy, I decreased the pepper amount and used medium taco sauce. Kids loved it and it freezes well.

this recipe is just the best! very easy
and very good! it probably would be too hot
if i used the can of green chili peppers so i didn't. instead i just used the can of tomatoes
w/ the green chile peppers in that and i used
salsa. i did only make 1/2 the recipe and it made
a full 9 x 13 pan size. excellent and i will make it again thanks!

Even picky eaters liked it!  I omitted the olives and onions, and used only one can of beans, and it still turned out great.  This is one of our favorite meals now.

I didn't really enjoy this recipe.  After reading so many rave reviews I was expecting it to be outstanding and it wasn't.  I think it's me and not liking mexican lasagna.  My family loved it, goes to show you how much I know.  Don't think I'll make it again.

My family and friends really enjoyed this recipe.  I used the new liquid taco seasoning  instead of the taco sauce and it gave it a little spicer taste.

I made this for my Son's high school golf team and they loved it. One young man wanted the recipe to give his mom. 

The recipe made a large amount, it was inexpensive and took little time to prepare.

Very tasty and filling.  It was a lot of ingredients so use your largest frying pan.  I needed a salad to accompany it to round out the meal.  I also used mild taco sauce so there was no fear of being too hot/spicy.

As I love spicy foods, this one needs some canyan pepper big time.  It was easy to make and fast, but, you must add some spice any way you can...  Spice it up and it will be fine, but add some spice!!!

My kids didn't like this, but they don't like much of anything. They are so picky. I thought this had a very good flavor. Next time though, I will let it sit a spell after I take it from the oven. It needs time to sit up.

This was a really easy recipe and my whole family liked it.  I added a little bit of taco seasoning to the beans to give them a little extra flavor.

This recipe was a BIG hit! I added a little twist and served the pie on another tortilla, burrito style. It went over BIG TIME!

Very yummy!!  I made this for company and they loved it.  I did not find it too hot but I used both medium and mild taco sauce.  Also could only find a package of 10 tortilla but it still worked.  This has become a family staple, though I will half the recipe for just me and my husband.  It makes a ton!!

Yum - I made this the lazy way and cut it in half - I used 1.25 lbs ground turkey and after it was browned I added a package of burrito seasoning, one can of refried beans, one 14 oz can diced tomatos with mild green chilis and 1/2 cup of my favorite salsa.  It wasn't too spicy and turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!

I really don't "like" to cook so I look for very simple, dump-it-in-the-pan kind of recipes and this one fit the bill !!  My family was very impressed.  They actually thought I was in the kitchen for hours making this dish...hahaa

We made this last night for dinner, it was a definate winner. Just enough spice, great 'burrito' texture, and great combination of flavors. A definite 'keeper!'  :)

My kids liked it, but my husband didn't.  I'll probably make it again, but just for the kids.

A wonderful recipe, but WAY too hot... and I've grown up with hot, spicey foods.  Just lay off the hot ingredients a bit, and it's fabulous!  Definitely easy, and it's even better the second day!

Used extra lean ground turkey instead of ground beef.  Even better the next day!
