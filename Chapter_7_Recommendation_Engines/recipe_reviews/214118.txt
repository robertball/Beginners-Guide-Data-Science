I love pot stickers and this was a great way to turn them into a meal.  It was super easy to make.  Just make sure your will eat it all because it doesn't save well. It was all gone when I made it!

This was pretty good and easy enough. If I were to make it again I think I would choose a different lettuce other than iceberg I think a cabbage mix or a broccoli slaw would do it more justice.
