This was fabulous. I made one with the hot sauce and one without for the kiddos and both turned out excellent. My husband ate the leftovers the next morning with eggs and said that the steak tasted even better.

Good recipe if you like the spice of tabasco but be as liberal with the lime juice as you are the tabasco to even out the flavors. And don't be too stingy with the spices but there is probably less need to reapply every time you turn the steak.

I stuck to the recipe exactly and it just doesn't replace grilled. I am the BBQ queen and this steak was tough and not good. I tired it because it's winter time and too cold to grill outside. My boyfriend said it was 'OK' so I gave this 3 stars but unfortunatly I won't make it again.:(

It was a bit salty for me but next time that will be easier to fix. All-in-all a great recipe.

These seasonings are the most delicious everr. The steaks were spicy and had that citrus kick from the lime. My husband said that it was the best steak that I have ever made. I put all of the seasonings in a cup and stirred them up with a spoon and sprinkled the seasonings on the steaks each time I turned them over. I served with rice broccoli and corn and poured the pan juices over the rice. I usually season with lawrys seasoning salt garlic powder pepper and zataran's creole seasoning. Delicious!

This was great!! I added a few more spices to the rub and cooked it on the grill instead of on the stove. I also added some red wine and mushrooms to the topping. My husband loved it!!

I might have done something wrong with this recipe but as far as I know I followed it to a tee. I would have to say I probably will not be making this again considering it was just too salty. Maybe someone can give me some pointers. Thanks Anna

I didn't do the gravy part since the meat it self was amazingly flavored!

We loved this. So easy and the seasoning was perfect not too spicy and not too bland. We has french bread with the steaks and actually "sopped" up the sauce. FANTASTIC RECIPE!

Great recipe! I needed something different for meat because grilling every night was getting old...only downside was the smoke it creates but that's not recipe's fault

I made this as a dare to myself because being the "grillmaster" I was sure it couldn't be as good as a grilled steak. The ingredients looked good so I gave it a try. It's a 5 star because I was wrong. Fantastic. Like the first reviewer I too poured the gravy all over my baked potatoe skin.

This truly exceeded my expectations! No time to marinate too cold to grill this recipe did a great job. Like another reviewer I mixed the flavorings together first and spooned onto the meat. Extra applications were not really needed. When the steaks were done I boiled down the juices before adding 1/2 stick of butter and about 1/4 cup water for the sauce. It was delicious spooned over the slices of steak. Thank you for the recipe!
