Super simple and this had good flavor but unless you like your split pea puree style, you'll need to reduce cook time. All of the veggies got overcooked for me. I like mine a little more chunky with some of the peas still visible. There was trace of carrots but even the celery disappeared. Next time I will either reduce cook time or else instead of letting the pressure natural release for 15 minutes I'll just do a quick release and get it out of the pot to stop the cooking process. The bacon was optional and I do not like wobbly bacon so I left it out of the IP but did cook some up and use it as a topping for each bowl. Overall good recipe and one I will make again with minor changes.

I do agree with the first review, it is thick, I doubled the broth and still was thicker than I like. The flavor was good, I did not use the bacon but did sautéed the veggies in saved bacon fat to give it that ham flavor. I would make it again cause the soup did have a great depth of flavor just too much of a paste consistency for my liking

Very simple and very good pea soup. I didn’t add bacon and was great without!

This recipe was good! The cook time could have been a little lower (maybe 15 minutes instead of 18) and I'd recommend frying the bacon first, but the flavor was exactly what I was looking for. I did add some diced ham as well.
