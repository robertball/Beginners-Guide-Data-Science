This is delicious!! Didn't try the rice dish but the Al Fresco sausage was awesome (and I substituted the onions for green peppers for the skewers.) The peppers in the sausage really brought the flavors all together; I've already made this twice, definitely a keeper!!

I just made the rice part and it was delicious.  Beautiful!  Homemade chicken broth is the key here. The chicken stock in a box just doesn’t cut it. It is beautiful, interesting and flavorful. I used golden raisins and homemade stock.

The sausage kabobs were ok.  The rice/orzo dish did not go over well.  Had exceptional difficulty getting the brown rice to cook in the mushroom/onion sauté.  Listed in the recipe to cook in 8 minutes, it took over an hour and a whole lot more broth to get the rice even close to cooking.  The extra cooking time took away some expected flavor.
