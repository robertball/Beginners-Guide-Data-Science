These cookies had good flavor but they were so chewy that they were hard to eat. I'm not sure if cooked the caramel-like mixture too long or not. I followed the directions exactly.

These were good and pretty easy if you have a candy thermometer. I think I will double the recipe next time because they didn't last long in my house and also because it was difficult to gauge the temperature of the cooked mixture in the pot because it was such a small amount of liquid. Also my chocolate chips never got fluid enough when melted to "drizzle". I even tried adding some butter to help them melt thin enough to drizzle. No luck. I ended up dabbing a hershey-kiss sized dollop on the top of each. Regardless they were delicious and the only thing missing to be like the girl scout cookie was the cookie layer. They really did remind me of those girl scout cookies which was what attracted me to this recipe in the first place. We enjoyed them very much.

These turned out pretty good a little dry I had expected them to be a little more fudge textured but I think was the expectation I had based on haystacks I had eaten at a social obviously the is not the same recipe. For what they are very good.
