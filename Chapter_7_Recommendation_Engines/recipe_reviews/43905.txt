I thought this was delicious! Based on the previous comments, I baked this cake for longer (40-45 mins) and used less streusel for the middle layer.  I really like the orange flavor of the cake.  It's pretty sweet, so I would even leave off the glaze.

I was not sure if I should attempt this recipe due to low ratings, but it looked like the kind I like, with no box ingredients etc.  I made it for my co-workers and it was a tremendous hit.  I thought it was excellent myself.  Not too much work, and a very nice orange flavor that I often don't bake with.   I got one complement that it was the best cake a girl had ever had.  So, I recommend trying it.  I am actually going to bake it again for another group of friends very soon!

The brown sugar melts and makes the cake mushy and it looks and even tastes raw.  I would never even attempt this cake again.

I was surprised when I read the review about how awful this coffeecake was as I have made it on many, many occasions and it has always turned out wonderful. It has a little coarser texture rather than cake like, but that's how a coffeecake should be.  I have also made this into mini bundt cakes and they have been wonderful.  I highly recommend this recipe!

After reading may reviews, I decided to add in some orange yogurt to combat some of the dryness that was an issue. I also added in some orange extract to up the orange flavor.  Even after those additions, it wasn't very "orangy".  Best eaten warm from the oven, as it tends to dry out quickly.  Not one I'm likely to re-do.

I found this to be coarse and dry.  I did increase the baking time slightly due to previous review.  Also, I found it to be a bit bland (and I even increased the orange peel).  I think basically a good flavor combination and I haven't given up on it - next time I will add a bit of sour cream, maybe some orange extract to pop the flavor a bit.  I was disappointed in the recipe as written, which is rare for this site.

What a great coffee cake!  I was afraid it would be too sweet with all the brown sugar in the streusel and the powdered sugar glaze, but it was perfect.  I didn't have an orange to zest, so I stirred in a can of drained mandarin oranges for added flavor and moisture.  Finally, I sprinkled toasted almonds over the top of the glazed cake for a pretty presentation.  I'd definitely make this cake again - it's a perfect addition to any brunch table!

This was an exceptional coffee cake.  This recipe will be added to make it often list.  The only change I did was to use only 1/2 cup of brown sugar, otherwise I followed it exactly.  It is wonderful with the glaze.  It IS a sweet coffee cake but then that's the way coffee cake should be.  Right?  I found that I had to bake it for 40 minutes, but everyone's oven is different.  I added some orage zest to the glaze too. Love this recipe.  For you doubters out there...try it, you'll like it!!!  I guarantee you'll get compliments.

This is a relatively easy recipe that is delicious and different. I agree with other reviewers that you could omit the glaze. Another option I tried was adding a touch of orange liqueur to the glaze recipe.

For the cake itself, I reduce the baking soda to 1/2 tsp with the 1 tsp baking powder. For the low amount of flour, you get a better action, not over-leavened. (Too much baking soda can give an odd taste, too.)

In preparing the streusel, I lightly toast the almond slices in a pan then let cool so they keep their crunch. I also add a 1/4 tsp of almond extract to enhance the flavor.

One other tip is that I used two fresh mandarin oranges for the zest. Each one is roughly 1 tsp, so one for the streusel and one for the cake.

This is an excellent coffee cake. I’ve made it several times, and it always comes out moist and delicious. Follow the directions exactly. Use the right pan or you may have to cook it longer to finish the center, which will make it dry. It’s my go-to cake at the moment. Tons of complements. Great orange and almond flavor. Distinctive.

Used fresh OJ and lots of zest. Moist and flavorful. Added extra zest to glaze and sliced almonds on top for presentation. Bake closer to 40 minutes in regular bundt pan.

This coffee cake came out fantastic!  I didn't have almonds so I just made my own streusel one cup of brown sugar 1 cup of flour a quarter cup of butter and 1 teaspoon of orange zest. I'll definitely be making this again. ??

This cake turned out really nice.  I've made it 3 times now, and found that a little cinnamon and 1/2 cup of buttermilk added a lot of flavor and moisture.  This one is a keeper.  :-)
