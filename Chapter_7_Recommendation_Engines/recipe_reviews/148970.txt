This is sooooo good--here's a little tip from an old German lady--It's ok to use 2-3 Tbs of water in place of the canola oil for cooking the kielbasa,(kielbasa is already greasy) onions, and brussel sprouts, just keep an eye on it and add more water as it evaporates--the onions will still sweeten up and carmelize cooked in water.

I have a slight variation of this dish, and use it as a main dish. Marinate the brussel sprouts, onions and kielbasa with the seasonings listed, but add chopped garlic and mushrooms. Bake in the oven until the brussel sprouts are to your liking. YUM!

This was a really odd, but really good combination.  I served it with egg noodles as a previous reviewer recommended and served it with spicy mustard as the original author recommended.

Spicy mustard + Egg Noodles + Kielbasa = Quite Tasty!

My family loved the Brussel sprouts, as they absorb some of the flavor from the sausage and onions.

I would have never thought to do this on my own.  Quite different, and surprisingly good.

This was a great basic recipe to build upon.  I added beer to the pan with the oil and onion and sauteed it with the kielbasa.  I added a little more beer with the brussel sprouts, then I covered the pan to let the ingredients simmer in the liquid.  When the sprouts were cooked through, I took them and the kielbasa out and put them in a bowl to hold.  I then added more oil to the pan and some roasted garlic smashed with salt.  I then deglazed the pan with beer, and kept slowly adding more beer to get to the consistency I wanted.  I added some dijon mustard and salt and pepper to taste, then added the kielbasa and sprouts back into the pan and tossed to coat.  I served it with parmesan and cracked pepper polenta... delicious!

Really loved this dish! Here's my variation:
- Used Chicken/Apple Sausage instead of Kielbasa
- Used 2 Med Yellow onions in place of the Red
- Quartered my brussel sprouts as they were somewhat large
- Sauteed sausage first with olive oil and added Sherry to deglaze the pan occasionally. 
- Added 1 generous TBS of grainy horseradish mustard to the sausage as it was cooking.
- Then sauteed the onions until partially done and added the brussel sprouts. (a little more olive oil and some sherry)
- Served it all over buttered egg noodles.
Oh my goodness the flavors were unbelievable!

This was very simply put, delicious. Made for dinner this evening.  Hubby loved it. Followed recipe exactly.  Letting the onions carmelize, I think is the secret to this simple,tasty meal. I used a 16oz. bag of frozen petite brussel sprouts, thawed. Was wonderful served over hot buttered egg noodles.  Will definately make again. Thanks for great recipe.

This is an awesome dish for a main or a side! Me and my husband have had a hard time finding brussel sprout recipes that our daughter would eat, but this is one of them! Very delicious! However, we didn't use any canola oil because of the kielbasa having enough drippings already.

As it is written, this is good.  We added diced potatoes to make it a complete meal that tasted great. The potatoes also give up some of their starch to make a nice sauce that sticks to the sprouts and gives them a much better flavor.   Add the Kielbasa and cook until it has browned on one side.  Turn it over and add the diced potatoes and about 1/2 cup of water.  Cover the pot and simmer for 10 minutes.  Add the Brussels sprouts and onion and cook covered for another 5 minutes.  Uncover and cook until the potatoes and the Brussels sprouts have browned.

This was pretty good the onions came out delicious and so did the kielbasa, I wasn't impressed with the brussle sprouts and I normally love them, the don't get as soft as I like them but I did serve over buttered egg noodles which was great! I will probably make the kielbasa with the onions again hold the brussle sprouts

Edit, I made this again last night and covered the dish while the brussle sprouts cooked, it allowed them to steam more, get softer and soak up more flavor, this time I served it over buttered mashed potatoes and it was delish! 5 stars!!!

This was great as is!  I've made other dishes with kielbasa, green peppers and onions, but the brussel sprouts made this my favorite!  My husband likes to spice it up with the addition of a couple hot smoked sausages links.

A nice change from the ordinary. I did omitt the salt and it was still a little salty for my taste. I followed the recipe other than that.

Oh my gosh, this is good! I made a few changes and, sorry to say, didn't measure anything, so I'll be hoping that I'll be able to make it taste as good next time, too. My grocery store had some really lovely brussel sprouts and I just filled a bag with them. I used Johnsonville polish kielbasa, 14 oz. in hot dog shapes, not the thicker rope shaped kielbasa because I wanted an all pork sausage and the other is a mixture. I cut my sprouts into quarters, and may go even smaller next time. Then I made a sauce of approximately 2 cups chicken stock, 1/3 cup dijon mustard and, a clove of minced garlic. (when cooking is finished there won't be much sauce in the dish because it is absorbed.) While I was getting everything else ready, I microwaved the sprouts with the sauce  and the salt and pepper in my casserole dish just to soften them up. I preheated my oven to 375, cut up my kielbasa and the only non-pearl, non dehydrated onion I had - about 3/4 of a regular one. (I'll definitely use a red, or sweet, onion next time. Mixed everything together in the casserole and baked it for about an hour, stirring twice to distribute the sauce and let the brussel sprouts evenly cook and color. Yummy!

My mother was Lithuanian so I grew up eating kielbasi and am always looking for new recipes.  Mom would have loved this one.  I did make a few changes, took the advice of other reviewers and didn't use oil.  I only had frozen brussels sprouts so I put everything in a casserole and baked in the oven stirring once until everything was cooked through.  I think next time I would rather use sliced onion instead of chopped, just a personal preference, and I'll be making potato pancakes to go with this.  Oh and the Mustard is a Must.

Even my hubby who is not crazy about brussel sprouts enjoys this one! I add mushrooms, either fresh or canned, one clove garlic and nuts, either almonds or pine nuts. They add nice crunch and flavor! Nice recipe...thanks for sharing!

This was so good and I am not a fan of Brussels Sprouts.  I did saute the onions in Olive Oil with 2 cloves of garlic. Added the sausage and spouts to the onion garlic mix to brown the sausage and cook the sprouts.  After placing into the serving bowl I added grated parmesean cheese to melt on the top.

My partner and I both liked this a lot. I liked it more, as evidenced by the fact that I cheerfully brought it as my work-lunch 4 out of 5 days last week. I piggybacked on mayflour's suggestion to trade the oil for water, but instead of either I used beer. I used my cast iron skillet and just kept deglazing the pan as I went. It cooked for about 20 min altogether because I like kielbasa to be almost crispy. Overall, with approximately 2/3 of a 12 oz can of Harpoon UFO Hefeweizen and the sausage, it hardly needed salt and pepper--though of course I added them. Served as the author suggested with baked mac 'n' cheese, it was very hearty--almost too hearty for summer, but that's what air conditioning is for. When I make it again, I'll use more onion; it was almost cooked down to nothing on account of my extended stovetop time. Oh, and I quartered the Brussels Sprouts and halved the sausage coins, too for more reasonable forkfuls.

I made this last night with a few changes.  I chopped a large onion into fairly large pieces and added it to the brussel sprouts in a roasting pan and added some ground garlic and a little salt & pepper and roasted them to a nice carmalized color.  I cooked some wide egg noodles and at the end added the kielbasa.  After draining I added some butter and served it with the brussel sprout mixture on top.  At the table it was topped with some freshly grated parmesan cheese.  Delicious

I didn't like this very much, but it's not due to the recipe, which was fine. I thought I'd try Brussels sprouts and DH loves them, but I learned I definitely do not like Brussels sprouts! I like cabbage only a little and these tasted too much like cabbage to me. The kielbasa and onions part was good tho.

This is so easy and so good!  I first cooked just as stated, but it's just me so I had a lot to play with.  So I decided to try it a couple of other ways as per some other comments. 1st way I did as called for, great.  2nd way I added Dijon mustard(others called for spicy but I went with this).  It did add a nice touch.  3rd way I added the Dijon and then sprinkled parm on top.  Great also. Any of these ways are great so go as you like.  I will add, I had baby brussel sprouts so I just cut in half but if yours are bigger, maybe you should quarter.  You could also cover for the last 10 mins if you need the sprouts softer, your preference. Loved all 3!

I added a little sugar and some caraway seed to give this dish some extra flavor.  It was a tad oily, so next time I might just spray with Pam, rather than using all that vegetable oil.  I cooked it on medium until almost done, then cranked up the heat to brown everything, which really brought out the flavor of the onions.  Don't be shy with the onions!

I used spicy italian sausage with this recipe and didn't need salt or pepper. It has an awesome kick! I also didn't need canola oil as the sausage had plenty of drippings. Sooo Tasty!!

This was good. I used turkey smoked sausage, but I think regular smoked sausage or regular keilbasa would've been better. Reviewers are right, the caramelized red onion MAKE the recipe. Without them, the recipe is fairly lacking in flavor, even with a good amount of salt and pepper. I deglazed the pan a few times with chicken broth to help boost flavor. Thanks for the recipe.

I tweaked the recipe a bit but overall was very delicious....i used turkey kielbasa, added minced garlic and egg noodles. I used the suggestion of the spicy mustard adding that to the mixture it was awesome...highly recommended quick and easy.

My family just finished dinner and loved it. I did make a couple of small changes but only to fix a mistake. I over salted the dish so used a couple of splashes of Teriyaki marinade, hoping it would balance out the taste. It did, but not enough, so I added a few sprinkles of light brown sugar. The result was absolutely delicious! I also used water instead of oil and covered the skillet for most of the cooking. 
This is a great recipe for kielbasa. Thank so much for sharing!

I really liked this.  Very simple, which is always a plus.  I was a little paranoid about everything drying out so I did add about 1/4 cup of chicken broth to the pan after the brussles sprouts.  I'll try to cover the meal the next time so that maybe the sprouts soften a little more.  Flavor was great, ease of prep was great.  This will definitely be part of my dinner rotation.

This was really good!  I sub'd butter for the oil and added a little water (less than 1/4 cup) to help steam the brussel sprouts (I put the lid on for a few minutes).  It was delicious served over couscous!

I also used water instead of oil and turkey kielbasa, but otherwise per recipe. It was wonderful. My husband devoured it, and I even ate about half of the brussel sprouts on my plate. Since I've never eaten more than one bite of one before, this was pretty amazing!

This turned out very well.  I also used a splash of water from time to time as the brussel sprouts cooked, to help steam them.  I recommend cooking the onions until brown before adding the sausage, and then cooking the sausage until caramelized.  This will add great flavor to the dish.  I served it over rice.

This was outstanding, especially considering how easy it is to prepare - I cook for one and tend to throw things together rather haphazardly - I don't eat pork so I used a quarter of a turkey kielbasa and quartered about a cup-and-a-half of sprouts because they weren't very small - After adding the sprouts to the pan, I sprinkled lightly with granulated garlic and added small amounts of water a few times, letting it cook off between additions, to keep the sausage from burning and steam the sprouts a bit to help them cook - I sprinkled the whole affair with a tablespoon of parmesan cheese - Just totally delicious and very filling - Will use a little more onions next time and will try it with sweet apple chicken sausage as someone else suggested 'cause that sounds super good, as well - This will definitely be a regular around my kitchen - C

I have a small stash of various flavors of chicken sausage in my freezer, and wanted to find some easy weeknight recipes I could throw together. We don't eat pork or beef, and there are not many recipes out there for chicken sausage, so when I stumbled across this recipe, I figured I could adapt it. As another reviewer did, I used the apple chicken sausage. It added a slightly sweet element to the dish, which I enjoyed. I also deglazed the pan using sherry and added some stone ground mustard while the sausage was cooking. I don't think the dish would have been flavorful enough without those additions. We love brussels sprouts, so this dish will likely be a healthy weeknight staple.

Very good! I wasn't sure what to think but felt adventurous and this was really good. I loved the carmelized onion and the salty smoky flavor of the sausage with the brussels sprouts. I used a little oil to start with but the sausage was greasy and I could have gotten by without it. I used 12 oz of frozen baby brussels sprouts and didn't halve them, half a Texas sweet onion sliced into rings, and 2 links of Ekrich beef Kielbasa. This only fed two of us, so I guess were were really hungry or else maybe we're big eaters. I liked this as it is, but think that maybe the recipe with the addition of mustard cream sauce would take this over the top good to a 5 star meal. Great use for brussels sprouts and a great all in 1 skillet meal!

This was great!  I made it in an attempt to get more variety in to our vegetable diet, and to my delight my entire family raved about it.  I served it over egg noodles and with a salad on the side.  It's a great cool-weather, down-home meal. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe seems so simple, but it is delicious! I'm not a big onion fan but the red onions are great in this dish. I precook the Brussels sprouts a bit before adding them to the onion and kielbasa--they were just a little too toothy for us otherwise. This dinner has been added to our regular rotation!

Excellent flavor; good comfort food dish.  No changes to recipe except for the suggestion of using water in place of the oil.  The mustard on the side is also a good suggestion.  Will make often.

This is really good.  I have made it many times when I need a quick easy dinner.  I have found that the Brussels sprouts need a little water to steam in with a cover on.  Otherwise, I have not changed the recipe a bit.  Yum!

Easy and delicious. Be careful not to cook the brussels sprouts too long or they will get mushy. I also used water instead of additional fat in the cooking.

I served this on top of mashed potatoes and it made my husband like brussels sprouts for a change.  Really a unique and tasty way to serve an underappreciated vegetable!  I will make this again next time I have a bounty of brussels sprouts.  By the way, I used regular brussels sprouts and cut them in half and they cooked perfectly.

Great dish & super easy! My husband and super picky 2 year old loved it. I used Turkey Kielbasa to save some calories/fat and served it with buttered egg noodles as another reviewer suggested.

Very Good! I was looking for something new to do with Brussels Sprouts and knew this recipe would be perfect as it combines two of my husband's favorites...Brussels Sprouts and Kielbasa! Like other reviewers, I steamed onion, brussels sprouts and sliced peppers then sauteed.  I  added Kielbasa and a little bit of beer and simmered.  Served over rice...so good!!!

fantastic! My Sprouts were frozen, so I boiled them in water for a while first, then used that water instead of oil. So easy and since we are not big fans of noodles had it over rice instead. My honey dislikes brussel sprouts and even he admitted that it was good.

Very good!! I used the steamfresh brussel sprouts and only nuked them for half the time. I then cut them in halve and sauteed with the Kielbasa. I added garlic and half a bottle of dark beer and let it simmer. Tasted awesome!

This was a really good recipe.  I did leave out the salt, thinking the kielbasa would be salty enough...but I would have probably preferred a pinch of salt for the brussel sprouts.  I also added a little bit of paprika.  Yummy!  Definitely a keeper!

Easy & tasty, but... maybe my Brussels sprouts were a bit large, as even extending the  cooking time, they weren't soft. Will cut them in quarters next time. Also thought the dish needed a bit more moisture. Will try adding water & maybe wine vinegar next time.

Great recipe.  Didn’t use any oil. I think the red onions are key.  Added a few splashes of beer and a spoon of Dijon mustard when almost cooked.  Went great with mac and cheese as another reviewer suggested.

I really liked this. I only gave 4 stars because I upped the spices.  I did add garlic even though some would say plenty of garlic in the sausage but I add garlic all the time and usually up the spices on everything. Plus, I dashed in some vinegar at the end of cooking. I served it with spaetzle and I will definitely make it again.

This was very good and a quick and easy recipe to make.  My husband and I really like it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only change I would make would be to slice the onion a little thicker.  Mine was too thin.  Excellent recipe!

I made this dish using fresh Kielbasa, so I had to disregard the cook times entirely. Started the Kielbasa on the stove top and fried it adequately, before transferring it to the sheet pan of Brussel Sprouts and Red Onion. In the oven, the dish finished well, and was tasty.

I tried this recipe and took a bit of advice from other reviewers. I used yellow onions (all I had on hand). Sauteed them in butter til carmelized, added smoked sausage (again what I had on hand) about a tablesppon of spicy brown mustard and a tablespoon of chicken stock. I quartered my brussel sprouts and added them with a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar and a tablespoon if brown sugar.  Was very good. Hubby approved and I will try this again.

Great way to enjoy Brussels Sprouts. Make sure to cut Kielbasa into thin slices so you'll have some with every bite. The combination is the key.

Thought it lacked depth of flavor.  Wasn't terrible, but will not likely make it again.

This was delicious!  I used olive oil instead of canola oil, and I sprinkled parmesan cheese over everything right before serving.  It made a great meal and a great snack the next day.

I used fresh Brussel sprouts off the stalk.  Some were large so I cut them in quarters instead of half.  This was even better than expected...and I did expect it to be good! All ingredients were Great flavors together. I passed the recipe on to friends.
I used 2 lbs. of Kielbasa and extra Brussel sprouts, hoping for leftovers and hardly had any leftovers.  My family went back for seconds.  We served on top of egg noodles.

I couldn’t get Brussels sprouts to cook as fast as everything else. I don’t think I cut them small enough. It tastes OK but looks a little brown! I did add a little garlic powder and a few flakes it made a little tastier. I’m glad this dish was just for me and not guests!! I would probably try it again.

Fantastic! The whole family loved it. I used turkey kielbasa and added a couple of garlic cloves, sliced.  The reds and greens from the kielbasa and Brussels sprouts were so vibrant and the tastes were a perfect complement. I served it with mashed potatoes (and buttered egg noodles for my 4yo who dislikes potatoes.) So simple, quick, and delicious.

I took the advice of another reviewer and used beer instead of oil or water.   Adding red pepper flakes gave it just the kick it needed. I also served cacio pepe on the side.

This turned out to be a delicious pairing that hit the spot. I substituted a couple of teaspoons of minced garlic for the onion, and salted the mix while it was cooking. The flavor combo was balanced well like that. It could probably pair well with apple for a sweet touch, and potatoes for something more hearty.

First off I don't really care for brussel sprouts. My grandson said let's try it pop.  So we did.  It was so easy to make and it tasted great. The next day the flavor was still in the room.  What a simple delicious meal.

Really good, hardy dish. You have to get real kielbasa and not the packaged stuff you buy at the grocery store. That’s just too watery. Go to a Polish Deli or German butcher instead. I did not have to add salt or pepper - the sausage seasoned the whole dish. Terrific for colder days! Will make again!

This was absolutely delicious. My mom and I cooked it together and she added maple syrup and bourbon to the dish. We steamed the brussel sprouts for 8 minutes before putting them in with the kielbasa, onions and mushrooms which we added. Probably one of the best dishes I've had in a long time. We served it with garlic mashed potatoes, french bread, and Pinot Noir.

My new recipe that I love!!!
I made this using defrosted brussel sprouts cut in half.  I was afraid of using all of the red onion but next time I will!   It didn't take this long to make,  so watch it.  I added a light sprinkling of garlic powder at the end and served this over buttered egg noodles.  It was amazing.

I love Brussels spouts, so I hardly change a thing (toss in a little garlic which make anything taste better). The rest of my family generally hates Brussels sprouts so what I do slice them thin as possible, this lessens the punch. This is s great, as is, recipe but also a "let you imagination go nuts" recipe. The sausage and sprouts have a flavor that will stand up to almost anything you want to experiment with.

thought we had a kielbasa, but we just had a smoked sausage.  the recipe worked fine.  I would add more onions because we really like browned onions.  served with artisan bread and mustard.

Easy and tasty weeknight supper.  I followed the recipe, except for using water instead of oil.

Took advice of using 2tbsp of water instead of all that oil & 1 tbsp of “can’t believe it’s not butter “. Worked perfectly!.  Made both hubby and self happy.  He ate lots more kielbasa, I ate almost all the Brussels sprouts.  Added 2 largely diced potatoes as another suggested that I cooked in micro for 1 minute before adding to all the other Ingredients. Next time i’m Going to try it with broccoli only because hubby likes that more.

I wanted to get my husband to try brussel sprouts in a recipe, not as a side, because he didn't like them. This recipe changed that! He had two helpings! The only change I made was to add two cloves of chopped garlic to the dish. Thanks for sharing a great dish, I'll be making this again!

Made as written except for using water instead of oil to saute.  My husband gave it 4 stars, I give it 3.5.  A dab of dijon mustard on my serving added flavor.  My husband wants me to make it again, so I will :)

I made it!! Cooked for Christmas Senior Banquet and everyone loved it and has ask for the recipe. I have got to share ?? and yes I will be making it again. I used extra virgin olive oil instead of canola, but I do believe canola wouldn't have made the sprouts darker but overall it was delicious!! Thanks for sharing ??

I would make this without the sausage.  It was too prominent in the dish.  I would make it with the sprouts, red onion and add baby portabellos.

I used polish kielbasa which made it really rich.  I would probably use a milder sausage to make it again.  The Brussels sprouts turned out nicely.  I only used half of a large red onion but should have used the whole thing.  I will make it again.

Initially seemed  like an odd one-pan combination of ingredients, but the dish was very good. Followed recipe exactly except for using a few tablespoons of water rather than oil to sauté the sausage and onion. Simple to make and no leftovers!

I've made this many times, but I also add white beans and make a mustard cream sauce over everything.  It's a great side dish and we often use it as the main dish for a meal.

Always looking for new ways to use brussel sprouts and this was a winner.  Thought I had a red onion, but, nope.  Used a white onion and it was great.  This was a quick, simple meal and will be made many more times.  Thanks for posting.

After adding the Brussels sprouts, it looked a bit dry.  I drizzled chicken broth over it a couple of times and covered it for th last 3-4 minutes.  It made a nice carmelized glaze.

Meh... Kielbasa always tastes wonderful in its savory goodness.  The problem is that the Brussel Sprouts get lost in the duo. And it screams for potatoes!

Thank You!

I first made this dish exactly as the recipe says, although I used Olive oil instead of Canola. We really liked it, so I made it again, but this time, about 5 min. before it was done, I added minced garlic and a teaspoon of butter.  I think it tasted a little better by adding the items, but that is just a person preference, the original is great, as is.

I sautéd the onion in bacon grease. Added diced potatoes along with the other ingredients. Added some apple juice and beer for extra moisture as everything cooked.  Kept it covered most of the cooking time.  Most importantly, I added caraway seeds.  It was delicious and a perfect fall/winter meal! Thank you!

I won’t be making this again. The brussel sprouts needed twice the cooking time recommended. All in all this dish was boring although it took little effort to make.

interesting combination. We liked it with a few additions. I used sherry to clean the pan and it glaced the sprouts and sausage. Also added some garlic powder. It was quick and easy to make. Will probably make again.

It was a moment of inspiration.  I just happened to have everything, and more, in the fridge.  I used 1/2 lb each of Andouille and kielbasa...used about 20 B sprouts and a small head of Romanesco cut into bite size pieces. Roasted everything off as a sheet pan dinner and it was super delicious. Thanks for the motivation!

Giving this recipe 5 stars because it was delicious and very quick to make.  Made a side of mashed yams to accompany this very savory dish, the combination went very well.

The only things that I did differently was not putting as much onion (simply because I'm not big on them) and adding butter saice that you would usually put on brussel sprouts. This dish is magnificent!

I will definitely make this again. It was delicious and filling.  I made  it without the red onion because I forgot to buy one at the store. So, I used onion powder instead.  Then once everything was combined, I added 1 cup of water and let it simmer on medium heat for about 10 or 15 minutes more.

This recipe stood out to me. I always check reviews for tips... they helped. 
I halved the Brussel sprouts and I put them face down with a splash of water to let them steam. Then I diced half a red onion added salt and pepper and used half a tablespoon of butter leaving the lid on. After 2 minutes or so I added a teaspoon of minced garlic with a splash of white cooking wine, I let cook off a bit and then moved the sprouts out to the edges of the pan and let the kielbasa seer, then mixed everything up and let simmer on low with the heat on low. It turned out so well with great flavor. I loved this combination, I would have thought to combine them. Paired with a spinach Florentine penne (packaged). My fiancé loved this, will make again!

Good hearty meal for fall and winter.  I par boiled some small potatoes and cut them up into bite sized pieces.  I put the potatoes in with the sausage and onion. Potatoes caramelized during the cooking  process and were fried to perfection.. Highly recommend you use Dijon mustard with this dish.   A great one pot meal served with rye bread and a mug of beer.  Real German-Polish comfort food.  Will definitely make again.

After I sliced the kielbasa sausage into 1/2 inch slices, I sliced them in half for bite size portions. I added some spicy Montreal seasoning.  I added a tablespoon of soy sauce, and tablespoon of hot sauce near the end. I also went a little rouge and added extra wide egg noodles. It was fantastic.

I searched for a recipe using kielbasa and brussels sprouts and this popped up. I used the exact recipe except for one major change. Instead of doing this on top of the stove I put the ingredients on a foil lined baking sheet, drizzled with oil, and roasted for about 25 minutes, flipping the ingredients after about 15 minutes. Incredibly easy and incredibly delicious. Definitely a keeper!

I used lower fat kielbasa along with listed ingredients. Loved it while getting my veggies for the day. You can also substitute with mushrooms, broccoli, etc. Equally as good.

I made this last night before I saw this recipe only I added shredded cabbage to it and used a white onion since I did not have a red.  I also added some red wine vinegar to just enough to add a little  flavor to it.  It was very good.  Did it as a main dish.

If it says I made this twice, it's wrong; I made it for the first time tonight.

I stuck as close to the recipe as I could, which isn't extremely close.  I used half a large yellow onion and a 12oz bag of frozen Brussels sprouts (thawed).  No idea how much kielbasa I used; it was one large link.  I eyeballed the oil, and it probably came out to only 1 or 2 tsp.

I heated the kielbasa and onion first, and I'll do that differently next time.  The onion sucked up all the oil and left a black residue on the pan.  The onion turned translucent long before the kielbasa had browned to my liking.  Next time I'll cook them separately and then put them together with the sprouts and S&P later.  The frozen sprouts had been cooked already before they were frozen, so they didn't need to cook long at all, just enough to heat them up and mix it all together.

The result?  It was good.  Not excellent, but I'd do this again, perhaps with other changes.  For example: my friend added some balsamic vinegar to his, and said that worked well.

I will definitely be making this again. Only changes I made was to omit the canola oil and added minced garlic. This was definitely a big hit. Next time, I plan to add egg noodles as suggested in the reviews.

The first time I made this, I liked it a lot. But when I made it again, I added sauerkraut. Then I LOVED it! Such a savory and satisfying meal!

Loved this! Though, I did make some minor changes. I used water instead of oil and I added 2 minced garlic cloves after the onions (sliced instead of chopped) became transparent. (I'll use more onions next time!)  I used fresh Brussels sprouts that were free for the taking (and blanched them before cooking them, as there was so much of them and most went into the freezer). Yum!!  Hubby loved this too.

Pretty good, pre-roasted the sprouts in 400'oven after tossing in oil and s/p. Added to onion and sausage, added a bit of water to steam, tossed with egg noodles! Yum!

Absolutely delicious and so easy to throw together! Used water instead of oil and omitted the salt, courtesy of "mayflour." Served it over rice. My kids ate it up and asked for more! Thank you!

I made this with some changes due to family preference. I used vidalia onions and i used more kielbasa, basically doubling the recipe.  Came out very good and even my finicky son liked thhis.  Will definitely make this again.   Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Gave this a 4 because I added some ingredients:   Sautéd the red onion with bacon bits and ground garlic, then added thawed Brussels sprouts cut in half  and sliced sausage, browning for 5 min. at med.-high heat. Made a thin sauce of white wine, chicken stock and 1 Tbl flour to thicken, about 2/3 cup. Added 1/2 can of  Canneloni beans and sprinkled a little red pepper.  Simmered all for 15 min.  Served over egg noodles.  Big hit.

This dish is so easy and tastes great!  The only changes I made were to add garlic scapes (only because they are in season and I had them in the garden)  and vidalia onion instead of red onion (we like them better).

LOVED!  Simple and delicious.  The ONLY thing I'll do different next time is QUARTER the brussels spouts ... they were a bit hard at the end of the cooking time when cut in half.  Other than that, this is a complete winner and I'll make it over and over.

Good-easy to make. Left out the oil and had white onions vice red (red would have been better) after adding Brussel sprouts and letting sauté a few minutes, I added @1/4 cup cooking sherry and @ 1 tsp smoked paprika. It goes well with brown mustard.

I just looked for a recipe for brussel sprouts as I had a bunch I needed to use. It does not get much better than this as far as how quick, easy and delicious this is. Great flavors for a comfort food that is a little different. The brussel sprouts almost come out like cabbage. I followed the suggestion of one reviewer which was to use water instead of oil, and I was glad I did. I did have to watch it closely, as I did need to add water a few times. I used smoked turkey sausage and oil was certainly not necessary. Overall a great week night dinner!

I thought this was simple and tasty!! It's a great foundation that you can go any direction with. I added minced garlic and Greek seasonings with roasted garlic herb seasonings. Since I started with frozen Brussels sprouts, I steamed them first so they were plenty tender. I served it over basmati rice and the family loved it! I will make it again! :D

Good recipe overall, but I only had turkey kielbasa, which I think was a little bland for the recipe. Definitely will make again with the real kielbasa.

Kielbasa with Brussel Sprouts' Haiku: "Didn't use oil. (Kielbasa makes enough grease!) Good with brown mustard!" I don't know why brussel sprouts get such a bad rap; this was a colorful, yummy dish, and the only thing I did was to drop the oil all-together, add a little water (per one review), and serve w/ a squirt of spicy brown mustard (Yum! per another review.) I thought it was pretty awesome, but the leftovers, not so much, so maybe it's a make-and-eat that day kinda meal.

This was just okay for me,i used fresh brussle spouts so it took way longer to cook.  My husband seemed to like it.  I served it with homemade mac and cheese.

We really enjoyed this. I put some Mrs. Dash on top and nuked some white potatoes till half done and then added them when I added the brussel sprouts. Next time I think I'd throw in some carrots!

OK, Yankeesfan.  Even this Red Sox fan has to admit you hit it out of the park with this recipe.  I've found I really prefer the lower fat kielbasa.  What a great way to work brussels sprouts into a recipe.  Yum!

Wonderful!  Quick and easy to make.  At first I thought it would have little flavor, but just with those few ingredients the meal was very tasty.

This was a great alternative for kielbasa!  Added some garlic to the onions as they cooked as well as some chopped potatoes, then included the kielbasa on top of all to season and let it all simmer in some beer until the Brussels sprouts were ready to be added in the last 10 minutes.  I'll make this one again - thanks for the recipe!

Wow, what a wonderful surprise this was.  I made it as a dish with spinach frittata and it was delicous!
