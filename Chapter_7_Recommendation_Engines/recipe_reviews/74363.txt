This recipe came out great.  I would definitely suggest baking the popcorn on a cookie sheet covered with foil, in a 200 degree oven for approximately 20 minutes to crisp it up a bit.  Otherwise it is extremely gooey.  Also, I made two batches for a crowd and had better luck on my second batch where I used one bag of popcorn for the amount of sauce the recipe says should be used for 2 bags.  I think it was much easier to coat and came out yummier with twice the sauce.  Also, I added slightly more peanut butter for the second batch, but I am a peanut butter lover.  This recipe would be great to add salted peanuts to.

I used all natural fluff instead of the marshmallows. I also used air popped popcorn. It was great right away, but I thought it needed a little crisping in the oven. I threw it in for 15 minutes at 300 and stirred it occasionally. AWESOME!

I also sprinkled it with a little kosher salt after it was done. The salty/sweet combination definitely worked for my pregnancy cravings!

amazing recipe!  i used buttered microwave popcorn and it worked great.  two tips:  definitely dry the popcorn at 200 for 30 minutes (tossing every 10) in an oval turkey roasting pan. after the oven, let it sit for 10 minutes or so and then put into serving bowl.  do not let it sit too long as it hardens quickly.   also, you can put on latex gloves to help you toss this more evenly.  next time, i'll add mini m&ms.  it was a great party hit.  thanks.

I have made this a couple times now.  First time was to fill X-mas tins as party gifts over the holidays, and now for a summer barbecue/picnic.  It's very easy, but as others have suggested, it needs to be baked to prevent soggy, gooey popcorn.  I baked it at 250 degrees for 30 minutes, stirring once in the middle.  The first time I made it, I didn't think it had enough of a peanut butter taste (tasted too much like caramel corn with a subtle peanut butter flavor, which was fine, but I wanted something more flavorful and different from the caramel corn I had also made).  So, the second time I made it, I increased the peanut butter to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of peanuts too, and it turned out perfect!  I have popped my own popcorn both times with coconut oil (only the BEST oil to use, and it gives the most amazing flavor).  If you like chocolate and peanut butter flavors together, you can drizzle melted chocolate over the mix after it cools, or try what I did, which was to make the Chocolate Popcorn recipe from this site that was submitted by sueb, leave out the peanuts in it, and after both batches cool, mix them together.  It makes for a fun mix!  Thanks for sharing!

A masterpiece!!  I used 3/4c peanut butter and spread the mixture out on two cookie sheets to "dry up" a bit.  I then melted some chocolate chips in a ziploc bag in the microwave and cut the corner tip and "drizzled" the pocpcorn with chocolate.... Thank you!

Good flavor with just the right amount of peanut butter. Not to overwhelming. But I feel this recipe is only worth it, if you go the extra step and put it in the oven to dry it out and crisp it up for a half and hour or so. When you let it cool, which is very hard to do, it turns into a wonderful carmel corn. I love to make this recipe with the "microwave popcorn" recipe from this site. Gotta try it. 
If you don't do the oven step, then it is just too gooey and sticky and I would only give it two stars.

I adapted the original recipe a bit to make Caramel Peanut Butter Popcorn.  But I was afraid of sugar shock or butter overload, so I cut those ingredients way down.

I put 15 individually wrapped caramels in my bowl, and melted them in the microwave with a little water. Then I added slightly more than 1/4 cup peanut butter, 19 marshmallows (didn't have 20!), only 2 T butter, and only 1/4 c. of light brown sugar.  I also added walnuts.  

I also followed the suggestion of crisping it in the oven on 200 F for 20 minutes in foil-lined pans.  Yum!  I could see drizzling this with almond bark next time, or adding chocolate chips or another kind of nut.

I did use 2 bags of microwave popcorn, and thought that it was the perfect amount of coating, while still letting the popcorn flavor come through.

I added natural peanut butter, and non hydrodgenated margarine. I also popped my own popcorn. I put all of the ingredients in the microwave at once. When everything was melted I poured in the popcorn. I would definitely make it again.

This was wonderful!  I used air popped popcorn since I didn't have Microwave popcorn and it worked great.  I also cooked the mixure on the stove and not the microwave, cooking it a little longer like you would for candy makes the mixture harder more and made it less gooey.  We loved it!

To cut down on the sugar I used natural peanut butter (increased to 1/2 cup) and reduced the brown sugar to a scant 1/2 cup.  The marshmallows provide plenty of sugar.  If you're using an air popper, this covered one popper's worth.  (1/2 cup unpopped kernels)

I thought the concept of this recipie was awesome.  I have made it twice now.  The first time I made it I followed the instructions to a T and followed it up in the oven for 30 minutes at the suggestion of others. It was good.  The second time I cooked the sauce on the stove.  I added all the ingredients at once (even the pbutter). I upped the peanut butter to 3/4 cup and I used 30 large marshmellows.  Cooked it over med low heat to boiling and boiled one minute.  Poured sauce over 20 cups of stovetop popcorn.  Baked 300 degrees for 30 minutes stirring every 10.  Awesome, crispy, melt in your mouth. peanutbuttery popcorn.  Finished with a touch of kosher salt too.   SOOO GOOD!

My husband and I enjoyed this.  Instead of cooking the peanut butter mixture in the microwave, cooked on the stove.  Brought mixture to a boil for several minutes, stirring continuously.  Removed from heat and stirred in 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp vanilla.  Baked at 200 for 45 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes.  Turned out onto waxed paper to cool.  Definitely let popcorn cool COMPLETELY.  The popcorn that had only cooled for about 5 minutes was kind of like a rice crispy treat, but after 20 minutes was harder like caramel corn.

This is very good. I used real popped popcorn (trying to economize). At first I thought it was going to be too marshmallow-ey for me because I am not a big fan of marshmallows but the taste of marshmallows seemed to mellow down. I did bake for 20 minutes or maybe a little more. I decided it would be better with a little more salt so I added a very small amount - maybe 1/4 tsp. I bet peanut butter varies in sodium level, though, so taste it before you add any. I think I will try it with crunchy peanut butter next time and I may toss some chocolate chips in after baking and then stir to let them melt around on the popcorn. I think I may send some of this in to my granddaughter's class for snack (they don't have any peanut allergies, thank goodness). UPDATE: I realized after writing this that the microwave popcorn would be salted - that's why I had to add salt when I used regular, natural popcorn.

I'm giving this four stars because it is really good, however I feel that the user's comments really improve it.  I doubled the peanut butter and baked it after coating for an hour at 250, stirring every 15 minutes.  It was lovely!

I made this with regular machine-popped popcorn, added 1/3 c peanut butter and dried in the oven as others suggested.  It hardens quickly at room temp but you can 'soften' it back up in the microwave at 50 % or again in low-temp oven, even the next day.

I used air popped popcorn (probably about the equivalent of 2 1/2 bags), 200 small marshmallows, 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter, and a good dollop of crunchy peanut butter as well. Next time I would decrease the brown sugar, since we found it to be quite rich. Also, I would recommend crisping it up as others have said, unless you want to eat it with a spoon.

I like it. Just not as much as my bf did. I think it needs to definately be baked...maybe have some pretzels, cheese popcorn, or peanuts mixed in. Easy snack so I would make it again.

Awesome recipe! We were having a graduation party and came up short on desserts (aside from the sheet cake) I wanted to put out something sweet but something different than the cookies/cupcakes. This would have done the trick if it made it to the party! I made this only a few hours before everyone started to arrive and it was gone before our first guest came. While I followed the recipe I kind of played a guessing game on measurements and it still turned out great. I personally recommend crisping it in the oven while my family enjoyed it either way. Hands down yummy. Thank you for a such an easy addition to my recipe box!

Great recipe for the kids to create.  I liked the marshmallow addition in this recipe. I give this four stars only because I found I had to make some extra sauce to give all the popcorn a good coat.  I added in a little extra peanut butter to ensure a great peanut butter taste-and some roasted peanuts.  I transfered to a 13x9 baking tin and baked at 350 for 10 minutes to harden up a bit.   I stuck the bowl in hot soapy water for 10 minutes for easy clean-up.  Will make again- a great addition to family movie night.

What a yummy treat. I too used a jar of mellow fluff. After mixing it up I lined a BIG roasting pan with that wonderful nonstick aluminum foil. I "baked" the mixture for about 30 minutes on 200°, turning every 10 minutes or so. I let cool and then I dumped the popcorn into a holiday tin.  Everyone loved this recipe. Comfort food at its best

Super quick and easy - my husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. Next time I'll try a variation with air-popped popcorn to make it a little healthier, but it was definitely great tasting with microwave popcorn!

Really good!  I also baked it to crisp it up and tossed it with some Reece's PB chips after it cooled.  The kids gobbled it up (of course)!

This is my go-to snack for my family. My husband and kids LOVE it. I use less brown sugar and less marshmallows and LOTS of extra peanut butter. 

Since I air-pop, I add about 2 teaspoons of salt to the mix...otherwise it comes out tasting really bland.

This time I also added a little vanilla extract to the mix...we will have to see how it comes out (it is currently baking) 

It also makes the house smell good when baking!

I altered the recipe a bit too - I used marshmallow fluff and low cal peanut butter.  Also I used 1/4 c of butter and sugar free peanut butter syrup in lieu of brown sugar.  Baked 350 for 8 minutes and was perfect!  Nice and crispy with lots of flavor.

I gave it 5 stars WITH the following changes as suggested:I added a half cup of peanut butter rather than the suggested quarter cup. I also added half a cup of peanuts and baked at 200 degrees for 30 minutes stirring every 10 minutes. My DH and I could not keep our hands off it!

Added chocolate and it came out 5 stars worthy. It's good without, but the flavor is too one dimensional. Reduced the sugar to (approx.) 1/2 cup, the peanut butter very slightly, and added 1/4 cup semisweet chocolate. Just the perfect amount without overpowering.

We loved this recipe, but you MUST bake it for 20 minutes at 250 degrees, stirring 3 or 4 times. Then, it is crunchy & delicious!!

Made 1/2 cup air popped corn with 2 tsp canola oil and 1/2 tsp salt. Melted 20 large marshmallows, 1/2 cup peanut butter, and 2 tablespoons butter in microwave for 2 minutes, stirring after 1 minute. Poured this over popcorn and mixed quickly. It was great this way, plenty sweet with no extra sugar added! My daughter's new favorite!

SUPER EASY AND FAST!!! Exactly what I wanted in a great football watching, pumpkin carving snack!! Thank you and I did add a little more pb to the mix b/c we like it like that. I heated it in the oven at 200 degrees for about 20 min and tossed some for extra crunch.

1/2 the recipes - 1/2 the calories

I LOVE popcorn and LOVE peanut butter, but a snack with 380 calories was a little much for this calorie counter. So I cut the recipe in half, and still made 8 great snack sized servings! This is a perfect little snack to really curb a sweet tooth craving - and at 180 calorie instead, it fits into the diet. :)

This is wonderful!  I used two bags of Natural Popcorn, one helpful hint:  remove the un-popped kernels before setting the popped popcorn aside, in two separate bowls (easier to stir two bowls than ONE big bowl). :) Also I threw in a couple of handfuls of Cocktail Peanuts into the 2 bowls of popcorn.  Poured only half of the topping over each bowl of popcorn at a time and only baked each bowl one at a time, at 250 for 15 minutes, stirring every 5.  (don't forget to spray cookie sheets with non-stick cooking spray)  Also used a Whisk to stir the marshmallow topping mix, every minute while it melted, helped break up the marshmallows easier than the wooden spoon I was using at first.  Hope this helps!

Best peanut butter caramel corn ever!! I love peanut butter so I used 1/2C. and added dry roasted peanuts.  I also baked at 250 for about 35minutes to crisp it up.  Wonderful!

It's AWESOME! 1st - We used butter instead of margarin and 2 tbls extra PB 2nd - It was gooey, so we naturally made them into popcornballs 3rd - half we baked like the other recommendations Final conclusion: Gooey is great for balls, but cooked is better for either.

I made this for an election night party and it was gone before the polls closed. Definitely a keeper. Passed the husband test. I added 1/2 teas. salt to the candy mixture and and a cup of salted peanuts while mixing the popcorn and  mixture together. I cooked the candy mixture on low heat on top of a stove burner using a simmer plate. I highly recommend that you bake this as mentioned in other reviews. I baked mine at 200 degrees removing to stir the popcorn every 15 minutes for an hour. UPDATE: This year I used the microwave and I won't be doing it on the stovetop anymore. Easy Peasy.

I literally am eating this RIGHT NOW... This was the first time I made it and forgot to look over the comments before cooking so, yes it is a little soggy so I would definitely recommend trying to bake it first before adding the sauce. Although, for a quick late night snack this is just perfect soggy or not!

Too gooey if not cooked therefore cook at 200 degrees for about 15 minutes, stirring it halfway.

Half a bag of miniature marshmallows = 20 large marshmallows

Could try less brown sugar...more marshmallow and pb.

This peanut butter popcorn was excellent!  We followed other reviewers suggestions and dried it out in the oven then drizzled melted chocolate over it;  I have made this with reg. peanut butter, almond butter, and sunflower seed butter, all were excellent!  Even wrapped up & gave as gifts, yum!!

This was amazing!  I made it for a gathering with friends and I have just a few crumbs left of a big glass casserole dish full.  I did double the amount of peanut butter at the request of my boyfriend.  (He loves peanuts and anything that has them.)  I did follow the advice of other reviewers and baked it at 250 for 30 minutes stirring every 10 minutes.

Just a tip:  the coating mix is gooey and sticky.  If you don't want to spend a lot of time cleaning the mixing bowls or the spatula, spray them with cooking spray, like Pam, first.  The mixture doesn't stick and is really easy to clean up.

This was a hit at my party.  We used a little extra peanut butter.  Only other change we made was to bake it in a 250 oven for 45 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes.

Wish I could give this 10 stars it was so good.  Don't be afraid to mess with it a little to get it just perfect for you.  I have made it many times and changed things just slightly several times.  It wonderful as is, but I like making it mine.

Awesome!  I did read the reviews and reduced the brown sugar and increased the peanut butter.  I also don't eat microwave popcorn, so I make it with 1/4 cup popcorn kernels, popped; 1/4 cup butter; 1/4 cup brown sugar; 1/2 a bag of mini marshmallows; 1/4 cup + 2 T peanut butter and 1/4 tsp kosher salt.  I tried it once stirring in mini reese's cups, but they just melted and made a mess.  That batch, I pressed into a cake pan and cut into bars.  I also have tried it with peanuts and milk chocolate chips - very good!  I picked this recipe specifically because I wanted ooey, gooey popcorn and once I saw that the recipe has marshmallows, I knew I was on the right track.

Fabulous.
I used more peanut butter and only one package of popcorn. 
This was so good, I ate about a cup of it before sticking in the oven to crisp, as other reviewers suggested.  
We'll see if there is any left for my husband when he gets home... :)

Made the recipe with 20C of regular popcorn and used 3/4C chunky peanut butter, keeping the remainder of the recipe the same.  I also took other reviewers advice and baked it at 250 for 45 minutes, stirring after each 15 minutes.  That made it nice and crispy.  My kids LOVE it although I am not a fan.  Might like it made into balls instead of baked so I will most likely make it again.  I'm sure my kids will insist.

I love love love this popcorn!  I definately recommend putting it on a foil-lined cookie sheet and baking it at 220 for about 20-30 minutes.  It gets less sticky that way.  This disappears at my house in less than 5 minutes and its reccommended again almost as soon as is gone.  Absolutely delicious!

This popcorn is sooo good! I used my hot air popper for the popcorn. I also baked it at 250 deg. for 1 hr, stirring every 15 mins. This makes it crunchy. Soooo yummy! My family and friends eat it up!

This was superb.  It made a lot, so the next day I spread the leftovers out on a cookie sheet and placed it in my hot oven (had just turned it off after baking) let it sit for about an hour or so, and it turned into PB cracker jack.  The kids LOVED it!

This is excellent and very easy to make. I don't use microwave popcorn so I just made air popped popcorn, I used 6 T of popcorn kernals and he ratio was good for the mixture. this is the 2nd batch. I made it a few nights ago and the kids requested it again tonight.

I would give this ten stars if I could! So good, so addictive, watch out you might gain a few pounds from this!! I did bake it to dry it out as well. The third time I made it I added more peanut butter but it wasn't as good. If you add more pb, then add more marshmallows too. You really need that sweet and stickiness from the marshmallows. Make this recipe, you won't be sorry!!

Loved it! I used marshmallow cream because I did not have any marshmallows, and it turned out great! I followed others' advice and crisped the popcorn in the oven on 300 for 7-10 minutes.

This was excellent.  I made a few adjustments hoping to make it a little less fattening.  I may have succeeded at it but it doesn't make a difference if I eat the entire bowl.  

I air popped popcorn to fill a Tupperware THATSA Bowl about 3/4 full (appx 1 1/3 cup of kernels).  I used a full jar of marshmallow creme, 3/4 stick of I Can't believe Its not Butter and a little less than a small jar of Reduced Fat Peanut Butter.  Substituted Splenda Brown Sugar (appx. 3/4 cup).  I didn't bake it but next time will as it was a bit chewy but everyone else who ate it thought it was perfect.  Already made a 2nd batch.  You really can adjust the quantities of ingredients to your liking.  Cut back on brown sugar if too sweet, add PB if you like flavor.  Very good basic recipe though.

This was fabulous! I am not a big fan of peanut butter but this wasn't a strong peanutty taste so even I loved it. I only popped one bag of lite popcorn (I like to use lite in flavored popcorn because it doesn't have much of a buttery or salty taste) but used the full amount of coating. I did take the suggestion to crisp up the popcorn, after coating it, (I was freaking out over the sticky hands!) in a 200 degree oven for 30 minutes ...stirring every 10 minutes or so. My grandson kept saying (in between mouthfuls), "This is soooo good, Honey!"  He wanted to make sure we saved enough for his family. :o) Thanks for helping me make his time w/ me special!

if I had read reviews first, I would have finished this off in the oven.  However, prepared as originally written, this recipe is a bit too gooey and sweet (and I love sweets!).  With some of the minor tweaks of other reviewers, this would be a 5 star review.

Quick and easy! I altered the recipe just a bit by popping my own kernals (3/4 cup)and with a bit less brown sugar. I also only used a half a stick of butter and a few less marshmallows. After I melted it in increments and mixed it into the popcorn, I sprinkled some table salt over it to bring out the flavor. YUM!! Next time I'd like to throw in some peanuts.

Delicious! I followed the recipe as written, except I used 1/2c coconut oil in place of the butter. I also sprayed a cookie sheet with Pam and baked the popcorn coated with the mixture at 300 degrees for 10 minutes. Addicting!

Whoa!  This is good!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 3/4 cup of peanut butter and a handful of peanuts.  I used two bags of popcorn and used a large disposable roasting pan to gently stir and coat the popcorn.  I did not find it too gooey like others did. I will make this many more times! Thanks!

I had to use mini marshmallows and non-microwave popcorn. I used 3 cups of minimarshmallows and 1/2 cup uncooked popcorn kernels to make the popcorn. I used 1/2 cup of peanut butter per other reviews and I chose to shape mine into balls before it cooled. They were delicious!

It was amazing. I do suggest adding more peanut bitter otherwise it tastes alot like carmal corn. I added another tablespoon of peanut butter. and used marshmellow cream since I didnt have marshmellows. I used extra butter popcorn. I love the gooeyness and the stickyness. definately one to try when there is more than just me at home.

I have made this just as the recipe says and I love it! It has a great peanut butter taste. And I like the  gooey-ness from the peanut butter. (No oven baking for this girl.) I put leftovers in the fridge and the popcorn turns out great cold too. This is a great recipe.

Wow! This was good, I don't even like marshmallows!  I ended up using a stick of butter because I didn't have margarine. And of course my kids loved it! Thank you for the recipe:-)

This is super yummy!! I added a little salt onto fresh air popped corn, and sprayed a cookie sheet w cooking spray,then baked the mixture at 250 for about 30 min. My 3 kids,plus 4 extra kids LOVED this while gooey still,and ate the gooey scrapes left in the bowl! My 5 year old said,"mom, this is the best PB popcorn ever,and I want u to make it for dessert every night!" and the 10 year old cousins said it was so good,and they can't stop eating it! I agree!!

A new family favorite.  I was hoping that the peanut butter part would harden on the popcorn like it does on caramel corn, but mine did not.  So the popcorn is kind of chewy.  I think that next time I will bake it on afterwards.  The flavor is great and even though I am not a huge peanut butter fan, I really like this.

This is SOOOOO delicious!! I'm making it as a snack to take on my brother's boat and this will be perfect!  I followed other reviews' suggestion and popped it in the oven for 20 mins at 200 degrees and as it cools it's great (not that it was bad gooey either - I ate a TON that way, before it made it in the oven).  Excellent!  Next time I'll make sure to have some peanuts to toss in at the end!  GREAT recipe!

I made a double batch of this for a girls movie night and 8 of us finished all of it! It was a huge hit. Everyone commented that it had a nice subtle peanut butter flavor and was perfectly sweet. Following other reviewers advice I baked it in the oven on a foil lined cookie sheet at 300 for 25 minutes to get it nice and crunchy. I also used real butter instead of margarine, just because it is my personal preference. Definitely recommended! Thank you for such a delicious recipe.

I have had requests for the recipe. Thank you! The only thing I changed is using butter instead of margarine and I used crunchy peanut butter. I didn't bake it and the next day when I was packaging it was perfect for handling, not gooey.

Oh. My. Goodness. This sinfully delicious recipe brought me back to my childhood. I followed the recipe exactly, though I did this all on the stove since I didn't have a bowl big enough that would fit in the microwave. For stovecop cooking, just put butter, marshmellow, brown sugar in a LARGE pot (a stock pot with high sides is best), and keep stirring over low heat until everything melts--5-7 minutes. Once it starts to bubble, turn off burner and add mix in peanut butter. Add popcorn and fold in with large spatula. Make sure you get the extra gooeyness at the very bottom!  I actually made popcorn balls with this recipe. After popcorn is thoroughly mixed with coating, wet hands slightly and pull out handfuls of popcorn according to the size balls you want. Shape into balls, but be careful--mixture is still pretty warm at this stage. Place popcorn balls on parchment paper-covered cookie trays to cool.   Finger-lickin' good!

Wow. This was good. As easy as rice krispy treats and no lengthy waiting on it to cool before you can cut them and enjoy. This was great and I can't believe I never thought of this before. Thanks for the great snack.

GREAT recipe.  I love the ooey-gooeyness of it.  I used 130 mini marshmallows instead of 20 big ones and 1 stick of butter instead of margerine.  Loved it.

Good stuff.  Using the stove top seems a lot easier.  I used only one bag of buttered popcorn.  Nice, simple snack.  As easy as rice crispy treats.

Followed the recipe except we used regular stove top popcorn. This was good! Intersting texture from the marshmallows, but satisfied our sweet tooth. We will make this again.

So easy and SOOOO good. I did as other suggested and put it in the over at 200 degrees for 20 minutes and it's perfect. Can I say that I was glad the bowl was so large because then I could stick my whole face in and lick off the sweet bits? Oh, I'm just kidding but it was that good. "Try it -- you'll like it."

Me and my husband made this on a movie night and we had a HARD time putting it down. Absolutely great popcorn. I did say, "the next time we make this, it should have more peanut butter. Can't quite taste it." I would recommend using 1/2 a cup of pb :-)

I am NOT big on caramel corn or popcorn balls so I thought I would hate this, but thought the family might like it so I gave it a shot.  Um....Delicious!!!  This recipe is super easy and is great as written.   The wife and kids think love it.

So good.    I also let the popcorn crisp up for 30 mins at 200 in the oven after popping it in the mic. In addition, I used 3/4 cup of organic peanut butter (a good balance with the sweetness of the marshmallows).    Definitely worth trying.

Good flavor with just the right amount of peanut butter. Not to overwhelming. But I feel this recipe is only worth it, if you go the extra step and put it in the oven to dry it out and crisp it up for a half and hour or so. Nobody could guess that it was made with peanut butter! YUM

Crunchy, salty and sweet!  When I tried microwaving the mixture, it didn't work out.  The marshmallows kept popping out of the bowl, I ended up switching to melting it in a pot.  I think I burnt the mixture, because it turned out more like caramel popcorn, but it still tasted good.  I also used the oven to crisp the mixture.  A little on the salty side.  I will try this again, and try to tweak it to make it better. Update: I just couldn't wait to try this again.  I followed the recipe, except I cooked it on the stove from the beginning.  MUCH BETTER!!!!  It made enough coating this time, what a huge difference.  I still put it in the oven to crisp as others had suggested.  GREAT RECIPE!!!!

I took the reviewers advice and baked it then i let it sit for about 10 minutes but it was still a little gooey so i put it in the fridge for about an hour and it was the way that i like it, like Cracker Jacks. My kids loved it too.

Great recipe! I used air popped popcorn and followed others' advice to bake at 200 degrees for 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes.  Turned out perfect and yummy, will definitely make again!

This was OK. It tasted like a "Nutter-Butter" sandwich to me. I used 1/2 the amount of margarine (actually it was smart balance margarine). I too used fluff instead of marshmallows. It was sweet and crunchy. After I poured the peanut butter mixture on it - I spread it in a huge roasting tin and baked it at 250 for 35 minutes - tossing it every 10 minutes. I prefer caramel popcorn to this.

Great snack!! I used air popped poppcorn & i had to add m&m's and its now like a reeses flavour.  i have another recipe for marshmallow popcorn, and do recomend putting in the oven to dry it out, although i only do it for a short time as i like it a bit chewy. Thanks for the recipe!!

Hubby says it is the best carmel corn he ever had, gotta be true!!! :) I made it for a movie night tonight , but he got to it first!
I added to the melted mixture the swirled chocolate/peanut butter chips and poured it over the corn, then sprinkled some chopped pecans and Heath chips over that before toasting 20 minutes in the oven. I stirred the batch probably three times to keep it all mixed well. THANKS for the recipe!

This was a great recipe. I the popcorn just the way the recipe said to then went back to make sure I did it right because it was a bit to gooey. You really have to put it in the oven to crisp it up, then you have a masterpeice.

Excellent and very tasty!  The first time I made this; I couldn't really taste the peanut butter flavor, not enough.  Next time, I added a cup of peanut butter and it was great!!!

This is very good, added almonds and M&Ms when mixing.  I think it would be a little better if I toasted it in the oven.  I may tried to do that with the leftovers tomorrow?

Great recipe. I added reeses pieces, 1 tsp of vanilla, honey roasted peanuts and toasted coconut. The best vanilla to cook with I found is Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla if you can afford it. Quite expensive but very yummy.

What fun to make and eat this recipe. I hard a hard time finding the plain (no buttery flavour) popcorn but am glad I did. I used 1/2 cup of peanut better and added 1 cup of chopped salted peanuts at the same time I added the peanut butter. I took the suggestion of many other reviewers and put the mixture on two cookie sheets to crisp at 250 degrees F for 20 minutes. The taste of the popcorn is reminiscant of cracker jacks with a peanut butter twist.

Oh my- this isn't a low cal treat, is it? So what- yummy! I zapped the marshmallow mixture 4 minutes total, then added double the peanut butter & zapped one more minute. Did the recommended 30 minutes at 200 on 2 cookie sheets- let cool. Definitely do this- gets rid of the goo. Wonderful, easy. Thanks!

I love PB and am on a current popcorn kick and this recipe really did the trick. I did as previous reviewers did and put it in the oven once it was mixed. It was very tasty, I think next time I will add peanuts and chocolate drizzle.

This was a good recipe and super easy. I made the mistake of using microwave buttered popcorn and at first was disappointed. I think next time I will use a no butter microwave popcorn as I like the ease of micro popcorn. Even with using the buttered popcorn after letting it cool and baking it a little it was still good. I even added some melted white chocolate to some and it was awesome.

Very sweet, very peanut-buttery, very crunchy.  I made a half batch and we finished it in one sitting.  It tasted like a cross between peanut butter rice crispy treats and peanut butter fudge.  If you like those sweets, this one is worth a try!

This is a great little treat!!  I had some corn cereal I needed to use so I substitued about 9 cups of that cereal for the popcorn.  I also used butter instead of margarine.  I thought it turned out very tasty but with this sauce, I'm sure anything you add to it would be great!!

This is really good!  I made a few changes;  I had to substitute mini marshmallows & used 200 of them.  & I didn't use the microwave but rather cooked the mixture on the stove until it bubbled so the sugar would disolve completely.  & It seemed very gooey after I mixed it into the popcorn so I followed the advice to bake it in the oven for 30 minutes.  WONDERFUL!  I will keep this recipe on hand for filling gift bags for holidays!

While normally not a fan of popcorn mixed with anything, I loved this.  The coating would make a good dip overall, as the kids were dipping everything they could get there hands onto while I was making it (on the stovetop), even the rest of the marshmallows. Great recipe!

FANTASTIC popcorn!! I made this w/ air-popped popcorn & then put it in the oven @ 200 degrees for 30 minutes (stir every 10 minutes) to crisp up a bit. I also drizzled melted chocolate (almond bark) over it... yikes, even more fabulous!! Everyone loved it...I made it to give as gifts & my family scarfed it up, so I had to make several more batches. Bummer! :o)

Oh boy addictive! I used a half cup peanut butter as per others suggestions. 
I also agree with other reviews that this needs to be baked after the initial coating to “dry” the popcorn or it’s too gooey. Then you get the right consistency of coated popcorn. I baked at 300 degree oven for a half hour tossing after 10 minute intervals

The peanut butter popcorn was great. In fact, maybe too great. Ate the whole thing in about two sittings.

This was amazing.  I followed the recipe exact- but put the popcorn in the oven at 300 for 20 minutes to make it more crisp.

I've made this twice, both times weighing out 3.5 ounces of plain unpopped kernels, then cooking them on the stove -- both times this was more than enough popcorn for the amount of mallow mixture. I used butter instead of margarine, added a bit more peanut butter, some dry roasted peanuts, and kosher salt. Based on others' suggestions I also baked it at 200ºF for 30 minutes to crisp it up.

Love this popcorn w/ a few tweaks. I make it with air-popped popcorn & then put it in the oven @ 200 degrees for 30 minutes (stir every 10 minutes) to crisp up a bit. I also spread it out over wax paper & drizzle melted chocolate almond bark over it... to make it even better! Dangerous stuff.... so good. : )

Incredible!!! I followed this exact recipe and it was divine but incredibly sweet. For my second batch I used natural peanut butter and twice as much. In my opinion that tasted even better! I then drizzled melted milk chocolate on top. Huge hit!! Tip: keep stored in the freezer for a crunchy treat!

Definitely tasty. As a peanut butter nut I doubled the peanut butter. I think it can be enjoyed as a gooey treat, or dried, depending on your preference. You weren't kidding when you said it was sweet!

I received this recipe today in my daily email from allrecipes.com, and I had to make it this evening.  Crazy good!  I only had one bag of popcorn, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Gooey, warm, peanut-buttery delicious.

Gooey = Fabulous! I love that this one stays gooey! Sure, bake it if you don't want to try something new, or leave it as is and remember how much fun it is to get messy with your food again!

Yummy! I saw this recipe and immediately made it for my kids afternoon snack. The school bus isn't even here yet and I may have to make another batch! So good! I did use other reviews and baked it at 200F for about 30 min, stirring every 10 min. I also used butter instead of margarine.(nasty stuff) Thanks for a very tasty treat!!!

I appreciate the idea for this recipe and look forward to trying variations of this. I found this peanut butter popcorn to be much too sweet. So sweet that my wife and I could only eat one handfull. I tasted the peanut butter flavor for several hours. As the recipe states, if you love peanut butter and popcorn, this may be for you. We plan to use the main concept of this recipe to try other variations. Thank you.

Delicious, simple to make, and fun for the fam and I! -A perfect sweet to make when you want to treat your little ones with a little something extra to go with a family-night movie :0) -It did help to bake the popcorn mix at 200 degrees for roughly 20 minutes.

Followed advice of other reviewers--cooked my butter, sugar, marshmallows and peanut butter on the stove and once I mixed the popcorn with it, put it in the oven for 30 minutes.  Some reviewers thought there wasn't enough peanut butter so I added two extra tablespoons.  It's good, and I'd try it again, maybe with some chocolate too.

The consistency was off.  It never hardened, and it actually seemed to be lacking in flavor.  It may have been too much butter, but not really sure.

This is great. I used 'Smart Balance' popcorn and butter. So that cut a little of the salt and fat, but I did sprinkle with a little salt when done. Added about a cup of peanuts and left over x-mas M&M's. I'll be making this again.

This recipe is so good.  I made it tonight for a special treat for me and my kids.  I cut the amount of popcorn in half and almost doubled the amount of "sauce".  It turned out great.  It was a little gooey, but we liked it that way.

This tasted a lot like Scotcheroos.  If you like them, you will love this.  I drizzled the popcorn w/melted choc. chips so that may have affected the taste somewhat.

I made it without the brown sugar and it was still overwhelmingly sweet and gooey. But the kids still ate it, of course. I would like more peanut flavor and it is ok for a change, but I would stick with carmel corn.

I'd say 4.5 stars. REALLY yummy. REALLY easy. But really gooey and messy, even with crisping it in the oven for 30 min (stirring every 10). It was absolutely delish, however, and completely finger-licking-good! Just the thing when you've got a serious craving for something sweet AND a little salty... Not to mention crunchy and chewy. A huge hit with my PB-lovin' family of 5!

This snack tirned out okay. It was really sticky, so I took the advice and popped it in the oven at 250 for about 20 minutes. I don't know if it was the extra cooking in the oven or what, but it sort of lost it's peanut butter flavor. I might make this again to see if it will turn out better for me.

Easy and fun!  I added 1 cup salted peanuts and my family loved it!  I also put mine on 2 greased cookie sheets in the oven at 200 for 20-25 minuttes to crunch it up.

I dried my popcorn in the oven for a few minutes as suggested, so it wasn't sticky.  However, I thought it tasted too much like caramel corn. My guests didn't think it was anything special either. I probably won't make this recipe again.

Wow!  This is better than I had expected.  I tried putting half of it in the oven (as a previous reviewer suggested - 25 minutes at 200 degrees), and although it didn't exactly make it crunchy, it did make it less gooey.  If I were going to give this as a gift, I would definitely bake it first (and I am thinking about tying small bags of it with ribbon to top a plate of cookies as a gift).  It was also a fun recipe for my four-year-old son to help with, since it is mostly just a lot of stirring and pouring.  We will definitely be doing this again!

Yum!  I loved this recipe.  I may add more peanutbutter next time.  I used a mini microwave popcorn bag and changed the serving size to 1 instead of 6.  It was the perfect amount for one person who was willing to share a little. :)

This was tasty. I only used 2ish tablespoons of butter instead of the 1/4 cup for half a recipe, but it still came out. I could have stuck the popcorn into the oven to make it crispy, but I wanted peanut butter popcorn and I wanted it right then, so I just ate it a little sticky. Still tasty stuff.

I've made this three times and love it. I prefer what one reviewer did and make the full topping and pour it over one bag of popcorn.  I just really like the topping, but it would be less sugary if I poured the top over two bags instead. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a delicious treat. My family loved it. I found it a little too greasy though. Next time I will use air popped pop corn rather than microwave since the prepackaged stuff usually comes already buttered. I will also cut back on the margarine too. It was a hit with the family so I will make it again for sure.
