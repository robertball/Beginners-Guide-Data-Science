The flavor was good, but this juice was too strong for me. I'd add half a cucumber or some watermelon (with the rind) to dilute it (both add water and nutrients without significantly changing the flavor).

I don't have a juicer. I use a vitamix which allows me to get the entire nutrition from each vegetable or fruit. I followed the recipe entirely. I used a mango as opposed to the papaya. I love not having to add any sugar or sweetener into my juice, and I love knowing what goes into it! Watch out naked brand juice this is an amazing blend!
