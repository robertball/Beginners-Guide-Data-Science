I lived in the florida keys for years and this is not a good way to make it. If you want to know the real way....cook a pork roast in a crock pot all day til it falls apart. Cook in pan with onions and garlic, cumin, salt and pepper. Squeez lime juice at the end. Dont put cilantro in it....it does not belong in there! serve with black beans and yellow rice.

It was very good.  I made it in the pressure cooker to save time.  After cooker reaches stabalized pressure I let it cook for 10 minutes.  Then I turned off heat and let it sit for 30 minutes without removing the lid of the pressure cooker.  The pork was so tender it fell apart as I tried to remove it from the pot.  My advice if you do use pressure cooker is to only add the 16 oz of water or else the flavor is not as strong.  I used 24 oz water and I had to add more spices later while It was frying.  To avoid dry pork, I stir fried it on ultra high heat until it was toasted on the outside and added the onions during the last 5 minutes.   Remember, you want it moist and tender inside and crispy on the outside so you must use high heat  to accomplish this.  Maybe a couple of bay leaves might make it better too.

I just made this recipe with a 4# pork shoulder and it came out wonderfully. Couple of things - today's pork is a bit lean - if it won't fry well, add a bit more olive oil. And, if the meat starts getting too dry, add some of the water it was cooked in.

I went out on a limb to try something different and I'm glad I tried this recipe. I took the advise below and added cumin when crisping the pork, And I (gladly) omitted the cilantro since I'm not a fan. My husband LOVED this. He was getting all creative (which isn't the norm) and asked if we can have it with pickled cabbage on a toasted bun next time. So, it looks like I'll be making this again! (Also, I should note: Due to the reviews of dry pork, I covered the pan after adding the onions & garlic. I also added in some lime zest.) Thanks for the recipe.

I planned tonight’s meal carefully but regrettably this was not the hit I had hoped it would be.  I cooked the meat (country style ribs which could tolerate the long cooking time without drying out) in the crock pot and was disappointed it had so little flavor.  At this point I’m thinking the last step, frying it up and adding onion, garlic and lime juice, would take care of that.  It did not.  All that step managed to do was dry it up, and even tho’ a GOOD amount of butter and olive oil doctored that right up, you shouldn’t have to do that with a good recipe.  I served this with yellow rice and Cuban Black Beans II, also from this site.  I ate mine as is, but it definitely could have used some sort of sauce to moisten it up and make it more palatable.  Hubs took care of his with a good plop of sour cream. Shouldn’t be.  If I was to make this again I would NOT fry the meat.  I’d cook the onions and garlic till tender, add the meat and just heat it through, then add the cilantro and lime juice.  And I wouldn’t think of making this with a lean cut of meat like boneless pork chops – that’s just asking for trouble.  Bottom line, this was only mediocre, and mediocre is disappointing to me.

I added mesquite seasoning & eliminated the salt (the seasoning has quite a bit already) & I used a chicken broth/white wine combo instead of the water. I used a homemade broth & the wine I used was a sauvignon blanc...was probably a 2 to 1 ratio of broth vs wine. I sauteed my onion until translucent before adding the pork because I wanted it juicy not crispy. ;o) We used the pork to make tacquitos & I served them w/ a mango jam/ mango hot sauce/ yogurt concoction for dipping...best taquitos (are they tacquitos or are they flautas?) I ever had.  Thansk for the recipe!

I thought this was as good as any pork dish I've had out for Cuban food. I used a tenderloin cut into chunks instead of chops. I also used freshed garlic and extra thyme in the boling process. I also needed extra oil and salt when I fried the meat. Otherwise delish!

This was very, very good.  I served it in soft corn tortillas.  I did not need to cook it for as long as stated.

Everyone liked this recipe.  I used a tenderloin, but will use a fattier cut of pork next time so that it will break down more, absorb more flavor, and get crispier.  To make this a complete meal you really should serve it with Yellow (saffron) rice and black beans.

Great taste.  As the submitter recommended, I served alongside black beans and rice, I will definately make again.

This recipe was great.  I used a little bit more olive oil and it came out delicious.  My family was asking for seconds and thirds!!

Very very good!  The pork doesn't pick up as much flavor from the broth as you'd think, but it is still soooo good!

I added green onions and Pineapple to the final skillet!  The pineapple adds a nice sweetness that i think totally completes the recipe.  Plenty of Cayenne pepper (to both the broth and the skillet!) adds a great kick.  I also added some tabasco to when frying the pork and ingredients, and that turned out great.

I used a roast because I couldn't find boneless pork loin chops.  As a result, the pork was a little dry but, nonetheless, had great flavor.  Excellent with black beans and rice.

A fairly easy recipe to follow.  Taste is a bit underwhelming, and the pork was a bit dry (probably due to leanness of modern pork cuts).  Definitely a good start to begin experimenting from.

Awesome!!! This turned out absolutely perfect!! I was looking for something that would be quick, compared to slow cooker and this was ready in about 2 hours. I read in past comments that it was dry so at the end I used the broth to saute the meat adding little by little. I also used some of the broth as my water for my rice. It all was excellent!! Will make again and again!!!

This was really good.  I used bone-in pork chops and followed the recipe as stated to boil them.  The only addition I made to the boiling part was 1/2 teaspoon cumin.  I also added the juice of 2 limes.  After I boiled it I cut the meat off the bone and shredded it.  I then fried it with the onion, garlic and lime juice (i also added 1/2 lime extra) until crispy, took about 10 minutes.  After that I served it with black beans and rice.   Very good!  Thanks for the great recipe.

The taste was okay, but I was disappointed by how dry it was, like wood chips, no sauce at all.  My husband, who was raised on Cuban food, said "what is this?"

Great in burritos alongside black beans, cheese, greens, sauteed onions and peppers, and mexican or spanish rice. I usually add a little lime juice directly to the meat AFTER cooking just to give some more limey zing!

Yummy and different way to serve pork.  Could have used a bit more flavor for my taste, but still very good as is.  Served w/black beans and rice and corn.  Will make this again.

this is a great base recipe.  i put a pork tenderloin in the crockpot for about 5 hours and then shredded it when it was done and fried on the stove until crispy.  i spooned a bit of the sauce that the pork was cooking in just at the end so it wasn't too dry (we found it was way way too dry without doing this).  also, instead of using water i used chicken stock and also added in a teaspoon of whole cloves, a tablespoon of cumin, 3 whole dried red chiles, and 3 bayleaves.  i served this with yellow rice and tortillas, guacamole & plantain chips... great meal!!!

I used my pressure cooker to make this. It came out fantastic. I used 1 cup of the water, lime, a splash of OJ, cumin, thyme, onion and garlic powder, salt and pepper. I cooked it at full pressure for 10 mins and let it release on it's own (about 30 mins). When she says crisp in the directions, she just means browned. The lime at the end just brightens everything up. I did not use the cilantro. I served this with white rice and black beans. You could use the meat for a sandwhich, enchiladas, tacos, burritos, even on a salad with cilatro lime dressing from Trader Joes. Yummy!

This did not taste like Lechon, it was dry and relatively flavorless even though I added cumin and extra spices. The only thing I changed was that I cooked the roast in a slow-cooker first. Will not make again. Thanks anyhow.

I loved this shortcut version of the popular cuban dish.  I added a packet of sazon, and adobo seasoning (found in the latin isle of most grocery stores) The pork tasted like i cooked it all day.  very flavorful

Like Alleycat2, I used the pressure cooker following the instructions given in their review.  This pork came out terrific. I used thin sliced boneless pork chops. Having a hectic evening, I opted to serve this as a cuban-mexican fusion--shredded pork on flour tortillas with sour cream/lime/cilantro "sauce" and shredded lettuce.  Big hit with everyone, none left for lunch leftovers!

Used chicken instead of pork and then feasted for two days on the crispy, flavour filled delight.  I can see a margarita and tostado party coming up with this as the highlight....

This was a great and easy to make dish for very little money.

I had a can of government shredded pork, so instead of boiling it for 60 to 90 minutes, I did all the same things, but used one cup of water and boiled it until it until the water evaporated.

I also used reconstituted lime juice, leaf thyme from a spice tub, and ground pepper corns.

I didn't have any cilantro, so at the end I used two pinches of cumin instead.

I will make this again for an upcoming dinner event. Thanks, ZIBBLER!

This was a good recipe, that I don't think is fully developed. There is a lot of room for inspiration.

I made this with a pork tenderloin. I also used a carton of beef broth instead of water, to which I added some Chipotle powder and Adobo seasoning as well as the garlic etc. We had it in flour tortillas with the usual fixings (lettuce, sour cream etc etc). This was easy to make and was so tasty! Thanks!

Wow this was so delicious. So much flavor in every bite. We didn't change the recipe. Just added some shredded cheese and salsa at the end which I think was a great addition. Can't wait to make this again!

This was terrific! I had to cook it about an hour longer until it was tender, but my family (who doesn't like any kind of pork chop) just loved it and ate every bite! Thank you!!

I made this for dinner tonight and I thought it was delicious. I didn't have thyme or onion powder on hand so I substitued bay leaves, cumin seeds, and a sprinkle of oregano. I also thought this recipe needed WAY more than a pint of water to keep the meat covered during boiling (I even used less than 1 lb of meat). Next time I make this I think I am going to throw in some ortega chiles at the end.

I served this recipe with black beans, tortillas, and salsa.

Just made this dish for dinner. It was fantastic. I ended up using at least twice as much water to keep the chops covered, so I also doubled the thyme (added another big sprig) and peppercorns. I served this with red beans and rice, and thought it tasted best when I mixed the meat/onion mixture with the beans and rice on my plate. On its own, the shredded meat is hard to keep on a fork! It needed the moisture of the rice and beans, and the blending of the flavors was superb! Yum! This will also be terrific on tortillas, with a bit of melted cheese.

I thought this was "ok." The flavor was good (with plenty of lime), and I liked the onions and garlic in it.  Seemed to work best in tortillas along with black beans, cheese, ect...

I was not impressed, and neither was my family. The pork was dry, even though I took the advice of other reviewers to add more oil and lime juice at the frying stage. I also found it rather bland. I wouldn't make this again, tho I'm sure there are some tricks that might make it more interesting.

Great flavor! After removing the pork from the broth, I reduced it down to half and mixed into white rice to serve on the side. Yummy!

GREAT RECIPE!  My husband I have enjoyed this a few times now, and I am making it for my brother tonight.  He is not a big fan of trying new things, but I am sure he will like this.  We serve the pork taco-style with all the trimmings, and use our pressure cooker to speed up the cooking time (takes about 15-20 minutes), and the meat comes out so tender!  Thanks for the great idea!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I used more than 2 tbsp of olive oil and added a little bit of water to the frying pan to give it some juice.  I think next time I will add more lime juice and cilanto.

I chunked the pork instead of shredding it, I used 4 TB of olive oil for the final fry instead of 2 and I don't like cilantro so I left that out.

My husband and I loved this recipe!

I made this for a family get-together, and it was a big hit.  So flavorful!   The only changes I made were: I used a pork shoulder instead of chops and I didnt add the onions. Instead, I added onion power and sauteed sweet onions separately and served them as a side dish.

Pork was dry and needed more than what the recipe calls for. I will use the remainder in tacos. Most reviews mention that they will use a fattier cut of pork but I like to cook healthy so will not do that.

OMG this recipe was so good.  Reminded me of my days living on Miami Beach and going to a small Cuban restaurant called Puerta Sagua at least 3 times a week.

I put my pork on a baguette, added some Swiss and toasted it in the oven and then dipped it the "au jus" prior to savoring each awesome bite.  Because I added an onion to my recipe... it was delicate and offered the perfect complimentary flavor profile to one delicious meal.

Will definitely make it again.

Kids and adults loved this dish.  We  always make a point of stopping at Havana Harry's and the Versailles Restaurant for Cuban pork chunks when in Miami.  This recipe produces a dish just as delicious as what we have found at these favorite restaurants.

This recipe was a big hit with the whole family, including some very picky eaters (not moi). I tweaked the recipe slightly for convenience and to suit our tastes. I let a 1# boneless pork loin marinade in lime juice, evoo, salt, pepper, onion powder, thyme, and lots of cumin & garlic overnight in the fridge. The following day I seared the entire roast and placed it in a crockpot. I deglazed the pan with 2c. chicken stock adding more lime juice, peppercorns, onion powder, cumin, & garlic also. I added this to the crockpot also & allowed it to cook on high 2.5-3 hours. Then I shredded the pork in the crockpot. I sautéed thinly sliced green pepper & onion, added the shredded pork, as well as even more garlic & cumin and fried it all approximately five minutes. I added more fresh lime just before serving. I served this with lime & cumin infused jasmine rice, spicy stewed black beans with diced tomatoes, warm tortillas, and a serrano ginger sauce. It was crazy good. I can't wait to make it again.

This was so good! I didn't like the idea of not getting dinner on the table in under 2 hours on a work night, so when I was home over my lunch hour, I mixed up the water, lime juice, and seasonings in my slow cooker, added the pork chops, and cooked them on high for 4.5-5 hours. When we got home, they were perfectly tender and fell apart. Fried up with the onions and garlic per the original recipe, and I had dinner on the table in under half an hour. Served with rice and warmed corn tortillas. So great and easy - can't wait to make this again!

The caption for the photo with this recipe says "15 minutes in the pressure cooker" (with all the ingredients from step 1) and "5 minutes in the pressure cooker without heat", then on to step 2.  I did exactly this, except the meat ended up sitting in the pressure cooker longer without heat, which I figured would only help it.  It was delicious.  If it's dry, you're frying it too long - it says until "almost crisp".  Will make again.

I love Cuban food and this did not disappoint!  My kids and husband loved it and can't wait to have it again.  Very easy to prepare.  Delicioso.

My family loved this Cuban pork  with black beans and rice. I used the left overs to make taquitos wrapped in corn tortillas and then fried in corn oil. This is definitely a keeper!

My meat was dry but it could have been the cut I used; still tasty and I'll try it again.

I was looking foward to making this.  I was disappointed.  The last step made the pork very dry, my husband called it "pork pellets".  I am still in search of good recipe for this.

Very tasty, but think that I cooked it a bit too long :(.  I will definitely make it again though.

This was so good!  It was pretty easy to make and had a wonderful flavor.  I'm not a big fan of pork chops, but I will definitely make this again.  The only changes I made were to use fresh garlic and onion.  I don't even keep powdered versions in my house because the flavor from fresh ingredients is so much better.  We ate it with homemade pico de gallo, wrapped in warm flour tortillas.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

Would other reviewers let me know how they served this pork?  I served it with black beans and rice, but maybe it should be served in a tortilla with some kind of sauce?  I found the pork too dry - the recipe did say fry until crisp....

Very good recipe, and super easy to make. It did turn out a tiny bit dry, which might be solved with some additional oil.

Excellent! I did add a liitle more seasoning to the broth. It came out very tender and when you combine the cilantro and lime it like a POW! party in your mouth with all the different flavors. This is going into my recipe box. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Nice! I really enjoyed the difference of shredded-ness with the chops! Will experiment with other flavorings (bbq, fruit, etc.) in the near future.

This was a really good recipe! Instead of shredding the pork before frying, I left them chunked. Also, I was told to fry them really slow and it turned out great!

My husband and I really liked this one!  Next time I will used a chop with a bone in it for a little more flavor as well as double the lime juice in the last step.  The pork was a little dry but I will not use more olive oil since we try to stick to low fat dishes.  With balck beans and rice this was FANTASTIC.  It took more water than a pint so I had to add extra peppercorn etc.  Very good!

Wow! I made this recipe for dinner and altered the recipe by using chops with bones. Served the shredded pork with spicy black beans, rice and fried plantains. The whole family, including two very picky kids, loved it! I am definitely making this one again. Thanks for sharing!!!

Very tasty and easy - just took a little while.  Used bone in center chops and cooked in broth a 1/2 hr longer; salted to taste at final step.  Served like a soft taco, but was very good all by itself over rice
