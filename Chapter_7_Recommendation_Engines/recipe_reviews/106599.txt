Be careful to use a bottled slaw dressing you are familiar with or just make your own with mayo, vinegar and sugar.  I used a bottled slaw dressing and it made the salad taste yucky.

Very, very yummy!! I don't know how much 2.1 ounces of bacon is, because we always just put about 8 slices of bacon in, but this is a very yummy salad. It needs to be eaten quickly though, and isn't as good the next day because the bacon starts to absorb the dressing and gets mushy. Cooking the bacon until crispy, without being burnt, is definitely the best - it adds to the crunch of the salad, and takes a bit longer to mushify. (Is that a word?) ;)

This is a delicious recipe.  I made it for a church luncheon so I doubled it.  I didn't put as many raisins as it called for and used Marie's Cole Slaw dressing.  I didn't do this but it might be nice with some fancy shredded cheddar cheese in it.  This will be the recipe I make for all pot lucks and parties from now on.

I love this recipe. For even quicker preparation,use Hormel Real Bacon Pieces from a jar, sorry Bob Evans. I use a "coleslaw kit" and throw in the shredded cabbage and use the coleslaw dressing from the kit. This stretches the recipe for my book club. I always bring home an empty bowl.

I love this dish!  My mom has made it many times for me.  The only difference in the way we make it is we make our own slaw dressing, use peanuts instead of pecans, packaged real bacon bits (they don't seem to get soggy by the next day), and add some cauliflower.  Everything else is the same as the recipe and it is WONDERFUL.  Even my kids love this!

Substituted veganaise with balsamic vinegar and a bit of sugar, for slaw dressing, omitted the bacon, substituted roasted chopped walnuts for pecans.   Very good!

This salad is always a favorite with my family.  I use mayonaise instead of cole-slaw dressing.

This is such a good salad.  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  It's SO EASY to make, and perfect for any season, truly!  I used a Lite version of my favorite jarred slaw dressing, and cut back on some of the bacon in the salad.

I used a Lite coleslaw dressing, walnuts instead of pecans (sesame seeds are good too.) and cut down on the bacon as well. It is a family favorite at picnics and barbeques.
