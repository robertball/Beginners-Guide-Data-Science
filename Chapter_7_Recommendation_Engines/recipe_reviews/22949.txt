Excellent.  I doubled the recipe and it turned out great. When doubling, I used the entire bag of fresh cranberries (12 oz.) This is the recipe that comes off of the the Ocean Spray bag. Great bread for the holidays.  TIP - Be sure to cover the bread tightly with foil once it comes out of the oven for about 10-15 min.  It will steam and keep the bread super moist - a trick for all loaf quick breads.

We were so impressed with this recipe that I've decided to finally review a recipe here after using this site for nearly 2 years!  This is a phenomenal bread.  The base is wonderful and can be used with a variety of different fruits - strawberry, blueberry, cherry, dried mix, etc.  We prefer it without nuts and make it exactly as given except we use halved cranberries rather than whole.  We've used both fresh and frozen with no difference in quality.  When my husband first made this I was skeptical because I thought it would need more sugar and some other spices like cinnamon.  I was wrong!  The flavor is perfect as is.  The orange juice and zest give a sweetness and complexity that is just heavenly.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe with us!

This is a great recipe. It was a tad dry so I did make a few changes and the 2nd loaf came out excellent. Used 1/2 c. veg oil and 1/2 c. OJ (instead of 1/4 c. butter and 3/4 c. OJ). Used 2 eggs instead of one. Whisk all dry ingredients in a large bowl. Stir in the nuts, zest and the cranberries. In medium bowl whisk together all wet ingredients. Add wet all at once into the dry and stir with a big spoon until just moist. Proceed as recipe directs for baking. Enjoy!

A decent muffin-like bread.  I especially enjoyed it for breakfast when warmed and buttered.  As suggested by other reviewers, I used only one cup of cranberries; that seemed like the right amount.  I would, however, prefer to have more walnuts.  Also, be warned: the bread was done after 40-50 minutes of baking, not the 65 minutes the recipe claims. Incidentally, I used 60% white flour, 40% whole wheat flour (because I actually ran out of white flour).

I could not find fresh or frozen cranberries anywhere.  I instead used dried cranberries.  The orange-cranberry combination of this bread is heavenly.  I did, however, find it to be somewhat dry and crumbly as others have also stated.  Next time, I think I'll add a little more butter or perhaps even another egg to see if it is more moist.  This is a definite keeper in my recipe box!

Very good and easy. I didn't have an orange for zest so just used a little extra oj and it seemed orangey enough and moist. Also did not have to bake for whole time - was done about 10 minutes earlier.

This was very good.  Better if you make it a day or so ahead and let the flavors blend.  Excellent when you slice it and toast it and spread some cream cheese over it for a breakfast bread with coffee! Will make again.  I did add more nuts than it called for and I also toasted the nuts beforehand to add a little flavor.  Thanks Cathryn for sharing this recipe!

Great bread!  

I didn't have an orange so I cut up an apple and used apple juice instead of oj.  I also smashed a banana into the mix.

Super moist - wonderful taste!

FANTASTIC! A couple changes: 1/4 cup applesauce instead of butter, 1 cup pecans, 1 cup craisins (poured boiling water over the craisins for 15 min prior to using). I put a foil tent over and removed it during the last 7 minutes of cooking. It looked & tasted amazing! Thanks chef! Update: I wanted to make this again but I only had about a half a cup of craisins, so I made half the recipe (with the aforementioned changes) and instead of orange juice (didn't have any), I used diet cranberry pop and made 12 pink muffins that look so cute!

Anyone who ranks this less then a 4 star recipe either doesn't know how to read a recipe or follow directions! This is a good,solid recipe for Cranberry Nut Bread. It always cracks me up when someone gives a consis-
tent 4 starred recipe a low review and says it tastes bad. The majority rules-and they rank this as a good recipe-just the way you sent it in. I make my own adjustments but they never affect how I rank a rec-ipe as they are just a reflect- ion of my personal preferences. For example, I love toasted nuts in my recipes as I feel the toasting brings out the nutty flavor in the nuts. I also monkey with spices because we prefer more nutmeg or cloves or cinnamon then some folks. I really enjoyed this recipe.It's very close to my recipe & I've been baking and selling my Cran-Nut bread for 30 years.Congrat- ulations on a great recipe!!!

I have used the recipe for years and got it from my Mom.  It is SO good and very moist. I made a batch last night but added some blueberries for a little extra sweet/sour kick. The only change I make to this recipe is add 1 tsp. of vanilla.  Other than that I wouldn't change a thing. I have also made this recipe without the orange zest and it comes out perfectly fine.

I normally don't care much for sweet breads or desserts,
but this is very, very good! The balance between the
orange juice and zest, and the cranberries is very unique.
Followed recipe to a tee other than substituting vegetable
oil for the butter, and pecans for the walnuts. I did find
the baking time was way too long. Mine was done in 45
minutes. A 5 star recipe that is highly recommended!

This was a big hit with my family.  In transit, however, the loaf broke in the middle; best to take it on a plate or small cutting board.  It needs to be sliced thickly or it is too crumbly.

This is a good recipe. I goofed and overfilled my loaf pans for the first batch. It would've been a good reminder for those of us who don't bake too often if the recipe had stated to only fill the pan 1/2 to 3/4 full. Also, it took me a lot longer than 15 minutes prep time! But now I have it down, it should be easier next time.

The is absolutely the best cranberry nut bread I have ever had.  The recipe I used to use always was dry and crumbly.  Not so with this one.  I got rave reviews on this over the holidays.  I will make this every year for sure.  Thanks.

Made this for Christmas this year and it was a big hit with my family! After it cooled a few minutes on the wire rack I wrapped it in plastic wrap which helped maintain its moistures.

This was by far the BEST Cranberry Nut Bread I have ever baked.  Gave a loaf to neighbors who just raved about it.  This is definitely a keeper and definitely will make again.  
Also I saw that one reviewer said this is the same recipe on the bag of cranberry's -- IT IS NOT the same, this one is slightly different, which I think makes it better!

Very tasty, easy bread to make, did a few changes.  I doubled the recipe, hate to go thru all of that work for one loaf.  Then I added and extra egg, and instead of the butter added 1/2 cup of vegtable oil, also added about a tablespoon of cinnamon, hey what is a holiday bread without cinnamon!!!  I baked 4 loaves, 2 little ones and 2 bigger ones, perfect, delecious, pretty and great last minute gifts.

This bread is delicious and was easy to make.  The bread has a great mix of sweetness and tartness to it.  I would let it cooler a little longer in the pan as I almost broke my loaf in half because it was too warm when I tried to remove it.  I also cut my cranberries in half before adding them to the batter, and I am glad that I did so.

Wow - 10 out 10 on this one.  When you bite into this, you expect the tartness of the cranberries and then you get this subtle, wonderful orange flavour.  This is the best loaf I've ever made (and I've made a lot of them).  Definitely good enough for company or as a gift.  Thanks so much for sharing.

This recipe was fantastic!!!  I compared against the recipe on the Cranberry bag and the difference is this one uses Butter.   As I live in Northern CA and right now Mandarins are in season this is what I used.  I am going to make another batch tomorrow and freeze to serve at Christmas.

Loved this bread, a luscious balance of tart and sweet. I used frozen cranberries, which I had on hand, and orange extract in lieu of orange zest. Great accompaniment for breakfast or brunch.

I could easily eat the whole loaf all by myself.  I made the bread last night and it was great then but this morning it was so out of this world that I had to get right online and write about it.  It is moist and delicious.  I did make a glaze from orange juice and confectioners sugar, but even without it the bread would be excellent.

This was a wonderful treat!  I have made
it three times in the past two weeks!
I made the following changes: I used
freshly squeezed orange juice and I substituted pecans for the walnuts.  The first time I used fresh cranberries and 
the next two times I used frozen.  Great results with both!

This is almost identical to my top-secret cranberry bread recipe (which came from the back of the bag of cranberries!), with the exception that mine calls for 2 tbs. of shortening. Next time I make it I think I'll try the butter instead. Anway, OMG this is a TERRIFIC recipe and so easy! I just brought a loaf (made in a bundt pan just for kicks) to work and everyone raved about it. The orange flavor is very very light and so good with the cranberry. I also throw in about a cup of white choc. chips for extra deliciousness! So pretty and festive and wonderful!!!

This bread is fabulous!  The contrast of the tart cranberry and sweet bread is a great combination!  I made three mini loaves with this recipe. I found that if the bread sits for a couple of days, then the flavors blend and you have less contrast between the tart and the sweet.  It slices great and looks very pretty and festive.  I will be making this again!

This tastes great!  I doubled the recipe to make 2 loaves.  I also used oil rather than butter (was tempted to use applesauce, but didn't have any), and next time I think I'll cut the cranberries down to 1 cup per loaf.  It was a little heavy on the berries for me.  Edited to add:  This year I  still doubled the recipe and used the entire bag of cranberries.  However, I divided the dough into mini-loaf pans and it made 8 mini loaves.  Baked them about 30 min. till done.

This bread was exactly what I was looking for.  Came out perfect and the house smelled wonderful.  This is definatley a keeper.  Only change I made was using 1/4 cup of oil in place of the butter since I was being lazy and didnt feel like cutting the butter into the flour.  Came out perfect.  Makes the house smell like the holidays.

This was very good. I made a mistake and added 2 eggs instead of 1 egg. I cut down the cranberries from 1 1/2 cups to 1 cup. I think I might still cut down on the cranberries to under a cup next time when using walnuts. It was moist and very flavorful. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing your recipe Cathryn.

I used whole frozen cranberries  fresh squeezed orange juice (only because that is all I had, took more time but I was able to use up the oranges, and make the zest. I baked 70 minutes.  Next time I will raise the  shelf one notch higher.  I was afraid it was going to burn.  Very moist and good.  I think using the 
frozen berries without thawing  helped make a moister 
bread.  Will make again. We both just had a piece with 
coffee, nice afternoon break.

We loved this. The orange flavoring was just right. I only had two small oranges and was only able to
squeeze 1/2 cup of juice but it was still perfect. I also added 2 tbls. of veg. oil to make sure the bread was moist.

Excellent bread I will be buying cranberries and freezing them so I can make it all year round this recipe has replaced banana bread for sure.  I did sprinkle the top lightly with a cinnamon and sugar mixture just before I took it out.

Yum!  Made it as written--delicious--tastes like a fancy bread you would get at a coffee shop!  I doubled the recipe and used one 12 oz bag of cranberries for the whole thing as suggested by another reviewer.  I put the cranberries in whole.  Super easy to make a double batch then freeze one.  Thank you!

If there was the option for no stars, I would have given that.  I thought this was AWFUL.  I followed the recipe exactly (which I never do...) and it was gross.  The cranberries were extremely tart.  Even the bread part had a horrible taste and left a really bad after taste in my mouth.

I quadrupled this recipe and it made ten mini loafs which I gave away as part of my baked goods package to the neighbors and family. It was difficult to judge if it was done even with the toothpick test but the suggested cooking time turned out to be accurate for 10 mini-loafs in the oven at once. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a few dashes of nutmeg. This bread was sooooo good and gets better each day as the flavors meld. I even liked it better after refrigerating it for a couple of days. This is a heavey cake-like nutty-sweet-tart bread that tastes like Christmas but I will have to make it for myself all year because it is that good!

This was totally awesome! I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour in place of 1 of the 2 cups of AP flour.  I also used 1/2 cup zero calorie sweetner in place of 1/2 of the 1 cup white sugar. Instead of a loaf pan, placed the batter in mini muffin pans and made 48 mini muffins. After baking about 30 minutes, I placed cling wrap over them while they cooled.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I tried this recipe on Thanksgiving morning and both my husband AND my mother-in-law loved it!  It couldn't have been tastier.  The only note I would make is that I had to triple the amount of prep time than what was listed on the recipe.  I'm sure I'll get faster the more I make it, which will be a lot this holiday season.

This is the first time I used this recipe and found that it is a little on the dry side.  Also, the bread was done 10 minutes earlier than the recipe calls for. Other than that it is very tasty and will add vegetable oil in place of some of the oj.

I'VE MADE MANY A CRANBERRY BREAD, BUT THIS RECIPE IS WITHOUT A DOUBT ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER MADE. I DID SQUEEZE 
FRESH ORANGE JUICE AND LIGHTLY CHOPPED FRESH CRANBERRIES. MY NEIGHBORS RAVED 
ABOUT THE BREAD AND WANTED THE RECIPE.

Came out great.  I used orange extract in place of the zest, and it had a great orange flavor.  Nice and moist.  Had to check a couple of stores to find frozen cranberries.

Could have used a bit more sweetness to balance out the cranberries; otherwise a very good base bread that could be made with any fruit. Easy!

I used Cape Cod cranberries from the natural foods section, and this turned out soooo good! Pecans are a great substitute also.

This is delish! I used almond milk instead of 3/4 orange juice, but I did squeeze a whole orange in the batter. It is very moist and flavorful!

I substituted a heaping half cup of mandarin orange segments for the nuts. I hopped the cranberries using the food processor. I added the orange segments to the food processor after the cranberries were finely chopped. I used one quick pulse of the processor to break up the segments and distribute them evenly with the cranberries.

Excellent!  I made 3 changes, the first 2 out of necessity; I omitted the nuts, because I didn't have any.  I also only had craisins , so I bumped the cranberries  to 2 cups. The last change was that I made 24 mini muffins and 12 regular muffins. Minis took 20 minutes and regular took 27 minutes. All were devoured in short order. I can hardly wait to do it right!

Absolutely glorious. Probably one of the best recipes I've pulled off this website. Even my picky eater stepminion gobbled it up, and the kid hates nuts in bread like they're Voldemort. Don't worry about the amounts of the cranberries, walnuts, or zest-- I went super heavy on all 3, but it's a matter of taste of course. Something tells me it's pretty hard to screw this one up.

Made this bread tonight and hopefully there will be some left in the morning with coffee! It is so good and easy to make. Not sure about bad reviews, but a few tips: make sure eggs are at room temperature and that oven is preheated. Also, I didn't use butter, used smart balance instead. Remember, when baking measurements should be exact, don't eyeball it.

I felt like something sweet and I had these ingredients.  I was concerned because the batter was very dry and considered adding another egg or more orange juice but resisted.  I'm glad I did because it came out perfectly and got raves reviews.  I will definitely make it again as it was easy and very tasty.

Very good.  Baked it about 10 extra minutes to get it done, but I think it needed it due to the glass pan.  I chopped up about 1 cup frozen cranberries and put the last 1/2 cup in whole.  Easy and tasty.  I love the orange and the sweet and the tart all together.

This is a wonderful bread!  It goes together very quickly and is full of tart cranberries and nuts.  Yum!!!  A couple suggestions .... I used fresh cranberries and they were plump, so I chopped them up before adding them to the batter.   You don't want to chop them too much, but just enough so you have smaller pieces (and more of them).  Also, I had to make 20 loaves of this for an exchange, and I bought the paper bread pans from Amazon which are FABULOUS.   But because they are smaller pans, and paper, you don't bake the bread nearly as long.   I baked mine at 335 degrees (because my oven is a tad hot) and for 43 minutes.   That gave me twenty perfect loaves .... not a bad one in the bunch!

Wow! This was amazing. I made the recipe just as it was written and the bread was very moist and tasted terrific. I like to use pecans instead of walnuts. I am also lactose intolerant so I use margerine instead of butter and rice milk instead of milk. This turned out great and I will always make this from scratch!

I liked it, but my wife was not impressed.  I found the cooking time to be about five minutes too long.   Made the bread too dry

This is the perfect amount of flavor and my family loved them! We did muffins to decrease the baking time down to 15 minutes and they turned out perfect.

I really like this recipe, but I add over ripe bananas to it (2 for single recipe and 4 for double recipe). With the sweetness of the bananas & orange juice, I found it best to reduce the sugar to 1/4 or 1/3 cup per single loaf recipe.  The bread is so moist, requiring a longer bake time, according to your oven.  I'll keep this recipe in my favorites!

The only change we made was cranberries were from our Cranberry Bounce so they had a little enhanced flavor.  Came out just right, moist and tasty!

This bread was very good. I did use almonds instead of walnuts and put a teaspoon of almond extract in add to the flavor. Excellent bread. I will be making several mini loaves to put into the freezer.

I followed directions and read reviews before starting.  One consistent theme was to ensure that you did not bake the bread any longer than 50 min.  I did double the recipe and baked 2 pans together for 50 min.  the dough is so dense that it was not done inside.  I only found this out once i tried to remove the bread from the pans for cooling.  I tried to warm it again but to no avail.  I would not recommend doubling the recipe for this reason, and i would probably bake at least 60 min.

This would easily be a 5-star recipe except the instruction to remove the bread from the pan to a wire rack after 10 minutes left me with a mangled loaf. Otherwise, this is fantastic, especially with vanilla ice cream on top! A bite of the holidays!

This makes a very good cranberry nut loaf.  I substituted applesauce for the butter and increased the amount of walnuts.  It took a full 60 minutes in my oven.  I think this recipe would make great muffins too.  Thank you for the recipe!

I made this to take to a Christmas Tea with my knitting group and everyone loved it.  I like that it's really tasty without being too sweet--the tartness of the cranberries really comes through and I love all the nuts.  I used my food processor which made this super easy and I plan to make small loaves of this to freeze and give as gifts.  Fantastic recipe!

A great basic recipe, easy for a novice to pick up. After I made it couple of times I added variations such as adding in dates, dried plums, and raisins. I also substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar for white to pump up the flavor even more.

Made this tonight. From some reviews, I add another egg because I was afraid it might come out dry. The bread came out moist and crumbly. I couldn't find fresh cranberries so I used the dried cranberries. It worked out just fine. I spread butter to the warm bread. It was good. My husband love it!

I didn't care for this recipe... The only changes I made after reading the reviews were that I added another egg and I upped the butter to 1/3.  I thought it was quite bland---oh yeah, I DID only cook for 50 mins. and it was completely done.  Won't try again, the taste wasn't worth it. Have to find a different recipe.

The only thing I left out of the recipe was the walnuts because I didn't have them.  I don't know if its the cranberries or what but the bread was too sour for me, maybe next time I will use less than what the recipe calls for.

I subbed 1/3 cup toasted sesame seeds for the walnuts and cut back the amount of cranberries. the sesame gave it a deep nutty flavor that blended well with the tart cranberries. 5 stars to a simple, adaptable loaf

Have to say first time I made it, didn't come out too hot. Really dry. Well instead of putting a bad review I figured out what I did wrong. It was the temp. I cooked in a glass loaf pan. The second time I bought a new metal pan and looked up tips on baking quick breads. Well on glass (pyrex) pans and dark coated metal pans you need to decrease temp by 25 degrees. And this time it came out perfect. The top sunk a little, but I really liked the taste and how moist it came out.

I have to say that this is an OK bread.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out very dry.  The flavor is good, but it is very dense.  Maybe I didn't something wrong, so I made another one and it ended up the same.  very dense.  Maybe how it is suppose to be! LOL

This was terrific although it takes substantially longer to cook than the recipe says. We don't have fresh or frozen cranberries in Merida, Mexico where I live but I did find dried and they were terrif.

So good!  My fiance's Italian co-worker told him it reminded him of his mother's cakes back in Italy.  :)

I followed this recipe to a tee - although it came out looking beautiful, it was sooooo dry! I want to make this again but what can I do so it has more moisture to it??

Great, easy bread to make. I used dried cranberries and poured boiling water over them to moisten them.  Also used margarine intend of butter, slightly increased the amount and increased the amount of walnuts.  Cook time was more like 60 minutes.  Will make again.

Cranberry bread was delicious but didn't need to cook quite so long - 60 minutes was enough.  I left out the zest and use pecans chopped up - great!

Hmm...it was ok, I wasn't crazy about it and people hardly touched it at my Thanksgiving dinner. It had a salty aftertaste. I'd try it again, but with less salt.

Yep - just as everyone said, it's perfect.  Not too sweet.  I added more cranberries and nuts (personal prefrence), and it came out great.  Thanks for sharing.

My daughter and I made this with pecans instead of walnuts.  This is the best cranberry bread we've ever had.  It came out very moist and full of flavor.  We will definately make this again.
