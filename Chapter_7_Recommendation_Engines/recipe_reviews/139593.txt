This idea was money. I cut this recipe in half for one ginormous coffee for me. I used my own homemade chocolate syrup and sweetened with Starbucks cinnamon dolce syrup instead of Splenda. GREAT way to use up the leftover coffee I have in the mornings. (It's rare, but it happens.)
This will be made a lot in the summer, I can already tell.

Awesome icy treat! I just used cold coffee and crushed iced in my blender as I didn't want to take the time to freeze the cubes. I also used skim milk. I cut the Splenda down to 2 Tbsp. as I believe the original recipe called for 1/4 cup of regular sugar and 1/4 cup of Splenda would be waaay to sweet. This made more than enough for me and my husband to share. It was so good topped off with a whipped cream and little more chocolate syrup!

I thought it was delicious. I fourthed the recipe to make just one and added a small spoonful of chocolate frozen yogurt. It tasted like an icy milkshake. I will definitely make this again and maybe try to add some peanut butter. mmm. Thanks for sharing!

Very good alternative to Starbucks frappuccino :) Will save a lot of money making these. I don't buy splenda but I used sugar free chocolate syrup and used regular sugar instead of the splenda. I am considering other flavorings like adding a little vanilla to it for something like a vanilla frappuccino.... will use this over and over.

This is really good, especially considering it is sugar free. I had never thought to freeze the coffee in the ice cube tray. I used 2% milk, sugar-free choc. syrup also, and 2 packets of Truvia for the sweetener. This is actually the same recipe as iced mochas on Allrecipes, but with diet sugar. I topped it with light whipped cream and some chocolate crunch sprinkles. It makes a nice icy coffee chocolaty drink. Thank you!

I freeze left over coffee in ice trays & use it to make these often. I also add a handful of ice & blend in my ninja machine. Top with whip topping. Cocoa powder works if you can't have sugar. I make these like a slushy.  Love love love these!

I gave it five stars, but I make it without the Splenda.  I think it's sweet enough with just the chocolate syrup.  Skim milk works fine, and the measurements are a bit elastic, in my experience. Hint:  To avoid high-fructose corn syrup, choose kosher chocolate syrup.  I use Fox's U-Bet (love the name).  This is a VERY refreshing drink on a hot day.  Fast and easy, as long as you keep some coffee ice cubes on hand.

I love this recipes. I now freeze all my leftover coffee in cubes and make this mostly in the summer months. The only difference is that I use coffee syrup instead of chocolate. I also use suger free vanilla syrup instead of Splenda and a tsp of vanilla extract. For an adult beverage I add Amareto Disaronno. Yum!

A+ on this one. Saved a lot of money using the left over coffee in the morning. Was great for summer.  Didn't follow the recipe exactly it all depends on your taste for coffee.
