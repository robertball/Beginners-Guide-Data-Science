Great base recipe!  I made two (2) batches (slaps forehead ... simply had to as I can never just leave a recipe alone).  Original version was good - very good.  Modified 2nd batch to suit our tastes with only a few minor changes:  used a mixture of 70% beef & 30% spicy italian sausage, added 2 cloves of garlic, really browned the heck out of the meat & veggies (fairly high heat to get all that nice brown goodiness), sub 1/2 c red wine for water, and a squirt of tomato paste (maybe a T ???) just to get it a little more richness.  YUMMMM! Thanks so much for recipe... Update:  oh yikes - I boiled up some rigatoni, tossed it with the sauce, threw it in a baking dish, covered with cheese and baked for 30" covered, then 10" uncovered ... to die for

This was delicious!! My two girls (4 and 6) gobbled it up and had no idea they were eating carrots and celery. I added a little garlic and oregano and will add 1/2 c zucchini, green peppers, and mushrooms next time. I also used 1/2 Italian sausage and 1/2 ground beef. DELICIOUS recipe we will make again :)

This bolognese was absolutely AMAZING. . . It was a great combination with the spaghetti.I ran out of the store without celery but it didn't seem to matter much this time. This is definitely something that I will in my bag of tricks.

This was just what I was looking for...a good topping for spaghetti that wasn't too 'saucy.'  Wouldn't change a thing.

This is a very good basic recipe, and with a few adjustments and additions it was fantastic! I changed the order of operations a bit to get a smooth sauce with ground meat chunks in it. I saut√©ed the vegetables in my own chicken stock, and then added the other ingredients. While I had the temperature reduced I used my blender to get rid of any chunks. I then returned to the stove top, added 1 1/2 tsp of minced garlic, and 1/2 cup chardonnay, and salt and pepper to taste. Then I added the cooked ground meat, brought to a boil, then simmered for 45 minutes or so. It came out delicious! I only gave this  recipe 4 stars because I had to make so many adjustments to give it flavor. However, the recipe would likely have more flavor if I had used sausage.

This was every bit as good as everyone said it was! I did make one change, I substituted red wine for the water because water doesn't bring anything to the party!

The flavor was great but the sauce was watery which made for an unappealing presentation. For the trouble and time I would use a jar before making this again. I like very thick sauce that sticks on the pasta. 3 stars for flavor.

Awesome! Made this last weekend and was very pleased with the outcome. Quick and easy, hubby liked as well. This is a keeper. Did make a few changes to taste after reading reviews. Used a mix of lean ground beef and sweet italian sausage (about 1/2lb. each), added red wine instead of water and chopped up a few garlic cloves along with garlic powder. Topped with fresh parmeson cheese. This was way easier recipe than another I had tried and it was so much better. Thanks!!

This was a terrific recipe! Used half lean ground beef and half turkey sausage. Will make it again.

Very tasty, would avoid extra spicing if you buy seasoned, canned tomatoes.  To fix the wateryness, I just added some tomatoe paste to thicken the sauce up!!

I think this is a very good recipe but I do feel that 1 tsp of crushed thyme is too much.

This is by far the best spaghetti sauce. If you can use the italian sausage, do. It changes the whole flavor of the sauce. I also put 2 bay leaves in the sauce as it is cooking, and add sliced mushrooms. My husband likes this recipe only! mmmmm

My husband and I don't even like Italian sausage, but we decided to make it with that anyway. We're both glad I did because it was DELICIOUS!! No changes needed; we loved it exactly the way it was. You don't even realize you're eating veggies (not that I mind that but it's good for those who don't like veggies). I used wholewheat spaghetti and served with garlic cheese toast. Will definitely make again.

This was awesome.  i used italian style ground turkey for the meat, cooking it separate from the veggies so I could drain it well.  I added mushrooms to the veggies, then brought it all together.

Loved it! And my husband who hates red sauces loved it too. I didn't use the celery just because I didn't have any, I also used 2 tablespoons of Italian Seasoning instead of the dried basil and thyme, and added a little garlic powder. And of course I used red wine instead of the water. Served it over Ziti Pasta since that's all I had and Garlic Rolls. Yummy!!
