Really easy and tasty dressing.  Here is what I did...I substituted the sour cream with plain fat free yogurt and I doubled the crumbled bleu cheese.  We used this for dip for our Buffalo Wings.   I also Did Not use a blender.  I wanted it a bit chunky and it turned out really well.  I also only made enough for 10 servings and it was plenty for what I needed it for.  Will use this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing !!!

I love this dressing!  Most bleu cheese dressings on here have SO many ingredients, (most of which I don't always keep on hand) but I had everything for this one and it turned out great!  I haven't tried putting it in the blender, I just throw it all together and let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours, that seems to blend the flavors well.  I usually use a little less mayo, a little more sour cream.  In the future I may back off a bit on the garlic salt - I love garlic, but it might have been a tad much.  Perfect with buffalo chicken pizza!!

I tried making half of the recipe with twice the crumbles. I mixed it in the blender and it was quite watery.
I recommend mixing all but the crumbles  in the blender. Then add them. That way you get the "chunkyness" for the dressing.
I also wound up putting 12 oz. total bluecheese on just half of this recipe. I also added 1 tbl. of balsamic vinegar. It was then loved!

I would love to give this 5 stars but it needed some tweaking. Use equal amounts mayo & sour cream, as written, it's very mayonaisse-y. I agree to cut the garlic salt in half-I did & it was still very salty(maybe just use garlic powder & salt to taste). I also doubled the blue cheese & it could still use some more. What I love about this recipe is that it doesn't use buttermilk or vinegar so it's a creamy flavor, not tangy. Plus, it's really thick-exactly what I look for in blue cheese dressing. With my changes, this is thee dressing we'll always be using! Thank you!!

I loved this recipe because it was simple and tasted great.. maybe a little too much garlic salt. I made it according to this recipe the first time...the second time I tripled the BC crumble and used 2c. each mayo and sour cream. it had a more bite this way and my family loved it... well, all the women anyway!!

My husband loved this recipe...and blue cheese dressing is his favorite-he's tried many different kinds.  I would have liked a little less garlic salt, though.

The basic recipe is good, but I ended up adding more blue cheese, ground pepper, and a little horseradish for some extra flavor. I used this as a sauce for bison burgers...very tasty.

Sometimes simple is the best way to go. I did use an equal amount of sour cream and mayonnaise, and I increased the milk by 3 tablespoons so the dressing could be a little thinner. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of fresh ground black pepper. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good if you cut down on the mayo - period.   I used 3/4 fat free mayo and 1/4 full fat and tasted way to mayonaisey.  So added twice as much blue cheese and more garlic salt.  Glad I cut this recipe is 1/4 to begin with or would not have had enough blue cheese to kill the mayo taste.  I didn't have any sour cream so substituted reduced fat cream cheese/milk combination.  Just did a test taste and it will be perfect for chicken wings tonight.  Comes close to Marzetti's if you are a fan on that store bought product.

This was very good .. I scaled it down and added put in the same amount of sour cream and mayonnaise by accident and then added the correct milk amount and garlic salt  and added extra blue cheese because i love cheese. and it was more like a dip than a dressing. I used it for buffalo wings that I had made and it got rave reviews from my friend. He said it was very very good. Also I would recommend refrigerating it for a few hours so the flavors can blend. It was even better the next day.

This is a very good dressing. I've made it several times as is and it's great. Recently, I put in a splash of Worcestershire sauce for a little more depth of flavor. This is a keeper.

Perfect!  Doubled the cheese, used 1c mayo with a 6oz. cup of plain yogurt, and halved the garlic salt.

I'm so happy that I found this simple basic recipe to build on.  I halved it and used equal parts reg. mayo and lite sour cream.  Used the full 4z of Treasure Cove Lite Bleu Cheese and a splash or two of good balsamic vinegar as recommended by others.  Used just enough 1% milk to the consistency I was looking for.  Replaced garlic Salt with garlic Powder with a pinch of black pepper and hand blended.  Rich, creamy/chunky and delicious!

Yummy!  Added non-fat Greek yogurt, less sour cream less mayo.  Used horseradish, and "garlic garlic" from Tastefully Simple.  Little pepper, little milk.  All to taste for our buffalo wings.  Really yummy!
