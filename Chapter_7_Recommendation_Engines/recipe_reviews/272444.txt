The only change I made was that I added 1/4 of a block of cream cheese. It helped thicken it. This was very delicious.

Fantastic recipe and very easy. Stir and stir that cream after you add it. It will look like it's not going to thicken and then all of a sudden it does. I use a whisk but you could also use an immersion blender to get it really creamy. Voila!

The picture is horrible. The sauce is very good.
