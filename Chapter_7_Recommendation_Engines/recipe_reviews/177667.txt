this was a very good dish but i did substitute veggie broth for chicken broth, i used fresh garlic instead of just powder, putting it in while the beef was cooking. i also added a dash of salt while the beef was cooking too.

I liked that it was s uper easy and I had most of the ingredients on hand. I used a larger can of tomatoes, but my husband said it could be saucier, so maybe a little bit of tomato sauce would be good. I added extra garlic, oregano and 
Worcestershire, plus a splash of red wine. Also, I added Italian cheese at the end. Easy and yummy.

I thought it was very simple and I loved that it was quick and easy.  I used beef broth instead of vegetable, and used seasoned tomotoes (basil, garlic, oregano).  I may try using rotelle tomatoes w/chilies next time and adding a few seasonings.  I disagree with adding tomato sauce, that just makes it spaghetti, which is specifically why i picked this recipe.  I was getting tired of spaghetti wanted something different.  We liked it because it had no tomato sauce.

I feel like this is missing something. It's not very cohesive and the ingredients aren't really tied together. I doubled the garlic, added basil, pepper, chili powder and spicy Mrs Dash as well as cheddar and mozzarella cheese. It definitely needs tomato sauce or should be eaten as a soup. It's just so-so and I am not sure that it's worth making again

I made this for four picky little eaters. Their review? "Yummy!"  I didn't have worcestershire sauce, so I left it out. I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable, since that's what I had. I sprinkled cheddar cheese on each portion separately. I thought it quite scrumptious considering how quickly it came together! A nice, hearty pasta meal.

This isnt nothing more than hamburger helper, but  hey, I like hamburger helper and my family liked it too. It was quick, easy and good. It did need salt pepper and a dash of tabasco.

I really liked this! Ok, I switched it up quite a bit, but that's how good recipes start, with a good base and then you play around a little bit. I didn't have veggie broth so I used beef broth. I thought I had corkscrew noodles, but I didn't so I took fettuccine noodles and broke them up into bite sized pieces. I used about 1/2 of a 16oz box. I also used a 16oz can of diced tomatoes. Seasonings were garlic powder, some sweet basil, a little anise and salt and pepper. But the real twist was that I had some leftover heavy cream and grated parmesan just begging me to dump it in, so I did right at the end. Amazing! A beautiful creamy type sauce, NOT spaghetti saucy at all, with great flavor. Give this recipe a try and play around with it to suit your tastes. I think you'll find a winner for your family that's quick to get on the table. :-)

A perfect recipe for my quest to use up leftovers. My ground beef was cooked taco meat. I did add the Worchestershire sauce to those flavors and probably won't in the future, it gave the dish a chili-like flavor I wasn't looking for. I used a 14oz can of tomatoes, half a box of beef broth (approx. 14oz, I think...) and added extra fresh tomatoes, green pepper and a medium zucchini I had on hand. This was fast, flavorful and so much healthier/economical than eating out, thanks so much Campbell's!

Not bad... pretty basic. I would substitute one small can of tomato sauce for the vegetable broth, Italian style diced tomatoes for the stewed tomatoes and add half an onion in with the beef.

I made this recipe as written.  It was certainly easy to make, but did not have a lot of flavor.  I added some onion powder and more salt after the initial tasting.  It was better.  Next time, I will brown off some onion with the beef and add more tomatoes and maybe a bay leaf.  Very adaptable.  Thanks for a good starter recipe!

This was NOT good.  I fixed it for my 4 children and I.  I tasted it from the pan and found it virtually inedible.  I served it to my children, hoping they wouldn't notice.  They all politely picked at their foods, not eating much.

Super fast & easy without sacrificing taste.  The local grocer was out of stewed tomatoes in small sizes, so I substituted Rotel tomatoes - a bit more spicy than the original recipe.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Nothing super duper but something easy and tasty to throw together quickly.  I added some frozen veggies, some Mrs. Dash and ketchup on top.

The vegetable broth they ask you to use seems highly unnecessary I used 1/4 cup of broth and a whole can tomato sauce came out much better and wasn't so liquidy.

I thought this was quite tasty even tho very simplistic....just good comfort food.  I did not change the recipe and made as is.  If anything, I might add some onion next time.  I do not think everything has to be "kicked up".  It was extremely quick and easy for me because I cook up ground chuck ahead in 1 pound portions and put in food saver bags for the freezer.  Since the pasta cooks in the same pan, it's a cinch and I find that quite convenient on busy days.  I put a nice tossed salad with it and some crusty bread.  This is a definite keeper!

I really liked this. I saw something at a wedding and think this is just as good. I substituted the stewed tomato with a can of tomato sauce, and added salt to taste.

Great Recipe! Though I did change it a bit!  I used Johnsonville® Mild Italian Sausage instead of the hamburger.  I also used Bow tie pasta (because that it what I had on hand).  It really gave it an elegant look, especially garnished with some fresh Basil!  Great weeknight meal!

I would compare this to a less salty hamburger helper but better . I would make this again . I used a bigger can of tomatoes and added shake cheese after it was cooked.

I was hesitant because of the other reviews, but my family was SO excited that this turned out well.  My husband asked when the last time was that we found a new recipe this good!  I think the key is cooking it long enough to let the sauce get a bit thick and more flavorful.  I simmered uncovered for a few extra minutes at the end.  I may have added a bit more stock and an extra half cup of pasta to be sure I had enough.  Definitely a new regular in my house.  My 4 year old loved it too.

Very easy/quick and reasonably good.  I sauted 1/2 diced onion in the pan prior to cooking the hamburger.  After tasting the finished product, I added the onion back into the dish along with some onion salt.  I agree with those who say it needs a little more something - perhaps a 2nd can of diced tomatoes with more seasoning?  Sauted baby portabella mushrooms or perhalps switch out the hamburger for italian sausage?

Just like grandma used to make!! I love it and my 3 year cleaned her plate. I did use chicken broth because that was all I had. I also added the garlic and oregano when browning the meat.

I read the reviews on this before I made it and someone said it tasted like a glorified hamburger helper- ive had both and believe this is better than hamburger helper- my kids enjoyed it more too- its like a tomatoey stroganoff- i was tempted to add some spaghetti sauce in it to make it more like spaghetti but i didnt and it turned out fabulous!!! Great quick meal :))
