I really wanted to like this more than we did, it is so easy to assemble and has great promise.  First, 2 cups of blueberries is barely enough to barely cover the bottom of a 9 x 13 pan.  I opted to use a 9 x 6 pan and 3 cups of blueberries.  My mistake was not reducing the amount of batter (topping) - after baking 30 minutes at 400 the top looked beautiful but the topping was not done.  I tented it with foil, reduced the heat to 325 and baked another 15 minutes. The topping is very cake like and even with 3 cups of berries there still wasn't quite enough blueberries.  I would recommend using the 9 x 13" pan called for and increasing the blueberries to 4 - 5 cups.

Made exactly as written, absolutely delicious! Our new family favorite cobbler. Not overly sweet, and very easy to make, just how we like it! Thanks!

My husband and I agreed that this is our new go-to blueberry cobbler recipe. I halved the recipe, except for the blueberries, and baked it in a smaller dish. I also omitted the lemon juice, and substituted corn starch for the tapioca (cause I don't have any!). It was perfect. Perfect fruit to crust proportion, perfect crispness, perfect juiciness, perfect sweetness. Loved it!

I use this recipe a lot with blackberries.  For whatever berry I use a 6x10 baking dish, pour in enough berries to completely cover the bottom, and bake at 350 for 45 minutes.

I reduced the sugar because I don't like really sweet  food.  I prefer to taste the fruit and not have it overwhelmed with sugar.  This recipe is really easy and delicious!!

Turned out great. I left out the egg, lemon and tapioca because i didnt have them and its still yummy! . I also added sugar to the juice of the frozen blueberries and cooked in a saucepan a little then i thickened it with water and cornstarch for the perfect pie filling consistency.
