I've never made Filipino food before and this was also my 1st time making milk fish. I found the number of bones to be ridiculous. I purchased a whole one (frozen) and was alarmed to find it had not been scaled or gutted.  Be prepared to have scales everywhere!  I substituted the juice of a large lemon instead of calamansi but otherwise followed the recipe to a T.  The recipe has interesting asian notes and have never had tomato or onion stuffed fish but found it refreshingly different.  I would make again but with a different fish, maybe tilapia or similar.  Hint: Be sure to use tin foil wider than the standard 12" width to get a good seal.
