They key to this recipe is the "shredded apple". Shredded apple adds a LOT of liquid. Also the shredding yields more liquid than chopping. If you are going to substitute other fruits for the apple i recommend something that is equilly as moist as an apple; such as zucchini, fresh peaches, carrots or any other moist fruit (shredded). Dried fruits will not work without added liquid.

I had the same problem as the first review. It came out very dry and heavy. I made mine with apples and cranberries. Should there be something added to give it more moistness?

Simple recipe that takes barely any time or effort. I used bananas and it turned out great.

What did I do wrong? The bread came out very dense and hard.  Is three cups the right amount of flour??
The taste was good, though.  That's why I gave a good rating.

This recipe was ok, but I was not overly impressed. There's WAY too much flour; I had to add about 1/2 cup of milk to the batter to mix in all the flour. I don't think I'll try this one again.

I added bananas as well.  I should have mixed them in better but otherwise it was very good.

I think this is a great "base" bread for fresh fruits and vegetables, and for an intermediate cook who has a "feel" for what batter should look like prior to being baked, as the type of fruit or veggie you use will determine the thickness of the batter, making the addition of wet or dry ingredients necessary. 

We've had a fantastic crop of plums and apricots on our farm this year.  I typically puree whatever I don't make into jams and save it for ice cream, sauces, etc.  I decided to use some of the plum puree in this recipe and omitted the shredded apple, using 1 1/2 cups plum puree instead.   It turned out beautifully and I can't wait to make it again, only next time I'm going to try using some of the apricot puree.  I'm even considering using strawberry and raspberry puree next spring.

Thank you so much for this basic and wonderful recipe!  It will be a staple in my recipe box, for sure.

This is my go-to base recipe for most quick breads, but I don't get the cooking time at all--I need to bake it for at least 50 minutes.

Three cups of flour seemed like too much unless you're adding liquid.  I used shredded apple but it was still dry.  The taste is good with added cinnamon and nutmeg.  I'll try it again but add some milk or orange juice.
