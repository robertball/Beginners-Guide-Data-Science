Awesome cookies!  I used Eggwhites and had trouble with getting a the mixture to stiffen, and so my consistency reminded me a bit of peanut brittle.  BUT, the cookies were still awesome tasting and this recipe will be introduced to my cookie colelction.

I haven't cooked a lot with egg whites and my first attempt at these cookies was a complete flop.  The second time around I beat the egg whites well past "foamy" stage and continued beating until they peaked.  That seemed to work much better.  One I began adding other ingrediants, the peaks seemed to break down.  I recommend beating the egg whites all the way to peak or stiff peak and then mixing as little as possible once you begin adding the brown sugar, etc.  Overall a super easy recipe... once you get the eggs right.

Oh my, these were wonderful! I didn't have any pecans so they came out basically as meringue made with brown sugar. To make them a bit "fancier" I piped them on the parchment paper (I used zip log bag). 
The weather was humid and I was worried they'd lose their crunch but they were so delicious even when a bit sticky, reminding me of taffy. Everyone loved them. Thank you for the great recipe!

This cookie got better after it sat out a couple hours after baking. It tasted a bit salty so I will probably put less next time, also I added bit of cream of tartar to the egg whites and it turned out pretty good.

These have become a favorite at Christmas; particularly for my dad who can only eat glutin-free foods.

These are fabulous! I made some with chocolate chips instead of pecans, and they were delicious! Make sure you don't over bake them though and take them off the pan as soon as they come out, or they will stick. I love to try new things and these are a GREAT thing to make if you want to try something a little differerent

These turned out great! So easy to make with just a few ingredients. Yes they take a long time to bake but if you have the time, why not? Very very light. I will be making them again with the only change being I will be sure to spray the pan liner since a few did stick when removing them.  I also got more cookies than it said, 24 good sized cookies rather than the 18. Usually I end up with less!

I used Ideal zero-calorie brown sugar as a substitute with amazing results.

These are easy to make.  I wouldn't make them again only because they take an HOUR to bake.  Most cookies take 8-10 minutes.  I brought them to church for coffee service though and they all got consumed.  One of my kids loved them and another hated them.  Go figure.  I thought they were good.

The taste of the cookies was good but not worth the stress of making them. I'm not sure where I went wrong but the dough was very fluid and did not make cookies. Letting the batter sit in the fridge did not help at all.

awesome!!!!!!!  Let your eggwhites come to room temp before beating.  Add brown sugar slowly alternating with vanilla once the eggwhites are foamy and beat to stiff peaks.  Do not over stir when folding in pecans.  I did no tweaking but I will make it again.  This is a desert I can whip up in literally 5 minutes and get the rest of the dinner going while they bake.

I made these for a gluten intolerant friend and he and everyone else couldn't have enough. They were devoured.. I have to make twice the amount next time.

These were a HUGE hit.  I made a double batch; 1 batch with pecans and a second batch with chocolate chips... The pecans definitely make for a better cookie.  I have gotten many requests to make them again.
