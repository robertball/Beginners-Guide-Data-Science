Very good muffins!  I did alter the recipe some based on the ingredients I had available - skim milk instead of buttermilk, whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, and butter instead of shortening - the results were very tasty and had a nice texture as well.  Am sure the recipe as originally written would easily rank a 4 or 5.  Will definately make again.

After reading through the reviews, I did the following:  doubled the recipe, added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract, used skim milk instead of buttermilk, butter instead of shortening, and doubled the amount of cherries (for a double recipe, this means I used one full cup).  I love these muffins!  I would give it 5 stars, except I made so many changes to the original recipe.  Thank you for this great base recipe!

I found a buttermilk substitute which I will use for this recipe. Others may want to try it when they don't have it on hand. 1. Place a Tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice in a liquid measuring cup.
2. Add enough milk to bring the liquid up to the one-cup line.
3. Let stand for five minute. Then, use as much as your recipe calls for.

These are DELICIOUS!!!  The simplicity of the batter allows the cherries to shine!  I did double the recipe, because I wanted 12 regular-sized muffins, and added extra cherries ... instead of sugar, I used Splenda ... and, instead of shortening, I used Fleschmann's Olive Oil Spread (I've found it's wonderful to cook with) ... baked for 25 minutes, and they were perfect!  Love them!

These were really good - I doubled the recipe, added 1 tsp each of vanilla and cherry extract, and added extra cherries. I will definitely make them again!

OK - as written these would be bland.  I doubled the recipe, added 1 tsp each almond and cherry extracts, 
and gave it a chance.  Very good muffins and I enjoyed the different flavor.  Froze well.  The extracts really gave these the boost they needed.

I quadrupled the recipe, added at least a teaspoonful of almond and vanilla extract, and used butter instead of shortening. They turned out great, but I probably would add more dried berries next time (I used a combination of cherries, cranberries and blueberries). Very good!

Excellent recipe!  I plan on using the batter with other dried fruit or with a little pumpkin or other spices mixed in the future because it worked so well.  The cherries were delicious, plumped nicely while baking.  Now the changes, I probably doubled the cherries.  And I topped each one with a oatmeal streusel made of the following, a couple of handfuls of oatmeal, handful of flour, handful of brown sugar and a couple tablespoons of butter mixed together until cumbly and then put on top of each muffin.  I also made it in muffin top tin as my husband only likes the tops and I baked it 18 minutes since they were thinner that way.  Still made 6 muffins, just flatter and crunchier the way he likes them.

What a nice muffin.  I made these for my family and they went nuts over them.  I did alter the recipe a little though. I doubled the recipe and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla, (I think next time I will add 2) and instead of buttermilk, (because who has buttermilk on hand all the time) I used sour cream.  I baked them in my large muffin pans and the double recipe yielded 6 large, beautiful muffins.  Also I had to bake them for about 5 minutes longer.

The muffins were very great. I did  use butter like someone else suggested. Just a little hint only fill the batter 1/2 instead of 3/4 because they rise so well. I did baste mine with butter right before i served and was so great. Double the recipe if you want a dozen though.

Nice little muffins. I love dried cherries and like recipes I can make with things I already have in the house. I used whole wheat flour and cut back the shortening a little, added some almond extract, and since I didn't have buttermilk I used plain yogurt. They turned out well. Some applesauce might be a good addition next time, to make up for using less shortening.

This is a really good basic muffin recipe.  I've changed it up by using strawberries, mixed dried fruit, nuts, choc. chips, etc.  what ever you want.  Adding just a little bit of vanilla makes a big difference too.

These are okay, but they're not fabulous. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and some extra cherries. I also doubled the recipe. They looked quite nice when they came out of the oven, but are a bit heavier than I was hoping for. My five-year-old enjoyed them though, and he was the one who requested cherry muffins, so I can't really complain too much. However, I would be unlikely to make these again, as they just weren't good enough for me to want to repeat them. I suspect I'll be looking for another cherry muffin recipe that more people will enjoy.

I prepared a double recipe (12); used butter instead of shortening; used a total of 1 cup of dried cherries; added 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp almond extract; filled the regular size muffin tin cups half full, which was perfect for 12 muffins.  I made a batch of streusel topping w/pecans in my food processor and covered 6 of the muffins; then baked.  After muffins were done, I brushed butter on top of the 6 that did not have the streusel topping.  All 12 were absolutely delicious!  I will make the recipe again, that's for sure!

They were very bland, in spite of adding vanilla extract and extra cherries. I ended up with only 2 big muffins out of the specified recipe.

um...they kinda reminded me of cornbread. I doubled the recipe and added some almond extract.  Otherwise I followed it exsactly.  I probably won't again, it was pretty blah.  My oven runs hot so I lowered the temp and only baked for 15 min and they were dry.

I doubled the recipe, used half whole wheat and only got 10 muffins out of it.  A trifle on the dull side....maybe some nuts next time.
