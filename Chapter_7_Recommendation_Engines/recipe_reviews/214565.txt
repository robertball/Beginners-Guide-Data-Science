These were great *IF* you like horseradish...a definite prerequisite!  I also added various spices to the chops before I piled the crumb topping on--salt, pepper, cayenne, oregano, garlic powder and basil.  Just eyeballed the spices and added per my own taste.  I also baked them atop slices of onions which baked up crisp tender with a wonderful flavor from the juices/spices.  Finally, I started to put the chops under the broiler for a few minutes after they were done to crisp up the crumb mixture since it seemed a little 'wet' and I was SO glad I tasted it first!  Where this dish is lacking in presentation, it definitely makes up for in flavor.  This is an easy, quick and delicious weeknight meal with the perfect amount of horseradish and tender, succulent meat to boot.

This came out with a distinct flavor and tasted wonderful. The only problem I saw was that I pulled the pork chops out 5 minutes early and they were dry and overdone, but that is easily fixed. Overall, a solid recipe with some tweaking of the cooking time/heat.

I was looking for something new to do with pork chops when I came across this recipe.I read thru the majority of the reviews and combined suggestions from a few of them:placed the chops on onion slices,seasoned with s&p and garlic powder,made the topping exactly as listed,baked for 30 min( my chops were thin cut) then broiled for 5 min....result..my husband said they were the best pork chops I ever made...and I've been cooking for him for 26 years.

I was skeptical about this but wanted to make something easy so i tried this.  Only change was using bone in chops.  This was delicious.  Thanks submitter.  Served with Betty Crocker au gratin potatoes, apple sauce and corn.  The potatoes can cook in the oven along with the chops.

This made delicious, moist pork chops!  The topping was creamy and the horseradish flavor was mild, not harsh.  Based on other reviews, I did layer some sliced onions on the bottom of the pan, season the pork with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, and decreased the cooking time to 35 minutes at 350 and 5 minutes under the broiler.

This is so easy and so good! We usually add extra horseradish but that is just because we like spicy. I normally only need to cook a total of 30 minutes in the oven but that of course just depends on the size of your pork chops (thickness).

Overall five stars for ease of recipe and tastiness!  It was almost too easy to prepare and stick in the oven.  The horseradish adds the perfect zing.  Definitely a new go to for a quick dinner!

WOW...couldn't ask for an easier meal to make!  And so delicious!!!  The pork chops were so tender and moist..I could go on and on.....try it you'll like it!  Well, you do have to like a horseradish taste!  btw, it makes it's own gravy while cooking....delish on brown rice.

Made this last night and I thought it was great, I took another reviewers advice and placed chops on top of onion slices, I also didn't have bread crumbs so I used finely crushed Ritz crackers, and broiled the last 5 minutes turned out perfect!

It was good and I don't even like horseradish that much. I added some seasoning to the pork chops; salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. I also used fresh grated horseradish instead if the creamy. I wish I had taken the advice of others and broiled it the last few minutes to get a crispy topping. Other than that, I really liked it and will definitely make it again.

My husband & I enjoyed this recipe. I do admit to marinating the pork first to ensure it was tender. Very easy & delicious.

These were pretty good.  I did place them under the broiler as other reviewers suggested to develop a crust.  I also used Panko crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs.  We love horseradish, but this loses the bite after baking.  The next time I think I will add some paprika and more horseradish to attempt to increase the "bite".

Very good recipe as is, but it is also excellent with a mixture of ground horseradish and apple sauce. The bite of the horseradish and the sweetness of the apple sauce is a great combo with pork.

Really unique taste, but didn't turn out right.. Ended up having more of a bread crumb stuffing looking toping. With some changes, and a lot of adjustments (brining!) this recipe could be amazing. Gonna do it again, but going to be changing it. a LOT. Was edible and good enough, but not enough to rave over.

This was SO simple yet quite good.  All I added were salt & pepper to the pork chops before coating them with the horseradish/breadcrumb mixture.  OK, so I probably added more horesradish than the recipe called for - - only because we LOVE it.  Thanks, Kim, for a delicious and easy recipe.  It's great for those busy weeknights.

This was really good.  I have to say, I did not read the instructions all the way through and realized after they were in the oven what my errors were.  But because they were so delicious, I decided to share my mistakes.  First, I used Panko bread crumbs which soak up the butter and horseradish quickly.  I also coated both sides of my chops, so had to double the recipe.  Because I used Panko crumbs, I knew to salt and pepper the coating before spreading it on.  The coating was superb.  Since I had coated both sides, I chose to turn the chops over halfway through.  The chops were juicy and tender as well as very flavorful.  But I like to taste the meat, not the seasoning, so if you are looking for a recipe which will change the flavor of the meat, this is not the recipe for you (ie, if you put steak sauce or ketchup on your meat).   Both of us agreed this recipe is a keeper and the simplicity alone makes it a 5-star recipe.  Oh, I did like the onion idea from another reviewer so will try that next time.  
Thanks.

I cooked mine over a few slices of onion and used 1/2 c of panko and 1/4 c od bread crumbs. It was awesome. It smelled delicious and tasted pretty good. Cooking time is dependent on the thickness of your pork chop.

Something different, delicious, and easy to make!  I seasoned my pork chops with seasoned salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder before adding the topping.  I also only baked them for 20 minutes and stuck them under the broiler for about 5 min to try to get the topping to crisp a little.

wow! VERY GOOD recipe! Just got done eating the chops! I will be making these more often! The only thing I changed was bone-in and cooked it a little longer more like an hour. I like color to food and this was it brought the chops nice rich brown and tender! GREAT!

I made this recipe for my husband b/c he really likes spicy dishes and I'm not fond of spicy.  I do like horseradish!  I tried this and we all enjoyed it!  I like how the horseradish tastes after being cooked.  Will def be making this again!  Thanks.

Great and easy recipe! I do usually add a little extra horseradish, as you tend to lose a little of the horseradish flavor once it cooks. But otherwise a great recipe.

This is a great, flavorful, quick week night preparation.  I've also done this with boneless, skinless chicken breast and it turns out great every time.

I made them for my boyfriend he liked the way it was cooked but didn't really like the horseradish (and he loves horseradish) so I'll use this as a point of reference for cooking it but I won't use the horseradish again which I think probably defeats the purpose of the whole recipe.

I greased a broiling pan and used that instead of the baking dish. I also baked at 350 for 35 mins then broiled as suggested. The top crisped up nicely but the bottom was soggy. I want to try these again because of ease of preparation. Think next time I will only spread half  the topping on top side, bake, flip and spread the other side with remaining topping and continue baking. Then broil each side a few mins. I bet crushed up stuffing mix would add even more flavor. Served with baked mac and cheese and green beans with corn and dill butter. Great use of some homemade breadcrumbs from the freezer.

I thought this was simple to make and tasty. I had everything on hand and followed the directions as indicated. I used thin boneless pork chops and next time I will bake them for 30 minutes. They were a little dry from over cooking, but otherwise, delicious. The amount of horseradish might sound strong, but the bread crumbs and butter seemed to dilute it to a mild level.

Incredibly easy to make and delicious! However, there is absolutely no reason to bake these for 45 minutes. I baked them at 450 degrees for 30 minutes and they were tender and juicy.

This was amazing!  I thought it would be too strong with that much horseradish, but it was perfect.  I used Panko bread crumbs, because that is what I had.

Made this with pork chops with the bone still in. Quite good even though the horseradish "bite" bakes out. I would make it again. We served it with cole slaw and it was a nice match.

The pork tasted great, but it took forever to cook.  Apparently the pork you get from Costco are cut super thick so it took over 1 1/2 hours to cook.  If the chop is over an inch filet them or it will take too long to cook.  Otherwise a great tasting dish.

4 stars only because I think the butter is too much - I'd use half or less.  I did use jarred grated horseradish, not creamy, and it was indeed delicious...and so easy.  Thanks!

Although the recipe is for four servings,  I cooked two pork chops. I prepared, however, the horseradish coating as if for four. In other words, I had plenty of the coating, a good thing, because it is tasty. I also substituted ground horseradish for half of the creamy horseradish sauce. It turned out well: the pork chops were moist and flavorful. The horseradish coating nicely complimented the pork. In all, this recipe makes a nice addition to the permanent collection.

I included a little broth so the chops would not dry out. Flavor was light I think I would add some spices on the chop before the topping next time. The broth made the chops very tender.

I recently made this pork chop recipe in the toaster oven. For the two of us, I used two thick cut boneless chops that had been previously brined, and used the full crumb mixture from the recipe. I used Panko crumbs. Be careful not to over cook. I cooked ours 20 min. at 375 degrees.

If you like horseradish like we do, this is a quick and easy must try recipe. Enjoy.

We loved these chops.  I didn't have any bread crumbs, so I crushed Town House crackers.  Also, maybe my stupidity, but I expected it to be a breaded pork chop.  I put the very wet breading on both sides of the chops.  The bottom was still very wet...not crisp.  But the pork was well done.  Great taste though.

This was just OK. If I make it again, I'll cut back on butter, the topping never really got crisp, it stayed mushy.

4 ingredients and quick prep...what's not to like?  Purchased some boneless pork chops on sale and was looking for an easy recipe that wouldn't leave the chops dry.  This recipe fit the bill.  House smelled great while they were cooking and the taste was even better.  Husband and kids loved it too.  Chops were nice and moist (used thick 1 1/2 inch chops).  Served with some green beans and mashed potatoes.  Will definitely be making again.

When I tasted the coating before putting it on the pork chops, it was extremely horseradishy and I worried that it would be too spicy for my family.  Because of that, I put it on only one side.  My family reported that it mellowed considerably during baking.  End result?  They loved it and want me to make it again.  That will be very easy to do, since it only has 4 ingredients, including the pork chops.

I grew up with horseradish, my family grew it, processed it and sold it. My husband and I enjoyed them. They where moist juicy and tender.  I followed recipe, and will be making them again.

This recipe has become our favorite way to fix and eat pork chops.  I usually only cook two chops but I use the full recipe for the topping because it is so good.  The first time I made them, I cooked them for almost the whole time given in the recipe.  They were overlooked, so I have shortened the baking time and they come out perfect each time.  I have passed this recipe on to several people as it is too good not to share.  Love, love, love them!!

Delicious, I did as other reviewers and placed sliced onions as a base and seasoned the chops. Broiled for a few at the end and they were great. I would definitely make again!

Fantastic!  Most recipes I find here tend to be too bland for Me, not so this one.  Served with steamed cabbage and applesauce, it was a hit!

This was incredible!! We had chops and my husband wanted to grill them and I was looking for something new so I cooked half with the changes below and he grilled his half. Once he tasted mine he said we had to use this recipe again, they were the most moist and flavorful chops he had ever eaten. We had them again 4 days later, lol.  I substituted evoo in place of butter and used Italian bread crumbs in the topping mix. Placed sliced onions in bottom of baking dish with a little evoo and this kept the chops moist and the onions made a nice side as well. Thanks for the recipe! Oh by the way... this is my first review, that's how good they are.

I gave this 5 stars because it was super easy and the taste was delish! However, we like a bit more seasoning,  so I did season the pork chops with garlic powder, salt and pepper then spooned the mixture on top. My chops were about 1/2" thick so baked for 30 min then broiled top for 5 min. Thank you Kim for sharing this recipe!! Will definitely make them again soon!

Simple fast and delicious.  I made mine ahead of time and reheated the chops with scoops of the sauce on top for 1 minute after work.  A delicious weeknight dinner.

I absolutely LOVED these!!! I love horseradish, & adding them to the bread crumbs and butter made an amazingly good topping on the chops. And the chops were very tender!  A very simple & quick recipe.

Not something I would make again.  We ended up scraping the horseradish stuff off of the pork chops because it was like stuffing texture with horseradish taste - not very appetizing.

Wow! This recipe is a keeper. It was so good and easy too. I put the chops on a bed of onion and also put it under the broiler for a few minutes to crispy up the topping a bit, as one reviewer mentioned. Thanks so much for the recipe.

My husband loves horseradish and I can take it in small doses, but this recipe, when used with creamy hr, has a great flavor.  He had three for dinner.  Only change is I did add  a little paprika and garlic salt to mixture.  Will make again very soon.

Great recipe! Used thick, stuffed pork chops and pinko bread crumbs. Followed others and seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder and oregano. Baked for 1 1/2 hours. No need to put under the broiler as the crumbs were brown enough and had formed a nice crust. Smelled heavenly while cooking!

I thought this recipe was okay.  I followed the advice of the other reviewers and put onion under the pork chop.  Im sorry to say my family wasn't impressed.

The second time around I seasoned the pork with a little salt and pepper before adding the mixture, then I stopped baking five minutes early and broiled for three minutes to toast the breadcrumbs.  This is a real winner based on simplicity, flavor, and flexibility.

I was very surprised with the combination of horseradish and pork.  My very picky 6 year old even ate this up!  I used almond flour instead of bread crumbs since we are gluten free and cut up some red potatoes an threw them in the pan with the pork.  Served it with sauteed kale and baked onins, too.

One of the easiest dinners ever.  This is great!  The horseradish is not overwhelming.  I broil for a few minutes at the end to brown the breading a bit.

Even with the extra hot horseradish, this dish lacked the kick I expected.  Some tinkering may be required
