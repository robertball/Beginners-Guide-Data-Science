I have been looking for this recipe.  This glaze is my mom's signature recipe.  My hubby doesn't like to eat ham until he had this and now, he eats it.

This was the first time I made baked ham. My husband is brutally honest. He absolutely loved it! I used a sugar-free lite orange juice. Other than that, I followed this recipe.

Loved this glaze!  Instead of pouring water into the bottom of my roasting pan I added orange juice and it was amazing!

I scaled this down to 5 servings then used it to cook a ham steak in. My husband and I both loved it. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Hubby declared this the "best ham glaze ever, 10 times better than that nasty glaze that comes with the ham" we usually buy (Sam's boneless spiral). I heated mine in the microwave for a minute or so to help blend the honey with the cold OJ, and to dissolve the lumps in the brown sugar. Thanks for sharing!

This was truly the best ham I've ever had. I cooked the ham per packaged directions, made the glaze according to the recipe and added just one extra step immediately before applying the glaze: I scored the ham and studded it with whole cloves, then poured the glaze over. It was heavenly. My mouth still waters just thinking about it. This is going to become a holiday ham keeper for sure.

I loved it.  Easy to do, and it cut the salty taste of the ham nicely.

Yum!! I made the ham for a brunch & wanted to do as much prep as possible the night before so I made it the night before then used it with no problem the next day. I will absolutely be using this again. Everyone kept saying how good the ham was.

This ham I found quick to prepare. We usually only have ham with sweet sauce at Christmas or Thanksgiving. This one is nice when you don't have much time for preparation. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I took this to a potluck about two months ago and people are still talking about it.  Absolutely wonderful!  This is the only glaze I will use for ham from now on.

Very tasty, can't go wrong with this one!  Since I was doing a 5lb top sirloin roast, I only used a small 2lb boneless half ham (pre-cooked one).  I cut this glaze in half and used a bit of OJ in the  bottom of my pan while it cooked.  Basted frequently and it had a really nice sweet orange flavour - yummy!
