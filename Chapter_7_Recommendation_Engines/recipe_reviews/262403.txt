I didn't add the pulled pork because I didn't want to go to the trouble (and couldn't find it ready-made), but otherwise, I made this as directed.  It was my first Instant Pot recipe, and worked well for that, since it was so simple.  We found that it didn't have enough flavor for us, but after I added in more seasonings (mostly a Cajun blend), it was good!  It didn't taste quite like the Brunswick stew that I know, but it was still pretty tasty.  I'll play around with the seasonings more next time, but this recipe has great potential!

I followed the directions, but I added one more potato.  It was delicious and will definitely make it again, using my new Instant Pot.

This was the very first dish I made with my Instant Pot.  My husband and I were absolutely amazed at how delicious it was.  This recipe buried every Brunswick Stew dishes we ever had. Highly recommend.

I followed the recipe exactly; I made it on the stove, though. I let it simmer for about 2 hours so that it was thicker than the picture. We like our stews thick. This is a great recipe; it's like the Brunswick stew in Eastern NC. I've saved it and will make again.

The only changes I made was to use the low sodium canned tomatoes and chicken broth. Also, I don't have an instant pot so I simmered this on the stove for a couple of hours to let the flavors meld. I have tried other Brunswick stew recipes but none have ever hit the mark before this one. It tastes just like the Brunswick stew I grew up with in Georgia, my whole family loved it! We actually gorged ourselves on this tonight it was so, so good. I will be making this regularly, thank you for the recipe!

This had an odd sweet/tangy taste that didn't sit well with  my family.

This was my first effort with my new Instant Pot... recipe was easy and delicious!  This makes a lot of food...so some is frozen for future dinners.  Taste is amazing...
