I was not crazy about this recipe at all. I am 100% Italian and I have never eaten Ragu with this kind of recipe. If you really want to make it I suggest finding a more authentic Ragu recipe

This recipe as is gave me some issues as is. However, with a few adjustments we still ended up with a pretty good meal. I immediately added some chopped bacon to the meat because I wanted it to be a little more authentic and we don't care for canned peas so I also decided to omit them right off the bat. When I got the meat cooked and everything combined in the pan to simmer  it was much too dry. I ended up adding a can of tomato paste, an extra can of diced tomatoes, and a can of tomato sauce. With these changes it turned out great. Will make again.
