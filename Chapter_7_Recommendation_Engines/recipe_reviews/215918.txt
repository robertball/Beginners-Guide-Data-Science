Cheesy Spinach Pasta Casserole Haiku: "Great with some changes. Classico sauce is awesome, Still needed more stuff." I had only a couple modifications on this recipe, due to what I had on hand (for instance, penne instead of shells, and all mozzarella b/c I didn't have cheddar), but I was still faithful to the recipe and directions. I used the Classico sauce, but I added to it some italian sausage that I'd browned w/ some diced onions and bell pepper. It was a nice make-ahead meal, and I'll happily eat anything loaded w/ spinach, but definitely don't bake it uncovered for 45 min. or the cheese on top will get stringy. I uncovered mine for the last 10 min. and it was a very tasty meal, albeit, still a little plain, so next go-around, I'd add a bit more herbs and seasoning,

Great recipe thanks.  I made it the first time exactly how it was written and I agree with the previous reviewer in regards to covering it until the last 5 min.  I make it now with left over homemade sauce & meatballs.  I slice the meatballs thin and layer them.  I also add romano & parm to each cheese layer.  I place the dish on a baking sheet incase it bubbles over since mine is always stuffed to the top.

Really great! Even my picky Husband loved it. I added a large can of White Meat Chicken into the toss of pasta and spinach. This will become a regular at our table!

Only change I had to make was I was out of mozzarella and had to use parmesan. Kids and hubby and I all loved it! Will make again
