I used sliced smoked salmon, and fresh dill, which made the salad taste a lot fresher than if I had used dried dill.  This salad is delicious, and tastes like it's from a gourmet deli.  The smoked salmon is already salty so make sure to taste the salad prior to adding more salt!  Thanks.

This was delicious!  I've made it twice, and both times people raved about it and asked for the recipe.  The first time I used canned salmon, and the second time I used fresh salmon that I first baked.  I've used this to make afternoon tea sandwiches, and they were a hit.  My husband really enjoyed it, too - thanks for the recipe Donna!

I made this as an appetizer for Easter and stuffed it into those ready-made phyllo cups.  We loved it.  I added 1/2 the onion the recipe called for,and a good amount of salt.  A great recipe!

I didn't use as many eggs as the recipe called for and instead used equal amounts of salmon and eggs. It was delicious on toasted whole wheat bread with melted mozzarella cheese on top, as well as on butter crackers. Will definitely make again

This was wonderful.  I was invited for lunch with some friends and took this as an appetizer, and everyone raved over it.  I used one small onion and a little more salmon than the recipe called for, and left out the celery, and it seemed just right.  Thanks for sharing this one!

This recipe is so unique and delicious.  I added a little fresh basil and cut out the red onion and it was fab-u-lous.

My husband loves smoked salmon and since it's often served with diced egg I thought this was a great idea!  I added capers and a little prepared mustard (which I always use in egg salad) but it still seemed a little bland.  Maybe some lemon juice would work to add a little zing.  Bottom line...we ate it on toasted baguette rounds and it was very good but I think it could be better.

I cheated and used canned salmon, about a half cup of chopped green onion instead of red and I added another stalk of celery. I added the mayonnaise 1/4 cup at a time until it was the right consistancy and I did not use the full three tablespoons of dill. That seemed excessive to me. A teaspoon was enough. After tasting it, I also added onion/garlic powder, some fresh ground pepper, a little dijon mustard and some Frank's Hot Sauce. Even with the canned salmon, this was darn tasty. Great thing about sandwich fillings like this is you can adjust it to fit your own personal tastes.

My husband absolutely raved!  I'm not into crunchy stuff in my egg salad, so I omitted the celery and only used 1/4 of a red onion.  Next time, I'll reduce the onion even more or eeven omit, because the main ingredients are quite tasty on their own. Will probably add sweet salad cubes next time, too.

'As is', I rate this four stars.  However, I believe it can be bumped to 5 with the following modifications...  For half the listed serving size (4), combine 5-6 eggs, 2 stalks celery (finely chopped), 1/4 a red onion, a full package of smoked salmon (this makes approx equal egg and salmon) finely chopped, 1/2 cup fat free mayo, 2 tbs spicy, dijon mustard, and a pinch of dill.  I then cooked up about half a box of medium shell pasta and combined with the egg/salmon mix before putting in the fridge overnight.  This variation makes it more of an 'eat alone' dish, and if you prefer toast or wraps, omit the pasta.

Excellent! Rich, creamy and smoky. We gobbled it all up on lightly toasted potato bread, but i agree this stuff could be very versatile.

I just saw a cooking featuring this sandwich. They used capers and no celery or onion. I like the finly chopped celery and onion mixed in. They served this on thin white square bread with crusts cut off. Then they spread mayo on one edge and dipped in chopped chives to add onion flavor. Very elegant for a brunch item or pile it in a pita, lettuce cups or bread of choice. I used the 4oz package of smoked salmon. Use reg mayo if your not watching calories.

This is the best egg salad I have ever had.  I eat them frequently and wanted something a little different and I got it with this.  I also added about two tablespoons of brown mustard, that's my personal touch to all egg salads.  I also went a little lighter, about 2/3 cups of mayo because I prefer it less goopy.  But very very good and will definitely make again!

I made this with canned salmon and with  smoked salmon and let me tell you there is a big difference in the results if you use anything but smoked salmon---smoked is the way to go! I used 2T dried dill. Loved it on Chicago flat bread!

Very yummy results! The bulk of the work is in the chopping and dicing and slicing. Add a few dashes of red pepper flakes for a zing!

Just so so.  I used hickory smoked tuna in the place of smoked salmon and red onion for color.  I'm not the biggest fan of egg salad so that may be reason for my lukewarm rating.  However I do think the idea by another reviewer to put in pastry cups for a party or shower is a good use for this recipe and a nice change from the ordinary.

I really don't like smoked salmon, the smell, the texture, or the taste. Yet this recipe made it delicious and so elegant in presentation. Sure the texture was still salmon but the melange of all the flavors was what made it good. Used less eggs and half an onion, it was delish. Four stars because I think I might be allergic to dill, found out the hard way. =)

I thought it was pretty good but my husband didn't care for it.  he's not crazy about dill, & he said he couldn't particularly taste the smoked salmon.  I'd suggest not dicing the salmon into too small pieces. It might be a little better if you made it deviled, with a little dry mustard or horseradish.

I'm sorry, we did not care for this.  The smoked salmon completely overwhelmed the egg salad.  We love smoked salmon and we love egg salad but the combination was not good.

I was disappointed in this recipe after the great reviews it got.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but I would have rather had plain egg salad or a regular tuna sandwich.  It tasted like an unsatisfying blend of the two.  My husband liked it but he's very kind and will eat almost anything.

Made as directed. there is too much onion in this. it overpowers the taste of everything else. you can't even tell there is salmon in it, due to the onion. i would only use 1/2 onion at the most. otherwise i think everything else balanced out nicely.

Made this yesterday and it was excellent!   Only change was that instead of all mayonnaise, I used half "Nayonnaise" (for less saturated fat).  Nice taste and will make again.

i can only give 3 stars because in the end, i'd rather do the toasted bagel-cream cheese-capers-tomato-lox thing, and not go to all the trouble. this is still easy enough, and a neat way to use smoked salmon. i omitted the onion (can't eat 'em), used maybe a generous 1/2 cup of mayo, 7 eggs, 6 oz smoked salmon, added a tsp of lemon juice and a tbsp or two of capers. i thought this was too much dill, especially since fresh dill is so strong. don't add salt (because the salmon will add enough salt to the flavor.) if you're going to top bread with it - add a slice of tomato. trust me ;)

Made using canned smoked salmon and sans dill (a spice not readily available in Jeolla Province, S. Korea).  Nice break from usual egg salad, and easy to add local flair through other seasonings.  recommended.

I liked this one but ended up doing a bit of variation due to lack of ingredients and being too lazy to go to the grocery store :) I used 3 green onions instead of the red onion, sesame seed, and a little soy sauce. It is delicious. I think this recipe is a great starting point for a lot of great flavor combinations.

OK, I had two dozen eggs not an idea what to do with them.  WOW what a great idea.  I ommitted the onion, DH does not do onions, used canned salmon, 6 oz , used 11 eggs, and dried dill about 3 tbsp.....delicious, can't wait to do it again, won't last long in my fridge:)  OH - and the easiest way I found to do the eggs cutting : A fork, smash smash smash- fast easy, in the same bowl

I used equal amounts of salmon and eggs, substituted some of the mayo with yogurt, and added dijon mustard.  Delish!

Sooooo good on sandwhiches. I added a tbsp of yellow mustard, halved the amount of dill, and added a tsp of lemon juice.  I also used equivalent amounts of smoked salmon and egg.

This recipe is perfect for a unique egg sandwich, as a lunch or a quick dinner.  I used a ciabatta bread with olives, and it was so tasteful!!!

LOVED THIS.  And so did everyone else at the tea party I made this for.  I'm not the biggest fan of smoked salmon, but it really kicked this recipe up a notch-- as did the fresh dill.  Delicious!

This review is based on Hubs' assessment, since salmon is one of the few things I don't care for.  When we go out for a nice breakfast he seems to always gravitate toward the salmon plate, which nearly always includes a bagel and cream cheese, chopped hardboiled eggs, red onion and capers. In keeping with that I added a few capers to this egg salad and went light on the mayonnaise.  He ate this on crostini - and loved it.

This was so easy and tasted great!  I made a few changes based on what I had on hand.  I added a chopped red pepper, chopped pickled banana peppers, celery and a little bit of white onion.  I also used less mayo and added about a teaspoon of lemon juice.  Unfortunately, I didn't have fresh dill, but next time I will definitely get fresh dill for this.  I didn't add salt either since the lox I used was pretty salty already.  Thanks for idea Donna!

This was an incredible recipe...  i wasn't sure at first, but my whole family loved it and since i have chickens with fresh eggs all the time, the family is somewhat bored with most egg recipes.

Maybe I should have used more smoked salmon, but I found this to be quite common.  much like regular old egg salad.

I served this in little pastry cups for a cocktail party and people really loved them.  It made a good pop-in-your-mouth appetizer that was different than the standard cocktail fare.

This is a great, pretty fast recipe.  Just used dill from the jar and it worked well.  also used a quarter of a white onion.  A little too onion-y.

Easy to make. Absolutely delicious! If one can chop and measure, easy!
