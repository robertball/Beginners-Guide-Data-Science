This dinner qualified me for domestic diva for the day!  It was delicious!  Buy the fresh rosemary, it's worth it!  

I used chicken breasts since that's what we prefer.  I halved them lengthwise like large chicken tenders.  I mixed everything up as directed in step 2 but I baked the seasoned potatoes for 30 minutes then added the chicken to the same pan for the last 30 minutes.  Since I was using smaller pieces and white chicken,  I didn't want the chicken to dry out by cooking for an entire hour.  

It was PERFECT!  The chicken provided some extra juices that made the potatoes to die for.  

I'll be making this again soon.  We all loved it!

Don't rate the recipe if you are changing everything but the name of the recipe. Holy , submit your own recipe. Don't change everything and give this recipe 2 stars because you did not try this recipe and went off on your own to create a tasteless, worthless creation. If yours is so awesome then post it! If not then shut up. This is a great recipe as is. Enough said!

This recipe was incredible.  I did make a few changes though.  As listed previously, I peeled back the skin and seasoned the chicken.  I also used fresh garlic (about 4 gloves) and fresh rosemary but dried oregano.  I marinated the meat and potatoes together for an hour before cooking.  The chicken was beautiful-wonderful flavor and juicy inside, cripsy out.  The potatoes I cut into wedges and they were lovely as well.  Perhaps some fresh lemon juice on them would add a little kick?  This one is a keeper!  And the fresh rosemary is definitely worth it!

This recipe was delcious, especially the potatoes.... I did what others had suggested and drained the oil after an hour of baking, and then cooked it for another 15 minutes.  I just eyeballed the seasonings to my taste and found the potatoes did need a little more salt when they had finished.  They were fabulous though-- crispy on the outside as others had said, and soft on the inside.  The chicken crisped up perfectly, though may have been a tad dry after cooking for an hour fifteen.  Next time,I will likely pull it out after the first hour.  Overall, super!

Very good and very easy. I will definately be making this again. I added onion and some baby bella mushrooms. I also added the juice of a lemon, 2 tblsp of mustard, and a tblsp of worchestire sauce to the olive oil. It is now my husband's favorite dinner.

This was excellent! I went with boneless chicken breasts also and put the potatoes in the oven for 1/2 an hour before I put the chicken in. The chicken did not dry out and the potatoes still soaked up that chicken flavor the last 1/2 hour of baking! Great recipe and very easy to make.

Very good!  We don't like chicken thighs, so I used bone-in, skin-on breasts instead.  Brined them for 45 minutes in 2 quarts of water with 1/4 cup each of table salt & sugar (if you do this, be sure to rinse the chicken well after brining!).  Used Yukon Gold potatoes & chunked them up rather than quartering them.  And, I think most important, I DID NOT cover the dish while baking it.  I thought that covering would definintely impact how crispy everything would get.  It sure couldn't have been easier, but I think next time I'll use fresh garlic, because the garlic taste was minimal.  Smelled great while it was roasting!  Thanks for the post!

This was very tasty, a good bistro type meal. I used Yukon potatoes because that is what I had on hand. Based on other's concerns...I drained the extra liquid off about half way thru and did NOT baste at the end and it was perfect...the potatoes were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and the chicken was moist and juicy. Everyone had seconds and I wish I had doubled the whole thing! Served it with the sugar snap peas with mint recipe also from this site. Very nice dinner, thanks for sharing!

I am giving this recipe five stars I thought it was very very good.  My husband didn't like it as much but still ate it and and took it for lunch the next day.  I didn't use as much oil as call for and it was still very good.  I thought it was light and fresh.  I can't say it was crispy I do recemend that you use a baking sheet instead of a roasing pan I think then it would get crispy.  I will be making this again

All right, you people, stop with the "This is how I made it...." It is wonderful just the way it is. By the way, Rosemary is extremely easy to grow - the more you cut it the better it does! Don't buy it - grow it!

The potatoes turned out absolutely delicious. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and it turned out dry. I think this recipe would only be good for bone-in thighs. But it definitely was crispy. Use coarse salt if you have it, adds lots of flavor to the potatoes.

Okay ... here's how I made this and it was beyond fantastic ... I used chicken thighs bone in skin on ... I used red potatoes ... I used rosemary and the rest as recipe suggests ... I put everything into a huge bowl ... olive oil, rosemary, oregano, garlic powder, salt, pepper (lemon pepper) ... (lots lots of all spices ... I used dried spices) ... mixed everything with my hands ... in the big bowl ... then I poured everything on to a cookie sheet type pan ... I used one of those round ones used for pizza ... a really big one ... then after doing all of that, I added a little more seasoned salt (Lawry's) ... pepper and rosemary on top of everything including putting rosemary under the chicken skin (all very very easy and fast) ... then I allowed all to sit for perhaps two hours ... room temp ... baked 375 for precisely one hour ... maybe a little longer ... everything was brown, crispy and totally yummy ... I made it for my husband and myself and we loved it!!!  It was very rosemary-ee ... smelled lucious during the cooking process and a dish that I would serve to guests ... really ... I served it with quickly boiled brocolli and a small salad ... too good ... I will definitely keep this in my arsenal of weapoons ... but what I really love about this recipe is it's ease of ingredients and preparation ... the end result is far better than the easy effort ... I highly recommend this dish ... just watch it ... when it becomes browed and crispy you will be able to 'see' this ...

Four stars only because the potatoes were awesome.  I used drumsticks and dried rosemary. I also added dried basil. Before coating the chicken, I put little slits on each side of the drumsticks.  I cut the potatoes into eighths and baked them for 15 minutes more than the chicken.  Chicken was a little bland on the inside but the potatoes (not fries, but more like wedges) were delicious.  If I make this next time, I will soak the chicken in a sort of brine prior to coating them.

This recipe was awesome but I did make some changes as other reviewers suggested.  I added 1 tablespoon of Worchestershire sauce, 2 tablespoons of dijon mustard, 4 cloves of minced garlic in place of garlic powder, the juice of 1 lemon, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper to the olive oil.  Will definitely make again!

I have been making a version of this recipe for years. Actually a recipe I got from my mother-in-law. My only change is I add baby carrots and lower the oven temp to 300 degrees. I also cover the baking dish. Then uncover it to brown up for the last half hour. This gives the chicken and potatoes another hour or so to bake and fall off the bone tender, with a very tasty potato flavor.

This was an excellent way to prepare chicken and potatoes in one pan!  After reading some of the reviews, here is what I decided to do, based on our preferences.  First, I placed the prepped red potatoes in a large bowl, and added a medium onion, vertically sliced.  Next, I sprinkled about 3 Tbs. of chopped fresh rosemary and 2 Tbs. fresh chopped parsley over the potatoes and onion.  In a small bowl, I combined 1/4 c. E.V.O., several grinds of black pepper, about 1 1/2 tsp. sea salt, and 2 crushed cloves of garlic.  I let this sit while I prepared the chicken.  I cut off all visible fat, rinsed and patted dry, but left most of the skin intact.  Next I placed a 4" sprig of rosemary beneath the chicken skin, and added a little sea salt and fresh ground black pepper.  I combined the potato combo and the olive oil mixture and placed them on a I lightly oiled jelly roll pan.  I placed the chicken pieces, skin side up, among the vegetables and herbs, careful to keep everything in one layer.  1 hour at 375, and everything was delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

If I make this again and use chicken thighs I'll revise my review.  However, I used chicken breast and overall the dish tasted bland to me.  I used a generous amount of all the spices and then some.  The potatoes tasted great but my boneless, skinless chicken breast....not so much.  I'm trying to make healthier dishes.  I did put the chicken about 30 minutes later.  It wasn't dry... just lacked in flavor still.

This recipe is GREAT. Instead of chicken breasts, I used bone-in, skin on thigh/leg quarters; the chicken was juicy and delicious (and I don't even like the dark meat--did this soley for economic purposes at first). My two year old adores this, especially the "fries" which are more like the potato wedges you get from KFC. I reccomend spicing up the chicken more with poultry seasoning or mixed italian dried herbs, and adding some carrots with the potatos to get another veggie in. Also, use a large enough pan that the veggies don't crowd or end up under the chicken, or they won't crisp up/brown. I have made this recipe about 4 times now...a true keeper!

My family has been making a similar dish for years. We use bone-in, skin on thighs and legs, carrots cut into 1 in. pieces as well as potatoes, and thyme instead of oregano.

It's a keeper!  I used boneless thighs and followed recipe.  The only addition was half of a large onion and probably was pretty heavy-handed with the fresh oregano and rosemary.  Cooked it for an hour and the chicken was very tender with good flavor.  Kids and husband enjoyed it!  Great family dinner...thanks Sandy!

Great recipe!  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and dried herbs instead of fresh.  I baked for a full hour and the meat turned out very tender and moist and the potatoes were done perfectly.

I found this absolutely delightful. I highly recommend using the fresh herbs as stated. I started to refine after the 5th or sixth time and now I mix all the herbs and garlic with olive oil, pour it over the chicken and potatoes in a big bowl, cover with saran wrap, shake a bit and then marinate for an hour in fridge before cooking. Baste as stated during last 15 minutes. Delicious and the house smells heavenly.

This was awesome!  I don't normally like dark meat much, but had some thighs I needed to use up.  I had to adjust to what I had on hand, so I used about 1/4 (or less) cup of olive oil, dried rosemary, dried thyme, 2 cloves of garlic, pressed, salt and pepper.  I rubbed under the skin, and then some on the skin, and baked as directed.  I did pour off the oil the last 10 minutes, and these turned out WONDERFUL!  I can wait to make it again w/ fresh herbs!  The BF and I had just come back from Sams, and he smelled something there he wanted, but we needed to use up the chicken, and he was SO GLAD he didn't insist on buying whatever it was he smelled!  He said this was the best smelling food he can remember!  YUM!  Can't wait to make it again! **EDIT**  The first time I made this I didn't have any potatoes on hand, so I just did the chicken, however I made again last night following the directions exactly, and I was a little disappointed in the potatoes.  They seemed to come out really mushy.  I will continue to make the chicken as directed, but will probably not make w/ the potatoes.  The flavor was good, but just too mushy and greasy.  Chicken was awesome though!

This was good! I used baking potatoes and cut them into chunks. I took the chicken out with about 15 minutes left and just let the potatoes roast for the rest of the time. I used dried herbs and had no problems-pretty darn good!

I absolutely love the simplicity of this recipe. I used fresh herbs and 3 cloves of chopped garlic. I needed to use up some boneless chicken breast so I substituted for the thighs. I did use a bit less oil (I just eyeballed it). I cut the potatoes into 1 inch chunks. I put everything in a ziplock bag and threw it in the fridge. When ready to cook I put just the potatoes in (covered) at 375 for 30 mins. Then I added the chicken an cooked an additional 30 mins (uncovered). I forgot to baste but the chicken was perfect. Juicy, flavorful, delish. The potatoes were fantastic. soft inside. Some were crispy on one side. Perhaps flipping them the last 15 mins would help. Great flavor- fresh herbs and garlic make the difference between a good dish and a great dish.

This recipe is wonderful! I prepared mine slightly differently than the directions in that I mixed everything in a big mixing bowl first (and made sure to rub the spices under the chicken skin as other reviewers suggested) then poured it onto a cookie sheet and cooked as directed. My husband and I loved it so much we prepared a large batch with just the chicken and put into several vacuum sealed bags to keep in the freezer for even faster/easier use as the thighs were on sale when we made it. We also brought some to a friends house the other night and cooked the chicken on the grill and everyone raved about it. Awesome and versatile recipe!

This was very good, though not a hit with my kiddos- this is a moist, delicious recipe for chicken thighs and I quite liked the potatoes too :)

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. Marinated the chicken in a little olive oil, several dashes of worchestershire, tbsp of lemon juice, oregano, rosemary, garlic powder, and pepper.  I didn't measure I just sprinkled it in. Followed the rest of the recipe. Great! The kids liked it and they normally don't like chicken. I did roast the potatoes for 20 min and added onions to potatoes, then added chicken and cooked an additional 45 min.

This is a close version to a meal I have been making for years. I brush the chicken and potatos with olive oil then sprinkle with rosemary and seasoning salt. I add the spuds and let them cook at 375 for 20 to 25 mins then add the chicken and a sliced sweet onion then reduce the temp to 350. What is so great about it is that you can put your own spin on it. Thanks for sharing

Simple, tasty. Per others' suggestions, I started the potatoes cooking first and added cut up, seasoned chicken breast after about 40 minutes.

Very good. I didn't have red potatoes on hand, and just used white ones. They turned out a bit mushy, so next time I'll try the red. The chicken was great! I used bone-in breasts with skin and they turned out incredibly moist and flavourful. Will make again.

Yum! Used chicken breasts (cut in strips) and mixed fresh seasoning with red potatoes and EVOO. I then removed the chicken & roasted the potatoes @375 for 30 minutes on a cookie sheet, turned potatoes over to brown other side & added the seasoned chicken strips to roast together the last 30 min. turning everything over once more before the last 15 minutes for extra crispness! Potatoes were perfectly crisped & chicken moist & tender! Definitely will be making this one again!

For me, it's all about marination time. Whenever I cook any meat, I try and prepare it at least 4 to 8 hours in advance. This is a classic combination. Rosemary, garlic, chicken is delicious. This recipe would also work well on lamb. I use fresh garlic instead of powdered. Also, I almost always use about twice the amount of seasoning that's in the recipe. I just like well-seasoned food.

Italian families make a similar dish frequently adding chunks of Italian sausage, onions, and sliced garlic cloves.  Very tasty.  Cut down on the olive oil if using the Italian sweet or hot sausage. Usually the sausage is layered over the potatoes and onions andgarlic which is put on top of the chicken in the roasting pan.  Great flavors with the rosemary and oregano.

This was amazing.  It was super fast and super easy to make.  I used a whole cut up chicken, but otherwise didn't change a thing.  Everyone fell on it like they'd never seen food and weren't sure they were ever eating again.

Very moist & flavorful, lots of flavor bang for very little prep time.  Fresh herbs are the key, otherwise don't bother!  I added sliced carrots just because I didn't want to prepare a separate veggie dish, otherwise made exactly as written.  There were no leftovers!

Really, really good.  I cooked four thighs and five or six medium size red potatoes with fresh rosemary, fresh garlic and fresh oregano.  My daughter and I really enjoyed the meal...I thought we'd have leftovers for the next night, but by midnight snack time it was all gone.  This is definitely a keeper.  I would use a bit less oil than called for, and I always season my chicken liberally with freshly ground pepper and sea salt several hours ahead of time.  This seems to allow the seasoning to penetrate the surface and I like the results.

I made this according to the directions, using four bone-in thighs and six bone-in legs and about eight very small (about 1.5" long) potatoes.  I used all dry herbs/spices and added about a Tablespoon of worcestershire sauce and spicy mustard (per another's reviews).  I drained the liquid after half an hour, poured what I'd drained back over the chicken, and then drained it again.  The potatoes were not really crunchy - I think it's because of the type of potatoe.  The chicken was okay but we had to add additional salt (I didn't use much to begin with not being sure how much it'd use).

This was the first recipe from this site I've used that has turned out to be so disappointing.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, although I didn't add as much olive oil after reading previous reviews.  I pan-fried the chicken a little bit to brown it, and I baked the potatoes for about 25 minutes before adding the chicken on top.  I marinated the entire thing all together overnight to let the flavors of the rosemary, garlic, and oregano soak in.  The dish smelled delicious while baking.  However, when I tried one of the potatoes, they were so--BLAND!!  I was really excited about this recipe, because it sounded fantastic.  I enjoyed the flavor of the rosemary, but it made the whole dish a little sweet without adding any real kick to it.  I sprinkled some seasoning over the whole dish, and added way more salt, but it just did not turn out well.  The recipe had no bite to it, was very bland, and I would NOT recommend it.  My dad, who loves just about everything and is the least picky person I know, added salt, seasoning, and then BBQ sauce to his chicken--which tells me it was really horrible.  The next night, he had a few of the potatoes, but he wouldn't touch the chicken.  

One thing I thought might've improved the recipe was if I'd added some breadcrumbs to the potatoes, and if I'd used white wine as a base for the dish--but even then I'm just not sure.  There are way better recipes on this site...I'll just keep looking.

This is now on the top of my "Go To" chicken dishes! WOW! It can be very hard to get chicken that is truly crispy on the outside & moist on the inside when it comes to baking. This recipe gets it just right. The cooking time & temp on this is nearly perfect. (My oven runs a little hot on every recipe, so at one hour, the chicken was actually at 180 degrees, instead of the 165 it needs to be at, so next time I will just decrease my cooking time by roughly 5 minutes & that should do the trick... even so, it was still very juicy!).
 
I must say that fresh Rosemary is well worth your money & a trip to the store. It flavors the potatoes & chicken so perfectly & simultaneously tastes very natural & gourmet. I realized after my trip to the store that I had left fresh Oregano off of my list & had to substitute dried. It was just fine that way, but next time I will make sure to have fresh on hand to see if there is a huge difference. I added 1/4 tsp of Cajun Seasoning to 2 of the thighs for my husband & I & those turned out KILLER! 

I have a VERY picky 3yr old & he ate an entire chicken thigh to himself & asked for more!! That's all that needs to be said! 

I can't wait to make this again for my in-laws. It's very quick & easy, but tastes like you spent much more time than you actually do. You can really customize this recipe to your personal tastes, but it honestly doesn't need any tweeking to make it scrumptious! Keeper!

Really delicious.  I used Yukon potatoes and a whole chicken.  Took about 1 and 45 to cook and I took the potatoes out about fifteen minutes before that.  Even my picky six year old told me how much he loved it.  This will go into heavy rotation in my house.

Hi all.  I used skinless  boneless thighs & marinaded with the fresh rosemary, oregano, sliced garlic & olive oil for about 90 min.  put the thighs and potato wedges on a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper.  after 1 hr in the oven I transferred it to a casserole dish to serve.  included carrots steamed with brown sugar and brussel sprouts with almonds.  the parchment paper went in the garbage & no mess to clean.  my hubby & 15 yr old son both loved it.  i am on a raw food diet so could not rate the recipe but it did smell lovely.  btw i had coleslaw and a grated beet salad which were lovely.  would really like to see more raw recipes on this site.

My 4 year old helped me prepare this meal.  We used drumsticks as those are her favorite.  I turned the chicken and brushed the meat and potatoes with the oil in the pan throughout the cooking time.  Tastey!

I made this last night and it was excellent. So easy to make after work and it was ready for supper. I only had chicken thighs so that is what I used. I didn't peel the potatoes I just scrubbed them and cut them up. I would suggest cutting the potatoes in fairly small pieces depending on the size of the chicken pieces you use. The thighs I used were quite small so they were done a bit before the potatoes were done and this is so delicious you want the potatoes soft.Be sure to baste once everything starts to brown. I also didn't have fresh herbs so I used approximately 1/2 tbsp dried rosemary and 1/2 tsp dried oregano. This was not to much of either of these herbs but I love the flavor of rosemary. I also sprinkled about 1 tsp salt and a sprinkle of lemon pepper because that is what I had handy. I would highly recommend this recipe if you are in a hurry and need to get a meal on the table with little fuss.Thanks for sharing it Sandy.

Truly delicious!  I used all fresh herbs from my garden, I whisked all the herbs together, including fresh garlic and some olive oil and used this mixture under the skin, I let the chicken sit on this for about one hour.  I also followed previous reviews and put the potatoes first for 30 minutes (along with the herb mixture and some coarse salt).  The result was awesome, the chicken skin was so CRISPY and tasty, the meat very juicy and the potatoes were perfect!!  This is a GREAT recipe.    I am not sure about the amount of herbs I used tough, probably a little more than the recipe...  It turned out about a quarter size herb mixture per chicken piece.

This was pretty darn good! Made it last night and loved how easy it was! Ours turned out very crispy...but I'd be sure to turn the chicken over half way or so through the cooking time. Also alternated cooking uncovered with cooking with aluminum foil over the top, and added about 10 min or so to the cooking time.  We omitted the potatoes to keep the carbs down and used carrots and halved cherry tomatoes instead. Nice color!  Next time though I will be sure to use fresh garlic  and rosemary, and add some spices under the skin. The meat was incredibly tender, but a bit bland. Maybe will marinate for an hour or so as some others mentioned, and squeeze a bit of fresh lemon juice on top. There definitely will be a next time!!!!:)

Well, my mom loved this.  As for me, I thought it was just okay.  It had a nice herb-y aroma and flavour.  I thought it would've needed more flavour so I added 3 crushed cloves of garlic, a sprig of fresh parsley, 1 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp rosemary, salt and pepper, 1/2 tsp oregano, and 1/2 tsp thyme.  I marinated the chicken pieces while I went to the gym.  When I came home, I baked this covered for 40min.  I cooked different potatoes (Oven Roasted Potatoes).  They tasted great together.

I loved this recipe!! I got home late one night and had to feed my mom , sister , and 4 children...I tried this recipe and dinner was served less than 90 min later...all my kids loved it and they are notoriously picky eaters....one note , though...I changed the oregano to sage by mistake and it still tasted awesome...go ahead and try it!! Your tastebuds will agree...

This one-pan roasting technique works for just about any kind of meat (or seafood, if you add it to the pan last). Sometimes, I use fresh sausages. At 375-400, vegetables will roast in about 20 minutes (and are delicious!); small potatoes take about 35-40 minutes. Just spritz everything with olive oil and whatever seasonings you prefer. I usually start with the meat and potatoes, if I'm using them, and then add the veg in about 15-20 minutes. Using non-stick foil to line the pan, dinner's done in less than an hour with NO CLEAN-UP.

My teenaged son picked this recipe to cook for us. He did exactly as directed but was sidelined by a rookie's mistake. I always use skinless chicken breasts which he says are sometimes dry.  He bought chicken thighs but didn't trim excess fat and skin. The fat off the thighs was too much. We did drain some of it off but it didn't brown as nicely as he had hoped. Sometimes mom is right   :)

I was looking for something to make with chicken thighs(I don't usually cook with). This recipe was awesome! I really don't know what people think changing up recipes so much. I followed and it's a winner and keeper! The only thing I did was moved from baking dish to cookie sheet for the last 15 minutes. This made potatoes nice and crispy. Thank you for sharing. I love Allrecipes I find soooooo many GREAT recipes for all foods.

I absolutely love this recipe! It is such a tasty, quick, and easy meal. I have made it several times. 

It is great as is, but in order to cut back on the oil lately, I have been spraying the pan with olive oil (in a Misto sprayer), placing the chicken and potatoes in the pan, spraying them liberally with oil, then sprinkling the seasoning on top. I baste a few times in the last 15 minutes, and broil for a few minutes towards the end as well. I also sometimes use mini potatoes cut in half to make the prep even quicker.

I've been meaning to try this on a whole chicken, because it makes the best skin ever!

DH's favorite part is the thigh, but I don't care for them very much.  A large package of thighs was on sale and I decided to try this and freeze the rest.  Yum, I am glad I found this recipe (and found the sale!).  The rest of the thighs in the freezer will be made with this recipe!  Thanks!

This recipe is wonderfully delicious. I used only enough olive oil to coat the chicken and potatoes. I used kosher salt and coarse ground pepper. Since I only had russet potatoes , I scrubbed and quartered them. They were soft in the middle just the way we like them and crusty on the outside. The chicken thighs were moist and tender... mmm good. It's a keeper, will do it again and again!

The aroma in the kitchen drove us crazy. Followed the ingredients of the recipe but didn't measure. It turned out great...it's a keeper. Our doctor will not be impressed with our eating the crispy skin :-) The potatoes were done to perfection by cutting them in quarters. I had my chicken thighs in a gallon bag and just added all the ingredients to it, shook it up and made sure everything was bathed in the sauce. It all went into the pan. Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

So delicious and savory. I used fresh rosemary, thyme, and one sage leaf (omitted oregano) and also added carrots and a little diced shallot. Baked for 55 minutes and it came out super juicy. Basted it a little with melted butter 15-min. before complete.

I really liked this recipe as a starting point.  When I tasted the marinade prior to adding it to the chicken and potatoes, I found it lacking so I added lemon juice and garlic.  I think it would also do well with sundried tomatoes or some pesto.

Delicious! And easy, too! I made this for dinner on Friday & my boyfriend even said that this recipe is definitely a keeper! The skin on the thighs got nice & crispy but the chicken still had a nice juicy flavor. I didn't use fresh rosemary or oregano, but let the chicken "marinade" for a few hours in the olive oil, rosemary, oregano, salt & pepper. Then I laid the chicken on a greased baking sheet, tossed the potatoes in the remaining oil, spread those on the same baking sheet & salted them before going in the oven. I did more "dice" the potatoes and next time I think I will leave them as wedges.

Excellent!  Using other reviewers suggestions, I added to olive oil and herbs some dijon mustard, worcestershire and some lemon juice.  I used all fresh herbs.  I marinated the potatoes and chicken for an hour.  I set the potatoes in for 30 minutes and added the chicken for 30 more.  I'll drain the marinade at about the halfway point for the potatoes next time I make this, so that they crisp up a bit better.  The flavor was a hit with my family!

This recipe was incredible. I did make a few changes though. As listed previously, I peeled back the skin and seasoned the chicken. I also used fresh garlic (about 4 gloves) and fresh rosemary but dried oregano. I marinated the meat and potatoes together for an hour before cooking. The chicken was beautiful-wonderful flavor and juicy inside, cripsy out. The potatoes I cut into wedges and they were lovely as well. Perhaps some fresh lemon juice on them would add a little kick? This one is a keeper! And the fresh rosemary is definitely

Just made this and its pretty good. Only thing is I found it had too much oil in it so next time I will cut back on it.  I also added brussel sprouts in the pan and they turned out great! This recipe is very similar to another recipe here for Greek roasted potatoes. This is a keeper  :)

Yum, yum!!! Made this 4 dinner 2nite. My fiance & I thought this was GREAT! I am always happy when the dishes I prepare look pretty. Not only was my chx. golden brown, it was also crispy on the outside / tender thruout and my potatoes were crispy & buttery. I pretty much followed Sandy's direct. to a T except for subbing 2 bone-in chx. breasts (I do not like dk. meat, but my fiance will eat either) & using the full amt. of spices (must use fresh!)/EVOO/potatoes called for (we wanted an intense herb flavor & also like potatoes - a LOT!). For ease of prep., I tossed everything in a lg. bowl. There are 2 reasons why I think my chx. & potatoes crisped up so nicely. First, as one reviewer suggested, after quartering my potatoes, I rinsed & dried them VERY well (w/ a kitchen towel) to remove the excess starch, then proceeded as directed. Secondly, I baked everything on a lg., wide-rimmed baking sheet placed on the upper rack of my oven for the 1st hr., then moved the sheet to the next lower rack and basted in 5 min. intervals for a total of 15 min. Perfect! Served w/ katsup for dipping (great idea!), chx. flavored stuffing & warm Italian bread, this was a delicious meal (and insanely easy to prepare too). B/c my meat was a tad bland (I do not eat the skin), I think I will try brining next time. Oh, and be sure to s&p your potatoes VERY well... not only will it add flavor, it will help keep them yummy moist. Thx. Sandy :)

I used breasts instead of thighs and fresh garlic rather than powdered. My herbs were straight from the garden. I took others advice and put some of the seasoning between the breast and skin. The chicken was dry despite frequent basting, but the skin was crispy and tasty. The potatoes, however were outstanding! This recipe has 5 star potential and the next time I make it I will allow the chicken to marinate, in a tightly sealed plastic baggie, for 4+ hours or overnight. I really think that is what is needed for the flavors to infuse into the meat. This was a nice recipe and I thank you for sharing.

I LOVED this recipe!  So quick and easy.  I didn't have fresh oregano, so I used dried.  Fresh rosemary is a must.  I cut the potatoes into wedges.  I don't think it needs to marinate like other reviewers have suggested.  I think it needs a liberal amount of salt.  Great recipe, I will be making this again soon!

This was great. Super quick, easy and yummy. I only got to marinate this for about 25 minutes and it still had a ton of flavour. I used skinless, bone in chicken breasts and the meat was nice and moist. My potatoes got crispy but I find the trick is as after you cut them, rinse them with cold water and pat super dry and then coat. Gets rid of the starch on the outside. I scaled it for 2 but still used the same amount of seasonings, which made just a bit too herby, so next time I will scale back the herbs as well. Loved this!

Love this recipe, I've made it twice now. Once with fresh herbs and once with dry herbs, because I didn't have any on hand. I like the fresh better, but the dry will do just fine in a pinch. This is a easy weeknight recipe. My family including my 9 yr old daughter loves it.

Hubby and I enjoyed the crispiness of the chicken (bone-in thighs) and the red potato wedges. I followed the very easy recipe as written, and sprinkled 1 tbsp of fresh lemon juice over all before serving.  I do suggest using a foil-lined cookie sheet for easy cleanup.  The aroma in the kitchen was wonderful.  I will be definitely making this again.

Fabulous!!! This was so fast and easy to throw together! I don't normally use thighs, but it was very good. I will absolutely make this again, however, I may use the boneless skinless chicken breast instead as I prefer the taste of the breast meat.

Really tasty.  Store was out of fresh rosemary (sad!) and I realized I was short on dried, but I gave it everything I had and it was still good.  Not very rosemary-y, but still good with just salt and pepper.  I omitted the oregano.  I have a pregnancy-induced hatred of oregano.  I used a whole chicken, with half an onion in the cavity.  Roasted it at 250 for about 4-5 hours and just added the potatoes for the last couple of hours.  Delicious!  All my boys gobbled it down.

Outstanding! Wonderful combination of seasonings that baked up to pure perfection. I used chicken breast and adjusted bake time accordingly. The last 5 minutes or so I did under the broiler to get a nice crisped outside. Next time I will add chunks of carrot with the potatoes only because I like the combination. Will absolutely make this again.

I baked this in two batches -- one Tuesday afternoon, and the rest today (Thursday) morning.  Tuesday's was too much rosemary, but today was just right, and I can't say why, since I prepped them all at the same time (Tues afternoon, just letting today's batch sit in the fridge since that afternoon).  I used 2 packages of 3 chicken breasts, coming to 6.5 lbs., and cut each breast in half.  I omitted the potatoes, since I was just interested in the chicken, and I included just a little over 1T of rosemary in each bag that i prepped (one ziplock for each package of chicken).  Plus, I subbed in 1.5 t of Italian seasoning for the oregano bc that's what I had on hand. I was afraid that the batch I made for today's lunch would be even more overwhelmingly strong-in-rosemary, since it had "marinated" for a couple days, but it was perfect!  Regardless, great recipe, I'll just watch how much rosemary I actually put in each bag next time, and try it with the potatoes too.

This was easy and delicious, which is my favorite combination!!  I actually prepped this in the morning, left it in the fridge, then baked it when I got home.  I used skinless chicken thighs, skinless chicken breast for hubby, and yukon gold potatoes because that is what I had on hand.  We will definitely be having this one again!

Oh my!  This was one of the best chicken thigh recipes I've ever made.  I used boneless/skinless thighs.  This is definitely a keeper.  I used all dried herbs - just sprinkled on top of chicken and potatoes.  My DGD is coming over for leftovers tonight!  Absolutely delicious!!!

This is incredible. I only rated 4 stars, because I am not sure if would be so fantastic exactly as written. I added an onion, 2 carrots and whole cloves of garlic to the pan - and these were my favorite parts of the dish. The chicken was super moist and delicious and the potatoes were cooked perfectly. I highly recommend adding onions, potatoes and garlic cloves - they carmelized and added great sweetness to the dish. I will be making this over and over.

Repeat this recipe again, and again, and again if you can!  Simply delicious with, one or two enhancements.  I made this using 10 thighs with the skin left attached on one side of the thigh.  After cleaning the thighs, I brined the chicken (using ½ cup salt (next time I’ll use ¼ cup), ½ cup sugar (next time I’ll use ¾ cupe), 1 tbsp cloves and about ¼ to ½ cup of cider vinegar).  I let the chicken sit in the brine for about 3 hours.  I did not have fresh oregano, so I use dried instead.  I seasoned the chicken (under the skin) with the usual suspects (onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, etc.) I then replaced the skin over the chicken and cooked everything uncovered for about 1 hour 40 minutes.  I had left over potatoes after cutting, so I seasoned them with onion soup mix and made it in a separate pan in the oven.  (Those turned more crispy than the ones in with the chicken, but it was all good).  And…although unhealthy, the skin on the chicken was so crispy, and delicious!!  Will definitely repeat this again….soon.

Very delicious, BF loved it. I marinated the chicken in the olive oil, lots of herbs, and garlic only b/c others spoke of it. Everything came out great. I made the mistake of having too much chicken, and no room for the potatoes which ended up in a baking dish. They did not get flavored as well being away from the chicken. I'm still learning.

Very tasty and everyone in the family plus grandpa enjoyed! The only thing I will change next time is to reduce the olive oil...to pay attention to the "or as needed" part of the recipe because the fries turned out kind of oily/greasy for our taste. Otherwise, inexpensive and easy to make!

I made this using bone-in chicken breasts.  I cut way back on the oil and just drizzled enough on to coat the chicken and potatoes.  I did use the fresh rosemary and oregano.  It smelled great while roasting, and turned out ok, but not one of our favorites.

I made the recipe as written, and it was just okay.  I thought that the chicken needed some extra seasoning, it was a bit bland.  The potatoes were good, but not all that crispy.

I rarely rate things that I think are less than 5 star, but  I had to give my input on this one. I followed the recipe to the T and the chicken turned out greasy and not crispy like it was supposed to. Bland in flavor, I had to add quite a bit of salt to make it edible. Sorry, this one just wasn't good in our opinion.

Super good!! I put on 450° for the last 15 minutes and basted to get it to brown properly. Skin wasn't actually "crispy" but it was definitely edible! Didn't exactly measure ingredients, just dusted generously and evenly. Also, used sea salt. Next time, will probably use more rosemary because it was super food when it was crispy and salty! Yum!

This was really yummy, but my chicken and fries weren't crispy.  Not sure what I did wrong.  The flavor of the potatoes was outstanding and so was the chicken.  Just didn't have the crispness I was hoping for.  I will definitely try again!

I will say that I couldn't find fresh rosemary, so I used dried and this was fairly bland.  The potatoes were good, and I took advice of others and took the chicken out when it was done (after only 45 min.), drained the juice, and cooked the potatoes 15 min. more.

I enjoyed this recipe although I made some variation. I used fingerling potatoes and fresh garlic. Since my garden is bursting with fresh herbs at this time, before serving I placed a bowl of fines herbs on the table for all to sprinkle. The recommended Sauvignon Blanc is a good suggestion to accompany. I chose a 2007 Cloudy Bay from New Zealand.

Tasted great and was super easy. I only changed one thing: I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I cut the potatoes into french fries and I made a quick rosemary dipping sauce with mayonnaise, garlic and rosemary. My roommates loved it!

This was really really REALLY good!!!!!  I put it on the second time after basting it for 20 min. other than 15 because 15 was to little.  I followed everything by the recipe except that!  It was a HIT at my house, that is why it desserves 5 stars, because all five kids, plus two others we had over, and me LOVED it!  I am DEFINETELY reccomending this recipe to everyone.

This was an easy dish to prepare but I feel it needs a little work. The potatoes took almost twice as long as listed to cook and there was wayyyy too much oil used for my liking. It did have a good taste but there are better recipes that are similar out there so I don't think I'd make again.

This was awesome!  I used boneless skinless chicken breast and cut them in half and used russett potatoes instead of red potatoes since that's what I had on hand.  I baked the potatoes for 30 minutes then added the chicken for the remaining 30 minutes.  My fiance raved about this dish, I'll be making it again and again!

I made this tonight as a healthy break from all the holiday food we've been eating lately. I used 4 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts, and cut each width wise into 4 pieces. I only used about 1/4 cup of oil and that was plenty. I used russets because that's what I had. I didn't have fresh rosemary, or oregano, so I just sprinkled dried until I felt it looked substantial. I also used dried basil, a parsley and garlic powder blend, and a light sprinkling of lemon pepper. I roasted the potatoes by themselves for 30 minutes before adding the chicken for a final 45 minutes. I wouldn't call it crispy, but it was flavorful and my husband and children all loved it. I served this with steamed peas and carrots with dill, and with fat free chicken gravy. I think the leftovers will make a yummy chicken and veggie soup. Thanks for the recipe.

This is an amazing and extremely flavorful recipe. The only addition I made was adding the juice of one lemon to the marinade. I marinated the chicken and potatoes in the fridge for 2 hours prior to baking. I basted the chicken/fries every 15-20 mins during cooking. After the first hour of cooking, I removed the chicken as well as the liquids and crisped up the fries. Will definitely make this again!

If you want crispy chicken, be sure to space the thighs out evenly. Use 2 cookie sheets ( 4 thighs on each ) and space the potatoes between them. Add onions half-way through cooking to prevent them from being burnt in the end ( Unless you like it that way ). Also, as previous posters have mentioned, BRINE. 2 quarts of water, 1/4 cup of salt, 1/4 cup of sugar, and soak for 45 minutes. I've made this recipe without the brine and it doesn't taste nearly as good. This is a great, easy recipe if done right! (:

This was an excellent dish and so easy.  After reading others' comments, I marinated the chicken in an olive oil and lemon juice mixture with a portion of the herbs and spices for about an hour.  Then I added the potatoes into the mixture to coat them and put all of it onto a cookie sheet.  I topped it off with the remaining herbs and spices and some onion slices.  After cooking for 45 minutes, I drained the excess fat/oil out of the cookie sheet and turned the oven up to 450F for the last 15 minutes.  Turned out yummy and crispy!

Thanks to previous readers' suggestions, this recipe turned out very good. Not crispy but still very tasty.
First, I used boneless/skinless thighs. They weren't even totally thawed but that didn't seem to make a difference. I put the oil, rosemary (much more than called for), oregano and a big spoonful of chopped garlic in my Magic Bullet blender. I followed the rest of the recipe from there on out. It cooked in about 45 minutes.

This is a great, fast and easy recipe.  The flavor is awesome and it takes nearly no effort to make this.  I mix all the ingredients together and let it sit in the fridge for a little bit before throwing it all in the oven.  Turns out great!

This was so easy to make for week night dinner.  I cut back on the olive oil to 1/4c. and may cut back even more next time.  also cut potatoes into 8ths and they were perfect.  Fresh herbs are the way to go if you can.

This recipe is very good, even though I used dried herbs.  I did, however, cook it longer than the stated time, and it was still moist.  The potatoes are no french fries, but they are great anyway.  Maybe I'll slice them into 1/8 instead of 1/4 and see if they're more like fries.
My wife and mother-in-law loved it and we ate it all.  Make extra if you want leftovers.

Delicious!  We loved the flavor the combination of rosemary and oregano gave the chicken.  The meat was tender and moist.  Best of all it was so easy to prepare.  The recipe calls for fresh herbs and I definitely think it is worth the extra effort.  I made one slight change, I substituted seasoning salt for the salt.  I'm not sure I agree that the potatoes are crispy like french fries but they were yummy anyway.  My husband had two helpings of the potatoes and he normally does not care for potatoes.   Thanks Sandy.....

Sometimes on a rainy fall evening, on an icky train ride home, you just start longing for the comforting aroma of a homemade chicken dinner instead of, say, your damp and sullen seatmate. And sure enough, this chicken/rosemary/garlic combo made my nose practically leap off my face with joy. And the flavor! And the gorgeousness! I seriously love this recipe. Can you tell?

I made a half recipe of this, cooked it uncovered, as specified by the recipe, and basted twice, once at 30 minutes and once at 50 minutes. The skin of the chicken was crispy and really delicious--and I don't like chicken skin. I cut the potatoes in 8 pieces each and soaked them  in cold water for about an hour before I cooked them, and they puffed up and were perfectly cooked inside and crispy on the outside. This is going into regular rotation at our house.

I wonder if some of the people who were having trouble with too much liquid and/or sogginess were cooking this covered? The recipe is clear that it needs to be baked uncovered.

Thinking of making it for potluck next week now. I put in the chicken after 30 min as well. And listened to my roommate's suggestion to stuff a thin slice of lemon in each thigh. Used lemon pepper since I was already using lemon. And added tiny bit of chili because I just feel like it. Comes out great.

This was really good, but I can't believe it would turn out crispy if you truly cooked it all in one dish.  I separated the chicken and potatoes to avoid crowding in the pan - which always leads to sogginess in my experience. I did use fresh rosemary as suggested.

We really enjoyed this!  I didn't have any fresh oregano, so I used fresh thyme and rosemary.  Also, only had bone-in chicken breasts and legs.  My bowl wasnt big enough for everything, so I tossed the meat with the oil and half of the seasoning mixture first, then did the veggies with the other half and scattered them around the meat on the baking sheet.  Must agree with others, the veggies really came out great (I added some large onion chunks too).  Easy prep, house smelled wonderful, delicious meal!

I used dried herbs since I did not have fresh on hand. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I did remove skin first because I always do. With the left over drippings, I made gravy. My sister-in-law and I kept sayin mmmmmmmm...... Mmmmmmm...... Mmmmmmmm., the whole time we were eating. Saving this one to my recipe box!

Have tried it and make it over and over again as my family requests it! My son likes drumsticks so I throw some of those in too. I do not change a thing in the recipe, however, I do broil it for 5 minutes at the end to crisp it. Delicious!!

This is a good recipe, but I will have to make it again as written. Unfortunately, I followed the advice of some of the top reviews and doubled the topping. Personally, it was too much and I think it will be outstanding with the topping as written. I never like to alter the original recipes but felt compelled since so many had written that it needed more topping. More topping overwhelms the apples! Don't do it.

This was a great meal - my family agreed.  I did almost nothing outside the instructions, except that I used dried Rosemary and Oregano (1 teaspoon of each) and I drained the juice after 30 minutes of cooking.  Super simple, quick clean-up, incredible aroma, and delicious flavor.  I HIGHLY recommend this one.

I've made something similar to this before, but this was definitely better.  I did use fresh rosemary, oregano and garlic cloves.  It gets 5 stars for ease of preparation and flavor!  Next time I just have to make more.  My family inhaled it and were looking for seconds and there wasn't any.  Going to make this again for sure!

I've done a similar recipe for years, but in a smaller pan.  The oregano is a nice addition and I liked the idea of spreading everything out on a cookie sheet so I decided to try a jelly roll pan.  Thanks for the suggestion!

This dish was so spectacularly delicious! I have never made chicken taste so good. I did not follow any measurements, I just eyeballed the seasonings. I think a heavy duty cookie sheet makes the chicken and the "fries" really crispy. I actually started basting my chicken and "fries" after 30 mins and basted again 15 mins after that. Overall, a fantastic recipe; my wife loved it!

This was great and so easy!  I used russett potatoes because that's what I had on hand and they weren't crispy, but still very tasty.  I also rubbed under the skin with some italian seasoning and garlic salt.  Skin was crispy and meat was flavorful.  My husband raved!  Definately a keeper!

This was GREAT! I added some onion and baby carrots, used canola oil (all I had), dried herbs (all I had), but it worked. I would have liked the potatoes to crisp up a bit more, but that was my fault... It smelled so amazing and was making my entire family hungry so we took it out and ate it right up. Husband, 2 1/2 year old daughter and 1 year old son ate much more than they usually do. Will definitely be making it again, and it was soooo easy!

I thought this was pretty good and easy, my dad would like this dish.  Definitely use skin on, bone in thighs and you will be fine.  People w/dry chicken are probably using skinless boneless chicken breasts. Kids ate it but hubby did not seem that excited about it so I don't know if I will make it again.  Liked the potatoes, also made baby bella mushrooms in there, liked those in there, too.

The potatoes were great. The chicken was yummy. and prep and clean up were easy! We'll make this again...just be careful not to overcook. My boneless chicken thighs didn't need an hour. About 40 minutes was plenty for both the thighs and potatoes.

This recipe turned out great! I took a small
Chicken and quartered it, used the fresh rosemary but used dried oregano. I didn't measure any of my spicing or the oil but the seasoning can definitely be adjusted to your liking. Great for a quick yummy weeknight supper :)

This turned out really well considering it's limited ingredients.  It will not get cripy though, so don't expect that.  I used 5 smallish chicken thighs, two small idaho potatoes, cubed and one sweet potato sliced into wedges.  I reducted the olive oil to 1/4 cup and used the herbs and spices as written.  I did stir it up twice prior to serving and sprinkled about two tablespoons of bread crumbs over the top to give it a little crunch.  The chicken is so tender you can cut it with a fork.  Good flavor.  Great weeknight dish.

Really tasty and extremely fast and easy. I never got a crispy skin so I broiled it for about 10 minutes after cooking it for 1 hour. I made 2 versions of this. The 2nd time I added some misc veggies I had in the fridge which made it even better. Broiled all of them for 10 minutes which made them look and taste great.

I used skin on frozen thighs and baked them from frozen. Definitely remove the skin  and cut the oil in  half as it was an oily mess.  The chicken was moist as it always is when baked from frozen.  I'll try it again with 2 cookie sheets, skinless chicken and half the oil.  Then the potatos should crisp up.

The flavor of this is wonderful.  When my husband actually says he likes something I know it is a keeper.  I used chicken breasts that I cut in half length wise.  Soaked in Yashidas.  I put the potatoes on first then added the chicken half way through.  The flavor on the fries was a pleasant surprize.

I expected this to be amazing as many times as I seen it mentioned on the recipe buzz. I thought it was good, but the cooking time is way off! I had it in the over for 2 hours doubling the time suggested. I used 2 small chicken breasts and 4 legs over the chicken thighs, but that shouldn't have doubled the time. On the herbs I subbed 1/2 the amount listed for dried, as it was what I had, and the food was going to be baked anyway. I couldn't get the meat crispy as it seemed to steam from the potatoes I am guessing. I turned the heat up on the last 15 minutes to 425 to get just some browning, but definitely not crispy. Rosemary on chicken and potatoes is always a winning combination, but I think the cooking temp. and time needs to be adjusted on this one!

This is now my husbands favorite chicken. So quick and easy even he can make it himself - and he doesn't cook.  Even my picky 6 year old eats this with a smile.

I was really looking forward to this based on other peoples reviews, I was disappointed when the potatoes took 2 hours to cook, (even though I cut them into much smaller pieces than fourths) and we ended up eating dinner at 9:00 at night. I separated the chicken and fries into 2 separate dishes, because I did not feel comfortable cooking potatoes with raw chicken. I liked the idea of using fresh rosemary, and would like to give this another try but will give myself more time next time, and probably use boneless skinless chicken breast since we both just ended up peeling off the skin (and all the rosemary!) anyway.

Everyone enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have the fresh herbs on hand, so used dried.  Will definitely try again using fresh -- maybe then I'll have to up my rating to a 5!!!

Worked out great! I used chicken breasts instead of the thigh pieces.  For the last 7 minutes I put it on broil just to make the chicked a little crispier.  It didn't make it dry at all, but I wouldn't do any longer than that.  The whole family loved it, will make again!

This turned out great!  I put the chicken and all the seasonings and oil in a ziplock bag for 1 hr then tossed it with the potatoes and baked as directed.  The whole family gobbled it up!  I must say that fresh herbs are a MUST with this recipe.

I've made this four times so far and it is great.  So simple and so tasty.  I used bone-in, skin on thighs.  Like other reviewers I decided to marinate the chicken and potatoes.  Added the juice of half a lemon to the olive oil and spices, marinated for 1-2 hours, sprinkled everything liberally with herbed sea salt and baked for one hour.  Crispy, tasty skins, tender meat and the potatoes are to die for!

It was so delicious! I was so glad that I read the reviews before cooking. Some reviews were really helpful and i cooked with some suggestions. I peeled back the skin and rubbed some salt,pepper and garlic powder on the chiken. I marinated the chiken and potatoes together for 1 hour. I drained the extra liquid off after baking for 45 minutes and then cooked it for another 15 minutes. This is one of my favorite recipes:)

I've made this a few times since it's crazy easy and comes out tasting great.  I recommend using a mix of legs and thighs. Any potato should work in the recipe, but cut more wedges if they're large, otherwise they'll be too plump and won't crisp up nicely.   I highly recommend using fresh rosemary and garlic. And always use freshly cracked pepper.   Throw under the broiler for a few minutes at the end to crisp it all up (helps to baste it first). Delicious.

very tasty!  I only had boneless chicken thighs, so I cut the baking time to about 30 minutes.  I mixed the potatoes and ingredients in a separate bowl and placed them to bake for the first 30 min.  while they were baking I trimmed the excess fat from the chicken thighs, added all the ingredients together but aslo added a few splashes of lemon juice and poured some white wine over the mixture/chicken.  mixed it all together and let it marinate for the 30 min.  then I placed the chicken in the oven with the potatoes and cooked them for 30 minutes.  the lemon juice and wine really seemed to bring out the flavors of the rosemary.  I will make this again.

Cut the thighs in half to make smaller pieces.  Added a chopped onion for extra yumminess.  Agree with comment to lessen the olive oil.  Turned oven on 'broil' at the end to get the desired browning. Served to out-of-town guests and we all loved it.  They asked for the recipe.  Will have this again soon.

This was a super meal ... very quick and easy.  I added 2 bone in, skin on chicken breasts along with the thighs.  I also added the fresh chopped herbs, plus 1 1/2 teaspoons of fresh sage and seasonings to the oil, then marinated the chicken for a couple of hours.  I did not baste the chicken and the skin still came out very crisp.  I sprinkled a bit of kosher salt on everything as it came out of the oven.  Everyone loved it, picked the bones and licked their fingers!  This recipe will get prepared many times over!

This recipe is quick and easy and so delicious.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and the leftover chicken made very tasty sliced chicken sandwiches the next day.

nice one-dish dinner!  Doubled the fresh herbs, used only 6 thighs and it filled a 9x13 casserole dish.  would add a little seasoned salt next time.  Also switched oven to convection for the last 10 minutes to help crisp it a bit.  Very delicious and quite easy.  thanks for the recipe.

This was so delicious, no one had any idea it was so quick and easy.  I plussed up the herbs a bit and added about half of the rosemary, oregano and garlic powder to the bowl while I was tossing the chicken and potatoes with the EVOO and then sprinkled the rest on top.  The fresh herbs were great but I will try it with dried herbs too as I don't always have fresh herbs on hand.  Watch the cooking time; mine was done in about 40 minutes.

I rarely give five stars, but this was too tasty and too easy to deserve anything less! I used skinless boneless thighs; added lemon juice and real garlic, as suggested; and the fresh oregano was so delicious I consider it essential. Lots of salt and pepper, a sprinkle of paprika for colour, and this was a darned fine meal. Significant other loved it, too!

This is an excellent dish for a busy day.  Tasty and doesn't take a lot of prep time.  Note:  Being a lazy (and cheap) cook, I place the chicken and potatoes into a saved empty bread bag, Pour in the oil, toss a bit, add the herbs, toss a bit more, and put them on a large baking sheet with sides.  Then I toss the bag! No bowl to wash!

This recipe is one of the simplest recipes I've ever run across. But I am giving it four stars only because I made a few changes. I scaled down the recipe to only 1 serving for me alone. Instead of using chicken thighs I chopped a breast in bite sized cubes and chopped up enough potatoes to go with. I didn't have any dried herbs on hand separately as I hardly cook with them but I had pizza seasoning which has a mixture of oregano, rosemary, thyme, basil, sage and marjoram. I used the recommended amount of garlic salt and I used a bit less olive oil because of some of the reviews I read. After coating the chicken and potato in the oils and seasonings I sprinkled about a tablespoon of breadcrumbs over the top and let it bake. Boy did it come out smelling wonderful! The chicken and potatoes were so soft and delicious. I had also pre-marinated my chicken as well so the flavour really got baked into the meat. I would make this recipe again in a heartbeat.

Delicious. It took about 5 mins to throw together and tasted fabulous. I pretty much tripled the rosemary and oregano and used minced garlic rather than powder. I also only used 1/4 c EVOO and that was probably more than enough...the chicken put off enough oil to baste. I placed under the broiler for about 5 minutes and then YUM!!!

The only thing I would do different is add some dried minced onion or top with sliced onions or even bake it with whole onions.
Thanks for an awesome recipe. The house smelled fantastic while it was cooking.

This was really tasty although i did make a few changes but just on the cooking side. I put the potatoes in the oven first for 15 minutes before the chicken. I did cook them on a cookie sheet with a cooling rack. Then added the chicken. I was worried about drying but over all they potatoes were crunchy and the chicken did not dry out. We are having this again and will cook the same way.

The potatoes didn't come out crispy at all. In fact, I had to drain almost 2 cups of liquid out of the casserole dish. Maybe it was because I used regular chicken thighs but I am sorry my family and I didn't like this dish.

This meal is very quick and easy to prepare.  With loads of flavor.  You can cut way back on the olive oil for a more figure friendly version.

This was OK.  I made it with chicken breast, as I prefer it to thigh meat.  Chicken didn't have a lot of flavor.  Potatoes came up nice and crispy though!

Hate to be the naysayer, but we didn't like this very much.  I followed it exactly, but nothing got crispy.  The flavor was fine, but it seemed greasy and I would have liked some real crisp to the chicken skin and potatoes.  I even cooked it 15 minutes extra at 400* in an attempt to get it there. I'm open to ideas, though, because it was really easy to make at least!

I loved this recipe! I found it very flavourful. I added onion powder and paprika as well and used 1/2 of the oil called for. I also used skinless thighs and they still turned out perfect!

This is exceptionally good!  The only thing that I did differently was season both sides of the chicken.  For those of you using chicken breasts you are missing out!  I trimmed all the fat off of the thighs and they still made this wonderful juice that definitely added to the favor!!!!!

I would suggest hand tossing the potatoes separately and THEN separately and gently, tossing or rubbing the chicken thighs in the oil/herbs.

Delicious! I used skinless thighs, cutting off any additional fat. I cut the olive oil to 1/4 cup and felt that was plenty. I used fresh rosemary (worth it as others have said), dried oregano, and minced 5 small pieces of garlic (fresh garlic is a must!). The whole family loved it. Will definitely be making this again!

This was a great way to use our fresh rosemary and two kinds of oregano from our herb garden. The only change I made was to mince up a clove of garlic, in place of the garlic powder. Next time, I'll cut back a bit on the olive oil. Great taste !

I really liked this recipe because it called for simple ingredients that I pretty much always have on hand. I also loved how quick this was to prepare and how quick it was to clean. 

I did make a couple of changes based on the comments and made one change based on personal preference. 

Instead of garlic powder, I used fresh garlic (about 2-3 cloves for two thighs and two potatoes), dried herbs as I didn't have fresh, pepper, and onion salt instead of normal salt. I feel using onion salt really added another dimension to the flavor, which I was hoping for since some reviewers said this was bland. I dumped everything into a plastic bag, made sure everything was coated evenly and let it sit in the fridge for a bit. 

After the oven was pre-heated, I took the potatoes out of the bag and onto the cookie sheet where I seasoned them just a little more. I then cooked them by themselves for about 10 minutes. I noticed during that time that some stuff was already burning, so I ended up reducing my temperature from 375 degrees to 350, and let me tell you...It's a good thing I did that!

After the 10 minutes, I added the chicken to the cookie sheet, also adding a little more seasoning before putting everything in the oven. 

Even using a lower heat, my chicken came out just slightly dry, but that could be my fault. I still liked it. The potatoes, however, came out perfectly! I loved them. I had this along with a green salad for a very easy low-frills dinner. I will make this again!

We love this!!! I use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and dried oregano. I put it all in a big bowl, and toss so that the chicken, taters and seasonings coat it all evenly. Then I sprinkle kosher salt and ground pepper on top after placing in baking pan. My daughter's favorite chicken dish, hands down!

VERY GOOD AND CRISPY!  To make this into a one dish meal, I added baby carrots and cut the potatoes into chunks.  The timing was perfect.  The chicken was crispy and the potatoes and carrots were perfectly seasoned.  I didn't have fresh herbs so I had to use dried.  I look forward to making this when my herb garden is in full swing.  Thank you Sandy Witek for such a fabulous recipe!

This was pretty good. Someone should mention to get it crispy, place the chicken skin side up. I spread mine in the pan like the recipe said (not thinking) and baked. When I went to baste I realized it was not crispy but soggy. So I flipped the chicken pieces skin side up and finished baking and basting. Then for the wanted crisp I broiled under low for a few minutes. I added sliced onions and it had some great flavor. Next time I will add fresh garlic and maybe a splash of lemon juice. The chicken came out very tender and not dry at all. Not to mention how wonderful my house smelled.

As is this is not a great recipe. The chicken was a bit bland.  The big problem was the potatoes. They were no where near done in the allotted cooking time.

In a word - de-frickin'-licious!  I made the recipe exactly as described, and I wouldn't change a thing!  My fiance and I were obsessed!  So simple yet incredibly tasty. The potatoes were perfect!  And the house smelled so cozy after it was done  :)  Two thumbs up!  This is definitely going into my recipe box...

Followed recipe except used boneless, skinless thighs. Didn't need all the oil to coat the pieces. Since some were saying the chicken dries out, I laid a sheet of foil over the dish for the first 30 minutes. Delicious! Will definitely make again.

Spectacular!!! And I didn't even had the fresh herbs - used dried. I have to say, I marinated the chicken first with the herbs you said, and olive oil. Like many people, I backed the potatoes for 20-25 minutes prior to adding the marinated chicken. Just then I added fresh garlic all over and baked! Fantastic!!!!

For those who haven't tried it, grow your own rosemary. If I, with two black thumbs, can grow it, anyone can!!! It will thrive year-round, and makes such a difference in recipes. Just be sure it's very finely chopped when you use it in a baked dish. I love baking chicken and spuds together, and this is a good basic recipe that would be so adaptable to personal taste and choice.

I made it without potatoes, so I halved the oil. Simple and delicious! I used garlic salt, instead of garlic powder+salt.

I've made this twice, and the first time was good, but the second time where I used the Yukon golds like someone here suggested and basted the chicken at the 45 minute mark...oh wow. This dinner just makes me happy. Really easy, really tasty, and kinda fancy looking :)

Excellent! Loved the combination of flavours.  I used fresh rosemary and dried oregano (that's all I had) and  boneless skinless chicken breasts (large ones - cut in 1/3s) and removed them after about 35 mins, then let the potatoes crisp up until the one hour mark.  The chicken was moist, not too dry but it tasted fantastic.

I thought this was pretty good, but my kids and fiance' refused to touch it. It lacks color to make the presentation appetizing to children's taste, and they usually LOVE anything Rosemary!

I even made Asparagus on the side to add some color. The kids ate the Asparagus and left the rest! My fiance' ate the potatoes, but said the chicken only had flavor on the outside, was boring on the inside.

I cooked the chicken for only 40 minutes, and it turned out moist and soft instead of crisp and dry, which is what I was going for in hoping the kids would like it.

Won't be doing this one again.

This recipe is yummy.  I made a few changes to reduce the calorie count a bit.  I used skinless boneless chicken breasts instead of the chicken thighs so the chicken wasn't crispy but it was moist and delicious! My family loves it!

SO easy and SO delicious! It was a HUGE hit with my husband - I love how it requires so few ingredients that are all pantry staples, yet it comes out tasting gourmet, like it required hours of work! I'd say this is the best chicken thigh recipe I've ever found. My husband is requesting it again tonight! (And it sure makes it easy when we've got a huge rosemary bush out front LOL!)

it was good but not great. i followed some other reviews and cooked my potatoes in for the first 30 min. and the chicken for the last 30 min. i also used tenders and mushrooms. well i think i might of done something wrong but i almost started a grease fire at 375 so i reduced the heat to 350 and layed tinfoil over the pan. and another thing, my chicken did not come out crispy at all. and my potatoes were very hard still, they could have cooked another 20 mins. i liked the outcome but i think i will keep looking.

I used 4 boneless chicken breasts cut in half since I don't favor dark meat.  I also used 1/3 dried herbs (probably one of the few who prefer dried).  I only cut the oil back a bit.  Really easy - I like things that I can just dump all in a pan, with little prep, throw in the oven and forget it.  I turned everything over after 30 minutes, and it did not take an hour for everything to be done (tho I forget how long it was).  The wedges weren't crispy like French fries, but that's actually a good thing cause if they aren't actual deep-fried regular fries, I prefer something a bit softer.  (In fact, my biggest fear about this recipe was chunks of potatoes getting too crisp.)  Pretty good and extra points for being fairly easy.

Just made this tonight and it was a hit with the family. I baked it covered loosely with foil for the first 45 minutes and then removed it for browning the rest of the time, basting the last 15-20 min. The red potatoes caramelized nicely and the chicken was moist and delicious. I will be making this again - thank you!

I made this when I was low on groceries because the ingredients are so simple. I imagine it would be a lot better with fresh herbs but it had great flavor. I put the chicken in half way through (chicken breast cut in half)they were very moist but the potatoes were pretty dry.

This was really tasty.  I didn't have fresh herbs so I used dried.  I would give it 5 stars, but it did turn out greasy, and I didn't use all that much oil.  Flavor was great and it turned out really crispy.

This came out really good - I used russet potatoes and cut them into rather large chunks.  I also added some carrots, also cut in large chunks, so the veggies would not be overcooked.  I also did not chop the rosemary, but left about three sprigs whole to flavor the chicken and vegetables.

Made this for my husband and father.  They loved it!  I had one package of skinless boneless thighs and one package with bone and skin.  The ones with the bone in and skin on were definitely more flavorful and juicy.  We'll be having this again for sure!

Made this for dinner last night when my M-I-L came for dinner.  It was a hit, and the kitchen smelled wonderful!  I also used chicken breast since that is what I had on hand, added garlic, and I used more than the called for amount of fresh rosemary.  Thanks for the recipe!

Nothing special, but tasted good. I also did not find the potatoes to be too crispy like the recipe states.

I did this tonite using Trader Joe's skinless, boneless, chicken thighs and fresh thyme and oregano; didn't have rosemary. Covered thighs and potato wedges in olive oil, garlic powder and the herbs on a lipped cookie sheet, then put a pat of butter on both ends of the row of chicken (little trick I picked up for the Juicy Roasted Chicken recipe on this site). Who knows if it did anything but oh my goddd, the chicken sure tasted tender and juicy!!! And the potatoes were amazing, couldn't stop eating them. Neither were crispy but that's okay, everything was delicious. Thank you Sandy!!!

This turned out wonderfully.  It's one of my new favorite recipes because it's so simple and turns out so well.  I've also tried this with sweet potatoes instead of new potatoes (obviously cut into more than quarters to get the same size) and I actually liked it better.

This was awesome and so easy. My daughter loved the chicken but didn't care for the potatoes. But since she does not like potatoes anyways I didn't count her vote. I used chicken breast and dried herbs since that was what I had and fresh garlic. I also added a little lemon juice. It was so good!!

I prepared this dish exactly as directed and also followed other reviews that said to pour off the liquid half way thru the baking cycle. While the flavor of the fresh herbs are amazing - - the dish as a whole was extreamly greasy. Next time I will use whole chicken breast and cut the olive oil in half. Maybe even an olive oil cooking spray over the potatoes and just a splash of lemon with the herbs on the meat.

This was the worst dish that I had ever tasted, it had no flavor, and I know I did everything to the recipe exactly as I am a cook by hobby. I would not reccomend this dish to anyone, I am sorry to be truthful...

Not bad.  Used fresh garlic (alot) instead of powdered.  At the end, I Took out the chicken and the pan juices and placed the potatoes on a baking sheet in oven to crisp them up while I made a gravy with the pan juices.  Used Kosher salt.  Easy to prepare; tastes good.

I used chicken pounded chicken breasts, added a cup of baby carrots, a shake or two of ginger, 1/4 tsp. capers and about 4 TBSP lemon juice in place of some of the oil. YUM!! I also used regular white potatoes and cut them into quarters. I only baked it for about 35 minutes-everything was done. Easy and good!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  The only suggestions I have are to use real garlic and to place the potatoes and chicken thighs on a rack inside the pan if you really want a crispy skin on them.

This was a great recipe and really easy to make.  I couldn't find fresh rosemary so just used some dried that I had and it was still pretty good.  My husband loved it, and several people at work asked for the recipe when I heated the leftovers up for lunch the next day. Definitely will make this again.

Great, moist, flacorful chicken. Used lots of fresh rosemary, small yukon gold tomatoes that I put in 25 min before the chicken, and I squeezed a lemon over all of it before cooking. Super yummy, easy, and delish. Served to company and it was awesome

Excellent. The only changes I made was to sprinkle lemon juice over chicken and I used fresh garlic. Fresh rosemary is a must. The potatoes where very good and crispy.

Was almost elegant but so simple! The only thing is I think I will use chicken breasts next time. I also made some corn on the cob for a side veggie. Kids, DH and brother all liked it. I brought the leftovers for lunch but think I would have preferred those chicken breasts instead. But thanks for the easy dinner recipe!

My family loved it!  I didn't have red potatoes so quartered small baking potatoes and they were delish!  I will try red potatoes next time (my family loves them as well).  I didn't measure the olive oil just used enough to coat.  My family doesn't care for oregano so didn't add it but felt the dish is flavorful without it.  Thank you Sandy for a wonderful and easy dinner!  Clean up was a breeze!

If you like the taste of rosemary and don't like the taste of chicken, this recipe is for you! I suggest cutting the rosemary back to no more than a teaspoon and increasing the oven temp. to 400 if you want your chicken done in an hour and your potatoes sorta crispy, then you will have a mediocre dish.

Great idea with the potatoes! I made a version of this in New Mexico where we have rosemary bushes growing in our yard. I oiled large baking pan, sprinkled in garlic salt, pepper, snipped rosemary, then added 4 chicken breasts, covered with sliced onion, rosemary sprigs, fresh garlic slices, then tomato slices, drizzled with olive oil & refrigerated 2 hrs. Bake 425 covered 25 min, then uncovered 15 min. I served with basmati rice cooked with chicken broth and diced onion  and green beans. Chicken was delicious and moist.  We loved it. Next time I'll add the potatoes as suggested.

Maybe it was due to varying oven temps but mine didn't come out crispy at all.  Everything was still tasty & thoroughly cooked but there was WAY too much oil.  Next time, I'm going to try halving the oil & cooking it at 400.  But it is good enough to try again!

This was good...especially the potatoes!  Only wish I had made more of them!  The chicken was actually a tad dry, so I may adjust temp next time...? Not sure...any suggestions, because I would really like to make this again, yet still be able to retain the chicken's juicyness! email: bobsbestgirl@hotmail.com - THANKS! Overall, a great flavor!

Easy to prepare and delicious.  As other reviewers have remarked, I used chicken breasts and only baked them for 30 minutes.  I added some cherry tomatoes sliced in half, which gave the dish more flavor, nutrition and color.  I definitely recommend the addition.

Delicious!!!  So easy to make too.  Like others I also squeezed a bit of lemon juice over the chicken and threw a couple shallots of fresh garlic (on top of the garlic powder).  The potatoes were amazing.  I was afraid the chicken would be bland but it was jucilious!

Yum!  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts so I put the potatoes in first for 30 min then moved them to a lower shelf and added the chicken on a seperate sheet to the top shelf for another 30 min.  I also drained the liquids from the chicken after 15 min.  The fresh rosemary is soo fragrant!  My potatoes were crispy - perfect!

This was by far the best chicken i've ever made according to by boyfriend!  I used a little dry Italian salad dressing along with the other ingredients for a marinade.  Baked 6 chicken thighs at 375 for a about 40 minutes (turned and basted), and then broiled it in the last few minutes to give the skin on it a crunch.  I basted it and watched it broil so it wouldn't burn...and it worked!  Juicy flavorful chicken with crunchy skin!  We enjoyed it with steak fries and a salad.  He said it's one of the top 5 dishes I've made!  :-)

This was a good, average dish.  In fairness, I did not have fresh herbs so used dried which undoubtedly affected the taste. There was a lot of salt and pepper added by individuals at the table.  Also, the potatoes did not crisp up.  Next time I will use fresh herbs and try others' suggestions regarding drying the potatoes, putting spices under the skin, draining the liquid halfway through the baking time, etc.

Yummy! I made with chicken breast following another posters suggestion of cooking the potatoes for 30 min at 375 and then adding the chicken for an additional 30 min. I would definently suggest using fresh rosemary. Also if you really like a little kick add Tony Chacheres cajun seasoning.

I thought it had really good flavour. I love rosemary with chicken and if you add your own spices (seasoned salt etc)  it doesn't come out bland like others stated. Mine was not crispy but, that was my fault I poured the whole olive oil over the entire dish with the spices and baked it. I will make again but, I will follow the directions better.

This was delicious!  I used chicken breasts instead of thighs so I put the potatoes in first and then added the chicken breasts the last 30 minutes of cooking.  It came out wonderful.  I will be making this again.

Ok - Let me just say that my six-year-old daughter who eats like a hummingbird was shoving the chicken in her mouth with two hands.  She and my son (who's four) had seconds.   With a full mouth, my daughter says, "This chicken is REALLY good, Mommy.  Can we have it again tomorrow?"  An hour later, she comes over and tells me how good it was again.  I think I'll be putting this one into my rotation!  The only thing I did differently was add some cherry tomatoes which were getting a little over-ripe for salads.  Thanks for this recipe!

Tender, juicy and oh, so easy chicken! Taters are delicious, too! Unfortunately I didn't have fresh rosemary so I used dry. The chicken skin came out so crispy (which we don't eat) without basting at the end. Will do this one again!!

This dish was super easy to make and tasted like pure comfort food.  I used a mortal and pestle to crush the dried rosemary, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper.  (I added a drizzle of olive oil to help with the consistency of the herb mixture.)  This smelled SOOOO good while cooking - - like a whole roasted chicken. Be sure to cut the potatoes small so they get fork tender.  DELICIOUS!!!

I actually marinated the chicken and potatoes for a few hours. Used fresh garlic cloves and yukon gold potatoes. The dish smelled so good cooking, but the seasoning came out light on both chicken and potatoes. The chicken was fall of the bone moist though. Would make again, but add more seasoning for a fuller taste.

This was very good, I used boneless thighs.  Next time I will add onion and crushed garlic for a bit more flavor.  Very quick and perfect for a week night.  I mixed the potatoes, spices, chicken and olive oil in the bowl together.  Didn't use the full amount of olive oil.  Also, I did not baste the last 15 minutes and it still had plenty of flavor.

Super simple. Dinner was ready to go in the oven in a matter of minutes. I cut the oil WAY back, I think I only used a tablespoon or so. I plan on pairing it with a macaroni salad.

This chicken was WONDERFUL!  I cooked it a bit longer b/c I like my skin crispy.  Also, I marinated the chicken in the herbs and 1/2 the oil (never added the other 1/2) for a few hours.  I started with the chicken and potatoes in the same dish, but ended up taking the chicken out b/c the potatoes weren't browning.  I do recommend starting them together so that the chicken flavor gets onto the potatoes (remove about 1/2 way through cooking).

This was grea! I had been making oven fried potatos this way for years but to add the chicken makes it tate even better and it is easier. I did have to pour off some of the fat and cooked it for 15 min longer. I also omitted the oregano because I'm not a big fan.

I thought that this recipe was very good!  I cut my potatoes into eighths so they would be crispier and they were wonderful!  The rosemary added a nice flavor.

I love how easy this recipe is! With 2 small kids, I'm always needing something that takes little preparation time. The potatoes are absolutely awesome! My husband raved about them. I used boneless, skinless thighs and they ended up getting a bit dried out (but I also cooked longer than recommended) so this time I will try baking the potatoes for a bit and then adding the chicken. Will definitely use again - thanks for sharing!

The flavor was great but neither the fries or the chicken turned out crispy. After cooking for 1 hour I drained off all the liquid in the pan and continued cooking for another 1/2 hour, still soggy. I finally transferred the fries to a different pan and raised the temperature to 400. They came out a little crisper but not much. This really does have potential and I will make again. I think I will keep the fries separate after the initial mixing and see if that helps.

Mmm. Oven fried chicken.  Didn't have reds, so just used some russets.  Only negative was that the potatoes were a little greasy.

This recipe is so easy and quite tasty.  The thighs are so moist.  As suggested by others I cut the potatoes in thinner wedges.  I also used boneless thighs and cooked on convection bake so it was done in about 35 minutes and the convection makes it all a little more crispy.  This is a definite keeper.

It's very simple, yet super good!  I made it exactly as described, but I did use white meat chicken taking the suggestion of others to bake the potatoes for half an hour first, then adding the thin slices of chicken breast.  For the future, I'll bake the potatoes for 40 minutes, then stir  or flip the potatoes for even browning and add the chicken breast for 20-25 more minutes.  I'd do it as is for chicken thighs, but I wanted to have a leaner meat for our current dietary plan.  It was superb and would have been perfect with dark meat chicken just as written!  My whole family raved about it and wants me to add it to our regular meal menu once every couple of weeks.  Thank you!  I didn't exactly measure anything, so I think this is hard to mess up, just toss chicken and potato wedges with seasoning, salt, oil, and herbs.  The potatoes get crispy, the chicken is amazing, and the whole thing is well balanced.  I added steamed veggies, but any side or salad of veggies goes well.  It's perfect for a busy mom that wants the oven to do more work than her!

Easy, delicious!  Didn't  need ketchup either.  What more could anyone want? I made it exactly as stated ingredients wise, but once I coated the chick and potatoes with the olive oil , I sprinkled the rest of the ingredients on a little at a time and stirred until everything was well coated.

Tasty and quick. I used garlic infused olive oil and that gave it a terrific flavor.

Love this recipe!  I make it all the time.  Broil for a minute or two at the end for extra crispiness.

I just noticed I have made this recipe before but then again forgot to put a review. I must say that it is a good recipe. This time I just played a bit with the ingredients. I did use the same herbs but dried. Only had 6 boneless thighs and used 4 yukon gold potatoes as I did not have red ones. Now, I used a bit of onion powder as I did not have garlic powder,but pressed one garlic clove and sprinkled a few unpeeled garlic cloves here and there. Followed the recipe as usual and well it was as good as usual. Since I made the recipe in advance, I covered it in aluminum foil and let it stand in the warm oven. I do not usually do this with recipes because despite covering things it may dry out the food,but OMG! What a surprise when I served the chicken it was so golden,fragant, and moist! It was not that golden when I finished baking it despite the 5 minutes of broiler. My husband loved it and I did too. I will try it next time with chicken breasts to see the outcome. For those who say this recipe is bland, I highly recommend to add the unpeeled garlic cloves and one pressed garlic. They will give more flavor to the entire recipe more than the powdered garlic.

Not so crispy.  The oven temp is too low for that.  Still, it came out nicely and was widely enjoyed.  Thank you for a no-fuss decent dinner.

I totally agree with the ladies who requested that Major recipe changes that change the recipe totally should be posted as new recipes.  The paragraph long NEW recipes were too hard to even read, much less use it as a recipe.

My Review:  I cooked it as posted with fresh Rosemary from my huge bush in the flower bed (we planted it and forgot it and it is now huge 4 years later.) Also used fresh Oregeno from the bed. Fresh herbs have a bigger flavor than dried, dried needs more than fresh.   I did use more of each and Roasted garlic (From Penzeys), because we love these flavors, but made no additions to the Recipe.

This is absolutely delicious! For reviewers who commented that it isn't crispy, I am guessing that you aren't opting to baste in the last 15-20 minutes. I basted 3 times and if makes a huge difference. Served this with a kale, apple, pecan and feta salad.

Came out very moist and delicious. I prefer sweet potatos and made a little herb mayo on the side. Did put it under the broiler for an additional 5 minutes  So easy, a definite make again and go to meal. Next time will use just half the olive oil.

This was delicious. The only thing I changed was to mix the spices and herbs with the oil in a large bowl, added the chicken and potatoes and then transferred to a baking dish. This method gave me a more even distribution of flavours.

This recipe is very delicious and easy to put together.  I never really liked chicken thighs, but this recipe has changed me!  Definitely use fresh rosemary and fresh, minced garlic.  The aroma is heavenly!  And, the leftovers (if there are any) reheat beautifully.

This chicken was scrumptious!  It filled the house with fabulous scents and tasted divine.  The only thing I did differently was to cook the potatoes in a separate dish.  We will make this again and again, I'm sure.  Thanks for posting!

lately I'm trying to cook for my husband who sometimes works till midnight and comes home REALLY, REALLY hungry!!! He really doesn't like Rosemary that much so I only put a little in it. And then he came home and asked if he could tweak it a little and I told him to go ahead. So he added a few squirts of Lemon Juice before putting it in the oven.  This was SO EASY and he LOVED IT!!! It tasted like a dish someone who cooks all the time would make!!! I'll DEFINITELY make it again!!! ;)

So yummy. I have just started making the potatoes only with whatever meat we cook up on the grill at least 3x per week. So yummy. The rosemary is surprisingly delicious with it! I wouldn't change a thing.

I thought this was very good because I really like rosemary. I followed the directions exactly. Next time I will follow another reviewer's suggestion to start the potatoes earlier. My potatoes weren't quite "done" enough when the chicken was finished. It was still good and I will make it again with the noted modifications.

These were the best chicken thighs I've ever made.  And it was so easy!  I added onion powder and a little paprika.  I didn't measure anything, just eye-balled it.  I removed the chicken after about 45 min (they were done), and let the potatoes cook 1 hour.  Next time I will let the potatoes cook for 15 minutes before adding the chicken to the pan.  My chicken was not crispy, but it was still delicious.

I agree with RedWings, if your going to change the recipe, don't give it a low rating and then say what you changed. Come on people. It's not hard to submit your own recipe stop trying to change others. My motto is to try the recipe once, as it is written, THEN I change it to fit my tastes. 
This is a good one and will fix it again tonight.

I have been making this for years! It is my "go to" simple dinner. The one thing I do differently is I use garlic cloves in their skin, no need to peel since they roast in the skin and are soooooo good when you squeeze them out! Just throw about 5 or 6 around the chicken and potatoes. And I sometimes add lemon chunks. It is a must to use bone in thighs, they crisp up but still stay moist. And fresh rosemary too. I can put this together in less than 5 minutes but the results are much more impressive!

This was something new for my family and we loved it. I used chicken breast and cooked separately and used extra 15 minutes after draining water to crisp the chicken and browned it a bit. Very tasty!

YES!  I just absolutely love this recipe and so does everyone I've either served it to or given the recipe to.  I'm not a fan of chicken thighs, but this quick and easy recipe is super delicious.  Tinkerbell

Fabulous recipe!
I used thighs and drumsticks as well as fresh garlic.  Came out nice and crispy from oven. We also tried grilling (indirect heat) was tasty but didn't crisp up like in oven.  Even my picky 10 year old loved it!

I doubled the fresh herbs per other reviewers suggestions and it was very, very flavorful and delish! The chicken nor the potatoes were crispy, although that could be because I didn't bake everything in a single layer. I will make this again and cut down on the olive oil.

AL PRESTO!  It's so easy and smells and tastes like you worked on it for hours.  I've tried SO many other ckn recipes on this site and still, this is my favorite for ease, crispiness and flavor.  Use thighs - they're moist.  (If you use chicken breasts - suggest you brine them or marinade in buttermilk overnight - they need all the moisture they can get).  NOTE:  Add vegetables the last 30 minutes, such as broccoli, asparagus and you have an easy, super tasty meal for the whole family to enjoy.  Oh, have you tried this using sweet potatoes instead?  Yummy too :-)

'Made two batches of the oil mixture (using 1/4c oil & dried spices).  One used for the potatoes & baked them 30 minutes.  Another batch, same way, let the thighs sit in during that half hour.  Added them to the pan & baked.  They didn't crisp too much, but the potatoes did & were pretty good.  I liked them more than the chicken.  'Not a re-do for me, but I can always use leftover chicken.  Brunswick stew sounds good!

Chicken night was a success thanks to this recipe. The other day I bought a lovely pack of boneless, skinless chicken thighs from Trader Joes and I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do with them. Then I remembered that I had saved this recipe a long time ago and never made it. Luckily I had everything needed on hand. I made as directed with no changes and it was delicious. So simple, very flavorful, and because it was all done in the one dish, easy to clean up. We all loved this one.

I was totally blindsided by this recipe ....... I make potatoes all the time this way (yummy) and thought, OK, what a nice addition of chicken thighs.  Wrong.  Grease, fat, hardly crispy, ETC., and I downward adjusted the amount of olive oil.

While the chicken was flavorful, I thought there was way too much olive oil. The skin already has a fair amount of fat and didn't really need any oil, much less half a cup. It might be different if you're using boneless/skinless anything, but I had skin-on thighs. It took longer to cook than the recipe stated, but again, I had bigger pieces.

I make this nearly every other week.  It is easy to assemble; sometimes I put it together a couple hours in advance and keep it cool. I can then put it in and entertain guests, work on other things in the kitchen or play with my daughter.  I check on it once with 15 min to go and it makes a delicious meal.  Sometimes I add some cauliflower to change it up.

Used 4 boneless skinless thighs but skin on would have made it more crispy.  1/4 cup olive oil, 1T fresh rosemary, 1tsp dried oregano, 1 heaping tsp minced garlic, 1/2 tsp. lemon pepper, grind salt on top. Used 4 big red potatoes.  To cook boneless thighs: on large cookie sheet, cook potatoes for 15 mins then add chicken for 30 mins. Take out chicken and let sit covered for 10 mins. Drain oil from potatoes, stir, and cont cooking for 10 mins. Yummy!

This has been my new EASIEST favorite DELICIOUS recipe!!!  My son loves it (and thats saying alot) and so does everyone else.  Everything is perfectly cooked and tastes absolutley delicious.  I have added different ingredients like beets and carrots.  After the oil is drizzeled I, sometimes,  bread the chicken lightly with Italian bread crumbs and it comes out tasting just like fried chicken!  I have made this recipe like suggested then started to play a little :)  YUMMY!!!!!!!!!

Super delicious and easy to make! I made a half-recipe of this tonight for my family--added a slightly larger amount of spice (because my family loves spices) and used 2 chicken breasts instead of thighs, since that's what I had. I cut each breast into three pieces to make it easier to portion out evenly between myself and my parents.

The only problem I had with this is that the chicken felt a little dryer than I typically like. I'm not sure if it's because I cut the chicken into smaller pieces, but it might be. I think I might experiment with how long I cook the chicken next time, to see if I can find a way to make it a little bit more moist. I did like how crispy both it and the potatoes came out, though, so I overall recommend this if you're wanting something easy to make that's healthier than fast food!

Great recipe!! Using fresh herbs made a huge difference. This is the perfect meal to make for a house full of guests....just because the smell would entice anyone & it's so simple & kid friendly. Good call on the ketchup. Can't wait to make it again.

This is one of our regulars.  We love to use fresh herbs from the garden.  I replace the oregano with fresh basil.  I slice the potatoes so they come out crispier and sometimes add carrots to the mixture.

A-ma-zing! This got rave reviews at our house. The flavour was superb. I had roasted vegetables for vegetable broth and used the same roasting pan. Cut back a little on the oil and added fresh garlic. Melt in your mouth and soooo easy. Thanks for a great recipe!

Followed the recipe close enough - other than 1/3 cup only of oil, adding extra rosemary, a bit of fresh thyme & seasoning everything with some shakes of Old Bay...Layed it all out on a cookie sheet (touching each other, not too spread out) & basted during the last 20 minutes. The chicken skin wwas perfectly crispy & the meat wasn't dry at all, just needed even more seasoning for my taste. The potatoes were slightly crispy & puffed on the outside & moist & tender on the inside - yum! Next time I'll add more spices & allow the chicken to marinate in the fridge prior to baking. Definitely worth trying again & tweaking to my tastes!

Potatoes were pretty good but the chicken was slightly bland. With ketchup my daughter ate it.

this recipe came to my inbox.  this is really simple and is actually something I already make.  the only difference is that I usually use half a whole chicken.  I like the idea of using chicken thighs though.  the only other thing I do different is I don't think I have put oregano in the spice mix before.  but i can vouch for this being really good and easy.  if you like roast chicken you will love this.

Ended up making this 3 years after I first saved it to my recipe box because I had rosemary growing in my garden & it was delicious! I personally really dug the fries & my fiancee really dug the chicken but a win/win.

Very tasty.  I had to drain some of the juice - it just took too long to cook off.  I think it would have been even more flavorful I would have baked it longer.  Very good recipe.

This was SO awesome and super EASY! I used 4 bone-in skin-on chicken breasts, 6 red skinned potatoes the rosemary, garlic powder, & olive oil I also used fresh thyme instead of oregano and seasoned salt instead of just salt. Thought the potatoes might be overcooked but if you keep the fries on the bigger size they're perfect. The skin on the chicken is crispy and delicious. Will definitely make this again!

This recipe was very good and very easy. I had no trouble throwing this recipe together mid week. My whole family loved it even my picky 6 year old and 3 year old. I did add some fresh garlic and a little rosemary under the skin of the thighs. The skin turned out nice and crispy and the potatoes were perfectly done.

This was great, and an "EASY" family pleaser. My 13 month old is enjoying it now with italian green beans(a great side). I added some yellow onion and used fresh garlic but all in all a GREAT recipe!

Delicious! I used drums instead of thighs, and yukon golds instead of red potatoes. I also added some different seasonings to my tastes. But all in all, my favorite part of this was the potatoes! They were so delicious, and soaked up the flavor of the chicken wonderfully.   I will definitely be making this again! I also reviewed it here on my blog - http://www.indynikongal.com/2011/01/crispy-rosemary-chicken-and-potatoes/

This was ok.  It was lacking in flavor, and I even marinated overnight. I used fresh garlic and rosemary, dried oregano... I might try again, but add more seasonings, maybe some thyme

I took other reviewers advice and made a few adjustments. I pulled the skin back and put the herb and oil mixture under the skin. I also drained the pan and lightly basted in the last 15 minutes to crisp the skin. It was so simple and so good.

Very Good.  Only used 2 tbsps instead of 1/2 cup olive oil.  Does this really serve 6, that would be 1 1/3 thighs each?   Maybe I because I have 3 teenagers but that does not seem like enough meat.  Will definitely make again, with adding garlic, maybe carrots, more potatoes and more chicken thighs!

This is a great recipe for a starting point for any roasted chicken or other chicken parts.  I add some BBQ sauce to this and put it on the grill and it tastes great.  Seasonings are easy to change to your liking!  I don't like mixing the potatos in with the chicken and end up roasting them separately and I find it comes out better as the potatos and chicken come out crispier.

5 stars for ease of preparation, 3 stars for final result, so I gave this recipe 4 stars. My chicken (I used drumsticks) and potatoes did not get crispy at all. The flavor was really good, but we had to peel off the skin and remove the meat in order to eat it.

This was so easy and very delicious!  I used my convection oven and it came out so crispy. I will make this all the time.

This was incredible.  I didn't change much at all, other than adding mushrooms and carrots (it desperately lacked color) and squeezed some lemon over the top.  I've given the recipe to a couple of other people and they loved it as well.  This one is a keeper!!

I followed Kenna's June 15 suggestion and used chicken breasts cut in strips.  I put the chicken and potatoes in a bowl with the fresh rosemary and oregano and garlic powder.  I only used a 1/4 cup of olive oil.  I tossed everything together and used Kenna's cooking instructions.  Potatoes only for 1/2 hour, add the chicken and cook for the remaining 1/2 hour.  The whole family liked this.

Very good and very easy.  Be creative with your vegetables.  I added some yellow and red peppers and some diced onion.  I would suggest using more potatoes.  Also very good as a leftover!

First I would like to say the house smelled fantastic while the dish was cooking!!! Changes? I would throw the potatoes in the micro for 5 minutes to make sure they will get done along with the chicken. I used a whole chicked cut up rather than just thighs. This way, everyone gets to pick what they like best. Fresh herbs are a must. We have a great little herb garden and we'll make this dish often.

Made this last night for a party of five including myself and it was not enough.  Should have doubled it.  Everyone raved about it and asked for copies of the recipe. Followed the recipe exactly.  I used a baking sheet with sides & fresh herbs...just great.

I used both chicken thighs and breasts. I cut up the herbs and spices and put them in the oil and then marinated the chicken and vegtables(butternut squash, red potatoes, & mushrooms) overnight. I baked the vegtables for 25 mins and then put the chicken under them for the next 35 min. I served corn on the cob for the side.  We all liked this and I will fix again! Very good flavors!

Made this for some friends the other night and there was not a single plate that was not just about licked cleaned. I actually forgot to add garlic (which is rare as garlic is a staple in this family) so I cut a lemon in thin slices and layed one on top of each piece of chicken. It gave that perfect zest. I also marinated everything for about an hour before I put in the oven and drained all the oil at the end and baked for about 15 more min. mmmmm! Will definitley be making this again!

Wonderful.  I cannot imagine using dry, flavorless skinless breasts instead.  What a bore!  The point of food is "Flavor"!!

I found this to be flavorful and very easy to prepare. I used a large skinless breast pounded thin for two servings, along with fingerling potatoes. I also added 1/4 C. chicken stock and a good splash of Madeira wine for added liquid. Bastin near end of cooking is required.

I was very excited about this recipe but found it to be extremely bland :(  I followed the recipe exactly as written, and then again using some of the suggestions (putting the potatoes in longer, adding onions and mushrooms, etc).  I didn't find it to be crispy at all.  Just wasn't happy with it as the delicious dish I was expecting :(

Hi,  Made this dish today and we just LOVED it, I should mention that I had to subtitute the fresh rosemary with dried one and the garlic powder with minced garlic, also I used sliced chicken breasts and served it  with steamed asperagus.  I highly recommed this oh so easy to make dish that is sooo YUMMY and will most definately be a staple in our home.  Thank you so much!!!

I am making this tonight but I have never heard of marinating chicken in the same bag as potatoes.  Can someone please tell me if that is okay?  It sounds a bit odd to marinade anything with raw chicken.  Thank you.  (I am giving this 5 stars anticipating it will be delicious based on others reviews!)

We enjoyed this! It did not come out 'crispy', so I think next time I will make it on a large baking sheet instead of a roasting pan. And I may substitute the garlic powder for garlic salt. But overall, a very good, easy recipe!

This dish was delicious and super simple. I cubed some acorn squash and threw it in as well. Worked great and was a great addition to this dish. It really does get nice and crispy if you baste it the last 10 minutes.

This recipe is so so so so good! I wasn't sure if the rosemary would be too overpowering for the picky husband, but he loved it too! I think I could have cooked the potatoes a little longer, but the chicken was perfect. I think I will start the potatoes for 15 minutes and then add the chicken and cook for another 60 mins. It was so easy and delicious that this will be a regular in the dinner rotation. I am going to try it with chicken breats next time! Thanks for this delicious recipe!!

Great! I used boneless chicken thighs, so had to reduce the baking time accordingly. I put the potatoes into the oven first for 30 minutes, then added the chicken, baked 20 minutes, and broiled for 10. End product was moist and delicious.

I used fresh herbs and I think that really helped make a difference.  I accidentally used a 1/2 Tbsp instead of 1 Tbsp though, so next time I will add more seasoning.

This was very tasty. I was worried the chicken would dry out because my oven is fan forced, I covered it for the first 15 minutes and then cooked 45 mins uncovered. It didn't dry out completely, but it wasn't as moist as it should have been.  Next time I'll do 30 mins covered and then 30 mins uncovered - then turn on the broiler to crisp it a little more. But the flavours were good and the potato wedges were great.

The steak fries are wonderful! I often make just the fries with Johnny's seasoning salt.

Loved this chicken! I did a different potato dish, so I can't vouch for the fries. I combined the rosemary, four cloves pressed garlic, pepper, dried parsley and some minced onion in a bowl and poured some olive oil over it. I used a spoon and pastry brush to season under the skin and on both sides. Baked beautifully, not quite crispy but moist and flavorful. This will definitely be a repeat dish!!

This was pretty good. It didn't exactly get crispy, but was a nice easy weeknight meal. I used chicken legs and thighs because thats what I had, and I added a little fresh garlic. Thanks for an easy recipe that is easy to build on.

This had great flavor but my potatoes and chicken were not crispy after 1 hour.  I increased the heat to 425F for an additional 15 minutes.  Next time I will start at a higher heat.  I like crispy chicken.

This was exceptional.  My house smelled incredable.  A very fancy dinner easily made.  The fresh rosemary definately made the meal.  I served this with broccoli rabe and crescent rolls.  My 12 year old loved it and my husband ate the golden crispy skin which he never eats.  I am filing this one away for company.

If you want a dish that will make your house smell like its worth coming home for dinner, this is it.   I chopped garlic and added lemon zest and stuffed under the skin, that's the only thing I did differently.  Next time, I think I will marinate the thighs for more flavor.  I also added a few frozen pearl onions.  My fries didn't get that crisp, but it was all gone in the end.  Thanks for the recipe!

I normally don't eat chicken thighs but they are so cheap these days. This was good and super easy. I marinated the chicken for about an hour before baking. I also put some of the spices under the skin . It came out very moist and yummy. Will try again.

This was decent but not outstanding.  If I had extra thighs with nothing to do with them, I will make this again.  It's definitely not a go-to recipe.

Used two pans and started the potatoes 20 minutes before the chicken.  Only had Yukon Gold potates so peeled them and sliced them into wedges.  Fresh rosemary & garlic but dried oregano.  Great family meal for mid-week.  Thank you!

EH, it was just ok. I thought the chicken was kind of bland, but it was moist.
The fries were just ok. Probably won't make again.

It was a keeper in my house.  I used only dried herbs and used Russet potaoes.  I was lucky to have a lean mix of chicken so the oil was minimal.I used leg quarters so I cooked it a bit longer....90 minutes total.  I basted the best I could...I didn't want to add more oil.  Served this with kale and of course a hunk of baggette!  I will definitely make this again.

Used leg quarters---very moist.  Cooked the chicken & potatoes on different pans, same amount of time---excellent results.  Coated the chicken w/ the oil/herb mixture a couple hours before baking and would do the same (or overnight) next time---no lack of flavor.

I used 4 chicken leg quarters, about medium 6 red potatoes (cut into 8ths) and all dried herbs.  I mixed the dried herbs in with the olive oil and tossed everything together in the baking dish, then topped with extra salt and pepper.  This dish was a breeze to throw together and the chicken was fantastic, but the potatoes were not quite crispy - next time I will drain the oil from the baking dish before the cook time is up as others have suggested.

Excellent recipe.  I used 4 split chicken breasts and the only thing I have to say is that it took longer than 1 hour to cook.  So, at the end I put it under the broiler for 10-15 minutes to brown it up.  Thoroughly enjoyed - definitely a keeper.

FIVE STARS!  Used boneless skinless chicken breast and put in the oven during the last 25 minutes. Real rosemary is crucial to the success of this dish. Used real crushed garlic as well. Delicious!

I got this recipe two years ago and make it all the time.  I have 3 kids and all of them love it. The only thing we do different is cut the chicken, and potatoes into bite-sized pieces and add sliced onions and it is delicious.

It was way too oily.  The flavour was good but even tossing it with oil and then scooping only the chicken and potatoes into the pan and leaving the oil in the bowl the end product was much too greasy to be enjoyable.  Won't bother making this again.

I used 3 HUGE bone-in chicken breasts& had to add 15-18 min onto the cooking time. My potatoes didn't get crispy at all, even after draining the oil & adding an additional 20 min onto their cooking time(after removing the chicken). However, the flavor was GREAT & the chicken as very moist, juicy, & flavorful. I upped all of the herbs a bit & added 1 1/2 tsp of onion powder.

Very good, easy recipe. I made 8 chicken thighs on one baking sheet and 6 large potatoes on another sheet. I used 1/4 cup oil on the fries and skipped the oil on the chicken, since it had plenty of fat from the skin. I basted the chicken during the last 15 minutes with the juices. It was delicious and made the house smell great, and I only used dried rosemary. I think I'll try fresh next time.

I wasn't all that impressed by this recipe.  It might be because I don't really like thighs...I used a mix of thighs and boneless, skinless chicken breasts in this recipe.

This is the first time I have cooked something like this, and it was pretty good just a little on the dry side and kind of bland. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, there was 6 of them in the package. I only had two large red potatoes so I used 4 medium sized russett's with them and 5 fresh carrots that I peeled and chopped up. Oh and one small onion - I can't seem to make anything without onion, but you couldn't even taste it. I baked for a little over an hour the chicken was moist inside but the whole meal just left my mouth kind of dry, I did end up adding a lot of franks red hot in the end. Very easy to put together and pretty cheap too. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great dish! I marinated the chicken the night before and added extra spices on chicken breasts with bones including paprika, onion powder and thyme. I used Yukon potatoes because that's what I had on hand and baked them in different baking dishes because I thought the potatoes would be done before the chicken.

This is very easy & delicious! I didn't measure any of the seasonings. I seasoned the chicken first and put it in the oven on 425 for 15min while I prepared the potatoes. I seasoned potatoes, then added them to the chicken, lowered the temp back to on in recipe for another 45 min. I would have left it in the oven for a little longer to crisp it up, but my husband was in a hurry. It smells fabulous while cooking! It's a keeper!

This was good, though not great.  The chicken was flavorful, but done much sooner than the potatoes.

This recipe was delicious. The chicken was very moist. I used a combination ob thighs and breasts (which I cut in half with my trusty meat cleaver so they would cook through). I used fingerling potatoes (had them on hand and needed to use) and left them whole. I used 3 cloves of grated fresh garlic that I mixed with the oil before coating the chicken and taters. The chicken skin was not terribly crispy. I will make this again, but may boost the heat for the last 15 minutes after basting and removing the grease. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was an incredibly easy and tasty, dish.  I did use real garlic, and I rubbed the rosemary/oregano/garlic/olive oil mixture on the chicken before baking.  I covered the chicken and potatoes for the first 30 minutes, then uncovered for 45.  I also added grape tomatoes and sliced crimini mushrooms 30 minutes in.  (I probably should have drained off the fat as some people suggested, but I was too lazy.)  Very, very yummy, and it smells so divine in the oven!

This was great!  I did it as written with the exception of using dried herbs instead of fresh.  Whole family loved it!  I especially loved the potatoes which got crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  Yum with all the seasonings.  I skinned the chicken first, which decreased the fat significantly, and reduced the olive oil to 1/3 cup instead of 1/2c. No basting, though might have made the outer layer of meat less chewy if I had.  It was easy and tasty.  Will definitely make again!

Chicken turned out great, very moist. I baked it for 50 minutes, removing all of the extra oil about 10 minutes prior to taking it out of the oven. Will make this again!

I made this last night and it was great!  I did use only 6 chicken thighs (it was one package at the store) and used 8 petite red potatoes.  Next time I might choose slightly larger small red potatoes.  I used about 1/3 cup olive oil and could have probably been fine with a little less than that.  I cooked it together for 1 hour and it was fantastic!  I will definitely be making this again- and probably sometime soon.  It was a really simple dinner to put together and tasted great!

This is a great tasting recipe and VERY easy. I took someone else's advice and put the seasoning beneath the skin as well. Also, I brush the seasoning on the chicken rather than stir & coat .. it reduces the amount of oil used. Lastly, I don't make it with the potatoes, just the chicken and usually serve asparagus as a side.

Substitutions used were chicken wings instead of thighs, dried rosemary & oregano rather than fresh. Added some onions & lemon juice as others suggested. Not intentionally, but ended up marinating over 24 hours. I served with cornbread, green beans, & pineapple slices for dessert.

This is a great dish, that I felt had an upscale taste.  It should be named Rosemary Chicken with Roasted Potatoes. I think people from some of the reviews are actually expecting Fried like taste in the fries and chicken, which is not possible or necessary to the success of this dish. I cut my potatoes smaller and used skinless chicken breast.  I put in a pan where everything could be almost a single layer to allow for the potatoes to get crispy.  Because I used boneless chicken breast that weren't super thick I reduced the cooking time to 40 minutes.  Perfect, easy dish.  This will be made again and again.

Great EASY recipe!! The only problem was I changed the number of portions and it called for way too much oil, I had to drain some before I even put it in the oven. I also threw in a few drumsticks because my kids like them over the thights. The flavor was delicious, my family enjoyed it and I loved how easy it was to prepare.

Loved this dish. Only three minor adjustments will be made next time. More rosemary, marinate the chicken (flavor bareley penetrated), and let the potatos bake for 15-20 minutes before (did not brown much but were kinda crispy). I add the chicken. i started the chicken skin side down. Then half way through drained off the fat and turned the chicken. I also used a cooking sheet with sides induce browning.

Very easy to make and tastes great. Tried making this using a whole chicken and the potatoes were done much sooner than the chicken. Tried again useing the chicken thighs and it was wonderful. Will make this again.

As written, this is a very good recipe (4-1/2 stars, perhaps).  The second time I made it I followed others' suggestions: Brining, adding lemon juice, Worchester, and substituting onion powder for garlic (personal preference) made this recipe out of this world!  5* for ease, 5* for taste, 5* for texture.  The third time I make this I will make more potatoes - we loved 'em!  Thanks Sandy!

This recipe is okay for when you do not feel like standing on your feet all night preparing dinner. All you have to do is throw everything together and pop it in the oven. I am giving 3 stars just because I made the recipe exactly as-is and neither the chicken or potatoes were crispy. It doesn't have a bad taste either but it's missing something...can be a little bland.

I made this last night.  It was really good.  The only thing I did diffently was I added 5 oz of cream of chicken soup to my potatos and I used chicken wingettes instead.  It still came out crispy with exploding favor! 
I served along side a veggie packed Salad

This was wonderful.  I added some minced garlic to the olive oil mixture before tossing with the chicken and potatoes, and I only had dried rosemary, but it worked fine.  I threw this in the oven, threw on my walking shoes, and went walking, and came back to a wonderful smelling home, and dinner ready.  My boyfriend and I loved it!

My husband and I enjoyed the chicken. I used thighs with bones. I cut the recipe in half and on 2 thighs I took the skin off to compare tastes. The thighs with the skin was definitely the crispy one and more enjoyable. I did not try this potato recipe. Instead I use the Hidden Valley seasoning mix packet because I know for sure the roasted potatoes will taste good.

This was ok.  I used all of the fresh herbs.. smelled great cooking, but i wish the chicken had a little more flavor.  The potatoes were ok too.  I guess my expectations were too high based on the other reviews.  Nothing too special about this, may or may not make again.

I will admit that I was a bit hesitant with this one since we never eat thigh meat and I was worried it wouldn't be crispy due to some of the reviews but we LOVED it! The only change I made was I used 11 thighs and two 9 by 13 pans so I wouldn't over crowd everything and it came out very crispy and flavorful! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I'm sad to say my fresh Rosemary started to go south before I had a chance to use it.  I was only able to salvage about 1 T worth and had to use some dried stuff too, fresh is definitely the way to go with this dish.  It sure smelled wonderful while baking.

This is the perfect meal for those nights that you just don't feel like cooking.  It took 10 minutes to throw it all together and put it in the oven so I could relax instead of stand over a hot stove.  I realized in the beginning that I accidently had bought skinless chicken thighs, so I didn't end up with crispy chicken, but it was still delicious anyway.  Definitely use the fresh rosemary, it makes all the difference.

There was nothing crispy about this recipe.  The potatoes were mushy.

I had a lone sweet potato that I added along with the other 2 russets that were in the pantry.  The sweet potato was fabulous as it added a new dimension to the flavor. Other than that and using extra fresh garlic, I didn't change anything. The recipe was wonderful.

Very good!  The potatoes came out similar to the roasted ones my grandmother used to make.  They were not crispy like homefries.  I seasoned them liberally with rosemary, salt, oregano, paprika, garlic powder and fennel seeds.  I also added sliced onion and some fresh garlic. The bone-in, skin-on thighs gave up a lot of juice and that added to the flavoring.  It was very easy to make and we all enjoyed it very much.

Super easy!!  I used tons of fresh coarsely chopped garlic (plus garlic salt), fresh rosemary and dried oregano. I also added fresh mushrooms - but make sure they are on the bottom or else they dry out. I didn't mind the extra liquid, and the tops crisped up nicely. Simple, delish and savoury!

I had planned to make these on a random Tuesday night. I was in the middle of baking them when my husband called and said he was bringing a few business associates home for work. I was pleasantly surprised that this meal turned out well enough for a surprise business dinner, or would work for a casual night with the family. It's delicious and easy to make. A keeper recipe.

easy to make, and very tasty! as other people have mentioned, it is a little on the oily side. will reduce the amount of olive oil next time and throw in more potatoes (sliced them in eighths, they were delish), but other than that, it was great!

I added onions, which is what I think made it five stars, but this was deliscious anyhow. I had to cook some of it longer than an hour to make it crispy. It's definitly worth the wait, though. Yum!

Man, was this good!  And easy!  I used the dry spices because that's what I had.  And we used leg quarters.  Baked it in the oven for about 1 1/4 and served it with spinach.  Very good recipe.  Thanks Sandy.

Smells great in the oven and did come out crispy.  However, if you enjoy recipes with full flavor, this recipe is not for you.  It was terribly bland.  It produced a lot of juice while cooking so if you want it to crisp, drain it and cook another 15 minutes.

Made this for dinner today.
Excellent! 
The only thing I would change is the potato quarters into eighths.
The meat literally fell off the chicken bone. Hubby loved it. Thanks a lot!
It's a "keeper" in my book

Simple enought to prepare. Liked the fresh herbs. was disappointed in the potatoes. certainly not crispy.and perhaps not quite done after 1 hour and 15 minutes cooking time. I quartered them as the recipe called for but they definitely needed to be smaller. My husband loved the chiken. I liked it but was not wowed. Will probably make it again but play around with it some.

This recipe is very good. I have used other chicken pieces as well as thighs, and they were all fabulous. Be sure to keep basting throughout the cooking, it really makes a difference. The chicken drippings taste great on the potatoes!

I'm finding that I'm not really a chicken person - while it's a nice go-to meal when you aren't feeling creative, it's hard to wow me with chicken.  But it was fine.  But the potatoes - yum!  I used red as the recipe suggested and they were wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe...

An easy recipe for certain! I only made the chicken, not the fries. I added fresh lemon wedges all around the chicken to give it some extra flavor. Next time I make this, I plan to use chicken drumsticks and wings, add a bit more garlic powder and baste more often. Overall though, this was delicious. I am using the leftovers today for a soup stock.

The flavor was wonderful, and it smelled delicious while cooking.  The potatoes are more like "wedges" than "fries" and I coated them with a little too much olive oil which resulted in them not being crispy at all (but still delicious).  I didn't have red potatoes so I used russet, and I didn't have fresh herbs so I used dried.  It still turned out great!  I will definitely make this again and just use less oil.  Prep time was wonderfully quick and easy!

My 6 year old son will not eat potatoes and he practically ate every single one with this dish.  We loved this recipe!  The only things I changed were that we didn't have red potatoes so I used russets and I didn't have garlic powder so I used fresh chopped garlic.  Thanks for the recipe!

First of all, this was super good and super easy! I only have 2 criticisms of this recipe. The first is that it calls for too much oil. I already used less then it called for and it was too much. I think if I had used even less then it would have allowed the potatoes to get more crispy. Secondly, there really isnt any point in putting everything into a bowl to coat with oil, save the dish and mix it on the pan. Additionally, to make my chicken skin extra crispy I salted the skin and let it sit for 10 mins, then Pat dry to remove excess liquid. Also I turned up the oven to 450 for the last 10 mins. The only other change I did was add baby carrots (they came out perfectly cooked and delicious). This is going to be one of our regular weeknight meals for sure.

Just made this tonight for me and my tween who is extremely extremely picky. We both like spice so the only addition I made was creole seasoning.  All ingredients tasted great. We loved the crispy ness of the potatoes which were perfect but the chicken was dry for our liking. I love you made again I would cook potatoes first for 20’ the. Add the chicken like others stated.  I laid mine out in a large sheet pan and added onions because I love them so so much. This recipe was so easy to make. And if you prepare all the ingredients before you head off to work then pop it in the oven when you get home it’s easy peasy and bonus; it marinades all day. Yummy to both of us. Thanks for the recipe.

I made it just as suggested with the only exception is boneless/skinless chicken thighs.  It was delicious.  The potatoes were crispy and very tasty.  The chicken was moist and tender.

This recipe is SOOOOO good! I didn't use thighs, I used tenders instead but only cooked the chicken for 30 minutes, and the potatoes for an hour. So yummy!

Convenient  and delicious!  I used boneless chicken breast, and next time I’ll follow other reviewers’ advice and add the chicken to the baking sheet a little later, as it was a tad dry, having baked for the whole hour.  But overall this was a really good meal.  Served with Zucchini Tomato  casserole from this site.

This was so tasty and easy to put together! Whenever I cook chicken thighs in the oven, they always come out undercooked and I have to put them back in. But with this recipe, they cam out perfect the FIRST time! I used fresh garlic in place of garlic powder, but everything else was as the recipe called for. This will be a staple in our home from now on!

I have made this twice now exactly as written. Potatoes are soft and tasty but are not crisp. After baking for an hour at 375 the chicken skin is just barley starting to crisp up. I'm not sure if it's because there is a lot of juices in the pan but I'm going to drain the juices halfway next time. I'm also going to turn the broiler on for 5 or 10 minutes after its cooked for an hour and watch for the chicken to brown to try to get it crisp. Super tender and tasty chicken. I would suggest to brine it before you make it to ensure its juicy and amazing!

Oh my goodness, this recipe was so good, and made my home smell heavenly with the rosemary and oregano. I basted towards the end, and all was crispy and flavorful. Used coarse sea salt and cracked black pepper too. Will definitely be making this again, simple and delicious!

This was absolutely delicious! I don't enjoy cooking so I look for things that are easy.  I didn't have red potatoes so I settled for white and just cut into smaller pieces. I'm lucky enough to have rosemary growing like crazy outside of my house so no prob there. Do yourself a favor like it says and remove the excess liquid close to the end of cooking. That will allow everything to get more crisp. I'll be adding this to my regular rotation!

Yes made with two bone in chicken breasts and 1 boneless.  Came out very juicy, to juicy.  I used the correct amount of olive oil.  Dish was very tasty and everyone liked it, but if I make it again I would drizzle the olive on sparingly so as not to soak the potatoes.

This has become a favorite.  One hour is the right amount of time for the chicken (even with the skin removed, which I always do) and I've learned to cut the potatoes small enough to get done in the same amount of time. Also, as others have suggested, I suction out the excess oil and fat after 45 minutes. The removed oil and fat is actually pretty good schmaltz (plus EVOO) which I sometimes save to fry my eggs in the next morning.  The leftover seasonings work well with eggs.

I made this as written, although I put the fresh rosemary, salt, pepper and garlic powder directly on the chicken beneath the skin as others had suggested,  and then again in the oil with the potatoes.  While the chicken was very moist, it was rather bland.  There was also a lot of liquid in the pan after baking, so I probably didn't need as much oil.

My family and I enjoyed it well enough. We do use chopped garlic in addition to granulated garlic since we like it. While fresh rosemary is always the best, dried works well enough if you don't have any. I feel it's a great base recipe, but spices should be increased and modified based on your family's tastes. My family found it not as flavorful as we'd like, so while I'll likely make it again, I will be increasing the spices.

This is one of my favorite chicken dishes to make.  I didn’t have any fresh herbs so I used dried instead which turned out fine.  I don’t like oregano so I used Herbs de Provence instead and it works well as an alternative

This is one of my favorite meals ever.  I did microwave the potatoes for about 5 minutes because other reviewers said they didn't get done.  I mixed the oil, spices, and chicken in a Ziploc bag this morning and let it sit in the fridge all day, too. This is super easy, doesn't require anything hard to find or expensive, and it's delicious, too.

Excellent recipe!  My guests just loved it. Fresh rosemary, I believe, made a big difference. I did broil for last ~7 minutes to crisp top of chicken and fries.

This recipe was fabulous. Just the smell of the herbs filling your home are enough reason to make it. I used boneless skinless thighs. I cut the potato like French fries  to go with the name of the recipe. Made as directed and just added some slices of lemon. Great easy recipe!  I will be giving this to my college age kids to make at school because it’s a one bowl one baking sheet recipe.

Excellent dish producing tender chicken thighs! 

I put smashed garlic and a generous portion of the herbs below and on top each thigh before baking. Red potatoes or Yukon gold work fine. 

Add a side of stuffing for a most delicious meal.

Very easy to make and tasty. As others suggested, I added the chicken (breasts, sliced in half lengthwise) half way through and it came out nice and tender.

I love this recipe, have made it many times and it’s lovely and easy. I don’t change a thing except the oil quantity according to the number of thighs I have. There are only two of us so I often just cook four. 

Beautiful recipe.

I thought the recipe was great! I will definitely be making this again. My family also liked it. My picky eaters ate everything on their plate. The only thing I changed was that I cooked the potatoes for 30 minutes before adding the chicken, and I also added carrots.

I made the mistake of only reading the recipe and not watching the video so, as my potatoes were big, quartering them was not enough to cook them at the same rate as the chicken. Also, 1/2 cup of olive oil was way too much if you have skin/fat on the chicken thighs.  I salvaged it by draining some of the oil and taking out the chicken and cooking the potatoes more, but this recipe requires more detailed instructions.

This wasn't that awesome.  It was basic at best. The chicken ended up dry and the potatoes not super crisp.

I didn't change anything about this recipe. The chicken seemed to be lacking in flavor a bit. The potatoes were very good. I will make it again. It was quick and easy.

So good! Texture and flavor of the potatoes were amazing. I used Yukon gold that I had on hand and they were crispy outside but so creamy inside.  Only other change was fresh garlic and dried oregano. One hour cook time was perfect. The house smelled so good while it was cooking. I would add even more rosemary next time.

Good, not great. Made with boneless, skinless thighs and they developed a bit of a gross 'skin.' Should have stuck with the original recipe. Was VERY EASY though and will definitely make again.

Family found it to be rather bland and the potatoes didn't really crisp up.  The vote was "it's ok" but don't rush to make it again.

Excellent meal. I added lemon juice and slices of lemon to the chicken, cooked it for 1 hour and 20 minutes instead of one hour, and the thighs were cooked to perfection, juicy, and the skin crips. Maybe I should have added more potatoes. I did make 8 and it wasn't enough because they're delicious! I also added fresh thyme, and used dried oregano because I didn't have fresh.

Very tasty and easy!

The only thing I would change is that I would sear the chicken and potatoes on both sides, before putting it in the oven. The sides that were face-down crisped nicely, but the tops did not. 

I made this in a cast iron skillet and it worked nicely.

We followed the recipe exactly - although it was scaled down - and it was fine. My husband and I especially enjoyed how easy the dinner was to put together. The chicken didn't turn out as crispy as we would have liked, but the flavor was otherwise good if not  a bit too mild for our tastes. We may or may not make this again, and if we do, we will adjust the seasonings to our liking because this is a great recipe to build on. Thank you for sharing!

Thanks, Sandy, for a quick and tasty recipe.  I baste the chicken a couple of times while it's baking and the skin gets wonderfully crispy.  I usually make a separate, big old pan of the potatoes and I baste them with the liquid from the chicken, too.  So good!

This was the first dish I made using my new gas oven/stove in my new place.  Unfortunately, my oven doesn't have a thermometer and I have to preheat it at about 25 degrees higher than the instructed temperature to get to the right spot, so the chicken wasn't fully cooked and I messed up in a couple of spots.  However, when we did get it fully cooked and everything, it was delicious.  I will be making again.

Loved it! So easy, and doesn't require much in the way of careful measuring. I've made it twice, once with even amounts with chicken and potatoes, and once with more potatoes than chicken. I seasoned with all five items to taste, and it came out great both times. The whole family raved about it, even the vegetarian daughter, whose potatoes were cooked separately. This one's a keeper; thanks for sharing it!

From the start, this is a great recipe--love the flavor blend!  But I live alone and try to fix large quantities and freeze meals ahead.  Time to experiment.  After some tries, I finally developed this process for me.  1) I use a 5 lb bag of red potatoes and  half-cook the potatoes in the microwave, or until still firm, but just so--then cool.  2) I trim and cut up 4.5 - 5 pounds skinless/boneless chicken breads into loosely 1" cubes.  3) cut the potatoes into quarters lengthwise, then into half crosswise.  4) Toss them together into a large bowl with double the oil and 3 - 4 times the herbs (or more 'cause I love rosemary and oregano!).  5) Divide into individual servings (or whatever size works for you) in freezer bags and freeze.   6)  At meal time, defrost the packet, preheat a pan on medium high and add the ingredients.  I may also toss in some broccoli florets at this point.  7) Turn heat to medium and cook for 10 minutes,  stirring occasionally to ensure even browning.  8)  Check to be sure the larger chicken pieces are done before serving.

Made this twice so far! My boys eat it up. I used boneless thighs and then breasts the second time. I parboiled my potatoes to make sure they were cooked thoroughly with the decreased cooking time with the boneless chicken.   They definitely came out better than the first time.  However, I didn't get that good "roasted" crispiness on them that I wanted. Probably because I over do it with the olive oil :)

I've made this twice now, and both times used yellow potatoes (had them on hand) cut quite small.  First time used chicken legs bone-in skin-on, second time bone-in skin off chicken breasts - both times were great - love this recipe (and it's easy!)

I will make it again.  I only used about 1/4 cup of olive oil, and I had to go with dried herbs, but it worked really well.

This was very simple and tasty but I used the advice of one of the other reviews and exchanged the garlic powder for garlic cloves.  I won't do that again!  The final taste was only a little strong but the air was so thick with garlic that we could hardly stand to enter the house!

I made the recipe as is, with the exception of using just enough olive oil to baste both sides of the chicken thighs instead of 1/2 a cup, and I used fresh rosemary, sage, and thyme (instead of the oregano) because that's what I had on hand.  Followed the advice of other users and at 45 minutes, basted the chicken and dumped off the oil that had collected in the pan before baking it for the last 15 minutes.  The chicken was tender and juicy, with crispy skin, and tasted really good.  Also, I baked the potatoes in a separate pan as there wasn't room for both in my baking pan, but they turned out delicious too.  Will definitely make this recipe again.

This is really a hit with my family.  Instead of thighs I used party wings (that is what I had available), and the smell of this cooking was so warming, my family couldn't wait to taste it! (I actually used a little more of the Rosemary than the recipe called for), but the results were well worth it.    I did find that it takes longer than an hour to cook with the potatoes, they were a little to crunchy in the center and my family they wanted them softer.   When I made them thin and they cooked better, still over an hour, but better.  This is a complete hit with my family and will definitely be used again and again.

Easy to make, easy to clean up, tasty and healthy - what's not to love  Yup, this one goes into regular rotation.

I used about 2# boneless, skinless thighs, and about 2# of russet potatoes because that's what I had on hand.  Added half a bag of baby carrots to make up for skimping on the potatoes.  I did use half the olive oil (but will spray the foil in the pan next time as a few of the potatoes stuck).  I didn't measure any of the spices, just eyeballed it.  Didn't baste or turn, just set it and forget it.  Potoatoes did get crispy, thighs were moist, carrots were carmelized.  Planned on leftovers for a few lunches this week so this is a great "big batch" recipe.    I also love that you can throw in other veggies - I will probably use sweet potatoes in the future, and califlower, and green beans.   Also, it's such a basic recipe, it would also be easy to  change up the flavors - before serving, add a splash of balsamic vinegar, or lemon juice & lemon pepper, some fig butter or cranberry sauce, maybe sun-dried tomatoes,  even BBQ sauce.

I made this last night as a low sodium meal option.

It was quite good - I browned the thighs before mixing with the veggies which yielded a crispy skin-like exterior (my husband actually thought it *was* skin).

I'd add more ingredients to the veg hash next time - we did potatoes and carrots, but I'd add butternut squash, onions, walnuts, and raisins next time to liven it up a bit.  The potatoes came out nice and crispy.

This is such a great, easy recipe.  I love that I could cook the chicken and potatoes together for an easy meal.  I made very slight modifications.  I used boneless, skinless thighs.  I used two sprigs of fresh rosemary and 4 cloves of fresh garlic, minced.  I also sprinkled in about 1/2 tsp. of ground thyme and omitted the oregano.  I added salt flakes to the top as I like the texture.  As the recipe states, I put all the ingredients together and baked it for an entire hour, broiling for the last 5 minutes for crispiness.  The chicken was juicy and not dry, and potatoes were soft.  This will become a staple for me!

It was very good.  I followed the recipe exactly and basted twice, drained and cooked for 15 minutes. The only thing I would do differently  next time is add more  garlic.

I made this last night.  I used bone in chicken thighs and fresh  spices. The only thing I did different was poured out the E.V.O.O. From the baking sheet about 45 min in... I did that Bc I wanted the potatoes to be crisp on the outside an mushy on the inside! All in all great easy dinner for under $20... My husband an I will make this a regular dinner on our monthly menu!!!

This is a great basic recipe.  Not too complicated, and very tasty.  Incorporating the comments of others, I decreased the amount of olive oil and added fresh green beans, fresh minced garlic, baby bellas, and onion wedges.  In order to crisp the potatoes and chicken, I cooked it much longer than one hour at a higher temperature.  My husband and I enjoyed leftovers for lunch today.

My family of picky eaters loves this dish.  Makes the whole house smell yummy while it's cooking.  I have a big family, so I cook the potatoes and the chicken in separate dishes; cook the potatoes first for about 40 mins then throw in the chicken dish for about 25 mins.  Used the ingredients exactly as listed; just doubled it for my large family.  Thank you this recipe!

This is one of those recipes that you can't mess up. Use as much chicken and potatoes as you need and just eyeball the spices and the herbs.
Make sure the cookie sheet you're using is big enough for the chicken and potato pieces to be in one layer. 
The only thing I will change about this next time is reducing the olive oil. When I checked on the dish in the oven, everything seemed to be swimming in fat..! And it wasn't chicken fat,  cause I used skinless drumsticks. I had to use some paper towels, in mid cooking, to get rid of some of the oil.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was fantastic. The only thing I did was to take the chicken out early and let the potatoes crisp longer, but that's a personal preference.  The thighs were juicy and cooked perfectly! Thanks so much for sharing!

Made this last night exactly according to the recipe but didn't measure the spices, just eyeballed them to what looked good, which was probably double the amount called for in the recipe. I was surprised how really, really good this was. Bone-in chicken thighs were golden brown, crispy outside and tender inside. The Red potato quarters were equally good and tender. Everybody loved it.

This was very yummy, and oh so easy! I took reviewers suggestions: season under the skin and put the potatoes in 1st 20 minutes w/o chicken (so potatoes would get nice & brown and chicken not overdone).  I actually almost doubled the spices (but I had added a little extra chicken and potatoes). When the chicken was done, I turned on the broiler just to give both the chicken and potatoes the nice browning I was looking for. Like another reviewer stated, the basting really DID impart a really nice flavor to the potatoes! All-in-all, a great recipe that the whole family loved!

This dish was excellent. I used chicken legs instead of thighs. I brined them for about an hour before seasoning & placing in the oven. Also I mixed the potatoes & chicken in a bowl with the oil & seasonings so I wouldn't have to use all of the oil mentioned in the recipe. Plus I drizzled additional oil on top prior to placing in oven. And I only left chicken in oven for 1 hour. The chicken was nice & juicy. The potatoes were good as well.

I have made this recipe so many times, & it's always a hit! I use small Yukon Gold potatoes because I like them better. If I don't have any fresh oregano, I just use Rosemary because we have it growing in our yard. I also just combine all of the ingredients in the bowl before putting them in the baking pan, which makes it even easier. Thanks for such an easy, reliable, go-to recipe!

This was a fun recipe.  I made it as written except to substitute dried oregano for fresh.  I've been trying to find recipes to make for my daughter who is in her first trimester of pregnancy and has had difficulty eating due to unusual acid reflux.  I wanted something which was tasty but "bland."  I made this and took it over for dinner tonight.  She enjoyed it, her husband had seconds, and the kids even liked it.  In fact, my grandsons requested it for dinner for our sleepover Friday night.  Twice in one week for the 5 and 7 year old is a rare compliment.

Not bad, not great. Mine were soggy with chicken juice. Which wasn't bad, but was a bit dissapointing. Not a ton of flavor, even after marinating the chicken all day. If you like a subtle flavor profile, you might like this, but I like my food pretty bold. If I made something like this again, I would probably add mushrooms, onion, and more spices.

Quick - easy - Excellent as per recipe.  I used dried oregano because I didn't have fresh and used fresh garlic rather than garlic powder.  Big hit at mothers day dinner.

I made this for Easter this year for the first time and it turned out really well. I did cook it in a roasting bag, mostly for clean up purposes. I cut open the bag for the last 30 minutes to brown even more. Everyone loved it and it was really easy.

My 7 year old oohed and ahhed all over this and gave it a score of a solid 8.  I tried to be true to the recipe.  The grocery store did not have fresh oregano so I decided to use my dry herbs (which I then forgot to add).  I realized my error just a couple of minutes into cooking and sprinkled the oregano on top of the chicken and potatoes.  I also added carrots and onions.  The onions charred a bit and were delicious.  The husband who never scores my meals highly gave this recipe a 10.  It is a keeper.  I used nonstick foil on the cookie tray to make clean up easier.

This tasted great.  I used poultry seasoning, which was a little strong but everyone liked it.  The potatoes turned out nice and crispy and while the chicken was not as crispy as I expected it to be, the dish was good anyway.  As a vegetable side dish I made broccoli stir-fry.

I enjoyed the fresh herbs, and the ease of preparation.  Prepared exact to recipe.  The potatoes got crisp, but chicken remained colorless and never got crisp.  Next time I will brown the chicken before I put it in oven, and double the herbs.

I liked it and will make it again. I added two minced garlic rather than garlic powder, and used chicken thigh pieces rather than with skin-on. It made the house smell delicious! I also would like to reiterate other reviewers in that the fresh herbs are worth it. Mmmmm.....enjoy!

I gave this a four star even though it didn't turn out as described.  I followed exactly, I did follow suggestions of cooking the potatoes for a half hour before adding chicken, and I did allow the chicken and potatoes to marinate, put fresh rosemary and oregano under the chicken skin, used coarse salt as someone suggested.  I did throw in baby carrots and an onion just because I had some to use.  I used a metal baking pan instead of a glass one.  It didn't come out "crispy".   I think my oven must be off.  When I increased the heat it did get a little more crispy, but by then everything was done and borderline overcooked.  I am going to try again, because I know this recipe has to work!  This time I will increase the heat, and I am going to go buy a thermometer to see how off my oven settings are.  I have noticed a few things that didn't seem to bake properly, so that is what I assume is the problem.   Even though it didn't cook up as described it was still tasty, the onions caramelized beautifully, and I liked the carrots in the dish for color.

I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs because that's what was available at my grocery store. I took the suggestion of cooking the vegetables first (I added sliced multi-colored carrots), then added the chicken after 30 minutes. I didn't bother chopping the herbs, just placed them on top of veggies and chicken. So easy to make and absolutely delicious!!!!

Made exactly as directed with the exception of boneless, skinless thighs. Turned out great and everyone liked it, including my 7 year old! Next time I make though, I will cut the oil in half.  It was a wee bit too much (saw the as necessary a little too late).

I made this last night with a few of the modifications/substitutions recommended by others. I used chicken breasts, fresh herbs and garlic and a LOT less oil (about 3 tablespoons). Baked the whole thing for an hour and it was great. Chicken was not too dry, potatoes crispy. The dish was very flavorful so those who are complaining about it being bland are either not using fresh herbs, not using enough seasoning or have very damaged taste buds. I also used grapeseed oil instead of olive oil, which I highly recommend. Grapeseed is lighter and doesn't have the heavy texture or taste of olive oil. It's a quick one dish meal with very little prep work. I'll make this again.

I just made this recipe for dinner tonight. It was excellent! Definitely use the fresh rosemary and oregano, it makes the dish. The potatoes and chicken came out crispy and were wonderful. This is absolutely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was AMAZING!!!!  I used dried ingredients, but did not reduce the recipe amounts and it turned out great!  I used a turkey baster to spread the dripping around all the meat and potatoes at 45 minutes and it worked like a charm!  I also used both thighs and drumsticks...and made two pans full, with extra potatoes for each pan...was a hit!!! This one is in my recipe book for sure.  Thanks for sharing!  :)

This was easy and very tasty. We removed the skin and reduced the amount of oil. it still cooked up nice and juicy! I am definitely adding it to our list of favorite meals.

This was pretty darned good. It actually came out better than I thought it would. I inadvertently changed it by grabbing marjoram instead of oregano, but that didn't change it too much. The chicken (skin on) came out beautifully crisp. The potatoes, on the other hand, did not have the consistency of fried but rather roasted potatoes with a nice crust to them. I happen to like them that way so I wasn't disappointed. As for the comments that it was bland, you get out what you put in my darlings. This isn't Indian or Szechuan food. It's just an easy chicken and potatoes meal using a nice mix of herbs. If you want more spice, adjust the amount and/or type of seasoning you're using. It's a very adaptable recipe.

My family loved this!  I will definitely make again. Super easy and good.  I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper under the skin and on the bottom, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. The only change I will make next time is to use less oil.

It looked great but the potatoes weren't cooked through and the chicken was flavorless.  I am not sure why, but kind of bummer.

I have never seen my 2 and 4 year eat chicken straight off the bone before. This recipe was excellent and will be used again! Might use about half the amount of oil though...

Great recipe just changed a few things. Used 1 lb. chkn breast cut into slices, marinated in spices/oil plus white wine vinegar 4hrs.  Cubed fingerlings and 2 wht potatoes in spices/oil.  Put 1/3 potatoes in with chkn and the rest on baking sheet.  Cooked an extra 10-15 min.  Yum!

I make this dish a lot because it is healthy and quick. I don't ever use 1/2 cup of oil, that seems excessive to me, but everything else I follow exactly. This is great when you're not in the mood to really cook :)

Very flavorful chicken and potatoes and the aroma is still lingering 3 hours after dinner. The fresh Rosemary and Oregano was a great combination. I added carrots and red pepper to this recipe.

I didn't measure my oil, ended up with too much, and it was not crispy at all.

I would make this again measuring out the oil next time.

Used 6 boneless/skinless chicken breasts, and followed the rest of the recipe to a T. Did put the potatoes in 30 mins before chicken, so not to dry out the meat. Found that I couldn't get my potatoes crispy, I even took the chicken out when it was done and put the potatoes under the broiler for 10 mins. Flavour was good, but you definitely need to be a fan of rosemary, as it's pretty overpowering. Not sure if I would make again, wasn't my fav.

Only change made was to use fresh minced garlic.  It was too greasy for my taste especially using thighs.  The second time I made this I sprayed baking dish with olive oil and cut the oil by half.  I made this for my daughter and son-in-law and family and they really loved it.  Loved using fresh rosemary and oregano the aroma and taste was very good.  Thanks for recipe.

This was an easy tasty dinner put together in 15 minutes. Thrown in oven and ready under and hour. Didn't have fresh or dried rosemary, so,looked up the substitute .... Thyme did it along with the oregano and garlic powder.  Will make again with fresh herbs. Can only make better I bet!

Delicious.  Had such good flavours (fresh rosemary - yes!) and chicken and potatoes were crispy.  Even hubby liked it and he doesn't normally eat chicken thighs!  The only thing I did differently was that for the last 10-15 minutes I increased the oven temperature to 425 and sprayed each thigh with Pam to crisp them up.  I was wowed!

I used plenty of oregano and rosemary from my garden and was fortunate enough to have lots of branches of oregano blossoms to decorate for serving - it looked great, the chicken was nice and crisp as well as moist. However, the flavor just wasn't very remarkable. If I tried it again, I might use real garlic instead of powder, put the herbs both under and on top of the chicken, and add a lot more salt and pepper. As it was, no one (out of 14 people) had a second piece...a rarity with this crowd. The potatoes were all gone, however.

I made this with chicken breasts and it was so fragrant and good.  My husband kept saying how great it smelled.  I used skin on breasts.  It was crispy and moist.

Made this recipe tonight.  The package contained 9 not 8 chicken thighs and I may have been a little more generous with the Rosemary and Oregano but my family loved it.  My husband is currently in the kitchen on his second round. The flavour was well rounded and delicious..  Thank you.

I made this last night for my family.  We all loved it.  Very good flavor.  I might try it next time with only a 1/3 cup of oil.  As suggested I used thyme instead of oregano and really enjoyed the flavor of it.  I don't use rosemary and thyme very often so I was glad to come across this recipe.  I will be making this again.  Thank you for submitting this.

My wife and I loved this recipe!  I think the secret to this great recipe is the use of fresh rosemary and fresh oregano .  The smell alone brings the kitchen to life!  
My wife prefers chicken breasts so....the only  change was to substitute  one half of the chicken thighs with chicken breast.  It turned out to be great!!  Thanks!!!

Made the recipe as it was written.  Found that chicken thighs released a lot of additional oil, so I will used less olive oil next time.  I will also probably use a different chicken part in the future.  My family wasn't crazy about the chicken thighs.  The potatoes definitely need to go in before the chicken.

I loved it!  The changes I made were to use dried oregano and petite potatoes. I had a few extra pieces of skinless, boneless thigh and just added a little more olive oil and rosemary. I also added seasoning salt and poultry seasonings. Seriously, this is so simple and so good. I am totally making this again. I should also add that I let it marinate for over an hour.

My potatoes were not cooked quite enough and we felt that the oven temp should be increased.  I was using fresh rosemary and oregano from the garden and I think I needed more. Next time I will use more spices.It would have been better if everything was crispier.The taste was very good and for sure a keeper. Easy to prepare and cleanup.

We love this meal - we add carrots to make it a true one dish meal, and squeeze the juice of a lemon over it once it is ready to serve.  If you have too much juice in your pan chances are your chicken was injected with moisture at the packaging plant.  If your meal didn't brown your oven temp is off OR you crowded it into a pan too small to hold it all.

Cut back on the oil and add baby carrots to the potatoes. I used boneless thighs and 400 degrees for a faster meal. Fresh herbs are the key, as stated by other reviewers. The aroma of this meal could draw in the neighbors!

When I make this recipe I pour a little olive oil in a zippy bag and shape the individually frozen chicken breasts in that still frozen. And just spray the potatoes with pan coating before sprinkling all with seasoning.  This way not too oilly or too dry.
I then stir every thing at the half hour make and add a veggie to roast to we like corn or carrots or even green beans. Wonderful one dish meal for dinner and a great leftover lunch the next day.

I made this recipes with only changing that i used chicken breast instead of thighs. It was ok i found that the chicken was nice and juicy and that the potatoes were soft however, to me and my family there just was not enough flavor for us.

I love this recipe. The flavor of the potatoes is amazing. I made a few changes to adjust to my personal taste. I used more rosemary and garlic powder than the recipe stated. I put everything in a bowl, added 1 tablespoon lemon juice,some onion powder and then refrigerated for about 1-2 hours. I dumped it all in a large roasting pan (want space for better cooking) and baked. Remember to baste the last 15 minutes in order to have crispy chicken. So delicious!!!

Rarely do I rate a dish two stars, and I could have totally done something wrong...but this was a super bland dish.  I kept the skin on the thigh pieces, but that meant all the spices came right off when I removed to skin to eat the meal.

Easy for sure but a tad lacking in flavor, but that could be because I used dried herbs instead of fresh ones...

I have made this dish for many years. it is yummy :D  However, the people that 'marinate' this stuff..NOWHERE does it say to marinate anything.  And using chicken breast makes this a dry dish, so use what it says and don't eat so much if you are trying to control calories.

This is a recipe I have been trying to duplicate for 26 years since my mother died. On Sunday evenings at her home after we would finish our spaghetti and meatballs she would bring out the roaster with this dish in it...every Sunday. We couldn't wait for it as we could smell it while we were having our pasta dish. This recipe is the closest to hers that I have tried. In fact, tonight at dinner my wife said, " This tastes like your mother's..." ...after 26 years she remembered. Thank you.

I really enjoyed making this recipe.  It was very simple to make - I love anything that doesn't involve trashing my kitchen and using every dish in the house!  I added more spices than the recipe called for.  I sprinkled extra of everything on top of the chicken because I could just tell it would be bland otherwise, which seemed to be a good call.  My husband really enjoyed this and asked me to make it again soon, which is a good sign because most things are roughly equal to him and he'll eat almost anything without comment.

I made this with chicken thighs and boneless skinless chicken thighs.  I used less of the dried seasoning as stated in the directions.  The chicken was a bit bland.  I suggest using the full amount of seasoning (fresh or dried). I added onion bell pepper and garlic as well.

I used boneless chicken breasts as well and put it in the last 30 minutes. The potatoes were good but the chicken was dry and had no flavor. I will not make this again.

This was delicious! I pretty much followed the recipe but did add baby carrots to make it one stop shopping. My only other differences was I used boneless skinless thighs (because that's what my husband happened to buy) and doubled the spices. Everyone in the family ate it and that's not easy to say when you have an 11 yr old and an 8 yr old.

This was very good.  I used chicken breast so I started the potatoes sooner (or microwave till very hot first) and it came out very well.

Very easy. Used drumsticks. Use real garlic not powder. Add salt and pepper obviously. Wasn't very crispy. Drain oil at 30 min next time.

This was incredible!!!  I only used 4 thighs and 4 potatoes and it was still the perfect timing.  I used a baking sheet which didn't work so great for me, next time I will try a baking dish I think.  My potatoes were not very crispy, but they were so delicious I didn't even want them to be!  The skin on the chicken got just crispy enough and it was very moist and flavorful.  This is for sure my new go-to chicken dish!

I made this recipe exactly as written. Had to ask the butcher to de-bone the thighs for me (which he was happy to do). My husband loved this and wants it again. The chicken was very crispy on the outside & tender on the inside and the potatoes were delicious. There were no leftovers. I'm going to try it with some white meat next time. People, to get crispy chicken, you need to leave the skin on. Wonderful recipe!

Good base recipe. Doubled it & subbed boneless, skinless, coarsely chopped chicken breasts & half the amount of herbs (dried rosemary & dried parsley) for fresh. Added a 1/2 cup low fat ranch dressing & 1/4 cup Chicken broth to mix, as I wasn't sure of portions of potatoes & chicken given the substitutions. Excellent, quick dish that required minimal prep & clean-up!  Great dish to let cook while doing homework with the kids before dinner.  You can tweak easily according to your taste preferences (more parsley, more moist w/ broth, ranch dressing or half & half.).  Leftovers can easily be made into soups, wraps or a casserole.  Definitely worth a try...easy weeknight dinner with tossed salad...will definitely make again!  Thanks Sandy!

Really good.  USE bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces (I used thighs), because the skin will crisp up in the oven amazingly.  I used two thighs and halved the potatoes.  DON'T transfer all the oil to the baking pan - less oil will crisp everything up better.  DO wedge the potatoes - the chunkier, the better.  And STIR/TURN them at some point during cooking - I had some thinner pieces that crisped all the way through and were unappetizing.

The taste was flavorful but it wasn't crispy at all!  I guess the oil was supposed to make it crispy but without batter I don't know how that was supposed to happen.

Fantastic!! My husband and I loved this recipe! So much flavor! I used chicken leg quarters as my only alteration due to the fact that I did not have chicken thighs. It took a little bit longer to cook  because the leg quarters were bigger, but other than that, this is definitely going to be made again!

I ground the pepper, salt, oregano, rosemary, and garlic into a paste in a mortar, although I used dried herbs, I used double the amount as the fresh ones listed here, plus I added lemon zest (1 lemon), 2 tbsp of fresh cilantro, 1 tbsp of cayenne pepper, 2 tbsp of paprika, and 2 tsp of cumin, with a bit of olive oil to extract the essence of the garlic out. Then I added the juice of the lemon and turned it into a paste.

I inserted the paste between the skin and the chicken and cooked at 150c for 1 hour, then cranked up the broiler to 250c and moved the chicken under that for about 5 minutes to brown (while I took the potatoes out before cranking up the heat).

Easy and delicious!  My tweaks:  used boneless skinless thighs and Yukon Gold potatoes cut into wedges.   I used only about 1/3 cup olive oil and the seasonings as listed plus 1 tsp onion powder, mixed everything together and marinated at room temp for 45 minutes.  Spread it out between two baking sheets (low sided) so everything was in a single even layer.  Combined about 1/2 cup dry breadcrumbs  with 1/2 tsp salt and sprinkled it all over (since I was using skinless thighs, I thought this would replicate the "crisp" a bit).  Roasted at 375 for approx. 50 minutes, then broiled for a few add'l minutes for more browning.   Seasonings were lovely -- tasty but not too much (esp. for my kids). Served this with a simple romaine/spinach/red bell pepper/carrot salad.   Delicious weeknight addition to the meal plan.  Thank you for the base recipe, Sandy Witek, and thank you, commentors, who shared your additional tips.

Very good! I wasn't able to find the rubber squeezer of my baster so I had to make due with using a large spoon to spread the juices over the top to make it crispier. This recipe was simple to make and very tasty. I will definitely be making this again.

Easy one pot meal that can be tweaked to your liking with more or less of the spice and oil.  This has become one of our "go to" chicken meals.  The potatoes turn out crispy and delicious every time so now I usually double the amount.  Serve with a green salad and garlic bread.....never any complaints here.  Enjoy!

This meal was really good and tasty. My husband really liked it and said it tasted kind of like rotisserie chicken. I think 1/2 cup of olive oil was too much since the thighs are already pretty greedy. Will probably cut down to 1/4 cup just to get everything coated. Other than that, I will be cooking this meal at least once a month. It really is tasty.

My family loved this recipe as soon as I changed it slightly.  The potatoes seemed to never be done all the way through, so I parboiled them first.  They were crispy and done when the chicken was.  Awesome recipe!  Love the herbs!

What a great recipe!  I love chicken thighs ( boneless, skinless) and highly recommend using them.  I added some sliced portabellas during the last 15 min.  Great recipe for a work day.  Tastes like you spent hours making it!

This was excellent - you need to either put under broiler or up the heat last 10 mins to get it crispy - but personally don't care - IT WAS EXCELLENT

I enjoy this recipe partially because it makes my house smell so great when it's cooking, and partially because it's tasty. Best to finish the first day, you know the second you no longer have that 'cripiness'.

I followed the recipe exactly, but the chicken was dry and the french fries were greasy and soggy.  Definitely not a repeat.

Very tasty and easy to make! However, even with basting, the skin didn't come out as crispy as I had expected. Also, had a lot of spatters in the oven. Had to keep fanning the air out by the smoke detector. But, honestly, how do you beat anything with freh rosemary?

A quick and tasty recipe, enjoyed by the family but not Wow.  I would say 4 stars : I used 2.5 lbs of chicken breasts cut into 12 pieces total.  Next time I would cut cooking time to 50 minutes for the potatoes.

My husband loved this.   I used cubed chicken breast instead of chicken thighs, added fresh basil, and fresh  garlic instead of powdered garlic,  cubed the potatoes and put it in the George Foreman Grill for 10 minutes instead of baking it because I didn't want to heat up our house, and it turned out great.

I made this yesterday on labor day, one of the few dishes dishes I made for me and my friends. They said it was fire (delicious) when they tried it. Idk if I used too much olive oil or not but my potatoes weren't as crispy as I wished and although my friends liked it a lot I thought I needed more salt. One of my friends werent too crazy about the rosemary, but he is not used to things like that. I will make this again sometime. Thanks

Super easy, super delicious!  Chicken thighs (I used boneless, skinless) are a nice change from dry, bland chicken breasts.  Only recommendations are to increase the potatoes and reduce the oil a little.

Good, but not exceptional. I did add lemon juice and warcestershire...also more spices from my cabinet. What I did like was that the fattier dark meat chicken stayed very, very moist and my eight year old son loved it.  I also had the same situation where the potatoes did not get crispy!

Made as written.  Very good.  Tried a second time and rubbed the spices in underneath the skin of the chicken and roasted in a large roasting pan on a rack.  Awesome!  Best chicken ever.

age.    Skin sude down for 30 minutes.  Skin side up for the last 30.  No basting--just gives a soggy skin.

The flavors of this dish were great (5 stars), but my potatoes did not come out crispy at all (3 stars, hence the 4 star average), just the chicken.  We drained some of the oil and broiled it for 15 minutes at the end and still no crispy potatoes.  I did as suggested and rubbed the spices under the chicken skin and it was yummy!  Will probably try this one one more time baking it on a rack inside the baking dish to see if that helps the potatoes get crispy.

This pretty good.  The chicken was a little dry so I had to use BBQ sauce which I normally would never use.  But besides that it was good.

We just spray with olive oil spray and cook it a bit longer. So good with bbq sauce on the side. We also use breasts instead of thighs.

This came out just okay for us.  I may have done something wrong because ours did not come out crispy at all.  I think it was way too much oil.  I also only used dried herbs because thats what I had.  I will try again using fresh herbs and cut back on the oil.  I used chicken breasts cut in half, like tenders, and put in for just the 2nd 1/2 hour as previous reviewers suggested.

This didn't end up as juicy or crispy as I was hoping, and the flavor was just ok. Safe meal that smells delicious as you're baking though.

This smelled absolutely mouth-watering, but the taste didn't fully live up to that. It was good, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't great. The potatoes were definitely my favorite part.

4 stars for the potatoes for sure. they weren't as crispy as i thought they would be, but they were still really good. i didn't care for my skinless chicken breasts this way, but they're not what the recipe was designed for so i didn't factor that into my rating.

I used chicken breasts and cut them into smaller strips as someone suggested. WE are not a fan of dark meat. the flavor was so good but I did add some Slap ya Mama..BUT this was in NO way crispy which was disappointing. I probably won't make it again

I love recipes like this-easy to follow and turn out great!  On the advice of other reviews, I used boneless skinless chix breasts, cut lengthwise and reduced the amt of olive oil.  I put potatoes and chicken in a bowl with 1/4 c olive oil, fresh herbs and garlic powder, s&p and mixed to coat.  I cooked potatoes alone for first 30 mins then added the chix for last 30 mins.  Potatoes were nice and crispy on top and chicken was flavorful and moist!  Thanks for the recipe!

I was out of oregano so I used basil.  I then marinated the chicken all day and cooked it on the grill.  It was so good.  We had some leftover to which my fiance suggested would make great sandwiches.

I used the same basic recipe, but added parsley, more minced garlic, and not a lot of Basil and let the chicken thighs and potato wedges marinate overnight. It came out delightfully good and tender. Will make I'm the future! Kitchen smelled yummy as well while it was cooking.

This dish was delicious! The chicken was cooked perfectly with the time indicated, and the fresh oregano and rosemary made the meal. Next time I will add some fresh lemon juice and use fresh garlic, as suggested by other reviewers. Also, I'll use 1/4 cup oil instead of 1/2. Will make it again soon, for sure!

This came out fantastic. One of the best chicken recipes I've used. Chicken was crispy and the potatoes came out awesome. Used a little less oil than it called for as I didn't want to bath the potatoes in oil and it worked out great. A must try!

This was my first time cooking with spices that were fresh. It turned out very good! I put the spices in a "Magic Bullet" blender and it did a terrific job on them. The potato's and chicken didn't crisp up like they should have and I did cook 15 minutes extra after taking out the grease. Still, my family loved it. Next time I'll try a longer cooking time and put the potato's in first as someone recommended.

Too strong a rosemary flavor for our tastes. If I try this recipes again I will omit the rosemary and perhaps add some onion powder.

I used Idaho potatoes (because that's what I had) and cut them into large steak-fries. Cut boneless skinless chicken breasts into tenders about 1" in width. I baked the fries for about 20 minutes before adding chicken, but I could have done 30-40 so my chicken would not have gotten a little dry. Smelled OUTRAGEOUS baking in the oven, delicious dish!

I like any meal that is healthy with fuss-free preparation and minimal clean-up.  This is one of them!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and put them in the baking dish under the potatoes to keep them from drying out.  I added several whole shallots, poured the oil over everything and sprinkled with seasoning, then baked for one hour.  Simple and tasty.

I cooked the fries for 30 mins before addding the chicken.  Because of the juices from the chicken, the fries were not crispy.  It wasn't a big hit with my family.

Needs lemon juice. If you're baking chicken breasts, make sure to cut down the baking time, otherwise they will come out dry. In the last 7-10 mins, switch off the heat from the bottom (in the oven) and turn on heat to medium from the top to make the chicken crispy. Also, use fresh crushed garlic to rub your chicken, it gives more flavour this way. If you have time, marinate it for atleast an hour; overnight would be even better. Lastly, try adding italian seasoning too, it tastes phenomenal! Thanks for the post, will definitely make again.

I have made this twice in the last two weeks.  The chicken is so incredibly moist.  I followed the suggestion of other users and used chicken breasts. Both times I used frozen, from the bag chicken.  The first time I thawed it and added it at the 1/2 hour (putting the potatoes in for 1/2 hour first) and the second time I left them frozen and again added them 1/2 way through.  Both times it was fabulous!  Thank you!

I didn't have oregano and garlic powder so I used garlic salt and parsley and this chicken came out delicious. My herbs were also all store bought in containers because I rarely buy fresh herbs. Will mos def make again.

Eh, it was just ok. Pretty bland actually. The potatoes weren't really "crisp like french fries." They needed salt and ketchup to save them. The chicken was decent enough after you removed the fat. But unfortunately much of the seasoning was on the fat from which it was cooked in.

I used boneless skinless thighs and as  suggested by some reviewers, I cooked the potatoes for 15 minutes and then added the chicken for the remaining 45 minutes. I used some of the olive oil/herbs mixture for the chicken and I added some lemon juice and let stand while the potatoes were cooking. I added baby carrots. I think the fresh herbs are a must, as well as fresh garlic. As other stated, it was not that crispy but very flavorful.

Followed this recipe exactly and found it bland and unexciting.  It was crispy, and we enjoyed that aspect.  Next time more seasoning!

Very easy and quick. I made this for myself using one bone in chicken breast and one red potato cut into wedges. I placed both in the over for 45 mins and it came out perfect!

This is very good.  I used dried herbs, and used more than the 1/3 suggested.  I had to sub Idaho potatoes, which sometimes don't get cooked at the same time as the chicken when I bake the two together, but these were perfect.  I used my 10x15 stoneware pan so things weren't too crowded and I think that was key to the crispiness.

Very good!  I made a few changes, but it did not change much.  Before adding the chicken and potatoes into my baking dish, I added some salt, pepper, garlic powder, and parsley.  I just wanted to make sure the flavor was on all of the potatoes and chicken.  Then before putting it in the oven, I sprinkled the top with the rosemary, a little more garlic powder, salt, pepper, onion powder, and parsley.  I did cook it for an hour and 15 minutes.  My husband really liked this meal and I will definitely make this again!

YUM!!! Soooo very very good!! My husband and I love this!! We are now putting it into regular circulation for dinner. My only recommendations, don't put the potatoes in with the chicken, bake the chicken then broil the potatos so they get crispy, because they did not crisp with the chicken. Do not be afraid of adding to many spices. We did the fresh herbs and garlic, and added in the dry stuff to. We probably used the same amount of spices for 2 chicken breasts as you should have used for 6, but that was ok, it was awesome!! Very forgiving recipe.

Very crispy and flavorful but definitely NOT a healthy recipe!  I cut the olive oil down to 1/3 cup and the chicken was still swimming in it... If I make it again I will try 1/4 cup olive oil.

Not alot of flavor in this recipe.  Chicken didn't get really crispy but potatoes almost were over cooked. May try again but will definitely add more spices and flavoring.

I loved this recipe. I followed another review and marinated chicken and potatoes for an hour, then cooked potatoes for 30 min before adding chicken. I loved the fresh rosemary. I used dried oregano. The only complaint I got was that I used bone in thighs. I will use boneless breasts next time. Even my picky 3 year old ate this and asked for more.

I didn't like this at all. I love rosemary, so I really had high hopes for this. It was terribly oily and not nearly as crispy as we'd have liked. The potatoes were nicely cooked, but very bland. I thought as I was preparing it that it probably needed more, but I decided to stick to the recipe. Bad call. Everyone ate it, but it was disappointing for sure.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe considering all the rave reviews.  Maybe I shouldn't have placed the chicken on top of some diced onions and sliced carrots, but even the quartered potatoes seemed undercooked after an hour at 400 degrees. I had half skinless thighs and half skinless breast meat - it just didn't get crispy enough without using the broiler to top it off.

Easy, easy, easy!!! Everything goes into one pan, which made clean up very easy-which I like. The chicken came out nice and crispy, however, the potatoes didn't come out as crispy as I like but was still good. I had to add some seasoned salt to it in the end because the there was little flavor in the potatoes. Other than that this is a very easy and good dish to make for dinner.

Outstanding - a great meal on a busy weeknight!  My family loved it!  I did modify by substituting 6 cloves of garlic (instead of garlic powder) and added the juice of 1 lemon, 2 TB of Worcestershire, 2 leeks and 2 carrots.

We loved this recipe!  The potatoes and the fries came out wonderfully.  I put the chicken on one baking sheet and the potatoes on the other, just in case one cooked fast than the other, plus it gave everything a little bit of extra space.  We will make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy! Most of my family doesn't care for dark meat, and I couldn't get bone in chicken breasts, so I used Cornish Game hens.  I did follow other suggestions and soaked the hens in brine, and otherwise followed the original directions.  The hens were very moist and tender, and the "fries" came out nicely cooked and a bit crispy. Very nice and easy recipe.

This is such a simple, tasty recipe for chicken! I used half chicken thighs and half boneless skinless chicken breasts, and increased the amount of potatoes. I also added some chopped chives in with the topping. I loved how the chicken got that crispy, golden-brown and flavorful crust! My fries didn't really get crispy, but they were still very delicious. Thanks for sharing this one...I will make it again!

I really liked it- the fries were great, but the chicken did get a tad dry. However, I liked the crisp on the chicken. My husband didn't eat it, but I thought it was good!

I am in love with this recipe!! I followed the recipe exactly except I seasoned the chicken under the skin and used leg quarters instead of just thighs. I turned the oven off after one hour and took out the pan to remove the oil. I put the pan back into the oven for a couple more minutes while I finished everything else up. My mom raved about the chicken AND potatoes from the first bite to the last! Will definitely be making again and again! Thanks!

Easy and delicious.  My little ones (2 and 3) even like it.  I put the oven on convection for the last 15 min to help crisp and brown everything.  This recipe is good for winging it -- use whatever herbs you have/like.  It's also perfect the way it is!

This was good, not great.  I followed others reviews and used chicken breasts instead of thighs.  I cooked the potatoes for 30 min and then added the chicken for the last 30min.  The potatoes came out great, but the chicken was just ok.  It was moist but kind of bland.

I covered the bottom broiler pan with foil and cooked in that then popped under the broiler for a few minutes. Used bone in breasts.  I brined the chicken first (no sugar) then marinated in the evoo and rosemary for about 2 hours before cooking.

Was good and easy. Put everything in a big ziploc and shook it up. I used fresh garlic rather than powder.I also baked the potatoes for 30 minutes then added the chicken for a short time since I used chicken tenders.

5 stars for an adult meal but probably not so much for kids.  I loved the potatoes the most.  They were so good.  Next time I am adding more potatoes.

Not exactly what I'd call crispy, but tasted great nonetheless! I used fresh rosemary but dried oregano. Also subbed chicken legs for thighs. Will definately make this again!

good! I drizzled olive oil in the baking dish and then a little over the chicken thighs and potatoes (more over potatoes), then brushed the tops of chick with melted butter before seasoning. Very cripy and moist!

Hubby said this was a keeper and he liked the flavor... I used boneless skinnless thighs, but I'd like to have a nice crispy skin on next time... Also the potatoes didn't crisp even with the basting; still it was very good! :)

Very nice flavor.  I had to increase the recipe and only used dried herbs that I ground into a powder to sprinkle over the chicken and potatoes.

This dish was prepared with boneless, skinless chicken thighs and dried herbs. I used my convection oven so the chicken and potatoes were crisp.  I think it needed more (or I should have used fresh) herbs. I found it rather bland, and only one of my 6 children liked it.     Maybe marinating is the answer.  It was certainly easy, and I will try it again.

Really, really nice easy midweek meal.  I used chicken breast instead of thighs and I put the potatoes in for 20mins first then added the chicken to cook for 30mins.  Also added a splash of lemon.  Delish. Served with green beans, broccoli and as recommended - ketchup :)  Will be making again for sure.

Turned out well.  Chicken was moist on the inside, crispy on the outside with the taste of rosemary.  I was hoping to taste a little more of the garlic, will have to add more next time.  I enjoyed making preparing this meal and it was delicious.

One of the best main-dish recipes on this site!  I did change the recipe up by using bone-in chicken breasts instead of thighs, but only because that's what my family prefers; otherwise, I made this exactly as written, and it turned out to be a new favorite for all of us.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!  I can't wait to change it up with different vegetables now and then.

This was great and sooo easy.  I used dried herbs instead of fresh and I used a jelly roll pan for roasting.  My family likes highly seasoned food and we thought this had plenty of flavor.  To the reviewers who had problems with not being crisp enough, I think the jelly roll pan is the trick, you get more heat circulation with the low sides of the pan and it's bigger so you can spread things out.  The skin on the chicken was extremely crisp and the potatoes were very brown and crisp.

This was super easy & tasted great!  The changes that I made were 1) used boneless, skinless chicken breasts 2) used dried herbs 3) sprinkled just a small amount of grated parmesan cheese over chicken & potatoes.  In addition, I did use more eolive oil & herbs than the recipe called for.  The chicken was done before the potatoes, so I pulled it out and upped the oven temp a little to achieve a more cripsy tater.  Oh, I did also marinate the  chicken for about 2 hours before cooking too per the advice of other users.

I gave this four stars only because we weren't all THAT fond of the potatoes done this way. But the chicken -- the chicken was MARVELOUS! And it was so EASY! I made it first on a night when I had planned to make regular fried chicken, but decided I didn't want to deal with the mess. I had everything needed for this recipe on hand except olive oil. So I used vegetable oil, and it came out great! The next week I made it again (with olive oil this time), and we loved it again. I will definitely make this one a keeper.

Overall this is a great recipe, quick and easy tp prepare. Very versitial. I made a few additions to the recipe: 1T herbs de provence, 1/2 t dried parsley, 1/2 c sliced red peppers, 1/4 sliced green olives stuffed with garlic (kind I had on hand) and 1 small bag of baby carrots. My chicken and potatos did not get crispy. I used skinless thighs which maybe why. Next time I will added lemon slices and more salt and pepper.

Absolutely loved this. I marinated the chicken and taters in a bowl in the fridge for about an hour. Then popped the taters in the oven for 30 mins before adding the chicken. So delicious! Not to mention healthy. I will be making this often.

Simple, easy and delicious main course meal with very limited preparation and great results. I withhold one star because the potatoes don't really become fries when cooked with the chicken- be prepared for the tops of the potatoes to crisp up but the bottoms be soft (result of the chicken juices). However, taste is great and it's easily adaptable for fresh or dried herbs. I will certainly make this again.

This recipe is so easy to make and absolutely delicious -- especially for a one pan meal!  The only change I made (I know, the dreaded changes :) was to place cooling racks (that I use for cooling cookies) on the baking sheet and place the chicken and potatoes on that so they wouldn't sit in the grease.  The whole family loves it!

Yum! The chicken turned out too dry, but I know that was my fault, because all I had were breast tenders and I shouldnt have put them in for the full hour. I was feeling kind of lazy though. But the potatoes were excellent. I thought I had made enough for leftovers the next day, but there wasn't any! I'm adding this to my regular dinner menu.

I love the concept of a one dish meal and this recipe was great. I didn't reduce the amount of olive oil like other reviewers recommended and regretted not doing so. I also baked the dish an additional 20 minutes because I used 10 thighs and extra potatoes. I also broiled the dish for about 10 minutes on low. I will definitely make this dish again.

So quick and easy and delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and will definitely use again.  My husband doesn't eat much chicken and this was easy to decrease so that I didn't have a ton of leftovers.

It was really easy and fairly quick. I thought the potatos were great, but the chicken was a little bland. Not bad though and we would definatly make it again, probably trying some alterations to the orginal.

I cut the olive oil to 1/4 c. since like was mentioned, thighs create there own oil.  I also used dried rosemary and oregano and doubled them.  The potatoes had a very pleasant chicken flavor to them (used Yukon Gold), but otherwise was kind of bland.  Next time I will season the potatoes separately and completely cut out the oil. (I also bet some Parmesan cheese on the top of the potatoes would be good).

Great base recipe, but I added a few things...I wrapped the chicken thighs in prosciutto and cut the olive oil in half. Added fresh garlic and onions to the potatoes. Next time, I will marinate the chicken before to add a little extra flavour and will add sweet potatoes. My three kids loved it - which doesn't happen often!!

I used bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs and they turned out nicely. Juicy. The potatoes on the other hand were not good at all. They had almost no flavor and were not crispy. I took them out of the oven and put them in a frying pan, sprinkled Tony's on them and made delicious home fries very quickly because they were already cooked.  It does give a good starting point for any easy one pan meal.

This was very, very simple and good.  I added 1 pound of halved fresh mushrooms and used russet potatoes.  It got a little watery (from the mushrooms) and I had to pour some of the liquid off to crisp up the potatoes.

Love it!  I skipped the olive oil & herbs and just used salt & pepper to taste.  I also made mashed potatoes instead of the fries.  It was fantastic and I'm sure I will make this many times over!

This was okay. I strayed a little bit from the original recipe and used fresh basil instead of rosemary. Not very flavorful but that was probably my fault. The chicken was very tender and the potatoed tasted really good but nothing came out crispy, even so family liked it so I guess that's what counts.

The potatoes were so delicious! I used thin chicken breasts, as that is what I had, and it came out a tad dry, so next time I will make sure to use thicker cuts of chicken. No matter though, as the taste was yummy!

excellent starter recipe - fantastic to make changes and additions to.

The potatoes, alone, make a fantastic side dish!


Thank you!!

Good recipe!  I made it in my slow cooker and added a little paprika, but otherwise followed recipe as shown.

Wonderful aroma while cooking; a little too oily but otherwise a very good meal.

Wow - this was a great recipe that I will be using over and over again.   I used chicken thighs.   I also used half garlic oil and half olive oil to add a bit more flavor.   When seasoning I seasoned both sides of the chicken.   Because they were thighs the other side had no skin and seasoning this enhanced the flavor also.   I baked in uncovered and the potatoes and chicken were crispy and wonderful tasting.

Very simple and easy meal to make.  It probably would have come out tastier if I would have put spices under the skin. (I don't eat the skin) so it was a bit bland.  Next time I will pull up the skin, put spices on chicken and replace the skin to keep moisture in.

We enjoyed this recipe. i used dried herbs and cooked for less time. My oven cooked it way faster for some reason. The chicken wasn't that crispy but still very good. The potatoes were great.

The flavors are good but you need more potatoes. I used skinless chicken breasts, which I think it would have been better with the thighs as stated in the recipe. Simple just not wowing.
