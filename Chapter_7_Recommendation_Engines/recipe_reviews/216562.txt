This casserole is delicious. I recommend only baking for 35 minutes. I found 50 to be too long. Thank you for the recipe.

AWESOME!  I made this for Christmas breakfast and EVERYONE loved it.  I made it again on New Years morning from memory (it's pretty easy) and left out a couple things on accident.  The original is perfect!

This was just alright, I think it just needs a sauce, maybe hollandaise?

I've made this twice, and everyone loved it! Try it with asparagus, which goes well with salmon

Big hit for Christmas brunch!! I left out the green onions (some people were not onion fans), used a lb. of smoked salmon, cream instead of milk and baked at 350 for 50 minutes.  A special dish (not your ordinary casserole) for a special day!

I made this Christmas morning and it was delicious! I found the baking time was a bit too long and too high.  I would recommend 40 mins on 375. The flavors really compliment each other.  I will make this recipe again and again!

Made this dish today for Sunday brunch with my daughter....delicious but made a few changes...used red onion and added a teaspoon of red wine vinegar and a teaspoon of sugar when cooking the onions/garlic.  Substituted shredded sharp cheddar instead of swiss and agree that it cooks up perfectly at between 25-30 minutes at 400 degrees.  Would have been burned at 50...other than that, it was delicious.  I will make it again.

I made this for a holiday brunch with 8 guests.  I changed the recipe a bit, in addition to the 6 split croissants I add 2 or 3 more, which I tore completely into little pieces .  I layered as directed, but  added steamed asparagus, only used shredded Swiss and mozzarella cheese, which I didn't measure, but it was at least a total of 3 cups cheese. I increased the smoked salmon to a full  pound.  I used 14 eggs and 3 extra egg whites, 1 cup whole cream, then decided that I should put about 1/2 cup milk to egg batter.   I topped it all with the 6 croissant tops I reserved, and let sit over night in the fridge.  Next morning I let sit on counter for an hour to bring closer to room temp. I am only citing the changes I made, all other ingredients stayed the same, except I omitted any added salt.   As others suggested, I reduced cook time to 35 min at 400 degrees Fahrenheit.  Oh my goodness!! It was delish!  Everyone raved and had more than one serving . There was very little left over.   We called it smoked salmon souffl√© because it was so light, yet rich!  I'll have to seriously stick to my diet for a long time to make up for it, but it was so worth it!

Recipe is DELISH! Followed guidance of other reviewers and cooked for :35 rather than :50. Substituted soy milk, shredded soy cheese and egg whites for eggs and cow's milk and cheese. Thanks for sharing! Will absolutely make again for holidays and guest brunches.

This casserole is fabulous!  I reduced the amount of cheese and omitted the green onions.  Dried dill worked just fine.  Also reduced the oven temperature to 350 degrees.  A definite keeper!

I served this for brunch for company and it was good but not quite a hit.  If I have company, I will probably make it again but probably not use as much of the croissant.  It had a little to much bread, but I didn't cube the bottom of the croissants as the recipe called for.

I loved this recipe! Made it for Easter Breakfast at church and received many positive comments. I doubled the recipe because I was using a REALLY large pan. Omitted the green onions, and used exclusively Monterey Jack cheese. Those were my only changes, and it was delicious.

I made this for a post-Thanksgiving brunch for family and it was a hit! This is a unique and beautiful dish that is delicious! I concur that 35 min seems to be a perfect baking time. I brushed the top of the casserole with about 1/4 stick of butter after taking out of oven and added fresh pepper. 
A really delightful recipe- thanks or sharing!

OMG, this is sooooooo good. I was worried that the ingredients wouldn't be evenly incorporated if I layered the ingredients as instructed, so I combined everything (minus the croissants) in the egg mixture. I did not tear the croissant bottoms as instructed, instead I ensured that to bottoms and tops of the croissants were aligned, which made for a nice presentation on Christmas morning. Like other reviewers, I found the 50 minute cook time to be too long, the casserole baked in 35 minutes for me. Finally, I STRONGLY suggest serving this with a hollandaise sauce (I made a Swiss Hollandaise) to make this recipe out of this world!

I made this for a Church breakfast, in between services and I was told that this breakfast casserole was the favorite. I think I might try adding asparagus, as suggested, because that goes well with salmon.

I executed a trial bake for my husband prior to the main event for guests. It turned out well, however, I will make a few changes for our upcoming Christmas Brunch. Found using full size croissants made portion sizes too filling. Given it will be part of a buffet, I‚Äôll use mini croissants. I set it to bake for 30 minutes,however, after 20 minutes, it started to burn on top. It got two thumbs up from my taste tester aka hubby.

I make this all the time. I put Mushrooms or  broccoli in this as well. I like the golden brown finish but definitely keep your eye on the time. So good and is one of my go to dishes for breakfast when I have guests

This was delicious but I made some changes, mostly to speed up prep. I didn't cook the onions and garlic - since there are green onions in the recipe, I wasn't worried about it. In the bowl with the eggs and milk, I added the dill, minced garlic, and green onions. I tore up the croissants, threw on an Italian cheese blend rather than 3 different cheeses, the smoked salmon, a little more cheese, and then poured the egg mixture over everything. I topped the casserole with more croissants. I baked it at 400 for 30 minutes, covering it for the last ten. I let it sit for about 10 minutes before serving.

I made the 'mistake' of bringing this to a breakfast potluck at work. Now everyone wants these potlucks to be a weekly thing so I'll keep bringing this dish. Note: Definitely use fresh dill! I tried once with the dried stuff from the spice rack, and it was a fail.

I baked it for 30 minuets anything longer would murder this dish.  I also used a bison/venison/pork-fat sausage - Delicious.  Im going to try it with crawfish next month when they are in season.

We made this for Christmas brunch. Everyone loved it, even people who normally don't like smoked salmon. Instead of buying each cheese individually, we used a habanero mix, which also added some heat, which we liked. Keep an eye on it, as we needed to reduce the baking time since the croissant tops were getting overdone. It was delicious! We received many requests for the recipe! Thank you :)

Used 35 minutes - perfect cook time.  Did only half of recipe and worked fine.  You can modify the cheeses.  I did not use ricotta - only used swiss and cheddar.  Lowered temp also to 350 not to overcook.  Would be nice to add a filet of hollandaise on top to add additional flavor and moisture.
