I used oat bran & whole wheat pita bread, added a few olive slices, and since I had no roma tomatoes on hand, just sliced some grape tomatoes which worked fine.  Using pesto sauce as a base is flavorful, but I found pre-cooking the pita bread for 8 minutes was too long; the timing may have something to do with the type of pita bread you use.  I ended up with a “crispy/crunchy” pita pizza, so I will cut that time back to 2-3 minute next time.  But I liked it, it definitely is quick and easy to make, and tasted good for lunch today!

Pretty Good. My own twist is to first brush the Pita bread with some Pizza-Sauce you can buy premade at the store. Then the Pesto Sauce, Tomatoes (what ever variety is on hand), and Mozarella. I usually use an 8" Cast Iron Pan w/Lid on the stove top. About 10-15 min on med-low. Quick & Easy 1-2 person dinner.

I like this recipe because nowhere else could I find the obvious pesto-for-sauce idea that made perfect sense to me.  I kept it lazy, used a prepared pizza crust, fresh tomatoes and sliced up a ball of mozzarella. I did use fresh basil leaves, chopped garlic, and Italian seasoning, drizzled with olive oil and it was heavenly.  So easy, so tasty. It was done in 10 minutes.
