This was an excellent recipe!!! I soaked my venison strips in milk overnite as suggested by another reviewer. I made these to take to our church Super Bowl party and they were gone before the first quarter was over! Now my sons and husband want me to make all our venison with this recipe. I also reduced to amount of mustard and added honey. WONDERFUL

I served these at a party and they were eaten before I could get them to the buffet table! Easy to prepare and great tasting. I soaked my venison in milk overnight to tenderize the venison. I drained it before cooking. I plan to use this recipe again at a company party.

Absolutely fabulous! I soaked the meat in a combination of milk and Worcestershire sauce for about 30 minutes prior to cooking. I also substituted 1 cup of panko for the flour. Cooked the meat only 3 minutes at 350 degrees as I was using backstrap and didn't want it to toughen from overcooking. The taste was heavenly! Very tender meat and the dipping sauce was a delight to the tongue! Highly recommended!

We've never been so excited to eat venison (and I've had to eat it for over 30 years - oh my gosh, I now feel so old). Anyway, great, great taste. However, 1/2 the flour mixture and immediately take 1/2 of it out and store it in a Ziploc bag in the fridge until you want to use it again. The original recipe would probably coat 10 lbs of meat - seriously, don't make that much, and you can't save it after you drag the egg coated pieces through it. But, this recipe is awesome for those of us eating venison and it is REALLY easy. Oh, I also added probably 1/2 to a whole tablespoon of honey to the dipping sauce. It's good with or without it, but it does have quite a 'bite' without the honey - just depends on how 'wild' you want to be that night...

I'm not a big fan of venison to start with, but this was pretty good. I made a few changes to make it a bit healthier. I replaced 2/3 cup of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour and baked the strips instead of deep frying.

To bake: preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. After coating strips, arrange them in a single layer, leaving a little space between each. Spray the strips with non-stick, fat free cooking spray to moisten. Bake 15-20 minutes until golden brown and slightly crispy. Check on them every 5 minutes.

For the dipping sauce, I would recommend mixing the brown sugar and mustard together before heating or you may end up with a crystalized sugar mess like I did. 

Also, I ended up with a lot of extra flour mixture and dipping sauce. Could probably cut amount of ingredients in half and still have plenty. Or increase venison steaks to 2 pounds.

Thank you for the recipe MBC.

These were yummy. At first my boyfriend said that I needed to get his family recipe, because they were no where close. So, I tweaked the second batch - sprinkling them with a little worchestershire sauce as they cooled and cooking them for a shorter time. They only need a few minutes for small strips (not 10 minutes), the batch that I pulled out just when they started to turn a little gold was much better - crunchy but not tough.

I used shredded italian cheese simply because that was what I had on hand, added a lot of honey to the mustard mix since that is a personal preference, and cooked the deer a little different. I baked mine for 15 minutes at 375, then finished them off by frying them for maybe a minute. This left them nice and crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside. They didn't taste gamey at all, delish!

Excellent recipe. As few recommended, I marinated the venison in 1 cup of milk and 3T of Worcestershire for an hour. I also used 1/2 cup of Flour and 1/2 cup of Parmesan Cheese. 2 cups of flour and 1-1/2 cup of Parmesan is way too much. I added a dash of Chipotle Rub, Garlic Powder and Paprika. I put a small dot of Butter on the strips before baking. As few recommended, I baked the coated strips on the 3rd rack in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Great and easy recipe. 
I will try frying next time.  1/2 cup of mustard and 1/2 cup of brown sugar is enough dipping sauce. I will add 1T of honey next time.

fantastic! doubled the breading recipe.  use a tenderizer to soften the meat.  the honey mustard is to die for, beats any store bought or restuarant by a long shot.  great for pot lucks or to watch the game.  i used an electric skillet and just flipped them to save oil instead of deep frying.  enjoy!

I used Elk instead of deer steak. I also took note of some of the recommendations from the other reviewers. I used Italian Breadcrumbs with the Parmesan cheese and I added a little salt to the mix. For the dipping sauce I also added honey in with the brown sugar and mustard. This was VERY good. I think the dipping sauce is was made it so good for the kiddos. I am not a big fan of Elk or Deer meat so I am always trying new ways to prepare it and this is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing MBC!

I'm giving this 4 stars just for the fact that I don't like meals that seem to take forever to cook but quick to eat.  I think if I'd have pounded the venison first it would've been more tender.  I used the bottom round roast from the deer.  My husband said it was very good.  The kids liked it but would prefer ranch or honey mustard to dip.  My daughter just about burnt the brown sugar when she put the mustard in.  Overall, we would make it again but pound the meat to tenderize and use a different dip.

These were delicious-I do agree that the flour mixture could be cut down at least for the amount that I normally cook.

I do NOT like venison. But preparing it this way adds enough flavor that you don't notice the gamey taste. I will be making this again.  I cooked them in the over, per healthymom's suggestion, and it seemed to work well. I also think that you could divide the flour mixture in half or even into a third of what the directions say. We had tons left over, and couldn't store it for next time (because of the egg), so we ended up having to toss it. Very wasteful.

SOOOOO good! And the dipping sauce is excellent. I use it for chicken nuggets as well. For the dipping sauce I add just a little drop of honey.

The Italian seasoning is somewhat overpowering.  I would use half of the suggested amount..  These were ok, but I like my husband's coating and seasonings better.  I also used my own dipping sauce recipe.

Why eat venison if you're going to ruin it by soaking it in milk! it's venison, it should taste like it, if you want it to taste like beef, eat beef!

Decent recipe, especially for the bits and pieces leftover after butchering. Instead of flour I used some lemon pepper fish fry I had in the pantry. Pile on the pepper, little bit of salt and eat up!

I divide this recipe exactly in half and have enough to make 2 lbs of venison for my large family of boys.  I keep it in a ziploc and never contaminate it and always have just a little left over (enough to start frying while I make a new batch). This is a great recipe I have used time and again.  Enjoy!

My family loved these.  It's now a regular at our house...until we run out of venison!.  I serve them with a variety of dipping sauces. Some of our favorites are mango, sweet & spicy mustard, chipotle aioli, spicy ginger.

I am new to cooking venison. I made this for my boyfriend and we LOVED it. We cut up the fingers and had them over a salad. We'll make this again for our company.

I wasn't sure about this when I saw it....but I can honestly say that this has to be one the most awesome things ever created!! I've pretty much used up all my deer steaks on this recipe. I'm spreading the word on this one! Thanks for sharing!!

I'd suggest wrapping it with bacon and grilling it instead.
