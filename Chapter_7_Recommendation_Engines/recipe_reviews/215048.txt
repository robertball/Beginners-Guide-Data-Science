This ice cream is good. No - I mean, this ice cream is GOOOOD. Holy moly, I never expected it to be this delicious!  I've never had the Caramel Macchiato drink (although I just may be tempted to now), so I have no clue if this ice cream tastes like it, but I'm telling you, unless you really detest coffee you will love this. No, I take that back - even if you don't like coffee, you will love this. The pairing of caramel and coffee flavors is just simply, dreamy delicious - something new for me. I like my ice cream rich (and most often with eggs) so I used half-and-half instead of the milk. Also, I've made ice cream often enough to know that a full cup of sugar would be waaaay too sweet, so I cut it back to 3/4 cup and it was simply perfect.  In fact, everything about this ice cream is simply perfect!  It is so rich, creamy and gooey it needs no topping or any other embellishment.  I didn't even wait for it to ripen (harden) in the freezer before eating it.  Because after trying a taste of it, I couldn't.

This ice cream isn't even frozen yet and we are having a hard time staying out of the freezer. I cut the sugar back to about 3/4 cup and used about 1/2 cup homemade caramel sauce. I can't wait for it to freeze. Mmmmmmmm.

We just made this along with 4 other flavors of homemade ice cream and this was our favorite! I found some instant coffee at the store that came in single serve packets and it was hazelnut flavored! I think that added to the greatness of this wonderful recipe! It took 4 single serve packs to make 2 tbsn. We mixed thick caramel topping into the ice cream just before putting into the freezer. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

I made this for my coffee-loving husband, whose favorite drink at the coffee shop is a caramel macchiato.  Personally, I don't drink coffee, nor do I really enjoy ice cream.  But after making this, I had to give it a taste, and Naples was right - even if you don't love coffee, you will like this ice cream.  I had a tiny bite, and another bite, and another....  My husband said that it is so much better than the caramel macchiato ice cream from the store.  Compliments to the recipe submitter - this one is definitely a hit in this house!

Shut up! I love this. I am the happiest pregnant woman in the all the world right now. I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead and heavy cream and it is so amazing. Yum. Thanks!

I just bought an ice cream maker last week and tried to make this ice cream this weekend, but unfortunately it didn't work well.. I don't know what's going wrong, but the ice cream wasn't thicken even though it had been churned in the machine for 1.5 hrs :( . I was so brokenhearted since I've tasted the mixture and it's sooo delicious. 
Has anybody faced same problem with me and found how to fix that?

I used to work at Starbucks, so I know how this SHOULD be done... 
I made half coffee ice-cream and half vanilla ice-cream... I fashioned a couple dividers for my container so that it looked kinda like this -> ( || ) from the top and tapered down to look like this \ V / from the side (so the caramel doesn't pool at the bottom)
then I poured the coffee icecream on one side, and vanilla on the other -> (C||V) 
then I poured chilled caramel in between the two dividers... then chill in the freezer for a short time... like 5 mins, to let the caramel just start to set... 
then, carefully, pull out the two dividers, and run your stirrer (chopstick, knife, w/e) back and forth across the three flavors so that your caramel goes from this -> || to looking like this -> {{ ...ish

With these changes, it was DELICIOUS aaannnd Accurate!

of course, after it hardened in the freezer, I served this with a little more caramel drizzle on the top!

OMG, this rocks!  Despite loving ice cream, I don’t make ice cream all that often, I have a tendency to make sorbets more often than I do ice creams.  But this ice cream is out of this world, it’s full of fat, sugar and flavor, everything you want in an ice cream, ha!  I think it’s even great without the caramel sauce, which is why I didn’t get a full batch the first time, yes I said first time, I made it.  I kept dipping the spoon into the ice cream maker before it was even done!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe with us, now if you’ll excuse me, I need another dish full!

An ice cream luver’s delight. Used half & half instead of milk, and reduced sugar to 3/4 cup. We’ve made this ice cream a few times. We have used pasteurized heavy cream as well as the more readily available ultra pasteurized. Since no cooking is involved in this non-custard based ice cream, the pasteurized will be fresher tasting (although having an appreciably shorter shelf life). It’s great either way but if it’s a matter of choosing one from the shelf versus the other, DON’T pick the ultra pasteurized. We found it at Whole Foods. We used Sanders Classic Caramel Dessert Topping but hope to also use Chef John’s Salted Caramel Sauce from this site. We have a Cuisinart 2 qt. ice cream maker, and doubling this recipe filled it close to the top but didn’t run over when freezing. Reviewers overwhelmingly love this ice cream, and you will too!!

This is wonderful. We made this all summer long last year. I think the best mix was half heavy cream and half & half. We made real caramel sauce and added heath bars to it too.

Can I give this 10 stars??? The best ice cream I have ever had, the only thing I changed was I used 1 cup of half and half instead of milk. I will never buy ice cream from the grocery store ever again. This was so simple and so delicious!

My family and I weren't overly crazy about this recipe. My first problem was that, even though I mixed the milk and sugar VERY well, when the ice cream was done, I could feel the sugar in my mouth. If I make this again, I'll dissolve the sugar in the milk on the stove like other recipes call for. Another thing was that the caramel pretty much just dissolved in the ice cream. (I used Smuckers Caramel ice cream topping) I layered it in a container like the directions say, and after a few hours in the freezer, I couldn't even see the caramel. The ice cream didn't taste much like caramel, it ended up just tasting waayy too sweet, even though I backed off on the white sugar.

Oh my goodness! I don't drink coffee but let me tell you I loved this ice cream. It has a beautiful flavour and remains scoop-able, creamy, so delicious with that caramel sauce in every bite. I did have to add a bit extra caramel sauce to my individual servings because like other reviewers my caramel topping sank to the bottom of the container. I used my own homemade caramel sauce recipe for this so it was definitely a thicker caramel topping. I followed this recipe exactly and found the sugar content to be perfect for my tastes. I will definitely be making this ice cream again! Thanks for sharing.

My fiance and I love this ice cream! It's so easy and you can play with it a little to get it to your liking. I actually made mine with splenda but you could probably use truvia (which is the better substitute now) and it was still very good. I did have to wait a little bit to have it reach a good consistency after putting it in my ice cream maker.  This is perfect for the coffee lover and I would go as far to say even someone that only moderately likes coffee would enjoy this- it's THAT GOOD!

I am having a hard time not eating the entire batch of this one! Oh my... :) My favorite Starbucks drink happens to be a caramel macchiato, so I figured i might enjoy this treat. I took the tip from Naples and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup, and I'm glad I did, as the caramel contributes plenty of sweetness. I used my own homemade caramel sauce and half/half in place of the milk. This is SO creamy and delicious!

I wish I could give this 10 stars--oh my goodness, this is so-o-o good!  I made it for my daughter's birthday, and she didn't believe it was home made ice cream. My grandson said it was better than Starbuck's!  I followed the suggestions of some reviewers and used half and half instead of milk and I also added the Heath bar bits as another reviewer suggested.  This was an easy, decadent recipe and I will definitely be making it again.  Thanks for sharing!

Fabulous!  Didn't have caramel sauce, so left it out for plain coffee ice cream.  I followed another's suggestion and used only 3/4 cup sugar and that was perfect.  I was too impatient to wait the two hour minimum for chill time, so just chilled 45 minutes, whisking about 1/2 way through.  Delicious!  I'll definitely be making this again!

I made this Sunday for our Labor Day get together.  Everyone loved it!  Well, the adults, anyway.  Next time I think I'll sub fudge for the dessert sauce and add almonds.

So delicious!  I warmed the milk with the sugar, which it does not say to do, but I wanted the sugar totally dissolved. (I used splenda blends and didn't taste the after taste. Just wanted to keep the calorie count a little lower there because I went to town on the caramel!) I had a minor problem with the caramel swirl - you don't want to put it directly into the ice cream machine because it will melt, so the best way to handle it is as directed - layer ice cream and caramel. I used Sander's Butterscotch Caramel, which is kind of pricey and not available everywhere, but the taste is supreme. Next time I will layer, swirl, layer, swirl, instead of loading it and then swirling. I had some globs of caramel instead of a lovely swirl throughout. I also, will not refrigerate the caramel before using it in this ice cream. Either it will be new, or it will be room temp!! All in all, it was wonderful!! I wanted to make it again immediately as soon as it was gone, but am showing restraint and will wait a few days...

made homemade caramel sauce and tossed it in when it was still warm so although no swirly caramel appearance, the flavor was the same. YUM!

Oh YUM! I'm not so much a fan of the drink, but love coffee ice cream so I figured I'd give this a go. I used FF half and half instead of milk because I wanted a creamier ice cream, but otherwise kept the ice cream portion of the recipe the same. I chilled in the fridge for 4 hours, then processed it in my kitchen aid with the ice cream attachment. While it was going and I was digging through my cabinet for the caramel, I had a stroke of delicious evil genius...I used Nutella instead of the caramel! I nuked about 4 TBSP to melt and stirred THAT into the ice cream. My husband is sitting next to me licking the bowl. 5 stars from him!

This is the most delicious ice cream I've ever tasted and is so easy to put together. I took the excellent advice of other reviewers and cut back the sugar to 3/4 cup and used half and half instead of the milk. I also added 3 small packs of Starbucks Italian Roast instant coffee (which is equivalent to the 2 tbsp of instant coffee granules called for in the recipe) added a bit more caramel sauce and chopped a chocolate toffee candy bar into the mix after the ice cream finished processing.  Oh, so heavenly. Fantastic recipe!!!

This was about perfect - although I prefer a cooked ice cream recipe - this still turned out great! I made homemade caramel drizzle to stir in once the ice cream was churned. Excellent flavor.

Absolutely delicious!  I would advise to maybe chill the caramel sauce for a bit so it pours thicker.  Mine seemed to want to drop to the bottom.

Hands down...the best ice cream I have ever made!  This tastes exactly like my fav drink!  I even had my four year old son try it and he loved it!  
I made the mixture last night and let it sit in the fridge overnight....put it in the ice cream maker this morning and honestly I dont even want to wait for it to harden at all...I want to eat it all now!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Amazing! I made this for a party at work once and everyone loved it! Except for the anti-coffee drinkers. I used Gevalvia coffee grounds instead of instant coffee. These grounds are so fine that it didn't affect the texture, but added tremendously to the taste!

Simply amazing. It took a few days to set up for me - which might have been my ice cream machine more than anything - but even at a soft serve consistency, it was hands-down the most delicious ice cream I've ever made. The caramel is absolutely optional, and is awesome with or without.

FANTASTIC!!  This recipe is so good.  The flavors are so good together.  My only regret, my ice cream maker only makes two quarts at a time!  The kids loved it too! I used the Smucker's "Hot Carmel" flavor ice cream topping because it's the taste of real butter carmel.  (Do not heat it for this recipe.)

I loved this ice cream, but For some reason my ice cream stayed super soft even after being in the freezer for a long time. the caramel sunk to the bottom, but next time I'd leave the caramel out just because the ice cream alone is soooooo good.

This was soooooo good.  The texture was very smooth and creamy.  I used the whole cup of sugar and next time I will definitely cut it down to 3/4 cup.  I'll probably skip the caramel step and just drizzle it on top when I serve it because all the caramel ended up on the bottom of the ice cream tub.

This ice cream was out of this world. I used my own caramel sauce (sugar+water+butter+whole cream) and reduced by 1/4 the amount of sugar and it was fantastic. My guests are coming later tonight, I hope I'll have some of it left for them ;-) Thanks for this outstanding recipe !!

I cut back the sugar to 3/4 cup because it was too sweet.  I also use 1 cup heavy cream and 2 cups of half and half and omit the milk.

Sooo good! Added about a 1/8 tsp sea salt just because I tasted a salted caramel ice cream before and loved it. Like other reviewers said, I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and used half and half instead of milk. It came out very creamy. I also swirled some dark chocolate sauce that I had left over from another dessert we made. Delicious with or without it.

Even though I modified this some (cut down the sugar to 3/4c and the carmel to 1/2c) it was still super sweet to me. But all 3 of the guys loved it and as they are the sweet lovers, all three voted 5 stars. I may lower it another notch next time and see if that helps me :)

I made this for my bf, who likes both caramel and coffee. It tasted pretty good, considering that I am not a big fan of caramel or coffee.  I like the rich flavor of the ice cream. My bf liked it.

yummy! didn't have instant coffee so i steeped 3 tbs fresh ground coffee in the milk and added the sugar and salt. heavy cream cooled it back down. followed advice of others and only used 3/4 cup sugar. there is always a little bit left in the core...my husband very thoroughly cleaned it out. will definitely add to my book.

I think I've died and gone to Ice cream heaven. This ice cream really is wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly, its so easy to make. Ive had this sitting in the freezer for two days just because I made it in advance to take to a friends house for dessert (serving it with a raspberry Tiramisu). The ice cream is so easy to scoop nice and soft. Of course I had to try a small bowl as a sample , now I'm tempted to eat it all!!!

I made this without an ice cream maker. and I too put the caramel sauce in with everything. Mixed/shook it up real well..Let it freeze for 2 hours....before I went to bed, I shook it and stirred it up again, let it freeze over night and it was PERFECT! THE BEST COFFEE ICE CREAM EVER, puts Starbuck's to shame. Heavy cream is the key, I think I may have used a bit more than this recipe called for....only to use up what I had. VERY creamy hard ice cream! SO GOOD!!!

This was my first attempt at making Ice Cream and I was amazed how easy it was.  The ice cream had a strong coffee flavor to me but that was just fine.  I mixed the carmel in at the end of the churning cycle and it seemed to have mixed in pretty well with the ice cream.  I served the ice cream over a brownie and drizzled more carmel sauce on top.  It got rave reviews from my dinner guests.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this ice cream, and it was really simple to make. I didn't have the ingredients for the caramel sauce, so I added cinnamon and a dash of vanilla extract (I wanted it to resemble a latte in "ice cream form"). Wow! I've made in since with the caramel, chocolate chunks, and with vanilla only. My favorite way, though is still the cinnamon-vanilla variation. I highly suggest it. Also, this recipe can be tweaked. For less fat, you can use half and half instead of heavy cream, or reduced fat milk instead of whole. It all works really well.

Amazing and easy!!! Definitely add less sugar, I did a little less than a cup and it was still too much. I also added roasted chopped hazelnuts and it was a nice addition. The caramel was mixed in a little too much so I'll watch that more carefully next time. Thank you!!

This is a great recipe.  To make it even better I added 6 tablespoons of instant coffee and 8 tempered eggs.  I also lowered the sugar to 2/3c.

Really Outstanding!!! Made according to directions. This one will be a keeper. I used a caramel dip which gave thicker clumps of caramels throughout. Next time, I would use a caramel sauce as directed or leave out. This makes an incredible standalone coffee ice cream!

This is a scoop of heavenly Bliss.
I will make this forevermore...
I used 3 table spoons of instant espresso coffee.
And I STEAMED my milk for the dissolving of the sugar, and the coffee .
Also only used 3\4 cup of sugar .
Warning : Do not eat before bed time . You might stay up and finish all of the rest of the ice cream.

Oh my goodness!  This ice cream is dangerous!!  You will not be able to eat just one bite!!  Yum! Yum! Yum!  The only change I made was to heat the milk mixture to totally dissolve the sugar and coffee chunks.  I chilled the mix for two hours and then added the cream.  Outstanding!!  So creamy and wonderful!!  Will be making this one for our church ice cream social next week!  Thanks Dana for sharing!

This deserves more than 5 stars.  It is heavenly.  I have always loved coffee ice cream. I used to buy Stroh's coffee ice cream   I think this is much better and so easy to make. I made this using 3/4 c of sugar. The only milk I had was almond unsweetened and it worked beautifully with the cream.  I do not want the syrup, JUST GIVE ME COFFEE ICE CREAM.  I,m in heaven now. Thanks for the recipe. I'd like to pat you on the back and give you 5 more stars

This ice cream was so wonderful! I made it for my dad, him and his brother ate the whole batch over a few days. Definitely a keeper, may try adding some toffee pieces when mixing in the caramel. Can't wait to make this over and over again!

I didn't have instant coffee so I substituted with equal amount of coffee extract. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of hazelnut extract. Instead of the caramel sauce I used hazelnut spread and dulce de leche spread. It tasted so good! One caveat is that if it's hot outside and you are making it in a kitchen that's not air conditioned, be sure to put the container you are using to swirl in the caramel in the freezer ahead of time. Otherwise your ice cream will melt before you can open the lid of your caramel sauce bottle!

I got an ice cream machine a couple of weeks ago and tried this based on the reviews.  Um, it's sooooo good!!!  My husband doesn't like caramel so we didn't add that (but I have some and am going to add it to the next batch).  This is definitely going to be a staple (in fact, I bought a big container of instant coffee just so I can make this whenever I want).

I have made this recipe twice and we love it!!  One of our most favorites - rich and creamy.  I have an old ice cream maker that I bought at a garage sale for $3.00 - doesn't need rock salt and is a joy to use.  Called "Deni"  Simple and easy - keep canister in freezer until ready to use, put canister on its base, pour in chilled ice cream mixture, turn on and it mixes until it reaches consistency you like.  So simple!

I have this ice cream freezing in my ice cream maker right now. I have made it about 15 times now and it is so good. I figured since it was a frozen version of a caramel macchiato, I would use that famous coffee shop's instant coffee, Via. I use their Italian roast, because I like a little more bite in my coffee to blend with the sweetness of the caramel. If you want it to taste closer to the shop's version, use the French roast. The regular or decaf work just as nicely. I keep two bowls freezing at all times. This is the first one I make, my go to ice cream now. Sometimes I make a double batch of caramel macchiato ice cream and sometimes I make another flavor. We love this!

I took a bite before I put it in the freezer to harden and it was heaven! Unfortunately the kiddos left it sitting on the counter and was ruined before I could get more.  So I went out and bought more supplies to make again!  I did add a tsp of vanilla to make it a little more decadent and changed up the milk (1 c heavy cream to 1 c half and half and 1 cup 1% milk) b/c that is what I had on hand. LOVED IT!  Will try with chocolate sauce instead of caramel, too.

This was delicious! I put in half a cup of sugar plus a tsp of vanilla and it tasted divine. Even non-coffee lovers thought it tasted fantastic. Well done to the recipe submitter!

It is a very good recipe. I found it on this site last summer and i was making this ice cream on a regular basis ever since. The only slight change i made - i don't add caramel.

Wow, this is so good but it is a bit sweet with the full amount of sugar.  I am going to cut it back a bit the next time.

I changed the ingredients a bit...1% organic milk, 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup half and half and then did half splenda/half sugar to make it a bit healthier. ;)  The ice cream was yummy but had a bitter coffee aftertaste for hours even from just tasting it.  Not sure if it was the brand coffee granules or what but I almost had heartburn from it.

I used the bag method to freeze this..the ice cream itself is good but not as strong as I'd like & I added double the coffee. Would possibly make it again though..was tasty

Tastes just like my favorite expresso drink! It's a little sweeter than I expected, even with everyone elses comments... but I am a major sweet tooth so this was not a bad thing. I tasted this before the addition of the caramel and it's even good as a plain coffee ice cream! I will definitely make this again.

My Fav Caramel Macchiato ice cream used to be from Starbucks. not anymore!!!!  This recipe is literally delicious to the point of no return. You just wanna keep eating and eating and eating and you ate everything you ate, you want to make another badge! :) Second time i made this ice cream, i increased the amount of coffee i used and it had stronger coffee flavor, which is my favorite. Thank you for sharing!

great recipe!  i used all whole milk.  and thought it was fabulous so if you use the cream i'm sure it's even better.  served with the 'blonde brownies I' from this site.  so, so good!  they compliment each other perfectly!

I made this for company this past weekend and got rave reviews!  Lucky for me, there were leftovers for the following night.  I followed the recipe and let the mixture chill overnight before freezing it.  So good and so easy!
