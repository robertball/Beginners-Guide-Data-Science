I was a doubter, but now I believe! The puff pastry and sun dried tomatoes are the star, and this pizza is a refreshing change from the standard pie. The 'puff' makes for a delicate crust and requires that you cut it into small pieces. I forgot to poke holes in the dough and it poofed up until it cooled. The only thing I did different from the recipe was leave out the Gorgonzola (I didn't have any). If you like sun dried tomatoes then you need to try it for your next snooty, high-falutin' party...if you've never tasted sun dried tomatoes then you need to try it!

The sun-dried tomatoes and gorgonzola cheese flavors were a bit overwhelming for our tastes. My husband told me this was not a keeper before I even asked his opinion of it. The puff pastry stuck to the pan.  Interesting to try, but wouldn't make it again.

This is a delicious appetizer, that would be a five star if it called for twice the sun dried tomatos and a little more green onion. Phyllo is a nice alternative to puff pastry.

Very quick to make. Used all sorts of topping I had in fridge. Did not pre-cook, but scoref 2cm border around dough where I put no filling, then baked for 25 min at 180C. Yummy

I love this!  Mine came out amazing but I didn't follow the recipe exactly due to ingredients on hand.  The cook time for the puff pastry is perfect, be sure to poke holes so it doesn't puff out, otherwise just crunch it down when you put on your topping.  My changes:
1.  Used a rolling pin to make the puff pastry longer to make a bigger, thinner crust pizza.
2.  Folded over the edges and sealed with a fork to make a crusty rim.
3.  Used lots of cooking spray on tin foil to ensure it didn't stick.
4.  Spooned on spaghetti sauce as a pizza base, about 2/3 a cup.
5.  Used my available cheese, 1/2 mozzarella, 1/2 goat cheese crumbled up.  Then I just sprinkled some shredded cheddar because I had it and why not?
6. Cooked up 3 bacon slices and chopped them and sprinkled them on.
7. Chopped up a couple slices of deli ham and added it.

We are stranded in a snow storm, so I just threw on what we had, but it turned out AMAZING.  The goat cheese side was the best.

Fabulous.  Fresh rosemary makes it even better it you have it on hand.

We prefer pizza dough.  The puff pastry was too flaky.
