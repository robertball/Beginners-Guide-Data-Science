Not that the recipe isn't good, but where i am from a summer squash is a small yellow crookneck squash. The photo for this appears to be a butternut squash.

Forgive me for my substitutions, but, my Rice Sides was not in my pantry anymore, so I made the rice from scratch (3c water/broth, 1 1/2c rice, 1c chopped celery, 1/2tsp pepper, 1/2tsp seasoning salt). My sausage was a tomato cheese sausage I removed from a casing, and sauteed with onions and the mushrooms called for. 
I didn't know what I was doing, bit I didn't drain the grease, I drained the extra water in the bottom of my squash baking dish, and barely left enough to cover the bottom when I added the butter (when baking the first 30min, had about 1/4" level). The rice made SO MUCH MORE than needed, so hopefully the pouch will be sufficient when you make this. I topped with mozzarella cheese, rather than adding into the rice mixture, and didn't add pecans (personal preference). I went back for more. So surprised at how delicious it is. And I was never a squash person growing up, and I went back for seconds.

I wish this recipe stated which flavor(s) of sausage to use. I don't imagine that all flavors of sausage go well with coriander. I live in Switzerland, where (oddly enough), you can't buy ground sausage. So I made this with plain ground pork (mixed with the coriander as the recipe states), and mine turned out very bland. Perhaps it would be better if made with a flavored sausage. Also, the squash took much longer to cook than just 1/2 hour. My squash halves took one hour to cook until tender before I stuffed them and then cooked the extra 30 minutes. And the squash is still not extremely tender the way I like it to be. Will not be making this again.

This dish has a very tasty combination of flavors.  The squash took WAY longer to cook than the recipe indicated. Next time I will pre-cook the squash. I used a butternut squash, similar to what is pictured.
