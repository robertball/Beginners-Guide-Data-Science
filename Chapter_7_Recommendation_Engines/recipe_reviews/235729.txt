These are great! I'm a big quinoa eater, this is a nice variation. I followed the quinoa package direction when cooking (2 c water, 1 c quinoa)and added flavoring. Then mixed in fresh chopped spinach, only 3 eggs, and slightly more cheese with the called for ingredients. Plus, added some garlic salt, pepper, and rosemary. A winner for me, my husband, and 1 year old. Quick, easy, and healthy. Have plenty for the week.

The recipe was good, but a little bland. I added feta, garlic, cajun seasoning, pepper, and parsley when mixing everything together. I think I will also cook the quinoa in chicken broth next time instead of water.

I thought I had leftover quinoa but it was couscous. It worked and was very good. Followed everything the same, except I put it in muffin tins to make little cups. Then baked until brown. Filled them with beef tips. Really tasty. My mom and husband really liked the taste and the uniqueness. Next time I will actually use quinoa.

Great recipe, my toddler loves these! I made these a couple times and I used shredded zucchini instead of spinach one of the times. Took your advice and made a bigger batch to freeze extra. This works out real well when you need something for snack time. Thank you for sharing:)

My kids and I like it!  After reading some of the other reviews, I used chicken broth, diced garlic, and cumin to cook the quinoa.  I also added feta, fresh parsley, and pepper to the ingredient list.  I cooked them in the oven for 20 min, and then flipped and cooked another 10 min.  (The first batch was 15 min and 5 min according to the instructions, but we thought they needed more toasting.)    They turned out very tasty!

I love these! I used a muffin tin. I used zucchini, onion, and goat cheese crumbles. Chex crushed up for gluten free bread crumbs. Oh! And I tossed some kale chips in my cooked quinoa & it was fantastic.

Fabulous basic recipe! Easy to spice it up with some onions, garlic, hot sauce, sharp cheese, etc when intended for an adult palate, but as it stands this is great for kiddos (and less adventurous adults). One change I made was to use baby quinoa (kaniwa) which lacks the saponins and thus is not subject to the bitterness of quinoa. I really like how they turned out and will be packing them in my daughter's lunchbox as well as feeding them to my 1 yr old twins! Many thanks!

These were very plain and definitely needed some extra spices.  Overall just ok.

Great, easy recipe. Used chicken broth instead of water and added parsley from the garden for more flavor. Only thing I would suggest is read your quinoa directions for cooking as mine have a 2:1 water/quinoa ratio not 3:1 this recipe calls for.

They are pretty good! I did add some garlic powder and a sprinkling of cayenne pepper.
