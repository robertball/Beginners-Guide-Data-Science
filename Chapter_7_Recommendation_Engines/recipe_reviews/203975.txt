I rate this at four stars, but after my additions to this I 'll give it 5 stars. I added cubed ham, about  1 1/2 cups, and 1 cup of potatoe's cubed, and some diced carrots. I tossed this all in the olive oil and baked it in a glass dish. if you want it crispy put it on the baking sheet. It turned out excellent. A nice dinner for two.

I love kohlrabi; this is a quick and simple way to get it from my local farmer's market to the table. I only roughly followed the recipe and didn't use parmesan; it is still very tasty. I also cooked the leaves, mostly separated from the stems, on the stove; it is a bit like kale (seasoned these with some salt & pepper). The bases of the stems have some of the same flavor as the bulb; I chopped those up into small pieces and use the same olive oil + salt & pepper + garlic mix to season and bake those. All good stuff, thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous! This was our first kohlrabi, in our CSA box.  I sliced thinner than 1/4", and used a few minced garlic scapes instead of cloves (also in the CSA box).  After tossing, I spread on the baking sheet and did a light shake of garlic powder over all.  This was a hit all around, including the 9 year old who wants it again for dinner tomorrow!

This is delicous - a great way to enjoy kohlrabi.  I sliced the kohlrabi as thin as possible before tossing it with the other ingredients.  It turned out tender and crispy, and the garlic and Parmesan cheese added wonderful flavor.  This is a keeper recipe for me.

I followed this recipe but forgot to put on the parmesan cheese and it was still absolutely delicious! I cannot wait to make it again with the cheese. I flipped them half way through so both sides would get nice and crispy.     Note: I made half with the peel and half without because I got lazy part way through. I would recommend taking the time to take off the peel as the recipe says because the peel gets VERY firm.

I picked up a kohlrabi at the farmer's market yesterday, just for kicks because I'd never tried one. Wow. Thanks to this recipe, I'm permanently hooked. Crispy, cheesy, fantastic--and my husband likes it too!

I too received some kohlrabi from my CSA and had no idea what to do with it. I'm so glad my sister suggested this recipe to me. This very tasty, simple and delicious!!!  I didn't bother peeling my kohlrabi and used a mandolin slicer to get nice even thin slices. Also used a Parmesan and Romano blend of cheese. My kids ate this up and said that it tasted better than potatoes.

I´m glad I found this recipe. Once in a while we have boiled kohlrabi and this was a nice change. I cut mine in cubes since that is how we always eat them, but they took just over 30 minutes to bake. I think it´s because I used a thick glass baking dish so it probably took longer to heat through. I will definitely make this again but next time I will add more garlic. I also added some frozen chopped parsley to give the kohlrabi a nicer presentation. My husband really enjoyed this and gave it a thumbs up. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

The kohlrabi was delicious with parmesan sprinkled liberally on it. This was the first time I've had it and to me it tasted like a cross between a potato and broccoli.  This  vegetable was hard to slice, so dense that I couldn't use my mandolin for fear of slipping due to the force it took to push the vegetable across the blade.  Next time I'll use a lower temp and longer cooking time. A hot spot in my oven burned the edges of some of the kohlrabi. We'll be having this again soon!

Excellent side dish and easy use for kohlrabi. I was specifically looking for something new to do that wasn't a slaw or soup. I Cut up a new potato, coated in the mixture and baked along with the kohlrabi to have a little texture diversity.  I also washed and sliced up the kohlrabi leaves, sauteed them in a combination of olive oil, white cooking wine and soy sauce and WOW!  This was all a side to my pan-seared tilapia tonight and I'm still in heaven.

Like others, received in our CSA box and was clueless.  Unlike others, ours was LARGE - easily the size of a small cabbage.  Are there different varieties?  Followed recipe exactly, except added some sliced spring onions (purple)  for taste and color. LOVED IT...and I am not a veggie eater.  Slices did not crisp up, but were tender and very flavorful.  Will absolutely make again.  Thanks for a recipe that encouraged us to try something new and different!

This was the first time I roasted Kohlrabi and it turned out great.  I was short on time so I diced the kohlrabi into small squares.  My home is a kosher home and we were having a meat meal so I eliminated the cheese but it was still delicious.  The kids said it was a keeper so I am sure that we will be making it again. Thank you.

Kohlrabi wasn't on my Food Bucket List as I didn't even know it existed until visiting a local organic farm.  The owner encouraged me to give it a try and now I'm hooked!!  I have tried kohlrabi in salads, cooked/mashed, etc. but this is the first time to try it roasted and I am so glad I did.  Only downside was that the minced garlic burnt long before the kohlrabi was tender.  It still tasted fine but it took away from the appearance of the dish. Think next time in place of the minced garlic I will use either garlic salt or powder. Thanks WSBLEND for submitting this!

This was EXCELLENT!  I used a blend of parmigiana and romano cheeses and baked it a little longer than the recipe called for.  

Next time I plan to add a little grated asiago cheese as well.

What a yummy recipe! I was introduced to Kohlrabi a few yrs ago by someone who uses it chopped up as a filler for soups. I was looking for a different veggie to break out of routine & was curious to try your recipe. I'm so glad I did!  Not only was it delicious & super easy, it was completely gone in one sitting by my spouse who had not eaten Kohlrabi before!! Now every time we go shopping, he goes on a Kohlrabi hunt so that we can enjoy your recipe once again :)  Thanks for sharing.

Much better than I expected I think this is the best kohlrabi recipe I've made yet. Now next time I won't skip the safety on my slicer since I almost lost a finger tip into the dish. Gross. Sorry.

I too received one of these in my CSA basket and had no idea what to do with it (I first had to google it to identify it... I've never even seen one!) But this recipe was simple and tasty! If I ever get another kohlrabi, I'll make this again.

Count me among those who got this in my CSA share and had no idea what to do with it.  This recipe was awesome!  Very easy and very tasty.  Even my extremely picky 12-year-old was won over.  Now we're looking forward to next week's CSA share and hoping for more kohlrabi.

Same as other folks, I got this in my CSA share and had to figure out what to do with it. I pretty much followed this recipe exactly (except I think I used more olive oil; I just kept adding more when I ran out of it). It tastes a lot like broccoli, and I think the Parmesan cheese added a lot. I would make this recipe again!

Really good!!!!  No cheese added. Actually saw Kohlrabi in a diabetic magazine and decided since i was cutting back on carbs i would give it a try.  I just sliced it like a potato (in cubes) and added garlic powder and garlic salt, (was lazy and didn't want garlic smelling hands for a couple days) red pepper,flakes,black pepper and olive oil, then roasted at 425 till i thought they were ready.  Was baking fish at the same time on another tray so i didn't time it. sorry.  But its like a potato and according to my boyfriend it taste like broccoli and potato.  I think it taste like chayote.  You be the judge.

This was also our first kohlrabi, from the CSA- didn't know what it was and had to look it up!  I pretty much followed the recipe, and it turned out great.  Very tasty.  Has a pleasant, sharp flavor.  My only issue was that they ended up kind of soggy, but they still tasted really nice.

I got kohlrabi in my CSA because I like to try out new foods.  This was my first recipe using kohlrabi--I fed it to some pretty stubborn eaters in my family, and they liked it a lot.  It was delicious and easy (well, besides cutting into the kohlrabi).

This was really good.  Very easy.  We made it as a snack on a rainy Saturday afternoon while playing board games.  A much healthier alternative to chips and other snack foods.  It would be fine as a side dish as well.

Excellent just as it is... I was going to modify this recipe like I usually do, but my mom convinced me to cook it exactly as directed. We used the convection setting on the oven which made them slightly browned and crispy..if there were picky eaters or kids around I think I could have passed this off as a savory potato dish!  Buenissimo!

What a brilliantly simple and quick recipe!

And nowadays who doesn't love simple and quick!

I added some cauliflower, sprinkled a little lemon pepper and a few red chili flakes.

Delicious!

Easy and delicious.  I had no idea what to do with kohlrabi when I got it my CSA box.  Now I do and I love it!

Delicious and very very simple. The kohlrabi develops an awesome sweetness when prepared this way. I ordered 2 more pounds of it from my co-op so I can make this recipe again!

Yum!  But how big is a kohlrabi bulb supposed to be?  The variation in sizes is huge.  I wish the recipe gave a weight for the kohlrabi.

We were a little skeptical after tasting kohlrabi raw, but roasted kohlrabi is so good you won't want to eat anything else--at least we didn't!

This was easy and tasty. I forgot to stir the strips...so they weren't evenly cooked and they weren't done at 30 minutes, but I wasn't sure if I should cook them more...so they weren't really crispy, but I think that was my fault. I would make this again :)

I was looking for something different to do with the kohlrabi in our garden and this was definately it!  Everyone absolutely loved it!  The only thing different I did was to add very small amounts of chopped chives, chervil and thyme.  YUM!!!

I used oil, salt and pepper and roasted at 375 since I was baking something else at the time.  I ate some with horseradish and tossed the rest into my salad.  Now I finally know what to do with the kohlrabi in my farm share! Yum.

I am in the process of cutting out meats so I am trying all kinds of new vegetables. I found this at our farmer's market today and decided to try one. The one I got was HUGE (for just $.75!) so I used 1/4 of it in a root stew I made (which was fantastic) and then used the rest to make fries (it made a whole cookie sheet's worth). Amazing! I am totally hooked on Kohlrabi now! Thanks for the recipe!

I love kohlrabi raw with salt, so I never even thought about trying it any other way. This was very simple and very tasty. It tastes completely different from raw kohlrabi. Thanks for the inspiration to try it hot. Maybe next time I will add a few sliced carrot rounds for color.

It came out a bit overcooked the first time, so keep an eye on it.  I lowered the temperature to 400 and it came out great.

Yes, we have so many kolarabi I was running out of recipes. We love them raw in salads and as a snack. I added turmeric to the recipe and it gave it a great flavor. 
I am going to try it with different herbs to enhance the flavor.

My husband made this last night, and it was a big hit with all of us - including our 3-year-old and our 1-year-old. Delicious! A new favorite. It was our first time having kohlrabi, and it tasted like a mix between potatoes, turnips, and heaven. We also had raw kohlrabi and radish "carpaccio" the same night, but this recipe was my favorite of the night. Felt like we were indulging, but it's healthy!

This was so delicious. I love kohlrabi raw and didn't think I could love it more cooked, but I did. It gets a little bit sweet when you bake it and really tender. Great recipe!

This was a great way to use kohlrabi, which kind of tastes like broccoli stems.  My husband loved it, despite always being skeptical of new veggies.

My daughter does not like raw kohlrabi, so I decided to try this to see if she would like it.  She loved it.  So did I.  I made half w/ out the cheese because my daughter does not like cheese.  It was great both ways.  Will definitely make this again.

First time eating kohlrabi ever...and it was so yummy! Received only 3 kohlrabi's from my local veggie bin, so I added 2 small zucchini's with it. They both complemented each other in flavor and texture.

Whole family loved it!  I only had a few Tbs of shredded parmesan, but it adds a great complementary flavor.  Peeling the kohlrabi was not fun, but definitely necessary, since the fibers are very tough in the unpeeled parts.  I had never had kohlrabi before; it tastes a lot like a turnip.  I will definitely make this again!

Planted in the garden with no clear idea as to what/how to cook.  Tried this recipe and was quite pleased. Only cooked one to try it out and forgot to add the cheese. But,#1 Hubby and I decided it is a keeper.  Will pull another one tomorrow night and try again with the cheese and perhaps another herb or two.

Really good...even my 5 yr old liked it...a new veggie for us and we were gifted 2 kohlrabi from a neighbor and found this recipe. The flavor was great, kinda cabbage/cauliflower/turnip like. The slices roasted up beautifully and were crispy. Thanks!

i got kohlrabi in my csa box but had never even heard of it before.  this was really tasty.  but i think that i'll add the cheese a different way next time (or not let it cook as long) because a lot of it got stuck on the pan.

Excellent!  We were liberal with the garlic and cheese, and my husband and I put red pepper flakes on top just prior to serving. My 4 year old said it was "super delicious."  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made as written.  Mine came out pretty average.  It was okay, but it didn't leave me wanting more.  I may have overcooked it, as mine were pretty fibrous and hard to chew on the outer edge.  Maybe I'll try it again sometime and only cook for 20 minutes total instead of 25.

Glad I found this great recipe!  Who would have guessed kohlrabi could unlock such secret flavor? Kohlrabi at my favorite farm stand is very inexpensive, because nobody knows what to do with it...it's hard and funny looking.  The leaves are good in stir-fry, but the roast kohlrabi is just amazing. I add a bit of vinegar to bring out the tang.  Also recommended:  Turnip fries (see Mr. Neep's recipe on Mr. Neep website).

Wouldn't make again.  Our family would much rather prefer this uncooked and sliced (sometimes with a dash of salt).  I was looking for a different way to eat it, but will go back to the old standby.

This is so good.  I used soy cheese instead of parmesan cheese and it still turned out to be really good.  The unfortunate thing is that all the Kohlrabi needs to be eaten the day it is made otherwise it turns soggy.

I was very pleased with how this came out. It was rather like broccoli stems. I followed the recipe, though I only had 3 bulbs instead of 4. It was so easy and fairly quick, and tasty to boot. Even the kids ate it. :)

I gave it 5 start because it was really healthy and pretty good.  I think it would be better to cut the kohlrabi into cubes and not slices.  I also added about 1/3 cubed potatoes with skins on to make a complete veggie part of the meal.  It was very good.

Very nice.  I love vegetables roasted and I have never had kohlrabi.  I bought at the farmers market this morning based on the recommendations of the seller.  I will be getting more kohlrabi and this will probably be the way I cook it.  Thanks for sharing.

The flavor was ok, but the texture wasn’t what we were looking for. The pieces were still very firm, even after sautéing for 20 mins as leftovers. Probably more a comment on the kohlrabi than the recipe itself, though!

My son grows organic veggies and brought me two kohlrabi.  I searched and found this recipe.  Made it exactly as directed to rave reviews.  I cook everything as much from scratch/ farm to table as possible, and would make this again,  and have already shared this recipe.  Yum!

I sliced to kohlrabi a bit thicker, added 1 tsp salt and a fair number of grinds of black peppercorns (not sure of the amount...).  Forgot to add the garlic.  :'-(  My family enjoyed it and I would make this again.

I bought peeled garlic cloves to roast with the kohlrabi. Never having done so, I just poured them in. They were delicious and so was the vegetable but the garlic was strong. thank god for the parmesan cheese.

Good basic recipe.  I too will slice thinner next time, and will peel them better--the outside, especially the bottom, was unpleasantly tough and sometimes stringy.

Whole family loved this dish.  I got a bunch of these strange veggies in our CSA basket and had no clue what they were or what to do with them ...

I loosely followed the directions, cut them up like French Fries, added paprika, onion powder & Touscan Seasoning to the mix.

Veggie phobic kids thought they were French fries, (I didn't correct them!) Huge hit!

I'll definitely make again!

This was delicious.  I got a little too much salt on it but that was totally my fault. I used garlic powder  instead of fresh garlic because I knew at that high of heat the garlic would burn. I will be making this again for sure.

I had never tried kohlrabi before and needed some suggestions for recipes.   This was the first recipe I made and we absolutely loved the delicious taste of the roasted kohlrabi.  I will definitely be making it again!

This was excellent but I had to do a bit of guesswork on the amounts of garlic, oil and parmesan because 2 of my garden kohlrabi are equal to about 8-12 of the store bought sized kohlrabi and the recipe doesn't specify size.

First time trying kohlrabi. I forgot the parmesan cheese and it was still delicious! Easy recipe. Will make again.

It wasn't bad. This was my first time eating kohlrabi. I added a small with radish to the mix. I liked the roasted radish better, more flavor. The thinner sliced pieces were tastier and crippled up a little better.

This  was the first time we had Kohlrabi and we loved it.   We now have a new veggie to add to the menu and this is the perfect way to prepare it.

I made this because my mom said her Grandma used to make it for her all the time and she loved it.  Of course she had no idea how to make it.  I followed the directions to a tee and my family loved it.  NOT LIKED, LOVED IT!

Maybe my kohlrabi was suspect based on pictures , but this turned out bitter though not burned. I'll try again with another bunch of  kohlrabi.

I bought a large kohlrabi from the farmer's market.  I cut it up as directed, baked for 20 minutes and followed the recipe exactly.  The kohlrabi was still not tender, and I could not eat it.  But there were a couple of pieces that got soft and they were very good with good flavor.  I will definitely make this again, but bake it until good and tender!

Very tasty, easy way to have Kohl Rabi. The only thing differently from the recipe is add curry powder to the spices. I cooked them for about 25 minutes to have them a bit crispier.

Very tasty, the kohlrabi seemed to have a skin on it, not  sure if it should have been peeled rather than just washed.  Otherwise loved it

Simple and good. Served with pork steaks. Awesome! Generally, I treat Kohlrabi like they are potatoes. 

I used fresh out of my garden onions, zucchini, a flat round kind of squash and kohlrabi.  Sliced all of it thinly, tossed in the mixture as directed, then I put the parmesan on after turning them over in the oven. Not crispy but very, very tasty.

I was going to put them on the grill but decided to broil them instead - it's 90 degress out there. *smile*

i belong to a weight lose group at our church and our challenge this year is to buy and prepare a new fruit and veggie each month.  we did kohlrabi this month and to quote my hubby " you can do this again" lol it's great and for a little added crunch you could add a tbs of bread crumbs when tossing with the oil and cheese.  very good.

I was surprised to find that I was not wowed by this the way others were.  I would give it 3.5 stars - it was okay but not very good.  I think a prior poster's suggestion of adding other root vegetables (potato, carrot) and ham would make a nice improvement.  It would also be a great ingredient to add in a hash but as a standalone recipe, it didn't work for me.

Good! This was my first exposure to kohlrabi and I was a little skeptical, but I enjoyed it.  I like the simplicity of this recipe, too--it lets the kohlrabi shine as it really is.

Tastes great!  If you love garlic, try using extra cloves.  If you cut the kohlrabi into squares, it will require a longer baking time.  (I baked at 200 C, 40 minutes, stirring every 10-15 minutes, in a small glass casserole dish.)

Glad I found this recipe since we have been getting a lot of kohlrabi in our CSA box. Easy recipe and turned out great. I used a three cheese blend (parmesan, asiago and romano) to sprinkle on top. Would make again.
