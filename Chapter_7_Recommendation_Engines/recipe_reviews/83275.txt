This is a completely authentic take on an easy and delicious family style dish, so beloved in China that it also shows up at formal banquets.  I've always been surprised that we don't see it on more menus in the US.

This dish has also been a favorite in my family since I was very little. It's great with rice, is healthy, and nutritious. I would add some chopped garlic for a little bit more flavor; my family adds the garlic with the tomatoes so they don't fry-- but cook in the juices of the tomato.

I grew up on a recipe similar to this one, except the way my father did this for me was he put some oil in a frying pan added sauce to coat bottom of pan let that heat up and then added an egg or two and kept the egg sunny side up.  Added some salt and served with his italian loaf bread.    mmm So good.

I was first taught this recipe when I was living in Tianjin China while on work assignment. The secret for truly authentic is to start the eggs on low temp and stir with chop sticks in order to get the long egg strains similar to egg drop soup. Take the eggs out and set aside. Turn up the heat to med-high, add a little more oil and then stir fry the tomatoes. Once done take off heat and add eggs back to wok to re temper and serve. Thanks for reminding me of this great authentic dish!

Simplicity is a valuable asset with some dishes and this one isn't any different.  I made the dish exactly as the recipe indicated and loved it!  I prefer a little more salt with the tomatoes and salted them before adding them to the eggs. It was very surprising to me that a previous reviewer with an 'expert' rating was disappointed that this dish tasted like scrambled eggs with tomatoes since the list of ingredients leaves nothing to the imagination. I loved the taste of the fresh tomatoes with the eggs.  I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe.  Yum!

This is a staple in any Chinese household, including our own! Very simple, yet so good!   re cheese and bacon -- This is a traditional Chinese dish, it isn't trying to be American breakfast food).

This is a breakfast staple in the Philippines, especially with the ilokanos. My family had their own way of cooking it. We add salt to the eggs, saute'ed the tomatoes in oil first, let it get a little soft, then add beaten eggs & green onion. you may also add a few drops of soy sauce before adding the eggs. asian comfort food!

For a quick, spicy twist I like to use one can of Rotelle, drained, as a substitute for the tomatoes. Couple that with a simple cheese quesadilla... mucho delicioso!

I love this traditional Chinese recipe. It really is quick and easy to make, plus it tasted delicious. It may sound odd to mix tomatoes and eggs; but I think everyone should give it a try.

This was good but a little boring to me, so I added a little cheese to melt on top and that made it good, I think maybe a bit of bacon added might be good too.

Instead of oil, I used two tablespoons butter. I also used 6 egg whites and two full eggs as to cut down on the fat/cholesterol content and I added fresh ground pepper. This was a quick breakfast that was quite tasty.

I just made this as it sounded interesting--tasted like hot tomatoes and scambled eggs! That will be the only time I make it without additions like more onion, some spices, making it into an omlet and adding cheese.

Tomatoes and eggs are a great combination. Recommend to try a different way. Heat pan with medium heat. Pull enough vegetable oil to coat the pan. Add coarsely chopped tomatoes in the pan and cook until tomatoes get soft and mushy. Then pull beaten eggs seasoned with pinch of salt over the tomatoes. If you like green onion, add it in egg mix. Let egg sit for about a minute before folding and scrambling, because tomatoes and eggs need some time to integrate. The recommend ratio of eggs to tomatoes is every 2 large eggs to a half of a regular vine ripe tomato.

I also recommend adding a little sugar and a little ketchup for extra taste.

I've heard of tomatoes and eggs before, but never tried it. My sister looked green when I told her I was going to add tomatoes to our eggs and green onions, and she told me I had to add real onions and cheese to them too before she'd eat them. From her own words, "best eggs ever!" I loved these too! I will be making them again for sure!

I lived in China for a year and found this was one of my favorite dishes.  I've made it myself many times, but found that it never tastes quite like it did when made by my friends in China.  My theory is that "salt to taste" means you need to add a lot of salt (2 teaspoons, possibly?) for it to taste like anything beyond the unimpressive eggs with tomatoes that a former commenter noted.  Anyone with more authentic experience, please feel free to correct my errors.  But yes, this is a very simple and authentic Chinese dish.
