Karen - this is a real winner -  Beets have always been ugh food in our house.  Everyone loved this one. Only change was that we used olive oil.  There were NO leftovers.

Interesting combination of flavors. I'd never have imagined that cumin would go so well with beets. Toasted the cumin in a dry saucepan to intensify the flavor. Did not bother to skin or seed the tomatoes, and it didn't seem to matter, as they dissolved into the sauce--unlike the accomanying picture that shows the tomatoes as a visible ingredient.

I love beets. Seriously. I know that makes me weird, but that's okay. My husband doesn't like them, I usually just boil and season. So I go on a quest to find something that he might like... he said they were "okay" but my 4 year old ate two large helpings! We didn't have tomatoes so I substituted tomato sauce and I didn't have cumin seeds so I used the stuff in the jar. Overall, I think it was good, I think it would've been better with fresh tomatoes, but it was a keeper. I put some of the sauce over my oregano chicken I made that same night and it was devine!

Was looking for something different to do with beetroot. This dish was very good, my husband loved it. We both love cumin and garlic and found these to go very well with the beetroot. I changed the method slightly by precooking the beets and making the "sauce" seperately. I then added the beets to the sauce. Went very well with grilled pork chops. Have to note though that all ingredients were freshly picked from our veggie garden and pork produced on our farm - all natural stuff!!!!

I left out the oil, and just used vegetable spray.  I started by sauteing the onion, garlic and chopped beet, then added the cumin seeds and flour. Finally, I added in the water and tomatoes.  When this was just about done, I added in the chopped beet greens, which I cooked until they began to wilt.  This has great taste!  I'll be making this again!

Absolutely delicious. I will definitely add this to my list of favorite recipes.  My boyfriend and I loved it! We served it with basmati rice which soaked up the flavorful sauce.  Next time I will cut the beets into smaller, bite sized pieces.

I love beets but hated this version. I had to drain the sauce and then fry them before my husband would eat it.

Loved this recipe.  I am a big fan of beets: they taste great and are high in vitamins and minerals.  I didn't bother skinning or de-seeding the tomatoes and it turned out great.  The tomatoes just dissolved into the dish.  I toasted the cumin seeds before cooking and I think that added to the flavor.  I just thought this dish tasted great.  I will use again.

My kids love beets - but they wouldn't eat this! Four stars because it is tasty, but the other ingredients don't complement the beets. Instead, they cover up the beet flavor. So, try this if you really can't stand beets!

Very good, my 16 month old loved it!  I did not add the flour, but did add Kale, when I added the beets, tomatoes, water and salt, which was a good addition.  Great and very tasty way to make beets!

I don't dislike beets, but I think they're boring. My husband likes beets. I used all these ingredients, and they didn't change the taste of the dish at all. Still tasted like beets and nothing else. No onion, garlic, cumin, or tomato taste - all wasted. We added sugar, and that helped slightly. I'll never make this again.

Good taste but it comes out soupy. Needs more flour, perhaps, and definitely some ground pepper. Then, not bad!

We love beets and this is a great recipe for everyone, even my 8 year old eats it.  The only thing I do different is I do not put the tomatoes.

This recipe is excellent!  I did tweak it a little, but essentially stayed true to the recipe.  I boiled the beets whole ahead of time, then peeled them and diced them.  When adding them to the rest of the ingredients it wasn't necessary to use as much water, maybe a half cup or so.  (I am not much of a measurer!)  I also toasted the cumin seeds in a dry skillet then ground them instead of using them whole.  I used a can of diced tomatoes as I didn't have any fresh on hand, and it worked perfectly. I am excited to try  the diced tomatoes that are canned with garlic or chiles or onions or whatever they have in them.  These changes were just for convenience and personal preference. The recipe as listed sounded great. I just rarely cook anything exactly as the recipe calls for.  Enjoy this dish as a side with any meal that needs a flavorful accompaniment. We ate it with Spanish Rice as another user suggested and it ROCKED!!

I haven't had beets for years, but these were delicious! Cumin is one of my favorite spices, so I'm willing to try just about any recipe that calls for it. This was a good choice.

I have made this several times now and like it more each time. The flavor and sauce are a nice departure from plain boiled beets. I didn't care for the tomatoes the first time so I just leave it out now and don't miss it. Thank you for a great recipe to use up all beets from the garden!

Didn't have the ingredients for my normal beet dish, but panic ended on discovering I had the ingredients for this.  Was skeptical about it, but the adults LOVED it.  No leftovers!  THANKS!

We have never cooked with beets before and this recipe was a great introduction to the vegetable. All I did to the tomatoes was quarter thema and slice them up(no peeling or removing seeds. Also, I didn't have cumin seeds, I used ground cumin seeds and it worked just fine. We had it with pork chops and it was so good that we ate the beets with bites of pork chops. The meat was too boring without it. Thanks for the great post!

I don't normally bother with reviews but thought that this recipe was good enough to take the time to rate it.  I'm not fussy about beets but had a few "thrown in" for free at the vegetable market.  I tried this recipe and next week I'm going to buy beets!  I'm converted.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe even cold leftovers.  I added some apple cider vinegar and i only had canned tomatoes.  Oh and I double the onions (I'm an onion fan). I recommed cutting the beets into smaller bite size pieces. Thx

My wife liked these, but she eats anything.  I love beets but this recipe was just not okay.  Ditto for my son, who was anxious for dinner, had one bite and wouldn't touch the rest.  Sorry, not a recipe for beet lovers.

I was doubtful - never heard of combining beets with fresh tomatoes...but those tomatoes melt into a silky tangy sauce that really complements the earthy beets.  The cumin seeds add a spicy kick without being obnoxious.  We loved this!
