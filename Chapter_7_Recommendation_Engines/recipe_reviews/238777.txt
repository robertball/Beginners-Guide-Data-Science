I added garlic, and I chopped the green olives and used whole kalamata olives. I also added some chopped fresh basil. I seasoned my chicken with pepper, garlic salt, and smoked paprika. And once the sauce was simmering I added a dash of balsamic vinegar. And finished with fresh Parmesan. My husbands reaction "this isn't just good... It's literally one of the best things I've ever had. I would be ok with with for breakfast, lunch, and dinner... For the rest of my life." He's kind of a foodie so I guess this was a hit. It was so easy. I guess this will be added to out week night menus.

Great dish, quick and easy. Made it twice, both times with Kalimantan olives which give great flavor. It's best with fresh spinach, but forgot it the second time and it was still good. Make sure to dry your chicken so it browns instead of steaming.

Really glad I found this recipe. My family loved it. I used a big bunch of fresh spinach and I served it using a slotted spoon because it was pretty liquidy. I will make this again! Thanks for posting!

I’m a little Sicilian and I love green olives, so was excited to make this Dish...with a few subs based on what I had. Swapped sliced zucchini for spinach, kalamatas for capers, and chicken leg quarters for the cutlets. Skinned and trimmed the chicken and cut into individual pieces. Combined all the other ingredients plus a second can of tomatoes (due to so much chicken), some Greek seasoning, and several smashed, sliced garlic cloves. Sautéed chicken in oil on both sides, then added tomato mixture, covered, and turned down to med-low to simmer about 30 more min. Added a photo; food was already half gone though. Hungry boys and I loooved it! Super filling. Served with some tri-color rotini.

Delish! I used fresh spinach. I also used the packing olive oil from some sun dried tomatoes to sear chicken. I served with spaghetti. I reserved 1/2 cup pasta water and added it to the chicken and sauce just before serving.

I added 1 large clove of garlic & used fresh spinach.  I used half green (manzanilla) and half black olives.  Next time I will cook the sauce down to thicken and add to browned chicken.  Delicious and easy!

I thought this recipe was very good but my Italian husband absolutely loved it! He says it's his second favourite dish next to sausage and pepper pasta. He's demanding I make this next week when we're having friends over. This is definitely a keeper. I did a few things differently. I cut regular chicken breasts in half horizontally to make cutlets. I breaded them with flour, egg and Italian seasoned bread crumbs then sautéed them in the olive oil. I mixed canned Italian flavoured tomatoes, fresh spinach, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, both green and kalamati olives and red pepper, deleting the capers. Added this to the pan with the chicken and simmered for about 10 minutes until spinach was wilted.  Served it with penne pasta.

This meal was a hit with my husband. Instead of frozen spinach I used fresh... I also seasoned the chicken with pepper, paprika, and garlic salt (as recommended by other reviewers). This is going in my recipe book.

Quick and delicious! I added a can of peeled tomatoes (out of improvisation) and it turned out fine as well. Would have liked it better with fresh tomatoes though. The I also added minced garlic and oregano to the tomato and spinach mixture before tossing it in the pan. I would suggest maybe a light breadcrumb coating on the chicken to help the chicken adhere to some of those big flavors. I would also add freshly grated Parmesan at the end. Serve it with capellini aglio olio!

As is, 4 * because it's too watery & needs more seasoning or it's too bland.  Next time I'll WON'T cover the pan after adding the sauce. As others suggested, I added  some salt, garlic powder & paprika.  I did add a little salt to the meat before cooking. While cooking,  I added about 2-3 oz. dry red wine. (Yes, even after I saw it was too watery!) Next time, I'll top w/ fresh Parmesan.

This recipe was easy and good. I used both green and Kalamata olives, along with fresh spinach. Next time I'd like to add some artichoke hearts.

Nummmmm.  I added zucchini, was a nice addition, and used plain canned diced tomatoes using my own italian seasonings for the dish.  Something about olives and chicken together that I absolutely love. Next time I think I'll add more olives and capers, it's that brininess that adds so much. I was going to add garlic, but since I served it with Pasta and Garlic (also on this site) I didn't add it here. Loved it, I'll be making this often.

I liked this recipe. I didn't have capers, but, other than that, I made the recipe exactly as written. Healthy and tasty. I will make this again for sure.

My family very much liked the flavors in this recipe, but I had a little trouble as to whether to measure the frozen, chopped spinach before or after thawing. This would have been much more clear had a package weight been specified. I used a 16 oz. package in a bag, but a 16 oz. frozen block would have been impossible to measure without thawing. I intended to double the recipe to have enough for another meal, and measured out 3 cups of the frozen chopped spinach. After I thawed it and pressed out the water, it didn't look like enough, so I thawed the entire package. After i mixed it with the diced tomatoes, I knew it was way too much spinach.  So, I added another can of the diced tomatoes. I increased the other ingredients to compensate for the extra spinach and tomatoes, and added Italian seasoning and minced garlic,. I also seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic salt. The flavor of the sauce was very good, and I served the chicken and sauce over bow tie noodles to use the extra sauce. It worked out OK, but I strongly suggest that anyone using frozen chopped spinach buy the bag of loose spinach rather than the block and measure it before thawing.

I didn’t have any spinach or capers but I had sun dried tomatoes  in olive oil and the combination with the diced tomatoes was amazing.  Next time will try it with spinach and capers but my family lived this and there were NO leftovers!

Great recipe to add to the rotation. Easy to prepare. As others suggested, I used a bag of fresh spinach. I used half kalamata olives and half green olives. Next time I’ll use all kalamata and maybe more capers. I cooked the entire dish in the oven instead of on the stovetop. Sprayed a thin layer of olive oil into a large Pyrex dish and placed dish in the oven before preheating oven to 425°F. Once preheated placed thin cut chicken breast in a single layer into the hot dish and baked for about 10 minutes. Flipped chicken and topped with spinach and tomato mixture and baked for an additional 7 minutes.

Loved this!  The only changes I made were to use a bag of fresh spinach, instead of frozen--although the frozen looks good, too,--at the last step before covering with the pan lid, and I used black olives instead of green, hubby's preference.  My mom made it for m 81-yr -old father, and he loved it, too.  He's more of  meat-and-potatoes guy, so that's saying something!  Served it with rice.  Yummy!

As a relative newbie cook, just starting after retirement, I found this recipe to be the easiest and fastest non-microwave preparation I've tried so far.   I seasoned the chicken with lemon pepper and smoked paprika before browning it and the tomato mixture with Italian seasoning,  but left the spinach out of the mixture, adding it to the pan for just the last minute of cooking to prevent it from wilting too much.   Perhaps I just had poor grade chicken or possibly it was because I used chopped tomatoes from the garden rather than a can of diced tomatoes but the chicken seemed somewhat dry (it wasn't overcooked as it was 165° with a meat thermometer).  Next time I will add chicken broth or a little tomato juice to the pan to cook it in or even use chicken thighs to counteract the dryness.   It  had wonderful taste and I will certainly be making it again especially when I find myself short on time!

I was a little nervous about making this recipe, but I really enjoyed it. I used chicken thighs and added fresh garlic. Will definitely make this one again.

This was very tasty.  I used peas instead of spinach since I was out of spinach.  I also added artichoke hearts.  I made pasta Aglio Olio to go with it.

Really nice and easy recipe full of flavour. The kids love olives so they enjoyed it too.
This one is a keeper!

This was quick, easy to make and so delicious that I made it again the next night.  I used both pimento stuffed green olives and kalamata olives.  Like others, I used fresh spinach.  Served it with wild rice the first night and Quinoa the second.  Loved it!

Used fresh spinach. I also added parmesan and basil, sprinkled paprika and oregano on the chicken before cooking it. Served with Pasta.

used fresh spinach, didn't tenderize chick boobs, just sliced them ~ 1 1/2 inches thin diagonally. dish a little watery but delicious flavors, easy & a hit!
