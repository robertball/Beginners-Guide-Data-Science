I think it's a terrific sandwich filler/salad! And personally, I think people who don't know what on earth they will feed their vegetarian family and friends are missing something basic...good food!

Affordable, filling, and most importantly delicious! I added a bit of dijon mustard to give it some zip. Thanks!

We have an avocaco tree so I'm always looking for ways to use the avocados... It's a strange combination but absolutely delicious! I served it on club crackers. So very easy.

I have been making a similar version of this for 60 years.  The only thing I add to this is lemon juice and seasoned salt & freshly ground pepper.  My whole family loves it.
