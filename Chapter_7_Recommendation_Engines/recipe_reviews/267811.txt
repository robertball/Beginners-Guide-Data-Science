Really good recipes with a few tweaks. Instead of sugar I used 3 tbs of honey and 2 stevia packets. This added just the right amount of natural sweetness. If you’re going to use sugar, I would suggest turbinado because it doesn’t clash as much with the spinach.

I followed the instructions with no changes. This recipe made 12 regular muffins at 2 tablespoons per muffin plus another 12 mini muffins at 2 teaspoons per muffin. These are exceptionally moist and not too sweet. At the end, I did put some crushed almonds on top of half of them. I will be making this recipe over and over again. Thank you for sharing.

Have made this recipe several times now. My 3 year old daughter loves these and so do I! I have used coconut milk or regular milk because don’t usually have almond milk on hand. Have also substituted vanilla extract for the almond extract. Are best when eaten fresh.

Made as directed and came out great! Banana flavor really comes through and you can’t taste the spinach at all. I topped with almond whipped cream (whipping cream, sugar, almond extract) which seemed to go well. Next time I’ll try an almondy icing I think.
