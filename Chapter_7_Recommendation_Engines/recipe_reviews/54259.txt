this is ok-not horrible...i used to work in a japanese steak house and there are a few key ing.that are left out in this recipe.subhoney for some of the sugar, sub all of the hot sauce for cayenne & add ground ginger, turmeric, and believe it or not , canned peaches.  i know for a fact that those ing. are in shrimp sauce. unfortunateley, the proportions i don't know.  have fun experimenting for perfect shrimp sauce!

This recipe is definitely a good guide--the proportions are good.  But the best advice I can give is to use pickle juice.  That's how they get that flavor at Miyabi.  Light on the ketchup, no vinegar, light on the water, and definitely use paprika.  Use the water to get whatever consistency you like, but you need at least 1 Tbs. of dill pickle juice.  Trust me.

I only used this recipe as a guide to what kind of ingredients to use for a shrimp sauce.  I used cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce.  I did not add any water what-so-ever, and I substituted the sugar for honey.  Add garlic powder and black pepper to taste.  Yummy!  Not runny at all.  We prefer this to the sauce we get at Japanese resturants, mainly because we can give it some more kick with that cayenne pepper.  
Thanks for the excellent recipe guide!

Very good basic sauce.  Mine came out even better than the one at our local Japanese Steak House.  I used the advice in another review... added Ginger and a small amount of canned peaches (used a little unsweetened peach juice in lieu of water) also honey instead of sugar.  Everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe...  You can make this sauce your own with a few little changes....

At first, I thought, ".  It's not at all what I thought."  So, I added some more paprika and a little onion powder.  But the trick is to let the flavors blend together in the 'fridge for at least 2 hours.  When it was all said and done, it wasn't bad at all... the family loved it and said it tastes just like what we get at our local Japanese restaurant.

This is a pretty good replica, the only thing I would comment on is the water (makes it a bit runny) and ketchup.  Instead of ketchup use tomato paste, it will stand up to the strong taste of the mayo.  If you want to thin it out some I suggest adding a tablespoon or two of heavy cream instead of water.  Love it though!

So simple yet so delicious. Put some of this over fried rice, it's the best thing you've ever had.  I learned this from a 4 year old at the old Samurai restaurant (now Benihana's).  Add Japanese Zucchini and Onions from this site, and you may never go out again.

My husband and I are a huge fan of this sauce. I added some heavy whipping cream to tone down the mayo and sweet taste. It's great with fried rice, chicken and shrimp. Even on salads.

I didn't think it tasted like the shrimp sauce I've tasted in Japanese steak houses,  the mayo taste was a little strong.  It still tasted ok though and my boyfriend really liked it.  It just wasn't what I expected.

I was skeptical when I read the recipe, and when I first mixed up the sauce, it tasted very bland.  After 2 hours in the fridge, though, it was WONDERFUL!!  My advice: prepare sauce per recipe and donâ€™t taste/adjust ingredients until after letting it sit for ~2 hours.  I was desperately looking for a shrimp sauce recipe like the one I LOVE at our local Japanese restaurant, and I have found it!!  I will be making this and stir fry often now!!

I was in a pinch and didn't have any rice vinegar.  I stirred in some orange juice in place of the water and used honey in place of the sugar.  Maybe not exactly restaurant quality but received high praise anyway!

This was very good. Not quite what I was used to at the Japanese Restaurants..but still very tasty. I did not add the water since I felt like it would be too runny...and I cut the recipe in 1/2.

This recipe was very close to our local Japanese steak houses.  However, it makes too much.  I have substituted low fat mayo and garlic salt instead of the garlic powder and salt.  I also added a little more ketchup to taste.  Very good.

This tastes NOTHING like the real thing. The only thing they got close with this recipe is the color and consistency is pretty close but it tastes overwhelmingly of mayo and garlic.

I love it! I tried it with a cheaper mayo (cause my husband went grocery shopping by himself) and it is not as good as the Hellmans.  It is KEY to let the flavors blend and it is best after sitting in the fridge for a day.  We love it with chicken fingers and fries and with fried rice and just about anything we eat with a dipping sauce.  Good job!

When I first made this it didn't really have much flavor. My family loves heat so I added a lot more chili sauce and some fresh garlic and let it chill for a few hours. It can out sooo good. And it was even better the next day.

I must agree with the user that stated that this recipe waS better than the other one. I did scale the ingredients to 2 servings; I didn't think I would need THAT much sauce. Thanks for the great recipe! Note - I did add rice wine vinegar - I'd add 4 TBSP to the original 10 serving yield (when scaled to 2, I used about half a teaspoon of rice wine vinegar).

I will say this is very close but I did some minor tweaks and now it's perfect. Instead of hot sauce I put cayenne pepper in it. Instead of black and white pepper I used lemon pepper and garlic pepper. For salt I used onion salt and garlic salt. It's perfect. Also the recipe given makes a lot of sauce so I divided all the ingredients by 3.

Great Sauce, though instead of a dash of hot sauce, I add 2Tbsp of Sriracha for a nice bite.

Needed some doctoring (vinegar, extra hot sauce, more garlic) but overall was very good.

The first time I tried it I used a lite rice vinegar by Marukin and it was awful. It stunk so bad I could barely eat it. The next time, I used a Japanese Rice vinegar by a company called Kame and it was darn near perfect. I'd recommend shopping for rice vinegars before you totally dismiss this recipe. It's good.

Ive been looking for this recipe!  I eat at our local Sakura often and my partner loves the shrimp dip.  HOwever, I love the other dip they tend to give us, its a brown dip but I have no idea what it is our cook wouldnt divulge much only to say it had ketchup in it.  What is is this sauce and I want the recipe! :-)  If you do know... please let me know! :-)

This was aweful!!  I LOVE the white sauce at my local Japanese restaurant (carolina style) and this was not even close.  it was so sour when I opened the blender I gagged.  Sorry about the poor review but I would give it a big 0 if it were an option.  Again, sorry.

This was amazing. It was really close to what we get in the Japanese steak house here. I did add maybe an extra 2 teaspoons of sugar, my hunny thought it was missing. Otherwise made exactly as stated and let it setup overnight in the fridge and it really brought our whole meal together.

Gross!  Nothing like the Shrimp Sauce/ Yum Yum Sauce you find in Japanese restaurants.  Tasted Horrid!

Pretty close to the Hibachi restaurants.  I've made this as written and I've also substituted French dressing for the ketchup and sugar.  I like that a little better
