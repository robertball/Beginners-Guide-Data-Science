Oh Yay ... I found a recipe that no one has tried.  These are delicious.  I chopped my cashews into smaller pieces and cooked them just below 250 degrees and they taste like caramel-y pralines only with cashews.  They are wonderful ... I would recommend this recipe to anyone who likes a little sweet & salty taste now and again!
