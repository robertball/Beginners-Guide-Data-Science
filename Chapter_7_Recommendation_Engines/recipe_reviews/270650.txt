These were delicious. I did not refrigerate the dough overnight, and they were fine. I also used a 1.5T cookie scoop, and they were still done in 15 minutes (I ended up with 28 cookies).

These were very good.  I used dark chocolate chips to set off the tahini flavor. I baked the second batch at 350 for 12 minutes because they would have needed to bake for 20 minutes at 325, as the first batch did.
