Wonderful!  They are better than the buscuits at Red Lobster! I doubled the recipe, it made 12 biscuits.  I used 1 cup all-purpose, and 1 cup whole wheat flour, and followed the direction provided to make it self-rising.  I also added 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. herb seasoning, and 1/2 tsp. black pepper.  I used paper cups instead of greasing the muffin cups.

Great recipe, especially when you need something in a pinch! Plus it's nice when you can take a handful of items you have on hand and put them together for something simple and tasty.  I added a tsp. of garlic powder and a little minced onion. I brushed the tops with a little garlic butter during baking and they came out perfect!

These were really simple to throw together. I needed a quick bread recipe to go with the potato soup I had leftover from last night. 

I used buttermilk and added a tsp. of garlic powder. I can't tell you how good these smell while they are baking.

These will compliment the soup really well.

First time I followed recipe exact and did not turn out well at all. I thought bake time seemed a little long and a little high, and I was right. After 17 minutes on 425 they were totally burnt. Next time I followed recipe exact but baked 15 minutes on 375 and was perfect, but little dry and lacking in flavor. Third time a charm- I added a little bit of parsley and garlic powder, a little more cheese and a tsp of butter... tasted just like Red Lobster biscuits! This is a good basic recipe but needed lots of tweaking, especially on the bake time and temp!

Very good. I made them as drop biscuits on parchment at 400 degrees for about 18 minutes - I don't like the messy cleanup of muffin tins. (Doubled the recipe, used baking powder substitute w/half the salt)

Delicious!!! I didn't have the self rising flour, and the substitution absolutely work just as well! I did add some chives, and baked the biscuits in a mini muffin pan. WOW! I would probably make those on a regular basis. very easy, and extremely delicious!! thanx!!

My kitchen is nearly bare, I had no cheddar cheese, so instead I used about 1/4 cup cream cheese, and a sprinkle of shredded parmesan.  They were fantastic! Very simple to make, and tasted delicious with scrambled eggs

Pretty good.  I normally ignore salt in recipes, so I cut the salt in half (I didn't have self-rising flour) and it tasted fine, not too salty or anything.  They are fairly plain, but I actually LIKE that.  The only difficulty I had was that the shredded cheese made it hard to get everything moistened when stirring it together.  Maybe next time I'll use a shredder that shreds more finely.  Here's a tip: If you fill the extra muffin cups with water, you will be burned when you open the oven, so don't lean in with your face!  I had mild burns on the skin all around my eyes...

Love them. I used the self rising flour substitution that was list and they turned out great. I doubled the batch & got nice gold cups. Next time I plan to add lots of garlic and herbs...

I did not have self-rising flour, so had to follow the tip about adding baking powder and salt to my flour.  The resulting biscuits were so salty that I couldn't eat mine.  I think this is the first time EVER that I have left a bread product unfinished.

These were very good!  They were moist, yet held together well.  I added about 1/2 cup of very finely chopped frozen broccoli that I thawed.  I made them to go with a ham & Bean soup that was not good at all, so I was very happy these came out as they became the main dish.  We will definitely make these again and again!

10 stars.   I doubled the recipe and made 24 MINI muffins. sprinkled the top with a Club House Herb mix (mostly for looks). Cooked 375 for 10 minutes.  had to let rest for ohh 30secs to get out.  and then wheee ice cold butter and warm buns.  lol I at 5 standing at counter...Hey they were minis...right???  Oh yeah I had a little batter left over but that just went on a pie plate for two BIG drop biscuits.  so I guess that depends on your size of tin.  will be making these again and again.  They really were great.

Delicious, and surprisingly crispy on the outside. I used mozzarella and parmesan and it still tasted a lot like the Red Lobster biscuits.   I added ~1/2 - 1 tsp each dried parsley, oregano, basil & minced garlic, as well as pepper; I think adding them was a must for flavour. I didn't use up all the liquid and the dough was still awfully moist once mixed. I only had regular flour, but added half the salt, which was for the best - the cheese adds saltiness (good thing I didn't use cheddar!!). Overcooked the biscuits (helps explain the crispyness) a bit in aiming for that "golden brown" colour - will probably cook 20-25 minutes next time. Got 7 biscuits from the original proportions. Using non-stick spray, I could pop the biscuits right out after.   This is my first time making biscuits, and I'm very pleased with this recipe. It was very easy and a definite success. I used skim milk and light cheese & mayonnaise, so as far as delicious cheesy biscuits go this would have to be one of the lighter options. Will double the recipe next time.

These were TO DIE FOR!! I did add 1/2 tsp. garlic flakes and 1/2 tsp. basil to the flour cheese mixture. Every bit as good as Red Lobster cheddar biscuits. We had them with leftover chili and it was awesome. Thanks for sharing!!!!

Yum!  I made no changes and really enjoyed this recipe.  I was surprised by how much flavor it had.  I'll definitely double it next time.  I can't believe how good this was for how easy it was to make.  Another bonus is it uses ingredients I always have on hand.

Yum!  I doubled the recipe and made a dozen to go with some chili.  I used 1.5 cups (sifted) whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup cornmeal.  I halved the recommended salt and used garlic salt to boost the flavor, along with garlic powder, onion powder, thyme and sage (1/2 tsp each).  I also added a splash of vegetable oil.  I baked them for 17 minutes at 375 and they turned out perfectly!  DH loved them, as did I.  Thanks!

These were fast, easy, and quite tasty.  I didn't change anything, but I think that next time I might add some dill or chives.  But that's just me.  On their own they're still quite good.  Thanks!

The minute my picky niece saw the biscuits, she exclaimed “I don’t like these biscuits”. Alas! In five minutes, after being persuaded just to taste them, she was impatiently asking for a second batch. I used feta cheese instead and also added a pinch of pepper and ½ teaspoon oregano. So easy!!!

Used the suggestion of 1 cup self rising/1 cup of wheat flour (with the 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp kosher salt each) doubling milk and mayo (may try with sour cream instead of mayo next time), 2 1/4 cups finely shredded cheddar cheese, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp Italian herbs, 1/4 tsp paprika and 1 tsp pepper, lined with paper cups and topped with more cheddar cheese.  In the oven for approx 12 min at 400*F( my oven is extremely hot).

These were great and very easy. I doubled the recipe and made 12. Had to sub miracle whip (out of mayo) and that worked fine. I added some freshly chopped parsley from the garden and fresh cracked pepper. Next time I will add chives and garlic powder. Served with corned beef and cabbage in the slow cooker. Note: I tried using the muffin liners as suggested but the muffins stuck to them terribly. Next time just grease the pan as the recipe states.

Super fast & easy and totally adaptable to just about any kind of cheese.  I added some fresh chopped basil & an Italian cheese blend.  Perfect with a chef's salad!  One note:  If you're using paper liners, let them cool considerably and the paper will peel off far cleaner than when they're warm.

Pretty tasty. Made 12 using AP flour with baking powder and less salt sub. Easy to put together. I may add a few spices and more cheese the next time. Thanks Sara!

These are super easy to make. I added fresh parsley, ground pepper, chives and a herb and garlic spice blend. I think bacon or ham would also be a nice addition.

I love this easy recipe!  I made these bisquits in mini cupcake tins and they came out so adorable!  I also added some garlic powder and Old Bay Seasoning and they came out like the Cheddar Bay Bisquits from Red Lobster...delicious!  Also, when I took them out of the oven, I grated more cheddar cheese on top of them...the heat of the bisquits melted the cheese on top and made it even better!

I make these a couple times a week because they're just soooo easy.  I add garlic powder and a bit more cheese than the recipe calls for in order to up the salt (otherwise they end up a bit bland).  Mine usually cook a few minutes faster than the recipe states (and I cook them at 375).  I also sometimes just drop these in half-shaped buns onto a cookie sheet and they taste just as good.  I've used regular self-rising flour and made my own according to the recipe - both work great.  I sometimes add a bit of butter as well, per the recommendation of another reviewer.  Fabulous recipe in exchange for so little time commitment.

Thank you so much Sarah for this wonderful recipe. I didn't change a thing except to double the recipe. I am a make from scratch cook, and these biscuts paired perfectly with my homemade potato , bacon, and corn chowder. So easy to put together, a real time saver. Will add these to my favorite recipes box.

These are a bit dry as is.  I put a small tab of butter on top of each before baking and it helps a little.  Cutting butter in also helps. I've also added spices and that makes them even better.  Garlic works well. :-)

I don't know what I did wrong. I doubled the recipe and used self-rising flour.  They are very salty and not good.  Being a farm boy from Texas, I was hoping for a taste of home...not so much!  On to the next recipe for biscuits.  Sorry...

I didn't have self-rising flour on me, so I substituted with all-purpose and salt and baking soda (didn't have baking powder). Apparently, that doesn't work b/c it was terrible. I'm going to give this recipe another try w/ either baking powder instead of the baking soda, or with self-rising flour. But for any of you out there thinking of using baking soda instead of the baking powder -- DONT!

Very yummy biscuits. I didn't have any self-rising flour so I had to use the substitution (using only half the salt it called for as many others said theirs were too salty). I also added a little garlic powder and italian seasoning to give them some extra flavour. These came out perfect after exactly 17 minutes. These are quick and easy and they make a great side to soups. I will be making these often.

I usually dont rate recipes when I make substantial changes, but I wanted to share. I seasoned (to taste, as always) with chives, onion powder, cracked black pepper then I added 1 egg to the mixture. I made in a mini muffin pan. They turned out great. Slightly chewy, very dense, not at all crumbly. I will make these again, since I always have the ingredients on hand.

I followed the recipe as written and these turned out horrible!  They were not done in the 17-20 minutes, It was hard to mix and they don't have much flavor.  We will not be making these again.

I made two batches of these, one with cheddar and chives, one with feta and oregano. I used 1 cup of cheddar and 3/4 cup feta. Each batch made 6 muffins. I preferred the feta ones, and my husband preferred the cheddar ones, and the kids just gobbled up all the rest. Light and flaky. Thanks for the easy recipe!

excellent recipe! I doubled the recipe (I used all-purpose flour plus the extra baking powder and salt- worked just fine)and added a little extra ground rosemary (about tsp.), cayenne pepper (1/2 tsp maybe?)and about another tsp of italian seasoning. Everyone gobbled them up! I thought the mix would be more batter-like, but I just ended up using my hands and a spoon to put it in the muffin cups. I also yielded 12 biscuits with the doubled recipe and had to add a little extra milk to moisten all the flour. Still give it 5 stars though because the recipe is so flexible!

I didn't read the reviews before I made these and used paper muffin cups. They did not want to let go! However, the flavour was good and they were not bad the following day, also easier to get out of the paper for some reason! Thanks for the recipe. Will make again but grease the tins next time!

Very easy to put together. I had to use the substitute for self-rising flour. The taste was quite good but for some reason they were quite crunchy. Not at all what I was expecting and I'm not sure why they were. I'll try them again some time.

I was looking for a dumpling recipe when I found this one for biscuits.This works great and tastes great as long as you add 1 egg to the recipe. Without the egg they fall apart not that my husband seemed to notice. I forgot to add the garlic. I bet they taste even better with the garlic. Thank you

These were great! I added some herb and garlic spice mix and cut them open after they cooled down a bit and spread more cheese inside. Then I served with scrambled eggs and ham. I will probably make these every weekend and take leftovers to work during the week! YUMMY!

I'd like to try them again with more adjustments.  I gave them a go as the directions had it and they were bland (not bad, just bland).  I made them again with buttermilk instead of milk; I added 2 tbsp fresh parsley, 1/2 tsp of Old Bay, and a 1/2 tsp of garlic.  That helped, but I think they just need more salt for my liking.  I also think I would like them more if I made them in corn-bread-style tins (more crunchy surface area!).

I also did the drop biscuits (used 1/4 C cup to scoop) on a Silpat pad for 16-18 minutes at 400 degrees. Multiplied the recipe to yield 24 servings and added 2 4oz cans of jalapenos (well drained!) Medium on the spicy scale, if you want less zing go for just 1 can of jalapenos. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!!

Made these with dinner last night. Didnt have the flour or biscuit mix so I used pancake mix. They were light, fluffy and delicious. 4 kids said they were the best they ever had.

Delicious and easy! I didn't use the muffin cups, I made them as drop biscuits. I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder to give it flavor. Mine took about 10 minutes to cook in the oven.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed these. I added seasonings. I think they are crucial to making the biscuits taste like the ones at Red Lobster. Also, I cooked them at 400 degrees for about 18 minutes.

Used half whole wheat flour, and did the powder & salt to make my own self-rising flour. I did half the salt like other said. I also did drop biscuits on parchment, at 400 for 20 minutes. YUM! I probably used a little more than half a cup cheese too:)

loved this recipe, it was so easy and delicious.  I did make some changes to it though, I ended up cooking them about 13 minutes and they were perfect.  next time though, I will add garlic powder as I think that will make them even better

I had no mayo so I used ranch salad dressing and it gave them a really good taste. Instead of a using muffin pan I spooned on a parchment paper. Really really easy and great for company!

This recipe has become a staple in our cooking-for-two household. We rarely eat bread or keep it in stock, but this is perfect for accompanying soups or saucy dishes that just need a little bread on the side. We often brush the tops with garlic butter right out of the oven.  I use the self-rising flour substitute that was given, and make 4 larger biscuits instead of 5. They cook perfectly in 18 minutes every time in my toaster oven. So simple and so nice!

quick easy recipe with a mild cheesy flavor. They came out very moist. I would be comfortable serving these to guests.   Bonus points for not having "use a buttermilk biscuit mix" in the recipe!

Made this recipe for the first time today, followed the instructions for substitution of self-rising flour, and like a couple reviewers, added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and black pepper.  Filled six mini-muffin cups. Came out very tasty, but not as moist as I was hoping.  Perhaps I will add a little more milk/mayo next time.

This was my first time ever making biscuits.  My husband and I liked them very much.  They turned out very delicious.  I did not use a muffin tin because I do not own one.  So instead, I dropped them from a teaspoon.  It only made five biscuits for us but however, they were enough for the two of us.  I will make them again until I get them right.  The texture was not as fluffy as I thought it should be so I will keep on making them until they come out perfectly for me.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I especially liked the  use of four ingredients.  Once again thanks for the great tasting and easy recipe.

Fast and easy, and a great tip about the self-rising flour.  4 rather than 5 because they're lacking something flavor-wise, but I can't put a finger on what that is.

I was looking for an easy recipe to use up Self-Rising Flour and these were great.  Though I made a bunch of changes.  I added about a tsp Garlic powder and 1/2tsp black pepper.  I also subbed Buttermilk for the milk and some cream cheese for the mayo because I needed to use them up.  I just made them as drop biscuits and they had a nice crispiness on the outside, but were moist on the inside.

These were so easy to make and so good!--I would omit the salt if subbing the self-rising for the all-purpose flour.  I added some garlic powder to mine and were amazing!---

My husband forgot to pick up the instant biscuits that we were planning on having with our southern feast this afternoon so I was looking for a quick and easy recipe without a lot of ingredients. I was also looking for biscuits that I didn't have to roll out because our kitchen is small and I don't have enough room to do that while my husband is cooking with me. These were great! I didn't have self rising flour but the substitution worked out fine although I did cut the salt to a 1/4 tsp after reading the reviews. We're going to make these again next weekend. I think I'll add some diced green chili's to give them a southwestern kick since we'll be visiting family in Texas. Yum!

These biscuits are SO easy to make. I do prefer "traditional" style where you cut in the butter, it makes a nicer texture. They were still really yummy though. Added some dill and black pepper but otherwise made these as stated.

I've made these 3 different ways now.  The first time I had to use the flour substitute because I had no self rising flour. that basic recipe is ok.  This time I got a bit crazy. Decided to blend together some of the reviews to see what I'd get.  One batch I just added a few tablespoons of cream cheese with half a cup of mild cheddar and pinch of garlic powder.  The second batch I added crumbled bacon (2 pieces), a few tablespoons of cream cheese, half cup of mild cheddar and a fresh small jalapeno without the seeds diced very fine, and about 1/4 tsp of garlic powder.  So far the last recipe has been my favorite but I still think it's lacking something.  I loved the texture way better with the addition of the cream cheese but it made the mixture very moist which made it stick quite a bit to the paper cups.   Just a note- paper cups are a BAD idea for this recipe.  They stuck SO badly to the muffin/biscuits.  Next time, I will add more spice (maybe some of the seeds with the jalapeno) and cut out the garlic. As much as I love garlic, I just didn't like it in this biscuit.

My biscuits came out well as far as being soft and taste was good, except too cheesy. However, that's personal tast plus i made the mistake of mixing two brands of cheese..one of which i didnt like in the first place. the non cheese part was perfect. i will try the non cheese version next.

I am not normally a baker however this recipe is easy enough. I do feel that they need to cook more like 30 min so they are not doughey in the middle. Outsides of it tasted well enough but the inside was tart. My opinon because they did not cook long enough at 17 min to 20

I loved this recipe. Had to use the sub for the self rising flour but it did not affect the outcome. My fiancee loves cheese so I added 1/2 cup more & they came out wnderful. Definitely a keeper...

Wow, I can't believe how easy these were to make! I used the baking powder/salt recipe and they were perfect - not too salty at all for my taste, in fact, I should have added more spices to the recipe other than just a sprinkle of garlic powder to the tops of the biscuits. I will be making these again!

I don't know what I did wrong, but mine turned out horribly. They were too floury and they were not at all flavorful or good. it was impossible to mix w/that little wet ingredients, except it said mix just until moistened. We ended up throwing them out. =(

I liked the cheesy taste of these, but they needed more wet ingredients in order for it to mix. Not too bad, but not something my husband and I will try again.

This recipe was super easy and fast.  They were fairly plain but could easily be added to to make them more interesting.

This was really easy to make, and they are good, just a bit plain. i added tons of butter to the tops when they were finished and warmed it in the oven for a bit, made them 10x better :)

Love this recipe!  So easy to make.  I always double the recipe, use the self rising flour substitute given, add 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 very old cheese and a pop of our own homemade 'bam'.

Easy and delicious. I'm always worried about substitutes but considering I had no self-rising flour I gave it a shot. Turned out excellent!

they're fast and they're flavorful. I doubled the recipe and I used 1 cup of corn meal and 1 cup of pancake mix instead of regular flour. It made 8, and I also added dried cranberries to half of them. Which was a good call, next time I would add even more cranberries to all of them.

These were pretty good.  I doubled the recipe and followed another reviewers recommendation of using 1 cup of all purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour.  Adding the baking soda (only added 1/4 tsp salt) worked really well.  I also added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder.  My picky five year olds REALLY liked these.  I'll definitely be making them again.

These biscuits were great. They would have been better if I had realized I hadn't used self rising flour and they turned out a little flat! :) Quick and easy and I like how I didn't have to roll out any dough! I did add some garlic powder and Italian herbs though!

Very dense biscuit! I think it was the milk. I might try using water next time instead and they will be lighter like the red lobster biscuits. I added 1/2 tsp of herbs de provence, 1/4 tsp garlic salt, and 1/4 tsp. onion powder. Then I used the same seasonings mixed with melted butter to brush onto the biscuits after baking. My sisters and I each ate 2 right away!

Maybe I should have added some other ingredients like a few of the viewers suggested. I actually checked my ingredients afterward to make sure they weren't bad. I found the biscuits to lack flavor, unless you count an oily taste as flavor.

I was craving biscuits, and this really hit the spot! I added some garlic salt instead of regular salt, and dry spinach/dill dip seasoning also. I like a lot of flavor though, so next time, I'll be adding more cheese and garlic salt!

These were good! I doubled the recipe and it made 12 biscuits for me. I added some garlic powder and fresh chopped dill to the mix and after they came out of the oven I brushed garlic dill butter on top. They are basically like the garlic and cheese drop biscuits, only in a muffin cup. Thanks for sharing!

These turned out very good. I was thinking that the amount of cheese would be too much because I used extra Sharp Cheddar, but it wasn't at all. Super fluffy on the inside and just right on the outside. If I make these for dinner I think I will add some herbs or garlic. Thanks for the recipe!

These biscuits were wonderful! I made them to go with baked potato soup snd they were the perfect match. They turned out so moist and flavorful, and though great on their own i think I will do like some of the others and put a little garlic salt next time. Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this recipe and I think it is terrific.  Very simple to follow and quick from bowl to table.  I used all purpose flour and followed directions for quick rise flour.  I doubled the recipe and used a 12 muffin tin.  I think this would be great in a mini muffin tin and used as an appetizer with dipping sauces.  Very versatile recipe.  I love the idea of being able to add anything I want to this.

Soooooo good! I doubled the recipe and used the substitute flour mixture for the flour because I only had all purpose. They turned out amazing! This is one of those recipes that take little to no time at all to make and comes out perfect. I only had to bake them for 17min! Very rewarding and very tasty!

This recipe is super easy and fun. Im a novice baker and I made it for a church meeting. I added bacon, 1/2 a tsp of black pepper, 1/2tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of "italian seasoning" (bc i couldn't find dried thyme). In the future I might not add so much black pepper- it made the biscuiits taste a little spicy to me. Everyone at church loved them, though!
