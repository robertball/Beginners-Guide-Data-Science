Amazing cake!  I didn't know whether to use a cake mix with pudding or without.  So I took a chance and used a cake mix with pudding and then I still added the instant vanilla pudding.  Wonderful, very moist.  I thought it would be to much chocolate but it was perfect.  I was worried the powdered sugar would melt because you put it on the chocolate which is kinda melted so I stuck it in the refrigerator for 5 minutes and the powdered sugar was still there the next day.  My husband took the leftovers to work the next day and everyone loved it.

This was an amazingly easy and moist cake.  I made it in a Bundt pan and used chocolate frosting.  Great!

My mother passed this same recipe down to me. This is a delicious cake! We brought it once to a friend's house for dinner and now every time we come for dinner, they request this cake. Try it - you won't be disappointed.

very simple and sure you can't ask for a quicker way to prepare a cake! Only I don't really understand the grated chocolate in the batter. Well, I wouldn't say this cake is ok for company at a formal dinner, but it goes well with a cup of coffee or a glass of milk. I can add it stays moist and nice (this is the 3rd day...)

This was really good, but not amazing.  Grating the German chocolate bar took forever and I gave up and just used extra mini chips.  It was really moist, but I think some chocolate frosting would make it even better.  All-in-all, I would make again, but probably would frost for better taste and appearance.
