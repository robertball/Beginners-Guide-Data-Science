The flavor is great and it reheats well. If you like the sauce from TGIFriday then don't alter the recipe, but do double the simmering time. With so much liquid, it needs more time to reduce than 15 minutes. I'm giving 4 stars for that reason. Be sure to watch the pot while cooking. It will boil over or worse catch on fire(Alcohol + sugar). I caught mine right before it boiled over.

We had this on grilled chicken breasts.  It was good, different and a nice change from BBQ sauce.  I made the mistake of walking away from the stove while it was cooking though.  DO NOT do this.  The whiskey makes it boil very quickly, I am still three days later trying to get the caramelized mess up.  The sauce didn't get as thick as I would have liked though.  It was a little watery and all of my sugar did not disolve.  I will cut the sugar back by 1/4 cup if I make this again.

Very good! I grilled chicken breast, brushed them with the glaze, topped them with bacon & pepper jack cheese and sandwiched it between cibatta bread. I will definitely make this again and try it on new things too!

It is best when used as soon as it is off the stove.  Don't wait and heat it up again.

This was delicious! Made it exact and watched it the entire time it was cooking on the stove so there were no accidents. My husband absolutely love this and he is a very picky man! Much easier than I thought it would be and a wonderful taste!

This recipe is great, but for those who would like it thicker, instead of cooking it down for so long, just add a bit of corn starch.  be sure to add it slowly, while stirring, as it gets thick quick.  about a tablespoon, maybe less, should do the trick just fine...

I served this glaze over a pecan crusted chicken for Christmas dinner this year.  My guests raved about it, and everyone asked for the recipe!  I let it simmer a little longer than the recipe called for, but other than that, I didn't change a thing.  This sauce is fabulous!  Very reminicent of the Jack Daniels glaze served at TGIFridays.

5 stars for flavor (very tasty), but four stars four consistency. I was trying to duplicate the whiskey sauce at TGIFs and this was too thin. Next time I would either thicken with a bit of cornstarch or reduce it for alot longer. BTW I used Jack Daniels for an authentic flavor.Thanks for sharing!

This was awesome! I didn't have any pineapple juice, so I used canned pineapple tidbits instead.  It was excellent!  A bit spicy for some of the relatives, though, but still very wonderful!

This glaze is to die for!!! If anyone has ever been to TGIFriday's, and tasted their Jack Daniel's Burger, this stuff is like the sauce they serve with it. Could be because I splurged and made it with JD, but it is simply wonderful. Only thing is, is that I would like to figure out how to get it a bit thicker, and then get some of those little sauce dishes for dipping!!!

Boy, was this gooooooood! I used it on steaks after first dry-rubbing them with a Canadian steak seasoning and letting them sit in sealed bags in the refrigerator for two days prior to grilling.  I made this glaze earlier in the day, and kept it warm on my stovetop until ready to use.  All my guests raved about it!  Great recipe, thanks!

Kids and husband raved over this when I put it on broiled chicken and pork steaks and everyone asked me to make this again.  Husband poured leftover sauce on rice and couldn't help it...good enough to drink!

This tasted very similar to the popular restaurant variety of whiskey glaze.  I made this several times and it was delicious.  I did marinade the chicken in the some of the glaze prior to grilling just to give it a little more of that flavor.

I wasn't paying close enough attention and added beef broth instead of bullion.  I just let it boil for a long time and then added a little corn starch to thicken.  I still prefer my steak with Chimichurri sauce, but this tastes great if you're looking for something sweet.

Yummy.  Tried on ribs. Will cut down on whiskey next time I make for my daughter as taste is too strong for her.   Different and delicious.  Will try again on different meats.

I have been trying to copy the sauce that they make at TGI Friday's and could not until now. You are a genius. Thank you soooo much for this recipe. Steaks and chicken have never been better. I could actually eat this sauce everyday with anything that I make. Job Well Done!

Taste just like TGIF. I took one star off because the consistency is watery after 15 mins. I cooked mine down for about 40 minutes alternating between low to medium heat. I served with Cajun sweet potato fries. OMG YUMMY!

I substituted a small can of crushed pineapple instead of juice, and it was very yummy served over chicken breasts.  I saved the leftovers in a jar to use another time on some other meat, perhaps over meatloaf as previously done by another reviewer.

I made this glaze using a Mango Habanero Whiskey, used crushed pineapple (1/4 of the cup was pineapple) ,and omitted the hot sauce and beef bouillon. The Habanero was light on the back side so you could always add some hot sauce. In our current world of so many "flavors" of Whiskey why not be creative?

Easy and awesome!
Made this yesterday, only comment is that it didn't quite thicken up like a glaze should - added 2 Tbsp of corn starch slowly while simmering and got a nice consistency.

Here's what I did: slow cooked some bratwurst in this glaze on the stove, then finished them up on the grill. Used the pineapple chunks (that I got the juice from) and cooked them up in the glaze, finished them off with a quick bake in the oven. Chopped some onions and sauteed them in coconut oil, then added some of the glaze and reduced. Used these to top the brats. Simply amazing. Had some veggie skewers on the grill too - leftovers went into a Tupperware with the remaining glaze and brat bits to make a nice lunch for Monday!

This was soooooo good. I used rum extract instead of whiskey and only half the brown sugar.  I used this as a glaze for meatloaf.

Made this exactly as the recipe requests and it was delicious. I even drizzled the extra marinade as a delicious salad dressing . I'll be trying this on burgers, chicken, and salmon as well!

This is similar to TGIFriday's sauce but not quite the same.  Also, mine came out really thin and I couldn't get it to thicken even with cornstarch.

Nice and sticky for my tenderloin/vege kabobs, on the grill.  Only thing I did a bit different was 3 tbs Worchester and 1 tbs Teriyaki sauce in place of the 4th tbs of Worchester. As other reviewers said, simmer for about a half hour for right consistency.  The family loved it! Thanks for posting this recipe, I had it years ago, but had lost it.

Easy fix to make the sauce thicker without changing recipe.  Make sure you have a large enough pot to contain the liquid as it rises and boils.  A thick good quality pot is perferable. Just boil all ingredients but whisky to a rolling boil and continue to boil for about 5 minutes, stiring often.  Vary time slightly according to how thick you want it (it will thicken more as it cools). Add the whiskey during the last minute to burn off alcohol or after it is taken off the stove for a more potent all adult recipe. Remember...it will really rise up in the pan when you add the alcohol and you need to really keep stiring until you take it off. 

Thank you for the recipe, Kelly.  purrr-fect...

This did not taste like TGI Friday's. I was hoping it would. Too strong of a whiskey flavor, but not really bad overall.

I used this on Cornish hens and it was excellent.  I did increase the hot sauce a bit because we like it a little spicier, and I simmered it closer to 40 minutes to thicken it, otherwise it was wonderful.
