I was looking for a loaded baked potato/home fries, and this filled the bill.  I microwaved the peeled, raw cubes for about 6 minutes rather than boiling.  Then followed the directions completely.  My family was ecstatic!  I should have served sour cream - they were that authentic!  Thanks so much!

FANTASTIC!!!!! We all LOVED everything about these potatoes. Next time I may try to just roast the potatoes and save the step of boiling them first, just to see if there's a difference. I will def be making these again and again~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

These tasted good - the ones that hadn't burned to a crisp in my oven though.  I don't know if it was my oven, if it was the size of the potatoes or what - but 30 minutes seemed too long after I had boiled them.  I think next time I'll just roast them longer at a lower temp the way I usually do, then finish them the same way.  The bacon and parmesan was delicious!  Thanks!

This method does take a little longer than I hoped when I decided to make a side dish, so dinner was later than planned.  However, these were really tasty.  I did use garlic powder since that is what I had on hand, and that worked fine.  I might try a shortcut later as others suggested, to see if they turn out as well, but now that Iâ€™ve made these, I know what to plan for. And I will likely make them again.
