I used less of everything and loved it!  1/8c evoo, 1/8c sherry, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, more garlic, much less fresh rosemary and it was so light and tasty. Will make this all the time!  Thank you.

This was GOOD! 

New to Arctic Char, I tried your recipe because of your tagline that you couldn't find anything that sounded good enough online so you just made up your own.  This is my usual "M/O".

I used 2T of lemon juice (husband hates lime...!?) and 1 teaspoon of dried rosemary (didn't have fresh) but otherwise followed exactly.

Ideal internal temp "they" say is 140, so, I usually go a hair LESS (138 in this case would be ideal, think).  

Temperature was 125 at 12 minutes; 133 at 17 minutes and 144 at 22 minutes; so while it WAS *awesome* (flavor/seasoning) and I give it 5 stars, next time I will leave it in for 20 min. @ 400 and broil for the last 2 minutes.  

FYI, I had three good size filets on parchment in a glass baking dish.  (it makes a difference!) 

Beautiful fish!!  Thank you so much, and I hope this review helps others.  It may be that the foil you use, acts as a heat conductor and cooks it faster than it does on parchment. 
Thanks again...GREAT fish.

This dish came out really good, i used on the stove top for quickness; i seared the fish in olive oil, seasoned fish with salt and pepper, and used garlic powder, and garlic salt, in the wine marinade. Tossed the marinade in with the fish, while it was searing, only took about 3-5 minutes, instead of in the oven. scrumpy delish!

I followed the recipe except used dry white wine instead of the sherry.  I thought it was very good but my husband thought there was to much rosemary.  If I make it again I will cut down on the rosemary.

I rarely write reviews, but this dish deserves one!  It's great!!  One of the best fish dishes I have tried!  I had never had Char before, but it was on sale.  The fish is similar to a very mild salmon...which I actually enjoyed better than salmon.  The sauce is absolutely wonderful and could probably be used on almost any fish.  

I had 1.5 lbs of fish, so I doubled the sauce.  I was a little concerned about doubling the garlic and rosemary, so I used the following:  1/2 c. olive oil, 1/2 c. sherry, 3 sprigs of rosemary, 2 cloves of garlic (frozen pods), and the zest and juice of 2 small limes.  It was perfect, although the ingredients as listed would probably have been great too!

I blended the sauce in the blender and spooned it over the fish in a glass pyrex coated with avocado oil (no foil).  Then I sprinkled the salt, pepper and cayenne over the fish and baked it.  I had extra sauce, so I brought that to a boil on the stove to use for additional sauce...so glad I had extra, because I almost wanted to drown the fish in it, it was so good.  We had  the Quinoa Tabbouli salad on this site with it, which was perfect.  Or you could serve with rice or plain quinoa and spoon the sauce over.  Can you tell I love the sauce??  Thank you for the recipe, melanieni!!!

My family really enjoyed the arctic char (a whole fish), less fishy than salmon and the marinade.  I did modify it a bit to use fresh tarragon instead of rosemary.  I was afraid the lime juice would make it too acidic but that wasn't the case.  I just brushed the marinade on the fish a couple of times and not let it soak the whole fish.  The marinade was very runny and seemed to be alot to soak in.

The rosemary was slightly overpowering to me. I would use just a little less than called for.

I left out the sherry due to dietary restrictions but it was still divinely delicious. I didn't have to spoon the sauce back over the top at the halfway point because the creamy light green sauce still covered the fish quite well. Thank you! I think Arctic char is my new favourite fish.

We followed this recipe to the letter and it was quite tasty. The whole house smelled good while we waited for the timer. We will be sure to keep it handy for the next time we spot Char at the store!

Really enjoyed it.  Next time, I will switch to broil at around 10 minutes so the top gets more crisped and the interior fish isn't quite as well-done. The flavors were great.

Very good and very easy! I didn’t put any of the ingredients in the food processor, just mixed them together and poured them over the char. I roasted vegetables on a baking sheet in the same oven and dinner was served!

Thanks for the great recipe! I made it as directed except used lemon instead of lime (all I had on hand) and it was perfect! This was the first time I used char (we're huge salmon fans) and I'm glad to find an alternative to one of my fav fishes. My  toddler loved it too.

Excellent. Came out very moist and tasty.  We like hot food, but this was not as hot as you might expect with a teaspoon of cayenne in it.

First time cooking Arctic char, and I lucked onto this recipe. Oh my, it was so good! I used dried rosemary, possibly less than called for. Didn’t have a lime, so I zested a lemon and used bottled lime juice. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I used garlic bought today from a farm stand, super fresh. Also farm fresh broccoli on the side. I’ll be using this recipe again for sure, and the sauce for other fish, like salmon and trout. Thank you, this is a winner!

This was a phenomenal recipe!  The grocery stire was out if organic limes, so since the recipe called for zesting, I opted to substitute lime salt for the zest. The cooking time was perfect and the badting interval helped the fish stay moist. I will cook this again and again! Thank you for sharing your innovation!

This was such a easy and tasty way to do fish. I did cut back on the rosemary like suggested and tasted great, not over powering.

This was excellent.  My only changes were to reduce the amount of olive oil to 2 T.  I didn't have rosemary so I sprinkled with a little bit of dried thyme.  It was very, very good.  Will try with rosemary  next time.

It's quite good, but, there's a comment here that says "aluminum foil can be used for faster cleanup".

When you're using citrus, never combine citrus and aluminum foil.  Aluminum is highly reactive with citrus and can make the fish very bitter. 

I cooked this in a cast iron pan in the oven, was wonderful.

this was very good! I made it as shone but used parchment paper instead of foil. There was just enough flavor in marinade to not overpower the lite char.  Will use this recipe again!

Was a little hesitant at first because of the strong flavors for such a delicate fish. Anyway, I gave it a shot and more or less followed the recipe. The main difference was I used roasted garlic because I had some on hand from another dish I was cooking. I also used half Meyer lemon juice and half lime juice because I was running short on limes but happened to have Meyer lemons. I also used Amontillado sherry, because that's was I happened to have. I put everything in the blender, including the cayenne pepper, black pepper, and sea salt,  poured it over the fish, and baked for 12 minutes, as the recipe recommended. It was delicious. I think using roasted garlic helped.

I had to use dried rosemary, but followed the recipe faithfully otherwise.  The fish had a nice crust after the broiling process of the last two minutes.  I was wishing for a bit more oomph to the sauce.  Not sure how I might do it differently on the next try.

Excellent recipe!
The fishmonger only had one filet of arctic char, so I also bought a filet of trout and tilapia.
I did not add the sherry wine nor the cayenne and baked this on the BBQ. I aloso followed the suggestions from the other posters and used less rosemary.
Would defiitely make it again!
My only regret is that I forgot which filet was the trout and which filet was the  arctic char (one was more dense, and the other was more "silky" like salmon.

Looking forward to marking this again!

I was unwilling to run out and buy a lime ( had everything else). So I used a Meyer lemon, and it was great!

One of the best fish recipes ever!  Maybe it's because I never had char and loved it or maybe the marinade was so good.  I think it was a combo and that I grilled it.  Fabulous dish!!

This was so easy and so flavorful!  I made it exactly as written.  The lime added a distinctive flavor.  I'll be making this again a lot!

This recipe was truly delicious - a great blend of flavours that accented, not overwhelmed, the delicate flavour of the arctic char.  Delicious!!
