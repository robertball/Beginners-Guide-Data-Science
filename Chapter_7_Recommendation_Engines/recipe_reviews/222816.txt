While I love the idea of a lower-fat coleslaw...this recipe is a good base for add on's. The recipe was easy to follow, quick to put together. But where I found lacking, is spice. While it had a zip, it didn't have that flavor I traditionally love in coleslaws. You will have to build with your own selections of spices to get it to the level of pizzazz. I needed black pepper, celery seed and celery salt. As written, again a good base for lower-fat, just needs more umph.

This was good for a lower fat, healthier option.  I didn't add the milk (didn't have any), but still coated the cabbage lightly.  I agree with other reviewers that you need to add some other seasonings; I added celery seed and pepper for more flavour.

Surprisingly good.   I like  it as good as any other recipe for coleslaw, if not better.   Better, because I can't taste any guilt!

I use regular mayo and whole milk.   I mean, come one, it's 2 Tbsp and 1/4 cup for a full recipe, and light mayo doesn't cut it for me.    I might go with 2% on the milk, but why?   I used green onion and rice wine vinegar in place of the white.   I also used bagged coleslaw, so sue me!   But one tip I learned and applied here, is to dice up the cabbage and carrots really small, like at KFC.  So I dice the bagged coleslaw, not just toss it in as it comes from the bag.   The smaller dices really make a differnce in the flavor profile.  Try it!

I understand most cole slaw recipes call for some type of vinegar, but to my husband and I, it tasted like vinegar.  I did add your typical celery seed and celery salt, as I don't think a cole slaw recipe should be without it.  We just couldn't get past the vinegar taste in this one.  Maybe only 1 tbsp. of apple cider vinegar would be enough.  Two tbsps. of 2 different vinegars is just way too much.  So glad this wasn't served to friends or family.  Had to add a little mustard to kill the strong vinegar taste.  This recipe, to us, needs some tweaking.

Seemed like way too much salt to me. It was good otherwise and I love a low fat option. I'd definitely make it again, just with way less salt.

Very dry if made exactly step by step, we added four more tablespoons of mayo (low fat) and it was moist then with an extra sprinkle of sugar to cut the tartness, but otherwise great

Followed the recipe exactly and it was ridiculously salty. To the point where it can't be eaten on it's own. Will cut the salt in half (at least) next time

I modified this a bit by using plain yogurt instead of mayonnaise and did not use any milk.  It was good.  Next time I will add more seasoning to it

I followed this recipe but added 2 tablespoons of dill relish (will add more next time) and used a store bought bag of broccoli slaw instead of cabbage. This was great and even my husband liked it. I think some celery seed might make it pop. This is a great base recipe to experiment on and customize.

as written it needs more seasoning. for a package of pre chopped coleslaw i doubled the milk and mayo. added pepper and celery seed. I just used cider vinegar and omitted the sugar. that helped a lot to add more seasoning

Very good. Used Lactaide 2% milk. Used food processor to slice up full head of purple & green cabbage, 4 carrots, 1/4 yellow onion, and baby celery ribs with leaves.
Makes alot!

AWESOME!!  This is SO yummy and not sweet!  I made half the recipe since I only had half of a bag of slaw on hand.  After tasting the dressing before letting it "rest", I was not too thrilled with the strong lemon taste.  However, after mixing it with the slaw and refrigerating for a few hours it was perfect!   Thanks so much!

Had a cookout and made this coleslaw dressing.  Everyone loved it.  Could not get over how good the dressing was.  I did follow another reviewer and added celery seed and celery salt.

Shockingly delicious! I followed the recipe to a T accept subbing Truvia baking blend for the sugar.

Used a bag of pre-shredded cabbage and this was super easy!  Perfect ingredients and used it on pulled chicken sandwiches made in the crockpot.  Great recipe.

Truvia brown sugar blend, just apple cider vinegar (same total vinegar amount), and a squirt of yellow mustard.  Big hit!

Really great coleslaw! 

I'm really pleased with how the flavors came together.  I will say that the celery seed and pepper additions were critical to rounding it out, however.  It comes out as a very VERY light/thin coating on the veggies (fine to me; it was a tortilla topping anyway) and I didn't even use as much cabbage as directed.

For a low fat cole slaw, this is a great base recipe! I usually use a bag of cole slaw mix to save time and add a few extras depending on my mood; celery or seasoned salt, green onions or red onions, and fresh cilantro, basil, parsley. Whatever is fresh in the garden. Yes, it's a little plain - but a great healthier alternative to typical slaw.

Loved it, but as said before, was lacking spice, so I added 2 tbsp of spicy mustard and it turned out great! Used Stevia instead of sugar as well so it is Omni Phase 3 approved :)

I decreased the salt to 1/2 teaspoon then followed the recipe exactly for the dressing. It was not thick enough for my taste and I added another tablespoon of low fat mayo, then added a teaspoon of celery seeds and some cracked pepper. If you like very thin cole slaw dressing, use the full amount of milk.  If not, start with just 2 tablespoons and see if it is thick enough for you.  I did not let the dressing sit before adding it to the broccoli slaw bag and refrigerated for about 5 hrs before dinner. Flavorwise this didn't work for us - it tasted like diluted mayo. We won't have this again.  Thanks for sharing though.

I really liked the basics of the recipe but I used half low fat yogurt instead of milk which made it less rich as well.
