This dressing is fantastic - with one possible exception. As is, it's alot on the vinegary side. I added an extra teaspoon of the dijon mustard and everyone raved! Used it on mesculine mix for a wonderful salad.

I have to agree with Dadcooks. If you have a good quality balsamic vinegar, this vinaigrette is spectacular. (To make a cheap balsamic vinegar better tasting, reduce it to half in a non reactive metal pot over low heat. It takes time but worth it if you want that yummy taste).

Great and easy recipe.  I did cut the vinegar to 1/2 cup, added more garlic and some crushed red pepper flakes.  This will be a mainstay now in our house.

For those that complain of a too vinegary tast, it means you are using a poor quality balsamic--a good balsamic tastes good all by itself!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dressing!  He told me to make another batch because he was ready to take shots of it!  LOL!  I didn't have any fresh garlic on hand, so used garlic powder and it was still great.  Also added onion powder and a pinch of sugar.  Will add this to my recipe box.

I just got back from vacation and had a wonderful balsamic vinaigrette in Leavenworth, Washington. I came home wanting to find a recipe that was equally as good - and this was it!  Thanks for sharing.  It will be a standard in my home.

Very good, but a little too much vinegar. I added a little more olive oil and dijon along with a little sugar.

This was okay, I felt the mustard competed with the taste of the vinegar.  I admit to not being a huge fan of dijon mustard though.  I may try again without the mustard.

This was an okay dressing - it did seem a bit too vinegary, and there wasn't enough mustard or garlic flavor for our taste.  Thanks anyway!

Family enjoyed this light dressing. I added a teaspoon of brown sugar, put the ingredients in a small mason jar with a lid, and shook it to incorporate everything. This was my first time to use white balsamic vinegar, and it was good. This recipe also works quite well with red balsamic vinegar, too!

Great recipe!  I made it with half the balsamic vinegar the recipe called for as well and it tasted great.  

Sure beats my usual balsamic vinegar and olive oil dressing...lol...

I loved this. I left out the Dijon because I didn't have any, but this dressing turned out lovely even without it. I think it's largely because of the balsamic vinegar I have, but this vinaigrette is absolutely addictive.

I just finished making this and had to come and write a review (mainly before I forgot to!). My boyfriend and I love a good balsamic vinaigrette and this is going to be our new favorite. Just tasting it alone its fabulous so it will really be great tonight on our salads. I didn't have fresh garlic or dijon mustard so I used garlic powder and dried mustard and it came out so good. Thanks for sharing this one :)

This is a great sweet vinaigrette.   I used Balsamic Vinegar, of Modena and french s mustard (cuz that's what I had).  I'll make it next time with Dijon. But I don't think it will be too much different. Very yummy as a dressing or marinade.  Thanks SOSARA77's MOM!

This is the 3rd vinaigrette recipe I've tried. It's the best one by far. I added little extra Dijon for more "zip".

DadCooks is right .... the quality of the balsamic vinegar makes all the difference. I use a Mousto Balsamic imported from the island of Crete ... costs me an arm and a leg but the taste is unbelievably fantastic.  Instead of dried oregano and Dijon, used a combination of Italian herbs and my whole family and all my friends love this dressing.

Followed it to a "T" with the exception of adding a leftover garlic skin? you know the part that is left in the press?  We just left it to float in the vinegar.  My husband loved it and so did my picky 5 yr old.

Nice easy balsamic dressing recipe. I use a stronger mustard but that's just because my family loves mustard. A good choice on the gourmet side is Moutard de Meaux. Also a bit more salt. I've found that it's wise to reserve your BEST balsamic for your dressings, leaving the cheaper stuff for cooking. You really can taste the difference.

Delicious with tomatoes. I didn't add the mustard as I thought that it would overpower the balsamic and olive oil, so it gets 4 stars from me. This recipe really should specify AGED balsamic vinegar as cheap balsamics do not have the same mellow sweetness. A good balsamic does not need any honey or sugar added

Being on the hypoallergenic diet I needed to find a dressing that contained ingredients allowed.  This dressing is EXCELLENT!  I used an organic balsamic vinegar, greek style EVOO, and organic apple cider vinegar brown mustard.  I even washed out the glass bottle from a store bought dressing to take this dressing to work for the week.  Also used as the marinade for "Zesty Asparagus" recipe on this site.  THANKS!!!

Added a tablespoon of honey to even out the tartness of the good quality vinegar.  It is a personal taste thing.

I thought this was WONDERFUL!!  My kids and I scarfed it down!  But like most folks, I made a few changes: I used only 1/3 cup of balsamic vinegar (we don't like it too vinegary), a heaping tablespoon of dijon mustard, omitted the oregano, and upped the salt to 1 teaspoon.

This is it! This is the viaigrette I've been searching for. It's so much better than bottled dressing that you won't mind having to mix it up. Try it and you'll be amazed.

Delicious!!!  This is a wonderful dressing just as written.  We like things garlicy, so I did use 2 cloves.  I love to find recipes like this that don't have any added sugar or start with a packaged product.  I will be making this again and again.

Made this quickly to send with my husband's lunch for work. This vinaigrette is amazing! Delicious! My family just returned from a vacation @ the Pink Shell Resort on Ft.Myers Beach,Fl. We had a salad there that had a Balsamic Vinaigrette;that tasted much like this recipe. Now my honey can eat like he's still on vacation! Fantastic! Thanks for the recipe!!!!

I reduced the oil & vinegar to 1/2 cup each (to fit in my salad cruet) but left the remaining ingredients the same.  Refrigerated overnight and served with Beet & Balsamic Vinaigrette from this site.  Wonderful - we were practically licking our plates.  I used the best vinegar I could find - it was worth the price.

I too added the extra teaspoon of Dijon and that made all the difference between a good dressing and a great one! Tossed it with a mix of baby greens, crumbled Feta, dried cranberries, and sliced almonds - not a speck was left!

The dressing is delicious! I put everything in a food processor and streamed in the oil--it came together and even when it was stored in the fridge, stayed combined. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I used two  cloves instead of two. I simply mixed the ingrediants first and was dissapointed with the result.  My boyfriend suggested that I put it in a blender for 2 minutes.  It helped the oil and vinegar come together.

Thank you SOSARA77! This was perfect. We had it on our salad of mixed greens and it tasted so light and delicious. Only thing I did differently was add an extra clove of garlic as my hubby and I love it so much. So much better than store bought and so much healthier.

I've made this twice - once as written, and once with fresh herbs during the summer. It's SO MUCH better with fresh herbs! Try andding a handful of freshly chopped basil and parsley - you won't be disappointed!

Made it exactly as on recipe. Too tart so I added 1 packet stevia. Using olive oil I need to remember to bring it out of the fridge to make it liquid before using it. Next time I will add the extra Dijon in place of the stevia and try that

Love this dressing! Definitely tasted better after sitting in the fridge for a few days as the flavors blended nicely. I used it on a tricolor salad (arugula, endive, raddichio) and tossed with a little feta cheese. It was amazing! Will be one of my “go-to” dressings.

Good recipe, did exactly as directed but I did find it vinegary. The next day I used it again but added about an extra 1/4 cup of EVOO, and it was better balanced.

I didn't have enough balsamic, so I used 1/2 cup, & I didn't have the mustard, so I did change it out of necessity, but I still really like it!

Followed the instructions exactly.  The perfect viniagrette "base"--will try it with different vinegars, mustards, dash of this, dollop of that for varied tastes.

Very quick and easy. Tasted delicious . I prefer it with an extra tsp of Dijon mustard as suggested in another review. It helps tone the vinegar taste.

This recipe is good as is, but I thought it needed a little something extra. I added a little honey for sweetness and some minced onion for a bit of a bite. No more bottled dressing with preservatives, MSG or caramel coloring for my family!

Excellent balsamic vinaigrette and so easy to make too! This will be my go to dressing from now on. I am new to making my own dressings and felt very proud of how it turned out. Used it on a spinach salad with an Italian dinner, paired beautifully.  I wouldn't change a thing other than using a different type of Dijon mustard next time.

Not a fan. Not much flavor other than the Balsamic Vinegar. Will let it sit overnight to see if the flavors peak. If not, will try to add some other ingredients as to not be a total waste.

Made this exactly as described. I used a very good dark balsamic vingagrette from Modena. Would make it with slightly less oil next time, but that is just our tastes.  Will definitely use this from now on as a great lactose free salad dressing in our household!

I really liked this dressing, although I increased the oil a bit to get a 4:3 proportion of oil to vinegar.  My partner, however, found it to be still too acid.  He prefers closer to the classic proportions of 3 oil to 1 vinegar in his vinaigrettes. Just a difference in taste preferences.  I may have to make two different versions of dressings in the future, as we seem to find this difference in other dressings recipes I've tried, too.

Perfect!  I initially made a half batch but still used a full clove of garlic/crushed and that was a wee bit too garlicky (still good though ) I had gone out and purchased a little bit better balsamic vinegar and maybe that's why it is so yummy?? BTW. I used Colavita Organic-was about $5 so not terribly pricey, no caramel coloring just wine vinegar and concentrated grape must. I am now making a full batch-goes great on a salad with blue cheese, apples, Craisins, and walnuts. Thanks a lot for the recipe-my new favorite!

We make this often and it is wonderful.  We put in about 2 tsp of oregano and 2-3 cloves of garlic, especially if the cloves are not that big.  We always have it on hand and the recipe is easy enough for my 7 year old daughter to whip it up while I am finishing supper.

I made this for a special family dinner, it's really good, however i didn't have dijon mustard so I used an egg yolk to emulsify the oil and vinegar and then just some plain mustard it worked really well.

A good dressing, granted you don't put too much of it on your salad. The vinegar flavor was a bit too prominent to me, so I would recommend adding some more mustard and maybe some Italian spice/basil. Either way, it's a pretty good vinaigrette.

Okay, not fantastic.  Good flavor but nothing extraordinary.  Easy to make, so it will go on the shelf with the "need dressing fast" recipes, but it won't be a family favorite.

Great flavor and consistency. Exactly what I've been looking for! Only change is I used the fresh minced garlic I had in the fridge instead of crushed.

We thought this dressing was fabulous, but made a couple of minor tweaks. We felt the vinegar and mustard were competing with each other too much, so I toned it down with about 1Tbsp of honey. I also added a dash of onion powder. A good hard shake in the container and it was perfect!

This dressing is awesome because the oil and vinegar do not separate in the bottle.  It's delicious.  Tell Mama thanks for sharing!

I added about 1 tbsp. more evoo as it smooths it out slightly.The real taste test is to salt a small wedge of tomato and dip it in. In this regard,this recipe gets 5 stars...really tasty,especially if you have some strawberries and walnuts to round out this delicious recipe!  Thanks Sossara !

My family has a similar recipe to this but we add a tsp of sugar (or splenda) and a couple of Tbs of fresh lemon or lime juice. This is an excellent base vinaigrette which can then be built upon using whatever ingredients you choose, such as fruits, anchovies, olives, avocados, etc.. An invaluable recipe. The mustard is the key ingredient here as it is the emulsifier, which keeps the oil and vinegar from separating.

This didn't knock our socks off.  I think the strong vinegar flavor overpowered the other ingredients.  I'll play with this one though and tweak it to better suit my family's preferences.

Great flavor!  I originally went easy on the balsamic vinegar, per some of the suggestions but ended up adding more in as I was tasting it, so I say the original amounts are fine as is, as long as your balsamic vinegar is of a good quality.  I also added just a smidgen of sugar, to even out the tartness.  Am eating it in a salad, as I type this - yum!  I can't wait to use this on pasta.  My husband used this as a marinade for the Balsamic Chicken and Fresh Mozzarella recipe and said it tasted very good - not overpowering at all.

This is very good, albeit tangy on the vinegar side.  Next time I will use a better grade of balsamic vinegar.  Will make again.  Thanks.

I'm not a big fan of the balsamic taste but I do like this dressing.  I must have used a good quality vinegar because it wasn't as vinegary as I expected. I used it on the Avocado & Tomato Salad (this site) and wouldn't use it on that again, because it coloured the avocado and the salad didn't look too attractive.

I used this to marinate chicken for sandwiches. It was perfect, the chicken was tender and juicy and had a nice tangy taste. I'll be using this again.

I used this as a marinade for the Balsamic Chicken and Fresh Mozzarella on this site and I must say it was exceptional.  I didn't have dried oregano, so I used dried Italian seasoning.  Now I can't wait to try it with fresh herbs as another reviewer suggested.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

My family loves this dressing.  I make a salad with romaine lettuce, red onions, cucumbers and some feta cheese and croutons.
 It's not overly tangy. GREAT!

Simple and flavorful. It would probably overpower delicate greens, but with the assertive ones, especially arugula, it's wonderful.

This is great on salad greens.  However, my favorite thing to do with this is to use it as a dip for baby carrots instead! Yum!!!
