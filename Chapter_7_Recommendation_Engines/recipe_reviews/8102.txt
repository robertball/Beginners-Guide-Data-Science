Made this cake yesterday, and it is fabulous!  Husband ate 2 huge servings!  Only subs I made were toasted walnuts (heart healthy) instead of pecans and plain nonfat yogurt instead of fat and calorie laden sour cream.  Cake was very moist, flavorful, and simply delicious!  I will not feel guilty eating it with these healthy changes.

I used all the other recommendations from the other reviews and this cake came out perfect! I made it for a family get together and now it is requested for every one. 
I added slightly more sour cream;
little bit less baking time (40 min);
more filling and more layers of that filling;
swirl the filling with the batter at ea. layer;
almond extract in cake and glaze;
dust pan with cinnamon and sugar

This cake was delicious and very moist.  I made extra cinnamon and brown sugar topping and layered the top of bundt cake with it.  My husband ate almost the whole cake by himself.

This cake is sooo good. I made it just as the recipe said,except I put two layers of the cinnamon mixture.  It's moist,tasty,rich,and satisfying. It doesn't even need the iceing. But, I made some because my husband needed it.I have made this one many times in the past few months. One hint for a great cake is don't use an off brand cake mix. It makes a big difference.

I used to make this cake in the 70's also and my parents and siblings loved to eat it any time of the day.  It is very moist. You can be sure that I will be making it again for my family now that I have the recipe available.  Thanks.

I normally DO NOT comment/rate BUT I must say this cake is PERFECT!!!!  HOWEVER... I recommend baking it at 325.  I tried 375 and the outside was burned but the it was raw inside.  I tried again at 350 and again a little burned outside but much better than the first attempt.  My final attempt was at 325 and it was PERFECT!!!!   THANK YOU for the recipe.

I loooove sock it to me cakes, my mom made them all the time when I was growing up. I was excited to make this one from scratch although my mom was dubious. It looked beautiful and all the taste components were there, it just wasn't "right." It seemed very dry and heavy. I used a silicone bundt pan and it was close to overdone at 55 minutes. I am making another tomorrow for a baby shower and this time I am going to add slightly more sour cream, 3/4 cup of vegetable oil and one cup of pecans to make a wider band of filling.

My mom used to make this on very special occassions only...a real treat for us kids!  We loved it.  A while back, I asked my Mom to dig through her old recipe boxes in the attic to find it but it had long since dissappeared.  How happy I was to see the original recipe here!  One vestige of my childhood found!  THANK YOU!!!!

This was great & super moist-made a few variations based on other's reviews: baked @ 325 degrees for 50 minutes in a 9x13 pan. When blending the cake mix, I used 1/3 cup of butter instead of 1/2 vegetable oil & adding a tad more sour cream.  Sprinkled the bottom of the pan with a little of the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture-layered half the cake, brown sugar/cinnamon mix(no nuts, because I didn't have any), rest of the cake mixture and sprinkled the remaining brown sugar/cinnamon mix on top.  The glaze was not enough so I made a double batch.  This is soooo moist and excellent with coffee!  I will be making this again=thanks!

This cake was such a hit with the family, I made one to take to the company picnic; there were only crumbs left over to bring home!
Thanks for a great recipe!  I will definitely make this one again and again.

After my finance's aunt passed away, he continuously spoke on her sock it to me cake that she would make every thanksgiving and Christmas. I didn't have the slightest clue of what this cake looked or tasted like, but I wanted to cheer him up a little by making one. I tried this recipe and have been the designated sock it to me cake maker ever since. Him and the rest of my family loved it and he insist it's is better than his aunts. I highly recommended this recipe for first timers. Over time I made a couple of changes to fit my taste.

I thought this cake was dry and nothing to rave about.  The glaze just soaked into the cake and it was cooling over two hours.  I may try other recipes on this site.

I made this cake for my son who had been in the hospital.  They stick you with needles and Mommy makes you cake!  My family loved it.  I remember Sock It To Me Cake being lemon and I may try it with a lemon cake mix next time.  I will try it again.

I don't particularly like sock it to me cakes, but this was probably the best version of one I have had.  Watch the time carefully!  I baked a mini round cake and a 9x13.  I took the mini out at the perfect time and it was wonderfully moist.  I left the 9x13 in a little bit longer and it came out spongy.  I noticed that the cake mix package called for butter, not oil, so I may try that on the next attempt.

This is very much like a coffee cake.  I doubled the "streusel" mixture and layered it in 2 different layers.  I thought that it might be too much cinnamon but it was fine.  I used a coconut cake mix (its what I had).

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it was delicious. However, next time I will probably do two layers of the nuts mixture, as it sort of clumped into one spot.

This is from my childhood. I've been searching for the right one. Papaw didn't like sweets much at all. Normally, he wouldn't even taste it. He took a piece and exclaimed, "Dang (edited) that's good." Every since then we called it that. This is awesome!!!

I love this recipe.  I make monthly!  We eat it as a coffeecake for breakfast.  For a yummy twist, add a little almond extract to both cake and glaze.

I baked it in a tall Angel Food cake pan. Has anyone noticed almost all cake mix recipes call for 18.25 oz cake mix ??;; I could not find one. All the cake mixes were just 15 oz.
 Shame on you mix=makers! I solved that riddle by adding a small 3 oz pkg of instant vanilla pudding. The cake is great.I waited until it was cool and drizzled it with the powdered sugar,milk glaze. It turned out beautiful as pictured.

I left out the 1/4 cup of sugar and didn't miss it.  This was good but next time I will leave out the pecans and double the cinnamon and brown sugar.

This is the version of Sock it to Me Cake I've made a few times, but I use a yellow cake mix. Baked at 350 for 40 minutes and was perfect. I add a little vanilla to the glaze. Everyone loves it!

This cake was very moist but not very exciting at ALL. The icing seeped through & looked nothing like the picture. I was a little disappointed.

AH WOW AMAZING NOT TO SWEET JUST RIGHT AND I TOPPED IT WITH VANILLA GLAZE ICING. THE CAKE IS FABULOUS AND MORE FUL-FILLING WITH VANILLA ICE CREAM.
