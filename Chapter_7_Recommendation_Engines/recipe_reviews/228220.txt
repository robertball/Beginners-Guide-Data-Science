Very easy and a big hit with the family. I followed to recipe exactly and it came out great! Might try adding some garlic next time.

I use chives instead of onions and add chopped up bacon my family loves it. It's like a loaded bake potato but even better!

I cut the recipe in half but followed it exactly. It was perfect! Just the way I remember them from past family New Year's Day brunch. Thank you!

I have been making this recipe for over 30 years and it is always the first dish that is gone. The recipe was called TEXAS HASH BROWNS. I cut all of the butter out, ( and it is still creamy; the butter in the corn flakes are enough). my recipe calls for cream of chicken or cream of mushroom soup with about 1/4 cup of milk, and everyone prefers the cream of mushroom soup; even those who don't like mushrooms. I use all low fat cream cheese, Fit and Active soup (from Aldi's, skim milk; and by   cutting the butter out it becomes better  and healthier dish then that second helping OK.   Pat Navarre

It's a delicious recipe.  5 stars for taste, but I had to deduct two for the massive coronary disease factor per serving.

I make this a lot at the request of the kids and grandkids.  I use Cream of mushroom soup instead of the chicken or celery soups.  Sprinkle the top with butter and seasoned bread crumbs.  This
freezes well, so often double the recipe and freeze in small portions for just my husband and myself

Very good! I tried to make this once with my own shredded potatoes, and unless you bake this extra long, the potatoes don't get done. My advice use the frozen, shredded ones like the recipe states.

So easy and so yummy.  I made a few adjustments to the recipe. I just added garlic powder to it and instead of using the butter for inside the casserole, I mixed it with crushed pepper jack cheez-it crackers (instead of the cornflakes) and used it for the topping.  It was so delicious and added some kick to it too.

I've used this basic recipe for years.  I prefer the southern style hash browns instead of the shredded.  That way they don't turn out so mushy.  Also, you can adjust the time and temperature based on what other thing you are baking in the oven.  For example, I typically bake it at 350 degrees for about 1.25 to 1.5 hours.  I don't use the topping however.  Also, the recipe serves about 6-8 people for a side dish.  I also use sharp chedder which is wonderful.  I've also found that most packages of frozen hash browns aren't 2#.  I use the walmart brand which is 1# 10 oz and the proportions of cheese, etc are perfect.

Yes! Oh Yes! A bit of granulated garlic for garlic lovers is very nice with this. Not fresh. Not powdered! I actually drooled just reading the recipe!

I omit the onions and stir in canned French fried onions and omit the corn flakes and sprinkle more French fried onions on top when almost ready to take out of the oven. (about 5 minutes before removing from oven)

Great meal. I made this for my husband and I last night. I did not have any onions, I did not add the butter(better for you and less greasy), I used half of the sour cream, I used cheddar instead of colby, added a cup of milk, and no corn flakes - bread crumbs/crushed croutons and we loved it. He didn't even save any for lunch today it was so good. Next time I will make my own squared potatoes. Yum.

I do this almost identically - except we add meat for a dinner main casserole.  Country sausage, cooked and drained is the mainstay - but we've also used shredded rotisserie chicken and broccoli.  I usually also add a couple of eggs per hash brown package (we usually double this for when the kids are home on the weekends) and double the soups - it's a very very versatile recipe!

I make this recipe all the time, however, I found it too creamy and not enough cheesy, so I only use 8 ounces of sour cream and use 16 ounces of shredded sharp cheddar.

I've made this with Ritz Crackers on the top & cooked in the Microwave. Quick & easy in the summer heat! Microwave the butter & Onions for 2mins
Mix all other ingredients, except the crushed Ritz Crackers & microwave for 5 mins (High), stir add crushed Ritz and microwave for another 2 mins (HIGH) GREAT!

This is a wonderful dish. I have made these for years. The only thing I do differently is line the pan with strips of bacon. Whether I bake it in the oven or crock pot or a cast iron Dutch oven. They are wonderful in the crock pot too.

I've been making this for more than 20 years but would never consider it for breakfast. It's more of a side dish (especially if you add garlic, as some readers suggest!) I omit the onion and substitute French onion dip instead of sour cream to save some chopping and add flavor. You can also substitute cream of mushroom soup for the cream of chicken. It's been a favorite at pot lucks!

This was super yummy! Everyone loved it, I'll definitely make this again. Maybe I'll add some ham or crumbled bacon next time for an extra treat. The only thing I did different was cut down on the amount, I felt like 2 pounds of shredded potatoes was excessive. I was going to reduce it to half but that was still an entire 1 pound bag and an 8 ounce tub of sour cream! I'm not some health nut or anything, I totally believe in enjoying food as long as it's in moderation. I just felt like it was too much food for 4 people so I made 1/4 of it and it was just enough for a hearty serving for each of us.

I didn't have sour cream and so I substituted Ranch Dressing and my family LOVED it.  I also didn't have cornflakes so I substituted crushed Ritz crackers for the topping.  I think I'll try what someone else did though - pepper jack Cheez-It crackers.  Yum!

I have used a "similar" recipe for years, but portions of ingredients seem to be different. I use a one bag of hash browns (one pound as sold), let them thaw partially, add almost one pint of sour cream, stir and then add 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and 3/4 cup small chopped onion. Melt one half stick of butter (1/4 cup) and add to mixture and stir.  Then I add approximately 3 1/2 cups cheddar cheese and mix. Place the casserole in a 13X9 pan and sprinkle with approximately 1 cup of cheddar cheese and then crumble hand cooked potato chips on top.  Bake at 425 until golden brown.  Fabulous the first time around and just as good heated up as left overs.

A 16 oz container of sour cream is way too much. I made it twice using only 1/2 to 3/4 cup sour cream and it tasted a lot better. Also as written it was kind of bland I also added a very generous shake of seasoned salt.

I have been making this for years and is a perfect, easy side dish to go with BBQ.  I add diced green chiles to change it up a little.

This was very good and very simple to make. I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, I used way more corn flakes, and mixed the melted butter into them before I put them on top, I also used cheddar cheese because I didn't have colby. Turned out great!

Excellent. My wife loved it. I souped it up a bit and added chopped chicken thighs and sprinkled some grated old cheddar on top. We're thinking of adding some diced tomatoes in next time. The garlic add someone else mentioned sounds good too.It didn't brown like the other photos so I may cook it more than an hour next time.
Many thanks for the great recipes and helpful reviews.

I've been making this recipe for years and it is always a big hit.  Haven't found anyone yet who doesn't like it.  The only thing I do differently is to use sharp cheddar cheese instead of colby and I do not put any type of cornflake or topping on it.

I have'd use the French onion dip instead of the sour cream & it gives this a nice flavor.  I've also put crunched up French's french fried onions onto top of it, instead of the corn flakes.

This is an excellent recipe, one I have made numerous times and is always requested.  One to keep in the recipe file for sure. Can always reduce calories a little by using low fat or fat free ingredients.

This is an old family favorite. I like to freeze it in individual augratin dishes for those nights we have plain meat. Just thaw in the micro and pop in the oven. Thank you for reminding me of this great recipe.

I just use crushed potato chips for the topping rather than corn flakes and substitute cream of celery soup for cream of chicken for my vegetarian friends. I also like that flavour better. Always a favorite at pot lucks.

I use this recipe over and over. I usually make it in a nesco and it is great!! In the nesco, I usually leave off the corn flakes, but always add them when using the oven.  I seldom have leftovers

Mixed all the wet ingredients well. Mixed the cheese, potatoes and onions well. Then combined the two. Consistent and creamy. The corn flake crumbs are the best topping. I also sub in Greek yogurt for sour cream.

We really enjoy this recipe.  I don't put onion in it as my family does not like it in casseroles.  I also use only eight ounces of sour cream. It seemed too gooey with the full amount and too tart for my family's taste.  I almost never bother with toppings.  Here I don't because I put it in the crock pot for just a couple of hours on high. It comes out great.

This is NOT a copycat recipe from simply potatoes as one reviewer wrote.

I followed the recipe to the letter and it never really "set," so it was fairly fluid on the plate. That being said, it was a hit with the family, including fussiest of daughters, and every bite eaten. I may try reducing some of the wet ingredients next time around - I noticed the bags of hash browns are now 28 oz instead of 32. :/

These were delicious and easy to make. The one change I would make is to use cheddar cheese instead of Colby, which I’m not a huge fan of.

Love this recipe! I have made it for breakfast and as a side for dinner. I have also added bacon to it both within and on top. I have also made it without onions in the past and it was just fine.

Make sure the hash browns are thawed for a crispier center. Kids loved it (very picky on the bland side), one of the few things they ate for Thanksgiving. Feel free to add more spice for the adults.

As written with cream of chicken soup, we really didn't enjoy this much. (I made it again without the cream of chicken soup, but I added fat free half and half instead and it was so creamy and good. It did have to bake uncovered a while longer to soak up some liquid, but it was worth it.)

I made it for a brunch and everyone wanted the recipe.    Very easy and can be assembled ahead of time.  I did it the night before the brunch and it was really good

Very easy and super good! I did use dry hash browns instead of frozen because that's what I had on hand. I did rehydrate them first per the instructions. I used cheddar instead of colby, and I only baked it for 45 mins. My oven runs a bit hot. I also added garlic. I'm sure you could add all kinds of seasonings to this to change it up. I bet leftover ham or bacon would be good in it as well. This will definitely be one of my go to sides now.

Yummy! I used sharp cheddar, no cornflakes.  Also mixed everything together the day before and kept in fridge. Let it come to room temperature the next day before baking.  Worked great delish!??

I made this yesterday. I used an extra 2 oz of grated sharp cheddar with the Colby. I also used a sleeve of finely crushed ritz crackers on top instead of corn flakes. For some reason I can't upload my photo ( says it's too small ). The pan was emptied quickly. It was delicious. I've found my hash brown casserole recipe. It was the most talked about food on the table !!

Good reviews from those eating. However the onion wasn't completely soft so next time I would either cook longer or sauté before so there is no crunch from the onion.

Recipe was amazing! Added bacon pieces, omitted the butter all together, didn't do the topping, and only used half of the cheese and sour cream. Also used sour cream with chives instead of regular.

left out the butter and corn flakes, this recipe was still awesome! used cream of onion soup (cream of ANYTHING soup would be good) and added a little garlic sauce. left in the oven 10 minutes longer so the edges were brown and crunchy. very good, real comfort food!

Excellent side dish. I use the cubed frozen potatoes and used the philly shredded cheddar (the cheese mixed with Philadelphia cream cheese) . I always double the amount of the cheese. These potatoes freeze great, I measure out a dinner portion for 2 and put it in food saver bags and freeze the portions. Use extra corn flakes mixed with butter.

I have been making these for 20 years at least.  I use cream of celery soup and dried onion flakes.  Everyone loves these potatoes, especially the kids.  Wonderful.  In fact included them just this Sunday with ham on a nice picnic buffet.  My recipe was called "Picnic Potatoes".  I like to use the O'Brien potatoes for the color of the red & green peppers

These are yummy. The last time I made them, trying to lighten them up a little, I subbed out half the sour cream for lowfat yogurt, used light sour cream, and 98% fat-free soup.I also left out the melted butter, but I never add that anyway, doesn't seem to do much but add fat. Even with all the substitutions, they still tasted awesome!! Just make sure your hash browns are fully thawed and pretty dry. I usually thaw them in a colander. We also like to add onion to them sometimes, or top with french fried onions, just for a change. Good recipe!

This was amazing! Had some leftover keilbasa from off the grill, cut that into pieces and added it to the dish. Wow! It was so delicious! I went to a birthday party the next day where some cheesy potatoes were served and I kept thinking about how mine had been so much better! Can't wait to make it again :)

This was so easy and good. My husband and I both loved it. I added onion powder instead of the onions because my husband can't eat onions. It still gave it the onion taste and my husband never knew it. Added this to my All Recipes Box and it will be made often. Thanks Terra for the recipe.

This is great!! Easy to make, easy to clean up (VERY important), and yummy in the tummy :-)  I add garlic and garlic powder as well as diced smoked ham for extra flavor and protein.  Thanks for this recipe.  We make it at least once each month.

These are absolutely fabulous.  The family loves them and so do I.  I couldn't get Colby cheese so substituted mild cheddar.  I also used the hash brown patties, thawed and crumbled them.  It added a little crispiness to everything.  I could eat these everyday!

I love making this for meals, it's also a big hit at work potlucks... 
 The only difference is I crush up 1 pkg of Ritz crackers and 2 tbsp of butter, and sometimes I use plain yogurt instead of sour cream. my recipe come from Breakstone's classic cheesy potatoe also found on this site.....

This recipe is similar to Paula Deen's except her recipe calls for cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken and potato chips instead of corn flakes. I like the cream of chicken better. My family loves this as does my coworkers when it's potluck day.  I'm not a fan of the corn flakes.....but this is creamy and yummy. If you're a potato cheesy lover, you will love this.
