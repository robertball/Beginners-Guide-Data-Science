Delicious... The tomatoes with green chilies brand I use tends to be pretty spicy so I left out the red pepper flakes and it was prefect.  Non low carbers should make this and serve over rice or even a short pasta.. really easy too

I found this recipe after curiosity got the best of me. I thought, surely, there can't be a chicken stew, right!?! There is and I must say that It's really delicious. I have made it twice and I have found that this recipe can suffer if one does not use the freshest ingredients possible the flavor really awakens with fresh spices. The recipe is a keeper.

I make my own broth and so I added 3 1/2 cups rather than what was in the recipe also I didn't add the sofrito or red pepper flakes and it still came out delicious.

I made this a few times and I have found it exceptional ! Sometimes instead of  one medium size zucchini, I use two small ones and instead of sofrito, I use  Pace salsa, I may cut up a pepper or two tonight for a change since I don't eat celery ( personal taste ). I love making this dish !

Excellent! Made this as more of a soup than a stew.  Doubled everything except the cajun seasoning and red pepper flakes and broth.  Used 6 cups chicken broth.  Added one carrot.  Added corn kernels cut of two ears of corn.  Added 1/3 cup brown rice (uncooked). Used  a lot less cajun seasoning and red pepper flakes.  Added both to taste.  We like spicy food, but this would have been way to spicy with the amounts as written.

Very good.  A little spicy, so I think next time I will use the mild can of green chilis.
