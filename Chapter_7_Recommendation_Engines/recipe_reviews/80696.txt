I followed this recipe exactly, and to be honest I thought after baking these chops for a full 60 mins. they looked mighty dry.

Since I can't (for health reasons) eat pork, this review is courtesy of my husband who ate till he nearly popped.

The chops were flavorful and tender, so "2 thumbs up!"

I have to admit, this was one of the easiest chop recipes I ever prepared, so thumbs up from the cook, too!

The cola tenderizes the pork chops and the onion mix gives it flavor.  People can't believe it when you tell them you used soda in the recipe.  Great flavor and makes a good gravy with no hint of sweetness.

I love the simplicity of this recipe!  I was a little concerned while it was baking as I read others reviews that it smelled "weird".  It did have a weird smell while baking, not bad, just different.  It was very good though!  There was no left overs at my house!  I'll absolutely make this again.

Really good, my whole family loved it. The first time I did exactly, except taking the chops out early,mine were not real thick, so got done early. The second time I used the slow cooker, even better! I will say that cola will burn and taste bad, so the reviews who had bad results might have a too hot oven! I found that out using coke on the grill.......

Yummy and super simple!  Loved this recipe.  I did two things different, I sprinkled pork chops with some garlic powder and then continued with recipe, and I baked the chops at 300 degrees for
about 45 minutes.  Wonderful smell while baking, I did not get a "burning smell" when made.  Enjoyed by hubby and son.  Will make again!  Thanks!

My husband and his friends loved this recipe and it was so easy.  There is another similar recipe on here that calls for some ketchup which I didn't have but next time I would like to try adding it. (1/4 - 1/2 c)  I had five pork chops and it worked out great.  Thanks!

This was GREAT!! Very easy and good flavor! I seasoned my chops with Garlic Salt and Pepper before adding to cola mixture. I also used Beefy Onion dry soup. VERY good...hubby liked them too. This recipe is a must try!

Skeptical as I was, I tried this and not only was it incredibly simple but delicious. The chops were moist and tender. I served it with cajun sweet potatoes also on this website.

Definitely a keeper! My husband and son, who both know their way around a pork chop, proclaimed these to be the best ones they'd ever had. And it couldn't be any easier! Makes everyone happy. I followed the recipe exactly and had 8 pork chops. Yummy! Thanks for the recipe.

So unreal how good this tasted. I did add a dash of salt and pepper and I also paired it with rice which turned out very nicely. Cheap, simple and tasty.

It was okay.  I thought it tasted much too much like the onion soup mix.  But I should have figured.  Not bad, not great either.

It seems that no one else had this problem but I used Pepsi and the meat did have a sweetness to it which tasted a little weird paired with the French Onion.

I was attracted to this recipe because I cook my ham in coca cola and it's so good. I made the recipe exactly as given. The chops were lovely and moist but apart from that I didn't think this was anything other than so so. There was nothing wrong with the dish, it just didn't do anything for me and the sauce that it made was too sickly sweet for me.

This was pretty good. The chops were fork tender. Could use some garlic or pepper or something though.

This is so easy and soooo good. You don't need to do anything to it, the flavors are there with the cola and onion soup mix. Will use this over and over.

This is the second time I've tried a cola pork chop recipe, and this is the second time I just was not impressed.  I've made some pretty awesome recipes that call for the dry onion soup mix, but for some reason this did not rock my boat.  I think it might be more my taste than anything wrong with the recipe.  It was really simple, I've got to admit.   I served it with rice and broccoli. The flavor wasn't horrible, and the dish was certainly edible.  It just didn't pizazz my palate.

I don't know if it was the brand of onion soup mix I used or what, but this wasn't as great as I thought it'd be. It was the first thing I made that my guy didn't ask for seconds on... Maybe would try again with a different soup mix brand... We'll see...

I made one change to this recipe. I fast fried them in a skillet first with oil & butter,seasoning with a little garlic pepper. Then I did exactly what the recipe said,but the frying cut my time in half   I wanted my hubby to guess as to what I used but he had no idea,just they were juicy & succulent! He told me I could definitely cook them again.   I paired them with the 'scored potatoes',also from recipes.com & fried peapods w/ a dash of parmesan & seasoning.   Excellent recipe!

I tried this recipe tonight.  I followed the recipe but took someone's advice to sprinkle the chops with garlic powder first.  The aroma during cooking was good and I was looking forward to nice tender pork chops like everyone else seemed to get.  The flavour was great, but unfortunately mine were like boot leather.   Not sure if they were too thin or I cooked them too long.  Might try again.

This does make a really tender pork chop, but I have to agree with others that this pork needs some marinating and much more seasoning. Next time I will marinate in a dry rub and browning is also a good idea. It is also important to use thick chops as I lessened my cooking time because I had smaller chops and they still dried out a bit - however, I recommend to everyone to cover your chops for the first 1/2 of the cooking and that saved my chops from completely drying out. All in all a good idea of simple ingredients but needs a bit more seasoning.

These were OK.  A bit on the dry side.  I have other pork chop recipes I like better.  However, if you are making this recipe, I recommend 20 min on a side ont 30 per side.

Great recipe but it definitely need some tweaks. First I seasoned the meat with garlic powder and salt and pepper for taste very important to give that extra flavor. I used Pepsi cola and Golden onion Lipton soup mix with it. When turning the chops you should always baste so that meat doesn't dry out and the flavor is consistent, I flipped at least 4 times continuously basting. Uhm, uhm good!!!!!! sweet and juicy with some white rice cooked in beef broth.   I am licking my fingers as I m writing this review and eating every chop.

Followed directions, easy to make. Chops were tender and done. Wife liked it, I didn't. Sauce tasted okay but was too thin.  It all tasted okay served over  rice with chilled pear sauce on the side. Would rather have had Stove Top dressing & gravy with the chops. Not likely to make again.

I loved the ease and flavor.  My boyfriend didn't care for the onion soup mix taste.  Thinking of trying the mushroom soup mix next time.

This is such a great recipe! I actually took out the cooking liquid and thickened the sauce with some corn starch-served it over rice and my picky husband & son cleaned their plates!

This was a quick easy recipe,but I love pork chops and unfortunately with the onion soup mix they tasted more like beef than pork. The sauce never did thicken either. Oh well tried it once but won't use this recipe again.

Very good, I did use the beefy onion instead of just the onion!  It wasn't an OMG THIS IS GOOD but was very tasty, not dry, and very, very easy to make.  Even my 5, 3 and 1 year old picky girls liked it!

I thought with all that liquid the chops would be a little less dry. I don't know maybe I messed something up. The chops had real good flavor. Kinda surprised me

This is the best, simplest, easy clean up pork chop recipe I've found. Easy to clean up because there are none left to refrigerate! You'll be surprised at the tenderness, juiciness, and not near as sweet with the cola as you might expect. Just a mild sweet flavor that everyone loved so much that they all went back for seconds. My daughter doesn't normally MMMmmmmmmm... out loud at the table (she's 23) but this was so good, she didn't even realize she was doing it! I served this with roasted seasoned potatoes (cooked in oven with pork chops) and green beans! Big time saver! Thanks for adding this one!

I loved reading ALL of the reviews and seeing the different(minor)variations in this recipe.
Taking some of them in mind I thought I'd try these chops tonight using my favorite soda... Dr, Pepper! 
They were awesome! 
Like many others here, I too floured and lightly browned them first.
I know, I know, sounds terrible, right?
That's why I didn't tell my husband, the food critic, how I'd made them.
Good thing it's the taste and not the sound that matters.
He complimented me through out the whole meal, saying how wonderful tasting they were and how they were moist and tender enough to cut with a fork.
They were so good that he assumed I must have slaved over them. That's why he's in the kitchen right now doing dishes so that I could write this review! 
Now that's good stuff!

I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical about the cola, but I'll admit it...I was WRONG!!  I used 3 thick cut pork chops like the recipe stated, and they were so tender, they could literally be cut with the side of my fork!  The taste was incredible.  The only things I changed, was to add a can of sliced mushrooms, used beefy onion dry soup mix,and to cook everything in my crock-pot.  I cooked it on high for 2 hours, then low for 4 hours.  It also smelled really good while it was cooking.  My neighbor came in while it was cooking and commented on the wonderful aroma coming from my kitchen!  It was to incredibly easy to be so wonderfully tasty!  I'll be making this again and again,and again...

This is my favorite pork chop recipe! Last night I tried something a little different; I used Cherry Pepsi rather than regular, and I added some uncooked bacon pieces during the last 20 minutes. It added a subtle flavor that was just wonderful!

This was really great and super easy and fast.  For that fact alone, it should get a 5.  I forgot to flip the porkchops halfway through so I'm not sure if that would have made a difference.  But they were tasty, a little sweet, but I like that, and they were tender.  And you can't beat the ease of it all.  Serve it up with some veggies and you're good to go.

I tried these out tonight and they were all right.  They weren't the best, but they weren't the worst either.  I could still taste the sweetness of the cola that I put in, and the onion soup mix gave it a good flavor.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was very moist but also pretty bland. I was surprised because it smelled wonderful while it was cooking and I thought for sure the onion soup mix would give it more flavor than it had.

After cooking for 30 minutes, my chops were well done and cooked through.  Since it was the only thing we had for dinner, I did tweak it by searing the chops in a separate pan, and reducing the sauce over the stove.  I then returned to the baking dish for a few more minutes just to carmelize.  It was just ok.  It would be better if they were cooked in the slow cooker with pork shoulder for pulled pork.  I'll make like that next time

I made this last night for my family, there are 5 of us so I doubled everything. I really liked the flavor of the gravy, it was kind of sweat, though I did have to thicken it with corn starch and water. The meat was not as tender as I had hoped, so next time I am going to slow cook it like some others have suggested. I will be making this again very soon.

The first time I tried this recipe, I cooked the chops in the oven as the recipe said to.  The chops turned out drier than I liked.  The second time I tried cooking in my crockpot.  Much, much better that way.

My 5yo thought they were really good, and so did my picky husband. They were easy,I did bake at 300(seasoned my chops with garlic powder and pepper)and they smelled great while cooking. Will make again.

I really liked these! I topped them with caramelized onions (caramelized onion on the grill recipe) which contrasted the sweetness with a bit of salt.

I was a bit apprehensive about making these pork chops, but wanted to make something different that was quick and easy.  I waited until my husband went out to run an errand before I started preparing this dish, thinking if he saw what the ingredients were, he would never eat them!  Boy, were we both surprised!!  These were the most tender, moist and flavorful pork chops we had ever eaten!  I now make these at least twice a week.  My loal grocery store had inexpensive pork steaks that had been pre-seasoned with alot of paprika and black pepper, so I bought them instead of the chops.  I mixed the onion soup mix with a cheap, off brand cola (not diet),and poured some of that mixture in the bottom of the 9 x 13 pan sprinkled the chops with garlic powder and put them in the pan, and then added the remaining soup/cola mixture. I then topped with extra onion, sliced very thin.  I covered with foil and baked in a 300 degreee oven for about 1 hour and 30 minutes.  Perfection!!  Excellent, simple recipe.  I think next time, I will add fresh, thinly sliced mushrooms - Yum!!!!

This was OK but not great. Pork was a bit dry. The sauce was good - kind of like french onion soup. It was really really simple to make - would make again, but not on my list of "regulars"

I was really excited for this recipe because I love simple things like this that can be made from things I always have in the house.  However, it was pretty unappealing when it came out of the oven, and it just didn't smell appetizing.  The pork was very moist, but the sauce wasn't thick at all.  I always make 3 small pork chops for my husband and I for dinner and I knew this wasn't very good when my hubby didn't go back for his second pork chop and asked for more salad ;)  I wouldn't say that this was bad, but I won't be making it again.  There is a similar pork chop recipe on allrecipes.com made with cola, brown sugar, and ketchup that is outstanding that I will be sticking with.

Fast, easy: The fam and I all LOVE this recipe!! I added freshly minced onions (just enough to lend flavor body)--and WOW!! I had restaurant quality chops!

I found this recipe model works with chicken, too--and I'm even thinking of trying it with steak as a possible marinade.

This recipe was awesome! I love being creative with ingredients. I tend to lack in that department, I'm too scared to try seasonings out on my own. The soda was a great addition. I will defintely make this again.

Although the pork chops were tender, they were extremely bland. What flavor they did have was overpoweringly sweet from the onion and cola mixture, a very odd flavor. Maybe preseasoning the chops would have helped. I appreciated how easy it was to prepare this recipe, but I wouldn't make it again.

We thought this was just OK.  The sauce didn't seem to thicken up at all, and I only used 1/2 can of soda...maybe it was the diet soda that was the problem, but that is what we had.  I don't think I'd make this again, even though it was easy.

This was really good. My 2 year old who never eats her meat couldn't get enough. I did take others advice and I seasoned the pork steaks (all we had) with garlic salt and pepper before I poured the soda and onion mix on top. I also used a Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper since it was all we had in the house!! I was worried that it was going to ruin it, but it was great. And it smelled good baking!! We will definitely use this recipe again!! Thanks for sharing it with us...

Very good chops, did make a few changes after reading reviews.  Added chopped onions and minced garlic, sprinkled with a little pepper and salt to taste. I also added can of beef broth for flavor and covered with foil baked at 300.  They were very good and tender my husband and 4 year old boy thought they were very awesome.

We thought it was pretty good!  I read the reviews that said it didn't have much flavor or tasted odd, so I put some sliced onion under the chops, added the cola, then sprinkled the onion soup mix on top.  I covered it with foil for the first half (I only did 20 minutes), then  flipped them over and removed the foil for the last 15 minutes.  An hour would have been too long for my chops.  They were very tastey and not dry at all.  I'll probably make it again.

I agree with another reviewer who said that this was not great but not bad either.  I just thought it was a little bland.  The onion soup was a good idea but the cola did nothing that I could tell.  I served with a Garlic and Herb Rice Pilaf.

It was FANTASTIC. I didn't get a photo before so there will not be  any... none left

Good and tender. Didn't have thick cut so I cut the cook time. Flipped them half way through. Didn't use but half the mix and maybe about 10oz of cola.

The worst recipe I have ever tried. I knew the meat would be tough cooking it that long.  I used premium thick cut center chops.  Sorry for the review, I never comment on bad recipes, but this one deserves a bad review.

I am an experienced cook. I made this recipe exactly as presented and I would describe it as odd. Smells odd, tastes odd. After tasting it, I kept the pork chops and threw out the gravy. I don't recommend this recipe.

Made 6 boneless pork chops, seasoning then with garlic and onion powder and black pepper first, then searing in a pan before baking. Didn't end up taking like soda at all, which was cool. Almost like a different type of bbq sauce. thickened towards the end with a little slurry (cornstarch and water). Didn't get as tender as people advertise but maybe that's bc I didn't get super thick pork chops? I don't know. they weren't very juicy. and I seared them first in order to lock in the juices like I do with regular smothered pork chops but it didn't work for some reason with this recipe. Worth a shot if you're looking to try something new, but definitely not something I'll be making often.

60 min at 350 degrees for pork is really borderline.  I always disreguard the time indicated and cook with a temp probe.  For pork when it reaches 138 degrees internal I pull them out, cover and rest for 5 min. It will generally rise to 142 degrees, which is perfect.  Same with chicken when it reaches 158 degrees.  The Coca-Cola recipe is very good.  I used 1/2 envelope of soup mix and laid the chops on top of thinly sliced sweet Vidalia onions.  I will make this often.

I've made this TWICE in the last week and a half, my family loves it, it's super easy to modify for larger families like mine and is very inexpensive to make as well!  This is a weekly thing for my family now, so glad to have something new in the rotation!

I just made this tonight, and chowin' down right now! I like this a lot. The only thing I did differently, in addition to following the recipe exactly, was to thicken the sauce, after cooking the chops, by pouring the sauce into a small saucepan and thicken with a cornstarch/water slurry. I will definitely make this again. For those of you who are learning to cook, this recipe is so easy, and that's an understatement! I wish I had known about it! Thank you, KATHERINEMICHELE  for sharing!

First, don't use thin pork chops with this recipe; it throws the cooking time off.  Our meat was tender, but not fork-tender.  After baking, the liquid was thin, so I made a quick roux  out of butter and flour and slowly streamed the meat liquid in to make a gravy.  Make no mistake-- these are sweet, and that's probably why my kids loved them.  Next time I will use the thick pork chop and probably saute some onion ringlets to serve on top for a more adult palate.  Very nice with rice and recipe has great potential to be a go-to.

I adjusted because I knew 30 minutes per side was too long. I can't describe it but flavor was off. Not too strong onion but not tasty. Will not make again.

I've tried this using Black Cherry  soda,  Mango soda, and Orange soda. Each time I've used this recipe it turns out great. Tender, Juicy, & Tasty! Tonight I'm making it with Rootbeer soda. Love it!

I've been cooking for myself for quite some time and whenever I find an "easy" recipe I try it....actually cooked this twice because I thought it didn't turn out for the first time.  I spent good money on some beautiful boneless chops and followed he instructions to the letter.  The chops were so dry they were almost inedible.  The gravy did not thicken, at all.  Same thing happened the second time.  Are you sure it's not 15 minutes of baking on each side?

I understand how this would sound appealing and be a novel way to prepare pork chops but, for us, it was a relatively bland dish. It was easy to prepare and the onion soup mix gave it a little bit of character but otherwise it wasn't as satisfying as it sounded.

This was just 'ok'.  Won't make it again; there are too many other recipes to try.  The pork was done fine, but the 'sauce' was way too thin to amount to anything.  The finished product looks nothing the featured picture.  I even tried broiling it the last 10 minutes to give the pork some color.

Followed recipe just as provided - the only exception was the juice didn't thicken so I seasoned it and thickened with a little corn starch.  This was very good and the chops were tender and juicy.  I will try the cola and onion mix on chicken - I think that will be yummy!  Thank you!

Pork chops were not tender unfortunately. Flavor could use a punch up. If I were to make them again I would try the slow cooker.

I've made this several times. Tweaked the timing & temps. I use a glass dish so I only baked for 40 min. @ 350. Plus, my chops were a butterfly cut.  Served with multi grain wild rice & green beans. Awesome flavor combination!! ?

Very easy to do, but a little bland and not as tender as I was hoping. I may cook it longer if I try it again. The sauce also never thickened.

This is not a bad recipe. I give it 3 stars because I thought it would not taste a tid bid sweet,but above all the amount of cola that the recipe calls for is a bit too much so the gravy is soupy instead of thick. It made me question some review that asserted the chops were dry. On the good side, the chops are juicy,tender, and not dry at all. As someone suggested, I served it with the Really Simple Rice recipe from this website. It was actually very good combo. Unfortunately, the sauce or gravy was not thick enough it was soupy instead so I would try it next time with half a can of soda and hopefully it will be perfect without any small hint of sweet which I do not like on anything that is not a sweet. I will try it again. It is worth it as nothing like eating a juicy moist pork chop. By the way, with the whole can I had enough for cooking 4 chops!

I followed the recipe exactly and we both didn't like it. It was sweet and I was hoping for a thicker "sauce."  My husband said it was bland. We ended up using our sriracha sauce. We used the name brand onion mix as well. We will definitely not make this again. I am so glad I didn't say this recipe in my box.

My family loved this recipe and it was so easy my 6 year old actually prepared it.  I did however make a few adjustments: I used diet coke instead of regular coke (this cut down on the sweetness); I also added accent and garlic powder to both sides of the pork chops.  I did use thin cuts of the pork chops so I cut down on the cooking time.  They were moist, tender and delicious.  I paired the meal with roasted veggies (butternut squash, cauliflower, carrots and asparagus with roasted pecans).  Yum......  Will definitely prepare these again.

Cooked 2 large chops in crockpot with fresh mushrooms 2 hrs on high, 4 hrs on low. Fork tender, but too salty for me.  Next time I'll skip the onion soup and use fresh onions. 
Definitely will make again, the coke really did a good job of tenderizing.

I used Diet Pepsi and a store brand onion soup mix.  I also cooked it in the crock pot (High, 3 1/2 hours). Very good.  Even my husband, who isn't much of a meat eater, complimented me on these chops. And it was so easy to make.  Will definitely make again.

Very easy to prepare. My daughter loved this and my husband thought it was "okay". I did not tell them what was in it and tried to see if they could guess. my husband especially is not so keen on trying new things. Yet, I make him a guinea pig more often than he knows. I thought it was pretty good, flavorful. Mine did come out a bit dry, the pork chops were thick and the liquid did not cover them. I figure that could account for the dryness

ok, not sure how i messed this up but open to suggestions.  used RC cola and followed recipe exactly.  Made a great gravy but the chops came out tough.  cooked for an hour at 350 and turned accordingly, maybe RC doesn't have enough sugar?  If chops had been tender this would be a keeper

These were good, but not amazing or anything you would whip out for company.  You don't taste the Cola at all.  I seasoned with garlic powder and pepper.  But I think the onion soup mix is too overpowering with this recipe.  Next time I will use half an envelope of dry onion soup mix and see what happens.

For a basic, fast and easy recipe this is awesome.  We love spice in our house so I added some crushed red pepper flakes and they were great!  I did not have "COLA" on hand and know that any soda works for tenderizing meat.  I used ORANGE SODA!!!!  Still came out great!    Good luck and thank you katherinemichele!

These pork chops are really, really good. They were easy to make. Both my husband and my children want me to make them again. I did rub garlic powder on the chops before pouring the cola mixture on. We like garlic on most things!

MY HUSBAND AND I TRIED THIS RECEIPE AND IT WAS GOOD AND JUICY.  WE DID NOT MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENT IT WAS JUST GREAT THE WAY THE RECEIPE IS.  IT SIMPLE QUICK AND TASTEFUL.  THE PORK CHOP TASTE LIKE GLAZED HAM WHICH ONLY TAKE ABOUT 30 MINUTES.  THIS IS A 30 MINUTES MEAL.  WHILE THE CHOPS WAS BAKING I WAS PREPARING THE OTHER SIDE DISHES.

I thought this is just too easy to be good, but I tried it any way. I did make a little change in the recipe though after reading some of the reviews. I mixed the cola, onion soup mix in a bowl; add some garlic powder, cracked black pepper with a couple dashes of jalapeno sauce. The chops came out nice, tender and juicy. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the “gravy” is not gravy it is juice. I will make again, but with a thicken agent in mind to make real gravy. Easy and my wife and two very picky teenagers liked it so it was a hit!    Thanks

I made this the other night for my boyfriend, as usual. I don't eat pork but he was really impressed and couldn't figure out exactly what the 'sauce' was. He said it was awesome. Very little effort. It's going into the rotation.

Got home late and didn't want to mess with flouring and doing the browning from other recipes so did this one with the garlic salt and pepper. I even forgot when I put them in the oven cuz I was on the phone, but checked them turned 'em over and at bout one hour total took em out. Even tho it was almost time for bed I kept snacking on these tender morsels, can't wait for lunch tomorrow.

This wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. My husband didn't like it. I thought it was pretty good. The only change I made is I cooked them 20 minutes each side instead of 30. Might make this again.

I really wanted to love this recipe but oh my goodness it did not turn out well for me. The pork chops were very tender which was great but they just tasted too sweet. The absolute worst part was the "gravy". It never thickened up at all for me. I thickened it a bit myself and when I tasted it wow was it sweet. I knew instantly that nobody was going to be able to eat that over potatoes. I tried to doctor it up but it ended up a waste. It was just too sweet to be a gravy would eat with potatoes.

Was extremely happy with this very simple recipe.. I had Knorrs vegetable mis on hand so I just poured the cola on the chops and sprinkled veg. mix  quick stir and put it in the oven. When it was done let it rest for 15 minutes and the sauce thickened was so quick and easy !

Ok I guess I gotta be the first one to say something bad about this recipe. I thought it smelled weird cooking and tasted weird too. The smell stayed in the house ubtil the next day. It was ok but I would not have this again.

These were good for the first few bites, and then the onion soup flavor just completely took over.  If i were to make these again i would only use half the amount of onion soup mix.

My kids and husband liked this, but I was strongly distracted by the overwhelming onion presence even tho I'm the only one that even really likes onions in our family.  I might make it again, though, considering the ease of prep, and the fact that I was outnumbered.

This is an easy, decent tasting recipe, but nothing to write home about.  Maybe it is my diminished sense of smell from allergies, but I thought the flavor wasn't strong enough.  This is despite the fact I even added half of another soup packet because I had four pork chops. DH was enthusiastic about it, so I may play with suggestions from other reviews.

While I was cooking this, my boyfriend walked in and said, "something smells weird."  They tasted just as "weird" as they smelled.  Definitely would not make this again.

Very tender - added some garlic powder and some beef broth after seeing some reviews.  My 2 toddlers ate it with no fuss. It was easy quick and if my girls will eat it - I'm making it again!  I felt it was good tasting but not exciting and the sauce came out very thin.   Next time I may flour and seer the meat before putting in oven and reduce oven time and maybe some fresh garlic.
