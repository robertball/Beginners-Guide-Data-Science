Delicious and pretty easy.  Not sure if I did something wrong as the topping turned out more like a paste than something you could sprinkle.  I added more flour and dropped small lumps of topping and it turned out good anyway.

5.30.18  When I was folding in the strawberries, I kept thinking too many, too many, but I was wrong.  What you get with your first bite is a burst of fresh strawberry flavor.  It’s moist, tender, has a tasty, soft crumble on the top, and is rich.  Baked in a 9" springform pan.  It’s the same recipe as has been on another site since 2006, except this one calls for cake flour, the instructions are written just a bit differently, and “Summer” has been added to the name.  That’s OK because it was hit for the other site, and it’ll be a hit for Allrecipes.
