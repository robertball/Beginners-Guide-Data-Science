I noticed that there are complaints about these being tasteless. I used 1 tsp. of salt and omitted one cup of the breadcrumbs and the olive oil called for with the potatoes. I also used Yukon gold potatoes, leaving the skins on. Otherwise I made the recipe as is. The flavor and texture was great! I used a large icecream scoop to measure with. Potato pancakes tend to fall apart right at first if you don't use eggs, so I just press them down and scoot the stray pieces into place. I cover the skillet for the first four minutes. The steam helps the potatoes cook and hold together when you go to flip the patties over. I will make them again!

I made this recipe tonight. I was easy and SO good. I did make some additions. First, I made the recipe without omitting anything. Then I added 2 eggs & 1/3 C. Sour cream. They were exactly like the restaurant here the Old European. Mmmm! Hubby loved them. Kids did too.

I love these, they are my family's favourite breakfast. I decided to bake them this time on a cookie sheet with one of those plastic non-stick things on the cookie sheet so there's no sticking. I spread the potato mix over it without any spaces and made it flat. Then baked it at 350 for 40 mins. You lose some of the fried flavour, but it seems healthier to me. I used a pizza cutter to split them into wafer sized pieces. This way if much less work than frying and actually takes about the same amount of time because you can only fry about 2 or 3 at a time and each of those takes about 5-6 mins and smokes up the room pretty good. I will probably still bake and fry depending on what I want. I have never added the bread crumbs and use some eggs in it. The recipe is very versatile and you can mix up the amount of ingredients all over the place and it will still taste great.

Yum Yum. I used red potatoes with the skin left on and omitted the lemon juice and flour. I will definately make these again.

This was a fine recipe, Authentic is not the right words though.  There would be no fresh dill at the particular season these tasty taters were most frequently enjoyed which is winter not spring and summer as much.  not to mention the oils and such but it was alright.  Dill's flavour can hardly hold up because it is not a hardy herb meant for the extended high heats for frying.  use herbs from a woody stalk if you want more flavour.  Oregano, marzipan, etc.  I prefer to salt my potato cakes after frying but that's just me.  anways that's all for now sorry if this offends anyone.

The recipe was easy to follow however it took forever to grate all those potatos!  The mixture didn't tend to stick together very well so had to add more flour.  They fried up nicely as long as the patties weren't too thick.  Flavour was okay.  Very watery mixture at bottom of bowl so ended up throwing out approx. one potato's worth.  Probably would make these again.

These were very good.  Didn't have as much flavor as I would have liked, but still tasty.  I will definately make again with more spices next time.  Thanks for the post.

These were absolutely great! We added a sweet potato to add more color and a more interesting flavor. They weren't as oily as other recipes, which made them really nice. Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was a really good recipe.  I found that it didn't stick together very well, but that might have been because I used baby potatoes and had to guess at all the amounts.  I also forgot the flour!  :P  Next time I make these, I'm going to add less onion, and I might mash the potatoes before I mix in other stuff.  Overall, they were excellent!  Very tangy, didn't taste like bland potatoes, which are good only up to a point.  Very filling and I will recommend this recipe.

I've made these twice already! My husband and son love them, I like them too. My husband had to share some with people at work and they liked them too. This is a great recipe to make for a large group of people because this recipe makes a lot. We had some left over for a day or two. I had to send some over to the in-laws. lol

I used this recipe with my cooking group of junior high students.  For the authentic version make a apple compote sauce to serve with.

Fantastic. I followed the recipe and then added a teaspoon of monosodium glutamate to address the flavour issues. Quite a bit of work (potato grating) but worth the effort if you have the time. :) Grandma sure knew what she was doing!

I used frozen carrots & onions as well as jarred garlic. Instead of fresh parsley & dill, I used dried. I had to put a bit more dry bread crumbs into the mix. I served this with a Hispanic inspired ham recipe along with Mexican rice mix from Rice a Roni.

These were just awful!  They had no flavour, the bread crumbs made them taste very pasty, and no one here would eat a second one.  Too many things I would change to list them here.  I would keep looking.

These were really good, although the lemon juice was really overwhelming after the first few bites (but maybe I added too much?). I also had to throw in an egg to get everything to stick together. I don't know if I'll make them again.

The taste was ok,  a little bland.  However,  the texture was really terrible,  maybe how I would imagine fried playdough. In fairness,  I have never had potato pancakes before,  so perhaps this is the normal texture?  Either way,  it didn't go over too well with the fam.

I've made this recipe several times now and haven't changed a thing. I think it's a fantastic recipe; my family loves it and i've recommended it to others. I usually double the recipe to freeze some for later. They reheat really well in a lightly oiled pan. I do press the extra water out after shredding the potatoes and it helps tremendously with the excess water problem that another reviewer  complained of.

Delicious!  I added some veggies I had in the refrigerator, thus, I believe made my dish a bit “wet”. Did not set... (my bad). Will make this again, and if I add veggies I am going to add a little flour.  Thanks for sharing!

I'm not an expert cook - hence why I am looking for the recipes.  I had a lot of trouble with this recipe.  One, the scale is HUGE - 10 potatoes would be enough for a group of 20 people.  Also, there was no way these would be cooked on medium heat in 4 minutes, unless there was standing oil in the skillet.  I used 1/4 cup oil, but my skillet is large, so there was just a coating on the bottom.  After changing and adjusting many things, I made them work, but this recipe is sorely lacking in information and steps.

Mine kind of fell apart, so I probably did something wrong. Hubby had been craving Potato Pancakes -- so I decided to try this recipe. It needs some tweeking, but I will try making these again.

This was so good!  I used more flour than specified and instead of bread crumbs used herb stuffing which I ground up smaller. We served this with applesauce on the side like traditional German Potato Pancakes. I also use smart balance vegetable oil instead of olive oil because it has a tendency to hold together better than olive oil.
