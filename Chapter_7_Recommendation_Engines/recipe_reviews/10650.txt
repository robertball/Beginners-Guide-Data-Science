I just tried making these cookies before giving them away in jars and they came out tasting great.  They do come out better though when the balls are compact, so putting them in the refridge. before is helpfull other wise they fall apart when taking them off cookie sheet.

These cookies are delicious once baked!  The wide mouth quart jar is spot on, packing the ingredients as you go was a good tip.  There was a small amount of space left at the top which I would stuff with parchment or wax paper so the ingredients don't shift.  I think these would make great gifts and are a pretty quick mix to whip up.  I used a sheet of parchment paper as a funnel to fill the jar.  I used real butter in these.  I weighed the dough out to 1.5oz per ball and got 17 cookies.  My cookies did spread thin on the baking sheet even though I chilled the dough in the freezer for 15 minutes on the first batch and 30 minutes on the second batch.  Next time I might try a longer chill time to see if that would help.  I would recommend several inches between each cookie when baking if you don't want them all ran together.  These are a super buttery crisp cookie!  I would make these again and would not hesitate to gift!
