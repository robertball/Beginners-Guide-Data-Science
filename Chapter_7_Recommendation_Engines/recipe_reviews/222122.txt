I cut this recipe back by half as I only had half of a can of pumpkin to use. It's not really the season for pumpkin seeds, I used 1/3 cup chopped pecans instead. I made no other changes. I made muffins out of this recipe instead of one big loaf, I did get exactly 12. Baking them at 350*, they were done at exactly 20 minutes. These were VERY moist and the perfect muffin-texture, I think the only thing I was missing was more spice. I will make these again but double the cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger.

I really liked this recipe. I only had freshly  cooked pumpkin, sour cream, sour milk, and  apple sauce to sub, which made it come out more like pie which I liked, but I will make it the way it's presented next time, as I think both will be grrreat, thanks!

A definite 5-star recipe. Instead of buttermilk I used almond milk mixed with 1.5 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar. As I was out of raisins, I used dried cherries (currents or dried cranberries also sound like a delicious possibility). I do not like nuts or seeds in breads so I left those out. Because I did not have mini loaf pans and I wanted to bake this "like..now!" I had to use two regular-sized loaf pans. Novice bakers should know that they will need to drastically increase the baking time if they do this. 

Next time I am going to use fresh ginger instead of dried for that extra zip that it provides breads and muffins. 

I will be making this recipe, with the changes I mentioned, for Thanksgiving presents for all of my family. -Chaya

Used craisins in place of raisins and chopped pecans in place of pumpkin seeds.
1/2 of a recipe makes 4 mini loaves and cooks for 35mins.

Great recipe, my friends loved it! The bread has a very delicate taste.
I halved the recipe, and filled one loaf tin. I omitted the pumpkin seeds and cut the raisins in half.
We ate it with butter. Would definitely make again.

I have made this recipe two times now ( I forgot I had made it once already).  The taste is ok, but I think the bread comes out with no complexity at all-complete Wonder Bread texture.  I left out the raisins and pumpkin seeds so maybe I need to add something interesting next time, but it is absolute mush.  Just not a fan.  Maybe I am doing something wrong-I added molasses, as I always do to my pumpkin bread, or maybe it is where I live-high altitude cooking.  I need to keep looking for that perfect recipe.....

Yummy! Decided to cut the recipe in half and used my 9x5 loaf pan. Omitted the raisins and pumpkin seeds, also replaced half of the brown sugar with white because I ran out. I'm giving this recipe five stars because it's a great healthier alternative just like the recipe states, although I prefer it a tad sweeter. This bread was delish, very moist and full of flavor! It's a keeper. :-)

This recipe turned out great. I added dark chocolate and subbed cranberries and walnuts for the raisins and pecans. Next time, however, I will be increasing the sugar to 2 cups next time as I found they were almost savoury instead of slightly sweet.

I made muffins instead of bread for portion control. They turned out great. I did change the recipe just a little. I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup coconut flour in place of the 2 cups of white whole wheat flour. I also added a cup of dark cacao chips. Not very sweet and that is just what i wanted.

Excellent!  Tasty and moist and my kids say even better than the original version. I didn't have buttermilk (mixed 1 T lemon juice into 1 cup milk) and used all white flour and omitted pumpkin seeds and raisins.

For being healthy it sure has a lot of sugar. It turned out great. Used yogurt like another commenter suggested.

I added chocolate chips and an extra tsp of cinnamon, but they still came out a bit bland. The texture is light, and it's healthier, but not something I would make again.

OUTSTANDING.  Minor changes this time - used regular stick margarine and left out the salt, used non-fat plain yogurt for the buttermilk and didn't use the pumpkin seeds.  Next time plan to try to use substitutes for the eggs and cut down on the sugar.
