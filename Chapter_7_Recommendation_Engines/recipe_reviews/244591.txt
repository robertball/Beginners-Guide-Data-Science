First off, I will say that I really went into this not thinking I was going to like this clam dish at all due to the addition of fennel. I am not a fan of anything licorice flavor, but boy did this taste really good! I wish I made more broth to soak up with my french bread! This was a big hit with my friends. It did turn out a bit salty, but we have a very high tolerance for salt, so this was just right! Would absolutely make this again and again!

I'm not a particularly great cook (meaning I'm scared to death to veer off the recipe).  This was super easy and tasted as good as steamed clams at any restaurant (although I didn't use the fennel because I forgot it).  There was plenty of broth for dipping the garlic bread that we made to go with it.  Going back to Costco for more clams today!

We love steamer clams. This recipe is a variation on a theme I've made so many times, I can't count. Using Swanson Seafood Stock really adds additional flavor and freshness. This is a seafood dish and it tastes like it. I will be making this version again and I will absolutely be using Swanson's Seafood Stock. I will also use it in other seafood dishes I make too, like Bouillabaisse.
