While I liked that this wasn't dripping in dressing, it did seem a tad dry after it sat; I found myself savoring the tomato bites for a burst of juiciness.  I chose to leave out the olives per personal preference and I used dried basil in lieu of fresh.  This was a nice change of pace from the typical Italian dressing or mayo based pasta salad, for sure.  THANKS for the recipe, QUIKSANDY!

Excellent!  We made our own version without olives because I hate olives.  It was really good!!!  Will definitely keep this in the rotation.

This recipe is very good. I added a bell pepper (any color) and also added sliced pepperoni. I doubled the dressing and added it as needed.  I will check before serving if more dressing is needed.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was great! I did , however, then add a few more tablespoons of the balsamic vinegar just to add more taste to our liking. Will definitely make again!

I made it as per the recipe.  It was tasteless so I added "salad supreme". I also added another tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and a 1/4C of Italian dressing.

A tasty pasta salad that has no mayonnaise and little oil with all the ingredients this salad has going on.  I did make without the olives, due to personal taste preferences. We found the salad to be better on the second day as the flavors had time to marry.  I added the feta cheese right before serving, so it would stay in nice crumbles.  Thanks QUIKSANDY for sharing your recipe.  This will make a nice summer salad.

I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 only because I could not make it exactly as written. One of my family members is allergic to gluten, dairy and raw garlic. I used Penne corn pasta from Trader Joes (great pasta even if you love gluten), served the feta on the side and roasted the garlic. Great combination of flavors! Very refreshing and flavorful. I made this the night before serving and it was better the second day when the flavors had melded. It was a big hit. Even my dad, who thinks everything should be made with mayonnaise, loved it. Thanks Sandy! I will review again when I make it as written.
