I totally messed up at first and used a 14.75 oz can of creamed corn.  Because of that, I had to add a cup of flour before the mix was even remotely "ballable".  That works out to about four times more flour than the recipe called for.  I only fried one nugget to try.  I thought it was okay, but I like soft, gummy, doughy things.  Others might not enjoy the texture and I certainly don't think this supplies any real sort of vegetable benefit.  I'm going to try adding corn meal, salt, and sugar to the mix to try and make this into something approximating hush puppies.

I thought these were pretty good.  I've never had these before, commercial or homemade, so I really don't know what they are supposed to taste like.  I had to add more flour than it called for (probably about 1/4 to 1/3 cup total when I was finished) because it just didn't clump enough to make balls.  That could have been because I made the creamed corn from scratch, though.  I had a hard time dipping them in the cornmeal, but they fried up well enough.  Bf kept commenting that they were sweet, but good.
