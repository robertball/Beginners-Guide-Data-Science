Super good & super simple! I knew from scanning the ingredients that I would have to make extra sauce so adapted the measurements accordingly:  1/3 C. brown sugar plus another "handful," 1/3 C. plus 2 T. soy sauce, 2/3 C. water, 3 large cloves garlic minced & a good heaping tablespoon of jarred ginger paste (we like it flavorful at our table). Plus, since we like it so much, a good four or five splashes of nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish sauce) to give the sauce body and depth.  To add extra flavor to this dish, mix the marinade in a non-reactive bowl and then use the marinade to deglaze the skillet after you've browned the chicken, scraping up all the browned chicken bits from the pan & incorporating in the marinade.  Then pour the sauce over the chicken & cook as directed. Close to serving I steamed broccoli & baby carrots, then mixed with the chicken & served over jasmine rice.  Heavenly, scrumptuous, a new "classic" in our house!

This was very tasty! I used 3 chicken breasts, instead of a whole chicken. I also had to triple the sauce. It is a little salty, so make sure you use the low sodium soy sauce or up the water a little bit. Overall a great dish!!

I was so in the mood for something Chinese and with  a few modifications this was good.  I used chicken thighs (skinless, bone in) I added some sesame oil to the sauce.  Then to thicken it during the last 30 min of cooking I added the juice from a can of pineapple chunks mixed with some cornstarch.  I added the pineapple too.  This made a nice flavorful sauce to go over the brown rice I served it with.  Thanks for the great recipe!

With adaptations I gave it five stars...  When mixing the sauce I eliminated the water, added the juice from a large can of pineapple tidbits, doubled the brown sugar, increased the garlic and added 1.5 T. of Minute Tapioca as a thickener.  I stirred in the pineapple tidbits at the very end just to heat them.  Without the pineapple and its liquid there wouldn't have been enough flavor or sauce for the rice.  YUM!  It's a keeper.

This was a really good recipe.  I followed others advice and added chopped pineapple and thickened the sauce with the pineapple juice and corn starch.  Next time I think I'll just use chicken thighs and legs because I thought the chicken breasts ( I used a whole cut up chicken) were a little overcooked.  Will make this one again! Thanks!

This recipe was GREAT!  I used chicken breast and made extra sauce since I was mixing in broccoli and serving over rice.  OUTSTANDING!

Yummy! My very picky husband loved it, which is shocking. I used my personal rule of three: if it calls for one clove of garlic add 3 and I used splenda brown sugar. It is pretty salty so don't try it if you have high blood pressure! Also, a good dose of sauce is needed for a more flavorful bite.

I thought this was ok, but I needed to add extra things for more flavor. I used more brown sugar than required w/some chopped candied orange peel and a dash of lemon juice.

I tried this because of reviews and it was quite good. I like a little spice however and added one seeded and chopped jalapeno to it.

I am rating at 4, because I think it needs a little something more. The flavor is good, but it just needs something extra.  I made it as is the first time, and it was ok, but I have to tinker w/ every recipe, so the next time I used 3 boneless, skinless breasts b/c it's what I prefer.  I cut it into chunks, and browned it as directed, like a lot of others, I made more sauce (tripled it), and added a red and green bell pepper, and a dash of cayenne. I cooked it in my slow cooker for 2 hours on high, and another hour on low, then looked at it, the sauce was thin, so I took a spoon full of flour, and added a small can of pineapple juice, and mixed that in to thicken it, and added it to the slow cooker, as well as a bag of frozen broccoli.  Cooked another hour, and checked it and the sauce and broccoli were good.  Served over rice, and this was a hit.  I guess I made several changes, but nothing that was too difficult or time consuming.  Will make this again w/ my modifications.  Thanks for a good base recipe!

This was a great start... following the recommendations of the top review, I added sesame oil, garlic and extra ginger. I also used white wine to deglaze the frying pan, let that boil down and added it to the slow cooker. We served it over rice with steamed broccoli and carrots. Quite good! If my kids weren't eating, I would have added lots of red pepper flakes and/or sriracha to add some HEAT!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I've made it with chicken breast alone, baked in the oven for about an hour at 350 instead of the crockpot and also on top of the stove in a covered skillet.  The leftovers are great too!  I make it frequently.

very nice flavor, very quick prep. i took other reviewers opiniona into consideration as i prepped this dish. saute the garlic and marinade,brown the chicken, i added a splash of sesame oil. later i read to add five spice, good idea.  no more 3/4 tsp. keep in mind this is a small quantity of liquid. rather then change the integrity of the  recipe. i would make a fried rice that doesn' require  e sauce.

My fiance really loved this recipe.  I actually cubed the chicken though so it didn't take quite as long to cook and it was easier to portion out. About an hour before time was up I added frozen stir fry veggies then right at the very end I added chicken broth whisked with flour to thicken and pineapple chunks.  All in all, this was a good one that I'll make again!

This is an EXCELLENT recipe which I have made at least 1 dozen times, with minor modifications: Double the brown sugar and garlic, add 1 Tbsp Minute Tapioca as a thickener and sub the juice of 1 large can chunk pineapple instead of the water. Cook in the crock on high for 3 hours, then remove chicken pieces and broil for 5 minutes on each side to add crispness and color. Return chicken to crock, add pineapple chunks and cook for an additional 1/2 hour. Fabulous over plain white or brown rice with a side of steamed veggies!

We LOVE this dish, one of our favorites and great left over. We make more sauce, using low sodium soya sauce, and generally have it over brocolli or other greens - though quite often it gets pinched straight from the slow cooker before it hits plates!

This was not our favorite slow cooked oriental chicken recipe.  The sauce was ok....but I doctered it up by adding just a little more brown sugar, some honey, orange zest, and thickened it up with some cornstarch.  I also added some green onions.  The sauce before I tinkered with it was ok....after hubby said he really liked.  Thanks for the idea.

Thanks to the other reviews, I used low sodium soy sauce and used a little less than the receipe stated. I increased the water a little and added sesame oil to replace the unused soy. Overall, delicious recipe!

Awesome.  Super simple and my husband and I loved it.

The only thing I don't like is having to cook the chicken before putting it in the crockpot because the crockpot is usually my lazy way out of cooking.  Next time I might try just throwing it in raw and letting it cook a little longer, but I'm worried that may make it become slush.

as with most recipies i didn't follow this exactly.  I added waterchestnuts to the crockpot just because i have had the can forever and am happy to be able to finally use them, i also added onions, because i love them so much.  This came out great.  even my picky eaters a 4 and 7 year old loved it and had seconds. I will make again.  I served with with rice made with veggie broth and added peas to it.  Very good.

This was not too good. It works much better as a stir fry with the same ingredients. Just cut up and stir fry a pkg of chicken in a lrg skillet, push to outside edge, add a bag of frozen veg. stir fry those until thawed and hot then mix together 1/2 C. hot water, 1 t. chicken boullion, 3 T soy sauce, 1 T. brown sugar, garlic powder to taste and 1 T. cornstarch. Make a space in the middle of the skillet, pour in the sauce and cook til thickened. Much better.

It tasted of pure soy sauce.  I used only chicken breast, which came out fine (used 3 of them, approx 1 1/2 lbs).  I shredded it when it was done so that the sauce would mix well with the chicken - and it certainly kept its flavor.  It just that the flavor was salty soy sauce (and I used low-sodium soy sauce).  Although it smelled of ginger when it was cooking, it didn't taste of it.  Since it's just two of us, this was supposed to cover 2 meals, but my husband really doesn't want it again, and I can't say I do either.

4 stars as is, 5 with a few adjustments.  Super great, easy recipe.  I usually serve this with steamed or stir fried veggies and dill rice. First off, the sauce needs to be doubled from the start.  Also, I usually add a little extra brown sugar, plus 2 tb Rice Wine Vinegar and 1 tb Sesame Seed Oil.  When the chicken is done cooking I remove it from the crock pot and pour the sauce into a small pan to thicken with 1 ts cornstarch (mixed into a bit of water before adding to the sauce).

I was looking for an oriental chicken recipe 2 hours before we were going to eat and found this recipe.  Needless to say I didn't have time to put it in the slow cooker, so I simmered it on the stove for an hour and a half and it turned out perfectly!  My whole family enjoyed it!  Next time I'll try it in the slow cooker.  The only thing I'd recommend is using low sodium soya sauce, we found it a little salty.  Look forward to trying it again!

Quick, easy and delicious. I threw these together quickly and the chicken ended up really flavorful and delicious. I loved how I didn't have to marinate these first. I'll be doing these again.

This was absolutely fabulous!!  It definitely reminded me of chicken adobo which I have been making for years and I think that this was better!  I altered the original recipe a bit: added 1/3 cup teriyaki, increased water to 1/3 cup, added approx 1/4 cup apple juice (didnt have pineapple) added about 1 tsp sesame oil and pretty much quadrupled the amount of garlic!  I used 1 lb chicken thighs and 1 lb drumsticks.  I didn't cook on high for 1 hour, just 4 hours on low and then about 1.5 on warm waiting for dinner to be served.  I can't tell you how fantasic this was served over rice with the sauce.  It was in no way too salty!!  Came out perfect!

Good and easy...but I agree with many other reviewers in that this is too salty. I will use low-sodium soy sauce next time. I served with brown rice and steamed brocolli for a quick easy weekday meal.

I loved the idea of this recipe but it didn't work out the way I thought it would.  I used boneless/skinless thighs but I didn't brown them first, just threw everything in.  Maybe browning them would give off a better taste.  I also used what others have posted and used a can of pineapple, not much taste.  I might use breasts next time. :)

This recipe has potential but needs help! As mentioned by others the sauce is way to salty, even for my hubby who loves salt. Would consider using the basics but would need something to subdue the salt, might try adding the pineapple.

Great recipe, so easy and simple, it turned out delicious. I used boneless/skinless chicken breast and browned before adding to the cockpot, then I sauted the garlic (which I trippled the amount) and all the other ingredients, including 8 oz. of tomato sauce for extra sauce.

I loved his receipe, however as some have done in the past I changed it a little. First I fried the chicken, garlic, and ginger in sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. Second I doubled the receipe for the sauce and brought that receipe up to 1 cup by adding a can of cut up pineapple with the juice to the meat. I added the addititional soy sauce (lite salt) and brown sugar to the chicken and cooked it on high for 4 hours. I then added stir fry frozen vegetables to the crock pot and cooked on high for another hour. Then I thickened the sauce with cornstarch and water. I topped it off by adding Angle Hair Pasta and cooked for about half hour more. Then served. It was really great.

Not bad, especially after using some of the ideas to tweek it.  I short cutted things by using a rotisserie chicken that I had picked up for another meal.  I used the tip of adding pineapple and pineapple juice. I also added onion, red and green peppers, and pea pods to get in some veggies Then I increased the brown sugar, garlic, and ginger to my taste.  At the end, I slowly added a corn starch mixture to thicken the sauce.

Excellent prepared as stated in recipe.  The only thing I did was change the garlic cloves to powder (all I had on hand).  I cooked it on the stove as well.  It was delicious.  The sauce was doubled.  It coated the chicken nicely.

Maybe it's a difference in slow-cookers, but I followed this recipe to the letter, and the chicken was almost to the point of overcooked after 1 hour on high and 2 hours on low. It smelled like it was burning, so I checked on it, and am glad I did. Also, the chicken was not really brown like shown in the photo. Maybe I should have browned it in the pan longer, although the recipe didn't give a set time. Will try again, with adjusted cook times.

I didn't change it from high to low after an hour, but had it on high the whole time (5 hours...my crock pot's 'high' is a little weak). I added pineapple about an hour before the end, which added, as well as extra garlic and scallions. I also added cornstarch to try and thicken the huge amount of liquid, but it didn't do much. Still, a nice easy recipe, wasn't knock-socks off amazing but everyone enjoyed it.

My family loved this! I doubled the sauce and added a bag of (thawed)frozen broccoli and carrots about an hour before serving. Pair with fried rice or regular white/brown rice and some egg rolls and you have a great meal!

This is somewhat similar to Chicken adobo which is also listed on this site. I was hoping for something different, but from an unbiased standpoint, this receipe was very good.

I doubled the sauce (there was hardly any to cover the chicken) and only put two boneless chicken breasts in. I cooked it on high for about 3-4 hours. Very tender and turned out really well, especially in the crock pot. But I have another teriyaki recipe that calls for all these ingredients, plus a few more (cooking wine, red pepper flakes) that I like a bit better. But this was good!

This has potential.  I used BleuBelle's sauce suggestions (more or less:  1/3 C soy sauce, 1/3 C brown sugar, 2/3 C water, 3 big cloves of minced garlic, 1 T jarred minced ginger and 2 T Thai fish sauce, plus some crushed red pepper flakes) with 3 lbs of boneless, skinless thighs (more moist than breasts).  I was in a rush, so didn't brown the thighs as thoroughly as I could have; the dish would have been tastier if I'd done that.  I used the sauce mixture to deglaze the pan before adding it to the slow cooker, and cooked for 7 hours or so on low.  I'm still not quite happy with the sauce; it was indeed very salty, although not inedible.  I never have low-sodium soy sauce around, though.  When the cooking time was over I tasted the sauce and thought it was a bit watery; I think that the water should definitely be replaced with something more flavorful, either fruit juice (pineapple, maybe, as other people have suggested, or fresh-squeezed orange; not sure I'd add actual chunks of fruit) or chicken stock.  I took the meat out and reduced the sauce in a pan on the stove, which definitely boosted the flavor but left me with not as much sauce as I would have liked.  I added steamed green beans and toasted slivered almonds, then served it over white rice.  (The name has to go, though.  "Oriental" went out of use about twenty years ago.)  Not bad, but I think I'll keep looking.  Thanks though.

This was not good at all. It just tasted like soy sauce! Too salty! I liked the idea of it but it was lacking in the execution. We served over rice with steamed broccoli. I couldn't even finish my serving.

Pretty good, although I did doctor up the sauce quite a bit.  I doubled it, added in orange zest and then cut the orange in half, squeezed into the pot and dropped it in to soak.  Also used much more ginger than called for, more brown sugar and finally dumped in about a half cup of teriyaki sauce.  Without the changes there was just not enough flavor for us. Sorry.  :(

Using chicken thighs I followed the recipe to a t except I did not do the crockpot thing. I browned the chicken in a pan,added all the ingredients,covered it and simmered it for maybe 25 min. Served it over rice. It was very good.  My family raved about the flavor.

This was pretty good overall but not great.  The sauce was great but I would used chicken breasts exclusively if I did it again. The sauce needs major thickening and it did not hold up when I wanted to eat the leftovers on day 2.

I added some teriyaki sauce to mine and it really took some of the bite out of the soy sauce flavor.  I have also made this recipe on the stove top and it is just as good.

Nothing really exciting about this dish.
