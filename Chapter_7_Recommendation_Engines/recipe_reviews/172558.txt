Not only were these easy, but the cookies were very very good. They stayed moist over until the last crumb was eaten a couple of days later. I made about 4 dozen from the recipe. I used butter instead of shortning. They were great.

Definitely the easiest and best tasting oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever made. I was reluctant to try them due to using a packaged cake batter but it gave a wonderful texture and taste to the cookies (and yes, the house smells fantastic while baking). They turned out perfectly at 11 minutes on a standard cookie sheet with silicone liner. On the air-bake sheet (also using a silicone liner), it took 12 minutes to achieve the same finish. These are small cookies - they don't spread much so be sure your drops are shaped the way you want them. Even being very skimpy (at least I thought I was) on my first batch I only ended up with 5 dozen and 4 cookies.

WOW!  These are probably the best oatmeal raisin cookies we have ever had. We added an extra tsp of cinnamon but that's all.

Oh my gosh, these were amazingly delicious and so easy. I didn't change a thing and they were absolutely perfect. The cookies browned really nicely and were chewy on the inside while a bit crunchy on the outside. And trust me; these are one of those things that smells so much better AFTER they are baked. I definitely recommend this recipe and will be making it again very soon.

These come together so easily. I added another 1/2 c. of raisins and 1 tsp. of vanilla. I did chill the dough for a couple hours before making them into cookies. It helped make prettier cookies that didn't spread. These are very rich tasting. I'd make these again, especially for a bake sale or cookie exchange. NOTE: This made 32 medium sized cookies.

You'd never know that these were made from a cake mix.  Flavor is fantastic, but I wonder if the timing or the temperature is off a little or something?  My cookies never cooked all the way through, and they are VERY delicate coming off of the cookie sheet. And they stuck a little bit to the sheet. They cool down great though.

This was very easy to make and I followed the directions exactly.  These cookies were good but not the best I have had.  One thing that stood out was that there was a hint of "cake mix" in the flavor.  My kids liked them :-)

Followed the recipe exactly. They are nice and chewy, but I definitely recommend an extra tsp of cinnamon. I made about 4 dozen. Yummy!

Excellent recipe. Using the cake mix, rather than flour, salt, etc., makes all the difference!

Fabulous idea this is my second time cooking these in 2 weeks.  My roommate ate them all in a day! 375 is little too hot for these so I dropped the temperature to 350 and cook them for 12 minutes or so.  They come out a little soft but cool off nicely. I also used the highest rack setting so the bottoms would not burn.  The second time I tried carrot cake mix and chocolate chips, fantastic.  I will try chocolate cake mix with the next batch. Great recipe!

These made a lot, but were gone by the next day.  I will also play with using other flavors of cake mixes.  Yumm.

This cookie recipe is easy and delicious. The cookies came out nice and moist.  I added chopped macadamia nuts to part of my batch. Yum! Next time I make these I will decrease the amount of brown sugar a bit. Overall great recipe! Thanks!!

These cookies are easy to make and delicious.  They stay fresh for atleast 2 weeks if they last that long.  I substituted a spice cake mix for the yellow cake mix and used apple/blueberry granola for the oats and omitted the cinnamon.  It was a nice change and very tasty.

I used parchment paper, baking at 350 for 14 min. I tried to loosen them right away and got misshapen ones, so next batch I  leaf on the paper for a few minutes and they turned out great.  I don't know how they got 72 servings, I got 4 1/2 dozen.  I added a bit more cinnamin, and wished I had added more. I used about 1 1/4 c. sultana raisins and would have loved to add nuts, but made them for coffee time at church and none are allowed.  Perfect for making & taking.  They all looked uniform and didn't spread out much.  I wondered if I should have added more oatmeal because you can't see it, but as the dough sits between batches it does thicken.  Yes, there is a cake taste, more cinnamin might help that. I have another recipe for a chocolate/choc chip cake mix, and you do have to watch for the perfect time to take them out.  I say you wait until they have risen, then "fall".  If you take them out too soon they aren't cooked right.  Thus the 350 for 2 extra minutes helps.

Awesome! I didn't change a thing except adding the extra 1 tsp of cinnamon. My husband ate 6 from off the cooling rack before waiting for them to cool. Wonderful warm with a cup of coffee. So wonderful. Love the use of a cake mix which I seem to always have stuffed in the pantry.

These were definately the best oatmeal cookies I have made so far. Everyone loved them. I added extra cinnamon and different pieces of dried fruit, I think chocolate would work nicely, too. I'll do that tonight. Enjoy!

The taste was great and the texture was wonderful. I added a little extra cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract.
My only complaint is that the cookies were a little on the thin side. I also calculated the recipe for 36 cookies & only got about 20 when all was said and done. The cake mix made the recipe very easy!
