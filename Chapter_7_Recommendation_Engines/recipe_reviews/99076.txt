This was delicious, but I have to admit I prefer it without lettuce. The mayo and hot sauce dressing is a great combination. Thanks!

I made this for my teenage sons that love hot sauce. I used thin sourdough and swiss cheese; they absolutely loved this! Oh, one other time saver was that I used the pre-cooked bacon. I didn't try this but they gave it 5 stars! Thanks!

These were great, us co-workers have brought in a toaster and george foreman grill so we can make our own lunches instead of the same old cold sandwiches and microwave dinners.  We did use pre-cooked microwave bacon.  Loved it with the hot sauce.  Thanks for a great post.
