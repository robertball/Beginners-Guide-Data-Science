This came out wonderful, even though I made a number of adjustments.  I used leftover pot roast, which cut down on the prep time considerably. I added 1/4 c. chopped onion; 1 clove garlic, chopped; and 1 stalk celery sliced; and 1/2 t. Seasoned salt; 1/2 t. Italian Seasonings; and 1/4 t. pepper.  After cooking the vegetables, I realized the remaining broth was not going to make enough sauce, so I also added one package of brown gravy mix, prepared, to the final sauce, and added a splash of red cooking wine.  Instead of just frozen peas, I added 1/2 c. frozen corn as well.  I pre-baked the bottom crust for about 7 minutes and it came out nice and flaky, not at all mushy.  I added sliced mushrooms to the top of the vegetables in the pie before putting on the top crust.  

The one thing I didn't do, but will next time is layer the vegetables and sauce in the final assembly.  I had just put the sauce over all the vegetables and it didn't soak through like I would have liked.  This recipe probably would have been great with a lot less tinkering by me, but it came out wonderful even after playing with it.

Why do people CONSTANTLY rate their OWN version of these recipes 5 stars?!  The entire point is to give feedback to the person who created/posted it.  If you're going to change it up then don't bother rating it at all, because that's not accurate.  I made this recipe EXACTLY AS STATED and it turned out great!  Kudos to you for coming up with something tasty!

I am giving this recipe 5 stars even though I didn't follow it exactly.  I used stew beef, put that in the bottom of the crock pot.  Threw in the salt, pepper and cornstarch, added garlic and onion powder, then tossed to coat.  I put the veggies in on top of that and poured in the beef broth.  I cooked until beef was done and veggies were tender.  Then I put it in a 9x13 pan, and dropped biscuits on top.  I baked at 350 until the biscuits were done.  We all loved it.  Thank you for the base recipe!

This was a hit at my house. I found it easy and excellent. I did cheat though and instead of making the gravy I used 2 packs of brown gravy mix. I assure you this was the right amount of gravy and not dry. Will make again. But I do think using fresh veggies and not frozen is a biggie.

This is a good overall recipe.  I did make a some changes.  First, I added some seasoning (rosemary, sage, white pepper, thyme) to the raw meat before searing (locks in some flavorful juices).  Then,  I used a combination of water and dry red wine to stew the meat (skim any scum off).  I removed the meat after it was done then cooked my vegetables in the same liquid as the beef (add water & salt as necessary) .  By doing this it will give you a better tasting gravy which will need less cornstarch because the vegetable starches which will help to act as a thickening agent.  Adjust the salt, white pepper and seasonings to taste.  I also added sliced mushrooms at the end.  I have found that if you increase your vegetables slightly, you will have enough for 2 pies.   I used a homemade double crust to which I added about a teaspoon each of dried rosemary, thyme and some pinches of salt & white pepper to the flour before cutting in the shortening. It really makes a big difference.

I prepared and froze this dish for my 'once-a-month cooking' group--I thawed and cooked my pot pie this evening, and it was great!  I made a few changes to the recipe that made it a good bit easier--I used a frozen green pea/carrot mix for the veggies, and I also used frozen cubed hash brown potatoes for the potatoes.  Since I was going to be freezing my pies, I didn't precook the veggies at all (didn't even thaw them!), just added them into the pie and covered with gravy--it was a lot easier!  I also added some undiluted cream mushroom soup and dry brown gravy mix to the sauce, and was then able to omit the cornstarch.  My family enjoyed this a lot, even my 19-month-old!  Thanks

Everyone LOVED this pie.  Adjustments: I left out the peas and added a can of sliced mushrooms.  I used the broth from the simmered meat (yielded one cup)in addition to the can of beef broth.  After the potatoes and carrots (and I added a large, diced onion) were cooked, there wasn't much broth left. I also added 1/3 cup of red wine to the gravy.  The flavor of this pie was outstanding.  My crusts cooked for one hour at 375 degrees so plan according to the directions on the box!  I'm going to try this pie filling in a crock pot the next time.

The recipe is good, but I made a couple of changes which made it easier for me. I dredged the meat in flour and seasoning before browning.  It made a wonderful gravy which I used to cook the vegatables.  I didn't have to use the broth or the cornstarch.  I also added celery and onion to the vegetables. I also cooked it in a caserole dish with only a top crust. My family loved it!

I used leftover grilled steak-really worth grilling up extra steaks just for this. I like to make many small pies and shove them in the freezer for nights when I can't cook or plain don't feel like it. Easy enough to put cooking directions on the pie and let your family make dinner for you!

Very good.  I used chuck stew beef ( that was all I had) but with the simmering it became very tender.  Next time I will make my own pie crust though, I dont care for the ready made.

I started with leftover pot roast and potatoes and carrots that I cooked with it.  I pre-cooked the bottom crust.  I used 8 oz. of the pot roast, 1C carrots, 1C potatoes, and 1 C peas.  I used a combination of chicken gravy I had and some beef soup base and a bit of leftover pot roast mushroom gravy with a little corn starch and had about 3C thickened gravy.  Everything had already been well-seasoned when first cooked with garlic, bay leaves, thyme, salt and pepper, so I just heated everything on the stove to a slow boil, dumped it in the crust, added the top crust, and baked for 45 minutes.  It's much quicker to throw this together from leftovers, and it is very delicious!!! It's also very easy to change based on what's on hand or individual preferences.

OMG!!!! This was soooo good!  I did modify this just a little...I also used stewed beef like one other user because that's all I had. I boiled my beef in beef broth and French onion soup (did not add water) for and additional flavor, after that boiled down to almost at a frying stage...I added 4 cups of water and let it finish boiling down. I omitted the salt (the soup and broth is your salt), the cornstarch and 1/3 C water.  I than took 1 celery stalk and split it down the middle twice and cubed along with the rest of the veges, added about three sprinkles of seasoned garlic powder.  After my beef was done, I re-measured my water and used two dry gravy mixes that makes two cups ea.  While whisking in the gravy mix it immediately thicken a little, added all the beef/vegetable mixture back to the gravy and gave it a stir...ladle the mixture and making sure it had enough gravy into my pie shell...topped it with the other shell and baked.  I had enough left over to make two more pies.  I served mine on top of a bed of rice.  Husband liked it but didn't care too much for the store bought shell because it was a little too sweet for him.  As for me I loved it.  Great comforting recipe. :-)

I had some leftover pot roast (marinated in soy sauce, worcestershire, and beef consomme'), and I separated the meat from the broth, added 1 can beef consomme', 2 cubed potatoes, broccoli, edamame, and shredded carrots, and simmered until tender. I put the meat and solid veggies in a bowl, then added 1 tbsp corn starch to 1/3 c water, dissolved, and added to simmering beef broth. We can hardly wait until tomorrow night to eat it! I cut slits in the top pie crust to allow for ventilation. I know the family (12, 10, and hubby) are gonna love this! (Update: it was wonderful!) We'll definitely have this again!

My family thought this was just okay.  I felt it was a bit bland when made as is.  Next time, I will alter to my family's taste. This definately needs more gravy and seasoning.

I had a whole ribeye steak left over from yesterday's BBQ dinner and looked for a recipe to use it in today.  The idea of a beef pot pie sounded fabulous so I printed this one off!  I thought that a beef gravy sounded tastier instead of corn starch and beef broth; just a personal taste.  So what I did was use a beef gravy package!  I steamed some garden fresh chopped carrots and onion, small cubed potatoes and sliced celery.  I salted and peppered those veggies once they were tender.  Then I cubed up the BBQ'd ribeye which had already been seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder when it was BBQ'd.  I placed the chopped steak and the steamed veggies in a bowl and mixed them up and then after stirring the dried, crushed thyme into the hot gravy, I put the veggies and steak into the deep dish pie plate and poured the gravy on top and then placed the pie crust on top.  Baked as in the recipe at 400F for 35 minutes.  Let it rest for 20 minutes when done.  The flavors were scrumptious and a five star, for sure.  I don't normally change recipes and then rate them but I just wanted to share this outcome as it was just so good.

Delicious!  I loved the way the steak was cooked to get it really tender.  I did have to keep adding water but I used a VERY big wide pan.  I used that pan because I had decided I would just throw all the veggies (except the peas) in the last 15 minutes or so of the beef cooking to make everything easier and quicker.  Worked like a charm ;)  Of course like all my pot pies I can never seem to get it to look pie-ish on the plate lol!  Unless I completely cool it down I see it impossible!  Anyway, my family REALLY enjoyed this (especially the hubs) so thank you!

Loved this. Did not use the canned beef broth. Since the roast is getting cooked in water, it's easy to make gravy from this rather than canned broth. I threw in bay leaves, some dry onions and garlic (the last 2 cook down to mush, pretty much, but help flavor the meat as it simmered.) When I made the gravy, I removed the bay leaves. You could strain the liquid and remove fat, if you like. Figure a thin gravy ratio of 1 TBL cornstarch to thicken each cup of roast-cooking water you'd like to turn into gravy. 

Once the gravy thickens and I salt/pepper/season it to suit us, I combine with the meat and vegetables so I can make sure I have enough gravy before putting it in the shells. I follow another poster's suggestion to make from-scratch crusts and to pre-bake the bottom shell. I like to make this as a multiple-meal dish (ie Once a Month Cooking.) It can be done without crust if you can't be bothered, or with biscuit for a top crust. 

When freezing this for later meals, I PRECOOK until crust just starts to brown before freezing. This means that I only have to bake until hot (165 degrees in center) before serving. This also allows me to use the dish from frozen if I need to. There is some time penalty from frozen, but nothing like it would be if it had to COOK as well as thaw in the oven. Thawing first works better, but life is busy. 

Note: a layer of parchment paper under your bottom crust will allow you to remove the frozen pie from your baking dish for storage.

I have made chicken, turkey & veggie pot pies since I was about 10, but never a traditional "homemade" from scratch beef pot pie.  I've made Shepard's pie, enchilada pie, and every kind of quiche imaginable (including about 8 original quiche recipes, like my Reuben quiche).  I already had a good idea about what to put in a beef pot pie, & how to season it to our taste, but wasn't sure about how to thicken the gravy so it isn't too thin or to thick.  I just found this site last week, when looking for a recipe for a Barbie Doll Cake.  Everyone was so helpful I figured I could get some info here.  This recipe was most helpful regarding thickening, so I based my beef pot pie on this procedure.  Admittedly, I also added some veggies I like, like celery & mushrooms, and more seasonings, but it came out perfect with respect to the sauce, and we all loved it!

This was very good, but I think the bake time, listed as 25 minutes at 350 degrees F, is incorrect.  It took 45 minutes at that temperature to be browned sufficiently in my oven.

Excellent. This is my version. Used leftover potroast beef [shredded] and gravy. Added one can of cream of mushroom soup to gravy in large sauce pan, burner on med.low heat. boiled three large peeled and cubed potatoes till fork tender in boiling salted water, drain; add to gravy. Add one beef boullion cube. I also put a bag of frozen mixed veg. in pan. Stir, let cool, then put in your pie crust. I baked at 425* for about 45 min. Yum!

Excellent pot pie.  I used a can of Campbell Beef Vegetable soup and liquid beef oxo.  Thickened it with flour and it turned out fantastic.  Added about 1 tbsp parsley and 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.  This will make it in to my regular rotation.

Really tasty. Used the slow cooker instead of the stove top but used the same ingredients.  I browned the meat first, put it in the slow cooker then mixed it with the cornstarch salt and pepper. I topped it with the carrots And potatoes and poured 20 ounces of beef broth on top. Let it cook for a few hours  then put it in the pie shell and baked for  25 minutes at 350 degrees. It was a hit.

EXCELLENT!!!  I did add some extra seasonings based on other people's suggestion.  I added sage, thyme, rosemary, celery salt, & garlic powder to the gravy mixture.  
I also recomend using 2-3 times the beef broth so you have something to make the gravy with.  My first can of broth was almost gone by the time my carrots and potatoes where done coooking.  
I highly recommend this recipe as everyone in my family loved it!

This is a really easy recipe, though it takes a long time to make. Took me almost 5 hours total. But it was DELICIOUS!!! My husband had seconds so I know it was really good because he hardly ever has seconds. I did make a few modifications: used a beef bouillon cube when simmering the steak and added some red cooking wine. Then when the carrots and potatoes were cooking, I added garlic, onion, thyme and fresh rosemary. I had to add some water to the gravy mixture because there wasn't much left after cooking everything else. I might use 2 cans of beef broth next time. The one thing that annoyed me a little was that it made a lot, way too much for 1 pie pan. So I used a bigger dish, which the pie crust didn't exactly fit but I stretched it out to fit. Baked it for 50 mins and it was perfect. Definitely will be making this one again; it's a keeper!!

Excellent. I have never made a pot pie and my husband loves them.  I used what I had in the house. Beef was the end piece of a beef tenderloin which I dusted with flour before browning.  Also sauted mushrooms and onions together and added to beef.  I needed to use these up.  Then continued with the recipe as written.  Results were awesome.  Thank you for the posting.

This was pretty good. The only confusing thing was how much gravy you should have. My potatoes and carrots absorbed a lot of liquid while cooking.

I used a blade roast and while it was simmering I added 2 bay leaves. I didn't use the beef broth or frozen peas because I didn't have either on hand so I used onion, celery and carrots. With a little salt and pepper I found it was quite tasty. My hubby ate as a stew for two days and loved it then I made pie crust and made meat pies for him to have when I work afternoons.

My husband gave this two thumbs up and said he would like to have it again...soon.  I used cooked, cubed london broil that I had in the freezer so it only took a little over an hour to prepare and cook the pot pie.  I don't like peas so I left them out and added one stalk of celery and three green onions, sliced.  I also reduced the cornstarch and added three tablespoons of brown gravy mix to help thicken the broth and make it richer.  It is a very adaptable recipe that allows you to add and delete vegetables to your taste. It was perfect comfort food on a cold, snowy day.

This was a delicious beef pie. I had leftover pot roast and au jus that I put to use instead of the sirloin steak and canned beef broth. And since there are only 2 of us at home I cut the recipe in half, cooked it in a small casserole dish and only used a top crust. This is a real keeper for using up leftover roast beef.

This was simply AWESOME!    I cheated and had leftover prepared beef pot roast from Costco (Mortons) and used it in place of the first two ingredients.   Everyone loved it and you can add whatever vegetables you prefer or have in the fridge!

Super! Dredged beef strips in half cornstarch- half flour... Gravy was perfect. Added raw chopped veg in last 10min of cooking beef, it didn't need any additional beef stock. Used onion, carrot, celery and potato as the veg. Popped it in individual casserole dishes, shortcrust pastry on top, served with chopped parsley topping on the side... Deelish!

This is delicious! Followed previous reviewers tips and made the following changes: dredged meat in flour and cut way back on the cornstarch; added bay leaf to simmering meat, then removed before combining with other ingredients; spiced up with thyme, rosemary and fresh ground black pepper; doubled the sauce; made like casserole and only topped with one crust...but hubby said he'd like it next time as a pot pie with 2 crusts, as that was his favorite combined with meat/sauce.  Also, next time I'll double the meat for my hungry growing teens.  Thanks Stephanie.

This turned out really well. The only suggestions I have are to double the gravy (tastes great but just not enough) and maybe add some onion. This was very good and very easy to make.

This recipe is awesome! My whole family loved it. The only thing was that it was kind of bland tasting. Next time I am going to add garlic. I did frozen mixed veggies instead of the veggies listed, and it was still great.

This recipe was very good and delivered an excellent meal!  I used leftover prime rib from our Christmas dinner, so I did not have to go through all the meat prep - I would probably only make this using some sort of meat leftovers.  I also added 1/2 yellow onion, diced very finely and did not add the carrots to the broth until the last 5 minutes so that they did not get too mushy.  A full cup of peas was a bit much (and I like peas!)
I used 16oz water and 2 boullion cubes rather than beef broth and did find that I needed to add more liquid when I made my gravy (I actually ended up just adding some leftover gravy from Christmas dinner).
The bake time ended up being more like an hour; when I make it again I will raise the heat just a bit and aim for a bake time of about 45 minutes.
All in all, really, really good!

this was pretty good, although i made several adjustments. first i used venison steaks and dredged in flour, s&p, thyme, and garlic powder and after browning, i added the water, a beef bouillon cube, and about 3T. of worcestershire and only cooked in the water for about 1hr (i didn't even really need to do this my venison was tender to begin with). i used 1 large potato, 2 carrots, 2 mushrooms, 1 celery stalk, half a can of corn, about 1/2 c. frozen peas and like others suggested used the water from the meat pan to add with my beef broth, also spiced the veggie water with 1 garlic clove, s&p, celery seed, thyme. as far as the gravy is concerned, i did make a packet of brown gravy mix but tried to use as little as possible the sauce you make is so good i hated to ruin it by adding but it needed more liquid

Yummy! This was hearty and easy. I wanted to cut out some of the calories, so I used pork chops. But it was yummy!

This pie was quite delicious.  To save time, I used leftover tri-tip and and roasted red baby potatoes.  I sauteed the carrots with onions and garlic.  After removing the carrots/onions/garlic from the skillet, I cooked the beef broth and cornstarch/water mixture in the skillet until it thickened into a nice gravy.  Then, I added all the ingredients to the gravy, placed it in a pie plate with homemade crust, and baked it until the crust was brown.  It was a hit.

My BF "Dig a hole in the backyard and bury it.  Dig a deep enough hole, so if you make it again, there's room for your body."  It was edible for me, but he couldn't even look at it.  He covered it with paper towels.  I added a cup of wine to the broth, and extra spices such as sage and thyme.  I also added a sauteed onion.  No salvaging this recipe.

I love this recipe, Best pot pie I've ever had although I did change it a bit. I used Stew meat dredged in flour with Broiled steak seasoning, Mrs. Dash, Garlic, Onion salt and ground peper before browning. I used beef broth and simmered in crock pot. seperated beef from broth, cooked vegies in broth, used arrow root to thicken. browned bottom crust prior to filling.

This is a great pie if you have leftover beef.  I cut up 2 lbs of leftover roast and put 1/2 in pie crust.  As someone else had suggested, I took 2 cups of beef broth and threw in cut up carrots, frozen peas and 2 cups of frozen hash browns.  I boiled it together and strained it leaving the little bit of liquid still in the pan.  Pour 1/2 over meat in crust.  To drippings add 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 pkg of brown gravy mix.  (Another suggestion)  Pour 1/2 into crust and repeat last layers.  Cover with remaining crust and bake.  It was wonderful and VERY EASY.  Can't beat that.  Thank you so much!

Fantastic. I made the recipe without the pie shell, I made biscuits insead. But it would have been good with a pit shell too I am sure. My husband loved it. I did add some seasoning to the water for the beef, I think that helped with flavor, and I only used 2T of cornstarch for the gravy. (I started with 2T and held the 3rd out to see if I would need it - didnt!)It would have been way too thick with 3T as called for so I gave 4 stars.

THIS is REALLY good.  I've made a turkey/chicken pot pie before ... never a beef one.  My husband and I would DEFINITELY have this again.  I added chopped onion - which really enhanced the flavor!

This is a tasty recipe.  I read the other comments about the bottom crust not cooking so I Pre-cooked the bottom crust and then added the filling and cooked.  It needs more gravy and was dry.  Great idea and I may add more broth and make again.

I usually prepare chicken pot pie but tried this for the red meat lover in my household.  We all enjoyed this recipe.  I used frozen hashbrowns rather than fresh potatoes as suggested by another review.  Also used the broth generated during the cooking of the steak rather than canned broth.  Excellent.

I love this recipe and so does my family.  However, it's even yummier with extra sauce.  I double the sauce, and it makes a huge difference.  If you can't fit it all into the pie, serve the extra sauce on the side.  So good!

Made this last night and it was really good.  However, next time I believe I would prefer mixing the meat/veggie mixture into the gravy before filling the pie shell.

This was a good start for a beef pot pie.  I will however experiment with different herbs to try to make it taste more like Swanson's hungry man's beef pot pie...my favorite.

This was very good.  I wanted to cut down on the time, so instead of boiling the meat for 2-3 hours, I browned with onions and garlic and then boiled for 30-45 minutes.  It wasn't fall apart tender, but got it done much sooner.  I also used canned potatoes and carrots to cut down on the prep time of the veges.  When making the gravy, I added onion powder, garlic salt, salt and pepper.  I baked for 25 minutes, that wasn't nearly long enough for crust to get crisp, so had to double the time.   Overall the finished product was very good.

Making this again tonight, we just love it!  I like to make it with leftover steak that we grilled, it gives it a great taste.  I also add the juices from the meat to the potato beef broth for the gravy so there is plenty.  It's also good to add some fresh mushrooms or even some canned ones to it.  I also use a bag of mixed veggies instead of cutting up carrots, this way it has green beans, etc included.  LOVE IT!!!!

Excellent recipe!  I love the fact that it doesn't have any pre-made soups in it.  I did alter this a bit (added onion, celery and more spices) but otherwise I didn't change a thing.  I did have to bake it for 45 minutes though.

I made this dish on a cold night. I had a 2 lbs of sirloin steaks. They werent the greatest cut of meat. I had no idea what to do since it was too cold to gril. I pulled these out FROZEN threw them in a pot of water (just enough to cover it) with the same amount of bullion cubs. Boiled about 2 hrs until tender enough to shred. After shreding beef and returning it to the pot, I cut up some potatoes threw them in and cooked about 15 or so mins til done. I added a bag of frozen veggie mix (Carrots corn peas green beans) and cooked a few mins. Added garlic powder, black pepper to taste and the cornstarch. I put it in a 13X9 pan covered with the pie crust and baked until crust was done. Delish!! Impressed the heck out of the in-laws!! Thank you!!

I did change this a bit. I dredged the meat in seasoned flour before cooking and threw in a bay  leaf with the water. I used the resulting liquid for the gravy instead of canned broth and added worcester sauce to it. I also left out the potatoes as my husband wanted mashed potatoes on the side. Both my husband and my picky daughter came back for seconds. Thankyou for a winner Stephanie.

This was a fantastic dish!  Of course, I didn't follow the recipe to the letter, but it was a great jumping off point for me.   I tossed the beef in flour, garlic powder, onion powder, kosher salt and fresh black pepper before browning.  Instead of simmering it in water, I used 2 cups beef broth.  I also threw in some balsamic vinegar to give it some tang.  When it was time to cook the vegetables, I added extra beef broth to the leftover broth from the meat. I also mixed the gravy with the shredded beef and vegetables instead of pouring it on top. It was fabulous, and my husband said it's going to replace beef stew in my catalog of meals.  I can't wait to eat it again!

This is most definitely a 4 and a half star recipe.  I made a few changes, only for personal preference.  I'm sure it's fantastic as written.  I used a little flour on the beef, I added garlic and Worcestershire sauce, and I added a little more liquid.  I thought it was so good I could have made myself sick eating too much!

I gave this recipe the five stars.  First, it was very simple I did not have to create a pie crust from scratch.  Two, this recipe is filling and will definately hold you.  Third, the kids enjoyed it!!!  The only thing I had changed was by adding Garlic Powder to the meat before pouring it into the pie shell.

Definitely a keeper, but it needs a little more than carrots and potatoes.  I added a little corn, celery, and browned the steak with onions and various spices (a little Dijon mustard, too).  I didn't boil the meat, either... I prefer it a with a little substance.  ;-)

Excellent!  My husband ask me several times to find a recipe for pot pie.  This was my first try and he really liked it.  I used a basic flaky pie crust and was vert pleased.

Man, this was disappointing.  Maybe pot pies just aren't for me, but this lacked flavor.  If I ever do this again, I'm going to marinade the meat in some kind of sauce beforehand, and use sweet potatoes.  Bland, bland, bland.

This turned out very tasty, a little too runny though so next time will thicken more. I also was not crazy about the pie crusts, they didn't seem to hold the filling very well and seemed to get thin and mushy. Next time I will make my own and I'm sure it will be great!

Luckily I used the meat from a left over roast (which was already well seasoned) for this pot pie because otherwise I think it would have been really bland.  Also, I cooked the veggies in the beef broth and then thickened it as directed, but it got very thick, very fast and really was hardly any gravy for the pot pie, just a small amout of gluey sauce, so the pot pie ended up rather dry.

Very good! 100 times better than the frozen kind. Needed a little more salt and pepper added at the serving stage, but I will know next time to add extra to the gravy as it thickens. I will definitelty be adding this one to the family menu!

This was very good and hearty.  I used what veggies i had on hand with homemade pie crust.  Made another for the freezer.  Love those pot pies.

This is a nice filling. For the veggie part, I first sauteed some chopped onions, added the potatoes and carrots and sauteed a bit more, then added the broth. I put in a bay leave and some peppercorns to give it more flavour and removed them before putting into the pie.

WOW!  Great recipe!  Unfortunately I put too much meat and veggies in and didn't have enough of the gravy to really keep everything moist.  Purely my error, though, and everyone LOVED this recipe.  What fun, too!  THANKS!-

I found this to be a really good recipe, the kids really liked it.  The prep and cook time was a little misleading, because of the time it took to simmer the beef, but I enjoyed the recipe overall.  I will definitely make this one again.

This is a really GREAT recipe.  It was very tasty and overally easy to put together.  I used the "baby" carrots and red potatoes which cut off a little time for tenderization of the veggies.   Thanks for the recipe; it was a big hit.  Even my 6 year old liked it!!!!!

way too many mods to be considered a useful recipe. did not shred the meat. what a ridiculous idea. cooked the cubes for about an hour and they were fork tender. cooked the vegetables one type at a time in the liquid the beef was cooked in and added with broth to cover. when they were done, all three were seasoned together. enough broth was added to the liquid to make 2 cups and then the cornstarch mixture was added to that. the pillsbury crust has to cook at 425 for something like 45 minutes. c'mon, you're not even close with that 25 min at 350. i was going to give this recipe 2 stars but after typing this it's easy to knock this down to 1

Need to mix the broth/gravy to beef & veg. Also, gravy not thick enough.  I would use regular gravy method of: melt fat in pan (butter), add flour, stir until browned. THEN add the broth and simmer until thickened.  I just added the broth with cornstarch (that hadn't thickened enough... even after adding more cornstarch) and it was great! Also added some onions & celery and only used top crust. Excellent base recipe.

Delicious!  I used leftover chuck roast with gravy from that.  I pre-boiled 1/4 c. chopped onion & a few sliced white mushrooms in the gravy.  If the gravy is not thick enough add  some water mixed with cornstarch and stir it in when it boils. Pour it in the pie dish with the meat & veggies and follow the recipe the rest of the way.

I pretty much followed the directions a written but used venison instead of beef. There is not enough gravy so next time I will make twice the amount, it was a little dry but still tasty.

Used this recipe as my guide, but had to make adjustments due to time and money constraints. I was able to use frozen peas and carrots (99 cents) and leftover prime rib from a holiday dinner. Fundamentally the same concepts as the recipe. Thank you for posting.

I made this recipe exactly as it states. Overall it was great. It was a bit dry. Not sure what I can do for next time. Maybe not add cornstarch part at all and just cover with beef broth. Or maybe use a jar of gravy and top-it with that. If anyone had a suggestion on how to make it more saucy, I would appreciate that.

My family and I loved this.  I tweaked it a little by adding some chopped onion, garlic powder ,  cayenne  pepper, ginger.  Also, I omitted the corn starch and use a dry pack of McCormick Brown gravy mix as the thickener. 
Yum!

I took advantage of a cold weekend to make this. With one little twist, venison was used instead of the beef. It was a little time consuming but all I had to do was tend the fire and watch some football I made do.

I made this using some left over prime rib from Christmas. I used a frozen vegetable bag that had carrots, peas, corn, and green beans. It's convenient and adds great color. I found this recipe to be good and it's a very filling meal. I love pot pies for the convienence and getting another meal out of left overs. I'll make it again but next time I'm going to add more seasoning because it seemed to be missing the pop of flavor I was looking for.

I added fresh rosemary to the beef and 1/2 cup marsala wine to the gravy mix, otherwise stuck the recipe.  A little dry, could've used more of the gravy in the pie.  Otherwise, it turned out excellent!

This was pretty good, definitely needed more gravy. It was a little dry which is why I have it 4 stars.

On this occasion, I was using up left overs, so I eliminated some of the precooking steps. Otherwise I followed the recipe completely and it came it out great!

Started out making this exactly as the recipe said and it would have been very bland. Added a bay leaf to the simmering meat, and some thyme and rosemary.

This was very good, but I did make some changes. I browned 1# hamburger with a chopped onion, and garlic. After browning, I sprinkled the cornstarch on the meat/onion mixture, then slowly added the broth and some Worcestershire sauce. I then added a can of mushrooms and a bag of frozen mixed vegetables as well as 3 (boiled/baked/microwaved) potatoes (diced). I mixed it all together with S & P, garlic powder, and a bit of seasoned salt.   I then dumped it in a crust ( I prefer homemade crust), sprinkled a bit of flour over the top, and then put on the top crust.   While eating dinner, my husband asked me if I'd written down what I'd done for this one so we can have it again!  It was a hit!

I tweaked this recipe a lot. I would give my version 5 stars as the original lacked flavour. There was enough filling for 2 pies but not enough gravy, although I doubled the beef broth. I would also simmer the beef in a concoction like braised short ribs rather than water.  I added a lot of seasoning, including Emeril's Essence, Italian seasoning, parsley, paprika, Montreal steak spice. I added puréed onion and garlic to the broth to enhance the flavour.  This had a bit of heat.  Delicious!

No. I was very disappointed with my pot pie. I think IF I attempted this I would do the gravy packets like others said they did. What a waste of money...

I made but changed a few things.   I cooked stew beef in pressure cooker only took 25 mins.   I used diced potatoes ,  and frozen carrots, corn, green beans and peas.  Baked for 45 mins.  Baked on cookie sheet.  It was excellent.

Always looking for new recipes.  I loved this one with all fresh ingredients and not all frozen, but big ingredient I love is cinnamon.  Its been a staple of my beef pot pie, and my mother's and my grandmother's, for years.  Cinnamon really enhances the flavor of the beef.  I personally also like onion.  But otherwise kudos to this recipe.  And to the reviewers that made so many changes that it was no longer the recipe posted - just please stop.  Post your recipe separately.

I made pie crusts from scratch, used med. rare prime rib left over from Christmas, cut into small pieces. I sautéed the vegetables in 2 tblsps. butter before adding broth and I also benefited by the user comment to use 1 packet gravy mix and 1 cup water. Instead of the cornstarch I added 2 tblsps. flour to the vegetables before the broth and combined it well. I added 2 tblsps. red wine and 1 tsp. herbs provence, baked in a 10 inch pie pan at 375 for 40 minutes. This made 4 generous servings. Would definitely make again.

I agree with Frammel Pie that a true rating should be on the exact way a recipe is written on this sight, BEFORE  you make your own alterations to it.  That being said, as is, this recipe is just okay.  It needs onion and herbs.  To bland.

I used leftover roast so I was able to skip a step.  Added some rosemary to the mix.  I did have trouble getting my crust to brown enough.   I would probably make this again if I have leftover beef but to me, then end result doesn't justify the trouble of starting completely from scratch.  So, this won't be a ''go to" recipe for me.

Delicious!! AND everything (except for the pepper) is IC friendly :)  I actually recommend the 'flaky pie crust' recipe, instead of the frozen bit, on this website if you have the time for it.

I made the filling like I would a pot roast.  I cooked the roast in my crockpot on high for about three and a half hours, adding the potatoes and vegetables an hour and half before the meat was done.  I did add some onion and minced garlic and worcestershire to the beef broth.  After it was all cooked, I mixed up a packet of dry brown gravy mix with the gravy in the crockpot, then poured it over the filling in the pie crust.  I also baked the bottom crust before filling it.  It was pretty good! My husband and I ate the whole thing ourselves because he especially liked it.  I think next time, I'll try using green beans with the carrots.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful recipe - cut out stars for the top and my 2-year-old now calls it "star cake". I used too much meat and not enough gravy - might take everyone's advice and throw in a packet of gravy mix next time. Thank you for a great recipe!

This was really fantastic. It is very filling and perfect chilly nights. I too had to bake it longer to get a nice crust.

Quite good. I made a few minor changes to the recipe. I added onion and garlic powder to the gravy and had to bake the pie at 400F for 40 mins. My husband loved it, I prefer my pot pies with more gravy. I would make this again.

Pretty good. I found I had to bake the pie longer than the directions said (more like 35-40 minutes) and that the beef didn't take nearly 2-3 hours to cook...more like 1 hour. I may increase the amount of gravy a bit next time and mix it in rather than just pouring it on top.

This was awesome...the meat was so tender after simmering for 3 hours. I did tweak it alittle  based on what i had on hand. I added frozen carrots with the potatos then i added frozen peas and corn (not thawed) when i mixed everything together. It was so filling and a good way to get my family to eat more veggies.

This was delicious!  Since stew meat can be expensive, I used patio steaks, cooked them whole, and then shredded them.  You could use your favorite vegetables such as turnips, rutabagas, celery, whatever you like.

Very tasty.  The only thing I did different was to saute a medium onion in the water that I used to boil the meat and then added the onion to the beef, potato, carrot mix.  Also added a few canned mushrooms that I had left over.  Quite good and will probably make again

This is a great recipe!  My family loved it.  The flavor was great and it was simple to make...although a bit time consuming.  The only change I would make is to add more gravy.  With the recommended amount, mine turned out to be a little bit dry.  I will definately be making this again!

The taste of this was god. I added some red wine to the mix for a more adult flavor. The pie took way longer to cook than the instructions said & the bottom came out kind of soggy. My husband wasn't too impressed with this one. I'll stick to chicken pot pies from now on.

Very good!  Tastes great and the beef comes out so soft!  It was a little dry though, some extra broth added when you make the potatoes would be great.

This was okay. I haven't figured out how to keep the bottom crust from getting too moist and that was the biggest drawback. I might try it again with just a top crust.

This will sound weird but because it was between shopping trips, I had to make a few modifications.  I used a box of au gratin potatoes uncooked in the pie.  I also used leftover pot roast for the beef in this recipe, added some baby carrots, and frozen peas.  Then I made it in a casserole dish with only a top crust because I only had one pie crust on hand.  It turned out great!

This was fine.  Nothing special.  I make stew that is similar and wouldn't bother using this recipe again.  Good flavour.  Also there was far too much for a pie plate so I cooked it in a pot with a top crust only
