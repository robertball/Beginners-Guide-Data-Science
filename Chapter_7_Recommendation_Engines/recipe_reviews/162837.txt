I used fresh green beans from my garden for this.  It was a great recipe, but next time I may add some of the dill from my garden also for that something extra!

This was very good.  I used a frozen vegetable mix that included green beans, sugar snap peas, broccoli, yellow squash and water chestnuts.  I used a semi dry peach chardonnay for the wine.  When the vegetables were cooked as much as I wanted, I removed them with a slotted spoon, poured the remaining liquid into a smaller saucepan, and cooked it until it reduced.  Then I poured the sauce over the veggies.  A healthy, tasty way to enjoy vegetables.

I never, ever use canned green beans so I used steam in bag of whole green beans gave them a drizzle of olive oil, tossed them with the minced garlic, salt & pepper.  Then instead of the white wine reduction just gave them a generous splash of white wine vinegar - delicious!

My original review is missing, so I am leaving another one.  I made these using frozen green beans and will use fresh next time.  I finished this off with a few shakes of lemon pepper seasoning for some zest, which seemed to compliment the wine flavor very well.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Delicious! I serve this to dinner guests all the time now. But I only use fresh beans and very little oil.

I used frozen green beans and sauvigion blanc. Next time I think I would use less than a cup of wine or perhaps more beans they were quite drenched in wine. Overall very good though.

Blah. Perfectly good glass of wine wasted on this recipe. I'll stick to using only fresh green beans and keeping wine out of it.

I tried this recipe and all I know is that I will never do this with canned green beans again. My family was very upset with my x-mas dinner. I will try this with fresh green beans when I can go around my family again.

These were excellent. I served it with a basil chicken and it was very good. I followed the recipe with the exception of fresh green beans and I squeezed a quarter of fresh lemon on the finished product. Yum!

I used pepper, no salt. I used 3/4 lb fresh, and about 3/4 cup white wine (moscat I think). I also spritzed some lemon on at the end, as other reviewers suggested. They were okay. The guests enjoyed them, my husband and I were so-so and feel like we like some other recipes on this site better.

No one in my family liked this at all.  Simmering this until the wine sauce reduces just made the beans like mush.  I tried again using fresh beans and those turned way to soft and soggy.  The flavor didn't compliment the veg like I thought it would either.  I do think that there has to be a way to turn this into something that I like but I just haven't found it yet.

We don't like canned vegetables but this is a great recipe.    Now keep canned green beans in pantry and make this recipe often,  for ourselves and guests.  Have taken it to a pot-luck dinner and it disappeared quickly.   Quick and easy.   Love it!

I'm sure it's even better with fresh green beans, but it's a very welcome change for a fast weeknight dinner. For hardly any more effort than microwaving a can of green beans, this is a lot of flavor. Inspired by comments, we added a sprinkle of Herbs d' Provence.

I only had garlic powder and regular green beans, so I substituted those in. I also used canola oil instead of olive and it seemed to work fine (need to go to the grocery store lol) I also added a pinch of sugar because it smelled very strongly and I think it contrasts nicely. Tasted great! Thanks for the idea!

I welcome a new way to prepare green beans but the flavor of this recipe was much too sharp for my taste.I used fresh green beans and served them with a mild flavored fish which did make them easier to tolerate. If making again I would probably reduce the amount of wine and perhaps add a little low sodium chicken or vegetable broth to bring the liquid measure up to the desired amount.

I made these tonight and we really enjoyed them. I didn't have a bag of plain green beans but did have a green bean, wax bean and carrot mixture of frozen vegetables so I used that. I'll definitely make again.
