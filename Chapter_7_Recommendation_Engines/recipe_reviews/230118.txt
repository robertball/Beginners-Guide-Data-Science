This was fabulous! The recipe itself was very delicious and savory. Could see making this again. Husband said he's had it before and I giggled because I'd never made this recipe before and it's a really good verison on Rice-a-roni, but totally worth making. And I mean totally. Will be making for Christmas dinner this year for the non glutens in my family ;-) TY

This recipe is great.  I think the spice mixture was aiming more for Stove Top stuffing instead of chicken Rice-a-Roni, but since rice doesn't pick up the flavors as strongly as bread, the flavor is unlike either one as it is delightfully mild and savory.  This is how a side dish should be, supporting but not overpowering - a definite keeper.  I made two minor substitutions: real long grain rice with enough water to cook it, 1.5 cups water to 1 cup rice ratio, plus an additional 1/4 cup water on top for the dry ingredients; and fresh celery instead of flakes because that's all I had.  You can sub fresh finely minced celery for flakes at a 2 Tb to 1 tsp ratio.  Mixed everything together from the start in a microwave-safe covered container and zapped it on high for 12 minutes (700 watt micro), then let it stand for 5 minutes.  Heavenly as a side for chicken & gravy!  Thank you thank you.  Just what I was looking for.

This actually tastes a lot like stuffing! I ended up using fresh diced onion, diced celery, and fresh parsley because I needed to get rid of them, but I'm sure it's good with the dried versions, too.

I've made this several times. It's a quick side dish to make on a busy day. My daughter loves it but I think it's a little bland. I'll try adding a few changes someday but for now I'll just stick to the recipe.
