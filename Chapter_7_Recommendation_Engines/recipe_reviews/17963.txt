I had to revise this recipe as my grill was out of gas lol, so I cooked in the oven on 375 for about an hour. I took this dish to a family get together, and it was a big hit, everyone seemed to love it. I seasoned the potatoes with salt, pepper, garlic salt, and garlic powder. I didn't use as many potatoes, but I almost doubled the amount of soup. Will definetly make again (hopefully on the grill next time lol). Thanks for the recipe!!

This was awesome! I had 8 people over for dinner today and they flipped for these potatoes! What a flavor they get doing on a grill! I wraped 8 potatoes individually in Renolds new release foil(works great)! I sliced each potato in thin slices. I didn't use onions. I mixed in 1/2 tsp. minced garlic into soup. I spooned the soup in between each sliced piece of potato. I cut up 2 mushrooms per potato. Added salt and pepper, sprinkled with cheddar cheese and put a couple slices of butter in each. I did have to use another can of soup(about half more) because my potatoes were large. A little more time consuming doing it this way, but it was nice because they each had their own personal serving. Cooked on grill 1 hour. Big hit! Thanks Debbie! I will be making this alot!

These were really good. I followed some previous suggestions and was very liberal with the recipe. Only used a couple of potatoes and siced very thin but still used the whole can of soup. Add about 1/4 onion, a handful of mushrooms, dash of salt, and some garlic powder. Mixed it all in large bowl then onto foil with pats of butter. Double wrapped in foil and cooked for one hour on grill. About 5 minutes before serving I openned up foil packet and threw on shredded chedder cheese to melt. They were creamy and delicious. Thanks!

Terrible all around - taste, appearance and time in cooking. Followed the recipe exactly, and it came out looking like a pastey goulash of sorts.  I don't even see how to improve it or change it to more our liking. Would not make ever again and would not recommend.

If you follow awesome in the tummy suggestions, it rates a 5 star.  Thank you Debbie and Awesome in the tummy.  My in-laws loved it!  Also, since I live in New England a grill is not handy in the winter.  Cruisinbeck suggestions of baking the dish in the oven is excellent. I foiled the pan (top and bottom)and sprayed foil with cooking spray.  Baked at 375 for about 60 minutes.  Thanks Cruisinbeck for this suggetion, otherwise it would not be until Spring before I tried this dish.

Love this recipe!!!  I add an extra can of cream of mushroom because I like mine a little more "saucy."  I also sprinkle in a little Ms. Dash for a bit more flavor.  My family loves it & it makes great leftovers for the next day.

These were killer however next time I will make them with the following changes: I'll use half of the butter, add a half of a can or more of the soup, add a clove of garlic and make them in advance of the BBQ as they do take up quite a bit of grill space.

These are a change of pace from regular grilled potatoes.  They are great and my kids really loved them.

Made this in a cast iron over coals when we were camping, it was wonderful. Just enough and the smell was worthy of the taste.

This dish was simply delicious! I followed the recipe, but added copious amounts of black pepper, and put it in a foil-lined 9x13 pan, and put it on the grill.  They were tender, flavorful and completely satisfying.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this last night and myself and my husband really enjoyed it.  I used Broccoli and Cheese Soup and Cream of Potato because I did not have Cream of Mushroom.  Other then that followed the recipe.  I did double wrap and towards the end some juice was leaking out so try to seal as best you can.  Excellent recipe, will do again!

I did not like this at all. I only gave it two stars because I think it probably has the potential for improvement.  I did make it in the oven instead of the grill, as other reviewers had done, so maybe that made a difference in the taste.  I thought it was very bland. Also, the soup was so thick that I had to add milk to get it to thin out and cover the potatoes. The addition of cheese to this seems like a good idea.  I doubt I'll be making this again.

Excellent.  I will make them again soon.  Next time I will try one of the reviewers comments and cook them in the oven for 60 Minutes at 375.

This is an excellent was to mix up grilled veggies!  I LOVE and obsessively make veggies on the grill so this was a great way to change it up a little and it tasted good!
