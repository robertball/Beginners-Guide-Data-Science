Something is not right in the proportions of this recipe. There was far too much liquid for the amount of dough. The liquid stayed thin even after cooking till the max time and the dough had browned. Refrigeration did not help it set up. Finally although I love vinegar this cobbler reeked of it. I managed to get a piece down. Very disappointing.

This was great. I made it yesterday for a family get together. Easy to prepare and the taste is very flavorful. It is deceptively rich. Thanks for sharing.

This is the first recipe that even comes close to the original recipe that came West with the covered wagons. I know because my mother used to make it for our big family. Big families could not afford too many ingredients but butter eggs milk cream and vinegar were plentiful on the farm. Thank you very much -
