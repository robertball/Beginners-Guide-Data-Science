I cut this recipe in half EXCEPT the chocolate chips--I used a full bag. My cookies were done at nine minutes baked at 350*. I let them cool on the baking sheet for a minute before pulling them off to cool on the kitchen counter (I don't use cookie racks to cool my cookies--I've always found I get a softer cookie if I let them cool on the kitchen counter.) These turned out like any good chocolate chip cookie, just like they should. The boys enjoyed them. I think these would be good if I added pecans next time.

These cookies had a great taste, but for some reason the texture was more like a biscuit.

Awesome recipe! I've made these cookies twice. The second time I added white chocolate chips, pecans, and raisins. It's quick and easy to make, and they're just delicious:)

These came out perfectly for someone who can't quite get the hang of baking (especially cookies), so this is definitely a well named recipe, No-Fail. Will be using this one again and again!

Its was good but not perfect. The outside was crunchy and the inside is chewy. Not bad.

Really nice chocolatey chip cookies but I cut back on the chips - was a bit sweeter than I like.  Nice texture and a complete hit at a potluck BBQ

I love to use this recipe and then add ingredients to it when I feel like changing it up. I always make sure to cut the recipe in half and it still makes a ton of cookies because I don't make them too big. A big thing is to make sure that you let them cool for a while before trying to take them off the baking sheet.  I think I'll try adding m&ms next.
Update: 5/13/17
Added peanut butter chips to the recipe and the cookies came out amazing!!

This is the first time I've made chocolate chip cookies in a long time, and it was a big hit.

Aptly named the "no fail" chocolate chip cookies, this recipe was clearly no fail.

The only complaint I have is that it was difficult to take the cookies off the baking sheet. Therefore I greased the baking sheet with butter for the second batch. I would also advise to remove the cookies from the baking sheet within 5 minutes of taking it out of the oven so that it doesn't harden on the baking sheet and be difficult to remove.

I let cool on the cookie sheet as it said and the cookies burnt on the bottom. I suggest to take them off and put on wax paper and cooling rack to cool.
