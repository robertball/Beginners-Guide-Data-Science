They turned out to be as good as they sound, and I'd say they really are "bake sale worthy." I would certainly make them again. The only modification I made to it was using three tablespoons of coconut oil to mix with nine tablespoons of butter when making the crust. I did this because nine tablespoons of butter was all I had handy when I actually needed twelve (equivalent to three-quarter cup). Coconut oil always makes a great substitute when one is either short on butter or wants to go vegan.
