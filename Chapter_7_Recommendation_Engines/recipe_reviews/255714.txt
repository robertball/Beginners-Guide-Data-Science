For me I put a pinch of sugar to make it sweeter, but Iâ€™ll make it again! Wonderful recipe!

I made it in two individual mugs in the microwave and it worked! I started by melting the butter and then added all the ingredient,  except the peaches, mixing well. I placed the peaches on top of the mixture and microwaved one mug at a time for 3 minutes at 500W then 1 minute 30 seconds at 750W. They came out nicely.
