This recipe is delicious and easy to make. I made a few changes and left out the pesto, added Italian seasoning to the meat and onion mixture before adding the fresh tomatoes. I cooked the mushrooms in the over for 350' for 5 minutes before adding the cheese and meat. Then I added chopped bell pepper to the top before cooking for 15 minutes to melt the cheese. They came out really great! It was a big hit and I will make them again!

This is great without the meat as the author suggested. ! I scraped the gills and marinated the mushrooms a bit before grilling outside. It was a hit
