Really easy to make. Yes, the grating of the chocolate is messy, but that's what a paper towel and some 409 are for. The cookies were divine, an instant hit in my house. My one year old devours them whenever he can get his hands on them.

Top Notch!  A friend's wife sent sugar cookies to my work, and left me with a hankering for more.  I did not have any chocolate, so after researching, I substituted a mixture of cocoa powder, sugar and shortening.  I can honestly say that for a 24 year old guy, it's easy to make these cookies, and they're very enjoyable.

In answer to the issue of grating chocolate - good quality chocolate is key.  The higher the cocoa content, the harder the chocolate.  Next freeze the chocolate in small chunks.  When you are ready to use it, take a chunk and wrap it in a little kitchen towel and grate quickly for a few minutes.  Put it back in the freezer and take out the next chunk.  No mess and wonderfully grated chocolate!

It does have to power to create taste bud addiction! I did get up a couple of times in the middle of the night to have a couple of bites! Great teaste and texture. I substituted 1 cup of butter with 1 cup of margarine. Great balance of flavors. I only give it 4 stars and not 5 because of the high calorie content.

I really enjoyed making these cookies.   They're delightfully light and cakey.  Instead of sprinkling grated chocolate, I melted chocolate chips in a double boiler and drizzled it over the cookies after they cooled.

This recipe only got two stars on a few accounts.  one is that the chocolate grating was very messy, it was melting all over my hands, so that wasn't very fun or "easy-to-make".  two is that the cookies were very puffy and tasted like baking soda; I should have probably omitted the soda since I prefer a chewy cookie.  Also the chocolate and soda combo gave the cookie this unappealing grey color.

This recipe taste great, I used my magic bullet for grating the chocolate. Yeah, its kinda messy when I springkled the grated chocolate on the top of the cookies. But my Husband love cookies, so it doesn't matter if its kinda messy, just add patience and hard work for your love ones.

As is, the recipe makes a delicious batch of cookies! Exactly the right amount of sweetness, which is fantastic. I typically cut the recommended sugar portions in half when I bake and I was tempted to do so here, but I’m glad I didn’t.
