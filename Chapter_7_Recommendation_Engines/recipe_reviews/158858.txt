Beautiful recipe. I rolled it out a total of four times, and it puffed up perfectly for both a galette and some palmiers. I will certainly use this shortcut method again - making the real stuff is just too much! The recipe is right - the dough looks terrible during the first roll but it comes together very well by the second or third rolling. Thanks!

It's a nice pastry, I believe even doing more folds and rolling would make it even better.

I did have a little difficulty with this pastry, and I ended up rolling it between two sheets of parchment paper (I make the bottom sheet longer so I can hold it with my hip while I roll).  But the end result was very nice.  I would love to watch Frances make it so mine would look like the photo!  I will try again and use the pastry for cinnamon crispies!

Thanks for posting this recipe, I misplaced the copy I received in culinary school. I hate the ingredients in the store bought stuff, and this method of making puff pastry is great for making at home! I'm planning on using it for a roasted tomato tart with cheve! Yummy!

it was good ,and as the submitter mentioned it doesn`t puff high but I still have enough layers in m pastry. I used AP flour , for the bread flour I used the same mount of AP flour + 1 TBS wheat gluten, and for the cake flour I used 1 1/4 cup sifted AP flour. I hade to make mre folding and rolling coz the butter was still visible after step 3.

This worked perfectly! I was worried I didn't roll it out right (the rotations confused me), but it was great. Even the scraps worked well in the oven! I used this recipe for bear claws. I think I left the dough too thick when I baked it, because I didn't get as many as I expected. Also, I rolled the dough out on wax paper. This really helped when I had to fold the dough the first few times (it would have just fallen apart).

Nice, even though I'm sure I didn't make it the way that it should have been :P Since I pressed in the butter in rather then having long strips, used it to make small apple pies/strudels

Good puff pastry. So long as it's not doubled up too thick.

I love love love this pastry recipe.  I followed it exactly except I needed a little more water to get the dough to come together initially which sort of ruined a couple of pieces of butter.  Instead of rolling into a baking sheet size I did another fold and roll with whichever little piece I was working on and just kept rolling to the right thickness.  The results were pretty amazing, very light, buttery and flaky with a lovely taste and even brown.  Not quite as good as real puff but a lot easier.  And to be fair where I live the pre-made commercial puff pastry is absolutely disgusting compared to this so I couldn't be happier with this recipe.

It was a mess, as the recipe owner stated. and still a mess after rolling it for a couple of times using the help of a parchment paper; the parts keep falling off and I don't know why. maybe I did something wrong? or is it because I halved the recipe? so I had to roll it for a couple of times until it looked like what a puff pastry dough should be. didn't puff so high but that was still alright. still,it's really time-consuming and not quite worth the effort. i might make it again when im more skilled or whatever.
