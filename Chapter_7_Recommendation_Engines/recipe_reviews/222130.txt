I used melted margerine and "soured" lactose free milk in this recipe. I chose to add the full amount of margerine called for in this recipe in the actual cornbread and make muffins out of them--I just sprayed each muffin cup lightly with non-stick cooking spray. I got 10 cornbread muffins out of one recipe. They looked beautiful but did not rise as much as I would have liked. My family liked this cornbread recipe, but they did spread a small amount of margerine and drizzled a little organic honey over their cut muffins before digging in. I'd make these again.

Just made this again without the corn but with a handful of chopped pepperoncini peppers and it was great! Only needed about 17 minutes of bake time. Will definitely make again and again

Made exactly as stated. I always make the unhealthier Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread from this site and love it. But am trying to be a little healthier so decided to try this. I made the Mexican Chicken Corn Chowder (also from this site and so yummy)and this cornbread. Here is the deal - if you are going to break up this cornbread in your chili, soup, etc. - it's great! But I didn't necessarily like this by itself. But I didn't hate it. Just like the original much better - like I want to eat that all alone! Will make this again though if we are eating with something where we are going to crumble the cornbread into our meal. :-)

My family prefers more savory cornbread so I only added a healthy dash of sugar and I don't think it could have turn out any better.  I was worried that I used instant homemade buttermilk (whole milk and vinegar) would make them taste weird or too dry, but it turned out delicious and stayed moist.  I've already been recruited to make this recipe to use for the Thanksgiving dressing.  I'm really looking forward to that!

I thought This  recipe was great.  I can't say it's 'healthy' , but I will say it is absolutely delicious.  I used sweet corn that a friend of mine canned last year.  I think using a good quality sweet corn that is right off the cob, either fresh, canned, or frozen is key.  Store bought is not going  to be as good.  I did not have enough buttermilk, so I added a couple of  tablespoons of high quality grass fed, cream on top yogurt plus a few tablespoons of the liquid from the corn.  It was very very moist and fresh tasting.

Great recipe, I made this tonight and my husband loved it! No, problems with it at all, I did make a minor change and only used 1/2 cup of sugar, but it was moist, tasty and will definitely make this again.

Tried last night. Smelled and looked great...found it very dry.  Will try using it up with honey instead of butter. I did make according to recipe.  Will not make it again.

I love this recipe.  I'm always looking for ways to make recipes better for us, and this fit the bill (and I didn't have to change it!).  The corn kernels add a nice bite of sweetness instead of sugar, but if you're used to full butter, super sweet cornbread, you might want to have some honey butter ready.  My kids loved it as-is, and it wasn't dry at all.  This would be perfect to top chili.  I'll definitely make it again!
