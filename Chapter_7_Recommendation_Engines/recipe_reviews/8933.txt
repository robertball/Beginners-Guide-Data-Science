Ok. Great dish. Huge hit. I used past reviews to help me out a little: For the stuffing, I used plain feta and added chopped fresh basil and sundried tomatoes. I used about a teaspoon of oil from the sundried tomato jar and mixed it together (left it crumbly, it wasn't a paste). I breaded the chicken on both sides before stuffing it, folding it over and securing with toothpicks. Drizzled olive oil while baking to brown tops of chicken. It was served with angel hair pasta with a sautee of chopped fresh plum tomatoes, onions, garlic, oregano and fresh chopped basil. Perfect side dish. We're having a dinner party next week and my boyfriend requested this on the menu. Other reviews are correct - it's easy and it definitely looks like you've fussed! FYI: Not the greatest as a microwaved leftover.....

This was really good, but I don't understand how anyone could get a good crust with just 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs.  For 3 large chicken breasts, I had to use 1.5 cups breadcrumbs.  As others had suggested, I seasoned plain breadcrumbs with a 1/2 packet of italian salad dressing mix and some garlic powder.  I sprayed the chicken with cooking spray before popping it into the oven.  It helped keep the crust "crusty" during baking. It stayed in the oven for about 35 minutes, and it was soooo tender!!!

This was very good!  Almost 5 stars.  My husband gobbled his up and was eating pieces off my plate. I had to make changes though - the recipe appeared a bit bland as is.  I took others suggestions and added chopped sundried tomatoes to the feta (I used garlic herb feta, its what I had).  After pounding the chicken, I dipped them in egg and then in a mixture of breadcrumbs/locatelli cheese for flavor.  After securing the stuffed chicken with toothpicks, I sauteed the chicken in a bit of olive oil until lightly browned (but not fully cooked).  I was then able to cover and refrigerate the dish until it was ready to go in the oven. (I love dishes that can do this - very essential with young children!) I drizzled a bit of balsamic vinagrette dressing (compliments the feta perfectly!) over each piece right before it went in the oven, and baked for around 40 min.  Results were tender, juicy, (I was worried this would be dry with no sauce, but it wasnt!) and full of flavor.  If you love feta, then you will love this dish!

I got lazy and just cut a pouch into the side of the chicken breasts and stuffed the feta in.  Turned out very well.  A very easy, quick dinner.  Thanks.

Yum! I followed another reviewer's advice and drizzled a tiny amount of butter over the chicken to help brown the crumbs, and then gave it a quick zap under the broiler.  Everyone loved this one, including my two-year-old and my meat-and-potatoes husband. I served it with couscous with a little tomato and cucumber, cilantro, lemon juice and some of the leftover feta.  It's a hit at my house!

As described, this recipe is easy to prepare, quick, reasonably lo-cal, and tasty. That said, it's easy to improve on. Here's what I like to do --  Filling:It's better with good feta, fresh chopped basil, and chopped oil packed sun-dried tomatoes. Instead of folding, roll the filling up as for Chicken Kiev, which it resembles. Dust with flour, roll in egg, then in Japanese Panko bread crumbs. Lightly brown in butter and oil in an oven proof saute pan, then finish in a 350 degree oven.  This version is somewhat more caloric, but much tastier.

This was just awesome! I don't cook chicken in the oven very often, because I always seem to overcook it. But, already having a side dish, I needed something to go with it. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, only cooking two, for 20 min at 350. I used the tomato basil feta, but added some fresh chopped tomatoes as well. I took the advice of others- when it was almost done I drizzled melted margarine over the bread crumbs, added a little parmesan cheese, and browned it for a few minutes. I also used someone else's advice and marinated the chicken in white wine and garlic for a few hours prior to making. It came out perfect! My fiancee loved it as well. As my side dish I used another recipe found here, called Au Gratin Potatoes, but really it's a hashed brown casserole. Together the two were magnificent!

I didn't have tomato-basil feta on hand, just plain feta, sundried tomatoes, and basil.  I combined 3 oz. feta, 1 oz. tomatoes and tsp. dried basil.  I blended this with a fork.  This was for 4 chicken breast halves.  It was awesome!

A nice dish to serve guests.  I drizzled melted butter over the chicken before I put it in the oven, as someone suggested.  This is a versatile recipe.  You could stuff the chicken with sauteed mushrooms and shredded swiss cheese, etc.  You can let your imagination go wild on this recipe!

The recipe was good, but I think would have been better with some other herbs and spices added to enhance the flavor.  I agree, the chicken and the feta was an unexpectedly nice combination.  My guests DID like the chicken, but no raves over this one.  I wish I had taken the suggestions of some of the others who marinated the chicken first--I'd advise anyone thinking about trying this recipe to do that, too.

If you really want this chicken to shine you need to add some more ingredients! 
I added some sharp cheese, fresh tomatoes and chopped garlic to the feta cheese before I rolled it up. Then I put the bread crumbs on the chicken and sprinkle a little feta cheese over the entire pan of chicken.

Now you have amazing taste!

Great recipe! I added some diced roasted red peppers. Next time I'll try olives. I also just put salt, pepper and italian herbs on the inside of the chicken. Sprinkle the bread crumbs on the top of the breasts - don't bother with the bottom as they just get soggy. I sprayed with cooking spray to get a little crispiness and broiled for a minute or two at the end to brown the bread crumbs. Fabulous, easy and great use of feta!

This recipe turned out great.  I used plain fat free feta.  I mixed the cheese with fresh basil, fresh oregano and about 1/3 can of drained petite diced tomatoes.  I stuffed the chicken with the cheese filling and rolled it up with a couple toothpicks and then drenched the chicken roll in egg whites and then in the bread crumbs.  These turned out delicious. I baked them seam side down and they stayed together very nicely.

Excellent Recipe and very delicious!! I served it with Pasta Pomodoro (from this site too). Try browing the chicken after you breaded them it seals them, and the cheese doesn't leak out. Will defintly make again, yummy!!

Fantastic recipe! A new family favorite... I've made it twice in 10 days. Last time I was running late so I didn't even bother to pound out the chicken breasts. I just placed the breasts in a greased baking dish, topped with about 1/2 the container of feta cheese (used garlic/herb), covered with bread crumbs and drizzled with olive oil. Wonderful, moist, delicious... I'll make this again and again!

Great recipe; simple and so VERSATILE! I used plain crumbled feta and sprinkled some oregano over that. Also, I seasoned the chicken w/ salt & pepper. So good & so EASY! I should have pounded mine a little bit thinner though - mine were more like 1/2 inch than 1/4 inch. Next time I'll be sure to pound them properly (so the chicken will be even more tender). I'm also going to try this again w/ricotta cheese inside the chicken and top w/ marinara and mozzarella. Found this gem thanks to DavidP's Summer Bites! list. Thanks DavidP & Debbie.

Yum. I flattened the chicken out and then dipped them in an egg wash. I breaded both sides then added the feta and just a little butter to the center before I rolled them so that when they were cut into it would be moist. It worked and these were delicious!

This recipe was delicious, my girlfriend and I really enjoyed it. Considering I'm 24 and I am very new to cooking this was a great easy meal. I took the advice of others and melted butter on top of the chicken prior to adding the breadcrumbs. The chicken came out very juicy and tasty. Thanks Debbie for the recipe, I will be adding this to the handful of items I can make.

Very good and chicken not dry at all! I followed the other reviewers, mixed plain crumbled feta, fresh chopped basil leaves, chopped sun dried tomat and 1 clove of garlic chopped. Season chicken first with salt, pepper and I added parmasean cheese to the italian bread crumbs. I stuffed the chicken, rolled and used toothpicks to secure, dipped in egg and then rolled in breadcrumbs.  Baked 6 of them at 350 for 40min and half way through I took them out and drizzled olive oil over each one of them.  Keeper!

Have made the recipe twice. First time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and both my husband and I thought it was a bit bland. The next time I decide to use plain feta, roasted red peppers, sun dried tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil. This time it came out amazing. Served with rice, a creamy roasted red pepper sauce and a mixed salad. A great base recipe to work on.

Soak chicken in fresh garlic and white wine for 45 minutes before cooking.  Use Italian bread crumbs.

My husband loves this recipe. I added garlic, basil, and parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs and drizzeled with butter. The butter and parmesan helped it look a little more appealing.

The chicken was so moist and had such a great taste.  I took the others advice and rolled them up and tied them with string.  I also drizzled a little olive oil on the tops ,as suggested, and they came out golden brown.  I can't wait to make it for company!  Very easy to do and looks like you fussed.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is the bomb. I try all kinds of chicken recipes for my dad, and he said this was his most favorite. It's so easy but looks so elegant! For compamy, I have hummus and baba ganoush with pita bread for appetizers, Greek salad, and this recipe with greek-style potatoes and steamed asparagus for the main course!

I was hoping I'd like this, but it really came out too dry, and surprisingly not very flavorful.  I like the technique of just folding the chicken breast in half rather than rolling it and having to secure with toothpicks, but I think I like a more melty cheese inside - next time I'd still use the feta but add some fontina, mozzarella or something like that.  I also think this would have been better with just a drizzle of oil or a few little pats of butter on top to help seal the juices in the chicken.

This was delicious! Being Greek, I love all things Feta. I did make some minor changes. Since all I had was plain feta, I put a cube or two in the chicken, wrapped it and closed it with a toothpick, and then put a little hunts tomato basil sauce over the top. I then baked it as suggested and it came out moist and savory. Prep time was a breeze and so was the cleanup.

5 stars for EASY, Healthy, and AMAZING!  I used light feta (plain) and added fresh basil and sun dried tomatoes - very flavorful. Family members loved it. I served it with angel hair pasta tossed with fresh garlic, basil, lemon and olive oil. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

definitely a good basic preparation with  many possible variations.  i made this tonight but with blue cheese and a little extra sharp  cheddar - turned out really nicely.  I do think a more conventional breading (egg/crumbs, or sauteed first) would taste great, but also add lots of fat so if you are trying to keep it healthy, the "breading" given works fine as well.  I will make it again, and keep experimenting with all sorts of stuffings, etc.

This was great!  Had to use garlic/herb feta, but added fresh basil leaves.  We rolled it and secured w/ toothpicks and it worked great.  Will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the recipe.

I love this recipe!!!  What a way to dress up chicken too!!  Easy and fun to make.  I also would suggest making this like a chicken parm.  With a little homemade sauce and some pasta you think you were eating at a 5 star restaurant.  I did anyway!!!  Thanks for sharing!!!

Excellent. I seasoned my chicken w/ salt, peper and garlic prior to baking. I also used the recommendation of: pound chicken, lightly flour, dip in egg, add filling, roll in bread crumbs ( I used the Panko Japanese breadcrumb) and secure with a tooth pick. I did use the basil and tomato feta but added my own additional fresh basil and sundried tomatoes for extra flavor. EXCELLENT.

I printed out this recipe for my mom to make. It was quick and easy! When I tried it, I thought it was delicious! I love chicken and feta cheese, and they made an absolutely delicious combination! My sister tried it and loved it too. I even gave a little piece to the dog... she loved it as well. It tastes like something you would get at a restaurant. Delicious! A must-try! Thanks for submitting this, Debbie!

Great recipe. However I did make some changes. I decided to nix the bread crumbs and just go for some olive oil to coat the chicken. It was wonderful. All of my guests really enjoyed it.

Been making this dish for years. Love it. Love feta. I dredge both sides in bread crumbs so I use more than the recipe states. Then I place in a sprayed 9 x 13. It makes individual servings much easier. I also drizzle with melted butter, as other have suggested. My original recipe cooks at 400 for 25 minutes.

OK I cant even say I really followed the recipe because I used chicken thighs and even after pounding them they were too small to stuff and fold over so what I did was first, marinated the chicken in itallian dressing for 2 hours, next breaded the chicken in a ziplock bag with bread crums and parmesean cheese, then greased baking pan put chicken on and sprayed cooking oil on the top of the chicken then I placed it in the oven for 30 minutes then added the feta cheese on top of the chicken and some motzerella I had left over from another recipe. Also sprinkled with red pepper. It was great. I will try this again with breasts and try stuffing it. Oh and I also topped with green onion bc thats what I was planning on putting in with the feta cheese.

Great and easy way to make a boring dinner a little more exciting.  I made a couple of very small changes:  I dipped both sides of the chicken in bread crumbs and then put the feta in.  I added spinach b/c I had a lot to use up.  My husband was so impressed with how quickly I made dinner and how wonderful it was.  Will be making this again.

I loved this. I did what several other people did- when I tried to roll it - just didn't work very well afer I had lightly browned both sides in butter with bread crumbs on - so just browned in pan- then transferred to baking dish- and put fresh basil, sundried tomatoes and lots of feta on it. Using the Italian bread crumbs is good- gives more flavor. The feta only melts a tiny bit and it adds that nice saltiness to it. This one's a winner!!!!!

Yummy!!! Made this for dinner tonight (bf LOVED it!). I did modify this to suit our tastes though. Here's what I did: a) instead of spreading 2 T breadcrumbs in the bottom of my baking dish & then sprinkling the remainder over my chx., I comb. 1/4 c. crumbs w/ 1/4 c. grated Parm cheese & coated my 3 chx. breasts  (made 1/2 recipe) liberally w/ the mix.; I then sprinkled what was left on the bottom of my greased baking dish & over my chicken, b) chopped a lg. tomato & comb. it w/ 1.5 T fresh basil, 2 minced garlic cloves, 1/2 T EVOO & 1 T balsamic vinegar; I then topped my chx. breasts w/ the mix. (and remaining feta) during the last 10 min. of baking & c) sprayed ea. chx. breast w/ Pam to ensure even browning (worked very well!). Oh, I had no toothpicks handy, so I took an uncooked spaghetti strand, broke it into 3 pcs. & used them to hold my chx. breasts closed. Oh, & I don't think marinating is necessary (or pan frying), but you can do this if you want to.... I also find that 30 min. isn't enough baking time (mine took 45-50 min.). Be creative. Use a combo of plain feta, fresh basil/tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes or chopped spinach in place of tomato basil feta - anything goes! This pairs nicely w/ sun-dried tomato basil orzo by kgwen (try it!). This will be a reg. w/ me. Thx. for sharing :)

Awesome chicken! My husband, 5yr old, and 2yr old ate it up. Only think different is I used more bread crumbs because I didnt even measure but I think it was a lot, and then sprayed the tops with butter flavored spray. Had to cook maybe 10 mins longer but it was great. I am having another baby in a month and I am going to prepare this again and put it in the freezer.

I hate to review with a changed recipe but I had to try the fresh basil and sundried tomatoes (which I wouldn't have found if someone hadn't put in review :-). I also used garlic herb feta and egg first then bread crumbs with a sprinkle of garlic powder. I had very thick/big chicken breasts so I cut a pocket and stuffed them and had to cook about 45 minutes. 3 men, 1 woman and myself were hugely impressed! Super moist chicken and great flavor! Served with wild rice and sauteed asparagus and onions

I didn't have flavored feta cheese, so I mixed regular feta with sun dried tomato pesto. This added even more flavor.  I drizzled melted butter over the chicken 10 minutes before removing from the oven.  Try to keep all of your chicken breasts the same size so as not to overcook.  Next time I will cover with foil for the first 15-20 minutes.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend, it turned out great!  I used the sun toms that come in a jar, and also fresh basil.  I would recommend using those ingredients.  I also seasoned the chicken after pounding it out with some black pepper, garlic salt, and a dash of italian seasoning. Also followed others reviews by dipping in egg and then drizzling olive oil on top of bread crumbs. Turned out great!  Also when stuffing the chicken, instead of rolling it, I rolled then pinned up sides with a couple of toothpicks (in the shape of chicken kiev).

OMG this is so good!!!!! I made a couple of changes, but only because I didn't have exactly what was called for. 
I used plain feta, and just mixed in some chopped fresh basil, and some chopped sundried tomatoes. 
I also didn't have Italian-style bread crumbs, so I used plain and added a sprikle of each of the following: garlic powder, thyme, basil, oregano and parsley.
I couldn't be bothered to pound out the chicken - I just made a slit in the middle, added the filling, and used toothpicks to pin the edges together before dipping in egg and then the bread crumb mixture.

Tweaked this to perfection! Cooked this exactly like I do our shake and bakes. After pounding the chicken out, threw the bread crumbs and some extra itlian seasonings into a ziplock and coated the chicken. Then folded in the feta. Topped with some olive oil and cooked at 400* for 20-25 mins (keeps the chicken moist while getting cooked all the way through), if bone-in try 40-45 mins. Served over Fettucini Alfredo for some added flavor. Will make again, may add sun-dried tomatoes next time.

At the recommendation of a friend who made this I added a slice of tomato and a couple spinach leaves on top of the feta before folding the chicken over.  I also sprayed top of chicken with cooking spray before baking - Wonderful - the whole family loved it.

This looked and sounded really good, but when I took my first bite I was really disappointed.  The feta didn't  melt very well in the middle.  I don't think the cooking time was long enough either.  If I try this again, I'll bake the chicken longer and maybe try a different brand of feta cheese.

Whenever I read a recipe similar to this one I ask myself "Where's the sauce?". I decided to make this and see what happened without a sauce. Toward the end of cooking I could see that the chicken had the potential of being dry, so I added a little white wine to the pan. That did the trick. Just enough liquid to make the chicken breasts moist and tasty. Will make again with the addition of wine or something else to add some moisture.

I have to say I agree with the other reviewers: this is a great base recipe.  I combined 4oz lemon herb feta, with 6 sun dried tomatoes in oil, 6 calamata olives, and 3 cloves of garlic in the food processor.  After stuffing the chicken with the cheese mixture, rolling it, and skewering it with toothpicks, I dipped it in egg beaters, flour (seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion flakes), and Italian Shake-n-Bake.  I then baked it on 350 for about 35 minutes and served it with couscous, steamed broccoli, and french bread.  I had some worry that the feta would seep out during the cooking process, but it didn't and the chicken was delicious.  I will definitely make this again.

I was expecting an amazing dish based on the reviews, but I did not get it! While it wasn't horrible, I wouldn't make it again and I even used reader suggestions like using flavoured breadcrumbs, added olives and sundried tomatoes to the mix and sprayed the top of the chicken with a bit of PAM to assist with browning. I found this dish lacked flavour and leftovers were not all that great.

VERY DELICIOUS!! I made this for my Dad who I don't see too often and we both LOVED it! I followed the recipe closely except for the folding bit. Instead I rolled it up and stuck a toothpick in it to hold it together. I believe this made the chicken stay moist. A very good base recipe I do  plan on cooking this again and adding my own twists!!

Also served it with Pasta Pomodoro, EXCELLENT!!

This was soooo good and sooo simple!  My husband is doing south beach, so instead of bread crumbs I ground up some almonds and rolled the chicken in that instead and sprayed a couple sprays of "I Can't believe it's Not Butter" on top and it was still great!   I have made it the original way as well, and this always tastes great!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've experimented several times with this recipe, and no matter how you do it- it's great! My personal favorite is rolling the chicken around the feta, then rolling it in egg, then rolling it in the bread crumbs or butter cracker crumbs. I think this gives a better coverage of crust. I also like adding spinach, kalamata olives, sun dried tomatoes... this always impresses guests and my husband!

I crumbled good feta and then added a sundried tomato, basil and garlic salad dressing to it to make a sort of paste.  Then I pounded the breasts very flat and rolled the paste inside. Instead of bread crumbs I rolled them in Shake and Bake and cooked for the recommnded heat and time.  It was easy and tasty and my guests loved it.

This was really yummy.  My husband was wary of the feta, but we both enjoyed it.  I used fresh basil, sundried tomatoes and plain feta as someone recommended - very good.

Very good...would recommend rolling the chicken as others have suggested; secure with toothpicks if necessary to keep the filling in. The tomato/basil feta was really nice in this; I thought it would be too much, flavor-wise, but they complemented the chicken quite well.

Absolutely great chicken recipe.  The only change I made was to properly bread the chicken (coat with flour, dip in egg or egg white, and then coat with the bread crumbs).  I cooked the chicken on a frying pan sprayed with a bit of Pam for a few minutes on each side before putting on the Feta and folding the chicken.

I did not have flavored feta on hand so I sprinkled my plain feta with dried basil. I also only had plain bread crumbs so I seasoned them with Italian seasoning and garlic powder. Once I got the hang of flattening out my chicken this was a very fast and easy recipe. My husband loved it and I thought it was very good too. We will definitely be having this again.

Recipe as stated would be boring and the feta flavor overpowering... but with alterations as other people have suggested to increase the flavor they were very good!

I quite liked this. It was easy, relatively healthy, and tasty. Changes I made based on others reviews:  1. Added fresh chopped basil to the feta (even though it was sundried tomato and basil feta) 2. Brushed the chicken with butter, then dragged in bread crumbs 3. When it was pretty much done, I added one tablespoon of pasta sauce on top and a bit of grated mozza, then baked about 5 mins on broil until the cheese bubbled.  I would do it this way again. Next time, I would probably use less feta; it was a bit feta-heavy for my tastes, but that might be because I just stuffed in as much as I could fit into a pocket in the breast.  Overall, a good recipe for company, I'd say!

Great recipe.  I use panko  bread crumbs and tomato basil feta.  I just sprinkle the bread crumbs to cover the bottom of the baking dish, add chicken (skipping the stuffing and pounding), sprinkle the feta on top of the chicken then sprinkle a little more bread crumbs and bake.  SAME taste with LESS WORK!  Our  kids L O V E this recipe!

I had feta and sun-dried tomatoes in the house, but not the feta with the tomatoes and basil so I made my own.  After pounding out the chicken I seasoned it with salt, pepper and lemon juice.  Place a tablespoon on feta in the middle, a bit of sun-dried tomatoes, a dash of dried basil,a bit of minced garlic, and finally 1/2 teaspoon of light margarine.  I rolled the breast up into a tight bundle, rolled the whole thing in bread crumbs, topped with a bit more light margarine, baked for 25 minutes and then broiled for a couple of minutes to give it a bit more color.  My wife and I were very pleased with this dish and it was quite low in calories.

I changed this recipe a lot, and it was pretty good.  I used italian seasonings and italian salad dressing on the bread crumbs, and also drizzled olive oil on the chicken. I didn't have tomato-basil feta, and I actually had some pesto on hand so I stuffed the chicken with both pesto and feta.  I served the chicken on a bed of sauteed red peppers, onions, and grape tomatoes, seasoned with italian seasoning and garlic.  It was tasty, and I'd probably make it again... with all of those changes!  The one thing I'd advise anyone is to make sure you put enough feta in... I definitely didn't.

I cook a lot with feta because I love it.  This was good but very average.  I think it is a good base recipe and could be added too but at is it is rather plain.  The bread crumbs absolutely need a liquid agent such as butter or olive oil otherwise they don't crisp

I've made this twice now. I think it's easier to place the chicken in a ziploc for pounding (keeps the counter cleaner and prevents splattering). The 1st time I used plain feta and added dried basil and finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes. I also rolled the chicken in the bread crumbs (didn't measure). To help crispify (yea, I made that word up ;-) ) the breading, I sprayed with olive oil before baking. The 2nd time I used the pre-seasoned feta, and added panko crumbs to the bread crumbs (and sprayed). I liked this method better. Less time prepping, crunchier crust. I've served over pasta, and Greek salad. Great both ways.

This was fantastic!  I followed others advice on the stuffing.  For my picky preschooler's piece - I stuffed it with one of her string cheese sticks instead of feta and she loved it.  It was great because my husband and I got to enjoy our "adult" version and my preschooler got to enjoy her "kid" version!

This is an excellent, very easy recipe. I used plain feta and sun dried tomatoes out of the jar. I used far more than the recipe called for. I don't think the recipe uses nearly enough. Then again, I really like feta. I also secured the rolled chicken breasts with toothpicks. They cooked perfectly in the allotted time and looked really pretty. This is a great meal to serve to guests. It can be made ahead and popped in the oven right before dinner. Will definitely make again.

This was a great change for chicken.  I used regular feta and crushed butter crackers in place of bread crumbs.  The crackers i seasoned with salt, pepper, and a Greek seasoning.  My husband who can't get enough feta (Greek as he is) loved it.  The only thing I might do next time is marinate the chicken in a Greek dressing to go with the theme and give the chicken a little more flavor.

We really enjoyed this dish! I  have stuffed chicken many ways but had not thought of feta cheese. I dip the chicken in egg before rolling in Italian bread crumbs and sprinkle the dish with oregano and drizzled with a small amount of olive oil.  I served it with rice pilaf and steamed asparagus!  This will become a favorite!

It was good.  A new and easy way to jazz up chicken.  I also had a few strips of chicken I just laid in the pan and put the cheese on top and then bread crumbs on top of the cheese. The chicken strips were just as good or better than the chicken.  Why roll it when you can bake it flat!!

I would give this chicken 5 stars with my additions. I mixed together some chopped fresh basil leaves, feta cheese and a few tablespoons of jarred bruschetta topping. The bruschetta topping has mostly sundried tomatoes and some onions and seasonings. I had planned to just use sundried tomatoes, but found this instead and it was a better price. I used the plan feta since I was adding all of these fresh ingredients. Next I pounded the chicken, filled them with cheese mixture, and rolled them, connecting with a toothpick. Lastly I rolled in an egg and water mixture, then in seasoned crumbs and baked. I had to bake about 10 minutes longer than the recipe states. Came out perfect! I served with rotini noodles and fresh spaghetti sauce, and a salad. YUM!

This chicken meal was wonderful.  Very easy to make too.  I did however make some changes to the recipe.  I used regular feta and made a pocket in the chicken breast and stuffed it and wrapped it in 2 pieces of bacon...sprinkled bread crumbs on top and the bottom on chicken.  Very good!!!  Will make this again and again.

This was great!  I simply cut a pocket into the chicken and stuffed regular feta in there (I am LAZY sometimes!).  Then I secured with toothpicks, ran the breasts through an egg wash, rolled in breadcrumbs and browned them on top of the stove in an ovenproof pan.  Once they were browned, I popped them into the oven until they were done.  YUM!  We had them over tortellini and vodka sauce.  Delish!  Thanks for this great recipe!

My husband loved this one and I thought it was very good. I did not use crumbled tomato-basil feta, had the block type which I sliced to fit the pounded chicken breasts. Like other reviewers, I dipped the chicken in beaten egg, then Panko, and drizzled with butter before baking. The chicken took about 40 minutes. Definitely will make this one again and might add some sundried tomatoes.

was great, tweeked it a bit.  rinsed chicken and marinated in EVOO and balsamic while mixing plain feta with fresh basil, garlic and sun dried tomatoes. pounded chicken, spread with feta mixture, rolled and put slice of proscuitto around chicken. Added flavor and kept chicken together.  put in fridge until ready to bake.  sprinkled with EVOO and baked. very tasty and moist. Leftovers where just as good, maybe better. thank you Debbie!

Not bad at all, I used a big chunk of fresh mozz, and leaves of fresh basil. Next time I will marinate the chicken in italian dressing first, becuase they were a little dry.

My high hopes were dashed with one bite of this dish.  My husband didn't even finish his!  It's quite bland, so if you attempt it, flavor it with something (garlic, lemon pepper, or something)!

Great recipe when you want something different.  I also used fresh basil and chopped up a small roma tomato and mixed it into the feta cheese.  Quick and easy recipe.

My husband and I really liked this dish. I added a 4.5 oz can of sliced black olives to the feta. The olives added a bit more flavor.

This recipe was so easy and SO wonderful. It took me about 5-10 minutes to prep, throw it in the oven and mmmmm. My husband loved it. The tomato basil feta was great and there are so many other flavors too, next time maybe I will try the garlic herb feta, just to try. Definitely recommend this recipe! Thanks Debbie!

I took one reviewer's advice and whirled the feta, fresh basil leaves, parmesan cheese and bread crumbs in a food processor, and I also put fresh tomato slices in with the stuffing before baking. I also made the assembly easier by pounding the breasts, laying the stuffing on one breast, and piling another breast on top.  Then, when it was done, I just cut individual portions.  YUM!

This is a good base recipe. I marinated the chicken breasts in a balsamic vinegar/Greek marinade, and combined the feta and bread crumbs in a food processor with garlic, basil and a little parmesan to make a "stuffing". Definitely a hit! I'll be making it again & again....Served with a light pasta salad and bread.

WOW- how can something so simple be so good? I guess because I love Feta cheese!!! I don't understand the point of putting bread crumbs in the bottom of the dish- might just roll the chicken in the crumbs next time. ? My chicken pieces could only hold about 1/2 oz of the feta. I cooked for 35 minutes to make sure the chicken was done. Low carb,low cal... & delicious! Great idea!!! OH - I find using Saran wrap works better than wax paper for pounding.

So easy and tastes so good!  Made it for a large family gathering, accidently pounded the chicken too thin so it was a bit dry.  Made it again correctly and it was perfect!

simply divine! I made this with boneless chicken breasts and with chicken leggt quarters. The recipe seemed more flavorful with the quarters (stuffed feta and fresh basil leaves chopped up under skin) than boneless but the boneless breat version provides more meat, easier to eat etc. The fresh basil jazzed the chicken up. I used Tollhouse crackers to coat the outside as another reviewer suggested. I served with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans/ when I reheated a leftover breat in the microwave for a quick meal I served over spinach, basil, and balsalmic vinegar. Reheated nicely and just as yummy. Thanks.

This was really good. I used garlic/herb bread crumbs instead. I also drizzled the chicken with olive oil and put pasta sauce in the bottom of the dish. Even my picky fiance liked it. It was very easy too. I will definitely make this again!

Yummy! I only had plain feta so I added a little bit of chopped tomato, fresh garlic, and spices to the feta before I used it.  I also wasn't sure what "Italian Style Bread Crumbs" were, and I didn't have regular bread crumbs, so I ground up butter crackers and they worked wonders!  Simple and delicious recipe. I made modifications to 2 of the 3 ingredients, but this sure deserves 5 stars!  Thanks for sharing this easy recipe.

Easy and great-tasting recipe!! As other reviewers had suggested, I rolled them up and secured with a toothpick. After sprinkling with bread crumbs, I sprayed rolls with cooking spray to promote browning.I used feta cheese that had tomato, basil and black olives in it. I might experiment with other flavors of feta.

Delicious!  This was really flavorful and delicious.  I didnt have the special feta, so I used plain and then added dried basil and some tomato sauce.  I also substituted the breadcrumbs for some toasted bread crumbs with basil, parsley, and oregano.  Really flavorful!

I mixed the breadcrumbs with garlic powder and greek all-purpose seasoning... definitely drizzle with olive oil to brown the breadcrumbs! I chopped FRESH basil and used sundried tomatoes packed in oil (blot first of course) for a wonderfully fresh flavour!

No one in my house cared for this chicken.  I think I may have over cooked it because it was not juicy at all.  Also, since making this I have decided that I do not care for Feta.  Thanks for the recipe though.

This recipe was so easy that I couldn't believe how delicious the results were!  My boyfriend says it's the best thing I have ever cooked and he is still talking about it several days later!  I used the suggestion of some of the other reviewers and used plain feta, sundried tomato paste and fresh basil.  It was fantastically delicious!

What a yummy recipe!  I have made this twice, once with chicken, and once with boneless porkchops.  Both were delicious!  I used different flavored fetas, and enjoyed them both.  Thanks for the recipe!

What a great recipe--tastes great, takes no time at all and involves only three ingredients.  Does it get any better than this?  Only one suggestion, as others have said, it needed to be drizzled w/butter on top so it would brown.  Otherwise pretty bland looking.  Thanks Debbie

This was good, but not really great. It was extremely easy and fast, which is a plus, but I don't want to eat it every night. Maybe twice a month.

Excellent!..and so simple too!  My husband emailed me today requesting it for dinner tonight.  I just had plain feta so I chopped up some sun dried tomatoes and mixed in some basil. Yummy!  It tastes like something that you spent hours on when it takes less than 10 minutes to prepare.

Delicious.  I added greek seasonings to the chicken.  I also used already prepared feta,rosemary and basil cheese - crumbled and ready in the unique cheese section of the grocery store by the deli.  Very easy to put together.  Once cooked, I put lemon juice on the chicken and served with cous-cous and pepper salad.  Very yummy!

This was incredible!!!  Such an easy dish, but the taste was so sophisticated.  I served mine with a side of pasta with pesto sauce and sweet and tart strawberry salad, which you can find on allrecipes.com.  The mix of the flavors resulted in compliments to the cook from all around... and it only took a couple of minutes to prepare!

Very easy to prepare for a tasty weeknight meal, but pretty enough to serve to guests.  I used plain feta and added sun dried tomatoes and fresh basil, then drizzled oil from the sun dried tomatoes on top.  So good!

I didn't have tomato basil feta, just plain feta. I added 2 chopped cloves of garlic and pesto seasoning to the feta. I followed the other cooks suggestions. I brushed melted butter on the inside of the chicken then sprinkled the feta cheese mixture before rolling it up. Rolled in Italian bread crumbs then drizzled the rest of the melted butter on top. Tasted great and served it with brown butter with Mizithra cheese and spaghetti. Thanks!

Not many recipes with so few ingredients!  That said, I had to make some substitutions since I did not have exact ingredients on hand.  I placed plain feta, fresh basil (chiffonade), and a smear of tomato paste in each pounded breast.  I added no-salt garlic and herb seasoning to plain bread crumbs and sprayed the top of the breaded chicken with cooking spray before baking to crisp it up.  Easy and delicious.

I wanted to like this recipe as I love chicken and I love feta but mine turned out just to bland and I added extra seasonings after reading some of the other reviews. If I try it again I will increase the seasonings even more than I did. Chances are I won't try it again.

I found that using sundried tomato pesto, regular feta, and turkey bacon bits in the center was delicious. I also drizzled balsamic over the tops before baking and added sauteed mushrooms over the top after baking; (sauteed in butter, oil, garlic, and balsamic). Was delicious.

I gave this five stars because it was really simple and delicious. I didn't pound my chicken thin enough so it took a little longer to cook. I served it with brown rice. Next time will add a vegetable, maybe broccoli. No need to make any drastic changes. It is good and healhty as is.

This was very good! Instead of the flavored feta, I used an 8-oz block of feta that I crumbled, one 2-ounce pack of sun-dried tomatoes (chopped) and 2 tablespoons of fresh chopped basil. I breaded the chicken on both sides and then stuffed it. I served this over angel hair pasta with "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" from this site. Will make again!

ive been making this for about a year now and have tried stuffing it with all different things. The best i think is using feta cheese(regular not basil) and go heavy, dried cranberries, choped green onions, sundried tomatos, sprinkle of basel and garlic powder, and bacon. Last time was the first time i used bacon and it was fanominal. My husband just about died (and me too) when taking that 1st bit and every bit after was just as enjoyable. Its one of those things where your stuffed but you just cant stop eating it because its sooo good. Deffinently give this a try

Excellent. Tasty, polished looking, and very hearty. I added some additional fresh chopped basil to the feta mixture, but othewise followed the original recipe. A keeper!

I can't believe I didn't rate this before.  I have made this numerous times and turns out perfectly and delicious each time.  What a quick dinner to make with riasted potatoes and side salad! Thanks for sharing!

I made this chicken with feta, minced black olives, and fresh parsley (for the filling). I also pounded the chicken thin and rolled it up around the filling. DELICIOUS! I am so pleased with the results, I plan to make it again and vary the filling with garlic and tomatoes. I also sprinkled with panko bread crumbs before baking.

Easy to do, particularly if you buy chicken cutlets, which don't need to be pounded. A nice quick meal. Thanks!

YUM! I really liked this recipe! However, mine would have to be called Blue Cheese chicken because I didn't have Feta =). I took the advice of other posters and added fresh chopped basil and some of the jarred sun dried tomatoes...I don't know who was the first to suggest the fresh basil and sun dried tomatoes but BRAVO! Great flavor! I wanted to marinate my chicken in Robusto Italian Dressing but forgot so I poured the dressing over the chicken after I rolled the cheese mixture in it...then I sprinkled bread crumbs over it...YUMMY! I will definitely make this again!  I can't wait to try it with Feta cheese!

This is a good easy dinner that I have made a few times already. I buy the thin sliced chicken breast to save time/mess on pounding chicken thin. It makes smaller pieces so expect 2 per person. I also add chopped sundried tomato's to the feta.

Very good chicken dish. My husband who hates chicken actually asked me to make this again. 

I didn't really follow the recommended amounts, I just eyed it. I followed the other comments and used regular (reduced fat) feta and fresh basil and sun-dried tomatoes. 

I breaded the chicken on both sides but used egg beaters instead of olive oil to bread and added garlic salt to the bread crumbs.

Very moist.

I am surprised by all the high ratings this one got. I followed the recipie exactly and my family found this very flavorless. We love chicken and feta so I thought this one was going to be a hit, but not 1 member of my family of 5 ate the whole thing piece.  Sorry...

What an awesome recipe. After reading some of the reviews, I made a few changes - to the tomato basil feta, I added 2 tbsp of fresh, chopped basil and 1 large clove of minced garlic. I made a pocket in the chicken and tucked in the feta mixture securing with a toothpick. Then I rolled the chicken in breadcrumbs. Since I didn't have seasoned breadcrumbs, I just added some Italian herbs to plain crumbs. As it was a hot night, I cooked the chicken on a sheet on the barbeque - drizzling a scant tsp of olive oil on each chicken breast before cooking. Very moist and tasty.

This was very good. I modified the recipe by using Mediterranean Crumbles (mozzarella, feta, and provolone cheese) and seasoning the chicken with garlic, basil, and some crushed red pepper. I served the chicken with angel hair pasta and it was delicious! My roommates loved it.

I thought this recipe was pretty good. My husband had seconds :-) I think it needs some olive oil to keep it from drying out. I cooked it for 26 minutes and it was pretty rubbery. I did use regular feta and diced tomatoes with dried basil because that's the only feta I had.

Would use less feta next time (husband thought the cheese was overwhelming.  Added parmesan to the breadcrumbs (layed the chicken over the top of breadcrumbs to coat).

I didn't have tomato basil feta, so I used plain feta and added some extra spices to it.  I don't have a meat mallet so I slit the breasts open and stuffed them with the filling.  I also think after sprinkling the bread crumbs on top you should drizzle some melted butter or even a little olive oil on top so the bread crumbs just aren't "dry".
I make a lot of stuffed chicken breast in so many different ways, you really can't screw it up, just put in what you like basically, these recipes are very forgiving.

Update 5-2-2007 Oh my I think I fixed this to perfect! So I didn't have enough of the feta so I mixed it with about 2 tbsp of ricotta cheese. I also sprayed the top of the chicken with cooking spray. It browned up more was less dry and was exactly what the chicken needed. Though I served with some couscous we didn't really like. Still trying to find the perfect side dish for a non-veggie eating BF :( 1-25-2007 This was easy and good! I think it needs a little something else. I don't know exactly what. I served with spaghetti with red sauce so it had a lot of flavor. Probably make again.

My family and I liked this (even 2 picky boys), but it took alot longer than I expected to cook.  I guess I didn't pound the breasts flat enough because it had to cook an extra 30 minutes.  The taste was good and I followed the recipe exact.  Maybe next time I make this I will follow the advice of others and roll in egg first then in the bread crumbs.  Otherwise, very tasty!  Thank You!

I'm not sure I pounded the chicken thin enough and I used tomato, basil, and feta because I didn't have the tomato basil feta. It was okay, but I'm giving it five stars because I think if I had made it properly and used the tomato basil feta I would've liked it a lot better. My husband did love it!

My family used to hate "guinea pig night" where I try out strange sounding recipes.  Somehow, I can just taste the recipe in my mind and I just new this one would work out great!  And guess what....  My husband and his work helper really liked this meal!

Warning - 25-30 min at 375F is not long enough (breasts are not cooked).  I would suggest cooking for at least 45min.

This was easy to make and tasted incredible!  As a college student, I modified the recipe to fit what was available.  I marinated the chicken in balsalmic vinegar for two hours before cooking.  I also used regular feta, and butterflied the chicken instead of thinning it out with a rolling pin.  I then put the feta, some fresh basil, and 2 strips of bacon inside the chicken before folding it over like an omlette to bake.  My boyfriend said it looked wonderful and tasted even better.

This was a pretty good recipe. I definitely recommend dipping in egg before coating with breadcrumbs. I loved the taste of the feta, but in the bites with no feta, I felt like something was missing. Serves well with pasta and marinara sauce.

wow!!! FANTASTIC!!! after reading other reviews, i melted 2 Tbls. butter in my baking dish before placing chicken in it.  also, i did dip in egg beaters and then bread crumbs but folding the chicken was easy.  my husband and i found the chicken to be very moist and full of flavor.  i did bake chicken for about 45 minutes.  will make again!!!

I only had regular feta cheese so I added 2 tbsp of tomato paste and some fresh chopped basil and mixed it into the feta. This was a hit with the family! My husband asked me to make it again and said that his co-workers asked where he got it (meaning a restaurant) and he was happy to say I made it! So easy too! Thanks a bunch!

My Wife and I are not real big on cheeses outside of the normal american, swiss, cheddar.... so we were a little shaky on trying this recipe.  Wow, were we wrong!  It turned out great!  We will definitely have this again but maybe with the addition of a white sauce of some sort.

This chicken was great! I was worried by all of the reviews stating that it was bland, but this was FAR from bland.  I think that it helps if you used the tomato basil feta that it calls for. Our Wal-Mart Supercenter had it (Athenos brand) and the flavor was really absorbed into the chicken itself. I'm not even a big feta fan, but it was great. I also dipped the rolls in egg before rolling in bread crumbs. YUM!

After adding birds-eye chiles and mushrooms I give it a 4.  It was very bland with just the feta.  Thanks for the recipe.

wonderful flavor but I used fresh basil and tomatoes mixed with plain feta - also added some freshly ground pepper to the chesse mix - I like my chicken really well done, so increased the cooking time as well

A great basic recipe.  I made quite a few changes by adding extras to spice things up.  I will definitely keep making variations since I think it would be hard to mess up this recipe. The whole family enjoyed.  Thanks!

Very good, simple recipe!  I made this tonight for my husband and I along with pasta pomodoro and beautiful salad, both from this site.  I gave the other two recipes 5 stars, but this wasn't quite as good.  We liked it, but it was outshone by the other.  It seemed a bit basic, but easy enough to throw together for a weeknight.  I did marinate the chicken in a balsamic vinagrette dressing first, which definitely added flavor, but I found the italian bread crumb coating a bit bland.  Overall though, certainly worth a try.  Drizzle with olive oil before baking to help the top crisp up a bit.

I thought this was a good recipe and very quick/easy.  I used plain bread crumbs and added garlic powder, oregano, basil, and black pepper.  After folding the chicken, I secured each piece with a toothpick, dipped in beaten egg and rolled in the crumbs.  I didn't bother with sprinkling crumbs in my baking dish.  Turned out great after some additional cook time.  Like some of the other reviewers, I think it would be fun to experiment with add ins to the feta next time.  This was easy enough for a week night but could be jazzed up to serve guests.

This recipe is superb. I took previous advice which made it more complicated, but it was worth it. Pound, add specified feta, roll and secure w/ toothpicks.  Dip in egg and roll in breadcrumbs sprinkled w/ garlic powder. Bake.

Delicious! I added fresh tomato and dried basil then coated the outside of the chicken in the breadcrumbs instead of lining the pan and then sprinkling the leftover on the chicken. I will surely make this again, maybe with some sort of marinara sauce.

Two words - ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  I added chopped sun dried tomatoes, and two cloves of chopped garlic to the cheese and arranged thawed spinach around the chicken in the baking dish.  Everything came out great!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is getting 3 stars because I found out my husband does not like feta.  I love feta.  I found this to be an OK recipe but nothing outstanding.  I used low fat tomato-basil feta.  So I won't be making this again, unfortunately.

This is good, but needs a little more.  Possibly topping the chicken with a tomato and fresh basil for the last 5 min of cook time is a suggestion.

This recipe was extremely easy and very tasty. We love feta cheese so I welcome any chance to use it in cooking. My husband is not a fan of tomatoes so I made some with sun-dried tomatoes for myself and some without for him. This recipe was a success and I will use it again.

This was really easy to make and tasted great.  My son ate all of his dinner for once.  Only drawback was later on, when it came back to haunt us.  Will probably make again, especially if we're not going anywhere later on!!

Really good! I dipped the chicken in a little butter before putting on the bread crumbs. I added about half of package of dry Italian dressing in with the bread crumbs which gave it a really nice taste! I also added some olives I had on top under the feta and added a little bit of Parmesan cheese. Yum!!

I am new to cooking and this was so easy for me. I LOVE chicken and feta cheese, so this was a dream come true! I think I ended up baking closer to 35 mins just because I was paranoid about cooking the chicken all the way through (since it was folded over and thick). But it was still perfectly juicy and flavorful. If anything, I would have added a little more cheese!

I accidentally bought Tomato-Basil goat cheese instead of feta, so I guess what I made was NOT Feta Chicken, but either way this was an easy and tasty recipe for a busy work night.

Very good and my picky husband liked it too. I sprinkled some garlic powder and drizzled butter on top. Next time might serve with some seasoned tomatoe sauce.

Made this last night and it turned out amazing! The chicken was super moist and flavorful. I made a few changes as noted by others. For the chicken filling, I used basil tomato feta cheese with fresh chopped basil & sun-dried tomatoes (in oil). Before I stuffed the chicken I dipped them in an egg wash and then coated with panko bread crumbs. Stuffed the chicken, folded over, and placed in baking dish. Drizzled olive oil over the chicken and added more bread crumbs and cracked pepper. My chicken needed about 35 minutes at 350. Served with a side of asparagus and rosemary bread. Delicious!

Yummy.  Went over well with all the kids.  My chicken breasts were very fat that it would have been quite a chore to pound them out, not to mention they would have been gigantic.  Instead I cut horizontally through the middle, butterflied, I guess is what you could say.  I only had plain feta, so I added basil and some very small diced tomatoes.  This alone smelled amazing, so I knew I was in for a good dish.  I didn't bother with the bread crumbs on the bottom, just sprinkled on top.  I tried the tip of one reviewer to spray with Pam to make it crisp, but this didn't really work for me.  Next time I will try the butter drizzle that so many reviewers mentioned.

Great taste, and really easy. I added fresh spinach as well, and also wrapped the chicken breast in partially cooked bacon. Gave a bit of extra great flavor, and also kept the chicken super moist! Will Make again.

I made this the other night.  The family liked it.  Made a small addition...I put fresh spinach on top of the feta before I foded the breast in half.  I kind of rolled the breast up and secured it with toothpicks.  I think this chicken needs a sauce...something simple like a little garlic butter on top for moisture.

The chicken is delicious!! I added spinach to the stuffing and used chicken breast tenderloins instead, I also put melted butter on the one side of the chicken for the bread crumbs so it holds better. Great taste, easy and fast!!

Just made this and it's delicious!  Used regular feta as that's what I had on hand. I added chopped kalamata olives, tomatoes, basil, garlic powder and a little olive oil to the feta filling.   And as per other reviewers recommendation I coated the chicken in egg and then breaded the whole thing then added filling, spraying it will olive oil cooking spray prior to cooking. Used toothpicks to keep it closed. Added parmesan cheese, and cayenne pepper to the breadcrumbs. Wow, so good, thanks for sharing!

Read the other reviews and made a couple of changes based on what I had on hand. Used crushed seasoned croutons because I didn't have any bread crumbs. I used regular feta and added basil and sundried tomatoes. Pounded the breasts flat, added the feta, and rolled in the crushed croutons. Drizzled a little EVOO and baked for about 35 minutes. Delish! Definitely a keeper.

Really good,easy recipe! I used 5 whole boneless,skinless breasts which I just cut open length wise using a sharp knife. I stuffed in the crumbled feta..just eye balling it and rolled the chicken in the Italian breadcrumbs. I sprinkled a little Romano cheese over them then sprayed them with cooking spray. They were crunchy outside,tender and juicy inside and so very delicious.

This dish was a hit! I added a few things..For the stuffing mixture I did fresh feta,sun-dried tomatos,fresh basil and chopped red onion. Then breaded it with bread crums and chopped walnuts. It made the outside very crunchy! And served it with garlic mashed pot's! yummy

Great recipe & very easy to do.  I added spinach into the "stuffing" to give it some extra vitamins. I used whole sun dried tomatoes and fresh basil. I served the chicken with bowtie pasta in a light fresh tomato sauce & broccoli, but still searching for that complimentary side for this dish. Per some of the recommendations, I drizzled melted butter on the top of the chicken before I popped it in the oven. Definitely use more breadcrumbs than the recipes states. VERY delicious & tender, & will make again :)

This was a very quick and simple recipe!  I made the recipe as stated with the following changes: I sprinkled Melting Pot's wine and garlic seasoning on the chicken breasts, I cut "pockets" into the chicken breats to stuff it with the cheese, I dipped the stuffed chicken into eggs and then rolled in the breadcrumbs.  Tasted Great!

Awesome recipe. I copied others advise and added fresh basil to the tomato basil feta as well as breaded both sides of the chicken before stuffing it. I think adding more basil and sundried tomatoes would make it even better but it was awesome just like it was. I also copied the side dish someone else posted: angel hair pasta with a sautee of chopped fresh plum tomatoes, onions, garlic, oregano and fresh chopped basil. She was right, it was the perfect side dish. Great dinner and very easy!

Extremely simple!  I only had plain feta, so I improvised and made my own flavored feta by pulsing sundried tomato pesto, basil leaves, and feta together in the food processor until combined.  I also breaded the chicken breasts on both sides by tossing the bread crumbs and chicken in a bag and coating it that way.  Much simpler than sprinkling on bread crumbs, which I'm never good at anyway.  Chicken needed 40 min, not 30 min, but maybe my chicken was thicker.  Thanks for the recipe!  So very easy, and I thought it reheated just fine in the microwave.

YUMMMY!  My whole family loved it!!!  I made a slight change to the recipe because I did not have feta with basil.  I mixed sundried tomatoes packed in olive oil, fresh basil, and garlic powder to regular feta cheese.  Delicious!  This will be a family favorite!

This was very yummy for the more mature palates in our family. The younguns' weren't fans of the feta. Here's my changes: Added minced garlic to the feta, dipped rolled & secured breasts in eggs then breadcrumbs (added parmesan to breadscrumbs) then drizzled butter over breasts last 10 minutes of cooking. Mmm mmm good! Looks and tastes fancy but VERY easy and fast! Will make this again!

I tried this recipe to see if I might want to make it for a dinner party. I did not care for it much. It was really easy to make and I was excited about the feta in the middle of the chicken, but I just didn't like the way it turned out. The breadcrumbs on top and bottom just make it too dry. I don't think I'll be trying this one again. Sorry.

I made it two days ago exactly as the recipe stated and it was mouth wateringly delicious!  I plan on making it again tonight.  After reading all the reviews, I thought that I had made a mistake by buying the feta with sundried tomatoes (as called for in the recipe) instead of buying fresh basil, sun-dried tomatoes and plain feta cheese.  However, I think the results are spectacular.  I'm sure it is slightly better with fresh ingredients but I can't imagine that it is worth the extra cost and effort.  This simple recipe is definitely going to be a favorite in my household.

This was a good recipe.  I made a few changes.  I added two cloves of minced garlic and some snipped fresh basil to the tomato basil feta cheese.  Instead of pounding the chicken, I butterflied it to make a pocket, stuffed the chicken with the feta mixture, and then dipped the chicken in egg, and in a mixture of seasoned bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.  I drizzled about one tablespoon of melted butter over the top, and baked as directed in the recipe.  My family thought it was good and I will likely make it again!

Made with regular feta, but added garlic, Italian spices and a smidgen of havarti to make it more creamy.  Very good, but I think sun dried tomatoes would make it better.

Easy and delicious recipe! I sprayed the tops of the chicken to brown the crumbs. It is easy to change the flavor of this recipe by varying the flavor of the feta cheese. Thanks for the great recipe!

Considering the ease of preparation, this recipe is good.  I bought thin cutlets on sale to avoid having to pound them.  I also dipped in egg and breadcrumb ahead of time, then put crumbled tomato basil feta on one side, folded in half and secured with toothpick when I was ready to bake. I put a little butter and garlic powder on top and baked for 25 minutes.  I would watch the baking time.  With thin cutlets, 30 minutes could leave you with dried out chicken.  My husband loved this, and said it was good enough for company.  Considering the fact that the chicken is low fat and the feta is 80 calories an ounce, this only tastes fattening.  I will make it again.

Quite good.  I made the following revisions:- used regular feta cheese - added sun dried tomatoes - used one beaten egg to hold coating - used panko seasoned with oregano, garlic salt and pepper for coating - did not add crumbs to bottom of pan.

My husband (a feta lover) scarfed this down. I will have to make again for him. I will make mine the way I love it with mushrooms and muenster. Added a little evoo to the tops for some browning. Overall, a nice simple middle of the week recipe.

This was excellent!!  My husband went nuts over it and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I did use egg before I rolled the chicken in the bread crumbs, and instead of tomato basil feta, I chopped up some fresh tomatoes (very finely chopped) and fresh basil and a dab of olive oil, mixed them all together. It was divine.

The chicken and feta went very well together.  Delicious.  My only problem was using too big of breasts.  3 out of 4 were much too big and I had a hard time pounding them to size.  Next time I'll use much thinner breasts to begin with.

Great recipe!  I used the advice in some of the reviews and used egg to apply the bread crumbs to the chicken.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was quick and easy to make and absolutely delicious!  I'll definitely be making this again.

Great recipe.  Made this last night and used plain feta, fresh basil and diced tomatoes.  I also added some garlic seasoning to the chicken before adding the bread crumbs.  But I will say that drizzling a little butter over the stuffed chicken prior to baking adds a ton of flavor. Just don't over do it!

It was really good. My boyfriend said it was a keeper. I did use egg to get the breadcrumbs to adhere. I also didn't layer them in the pan.  I did spray the top with a little olive oil to get the top more crisp.  Also, I added a little red and black pepper, but that is just because I like pretty much everything I eat with a kick.

I tried this recipe mainly because I am following a high protein/low fat and carbs diet. It was delicious! I repeated it, using one reviewer's suggestion of adding sun-dried tomato, resulting in an even tastier dish. I will repeat again, this time adding Italian peppers.I agree that adding more breadcrumbs, well-seasoned with herbs, salt and pepper, added both to the texture and to the flavour.If you make the crumbs from wholewheat bread, that makes the dish healthier and slightly less calorific.

Pretty good, but I think it would have been a bit bland without the changes I made. My husband isn't a tomato fan, so I used regular (reduced fat) feta. I also added quite a bit of seasoning (garlic pepper and a greek blend) on both sides of the chicken, and in with the bread crumbs. It came out a bit salty, so I'll alter my seasoning blend next time, but I think the chicken would have been boring without something mixed in with the bread crumbs. I also sprayed a quick shot of cooking spray on top to help keep the outside crusty, and upped the cooking time to about 38 minutes (I used fairly large chicken breasts).

I made this for my boyfriend's family over Christmas and it was a big hit! I paired it with Linguine with fresh tomatoes and pan-fried asparagus (recipes from this site) and the flavours matched nicely. I find that any sort of flavoured feta works. I make homemade bread crumbs and flavour them with Italian seasoning mix (oregano, basil, thyme). A great favourite!

This was so good! The whole family loved it! Though after reading some reviews I did make some changes. Rather than feta cheese I used a mozzarella cheese inside, then mixed a good amount of an Italian six cheese blend with my breadcrumbs. Inside with the mozzarella I used basil, sliced grape tomatoes, minced garlic, salt and pepper. I served it on angel hair in a six cheese sauce with sauted mushrooms, shallots and garlic and fresh tomatoes. Yum!

I have made this a few times now and each time it has come out wonderfully.  The first time I used sundried tomatoes and feta and the second time, I used roasted red peppers, fresh basil, and feta.  I dipped the chicken breast in egg first, then the bread crumbs.  Also, I would highly recommend drizzling some of the oil from the tomatoes or the peppers over the chicken prior to baking.  I also used chicken strips and felt they were easier to flatten and stuff.  Yummy!

Very good recipe!  I added extra feta cheese and included sun-dried tomatoes into the mix and it turned out great. Next time, I'll try tomato pesto or sliced plum tomatoes along with the feta cheese. I may skip the breadcrumbs and replace it with lemon-pepper spice.

My chicken came out dry, despite the egg and a drizzle of olive oil half way through the baking time. While I was adding the feta, I saw a similar recipe on the lid that called for a squirt of lemon juice and I thought that added a nice flavor.

WHAT I DID WAS..... added thawed and squeezed chopped spinach to the feta, rolled the stuffed chicken (which I sprinkled inside with garlic powder, salt & pepper, in the bread crumbs then sprayed it all with olive oil)  Baked 20ish minutes, it turned out perfect!  The family gobbled it up!  Thanks for the easy idea, especially since I happened to have the sundried feta! I served with those "mini artichokes" from Trader Joes and Cous-Cous. Oh, and I also made a packet of Chicken gravy to top the chix & cous-cous) Yummy!

Easy and delicious recipe.  The flavored feta and chicken are a great-tasting combo.  I made this recipe the first time exactly as it's written, but I think it's better without the Italian breadcrumbs.  If you really want some kind of coating, I would use homemade breadcrumbs, maybe combined with some seasoning of your choice.

Very good.  I skipped the bread crumbs, used regular feta and added basil.  Drizzled olive oil over.  Everyone enjoyed and it looked great too.

Delicious.  My husband didn't think he would like it because of the feta cheese, but he loved it.  I used regular feta cheese and added dried basil to it.  I also used canned tomatoes (drained so it wouldn't be to watery) and added basil to that too.  I drizzled olive oil over the top per other reviewer's advise.  It filled the house with a wonderful aroma while it was cooking.  This recipe is a keeper!

We really enjoyed this and would make it again. I used the suggestions: I only had plain feta - so I added dried basil and fresh chopped tomatoes.  I also coated in egg and the whole thing in bread crumbs and used olive oil on top.  It did take me longer to cook it as well.  I served it with roasted asparagus and a med. inspired salad.

A very good basic recipe with lots of room for interpretation and play depending upon your ingredients on hand. One word of warning: I used bacon as per suggestions of other cooks, and was pleased, but the smoky taste of the bacon I used really overwhelmed the plain feta that I used. If you are going to add bacon to the recipe, go with a flavor that will balance with your feta.

I hate it when I'm so excited about trying a new recipe with such good reviews, and it's so disappointing.  I made this as directed aside from using extra bread crumbs, 1/4 cup just wasn't enough.  Wait, I did dip the breasts in egg and then roll in breadcrumbs, the recipe didn't say to do that.  Well, I'm sorry, but yuk.  I valiantly tried to eat it, but after about 4 bites just couldn't do it.  My husband even had to struggle to finish his, and he'll eat almost ~anything~ just so my feelings won't be hurt.  I even threw out the untouched one left in the pan, still warm.  I'm sorry, but would NEVER make this again.  I guess I'm in the minority here...all those other reviews can't be wrong, can they?  I think I'll leave the feta cheese for salads, not good cooked/melted.

Very easy and delicious. I used regular bread crumbs with half a package of italian dressing seasoning, regular feta and a bit of flavoured gouda. It was great,after bitting into semi-raw chicken, putting it back in the oven for another 10 minutes, then the microwave for 2 minutes. Next time I'll make sure the chicken is REALLY flat, and bump up the cooking time a bit (maybe even check the chicken before serving it!) I will definately try it again.

Gonna add this to the regular rotation. I didn't find it necessary to dip in egg, but I did fold the breasts like a sandwich and drizzled butter and olive oil over the whole thing. Cooked for 40 minutes and it didn't dry out. The husband said it was pretty, and it was!

This is my favorite kind of dinner- quick and easy. I made it pretty much as written except that I took other members' advise and dipped the rolled up chicken in egg first and I only had plain feta so I chopped up some basil and sun dried tomatoes and added them with the cheese. I would serve it for company if I had any picky eaters coming because there's really nothing to dislike.

This is a great base recipe.  I added tomato, garlic and spinach along with the feta cheese.  I also followed the other suggestions and dipped the chicken in egg before coating in bread crumbs, and I broiled them for the last four minutes or so.  Very good, I'll be making these often.

We really enjoyed this last night.  Seasoned the chicken, after adding the feta and fresh basil I folded in half, secured with toothpicks.  I brushed it with a mixture of mayo and plain yogurt.  Rolled in breadcrumbs mixed with freshly grated parmesan.  I followed a previous reviewer's advice and broiled it for the last 4 minutes.
Thank you for a great recipe!

I made it a little different than the recipe listed. I used regular feta and added spinach. I also rolled it into the checken breasts and secured w/ wooded toothpicks. Then I dipped it in egg and breadcrumbs. It was a huge hit with the family.

Easy and tasty. It smelled heavenly in the oven. It was very flavorful. I was just disappointed in the color. Next time I will dip in egg and then in the bread crumbs.

Not a quick recipe, was good but nothing I'd want to make on a work night. Also couldn't get the chicken to "fold in half" so had to roll it and secure with toothpicks. Did use one other reviewers suggestion of dipping the chicken rolls in egg first. I might make this again if I have extra time somenight.

Super easy and tasted great!  I added a dash of old bay onto the chicken, a bit of butter on top to keep it moist.  

I'm sure that adding some crumbled bacon in would be good, and maybe adding some italian cheese in with the bread crumbs, but seriously it's delicious without doing anything extra and what's so great about the recipie is that it literally took about 2 minutes of prep after preheating the oven.

Our first try, chicken needed a little more time in the oven and was a little bland. As other suggested, the second time, marinating the chicken and coating with egg before applying bread crumbs made it a family hit! Thanks.

We found this very bland. I think it has the potential to be a very good recipe with some additions. I will probably make it again adding more seasoning and maybe a bit of butter and or garlic.

I liked this recipe; it was very easy and good.  However, I think I would prefer a milder goat cheese instead of the Feta cheese in the recipe.

This recipe was very easy to make, but the taste was too bland for my family.  The consistency of the feta didn't work very well with the chicken, in my opinion.  It just clumped up instead of melting into the chicken, and the flavors weren't infused into the chicken when baking.  I don't think I'd make this again.

Wasn't fabulous, but good.  Really needs spiced up.  I tried it without adding any other spices/herbs for my first try at this recipe, and it was  on the bland side.  I pounded the chicken and after adding the feta I simply folded the chicken breast in half.  Didn't use toothpicks and it came out beautiful.  The tomato/basil feta is the way to go.  Will make again with additional seasoning!

This was pretty good. Nobody complained, but there weren't rave reviews. I also took the chicken out at the recommended time and cut into it only to have pink juice run down my plate. So next time I'll cook these longer, of course. Will cook again, good weekday meal.

This was really good. Hubby doesn't like tomatoes, so I had to make it with regular Feta. Will probably use the Basil Feta next time to add a little more flavor. Made with Wild Rice Casserole (also from this site) and green beans. Yummy!

I am not a great cook, but I am trying, so my poor boyfriend has to put up with my "mishaps".  I made this for us and we both loved it.  Not only that, but it was easy to make.  I added paramesan cheese in it since my boyfriend doesn't like feta too much and it was delicious.

I am a complete amateur when it comes to cooking and the first two recipes I tried off of this site were complete disasters.  I followed the instructions exactly for this Feta Chicken recipe and the chicken came out wonderful!  I will definitely make this again.

I honestly didn't expect this recipe to be that good, but it was!  I cut my breasts in half-thickness instead of pounding and rolled them instead of folding them.  Perfect complements are pasta pomodoro and jamie's cranberry spinach salad, as mentioned by some othe people. A beautfil meal that presents so well and tastes even better!

This makes a nice quick meal and can be easily varied.  I dredge w/flour and dip in egg before filling so the breadcrumbs stick and always add some seasoning.

This recipe was so easy and so good.  My family loved it.  For the bread crumbs, I used Shake & Bake Italian seasonings.  Also, insted of beating the chicken with a tenderizing mallet, I just sliced them in half lengthwise, leaving a fold on one side.  Superb recipe!!

Excellent!  I think this is a very versatile recipe and that you can be pretty creative in what you add to the feta and still have great results.  We really like using plain feta and adding fresh basil and sundried tomatoes.  This recipe will remain a staple in our household! Yum!

Very good!  Had broad appeal with a family we invited for dinner that we wanted to impress.  I used the "even thickness" breasts from Sam's Club, and regular feta adding sun-dried tomatoes (about 1.5 ounces) and fresh basil.  Served on a bed of "Sauteed Greens" from Cook's Illustrated (this site) and with the suggested Pasta Pomodoro (this site).  Everybody raved about it all.

Good dinner. I pounded the chicken breasts flat, sprinkled with seasoned salt, topped with feta and then rolled up. I sliced into 1 inch thick medallions which I rolled in crushed cornflakes rather than bread crumbs. Placed in greased baking dish and baked at 400 for 25-30 minutes. Delicious served with Greek Salad on the side!

Yummy!  A very moist and tasty, low fat chicken breast treat.  I added more spices, 1/2 t of dill weed, a 1 T thyme, and a sprinkle of basil on top.  Make sure each breast is of equal size!!!  I recommend making your own   bread crumbs, using fresh Italian bread, sprinkled with garlic salt and thyme, chopped into tiny pieces and baked for approx. 30 minutes at 250 degrees. Impress everyone, I did!!

This recipe was so fast and delicious!  Instead of placing the chicken on top of the bread crumbs, I rinsed with water (so the bread crumbs would stick) dredged both sides of the chicken in the crumbs.  I stuffed with regular feta cheese (what I had), and drizzled 2 Tbsp melted butter over the chicken.  Fantastic!  I will certainly make this recipe a regular!

This recipe was so quick, easy and very delicious.  I was a bit nervous at first that it might me a little bland without any seasoning, but the tomato basil feta cheese really adds a lot of flavor without a lot of fat and calories.  The only change I made was that I drizzled a little bit of olive oil over each piece of chicken.  My husband really loved this.  I will definately be making this again!

I cut the chicken cutlets in half, put the feta cheese in between and fastened them with toothpicks.  I also used 2 eggs to help the bread crumbs adhere to the chicken.  Great recipe!

I am a huge fan of feta cheese and this was so good! I made a few changes but very slight. I did not have time to marinate so after pounding the breasts I rubbed them w/ salt, pepper and basil.  To combat the dryness, I made a garlic butter sauce (found on this site) and drizzled it over the chicken after it was baked. YUMMY!

Pretty good and fairly easy.  I love feta cheese and am always looking for recipes in which to use it.

Very good and so easy to make.  As others have stated, it could use a little something on top.  Perhaps some sun-dried tomatoes or some light sauce.  I will definitely make again.

This is so good!  I did slice the chicken breasts in half because they were so thick and then pounded them.  I also floured, egged, and breaded with Italian bread crumbs before adding cheese and folding in half.  Served with angel hair pasta and I was in heaven!

This was a good recipe, too hard to find the sun-dried feta where I live, I used italian flavored feta. The chicken was really juicy.

This was easy to prepare and tasty.  The breadcrumbs on the top, however, were a little dry, so I drizzled a little more olive oil on top so it looked more appetizing and tasted better.

This was fantastic.  I made it for my in-laws (I needed something easy, since I am 8 months pregnant and didn't feel like standing in the kitchen all day).  It was easy, really moist (which shocked me!) and tasted fabulous.

Once you prepare the chicken and cheese together, they can easily be frozen, and used at a later date.  I found that I preferred the frozen ones since the feta cheese wasn't as strong.

This recipe was great!  I must admit I was a not sure if the feta would go well with the chicken but I was very pleasantly surprised.  I didn't have breadcrumbs in the house so I used crushed crackers and it was still wonderful.  This is a "keeper"!

A very, very simple dish to make that has the taste of a sophisticated meal as opposed to "instant chicken skillet" meal of the night. Very nice idea which went over big in my family.

Loved this. Did tweak by marinating in balsamic vinegar, olive oil and garlic for about one hour. I mixed sun dried tomatoes, and fresh basil with plain feta and I did drizzle some butter pre baking. I do agree that breading the bottom just results in a soggy mess, yummy, but soggy. Balsamic pasta with olives and fresh cherry tomato as my side.

I followed the suggestions of MAYLADY. It was delicious, but I would add some salt and pepper when using the bread crumbs and oil from the sundried tomatoes to coat the chicken, and maybe some other spices (I'll have to play around with different spices and see what's good) as I found it was a bit bland/plain tasting. 

Easy to make, would make again!

AMAZING and easy. I accidentally thawed chicken breast tenders, so I just sprinkled breadcrumbs on bottom of pan, laid tenders on top, sprinkled tenders with dried basil and feta, covered everything with breadcrumbs, and baked at 400 for 30 min. Def a repeat meal. My 2 yr old gobbled it up!

This was very delicious! I usually don't like oven baked chicken breasts but it was great. I did add bread crumbs to the out side and sprayed with oil so it would have a crisp. Trader Joe's carries a Mediterranean seasoned feta and that is the one I used. I will definitely make this again.

I marinated the chicken overnight with some store bought garlic vinaigrette and  I doubled the filling (I had regular feta that I added fresh tomato/red onion/basil/garlic/etc.) which really helped the flavor. I coated it with a little bit of olive oil before coating it with breadcrumbs. I drizzled a little melted butter on top towards the end so it got nice and brown. It was perfect!

I used asparagus instead. I didn’t change anything in the recipe. Chicken was very moist. I would make this again and try with other cheese.

Great and simple dish. Instead of pounding the chicken I cut the breasts length-wise (butterfly) to make two thinner filets. I added a spoonful of fig jam to the feta cheese stuffing, which added a flavorful sweetness to the dish. I also added some crushed fried onions, garlic salt, black pepper, and paprika to the bread crumb mixture. Finally, I served it over a bed of salad greens that had a light oil/vinegar and lemon juice dressing and a side of white rice.

Great dish!! And even the kids loved it. I used the tomato and basil feta and panko  crumbs, I was unsure which way to stuff them since I read the reviews and some people said roll it up others said filet the chicken. I did filet it and I will do it that way again but I will  make the breasts much thinner. And I don't think I read any reviews saying to flip them over during cooking, I did and it really helped with that golden look. Will be making again asap!

This chicken turned out tasty and moist.  I bought a package of "thin sliced" chicken breasts, so it was not necessary to pound them thin.  The second time I made this, I just used plain feta cheese and it tasted just as good.

So good!  Quick and easy too. I only 
had regular Feta also so added some chopped sundries tomatoes.   I was feeling lazy,  so I took another reviewer's advice and just slit the breast and stuffed it that way.   Cooked for 30 mins. Hubby really enjoyed this dish.  Thanks for sharing!

Four stars because I modified the heck out of this based on many reviews.  Here's how I did it and it came out pretty darned good.  Pounded the breasts very thin and trimmed them into rough rectangles.  Salt & Pepper the breasts on both sides.  In a bowl combined GOOD feta (the block stuff in liquid you have to break up), chopped fresh basil leaves, and diced sun dried tomatoes (in olive oil).  then I generously topped the flattened breasts with that mixture, and rolled as others have suggested (ala Kiev style).  Then I egg washed each, and coated with Panko.  Put some more Panko down in a baking dish (keep from sticking) and then put the chicken in the dish.  Drizzle with olive oil (makes it more golden on top).  I baked for about 40 mins - but my breasts were almost 1/2 lb each.  Overall very good, but again, I made an almost completely different recipe.  :)

a really good recipe was very good but had trouble flattening the chicken breast. I used mashed up croutons and worked out pretty good (really easy to make-- I'm a student therefore lazy)

This recipe is wonderful! One of my boyfriend's favorite!  I followed some of the other advice and used plain feta and added my own sundried tomatoes and basil.  I also drizzled some butter on top while it was baking.  Great recipe!

Everyone LOVED the filling! I'm dying to add chopped scallions to the inside since the feta has such a distinctive,strong flavor. I too (like another reviewer) used sundried tomato pesto and it came out great. With a couple tweaks, this is going in the permanent recipe box!

Delicious! I separated all the stuffing ingredients - sundried tomates, basil and feta - instead of the all-in-one cheese. I also added some minced garlic for flavour. Absolutely delicious!

Great recipe--my husband even said "good show" after cleaning his plate!  I used the suggestions offered in the reviews: I dipped the chicken in egg before the breadcrumbs, I used plain feta and added sun-dried tomato, and I drizzled just a little olive oil before I put it in the oven.  Great recipe!  Definitely company appropriate but weekday easy.

I sorta combined this with the recipe for mediterranean chicken.  Instead of greasing pan added 1:1 lemon juice and olive oil.  Instead of bread crumbs used italian bread crumbs 2:1 parmesan cheese.  Also added 1/2 pckg neufatchel cheese (like cream cheese) softened with the blue cheese and 1 teaspoonful garlic powder with the cheese.  Secured the rolls with toothpics and the result after 25 minutes was absolutely wonderful.  This is an easy quick and absolutely delicious recipe - 5 stars is almost not enough!!!

This recipie was great! Boyfriend loved it he even had second helpings! I did season the inside of the chicken breasts with salt and pepper and sprinkled some bread crumbs as well before I added the filling.I used regular feta, fresh basil, sundried tomatoes, and some minced garlic. Didn't want if crispy on the outside so i melted a little butter and drizzled it overtop. Had to cook it an extra 5 min. Served it with some asparagus and seasoned roasted potatoes. Will definately be having this again!

This was so yummy!  I followed the recipe, adding only a little salt and pepper to the tops of the chicken before sprinkling on bread crumbs.  I didn't like the way the bread crumbs were "dry" on top.  When I make this again, I will spray the tops with some olive oil.  But, the whole family lived this recipe.  It was juicy and flavorful.

This recipe was ok.  I added sun-dried tomatoes to the feta to give it a little more flavor but overall this recipe was nothing to write home about.  WIll save it for an easy mid week meal here and there.

This is my husbands favorite main dish.  I use the crumbled feta cheese that has herbs in it as well.  Also I dip the chicken in egg before breadcrumbs.

This was a very good recipe!  I found it last minute, so I didn't have all of the ingredients and just used what I had.  I use low fat feta, sprinkled some dry basil flakes, and topped it with a piece of roasted red pepper.  After folding, I followed the other suggestions and used egg to help the bread crumbs stick.  It came out really good and was SUPER easy to make.  I would definitely recommend!

delicious chicken. I love feta so this one was of course a big hit. I made it for my mother and father in law and they loved it as well. I will be making this one again in the near future!

This was delicious!  I followed some of the recommendations.  I had chicken cutlets on hand, substituted garlic and herb feta cheese, and added in sundried tomatoes, which really enhanced the flavor.  I also dipped the chicken in egg, which helped the breadcrumbs to stick to the chicken. I served it over linguine, and mixed the left over tomatoes and feta cheese with the pasta.  Yummy!!  I am usually picky about my chicken, and this turned out very juicy and flavorful.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

My husband and I love this recipe!  Instead of following the recipe exactly, I made these changes: 1) bought chicken breast cutlets, 2) bought garlic and herb feta cheese, and 3) bought sundried tomatoes in a jar.  The cutlets come out perfect after 35 minutes in the oven and the garlic and herb feta give it extra flavor and you can cut up and add as much sundried tomatoes as you like. This was so easy to make, yet tastes so refined.  Thanks for the recipe!  It will be used the next time I have guests.

This was a great meal and easy to make! My husband did like it but said something was missing..I know what it was I used plain bread crumbs instead of seasoned. Next time I make this I will use the seasoned. Thanks for such a easy and wonderful dish

I've made this a couple of times now.  The first time, it did NOT impress me.  I made it a second time, (to be honest, because I didn't realize that I had made it before) and it was really good.  So good, that I have requests tonight to make it a second time in the same week.  I followed the recipe just as written (other than using regular bread crumbs with Italian seasoning mixed in because it was all that I had on hand), and it was pretty tasty.  SUPER EASY to make which alone, earns it high marks.

This recipe was very good. My husband who does usually like feta, really enjoyed it. I gave it four stars because it could be better with non seasoned bread crumbs, this would make it less salty.....fresh basil would be perfect! I used a lot more bread crumbs for the crispier outside. Great recipe.

This recipe was excellent! The store only had garlic and herb flavored feta so I did what others suggested and I cut up some sun dried tomatoes and added that to the mix as well. I also added some grated parmesean to the breading. My fiance and 3 yr old both agreed that it was wonderful.  I will be making this again.

Great recipe, would be a 5 with my alterations. I followed some of the advice, and mixed chopped sun dried tomatoes and feta in my bullet, and tore up some fresh basil to stuff the chicken with. Also, instead of using breast halves, i simply butterflied the meat cuts; splitting the meat allows for a faster cook time. Other than that, just spice up the bread crumbs with parm, salt, pepper, and whatever dried herbs turn your crank! a keeper for sure.

I have not made for a while, I was going through my recipes looking for something different.  I totally forgot how good this was!  Very Good!  The only change I made was that I added a couple sun-dried tomatoes inside along with the feta. (Just for personal taste, but just as good made exactly as is!!)

We really enjoyed this recipe and it's a great way to jazz up the traditional chicken.  I had a hard time getting the chicken to cook all the way through and we thought the stuffing could be a little zestier so I might try adding some spices the next time I make it.  Still very yum!

Pretty good. I didn't have much time to prepare in the oven, so I had small stuffed and breaded pieces of chicken that I pan fried in a little cooking spray until done. Moist and tasty.

Delicious and easy, and a great hit with my friends! I actually stuffed the chicken with fresh cherry tomatoes and fresh basil (Fresh from the garden!), and substitued goat cheese for the feta.

This turned out great! Everyone loved it, even my picky 3 yr old! I read the reviews first, and did not use as much feta as the recipe called for> I'm glad I didn't because to us it was just right. I think it would have to overpowering! Great Recipe, this will be a regular! Thanks!

I made this a couple of nights ago, and it was good, and really easy.  I made my own wholewheat breadcrumbs and added some herbs to complement the tomato-basil feta.  I also did as another reviewer suggested, and cut a "pocket" into the chicken breast instead of pounding it flat.

The chicken turned out really tender and crispy on the oustide.  My husband and 1-year-old both really enjoyed it, but I'm not sure that I would use feta cheese again.  I enjoy it in salads but it was a little overpowering with the chicken, for my taste anyway.  But not bad - definitely a good easy meal with lots of scope for adjustment.

This was good but I found out I am not too fond of Feta Cheese so next time I won't put so much on.  But other than that the flavor was great!

My brother and I just ate this for dinner tonight and it was GREAT! His response was "I hope you bookmarked this one!" However, I made a few adjustments.  I dipped my six chicken breasts in a mixture of 1 egg, 2 garlic cloves (chopped), approx. 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and seasoned with onion salt and garlic pepper to taste.  I let the chicken breasts sit in the egg mixture while I was tenderizing the other chicken breasts. After that, I followed the original recipe. I used Athenos brand tomato basil feta cheese. I'm glad I made extra!

one of our favorite dishes! I buy the small tub of feta at the grocery store, but there is about half leftover after stuffing the chicken. I add it to a saucepan witha can of cr. of celery soup and about a cup of milk and cook over medium-low heat until warm and thin. It make a easy but very good sauce drizzled over the top. There is rarely any chicken leftover, but I like this sauce served over toast the next day.

Very good! I bought thin chicken breasts, and baked them for 40 min. based on other feedback. Just a tad on the dry side, so next time I would adjust time to 30-35 min. Other than that, yum!!

This recipe is delicious, I've made it many times.  One fun thing that adds an Italian flair is making it with mozzarella, sundried tomatos, and broccoli rabe or spinach...it's yummy like that.

This is EASY and TASTY.  I agree that it would serve up nicely for a dinner party. I dipped the chicken in egg before rolling it in breadcrumbs. I served it with a pasta side but it would go just as well with rice or even just veggies or salad.  I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

This was just ok for me.  I will probably not make it again.  It had the cheese twist - but nothing special in flavor in the end.

We enjoyed the flavors of this recipe but found that it didn't brown at all. Next time we will try adding a touch of oil or try spraying the breaded tops with cooking spray before baking.

This is a family favorite...and I've only fixed it once! The chicken was juicy and tender...a very good dish!..Next time I make it I will roll the chicken in egg then bread crums as suggested in some of the reviews.

This was a really good base recipe, but it needed something to counteract the feta cheese, maybe roasted red peppers.  Also, dipping in egg before the bread crumbs is a good idea.

Pretty good, eating it right now.  I marinated my chicken for a couple days (didn't have time to make this earlier) and I used feta cheese with Mediterranean herbs instead of with tomato/basil.  Other than that, I made the chicken exactly as it was outlined.    Mine didn't come out looking like the feature picture, but  the chicken DID fold in half.  Nice, simple recipe.  I think next time, I'll dip the chicken in egg, then in the bread crumbs.  I'd also recommend cooking it for a little longer than 30 minutes, as mine wasn't fully cooked (but that could be for a number of reasons).  Healthy with a side of pasta and broccoli.

This was awesome!  So easy.  Goes great with green beans and a Greek salad.  Leftovers are just as good.  Thanks I will make this often.

VERY tasty. Relatively easy to prepare and the feta was an excellent compliment to the chicken. Highly recommended.

Very easy and has a nice flavor. I used regular feta, and spread chicken with a  sundried tomato basil pesto. I also added some olive oil and a little butter to the dish.

Super easy and delicious.  I used the feta with garlic and added some white wine before baking, as was suggested by another, and a few grape tomatoes.

Hmmm, this one sounded better than it was.  I took some other reviewers' advice and squirted lemon juice on the meat, then sprinkled on Italian dressing mix and parmesan bread crumbs.  Also used more bread crumbs and included spinach in the filling.  While this was easy and certainly not terrible, we found the meat very dry and really not that flavorful, even with the additions.  I won't make this again, but it was worth the try!

Really delicious recipe.  We didn't have any tomato-basil feta so we used sundried tomatoes and some pesto.  Lord, it was good.  The tang of the tomatoes really compliments the feta flavor.  This is a new favorite!

This recipe was pretty good. Since i only had plain feta, i used real tomatoes and basil. The chicken was moist and tasted quite nice. I'll re-do this recipe with more ingriedients

I used garlic feta cheese and dipped entire stuffed boneless, skinless chicken thigh in beaten egg before I rolled it in the highly seasoned bread crumbs.  I used lots of italian seasoning in the bread crumbs.

Very nice. I didn't have sun dried tomatoe feta, so I just mixed some regular feta with some sun dried tomatoe pesto, and that seemed to work well. I rolled the stuffed brests in some Italian sald dressing before rolling in the bread crumbs. When there was about 5 mins cooking time left, I sprinkled some Tex Mex cheese on top of the breasts, which we thought was a nice addition. The flavours were great, though the feta is deffinetly strong! Next time I might try to mix in a little mayo with the feta mixture, just to make it a little more mild and creamy. Very tast as is though too. :)

I am giving this 5 stars, because of the swell taste (achieved via few ingredients) along with the easy prep, and nice presentation.  My husband has commented favorable both times I have made this, so I figure it is a winner!  Thx Debbie for the fine post.

I really impressed company with the flavor!  I followed some other suggestions to roll/toothpick/dip in egg and cook longer.  Word of caution, I may have pounded the chicken less than "gently" as it was falling a part as I tried to roll it (but it sure was tender!).  I think I'll try the sandwich method one of the other reviewers recommended next time because there will definitely be a next time.  I used panko bread crumbs as that is what I had on hand but I wouldn't recommend it because they didn't brown and the chicken looked unappealingly pale.  Great recipe!  Thank you.

This was pretty good, I added some canned italian chopped tomatoes which added a lot of flavor, otherwise I think it may have been a little bland.

I have trouble finding anything other than plain feta cheese in my grocery store, but even with just plain feta, this is delicious!  I usually add a pinch of oregano with the feta, too.  Very tasty!

Delicious and easy. I think one review suggested drizzling with a little butter before cooking. Good idea. Makes it even better. I've made this many times and will keep doing so.

I wasn't too sure what the big deal was with this recipe. It is just breaded chicken stuffed with feta cheese.  Not too colorful or interesting.  It was pretty dry too.  I gave three stars because it was very easy to make.  Don't know if I will make again, unless I come up with other interesting toppings.

I love this recipe! Quick, easy and delicious!  To save time, I buy the thin sliced chicken breasts which make wrapping much easier.  And for a little extra kick, sometimes I will add a slice of proscuitto.  Yum!  Thanks for sharing!

VERY good.  I didn't have tomato/basil feta so I just used regular and added basil.  I also didn't have italian bread crumbs so I used regular and added italian seasoning.  It came out really well.

Recipe was very easy to put together and had a wonderful flavor. I might try dipping the chicken in olive oil next time to help the bread crumbs stick and also to keep the chick a little more moist on the outside. This is a great recipe and we'll enjoy it many more times!!!

Chicken was slightly dry, not much taste.  PRobably would not make again.  It was easy to prepare though.

yummy.  I didn't have the exact ingredients on hand so I had to improvised.  I used plain feta and mixed in a little dry sundried tomato dip mixture.  I then coated in original Shaken Bake flavored crumbs.  Came out fabulous.  Will definitely be making this again and again.

I added chopped tomatoes to the feta, and the combo of the melted cheese and tomatoes was very good.  I also added more cheese since my chicken breasts were thicker.  I found the breadcrumbs were unnecessary though, but I added melted butter and basil like I read in other reviews for some color.   This was good and easy but not the best thing i ever had.

Awesome! The feta infused into the chicken. Just Perfect. I added slices of lemon and tomatoes for a citrus twist, it was a great addition. Thank you for this recipe.

This is a good recipe.  Marinated the chicken in garlic and white wine first - very easy to make.  I read some of the other reviews that said they used fresh tomato and basil - I didn't have the time for this, and also to cut costs I just went ahead and used the tomato basil feta.  I thought it was great.  I can see how some might prefer fresh ingredients but for me it didn't seem necessary.

Tons of other ways to make chicken that are better.  This isn't bad. It is okay.  I would not buy feta for this recipe.  Will only make this if I have feta cheese on hand and nothing else to do with it.  Cooking time should be longer around 40 minutes.

This would be a great appetizer. Next time, instead of using bread crumbs I will use some cajun seasoning for more kick.

This recipe was delicious. The only thing I changed was I put the bread crumbs on both sides instead of just on the top. Very juicy and very flavorful. I made this for a group of friends and they all raved about it. I will definately be making this again.

I thought this was very good. I did drizzle some melted butter on top before baking and I had to bake it for about 40-45 minutes. It was still very juicy. I served it with pasta pomodoro (from this website).

This recipe was awsome!!!  My family wolfed it down and asked for more.  The chicken was so juicy and bursting with flavor.  It is definatly a keeper for us and I have given the recipe to my mother and brother who both plan on making it this weekend. I know I will get a call thanking me!  Thanks for the great dish!

This was great Chicken.  I am doing low carbs so instead of using the bread crumbs I covered the checken with almond meal.  I used plain feta because that is what I had and then drizzled it with some balsamic vinegar.  After the chicken had baked for about 10 minutes I added some sauted mushrooms to the center of the chicken.  I served the chicken ontop of sauted fresh spinach with some garlic salt.  It was so good and easy.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this over the weekend...VERY, VERY EASY & OH SO GOOD!  We had it again for lunch the next day, it reheats perfectly.  I added some chopped sun dried tomatoes to mine (though it didn't need it) & it was awesome!  My boyfriend LOVED it & said it's his new favorite.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was very very simple, and tasted great. I served this with penne and marinara which seemed to overpower the chicken. Next time I think I will add spinach and serve with garlic mashed potatos or a lighter pasta dish. I will definitely be making this again!

This is a great recipe to dabble with.  Just changing around the type of cheese changes the whole flavor.  I have tried it with at least three types of cheese and liked each one.
