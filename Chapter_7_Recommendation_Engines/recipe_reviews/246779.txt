This was so good I made it twice. I didn't make any changes to the recipe as I often do the 2nd time I make it, it was that good.

Didn't care for the chicken as not much taste.

Delicious and easy to do, and no long marination time required!  I doubled all the spices except for the cayenne pepper and it was perfect.  The dip is great too and can be used for veggies as well.

Enjoyed this recipe.  The cinnamon and tumeric ehanced the flavors, especially with salt to my taste.  The dip is very good.  I let it sit for 30 minutes before serving and the sweetness of the honey was perfect.  Will make this again.

We loved this! Great flavor and simple preparation. Don't skip the yogurt dip accompaniment...it absolutely makes the dish, brings out the flavors. Though I would suggest you halve the dip recipe unless you plan to drown the wings in it.  I served the wings as a main course with Isreali (pearl) couscous on the side.

Used the recipe with a pork tenderloin, which was grilled to medium rare (150F with meat thermometer). Served with grilled pineapple slices and the yogurt dip. Quick and tasty.

I doubled the  amount of Cayenne to make it a little spicier and it turned out a mild medium but had lots of flavor! These were so easy to prepare and I will definitely be making them many more times in the future!!

Tastes great! I doubled the seasoning and was out of honey so I put a little bit of barbecue sauce and it tastes great!

Wow these were a major hit!! I made one batch as is and a second with a butter-honey sauce mixed with the portion of spices from the recipe. The "wet wings" were all gone, I'm glad I thought to make a spiced sauce to pour over them! The "dry wings" were very good too though. Will definitely make these again!
