These were a huge hit at my place. Personally I loved the taste, but I would love it even more on a thin crust.  If I make it again, I will use the thin crust dough and dice my tomatoes so they don't end up sliding off with a bite.  Very good!

These are very yummy! ive been makin them for friends and family for a couple yrs now. Except i spread about a cup of mozzarella on the pizza crust, them put my sliced tomatoes, then put the mayo mixture on top of the tomatoes. the recipe i use calls for 2 cups mozzarella......1 cup on the crust, and 1 cup in the mayo mixture. Makes it nice and cheesy!!!

This recipe is so tasty. I love it because I can use my Pampered Chef grater, garlic press, and large bar pan. I used Pillsbury Pizza Crust, 2/3c mayonnaise, and 2 c shredded mozzarella, plus the other ingred. listed in the recipe. I preheated oven to 400 degrees.After the dough was rolled on the pan I sprinkled 1 c of the shredded mozzarella over it. Mixed the other cup of mozzarella, parmesan, basil, mayo, and garlic in a bowl. Placed 4 thinly sliced Plum tomatoes on top of the mozz/crust, then scooped mixture over the tomatoes and baked 20 minutes til golden and bubbly. Easy and oh so good!

These were ok. I would have liked more tomato and instead of chopped basil, i think a leaf or half leaf laid under each slice of tomato would have been a fresher, more potent touch. Also I think I'll cook it for longer next time as the dough was still a bit soft and I would have prefered a more crunchy crust (see bruchetta style)

Excellent!  I used this with the grilled dough recipe on here and it was phenomenal.  I doubled the recipe to make 2 pizzas and may work on decreasing the amount of mayo next time.  It was not offensive or overpowering; just interested in seeing if we can decrease some of the fat.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Very simple.  Very good. A great appetizer or starter.  You can easily add more ingredients to make it a heartier pizza.

Delicious!!!  I used a flour tortilla, placed in broiler until lightly browned and crisp. I tripled the basil and the garlic and eyeballed the mozzarella. Absolutely delightful!

I have been making this for several years. Its best if you let cool then cut. Otherwise the tomatoes tend to slide off as you eat. My husband prefers it with mini pepperoni slices on it, only it adds a lot more grease.

This was really good! Didn't have fresh basil, so used dry in the crust and the sauce. No roma tomatoes in store so used a regular one and chopped fairly large. Very forgiving recipe and it was yummy for watching yhe playoffs! I used quick and easy pizza crust by chef rider and it was very good. Made it in the food processer. Can't wait to make it with the "real" stuff. Thanks, we'll be making this again for sure!

This was very good - I opted to dice my tomatoes and used 4 Romas, I also doubled the mayo-garlic paste and used one cup of cheese on top.  Very beautiful on the table and tasted great!  I will make this again!

What a terrific pizza/flatbread!  So quick and easy, and very delicious.  I used seamless cresent roll dough (apparently a new product from Pillsbury).  The crust was buttery and light, highly recommended product.  I also used a spoonful of prepared basil pesto in place of the garlic/basil in the spread, and topped with lots of fresh basil and cracked pepper.  A definite do-over.  Thanks for sharing this recipe with AR!  A winner, for sure.

Very good recipe. I made this last night, and everyone loved it. The only thing I did differently, was add cream cheese to the mayo mixture, and increased the amount of garlic. I love garlic! Anyway, big hit!

This recipe is GREAT!  I tried to lower the fat and calorie content by using a little over half of the 2/3 cup mixture with light mayo and the rest with mayo and it turned out just fine.  Great for appetizers or dinner with a salad.

I've been making this for a long time... thanks to a cookbook. I find that I have to use at least 5 tomatoes to cover the whole pizza - no idea how 3 will even come close.

I have made this a couple times and it is so easy and delicious that I will make if often. I made it just like the recipe was written, but last time,  I added some cooked chicken pieces to make it a meal.  I was generous with the garlic and basil-yum.

this recipe is great although I substitute mayo for Greek yogurt instead. I usually end up using about a cup of that to spread on the bottom with the parm and basil. that with some whole wheat pizza crust makes for a healthier version. my husband and I make this frequently!

Stupid!!!!! Iv never tasted pizza this epic before! I used a homemade pizza crust, added onions ,olives, and mushrooms. I used shaker parma, and it turned out SO GOOD. DONT BE SHY WITH THE BASIL. It makes this dish. A very underrated recipe, probably because pizza isnt in the title. =) I plan on making this forever....seriously. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe. Family devoured it. I gave it 4 stars because personally I wasn't a huge fan of the mayonnaise in it... would have preferred a cream cheese base or something like that. Other than that it was a great combo though!
