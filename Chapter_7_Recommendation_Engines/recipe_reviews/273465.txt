When I saw this recipe, it caught me in a mood where I wanted to try something new.  I had most of the ingredients already, so picked up some boneless, skinless chicken breast on sale, and started cooking.  It turned out Delicious!  I will make this A gain!  Recommend trying this!

YUM! This was really delicious! I made it according to this recipe. The sauce was wonderful, but a little too salty. A little too much cinnamon.
 The next time I make it  for every two chicken breasts,  I will double all the spices except for the cinnamon. I would double the garlic, veggies and stock. I would use low sodium broth. This would leave leftover sauce to be sopped up by crusty bread!

I made exactly as directed with exception of using olive oil vs vegetable oil, paired with garlic mashers, and it was just OK.  Absolutely no WOW factor from anyone, and, as tomato paste is a thickener, way too much of it for that small amount of liquid.  Recipe states a lot of sauce, but 1 cup total liquid isn't much at all, so, after the initial taste test making the recipe as directed, I ended up adding way more broth and wine to thin the sauce to a normal consistency.  Probably won't make again, sorry.

Made this for my daughter and son-in-law and we all loved it.  Had it over brown rice, but next time I will try it over polenta!

It was ordinary in my opinion.   Made as directed.
