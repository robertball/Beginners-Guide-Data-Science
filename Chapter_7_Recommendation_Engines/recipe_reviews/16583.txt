This is a recipe we make pretty regularly. I prefer to assemble it a little differently though. After the potatoes are cooked set them aside (but don't let them cool all the way, use them while they are still very warm). Then cook the bacon and set it aside. Add the onions to the bacon fat in the pan and cook until softened. Drain most of the bacon fat, leaving a couple of tablespoonsful. Add a few tablespoons of flour to the pan and cook a minute or two. Then add the vinegar and sugar and bring to a boil till it thickens and pour over warm potatoes and sprinkle the reserved bacon over. Adding the flour gives the sauce some thickness.

This is so much like gramma and mom taught me to make as a youngster over 50 years ago....64 now. glad those ol' dearly loved and missed Ukraine/German women were sticklers over teaching the boys how to cook and take care of themselves...lol.  but, I've seen some say it is too soupy....well, you add some extra taters, and cook some earlier than the rest, and mash them, and add, just like regular potato salad to give them a creamier mixture....and tho' it is not healthy way, gramma always added some of the bacon grease to it to add flavor...today we don't do it...mmmm rare occassion maybe, just to taste grammas way. don't be shy on the onion or pepper. hold back the salt.
If gramma could only see the appliances and shortcuts in kitchens today for her noodles, bread, spaetzles, etc...the old days, all from scratch. and she hand cut her noodles with an old paring knife on an old worn down block of wood, noodle by noodle. No one could ever say they were lazy cooks....spaetzles on a sieve? hahaha.  all hand done on the old steel grater.   GOD LOVEM ALL..The traditions of the old ways made us the chefs and hobby cooks we are today..

I treat this like a mashed potato dish, boiling the potatoes until they're soft. I just mash them with a fork, though, so they're still a bit lumpy, which makes for a nice texture. I skip the sugar and the vinegar. I've made this dish with vinegar and without, and much prefer it without.

Very much like the recipe I use.  I cheat by dicing raw red (unpeeled) potatoes into my bacon-onion-vinegar-sugar sauce.  After mixing potatoes with sauce, I bake at 325 degrees for 2 hours.
What I like to do is cook up b,o,v,s sauce freeze it and have it on hand so all I have to do is thaw the sauce and add potatoes when I am short on time.  It makes a nice traditional dish to take to funerals.  We are a Germans from Russia settlement and many my generation and younger do not take the time to make traditional dishes.

Whoa.......way too much sugar and way too much vinegar.  Bacon was a bit excessive for only 3# of spuds. I used a Russett potatoe and this probably needs a new or red potatoe to make it right. 
I think the concept is there, but needs a thickening agent such as maybe a bacon & flour roux to start the sauce. Won't do this one again, but it did whet my appetite for looking for the 'right' one!

I make this in much smaller batches for our small family, and I use equal amounts of white sugar and light brown sugar.

Very easy and delicious. My son is autistic and not very fond of mashed potatoes but he cleaned the plate with this version. I will definitely make again. Made no modifications just had to use half of ingredients due to few potatoes.
