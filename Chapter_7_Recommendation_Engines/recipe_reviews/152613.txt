We call this "Magic Toffee Brittle".  The recipe has been around forever, but it seems like a lot of people have never heard of it.  I get requests for this every Christmas and always get asked for the recipe at parties.  It is SOOO easy it is almost embarrassing to tell people how to make it after watching them trying to figure out what is in it.  I make 2 changes - use club crackers (about 40 covers the bottom of a large rimmed cookie sheet) instead of saltines for more richness and use chopped pecans on the top. Be sure and cook long enough in the oven or they will be chewy instead of crisp.

I agree that the butter and the light brown sugar should be increased to a cup each to make enough toffee mixture.

This was wonderful however after trying it the first time I realized that there wasn't enough of the toffee topping so increased the amount by 1/2 the next time and they were terrific.  I also found that if I separated them before they hardened I was able to maintain the nice neat square shape.  Everyone raved about this recipe and asked for copies so it tasted great.

So quick & so decadent. The butter and brown sugar caramelizes into a crunchy toffee. Who would think that the base on it is made from Saltine crackers? I have even used Ritz crackers when I ran out of Saltines, and crush up a few for the spaces between the round crackers. Everybody loved it! One hint, do watch the sugar and butter while it is cooking. You don't want to get it overcooked!

These are great and the toffee just makes it just perfect. I used chocolate chips and pecans instead of walnuts. Came out perfect!

I was hesitant about these at first, but I thought I'd try them because of their rating.  They did not disappoint!  Very easy, and very rich!

This is a recipe I used to make about 20 years ago, when I was 13.  I LOVED IT, and was sad when I lost it.  Nobody else knew what I was talking about when I asked about a saltine/toffee dessert.  Well I am GLAD to see it again, and will teach my 13 year old how to make it!

This was the most popular treat out of all the things I made this holiday season. Everyone just loved them and they disappeared as fast as I could make them. Thanks for the great recipe!

Thank you for this recipe...it is dreamy...everyone loves this combination salty, sweet, chocolate, and a crunch. It is by far one of the best.

Wow.  Super simple, fast, and REALLY good!  They are so light and crispy that you don't realize how rich and sinful they are!  I used chopped peanuts because I don't like walnuts....YUM!!!

Very good.  I followed suggestions and doubled the amount of butter and brown sugar.  This was too much.  Next time I will try 3/4 cup butter and 3/4 cup brown sugar.  Also use a cookie sheet that won't buckle while baking because it will move your crackers all over the place and underneath each other.
