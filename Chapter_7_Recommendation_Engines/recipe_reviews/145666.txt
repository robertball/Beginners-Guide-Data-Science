This recipe was o.k. It was kinda bland. I followed recipe to the T. However, I may try this again..But, my way. Its a good concept. So, I am rating the recipe as is.  To stomp out the confusion..you are to use UNCOOKED Orzo in the first step. You are "toasting" the Orzo. So, make sure your heat isnt on High and your watching it. Because, you dont want it to get too browned or burnt.

I made this recipe but instead of using orzo as the pasta I left that out and served the sauce over angel hair pasta.  It was delish!!  I also like a little more kick so instead of stewed tomatoes I used tomatoes and chilis in a can.  I'll be making this again.

This recipe was really yummy and we had fun making it. Some things we did differently were add shrimp and use chicken broth instead of veggie broth just because thats all we had on hand. The step about the orzo confused me, I take instructions very literally, did it mean cooked orzo? At any rate, we continued the recipe as instructed minus the orzo step and added the cooked orzo and shrimp at the end and stirred it up into one yummy "stew". ;)

Wow!  This was GREAT!  My kids LOVED it!  I might have used a bit more than 2 T olive oil, but the browning of the orzo really made it taste really nutty.  I think the next time I will use diced tomatoes instead of the whole stewed ones and see if that makes a difference in the texture.  The parmesan gave it an Italian flavor that I loved.  Romano cheese would also work.  I just can't get past browning that orzo.  That makes it soooo perfect!  Shredding the veggies is a must, since it is in keeping with the texture you start with the orzo.  EXCELLENT recipe!

I did try this recipe basically because I had orzo pasta.  I made several modifications with this recipe, it did turn out pretty decent (hence the three stars). To begin with saute orzo with garlic and onions and then add all kinds of vegetables - I added zucchini, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, and asparagus.  Followed the steps after that, however the vegetable broth to pasta ratio is really off. I added another 14 ounce can of vegetable broth the pasta. I added crushed red pepper flakes on the top (extra kick) and extra Parmesan cheese for the kids.  Overall a decent recipe.

A little tangy, but otherwise not so bad! Left out the canned tomatoes as I reckoned they may go soggy in with the pasta. However, even the non-vegetarians enjoyed it. Will be making this one again!

This recipe was easy to make and pretty tasty. I think it needed more kick so next time I make it I'll probably add some crushed red peppers and maybe another clove of garlic.

I did change my version a bit...but it was a HUGE hit at my house...I used all the same ingredients only used italian seasoned stewed tomatoes instead of plain and the seasonings, and instead of shredding the veggies I made them more chunky.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was yummy. The orzo stuck to the pan while it was browning and when it was simmering, so I'd either use a non-stick pan or stir constantly. Thanks for the recipe!

amazing recipe! i don't normally follow measurements but i was close enough. i added a yellow bell pepper i had lying around when i added the carrots and zucchini. I also added more garlic. I didn't have itlian seasoning but i had this roasted garlic & pepper seasoning that I used a dash of. It tastes great without the parmesan. It also looks nice!

This is one of my favorite recipes ever! I do not miss meat one bit, the combinations of fresh veggies, lime juice and the spices is amazing! However, I experimented with varying amounts of cayenne to compliment the lime which I highly encourage you to do.

Yummy! Did add a little more seasoning & a tad of hot sauce. I don't know why someone would ever peel summer squash like zucchini & yellow squash. Yellow squash is good in this as well. Thanks for the recipe.

This was delicious on its own as a vegetarian main dish, but next time I am going to use this recipe to stuff bell peppers to make a main dish. The orzo was a little too al dente for me so I will also use just a bit more liquid to make sure it's soft enough. It was perfect as leftovers the next day!

This was pretty good. Made some changes, increasing the lime juice, because we all like citrus, and that was just right. Left out the parsley, and increased the cheese. What I would change is to use fresh instead of stewed tomatoes. Also, I didn't peel the zucchiini, as peeled zucchini seems pointless. A good base recipe to adapt to your own tastes.

Awesome dish! I halved the recipe, as this was for myself to eat throughout the week for lunch. I followed the recipe exactly, except subbing dried parsley for the fresh.  As much as I love fresh, the quantity is too much for one person to use up before it goes bad. Also I omitted the Parmesan, as the only kind we had was the Kraft cheese in a can and I prefer the good, fresh stuff.  Simple, easy, and tasty. I can't wait to make this one again!

Delicious.  with a few changes. (only because of what I had on hand.)  Vegetables were thinly sliced instead of shredded. (Julienne).  Used pre-flavored  chopped stewed tomatoes.  Used 1 cup only, chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. Added 2 small sweet red peppers.  Omitted the lime juice and zest. Used Romano instead of Parm.   Everyone loved it.

a good way to use up extra zucchini and its easy to put together.  I found it rather bland, though, so next time I'll increase the garlic and basil and maybe add some crushed red pepper.  The lime gives it a nice tang...overall a good vegetarian option.  Thanks for sharing!

We sure enjoyed this! I love all the veggies in it, and the flavor is excellent. I've always served it with lime grilled chicken, but I think it would also be a nice vegetarian main dish. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! I followed the recipe but cooked uncovered, stirring frequently. I think this would also be good with feta cheese instead of parmesan.

Very good. Like others have said, I'd up the amount of stock to about 3 cups, because it cooked off quickly and the pasta wasn't done yet.

This was really tasty!  I substituted Rotel for regular tomatoes to add some spice.  Next time I'll add some shredded chicken or ground turkey.

Next time I make this I'll saute the veggies before adding them to the orzo. It's really good as the recipe is written but I like my veggies to be a little softer. I also didn't have Italian seasoning or green onions so I just used oregano and shallots which turned out fine. And I didn't have beef broth so I used chicken broth which doesn't exactly make it vegetarian completely but nonetheless I really liked how this turned out.

This was great and easy to throw together.  We had a strawberry and spinach salad with it.

I followed the recipe but instead of green onions I used red and instead of cloves of garlic I used garlic powder. Instead of "Italian seasoning", I used oregano. Amazing! We usually do not do left overs but I made plenty, I can't wait to have it again tomorrow!

Making this vegetarian adjustment easy!

Yum! I doubled the veggies and added half an onion, diced. We still had a ton of tomatoes from our garden, so I used 2 cups of chopped, fresh tomatoes rather than canned. I really liked the shredded vegs with the orzo, it was a nice texture and the lime juice (no zest) gave it a good flavor.

Interesting mix of flavors. Good meal, but not one to add in regular rotation.

I made this for dinner tonight and liked it very much.  I did listen to other reviewers and added 3 cups of broth.  It needed it!  I also used fresh basil instead of dried because I have it growing in the yard and added 1/4tsp of crushed red pepper.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and enjoyed it very much.  Will make again.

Just made this and it's delicious. Very subtle. I read the reviews and added more oil initially, and a little of the broth so that the Orzo wouldn't burn or stick. It's a good idea to stay close to the pot while you're adding the ingredients. I also added more veggies (sweet peppers and mushrooms that I needed to use) and didn't use as much lime juice. A pretty easy recipe with a nice result.

This was ok.  I thought the flavors blended well together, although I'm not personally a fan of lime or parsley much.  I made it mostly because my husband loves both of those.  I followed the recipe for the most part.  All I did different was adding Rotel instead of regular tomatoes (by mistake, but I think I liked it that way) and using more water.  One can just didn't seem like enough.  I started with 2 cups and added about 1/2-1 cup more.  One reviewer asked whether you are meant to start with raw or cooked orzo.  You are definitely meant to start with raw, but like I said, you will probably need more water to cook it.  Anyway, it was something different that got rid of the lime and parsley I had on hand already, so that was nice.  We ate it as a main dish because my husband is a vegetarian, but it would probably make a good side dish as well.

Used chicken broth instead of veggie and increased the spices a bit. Topped with grated old cheddar and loved it!  It's a keeper. Thank you.

Great dish.  spiced it up by using Rotel Cilantro and Lime instead of stewed tomatoes.  10oz can so I pureed 1/2 cup of roasted red peppers to go with it.  Also, about 3 min before being done I added small shrimp.  My 3 yr old even ate this.

I am so disappointed in this recipe.  I made this exactly as is and love all the ingredients in the recipe but I wasn't happy with it.  I even added a lot more seasoning than called for but the consistency of the orzo with the vegetable broth was all wrong.

Tried the recipe for the first time tonight. It came out Fantastic! The only changes I made to it was instead of mincing the garlic I just crushed it and after the orzo was browned I took it out so it had just enough garlic flavor but wasn't too much. The veggies and seasoning were great and the lime juice just tweaked it over the top at the end. My sister loved it, said I could make it for her any time.

Watch out for burning the orzo!  Mine cooked very fast on a gas stove, even though it was turned down.  Still, it was a great vegetarian recipe.  I added a little extra garlic and lime juice for extra taste.

Very delicious!  I would definitely make again and tell others about this wonderful recipe.

One minor tweak: I used cilantro instead of parsley only because I cannot stand parsley.

My husband and I just love this recipe... it's one of our favorites!  Here are a few ways to spice it up:
We add a can of chopped black olives, at least 6 cloves of garlic (what can I say, I'm Lebanese?), and instead of stewed tomatoes we use a can of chopped tomatos with italian seasonings.  We also use a few carrots and mix some parmesan cheese in while cooking.  So at the end when you are adding the parsley and green onions, add the parmesan cheese and olives as well.  It's sooooo good!!

This is a very unique and different recipe, loaded with
lots of color and flavors! As written I thought it was too
"limey," so I cut the lime juice and zest in half, and it
was perfect, to me. I also substituted fresh basil for
the parsley, but other than that I followed the recipe
as written. This has become one of my favorite side
dishes. A 5 star recipe that is highly recommended!

Hmmm... my husband and I didn't like this at all although our 4 year old did.   I couldn't find orzo  so added penne into the sauce.  Don't know if this is what made the recipe not so tasty.

We all enjoyed this one. Had to use partial Angel hair as I only had one cup of Orzo. Just added it a bit later. Also used a bit less lime juice and extra carrots. Held up well for the next day too

I thought this was actually quite good.  I shredded the carrot but instead of shredding the zucchini I decided to cut it into slices, then cut each slice into quarters.  It was the perfect size.  I used a 14.5oz can of stewed tomatoes (I couldn't find 16 oz).  While it could have used some more liquid, I don't feel like it was too bad.  Next time I think I'll used diced tomatoes though, because the pieces of stewed tomato were just too big for the dish.  I don't know how people think this was bland.  The combo of tomato juice and lime juice was delicious and light.  This is definitely not a heavy meal.

I loved it!  I didn't use the Orzo I used a Vegetable pasta instead, cooked it first then added it to the sauce and vegetables. I thought it would be heartier using the pasta for a main entree. I never thought lime would be this good in a pasta dish!

Love this! The only changes I made were omitting the parsley, using diced tomatoes instead of stewed, using vegetable Better Than Bouillon instead of canned broth, and adding extra parmesan. The orzo definitely did not cook fully in 10 minutes of simmering. I added about a cup of extra water, turned up the heat a bit, and cooked it 5 more minutes and it was done perfectly.

I changed it a little as follows:
2 tablespoons minced garlic
4 small or 2 large unpeeled zucchini instead of just 1
2 carrots instead of 1
14.5 ounce canned italian herb stewed tomato
zest and juice from 2 small limes, or 1 large lime.

My family gobbled it up, including my picky 1 year old.  We need as much protein as we can get though so I did add chicken and used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  I have also substituted lemon juice for lime since it is difficult to find limes where we live and used red onion instead of green onion.  This is a great versatile recipe.

I love this recipe and have made it a bunch of times! I do, however,  make several variations. I tried to gear more towards veggies so I cut the orzo to 1 cup. I add shredded onions, jalapenos, and usually use 2 zuchinni. I  use reduced sodium vegetable broth and don't add lemon or lime juice. Very good, thanks to whomever originally posed this recipe.

Delicious! Just make sure your lime zest is very finely grated, or skip it altogether; otherwise you can taste its bitterness (I made this mistake). Also, when you're going back and forth between the skillet and the recipe, it would be helpful if there was more than 1 step..

This was truly delicious. It travel well with no reheating necessary. I used it as my lunch throughout a week. Everyday I did something a little different to jazz it up. One day I used parmesan to add flavor, another I used feta, another I used kalamata olives, and another I used chopped up roast chicken. Every way I tried it was delicious. I highly recommend this dish.

Good, but could use a little more flavor. Also, learn from my mistake and be careful not to overcook the veggies. I'd suggest cooking the orzo in the broth with tomatoes for a while *before* adding the carrots and zucchini. They're shredded, so they'll cook in minutes, anyway. The last few ingredients (onions, parsley, etc.) should be added just before serving. Overall, my dish was a little mushy so none of the vegetable flavors or textures came out. Still enjoyed it, and adding some crushed red pepper helped balance the lime.

First time I ever made orzo. My husband n I really enjoyed it. I used beef broth instead of water.  I didn't have green onions but still came out really good. I used  dried basil, parsley n more Italian seasoning. I used lemon juice instead of lime. Yummy n healthy.

I have this on the stove right now and I can already tell that it is going to need a lot of work.  Followed the directions exactly. Early on the orzo started to burn (the heat was on low).  Then, as the cooking progressed, I had to a lot to get any flavor out of it at all.  Its a good base, but, by following through to the end product, this would have been very bland.

A decent side dish but not as spectacular as I was expecting. Probably won't make again because all the chopping/shredding was time consuming and I felt like I was just eating rice-a-roni at the end.

Unexpectedly delicious! I'm a devoted meat-eater, but this meal left me full and satisfied. The flavors mixed very well together. The only thing is that instead of stewed tomatoes, I think regular diced tomatoes would have sufficed. The stewed tomato pieces were slightly larger than what I like.

We love it and we love it with LOTS of lime.  We usually squeeze more lime juice over it when served.  We find that the lime needs to be "refreshed" if it has been refrigerated - it seems to lose its zip quickly.

I made a mistake.  Thinking I had Orzo, I got everything together and started cooking.  When it was time to add the Orzo, it was then that I noticed I had Risotto(Italian rice) and not Orzo.  I decided to continue with Risotto and added about 1 1/2 more water and increased the cooking time. I added red pepper flakes and omitted the parsley and cheese for personal taste.   My family loved it, including my 2 yr old!  I think the flavors were perfect and yummy.

This turned out great.  I was a little leary because of the texture, but once in my mouth it was wonderful.  I will be making this again soon.

This was ok, though not really any fault of the recipe. I didn't like it with the orzo but would probably like it much better with angel hair. Definitely has a different taste if you're not used to lime. Smells great while cooking it. Might make it again.

I really likes this- very diffrent than what I usually make.  It has a light "limey" taste and even my 3 toddlers ate it!  I peeled thin strips of a zuccini and squash (I hide them!) and used a tomatoe broth as I did not have veggie.  I loved the light flavors and will make again!  God Bless!
