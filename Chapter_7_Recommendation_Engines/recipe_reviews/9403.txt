As a professional chef and graduate of NECI, I find this recipe brings back memories of what my grandmother made when I was young. This is an excellent recipe and should be tried by everyone. Just a note to those of you who had a problem with this recipe, bear in mid all recipes need adjustment depending on your oven, altitude above sea level, your individual taste, etc. I am sure with a little tweeking, this rice pudding would turn out 100% all the time.

Ok, having tried others on this site with disasterous results, this one shows the most promise!! Use 2c milk, and 1 1/4 c of COOKED rice, all else as is in the recipe.  Finally, no rice soup and a tasty dessert.

This is a great use for leftover rice from chinease take out since this recipe calls for already cooked rice...many do not.  I used a cinnamin spice blend (which I believe has nutmeg in it) and I used more than recipe called for (I LOVE cinnamin).  I also added more rice since many reviewers stated it was too much like soup.  Since I am about 1800 feet above sea level and have a 20+ year old wall oven, I usually have to adjust my baking times, so I baked this a full hour.  I also used another reviewers hint and tested for "doneness" with a knife inserted in the middle.  The recipe turned out yummy, and I will keep it on hand for future rice leftovers.  

I would be more apt to call it a rice pudding casserole...if you are thinking of pudding consistency, it isn't like that, and you will be disappointed. It seems to have more of a custard consistency when cooked completely through.

If you are hesitant to try this based on other reviews, please keep in mind that every recipe, even recipes from world famous chefs, need to be adjusted for personal taste. Would I give him a bad review simply because his dish was too spicy, no way!  

I overlook poor ratings that are based on personal preference (such as "too bland, too sweet, too spicy, too moist, too dry".

After reading the reviews that said this recipe is too soupy I adjusted the milk.  Instead of using a quart of milk, I used 1 (12 oz.) can of evaporated milk and 1/2 cup of 2% milk.  The pudding came out thick and creamy.  I do disagree with those who say it is too sweet...I think it would taste better with a little bit more sugar, but I have a HUGE sweet tooth!

I used long grain brown and wild rice, spenda in place of sugar and skim milk changing the measurements to 2 C milk, 1 1/4 C rice, 1/2 C splenda.  This is a delicious recipe!  I baked mine for 40 minutes at 350 turning out beautifully set and I ate it guilt-free!

My family and I are avid rice pudding eaters. But this has got to be the WORST recipe I have ever tasted. Like other reviews mentioned: it looked bad, no flavor, too soupy, and too sweet. Bottom line...DON'T WASTE YOUR GROCERIES ON THIS ONE!!!

Rice soup.  Good flavor though.  I like my rice pudding more dence so at 30 min. I added a packet of instant vanilla pudding and cooked for anouther 30 or so min.  Word of advise just check on it every 20 min or so and do the knife test... if it comes out clean get the spoon and a bowl and take some to the kids.  Oh I also used soy milk instead of the cow milk and wild rice so it had more color and flavor to it.  Yum

I should have read more reviews before making this.....I think the recipe was written incorrectly.   The rice should NOT be cooked.  It MIGHT have set up with uncooked rice, but even though I added more rice (my gut told me to) and cooking for an extra 20 minutes.....it's still in the oven but I doubt it will ever thicken no matter how long I cook it.

This is one time "Mom" needs a new cookbook.  As everyone else has said...this is rice soup.  I followed the recipe and there is WAY too much milk in here.  I added cinnamon to the mix and cooked it 70 minutes and still to have soup.  Ran to Jewel afterwards (our local grocery store chain) and had real tasty rice pudding.

Not quite as good as my Mom's, but not bad either.  Added a little cinnamon and raisins - then baked close to an hour.  And a little less milk than called for in the recipe.  Darned good.  Sue, tell your Mom "good job."

Good basic recipe and easy to modify into a great one. By substituting 1/2 of the milk with unsweetened coconut milk, using basmati rice and adding a splash of Malibu coconut rum, it became a coconut lovers dream and a hit at the Super Bowl party. Some toasted shredded coconut on top didn't hurt either. I'll definitely use the recipe again.

This never "jelled" for me. I think it needs more rice or less liquid. Very disappointing.

After reading the reviews I added an additional half cup of rice and it turned out great.  Needed a little more sugar, at least half a cup.  Great taste, light and fluffy.

This is one of the only rice pudding recipes I've seen with cooked rice, which is great for leftovers. I cut way back on the milk and a little on the sugar. It was very nice.

This is fantastic.  I read the reviews and did what 1 person said about using evaporated milk and 2% milk.  Mine was NOT soupy at all!!!!   We like cinnamon so I added that.  I will be making this again!! Yum

This recipe was very good. There was in fact to much milk but if you add 1 extra cup of cooked rice and 1 extra egg you have a great rice pudding.

This surely was written wrong.  It had too much liquid for the rice.  I did add more rice after it had cooked longer than the time recommended on the recipe and I saw it was never going to set up.  The taste was ok after I finally finished with it but it was not a good recipe.  I gave it one star just for the taste.  I will read reviews before I start with another recipe.

I was in a hurry and now wish I would have read the reviews before I wasted my time and leftover rice! This was hands down the worst recipe I have ever used from this site. This recipe should be taken off of here so othef people don't make the same mistake. If given the option I wouls have give it 0 stars.

Pudding tasted great, but luckily I did add extra rice because I thought that would be too much milk....So, I added extra rice, and halved the white sugar, and made the other half of the sugar called for brown sugar....also, since we love cinnamon so much, I added a lot of cinnamon into the pudding, not just a sprinkling on top....Rice pudding, great stuff!!!!!!!!

I agree that this recipe was too soupy. I decreased the milk to 3 cups and used 1 1/3 cups rice, it was still too soupy. Definitely didn't look like the picture. I will be sticking with my moms recipe.

Great recipe I added 3/4 cups sugar and the next time I will cut back on the milk. After the 40 minutes the pudding didn't set as well as I liked but after a few extra minutes and some cool down time......it was great.

I can't imagine what the other reviewers were thinking when they gave this great reviews - they must not have ever had truly good rice pudding before. Did anyone ACTUALLY make this recipe before reviewing it?  I did - don't waste your time or ingredients.

I wish I had read the reviews before I tried this version of "rice pudding"...lesson learned.  I did save the dish by thickening with 2 tsp of corn starch diluted w/ carmel coffee creamer.  Still was not as good as "Mom's".

My pudding turned out very runny.  disappointing.  Maybe something is missing from the directions.  It seemed like a lot of liquid for the one cup of rice.  I ended up with a bowl of hot milk mixture and very little rice.

Tasted like scrambled eggs and rice even when made with less milk and longer baking time as suggested. Not creamy at all. Try another recipe.

I loved the way my pudding came out.  I reviewed some of the other suggestions and decided to use 24 oz of evaporated milk with 4 oz of soy milk.  I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and a handful of raisins.  I baked for about 55 minutes.  I stirred after 20 minutes but i don't think i will do that next time since it disrupts the nice nutmeg toppping.  The custard came out perfectly and the raisins added enough extra sweetness.

After reading all the reviews, I used 2 cups of milk and 1 1/4 cup rice. I cooked it for 1 hour. It was perfect. I also sprinkled cinnamon on the top.

I tossed in a couple of mashed bananas, sprinkled it with cinnamon. It was well received by most of my five children.  I doubled the recipe, so I found I had to cook it about 20 minutes longer; however, it seemed to set up fine with the extra cooking time.

Blah! Ended up with rice soup, even after an hour of baking.  Ladled off 2 cups of liquid, then baked another 40 minutes, at which point it was passable (but not as good as other rice puddings).  I thought it was me - this was my first time making rice pudding, and I thought it would be a fun way to try using up some leftovers.  Pass this one up!

A wonderful creamy, custard-like rice pudding. I increased the rice to about 1 1/3 cups, decreased the milk to 3 cups, and added ten minutes to the cook time. There was a tiny bit of extra liquid, so next time I would cook for 1 hour, but the taste was great!

I didn't care for this recipe.  I'm not familiar with rice pudding recipies, but does this call for too much milk?  In all fairness, I must admit that I did not use whole milk.

Came out of the oven looking fine, but was watery and nasty looking inside.
Way to sweet.
  P.S.  I'm a retired fellow, just learning to cook. So maybe I screwed up?

I followed this recipe mostly to a "t" and it turned out perfectly.  I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 cup raisins just before baking.  Not sure why the other reviewers' had trouble with this recipe but I recommend it.

I was looking for a recipe that used cooked rice. After reading several reviews, I used 2 1/4 cups milk and probably 1 1/2 cups rice - I just dumped in what I had. Everything else the same. Sprinkled the top with Pampered Chef Cinnamon Blend. We loved it. I forgot to stir after 20 minutes, so the edges were custardy, which I didn't mind. It was done perfectly in 40 minutes. I'd like to give it 5 stars, as it was just what I was looking for. But, as written, I'm afraid it would be far too soupy.

This recipe turned out great! Pudding was not soupy. I cooked only for 20 min total and let sit for 20 min. But I Used 2 cups of milk and 2 1/4 cup of Rice. And 1/4 Cup of Brown sugar and Another 1/4 of sugar. So I did change it a little But even My BF who Hates Rice Pudding Ate some and Liked it!! Good Recipe

Tasty! Follow the adjustments from Laura's comment in 2007 and it comes out just right (2 c milk, 1.25 c cooked rice). Since I used leftover rice that had been seasoned, I left out the salt in this recipe. 

Also, I recommend tempering the eggs by adding a small amount of hot rice mixture to the beaten eggs and slowly adding tempered eggs to the main pot of rice.

I used this recipe today (as practice since I dont present anything I'm havent tried yet). It was wonderful. I was a little skeptical of ALL the milk. But it turned out wonderfully. One of the main things was SLOWLY adding the eggs and put the oven on 375 for the first 15-20 minutes and then about 325 for the remaining 35 minutes. Mine came out considerably think (not creamy as I thought) but not bread-thick. I'm happy with my results.

This set up nicely and I used 4 cups of whole milk, but my problem was it wasnt't sweet enough and tasted too eggy so I added 1/2 cup brown sugar also and pinch of cinnamon. I think the people who ended up with soup didn't scald their milk properly. I googled it and followed to the letter. Delicious!

I believe the recipe should read 1 cup rice, cooked, which makes 2 or so cups of cooked rice.  You will get rice soup if you don't use white rice (you need the starch), real butter, real eggs and whole milk (all for the fats needed to combine with the starch to thicken it)  Better yet use 3 cups whole milk, 1 cup half and half.  Stir every 15 minutes and up the cooking time to an hour.  I add presoaked jumbo raisins at the 45 minute mark.  The recipe as is rates a 4.  I think my changes make it a 5.

I had already started baking it before reading the reviews about it being soupy. I noticed it was soupy and became concerned so I read the reviews. I added 2/3 cups more rice and baked it for 10 more minutes and it turned out delicious! If you still want a large amount I would suggest doing this instead of reducing the milk. It also probably leveled out the sweetness which people were also commenting on.

Way to soupy, I noticed it right away as I was making it.  I just added more rice and raisins and some cinamon.  Gave it some flavor.  Not a good recipe you will need to fix it.

This recipes needs some help.  I only used half the milk (2 cups) and I baked for an extra 10 minutes (50 minutes total).  With these two small changes, it is a very easy recipe that uses ingredients that most people have on hand and is very good!

This consistency was perfect... I only added 1/4 cup of rice.  I used 1/4 white sugar & 1/4 brown sugar, 2 tsp cinnamon and freshly ground nutmeg.  Came out AMAZING. All my friends loved it.

At high altitude this does not work. It also needed a teaspoon of vanilla for taste and some salt.  I had to stir after the one hour, then cook another 20 minutes and then another 20 minutes before it set up as a pudding. Once that was all done it was great.

If you like the traditional dense and creamy rice pudding, this most definitely NOT the recipe you want to use.  I tried it twice and twice I was greatly disappointed.

I should have read other reviews before making this one....way too much milk! I could only serve it to my 12 month old son and even then I had to dish it out with a slotted spoon to drain the liquid away. Good flavour though and it was easy to make.

I was looking for a recipe that called for cooked rice instead of mine which calls for uncooked. Thanks to the review that said use 2 C milk mine did not turn out too runny. But the rice ended up breaking down into a watery mess. In the end though my boyfriend and his friends ate it up and loved it. I guess that is what matters!

Instead of one cup rice, I added an additional cup which was probably one cup too many.  I'll try again with one cup and see what happens.  The flavoring was perfect.  Am looking for a "custard" outcome.  Will continue experimenting.  5 stars

This makes a huge amount of rice pudding. Also, I did not have a 2 quart baking dish (?!) so put it in a 13x9 pan. It was pretty soupy but it tasted good. My grandpa enjoyed it.

READ the reviews.  Almost everyone who gave it a high rating completely modified the recipe.  I am an avid baker and cook.  This was a soupy mess.  It was not good at all.  I'm sure I would've liked it, too.... IF I'd changed half the recipe....

Other than that I sprinkled Nutmeg on top

I used two cups of cooked rice instead of one cup (I used brown because that’s what I had on hand, but you really couldn’t tell), and I used four eggs instead of two I baked for about one hour total till not quite set. The 2 Qt casserole was full to the brim. It came out delicious though - the soft custard pudding of my childhood, only slightly sweet. I also threw in a few yellow raisins. I love this dessert and I actually think it’s relatively healthy.

Just made this, has very good flavor.  I did add extra rice but it did not get thick, in fact it looks like the eggs and milk separated. Very watery.  Maybe cause I used 2 % milk ?  I'll eat it but not what I expected.

I loved the texture and flavor but after serving one portion there was alot of watery liquid also so I covered it and put it back in the oven for another 40 minutes and it's still watery but also good. I think the rice should be uncooked to absorb it.

Like the other reviews, discovered rice to milk ratio is off.  I made it a 3 cups brown rice to 1 quart milk ratio because I wanted a little more. I made the rice in the rice cooker and put it in the food processor with a little bit of the milk to make it more creamy.  I added 2 tbsp of butter and  I seasoned with all spice, a little bit of cinnamon and clover. I also increased the bake time to 50 minutes until the top was a little more brown and served it warm.  After it was done my husband, daughter and I loved it! They couldn't even tell it was BROWN rice instead of white.

Yes, this was milk soup.  I thoght it would firm up as it cooled, but no luck.  I have added Bird's custard powder and popped it back in the oven.  I hope it turns out better....

Loved  this recipe but the photo showed raisins and I did add them. We have always used raisins in our pudding so I thought maybe someone forgot to add it to the recipe.

My mom used to make rice pudding when I was very young. She baked hers, so that's what I did with this recipe. Also, I was a little more generous with the nutmeg (1/2 tsp), then added a tbs of Cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of Cardimom. I baked it in a glass pan at 375 degrees for about 45 minutes to an hour (or until it's firm). I recommend this recipe twist.

READING, or rather, comprehending is KEY. Used 1 cup of UNCOOKED rice then after it was in the oven, I was pursuing the comments and read one they suggested using leftover rice since it called for COOKED rice!! I was floored and worried what would happen. Searched through other recipes until I found one with uncooked rice and I changed the cook temp to mirror it (300•) and the time to 1-1/2 hours. The ingredients were slighy different

I love this!!  This is like what my mom used to make.  Thank you for such an easy rice pudding.  I did use more rice, cinnamon, and vanilla, but it was not soupy at all, it was perfect!

The pudding recipe has potential. I would try this recipe again, but add more sugar and vanilla and bake it for at least an hour. Forty minutes just isn't enough time.

I used 2 c cooked brown rice, 4 c milk, 3 eggs, 3/4 c sugar, 2 tsp vanilla and about 2 tsp cinnamon and a handful of raisins.  I added the raisins about half way through cooking.

I absolutly loved this recipe. After reading a few of the comments and already knowing what my desired texture and flavor was I made a few adjustments. Instead of using 1 qt milk I used 1 (12 oz) can evaporated milk and 1/2 c. whole milk. I also used a little less than 3/4 c. sugar and I added raisins (i think mine would've been absolutly perfect without the raisins though!!) I also baked it for 50 minutes.. stiring every 20 minutes and I sprinkled a little more nutmeg ontop when finished!! Hope this helps anyone looking for tips on this recipe! All in all the flavor and warmth of this recipie reminds me of Autumn!

This isn't anything fancy, it is simple old-fashion rice pudding. I had to bake mine for about 10-15 minutes longer but it turned out great! It also thickens up a bit while cooling so keep that in mind if you make it!

This was a great recipe that I was happy to use my leftover Chinese rice in.  I made this rice pudding this morning and did make a few modifications.  First, I used 1 C brown Rice and 1C Quinoa (cooked), 2C of 2%milk, 1tbls honey, and the rest of the original recipe stayed the same.  It came out very good; however, I would use less sugar in mine the next time I make it.  Overall, yummy and a- make-again dessert!

The great thing about this recipe is that it uses already cooked rice.  It was creamy, but a little thin.
