This was fast and easy. Next time I will add in some minced fresh onion and garlic. I will also increase the seasoning amount.

I thought were great.  I just eyeballed the seasoning.  Much easier and better tasting then the ones I normally make. Instead of a few different spices, just one.   I topped with grilled onions.  I will make my burgers this way from now on.

These were very flavorful and we loved the Gouda!  The kids did great with this recipe.

Simple basic burger recipe, but they are nothing to rave about.  We added grilled teriyaki mushrooms to ours and the mushrooms really over powered the hamburger.
