This is a really good pie but I think it needs more pineapple. The next time I make this I will use a 15oz. can of pineapple & get back with you.

A nice light dessert. I used Cool Whip light and 15 oz. of crushed pineapple. Fiance (who only likes desserts with chocolate) loved this. 

I had no problems with the chilling.

I made the filling for this pie but spooned it into 2 packs of 15 mini phyllo tart shells, then topped each one with half of a maraschino cherry.  These were great!  Easy to grab and go for party situations and not so much mess.  Very refreshing flavor and easy!  Just make sure not to stuff the tart shells too much in advance because they can become soggy.  Thanks for the post!!

Thank you, cookntaste, for your review! Husband forgot he had an office do today, and I had 30mins to come up with a dessert. I had all the ingredients on hand, so I threw this together. The only thing I did differently was to add a few sliced maraschino cherries and sliced almonds for decoration. Apparently, it was a hit. Thank you!

The taste of the pie was simply delicious, but it was a total flop.  I took this to a luncheon and was totally embarrassed.  It wouldn't stay together long enough to even put it on the plate!  Definitely have this sit in the refrigerator at least overnight, not 3 hours!!
