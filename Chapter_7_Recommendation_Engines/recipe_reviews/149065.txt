These had a great taste but did not turn out right at all! It might have been that fact that I did not have any shortening so I used butter instead. When they cooked they spread out so much that they oozed together into one giant very flat mess! They still tasted good and I liked the different textures - the chewy of the bran and the coconut and then the sweetness of the craizins (oh, I didn't have cherries so I used orange flavored craizins). If anyone knows why my cookies spread out and were so loose, please let me know! I even tried using a mini muffin tin for a batch and an 8x8 pan but still no good!
