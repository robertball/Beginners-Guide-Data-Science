I dont usually rate a recipe that I altred, but based on other reviews, I made two changes. One, I seasoned the fish to my liking BEFORE the flour, that way the fish got seasoned, not the coating. Second, I cooked the fish in the oven the way I do ovwen fried chicken. I heat up the pan in the oven first, and aadd whatever oil or butter I want to use ( usually a combination ) Then I added the  fish. Cooked it halfway thru, then flipped it over to finish cooking. Both sides get crispy, the fish gets cooked before it burns. My husband and I both enjoyed it.

My husband and I sat in stunned silence as our normaly fussy 4yr old gobbled this fish up.  His only request to us was "try your dinner it's good" and he was right.  We did add season salt to the flour as suggested by other members

This deserves 10 stars. It so moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside. I love the oatmeal. Why didn't I ever think of this. By far the best fish I have ever made.

Made this tonight for my family, mostly because I didn't have the ingredients to make another recipe. I'm glad now. This was a very easy to make, delicious fish. The oats added a nice crunch. (Will it also counter the cholestrol in the vegetable oil?) I added about 1/2 tsp. Old Bay seasoning to the flour for extra flavoring. Next time, I'll add more seasoning to the flour. It's a keeper.

Great change of pace.  I used walleye brought back from Canada and it turned out fabulous.  The flour before the egg/milk really helped coat the fish and stick the oats.  Nice heavy coating gave the fish a wonderful texture, almost nutty.  Everyone loved it even the picky 3yr old.  When I make this again I will probably add some seasoning to the mix as that was the only thing lacking.

I pulsed the oatmeal in the food processor to make it a little finer. Nice and crunchy...make sure your oil is nice and hot before dropping in the fish.

This was a nice, crunchy alternative to regular fried fish. Note: If you want this to be flavourful, put plenty of spices in the flour, egg mixture, and oats. I used salt, pepper, garlic powder and Old Bay Seasoning.

This was delicious!  Thanks very much!  Add whatever seasoning you like, to make it a bit more flavorful.  I also fried for longer so it got deep brown and very crunchy.  I made it with a different fish.  Try this!!!!

I actually found a very similar recipe like this on the allrecipes australia site (I just did a google search for 'low carb fish coating, and that recipe showed up), but it wouldn't let me sign in with my u.s. allrecipes login - so I'm rating this recipe instead since this recipe is the same :)  I really like using the oats for the coating - it turned out very nice and crunchy!  I did alter the recipe by using Old Bay Seasoning (very tasty mix, if you haven't tried it) instead of salt and pepper, and added it to the oats.  Nice knowing it is low in carbs, and tastes great as well!!

This was pretty good.  I added a mix of herbs to the flour and topped it with shredded Parmesan cheese.  Next time I will chop the oats up a bit (doesn't need much) and maybe mix the cheese into the breading.  I'll also try baking it.  This would translate well to other fish.

As-is it's pretty bland, it definitely needs something added to the breading. This was the first time I've tried coating in flour before egg & breading and it worked much better than everything I've done in the past. 

I used tilapia and sole filets and served it with a bourbon honey mustard sauce.

This was awesome- but I made a few changes.  In the egg/milk mixture, I added 1/4 cup of pure maple syrup because I wanted a sweet flavor.  Instead of cod, I used halibut.  To cook, I baked it in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes.  I also made a maple syrup/butter drizzle (1/4 cup maple syrup & 1 tablespoon butter) to put over it.  Finally, I broiled it for a couple of minutes at the end to make it crispy.  It was AMAZING-- my boyfriend said that it was better than the granola-crusted fish from a local restaurant that I was trying to replicate!

It was more like 3.5... it would have been better if I had cooked it hotter maybe.  Some of the coating fell off and the fish got a bit oily.  The flavor is there though.

Our family really enjoyed this. It was mild enough for the kids, nice texture for the adults. We whipped up some homemade tartar sauce and it made a super meal. Thanks!

This was a great change from breaded fish. Will try this with other fish. I didn't have enough of vegtable oil so I used 1/2 peanut oil and 1/2 canola and it gave the fish a nutty flavor. Will add this to my recipe box.

Delicious recipe. I searched for a simple oatmeal-fried fish recipe and found this after my friend in Scotland told me to use oatmeal to fry my fish instead of cornmeal for a change. I bought some very nice cod fillets and followed recipe exact, the only thing I did different was use Lawrys Garlic-Salt mixed into the oatmeal. Was grand! And much healthier and even better than panko crumbs! I will try this with Rockfish next.

Disappointed in taste; I didn't like how it just tasted like oatmeal and fish.  I added tonnes of spices but still the oatmeal taste was most prominent.

S-A-T-I-S-F-I-E-D is the only way to describe how I feel after eating this!Yum! I have tried lots of cod recipes, but was never able to find the perfect one, until now. To make mine a tad healthier, I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour, and put just enough extra virgin olive oil in the skillet to help it not stick. The olive oil will help you get your Omega-6's to go along with the Omega-3's in the fish! A side of steamed broccoli with a sprinkle of parmesan on top was the perfect side dish for me. Can't wait to impress my boyfriend with this one!

Oat crust didn't stay on the fish after pan frying it.  No flavor came through even I took the advice of others who put seasoning on before the oat coating.

A truly delicious recipe for fish. Very quick and easy for such a nice recipe. We had it for supper, tonight and already my husband has said several times how much he enjoyed the fish. Will certainly be made again around here, and will try different types of fish with this nice crunchy coating.

DELICIOUS! Easy to make, too! Cook fish over medium heat - medium/high cooks it too fast. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I seasoned the fish with salt, pepper and garlic powder before coating in flour - makes it much more flavorful. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing.

Loved the oatmeal on the fish!  Even without changing the recipe, I would give it a 4 1/2 stars.  As others posted, I seasoned my fish prior to the dipping in flour/egg.  I also broiled the fish on low in an oiled pan.  Delicious!  My second batch, I still had some oatmeal and egg left, so I dipped the fish a second time in egg and oatmeal.  I actually liked it even better. (I love oatmeal!)

I thought this was REALLY REALLY GOOD.  I loved how crispy it turned out.  And to be honest, the fact that there is something sort of healthy in the breading made me feel like it wasn't so bad frying it up. :)  The only thing I would do next time is maybe put some salt and/or seasoning in with the flour.  I'm not a big "frying" person, but I was really impressed!  I thought it would be pretty boring.

A healthy alternative to fish and chips.  No problem with the oatmeal falling off, however...  I was disappointed with the taste.  The oatmeal didn't have much taste, and I should have added more salt.  I was loathe to sprinkle the finished filets with salt and tried to add salt to the egg batter.  Not enough.  Probably won't make this again.  I kept having to add oil to the pan as well, as the oatmeal absorbed it.

This was so delicious.  Crunchy coating and moist tender fish.  I added Old Bay to the flour for some more spice.  Will make again!!

It looked beautiful and was easy to make, but it was a little bland.  I'd add salt and pepper directly to the flour or egg/milk mixture in the future.

I used this recipe tonight and its phenomenal. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and seasoned before coating in flour. I seasoned it with Cajun seasoning,followed the instructions and fried it till golden. My boyfriend who dislikes fish ate it up and asked for seconds. I look forward to using this recipe often. :D

I was SO disappointed with this recipe. I've had really good experiences with this website, but this particular recipe was, sadly, bland and gross. Neither my kids nor my husband or enjoyed this dish in the least. My husband and I ate it obligatorily.

This was very easy to make and delicious!  I did follow the recommendation to season the flour..I added salt, garlic powder and a little bit of paprika.  I also used Cod and it came out perfect - quick and easy.

Turned out great, though am not one to fry fish (or anything else) often.  Nice variation on coating using oatmeal.  Will try other reviewer's tips on baking next time.

I have NEVER had breading turn out so well.  Added season salt to the flour like others suggested.  Family loved it.  Used the left over flour, egg wash and oats with 1/2 tsp of backing powder to make hush puppies and they were good too.

I Love this fish. The oats gave it a great crunch and a unique flavor. I did add some cajun seasoning and a little paprika but tons of black pepper. My 6 year old liked it too. Great easy and quick!

I added kosher salt and pepper to the oats before coating the fish.  My kids couldn't get enough of this!  So easy to make and delicious.  I was drawn to this recipe since the oatmeal makes it healthier; a definite keeper in our house.

I really liked this recipe.  It was crispy and tasted great.  I added some Emeril seasoning to the flour for flavor, but followed the rest as posted.  Would definitely make it again!

It took a lot longer than the prescribed time.  It would have helped if we had thinner pieces of fish.  It was relatively easy, but we found that the coating burned before the fish was cooked.  It tasted great though!

This is really a great recipe.   I read some of the reviews and then followed the recipe as written taking into account the suggestions to season your fish as the first step after you dry off your fish.  This is critical. I used some seafood seasoning, chili powder and black pepper. Then followed along with the flour, then egg/milk and finally the oatmeal and into the hot oil.  I did not have quick cooking oats so I ground up some old fashioned oats. The cooking time is spot on, but you have to take into account how thick your fillets are and keep an eye on them.

I was a little suspicious of how the oatmeal would cook, but it was fine. It needed some other seasonings, though.

Have made this dish before from a recipe in an Irish Cookbook.  The cookbook recipe used herring. I’ve tried it with mackerel and Black Sea Bass.  I fry the coated fillets in butter which creates a nutty toasted oat flavor.  I like a little malt vinegar sprinkled on mine.

This turned out way better than I thought. I used barramundi for the fish and added coconut flakes and crushed walnuts to the oats. I was very pleased with the way everything turned out

Love the oat breading! Followed the recipe, aside from more pan frying than deep frying and seasoned the fish with salt and pepper before coating with the flour.  There was more than enough egg and milk, but we needed more flour and oats for our big fillets.
