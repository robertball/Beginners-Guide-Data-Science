Thought this was OK, but I really was missing the strawberry flavor in this smoothie.  In the future, I will double the strawberries and use vanilla Greek yogurt which should bring this up to my personal taste expectations.   And this is not to say that there's anything wrong with the recipe, it's just that it tasted too much like chocolate milk and less like a fruity smoothie to me.

I love all the protein this smoothie has in it. I used chocolate almond milk (which I made) and then proceeded with the rest of the ingredients, including frozen strawberries not fresh ones. I like this. It just needed a little extra sweetener for me.
