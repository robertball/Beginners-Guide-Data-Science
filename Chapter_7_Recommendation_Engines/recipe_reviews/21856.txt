No crepe recipe should use baking powder as crepes are not meant to rise.  Perhaps there's a confusion of definition here?

I can't believe I forgot to rate this recipe. I have been using it for months. I use only 1/4 cup sugar, and 2 tsp. baking powder. I add an extra 1/2 cup milk....otherwise, they are too much like pancakes. Anyhow, I love it with my modifications.:-)

These taste amazing -  and the easiest I have ever prepared.  I served with a variety of things, bananas, strawberries w/honey, peach ice cream, vanilla ice cream - everyone made their own it was FANTASTIC!!

Great Recipe. My kids love it!!! I increased the milk to 2 1/2 cups(so it wasn't like pancakes) and decreased the baking powder to 2 tsp and it is fantastic! Mixing it in the blender was a perfect idea...it makes the clean-up so easy...thanks!

In general the recipe wasn't bad. However, I thought there was a little too much sugar for my tastes. 
Also, it did take me a few tries to get the hang of the right amount of batter to pour into the pan.  I thought this recipe was rather time consuming, thought I think if you plan on taking the time and want to make something more "special" this recipe is worth it.

This is a great crepe recipe. I can eat straight off the pan, totally plain. My friends like it even more with another 1/4 cup of sugar.

i made these this morning. i followed the recipe exactly how it said. when i poured the batter into the pan and spread it around it still rose and ended up being very thick. so i just said forget it and i made them like pancakes. they were a little too sweet and my god 3/4 cup of sugar is alot but i did it anyway.  they were pretty good i ate 4 full sized 9 inchers. if you add a little mor milk they could be crepes. would rather say 3.5 stars but there isnt that option. give them i shot.

this was SO fun and easy to make, which is saying something, since i'm usually a terrible cook. i took RUBYWIFE's advice on the ingredients, and it worked out just fine. i did manage to make way more that six of them, though, much to my delight.

Way too much sugar. Crepes should be plain, then the filling makes it dessert or main course.

I love this recipe, I have tried many crepe recipes and I happen to favor this one. I make a few minor adjustments to enhance the flavor and texture: add 1/2 teaspoon salt to the recipe, add another 1/4 to 1/2 cup milk or water to make the batter thinner (let's face it, a fat crepe is still a pancake) and I use real butter melted in the pan, not lightly, generously because the butter really adds to the flavor of the crepe. These are really good with sugared strawberries , Bavarian cream, and melted chocolate drizzled over the top.

I made this recipe against my better judgement.  I decreased the baking powder and the sugar, and they were still too puffy and too sweet.  The batter was so sticky I had to re-butter the pan with every "crepe."  Not worth modifying, there are much better recipes out there.  If you want the pancake equivalent of a twinkie, this may be for you.

I will use this recipe forever! I have a family recipe that is much more complicated than this, so shoving all the ingredients in the blender, letting it sit for a minute for the bubbles to rise out of it, and then i cook the first side of the crepe then flip it, and then i start piling on stuff like cheese, sandwich meat, spinach, olives mushrooms, mayo, tomatoes, avocado, lettuce you name it! then roll it up a little and serve a awesome crepe sandwich! It's a hit with everyone i know! they want me to come to their house and cook! haha Also i switch it up a bit and put peaches and whip cream or apple pie filling with powdered sugar you name it. crepes are endless for ideas! thank you so much for the super easy recipe. I make a batch and keep the left over batter in the blender pitcher and stick it in the fridge! use it for two days! easy as yum!

Very good recipe.  My son made it for a school project.  It was very easy, did not stick to the pan at all.  I agree with other reviewers that it is not a traditional crepe, however it made for an awesome dessert.  I would not, however use this recipe for a main dish, it is much too sweet for that.

Not a bad recipe but i should have read the reviews first.  It has way too much sugar and is definitely more of a pancake.  With variations it isn't a bad recipe at all.

Used 1/2 cup sugar, and 2 tsp baking powder.  Still very pancake'y, in taste and aesthetic.  Okay, but nothing to write home about.

this was the best alternative to just pancakes. only problem was that they were hard to turn and I had to add more flour to make the batter thicker. this is also good with chopped veggies.

Followed suggestions and reduced to 1/4 c sugar and 2 t powder. These came out as very thin pancakes/thick crepes. I rolled half around frozen berries, and the other half around fresh mango. Delicious!

Great tasting recipe!  However, I did find it a bit thick and added a little extra liquid to get it to a thinner consistency.  I believe I would try a little less sugar next time.  Tasted great alone but was a bit too sweet once fruit and bit of creme freche was added.  Suggestion:  Use just a bit of chocolate ganache sauce on top once the crepe is rolled.

My husband and I thought this recipes was great. So fast and simple. I added a tsp of cinnamon and a pinch of ginger,cloves and nutmeg topped them with syrup and voila. Im adding this at a later date because I really think this recipe should come with an addiction warning. Hubby and I have been eating these almost ever night as a snack. Not good for the waistline but oh so yummy. We have had them with fruit, syrup, apple butter. Made them plain, spiced and even mixed chopped fruit into the batter. So my advice to you is "make with caution".
Enjoy!!

I LOVE CREPES AND THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME MAKING THEM. I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE AS IT READS, AND I'M NOT SURE IF I DID SOMETHING WRONG OR I JUST NEED TO PRACTICE A LITTLE MORE. I DID READ OTHER REVIEWS THAT SUGGESTED NO OR LITTLE BAKING SODA, AND MAYBE MORE MILK. I'M NOT GIVING UP I WILL TRY IT AGIAN WITH A FEW LITTLE AJUSTMENT. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE....

It needs major adjustment.  
2 cups flour
2 cups milk
1/3-1/2 cup sugar
2-3 eggs (depends on size)
Vanilla extract ( I put lots)
Mix untill runny. Add more milk if needed. Preheat electic skillet (easier to flip)
Add butter to skillet. Pour batter ( I mix all in big measure cup or juice jug) pour onto skillet and tilt so batter runs outwards...flip when dry (ish) top and only cook other side couple seconds....sprinkle with icing sugar or surop n butter serve.....

I used a little less sugar and they were great that way. Loved how soft and fluffy they turned out. Definitely making these again.

As far as taste and texture, these are simply thin pancakes; tasty but pancakes nonetheless. They lack that spongy, eggy texture of crepes.

If I were to change the recipe, I would've added another 1/2 cup of milk. I found it wasn't as thin as I would've liked. Overall though, they were delicious and quite easy to make.
