I hate giving this such a low rating but everyone complained about the celery, even celery lovers - like myself. When I was preparing this I knew that the celery would be a bit crunchy since it was cooking for such a short time-and I was right.  I had increased this to serve 12 since it sounded so good- but got lots of celery comments!!  Like - "Rita, was there a sale on celery?". Celery lovers - this soup is for you.  Like others I did substitute spinach for lettuce and angel hair pasta for Ramen noodles since I ran out of ramen. If you use angel hair you can put the pasta in this soup with the chicken and then cook it for 2 min. when it comes to a boil.  Angel hair is always a good substitution for ramen noodles (break the pasta in half).

We enjoyed this very much. Did make a few changes though. I added sliced dried garlic and chopped fresh mushrooms. Instead of lettuce, I used chopped fresh spinach-the taste was great, and stirred in 2 fresh eggs at the end ( like an egg drop soup). I only used 1 1/2 tsp of Asian chili paste and believe me that was HOT enough! I used wun tun noodles,  but served the soup OVER them. It works very well over rice too.  This soup had a wonderful flavour. Will make again. Thanks for sharing.

I made this for lunch today and LOVED it! I eliminated the sugar and used spinach instead of the lettuce. Thanks Sara!

Yay!  Thanks for a wonderful tasty healthy soup with a great authentic taste.  I didn't have lettuce so used chard I had.  And I only had Thai style green curry paste and half a Tb. of that was just hot enough for us.  Otherwise, didn't add or change the amounts of ingredients.  Recommended.

My family and I really enjoyed this soup.  It was very tasty.  Since I didn't have any lettuce, I used a hand full of frozen spinach instead.

I browned my chicken in a skillet beforehand because I like my chicken that way but that is the only change I made. I was very impressed with this soup for how easy it was to make. I might have made a mistake though because I used the season packet from the ramen and now I am not seeing where it says to do so in the directions. Regardless it was good and super easy. Next time I will try it without and see how that goes. I really liked all of the crunch the celery gave.

I like the idea of eating ramen noodles differently.  However, it's a bit salty for me.  I reduced the amount of soy sauce to my taste buds.  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is really good.  I was skeptical about the lettuce, it didn't make a lot of sense to me to put cold lettuce in hot soup, so I used spinach like other reviewers and it was actually really good.  Along with celery I added mushrooms and yellow onions.  Upon reading a review that the celery was too crunchy, I cooked all the vegtables with the oil and spices, before adding the chicken or the chicken broth so they wouldn't be so crunchy.  Also, I have never had luck finding chile paste at the grocery store, so I substituted it with sweet chile sauce and it worked great.  I used ramen noodles but might try spaghetti noodles next time.  This is a nice recipe to make if you have extra vegetables you don't know what to do with, as this recipe could be made using a lot more vegetables than it calls for.  It smells good and tastes great.

I had tons of lettuce growing in my garden and was looking for something (other than salad) to do with it. This soup turned out really good - I will be making it again. I used way more lettuce than the recipe called for, and I think it was better that way - lots of fresh crushed garlic also. I used red curry paste to taste (probably about a teaspoon) instead of the chili paste (I wasn't sure what that was), and definitely don't forget the tumeric.

I made this according to the reviews.  I substituted spinach for lettuce, and yellow onion for green, and I cut back to 1 tsp of chile paste (the kind I have is extremely spicy).  I also doubled the amount of broth, as I didn't think it would be soupy enough for my tastes.  The broth of this soup was to die for.  What a wonderful taste!  I loved this soup, and so did my husband.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is delicious as a base and lends itself to all kinds of variations: beef, shrimp, etc. Chop the celery fine and add it early on and it will have a chance to cook completely. I added 1 carrot finely chopped, as well.

I think this recipe has great potential, however, I used the 2 tablespoons of chile paste as the recipe stated and almost choked to death from the spiciness!  I will try this recipe again, but will only use 1/2 teaspoon of the paste if any (and I love spicy foods!)

This soup is fantastic! I used spinach in place of lettuce just because it's what I already had.  There was just enough kick.  The celery is not overbearing and if you wait to eat the soup after it's been refrigeratedd for a day, it's even better!

Pretty good.  I followed other's suggestion and only put in a smidge of chili paste (actually, I only had curry on hand, but same dif in terms of spicy factor).  I didn't have turmeric, either.  Only used two tsps (rather than tablespoons) of sesame oil and it was fine.  Lots of chopping and pulling stuff out of cupboards but if you're in the mood for "take out" Chinese or noodles, this is a keeper.

I didn't have any chili paste so I used about a tablespoon of curry paste. Also didn't have any celery so just put a bag of mixed veggies in the soup.  Turned out great.

Used this recipe as a base to determine ratio for seasonings.  Delicious!  My step-daughter, age 14, complimented it several times, and of course, had seconds.  Thanks.  Added finely chopped red pepper, sliced mushrooms, water chestnuts and sliced carrots.

We tried this for dinner last night. It was VERY good and we will definitely be having this again. I only used 2 tsp of Thai chile paste and that was plenty spicy for us so I'd suggest adding to taste. If you don't have chicken on hand I think it could easily be left out and not affect the taste at all. This is very flavorful. I'm headed to the kitchen to have leftovers for lunch.

Very good soup - healthy, inexpensive, easy, and flexible recipe.  My husband asked me to save this recipe (where I could find it again!) and make it often.  As did many others, I made minor changes based on what I had on hand - used leftover rotisserie chicken, spinach instead of lettuce.  Also I used soft ramen noodles (healthier) and added a bit of chopped roasted red pepper for color.  Everything else was made as the recipe was written, including the celery which we enjoyed.

This soup is amazing. This is a new favorite in our home. The only thing I do not add is chicken broth. That's because I use bone-in chicken breasts so that it makes it's own broth. I first sear the chicken and cook until it starts getting color, then I add garlic and ginger, and turmeric until fragrant. Then the chili paste (I use the garlic chili pase with the rooster on it-yum!) Then I add soysauce, sugar, and water enough to cover the chicken, cover and boil until chicken is done. It gets all the flavor in the meat. Then remove and shred the meat off the bone. Return to pot and after returning to med. boil add the celery and lettuce as directed, and YUM! Separately I have cooked chinese noodles from the Asian asle. Perfect! very healthy too. Great for warding off a cold ;)

Love Love Love! Perfect as written. I enjoyed the added texture of celery crunch! I had a lot of spinach but used the mixed salad (iceberg, romaine, radishes, carrots, and snow peas) I had on hand. Chopped fine as instructed, sans snow peas, and the Fam loved it. Thanks!

So uh, great soup! Heads up white people, don't add ALL the chili paste. I added extra ginger and sugar. Really good soup though!

A new favorite! My entire family rated it 5 stars. I made it "as is" except I cooked the chicken at the beginning with the spices then added the broth, etc. I thought the celery, lettuce, everything was perfect. Perfect flavor.

DH couldn't say enough good things about this soup -- and he's not very generous with high compliments.  I used samba oelek (Asian chile paste) which, with the numeric, gave it wonderful flavor and spice. It wasn't too spicy for us, but can see where sensitive palates might want to cut down on the chile paste.  Just don't omit it altogether.   Instead of celery and lettuce, I used spinach, and used Oriental-style noodles instead of raman.  Used all the same proportions, got six servings instead of eight.  Thanks, sal, for a great soup!

I freely admit I can't follow directions to save my life. lol My changes were to add 1/2 can corn, 1/2 can bean sprouts, 1 sliced carrot, and yellow onion. I skipped the celery, and substituted rice noodles for the ramen. It was not nearly as spicy as some people said, I will likely use the full quantity of spice called for next time! There will definitely be a next time, too. It is super tasty and very filling, and even is nutritiously balanced.

I made this with bok choy instead of celery. The bok choy was delicious and I absolutely recommend it! Everything else was spot on. Would definitely make again and again.

I had high hopes for this but I didn't care for it at all. The soy sauce was overpowering and it was far too salty.

It was a quirkey little soup for me.  I think it is a good base but I plan to make some changes in the future like less soy sauce.  I used Thai red curry paste which was good but just a 1/2 Tbs was just a notch too spicy for us.  And I would add lots more veggies and broth.  Used green cabbage this time instead of lettuce.  Would add some broccoli slaw (thin sliced broccoli and carrots).  Use plain old fusuli noodles and that was fine.  I will make it again though with my changes.  I think it will be a keeper.

I had a 1lb marg tub of frozen leftover homemade chicken & noodles. I wanted to do this for dinner. I was out of sesame oil so I roasted some sesame seeds, added 2 tbs of oil to them. Added the turmeric, chile paste ( I only used a tbs) a heaping tsp of dried ginger, added 4 cups of broth with my leftovers, used honey instead of sugar (because the honey was sitting right there begging to be used) I pretty much followed the rest of the instructions..skipping the celery and ramen since they were already in there, I chopped up however much salad was left in the bag, I'm guessing around 2 cups.. It turned out great and the heat ended up being just right for us. Great soup!!!

We really enjoyed this soup!  I didn't follow the recipe exactly as written.  I didn't have green onions or celery on hand so I omitted those, and used powdered ginger.  I did as other reviewers and used vermicelli instead of the ramen and also added some egg, to make it like egg drop soup.  My main complaint about the recipe is that it was way too spicy for me.  I should have used only 1 TB of chili paste instead of 2.  I also added quite a bit more sugar to cut the spice.  Still turned out nice and tasty even if it is spicier than I would have liked.
