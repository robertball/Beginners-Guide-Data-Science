07/11/16:  Made for DeWayne's birthday cake. For the crust I used a package of oatmeal cookie mix, made as directed.  Put half in the bottom of a casserole glass dish, baked then poured a mix of the chocolate sauce and melted peanut butter on top.  Next layered ice cream then toffee bits.    Topped with cool whip, rest of crumbled cookie I cooked separate,  chocolate and camamel drizzle.
