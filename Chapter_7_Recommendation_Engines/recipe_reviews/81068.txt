The first time I made these they were tasty, but a bit powdery. The second time, I added a 1/3 cup of sugar and they came out beautiful...much nicer, crispy texture.

A very unique and light treat! I made them for a baby shower and received many compliments. They fall apart in your mouth. I couldn't find green tea with lemon grass so I just used green tea with lemon and they turned out just fine.

This is a great cookie! I made them for my brother-in-law who is not big on sweets, and he loved them. This cookie is like a shortbread with a cool mint finish. Great with coffee or tea. I will make these again for sure

It a very fragrant cookie.  I love the citrusy taste.  I melted white chocolate chips and spread a little on each cookies then sprinkled chopped pecans.  They were very good.

This is an awesome recipe.  It's great with tea, and for those who love tea.  I've made it multiple times with different flavors of green tea.  Honey Lemon Ginsing is especially good!

Tasty and unique.  I tasted more peppermint than green tea, so if you are hesitant because of that ingredient, be not afraid.  I didn't have the patience for shaping, so I rolled into balls and then flattened them.  These cookies don't brown much, even when they are done, so watch carefully.  Not surprisingly, these are a great cookie to have with tea!

I really enjoyed these cookies, they were really light.  I used regular green tea because I don't really like like lemongrass, and they turned out great.  The flavor was really subtle and the cookie texture was great.
Everyone who tried the cookies loved them, even people who really don't like green tea.

Honestly, I don't know how anybody made these! I followed the recipe exactly and had a bowl of something that resembled cracker crumbs. Impossible to roll out into a dough form. What a bummer.

I expected these cookies to taste somewhat like the green tea ice cream I've had before, but they were nothing like it. The mint and honey flavors were overpowering and the cookies were not sweet enough and I'm the type of person who usually reduces the sugar in everything I bake! I saved the ingredients by adding sugar, vanilla extract, and chocolate chips, which turned them in to tasty, chewy mint-chocolate chip cookies that were enjoyed at a holiday party that evening.

These smelled good while they were baking, but the flavor is just not there. They taste really floury, and they have a dry, crumbly texture that just doesn't do anything to help them. I wish these were better, I really liked the idea.

I like this cookie.  Using pure green tea bags (I hate lemon grass), I found the flavor combination just right.  However, the cookies were too dry for me.  I'll make these again, but might try to tweak it into a moister cookie.. and I may try it with lemon instead of mint.  My taste testers didn't like the mint... but they don't like mint tea.

These rich, buttery cookies are good.  I took the dough, and shaped it into balls, making 7 dozen cookies, instead of rolling out the dough. Five drops of peppermint oil replaced the peppermint extract.

I remember trying his recipe a long time ago. But I used Matcha green tea(powdered green tea they use for like frappes and such). I has more of the green tea flavor. Regular green tea is too light of a flavor. And in my opinion, lemongrass and peppermint are not a good pair.

Not terrible, but not great either.  The peppermint flavor was milder than expected (a plus), but the green tea flavor didn't come through at all (a minus).  I really liked the idea of these cookies, and was disappointed that they didn't come out stellar.

Made these for St. Patrick's Day and I noticed the batter was more yellow than green, so I added food coloring. I was also timid about the amount of mint extract called for, so I used only 1/4 tsp. It has a nice hint of mint this way, but I think I'd try at least 1/2 tsp next time.  I toyed with the idea of adding sugar like another reviewer suggested, but in the end I left the recipe as-is, and instead melted white chocolate chips and drizzled on top to sweeten.  The cookie is basically a shortbread cookie, and it is NOT very sweet, so if you want it to be, definitely try adding some sugar in addition to the honey. Fun recipe! Thanks for adding!

I loved them, but my boyfriend really disliked them. (Took a bite and spit it back out begging for something to get the taste out. Charming, I know) I used chamomile tea, 1/2 t of vanilla extract and one crushed peppermint candy. It looked really dry before chilling so I took the advice of other reviewers and added about a 1/3 C of sugar. Fixed it right up! I also rolled them into balls and fork/pressed them (I hate rolling cookie dough) Will definitely be making these again, maybe for a baby shower or girls night in!

This is a fun recipe. I made mine gluten free, using my own blend of flours and 2 tsp. zanthum gum. I also used 1/4 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 cup agave nectar instead of honey, grapefruit tropical green tea, 1/4 tsp. peppermint oil instead of extract, added about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips (which work great if chopped up). Mine turned out speckled, not green like the picture, but they still look pretty nice.

Green tea icecream with mint leaves as a garnish (and a light flavoring) has been my favorite treat for years. These cookies were an awesome mimic of that treat. I loved them.

Not as good as I wanted them to be.  I served these after an Asian meal, and they were disappointing.  The texture is just too soft.

I liked the idea of this cookie. The only change I made was to add a little sugar. I cut the recipe in half and used 4 tsp of sugar.  I may try regular green tea next time to get a stronger green tea taste.

Like others, I made a few changes and loved the result...try this with a full egg, plus 3/4 c. sugar instead of the honey (result is a very moist cookie that melts in your mouth)! Also, no need to chill & roll the dough--they turn out perfect with a cookie scoop--just cook a little longer until lightly brown around the edges.

I made this cookie and thought it was a bit bland at first. But then I found a mint icing and it tasted wonderful! Use the extra tea bags and a drop of the mint extract and drink the tea with the cookies for a wonderful minty sweet treat!
