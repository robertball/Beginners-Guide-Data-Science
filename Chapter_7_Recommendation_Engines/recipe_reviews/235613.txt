SO easy (my 3 yr old helped make them) and the flavor is wonderful! I used parchment paper instead of foil for lining my pan and the bottoms came out lightly golden. Just perfect! Followed the recipe to a tee, except I had to make my own self-rising flour since I didn't have any on hand, by adding 1 teaspoon of salt and 3 teaspoons of baking powder to he 2 cups of all purpose flour.

I have made this recipe about 10 times in the last few months.  We like this as much as my home made bread.  But, this is a lot faster.

The temperature of 500 degrees is correct.

The aluminum foil keeps the biscuits from burning.  But - get the biscuits off the hot cookie sheet ASAP after brushing with butter.  Put them on a cooling rack to finish cool. 


These taste great for 2 - 3 days after cooking.


The melted butter added before cooking adds flavor.  The melted butter after cooking produces a nicely browned look.


Flipping over the ends and re-rolling produces a layered flaky biscuit - easy to spread jam on or eat without any toppings.


I do not have a round cutter.  So I cut these into squares or rectangles.  The taste is the same and it cuts down on the preparation time.


The recipe can be doubled or quadrupled without any changes (except sometimes adding a little more fluid)


The recipe can be made with a combination of 1/3rd milk and 2/3rds cream.  Just make sure you brush the biscuits with butter before cooking and the taste and texture is almost the same.

These are absolutely amazing! So much quicker and easier than the biscuits I usually make, you know, where everything has to be super cold and all that. This is so much easier, and the end result is fantastic. I didn't have any problems with the dough being too "soupy" or too sticky, as some of the other comments said. I was surprised at how wonderful this dough was to work with.
Just one thing, they are kinda sweet, which is delicious, but depending on what you're planning on doing with the biscuits, you may want to cut back a bit on the sugar.
After dinner, we were all standing around the stove, munching on the leftover biscuits, straight from the baking sheet. Yum!
Oh, I did change the oven temperature, simply because 500 made me nervous. I baked them at 450, and they came out perfectly. But that was just me being chicken. :)

I have made lots of biscuits in the last year, all with slightly different tweaks.  I've tried famous name brand recipes, celebrity chef recipes, and highly rated recipes.  This is the one that has gotten the highest praise.   It seems way too simple, doesn't it?   No pastry blender needed!  This was the first biscuit recipe I tried when I began this quest for baked perfection, and after all the different attempts, it has not been topped.  I am a novice baker, too, so I don't have experience, skills, or special cooking tools.  I simply watched Chef John's video repeatedly until I worked up enough courage to bake biscuits for my husband, the son of the world's greatest Southern cook.   You can't lose with this recipe!!

These are one of the best and easiest biscuit recipes that I have ever made or eaten! Do keep an eye on them in the oven b/c after 9-1/2 minutes, my bottoms were just on the verge of burnt (my oven temp is spot on too), so I'm thinking maybe it had something to do with using foil? Other than that, these are fantastic! So flavorful, tender and moist. I WILL be making these often, but reducing the cooking time accordingly~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

WOW!!! Followed this recipe to a T. Oven temp of 500 degrees is right on BTW. Biscuits were beautiful, delicate, simply delicious!!! Instead of running out to the store for can biscuits, I will run to the store for the heavy whipping cream! They are so simple and quick to make. Keep the easy and delicious recipes coming Chef John!!!

Very quick and easy. Can make using your own self-rising flour. I add 1/2 tsp of baking soda and 1/2 tsp of cream of tartar. Just fits into my toaster oven.

Easy & delicious.  Didn't use butter this time since I used them under sausage gravy.  Will definitely make again!  I baked at about 375 for 15 min.

OH.  MY.  WORD!!!  These things are TO DIE FOR!!  I have been trying different biscuit recipes trying to find the "right" biscuit.  My search is OVER!  The cream biscuits are DELICIOUS, and EASY to make!  My mother (God rest her soul) tried to make biscuits for my dad, but the poor things were like little rocks.  Dad ate them though, because he knew mom tried her best to please his southern taste buds (She was midwestern).  I'm self-taught in the baking world, so anything I'm interested in making has to be researched, and then I do the trial and error thing.  THESE biscuits are the result of about 10 different attempts at making biscuits.  I'm not going to look any further.  My whole family LOVED them!  My husband ate three of them right after they came out of the oven.  My picky younger son said he'll fight for the remainder of them!

They are fluffy, SO not DRY like a lot of the other recipes are, and there's no tedious mixing of this and that.  Even a novice like me had NO PROBLEMS!

THANK YOU!  THANK YOU!  THANK YOU, Chef John, for this AWESOME recipe!!

I used this as a base recipe and then divided the dry ingredients in half.  To one I and added 1/2 tsp of garlic salt, 1 tsp of Italian seasoning, and 1/2 cup Italian 5 cheese blend.  To the other I added 1 tsp of Sriracha seasoning and 1 tsp of Franks hot sauce for some spicy biscuits.  I didnBoth turned out moist and delicious!  Try your own variation!

I just baked these biscuit and I absolutely loved them.  I followed the recipe, just not the directions. (What can I say,  I'm a rebel) All I did was brush them with milk instead of butter....lol and my oven was preheated at 400 and they rose a little higher, seems like,  than the picture featured. But they are so light and fluffy. I'm gonna add sweet potatoes and see what happens.

5 Star, these biscuits are wonderful. Their very easy to make and are light and fluffy.  My husband raved over them.  I didn't have self-rising flour, but looked it up in AllRecipies and made my own, which was very simple. Again these biscuits are FABULOUS once you try them you will never go back to whatever recipe you were using.

These are so tender and light and delicious. I used half whole wheat pastry flour and half unbleached along with 2t baking powder and 1t salt instead of the self rising flour. Best biscuits ever!

My new biscuit recipe. 

Chef John is funny and entertaining to watch, but that aside, these biscuits are just amazing. 

No matter how well you blend lard/butter into your flour, it's just not possible to get it as fine as the fat molecules in the cream. So, the texture of cream biscuits is just on a whole new level. 

These recipe is excellent to be so easy to make. My only caution is too hang in there on the cook time. It's a high temp and I got nervous and pull them too early.

Like others, my dough was way too sticky so I added more flour.  Next time, I will start with only 3/4 cup of cream and add more if I need it.  I did use regular flour and added in 3/4 T of baking powder so that might have made the difference.  I will try self rising next time just to see if there is a difference.

I don't have to mess around with butter AND it's the best biscuit ever??? I am sold. I don't think I have ever set my oven temperature to 500 before. It was well worth the wait to preheat!

great biscuits!!!  Had left over whipping cream from a dessert and thought this would be a great way to use up!!  Big hit at my house.  They didn't brown....but think my oven is not running to temp.  Cooked 3 extra minutes - tasted great, but looked pale.

I made this recipe because I was out of shortening.  This recipe makes a very light, tender biscuit.  Flaky it was not.  I will be keeping this recipe in my box for times like today.   My usual recipe which uses shortening  and buttermilk produces a higher and flaky biscuit which is what I prefer.  This recipe though sure beats a trip to the grocery store on the last moment.

I used half and half instead of cream. I also just plopped about 1/3 cup of the batter at a time onto the foiled pan instead of rolling and cutting, to cut down on time. It probably would make the biscuits more flaky if you rolled and folded like the directions say, but we loved them how we did it! Simple and good.

I tweaked this recipe by using 2 cups cream and baking at 375F for 15 minutes, checking for color, and adding a few minutes to achieve the desired golden color. I also folded the dough an extra time for extra flakiness. Magnifique!

I put it in 500 degrees and 8 minutes later smoke filled the room. I tried this recipe because I don't have any buttermilk in my house. Very tasty when I used it for my pigs in a blanket.

These are wonderful, and so easy! I had some leftover heavy whipping cream in the fridge and found this recipe. I halved the recipe (due to the size of the crowd I was serving) and now I have regrets! Followed exactly, except I didn’t have self-rising flour so I added 1.5tsp baking powder and 1/2tsp salt PER CUP of all-purpose flour. Baked on parchment paper instead of foil and the bottoms still were a touch dark at 10 minutes. My oven runs hot though, so I might turn it down a touch next time. Biscuits still tasted great and were light, tender and fluffy! Thanks again Chef John!

So easy and they come out perfect every time! I'm lazy, so I just pat the dough into a rectangle and cut into squarish biscuits. My only advice: don't pat the dough too thin and don't wait to bake them.

OMG!!!  These biscuits are so good and smooth they will melt in your mouth!  I cannot believe just how easy this biscuit recipe is to make .  I followed the recipe to a T, except I didn't quite use a full tablespoon of sugar.  Thanks Chef John for an excellent and easy recipe for  "good southern biscuits"!

In the interest of time, I baked the dough in my iron skillet instead of rolling out biscuits. FABULOUS!!!!! Light and fluffy and a delicious taste!

These biscuits came out great!  The only thing I did differently was I used organic sugar which is not as sweet. I like my biscuits a little bit taller so next time I will make them a little bigger. But the flavor was amazing and with so little ingredients you can't beat it.

These are so easy to make.   Just don't overwork the dough.  I patted down my dough and  made my  biscuits a little thick. Used my iron skillet and some parchment  paper on bottom, so they would not get too brown. My oven was at 450. This is a keeper.

My husband and I both loved these! I had to make gluten-free self-rising flour to make them, and we devoured them. He asked for the recipe so he could make them if I wasn’t around.

I didn't  have any self rising flour so thank goodness at the bottom of the recipe it tells you how to make some. Other than that, I stuck by the recipe and the biscuits were delish!

I have been in search of a biscuit recipe for years, and this is the one! So delicious and so easy. This is the first recipe I've tried which produces the cake-like biscuits you get at KFC or McDonalds breakfast (which I prefer over the layered pop n fresh variety). 

Two tips: first, don't overwork the dough. Knead it JUST enough to incorporate the flour and then stop. It won't rise if overworked. Second, if you don't have a biscuit cutter, an overturned cup is NOT a suitable substitution. Using an overturned cup will prevent your biscuits from rising. I'm not sure why, but it seems like the vacuum seal maybe compresses the dough.

Meant to review this in May - went all out for a breakfast tea for the royal wedding.  These were a great addition to the feast.  I made them to eat with Chef John's clotted cream recipe.  That was a little odd for our American palates, but these were a hit with jam.

I've been making baking powder biscuits for 40 years. Tried and true. This Christmas, I had 13 people coming for brunch, and I decided to try this recipe, even though I was sure they would not be as good as the old stand by. I was so wrong!! These were super simple to make and came out beautifully browned, flaky, and light. I didn't have enough cream for the double batch I made, so I used non-fat half-and-half to make  up the difference (about 1 cup). Still came out perfect. I don't always have whipping cream in the fridge when I want to make biscuits on a whim, so I may resort to my old ways. But if there's cream in the fridge, this is the recipe I'll use.

I thought they were okay although they were sweeter than I expected. My husband didn't really care for them much. They have cross between a cake texture and a biscuit texture, so if you really want a biscuit, it might not be what you are looking for.

I have a propane oven, the first time I made the recipe I filled it to the letter except I took them out at 9 minutes because they were already burnt. I made them again and added a quarter teaspoon of sea salt (we use unsalted butter so the first batch tasted a bit flat), used parchment instead of foil and lowered temp to 450 for 9 minutes. Perfect. This is my new weeknight biscuit recipe for sure.

On a whim, I made these biscuits with dinner tonight.. I didn't have any self rising flour, so I used 2 cups AP flour, a tablespoon of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of salt.  I patted the dough, folded it in thirds, and did that step 3 times.  I cut with a glass.  I was afraid to turn my oven up to 500 (It runs a little hot most of the time).  I forgot to time them.  But I took them out when they were golden.  Best biscuits ever!

I think  that this is a wonderful biscuit recipe and I would definitely use it again! Also this is a great recipe to memorize since its so simple. I do warn to listen to the video about gathering and rolling the third and second time, it definitely gets less pretty the more times you do this.

My go to recipe for biscuits. I loved KFCs biscuits but these are better and much simpler and healthier. So easy, they go great with breakfast and can easily be cooked alongside any quick meal like breakfast. I just use a self rising flour recipe from another post in allrecipes.

They were easy to make and looked great. The taste was good but seemed to be slightly under cooked in the center, the tops were dark enough they could not be cooked longer. I also  did not like the way they fell apart when picked up. They did not hold together as well as other biscuits.

Made it according to directions and they were everything that was promised!    And, yes, it's a successful, foolproof recipe for those of us who tend to overwork the dough (me!).  However, still on the hunt for the ultimate biscuit and will be moving onto Chef John's Buttermilk Biscuit recipe next.

I love to cook, but this was my first try at biscuits from scratch.  I was having more people for breakfast than I originally planned, so I doubled the recipe.  The biscuits came out great, even though, since I had two pans of them, I had to cook them longer.  I followed the recipe just as it was, since it was the first time, but don't think I would change anything, unless it was to experiment with adding fruit or nuts to them sometime!

I make these biscuits all the time, best biscuits ever. The only thing I change is the oven temp. I set my oven to 350 for 20 minutes.

So easy to make and delicious!  I did add two teaspoons of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the flour as I don't buy self raising flour (too expensive), although our Canadian flour is all-purpose and very good for baking.   This was one of the easiest recipes and has the biggest pay-off with a biscuit that is light and very tasty.  I followed Chef John's recipe (video) and was very pleased with the results.

They tasted delicious but they weren't puffy and flaky like biscuits should be.

This has to be the best recipe ever!  I have to double and sometimes triple the recipe because the biscuits are so good they go super fast!

These are the best biscuits I ever made!  This was much better than the buttermilk biscuits I used to make.  I am always and forever hooked on cream biscuits.

Proportions were off for me. I ended up with a soupy mess. I added another half cup of flour, then just gave up and poured what I had into a pan and baked it as a cake instead of trying to shape the mess into biscuits. Luckily I timed it low, because at 8 minutes it was already browning, and the bottom browned enough to separate from the rest. 
Problems aside, I liked the soft and light texture of the end result. I also liked the 2 ingredients and under 15 minutes. It was tasty with some butter and sugar cane syrup. I'll try it again with adjusted measurements.
