This recipe results in a very dense, thick cake that reminds me of gingerbread, actually.  I think it's a bit too sweet, so if I made it again I'd cut back on the sugar to 1 cup.  I also didn't use as much jam as noted for the cake--I did use the amount indicated for the batter itself, but I only had a pint jar, which is 2 cups, so I used the last 1/2 cup for the filling and it was plenty.  Hubs seems to like it, and I definitely think this is a cake that needs the cream cheese frosting to complement the flavor, but it definitely makes a lot, so be aware.  Thanks for the recipe!
