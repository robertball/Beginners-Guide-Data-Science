I substituted chicken broth for the milk. Instead of 2 hours on the stove top, I cooked this uncovered in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes at 350 degrees. Removed the chicken from the pan and added 1 tsbp of flour or cornstarch to thicken the drippings. Replaced chicken in the sauce and cooked on stove top for 5 minutes (just enough to cook flour).

I did not care for this recipe. The milk curdled right away, and I had to add country gravy mix to salvage it.

I have tried this recipe several times, although ever time I take a bite of it I always say I know this is running my blood pressure up,however, Ilove it. I did cut back on the salt and pepper, but after it simmered for the 2 hours, I added the chicken and the sauce to cooked spaghetti and also added some basil and a little olive oil, and it was delicous, try it you just might like it

If you simmer it too long, the chicken dries out.  It is a healthy main course, though.

I was looking for some Very Simple Recipes for my frozen Chicken and found this gem.
The only caveat was that after the Milk is added it needs to simmer for 20 minutes..
As it turns out, I was making a small amount of chicken in an 8 in skillet and the reduction of the milk into a sauce took less than 20 minutes - but I did watch over it and give it a poke & a stir every now and again - the result was Delicious - BJ

This smelled so go when I was making it but the end results were bland. I did cook as directed with the milk but at an extremely low simmer until the chicken reached 165 degrees (approx. 40 mins.). The milk did not curdle however it was still thin. A dusting of corn starch thickened the milk after bringing it back to a simmer. No doubt with additional seasoning this would work well.
