This recipe is great and is very tasty as well as easy!  Tarragon has become a new favorite spice.

I used fresh tarragon and completely ignored the foil (my fault - I seriously didn't read the recipe carefully). I used this as a marinade and soaked the chicken in it all day before grilling without the foil. I did not brush with the mixture (partly because I soaked the chicken in ALL of it, and, well, I didn't read the directions.)  My chicken was moist and delicious. Note: because I used it as a marinade, I added a little red wine vinegar. This is a great flavor combination and I will use it again as a marinade.

I found this to be a very tasty recipe. I also used whole chicken pieces and found the cooking time was too much for me. I would reduce it to 30 minutes then the additional 10 minutes. For boneless I would reduce it even more. Great flavor however.

Not very flavorful and the chicken was very dried out (though this might have more to do with the small cut and cooking time than the recipe).  Very simple and quick to make, but I thought that a lot could have been done to make it much better.  Maybe try baking the chicken in the marinade to keep in the flavor more?

This chicken was outstanding!!  I didn't have tarragon so I used mixed Italian seasoning in place of it. My daughter also commented that the marinade would probably be perfect for dipping some Italian bread into.  The marinade smelled so good.  The chicken was so tender and I don't even like white meat.  This was a great recipe and a keeper.  I'll be making this again.  Thanks!

This was a disaster! I followed the recipe but thought 1 FULL T of pepper would be nuts--so I used 1/2 T. Even with others' suggestion to reduce the foil cooking time (I went with 30 instead of 40 minutes) ours was CHARRED--nothing about it was redeemable at all! Didn't even get to take it to Step Two of direct grill--it was totally dried out & ruined. When you say Grill on High, I guess that is a relative term!? Maybe a temp would be better than "High." We use gas--ours was over 400 degrees,,,

Love the combination of garlic and tarragon in this.  I only marinated for a couple hours. Next time I'll try and marinate for longer and see how it turns out.  Also, I didn't want to waste the propane in my grill.  So, I baked it in the oven on 350 for 40 minutes and then transfered to the grill to finish it up.  Good Stuff!

I made this recipe exactly as stated here.  It was really moist and my husband loved it.  It took a little longer because the chicken breasts were very large.  We'll be making this often.  I think the reason 1,200 people saved this recipe and there are no custom versions is because it is perfect as is.

Delish! I made this in a skillet and it was very moist. The spices blended together very nicely. My husband said it smelled like a restaurant in here!

Had high hopes for this one but it fell short. Needed more flavor that just the garlic. In the end, I added some lemon and Italian seasoning.

I loved the chicken I paired it with a rice pilaf. On the chicken I  cut the tarragon down a little and added basil and oregano

I used fresh tarragon from my garden and boneless chicken thighs. As per another review, I added a touch of wine vinegar (acid) and marinated my chicken for about an hour before grilling. Excellent!
