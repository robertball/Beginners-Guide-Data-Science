This recipe is from the More with Less cookbook - I was asking my mom for the recipe she used to make and she pointed me to this cookbook.  It's really tasty and healthy.

I liked this! Per the review before me i added a few more spices... onion powder, garlic salt and crushed red pepper flakes. I also didn't add quite as much onion because it just seemed like way too much. Maybe it wouldn't have been though. I also used chopped tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes because that's what I had. All in all I thought this was very good.

This was very good, and you can  modify it based on what you have in your pantry at the time. I used fresh thyme and left out the sage. I only had half a bell pepper, so I added an extra stalk of celery and some fresh mushrooms and it turned out great! I also used half cheddar and half mozarella. My meat loving husband loved it too, and it makes plenty so you can enjoy leftovers the next day, would definitely make again.

I chose this recipe because we have started a new lifestyle change - cutting out highly processed foods and adding more highly nutritious foods to our diet.  So I was looking for something new we'd never had.  I did make some changes to this recipe.  First I used homemade vegetable stock in place of the water and ended up using 3 cups total. I used a mixture of red & brown lentils because the recipe didn't specify.  I omitted the marjoram & sage because I didn't have them.   I used 1 tsp minced garlic from a jar and a mixture of red/green/yellow peppers because that's what I had.  I sautéed the onion, carrots, celery, and green peppers for about 5 minutes in a little olive oil for added flavor.  I also didn't read the directions thoroughly and ended up combining everything but the cheese in the pan.  I baked it for 30 minutes at 350 and checked it, the liquid was gone (which is why I added another cup as stated above for a total of 3 cups) at this point I turned my oven up to 400 covered with foil and baked an additional 45-55 minutes, checking a few times for doneness.  I also added onion powder, garlic powder, and oregano - to taste because it was too bland for my tastes.   I did not bake it with the cheese it melted without putting it back in the oven.  This isn't a dish I will cook every week, but it changes things up and I would make it again.

I made some minor changes: 10 oz fresh tomato instead of canned, a second stalk of celery, red bell pepper instead of green, and used 1.25 C cheddar and .25 C feta (ran out of cheddar). This is really good. Even hubby liked it, which is rare for a lentil dish!

Simple, inexpensive, tasty, and good for a couple of meals if you're cooking for two.  What more can you ask?

Wow, I was looking for an easy side to use up some lentils and had everything on hand for this delicious treat.  I did mix a little mozzarella cheese with the cheddar.  Will make this again and recommend highly, thank you Tiffany!

If I was to make this recipe again I would pre-cook the Carrots and the Celery. Alternatively I would make the cooking time longer.

What a lovely way to have lentil stew!  This was so comforting on a cold winter night and I truly enjoyed it.  I did omit the green pepper as I am not really a fan of it.  Otherwise I made it as written.

I thought the final product was pretty good, easy ingredients and hearty meal.  I adjusted the sage and thyme down while adding additional garlic powder (personal taste), likely should be made with brown/green lentils with the suggested baking time....I used french lentils and it baked for 4 hours with much additional water added.  The house was nice and toasty with the oven on all evening :)

I have made this dish for years and my husband and 2 kids love it, despite the fact that they don't really care for beans.  I keep it covered throughout the oven time until ready for the cheese.  I add more celery because I love cooked celery. I don't add the green pepper at all.   As mentioned by the person who shared the recipe, this is a great dish to serve when you have folks in the crowd who are vegetarian.  Not for vegans, of course, due to cheese.

I was looking for a high protein vegetarian meal (I eat cheese). This was it! Amazing how good it was and that the lentils cooked. Since it makes so much, I brought it to work and they loved it!

The first time i made this, I cheated and used canned lentils.  Just sautéed the Vegetables then mixed it all and put it in a casserole and topped with cheese.  It was really good!  This time I followed the recipe and used dried lentils. It came out dry and not as tasty.

I made this recipe for my 14 month old and he loved it. I also enjoyed it. I did not have celery so I suspect the flavor could only get better. I also added the cheese to soon. I will make this again. Great as a main dish or side dish.

I liked this okay, but I found that it needed a lot more seasoning. I used Rotel tomatoes, twice as much garlic than called for, and a healthy dash of cayenne pepper, but still found the flavor overwhelmed by the cheese (of which I only used half of what was called for).  This is not a bad dish, but you really have to season to your tastes. I think siracha hot sauce would be really good in it, but I put that on everything as it is.

This is a  delicious dish. I did not have some of the spices so I added garlic powder, thyme and Italian spice. I think the next time I make this I will use a different cheese like gruyere. I found the cheddar too stringy. I think the cooking time wss little long. I perfere the veggies to be crunchy.

This recipe came from a vegetarian cookbook from the 70s or early 80s and has been one of my staples, whenever looking for a meatless dish.  My husband, an ardent meat-etarian, loves it.  Over the years I've made lots of changes, depending on what vegetables I have on hand.  Leeks, mushrooms, different kinds of peppers,  celery root, and different herbs, each giving a unique twist.  It becomes an excellent base for whatever flavours you crave.  I generally use chicken or vegetable broth instead of water.  I also sometimes sauté the veg first to develop a bit more flavour, but I do like the way the recipe suggests you add the veg, too, which helps maintain their original shape.  Also I've used different kinds of cheese.  Swiss gives it a nutty taste.  Love this recipe.

My super picky kids, all four of them are this and told me we can have this for dinner all the time. I did blend the veggies in my nutribullet so they couldn't see them but otherwise followed it to the letter.  Will have this again.

A few years ago, when I had an 8-month-old baby and was pregnant with another, I came home from work to this incredible dish cooking in the oven. My mother-in-law had made it for my birthday dinner. I ate it like there was no tomorrow, and every time I make it, I can't believe how delicious something this healthy can be. It's one of my husband's and my very favorite foods.

This is such a good, satisfying homey recipe.I love that it is meatless. The seasonings, texture, colors, and healthfulness of this recipe has made it a go-to for many years. My kids loved it when they were younger, my husband (who is a profound meat eater) really loves it too. I don't change a thing in the recipe. NOTE: It makes a huge amount - for just my husband and me, I usually cut the recipe in half, and even then, we have leftovers.

This was delicious!!  It is a recipe where you can play around with the seasonings and vegetables.  Next time I will cook the bell pepper longer--it was not as tender as the other vegetables.  I will definitely make this again.

I loved this dish.  My husband I are runners and trying to eat healthier.  I like lentils and the comment posted with this recipe (husband approved) convinced me to give it a try.  As I put it together (and especially when I pulled the finished product out of the oven), I was sure I was in for a fight at dinner.  All the kids ate it (some were not exactly thrilled), but my picky 9 year old daughter said it was really good!!  She even asked to take the leftovers for lunch.  I loved it and couldn't believe how much flavor it packed!  Of course, the best part is that it tastes great AND is very healthful.  Thanks for sharing!

This was excellent, and has the ever elusive "husband seal of approval", not to mention that of my 3 year old and 8-month old! I did like another reviewer and threw everything in at once and baked for about an hour, then put the cheese on top, and it turned out just fine. I would perhaps suggest stirring once or twice if you do that, just to make sure the lentils on top get cooked properly, but even with a couple of crunchy ones, it was still delicious.

Great concept but needs more seasoning.  This makes a LOT- I made as a side dish and halved the recipe, it still filled an 8x8 pan.

These are cheap simple and delicious. I add everything all at once and it cooks fine.  Delicious and healthy.
