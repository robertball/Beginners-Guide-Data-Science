This really is the best carrot cake in the world.  I changed 3 things:  reg. milk + 1 teaspooon lemon juice in place of buttermilk as I was out of it.  1/8 teaspoon nutmeg was added and also I covered my raisins with orange juice and brought them to a boil, letting them simmer for a couple of minutes.  Took them off the heat and let cool.  Drained them and added when prompted by recipe.  Baked in 3 (9") Cushionaire pans for 25 to 28 minutes.  Frosted with 16 oz. cream cheese, 1 stick butter, 1 teaspoon each of almond and vanilla extracts and 32 oz. powdered sugar sifted.  I had a carrot cake fan taste this and he said it was the best he's ever eaten.  It is!  Thank you Brian for this recipe.

My daughter and I tried 5 different carrot cake recipes to find one suitably delicious for a wedding cake and settled on this one. Even though this site says that the 'Best Carrot Cake Ever' is the best, this recipe won out over it as we had a family and friends "taste-off" before we made our final selection. It by far had the most flavor.  Not too moist, not too crumbly.  At the reception, person after person raved over the cake and asked for the recipe.  We had very little left.  Just enough so that we could enjoy some the next day.  We did make a few minor changes.  We omitted the coconut, walnuts and raisins.  And increased the carrots to 3 cups.

Bravo,this is a wonderful recipie...I took a hint from a Gourmet magazine recipie and added grated rind of a lemon. In addition, I made the cream cheese icing with grated lemon rind and lemon juice..this cut the sweetness of the cake and gave it a glorious citrus flavour!!!!!!!!!

Modestly, I must rate this the best carrot cake ever since Sam was my grandfather.  I wanted to post a public message thanking all those who have reviewed this recipe and gave it such high marks.  I hope you all continue to enjoy it!

I made this carrot cake because it had everything (coconut, walnuts, pineapple, and raisins) plus buttermilk. The only change I made was to put it into two round cake pans. If you do this reduce the cooking time by 15 minutes. I topped the cake with "whipped cream cream cheese frosting" from this site which is a great cream cheese frosting because it is not too sweet and went great with this cake. I will make this cake again!

This is AMAZING! So Moist and filling and the flavour even develops more beatifully over the days. I First made this for mothers day and my mother claims this IS the BEST carrot cake ever tasted. Family has requested it again and again and also makes a lovely morning tea snack as it is quite an enormous cake to get through! Only thing I did first time was omit the raisins (personal preference) and divide mixture into 3 pans for a 3 layer cake used with "cream cheese frosting II" from this site. Second time around I halved the ingredients and still made a wonderful 2 layer cake. My only suggestion is to use your food processor throughout various stages to cut down on time and convenience which then makes this quite a quick cake to prepare. This is definately going to become a "secret" family heirloom for me as well. Thank you Brian for sharing!

Okay, I've baked this cake over 20 times and so I consider myself an expert on this recipe. (I always mentally thank "Grampa Sam" every time I bake it.)

First of all, to "clwguy," who gave this recipe a 1-star rating:  YES, LEAVING OUT THE PINEAPPLE WILL MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE RESULT! You can omit other ingredients (I myself forgot to add the coconut last month) and still have a great cake, but *not* the pineapple.

Before baking this cake the first time, and even since, I've read through dozens of reviews of this recipe.  Here's my advice, based on what I've read, plus my own experience:

1.  CUT THE CINNAMON BY HALF, as others have suggested.  (Adding a little nutmeg and/or allspice is a great idea.)
2.  PECANS ARE PREFERABLE TO WALNUTS, which can often impart a bitter taste. Pecans are naturally sweet, and work much better in this recipe.
3.  Consider OMITTING THE RAISINS. Lots of folks just don't like raisins, and in any case I believe they overwhelm the other ingredients.  (I've left out the raisins for several years now, and all my friends are crazy about this cake.)
4.  DON'T USE YOUR FOOD PROCESSOR to slice the carrots; they'll end up too long and stringy. Grate by hand -- it's worth it!
5.  DIVIDE THE BATTER INTO TWO PANS, and test the loaves after 35 minutes.  (One hour is way too long for this cake, and would account for a couple of the negative reviews I've read.) 
6.  Suggestion: try the "WHIPPED CREAM CREAM CHEESE FROSTING" on this site. Scrumptious!

This cake is FANTASTIC!! Omitted the raisins, baked it in a 13X9 pan for 45 minutes, and topped it off with a thick layer of cream cheese frosting.  This is the only carrot cake recipe I'll use from now on.  My husband's favorite!

Oh my goodness !!!! This was the ultimate best carrot cake I have ever had...and my guests agreed.  As others recommended, I used Cream Cheese Frosting II.  It was equally delicious.  I used two 9 inch cake pans.  The cook time was approx. 45 minutes at recommended temperature.  I sprinkled cake with crushed & whole pecans.  This was a very tasty & attractive way to serve the cake.  It really dressed it up.  Will continue to make this cake over & over again.  However, next time I would like to try a more healthy version utilizing apple sauce verses vegetable oil.  I'll let you know how it turns out...

I chose this recipe because the fat content was lower than some of the other carrot cake recipes.  I reduced the oil to 1/4 C., split the flour to 1 cup white, 1 cup whole wheat, used 3 cups carrots, 3/4 cup coconut, 3/4 cup half walnuts, half pecans and left out the raisins(don't like them).  This reduced the fat even more, and it was an incredible cake!  Thanks for this recipe.

We were having a taste off of Carrot cakes and so far this seems to be the winner.  Pat's Award Winning is coming in a close second.  Cream cheese frosting is a better compliment to this cake because it is not as sweet as Pat's.  I think this is going to be my wedding cake.  It is really good.

I have to say that I was very disappointed with this recipe. After reading all the great reviews I thought this would be great, but then nearly everyone who gave 4+ stars modified the recipe in some way. I followed the recipe exactly and got a dense and moist, yet bland, unsweet, oily cake which tasted nothing like any of the carrot cakes I've ever had. I also thought the cake had too much going on in it. Bits of crunchy carrot shavings here (even though I shredded them super fine with my food processor), pineapple bits there, and an occasional raisin. The first thing my fiance, who loves carrot cake, said when he saw the cake was, "that does not look like a carrot cake," and he is right. It is a very dark and un-carrot cake like color, more like rye bread. My biggest regret is that I wasted a can of perfectly delicious whipped cream cheese frosting and a half pound of walnuts for the topping.

It's too funny that this recipe is out here under Sam's Famous Recipe. My name is Sam also and I got almost the same recipe from my mom almost 20 years ago and started making it. I am known throughout the World's Largest and BEST Aircraft Manufacturing Company for this recipe and even brought it in one day to have it put on a company plane for a delivery to a old coworker that was craving a piece of it. Love ya Ira!
Only difference between this cake and mine are the following three changes.
1) Drop the raisins (never liked them anyway)
2) I use a total of 2 cups Sugar
3) I cook it for a total of 50 minutes in glass pans or 55 minutes in metal.

Use either a cream cheese frosting or... look at the buttermilk glaze on the other recipes here.

Brian, I hope you're not tired of rave reviews! As an experienced cook who can spot a recipe's potential at a glance, I just knew I had to try this cake. Depending on where you're from, a carrot cake with pineapple & coconut is considered traditional. For others, just raisins and nuts. I made it as written and was floored.    Cake was extremely moist, flavor was well balanced and the sweetness was perfect. I promised my family I would make this often during the fall season and for every holiday from now on.  I had to divide the last piece into 4 small slivers so my family wouldn't fight over it and even then they were measured with a critical eye and a hearty debate over which was bigger. My teenage sons actually hugged me over this cake - enough said.  Something tells me this recipe brought smiles to the faces of Sam's family and friends at the mere mention of it. Great legacy!

Oh my this cake is delicious! The best carrot cake recipe I have ever come across, and I have come across many =] Some carrot cakes are too oily, but not this one. And there is just enough of everything, so that no one ingredient over powers the others. I did follow another reviewer's comments, and I plumped my raisins in orange juice before adding. I also used 1/8 tsp of nutmeg because I prefer a hint of spice. As for the walnuts, I processed mine, as I don't go for the big bite of walnuts--my personal preference. I made this into a 3-layer cake--there was plenty of batter for it, and I frosted it with the "cream cheese frosting II" recipe on this site. What a splendid cake. I will use this recipe from now on.

This is delicious, but it needed a touch more salt. I made 12 cupcakes plus 1 8x8x2 pan with just a single recipe.  The cupcakes, without the frosting, tasted a touch bland. I think 1/2 tsp salt total would do the trick. The cake with the frosting was delicious! (Bake the cupcakes for 30 minutes at 350 deg, and the cake for 45-50 minutes, and give it the toothpick test). I will definitely make this again.

The first time I made this recipe I followed it exactly. I got rave reviews for it. The second time I made this cake I made some adjustments:

-I used dried cranberries instead of raisins. The tartness of the cranberries really complimented how sweet this cake is.
I added double vanilla, double cinnamon, a pinch of clove and and pinch of nutmeg.

The second cake was made for an office party and everyone went crazy over it! The second cake had more enthusiastic feedback. Also, this cake is significantly better the next day.

This recipe is amazing!  I am vegan and allergic to wheat, so finding the perfect carrot cake, or any cake recipe, is a bit of a challenge and I always have to modify them.  I did have to make some changes to this, obviously, but I wanted to put it out there that this recipe translates well to being vegan and wheat-free.  I used spelt flour plus a pinch of xanthan gum instead of wheat flour (spelt doesn't bother me), Ener-G egg replacer in place of the eggs, almond milk with a little lemon juice to replace the buttermilk and applesauce to replace the oil.  I also added a little bit more carrot and a little ground ginger.  I used golden raisins.  It was PERFECT...wonderfully moist and chock full of stuff.  I made the Cream Cheese Icing II recipe on here, using vegan cream cheese, and mixed some more shredded coconut into the icing.  Vegans and those with wheat allergies, rejoice, this is a carrot cake that you can easily adapt to your dietary needs!

Shame on you Sam!  You have just dethroned my Mom's very famous, award winning recipe for carrot cake.  Her last one sold for $75 at a charity auction but no more. I couldn't find her recipe so looked up a new one, yours, and took the risk of showing up with it at a family function.  The unanimous decision was that this was a better cake.  My husband said that it brought tears to his eyes it was so perfect.  Bingo ...Jackpot ...We have a winner extrodinaire!

Perfect as is: great combo of flavors & texture & not overly sweet! Made for my daughter's  27th birthday, since carrot cake is her favorite. Brought to church for fellowship time, and it was devoured within minutes, with people asking for the recipe and coming back for seconds!  Only change I made was adding 1/4 tsp. each nutmeg & cloves. Took note of others' suggestions: make a day ahead for flavors to mingle; sub milk + 1 tsp. lemon juice or vinegar if don't have buttermilk; use food processor or lg. cheese grater for carrots, which should be packed in measuring cup tightly; best with Cream Cheese II frosting by Janni. I doubled cake recipe, using 3 - 9 x 13 pans -  glass @ 45 min., used 1 frosting recipe, and decorated with chopped walnuts. (Probably 1 recipe would fit in one pan next time, but 1/2 frosting recipe is plenty for each batch). Definitely a keeper! Thanks, Brian & Grandpa Sam!

This was one of my desserts I had for Easter dinner.  It was an absolutely wonderful carrot cake!! This recipe is a must for carrot cake lovers. 
I boiled/cooled the raisin in OJ like one reviewer suggested.  I also decreased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp and added the nutmeg and allspice (1/4 tsp each). I baked it in two 9 inch round pans (baked for ~35 minutes) and layered it with cream cheese frosting. It was perfect! Thank you!

I omitted the raisins, but it still tasted too fruity for my taste (not a knock against the recipe at all- just my preference).  Next time, I will omit the coconut but keep the pineapple because it makes the cake very moist.  However, I will puree the crushed pineapple for a more consistant texture.  Per reviewer(s) advice, I used 2 cups of sugar (instead of 1 1/2) and added 1/4 tsp of allspice and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.

Delicious! Didn't change a thing other than omitting the raisins (not a fan). Incredibly moist and soooo good. I made cupcakes and ended up with 23. Baked for 30 minutes at 350. Frosted with "Cream Cheese Frosting II" on this site. Really good!

OMG! this stuff is fabulous!  I made it gluten free by substituting 1 cup rice flour, 1/2 c corn starch and 1/2 c potato starch.  Also added about 2 tsp guar gum as well.  I made this once for my sister in law's birthday and then again for work.  Everyone loved it!  I used a cream cheese icing that I found on this site.  Basically, 1 stick butter, 8 oz cream cheese, 2 teaspoons vanilla and 3 cups sifted powdered sugar.  Whip this up with the kitchen aid and you will not be dissapointed!

Great recipe. My husband said it was the best cake I ever made. He's a cyclist and needs a lot of carbs and stays slim even eating Pasta and Cake. And I love to bake. I wanted a recipe using buttermilk...it gives such a wonderful flavor and texture. I usually bake pies and his favorite is Buttermilk, Sweet Potatoe and fried apricot/peach. So I thought he would enjoy this cake. I get my eggs Jumbo from the farmers market so I only used 2,fresh grated organic carrots,I just got a new shredder attachment for my kitchenaid and it was fast...I used the larger shredder,pecans instead of walnuts,I wish I would have had black walnuts...I also used half yellow raisins and half black.  The only flour I will use is King Arthur brand...it's the best. I bake a lot of bread and if you ever use a bread machine...I let mine do the kneading only...you will find your bread far superior using either King Arthur All Purpose or Bread Flour...and of coarse the white wheat or whole...just can't say enough about this flour. I topped the Carrot Cake with a wonderful Buttermilk Glaze I got from this site... baked it in a large 10X12 pan and will line it next time with wax or parchment paper as it can be a little tricky getting out just using crisco and flour. It was Perfect...Thank you for your Grandfather's delicious recipe.

Grandpa Sam Rocks!!!

Made this for a birthday and it was absolutely wonderful.  Added a little orange zest and did it in a bundt pan without altering time or temp and it came out incredible.  Frosted with some suggestions from a few other recipes although I cheated a little....Pillsbury prepared cream cheese icing (thick & rich variety) which I added some more orange zest to and then thinned with a couple of spoons of orange juice.  Got raves!  Everybody loved it!  Thank you Brian for sharing this family "jewel".

Scrumptious! Very moist and flavorful. I made cupcakes - the batter was enough for maybe 26 or 27 cupcakes, though I only made two batches of 12. Cut the cooking time down to 25 minutes. I only had time to use store bought frosting, but next time I will make my own (less sweet) to complement this delicious cake!

Another RAVE review. Made exactly as written, except subbed 1/4 cup of the oil for applesauce... only because I ran out of vegetable oil! (Honestly, who runs out of vegetable oil?).  I made it with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site (do NOT make the changes recommended by the 1st reviewer unless you want a glaze rather than a frosting).
This was probably the best carrot cake I've ever had. Everyone raved about it. I included the carrots, nuts, raisins, pineapple, coconut & all! Absolutely fabulous. Thank you Sam, you've made me look like a talented baker. :)
(I baked in a 9x13 glass pan for about 55 mins)

Fantastic! I took a lot of peoples advice for adding extra carrots, but next time I'm only gonna add an extra 1/2cup instead of the full 1 cup. The carrot flavor was just a bit too noticeable. I also used apple sauce for 1/4cup of the oil. I  made about half of these into cupcakes, and it worked great. Although, if anyone tries that remember that they won't rise hardly at all during baking, so fill them about 3/4's full instead of the normal 2/3's. I used currents instead of raisins since I never like baking raisins. I put a bit of cream cheese frosting although this cake didn't need it since it was moist and delicious to begin with. Lastly this cake is definitely best enjoyed after it has completely cooled.

The best carrot cake I've made ... and I've made a lot.  Thank you Sam!  Doesn't need a lot of icing.  It stands on it's own, so flavorful.  A 'little' cream cheese icing never hurt anyone, however.  Be careful to use the right size pans.  I used too large of a pan the first time and the center would not firm up without overcooking the outer edge.  This is a keeper!

If I could fill a bathtub with this cake and roll around in it, I would!  It was so incredibly good!  Substituted an extra cup of carrot in place of the coconut, and used two cake pans in place of the bundt pan.  Used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site for icing.  Very, extremely highly recommended!

Great cake.  I did make a few revisions though.  I only added 1/4 cup of oil and I added 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce.  I increased the carrot to 3 1/2 cups - after all it is carrot cake right..  I followed another persons advice and I ran the pineapple through my food processor before mixing it in.  I did not add the coconut or rasins.  Used pecans instead of walnuts and frosted it with cream cheese frosting and topped with toasted pecans.  I am guessing that had I followed the recipe exactly it would have been much heavier.  I kind of felt like adding the coconut and rasins would take away from some of the carrot flavor.  But overall - the cake was a success. Thanks

This is a very good carrot cake. I followed the directions as stated and the cake was lovely. I've made it several times and it has never come out dense, only moist and tasty. If you want a delicious carrot cake, this is the one. I've omitted the coconut when I've made it for my home and it's still wonderful. My mother in law likes coconut so I add coconut when I make it for her. As long as you keep the cake batter mixture as is, it doesn't matter what you add in or take out the cake will still be great!

I lost my beloved carrot cake recipe on a move and was crushed.  One of my coworkers had his 50th birthday and on calling his wife I found out that his favorite cake was of course carrot cake.  I thought "oh boy, I'm in trouble"  I searched all over the site and read every carrot cake and review until I fell asleep at the computer.  I decided on this one. I followed the recipe exactly, and it seemed everyone put pecans in theirs and this one had walnuts, which I think is much better.   I was so right in choosing this recipe.  It is wonderful. This is a very rich and full of wonderful goodness.  You want a fluffy cake, go buy a bland cake mix.  This is absolutely to die for and everyone raved about it at work.  Even the CEO of the company came to my office and heard of the great cake and devoured it, told me I ought to sell it.  Thank you so much for the recipe and yes, I did credit Sam for this recipe.

Wonderful Recipe!! I made this for Christmas and my entire family raved about it!! Made a few key modifications. I used 1 cup dark brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg AND allspice, although i think it could have used more of both. I also increased the carrots to 3 cups and pureed the pineapple like other reviewers suggested. Then I topped it with cream cheese frosting and walnuts. Carrot Cake Lover will rave about this recipe, especially when made in a 3 layer cake!

6 years later and this cake continues to get rave reviews - let me add my 5 stars.  This is the first cake I've ever made from scratch in my 48 years, and it was cheered by everyone.  Used lowfat buttermilk because it was all the store had at the time. Also cooked in two round cake pans and made a double layer cake.  Moist, full of good stuff.  Used Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site and it was the exact right amount - I chopped a bag of walnuts so I used the leftover and put it on the frosting. YUM!

Absolutely Fantastic. I made two versions of this cake for my moms birthday (one to practice eat, hehe) and both came out great. I only made slight changes...I used 1 cup sugar, and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of all white.  On the second final cake, I decreased the walnuts and raisens to 3/4 c each, and this was much more to my liking. I used a cream cheese icing of 8 oz cream cheese, a carton of heavy whipping cream, about 1 1/2 c of powdered sugar, 2 tsp vanilla and a dask of salt. It was great! Perfect compliment to this cake as it is not terribly sweet (just like I like it). This is the very best carrot cake, it's the one you are craving!

I was reading a lot of the negative comments on this recipe because that is what I usually read first. It amazes me that even though the recipe calls for 1 hour baking time, that bakers don't set the oven 15 minutes less just to make sure it does not overbake & burn. That is the very first lesson of baking!  always set the timer for less time so you can check for doneness.

I also used Splenda brown sugar blend to cut down on some of the carbs, soaked the raisins in the pineapple juice, used 1/2 sweetened coconut, 1/2 natural coconut, and 2 cups of well drained carrots. I used 2 9" rounds which baked at 35 minutes plus I made 3 small loaves (the size of a Texas muffin but in loaf size) which baked at 20 minutes. This cake is very delicious but there is a bit too much oil for my tastes. Next time I will make this I will add only 1/2 cup and see how it comes out. (FYI since this recipe has quite a bit of fruit, it will be dense and not fluffy.) If you want just a spice cake with some carrots, then this is not the cake for you. 

I do think it is delish because I have tried other recipes and this incorporates all of the fruits that I love in my carrot cake.

This cake has made me VERY popular!!! It really is the BEST carrot cake ever. 

I really wouldn't change anything. Just make sure you're carrots are finely shredded and not too long. I also bake in 2 9" rounds for about 45 minutes (check with toothpick for doneness).

I use the cream cheese frosting II recipe on this site and sometimes dress it up by sprinkling coconut and crushed walnuts on top.

I did NOT like this carrot cake after it was ready to eat. It was oily, too moist, easily fell apart. There seemed too much going on. I think I should have drained the pineapple and reduced the oil. I never thought I'd complain about a cake being too moist, but that can definitely be a bad thing. I think it used too much oil since I placed a piece of cake on a napkin and the napkin was totally semi soaked. I was disappointed with it at first. I put in the fridge, and it was much firmer the following morning. My fiance actually liked it. He said it reminds him of bread pudding. I think the walnuts save this cake a bit because it gives it a nice crunch between all that softness of the cake.  I think overall, it's an OK cake but it didn't impress me. I'm not sure I'll do this again unless my fiance asks me to.  If I do it again, I'll drain the pineapple and use less oil.

I am a carrot cake connoisseur and I made this recipe exactly as described.  Wow..it blew me away. Next time I will use a little less coconut and then I think I'll have the perfect carrot cake.  It tastes even better the next day!

I followed this recipe exactly, and I did not care for this.  This is not really a cake at all.  Flour in this cake is a minority ingredient.  The cake comes out smelling like an oily, eggy carrot omelet, and tastes like one too.  It has a bread pudding texture.  And no it doesn't help to refrigerate it overnight like some said.  It didn't meet the minimum standards I have to be able to serve to people and say that I made it without being embarrassed.  This is no award-winning cake. BTW, the cream cheese frosting II that people used is also not to my taste. It's not really a frosting at all, but a very cheap cream cheese filling. A cream cheese frosting would start out with a vanilla frosting base and then some cream cheese would be added to give it flavor and mellow out the sweetness.  This recipe is simply a sweetened block of cream cheese with some extra fat added -- a cream cheese "filling".  A word of advice:  while there are many good recipes

Very delicious!! I made this as a birthday cake for my husband. I followed the recipe without additions or subtractions and it was outstanding! It stayed moist for about a week until it was all gone. Super moist and so full of goodies it was a huge hit. I even ate the raisins which I don't usually care for. 
Thanks!

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! I must say that it was one of the best carrot cakes I have ever tasted and definately the best one that I have made.  Everyone raved and every piece was gone with people looking for more.  I did add a 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg just for a little added spice-type cake taste. WOnderful!!!!

Made this cake last night layered 2 9" cake pans baked for 40 min. Frosted w/Creamcheese Frosting II was just what I had hoped for. Mom use to make this & I remembered it had crushed pineapple and coconut! Loved it!

This was a great recipe -- I made it for my mom's birthday, and everyone told me it was the best carrot cake that they had ever had.  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe as recommended, and sprinkled nuts on top just like the picture.  I now have the right cake to start my own traditions!

Thank you, Sam, for this wonderful recipe! It's my first carrot cake and I love it! The instructions were easy, I didn't change anything and it worked out great. Next time I will make sure to add some lemon or orange rind for richer aroma. Very nice!

I have baked many cakes over the years especially for fundraisers. This is by far the best carrot cake recipe I have ever tried. Just the one I was looking for just as it is. I also have made it gluten free for myself by substituting the flour for a gluten free flour mix and it turned out beautifully!

Excellent recipe! I only made a couple minor changes to suit my tastes. I'm not big on raisins and/or nuts in my food, so I omitted the raisins. I included the walnuts, but I ground them up with a mortar and pestle so there weren't any chunks. I used two round cake pans for a two-layer cake and baked them for 50 minutes, as per another review, which was perfect. I frosted it with the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site that others recommended (with one extra cup of sugar in the recipe and one extra tsp vanilla). It was fantastic! The chef in the family loved it, and I overheard my father-in-law say to my mother-in-law that it's probably the best carrot cake he's ever had! I'll definitely be making this one again.

Honestly, I've been baking for over 15 years and I have no trouble following directions. I followed the directions exactly for this recipe and what I ended up with was chewy rubbery cake that tasted very bland. I thought I’d give it another try and add more carrot/cinnamon and ended up even more disappointed! I don’t know what went wrong as I can see everyone has given it a raving review which is one of the reasons I chose the recipe in the first place. Very disappointed :-( I will stick with the Carrot Cake III  recipe on here by Tammy Elliott.

OK, I debated writing my review after the first time I made this cake, but now that I've made it twice within one month and have received such great feedback, I can't hold off any longer. This cake is FABULOUS! Seriously, this is the best carrot cake I've ever had. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I omitted the walnuts and coconut for my own tastes and allergies. Because of this omission, I added about 1/2 cup more carrots. I baked it in two 9 inch round pans and cut the cook time down by 20 minutes. I frosted it with the Cream Cheese II recipe from this site. It is a very dense, moist and heavy cake. OMG! Everyone loves this cake and it holds very well for several days. I think I gained 5 lbs. snacking on the leftovers for 3 days straight. Thank you for a great recipe!

Really good carrot cake - not too sweet and very moist.  Don't care for coconut so I added a little extra carrot and some grated ginger.  Topped with a Lemon zest cream cheese frosting.

I was so disappointed this morning. I spent the morning preparing this to take to my mom's for our Easter party. I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out like mush. The toothpick came out clean and the cake looked burnt. I wanted to cry.

This recipe is great!! I followed it exactly. I made cupcakes though.I  used cream cheese frosting II like others suggested and topped with crushed walnuts and toasted coconut. I also dipped my finger in a cinnamon and nutmeg mixture and rolled my fingers together over the cupcakes...so the mixture was litely sprinkled on the frosting. Yum!

Oh my....this cake is amazing! My husband said it is the best carrot cake he has ever had. I left out the raisins and walnuts and increased the carrots to 3 cups. It was super easy to make and came out PERFECT! I frosted it with Whipped Cream Cream Cheese frosting recipe from here. Absolutely perfect together. LOVE this recipe...thank you!

I am the world's biggest carrot cake fan and this carrot cake is literally the BEST I have ever eaten, let alone made. DELICIOUS, incredible, amazing...YUM! It took this to a birthday party and it was devoured within 20 minutes. I have never gotten so many compliments on a cake before. My girlfriend's husband said he would pay me to make this for him, haha. :-)  I used half of the oil it called for and replaced the remaining half with applesauce. I think that the buttermilk is what seals the deal, though. So moist and rich... Baked it in two 9" round pans for 32 minutes at 350 degrees. Absolutely perfect!  For the cream cheese icing, I used a 8 oz. of softened reduced fat cream cheese, a 1/2 c. softened butter, 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla, about 6 cups of powdered sugar, and 1/4 c. of sour cream. It was the best icing I've ever made.   If you love carrot cake, try this recipe. You will fall in love!

i was really disappointed in this recipe. i was all excited to make it and to bring it to the park where i meet up with some people with our dogs...but not sure i will be bringing it now.  this cake was WAY too bland. it wasn't sweet enough at all either. even putting icing on didn't help at all. it just doesn't taste like much of anything. though i did omit the raisins/walnuts/and coconut which is a part of the recipe. but i didn't have any of those things. i've made a carrot cake before that didn't have any of that either and it was a LOT better. sorry!

Outstanding!  Baked in a glass 12 x 8 dish at 325 degrees and it was done in 50 minutes - absolutely perfect.  Iced with Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting and chilled before serving.  EDIT:  I now use Cream Cheese Frosting II for a thicker icing, and sprinkle walnuts on top!  I have also used 2 round 9" pans at 350 for 40 minutes. Still making this cake and loving it!

Some things to note before you attempt this recipe: standard can of crushed pineapple is 20 oz, adding the full can will make the cake very wet (though still delicious). I thought increasing the salt to 1/2 tsp better balanced the flavor of the cake, and the oil could be reduced to 1/2 c without altering the texture or moisture of the cake. Also, trading brown sugar for the white sugar increased the complexity of the flavor, though made the cake a little darker in color. Overall, very versatile recipe, can be spiced up or left to have a simple but basic cinnamon flavor. Good with a dusting of powdered sugar or a rich cream cheese frosting.

I made this recipe last night, following almost all the directions. I did substitute applesauce for the oil, since I prefer this option in all my baked dishes. I made two- 9inch cakes, and used half of the cream cheese frosting II recipe to frost the cakes and layer them. I let the cake set overnight so the flavors could really develope, and it was worth the wait. It was so moist and flavorful! Very tasty! Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't have buttermilk, so I did the vinegar-in-regular-milk thing and it still was an excellent flavored carrot cake. Be warned that it creates a lot of dirty dishes to make this. And, the carrots actually stained my food processor and spatulas. But, I totally forgot about that, after the first bite of this sweet & perfect cake.

I made this the other day for my family and co-workers and they could not stop raving about it. Everyone said it was the best carrot cake they've ever had. It was very moist and had lots of flavor!

**Note: I used pecans instead of walnuts and didn't use raisins because I'm not a big fan.

I made this recipe into 36 standard sized muffins for a family get together.  Instead of the walnuts I added 2 heaping tablespoons of flaxseed.  Sooo Good!  I will be making these again.  Thanks Brian for the great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe! I made it exactly as written without any changes and it came out perfect--not too moist and not too crumbly. It really does not need an icing but I did use a cream cheese frosting. It was done after 40 min in my convection oven.

OMG, this cake is awesome. I followed the recipe exactly using 3 9" round cake pans. I followed it up the the cream cheese frosting II and it was delicious. Make this cake I made this for my mom's 86th birthday. There was none left. Make this cake, you won't regret it!

Wow, I was just going through my recipes and realized that I never got around to rating this one. It is amazing as is, I however have been playing with it a little just to make it a little more guilt free. I now make it with only 1c. of sugar and have replaced 2/3 of the oil with unsweetened applesauce. I reduced the oil a bit each time so maybe we haven't noticed because of that but it is still certainly extremely moist and sweet enough, especially when topped with a good cream cheese frosting. I seem to remember another reviewer complaining about the texture. Make sure to use the to use the small holes on the grater for the carrots, they should turn out very juicy this way. I also boil the raisins in apple juice for a few minutes then let them sit in the hot juice until I am ready to add them to the recipe...nice and plump and juicy this way. I have had so many compliments on this recipe, always a treat to bring this one to the table. Thanks so much for a great recipe, I've been looking for a keeper for years and this is definately it!

The very best carrot cake recipe out there.  I made the cake exactly as called for and it turned out GREAT.  I would suggest, per a previous reviewer, to simmer the raisins in orange or pineapple juice to plump them up a bit.  Also, be sure you really strain the juice off the pineapple before mixing into the batter.  This is a true carrot cake recipe and worth the effort!

I didn't think I made many changes, but I did.  Instead of buttermilk, I used 1 tbsp lemon juice to sour regular milk.  I did not use raisins-although next time I will.  I added a shake of nutmeg, increased the carrots (used 3-4 cups I think), forgot to add the vanilla, added 4oz of applesauce as a substitute for some of the oil-only used about 1/2c oil.  I used the 'cream cheese II' recipe from this site and the cake was great!  In fact, a friend from work said that my carrot cake nearly measured up to his- apparently, that's high praise!  Thanks to Sam and his family for this easy, delicious and sort of 'healthy' cake!  YUM!  UPDATE!  I have had RAVE REVIEWS from EVERYONE from work- MANY requests for the recipe and MANY, MANY thank yous for bringing it in!  Many people can't believe it was low-ish fat!  Thanks so much!!!!!!!

I was really happy with this version of carrot cake. The ONLY thing I would change next time is to add less raisins. My husband and I are not huge raisin fans so I would half the amount of raisins or omit them all together. I LOVED the walnuts and even added them on top of the cake after the icing. I thought this cake was moist enough to make as a loaf without the icing as well. Overall an excellent recipe and definite keeper!

Excellent recipe! I made it into a 3 layer round cake and put a cream cheese frosting between the layers and topped the cake off with the same frosting- it was a hit with my guests and there were no leftovers!

Delicious!  The texture and taste is right on for the kind of deserts I like.  I used baking raisins which add extra moisture and it turned out perfect.  I made a cream cheese icing by using a package of cream cheese, 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 2 tsp. vanilla, and 1/4 cup whipping cream.  I can't wait to take it my aunt's for dinner tomorrow!

Wow!  This was my very first foray into baking carrot cake, and it was a hit.  Everyone loved it!  Left out the raisins, however, because I don't like raisins.  I can't wait to make it again.  Tastes even better the second day!

Best carrot cake recipe, it has all the key ingredients: carrots, coconut, raisins,pineapple, buttermilk and uses minimum oil. Very moist and is the best tasting carrot cake. 
    Because of my personal taste, on the spices I used: 1 1/2t cinnamon, 1/4t ginger, 1/2t cardamon.

As a carrot cake lover, after reading most of the reviews, I decided to try this recipe. Unfortunately, this was not a successful endeavor for me. I had enough batter to make a bundt cake AND six cupcakes.  Even after baking the cake for over 2 hours, it still wasn't fully done inside! I conceded and determined that most of my efforts were made in vain. The outside was a beautiful, albeit deep golden brown, but the inside, although flavorful, was still too wet and somewhat gooey. The cupcakes baked for over 30 minutes - the outside was nicely browned, but the inside was slightly mushy. The telltale sign was that prior to baking, the batter was very loose, apparently from too much liquid, however, I followed the recipe exactly, so I really don't know where I went wrong. Fortunately, the cream cheese icing I made was delicious. My DH, (bless his heart!) acknowledged my efforts and complimented the flavors, but I knew better - I need to find a different carrot cake recipe on 'ar.com'

I didn't like this cake at all. I made this last night and let it stand in my fridge overnight. It tastes nothing like a cake, more of a bread that is too moist. I've been making carrot cake using another recipe for years and wanted to try something new. I'm very disappointed. I didn't like the coconut in the cake, the whole cake is just tasteless.

I am obsessed with carrot cake and my fav is genuardis.  I am in the process of finding a recipe I can make myself that taste similar to it.  Every year I make a carrot cake for the Easter Bunny.  I made this recipe tonight.  WAY TOO MANY raisins and walnuts (which is actually my favorite part of this cake).  It was not sweet enough.

Made this for family and they loved it. Tastes like the real this and not a grocery store rip off cake. 
I used Cream Cheese Frosting II and frosted a two layer 9 in cake nicely. 

UPDATE: Made this again for my boyfriends family thanksgiving. Someone said in a completly serious way "This is the best cake I've ever had". I guess it was a hit! People were fond of the "natural" taste to it.  I leave out the raisons and cut down just slightly on the walnuts. Will keep this recipe forever.

This recipes is going to be a staple in our house, even for my husband who doesn't like nuts in things.  We decided to make it a little healthier and used Splenda in place of the sugar, and egg substitute in place of whole eggs.  Next time we'll probably replace the oil with applesauce and do 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour.

Then for frosting we followed the advice of another reviewer and creamed 2 pkgs of neufatel cheese with 1 stick of butter, 1 tsp of both almond and vanilla extract and then added almost a whole 2lb bag of powdered sugar.  This was actually too sweet for our taste - I think 3/4 of a bag would be plenty.  Next time we're going to experiment with Splenda in the frosting and maybe fat free cream cheese.

We took this to a family gathering with the changes described and didn't tell anyone that we used splenda in the cake and they all raved!  Excellent!

Updated 7/21/08:
We made it again yesterday but this time replaced all the oil with applesauce and used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour and baked it in two cake pans for 45 minutes.  

Although it didn't seem to rise as much, and wasn't quite as moist, it still had a great flavor and was very satisfying.  We received rave reviews once again!

Absolutely fabulous!  I made it for Mother's Day everyone said it was the best carrot cake they ever had.  I only added 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup oil and omitted raisins (personal taste) it was perfect.  I made it in 2 9inch round pans and it only took about 45 minutes to cook.

I have never had any other carrot cake that compares with this recipe. Heavenly.  Moist, layers of flavor, and so good it needs no icing.  But I usually do use icing. I use pecans rather than walnuts. My husband loves carrot cake and he has declared this one the best ever. So do our friends when I serve it to them. I like the Brown Sugar Cream Cheese Frosting from the site for this cake.

I made this recipe as cupcakes for my son's birthday party.  They were a HUGE hit with my entire family (including my incredibly picky husband -- he asks for this cake often).  I did leave out the raisins because we aren't fond of them.  
I paired it with Cream Cheese Frosting II -- the cake isn't too sweet, so it's perfect with a really sweet topping.

I tried this for my daughter's birthday cake last year and she loved it. I will have  to make it every year for her. This is really a wonderful cake. The only thing I did differently is to omit the raisins which she doesn't like, but I do, so if I make it for me I will keep them in.

Best carrot cake I've ever made/had!  The only thing I changed was that I didn't have crushed pineapple, so I used just under 8 oz. of pineapple juice instead.  I baked 3 layers (with a slightly shorter baking time) and covered them with homemade cream cheese frosting.  My family couldn't stop raving about this cake!

I've been making this recipe for the past few years.  Everyone LOVES it.  Very moist and delicious.

One review mentioned bringing the raisins to a boil in orange juice and then cooling to soften~works great..Thank you!

This carrot cake is PERFECT by the 3rd day. This recipe is perfect cuz it doesn't have too much cinnamon. I love cinnamon but I don't want my carrot cake to taste like a spice cake so this is perfect for me. The first day I decided I didn't like the raisins (which I had simmered in O.J. prior to adding) but the 3rd day I LOVED them in! I made a 13x9 and 45 min was perfect...I let mine cook for 50 and that extra 5 min dried the outer corners of the cake a bit.

This recipe lives up to its full five star rating on here. This was my first time making a carrot cake from scratch. I followed the recipe with the exception of leaving out the pineapple and raisins because I didn't have any. I baked mine in two round silicone pans and created a layered cake. There is a local over the top place called Extraordinary Desserts in San Diego and I have the cookbook from there, I decided to create an "extraordinary cake" using tips from the cookbook. I make a simple vanilla syrup and while the cakes were still hot from the oven, I poured the syrup over them and allowed them to soak. I assembled the cakes in a cake pan putting an orange cream cheee frosting in the middle as a filling. I froze the cake to allow the filling to set firmly in place. I iced the outide of the cake with an extra allspice-y cream cheese frosting and made an almond/white chocolate crunch for the sides. This cake was phenomenal!

This is THE BEST carrot cake!!!  I will never use another recipe!!!  Have made it twice now!  I have a new favorite!!  First time making it I followed the recipe exactly.  Second time I used 1 cup white sugar and half cup brown.  I think I liked the 2nd version better using the brown sugar.  Beyond that simple change this is  an amazing cake!!!  I might try it next time with applesauce instead of oil.

Made 2 small alterations to this recipe to make it a bit more healthy but it did not change the flavor one bit. I used "sun crystals vs sugar (part stevia & pure cane sugar) use half as much sugar than recipe calls for when using sun crystals. I also used no sugar added applesauce instead of oil. I also used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1cup white flour vs all white flour & then I decided to boil the rasins in orange juice & let simmer for about 5min & then added as recipe called. 

Made this for my husband who is a carrot cake lover. He is always saying it is hard to find a really good carrot cake. He LOVED this cake. He said it has EVERYTHING a carrort cake should have. My father told me this was THE BEST carrot cake he had ever eaten. The texture and density were spot on. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! This is a keeper in my recipe box.

I made this cake for my mother 2 years ago and she told me that it was the best carrot cake she's ever eaten.  I still make this cake all of the time and any time I mention that I'm making it, she pipes up, "That was the best cake I've ever had!"  Says it all, I think.  Moist, delicious, not too sweet and perfect with cream cheese frosting (with one lemon rind grated in).  Perfect carrot cake, truly!

I have used this same recipe for over 30 years!  It is by far, the best!  I am away from home and needed 'my' recipe that I had left at home.  My family LOVES this recipe! Have fun with it, substitute some of the carrots for zucchini , substitute some of the walnuts with pecans and pistachios, substitute some of the pineapple for  finely chopped apple, substitute some of the raisins with craisins or other dried fruit for a wonderful 'Morning Glory' breakfast muffin!

YUMMY!  I used my 9x13 glass pan.  I didnt have buttermilk, so I used 2% milk and 1t lemon juice.  I also decreased the raisins, coconut and walnuts to 3/4c each and increased the carrots to 3c.  I did use my Food Processor and it made shredding the carrots and crushing the pineapple a cinch. Baked at 350 degrees for 55 minutes and it came out absolutely perfect!  This was phenomenal!  I honestly didnt even think I liked carrot cake, since I have never had one that I could say was good, well this one is excellent and thank you for posting, cause now I am a carrot cake addict!!  YUMMY

Perfect, moist carrot cake. I made these for Easter and everyone loved them. I made them into cupcakes just to make it easier to bring to my Mom's and my MIL's.  I topped them with cream cheese icing and a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar. This will definitely be my go to carrot cake.

Amazing!! Made it exactly as is, but omitted the raisins because I'm not a fan...Super moist and delicious! I used two 9" round cake pans and decorated with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site (added some lemon juice & zest for more flavour!).

This is an easy and excellent recipe for carrot cake. I cut my sugar to only 1/2 cup, and it was plenty sweet from the pineapple and raisins. What a beautiful springtime cake with fresh carrots! So easy to whip together. Will never have to buy another carrot cake again!

This is amazing! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out luscious, very moist and tasty. I baked it in an 11 x 13 pan which cut the baking time to about 45 minutes. I made this for one of my best friends birthday and he loved it. Everyone that ate a piece raved about how good it was and everyone could tell it was "scratch" made.

I made this carrot cake for Easter this year and burned it to a crisp. The recipe called to bake it for an hour, I made two 9 inch cakes and didnt adjust the time so it burned. Thought i'd write in to remind others to adjust the time to about 30 minutes if your making two smaller cakes instead of the 8x12 so no one else makes the same mistake I did. I was heart broken.

This really is the best carrot cake!  I had not made a carrot cake for a while and searched this site for a recipe, reviewing several submissions before deciding on this one.  Everyone who ate it loved it loved it loved it!!!  I personally omitted the coconut, walnuts, and pineapple as I did not have any on hand and did not recall using them previously, so I doubled the carrots to four cups to keep the volume correct.  I used a cream cheese frosting to top it.  It was moist, sweet, savory, satisfying, delicious - all around winner for any occasion; and it was easy to make too!

This recipe was definitely 5 star AFTER sitting for a day.  I served it the day I made it and while it was good, it tasted like it was missing "something". This recipe made 24 cupcakes and I baked them for 30 minutes.  I'll absolutely make it again, but I'll prepare it (and frost it) the day before I need it.

I made this,  just as written ,and it was excellent. There was a large party of people who thought it was the best recipe  for carrot cake they had ever eaten. I baked it in a 9 X 13 pan, as it was the only one I had, and it was perfect. I also used the cream cheese II frosting which was delicious. I highly recommend this recipe!

This cake will live forever!! Sumptuous, mouth watering , healthy and irresistably
yummy! (Because I'm sensitive to sugar I used Xylitol instead.I used 1 and a quarter cups.I also used stoneground wholemeal flour.) This is the best cake I have EVER made and my teenage sons and husband LOVED it! Thank you Sam!

EXCELLENT! I am a nurse and while this takes awhile to make it is 100% worth it. At work I am always asked to bring "my" famous carrot cake. I tell them it's Sam's Famous cake but they insist since I am the one cooking it is my famous carrot cake! I use 50-75% wheat flour and the rest all-purpose and you can't even tell.

There's no better carrot cake!  This is easy to make and absolutely delicious, without being too heavy like some cakes.  I shredded the carrot in the blender with a little water, then strained them, and they were ready in two minutes.

Wow!  This cake was the best carrot cake I've ever made.  Actully, it was the best I've ever tasted, which is saying a lot :)  I added more carrots and pineapple in place of the raisins (didn't miss 'em).  The cake is very moist and the pineapple, carrot, and coconut are fabulous together!  What a hit- everyone absolutely LOVED it!!  will make it again and again

My husband does not really eat cake that much.  But when I made this one, he fell in love with it.  He keeps on telling me, "I really like that carrot cake.  I like it best among the cakes you've made."  I just excluded grated coconut because I don't like it.  But it still turned well.

Made recipe exactly as-is for Easter event and it was a huge hit by everyone. My father-in-law LOVES carrot cake and he told me I definitely need to make this again. Made as double layer round cake and topped with cream cheese icing (½ c butter, 8oz cream cheese, 1 tsp vanilla, 3 c powdered sugar).

I followed this recipe and the only thing I changed was using gluten free flour blend in place of regular flour. This carrot cake is such a hit that its a regular staple on the dessert menu at my restaurant. people think that gluten free is hard to do, but this recipe give a moist delicious cake. It does not rise super high, so I bake it in a 12x19 cookie sheet with rounded sides. when the cake has cooled I add the frosting, cut it in half and double stack it, giving it a thick look. customers who do not have gluten issues love this cake as well. It stays moist and does well even if you decide to portion and freeze it.

Amazing carrot cake. I'm a professional pastry chef, I was looking for a carrot cake recipe I could quickly make for my family at home (and doesn't serve 50!) and this hit the spot. Came together very quickly, I made 2 changes, just based on my family's taste preferences. 
I only used a shy 1/2 cup of coconut (we're not huge coconut fans) and I also used about a 1/2 cup raisins, which I covered with hot water, a generous TB of butter and microwaved for 3 min. To soften and add moisture to them. Fantastic. Baked in a 9x13 pan, so it was like a sheet cake,  added a simple cream cheese icing to top, perfection. 
Thank you for sharing the recipe with us, it's delicious!

Famous carrot cake is right. I did not make this myself, my aunt made this cake for Easter. I asked her if she made any changes and she just said she added a lot more shredded carrots. A LOT MORE. She did mention that she was worried about the cake turning out because the batter was very wet.......but speaking as one who had a piece, it was the best carrot cake I have EVER HAD. Very moist, very flavorful. She iced it with Martha Stewart's cream cheese icing. EXCELLENT CAKE.

I've made this recipe at least four times, and it's turned out beautifully every time. I did decrease the amount of sugar to 1/4 cups because the raisins and pineapple juice are sweet. I also used 1/4 cup each of olive oil and applesauce instead of the 3/4 cup of vegetable oil. I leave out the coconut flakes because no one likes that in our family. Oh, and my baking time is usually around 30-40 mins, not the hour the recipe called for, so watch your cooking time! Definitely give this recipe a try...you won't regret it!

This recipe is phenomenal! It's not too sweet, it's chock full of all the delicious things that make this a real carrot cake.  I modified it slightly with some recommendations from other reviewers: added another cup of carrots, used 1 cup white and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, used applesauce instead of oil, I boiled the raisins in oj (OMG!), added a bit of allspice and nutmeg, almond extract and a lemon rind. I topped it with a mix of cream cheese and vanilla bean icing from Williams-Sonoma (their icings are insane!).  My partner can't stop raving about it, the neighbors love it as well as all of those at work. This will definitely be my 'secret' recipe from now on. Thanks, Grandpa Sam, for making my first scratch carrot cake a hit!!

Since I love reading recipes and culling ingredients to make the best recipe, I compared this, the most popular carrot cake recipe with a much beloved recipe from my childhood (I'm over 50).  Humorously, it is the exact same ingredients except that my recipe calls for only 1/2 cup of oil. This is the best recipe ever! I've made it in a 9x13 pan, but also a bundt pan or a tube pan (angel food cake pan). Bake for an hour.         My recipe came with a recipe for a glaze of 2/3 cup sugar, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/3 cup buttermilk, 1/3 cup melted butter and 2 tsp corn syrup. Boil for 5 minutes, remove from heat and add 1/2 tsp vanilla. Prick the warm cake and pour over the cake.        I was well into adulthood before I was surprised to learn about cream cheese frosting for carrot cake! LOL. 
YUM! I wholeheartedly recommend this recipe as is. These days I prefer cream cheese frosting over the glaze, but if you have less of a sweet tooth, try the glaze.

Most excellent!   All agreed this was the best carrot cake they had ever had.   My sister said this could well be the "best thing" I ever made.  I did substitute coconut with carrots only because I knew I would have a few guest who don't really care for coconut.
Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site was excellent as well.

I baked sam's famous carrot cakes for my own pleasure; yet unexpectedly I ended up serving them to many people. Everybody just loved it and asked for the recipe. I used only 1 cup of sugar and a little less than 3/4 cup oil. We don't have vanilla extract in this part of the world so I used 3/4 teaspoon of vanillin and 2 teaspoons of Baileys. I skipped the coconuts. My small cup cake moulds take approximately 2 heaping tablespoons, so with this recipe I had 20 cup cakes. They baked in approxiamtely 28 minutes. I loved how moisty, light and delicious they were. Sam's cake is in my list of favourites now.

Thank you grandpa Sam and thank you Brian for sharing it.

Delicious!  Two people at our Easter dinner said it was the best carrot cake they have ever eaten.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I baked it in two round pans to make a layer cake.  I frosted with cream cheese frosting, like everyone else.  This will be my go-to carrot cake recipe, but I think next time I will try it without the raisins.

Amazing carrot cake! I made this cake yesterday, followed the recipe as it is, except that I added one more teaspoon of vanilla extract and did the milk+lime trick instead of buttermilk, all keeping the measures. To be honest, the cake is AWESOME! The only thing I noticed is that it might be a little too sugary, but I blame the canned pineapple I used because it comes with a sugary juice. Next time I'll try either to use natural pineapple or reduce the one a half cups of sugar to one. 
I know some people might find this cake too heavy, I'd recommend to try reducing the amount of pineapple (half, maybe) since pineapple adds density & weight to the cake.
I frosted the cake with half recipe cream cheese frosting II ... it was delicious, my fiance and my neighbors loved it!!

I followed the recipe exactly as written, with the exception of the pan. I made a 3 layer cake and baked it for 35 minutes. Without a doubt it's the best carrot cake I've ever had. Maybe even the best cake period. I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II found on this site.

This cake was excellent, it was even better the next day.  So moist!  I used 1/2 coconut and baked it in two 8 inch round cake pans for 40 minutes.  It was great!

AMAZING! I just decided one morning (yeah, this is how I use my days off haha) that I was going to make a from scratch carrot cake and googled "best homemade carrot cake", and lo and behold found this gem! While more intensive than I normally put into baking...okay, really it was just having to shred all those darn carrots!!!...it was well worth it! I took half of it to work and it was gone within an hour! Everyone agreed the texture is amazing and all the ingredients work so well together...as suggested I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II--again, soooo good! DO NOT TAKE OUT THE RAISINS, PINEAPPLE, COCONUT OR WALNUTS (unless you're allergic, you won't regret it!!) 

All in all this is a wonderful cake and well worth five stars, and definitely worth grating all those carrots! ;)

I made the most amazing cake with this recipe.
I omitted the coconut, raisins, and walnuts, because I was looking for something a little more plain jane.

Everyone raves about this cake.
I topped it with this cream cheese icing recipe:
1 package cream cheese (8 oz)
1 stick butter (8 tablespoons)
2-4 cups confectioners sugar (add little at a time and taste)
1 1/2 teaspoons imitation vanilla (I think if you use pure vanilla extract cut it to 1 tsp)
Throw all the ingredients in a bowl and mixed with a spoon until the confectioners sugar was incorporated.  Use hand mixer on med. for less then a minute.

You'll love this cake.  Make it.

I give this five stars but I think it needs some sort of icing to elevate it to a truly five-star dessert.  So after baking it in a bundt pan for 45 minutes, I cooled it and topped it with a simple cream cheese-confectioner's sugar-grated meyer lemon zest icing, thinned with a bit of heavy cream till just spreadable.  Having said that, the cake itself is wonderfully moist and not too sweet and it will be my go-to carrot cake recipe from now on.  Many thanks to Brian (and Sam!) for an excellent recipe.

This was very good and moist.  I added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and omitted the raisins.  I baked in bundt pan for 55 mins.  This recipe would definitely benefit from cream cheese frosting as the cake itself is not very sweet.  Very good carrot cake and will make again.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday.  This recipe got rave reviews from my tough to please family.  They said that that I will be making this cake for everyone's birthdays from now on.  Some changes that I made:  I did not have buttermilk so I substituted 3/4 C milk and 1 tsp lemon juice.  I used 3 Cups of carrots and 1/2 cup walnuts and 1/2 cup pecans.  I also added 1/8 tsp nutmeg.  I baked it in a 9x13 at 350 degrees for about 35-40mins and it came out amazing!  Thanks for sharing this family recipe :)

I'd give this 10 stars  if I could.  I'll make a long story short. I'd never made a homemade carrot cake before.   I'm a mom to 6 daughters and an excellent cook  and have made many cakes  from scratch; so with a good recipe I don't worry..  This could have been disastrous but it wasn't..
I made this Monday for my husbands 50th birthday party Tuesday. 
We have 6  daughters.. lots of birthdays, lots of cake that he rarely eats. He is not a sweets person. On his birthday though  when he found out I'd made him a carrot cake?  He didn't want to get too full on smoked ribs, baked beans, potato salad,  etc..he WANTED to have room for cake..
The actual review:
I omitted  the coconut (he hates coconut), walnuts and raisins. I increased the carrots to 3 cups (as suggested by another baker).
I also tripled the recipe for a 12 x 18 x 2 pan   
There was SOME batter left over but not THAT much

I cannot begin to convey how much my husband (and everyone else in attendance) LOVED this cake..
I topped it with  Cream Cheese Frosting II (available on Allrecipes) and the marriage of the two was mouthwatering in every way..

THIS will be a cake I'll make again and again and again..

I love a good carrot cake and this is a good one.  My husband doesn't care for carrot cake but he ate more of this one than I did.  He made sure I kept the recipe because he liked it so well. Next time I make it I'm going to hide some cake for me so he doesn't eat it all.

AWESOME recipe but I tweeked it a little..
It was a little heavy on walnuts and light on raisins for my taste, so next time I'll probably halve the walnuts and maybe add a half cup more raisins.

And a little tip, I soaked my raisins overnight in whiskey. Added a great touch. :)

Great recipe.  Instead of taking an hour to drive to the grocery store for buttermilk I substituted whole milk and added a tablespoon of baking powder.  Cake turned out just fine.

This cake it is insane I did tweek it a bit. For the cake I did not add nuts or coconut to the mix I used 3 C of carrots. I toasted the coconut so those that did love it they just sprinkled it on top of their slices they did and loved it. I also heated in the micro wave 1 cup or so of OJ, & of the pinapple juice just enough to cover the hard raisons I happen to have and let them sit until cooled then drained them they were plump and full of  flavor. I did up the salt to just ½ tsp not sure if this mattered did not hurt. I did have to use 2 8 inch pans and cooked at 350 for apx 45 min my caked was not a fluffy cake it was a cross between fluffy and pudding I also made it a second time in the 8x12 pan as directed.  for the frosting I used 4Tbl butter & added zest of one large lemon finely chopped & a splash of lemon juice, it added yet another amazing note of flavor to this frosting, I love the cheese flavor but make it your own as far as sweetness, all I had was 1 8oz pkg of cream cheese and maybe a ¼ of another I added 2 1/4 cups of confectioner sugar (might add less) 2 tsp of vanilla and I happen to have a splash left of half and half so that was added for a more smooth frosting, I decided to drain another 8oz can of pinapple and add it to the frosting along with the zest of 2 lemons chopped fine yum. This cake was more than a hit it has now been requested as everyone’s new birthday cake and has ordered one for Christmas. This cake is very forgiving and well worth your time.

LOVE IT!!! Everyone begs for this cake. The only suggestions I have is break up the pineapple before adding. It will add to the mystery of the cake's goodness. I make this in two 9" pans. This is so much easier than cutting the cake in half. Reduce the cook time to 25-30 minutes.

Hands down the BEST carrot cake!!  One suggestion is to add  a little pineapple juice to the cream cheese frosting.  Perfect contrast from the sweet cake to the tangy frosting.

This is a really good carrot cake.  The only thing I did different was I added pecans instead of walnuts and I added in 1/2 teaspoon of allspice for that extra kick.  I think it's important to not change the buttermilk to regular milk.  The buttermilk makes the cake tender.

Absolutely awesome!  Nice textured cake.  For a smoother texture, I would omit the walnuts.  Otherwise, great taste and definitely my go to carrot cake recipe!  Fabulous with the cream cheese icing 2 recipe with 3 cups sugar instead of only 2.

This is the very best carrot cake!  Have have made it numerous times.  It is my go-to carrot cake for any special occasion.  Simply Excellent.  I have made it as a layer cake, in a 9 x 13 pan, cupcakes.  I even made mini cupcakes for my daughters engagement party.  I always ice with a cream cheese frosting.  Well...I am back at my recipe box.  I am planning my Easter dinner.  This will definitely be on the menu!

Super Delicious!  I used two 8" round pans and baked it for about 30 min.  I used pecans instead of walnuts.  For the frosting I just used about 1 1/2 tubs of Betty Crocker Cream Cheese frosting.  I was a bit hesitant with all of the ingredients, but am so happy I decided to make it!

Man, I don't know what has happened. I followed the recipe exactly and my carrot cake turned out so wet and not cooked in the middle. Not a carrot cake like at The Cheese Cake Factory at all. Not like any other for that matter. Don't know if draining the pineapple and squeeze out the carrot would help. The frosting turned out great, though. Where did I go wrong???? With so much other fruits in the ingredients, I was afraid that it would turned out like a fruit cake. But never had the chance to taste it-I threw the cake in the trash can----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Update: I baked another carrot cake, using the Cheesecake Factory cheese cake/carrot cake recipe elsewhere on the web., and it turned out absolutely great. Comparing the ingredients to this Sam's Carrot Cake and the difference is the 3/4 cup buttermik. I did increase the baking time to another 20 min. or so, but apparently, that didn't help. No other carrot cake recipe called for this buttermilk. This, along with the pineapple, I think is just much too much liquid in the cake.

My father complimented it!! And that is reserved only for what tastes the best! I did simmer the raisins in boiling water with 1 cinnamon stick, 10 cloves, lemon & orange peel 1/2 a nutmeg and 2 star anise seeds.  The pinneapple I used was chunked and I processed it a little on a manual food processor. That way it retained more moisture even after baked. I also added a dash of ground ginger and ground clove.  The first time I baked it following the exact recipe it was a little dry, which is why I made the changes mentioned above.  I will surely be making this again and again in the future! Thanks Sam!

I have made this recipe many times and have even made into cupcakes.  It has been my sister's birthday cake almost every year since my mom found this recipe.  Everyone always loves it and they say it is the best carrot cake they have ever had.  I have never changed a thing with the ingredients.

This is awesome.  I couldn't wait to make icing for it and ate more than a sample out of the cake.  This one will be mine.  The only things I did different was added some orange juice (a couple oz) to my leftover pineapples to make 8 oz. Used 13 x 9 pan which required less cooking time. about 35 to 45 minutes.  used up some small boxes of raisins probably not totaling 1 cup but close and I didn't have walnuts so I used pecans - only a handful (I have small hands).  It was great.  This will be the carrot cake recipe that I keep.  For people who don't like coconut you can't even tell it's there it is such a great blend..yummmmmy..

I wanted a carrot cake recipe with less oil and this one was perfect. I put the pineapple in the food processor to make a smoother texture, put 1/4 cup of applesauce in place of part of the oil, and left out the walnuts & raisins. The cake was moist and rich, and this will now be my "go-to" carrot cake recipe.

My search for the ultimate carrot cake is finally over.  This cake is AMAZING!  I like my carrot cake with a little extra spice so I added 2 tsp. freshly grated ginger and 1/2 tsp. ground cloves.  Perfect!  I also used 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white... I like the flavor of the brown sugar over just the white, and it also helps retain the moisture of the cake.  Also toasted my walnuts for that extra bit of flavor.  Baked this in 2, 9" round pans for about 35-40 minutes.  Frosted with cream cheese icing and decorated it for my sister's birthday.  This cake is JUST like the one I love at a certain restaurant around here.  YUM!!  Highly recommended!!

I substituted 1/4c of oil with applesauce to make it a bit more "healthy", and everyone who has tried it said it's by far THE BEST carrot cake they've ever had!  I plan on submitting it in this year's Barnstable county fair...I'd keep my fingers crossed but by the personal reviews along with my own, I don't think that's necessary!!!

Very moist and easy to make.  I used the packaged buttermilk (which you add water to)and put cream cheese icing on it.  Didn't last too long.  I am not a lover of carrot cake, but this was exceptional.

This carrot cake is AMAZING! 
It is incredibly moist and flavorful, I used cream cheese frosting, and it was a hit!
I do suggest toasting the walnuts beforehand, though.

I've been searching for a really good carrot cake recipe for years...and this is it!  I had a good recipe, which was in a booklet that came with a Cuisinart food processor.  I gave the processor to a daughter, along with the booklet.  When I went to make the cake again, I realized I had given away the recipe and called my daughter.  She had tossed the booklet.
And I had never found a recipe that matched it, but this one is even better.  I didn't change a thing.  I've been handing out servings to family and friends in the neighborhood and now I have to print up copies of the recipe for every single one who got a piece...they all raved about it.
Thank you uncle Sam.

I made this for my husband last night. He loves carrot cake. My husband said that it was good. He also said that it wasn't sweet enough so I'll add a little more sugar next time. But, he still said that the recipe is a keeper : )
UPDATE (7/5/07): I add 1/4 cup more sugar and substitute applesauce for the oil. And for the frosting I use Cream Cheese Frosting II on this site. I have been asked to make this cake at least five times in the last 3 months : )

This the best Carrot Cake!!! All the above said it all. I used my buttermilk powder. I use a lot of buttermilk and find I never run out if I keep my ready to use powder on hand. Thanks for the recipe. Sam will be remembered by all.

I have never made a carrot cake before completely from scratch and was worried about finding one that stayed moist.  This cake was unbelievable!   I was so pleased with the results.  My new father-in-law gave me an A on this one!   I know I will definitely be requested to make this one again.  I did use a 9 x 13 pan and cook it about 45 minutes instead of an 8 x 12.

I love carrot cake with 'the works' and this one is fantastic.  Even with replacing all of the oil with applesauce and yogurt, the cake was super-moist.  Omitted the nuts (I used pecans) from the batter, but sprinkled them on top of the cream cheese frosting... deeelicious.  Thanks!

Can you say YUM!!  To die for cake and well worth the time to make and deserves more than 5 stars. I made this for Easter and made it the day before and as it was cooking I knew it was going to be fantastic.  My teen son begged me to cut a piece that night and told me nobody will notice a piece missing..but I knew if we cut it it would be gone before Easter and after tasting it, I know it now!  I used the whipped cream cheese frosting from this site and it was so perfect, not too sweet which I don't like but just sweet enough, I'll use that frosting forever too.  I can't say enough about this cake, it was moist and delicious.  Thanks gramps Sam!!

WOW!!  I have used my old carrot cake recipe for 30 years, but after making Sam's famous carrot cake recipe, I have thrown my recipe away and replaced it with Sam's.  It is fabulous!  It is very moist and delicious....so many people asked me for the recipe.  It doesn't NEED an icing, but I did add a cream cheese icing to it. I will certainly make this recipe again.

OMG this is the best carrot cake I've ever had.  I like a little more spice so would probably add a pinch of nutmeg.So moist and delicious. It is exceptional and really easy to put together.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharring your wonderful recipe.

I've been making this recipe for years and have gotten rave reviews. I noticed alot of people do not add raisins because they don't like them. I use golden raisins. They're milder and give it a great taste. I also add 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and allspice.

This was the first time I made a carrot cake and it turned out awesome!  I thought the raisins and pineapple might have made it too sweet but it was just perfect.  I served it to my bible study group and took the rest to work the next day.  Everyone raved about how great it was.  I'll be making this one often.

Pure carrot cake bliss!!! I do mine as a layer cake (2 round tins), and use a creamcheese buttercream frosting (by Rosie Cake Diva - Google her!) that holds its shape better than a drippy creamcheese icing. 
I make the cakes the night before, cool them, wrap them in airtight wrap and keep in the fridge.  The next day the moisture is evenly distrubuted and it's nice and cold for the frosting to go on.

This turned out really great! This was my first time making carrot cake. I read some of the suggestions and here is what i changed: I did not use all white sugar. Wanting to make this a bit healthier i used Truvia (organic sugar substitute) and half dark brown sugar. I also preheated the oven to more than 350 ( i think i set it to 400). I also did not use all white flour but used half whole wheat. Instead of raisins I used cranberries and this added a great kick to the flavor of the cake. Even with these changes the cake was amazing. It cooked in about 45 minutes and came out fluffy. I used the Cream Cheese II frosting on this website. Was great.

Made as written but omitted the raisins. (Fam doesn't like them). My issue is that my cake was done at 40 minutes. 
I used a 9x13 pan. Initially, the cake was dry but after refrigerating overnight I did become moist. 
Flavor is good.

So good 
So moist 
So flavorful :D
It's a bit sweet from all the raisins and pineapples so I decreases the amount of sugar by 1/4 cup 
Perfect

I call this my "Kitchen Sink Carrot Cake" because it has everything but the kitchen sink in it!  I have made it several times along with a simple vanilla buttercream icing and have had rave reviews each time.  My family tradition is to make a bunny cake at Easter each year and this one was certainly a hit.  Sometimes if I want to add an extra layer of richness I'll throw in some chocolate chips, but it really is delicious just as is.  I plan to make this for my daughter's first birthday to go along with the Peter Rabbit theme.  If you like carrot cake, you will love this one! :)

Carrot cake is my favorite cake. This cake is by far the best. I use 2 packages of cream cheese, 2 cups of powder sugar, 3/4 cup of butter, half a tablespoon of vanilla extract and half a tablespoon of almond extract for the cream cheese frosting

I have baked this at least a couple of times. Frosted, unfrosted, round cake, square cake, 9 X 13 cake, cupcake. We have eaten it freshly baked, and frozen some and ate them after a couple of weeks. It was always delicious!

I followed this recipe with only a few minor changes: I didn't have the pan it called for, only a 13x9 which I followed the advice of other reviewers and baked the cake for 45 minutes. I also subbed the oil for 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 cup oil. I couldn't find crushed pineapple so I blended some pineapple tidbits until it looked like crushed pineapple. I omitted raisins because I didn't like them. I am rating this five stars because it was the first cake I baked from scratch and it was the best carrot cake I ever tasted in my life. I made it for Valentine's Day and my boyfriend loved it! I will definitely keep this recipe forever. It was moist and delicious. Made with Cream Cheese Frosting II!

The only change we made was omitting the raisins. This is the PERFECT carrot cake recipe. Topped with a honey cream cheese frosting and I totally did not feel any guilt serving it to my family. Husband said it was in his top 3 items I have ever made him!

This by far the best carrot cake I have ever made.  While I agree there is a lot going on, and maybe too much for a carrot, it doesn't distract from the fact that this is one amazing cake.  I usually make it for group functions and it always goes down a treat.

Thanks so much for the family jewel that is this cake.  Ok so I made this cake first the way it is AWESOME...... Then I put it inside a cheese cake.  I was looking for something new and if carrot cake was healthy mine isn't now.  My brother loved it so much I made 3 for his birthday. With and without the Cheese Cake.

I first made this recipe about 6 months ago, and enjoyed it very much. It had a coarse, tender crumb and a wonderful cinnamon-and-carrot aroma that couldn't be beat.(The crust also turned a deep golden brown when baked, which made it quite attractive.) However, the pineapple flavor was a little too much for my taste, and overwhelmed the beautiful flavor of the carrot and spices that distinguishes a carrot cake. This time when I made it,I substituted applesauce for the canned pineapple and, as others suggested, used some nutmeg and cloves along with the cinnamon called for in the recipe. Finally, I used sultanas in place of the raisins (I like the milder, sweet flavor) and added an extra 1/4 tsp of salt to bring out all the flavors.

I made this cake for our Easter dinner. I was a little disappointed after reading all of the reviews. This may be a good starting point for a great carrot cake recipe, but it's not quite there yet. It was over-the-top way too sweet (and I LOVE sweets), and the carrot flavor got lost in translation. After some of the following tweaks it may be pretty darned awesome: decrease sugar by about 25%, increase carrots & pineapple.

My first carrot cake from scratch. Wow what a cake! Came out perfect. The only change I did was add a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg and allspice. Everything else was exact. I also used the cream cheese frosting II on this site. I tested the cake at 55 minutes and the toothpick came out clean so I didnt need quite the full hour. I will be making this again!

This is a fantastic recipe! I used this recipe with a 9x13 inch pan and came out perfectly fine. I did add 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg after reading other reviews. I cut the sugar down to only 1 cup instead of 1 1/2 and took out the coconut and raisin for personal preferences. As for the carrots, 3 medium sized ones should be enough. Topped with Cream Cheese Frosting II, this cake is a definite show stopper!

This is not a simple carrot cake recipe, it's dense and moist and full of different favors. The color is a beautiful orange too. Fantastic with or without cream cheese icing. Made muffins, and I felt like the flaked coconut taste was a little strong. Maybe when baked longer in a cake the flavor will not be as intense. Definitely will make again, it's a fantastic recipe.

This recipe was so easy to follow. Instead of making a cake, I was able to make about 24 cupcakes from this batch. I left out the coconut and just added extra carrots...most of my family are not into coconut. I will try it next time. Otherwise, a great recipe.

Definitely 5 stars!  I did use a 13 by 9 inch stoneware pan instead...ONLY NEEDED 45 MINUTES, not an hour, so just monitor it for your oven / pan as needed.  Other than leaving out the raisins, I followed the recipe exactly.  Wonderfully balanced flavor and consistency!  Tastes delicious the next day, too! Thanks for sharing this, and I hope people enjoy this as much as my family did!

Made this, based on all of the 5 star reviews. While it was cooking, I read over some of the least favorable reviews, which then had me worried! I made these into cupcakes. I sprayed the tin with baker's joy, and filled each almost full. I made 24 cupcakes and had enough batter left over for 3 or 4 more. I didn't have any buttermilk, so I added 3/4 tsp lemon juice. I tasted these right out of the oven since I was so worried about them, and they were wonderful! I don't even like carrot cake, I was making these for a relative. I baked them at 400 for 10 minutes, then reduced heat to 350 and cooked for 20-25 min more (until top springs back and toothpick comes out clean). Mine were NOT too heavy, and definitely not wet. I did buy a package of grated carrots, and then I chopped them up with my hand chopper. I didn't want that big of pieces of carrot in it. They all cooked up fine and weren't crunchy at all. Only thing I would change next time is to add a little more spice. Maybe a 1/2 tsp ginger and a 1/2 tsp nutmeg.

This is an excelllent Carrot Cake. Very moist, great flavor. I watched the video before making. I was surprised they mixed everything by hand. I have always used an electric mixer. I did end up mixing it by hand, it was a success!!! Will definitely be making this cake again!!!!!!

Just took a bite...oh my gosh! Moist and so flavorful-and I didn't make the frosting yet! I did use pecans since that was all I had-and it was great! I ended up using store bought "shredded carrots" and then pulsed them to wee little bits in the food processor-this worked out great! Omitted the raisins, but the sweetness is still there so no worries. Decided to add some freshly  grated nutmeg as well. thx for my new "go-to Carrot Cake recipe"! We have finished the first cake.."need" to make another now. I used the cream cheese frosting recipe that another reviewer suggested which has a bit of almond extract in it. Absolutely no need to try another recipe once you have tried this one. I think the phenomenal texture could be because I pulsed the pineapple and as mentioned above, the carrots. No child will ever know there are vegetables hiding...

YUMMY! Made "carrot cake III" before and didn't like it, so even though this recipe had pineapple (which I don't like) I took a chance and made it, it's a great carrot cake, perfect moisture, not to sweet, not to spicy, I just ommited the raisins and didn't added anything else instead. Everyone loved it :)

Came out rich, luscious and delicious even though I used just 1/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. Reduced the sugar to 1 cup. Try it... you won't regret making it this way.

This is a delicious homemade carrot cake that tastes fresh.  I omitted some things due to preference but just replaced it with equal amounts of others (1 cup carrot for 1 cup coconut--due to allergies).  It was moist, soft, and not too sweet.  Which is good, since that gives me more wiggle room with the icing ;)  

I made cupcakes, filled the cups 3/4 full, and cooked them 23-25 minutes at the same temp as the recipe, which prevented them from caving in the middle.

[6/4/12] Didn't like the coconut in the carrot cake.  Cake was extremely moist.  Used 2 round pans for 45min. co-workers seemed to like it.  Sweet enough as is.  Don't think it needs cream cheese frosting

Loved this recipe.  Made it tonight and it is gorgeous!  I did have to make a few substitutions though based on what I had in the cuboard.  Substituted the buttermilk for non fat Greek yogurt and used 1/2 apple sauce and 1/2 oil.  Also added the zest of 1 lemon.  I did not have the canned pineapple but added 6 oz of orange juice.  I under cooked it though, should have kept it in for the full 1 hour, As recommended; panicked as it was getting dark on top!  Despite all of this, this recipe is a keeper!  Will make it to the letter next time for perfection.

Excellent recipe.  Very moist yet fluffy. as with all baked goods, watch the baking time dependent on your oven.  Mine took a little less than recommended.
I followed the recipe pretty exact but used Golden raisins (soaked in juice first) and pecan bits instead of walnuts.  It was delicious.  I made cupcakes and topped with a dollop of Cream Cheese II frosting.

What a great carrot cake! So good and not greasy at all like some of them. I made this with cream cheese frosting which I coloured green as a "soccer cake" had been requested and it made a wonderful birthday cake for our large extended family. Between the cake and the icing it packed enough punch that more than the single layer was not necessary. This cake would work equally well without icing, as a take-along cake for school lunches, snacks, etc.

This is absolutely delicious!   Didn't change a thing except that I made 6 cupcakes and baked the remaining in a bundt pan.  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site, sliced the bundt in half - frosting the middle, replaced the top, applied a thin layer of drizzled frosting to top and sprinkled toasted coconut and chopped walnuts.  Served this after Easter dinner and everyone complimented how wonderfully moist and yummy it was.  This will become our traditional Easter dessert.  Thanks for another keeper!

Superb! I would give this recipe 7 stars if I could. I've made this cake several times, and I don't change a thing (except bakeware). I usually make 2 8" rounds (reducing baking time of course) and layer Cream Cheese II frosting (from this site) between the layers and around the cake. Super moist and delicious. Easily the best cake I have ever made! Thank you, Brian, for sharing Sam's wonderful recipe with us!!!

I made this cake sugar-free because my boyfriend and I are diabetic.  I instead of 2 teaspoons of baking soda I added 4 1/2.  Instead of sugar I added Splenda.  I also added 3/4 C of powdered milk with the dry ingredients.  I soaked the raisins and shredded coconut in the pineapple with juice while I prepared the other ingredients after putting the mixture into the microwave for 2 minutes.  Because the raisins and coconut absorbed the pineapple juice I added 1 C of buttermilk instead of 3/4.  This had nothing to do with making the recipe sugar-free but because I find raisins and coconut to be a little dry sometimes.  The cake baked in only 40 minutes because of the added baking soda.  It came out beautifully rising just like a normal sugar-made cake.  I don't know how good the sugar version of this cake is because I can't eat sugar but it works out very well sugar-free.

Used this recipe for Easter cupcakes - bread was moist & stayed moist after refrigerating a few. Definitely a keeper. 

FYI: used dark, non-stick, metal cupcake pans, baked at 325 degrees for 20 minutes. For icing, I mixed 1 stick salted butter with 4oz of cream cheese until creamy. Initially added some of the reserved pineapple juice but didn't notice a difference in flavor, so I added a splash of Almond Extract. Used 3 cups of confectioners (x10) sugar. This was enough to frost 24 cupcakes. 

This recipe is a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

Look at all of these 5 start ratings, Brian - there's no better tribute to Grandpa Sam! Your search for the best carrot cake stops here - absolutely amazing. I followed the directions/ingredients exactly as written, but I baked mine in 2 - 9in rounds for 40 min. I also used the golden raisins because I like them better than regular raisins. Rich, dense, and beyond moist. The best I have ever had - and *I* made it! Cream Cheese II is my go-to frosting for EVERY cake I bake, and it completes this cake with perfection. I'd give this more stars if I could - it's THAT good. Thanks for sharing with us, Brian! :))

I made this cake for Easter & everyone loved it.  The only thing I did differently was use a 9x13" pan & bake it for 45 minutes.  DELICIOUS!  You don't even have to frost it.  A nice dallop of whipped topping would be fine.  I did put a thin layer of cream cheese frosting on it though to please my husband.  Thank you for sharing your grandfather's recipe with us.

I made the cream cheese frosting II to put on this and halved the recipe as some others have done.  I liked that frosting because it had less sugar in it but I did increase the vanilla to 1 1/2 teaspoons to balance out the cream cheese tang. Cutting that recipe in half was just enough for this carrot cake!

This was my first time to make carrot cake so I wanted to try this recipe because of all the rave reviews. it turned out pretty good. I omitted the walnuts and raisins. I made them into cupcakes and it made 26 and they only needed to cook for 20 mins. The problem was because it is such a moist cake, a lot of it got stuck the paper cups. I think I am going to try a couple more recipes though to find that true southern carrot cake I remember as a kid.

I have made this recipe into cupcakes many times and they never fail to be amazing.  I don't usually even like carrot cake but I will eat these like they are going out of style.  I added a dash of nutmeg to mine as well but thats the only change made.

was really excited about this one. BUT...was disappointed.   pineapple made it too moist and it almost seemed undercooked (possibly was) and taste-wise I detected the baking soda which ruined it for me :-(   i would pass on this one.

This was great! Only change I made was to omit the nuts (don't like them). Otherwise, what a fantastic cake. The first time I have ever made carrot cake, which has always seemed so intimidating. Now I plan to use this recipe all the time -- thanks for posting it!

This was pretty good. I prefer Carrot Cake three, though. I took this to work, where I take desserts almost every other day, and it was one of the few that wasn't totally gobbled up. Some people really did love it, though. Others said nothing, which is rare.

I made this sans raisins and nuts and my husband, who doesn't like carrot cake stated that this was the best carrot cake he had ever tasted.  It was extremely moist and my veggie hating kid even ate it! yay!  I did frost it with a cream cheese frosting but next time I will make this in loaf pans as bread with just a sprinkle of turbinado sugar on top!  A great carrot cake!

My brother-in-law wanted me to find him the best carrot cake out there.  I thought I had it with a carrot cake with chinese 5 spice.  But we tried this as an alternative and WOW.  Not only is it a good carrot cake, it's a good cake for those of us who are not rabid carrot cake fans.  

I, of course, changed it a little.  I'm afraid I always do that.  I changed the white sugar for 1 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I left out the coconut as we're not great coconut fans. And I used diced dates instead of raisins (like them better).  I also added a little lemon zest as someone else did.  Then I added lemon zest, lemon juice, and a little almond extract to the cream cheese icing--absolutely wonderful.  Thanks for sharing Sam's cake!

This is the first carrot cake I have ever attempted to make from scratch.  Easy to follow directions...I followed recipe as written.  The cake was moist and full of all the carrot cake flavor...I will forever compare every carrot cake I eat to this one.

This was my first time making carrot cake, I made for my husbands birthday.  I made according to recipe with 3 small changes.  I substituted half whole wheat half all purpose flour.  Half apple sauce half oil.  I didn't realize I was low on sugar so had to use 1/4 cup brown sugar, the rest white sugar.  Mine was done after 45 mins, so keep an eye on it.  I like this cake, but the carrots seemed to long.  Next time I make I'll put in food processor for a second.  Also seemed a little to chunky.  I'll prob try 3/4 cup of raisins, coconut, and walnuts next time.  Seems like it could use a little more spice.  Overall a very tasty and moiste cake.  Thanks for sharing grandpa Sams recipe.

Spectacular!! This cake is amazing. I followed the recipe exactly. However, used 2, 9 inch round pans and used cooking spray to prepare. Reduced cooking time by 15 minutes as suggested in the reviews. This recipe is a keeper! Thank you to Sam's legacy :-)

My 23 y.o. son wanted carrot cake for his birthday so I decided to try this recipe.  I will make this again and again! So moist and delicious and somewhat easy to make.  I did make one change -- substituted 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil instead of 3/4 cup oil -- and it worked out great!  Also cooking time for my cake was about 55 minutes not 60,  Just make sure to keep an eye on it and test for doneness with a toothpick.

These were absolutely delicious! I omitted the raisins as my family doesn't care for them and substituted chopped pecans for walnuts.  This gives it a little sweeter taste. And don't be afraid of the pinepple (I didn't add too much juice, just 8oz of crushed pineapple) - but it really gives it a nice flavor!!  Everything else I kept the same and made into cupcakes - took about 50 minutes to bake at 350.  This recipe made two pans of cupcakes.  Next time I will definitely make more because they were gone in no time.  Thanks Brian for sharing your grandfather's' recipe.  I will definitely make this again!!

I followed this recipe, and the cake was dry and had way too much "stuff" in it! It tasted more like a fruit cake then carrot cake! Not sure how it received such rave reviews! Not spiced enough, not moist enough, and too chunky! More like a muffin than cake! Yuck!

This recipe was labor intensive and required a lot of ingredients, but it was well worth it! I followed the recipe exactly (minus the pineapple because I forgot. Oops!) and it was great. I divided the batter into two 9" round pans, baked them for about 45 mins, and ended up making a layer cake with cream cheese frosting.

Amazing recipe!

I used one shredded apple instead of the pineapple, since I didn't have it. Perfect! Will keep doing that. (I think apples go better with carrots than pineapple, anyways)

Awesome carrot cake even after adding an additional cup of coconut by mistake.  Would definitely recommend.  I used this recipe for Thanksgiving.  I made mini bundt carrot cakes. Yummo!

We love it, instead of putting icing on it we put a little bit of homemade strawberry jam. I left out the raisins, we don't like them. I cooked it in a bundt cake pan. Added 20 minutes to the cooking time also. Looks great and taste the awesome.

This is the perfect carrot cake recipe! I actually made cupcakes and I only baked them for 22-25 minutes. I replaced walnuts with pecans, didn't add raisins and made a simple cream cheese frosting (not too sweet) to top them!

The texture and flavors of this cake are amazing. It was moist and delicious. I would have preferred it to be a little spicier...next time I may add some more cinnamon or maybe some nutmeg. Other than that it was perfect!!!

Made this for a meeting at work and everyone raved about it over and over. For sure a keeper. Liked this recipe alot due to it having the pineapple, raisins and nuts as a traditional carrot cake has.

I make this cake for family and coworkers who say it's the best they've ever had. For the United Way raffle at work this earned over $70! I soak the raisins in the pineapple while preparing the rest. Also I add toasted walnuts and coconut on the outside

I followed this recipe almost exactly, except that I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. This was the best carrot cake I have ever had. People that don't usually like carrot cake, liked this cake.

I liked this cake, it wasn't very sweet, I used a basic cream cheese frosting...
I did manage to try and make it healthier...I used 1/2c palm sugar, 1/2c demerara sugar, 1/2c organic sugar and replaced vegetable oil with coconut oil  then 1 cup whole wheat white flour and 1 cup cake flour...I should have just done all whole wheat flour since it is a heavy cake anyway and spiced up with Cinnamon.  I didn't add the raisins since we don't care for them  in cakes and used pecans instead of walnuts.  I probably used 2.5 c of carrots too that were shredded on the thicker grate.
I also made the cake the day before so everything had time to meld together.

Delicious carrot cake.  For me, this cake comes out very dense -- I would prefer something fluffier and lighter.  Could it be the high altitude where I live?  My family raves on and on about this cake, though, so this is now my go-to recipe.  Stayed true to the recipe, except I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and a little nutmeg.

AWESOME cake.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this in 2 round cake pans and baked for about 40 minutes.  I frosted with Cream Chese Frosting II (submitted by Janni) and topped both layers with toasted coconut.

This recipe is a definite keeper.

Thanks again!

Try this for a healthier and tastier twist ...
Replace 1.25 cup orange juice for buttermilk, Whole meal flour for all purpose flour, light brown sugar for white sugar, add 1 teasp baking powder in addition to baking soda mentioned, half applesauce for half the oil in recipe, can add nutmeg and clove powder if desired. Toast the walnuts before adding to mix. Might take a few minutes longer due to wholemeal flour so keep an eye.  Enjoy!

I have been looking for a great carrot cake recipe and let me tell you this is it!  I used two round pans and took the advice from another review and only baked it for 45 minutes and it came out perfect.  I didn't use the coconut and it still is delicious!

Made this for a co-worker's birthday because carrot cake is one of her favorites. It was a hit! Ran out of vegetable oil, added some olive oil to make up the difference. Also, baked it in a 9x13 pan for 45 minutes. Other than that, stuck to the recipe as written. It's a keeper!
Frosted with cream cheese frosting (8 oz. cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 1 tsp. vanilla, and 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar -- recipe from Alton Brown).

This is astoundingly good! I followed one reviewer's advice and boiled the rasins for 2 mins in OJ and drained/cooled before adding. Tasted one: WOW! I omitted the coconut-not a fan. If all carrot cakes were like this, it would've been a favourite long before now. Bravo, Sam!! Thanks so much Brian!!

This cake is great. I didn't make any changes other than no walnuts, and it was so yummy! My husband requested carrot cake for his birthday cake. This one seemed to get the best reviews so I tried it. So glad I did! Will definitely be making this one again.

This is such an amazing recipe I have to review it again. Made just as described except I used applesauce, not oil. And I baked it in two nine inch pans for 45 minutes. Love this recipe, thank you.

I'm not generally a carrot cake fan, but this was wonderful! Very moist and flavorful. The only change that I made was to bake it in 2 round 9" pans to make it into a layer cake.

Best. Carrot Cake. Ever. I made this exactly as written except for the coconut (didnt have any) and it was fantastic!  So moist and flavorful. My husband loved it. I made it in two 9-inch round pans and baked them for about 50 minutes. I also used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe on this site and it was the perfect pairing. I cant imagine trying to ever improve on this recipe--it is perfect!  Totally a keeper!

The best carrot cake ever!!!  I added extra cinnamon and replaced 1/2 of the oil with apple sauce. I made cupcakes out of the batter, it made a couple more than 2 dozen.  I frosted it with the "pinapple cream cheese frosting"  from this site.  They were a huge hit at our Easter dinner last night.  I will  be making these again soon.  Thanks for sharing your grandpa's recipe!

Made this cake for our Easter dinner, omitting the raisins to personal preferences.  It was a super-duper carrot cake.  Everyone loved it.  Fantastic flavor and super moist.  Thanks for sharing!

All 12 guest loved this cake with whipped cream cheese frosting from this site.  It was moist, delicious and not overly sweet.  I forgot the pineapple and it still came out great. New fav for fam.

Delicious.  I accidently doubled the pineapple and it made it taste like bread pudding!  Still tastey, but next time I will try it with the proper amount of ingredients.  Great with the cream cheese frosting II on this site

OH MY!!! This was FREAKING DELICIOUS! WOW! I also made just a FEW changes... I did 1 cup white sugar 1/2 brown sugar, added 1/4 teaspoon almond extract, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and omitted the coconut and raisins. Holy cow this turned out FABULOUS! The best carrot cake I have ever had!

I made this for husband's birthday on Friday. I used another reviewer's advice: doubling on the vanilla  and the cinnamon, and added some clove. Also used dried cranberries, with the raisins and a dash of ginger. I used half sugar half subsitute as well. I did not have pineapple on hand, nor do I keep veg. oil in the house, so I used coconut oil instead. Hubby said it was the best he's ever tasted. This will be the recipe I will be using when carrot cake is requested.

YUM! I used this batter to make mini carrot cake cupcakes, and they were DELICIOUS! Everyone LOVED them! The batter made ABOUT 70 mini cupcakes (not sure I remember the exact amount).  They were very moist and yummy! 
I baked them for about 15 minutes.

Absolutely delicious! I've made this twice for birthday parties, and it disappears in record time!  So moist, and full of flavor.  I soaked my raisins in pineapple juice before using them, and left out the coconut and nuts (didn't have any).   I frosted it with cream cheese frosting, and added crushed pineapple to the middle layer of frosting. YUM!

this was the most delicious carrot cake i have ever tasted, maybe even the most delicious cake.

i like extra cinnamon so i added an extra 1/2 tsp of it to the recipe.  i also put the crushed pineapples with juice in the food processor to make the pieces smaller and i did the same with the cup of raisins (because i don't like the texture of a whole raisin in my food). i cooked in 2 9.5" pans for about 30 minutes and let cool overnight before frosting with a white chocolate cream cheese frosting.

the only thing i would do different next time is to pack the cups with the shredded carrots instead of just filling the measuring cups loosely.

this is definitely going in my recipe book

I used almonds instead of walnuts as we have a walnut allergy in the family.  I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so I followed another reviewer's suggestion of mixing milk and lemon juice.  I made a basic cream cheese frosting, adding a little lemon juice to cut the sweetness.    Everyone RAVED about this cake.  Now, I didn't have any the first night, but brought the leftovers home and stuck them in the fridge.  This is what I SHOULD have done before I served it.  Two days in the fridge and this cake turned into a masterpiece!  I didn't think it was possible to improve on perfection, but it happened!  This recipe deserves more than 5 stars!

Amazing. I left out the raisins and cooked it in two round cake pans. I reduced the time by 15 min as someone else suggested and it was great. I made a basic cream cheese frosting but added 1/2 of the juice of a lemon to it, and it was wonderful!

One word.  Delicious.  It is so moist you won't believe it.  I made this exactly as written except replaced the walnuts with pecans because that's what I had on hand.    I used the Cream Cheese II frosting from this website.  I took it to an office Christmas party and amongst the desserts there, this didn't particularly stand out by sight when compared to the chocolate raspberry torte that someone else brought, but that just means there's more left over for me!!  Love it!  Thanks to Sam!

Delicious! I took a hint from a friend of mine and packed the carrots into the measuring cup as tight as possible. More carrots=more moisture.

My best friend and I have a tradition of baking cakes together, and we usually don't make the same cake twice.  This one has been done three times so far, and will no doubt be made many more.  It has become a favorite of our friends and families!  We usually substitute applesauce for the vegetable oil, and frost it with a whipped cream cream cheese frosting.  One time we even forgot to add the sugar until after 10 minutes of baking, and it still turned out fine!  Best carrot cake I've ever had; thanks for sharing the recipe!

Just too much going on. Ok, but not the traditional carrot cake I was looking for. Won't make again. The husband couldn't keep his hands off it though. He loved it and gave it 5 stars go figure.

This was my first attempt at making carrot cake. Imagine my surprise when the first person to take a bite said it was the best he had ever had in his life! (He's 54-years-old and not prone to exaggerating!) Everyone told me repeatedly how good it was, and I've had several requests to make it again soon. Thank you, Sam and Brian!

Being in a hurry last night, I hurried and grated the 2 cups of carrots then started mixing everything in the order listed on the ingredients list, it was after I got down to the last two items I realized that there was a certain order to mix things up and to add......  OOPS!  But you know what - it turned out perfect anyway!  I baked it up in a 9x13 and frosted it with Cream Cheese Frosting II submitted by Janni.  I found a picture of an old fashion carrot seed package printed it out folded it so that only the picture showed taped it to a plastic knife and stuck it in a piece so that it looks like a seed pkg.  I've received several good comments on the cake as well as the decoration!

Love Love Love this cake!  It is a wonderful treasure of a recipe.  I will use this over and over.  It is easy and so very delicious.  I used the recipe from Janni called Cream Cheese Frosting II on top and this cake was the hit of the gathering.  I will never ever make another carrot cake again, especially the box mix kind!

Absolutely delicious!  This was my first attempt at making a carrot cake and it came out perfect.  I left out the coconut and nuts, as a personal preference, and put them on the frosting instead.  I also baked it in two 9 inch round pans and made it a layer cake.  This cake was super fast (especially using a food processor to shred the carrots) and easy.  Thanks for the awesome recipe that is sure to make quite a few appearances in my house!

I changed up a few things in the recipe. Instead of using 3/4 cup of vegetable oil I used 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil and 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce. Instead of 1 1/2 cups of white sugar I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar. Instead of 2 cups of all-purpose flour I used 1 cup of all-purpose flour and 1 cup of whole wheat flour. I also used fat free buttermilk, 3 cups of shredded carrots, 3/4 cup of coconut (I toasted the coconut beforehand), 1 cup of chopped pecans and I omitted the raisins.   When I prepared the cake I first took the eggs and separated the egg whites from the egg yolks and beat the egg whites until they formed stiff peaks. I then beat the egg yolks, oil, applesauce, white sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract together. After I sifted the flour mixture together I alternated in mixing in the flour mixture and the buttermilk into the egg mixture. Once that was done I added in the carrots, pineapple, coconut, and pecans and stirred that all together until everything was mixed well. I then folded in the egg whites into the cake batter. The cake turned out very well. It was moist, creamy and had just a little bit of spice. I prepared a cream cheese frosting and put it on the cake but honestly this cake would be magnificently even by itself. From my calculations, 15 servings of this cake with these alterations would be about 285 calories each rather then 323. I definitely recommend that you try this out!

I've made more carrot cakes than you can shake a stick at and this one is wonderful!  I baked it in a 9X13 and served it with good ol cream cheese frosting.  It was fast, easy, moist and delicious.  I chose it over the others because I happened to have buttermilk on hand, it called for less fat and calories and included all the other goodies; healthy, yummy fruit and nuts.      I cut the fat even more by substituting applesauce for a third of it and reduced the sugar by substituting half of it with Organic Zero, a delicious organic granulated sugar that has zero chemicals, zero calories, zero glycemic index and no bitter after taste. HINT: Look for it at The Vitamin Shoppe or in small packets at the grocery store for your coffee. It's the best thing since sliced bread!  Sugar with no calories!  Yeah!  This is now on my favorites list. Thank you Sam!

I have made this cake twice now, once in a 13x9 and also a 8" 2 layer. It is sooo good, everyone loved the balance of ingredients, I highly recommend making it as the recipe calls for. I made a simple cream cheese frosting to top it, YUM!! I did have to cook it for less time though, may be my oven but 45 min. was enough.

Fantastic.  The pineapple is the secret ingredient that works wonders.  This stayed as moist a week later as it was the day I made it.  Husband was in awe!

Very good, everyone liked it. I omitted the coconut & nuts. Next time I will add the pineapple but not the juice, the cake was just a little too moist. I used my cuisinart to shred the carrots, there was more to wash in the end but much easier than shredding by hand.

I'm not a carrot cake lover but everytime I make this people go crazy for it! I have a few changes......I toast the coconut and walnuts first. Add the zest of 1 lemon ( have tried orange zest but get a bigger reaction to lemon ). 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg and I split the sugar..... 1 cup brown and 1/2 cup white. I like making mini cupcakes, this recipe makes alot perfect for potluck or meeting. Mini cupcake bake for 13 to 14 minutes.

Except for omitting the raisins and coconut (just preference), I followed the recipe exactly and got rave reviews.  My brother in law actually didn't believe I made it : )  Iced it with 16 oz cream cheese, 1/2 c butter, 3 c icing sugar and 1 tsp vanilla.  Fantastic.

I made this cake for an old-fashioned cake walk last weekend.  Luckily the winner cut it up and shared it -- it was delicious!!!  Like other reviewers, I used AllRecipe's Cream Cheese Frosting II.  I did a two-layer cake, and cut the baking time down by 15 minutes.  Since it had to sit for quite awhile at the event, I decided to cover the whole thing in chopped up pecans and walnuts I had leftover from other dishes.  This is going to become "my" famous cake.  Thanks for this recipe!

Made this for my father-in-law's birthday party - tons of family and EVERYONE was raving. The cream cheese icing II from this site works perfectly on top (but don't add all the sugar.. try it with half to see if you like it just like that).

This is an absolutely excellent carrot cake recipe. the recipe yielded just over 24 cupcakes for me.  I decided to forego the raisins, and I took a cue from other reviewers and added some lemon zest. I also added 1 tsp of pure almond extract, and that seemed to bring all of the other flavors out.  I topped it with a rendition of the cream cheese frosting II recipe featuring more lemon zest, and just a pinch of yellow food coloring :) All in all a very flavorful and moist cake that is forgiving, should you leave it in the oven just a bit too long.

Just wonderful!  Served it to 6 at a dinner party, and everyone loved it; I could tell it was true because it was so quiet with everyone just plowing through it!  I poured it into two 9" pans like another had, but it took nearly 45 minutes to cook through.  Next time I'll try using dried currants instead of raisins because their size would lend itself to this.

Delicious! I changed a few minor things: less oil (about 1/2 cup) and a bit more buttermilk (1 cup). Half white caster sugar and half brown caster sugar, 2 1/2 cup of carrots instead of 2, some more baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon of allspice and 1/4 teaspoon of crushed cloves. I had to bake it about 20 minutes longer than in the original recipe, but it turned out great! Nice and moist, but not tóo dense. Definitely something I will make more often. I can really recommend to use a food processor, otherwise it becomes very time consuming.

That Sam! That Sam! That Sam, I am... so happy with this cake. It was as delicious as promised. I did prefer currants over raisins (used both, but I ended up picking out the raisins when eating). I am also going to try giving the carrot/pineapple/coconut mixture a whirl in the in the processor to see if it provides a slightly smoother texture. I think I found the recipe to stick with. Thanks, Sam! =)

This recipe is truely awesome!! I did reduce the oil to 1/4 cup only because that was all that I had in the house! (woops!). So to make up for it I increased the carrot to 3 cups (as another did) and added another splash of milk. I made it for my husbands birthday and everyone there was asking for the recipe! This one is a keeper!

I made this for my grandpa's birthday and everyone loved it so much.  My mom wants me to make it for her birthday now.  My changes:  I replaced half the oil with applesauce, left out the coconut and raisons (personal preference), and baked the batter in two circular pans.  Baking time was reduced to 35 minutes, so remember to cook it for less time if you use circular pans to make a two layer cake.  Next time I might try using half whole wheat flour and replace more of the oil with applesauce.  YUMMY!

I have made this on many occasions, and have learned to bring multiple copies of the recipe to each event.  Everyone loves this recipe.  

I have tried many different icing recipes with this and by far have found the Cream Cheese Frosting II compliments this cake better than any other. 

Enjoy!!

This is honestly the best carrot cake I have ever had. A lot of people who rated this recipe made a couple of changes to it but in my opinion its absolutely great exactly as written. With some cream cheese icing it is absolutely to die for. Enjoy.

This has got to be the best carrot cake EVER!  I soaked my resins in hot orange juice before adding them to the batter and baked them in two 9” cake pans for 35 minutes cooled on a rack for 10 minutes then removed them from the pan to cool completely and refrigerated overnight to frost the next day.  It came out so moist; just perfect.  I iced the cake with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site.  YUMM!

THE BEST CARROT CAKE EVER!!!! This is by far the best recipe I have ever used.  I have baked over a dozen different carrot cake recipes and this one tops them ALL.  I don't like nuts or raisins so I left them out and it was AWESOME!!! Used CCream Cheese Frosting II and it was a HIT!!!

Wow!  This cake came out fabulous (see the photo, when published).  I am not well-known for my baking abilities, but man this cake must be fool-proof!  I soaked the raisins in 1 c. hot water + 2 Tbsp. fresh-squeezed orange juice; omitted the nuts; and I used 3-9" cake pans for a wonderfully tall layered cake. I was worried about the cake splitting when removing from pans, but these even withstood me handling them!  I used orange food coloring in the cream cheese frosting between the layers and green food coloring for the shredded cocnut on the outside. Can't wait to eat it tomorrow!  I'll update after tasting it--I have no doubts that it'll be delicious. UPDATE: What a hit! I'm glad I printed out this recipe, as I was asked for it by family members. Next time, I might try just two larger layers, or keep the cake refrigerated for a few hours before serving, as it got a little bit messy cutting 3 layers. Of course, it was 80+ degrees on Easter in Escondido.  Kinda like Christmas weather around here :-)

It was as great as I expected or much more!!  I was planning to bake this cake and I just found "How to Decorate an Easter Cake (Video)" on this site before I make it! So I tried to make a Bunny Cake as you can see my posted picture :) I baked with a 10" round pan out of this recipe, and the batter was a perfect amount.  I don't know if it helps but my oven took 85 mins for the cake to be done... Actually I baked this cake at my friend's house and she said her oven was a little bit weak.  When I assembled the bunny, I didn't cut the top off the round cake so my bunny got so fat!  But it was super cute :P I frosted the bunny with "Cream Cheese Frosting II by Janni" as many reviewers reccomended, and made bunny fur with flaked coconut.  In the video, they toasted coconut flakes but I wanted to make my bunny white so I didn't toasted.  Decorating was so fun and of course the cake was a huge hit!!

I have been searching for years for a carrot cake recipe that did not turn out dry and I am so happy to say that my search is now officially over. This is in my opinion by far the best carrot cake that I have ever eaten!! I followed the receipe to the letter and topped it off with the Cream Cheese Frosting II by Janni from this site and talk about heavenly! I can see why Sam was famous for this cake, it is so yummy!! I will be making another one tonight, my first one was gone in no time. Thanks Brian for sharing such a wonderful recipe. Your Grandfather's cake lives on!!

THE BEST!!  I have made this 4 times now and every time I get tones of compliments.  I follow the recipe exactly as is.  It is quite easy to make, but it does get messy due to the multitude of ingredients and clean up is kinda  a pain (you need a minimum of 3 mixing bowls!) but it is worth it every time.  Deeeeeelish!!!  It is moist and last for days when kept in the refrigerator.  If you like carrot cake, you must try this recipe.

This is a GREAT recipe! I did (as always) make a few changes. To get a rustic cake with fewer calories, I:
- replaced the sugar by a sweetener
- used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white flour
- instead of walnuts used ordinary nuts, just put them in a plastic bag and slightly crushed them with a meat "hammer"
- added less oil, but put some waxed paper on the bottom of the pan.

This is a delicious, simple-to-make cake which I served with normal sour cream. Thank you soooo much for the recipe!

I made this cake as is (only change was to put in two 8" cake pans), and it was wonderful!   I frosted with "Cream Cheese Frosting III", which is a less sweet variety, which goes awesome with this cake!

I made it for my sister's "Meet the Bride/Groom" party as a Groom's Cake, and after they got their peice, the cake was "stolen" and passed around the other tables and was gone in a flash!

I would reccomend this recipe to anyone, and of course, had several requests!

It is easy to see why this recipe is famous! I made this for my son's first birthday cake, and I could not be happier that it is the first cake he has ever had! 

I made his cake with no nuts, and made a larger cake for the adult guests using 3 cups of carrots and omiting the raisons. We frosted between layers and the top of the cake using the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe with the juice of one half of an orange added. 

We had a room full of carrot-cake lovers who all gave this recipe 5 stars!

Believe me when I say I am not a good baker.  I can cook food ok but baking is a different story.  I chose this particular recipe because of the high rating.  I must say my family and friends are still raving about this cake.  It's the most delicious carrot cake recipe we've ever eaten.  Thank you Sam!  I followed recipe although did leave out the raisins, as we don't care for them.  I also baked this in a bundt cake pan.  DELISHHHHHH!!!

I used 1/2 cup apple sauce and 1/4 cup oil. Instead of 3/4 cup oil(as another review said). It was a great idea and a great recipe that I will use it over and over again.

I made this cake for Easter; it was my first try at making a carrot cake and everyone absolutely loved it!  Definetley the best I've ever had.  The only thing I did differently was omit the raisins and coconut, added an extra 1/2 cup of carrot and threw in a little nutmeg.  It was awesome!

Best carrot cake I have ever had.  Made it for the first time for my friend's bridal shower and received so many compliments.  I left out the raisins and nuts (personal preference) and used the cream cheese frosting II from this sight.  Frosting is very sweet, could have halved the recipe and still had enough.  Will undoubtably use this recipe over and over again. Thanks

This is an incredible carrot cake: Moist and dense. I thought my cousin hold the secret carrot cake recipe but this is so much better. I cut the baking time to 45 minutes only and took the raisins out, we don't like them much. Thanks again for sharing this great recipe.

I was a little afraid of the attempt, because carrot cake is my boyfriend's fave, and it was his birthday -it had to be perfect!  And perfect it is.  Perfect moistness, chewy, not too sweet... Now he thinks I should make this cake once a month.

This is truely the best ever carrot cake.  Moist, flavoursome, and satisfying.  I wanted to make a special cake for a friend's birthday morning tea at work and this was perfect.  If you like your carrot cakes full of tasty extras like pineapple, walnuts and rasins this is for you.  This was the first cake I've made in years and I got heaps of compliments (and it all got eaten by 11am!).  Make sure you check that it is cooked properly though, I ended up baking mine for an hour twenty, rather than the hour listed in the recipe.

Came out great, took it to work and got good reviews.  Added a bit of nutmeg, clove and allspice (1/4 tsp).  Nice and moist cake.  I also used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site.

Absolutely delectable!  This carrot cake is amazing!  The pineapple, walnuts and coconut give it a distinguished taste.  I took this to the restaurant I work at and everyone loved it!  The manager and the cook both gave me their compliments - they couldn't keep their hands off them!  I give this recipe two thumbs way way up.

As other reviews say, this cake is fabulous.  Moist, tasty, delicious.  I added a bit of allspice and nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon and frosted it with a cream cheese/allspice frosting.  Perfect!

I am so happy!!  If I ever have a last meal it will include a piece of this cake (topped with cream cheese frosting - of course!)  I followed the recipe exactly and enjoyed the results.  Even my children that "hate" coconut and raisins loved this cake.  It's the little things that bring joy.

I absolutely love this carrot cake recipe!!! I've made the cake 4 times, including two of them for this past thanksgiving.  It is such a simple and delicious recipe and perfect for a beginner like myself.  The cake is wonderfully moist and not too sweet and has a wonderful flavor.  The ingredients perfectly blend together and no one ingredient is overpowering.  I leave out the raisins because i'm not a fan of them and no one misses them.  I doubt I'll ever try another carrot cake recipe.  Thanks for a recipe I'll keep for years to come!!!

I made this for my Aunt and Uncle while visiting in KY. My Aunt raved about it and my Uncle throughly enjoyed it. An unexpected guest arrived and this was the perfect dessert to end the lunch. It wasnt greasy at all and easy to prepare.I just bought shreaded carrot instead of going through all of that hassle. Wonderful!

I thought that it was okay but not the best that i have tasted.

This recipe is spectacular as written as judged by myself and the many people for whom I have made it.  No changes are needed.  Whenever I cook with raisins, however, even if I simply add them to oatmeal, I always soak them in water to rehydrate them.  So an optional change for this wonderful recipe is to soak your raisins for a minimum of an hour.  I am thinking of soaking the raisins in brandy next time for a different twist.  Another optional change is to grate the rind of one lemon into the sugar mixture for a hint of citrus flavor in this cake.  

I use this recipe to make a triple layer cake with 8" round pans and bake them at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.  I make cream cheese icing to complement the cake.

In my humble opinion, any bad reviews of this cake were either because the reviewers made mistakes or do not understand what a real carrot cake is.  Sam hit the nail on the head with this recipe, and I am thankful it has been shared with all of us.

The best carrot cake ever. Made it once and now it is requested for every occasion by friends and family. Perhaps too good? I cut back on the pineapple a little and didn't add the walnuts, but it was so moist and delicious anyway. Doesn't even require frosting it is THAT good on its own, but add a nice layer of cream cheese frosting and its the best cake ever.

The best carrot cake I have ever tasted.  Gave this recipe to our daughter in Hawaii to bake for her husband's birthday.
I not only give it five stars, but two thumbs up as well.

This cake was wonderful. I was a little nervous after reading the reviews in which people said the cake didn't turn out despite following the directions exactly, but I followed the recipe as much to the letter as I could. One thing I had to change was that I used pecans instead of walnuts. I used a food processor to chop them really finely (that was kind of an accident). The next thing was that I accidentally dumped all of a 20-oz can of crushed pineapple into the liquid mix before realizing that I should have used 8 oz, so I tried to take out a little more than half of that (a good deal of guesswork there). Finally, I used a 7x12 (or 7x11, I don't remember) glass pan instead of an 8x12 pan, so I also made cupcakes. I put the cake and cupcakes in about the same time. The cupcakes were done after about 30 minutes, the cake after about 50 minutes (total). I then used a cream cheese frosting. Super tasty. I didn't think I liked carrot cake much, but this was really delicious! (And Fiancé, who *does* like carrot cake, also really loved this cake. I made it for his birthday.)

OK, so I signed up on this site just so I could rate this recipe, it is THAT good.  I was looking for a carrot cake recipe that would rival my late mother-in-law's recipe and this one delivered!  I made a nut-free version, because my 17 year old son is allergic.  To compensate for the nuts, I used 3 cups of grated carrots instead of two.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of allspice.  Other than those changes/additions I made it according to the recipe.  I cooked it in a 9x13 glass lasagna pan at 350 degrees F for one hour.  I topped it off with the "Cream Cheese Frosting II" recipe from this site, but I scaled that recipe back by half.  This cake was absolutely divine, beautifully moist and delicious.  Everyone in my family thought it was excellent.  I will most definitely make this again and again.  Thank you Brian and Grandpa Sam for a winning carrot cake recipe!

I checked this out because of the name. You see, I once worked with a lady named Donna who was married to a man named Sam who loved her carrot cake. Seems that early on in their marriage Donna wanted something from Sam & promised him a carrot cake every week if he'd comply. She figured that he would soon tire of eating carrot cake & let her off the hook. 25 years later she was still making him a carrot cake every week! Her recipe was a lot like this one.

Carrot cake is our favorite dessert, and this is one of the best we've ever had. I cut the recipe to 8 servings to make a smaller two layer cake with these changes: subbed 1 tablespoon applesauce for 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, cut sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1 tablespoon and a half of honey, and subbed 2% milk with 1 teaspoon of fresh lemon juice for buttermilk. I baked them in two 8x5 inch pans at 350 for thirty minutes and another fifteen minutes at 300. They turned out perfectly, brown on the edges and moist inside. I used the Creamcheese Frosting II recipe from here, also cut it to 8 servings. This let me put a thin frosting layer between the loaves, and frost the top and sides thoroughly. It came out sweet and delicious, and I could see it didn't need that extra sugar or even a full frosting layer between the loaves. My fiancée, who doesn't have a sweet tooth, had two portions in one night! My only critique is that it's so good, I'll eat it all if we don't give some away! This recipe is a keeper and I will definitely make it again.

Ok this cake was good. And for that I give it this rating. I have to agree with a previous review, however. There does seem to be too much going on in this cake. I was looking forward to that sweet and rich carrot flavor but instead had an overwhelming amount of other flavors. As I said though, the cake WAS good. Just not a great choice for a traditional carrot cake craving.

Fantastic! I must go along with the trend of 5 Stars. I almost decided to try a different recipe after reading a few negative reviews but glad I tried it. Did not have buttermilk on hand use 5 ounce plain Greek yogurt and 5 ounces water, also did not have coconut but great without it. I splint into 3 small aluminum loaf pans and baked for 30 min on 350. I love cinnamon so I may add more the next time TASTE GREAT!

Very good! Didn't change a thing (except to use a scant 1-1/2 cups of sugar instead of an accurate full measure) - turned out perfectly. Not too sweet - moist and flavourful. Topped it with Cream Cheese Frosting II.

Excellent, the only carrot cake recipe I've used for years.  I have recently moved to AZ however and the altitude is around 7,000 feet, any tweeks I need to make would be greatly appreciated. I am using it as a base for a 2 tier cake & don't want it to fall.

I made it exactly as listed and paired it with Cream Cheese Frosting II for my three tier wedding cake. Even people who don't like carrot cake loved it! Carrot cake lovers thought it was one of the best they'd had. Excellent recipe!!!

As a long time carrot cake fan, this is by far the BEST one ever!   The only change I made was omitting the walnuts in the cake, but crushed them up and sprinkled them on top as a garnish.  Made it for my boyfriends birthday because it is his fav cake and he raved about it, and have requests to make for other people's birthdays!

This cake is awesome!!! It's moist, flavorful, and easy to make. I grated half the carrots super fine and the other half on a regular box grater which gave the cake a oranger color. I also used golden raisins because they are "plumper. ". Stirred ingredients together with a wooden spoon. That easy. Turned out perfect! Everyone loved it.  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe. I love it!

Made this last night it is tasty, but not carrot cake. I have a simple recipe for carrot pineapple muffins and it tastes exactly like that but without the trip to the store for the buttermilk i will never use. Also made the whipped cream cheese frosting which is not piping consistancy. Overall my kids think it's yummy, but just not what i thought to taste like true carrot cake.

Yup, it's delicious. Perfect, really. Great for those who want a carrot cake that is moist and delicious but not greasy and not too sweet. Wouldn't change a single thing. I made it in 3 8-inch round pans and cooked it for 22 minutes, mostly because I was in a hurry and wanted it to cook faster. It was perfect and made a beautiful layer cake.

We loved this carrot cake.  I've made many carrot cakes over the years and all have their attributes.  I like the fact that this cake isn't overly sweet, don't get me wrong, I like sweet desserts.  But carrot cakes (topped with cream cheese frosting) can be overly sweet to the point of being sickening...not so with this recipe.  It takes some time to do all of the chopping, peeling and preparation...but it's well worth it.  Topped with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site.

To me this was more of a fruit cake with way too much going on.  I wasted so much on this to turn out like a dense, wet, crunchy, fruit cake was just disappointing.

I was looking for a perfect carrot cake recipe, and came across this one... It seemed pretty simple and straight to the point, so I gave it a try, and I am so glad I did!!! This carrot cake is SO Delicious!!! I followed the recipe as showed, not changing or omitting anything and WOW!!! All I have to say is that, whenever my family or friends have a party or event, they ask me to make this carrot cake... :-)

I have made a few different versions of carrot cake, but this, combined with the cream cheese icing II on this website, is simply to-die-for. I used pecans instead of walnuts and added a pinch of cloves and about about 1/8 tsp. of nutmeg to make is spicier. Otherwise followed the recipe and it is fantastic. This will become my only carrot cake recipe! Thanks so much for sharing this.

A+ !! Made into cupcakes and took to Easter dinner party. Big hit. The pineapple and coconut gave it moisture with just enough sweetness. Toughest part was shredding those carrots! Frosted with cream cheese frosting....mmmmmm

This is a delicious carrot cake recipe.  I substituted 3/4 cup mashed, canned great northern beans ( with some of the bean juice) for the oil and everyone was amazed!!  No one will ever guess and I love the idea of the extra nutrition instead of all the oil!  You can use any color of beans that are similar to the color of the cake.  This substitution will work in lots of other recipes too.  Use black beans for brownies etc.  Helps to have a lot of different flavors going on like in this one.

My changes - I omitted raisins b/c yuk, and used 3/4 cup of coconut b/c that's all I had. 
My husband said this was the best carrot cake he's ever had, and he LOVES carrot cake.  I made this as his birthday cake. I put it in a round 12" pan, and baked for a bit over an hour.
I made a butter cream frosting with a half block (4oz) of cream cheese, seasoned with salt, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg. YUM!
The cake cooked perfectly - ZERO complaints.

I was very excited to try this recipe because it got such rave reviews. I made it according to the recipe, except I omitted the raisins and reduced the oil to 1/2 cup. It came out oily and dense and not very sweet. It was more like carrot bread than cake in my opinion. After re-reading the reviews, it appears most people made significant changes to the recipe and still gave it high marks, which is misleading to say the least. I don't think I'll be making this again. :/

Will not try this again..I put 1/2 cup instead of 1c of coconut, pecans, pineapple raisins and put 3. C of carrots instead of two. Thus balancing out the missing halves of those extras. Irregardless , the cake , like bread pudding , wet inside. Did not have cake texture whatsoever.

I have baked this cake ten times (I found it before it was on allrecipes) and it is the best carrot cake ever. The only thing I do differently is use pure vanilla, but I use pure vanilla in everything I bake. I just wish it had a cream cheese frosting recipe to go with it. I get some many compliments on this recipe, try it, it is great!

This cake is amazing!  I only did 2 things different.  I omit coconut because my family doesn't like it & I substituted applesauce instead of the oil.  We used a cream cheese icing recipe from this site.  I added a teaspoon of heavy whipping cream to lighten that up (density definitely not calories, lol)!

This cake is delicious! Very moist and flavorful. I used 1/2 cup of cinnamon applesauce instead of the oil so it was a little bit healthier. I also grated the carrots in my Ninja food processor. Baked it in 2 round 9" pans and frosted it with my special homemade cream cheese frosting (recipe on my page). It came out as a super yummy carrot cake, possibly one of the best I have ever tasted (and made!) Thanks for sharing the recipe, Brian, and may Grandpa Sam and his famous carrot cake recipe live on!

Made a wonderful rich double-layer round carrot cake. I may forgo the cream cheese frosting next time and make them plain cupcakes--so rich, moist, and sweet all on its own!

I was looking forward trying this recipe according to the rave reviews but am completely disappointed because the cake didn't turn out at all.

This is a great recipe! It was so dense I might even call it a pudding of sorts. For a lighter texture I might use less vegetable oil next time. Will definitely make again.

Hands down, one of the most delicious cakes I've ever made! My kids LOVED it, and it baked up perfectly. The only things I did a bit differently from the recipe were that I was out of walnuts and subbed chopped almonds, used large unsweetened flake coconut, used coconut oil for the veg. oil, and I used unflavored, fresh homemade kefired milk, which I always substitute for buttermilk in recipes. Absolutely amazing :)

This carrot cake was absolutely fantastic!!!  Rave reviews by all!  I did not have the shredded coconut, so I used coconut oil to grease the pans.  I also did not have the buttermilk, so I took the tip from another reviewer and used 3/4 cup regular milk and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice.  That was all the adjustments I had to make and it was only because of a lack of ingredients.  It was the best carrot cake I have ever had!  Thank you for posting this recipe and thanks to all the reviewers for their helpful comments.

This recipe is a family favorite. Only minor adjustment is cooking the raisins in OJ for a few minutes prior to adding to mix.

At first, I thought the batter was too wet but the cake turned out fine.  My husband is the carrot cake expert, and he thought that this cake was good - not really good, but good.  There were a few things I added to the batter - about 2 tbsp. of crystallized ginger and 1 tsp nutmeg.  I also roughly chopped the raisins.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts.  Baked the cake in 2 round pans and took the advise of one reviewer and cut the baking time by 20 minutes.

Overall, I am keeping this recipe and will probably make this again but going to pass the crushed pineapple in the food processor next time.

I made this recipe exactly as is for one single-layer 9x13 cake and also made one without walnuts for another single-layer 9x13 cake.  This recipe is a welcome variation on traditional "carrot-only" carrot cake.  The addition of pineapple, coconut flakes and raisins makes this carrot cake burst with flavor and gives it a rich sweet, but light flavor.  The texture was dense and moist, not light and somewhat dry, like some "carrot-only" carrot cakes.  It has 1/2 the rising agent as the Carrot Cake III Recipe, so it is not as airy and fluffy.  It is more like a quick bread rather than a traditional cake.

This is a good recipe that I used, to bake my first carrot cake for my husband's birthday.It is moist and delicious and our friends enjoyed eating it. However, my husband and I did not care for the coconut and raisins.I shall omit them. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

WOW- SOOOOO GOOOOD!!!!!! I must say up front, I did change the recipe, I subbed 1 C gluten free brown rice flour, and 1 cup potato starch for the wheat flour. After that did the recipe as written and it was the best  Carrot cake  I have ever tasted! I worked great with the gluten free subs.

I wasn't a carrot cake lover but needed to make one for our upcoming family Easter Dinner.  This one was fabulous. Moist, tasty and not hard to make. Even my son, who doesn't like coconut, nuts or raisins is eating it!  Thanks for the recipe. I will be making this for our family get together!

My first time making carrot cake and this particular one is a wonderful moist recipe! I used 5 medium size carrots, substitute with LIGHT cream cheese and reduced fat buttermilk. I also used an Orange Cream Cheese Frosting recipe with this and it was excellent! Instead of a cake, I did this in large texas size cupcake tin (it made 15 nice size cupcakes) This way I was able to share with others. I received so many compliments on this recipe!

I made this for my boss's Birthday.  Now everyone wants me to make it.  It is awesome.  So moist and good. It does darkens very fast so I baked 45 minutes on 350 then down to 325 for the last 15 min.  Today I made 2 smaller cakes (one for work and one for home.) I just watched it at 350 then moved to 325.  I also used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe. It makes it even better!

Super moist and delicious.  We really enjoyed this cake and found that it was rather quick to whip up.  I added an extra cup of shredded carrots and left out the nuts, coconut and raisins. For the frosting, I used 1 1/2 bricks of cream cheese and about 1 pound of powdered sugar, plus a couple teaspoons vanilla. Extremely yummy and we'll definitely make this again. I think next time I'll add the nuts though. I also baked in 2 8" round cake pans for exactly 30 minutes which was perfect.

DELICIOUS! I omitted raisins, as I have high iron and they are high in iron, and I added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, but other than that, I stuck to the recipe and frosted it with cream cheese frosting. This is my go to recipe for carrot cake from now on!

Made 3 carrot cakes with this recipe for a party and the feedback was "wow, this is the BEST carrot cake I have ever had". It's really an incredible cake! Make the cake 1-2 days ahead, it improves after standing.
HIGH ALTITUDE CHANGES: We live at 6,300 feet, so I had to make normal changes for baking here: 
4 eggs (in stead of 3), 
1 cup sugar (in stead of 1 1/2 cup), 
2 cups + 2 1/2 tbsp flour (in stead of 2 cups),
Kept baking soda at 2 teaspoons,
Added 2 1/2 tablespoons of orange liqueur (water is fine too),
Temp = 365F (in stead of 350F),
Baked it for 55 minutes in a 10" spring form --> came out perfect. I would only do above changes if you live at high altitude.
Made it with cream cheese frosting II (but we only used 1 cup powdered sugar, not 2 cups).

Must have been my oven, but might recommend turning down the temperature to 325F and/or less time as well. Mine started to char a bit on the outside but still a bit moist on the inside before the time was up. Otherwise really a great recipe.

This was a very good recipe.  I omitted the coconut and raisins, due to personal preference.  I baked it for 55 minutes.  It was very moist and not too spicy, like other carrot cakes I've had.  I will likely make again.  I frosted with a cream cheese icing and it was a big hit!

This cake is fantastic- I had to freeze half of it because I knew I'd eat it all myself! I used brown and white sugar mixed together and as I had no buttermilk, I added a tsp of lemon juice to almond milk and it turned out fine!I'll definitely make this again.

I made it the way SCOTCHGIR did. Changing the three items. Made it for a church function. People were fighting over the pieces and I had to make 2 more for the next day for everyone. Thank you. It is scrumptious.

Tried this recipe last night for a family dinner and it went over very well.  I can't stop eating the leftover, deliciously cold from the fridge.  I only made slight changes - no raisins, 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour, slightly less sugar.  I topped the cake with cream cheese frosting.  This is a keeper.

This cake is wonderful and the only change I would make is to use 15 ounces of pineapple drained instead of only 8 ounces.  It is great without frosting (I like it better that way).

WOW Delicious! I made this for my husband's birthday because carrot cake is his favorite. I never understood why carrot cake would be anyone's favorite until now! This cake is FABULOUS! Rich & moist & full of texture. I recommend cream cheese frosting with it, which is what I did. Perfect partner for this cake! I left out the raisins, I'm just not a fan or raisins in general. I put it in three 7 inch round pans and cooked for about 37 minutes, turned out perfect!  YUM YUM thank you Sam!

GREAT!! Made it for a work party, and I was told it was the best carrot cake ever. I made a few changes. No raisins, I added a little more carrot and I only added 1 cup of white sugar and a 1/2 cup of brown instead of all the white the recipe suggests. I will deff make again!

This is good but I wish I had run my can of crushed pineapples into my food processor because there were some bits that were too large.  I didn't use raisins or nuts since I'm not fond of that.  Otherwise awesome recipe!  Make 2 dozen standard cupcakes and 2 dozen mini cupcakes.

Made these into muffins. This recipe yielded about 27 muffins, and I needed to bake them for 42 minutes or so.  I ran the carrots through the food processor, and the nuts, too (although separately) in order to make things easier.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts, which turned out very nice. I also added an extra 1/2 cup of carrots because I omitted the coconut.  These reminded me a tad of a morning glory muffin, but I think that is because a used a muffin tin instead of a cake tin because I was looking for a little "portion control"  ;-).  Perhaps if I made it into an official cake and frosted it, it would remind me more of carrot cake.  Either way, they were definitely moist and delicious!    I also served them with Cream Cheese Frosting II and they were fabulous!

The best carrot cake I've ever had.  I did add more carrots and left out the coconut. It took time to make, but it was well worth it.

Delicious!!! I love the carrot-pineapple-coconut-raisin-walnut combination, and even friends that "don't like carrot cake" enjoyed it b/c they said it wasn't "too carrot-y". I just got a masticating juicer, so I made a couple substitutions. I used 2c of carrot pulp mixed w/ a little carrot juice, and 1c of freshly crushed pineapple. I also cooked the raisins in some fresh orange and pineapple juice to plump them up a bit before baking, used half olive oil (light in flavor) which didn't seem to change the flavor, half whole wheat flour, and powdered buttermilk. I made cupcakes, and baked them for 35 min @ 350. ...and they came out perfect! I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/cream-cheese-frosting-ii-2) and sprinkled with toasted chopped walnuts. mmmmm! Thanks for the recipe!! :)

My first attempt at a carrot cake and it was probably THE BEST I've ever had ( and i made it!!!).   Super moist and delicious.  Passed this recipe onto my sister and her family loved it as well.  Used the creamcheese frosting II and it was great.  THANK YOU SAM!!

Amazing! I made this for Mother's Day and my mom loved it as did everyone else in my house. I made the recipe exactly and it was easy and delicious. I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II as suggested and they were perfect together. I never liked carrot cake until I made this recipe. The crushed pineapple makes all the difference. Thank you so much!

Truly outstanding restaurant quality carrot cake!  I made this recipe today for our Mothers Day Dinner and it just blew everyone away!!  I followed the recipe exactly and would not change a thing.  I frosted the cake with a good cream cheese frosting just your basic cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla and butter....simply a treat worth going off the diet for!  Thank you so much Brian for sharing such a wonderful recipe with us.

I used plain yogurt instead of buttermilk because my attempt of making sourmilk did not work. 
The result was perfect. My husband thinks I should  make this for sale. And this was my first try at baking!
I am very happy with this and will do it again.

Delicious!! Made cake as directly, I was a bit worried because my kids aren't fond of raisins or nuts but I added anyway. They loved it. I did sub applesause for some of the oil. Very moist and yummy cake.

The only changes I made was to reduce the sugar by 1/2; instead of vegetable oil I used organic virgin coconut oil; also I did not have pineapple so I used a banana (diced). I made these into cupcakes, baked for 35 minutes. Turned out perfect, moist & very tastey.

Excellent cake.... but I think that the size pan is wrong. using the 8x10 pan was too small for the amount of batter. I think it should be 9x13 pan. The batter oozzed out of the 8x10 pan.

Made exactly as directed per the recipe. For some some reason mine burnt around the outside even though I removed it from the oven 5 minutes early (baked in the suggested 8x12 pan) & we could taste it, so I cut away all the crust prior to frosting (cream cheese of course), so I guess my suggestion would be to just keep an eye on it because all ovens are different. Loved the flavor & texture, as well as all the different fruits, etc...I can see why Sam's Carrot Cake became so famous!

Holy cow! This stuff is amazing! I had never made a carrot cake before and this one turned out wonderfully. Everyone loved it, even those who normally don't care for carrot cake. The only change I made was to soak the raisins in some warm water for a few minutes before adding, and I think it was a good idea. I used 'Cream Cheese Frosting II' from this site and this cake was to die for. This is definitely a keeper!

Amazing! Moist and full of flavor!    The second time I made it I didn't have crushed pineapple, so I used applesauce - it tastes great, too!  Also, I made half the recipe for the icing and liked it better - you can taste more of the cake.

I made cupcakes from this recipe and from what I've been told, they are heavenly! I personally can't have sugar so this review is based on all the compliments I received from a church function and relatives. I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site, however, I was told the cake is so amazing it doesn't need any frosting. My picky husband even loved it. This is my carrot cake recipe from now on. Thank you so much for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

Made a double batch, made closer to about 34 cakes rather than 24, and the icing would have been enough to ice double that! However, I received absolutely rave reviews and they were delicious. I added 3 jellybeans of different flavors to the top to have something cute and fun instead of just the walnuts. I am going to try this as a carrot cake bread next time.

This cake is amazing. Carrot cake is one of my favorites and I was surprised at how good this turned out. I used a cream cheese frosting and it was a perfect match.

Delicious!  I made cupcakes with this recipe instead of a cake and cut the baking time to about 30 minutes.  I frosted them with cream cheese frosting.  Yum!  The only change I made was to omit the coconut because I simply didn't have any.

Seriously, the best carrot cake ever, if not THE best cake, period!  I also used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe, though added a teaspoon of almond extract to it.  Changed nothing to the cake recipe.  Delicious!!!

this cake is FABULOUS.  I read the reviews and used 3 cups carrots instead of 2, used applesauce instead of oil, and left out the coconut and raisins. Be careful if you bake it this way, it's hard to tell when it's done because the cake is so moist.  Have served this to several people and everyone says it is the best cake they've ever tasted  - I'll be making it over and over.  I made 2 8" cake pans and one loaf pan out of one recipe and they didn't rise much (probably due to the applesauce) but were moist  and delicious, so that wasn't an issue.  Freezes very well, I thawed it out on a cooling rack so it wouldn't "sweat" and get soggy.  Really good with cream cheese frosting!

This cake was great; I made if for Easter. I used fresh pineapple, because I did not have canned and used walnuts, finely chopped, because we did not have pecans. My father-n-law raved about it and he is a wonderful cook! I also used the cream cheese frosting II from this website to top it off..........yummy!

I omitted the walnuts because I'm not a fan of walnuts, but this is delicious!!  Since I didn't have an 8x12" pan, I used a muffin pan.  Turned out beautifully!  Will definitely use this recipe again.

This was super moist and very good.  Shared for Easter and everyone loved it...it's got a little much fruit for my liking I would have liked more carrots less everything else...just a personal preference.

I made this for Easter dessert. It was wonderful! I used 2 round pans and made a layered cake. My family raved about it! I plan to make another one to take to work for my co-workers who love carrot cake!

WOW.  I was concerned when I baked it because it appeared too dense.  I baked it in 2 -9 inch round pans until toothpick came out clean.  Be careful when removing it because it is fragile.   I frosted it with cream cheese frostin II.  It was amazing!  I got so many compliments.  The cake was moist, chewy with a crunch.  I followed the recipe except I added a dash of ginger, nutmeg and cloves.  Greatly reccomended, don't be scared when you first see it baked.

This was so good!  I did make changes to reduce fat and make it a little more heart healthy, but I don't think it took too much away from the original recipe so I feel comfortable reviewing it!  I used whole wheat flour and pumpkin puree instead of the oil.  I was worried about it being a little dry because of the flour but it turned out SO great!  So moist and delicious!  I will never use another recipe again!  Frosted it with a great cream cheese frosting recipe from this sit (2- 8oz packages cream cheese, 2 C confectioner's sugar, 1/2 cup butter, & 1 teaspoon vanilla)- the frosting was also the best cream cheese frosting I've ever tasted, more cream cheese-like, not super sweet.  Perfect compliment to this carrot cake!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Fantastic! Best carrot cake I've ever tasted. I've made this twice in one week because the family ate the first one before Easter came. The only recipe I'll ever use. It's easy to put together and tastes like it came from a high end restaurant! Do not hesitate to make this cake.

I didn't think this was as awesome as other reviewers did. I made the recipe almost exactly as written but omitted the coconut and added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. I baked it in 2 9" round aluminum pans with straight sides and it was done in 35 minutes (another reviewer said 45, so I am glad I checked at 35!). It was very good but not a wow. Just too much going on. My son, who LOVES pineapple, didn't like pineapple being in the cake. My husband and I didn't care for the raisins. It wasn't overly sweet; I actually would have preferred it to be a little sweeter! I will try it again without the pineapple or raisins, but will likely try other recipes as well. It was very good, just not a wow or something I can see myself making again and again without some major revisions.

Great cake! I missed out the walnuts as I was allergic and made in two 8*8 pans for 50 minutes and it turned out great. Took it to Easter party and everyone loved it (and I don't think they were being polite either!)  Topped with the Cream Cheese Frosting II like many other people.

Amazing! I changed just a touch by adding 1/2 cup of brown sugar to make 2 cups total, and I used 1 cup canola oil and a teaspoon of nutmeg. I baked in two 9 inch cake pans for 30 minutes and after I frosted I sprinkled with the remaining walnuts. I kept out the raisins since I don't like them. And I have to say this is the very best carrot cake I have ever had and would be with or without my changes since they are subtle due to my tastes. I would recommend this one to anyone. Thank you for your recipe :)

This was the best carrot cake recipe I've made. Super moist. I brought this to church today for Easter and everyone devoured it! I did use a gluten free all purpose flour and used 1/2 cup apple sauce and 1/4 canola oil. Topped it with the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe. Delicious.

Perfection.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and this cake is AMAZING.  It is definitely moist, but by no means overly so.  I used a 9 x 13 glass baking dish (greased/floured) and folks did not have any trouble removing slices from the pan.  I iced it with the Basic Cream Cheese Frosting from this site (by JJ) and even decorated with little icing carrots.  Everyone at our Easter lunch flipped over this dessert.  So, so good.

Brilliant recipe - the flavour was amazing. I didn't put any raisins in the dough, never liked those things. I made cupcakes instead of a cake and it was enough for 22 medium-sized cupcakes. I had to bake them for about half an hour and even then it still seemed a tad too moist, however, once they stand for a while the texture becomes a bit drier, making it perfect! I also used Cream Cheese Frosting II - great combination. Definitely goes into my recipe box!

I made this recipe and only omited the raisins. They were so good. I made 30 cupcakes and baked for 30 min. at 350. I also added a cream cheese frosting (1 8OZ cream cheese, 4 TBSP butter, 1 tsp vanilla @ zest of 1 orange beat with 1 LB confectioners sugars) So yummy!!!! I say no more....

Good flavor and super moist.  I cut the sugar to 1 cup and it was plenty sweet. I also used 3 cups shredded carrots and omitted the coconut.

This is one of the best carrot cake recipes ever!  I'm pretty particular about what I like and this is a definite do over.  The perfect finishing touch is a good cream cheese frosting.

This cake is very dense and heavy. It has a good flavor but everyone I served it to at my b-b-q commented on how dense it was, the guys laughed and made jokes like this is survival cake, or all you need for a meal is this cake. I could not even finish my piece. So I think I will move on to try a different carrot cake. It doesnt taste bad just to heavy.

I'm giving this 5 stars even though the way I made it and with the ingredients I made it with, it didn't quite make it.  I am in Europe, so do not have the luxury of Dole crushed pineapple (oh how I miss it) and have to deal with tasteless end-of-winter carrots.  The carrot cake was rich tasting, but I missed the sweetness of good quality crushed pineapple and sweet carrots.  Tried crushing pineapple chunks and then just ended up tearing up pieces by hand.  Added more sugar to make up for the lackluster taste of the cheap pineapple.  Also added a bit of nutmeg.  Used finely chopped hazelnuts and no raisins. Made as cupcakes and they came out great. Need to make again tomorrow and will keep all these things in mind.

Moist, amazing textures, just sweet enough, dense, delicous!!!Thank you, Grandpa Sam and Brian! This recipe is truly perfect. i made this  three days ago as cupcakes, ate one this morning, and they are still perfectly moist and delicious! I baked a trial batch to see if i should bake these for Easter, and they are a hit. My kids, co-workers and family have all raved about them. I nearly followed the recipe as written (added some nutmeg).We did frost some with store bought whipped cream cheese frosting, which added some extra sweetness, but totally not necessary. I am excited to bake another batch tomorrow, and have our home fill with the sweet smell of Sam's Famous Carrot Cake!!!

I baked this last year for Easter and was totally blown away by the amazing taste (moist) and flavorful cake!  I'm not a big cake lover, however, carrot cake is an exception.  I kept talking about it and handed out the recipe more than once.  My kids LOVED it after their Easter dinner.  I frosted it with the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site.  Only change I made was leaving out the coconut... not a fan.  Planning on making this again for the Easter feast as it was requested!

WOW  this is absolutley THE BEST carrot cake recipe I have ever had!! Moist, flavorful. I topped with cool whip. I was excellent. I had an afternoon brunch with an 82 year old lady and I took this cake still warm. She agreed and said it was the best SHE had ever had too. She is one of 12 siblings and has 9 childrern herself.. so you know she has spent many hours in the kitchen and has tried many many many carrot cake recipes!!  THANK YOU BRIAN!!!!!!!!!!!!

This cake was incredible!!  Was a little nervous when adding pineapple, but it was a BIG hit!  I did not add the coconut or raising, but when I make this weekend, will add the coconut, I think it will be even better!  I also took the advice of another and added 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg.
Truly an excellent cake!  Actually - it was too good that I had to give it away so as not to gorge myself!
Use the cream cheese frosting II on this website, went great with this cake!

I made them almost exactly to recipe and they were  great! SImply because I didn't have quite enough, I used about 1/2 of the called for amounts of pineapple, walnuts, and raisins. I also added a little more cinnamon and some nutmeg.

I didn't like the idea of the coconut so I left it out and added an third cup of carrots.   I also cooked the pineapple and the raisins together for a while and added it when prompted (after it had cooled).  It turned out great!  The extra carrots gave it a great texture and a nice presentation.

Fantastic!  
The only things I didn't add were the walnuts and raisins. I put 1/2 pecans on top for decoration though. Yum!

I wasn't keen on pouring in 3/4 cups oil and 1 1/2 cups white sugar so I may try this again with applesauce instead of oil and swap out some of the sugar for other less-refined sweeteners. But wow - the moisture content was great and the sweetness too.  Mmmmm. Will definitely make again!!

This is by far the best carrot cake I have ever tasted. I did NOT change anything. It is so moist and so delicious.  I'm sitting here with my second piece and still can't believe how much flavor it has.
I made a cream cheese frosting but it really is wonderful without it.

Yummy and very moist! I added an extra cup of carrots, and no nuts (brought it into work). Thought it could have used a bit more cinnimon or something....

I have a cupcake business and this is the recipe I use, except I leave out the raisins.  EVERYONE loves them, they are my most popular flavor.  I make them with the "whipped cream cheese" frosting from this site, delish!

I made this cake the day before serving. It was moist and tasty. I substituted applesauce for some of the oil and soaked the raisins in bourbon because I was making a cream cheese with brown butter and bourbon frosting from this site. 
I also added some nutmeg and used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose.
It was terrific and everyone loved it.

The cake was good and moist, but not as much spice flavor as I like to have in my carrot cake.  I added ginger and nutmeg and increased the cinnamon, but still wasn't quite where I wanted it and I could've added more.  I did omit the coconut, pineapple, and raisins as I don't like those.  I increased the carrots to 3 cups and found that buying a 10oz bag of shredded carrots in my grocer's produce section equaled the three cups and saved time.  I used the frosting recipe from the Carrot Cake II recipe on this site.  I did this as a 2 layer cake and it baked up very nice.

FANTASTIC!!!  I didn't have buttermilk, so I added 1 tsp of Lemon Juice to the regular amt of milk.  I used 3 cups of carrots, only 1/2 cup of walnuts,  and omitted the raisins and coconut.  For icing, I  used 1 - 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, and 2 cups icing sugar, 1.5 tsp. vanilla whipped up.  YUMMY!

This recipe was good, but my favorite 'carrot cake' recipe comes from the Los Angeles Times cookbook.  YUM.  This was a bit oily, as others as have said.  I did what someone suggested and added some lemon juice and rind, which as tasty, as I do love the taste of citrus.  If I would make any suggestions, it would be to lower the raisins and coconut the 1/2 cup and add one more cup of carrots for a more carrot taste.  I know some said the pineapple was chunky, but I used the crushed and it was fine for me.  I did use "carrot cake frosting II" (there are two of those and I used the one which had 8 oz of cream cheese and 4 cups of confectioners sugar.)  That was FANTASTIC.

Though very good, this is not the best I have ever had.  It could be spicier in my opinion.  I prefer a heavier, denser, carrot cake.

I made this Sam's Carrot Cake for Easter this year and I loved it.  It was rich, moist and full of flavor.  It wasn't too heavy even though it has all the extras.  I'm looking for another excuse to make it again soon.

I don't review many recipes, but just had to add my 5 stars to the list-the hardest part was grating the carrots, otherwise very easy. I left out the raisins but it was still incredibly moist, and the only other change that I made was to add a little more cinnamon and allspice, and then divided the recipe between two 9" round pans. It took approx 40mins to bake. Can't wait to make this again for Thanksgiving!

If I could give this recipe more stars I would.  I normally do not like carrot cake, nor do I eat coconut but this made me a firm believer that you must try things that you have never like prepared in other ways!!!  My daycare kids as well as my own loved this too!!   SIMPLY AWESOME BUT I HAVE ONE COMPLAINT...THE CUPCAKE PICTURE NEXT TO THE RECIPE DOES NO JUSTICE FOR SAM'S FAMOUS CARROT CAKE!!!!!!

I have never made a carrot cake from scratch before.  At first I didnt think it was sweet enough. But after adding cream cheese frosting it was perfect. I could not stop eating it!  I will try this recipe again in the near future.

One of my favorite cakes.  Such a subtle taste, and so easy to make.  Probably shouldn't make it as much as I do, but can't resist.  Stays moist until gone, even seems to get moister as it ages.

A winner at the cake walk.  Mouths were drooling.  Very easy to make, but a bit expensive.  Also very fruit filled and definitley one of the better comfort foods out there.  Thanks for a great recipe that I will definitely make for special people.

I followed the recipe exactly.  It is yummy but I feel it's missing a secret ingredient.  Also, I would like a really good cream cheese frosting on it but haven't been able to find just the right recipe.  I would love to top it with Shaws' cream cheese frosting if I could ever get a hold of the recipe!  I made this into cupcakes.  The batter needs to fill at least 3/4 of the cupcake liner.  The cake doesn't rise that much.  Also I found the cupcakes take 23 minutes to cook.

It's really hard to review a 5 star recipe. I just wanted mine to be a bit more spicey and with a little less fat. 
So I increased the spices to include: 1/2  t each of allspice, nutmeg and cloves. I substituted 1/3 cup butter and 1/2 cup no fat sour cream for the oil.
I also used 1cup wheat flour in place of 1 cup white, and 1 cup brown sugar in place of 1 cup  white. And left out the pineapple. These just fitted my taste better. Great base recipe as is, 
Yummy, moist, and DELICS!
Maybe next time I'll try without the coconut to have strictly "Carrot Cake"

Very good!
I omitted the raisins, like most people did too, but honestly think that people shouldn't omit the pineapple--it's a key ingredient that makes this recipe distinguished from other typical carrot cakes. 
I also used chopped walnuts and Cream Cheese Frosting II, also from this website, to top it off. 
The reason why I knocked off a star is because although this recipe is pretty good, it isn't "heavenly"--I rarely give 5 stars, by the way, but I would give this 4.5 stars if I could. 
This will be my go-to recipe when my family is craving carrot cake.

REALLY REALLY GooooooooooooooD!  I'm not a huge fan of the raisins (and I boiled them in oj as someone else suggested)-it's just a personal preference-I don't like raisins cooked into things as a rule.  Other than that this was FANTASTIC.  I got GREAT compliments.

I made these for my future mother-in-laws birthday. They were a big hit and helped me make a good impression on the extended family I was meeting for the first time. The only change I made was to add a bit more vanilla and pineapple

Absolutely the very best carrot cake recipe I have ever made or tasted!  Moist, flavourful and packed with great ingredients.  I opted to make this recipe into cupcakes and they turned out fantastic with a cream cheese frosting on top.  There's only one problem...once you have one, you'll want more and more!  THANKS, SAM!

I just finished eating my first piece of this cake and it was AMAZING!  I have to say THE BEST CARROT CAKE I have ever had in my life!!!!  My 10 year old son (with my directions) made this, following the directions to a T, with the exception- we omitted the nuts (I don't like nuts in cakes/breads), and the coconut.  Instead of raisins we bought dried mixed berries (cranberries, blueberries, ect)- boiled them in orange juice before hand and let them cool before adding at the end.  This will forever be my favorite go-to recipe for carrot cake!  Sam was a genious!  Thanks for sharing this recipe my taste buds appreciate it greatly!!

OMG!  The best carrot cake ever, extremely moist!  I made mine into cupcakes and baked for 25 minutes, turned out awesome.  I will definitely make these again very soon!  For frosting I used 8 oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 16 oz powdered sugar.

I made this cake with the Cream Cheese Frosting II for my mother's birthday, and it was a hit! I followed some of the other advice here, milk with lemon juice (to replace the buttermilk), extra nutmeg, and I personally left out the raisins. 

Aside from a mix up of the bag of coconut (where I put in about 3ish cups of coconut instead of the one), and using SomerSweet Baker's Blend for the sugar, this cake turned out perfectly!

I doubled the recipe to make 24 cupcakes and an 8" double later cake. Only had half the pineapple needed, so I used applesauce to make up the difference. Also pureed the pineapple, as I didn't want pieces in the cake. Only downfall - all my raisins sank to the bottom! Didn't see any warnings about this. I'm told if you soak them in liquid (water, rum, etc.) they'll plump up and won't sink as much. I know with chocolate chips, if you toss them in flour they won't sink. Wonder if that would work with raisins. Otherwise, the taste was absolutely wonderful!

This is by far the best carrot cake I have ever made/eaten. It beats out any cake I've ever had at a restaurant or bakery. My 5 year old declared it her favorite cake ever and told me she doesn't want those 'other' cakes anymore. It really is perfect, I cannot wait to serve it to people tomorrow. We left out the raisin's and nuts, personal preference, but it still turned out amazing! Thank you so much for posting this, I can't tell you how happy I am to have the most amazing go-to carrot cake recipe now.

This is the BEST carrot cake I have ever eat!  So moist with the best combination of pineapple, coconut & walnuts.  I left out the raisins (yuk).  Cream cheese frosting is the perfect topping.  Thank you for this recipe, I will be making this again & again.

This cake has a very good flavor, but was just missing a little something for me.  Needs just a little more kick, like nutmeg or something.  However, i did leave out a few things due to hubbies dislikes (coconut and nuts).  This was also the most moist carrot cake i've ever had, and i've tried alot!! I will definately be keeping and may try a few extra tweeks suggested by others next time.

This truly is the best Carrot Cake recipe I have found.  It bakes beautifully.  The coconut and pineapple add such depth to the flavor and make this a hearty filling dessert in either cake or cupcake form.  This makes approx 30 cupcakes.  Cream cheese frosting is the best compliment for this finished recipe.

This was delicious and made an excellent cake for my daughter's first (and second!) birthday.  I used only 1/2 cup vegetable oil.  Also, I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I also drained most of the juice from the crushed pineapple.  Super moist, rave reviews.

Everyone who tried this cake loved it. My mom and step dad said it was the best carrot cake they've ever tasted. It also turned my carrot cake hating bf into a lover. Me personally I found it kinda bland but i love spice. I did make a few non dramatic changes. I left out the coconut and added 1 extra cup of carrots. I left out the nuts and just put them on the outside of the cake. I don't ever get buttermilk so i made sour milk out of fat free milk. Upped the cinnamon to a tbs. And i didn't have any small cans of pineapple so i opened a big can and scooped out cup of pineapples with juice. I baked the cake in 2 10inch round cake pans. for 25-35 mins (i don't remember sorry) I frosted with cream cheese frosting 2.

Modified recipe but best carrot cake I've ever made!  Used vanilla soy milk instead of buttermilk.  Skipped walnuts, coconut, raisins and pineapple juice.  Substituted half the flour with soy flour for extra protein.  Delicious and nutritious!  Was a hit with me and my man!

OMG! I made this for a friend's birthday and it was delicious. I did 1.5 x recipe and it fit perfectly in 3 - 9" cake pans. I didn't use the raisins, but made up for it with extra carrots, walnuts and coconut. Doubled the Cream Cheese Frosting II to ice 3 layers and it was perfect! One of the best carrot cakes I've ever had, because it was very moist, and had so many good things in it!

Made cupcakes out of these and everyone loved them, i had to half the time to like 30-35 minutes for every 12 cupcakes. I will definitely only use this recipe from now on. Thank you so so so much for posting this. I think the only thing i changed out of preference was not adding raisins but only cause i didn't have any off hand and not adding the nuts to the actual batter cause i wanted to be able to give the kids with peanut allergies a chance to eat them but other than that it was amazing.

I made my grandmother's recipe tonight and it was nothing like what I remembered.  Searching for another recipe I stumbled upon this one and couldn't believe my eyes.  This is her recipe, almost word for word!  I had to get the recipe card to be sure...this must be "an oldie but a goodie" from back in the day!  I'm giving it a positive rating because although I didn't care for it...if it was hers, it was good!!

Both my coworker and I made this for the Easter holiday and we both LOVED IT! I'm making again for a second time.... because it's the kind of cake that you just crave! That delicious!  

Just love how the flavors blend, the texture, color. Of course, as many others I do a cream cheese icing.

I made this cake for my dad's birthday and he loved it! He is a carrot cake lover :) I made this exactly as directed and it came out so delicious! I baked the cake in 2-9" rounds for 35 minutes and it was perfect. I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site...so yummy! Thanks for sharing your family recipe.

Best ever! Turned our amazing. After reading the reviews about it being too moist and soggy.... I'm wondering if other people didn't really look at the size of their can of crushed pineapple. I picked up the only size available at the grocery store and it turned out to be 14 oz instead of the 8. That may be why.

Topped this with a simple cream cheese/confectioners sugar/vanilla frosting.  Three family members asked for the recipe.  Big hit!

I made this cake for a birthday party -- my first time ever making a carrot cake!  I wanted a really good carrot cake as the birthday girl's favorite is carrot cake.  EVERYONE at the party said this was the best carrot cake ever!  I topped it with the whipped cream cheese recipe, which was also a big hit!

I wish I could give this cake more stars! It's the best carrot cake that I have ever made! I made it for our Easter weekend getaway. My picky husband and kids who are not fans of pineapple really enjoyed it, but the best compliment came from my German MIL when she kept going back for more. She said that the cake was a bit moist (Germans like their cakes a bit drier) but it sure didn't stop her from eating the cake! She said I can make this over and over again. I followed the recipe as written but shredded the carrots a bit finer (not grated), chopped the walnuts a bit smaller for the kids, and added only a tsp of cinnamon instead of two (hubby's not a big fan of cinnamon). Next time I'll try adding an extra 1/2 cup of coconut. I didn't bother making a frosting - the cake was delicious on it's own. I will keep using this recipe from now on. Thanks for sharing your grandfather's recipe, Brian! It is definitely a crowd pleaser.

Extremely delicious- my first attempt at real carrot cake and I'm sure to make this for special occasions again. My family thinks I should open my own bakery, but I gave all the credit to Sam and Allrecipes. I did not add walnuts since we have nut allergies.

I must agree with most others, this cake is fabulous exactly as it is. I used 2 9" round pans and baked it for 45 minutes. I left it cool in the pan on a rack for 10 minutes before removing it from the pan to cool completely. Perfect cake, particularly when I paired it with Cream Cheese Frosting II by Janni.

Turned perfectly moist and flavorful. I opted not to put raisins. Used the brown butter cream cheese frosting to top it. Chilled overnight it was even better!

Simply outstanding!  I made this for my husbands birthday party and everyone raved. Used 1 cup whole wheat flour ( I do that with all my baking) 1 cup unbleached flour, omitted the raisins and doubled the recipe to make a party size  12 inch round 2 layer cake. Filled and frosted with cream cheese frosting. So delish!  Do NOT pass this one up;)

We don't like lots of "stuff" in our carrot cake, so at another reviewer's suggestion I used 3 cups of carrots and left out the coconut, raisins, walnuts and pineapple. The cake was amazing! I frosted it with my favorite -- Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting from allrecipes....absolutely perfect for this cake.

I don't bake much, so I was amazed when this cake turned out so well.  I used "Cream Cheese Frosting with Brown Butter and Bourbon" on the cake and it was soooooooooooo good!  Everyone who ate the cake said that it was better than any they had eaten, homemade or restaurant.  Thank you so much for the great recipe!

I had the ingreg's for this recipe on hand and wanted to 'test' it for a possible cake for our big family easter dinner. I followed recipe exact, and it was AMAZING. 

I used a 9x13 pan and baked it for 45 min. used buttercream frosting.. my family devoured it! will make again in time for easter, and again.. and again..


edit July 22nd - this is my FAVORITE cake recipe from this site. I make it at least twice a month, and it never lasts long in my house! people BEG for it. sometimes in the icing I put some grated orange or lemon rind (start with 1/2 tsp, mix well, and go by taste from there).. a real compliment to the carrot cake flavor!  I have this recipe memorized now, and I will continue to make it for years to come! bring it as a dessert to a dinner party, and it's always a hit.... people who normally don't even like carrot cake love this recipe...
thanks so much for the awesome recipe keeper!!

Wow. This is an awesome carrot cake! I left out the raisins too and followed the rest of the recipe. I served it to my in laws when they visited and we all loved it. I used the cream cheese II recipe on this website, which went prefectly. Thanks!

I'm rating this a 4 for now just because it just came out of the oven and was still warm when I tasted it. I did try to follow the recipe but after reading the disappointed reviews I decided to reduce the liquid, so I just didn't add the pineapple juice but added the pineapples. There is lots going on with this cake with the carrots, raisins, pineapple, and coconut. I think next time I'll omit the coconut, just doesn't seem to fit in the recipe like a traditional carrot cake. still very tasty and moist. I'm not sure if anyone else had this problem but I ended up with LOTS of batter, I was able to make a bunt cake and an 8" square cake. Now my cake needs to cool down and rest for the night and I will ice it with a nice cream cheese icing. Mmmmm

I made this as written except that I omitted the raisins and increased the ingredients by 1/3 (i.e. 4 eggs, etc.). It made an impressive 3 layer 9" round cake. Very easy and flavorful!

10 Stars! I used regular milk, about 6 carrots, and soaked the raisins in OJ in microwave .....the result was AWESOME!! Everyone said the best carrot cake ever. I used cream cheese frosting recipe from my kitchen aid cookbook and added a little orange zest. Wow!

I have had trouble finding a good carrot cake recipe, and love this one.  It always turns out.  I usually make 2 round pans, frost and freeze one.  It freezes great, so I just take it out of the freezer when I want a ready made delicious dessert.

I am not really sure about this one.  I have made loads of other carrot cakes before and none have come out like this one.   Texture is really dense and heavy.  Very oily also.  Flavor very bland even though I added ginger, nutmeg, clove and cardamon.   If I made this again I would cut my oil with applesauce, use brown sugar, up the cinnamon, omit the coconut.  Going to frost it with cream cheese frosting and hope it will be better.   Disappointing at best.

I made this for my daughter's birthday, and it was very good.  I used two round pans and sliced both layers after the cake was baked so I would have a 4-layer cake and iced it with cream cheese icing.  The only thing I will do different next time is to bake it 10-15 minutes less.  I checked my oven and the temperature was correct.

WOW!  This is THE best.  My mom has been making carrot cake similar to this for years and it just brought back so many awesome memories of eating it at Christmas time.  The only changes I made were to use pecans instead of walnuts and I omitted the raisins.

As others stated, This is an exceptional cake as written.  I paired it with the whipped cream, cream cheese icing.  I baked and iced this cake in the am and had it for desert at night.  IMO the piece of cake that I had the next day was even better!!

This was my first time making carrot cake and not only was this a very easy recipe, but very flavorful as well.  I only omitted the coconut since not many people in my family like coconut.  I like the addition of the pineapple and raisins because I thought it made it more "dense" with the extra moisture.  I think this cake was great without any frosting, but a traditional cream cheese went nicely on it also.

By far the most amazing carrot cake I have ever had/made. My boyfriend begs for this cake! I have made over 10 times in the last 6 months. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made a double layer sheet cake with cream cheese icing and a huge hit.  Had people tell me it was the best carrot cake they'd ever eaten.  I used fresh pineapple.  People want the recipe!  Served it to 100 people and most of it was gone.

Exactly what I was looking for, worth the time and effort.  I used golden raisins and substituted a portion of the oil with applesauce

Excellent flavor and texture.  I used 1/4 cup of applesauce in place of 1/4 cup of oil thus taking the fat down a little.  It was still great!  Hubby loved it!

I've tried the carrot cake that is rated #1 on this site and Sam's cake, and I've got to say that this cake is by far the best tasting.   Very moist and full of flavor.  I omitted the raisins and nuts just b/c of personal preference and increased the carrots to 3C.  Next time, I think I will leave out the coconut too...it doesn't need it.

I took this cake, frosted with Cream Cheese II frosting and got rave reviews. Everyone there said it was the best carrot cake they had ever had.  Always  a winner whenever I have made it, exactly as posted.

I made this in a Bundt pan (reduce temp to 325° & cooked 10 min. more).  If you have a coconut hater like I do try chopping it really finely. I'm not sure why a few people rated this so badly. I made no changes to the recipe & it was a family favorite. My guess is that they made it wrong! I found a very good cream cheese frosting from Food Network that is much better than anything I found here. Maybe that makes a difference.  Awesome recipe Sam (& Brian)!

This carrot cake is awesome! I have, however tweeked it a bit. I took the advice of a previous review and replaced the oil with applesauce. I then left out the cinnamon and added 3 tsp pumpkin pie spice and I finely minced crystallized ginger-not sure how much I used though, perhaps 1/4 c? Then of course I had to top it with cream cheese icing! Man, was it delicious! Thanks for sharing this recipe, it is definately a keeper!

Absolutely the BEST carrot cake I have ever had!  After seeing that someone had used this for a wedding cake, I snagged this recipe to make a 4 tier cake for party I was catering.  I received compliment after compliment on it!  The only thing I might change is to add a few more spices, but that is my own personal preference... a bit of cloves and maybe a pinch of nutmeg.  Even without doing that, this is a perfect carrot cake, and will now be my go-to recipe for carrot cake. YUM!!!

I am so reluctant to give this recipe less than the 5 stars but it was not exactly a CARROT CAKE!  I made this for an Easter gathering of 20 people and couldn't wait for the kudos.  After dessert was eaten no comments were made except that "you said this was carrot cake, where are the carrots"?  Good question, although delicious, there simply wasn't any taste or evidence of the carrots - perhaps 3 cups of carrots and less pineapple, coconut, raisins, etc would have pleased my friends.  Thanks for sharing!

Made this recipe for Easter without the coconut as family doesn't like it. A very heavy, moist cake. I had never made carrot cake before so I don't know if this is typical. I though I had messed up the cake but family tells me carrot cake is supposed to be this heavy? Anyways it is very tasty either way.

I made this just as the recipe was written.  It came out fabulous!  I frosted it with the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site as recommended by other reviewers.  The whole family loved it, and there was only a sliver left over.  Thank you Sam for sharing your most excellent carrot cake recipe.

Tried this recipe for my first Carrot Cake attempt! WOW!!! Everyone just loved it! I did use canola oil instead of vegetable oil, added a pinch of fresh-ground nutmeg, and made 2 round layers so I could make marzipan 'carrots' to decorate the top. I will most definitely make this again, in fact when I go back 'up north' my son has already requested I make it for him and his family.

This was fabulous!  Made it for Easter and people could not wait to cut into it.  We were not disappointed!!  Moist and wonderful.  I left out the raisins, but kept everything else the same.  I did bake it in 2 - 9 inch round pans for 35 minutes and it came out perfectly.  Thanks!

Really good, moist cake.  Made to recipe and everyone enjoyed it.  used cream cheese frosting, went perfectly.  I did add lemon zest and juice to cake and frosting, but don't know if it really added anything to the already great cake.  Thanks for the recipe, I'll use as my staple carrot cake.

This is better than any carrot cake I have tasted so far... My husband loves it. If a 10 year can eat carrot cake and ask for more, there is nothing else to say! Sam's Carrot cake will be my main carrot cake. I did not do a single alteration.

Fantastic! One of the best carrot cake's I've ever tasted. I omitted the raisins just as a personal preference. I think next time I might add more carrots. Also, I think I will run the coconut through the food processor, some of the flakes of coconuts were too long and was distracting the texture of the cake.

Excellent carrot cake.  I followed the recipe as is, but omitted the walnuts and raisins (my family does not like them) and it was delicious.  Very moist and flavorful.  I topped the cake with the "whipped cream cheese frosting" from this site.  This will definatly be my go to recipe for carrot cake.

I made this for my sister's wedding and everyone raved about it! I added some lemon zest (just because nothing can go wrong with lemon) and it came out wonderful.. (I did skip the raisins) I used a cream cheese frosting which I also modified by adding lemon zest and some of the pineapple juice... thank you!

I made this for Easter last year and everyone raved about how it was better than the local bakery's carrot cake! I will be making it again this coming Easter!

Perfectly moist and delicious!!  I doubled the recipe and made just over 4 dozen cupcakes.  They cooked perfectly in about 28 mins.

I made this in three 9" round cake pans; it took about 25 minutes to bake.  It was moist, flavorful and just dense enough to hold up to the cream cheese frosting.  We will definitely be making this again!

I am not a fan of carrot cake, and this is absolutely WONDERFUL.  I soaked the raisins I used in rum and orange juice, brought to a slightly boil, then let them soak. For the icing, I added a drop of lemon extract, too...divine. Just divine.

This was outstanding! So very moist and flavorful. I substituted applesauce for the oil and used pecans. I frosted with Cream Cheese II icing and it was incredible.

I have made this cake several times, and it is wonderful!  The only changes I made was to add about 1/8 tsp of nutmeg, and I left out the coconut and raisins for preference reasons.  This time I made cupcakes.  I topped them with cinnamon cream cheese frosting, and they were an absoloute hit at work.  Carrot cake is my favorite dessert of all time, and this is by far the best recipe I have ever tried.

I had never made a layer cake from scratch before. Though I am a good cook, I just haven't baked much. I made this for my new boyfriend's birthdday because he told me carrot cake is his favorite. WOW! You sure made me look good. I'll be passing this recipe on and making another one myself during the holidays. Thanks,  Amanda

I searched far and wide for a carrot cake recipe to make for my Dad’s 70th birthday party.  It’s a bit labor-intensive, but what scratch-cake isn’t?  I omitted the raisins and increased the nuts a little bit (personal preference), otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  I made two 9-inch round cakes, removed them from the pan to cool, then covered them in plastic and refrigerated overnight.  The next day I sliced them both in half for four layers.  I made a cream cheese frosting I invented years ago.  The guests said it was a good combination—not too sweet.  It was a huge hit.  Dad cut everyone a piece and put the rest of the cake on his own plate.  I’d say that was a ringing endorsement!

First ever scratch cake!  It was delicious and I was told I could sell them!  Everyone tells me that I will be getting asked by to bake them one!  Very easy to make.  I'm living in North Carolina and most people make cakes from scratch down here & they know good!

This by far is the best carrot cake I've ever eaten. I've never attempted to make a carrot cake, so for my first time I'm glad I found this recipe. I made two changes; one, I used cake flour instead of all-purpose flour. I'm not certain if that made a difference with the texture or the moisture but it turned out fantastic. Two, I used two round pans vs. the standard 9x13 baking dish and decreased the baking time from 1 hour to 40 minutes. I also used a convection oven and it was baked to perfection! Since I've never made carrot cake before I wasn't certain how the batter should look, it was definitely more runny than your standard Duncan Hines. Wonderful recipe, by far the best I've had!!!!

This was an excellent base for a healthy carrot cake! I cut out a 1/2 cup sugar (the pineapple makes the recipe sweet enough) and instead did 1/2 brown and 1/2 white (to add a richer flavor) Also, I substituted 1/2 oil for applesauce and used reg. milk instead of the buttermilk. It turned out to be a lovely recipe that      yielded a lot! Great for freezing and saving for a rainy day...if there's any left, that is!

This was my first carrot cake and I seemed to have picked the perfect recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing this great gem.  Carrot cake struck me when I planted carrots in my garden earlier this year.  I had just harvested my first bushel of carrots and didn't know what to do with them until I came here to All Recipes.  Garden fresh carrots, how else would you use them??  DUH!  Thanks for making my first a great success!  (i.e. I substituted craisins for the raisins because I like them better.  The recipe worked out wonderfully.)

I am a carrot cake connoisseur.  I love, love, LOVE carrot cake and order it our whenever it is offered on the menu.  I have tried many recipes in my quest to find the perfect carrot cake.  Five stars is not enough.  After trying this recipe I feel like I have reached the Emerald City!!  I didn't change anything from the original recipe as-written.  Sam is now a God in my eyes!  Thank you, Brian!  This is awesome!!

This was a very good cake. I'm not a big fan of carrot cake, but this was cheap and seemed simple to make for Easter. I think that adding store bought shredded carrots would have saved a ton of time.

So moist and lovely!  I baked it in one 8 inch round pan, and six mini-bundts for 30 minutes at 340.  The pineapple is a particularly lovely flavor addition.  I'll probably add some fresh nutmeg next time.  Served with cream cheese frosting and sprinkled with toasted coconut and walnuts.

Oh, good grief this a wonderful recipe! And it's even better the next day! I'll never make a carrot cake any other way! Thanks so much for sharing! (PS I've made with and without the coconut {3C carrots if you omit coconut} and it's great either way.)

This was the best and easiest carrot cake I've tried. I used 1cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar-didn't have enough rasins so added dried cranberries. Oh and I make them as cupcakes! Thanks

I've used this website for a couple of years and this recipe is finally what prompted me to write a review...an awesome cake as is,but one can play around a little for personal preference and it still turns out great! If you follow the recipe I have no idea how this cake could possibly turn out dry as some reviews say. I leave out the raisins and add a little more coconut.  I also roast the pecans or walnuts first, makes them nice and crunchy. Of course cream cheese icing is a must, and the tastes even better the next day (if there's any left...) thanks Sam! Update:  I have used this recipe several times, never fails!  My latest modification is using natural yogurt to replace buttermilk; coconut oil.  I do reduce sugar and leave out raisins and it's beautiful with a lemon cream cheese frosting.

Now this is a carrot cake! Moist and easy to make. I recommend that you let it sit over night before you eat it because the flavors blend nicely. This is a company coming cake. Thanks to Sam for leaving this for us!

This was really delicious with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site.  I made a 9x13 cake as well as an 8" round.  Both were done baking within 35 minutes so definitely DO NOT "set it and forget it".  The only changes I made were omitting the coconut, used pecans instead of walnuts and I increased the carrots to almost 3 cups.

Baked for my husband's b-day.  He said it was the best he'd ever had. Is already bugging me to make another. Didn't make any changes. However, next time I do plan to use only half cup of raisins.  No other changes.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  The Best!!!

Wow!  Incredible!  Only change I made was that I didn't have buttermilk so used a scant T. lemon juice and regular milk.  Extremely moist and delicious!  And this recipe is a little lower in fat than some of them which makes me even happier!

My family and friends loved it! But I'm very picky about my carrot cake. I think I will stick with Martha and my Mom on this one.

OMG! This cake was so good! It was very moist and delicious. Although it did have a lot of ingredients, it was worth it. I've never had such a good carrot cake.

This was great carrot cake, but there was just a bit too much oil in it for my taste - it weighed it down and left a slight filmy residue. Despite that, I still liked it better than any other carrot cake I've tried. I made it exactly as the recipe specified the first time. The second time around I only used carrots (2 and 1/4 cups, though I really wanted to try 3 cups). Leaving out the pineapple, coconut, and nuts didn't detract from the cake. In my opinion it just made it made for less texture and no pineapple taste. I preferred it with just carrots. Next time I'll use 3c carrots and half the cinnamon to suit husband's taste. Also, I want to see what happens if I cut back just a tad on the oil.

This cake is SO delicious!  I've tried several carrot cakes on this site and this is the true winner.  I left out the coconut and the raisins, but it was still out of this world.  I made it into a 3-layer cake and they baked in a little over 30 minutes.

This will be the only carrot cake recipe I use from now on.  Thanks to Sam, and his grandson Brian for submitting this amazing recipe.

I made this cake yesterday for my husband's 47th birthday.  Carrot cake is his favorite...and I decided to try and make it myself.  This recipe was wonderful and simple to make.  I did make the recipe exactly as instructed except I used a little less raisins.  For the icing, I followed a tip of a previous reviewer who gave an easy cream cheese recipe that really has the cream cheese taste and not the sugary frosting taste.  Very, very good.  Thanks to your Uncle Sam for a new family tradition.

I signed on because I wanted to rate this recipe! By far the best carrot cake I have ever made.  Very moist, nice texture, not too cakey.  Mine baked perfectly in 50 minutes in a 9" x 13" pan.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Simply outstanding.  The only change I made to the recipe was to reduce the amount of nuts.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out simply perfect.  

The cake turned out moist and full of flavor, it was not too dense of a cake.  I will make this one again!

I made this for my dad for Father's Day because carrot cake is his favorite cake of all and he said "this is the best carrot cake I've ever tasted".  So I have to give it 5 stars.  I had a 20 oz. can of pineapple and I accidentally poured the whole thing in but was able to scoop some out so it wasn't too overloaded with pineapple.  I also omitted the coconut (personal preference).  Still came out great.  Will be making again.

Amazing!  I didn't add the walnuts because I'm not a big fan of nuts in cake, but everything else was added.  It was delicious!  I topped it with the cream cheese II recipe that is on this site and it was perfect.  Everyone was impressed!

Excellent cake, moist and flavourful; it reminded me of the carrot cake my mom used to make. It gets four stars because I tweaked it just a little. Instead of 3/4 cup oil, I used 1/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce, increased the cinnamon and reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup. Made it for my mother-in-law for mother's day and everyone loved it.

I am normally not a fan of carrot cake, but this one is delicious, and a very reliable recipe!  I've made it as a layer cake and as cupcakes; it was great both ways.  I omit the coconut, use currants instead of raisins, and chop the walnuts and carrots very fine in a food processor.

I have made this recipe twice. Because my husband can't have coconut, raisins, pineapple, and nuts, I just made the basic carrot cake. I increased the carrots--used 3 cups of Carrots (1#) and added a pinch of ground Cloves.  The bake time was only 25-30 minutes both times.
THIS RECIPE IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL -- very moist.

Hands down the best carrot cake I've ever had! I LOVE carrot cake, and so often there's something not quite right- it's usually to dry or to oily. This cake was SO moist, dense, rich, and delicious. Though it was very moist, it was not greasy at all. I made it for Easter for 9 people. This makes a lot of cake and should have served many more. I served up large thick slices and several people came back for more. I heard rave reviews the entire time we were eating it, many mmmmm's and oh my gosh's and several said it was the best carrot cake they'd ever eaten and wanted the recipe. My dad said it would end up being my new stand by, he was right! 

I used two 8" square pans for baking. I used Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site which was amazing with it. I used pecans in place of walnut due to a family allergy. I omitted coconut and raisins (our preferance) and in place added another cup of carrot. I used 1/2 teaspoon of salt, following another reviewers suggestion. I also added another teaspoon of cinnamon, just because we love it so much!  

There was not much leftover cake to bring home, but I did have some the next day and it was still wonderful and moist. 

I will most definately be making this again!

This is one great carrot cake!  I made it as a sheet cake and mailed it off in a care package.  It was supposed to arrive the next day but didn't.  When it finally arrived, the recipients called, mouths still full of cake, raving about it!  Three days after I sent it off it was still a cake worthy of kudos.  Great cake, travels well!

This cake was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  The taste was fantastic and so easy to make for a scratch cake!  I plumped my raisins in pineapple juice so they were nice and soft.  I baked the cake on Friday for Sunday and it was still moist.  I used the cream cheese icing recipe from the Wilton site.  I used pecans instead of walnuts.  Update:  It's now Tuesday and the cake is still so moist!

Is there room for another glowing review here?  

The only thing I did differently for this recipe was mix some flour, margarine, brown sugar and cinnamon and sprinkled it on top before baking.  It came out with a wonderful coffee cake style "crisp" to it.

I simply googled crisp recipes and found a simple one.

LOVE THIS ONE!!

I was hesitant to make this at first because I have never been a fan of carrot cake.  However-this is truly the BEST I have ever tasted.  
I followed the recipe almost to the tee.  I was feeling blah about adding the pinnaple-but the recipe asks for it to be crushed-which allowed it to not overpower the other ingredients. I was surprised how much I liked it.  Also-I did not add raisins but only because I am not a raising type of woman. We made a homemade cream cheese icing (recipe is from this site as well-see Cream Cheese Frosting II).  My boyfriend and I each had a slice (which there was dead silence for the first 3 bites because we both thought we had landed in heaven) and then he took the remaining to the office and it was gone in minutes. This recipe is a keeper!

Good cake, moist and decent flavor, had comments it needed more spice...even though I added extra cinn., cloves, and nutmeg. I thought it was pretty good, less greasy than other recipes I've tried. Frosted it with a cream cheese glaze. Overall pretty good.

This is the best carrot cake ever!!  I did not change a thing, and it came out perfect.  Try using the cream cheese frosting II on this site.  With these two recipes- you can't go wrong on this one. Love it, love it, love it!

This was the bomb! Next time I won't use golden raisins I just did not like the texture of them in the cake but otherwise it is the best carrot cake I've ever tasted! YUM!

I've been looking for the perfect carrot cake and this is definately it.  
I followed the recipe to the letter and my friends and family love it.  The cake stands alone without frosting, but occassionally I use cream cheese frosting for an even richer taste.  Superb!  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful moist cake. I left my cake unfrosted for a coffee cake and less calories but will make a cream cheese frosting with this at a later time. It has it all, vegetables, fruit, nuts, great stuff and truely delicious!

This cake was incredibly easy to make.  The flavor was wonderful.  Still undecided about the pineapple.  We used a cream cheese frosting with some orange zest and almond extract.  Yummy!

What a find!  This is a great carrot cake; light (as far as carrot cakes go), moist, and not overwhelmingly sweet.  I used pecans, left out the raisins and added about a cup of carrots to compensate.  

Thank you Brian for passing this on to us!!!

WONDERFUL.  I think next time, tho, I will drain the pineapple a bit.  I also substituted half the oil with apple sauce.

I had never made carrot cake before - thought it was too much work.  This recipe was incredible and I will definately make it again.  Shared some with a neighbor and she called to say it was the best carrot cake she has ever had.

This was very good...I did follow another users advice and added more carrot, used oil and applesauce....I too omitted the coconut but did use the raisins.  With the cream cheese frosting it was delicious.  I baked it in an 8x12 pan and flipped it out to frost it.  Mine was done well before 60 minutes though. I would recommend checking it at 30-35 minutes.  Thanks for sharing this!

Awesome!  I made this cake for my dad's birthday.  He doesn't like pineapple, but I followed the recipe anyway.  He LOVED it.  And didn't complain about the pineapple either.  Also my boyfriend doesn't like carrot cake, but he ended up eating most of the cake piece by piece.  And telling everyone how good it is.  Definitely try it.  It's worth every single calorie.  

With the cake I made a cream cheese frosting with some orange rind mixed it.  It was delicious.

This was my first time making carrot cake and this was a great recipe to use.  It was quite delicious.  I substituted 1/4 c. of applesauce for part of the oil and it was still good (with a little less fat.)

This is the first cake I've baked that wasn't a store bought cake mix and it was successful, even with my changes. I did as someone else did and used milk with 1 tsp of lemon juice and I didn't use the walnuts or coconut (this time). I also put cream cheese icing on it. It is wonderful! Everyone loved it. Thank you!

Excellent!!!! Everyone raved and raved the whole time they were eating it. This is my grandmother's new carrot cake recipe after tasting mine.  I left out raisins and put the walnuts on the cream cheese frosting I also made from this site. Too good!!!

This recipe was so good.  I love carrot cake with different flavors and textures and this one was delicious and moist.  My whole family raved about it and they want it for Thanksgiving.  I used the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting with it and it was perfect.

Thank you so much for sharing your Grandpa's recipe with us.   This is the best carrot cake I have ever tasted, I will never use another recipe.  A really moist and not too sweet cake great with cream cheese frosting.
It is a hit in my house and we all call it Sams cake, all the credit must remain with Sam for an awesome recipe.

This is GREAT!  I wasn't a huge carrot cake fan until I found this recipe. My hubby loves carrot cake and claims this as the best he's ever had! I baked it in three 8" pans for about 30 minutes. I frosted it with Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting. We thought it was especially good with all the layers & the cream cheese frosting.

This is definately the BEST CARROT CAKE EVER!!!  Everyone gave it rave reviews and wanted the recipe.  I kept half plain and put cream cheese frosting on the other half.  I can't decide which way tasted better.  I am going to make it again for my father's birthday!  Another review was right on - Grandpa Sam Does Rock!

This cake got rave reviews at a birthday party. One guest who normally buys her child's cakes at a bakery has resolved to bake this instead. Mine turned out very moist. I checked it at after 50 minutes and found it cooked thouroughly. I left out the raisins and iced it with cream cheese frosting.  Next time I will increase the carrots and maybe add some nutmeg. I used a 10x13 pan and was glad I did as I don't think the batter would have fit in the recommended pan.

This review is for the cake only.  DH who is not a baker/cook/etc by any stretch of the imagination made it and got rave reviews.  One taster said it was "the best carrot cake I've ever had!"  Left out the raisins, though, and frosted with cream cheese frosting.  Fab recipe!!

I cut the recipe in half, left out the raisins, used gormet buttermilk.  I was pleased with the texture but the taste was not "out of this world" like i was expecting after all reviews. I would make it again perhaps increasing the carrots for more flavor.

I found the cake had a lot of texture, which was good, but lacking in the moistness category and not the fantastic flavor I had anticipated. So therefore, I'm giving it 5 stars for texture, 3 in the moistness category and 4 for taste. I served this to my husband, father and mother, which all agreed that it was good, but liked my carrot cake recipe better, so i guess i'll stick to my old favorite. I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II, submitted by JJ on this site, which was easy to prepare, creamy and a great taste. Thank you Brian, for giving me the opportunity to try your cake.

I found this recipe a few years ago and it is still in high demand by everyone I know. But for the cake I don't think I would even be invited to a lot of these events. An absolute winner!

I have made this on more then one occasion and have gotten so many compliments on them! I also get asked all the time to make this, including for my Church! I have changed a few of the items my self but it has turned out so wonderful on all counts! Instead of a full cake I have always done cupcakes and my aunt lives them and says they are so delicious and sweet enough without frosting! I am finishing up the latest batch now for my Sons class at church for there Christmas special where he will be reading the take of the Candy Cane in front of our entire church! I'm so excited!

The absolute best carrot cake recipe ever! I make this cake all the time and it has never turned out bad. I sometimes tweak the recipe a bit by adding a little more oil or omitting raisins, adding pumpkin spice or nutmeg. Always turns out beautiful! I love icing it with cream cheese frosting and decorating with crushed pecans and candied carrot spirals. Love it and my family and friends rave about it. Thank you Sam for this amazing recipe!

Only one change was I made it in to two pans instead of one. My husband and my mom cry when there is no more! I had the Cheese cake factory carrot cake and this was far better and didn't cost me $45.00 for a cake. I believe I also use the cream cheese frosting 2 . Only add an extra pure vanilla extract tsp. It's to die for..I have

Ahh, the delicious taste of justice! Quick note about the journey to uncle Sam’s carrot cake. My dads favorite birthday cake. My sister usually does it but couldn’t this time. I stepped up to the plate and asked for her recipe. As you might be correct in thinking you know the answer. She would not. I pleaded, rationalized and justified. Nope. I warned her that might come back to bite her as the reigning carrot cake designate and so it has. Dads favorite and sis, I love you but pass the crown please!

This cake is amazing! I made it as a three layer cake for my husband's birthday. I used Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site and it made enough to cover and fill all 3 layers as well as   frost the sides. The only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the cake. This was my first time making a carrot cake other than my tried and true family favorite, "Grandma's Carrot Cake", which can be found on this site and I was not disappointed. I LOVE my recipe however, it has a glaze on top and I wanted more of a traditional birthday cake look. I have tried my recipe with cream cheese frosting and it just wasn't a perfect match for me. This cake however was fabulous with the cream cheese frosting. Next time I think I will add fewer raisins, as there were more than enough for me. Other than that this cake was perfection!

Wonderful - my daughter and I made this together today, on a snow day from school.  She said it was amazing, and coming from the pickiest eater I've ever known, that's BIG.  Husband loved it too, and wants seconds, which he never does. He particularly liked that it wasn't overly sweet.  I left out the raisins and coconut, as neither goes over big with my family (though I would have loved them) and put in extra carrot to make up the difference.  Next time I have to remember to use parchment paper under the cake, as it stuck with just butter and flour on the pan.   I frosted with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site, but took other reviewer's suggestions to add about 1/2 cup more powdered sugar.

This is the third time in one week I’ve made this cake.  The last time I used sweet potatoes shredded.  I did tweek the cake after reading other reviews.  I used 3/4 of a cup of coconut oil creamed into my sugar and eggs till fluffy. I used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white.  The pineapple I drained very well then added some back if my batter was to dry.  Please note, this is a dense cake so if you test with a toothpick it very likely will come out clean while the cake might not be finished cooking.  My last cake was a double batch, I baked in two ovens at the same temperature and the one oven took 10 more minutes then the other.  Why three in one week?  My son’s building business is renovating a house down the street from me.   I like to show up once in a while with food.  The guys cannot get enough of this cake!

I skipped the raisins because we aren’t fans, and since I used coconut oil, which I had in hand, I skipped the coconut. Turned out amazing! Very rich, and moist, not too sweet. The cream cheese frosting I made was very rich though, so maybe that’s why the cake itself didn’t taste very sweet. I will for sure make this again!

This was the best carrot cake and my family just loved it so it is a keeper for me. The only change I made was instead of using vegetable oil, I used coconut oil and I put in an extra half cup of nuts.

I've learned to read reviews and the reviews saved this recipe. What everyone seems to love is a modified version of this recipe with less oil. I used coconut oil which is a richerr (and delicious) oil, so I did well to use only one cup. The flaked coconut I used didn't;t soften up much in the cooking and I didn't like that aspect of the texture, I'd omit it next time. I was also hoping the pineapple flavour would come through a bit more, but with good cream cheese frosting all is good.

I omitted nuts and raisins due to one family members nut issue, and one family members raisin issue.  (And baked in round pans for a layer cake).  Regardless of those two omissions, this recipe is OUTSTANDING!!!  Thank you.

Delicious.  Moist. Tasty. Everyone in the family loved this.  My husband even asked for the recipe so he could make it himself.   I made no changes that would affect the basic cake...just two for personal likes/dislikes...pecans instead of walnuts and left out the coconut.  Someone said not to use the food processor because it would make the carrot too stringy.  Well, I  used my food processor  with the blade in the bowl and it chopped the carrots into little bits that were perfect for the cake.

I cut back on the portions of carrots and coconut flakes. The cake came out correct in color. I also made my own cream cheese butter cream. I add heavy cream to my icing recipes or evaporated milk if cream isn't handy. I also only use Plugra butter made in Italy, I found this to be the game changer in taste for the icing.

This was delicious, probably the best carrot cake I've ever had.  I veganized this recipe by using an egg-replacer and swapping out the buttermilk with soy milk and lemon juice.  I also substituted applesauce for a third of the oil.

Love this recipe, thanks for sharing!  I followed the instructions except for the raisins, didn't have any. Next time though. I frosted t my two layer carrot cake with Chef Johns cream cheese frosting recipe, perfect pairing!  I did reduce the amount of cinnamon, but again next time ill add the full amount. (I like cinnamon)

Amazing cake! I made a few changes based on several reviewer's comments (doubled the amount of vanilla extract, added a pinch of clove and nutmeg, replaced raisins by dry cranberries). I also added a homemade cream cheese frosting. Wow. My husband is very picky about carrot cakes and he loved this one. So, I am definitively keeping this recipe in my favorites book. Thanks for sharing!

Best carrot cake recipe!!!! I left out the raisins (not a fan) and cooked in 3 cake pans for 23 minutes. FANTASTIC. Doubled a cream cheese frosting recipe. I'll be using this recipe from now on.

This cake is the BOMB!  Left out the raisins as I was out...... didn't miss them at all. The whole family raved about it. Baked in a bunt pan for 40 minutes. Sheer perfection!!
Made this again in a 9x12, frosted with Basic Cream Cheese Frosting(from this website). So moist & delish??. Oh and this time I left out the walnuts!!

I made this cake for a friend's birthday and everyone raved about it!  I was so pleased with the outcome.  I did follow some of the other reviewers suggestions and omit the raisins.  I also added a bit  of nutmeg.  This put it over the top!  This cake is very moist and all round spectacular.  I will never use another carrot cake recipe  I love this!

I made this yesterday for my husband's birthday. I usually make a carrot cake every year and I wanted to try this one since it had so many great reviews.  It was very easy and turned out incredible. I had people literally exclaiming ,"Oh my God!" and "This is the best carrot cake I've ever had!!" I made very minor changes:

4 eggs instead of three due to high elevation
2 3/4 cup of flour due to high elevation
Currants instead of raisins

I made my own frosting. It was super creamy and not too sweet/intense.  The best frosting I've ever made actually:

Marscapone Cheese
Vanilla Extract to taste
Powdered Sugar

The batter went into three, nine inch rounds. Baked at 350° for 45 min at 7,000 feet.

This is my new favorite cake to make. There is no need for a mixer at all. Everything by hand, made no substitutions, exactly what the recipe called for. The only difference is I used two 9" round cake pans. I was a little skeptical because of the crushed pineapples but when you mix it all together and after you've baked it you won't even know it's in there. It's not too sweet it's exactly what the Dr ordered. If you love carrot cake, you'll love this recipe!! Thanks for sharing this.

This is by far my favorite carrot cake recipe.  I made one small substitution....  I did not feel like going to the grocery store, so I put a can of mandarin oranges in the food processor with some of the juice,  and used in place of the crushed pineapple.  Worked great!!!  Will definitely make again!!

It was a little bland at first but started to taste better after it was allowed to 'vegetate'?? for a couple days.

This cake is legit. For parties and special occasions make it just how it's presented, but for all those other times (like today), reduce the sugar to 1 cup. You won't taste the difference after you put frosting on it.

This recipe is so darn good as is, it really is. HOWEVER, here's what I did differently. I replaced flour with all purpose gluten free flour, used 3 cups of shredded carrots and omitted coconut and replaced oil with coconut oil. =)

Absolutely the best carrot cake recipe I have ever made.  I'm done searching for another recipe, this is amazing.  I never have leftovers and everyone gives rave reviews.  Try it, you will not be disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly, no need for substitutions!

I was excited to try this recipe as I was looking for one that was fully loaded with all the goodies. I was particularly pleased to see that it called for less oil than many other carrot cake recipes. I was feeding a big group with lots of adults and kids, though, and children often run at the mention nuts and other dubious texture-changers. So I made two cakes!  Another time-honored recipe, one half of it nut-free, from a neighbor alongside this one.  'Sam's Famous' shone in comparison! Everyone agreed hands-down, and the other had turned out perfect.  I didn't change anything at all when I made this. I made it exactly as directed, and trust me, it ain't broke so don't fix it! De-LISH!

This was the first carrot cake I've ever tried to make and, holy cow, it was GOOD. I brought it to a party where the only other cake happened to be a store-made carrot cake. My mom claims to be a "carrot cake connoisseur" and said this was the best she ever had! I overheard more than one person say "go try the homemade one, it is so good!" and got more compliments than I knew what to do with! The only changes I made to the recipe were to omit the raisins, halve the walnuts, and use 1 tsp cinnamon/1 tsp pumpkin pie spice. In the future, I will definitely try it with all ingredients as written. I also squeezed some excess juice out of my shredded carrots because they seemed a little too wet. I'm not sure if that was necessary, but the finished product was perfect. As many others have suggested, I made the Coconut-Cream Cheese Frosting to go with it--AMAZING. Seriously, it was ridiculously good and easy to make. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Made a few changes to reduce fat: 1/4 cup coconut oil and 1/2 cup applesauce to replace oil.  I also used 3/4 cup granulated sugar and 3/4 brown sugar. This was by far the best carrot cake. Everyone loved it! I took a recommendation by a reviewer for frosting 4 oz reduced fat cream and 4 oz regular cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 2 cups powdered sugar 1 1/2 tspn vanilla. It was fantastic! Next time I'll try just reduced fat cream cheese.

Make it as is - remove nothing, it is perfect.  Beware, if you are a fan of light and airy box cake, this is NOT it.  It is moist, dense, rich, loaded and delicious.  I used a bundt pan so I could get extra frosting on 3 sides rather than having to layer it.  Reduce cooking time to 45 minutes for perfect results.  

One note - if you remove raisins, remember they are a source of sweetness so you may need to increase sugar.  Just soak the raisins and leave them in there - they are great.

I made this into cupcakes for Easter dinner, rave reviews! Even got asked for the recipe :) This was my first time making carrot cake and this recipe was very good. I adjusted the baking time down to 25 minutes for the cupcakes and they came out just perfectly. Allow them to totally cool before sampling is my best advice. I did not happen to have buttermilk so I just uses 1% milk, seemed to workout just fine, I topped with my own homemade cream cheese frosting, yum!

I did not change anything in this recipe from Grandpa Sam's (and if you changed it, you shouldn't rate it), so I am rating it just as the recipe was  written.  IT IS PERFECT just the way it was submitted.  You don't need to substitute one thing, or tweek it in any way, or add to or subtract from it one bit.  This cake was not soggy moist, or oily, it was not dry, it was just a perfect, perfectly delicious carrot cake.  And it was perfectly  easy to make, too.  So there you have it, this recipe is the one to use.

I've made this multiple times and everyone LOVES it.  However, I do add Allspice (just shake a bit in there, never have measured it) along with cinnamon and omit raisins.  I bake in 2 pans and bake for approx. 30 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.  I also use the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site.  WONDERFUL!!!  Great as cupcakes too!  For those who don't give this 5 stars because of changes (I have made this cake exactly as stated and would still give it a 5).  I just like a little more spice.

I have made this carrot cake many times for Easter, Christmas, and birthday requests, and it always gets rave reviews.  I followed another user's suggestion of simmering the raisins in orange juice then cooling them to plump them up which keeps the cake moist, and I use 3 cups of shredded carrots.  I also add a dash of nutmeg and ground cloves.   I bake it in two 9 in rounds, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap overnight, then frost it with Cream Cheese Frosting II.  It is better than any carrot cake I have ever had at the finest restaurants in town!

This cake is amazing. I've made it with and without the pineapple and it was super delicious either way. I don't add the raisins. So add extra nuts and carrots. 1/2 cup of each.

I've made a lot of carrot cakes and this ranks among the best.  My only change was to boil the raisins in a little juice for softening and to add dried cardemom and ginger. The lady who gave a very negative review pretty much gave this homemade, chunky, yummy version two thumbs up when she said, "I wasted a container of cream cheese frosting on it." If you don't value scratch recipes and love store bought versions, you won't like this one!

By far the most delicious carrot cake I've ever made.
Even the people that don't like carrot cake asked or more!
I see that some alter this recipe but, I don't need to as it makes a perfect cake.
The one thing you don't have to do is add the cream cheese topping; it actually takes away from the flavour.
Use this recipe and you will find that you never need another, ever!

Thank you, Brian and Sam!  This carrot cake recipe is the one of my dreams.  Even though there are a lot of ingredients, somehow this cake came out light, not heavy!
I did boil the raisins in orange juice and then drained as suggested by some.  Otherwise, made as directed.  My daughter's favorite cake.  It's for her birthday tomorrow.
What a wonderful legacy from Sam!  Brian, thanks again for sharing with the world.

carrot cake has always been my favourite and now this recipe is my favourite of the favourites! turned out moist, rose very well and wasnt at all flat. held together just right and didnt crumble. after reading other reviews i used the cream cheese frosting II recipe but with less sugar for a more cream cheese taste. husband was abbbbsolutely bowled over by the well put tkgether flavours of coconut carrot walnut raisin and pineapple. and the cinnamo  was just amazing. folowed the recipe down to a T Except i replaced half a cup of flour with whole meal flour. have used brown in the past for other carrot cakes so couldnt make this one without. turned out absolutely fine. as it would have with all white flour. like others on here i split the cake into 2 tins and then when baked and cool, levelled the top of one and sandwiched together with frosting. gonna be my go to recipe for carrot cake ?

This cake is soooo good! I took one bite and smiled! Used the best ingredients and made a few substitutions: Craisins instead of raisins, toasted Texas pecans instead of walnuts and Organic White Sugar In The Raw, made especially for baking. It's not carrot cake without cream cheese frosting. Used Philadelphia Brand Cream Cheese. Delicious!

Wonderfully moist! This is just the best carrot cake ever.  The only changes I made were to the buttermilk and the raisins.  I used golden delicious raisins.  I love them. Also, I used milk and lemon juice in place of the buttermilk.  I may have gone a little overboard on measuring the nuts, coconut, and raisins. I ended up with extra cake that would not fit in the pans. So I had enough to 1/2 fill a bread pan.  When a friend unexpectedly stopped over, I had a little gift to give her.

Wonderful, easy to make carrot cake. Didn't change a thing in the recipe, but added Cream Cheese Frosting II.

Definitely the best carrot cake I have ever had or made for that matter. They were so good I absolutely had to share with friends, family, and coworkers. Everyone  said the same thing, best carrot cake ever! Seriously addictive. Didn't change a thing about it, turned out perfect.

My healthy boyfriend of 7 months has repeatedly told me that carrot cake is his favorite dessert.  He complains about the ones he's eaten a few times in restaurants with me.  So imagine my stress when I made and served him this as his birthday cake.  His connoisseur's opinion:  "This is the best carrot cake I've eaten in my entire life! It's so moist!"  He's not one for exaggeration, so I'm thinking this recipe made me a rock star!  I made it in 2 layers, precisely equal quantities of batter, 350 for 37 minutes total.

I've made a lot of cakes and my family said this was the best ever.  Even the non carrot cake fans LOVED it.  Everyone wanted leftovers.  I have family and friends asking me to make these all the time.  I did use a food processor to chop up the coconut, nuts and pineapple which made for an incredible texture when it was finished baking.  Thank you very much for posting a wonderful recipe that my family and friends can now enjoy.

I followed the recipe exactly and used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site. (I think it is important to rate the recipe as written.)This cake recipe was great! It was moist but not soggy, and each bite was jammed packed with nuts, coconut, etc. - this works for me because I enjoyed the various textures. Lastly, I made this in a bundt pan because I wanted a more traditional looking cake; it took just over an hour to bake. I decided it was done from checking the sponginess of the cake by pressing on the top; I found the toothpick came out moist although it was done (I might have been inserting it into pineapple bits?).

This is one of the best Carrot Cake I have made and eaten. I subsituted currants for raisins. I have had many compliments on it. For the cream cheese frosting, I used Orange Flavor in place of Vanilla.

What do you do when you have left over vanilla ice cream sitting in your fridge?? I took up this recepie and read through all of the reviews and there was nothing that was stopping me from making it, and the end result, the sweet aroma of the ingredients blended together in a perfect harmony pulled in more people into my kitchen to get a taste of this amazing cake and what do you know!!! It tasted like heaven!! of course I sprinkled powdered cinnamon and sugar on top of the warm cake and served it with a dollop of ice cream... It's finger licking good!! Thanks for sharing the recipe and for all the reviews. I'm making more of this for Christmas.

This has become a favorite in our house; my husband requests this cake every year for his birthday.  I make this into cupcakes and bake for 20 minutes at 350.  Not everyone in my family likes coconut and raisins so I make a few cupcakes without those two items and then add them in before making the rest and it makes everyone happy.

After reading the reviews, I was excited to try this out for the fam. They all liked it however, it was not what I was expecting. It's definitely not your "average" carrot cake. It tasted more like a holiday fruit cake and it was very moist/sticky.  I followed the directions to the T. 
 I thought the pineapples were to keep the cake moist but didn't think I'd still taste much of it after baked. With all that said, it is still yummy. Just less like a traditional carrot cake which is what I wanted.

I made this recipe years ago from a little old Italian lady I worked with named Maria Cassais.  I lost the recipe, and tried today to replicate it from an old Alabama Junior League cookbook, and when it came out of the oven, I was so disappointed.  So I checked and found Sam's Carrot Cake, which is the closest I can come to Maria's recipe.  I mixed it up quickly, and left it in the oven the entire hour, afraid it would fall flat if I didn't.  I just took it out, and it is GORGEOOUS.  Texture perfect, Color perfect, Everything awesome.  Im afraid to frost it, its so awesome looking. Cant wait to cut it and discover the taste.  I used a foil 9 x 13 pan,(as it is a to go situation),  placed on an airfilled cookie sheet, used regular milk in place of the buttermilk, and added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Kitchen smells like an Italian Bakery.  THANK YOU!

I made this first for my sisters birthday and I send in mail across the northeast packed in sarang wrap. She got it in perfect condition and it was super moist and super tasty! I made it few times in between and Again today for work. My friend at work who's an carrot cake lover said it was amazing too! I simmered my raisins in Orange juice and discarded the juice just like one of the reviews. I think that totally took the cakes's texture to a different level! You cannot go wrong with this recipe. I didn't use the walnuts however cause I don't like nuts in my cake but I'm sure it'll be just as amazing with any nuts. I also added 1:3 ratio of nutmeg:cinnamon, instead of 2 tsps of only cinnamon ( cause the hubby is a nutmeg fan!) This is the best carrot cake ever.

Fantastic!
My daughter wanted to make a carrot cake- I didn't think it would tempt me, as I've never cared for carrot cake before; but this is not just any carrot cake.  First, it baked up light and fluffy, not wet and brick-like.  Second, the smell when it was baking was phenomenal- like gingerbread and the best dumpcake had a baby.
I followed the recipe to the letter, and everything, from ingredients to amounts to cooking time, was spot on.
Like others, I topped it with Cream Cheese Frosting II, (from this site) which is richer and less cloyingly sweet than most.  It complimented the cake perfectly.

Great Carrot Cake. I made exactly as recipe stated except I omitted the raisins and realized at the last minute I did not have the pineapple, so I substituted 8 ounces of applesauce and 1 shredded granny smith apple, which worked out wonderful.  I am not a carrot cake fan, but I did eat one small piece and it was really good.  My husband and teen daughter (our carrot cake fans in the house) ate this non stop.  I will make again.

So wonderfully good.  I made a minor substitution and prep adjustment:  I put the coconut, pineapple, and raisins in a blender and added a banana and about 1/3 cup of mini chocolate chips and blended.  Because of the banana, the oil could be cut to 1/4 cup.  I kept everything else the same.  It really came out wonderful.

I made this recipe (multiplied by ten!) for a wedding cake yesterday but omitted the nuts, raisins, and coconut since the bride and groom don't like them.  I also doubled the cinnamon and added nutmeg and ginger.  This was the best carrot cake I've ever made!  Everyone at the wedding came to me raving about it!  Amazing!!!

This is the best carrot cake!  I chang out half the canola oil for coconut oil and also add a 1/4 cup of chia seeds (for extra healthy cake).    I agree with those others who add lemon juice and lemon rind to their cream cheese frosting.   Yummm!

This five star rating is for the cake as written in the recipe, and for being so customizable!

I've tried many different carrot cake recipes, and this one is my favorite. When intended for guests or my husband and son, I follow the directions exactly and it always comes out perfect. Sometimes, I omit the pineapple or coconut according to their tastes. With or without frosting, it always gets rave reviews!

When I make this cake for myself, I make changes due to dietary preferences. I halve the recipe and substitute half the oil for applesauce, use whole wheat flour, reduce the sugar to 100 g (half a cup), 50 g of which is muscovado and omit the pineapple. Sometimes I add orange zest, or use plain yogurt if I have no buttermilk. I bake in an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2" loaf pan for 45 - 50 mins. 

This cake, as it is according to the recipe or with customizations, is the absolute best. Thank you for sharing!

Amazing! I only bake it for 43 minutes, and it comes out perfect! I skip the coconut, simply because I don't care for it. Frost it with the Cream Cheese Frosting II! This is my favorite cake in the whole world!!!!

OMG!!!! I've had some good a$$ carrot cake before but this right here. Perfection!!! I'm talking eyes rolling to the back of your head knee buckling satisfaction with every bite. These rave reviews are redundant and here is another one to add to the collection. I cook a lot and tried several recipes from this site but after trying this one I had to write my first review. This is the first and last carrot cake recipe I'll ever try. Modifications included baking in 2-9 inch pans and 4 cupcakes for 35 mins. Added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, ginger, and allspice and used cream cheese II recipe from site. The raisins were omitted from the cake due to my family's preference but for the 4 cupcakes I added raisins (boiled in OJ then drained). Both were amazing however I liked the cupcakes better because I like raisins.

I usually use the Carrot Cake III recipe but had a yearning to try something different. I did add 2tsp of baking soda to this recipe because I was afraid of it being very heavy and I wanted two layers. I substituted a 12oz jar of Smucker's Pineapple Sundae Topping instead of the crushed pineapple and holy cow that was the best thing ever done to a Carrot Cake, in the history of Carrot Cakes. Omitted raisins and coconut and instead of cinnamon I used 2tsp Badia Five Spice which just brings it all together. I will definitely use this recipe in the future for my base recipe I just have to add my tweaks and the sundae topping has go to be my new favorite.

Other than adding a little bit of ground cloves, I make this recipe exactly as written.  It is wonderful!  Also, I buy off brand ingredients and the last time I served this cake, a guest was saying that it taste so good b/c he knows I use good quality ingredients.  Well, good quality but inexpensive from Aldi's, lol.  Some of the reviews say that they soaked the raisins in orange juice or other things.  But if you try this cake as written, I can't imagine that it could get any better.  Top it with the cream cheese frosting II from this site and its amazing!

This was a wonderful recipe!  I didn't have raisins, so I substituted dried cranberries and was very glad I did. My husband couldn't stop eating it and made me swear to use the cranberries when I make this again.

Delicious cake. I made it just like the recipe said except using pecans instead of walnuts because I didn't have them. I don't think I would change anything about it, really. Great recipe! I topped it with "whipped cream cheese frosting", which was excellent.

We consider ourselves carrot cake freaks.  We are always looking for a new place to try the carrot cake but nothing, anywhere has come close to this.  Hands down this is the best carrot cake we've ever tasted (and we've had a lot).  I made it as noted with the cream cheese icing as recommended by others and it was a perfect match.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  It truly is the best!

This was pretty good.  It was very moist!  It ended up being very bland though.  I swear I could taste the flour and baking soda.  I did by the way, add more spices than it called for too (I added almost a whole Tbs of Pumpkin Pie spice in addition to the other spices) I was glad I did, it might have been inedible if I hadn't.  I made it with the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site (I made it with 1/2 ts. of vanilla extract and 1/2 ts. of orange extract instead of one ts. of vanilla, soooooo good!) and it really helped the flavor.  But my husband and I both liked it a lot despite and will make it again- just with even more spices.  Thanks for the recipe Sam!

This was AMAZING! I was worried that the all the different add-ins would give too many flavors, but it was PERFECT! The pineapple especially made it moist and chewy even after being in the fridge all night. It looked awful when it came out of the oven, I thought it was overbaked, but I guess that's just the outer layer cause the rest is sooooooo so so so good. I will make this forever.

Wonderful carrot cake. Extremely moist and flavorful. I followed this exactly as written, except due to preference I left out the nuts. Topped it with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site, and it was perfect. Thanks Brian

35 minute bake time when using 2 9" round cake pans and it was more than done!!  I omitted the coconut (daughter doesn't like) and added a total of 3 cups of minced carrot.  Although the cake is delicious as made, for those who prefer a bit less of a textured cake you might want to skip the walnuts and/or raisins.  Also, I never add more than 1/4 cup of oil to any recipe, this recipe called for 3/4 cup (yuck)...I subbed 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce and it was divine! Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site was perfect on this cake.  Moister as of day #2.

This is a great recipe!  The only thing missing is a little extra spice...maybe a little more cinnamon or some nutmeg.  But overall it is very good and moist and I will definitely make it again.

I made this carrot cake for Easter.  Believe the reviews.  It is divine! Checked cake about 40 minutes in because I thought 1 hour at the same temperature might dry it out. Lowered over to 325. It turned out perfectly.  Will make again!

I made this recipe exactly as it is and it was by far the best carrot cake anyone in my family has ever had!  I also used the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting from this site and that made it even better!  I will be using this recipe for years to come...Thanks Sam!!!!!

It's hard to rate this cake because the flavor itself was surprisingly good, but everything else was completely off. I originally chose this recipe because the other carrot cake I made from this site came out too dry and crumbly. This one had more wet ingredients and the pineapple sounded yummy. 

I followed the recipe pretty closely and only omitted the raisins and coconut. I baked it for about 45 minutes (I made a smaller amount to fit an 8x8 pan) and it had compacted into a really dense mass. It tasted incredibly wet, too, and at first I thought I hadn't baked it enough, but it didn't taste underdone. It was just so dense and moist that it didn't even feel or taste like a cake at all! I was very disappointed about that, but the taste itself was decent. I could taste more pineapple than I could carrot, but it wasn't bad.

Overall, I'm pretty miffed that this didn't turn out well. I wasted good cake flour and frosting, and it made for a less-than-savory end to my Easter feast.

Totally awesome.  moist, rich, flavourful. Even though the ingredients blended beautifully, we could taste the individual flavours. No hesitation giving this a five star rating.

Husband loved this and my BIL said it was the best he ever had. 
I did take the advice of other reviewers and made a few changes.
I used 1 cup of lactaid milk(lactose intolerant) and 1 teaspoon of lemon instead of the butter milk, added 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg and boiled the raisins in orange juice. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this cake many times exactly as the recipe is. It is the best carrot cake ever!I always make it a day or two before I need it so the flavors can meld. Thank you Sam for sharing!! I would give it a 10 if I could!!!

Diana, I think you may have made the carrots too fine. I just shredded my carrots on a regular hand held grater.Since your cake lacked texture I wonder if it was mixed too long...I stirred by hand just until moistened.hope that helps!

I followed the recipe the first time, but the second time I added a cup of carrots 1 tsp ginger and 1 tsp nutmeg. I would then give it 5 stars...very moist with good flavor.

This is THE BEST carrot cake recipe I have ever tasted.  I omit the raisins because my kids don't like them but either way is fine, just a preference. At first I thought it was strange putting pineapple in the recipe but I went with it and WOW....AMAZING! I get rave reviews every time I make this cake. The only carrot cake recipe I will ever need.

This is it. This is the carrot cake recipe of a lifetime.  I made this tonight (with Cream Cheese Frosting II, recipe on this site), and since this is the first time I have ever made a cake (yes, I'm baking n00b), I can't take credit for it being so delicious.  That's all Sam!  The combination of flavors is perfect - I followed the recipe exactly and made no changes, because it wouldn't be Sam's Carrot Cake if I did. And now, having made it, I would still make no changes.  It doesn't need any. My thanks to your grandfather for passing down this recipe, and to you for providing it to us. :)

Best carrot cake my family and I have had.  I cut the amounts in half for the coconut, walnuts, and pineapple.  My family doesn't like pineapple or coconut but still loves the cake.  I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted with milk 3/4 c. and 1 1/4 tsp. cream of tartar. Frosted cake with a cream cheese icing. Delicious!

I must try this again , as the first time I made it I wanted to make more so I tripled the ingredients and somewhere along the line it ended being a complete flop !  i was so disappointed as I wasted so much. I will try it again but only to follow it exactly. I don't mind bits and pieces of nuts and such. I see that most of the folks that made this cake did good by it.

Heavenly!  I made two changes to this recipe.  I substituted an equal amount of Splenda for the sugar to make the recipe more diabetic-friendly.  And since there were so many other high-carbohydrate ingredients included, I made the recipe into 24 cupcakes which limited the serving size.  But oh, these were so good it was hard to have just one!  I baked the cupcakes for 20-25 minutes, testing with a toothpick to check for doneness.  As a diabetic, I very seldom make desserts of any kind.  But this is certainly one recipe I'll make again.  With the changes I described, each cupcake serving will be about 191 calories and have 18 grams carbohydrate.

Really yummy cake! I substituted coconut sugar for the white sugar (1:1) and coconut oil for the oil. I only had Bob Mills shredded coconut on hand so that's what I used. It doesn't have any added sugar like the regular flaked coconut. I also followed the suggestion of another person who soaked their raisins in hot orange juice before draining and adding to the carrot/coconut/pineapple mixture. The cake turned out wonderful. I'm sure it would be delicious with the listed ingredients, too. 
I didn't add nuts simply because I'm the only one in the house who will eat them, but I do sprinkle toasted pecans over the glaze I made when I tried to make the "whipped cream cheese frosting" recipe suggested by another reviewer. Like others, my frosting came out runny. Instead of tossing it, I pour it over the cake when I serve it and then sprinkle toasted pecans on top of mine. The consistency of the frosting is a lot like creme fraiche but has the taste of a traditional cream cheese frosting. The presentation is very Bon Appetite looking :) My dad is diabetic and thoroughly enjoys the cake without the frosting.

I used to work for a restaurant named J. Alexander's for about 10 years and they have THE BEST CARROT CAKE I've ever had!! When I wanted to make one at home, I couldn't get their recipe because it's top secret!  So, I decided that since I knew a lot of the key ingredients in their carrot cake I would do some searching through all the recipes on here and this is the one that sounded the closest!  Minus the raisins (YUK) this recipe is AMAZING!!!  And it is so very close to tasting just like J.Alexander's.  I also made it with the Cream Cheese Frosting 11 recipe. YUM YUM YUM!!! Anyone that posts something negative about this recipe either has no idea what good carrot cake is supposed to taste like or they did something terribly wrong when they prepared it!  Try this, you won't regret it! You will LOVE it!!!!

I made this recipe into cupcakes for my Mum's 80th birthday celebration and everyone LOVED them. The flavour was great and they were so moist. I made the recipe as written and baked the cupcakes for 30 minutes at 350, then frosted them with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site. There are many carrot cake lovers in my family and they all commented over and over again how good this recipe is. It really is the best. Thank you, Brian!

I've made this cake a couple of years in a row for Easter.  This past year a lady wanted to pay me to make her this cake (I declined but made her the cake anyway).  I do not use raisins and instead of vegetable oil I use extra light virgin olive oil. I put it in a bundt pan and drizzle a simple cream cheese glaze over it.  It is AMAZING!

I substituted unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 of the oil, reduced the total amount of sugar and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. I increased the cinnamon to 3 tsp, added cloves and nutmeg. My family are not fans of frosting, so I used the buttermilk glaze also available on this site under 'Grandma's Carrot Cake'. Yummy!

Only change I made was 1/2 tsp salt instead of 1/4.
Baked in three 8"pans and frosted with the Cream Cheese Frosting from the Awesome Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting recipe.
This is now MY CARROT CAKE RECIPE.
Thanks Sam :-)

One word: wow. I followed the recipe as is and it came out perfect. I wouldn't change anything about it. The cake was not over powered by sweetness and was just the right consistency in moistness and texture. For the frosting I used the "whipped cream cream cheese frosting" by Tom. My husband and coworkers loved it and ate it all up. Thanks!

Our family and friends ADORED this cake! Carrot cake was requested by my son for his birthday party last night. It was light, flakey, and moist with wonderful flavor and pleasing appearance. I omitted the raisins as some of my family and friends at the party don't care for them, used pecans (that's all I had on hand, and my family LOVES them), and substituted 1/4 cup of the oil with unsweetened applesauce. As others suggested, I also made sure to pack the carrots (grated by the larger holes in my grater.) I divided the batter between 3 round cake pans 9 1/2" in diameter with dark non-stick coating and baked them for 30 minutes at 350 degrees then tested with toothpicks in center. They were perfect. This recipe makes enough for 3 ample layers that were just the right thickness. I frosted it with Cream Cheese Frosting II on this site as others suggested. I used 1 1/2 recipes of the frosting as I wanted to make sure I had plenty for decorative piping and had maybe a cup leftover which I stored in the freezer for later use. I'm thinking if we ever had any of this cake left over, or if I made 2 of them, it would probably keep well frosted in the freezer for a while.  Didn't have time to bake it a day ahead as other posters mentioned, but I can't wait to taste it today! Thanks soooo much Sam & Brian!

Love this recipe.  Have made it several times and dont change anything unless I dont have buttermilk.  I then make sour milk using milk and vinegar.  This recipe doubles well.

OMG!!! This recipe is the bomb. I have used it several times for small and big occasions and it is always a hit with endless compliments.  I will be using this recipe again for my sister's bridal shower and this time as cupcakes instead of a cake.  The cake is always moist and incredibly delicious and even better after a few days. If you follow the recipe you can't go wrong.

I have made this recipe twice and everyone who tried it loved it!  The flavor is fabulous!  It is excellent with or without icing.  I love how moist this one is and I baked it in a 13 x 9 inch pan and adjusted the baking time checking doneness with a toothpick.

Hands down - best carrot cake that I have ever tasted! I loved that it had everything (coconut, walnuts, raisins and pineapple) so I didn't have to decide which to use.  It was a little labor intensive, but really worth it! Next time I may buy the pre-shredded carrots. I tried another reviewers tip about soaking the raisins in OJ and then bringing to a boil.  It brought a light citrus flavor to the cake that was really delicious. I topped off the cake with an amazing cream cheese frosting.  Thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe!

Super good! I may be a little young to bake, but my family loved the carrot cake! My little two year old sister was a big help to me. All that shredding carrots was worth it! I made the carrot cake special for my dad. We never had any recipes that our dad liked. It was always chocolate, my mom's favorite. But, Mom loved it too! I think it was a big hit!

This cake was AMAZING. My husband and two boys absolutely LOVED it.  I made a three layered cake and used pecan pieces instead of walnuts, because that's what I had on hand.  Because of the ingredients, this cake takes much longer to make, than perhaps others on this site, but it is so worth the extra effort.  I deleted all other carrot cake recipes from my recipe box!  For frosting, I used the "Cream Cheese Frosting II" recipe on this site.

This was my first ever attempt at carrot cake from scratch, I'm embarrassed to say. This turned out fantastic despite my  quirky oven here in Argentina . I added the nutmeg too and used a cream cheese frosting recipe from this site. I have sent the remainder to work with my husband today, the guys in his office love treats. I haven't seen carrot cake here yet so I'm curious what they will think of it. I will add this to one of my favorites though.

I made this carrot cake for my four year old daughter, who loves carrot cake! The cake is great-- it tastes different yet better than store bought carrot cakes I have had. I made cupcakes instead of a whole cake and cooked them at the the same temp, just for half the time. They came out perfect. I also didn't have any buttermilk so I used vanilla yogurt with a splash of milk instead, which has a tangy flavor like buttermilk does.

My grandson and I made this for his dad's birthday - only cake Jason likes is carrot cake. My daughter and her husband both said this carrot cake is the best they have ever had - even better than the local cake shop! My daughter has gestational diabetes and said she even traded a small piece of cake for a meal a couple of times! That is high praise indeed!

This cake is VERY good!!! Only problem is that it doesn't taste anything like carrots!!! It's almost like a mixture of banana bread and pumpkin bars with the walnuts and cream cheese frosting. It would have gotten a 5 star rating if it was supposed to be a spice cake, which is what it tastes like.

I made this for Easter.  It's my brother-in-law's favorite cake.  It was absolutely delicious.  When I asked if I should keep this recipe in my repertoire everyone said YES.  One of my sisters did suggest that I cut the amount of raisins in half.

Great recipe, I made some slight changes. I added in another half cup of carrots, plumped my raisins in lemon juice before adding and only used half cup. I also reduced the walnuts to half. Added in lemon zest and reduced the oil by substituting it with applesauce.I added in some freshly grated nutmeg too. My husband who is a big fan of carrot cakes loved it and has asked for this cake for his birthday. My co-workers were also huge fans. Thanks for a great recipe!

Wonderful!  Made it into cupcakes for Easter. (I omitted the walnuts and I was out of vanilla. So, I used 1.5 tsp Rum Extract and 1/2 tsp almond extract and added a little bit of nutmeg to make it more like a spice cake to cover the fact that I didn't use vanilla.) Very moist and flavorful.  My father-in-law loved the addition of the coconut.  I will be making again!

Topped it with a cream cheese icing (2 pkgs cream cheese, 1 stick butter, 1 Tbs lemon juice concentrate, 2 cups powder sugar)  Yumm!!

I checked the reviews for several carrot cake recipes and chose this one because it had the highest rating. It lived up to the hype. It was so moist and the coconut, pineapple, and raisins added such a great flavor and texture. I didn't add the walnuts since no one in my family likes them and it was still fantastic! I would definitely recommend this recipe!

This recipe was very good; however, after reading all of the previous reviews I was expecting a slice of heaven, and it just wasn't that.  I followed the recipe exactly, and find it just a little bland.  I think I prefer cakes with butter vs oil to make them a little richer.  Still, overall very good- my husband loves it- but adding a thick layer of icing is definitely necessary.

Everyone said it was the best carrot cake they've ever had - super fluffy & light!  I omitted the raisins (just not a fan) and added 1/2 cup carrots.  I used a basic cream cheese buttercream frosting.  I will definitely replace my current carrot cake recipe with this one.

Made this minus the raisins only in a 9 x 13 pan and used orange cream cheese frosting from this site.  I didn't get to try a piece because everyone at the function I brought it to raved about it and didn't save me a piece!

This definitely deserves it's five stars. Very delicious and moist. Followed the recipe exactly and made 12 cupcakes (cooking at 350 degrees for 25mins) and also had enough batter for a rectangular pan but don't have the dimensions on hand - that took about 40mins to bake that. I used my food processor to shred the carrots so it was super easy. Also used the food processor for the walnuts until they were super fine because my husband and I like the flavor of walnuts but don't like to have chunky pieces when it comes to cakes - just a personal preference. Did the same with the coconut. I also boiled the raisins in orange/pineapple juice (didn't have just plain OJ)  first, per advice from another reviewer. This recipe is a keeper. I was thinking of trying other carrot cake recipes from this site but I really may not need to.  Did I already say it was delicious? :-)

Honestly, this has to be the best carrot cake I've ever had, and my first one made. I made it for my husbands birthday and everyone said it was the best they have ever had! It was so moist and full of flavor. I LOVE this recipe. I made it exactly as it said putting the batter in two 8 inch round cake pans. It was so simple to make and tastes amazing!

I've made this recipe as written, it is excellent. I wanted to try a "healthier version" so I used half oil, half apple butter (applesauce would work just as well). Reduced sugar to 1-cup and used half brown, half white. Skipped the walnuts and raisins, but added an extra cup of carrot and an extra handful of coconut. And I also added a dash of nutmeg. AWESOME!!! Not too sweet, perfect for breakfast, soooo moist & delicious!! :)

My husband, who is not really a carrot cake fan, said this was the best cake I have ever made. I would have to agree and I have made a lot of tasty cakes in my day. Couldn't stop eating it so if you're on a diet, you probably shouldn't try it. If anyone gave it a bad review, they probably didn't mix it right, or bake it right. I went by the recipe with no changes. Perfect as written. Gets better and better each day.

Best carrot cake I have ever had.  I thought there might be too much going on in this cake, but I was wrong.  Everyone loved it! It is a really expensive cake to make, but it is worth it.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I made the cream cheese frosting II from this site as many others did and I would suggest doing that to anyone making the cake.  I decorated it with some chopped nuts.  It was great!

We make this as a 3-layer cake. In our oven it takes about 25 minutes to bake. We've made it several times since we found this recipe. FABULOUS!

WELL after reading all the good recommendations and it is the BEST cake EVER, I decided to make this cake.Got all the ingredients, watched the video- I was ready. followed the recipe as it is did not add or omit anything. The moment of truth came got my fork and tasted it expecting my taste buds to explode after that bite.... nothing happened I was maybe the second bite maybe I just ate it to Fast !! NO, it is a total disappointment. It does not have a distinct taste rather a blend of many textures. It is oily and just does not taste as what you anticipate from the Thousand Like. Honestly a very basic carrot cake would be more suitable if you are looking for a carrot cake, there I said it. Sorry Uncle Sam may Your soul rest in peace but your cake only deserves two stars no more (thats MY OPINION)

So gooooood! Made exactly to recipe...just added a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.  Just a tip for the walnuts: blanch them for about a minute (before chopping) to get rid of any bitterness in their skin.  I made cupcakes instead of a cake, so used a bake time of 25 minutes @ 350 degrees F.  I topped with cream cheese icing, of course (1 brick cream cheese, 2 cups icing sugar, 1/2 cup soft butter, 2 teaspoons vanilla, and a dash of almond flavour and some cream to loosen to desired consistency)!  High five to Sam!

I first made it as per the recipe posted.  FANTASTIC!!!  Then I doubled it and added Allspice[I LOVE Allspice] to it. 2 teaspoons[to a double recipe] and made 36 cupcakes from it. I also added Allspice to the cream Cheese frosting.  The adults were fighting the kids over it.  Poor kids.  Guess I will have to make more next time.  A REAL WINNER!!!!

Best recipe ever.  Like others, I tailor it to my own liking as I do with almost any recipe because I am picky.  But this recipe gave me all of the tools necessary to make it great.  My family really loved it as well, and not many of them actually like carrot cake.  

I paired it with a whipped cream cheese frosting because I tend to like lighter frostings.  

The only changes I made was leaving out the raisins, and swapping pecans for walnuts due to an allergy issue.

Mixed reviews- some of the family really loved this-said it was the best carrot cake they have ever had.  Others just thought it was ok.  Carrot cake is not their favorite to be fair.  I added a little nutmeg, ran the pineapple, carrots and coconut through a processor, used finely crushed walnuts and boiled the raisins in orange juice prior to baking.  Edit 3/13- The family that loved this brought it up on Easter- disappointed that I didn't make it for Easter!  Turns out they say it was the best carrot cake they had ever had!  Will certainly make again with the above mentioned changes.

I made two of these and everyone loved them. I had a group that likes nuts and raisins and a group that doesn't so I did two. I did add a little nutmeg and cloves like others had said and was extremely happy. Will make again!

Wonderful!!! Thank you for sharing this recipe.  My 8 year old daughter informed me that "this carrot cake I'll eat ... all of it"  Only left out the walnuts.  Soaked raisins before putting in so they are moist.

Fantastic cake, among the very best of all carrot cakes. I used golden raisins instead of black, and pecans rather than walnuts as I prefer them. Completely wowed by this cake.

This is absolutely the best carrot cake I've ever had in my life.  I have made it several times (I'm the Birthday cake lady at my work); once as a normal layer cake, once as cupcakes and once as a sheet cake - doubling the recipe.  I it always came out perfect.  I only modified a few minor things: I used golden raisins the 2nd time, much better; used a whipped cream, cream cheese from this site; and added cinnamon/sugar - candy coated walnuts and/or pecans and sprinkled on top of the frosting.  Amazing!!  The batter is very run, but have faith it has enough flour - moist cake I've made to date.  Way to go SAM!!

This was a good, moist carrot cake.  I left out the raisins since I didn't have any, and I am not sure I'd have added them even if I had.

Everyone raved about my carrot cake when I made 3 batches of this accompanied with cream cheese topping for a house party. They were all gone! 

Some changes I made, I reduce the sugar by half cup. And as for the baking soda, I left them until the end, where after I prepared the batter, I sifted the baking soda, and added 1 tsp of vinegar, let it bubble and add them immediately to the batter. The batter felt so light, I baked them immediately and got a beautifully fluffy and moist carrot cake. This recipe is a keeper!

Wow Sam. Like Katie Holmes of Tom Cruise, I had high expectations of you. And like Katie was with Tom, I was very disappointed with you. As written, you were bland and very unremarkable. So like Katie did with Tom, I will be ending it now and taking my carrots elsewhere ;)

This is the best carrot cake.  Ever.  It was absolutely delicious, tender, moist, spicy, and perfectly perfect.  I will make this one again.  And again.  And again.  I took the advice of a previous reviewer and boiled the raisins in orange juice prior to adding them to the batter.  This carrot cake is famous in our house!!!

The best carrot cake ever!  I have made this numerous times and everyone raves about it every time.  I will never even try another recipe!  This doesn't need to be touched...it's perfect!  Be sure to use a nice, mild cream cheese icing recipe though...not one that's too sweet and you will not be able to beat this one.

I tried this recipe and my co-workers loved it.  I measured all the fruit and dry ingredients the night before and put them in the refrigerater in airtight containers.  The next morning, I made my own buttermilk from soy milk and 1 tablespoon of vinegar, measured the sugar, oil and cracked the eggs. The cake had finished cooking just before it was time for me to go to work. It was still warm and ready to be eaten with a cup of coffee.

It was good, but not great. Tasted just like every other carrot cake you eat. I was hoping that the pineapple and coconut would make it more unique, but it wasn't. I'm not saying it was bad, in fact I liked the coconut in it a lot! But if you're looking to impress, this probably won't do.

I followed this recipe ALMOST exactly. The ONLY thing I did differently was separate the egg yolks from egg whites. I beat the egg whites into stiff peaks and folded them in at the very end right before baking this cake in two 9-inch rounds for 45 minutes!

I also found and used "baking raisins," which were more moist than typical raisins. The end result was an incredibly moist and flavorful cake. My mom LOVED it! I made this with the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe on this site. Absolutely perfect!

If you like your carrot cake fully loaded, dense, & rich then you will like this one. I baked it in a 9x13 pan for about 40 min resulting in something more like bars than cake. Tasted great with a cream cheese frosting.

Fabulous cake.  I altered it because I was looking for a use for carrot pulp from a juicer.  I subbed 3 c of carrot pulp, deleted the coconut, used 1 cup buttermilk, a little extra sugar, 4 eggs, a 1/2 tsp of baking powder and plumped the raisins in hot water and drained them.  Delicious.

Oh my goodness! This was sooooo good. I will probably try 1 cup of sugar next time, though. It was very sweet, and we could do with less just fine. I did the milk + vinegar substitute for the buttermilk.

I was nervous about whether my family would like all the coconut and pineapple and stuff, but they loved this!*  So good with Cream Cheese Frosting II.  

* With the exception of the 4-year-old daughter who thinks all dessert should be chocolate.

This is the first carrot cake I ever tried to make and THE LAST! I LOVE it, made it for Easter dinner and my family LOVED it! Thank you so much for sharing your family recipe with the world!  I took some advice that I read and used 3 cups of carrots instead of using coconut, since some of my family aren't fans.  Turned out FABULOUS!

It is a great recipe.  I've seen this and versions of it in many publications.  The trouble with recipes is that many people claim them as their own...some cooks couldn't even be bothered to change up the ingredients.

I have to admit that I HATE carrot cake, and this was no exception.  But, I made it for my husband's birthday because his absolute favorite cake is carrot cake.  I followed the recipe (using the food processor), and did everything as directed except for the nuts--my husband asked me not to use nuts.  He really loved it, as did our friends who ate the cake.  As for me... Well, I got tiramisu to-go from the restaurant where we ate dinner.

I teetered between 4 and 5 (I wish there was 1/2 stars) only because this didn't have the strongest carrot flavor, maybe decreased a little because of the mix of all the fruits included but nonetheless it was very good. I did add nutmeg and simmered the raisins in OJ as another reviewer suggested. I may try food processing some of the ingredirents next time for a more melded flavor instead of getting different bites of fruit on each bite. It made 2 thin 9 inch rounds and 12 cupcakes. I used the cream cheese II frosting recipe from this site but also added a 1/2tsp of almond extract which was awesome. Very delicious and I've been asked to share the recipe.

This was a really great carrot cake. Unfortunately, because of food allergies in the family, I had to make it without the walnuts, and I think that affects the flavor. The cake is incredibly moist and rather sweet, and quite, quite good.

Fantastic recipe! Moist, dense and delicious. Not too sweet and just right. It baked only for 40 minutes so be sure to watch it carefully. I did omit the coconut (didn't have any on hand) and I replaced with it with more carrots. Next time I think I will add a few more spices as it seems a little tame for my taste but overall, a definite keeper. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for Easter. Best carrot cake I've ever made. Even my husband, who's not a huge carrot cake fan, liked it. I only made one small change. I omitted the walnuts. No one in my family is a fan of nuts in baked goods, especially walnuts. As others suggested, I used the cream cheese II frosting recipe to top this off. The entire cake was perfect. Thanks for sharing your grandfather's recipe!

This is the first  cake I've ever baked from scratch...it came out perfect...my wife loved it! Said this recipe is "a keeper"
I subsituted pecans for the walnuts and used Pamels's Gluten free baking flour, since my wife is gluten intolerant...but it worked fine and I think the pecans give it a better flavor.

I let my daughter lick the beaters, she cried when she licked the last of the batter off! I agree the batter was so good. I have not yet tried a whole peice of cake but the corner i swiped while the family wasn't looking was great.
Frosted with basic cream cheese frosting 2 from this site. Thanks for sharing so yummie.

I made this for Easter 2012 and it was a HIT!  I made 2 batches.  One for work (made 35 cupcakes) and one for the family dinner (9 inch round layer cake).  I also used the cream cheese frosting II and it was PERFECT!  I did squeeze the juice out of the pineapple first and soaked the raisins in the juice for a few hours.  It was PLENTY moist and everyone LOVED IT!  This recipe is going to be in my recipe folder FOREVER!  Yum yum yum!

To. Die. For.  That is all I need to say.  I used Cream Cheese Frosting II, and left out the nuts (not a nut person) and it was absolutely heavenly.  I will make this again and again!

There is a reason that more than 64000 people have saved this receipe....BECAUSE IT'S AMAZING!!!  The only thing I changed was to only put two small children's sized boxes of raisins because of preference.  It was a hit on Easter and I will be making this A LOT!!!

I made this recipe for Easter and it was perfect in every way.  I used the Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting from allrecipes which was also the best frosting ever.

Made the recipe but used a 1/4 oil and half cup applesauce instead of the 3/4 cup oil. Other than that we stuck to the recipes and my husband loved it. This one is a keeper. 
*Made a cream cheese frosting using a stick of 1 stick of real sweet cream butter, 8 oz pkg of cream cheese, 2 cups powdered sugar, and 2 tsps vanilla extract.

I made this for Easter 2012 and got RAVE reviews! Everyone said it was the absolute best carrot cake they had ever had. I omitted the walnuts and the coconut. I also swapped applesauce for the oil. You couldn't even taste the pineapple, but it made the cake incredibly moist, and the raisins were delicious in it. I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site and the entire cake was nearly gone by the end of the day. I made it the night before and kept it in the fridge over night. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

It turned out really well. I made it exactly as the recipe said.  I did have to cut the bake time down to about 45 minutes for a dark non-stick coated metal 9x13 pan. (I have a new oven and haven't checked it- it may run hot). I used half a recipe for the cream cheese II frosting from this website. It's good cold the next day (kept in fridge due to cream cheese frosting)

Look for no other carrot cake recipe. Add the Cream cheese frosting II recipe to it and you have a winning combo. Thanks for posting your recipe. First time I made it was yesterday and it came out perfect!

Absolutely the best carrot cake ever! Prepared as cupcakes (bakes 25 mins.) for Easter with coconut and mini chocolate eggs on top of cream cheese frosting. Next time will serve warm with a dollop of shipped cream. DEEEE-licious!

I liked it, but I was the only one that did.  I guess it was too dense for some tastes.  The family said it had too much coconut. (I only put half of what it called for.)  Guess I'll have to go back to my old carrot cake recipe.

I've been eyeing this recipe for a few weeks now because I'm such a carrot cake fan. I followed the recipe exactly as it was laid out (the only thing I changed was the baking pan and of course the baking time). I was so excited and watched it bake in the oven. I was not disappointed at all from the first bite. It's so moist and flavourful. My family loves it and I soon will be making more. I topped it with the cream cheese frosting II and it was a match made in heaven. Thank you for this recipe!

This was my first try at carrot cake.  I made it for my mother's birthday...Mom likes carrot cake but nobody else in my family does.  Not only did my mom say it was the best carrot cake she's ever had, but my 3 brothers and step-dad raved about it as well.  This is a must-try recipe!  I omitted the raisins and walnuts (had none) and coconut (Mom hates it).  I increased the carrots about a quarter cup and baked it in two 9" cake pans, it was done in about 40 mins.  After icing with a cream cheese frosting, I lined the top with sliced, toasted almonds.  I did that for the presentation but they really complemented the flavor of the cake - too bad I didn't cover the whole cake with them (or use walnuts!)  Even with the changes, it came out awesome.  Thank you for the outstanding recipe.

This season I ended up with a lots of carrots from my garden so I needed agressively start using them.My first carrot cake ever and it turned out wonderful. I created healthier virgin by using 1/3 cup veg. oil and one mashed banana, 4 cups carrots, didn't have any raisins so substituted it for chopped dried apricots Baked the cake in two 9" round pans for 30 min. For the cream cheese frosting II I used fat free cream cheese and 11/2 cups sugar instead of two cups. My family doesn't like cakes too sweet. If you preffer sweeter frosting keep tasting the frosting until desired sweetness. This will be my primary recipe for carrot cake in the future.

Love it! I chose this recipe because I happened to have all the extra stuff that go into it (coconut, walnuts, raisins and pineapple). I didn't have enough raisins so I added some dried cranberries and it worked fine. I soaked raisins and cranberries in a mixture of hot water and brandy first. Something I learned from making a French fruitcake. The best part of the cake is the top crust so I'll be baking this in a 9x13 next time. :)

I really like this carrot cake and was expecting it would fly off the plate at our family dinner--but it didn't. I think everyone was too full for dessert after the spaghetti and meatball dinner. But I wouldn't hesitate to make this cake again. I decorated it with slight shavings of carrots and coconut. It was really pretty too!

Best carrot cake that I've EVER had. I followed the recipe exactly (which was super super easy) and it came out perfect! 
I recently made this as a wedding cake with cream cheese icing. When the bride and groom cut and ate some, the bride's reaction was "WOW, THIS IS GOOD!!!" with her mouth full and everything! =] Thank you, Sam for sharing your carrot cake recipe.

Awesome cake!  I added fresh lemmon zest to the carrot mixture and I boiled the rasins in spiced rum and brown sugar.  This is the second time in a week period that I am making this cake.  Sam would be proud!

Wow! Best carrot cake ever! Tastes great frosted or unfrosted. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. Next time I will try reducing some of the oil and replacing with applesauce.

I made this cake as muffins and topped it off with a cream cheese frosting. I think it had a bit too much "stuff" in it for my taste. Next time, I'll omit the nuts and probably the coconut. Also, I'll be sure to grate the carrots a bit finer than I did this time. Worth taking another crack at it in the future...

I, too, love this cake!!! I poked the cake, then poured a hot vanilla sauce  right after I took it out of the oven. Then let it cool before icing it with my favorite Caramel Icing!!! What a nice touch instead of the usual Cream Cheese Icing!

I added a couple of dashes of nutmeg to the recipe and split the batter into three 8" round pans. I frosted the layers with cream cheese icing and it was amazing. Everyone at my office pot luck loved it. Will make again.

I make this cake regularly for the local auction that I cater weekly.  It gets rave reviews, and I have been told many many times that it's the best carrot cake ever.  My fiance doesn't generally like carrot cake, but loves this one.  I follow the recipe because it's fantastic, but I soak the raisins in the pineapple juice and fyi...be sure to squeeze some of the juice out of the shredded carrots (if you shred your own), otherwise it's too wet....and besides, you won't believe how delicious fresh carrot juice is!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.....it's truly a keeper!!!

Nothing but raves from family members when they tried this cake, even people who profess they do not eat "carrot cake", loved it.  

Simple to make, very moist and sweet.

What do you do with 10lbs of carrots from the Costco? Make cake. The first time I made this I forgot to add the eggs. It was still great. Today I remembered them and added 1T fresh grated ginger and 1t dried. yum.

This is the best carrot cake I have ever had.  The only thing I did different was omit the raisins because I am not a fan of raisins in cake.  AND I had to make my own buttermilk substitution using milk and lemon juice.   I think the crushed pineapple just makes the cake over the top!

This was the second carrot cake recipe I tried.  It is now my (and my co-workers) favorite!  I did add about a half teaspoon of allspice, cut the sugar down to about 1 1/4 cups and omitted the walnuts and raisins (just because I don't care for them).  

The first recipe I tried does not call for sifting the flour and other ingredients and does not have buttermilk in it.  I don't know if this is what helped the cake, but I certainly got more rave reviews with this recipe and the fact that the entire 13 x 9 cake was devoured by my co-workers says it all!  

Finally, as another review mentioned, this cake does taste better over the next day or two.  I had made two cupcakes as well, just so I could taste it before bringing the cake into work, and I noticed how much better it tasted the second day vs. the first.

I tried the mixture of carrots, coconut, walnuts, pineaple and raisins and it was fantastic on its own. (I did try another reviewer's tip and cooked the raisins in OJ first).That would make a yummy cold salad!

This carrot cake recipe is perfection.
It was incredibly moist and flavorful.
Made with Cream Cheese II frosting from this site.
Also omitted the raisins, just because I don't care for them, but I'm sure they make it even more authentic. Thank you!

The ONLY  reason I am giving this 4 stars and not 5 is because I changed it a bit, so I don't feel like I can honestly give it a 5 since I did not make it as written. 
All that said, I LOVE this!!  My grandmother made a killer carrot cake, and this taste like I remember hers tasting.  Moist, sweet but not too sweet, pineapple and crasins (one of the things I changed)......YUMMY! Took to a gathering and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. This will be my "go to" carrot cake for forever more. :)

I brought this cake to a potluck and got super rave reviews like: "the BOMB!" or "the BEST carrot cake I've eaten" or "SCORE!" which was fantastic. I made a double batch and poured the batter in 9 inch round pans plus a couple mini loaf pans. The timing was about right, but I kept checking the pans just in case. I have a new favorite.

I'm giving this recipe 2 stars because I baked as cupcakes for 30mins and they were way under baked. I wouldn't add the pineapple or the juice if I were to make these again because I couldn't taste the pineapple and the juice was just too much liquid for the batter.

I made this for our girls night out and let me tell you, WOW!  Moist and flavorful. Everyone loved it and took some home for their husbands.  The only thing I did differently, I soaked the raisins in 3 tablespoons orange juice.  Then I added 1 teaspoon of lemon peel and juice for the cream cheese frosting.  Next time I am going to try pineapple juice and crushed pineapple.

I made this recipe into 3 different sizes of copcakes. They all turned out amazing. I'm not fond of frosting so I didn't use any. I've also made this using splenda and it still comes out great. Everyone that's tried them wants the recipe.

Hearty, even without the nuts.  Did a frosting on top with 8 oz cream cheese, 4 Tlbs butter and 3 C powdered sugar - which was pretty good!  Would like to try with some nuts, would probably cut back on the coconut.

We don't do carrot cake in Poland and the sheer thought of having a veg in my cake was repelling to me. My sister really wanted to try carrot cake though, so I decided to make her this one for her nameday, since it had so many rave reviews. IT WAS DELICIOUS! I couldn't believe it. We all thought it was the best cake we'd eaten in months. Moist, sweet, fruity... and didn't taste like carrot :) Will be making another one tomorrow! I will try to substitute some of the needed oil with extra buttermilk or pineapple juice to cut down a little on the fat content (so we can eat more, LOL).

I made this for my mom for her birthday and it was honestly the BEST carrot cake we've had!  I omitted the coconut and added an extra tsp of cinnamon but the recipe rocks on its own.  Thank you for sharing this...it's now the only carrot cake recipe I will ever use!

This is a very dense cake. Even with the raisins, walnuts, and coconut taken out of the recipe, the juice from the pineapple and the moisture from the carrots made it a little too "wet".

O M G!!! This was so fantastic that it made me look like a baking genius! 100% best carrot cake of all time! Everyone loved it and I am not a big raisin fan yet it was still a little slice of heaven. I followed every step to the T I even shredded the carrots with a potato peeler. It took about 4 or 5 out of the package they weren't very big carrots. Anyway thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Excellent recipe...didn't have pineapple so I used fresh mangoe chunks with orange juice substitued for the pineapple juice and it was fabulous.  These would be great in muffin cups for breakfast even without the iceing.  I also added 1/4 teas. nutmeg.

PHENOMENAL CARROT CAKE; both taste and smell are to die for. I followed the recipe exactly but made individual cakes in both regular and mini muffin tins to bring to a party. They were perfectly moist. I topped the cakes with cream cheese icing and they were a hit. I will never use another carrot cake recipe--this one is perfect.

I don't like carrot cake, personally, but the reaction I got from the friend I made this for  made me wish I did.  There's just too much "stuff" in it for my liking.  I made this for a friend that just loves carrot cake and her husband, who I refer to as a carrot cake connoisseur.  They just LOVED it, said it was the best they'd ever had.  I didn't change anything about the recipe, just made it as is.

I made this cake as written for my husband's birthday, and used the cream cheese frosting II from this website.  (2pks cream cheese, 1/2C butter, 2 cups powdered sugar, and vanilla) everyone who ate it said it was the best cake they had ever eaten.  My husband wanted to come on here and review it as the best dessert ever!  He never even liked cake until he tried this cake.  I wish I could give it 20 stars!

Fantastic, took this to work and was told by multiple people that it was the best carrot cake they ever tasted.  Only made a few changes.  I like more spice in my carrot cake, so I used 3 tsp of cinnamon, and 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  As suggested by another reviewer, I boiled the raisins in orange juice, and they were delicious.  (I'm going to remember that trick...thanks!)  I also splurged on the "mix-ins" adding heaping cups of carrots, raisins, nuts etc. instead of carefully measured ones.  The cake held together nicely.  I topped it with the cream cheese frosting II (2-8oz. cream cheese, 1/2 cup butter, vanilla, and 2cups powdered sugar).  It was fabulous.  I will make this over and over.

This turned out quite well. The only issue I had with it was the lack of salt. Next time I would increase the salt to 3/4-1 tsp.

I baked this twice. The first time I used evaporated milk and 1.5 sugar. It was a little chewy for my taste, but still delicious. The second time I used buttermilk and increased sugar to 2 cups. Aaaah perfection. Thanks so much for this amazing recipe. I baked it for my daughters teacher and she said "best carrot cake she ever tasted". Goes great with creme cheese II from this site. Thanks again.

I love carrot cake so was excited to make this due to the high ratings but was very disappointed.  Maybe I did something wrong, but it was very dense and chunky;  too much texture, mostly from the crushed pineapple.  I made this for a large gathering at Easter and less than 1/2 got eaten.

Omited raisins but otherwise followed recipe and got rave reviews from my family.  Frosted with Cream Cheese Frosting II.  I am getting ready to make this cake for another birthday party - serving over 50 people this time. :)

i used everything according to the recipe. Although, I just dumped everything into my kitchen aid & mixed for 1.5minutes rather than all the other instructions.  TURNED OUT FANTASTIC! it's a winner & i will bake it every Easter!

Icing: 1.5 blocks of cream cheese
1 stick of butter
3/4 c of powdered sugar (add more until it tastes good to you)

Thank you so much for the recipe. This was the first cake I've ever made completely from scratch and it turned out beautifully!!! My family absolutely loved it and my fiance said "no bs, this is the best carrot cake I've ever had"!! Made my day, thanks for sharing! Oh and I made the cream cheese icing recipe by Jenni from this site and it was delicious!

This was great!  I'm not usually a carrot cake person but some family members do like it so I decided to make it for Easter.  I followed it pretty much to a T except I omitted the raisins for personal preference.  I also used 2 9" round pans and baked for only 30 minutes.  It came out so moist, and it was super easy to make.  I made a cream cheese frosting with vanilla and almond extract that really complemented the cake.    This didn't last long!

Delicious: I may have overbaked it a bit, but it still turned out perfect! (And next time it will be even better since I'll use parchment paper!)  With cream cheese frosting, it's an instant classic.

This was just ok, wasn't the best, needed a little more something, maybe some nutmeg and cloves.  Baked it in a 9x13, 8x12 just seemed too small.  Baked for 45 mins.

I was expecting a really good carrot cake but I ended up with a cake that was very bland. I followed the recipe except I left out the raisins. This cake needed more flavor.

Great cake, just needs to be a tiny bit sweeter.  I loved how it was filled with so much--nuts, coconut, pineapple, raisins.  It was slightly dense, but light and yummy at the same time.  The second time I made it I added 1/4 cup more sugar and it was perfect.

My husband loves carrot cake and said this was one of the best he's ever had!   I only upped the cinnamon a bit and threw in a dash of nutmeg. I made three layers in 8" pans.  Used the first reviewer's cream cheese/butter icing recipe and had plenty.  This is a perfect recipe and pretty foolproof!

Just Perfect..In my opinion...I loved it, however, my husband mentioned that its like a sponge cake instead of a "cake" so he was not as thrilled.  I do see what he means as the consistency is not flaky or crumbly as a cake.  He loves the Bakers Square carrot cake, which I cant stand.  I did drain the pineapple and carrots and did not include coconut flakes since I really dont like them.  I will make this again (for me & kids:) Do use the cream cheese II from this site.  Soo good

Ok..I had a request from my step father to make him a carrot cake (which I hate). I agreed and found this recipe. After I made it, of course I HAVE to try everything I make whether I like it or not..Turn out, I loved it and I hate carrot cake. Everyone else who had a piece loved it too! So great! Thank you for sharing this recipe with us!!

Excellent!  I don't even like sweets that much.  I did have to take it out of the oven after 40 minutes but I baked it in 8 inch pans.  It was wonderfully moist and not too sweet.  P.S.  I didn't have any raisins or coconut and it was still the best carrot cake that ever came outta my oven.

I have made my mom multiple carrot cakes for her birthday, and this by FAR, has been the best! Super moist cake. I couldn't find buttermilk, so I used Sweetened condensed milk and mixed this with 2% milk. Turned out great! Enjoy :)

This recipe is good. Next time I will replace the oil with butter... it's a little blah with the oil. I used toasted pecans in place of the walnuts and left out the raisins. I made 24 cupcakes and frosted them with cinnamon cream cheese frosting. The frosting makes up for the blah this time....but next time... BUTTER!

Truly the best carrot cake ever!  Thank you for sharing this, it is my go-to carrot cake recipe.

I first made this recipe as cupcakes baking them for 20 minutes.  I filled the cupcakes with caramel filling and frosted with cream cheese frosting.  SO RICH!

The second time as a cake, two 9" rounds with Creamy Frosting by Carol on this site for a family reunion vacation.  Everyone raved - especially the men who said it was a hearty cake, not too sweet and ate it for breakfast the next day.  haha 

My husband doesn't like cream cheese frosting.  The Creamy Frosting by Carol on this site works well with this cake if you like a frosting that isn't too sweet.

Simply THE BEST carrot cake I have EVER had, and believe me... I've had many (it's my favorite cake). I was apprehensive about the coconut, but the flavor is subtle and delicious. I made them as cupcakes, and thought they were so moist that I skipped the icing (rationale being; save the calories so I can eat more cake).
UPDATE: I just realized that I forgot the raisins! I'm so in love with them without, I think I'll purposefully pass in the future.

I was hoping to see more people talk about the amount of batter and size of pans..  I used a  9X13
pan and the batter was so high,I took some out into an additional 8X8 pan.  But the cake did not rise very high -- maybe I should have left the whole thing in the 9X13 pan...  I don't like the soda so I replaced it with baking powder.  Soaked the raisins in the pineapple juice.  Used yogurt instead of the buttermilk.  The cake was moist and dense, great taste -- not mushy.. Will try again with one pan and what happens with all that batter.

Very moist cake, but my family still likes my old recipe better.  They are not used to having pineapple or other things added to the batter.  I will try again, and leave out all the extras, because my recipe does not have buttermilk, and I think it might make it more moist.

Great recipe.  Followed it exactly, except I used cake flour.  Worked fine.  Made 18 cupcakes, baked for 20 minutes.  Made Cream Cheese Frosting II, everyone raved.

The reviews said it was great so I tried this recipe ... and Ohmigod!  This is now our favorite cake.  I soaked the raisins in rum and paired the cake with Cream cheese II recipe with lemon zest added.  The nuts, raisins and pineapple ... my mouth is watering just thinking about this cake!  It didn't last long and our guests wanted to take it home.  Sam did this one right!!

This was my second time making carrot cake and I was quite pleased with the outcome. Neither myself nor my man are carrot cake fans, so the real test will be when I make one for his father who is. I left out the nuts and coconut. I also used 1 cup milk and 1 tbsp vinegar for  buttermilk substitution. I also added about 1/2 a tsp freshly grated nutmeg along with the cinnamon.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and everyone loved it. It's dense and moist and absolutely tasty. I was afraid with a long list of ingredients it would be difficult to make but it really comes together quickly! I also used the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site. Thanks for sharing, Brian!

I can't say from experience  the taste was the best I ever had because I did not get any but my husband and all his buddies at work say it really is the absolute best ever. Infact they all loved it so much it was gone in ten minutes and my hubby did not bring me a piece so I could try the cake I baked.  My hubby is already asking me to make another.

This was great!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I did take it out of the oven after 45 minutes, it was getting brown and crisp around the edges.  I would try to bake it a lower temp next time.

Brian I just want to thank you for sharing your grandfathers recipe with us.  The cake was delicious.  I followed the exact directions and ingredients that you gave us.  My kids loved it!  It reminded me of making carrot cake with my mom when I was a little girl.   Thanks again.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cake came out too wet.  I had to bake it for another 15 minutes.  I think it ist he pineapple liquid that the recipe stated undrained.  Not sure what else the caused the cake to be wet like that.  Also, there are too much stuff in the batter. If you were to try this recipe, cut the raisins, cocounut and walnut to 1/2 cup or 3/4  but not 1 full cup.  Anyway,  Thanks for the recipe.

Yummm This is the 3rd time I'm making this cake for my Boyfriends Birthday...he's a Carrot Cake Aficionado and this is his absolute favorite...Always moist and super flavorful! The only thing I do different is throw the raisins and nuts in a food processor since his kids are super picky!:o) I ice it with my favorite Cream Cheese Icing...Delish!!

Sam's carrot cake is really good.  There are two listings for Cream Cheese Frosting II, the one by JJ is the one I used, scaled down to only 1/4 cup butter - it is sweeter than the other one.  This produced the perfect amount of frosting.  It tastes best to me when both the cake and the frosting is cold, though it was good warm too.  * I made a couple of modest changes.  I ran out of raisins (used about 1/3 of a cup), but I wish I could have used the full amount.  I don't like coconut, so I left it out.  I also only used 3/4 cup of walnuts.  As a result of these cut backs, I used more carrot.  I purchases a 10oz bag of matchstick carrots and used the whole thing. It also saved me the hassle of shredding them.  Probably would have been better texture-wise if I had shredded them myself, but it was a decent substitute and a massive time saver.  **Finally, I used 1/2 cup applesauce plus 1/4 oil in place of 3/4 cup oil, because my husband is on a medication that causes him to gain weight.  As a result, I also reduced the sugar to compensate for the natural sugar in the applesauce.  I ultimately used 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons.  The cake turned out very moist and yummy!

I just finished eating a slice of this cake, and all I can say is OH MY GOODNESS!! Even though there have been over six hundred comnents/reviews, I just had to add one more. This cake is delicious and I am adding it to my "go to" recipes. If you want an outstanding carrot cake...this is the one! I followed the recipe exactly, but left off the raisins since I didn't have any. I didn't really miss them as the cake was moist and flavorful with the other ingredients. Grab a fork and enjoy!

Absolutely loved this cake.  I even subsituted 1/2 Kamut (ancient whole grain) flour and the cake was still wonderful.  Love that it only uses 3/4 cup oil.  Smart to use the buttermilk.  GREAT CAKE.

This was very good.  I followed the recipe and did wish it had a bit more spice.  We ate it the day after I made it and it was good.  We ate the leftovers two days later and it was wonderful.  It got more moist and the flavors got a bit more pronouced.  So I suggest making it a few days ahead!

Quite possibly the best Carrot Cake I have ever had! I was afraid at first that the cake would turn out soggy because of the wet-to-dry ingredient ratio - but now I am glad I didn't take anything out! This cake is so amazing that I won't be using any Carrot Cake recipe but this one from now on.  I only did two things different: (1)I used finely chopped pecans instead of walnuts and (2) I baked it in two 9-inch layers. I baked the layers at 350 degrees F. for about 35 minutes.  This recipe could easily make a three-layer cake.   I used a simple cream cheese frosting, but you could also use Orange Buttercream, Lemon Buttercream or just add zest to the cream cheese.  I don't think this cake needs anything else, but here are some very good Carrot Cake pairings:  When the cake comes out of the oven, brush the top with Orange Marmalade, Orange Juice or Honey.  Use chopped Macadamia nuts or Pecans in place of Walnuts.  Add Citrus zest to the cake or frosting.  Add chopped Nuts or toasted Coconut to the side of the frosted cake.  You could even go so far as to use a German Chocolate Cake Frosting, although that would make for a very hearty cake!  Although, like I said before, this cake needs no improving!

This was my first attempt at homemade carrot cake. I always thought it was going to be a very complicated process, but this was so easy... Probably my oven but these cakes were done in about 40 minutes. The result was a moist and very flavorful cake that I will be making again and again!

Amazing...  Carrot Cake is the only "cake" I enjoy and this was definately at the top on my Carrot Cake recipes.  Definately will be a do-over in my house.

This is by far the best carrot cake recipe I've ever found.  I wanted a carrot cake for my birthday but every one I found was either over $30 or had a lot of trans fat and junk it it so I decided to make my own.  It was fantastic and another family member requested I make the same cake for her birthday just one week later.  It was that good.  No changes necessary but I did double the amount of shredded carrots and it was excellent.

This cake is by far the blue ribbon winner.I used a cream cheese icing and spread it all over the cake and the middle of the two 9inch cakes.Also I took crushed walnuts and spread the top of the cake with them.It truly is a cake I'm proud to serve.My family is in awe each time I make it. Thanks for sharing. MK in NJ

This is the most amazing carrot cake.  Even my mother who is skeptical of any cake that doesn't come out of a box went back for seconds.  Iced with jar cream cheese frosting to avoid having to refrigerate and not even that shortcut could take away how delicious this was.

Took this cake to work and everyone loved it.  I like the fact that it doesn't have cups of oil in it, and I actually used a little applesauce and reduced the oil even further.  It still turned out moist and delicious.  I love the addition of the coconut and raisins.  They just put this cake over the top.  Fantastic recipe!

The best! I make these as cupcakes and they come out perfect. I use golden raisins and boil them in sugar water for 5-10 minutes until they are nice and plump (really makes a big difference.)

My family & friends are all huge carrot cake lovers!  I have made many different recipes over the years, and this is the best one ever.  I did not change a single thing, and I used the whipped cream cheese frosting from this website.  It was the perfect combination.  Thanks for sharing your Grandpa's wonderful recipe!!

A HUGE hit with my family. We make a special type of birthday cake for every birthday but this year my mom is requesting this one! and we just had it 2 weeks ago! the best carrot cake ever - i left out the raisins and it was still a hit. We used a cream cheese frosting home made.

Delicious. I used 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup oil and pecans instead of walnuts which I toasted, it came out really moist and good. It was gone in 15 minutes with a lot of compliments.  The only problem is that it came out really moist and i prefer a soft, airy cake that is moist enough.

Absolutely delicious!! I typically don't like carrot cake, but my husband loves it, so I decided to make one to take to our family Easter gathering. Everyone RAVED about it!! What I love is this is not spicy, like other carrot cakes I've tried. It's more sweet, but not too sweet...and very moist! I omitted the coconut and walnuts (don't like them), but aside from that I followed the recipe exactly. The Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site made this cake simply amazing!!! We ate every last crumb!!!

I made this for my husband's birthday and it was a total hit! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and did 3/4c regular milk with 1tsp lemon juice, and simmered the golden raisins (I hate using regular raisins in baked goods, I think they look like flies) in orange juice to plump them up. I did add 1/4tsp nutmeg and 1/2tsp ginger, and used brown sugar instead of white. Other than that, I followed the recipe, and frosted it with the Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting from this site- fantastic!

This cake was FABULOUS! I made it for our Easter Dessert and got RAVE reviews. The changes I made were: Used Pecans instead of Walnuts, used 3 tsps of Pumpkin Pie spice instead of the cinnamon, and added about 4 tblsp of minced candied ginger. I topped it with cream cheese icing, and it was perfect. Dense and moist and flavorful. I have made many carrot cakes over the years, and this is by far the best one yet! I will stop searching for the perfect recipe now, because I have found it! Thank you for much for sharing! :)

Make is exactly per recipe, which is really unlike me.  I did bake it in 2 9" pans for about 27 minutes because I love my cream cheese frosting.  Made Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site because I love my frosting with a good cream cheese taste.  Together, this was one of the best things I have ever baked.  This is my new Carrot Cake recipe!

Ummm seriously, carrot cake doesn't get better than this so you can stop looking! I have made this cake about 5 times and although this recipe is perfect as written, sometimes I replace a 1/2 cup of the oil with apple sauce and add a dash of nutmeg. Thanks Grandpa Sam!

Amazing cake! Don't waste your money with Costco's carrot cake, when you can make this! I didn't change a thing! My husband ate two slices and he doesn't like carrot cake.

Ive never made a carrot cake before and my inlaws asked that I make one for a 15 person birthday party. This cake was Amazing! I doubled the recipe and used a 12"x 3" round pan. When the cake cooled it was super moist yet still firm enough to slice the cake into 3 layers. I iced in between each layer. I substituted pecans, omitted raisins and splashed a bit of Nutmeg for personal taste.  This cake will be added to my recipe collection.

I made this as a two layer cake for my husbands birthday and it was amazing. It was moist and very flavorful. I omitted the walnuts and raisins per my husbands request and it still tasted great. I paired it with the cream cheese frosting II recipe.

This recipe was fantastic. It produced a tasty cake. Everyone really enjoyed eating it. The only addition that was made to the cake was the homemade cream cheese frosting as seen on the recipe for Carrot Cake III on this website.

Absolutely unbelievable!  I make this cake and separate the batter into 3 - 8 inch cake pans.  I use the cream cheese frosting from this site and put a layer of frosting between each cake after baking.  The best carrot cake I have ever had!

Good cake...made with a frosting that required 1 pk cream cheese & lots of confect sugar.  Way too sweet.  If made with a recipe with double the cream cheese & less sugar...probably would have rated higher.

I doubled this recipe and made it into approx. 30 muffins. Baked them for about 20-25 minutes. I've wrapped them individually for breakfast to go and froze some as well. Delicious when toasted and buttered. I substituted the raisins with chopped up dried apricots and left out the coconut hence increasing the shredded carrots to replace the coconut. Oh! I also didn't have buttermilk so I did what SCOTCHGIRL mentions in her review about regular milk and some lemon.

YUMMY! This the best carrot cake. I made this for my Mom's birthday (back in Sept) and it was moist and delicious. She loved it also, but suggested leaving the raisins out and adding more nuts, but that is totally a preference for her. This cake is great as is! LOVED it!

My fiancé requested I make him a carrot cake for Thanksgiving and this was the most interesting recipe I came across on AR. We both loved it, however he wasn't a fan of the pineapple tidbits in the cake. Instead of chopped walnuts I used some coarsely ground almonds. Also added an extra cup of shredded carrot, while also reducing the other add-ins by half. A generous pinch of nutmeg and allspice were both added for that "autumn" flavour. Frosted with "Cream Cheese Frosting II" from AR. Will definitely make again!

Its just O.K.  I don't really love pineapple and coconut in my carrot cake, but thought I should branch out because of this recipes high rating.  Not one of my guests loved it.  I make it EXACTLY as called for.  It was fine, just not excellent.  I do prefer more carrot and spice though.

This cake is AWESOME!  I made it for family and got rave reviews.  I chose to omit the raisins and coconut.  I added in 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.  I topped it with the Cream Cheese Frosting II (submitted by JJ) recipe from this website. WONDERFUL!  Thank you Brian for sharing this great recipe!

This recipe is perfect exactly as written.  Don't change a thing.  The cake is full of all the good stuff.  It was fluffy and moist.  And the flavor was perfect.  I had many compliments.  I have been looking for the perfect carrot cake recipe, and this is it.  I frosted it with Cream Cheese Frosting II submitted by Janni.  They were perfect together.

I made this for a party last night and was overwhelmed by compliments...many saying it was the best carrot cake they had ever had (my husband included).  Made the following changes: used 1/2 C apple sauce, 1/3 C oil and left out the coconut, baked 2 layers in 9in rounds, and iced with cream cheese icing II (from this site).  Thanks for sharing the recipe Brian!

I made 28 cupcakes and two mini bundt cakes with this recipe.  They turned out very moist.  I left out the nuts and coconut (due to family allergies) and frosted everything with Cream Cheese Frosting II (from this website).

This was a good cake.  I was pleased it was so moist with the oil amount.  This would make a good wedding cake since it is firm.  My cake did not leave the edge when cooked I used standard toothpick meathod to test.

Exceptional! Made exactly as written. Brought it to the office & the most finicky eater said it was delicious...better than his wife's. I used the Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting from this site for a lighter touch.

I used 3 c. carrots and only 1/4 c. coconut beause my husband doesn't like it. I only had a 20 oz. can of pineapple so I had to guess on how much liquid to leave in. The batter looked quite runny so I added 1/2 c. flour. I used 2, 9 inch pans and put parchment paper in the bottoms. I cooked the cake for 35 minutes. The weather here was very humid so after icing with cream cheese frosting I put it in the refrigerator. The cake was EXCELLENT. I almost purchased a carrot cake for $13 at the store and decided to make my own for my husband's birthday. I was so glad I did! Thank you, we all loved it.

Very moist.  I used half whole wheat flour and my family really enjoyed the cake.  It was nice to serve something that is not overly sweet (no cream cheese frosting) and have them like it.

Fantastic.  I used dates instead of raisins and it turned out great.  Very moist and flavorful.  No other changes needed.

My bf requested a carrot cake for his bday this weekend and so I attempted my first ever made from scratch cake.  I wanted a recipe like my grandmother used (with the nuts and raisins and other stuff) and not only did I manage to make this cake and not mess it up, but it was INCREDIBLE.  SO moist and flavorful.  I got a ton of complements on this cake.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used two 9in round cake pans which worked out perfectly.  I topped it with a simple home made cream cheese icing and chopped pecans!

Wonderful rich, moist cake. I left out the coconut as my husband doesn't like it, and topped with cream cheese frosting (whip together 8oz cream cheese, 1/2 tbsp vanilla, 1 stick butter, & 3 cups powdered sugar) and baked in a 9x13 pan for 45 minutes. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe! Substituted apple sauce for veg oil, 1/4c. veg oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce and the cake was still moist and wonderful. Also, didn't add raisins or nuts since I am not a fan and it still tasted delicious.  I've never had coconut in carrot cake before but it works!

I am usually a very good baker, but I must have done something incorrectly to end up with my final result after this recipe had so many raving reviews.  My cake was very soggy and not very carrot-cake like.  Thank you anyway!

Yum! I changed the serving size to 20 and got a 3 layer cake and 6 cupcakes out of the recipe. I baked the 8 inch round cakes for 30 minutes and the cupcakes for 12 minutes. Very delicious carrot cake. I used Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site for the frosting. Thank you!

Honestly, the best carrot cake I've ever had. It tastes like the carrot cake "cupcakes" from Trader Joes. YUM! I made it as listed and I also made it by omitting raisins and coconut and adding 1 additional cup of carrots. Perfect! Best the next day. Thanks for such a great recipe!!!!

I wasnt that impressed. I followed the directions exactly. It turned out ok. But I have had much better carrot cake than this one. Its not bad, it was good but not great.  Its definately better the next day. With all carrot cakes, thats the case.

After tasting this wonderful cake at my son's house, I baked this carrot cake for a Valentine's Day dinner for 4 couples. I decreased the sugar by using 1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup packed light brown sugar. I also omitted the  raisins and used only 1/2 cup of the coconut as I wasn't sure if everyone would like the raisins and all of the coconut. The cake was baked in 2-9" round cake pans for 25 minutes. The cake was flavorful and very moist and was enjoyed by all with many compliments.  I will be making this cake again!!

Absolutely yummy cake.  I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and did not have any raisins.  The cake was moist and delicious.  This is the best carrot cake my family has ever had.  God bless you, Sam.

Very Good! Moist! Light!  I love the pineapple, carrot,coconut and walnut assembly. I chose not to put the raisins in because I'm not a raisin lover and it was still delicious.  I did add 1/2 tsp ApplePie Spice.  This recipe is very light, and not as thick as the carrot pound cakes I have made in the past. I will definitely make this again.

I finally got around to making this recipe.  It is outstanding.  I used two 9 inch round cake pans and reduced the time by 15 mins.  I also omitted the raisins, only because I didn't have any on hand.  Next time would include raisins, I noticed the difference.

I made this using 3(9in) pans.  Iced only the tops of the layers with cream cheese icing.  Left out the raisins, since we don't care for them.  Was the best carrot cake ever.

Oh, so good!
This is the one I have been looking for. The only substitution I made was milk+ 1 tsp lemon juice for the buttermilk since I didnt have any. 
Topped with cream cheese icing; 2 blocks cream cheese, 1 stick butter, 1 tsp vanilla and 2 lbs powdered sugar.

I made this for one of my Christmas desserts and it was given some seriously good reviews. I was thrilled with it and will definitely be making it for special occassions in the future. One thing, unless you really dig the flavor and (more importantly) the texture of coconut, I would cut the coconut down by almost half. Also, I cut down the raisins a bit and was happy with the amount. Even as the recipes specifies though, I would give this 5 stars, absolutely delic!
I used creem cheese frosting II:

I'm with the one's that say this is the BEST carrot cake in the world!  I make it just like this (I do toast my coconut and nuts first) and it is fabulous.  Everybody else says its the best they've ever had also.  I think buttermilk and the ingredients at the end are crucial.  Thank you!

I don't even like carrot cake, but this was fantastic. I had several people tell me that it's the best they ever had. I am not a cake baker. Always afraid of the exact measurements concept, but I tried it, and it turned out great except I couldn't get it out of the pan. (I made it as a 2-layer cake) I ended up using a spatula and lots of nerves to finally get it free. I greased and floured the pans pretty liberally, so I don't know what the deal is with that. Maybe I cooked it too long.  I don't know, but it was great. As other reviewers suggested, I used Cream Cheese Icing II from this site, and it covered up all the dents from getting it out of the pan. Really good together. I will make it again, probably soon, except I'll cut down on the pineapple. It's a very forgiving recipe.

This is my first time ever baking a carrot cake and my first time ever tasting a carrot cake! I was looking for a recipe to make for a cupcake wedding and all I can say is I'm not looking anymore. I read every single review and I have to agree with the one reviewer. How can you rate a recipe when you change or alter the recipe? I changed nothing other than I made it into cupcakes. I was very careful not to over bake, which in my oven it was 350 for 18 min. I can't wait for the Bride to be to taste test them and see what she says, since I've never tried carrot cake before. I'm very glad this was my first recipe and taste test, because I now think I have a new favorite cake. A great big thanks for Sharing your Family favorite. I know that it's hard to pass along a "Secret" recipe. Sorry I did change the recipe I followed the other reviews and did the cream cheese frosting. Which I must say piped onto the cupcake perfectly.

I made this for my mom's 50th birthday party and it was a huge hit! I boiled the raisins, added 1/2 a teaspoon of ginger and  omitted the coconut, just because my mom is allergic. I actually ended up baking it into three 8 inch square pans to make a layer cake. This recipe is both easy and delicious, I highly recommend it!

This was definitely one of the most delicious carrot cakes I have made before. It was moist, flavorful, and beautiful. Everyone wanted the recipe! I will definitely save this recipe and make it again.

Awsome recipe!  The only change I made was to reduce the amount of oil to 1/4 cup and added 1/2 cup applesauce.  Some people may prefer the cake to be spicer; in which case you could add 1/2 teaspoon ginger and 1/2 teaspoon nutmug.  Rather than a cream cheese icing, I used the frosting I use on my Red Velvet Cake:  Cook 1 cup of milk and 5 tablespoons of flour over low heat until thick.  Cool.  Beat 1 cup icing sugar, 1 cup butter (or shortening)until fluffy (about 10 to 15 minutes).  Add cooled flour mixture and beat until like whipped crean (about 10 to 15 minutes).

Only carrot cake I make now. Love it.  I took one of the suggestions I found here and covered the raisins with orange juice, brought to boil, simmered for 15, let cool.  Drain when ready to add to recipe.

I baked 2 of these cakes and gave one to a friend. I had barely left his house and he was calling me on the phone to tell me that it was delicious!  I followed the recipe pretty much to the tee except that instead of shredding the carrot myself I used a 10oz bag of already shredded carrot instead of 2 cups.  It worked fine and was alot easier! This is now the carrot cake recipe I will be using from here on out! Thank you for sharing your grandfathers recipe.

I made this recently since it has all the goodies I like in it.  I followed others suggestions and baked in a 9 x 13 glass pan.  I used Cream Cheese Icing III from here to frost with and it was wonderful.  The batter looked really wet to me so I added an additional 1/2 cup of flour and it turned out perfectly.  It does seem to get moister as the days go on.  I will be making this one again.

I GIVE THIS CARROT CAKE TEN STARS, IT'S ALL THAT I HOPED IT WOULD BE. THIS IS MY FIRST CARROT CAKE AND I ALWAYS WANTED TO MAKE ONE AND IT HAD EVERYTHING THAT I LIKED IN IT, I JUST ADDED A LITTLE NUTMEG AND A LITTLE ALLSPICE TO ENHANCE THE FLAVOR AND NEXT TIME I MAY JUST TAKE AWAY ONE QUARTER OF A CUP OF EACH ADDITIVES[NUTS,CARROTS ETC] AWAY JUST TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE CAKE. EVERYONE LOVED THE CARROT CAKE AND I'M ON MY WAY TO MAKING ANOTHER ONE. I PUT CREAM CHEESE ICING ON IT, 16 o/z CREAM CHEESE, 1 CUP CONFECTIONER SUGAR,1 TBS. VANILLA EX.,1 CUP BUTTER, UNSALTED. IT HAS THE GOOD CREAM CHEESE TASTE AND NOT JUST A HINT OF IT AND IT'S NOT TOO SWEET. ENJOY

My thanks to Sam and to all the reviewers who encouraged me to make this incredibly delicious cake. I didn't change a thing and everyone who ate the cake told me it was the best carrot cake they had ever eaten. Your advice is so valuable. I baked the cake in two nine inch round pans and created a layer cake with cream cheese frosting in the center and the top. I decorated the top of the cake with lots of toasted chopped walnuts.

That was the first carrot cake I ever made and it came out perfect! I just substituted the buttermilk with regular milk and omitted the coconut flakes since I am not a big fan. My whole family really enjoyed it and will definitely make again. Thanks for this fatastic recipe!

I altered this recipe a bit and it was so delicious!I shredded the carrots with a stand up shredder and included all the juices. I also coudn't find crushed pineapple at T@#%@t so I bought cubed instead and pulsed it in a food processor. I added a little extra juice about three tablespoons to the batter.The cake was so moist and we ate half the cake in a day. I also cooled, iced the cake and stored it in the fridge,it's summer in CA it's too hot not to and who likes soggy cake? I nuked it a bit to soften the cream cheese icing when I served it. A glass of milk and I can't feel I feel this good without chocolate. I can't wait to make this again.

I followed lmarchant's suggestion to omit the coconut, walnuts, and raisins and add an additional cup of carrots.  It was a great tasting carrot cake, but I thought that the cake was a little oily.  I'll be decreasing the oil to 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup next time I make it to see what happens.

I added a pinch of clove and nutmeg to round out the flavors and used 3 cups of carrots. I also used the cream cheese frosting II as most of the other reviewrs did. Thanks for the recipe....

Worked really great.  I added one jar of carrot baby food, and it made it super moist.  Also substituted 1/4c oil with apple sauce. Added carmadon along with the cinnamon.  Tasted better than most I've bought at the store.

I have to say this was very good but didn't quite live up to all the hype. I have had equally good results, and in some cases a bit better, buying a carrot cake mix and adding the pineapple, raisins, nuts and coconut. 
Followed the directions in this recipe exactly and after 50 minutes the cake was a tad overdone ( so keep a eye on it because I don't think the hour time frame is right on.) Maybe this was the issue with me but it tasted a litte dried out and not as moist as I hoped it would be. The best part...I did as other suggested and made the Cream Cheese Frosting II and it was HEAVEN! I probably will never use cream cheese frosting from a can again!
All in all, it was a good cake, not great but good..no rave reviews from any one but just good.

A wonderful cake like I was looking for! Everyone found it very good tasting; one slight change I made the second time I baked is to remove 2 Tbsp. of the juice from the pineapple to make the batter a little firmer.  Also made 18 muffins; about 24 minutes time.

A really great carrot cake (and I LOVE getting my veggies in cake-form), but I did find it just a little bit dry.  I could have made a mistake, this was actually the first cake I've EVER baked, and it tastes good enough for me to give it another try.  Next time I'll add an extra cup of shredded carrots as some of the other reviews have suggested.  I baked it in two round cake pans and topped the cake with the whipped cream cream cheese frosting.

I made Sam's cake just as directed - with all the fruit and nuts! The cake was absolutely delicious.  The raisins plumped up beautifully and the pineapple and coconut add depth, richness and moisture.  This makes a nutrition packed after school snack as an alternative to those horrible snack bars that are nothing but sugar and cheap carbs.

This is THE BEST carrot cake! I am not a huge carrot cake fan but decided to make this for Easter. My mom said I might have to make this for every holiday. I did simmer the raisins in orange juice which plumped them up and brought out the flavor. This cake is divine!

All I could say was "OH MY GOD!" as I sat there moaning and eating this cake! I don't think it really needs frosting at all, but cream cheese frosting is like putting wrapping paper on a present - not really neccesary. We increased the carrot to 3 cps, cut the coconut to 2/3 cp, omitted the raisins and baked it in two 9" rounds for 35 min.  I promise to keep Sam's name attatched to it!  Thanks sooo much!

Scrumptious! I made this for our Easter dinner, and it was a hit! I substituted some applesauce for the oil, as others have suggested (I used about 1/3 c. oil, then added applesauce to the measuring cup until the liquid reached the 3/4 c. mark), but kept everything else the same. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Made this twice last week and they were gone within minutes. I frosted it & chilled it in the fridge for about 2 hours before serving.  It tastes better than having it straight from the oven

I made this recipe last weekend for easter dinner...wow, what a fabulous cake!  My uncle told me after dinner that he thought I should have enough time before supper to make another, it went over that well with my family.  The only thing I did different was I skipped out on the coconut because I'm not a huge fan of it...I also added 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg.  Frosted with cream cheese frosting II from this site...again, fabulous!

Excellent carrot cake. I made it for Easter and everyone raved about it. However, I did make a few changes. 1) I didn't use any raisins as no one likes them. 2) I used 2-1/2 cups of shredded carrots. 3) I used 1/2 cup coconut. 4) I used 1/2 cups chopped walnuts and 5) I used two 8" round pans instead of a 9x13.
Will definitely make this again!

Wow! Made for east and received so many compliments.  My co-workers enjoyed it the next day as well.  Omitted raisins and nuts.  Some complained about the coconut taste but I couldn't even tell it was in there.

It was unreal how fabulous this cake is! I'm not a big fan of carrot cake, but this is to die for. It's more like a cake/pudding.  My father's eyes rolled into his head yesterday when I served it for desert on Easter.  It was unbelievable decadent. Thanks Sam! Wherever you are!

This cake was simple and delicious. It was my first attempt to make a cake in a while and this turned out to be amazing. I'm looking forward to making it again. I will add a few more raisins next time, but only because I like raisins!

Great recipe! Delicious, moist, and easy to make. The only changes I made were to omit the nuts, use packaged baking raisins, and bake in two round pans to make a double layer cake (took about 40 minutes to bake). I frosted it with the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Icing from this site, which was perfect for it. I took it to my family's Easter dinner and the whole cake was quickly devoured. Thank you, Sam and Brian!

SO incredibly delicious.  I used 2 - 9 inch round pans so the baking time was much less.  Around 35 minutes.  I iced it with the cream cheese frosting II recipe found on this site.  PURE HEAVEN!!

Ultra moist and delicious.  I used 3 cups carrots and 1 1/2 cups walnuts, left out raisins/coconut according to family preference.  The best me and all of my Easter guests had ever had.  Frosted with cream cheese frosting: 12oz cream cheese, 1 stick butter, 1tsp vanilla, 1T flour (to cut down on the ultra sweet flavor sometimes buttercreams have) and about 3 1/4 cups powdered sugar.  I can't wait to have room for another piece!

Yes indeed this is the very best carrot cake I've ever had!  Made as is. I would give it more than 5 stars were it possible. Who needs icing or glaze...it is so  deliciously rich it can easily stand on it's own.  Made it in a Bundt pan [just fit] and it baked up with a wonderful crust all the way around,in just about the same time.   Thanks Brian [& Sam] for sharing. This is definitely a keeper!  Lovestocook

I am a certified "meddler" when it comes to trying recipes, but I made this 100% according to the recipe, and it was the best carrot cake I've ever eaten.  I normally shy away from carrot cake because the frosting is way too sweet, but I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe (with the addition of only a tiny bit of lemon juice) and this was fantastic.  My boyfriend can't stop talking about it.

I have never had carrot cake before, but I thought that this was delicious! I did have one problem...it seemed to separate on me. I don't blame the recipe because I have to use gluten free flour mix and I've never made it before. If anyone could help me with some ideas, I'd appreciate it! I really liked this cake!

Unbelievable!  I made this for my sister-in-law's birthday and it was a huge hit - even with the kids. I had never made a carrot cake but this was very easy.  No need to make any changes... My dad said he does not want any cake other than this cake from now on. Like others, I used Cream Cheese Frosting II and it was wonderful, as well. Thank you so much!

Delicious! I think it was best served after chilling in frig for several hours. I frosted with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site. I baked in a 9x13 pan for about 35-40 minutes at 350. I added wheat germ and flax seed meal- maybe about 1 T each. 1 tsp cinnamon instead of 2. No raisins. I used 1/4 cup natural apple sauce and 1/2 cup oil. It is easy and so good!! Thank you for sharing your Grandfather's famous cake!

Yummilicious.  This was mm good.  I'm not kidding.  I had to give part of it away so I wouldn't eat it all.  Anyone out there counting calories?  I used a cream cheese recipe from this site and let me tell you, homemade beats store made any day.  This receives 5 stars for good reason.  Because it was perfect.

If you are looking for a great Carrot Cake recipe then look no further!! This has got to be the BEST Carrot Cake ever made. I made this, iced it with cream cheese icing while it was still warm and my family devoured it!! I took the last 3 pieces to work and they all agreed that it was the best that they had ever tasted. THANKS for sharing!! Lisa

Super recipe!!!This is the first carrot cake I have ever made and it turned out wonderful.  I got many compliments.  The recipe though was too much for the size pan suggested so I put the rest of the batter in a muffin tin and made 6 muffins/cupcakes and the kids loved them.

Very good! I followed the recipe exactly as shown; the only change I made was using 2-1/2 cups shredded carrot.  I baked on two 8" round pans and used the "cream cheese frosting II" recipe from this site.

Thanks!

Thank you to your grandfather Sam for this wonderful recipe. I made it a little healthier by using 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour. For the 3/4 cup oil I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil. I also didn't have coconut on hand, so I omitted (but will add next time I make it). Well worth the effort! I also added just a little bit of cream cheese frosting. Thank you - I sense this will become a favorite in our house!!

This is by far the BEST carrot cake I have ever had.  I will definately make this again.  This cake is so moist and delicious, you really don't even need frosting.  I baked mine in a 9 x 13 pan & it turned out wonderful.  With this recipe, you don't need to change a thing:)

I thought the cake was ok. It wasn't as sweet or as flavorful as I prefer it to be but it was definitely edible. I left the raisins out and used 3 cups of carrots and frosted it with a cream cheese frosting which by the way is one of the best cream cheese frosting I've ever had. For the frosting you cream together 1/2 cup softened butter and 2- 8oz pks of softened cream cheese, add tsp of vanilla extract, and then slowly add in 2 cups of sifted confectioners sugar... simple and yummy!!!

This recipe is fantastic.
I am not a fan of nuts in cakes so I ommited them. I used my kitchenaid mixer and it really encorporated everything well. I loved how after a good beating the batter had a fantastic light orange colour.

After baking my cake was beautiful. The texture was perfect. I loved how it had a great orange shade. The frosting was delicious too. This is the PERFECT carrot cake!

I made this for my husband's birthday. He REALLY loved it. I'm giving it 4 stars because my kids did not like everything in it. I made it two times following the recipe exactly the same. For some reason it came out fairly dry the second time. Ah well...the flavor is worth the shredding of the carrots. I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II on this website. Yummo!

This is such a delicious and beautiful cake.  I didn't have coconut, pineapple, or raisens, so I just increased the carrot amount to 3 cups as per other reviewers.  Replaced some of the oil with applesauce and topped with cream cheese frosting II..but to be honest, the frosting took away from the great carrot cake flavor and probably won't use frosting again.

I followed this recipe precisely-- no modifications-- and it came out perfectly. (Well, OK, I added nutmeg, cloves, and cardamom, but those hardly make a difference chemistry-wise.) I won't be trying any other carrot cake recipes, nor will I need to resort to Wegman's for carrot cake ever again! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I had to omit the nuts.  I really enjoyed this recipe and thought it was pretty impressive for my first attempt, but my dad, who loves carrot cake said it was good, but not the best.  I think it was a bit too sweet and not carroty enough in his opinion.  I guess you just keep trying until you find a recipe that you like!

This is a terrific Carrot cake. I served it for dessert at a large family gathering and everyone loved it!
I knew beyond a doubt when Nona, who rarely if ever eats dessert of any sort, requested another piece to take home for later.
Thanks for sharing the recipe..delizioso!

I was excited to try out this recipe after reading the reviews, but I was tad disappointed in the result. The cake seemed more pudding-ish, rather than cake-like (I didn't add the coconut), but the flavor was excellent with the cream cheese frosting; everyone commented on how good it was. Next time, however, I'd grate the carrots into smaller pieces and drain the pineapple... and add coconut. :)

hmm. was not quite keen on the flavour myself, but family and friends seemed quite  enthusiastic about it . thus the five stars . :)

oh! really, one mustn't over-bake the cake. the edges of the cake's base tend to harden and dry out quite quickly if it is over-baked.

My daughter, Miss Tyler, the carrot cake queen, gave this recipe her seal of approval! OK, per others suggestions, I used half brown sugar and half white. Used a half cup of oil and a quarter cup of applesauce. Added more cinnamon than suggested and a pinch of nutmeg. A group of us are going away for the weekend, so I decided to make this recipe into cupcakes and frosted them with the Cream Cheese II frosting from this site. FYI, this recipe yielded 26 cupcakes for me. Good job Brian and thanks so much!!

Delicious! I made it with coconut-cream cheese frosting from this site and it was wonderful! The cake was very moist and flavorful, I added an extra 1/2 cup of shredded carrots and left out the nuts (didn't have any) it was excellent!

I was looking here for a recipe similar to my aunt's to check on the nutritional values.  This is exactly the recipe that she has used for years and the family favorite by far.  Not hard and my teenaged cousins have even been known to bribe boys with this.

Yum, this is great. I didn't use coconut or walnuts. Next time, after shredding the carrots in the food processor I might give them a bit more time on the puree cycle. The taste was great but I'd like it better if the carrots weren't so evident. Overall, a great recipe though.

This was pretty good, just not the carrot cake to end all carrot cakes.  Will probably make again, but will try other recipes, too.  Next time I will leave out the raisins and add extra carrots instead.

I made this for my co-workers a few months back for a pot luck and it was loved by all.  It was moist and delicious.

Snaps for Brian and Sam! I've made this cake several times and its still the best recipe out there. I don't change the recipe I do change the presentation. I make 2 rounds and slice them lengthwise for 4 layers and more cream cheese frosting. Our favorite is cinnamon rolls III (this site) not overly sweet and thick enough for frosting a cake. Thanks for your recipe!!!

This cake is excellent!  I have made it a couple of times now and everyone really loves it.  I made it along with a couple of other cakes for my son's birthday and it was the first cake to be completely gone!  Incredible!!

This was my first time making carrot cake and it turned out really well.  I used 2 - 9 inch pans and they were done in under 40 minutes.  I also used the cream cheese II frosting as others suggested.  The cake does have a lot going on in it though... a pineapple bit here, then the nuts and raisins and coconut.  But, very substantial and delicious

This is so moist.  I can't believe how good it is.  I made it without the raisins and nobody missed them.  At Easter, my dad, who is a great cook, said that I beat his ricotta cake.  I made this with the cream cheese frosting that others had mentioned but I did add more sugar but I think it was too sweet.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this cake last week-end and we loved it.  Tonight was the last piece and my husband wanted to know if I was making another one tomorrow.....he said he would give it a 10 star.  The only thing I did different was bake it in a 9x13 pan for 45 minutes.  Thanks Sam for leaving your recipe for others to enjoy.

This recipe turned out to be AWESOME! I think it was the buttermilk in the recipe that really did the trick! 

The cake was so moist..my boyfriend couldnt believe it was homemade. He was like "Did you really make this from scratch?" then he had a few more bites and his next words were "So, like you used flour and stuff to make this right?" :-D

 The only thing I did differently was omitted the raisins(just a personal preference). I thought to omit the pineapple because I wasnt sure how it would taste, but Im glad I didnt because you couldnt taste the pineapple, it just added a little kick of extra sweetness to it.. this one will be an Easter tradition...

I prepared this using the recommendations of other reviewers leaving out the nuts and coconut due to allergies. I boiled the raisins in apple juice and allowed them to cool in the liquid making them very tender and moist. The cake was wonderful. Iced with a cream cheese/butter frosting. Big hit Easter Sunday dinner.

It was the first cake I have made from Scratch- I left out the raisins and it was phenomenal - even my ultimate picky nephew ate it even though we didn't tell him what it was
This will now become our family cake!

I made these into cupcakes and got rave reviews.  They were light and moist, not dense at all.  Small change to the recipe: I added nutmeg and allspice.  My husband is not a cake eater, but loved these cupcakes.

I made this cake for Easter and it was absolutely delicious!! After reading some of the other reviews I did omit the raisins and coconut & increased carrots to 3 cups, used pecans instead walnuts & just used a store bought cream cheese icing. Everyone raved about how great it was & couldn't believe I made it. Thanks for sharing, I will definately make this one again!!

This is a wonderfully moist cake. I didn't alter the recipe at all and it was delicious. Sometimes carrot cakes get mushy after a day or so, but not this one. It remained fresh and moist . Thanks for sharing your Grandfathers recipe.

This is a great recipe made as written. I did add 1/4 tsp of ginger I grated and dried myself a month or so ago. That was fun :) I also added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. I have made this before and wanted to try cupcakes this time. After putting the first batch in the oven I realized I forgot to put the sugar in the batter.  No worries though. I called that batch muffins instead and the sugar on the coconut and in the craisins I used made them darn good as they were. I didn't want to disappoint my other half who told me if I loved him I would make him carrot cake every day, so I added about half the sugar as I had half the batter left. They were both awesome with some cream cheese frosting the muffins even tasted awesome. Next time I make this I am going to try it with only half the sugar because I do love my other half and want him healthier than all that sugar will allow. I don't plan on making him some every day either. lol

I followed the majority of the recipe, except I subbed 1/2C candies ginger and 1/2C chopped dates for the 1C raisins and I subbed pecans for walnuts. Turned out fantastic.

To die for carrot cake! You can add more than called for shredded carrots. The pineapple is a great addition

Way too long of a cook time for this cake.  Too dry and too many ingredients which took away from the moist carrot cake I know.

I made this for Thanksgiving and loved it. The only two changes I made were to omit the raisins and split the sugar into a 3/4 cup of white and 3/4 cup of brown sugar. Otherwise I followed it as is then frosted it with the Cream cheese frosting 2 here on all recipes. Loved it, it is a keeper!

Absolutely amazing, best carrot cake ever! We were out of white sugar, so I substituted brown sugar, also used powdered buttermilk which I added directly to the other dry ingredients, then added the water needed for the dry buttermilk to all the dry ingredients. Will ONLY make this receipt going forward!! Everyone raves about it. Also did an easy homemade cream cheese frosting which was fabulous.

So glad I read the reviews first. This cake does Not need to be baked for 1 hour. I used a 9x13 pan and baked it for 45 minutes. I feel I could've even done 38-40 minutes, but it still came out ok. Again I'm very glad I didn't leave it the full 1 hour. I ommited the coconut and raisins (personal preference) and it was still delish! I also made some homemade cream cheese frosting, from this site. Everyone loved it. Definitely will be making this again.

I made it "as is" and used two 9 inch round cake pans.  It was delicious.  I used the "Whipped Cream Cream Cheese" frosting between layers and on the top.  Wonderful cake.

This is the way carrot cake is supposed to be!  The pineapple and coconut give it amazing texture and interest.  The only substitution I made was using milk/lemon juice in lieu of buttermilk.

I've made it 3 times (even adjusting later with personal preferences) and still found that while it was definitely yummy, it's not THEE BEST I've ever had, especially considering it's a bit time consuming to prepare. I'll probably search for ones that take less work to see if they turn out just as or more flavourful.

I have to agree with others who gave this one star....mainly tasteless....not sure why it got so many 4 star reviews.  My mistake in not reading more of the reviews.  Most of the 4-star reviews--seem to be written by bakers who deviated from the recipe in some way. I followed the recipe exactly.  It was dark in color--as someone else described...the color of pumpernickel bread.    The only bright spot was that I did find a recipe for cream cheese frosting that wasn't sickeningly sweet.  Unfortunately, this cake could have used additional sugar.

I used pecans and raisins because that was what I had.  I made it in 2 round pans and baked for 38 minutes.  My family thought it was the best homemade carrot cake they ever tasted.

Everyone in my family loved this cake! It was a home run. I omitted the coconut because a few of us don’t like it and made cream cheese icing.  Not a difficult recipe to prepare and the best carrot cake I have had. It will be a regular at my house.

Excellent!!! So delicious and rich. My husband loved it!! I followed the recipe without any changes and it was perfect! For the frosting I used “cream cheese frosting II” which paired very nicely with the taste and moistness of her cake.

This is THE BEST carrot cake recipe I have ever used!!! Every time I make it or make cupcakes out of it we can hear the angels rejoicing!! Yep! That good!  And for those of you who like to try different things, I made my homemade cream cheese icing and kicked it up one notch by adding some mango/ghost pepper hot sauce! Quite the incredible combination!  Those were some of the best cupcakes I have ever made!

Great recipe, everyone thought it was very good. For personal preference I didn’t use raisins and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I didn’t have walnuts so used pecans which I often do in recipes. The proportions of carrots, pineapple and coconut were just right for our taste. Made a delicious, moist cake.

WOW! Ahhh-mazing! I made this for my hubby’s birthday today (his request) and this recipe did not disappoint!! He said it is the best carrot cake he’s ever had! It’s so moist and just absolutely delicious. For the cream cheese icing I creamed 16 Oz cream cheese & 1 stick of butter until smooth then added 32 Oz bag of confectioners sugar and a couple of tsp of vanilla and whipped until fluffy & creamy. YUM!!

The Absolute BEST Carrot Cake I've ever eaten. My mom and I used to make this every year for my husband's birthday. We make Paula Dean's Cream Cheese Frosting. It takes time to shop for all the ingredients and make it but it is so worth it.  I was surprised to find it here on All Recipes so even though it has been a few years since we made it, i still remembered it as Grandpa Sam's Carrot Cake.

I followed the recipe except for reducing the amount of sugar (just my personal preference)  on my first try my husband said it tasted great but needed more sugar.  On my second try I used a little over 1 cup of sugar and everybody loved it.  My mother in law even said that the cake tasted like something you would eat at a very expensive restaurant.

This carrot cake is the best! I deleted the other carrot cake recipes I saved to allrecipes after making this one, because this cake is quite possibly the best cake I've tasted. I did add one extra cup of carrots, and subbed milk with lemon juice for the buttermilk. Cooked for 55 minutes in a 9 x 13 pan. It tastes great frosted or plain. I was looking for a recipe with less vegetable oil than the one my mom used to make, and this fit the bill.

THIS IS THE BEST CARROT CAKE EVER. Seriously! I have made this carrot cake twice now for Easter and it's always the first cake to go....and we usually have about 4 cakes to chose from. The added pineapples are really what takes this cake to the next level it. I have never made it with the raisins as some people in my family do not care for raisins with the exception of not using the raisins I made no changes to the recipe.  It's super moist and divine.  It's perfect with a simple cream cheese frosting but it might be too sweet paired with a buttercream frosting (without cream cheese to balance the sweetness). Also if you are looking for a taller cake recipe using 9 inch round pans you will need to double this recipe..the cake does not yield a tall cake.

Wow, best carrot cake ever! I made this for one of the desserts for Easter and followed the recipe exactly. Super easy to make. I baked it in a 9 x 12 inch pan and had room to frost with a cream cheese frosting.

Loved this recipe! Made it with my father for Easter and the whole family loved it. We decided not to include the raisins. We also chose to put the walnuts on the icing, rather than in the cake. IT WAS AMAZING. Seriously. We baked it in 8inch circle cake pans, and took 10 minutes off the cook time and they came out PERFECT. It was so moist and easy to ice. Will definitely be making this again.

I have used this recipe for the last few years and it's still a winner. I leave out the raisins and walnuts as I'm not a fan of nuts in any baked good (personal preference) and don't really want the raisins. This cake is so moist and flavorful. My son requested it for his 4th birthday cake. Everyone loves this cake. You can't go wrong with it. I use a cream cheese frosting on it. I make it every Easter and use a diagram from Betty Crocker to turn it into a bunny. I put coconut shavings on the frosting so it looks like a fuzzy bunny so the coconut and pineapple inside it really sets it off as well.

This is a FANTASTIC carrot cake recipe.  I made a double recipe of this delicious cake for my husband’s surprise birthday party.  I followed the recipe exactly except for omitting the raisins because he’s not a big fan of raisins.  The cake turned out great and was praised by everyone at the party.  I even had people asking to take some home so they could have more later.  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site. 

Before I added the nuts I took out enough batter for a few cupcakes because I have a granddaughter with a serious nut allergy.  I then added the nuts to the rest of the batter and baked.  Using a double recipe I had enough for 8 cupcakes, a 9 x 13 pan and an 8 x 8 pan.  Since I was using glass baking dishes I lowered the oven temperature to 325 and I think the cakes baked for about 45 minutes.

This is a great recipe and will be my go to recipe for Carrot Cake.

This is the way carrot cake should be! I did use coarsely grated carrots just because that is how I like carrot cake.

Yummy! Best Carrot Cake ever!  I left out the raisins because I don’t like them but the rest was as written and it is delicious! 
What would the baking time be if I use a bundt pan next time? 
Thanks for such a delicious recipe!

I come back to this carrot cake again and again! I never make any modifications, this recipe is great as is and it's requested by family over and over again. Yes, it's like a junk drawer recipe with all the nuts, fruit and carrots, but in the best of ways! Even people who don't like carrot cake have given this one positive reviews. Definite hit!

I would call it a 'loaded' carrot cake.  It was a bit denser than I expected.  It was perfect to cut and serve.  I made a no powdered sugar cream cheese frosting, also good.

This is by far the best carrot cake I have ever had. I’ve been making this for Easter the past four years. It’s so good that my family and I cannot wait a whole year to have it again so I make it for my father-in-laws birthday in December too.

This recipe is sooo good.  But, of course, I made a few changes.  I didn’t add the coconut or raisins and substituted the walnuts with 2 cups pecans.   I baked it in a 9x13 and only cooked it 50 minutes.  Then iced it with the Cream Cheese II frosting.  Will definitely make it again.  We had to try it after 20 minutes!  I’ve read that it will be even better tomorrow.  I will keep it in the refrigerator and have more then.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I have been baking this recipe now for over a year as one of my homemade desserts at the cafe I own and operate. You cannot beat it as I have been to food shows and sampled carrot cakes at the show. They look beautiful but cannot compare. Make the recipe as is why go thru all the extra work cooking the raisins.  My customers love this cake and drive 15 to 20 miles to eat with us and actually call ahead to reserve the cake for their dessert as it goes fast. 
Just felt I should submit this review as it deserves it. Thanks so much Brian for your contribution to this site.

Really good! This was my first attempt at making a carrot cake from scratch and I chose this recipe based on the reviews. Totally amazing! As some other reviewer’s noted I also did not have buttermilk available so I added a tablespoon of raw apple cider vinegar to regular milk. I omitted the coconut due to an allergy and I also simmered the raisins in pineapple orange juice to rehydrate them a bit. I drained off the juice before adding  the raisins to the recipe. I will double the pineapple next time just because I love pineapple. And just for fun here is a link to some history about carrot cake. I made this cake for my husband‘s birthday and a conversation came up at dinner as to how anyone ever came up with making a cake out of carrots. Enjoy! http://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/carrotcake.html

I made it without any adjustments.  Just added a touch of nutmeg and used milk with 1 T. vinegar as I didn't have any buttermilk.  I thought it was moist and quite tasty without being too sweet.  Would definitely make it again.

This is my go-to for carrot cake. I eliminated the coconut, raisins and the walnuts do to allergies and it still tasted delicious. just the right amount of spice just the right amount of moisture. I  made them into cupcakes as well and they were delicious that way too. This is really worth a trying.

Hands down, The best carrot cake recipe out there. Not sure why some people gave it low ratings. I can only assume they messed up the recipe or are used to a very basic carrot cake.  This one is phenomenal not basic at all. I followed the recipe with the exception of adding 1/8 tsp nutmeg, because I enjoy the kick it gives. The second time around I followed others suggestions to use the cream cheese frosting II recipe. I found the recipes frosting, while classic was a tad too sweet. I’m usually a frosting girl and eat Very little of the cake.  I found myself eating just the cake! I gave it 5 stars even though I added nutmeg because it’s still a 5 star cake without it.

This is by far, the best carrot cake EVER! I made it for my boyfriends Birthday ?? and not only did he love it, but so did his two boys!  Changes I made to the recipe: almond milk & a teaspoon of lemon juice in place of the buttermilk, I followed other suggestions from the most popular review at the top! Loved it!

This was probably the worst cake i’ve ever tasted. I told my mother to try it and we both agreed it tastes like chemicals. I also do not recommend baking it for an hour, maybe 40 mins.

We loved this carrot cake. Made it one night and then made it a couple night sweet later. It is so perfect. We did not use the coconut. Want to try it with that for sure.

Great recipe, i substituted the pineapple for a ripe banana, didnt have buttermilk so replaced it with a can of yogyhurt. also opted out the raisins and coconut flakes. The cake came out moist and delicious. Tip make sure the carrots are finely grated so you wont end up with a bulky recipe. Happy baking :)

It was a major hit ! 
I didn’t have pineapple juice or butter milk so I made the following adjustment and it was perfect texture !
I used 1 cup of milk with 1 tbsp of vinegar instead of butter milk
3 cups of shredded carrot.
1 cup of granulated sugar and 1 cup of light brown sugar which is probably why it was darker than my liking. 
It was done after 50 minutes

We loved this recipe with a few tweaks it was amazing and moist! I used regular milk instead of buttermilk,  a 1/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of using 3/4 cup of oil. I also replaced the other fruits and nuts with diced Granny Smith apples! We didn't use icing but melted butter on top while it's hot is so good!

I absolutely love this cake and my kids request it as their birthday cakes.  I only make two minor changes.  I leave out the coconut because I hate it, and I change the walnuts to pecans.  When I serve this to friends, I always get compliments.

I made this cake for the first time, for a Christmas Eve dinner.  Everyone enjoyed it.  No one left a crumb on their plate. I thought it was a little bland even though I added 1/4 tsp. Nutmeg and All Spice in place of a tsp. of cinnamon.  Will use 2tsp. Cinnamon next time. I baked it 45 minutes in a glass 9x13 dish and it was slightly over done, but was still moist to the taste. My oven runs a little hot. I iced it one pkg. cream cheese, one stick butter, 2 tsp. Vanilla, and 2 cups powdered sugar.  A little tangy and not overly sweet which was a good. This recipe is a “go to” and flexible!

My husband said it was the best carrot cake he'd ever had. It was wonderful, even better the second day. I used golden raisins and boiled in orange juice before adding. Also baked in 3 round cake pans for about 25 minutes. Will definitely make this again.

I love the addition of pineapple in a carrot cake and glad I found this recipe.  super moist and delicious.  I added probably 1/2 tsp more cinnamon and maybe 1/4 tsp allspice just out of preference.  thank you!  will definitely be my 'go to' for carrot cake.

I give this recipe 0 stars because I was tremendously    disappointed. The cake was way too moist. I put it back in the oven and only the top cooked. Everything below it was like not cooked. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE. I only gave it 1 because I had to. It wouldn't let me submit it if didn't.

Really excellent cake! Very dense and moist, everyone loved it on my birthday. Very flavorful, we also made a pineapple coconut buttercream frosting for it which just made it yummy. I read in another review that they cooked down some orange juice with their raisins and let them cool so we did that too and it was amazing. We placed them in a pan and just covered the raisins - I'd probably say about half a cup of juice, just eye it, and heat it up until it boils, then cool. They soak up the juice and add a little citrus note when you bite into a grape. Very easy to make and will be making again, everyone absolutely loved it

Great recipe. The first time I made this I completely forgot to add the sugar (sleep-deprived mommy!) — to my surprise, it was still really good. The sweetness of the pineapple, coconut, and raisins made it into a great breakfast or babyfood item (under supervision obviously) without being loaded with sugar.

The next time I made it *with* the sugar, and it’s a fabulous carrot cake. The only changes I made were a few minutes more cooking time, and subbing milk/vinegar for buttermilk. Buttermilk is better, but I don’t normally have it in my fridge. 

Will definitely keep this recipe as my go-to for carrot cake and baby/toddler/breakfast muffins.

This is my go-to carrot cake and has been for years. The minor changes I make are to half the raisin quantity in order to add cranberries in equal measure. (I also use “drunken” raisins that I have aging in my pantry.) Like some others have said, I also use half white and half brown sugar instead of just white. Other than that, followed to the letter and wonderful every time!

This cake is super moist! Like a delicious sponge! I added grated ginger and extra carrot and left out the coconut (forgot it when I was at the store ) 
I then used all recipes cream cheese frosting recipe.

Great recipe easy to follow. Here are my edits. Drain carrots and pineapple add back 1-2 tbs liquid. Chop nuts fine not course and less by 1/4 cup. Lemon zest. 2 x 9” round pans 35 minutes at 350. Cool 10 minutes in pan and flip on racks. Frosting II recipe on AR works beautifully with this cake.

Very moist cake!  A good carrot cake flavor not too sweet which is great because when you add frosting and/or filling , a very sweet cake will be overpowering. I baked this in two 8 inch cake pans for only 30 minutes and layered it with a classic cream cheese frosting. A few other changes that I made: I used cake flour and cut the cinnamon by a half a teaspoon and added half a teaspoon of ground ginger I also used slightly watered down sour cream in place of the buttermilk and omitted the raisins because I was planning to cut the layers and stack them so I wanted a nice even cut. I cut the amount of walnuts in half and chopped them superfine sprinkling on the top of each cake pan after the batter was already filled which allowed the walnuts to stay mostly at the top and I used that as my middle layers so I got a nice crunchy surprise with my cream cheese frosting filling. The batter is very thin which produces a very light, airy cake. I think if you wanted it to be more dense,  squeeze all the moisture out of the carrots before adding them. This is definitely a keeper and this recipe is very adaptable!  I got tons of compliments from this cake. Thanks Sam!

My absolute favorite carrot cake recipe ever! I love all of the extras in it like the raisins, coconut and pineapple. The cream cheese frosting was perfect and cream cheese heavy. I made a carrot cake for my dad when I was 13 and it had crunchy carrots and tasted terrible. 17 years later I redeemed myself with one of the best cakes I’ve ever made.

I make this recipe every year for my husband's birthday. Everyone always raves about it. I leave out the raisins just for personal preference, only add a couple tablespoons of coconut, and also add 1/4 ts ground cloves and 1/2 ts nutmeg for a bit more holiday spice.  Just a fantastic recipe.

This cake was awesome! I made it for my husband for his birthday and it was a huge success. I substituted the walnuts for pecan pieces and left out the pineapples & raisins, but other than that, I followed the recipe. I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II as the "icing on the cake!". This is the first time I made everything from scratch.

I loved this cake!!! It came out just moist enough and tasted amazing. 

After reading the comments, I made the following adjustments
-added 1 tsp cinnamon instead of 2
-added 1 tsp nutmeg
-baked in two 9" pans instead of one

I also didn't add any walnuts because of a nut allergy and it still tasted great! Many people said to omit the raisins, but if you like raisins keep em! It adds to the texture and moistness. I also added 1 tsp orange zest for a bit extra flavor.

A friend referred me to this recipe after they made it for my birthday! My MIL was here that day and had a piece, said she wanted for her birthday! Omitted raisins and nuts, sent the carrot shavings through my juicer to dry them out. Perfect. Carrot cake lovers dream! Used a cream cheese butter cream and created a 2 tier naked cake.

I made this for my mom's birthday, in cupcake form. Wasn't sure how long to cook them, because the batter is quite wet and dense. Inserting a toothpick in the center came out clean, but they were still a bit soggy in the middle. Also I bought a 20 oz can of crushed pineapple and wasn't sure how much juice to allow for the 8 oz. But it was seriously delicious!

I thoroughly enjoyed this carrot cake. Like other reviewers, I didn’t add coconut but added more carrot. The only reason I didn’t give it four stars is because I really felt it needed a little bit of salt.

I’d like to preface my review by saying that I’m almost certain I would have rated this cake 5 stars even without the changes I made. I like my food in excess so that means I always modify recipes by adding extra ingredients. The changes I made were adding a lot more nuts than the recipe calls for (I used pecans), an extra cup of carrots, a 20 oz can of pineapple and 3/4 cup each of white and brown sugar. 
The cake was INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS and moist. I think that the changes I made just gave the cake extra texture. I’m pretty sure the cake would have been just as moist and scrumptious without my changes. It’s very moist and flavorful without being unnecessarily sweet (and I love unnecessarily sweet!) I used the cream cheese frosting II from the site. The sweetness works perfectly with this cake. 
This is, by far, the best carrot cake I’ve ever had!

I didn't have crushed pineapple, so I chopped the rings in the blender.  Guessed at the 8-oz. but may have been a little more.  I also plumped the raisins before adding.  This is the best carrot cake  I have ever had.

I made this for my mom and grandparents recently. Usually they usually find something they don't like with anything I cook. But with this recipe they unanimously declared that this was the best carrot cake they'd ever eaten. I even got a request to make it again for Christmas dinner. I've also had to pass the recipe around church quite a bit.

The only constructive comment I have for people new to this recipe is that it does not slide out of the pan easily. It's dense, moist, and a bit sticky. Flour your pans extremely well. Better yet, line the bottom with parchment or wax paper.  I like to make it as a round layered cake, and I've had to glue it back together with icing more than once after it broke apart during removal from the pans.  A botched cake dump, is not a total waste however, as the moistness, flavor, and density of this cake means it makes extra tasty cake balls. Just squeeze the broken bits into tight balls, freeze them until hard, and roll them in cream cheese frosting.

Third time I've made this incredible cake.  In our baking we use double strength Madagascar vanilla and Saigon cinnamon.  Frosting is a buttercream with extra double strength Madagascar vanilla including lots of the little seeds. Mmmmmm!

I followed the recipe exactly , making sure to use the finest grater I had for the carrots. I topped it with the whip cream cream cheese frosting . It was a huge success !  
Watch the cook time , mine was done at 50 minutes .

Yes lord! This was so delicious. The only thing I did different was use pecans instead of walnuts. They really do go wonderfully with the sweetness of the carrots.

This recipe is definently the best carrot cake recipe ever! The cake turned out so moist and so gooodddd!! I baked the cakes in two 9 inch cake pans at 350 for 40 min. 

Changes I made:
2 cups of sugar instead of 1 1/2 
Extra walnuts!

For the frosting I used one stick of butter (8 tablespoons) and 2 8 oz packages of cream cheese. Beat those together till creamy and add sifted powdered sugar to your taste.  ( I eyeballed the amount of powderd sugar)

I've made this cake several times and my family LOVES it!  I don't change anything except maybe a smidge extra cinnamon and vanilla.  I also make buttermilk with vinegar and milk and soak the raisins in a little orange juice as suggested by another reviewer.  And I always make 2 rounds and decrease baking time.  Best carrot cake ever!

My mom requested carrot cake for her birthday. Since I love to cook, I volunteered to make her a homemade carrot cake. This was my first ever attempt at such a cake and oh boy was I glad I used this recipe! It turned out great!!!!! I followed the recipe as is, omitting only the raisins because some folks in our group do not like raisins. I baked in two 9” pans so I could make a round double tier cake with icing in the middle and on top.  I baked for 25 minutes in a convection bake oven. It turned out perfect!!! Thanks so much for sharing such a fabulous recipe!!!

I made this cake for my grandpa for Father’s Day. He LOVES carrot cake and he loved this one. I make a small 3 layer cake and a dozen cupcakes. So there’s a fair amount of batter. The cake it self is a little crumbly from all the raisins and pecans in it but with a little frosting it all held up fine. It’s definitely a DENSE cake. The pineapple makes it super moist and heavy so cupcake are pretty filling.  I’ll be keeping this recipe for future birthdays and father days.

Super yum. Used cup each butter and cream cheese with 2 cups powdered sugar plus tsp vanilla and or coconut extracts. Fresh pineapple. Plenty sweet even with half the sugar. Froze the cake for about 30 minutes before frosting. Will plan to make several times a year! Thanks

Made this for my husband’s birthday.  Rave reviews from all who tried it.  My husband doesn’t likeI realized I forgot to add the pineapple but it was still great and so totally moist. I used cream cheese frosting II for the frosting but it wasn’t quite enough to cover the layers, sides, and top. I ended up leaving the side “nude” and decorated the top with swirls. All in all, a keeper.

Best carrot cake recipe. Granted, also the only one I’ve ever tried. I made this for my sister-in-law’s engagement party. Not only was the cake absolutely delicious and perfectly moist, it held up really well for layering. Overall the cake had three tiers with two layers per tier. No issues. Definitely recommend making this!

I have made this cake twice. Followed recipe all the way. It's terrible to shred carrots it's a lot of ingredients but hands down the best! I will never buy carrot cake ever again. Just made it for my mom's birthday tomorrow, always a hit.

The most amazing, moist, flavorful carrot cake ever!  Best recipe and just the right amount of coconut, raisins, carrots and pineapple.  So many requests for the recipe and making it again this weekend!  Used just a basic cream cheese frosting from all recipes!  I love this recipe!

This is by far the best carrot cake recipe!  I did however, cut the sugar by 1/2 cup in the cake and by 1 cup in the frosting. 
I also used coconut oil (bring to a licquid in the microwave). 
I toasted the coconut in the cake and also put it on top of the frosting. You only need half the frosting recipe(3/4 at most) for the filling, top and a sides of the  two 9” layers. The cake is 
not high but dense, very moist and rich and served 10. Delicious!

I made this but only used a 1/4 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of apple sauce.  Used  1tsp. of apple pie seasoning. No raisins but it turned out so moist and so tasty.  Loved that frosting on top to. Making again this week-end for some friends to try, so much fun!!!

Loved it! My now 10 year old son asks me to make this every year for his birthday cake! I also cut the cinnamon in half and omitted the raisins. Made the cream cheese frosting II as well. We all agreed it tasted better the next day and we all liked it served chilled from the fridge.

Before you make this cake, read all of the least positive reviews, I really wish I had.  Very, very  disappointed!  From the 5 stars, I expected a great cake.  Doesn't taste like any carrot cake I have ever had, really thought it would be much sweeter with the pineapple and coconut, however, it is very bland, very dry, definitely won't ever make it again. So surprised by the people who gave it 5 stars, either they don't bake as often as I do, or they made serious adjustments to the recipe.   It also took a good amount of time to prepare.  A boxed cake would definitely taste better than this.

Soaked my raisins in orange juice while I prepared everything(drain).  added some lemon zest miked with the carrots(1/2 from one lemon), then used the juice to make the butter milk.  Heard lots of tips to add a bit of citrus.  I did one cup white sugar and 1/2cup brown (also from other tips).  and did 1/2 oil and 1/2 apple sauce..... I really don't like the heaviness of oil.

Great cake! If you are doing this as a layer cake, definitely do not use a mixer from the point that you add the dry ingredients. Mix it by hand. I’ve found that a 6 inch cake takes 35-40 minutes, a 4 inch cake takes 26-30 minutes. I leave out the raisins, as my family aren’t raisin fans, and it works fine. This is the cake that gets requested the most!

This is my first review and it is going to be a review of HOW THE RECIPE TASTES! This carrot cake is FABULOUS.  I made it for Easter and all family members now want it as their birthday cake.  But I am reviewing the recipe EXACTLY as written.  Because in my mind, that's what a review is.

Best carrot cake I've ever made, and pretty much the best the people I made it for ever had, they said. Of course I had to tweak it based on reviews! I used half whole wheat flour and half white. No coconut because the birthday gal doesn't like it, used an extra cup of carrots instead. Half brown sugar and half white. Half of a 20 Oz can of crushed pineapple with juice, soaked the raisins in the pineapple for a while. Zest from one large orange and a couple of T of the juice. Half a C of applesauce replacing half a C of the oil. 1 generous T of cinnamon, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 tsp each cloves, allspice, and cardamom. I lightly toasted and cooled the pecans. I followed the mixing directions, except mixing the nuts with a T of the dry ingredients and stirring them in last. Was done in 50 minutes in a metal 13x9" pan.
I used the Cream Cheese II recipe with 2 tsp vanilla and a box of powdered sugar. A comment said it was better the next day, so I made it the day before and refrigerated it until about an hour before eating. I did sprinkle some toasted chopped pecans and the zest of an orange on it before serving. Absolutely wonderful! And doing it the day before sure makes life easier on the day.

I made this cake for Easter. I increased portions a bit and made it 1.5 times the original size so that I could make a triple decker. It is a SUPER hearty cake. Not necessarily heavy, just lots of texture... nuts, pineapple, carrot, raisins, etc. We prefer desserts that aren’t too sweet and this one was perfect! Just remember to save room for it when you’re eating dinner!

I am thrilled how this cake turned out! It was the first time I ever made a carrot cake. I did make a couple of changes- I used 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar as some reviewers suggested. I reduced the coconut to 1/2 cup, because I didn't know if it was sweetened or unsweetened coconut being used ( I used sweetened)  and walnuts to 1/2 cup. I could only find a 20oz can of crushed pineapple, so I weighed out 8ozs and drained it slightly to reduce the chances of "soupy" mix. I baked it in two 9 in. rounds for 30 minutes. I used Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site and even my husband remarked how good the cake tasted- and he isn't even a carrot cake lover!!

My Mom has made this for me twice now with  Bob Redmills 1to1 gluten free flower (allergic to wheat) and it is so good! The frosting wasn't great in our opinion so the second time I used a maple cream cheese frosting and it was perfect. Best carrot cake ever.

I would give it negative 5 stars if I could.   I made this for Easter Sunday and followed the recipe exactly.  First of all cake fell apart, and then I tasted it---and it had a horrible taste.   It was very surprising to me that it taste bad, because individually, I love all the ingredients that it had.  Sad that I wasted my time and money on the ingredients.

A real winner for Easter Dinner!  Left out raisins and added 1/4 tsp. cloves is all I did differently. Used 8x12 glass pan and it was done in 50 minutes. It is delicious and everyone commented on how good it was. Recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thanks Sam & Family!

This was so delicious!  The only changes I made were to the added ingredients at the end of the recipe due to preferences.  Omitted the coconut, switched the walnuts to pecans due to allergy, and soaked the raisins in orange juice on the stove (as per another reviewers suggestion).  I replaced 2/3 of the oil with applesauce and it still came out so moist!   I feel this recipe would still be 5 stars without the small changes.  I baked in 2 x 9" round pans for 45 min.  Thank you for his fabulous family recipe

This was the best carrot cake I’ve ever made, and ever eaten for that matter—exactly as is!  And that’s saying something, as my mothers (now lost) recipe was the one that set the bar.  ‘Tis is every bit as good, if not better!! Total keeper, thanks so much for sharing.  This is one that has just now become this family’s tradition, too!!  
I used a simple cream cheese frosting (cream cheese frosting II on this site)

You really don't need any body else to tell you how wonderful this cake is, but da-hang I'm going to do it.  Its a wonderful explosion of flavor and textures in every bite.  My son says there's no reason to make any other cake again.  I made the recipe as written and it's great as is!  I used cream cheese frosting II with a little bit of lemon zest to brighten the flavor.  Now, I must talk to all the raisin haters out there in review world. What is wrong with you?  End of rant.  Just make the cake, your tummy will be happy!

The best ever carrot cake I have made! Reminded be of a plentiful fruit and nut Christmas cake, every bite explodes with a taste of wholesome goodness of carrots, raisins, pineapple, nuts! Did change one thing...substituted 1/2 white sugar for brown sugar. The recipe is a big cake, next time I will cut it in half if it is just my husband and I eating it. Topped the cake with cream cheese icing. (1 8oz package softened cream cheese, 1 cup icing sugar,  4 tbsp. softened butter, 3 tsps. vanilla extract...whipped with electric beaters) Finished topping the cake with lots of chopped walnuts

Made this vegan by subbing 1.5 eggs for flax egg and 1.5 eggs for Ener-G egg, and made buttermilk by mixing 3/4 c soymilk with a tsp apple cider vineger. Turned out great! Also, made it into cupcakes and got about 18 of them with one recipe, baked about 30 minutes.

Great flavor! Based on the crowd we were making for, we omitted raisins & coconut, added extra cup carrots. Cooked & cooled/frosted, according to directions, and while it seemed done-toothpick check- when we cut,  it did not have crumbly cake texture, almost seemed too moist/undercooked. Not sure what I did wrong, but it was still delish. I look forward to trying again & see if I can get it right!

Best corrupt cake I have ever made. Even my mother in law loved it. She hates carrot cake but she loved this one.

FOllOWED RECIPE 100%  Hopefully I can save someone the time and frustration of reading everyone's tweaks! This recipe works just fine as is! Very moist flavorful cake.  I didn't want big chunks so I ran carrots, nuts, coconut, pineapple and raisins in my food processor for 30 seconds.
That is a personal preference. Used carrot cake ll frosting recipe.

I used buttermilk substitute (3/4 cup of milk 2 1/4 tsp lemon juice, let sit 5 minutes) and added 1/8 tsp Nutmeg as suggested by another review. Fantastic!

I omitted coconut flakes, and I split it into two cakes but a very delicious cake. Such good idea to add pineapple, never made it like that before.

Surprised to say this cake didn’t turn out for me. Usually recipes with so much positive feedback work well but this cake was, as some noted, too busy and had trouble cooking within the allotted time. I might try it again in the future but in reality it’s a tad expensive to try and then have to discard...

Love this cake. I don't use nuts.  Will often use orange marmalade between the inside layers and a creamcheese frosting.

I had to cook it for longer and the pineapple sort of separated from the rest of the cake, however when I made this before it was perfect and it was a huge hit. I’m not sure what I did wrong this last time.

EXCELLENT CAKE! Made this cake exactly as the recipe calls for but cooked it in two 9" round pans for 40 minutes. Iced with whipped cream cream cheese icing recipe from this site. Can't go wrong with this one...

Love this recipe! Took some advice from other reviewers and altered the recipe slightly as follows:

- Omitted raisins (out of preference)
- Added 1/4 tsp nutmeg
- Substituted pecans instead of walnuts
- Added the zest of 1 orange
- Baked in two 9-inch round pans for approx. 35 mins

Everything else I followed according to the recipe! I layered this cake and frosted it using the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting recipe from this website. I finished it off by sprinkling crushed graham cracker around the edge of the top and putting halved pecans around the edge. This cake is delicious, not overly sweet (especially with the whipped frosting), and presents beautifully!

Made the cake just as instructed. Didn’t make any changes and it turned out perfect. One tip is to wrap and freeze the cake overnight and then let it thaw before frosting. Definitely helped keep the cake more moist when sitting on the counter for a couple of days.

This is the second time making this carrot cake. I followed the recipe exactly but added an 1/8 tsp of freshly grated nutmeg to the recipe and used coconut oil since I was all out of canola oil. I baked the batter in 2 - 9"  cake pans and baked for exactly 40 minutes at 350. Following the recommendation from other reviewers, I used Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site  and had just enough for a nice layer in the center and outside the whole cake. I only had 3/4 cup of pecans so I placed them around the cake and in the center and crushed up what was left and sprinkled on top. It's now in the fridge waiting to be given to the recipient for her birthday tomorrow. Thank you for a great recipe.

I made it according to ScotchGirl’s modifications and with her icing recipe and it was absolutely amazing. Best carrot cake my family and I have ever had. I’m an average gal with average cooking skills and this recipe with Scotchgirls’s modifications made me look like a chef! Thank you!!!

I followed the recipe exactly,but baking in two 8 x 8 pans as I didn’t have the suggested size.   Baking time was shortened to approximately 50 minutes.  I made cream cheese frosting but realized later the cake didn’t need it—it is delicious without. My husband pronounced it the best he ever had, including his mother’s!

This is by far the best carrot cake that I have ever tasted! Any time I make it I get loads of compliments. It's extremely moist and rich. Also, if you play your cards right this recipe can make exactly 3 dozen cupcakes. I baked my cupcakes at 350 for around 24 minutes.

The fam like it but I thought something was missing. Looked at other recipes and diff were nutmeg, all spice and ginger but since I already had made the cakes I needed another solution, Rum sauce. So made the rum sauce to pour over when serving, this is when I added nutmeg and all spice to the sauce and it was perfect.

This nailed my carrot cake crave! I topped it with “carrot cake frosting II” from this site and it was fab. I omitted the nuts (toddler has nut allergies), coconut and raisins. I can’t believe it, but I ran out of white sugar and only had about 1 cup of it, so the rest of the remaining sugar called for, I used brown. I’ll definitely be baking this recipe again! Thanks for sharing.

I make this cake twice a year for my kids' birthdays. They always request for this carrot cake and since it's easy to make and very tasty, I give in.

I make the cake with a few variations based on what I think my family might enjoy at that time. Making this yesterday, I made a few changes: reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup because it had enough sweetness from the pineapple, raisins, carrots, reduced the oil to 1/2 cup (next time I might try 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce), microwaved the raisins in pineapple juice to plump them up, reduced the cinnamon to 1 tsp and added 1/4 allspice and 1/4 nutmeg powder, made buttermilk with milk and lemon juice. I baked it in two 9 inch cake pans for 35 minutes and made a layer cake. 

I paired the cake with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site as other reviewers suggested. It was a hit. My guests wanted to take some home. I'll make it whenever I have guests and do not have time to be adventurous with my baking. Thank you for the recipe.

I never change a recipe the first time I make it, or how will you really know if you like it?  But.....  I had to omit the walnuts because my granddaughter is allergic to  them.  My son asked for a carrot cake for his birthday instead of a store bought cake. This is the one I decided to try.  I made it exactly as the recipe calls for except for excluding the walnuts.  There were 5 adults and my granddaughter and we all agreed this recipe was a keeper.  It was moist, had ample flavor and great texture.  This will be the only carrot cake recipe I use from now on.  Now of course we used the standard recipe for cream cheese frosting, as no carrot cake is complete without that!

This was great. I made it exactly as described. Really so easy to make. I love all the "stuff" in it -- raisins, carrots, nuts, walnuts, etc. I'm not giving it a 5 because it didn't knock socks off but was just really good. I made Cream cheese frosting !! and it was perfect with it. I made it in a 9 x 13 pan because that's the closest I had but it was fine. (Oh, and my cocounut was pretty old so if it was fresh it would have been even more moist!)

I made this recipe, taking out the extra things I didn't want (as I'm sure others do). Absolutely incredible! Everyone was very happy. So moist, so rustic and hearty.

I've made MANY carrot cakes and this is absolutely the best!
1 1/2 recipe will make a very impressive 3 layer cake.  My only change (and that was just for my personal taste preference) was to add a little nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice.

This was absolutely delicious and a big hit at our most recent dinner party. While I'm sure this would have been just as amazing without any substitutions I did make two based on personal preference. 1. I added 1/8 t Nutmeg and 2. I omitted the coconut. This is definitely a must make recipe

I made it and it was great.  I used pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had.  I also put a powder sugar icing on it.  Very good and easy

I've made at least five different carrot cake recipes over the years, and while I was very happy with a couple of them, this one had the WOW factor.  I didn't change a thing except add a bit more cinnamon.  The difference, I believe, is the coconut.  It adds so much moisture.  Don't leave it out even if you are not a coconut lover.  I sprinkled the top with a touch of coconut and walnuts.  No other recipe will do.  Love it!

I have been making carrot cakes for well over 40 years and I have tried almost every recipe out there.  I found my favorite recipe must have pineapple, coconut, and raisins.  When I saw this recipe, it piqued my interest as I've never seen a recipe call for buttermilk before.  I was intrigued . . . so I made it for an office party.  It was truly a hit . . but (blushing) most of my cakes usually ARE hits!  lol.  ANYway - I loved it and so did everyone else who loves carrot cake.  I usually sub part of my oil with applesauce - but other than that, I made it as written.   Whenever I make one for work, I put a sign stating - "This cake has carrots, pineapple, and raisins - eat only if you love a fabulous carrot cake!!!"   You'd be surprised how many people DON'T like carrot cake - and why should an awesome slice of cake not be savored by a carrot cake lover???  Thanks for an  really fabulous recipe  . .all those 5-star reviews are well deserved!!!  Honestly - if this didn't turn out for you, it was not the recipe's fault.  It is NOT oily, soggy, or lacking in flavor - it cannot be any of those.  Check your measurements and your oven temp - it's a lovely recipe!

I'm not a carrot cake fan, and I don't care for cream cheese icing. Because this is my husband's second favorite (red velvet is his first) type of cake, I made this --  it also gave me an opportunity to play with my new KitchenAid 7C food processor.

I followed/doubled this recipe with the alterations of simmering my raisins in orange juice, and frosted it with the butter, cream cheese, vanilla & almond extract another Reviewer recommended.

Husband and Daughter LOVED it, were highly complimentary, and this is now my go-to recipe for carrot cake. Thank you for sharing -- I had a small serving and have to admit, I liked it. A lot. That's a huge compliment coming from someone who doesn't like carrot cake.  For all you doubters out there -- stop. Just stop. And make the cake using this recipe!

Sam definitely knew how to make carrot cake! The cake is very moist and offers great texture. It has plenty of carrot. I did use pecan instead of walnut (personal preference) and left out the raisins all together. The cake was great. I used 2x 8" round pans and it was cooked in about 40 mins. Make sure to choose a good frosting that isn't too sweet. You won't want to conceal the flavor of this cake, trust me.

I wanted to make a special carrot cake for a friend. This looked like something tasty, and not the 'traditional' carrot cake.  Easy to make, but the pan listing was incorrect.  It needs a 9x12, NOT an 8x12. Luckily I checked it 16 minutes before it was timed to be done, and IT WAS DONE!  Had I baked it in the smaller dish it would have spilled over. Lots and lots of compliments, and all I came home with was an empty pan!

Sorry folks..... didn't like this one for carrot cake because the pineapple flavor took over.  It would make a great base for banana bread if you substituted bananas for the carrots.

Worked out better than expected bc the batter seemed watery & chunky at the same time, however, it came out delicious.  It's not too sweet either so it will balance out the cream cheese frosting!

Never made a carrot cake before, even though the men in my family love it as much as I do.  So decided to make it for my sons birthday.  It was a hit and there were requests for a repeat performance.  It did make a lot of frosting but it didn't go to waste - worked perfect on cupcakes!

I made this carrot cake for my boyfriend's birthday because he said carrot cake was his favorite. I've never made a carrot cake from scratch before. I followed the recipe as is and we were very pleased with the results. It was amazing. we all agreed that it was the best we've ever had. I made the cream cheese frosting that I usually make which is 1 bar of cream cheese, 1 stick of butter, 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and 1lb. of confectioners sugar. Thanks for sharing this wonderful cake recipe.

This was the best carrot cake I've ever had! I adjusted the sugar slightly(deducted about 1/4 cup). Also boiled  raisins in orange juice like another reviewer suggested. So easy, so delicious! Thank you!

I made the recipe just as Brian had submitted it as I was making it for him. This was my first time making a Carrot Cake.
It was by far the best Carrot Cake I have ever eaten. I was nervous as I wanted to make sure it was approved by Brian.

Excellent recipe. Substituted half of the oil and the pineapple with a jar of applesauce, and buttermilk was swapped with full fat milk soured with 1tbsp rice vinegar. Used 2.5 cups of carrots. Added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 3 tsp cinnamon.

This is the only recipe I'm ever going to use, for carrot cake. The only change I made was, milk with lemon, only because I ran out of buttermilk. I followed the recipe as written. Simply the best carrot cake.

The first day I made this carrot cake I almost threw it out.  The walnuts were bitter and the pineapple was overwhelming.  I was hesitant to waste all those ingredients, and I'm glad I put it back in the fridge overnight.  The next day everything had mellowed and it was great.  Even the grandkids liked it, and they don't normally like desserts with vegetables or nuts.  I didn't actually weigh it, but it's a really heavy cake.

Just made it.  Halved the recipe (used  1/4 cup oil, a bit more sugar than called for and correspondingly less flour plus skipped the pineapple and didn't have any walnuts on hand).  Pressed it into a greased/floured bread pan and it made a FANTASTIC sort of heavy sweet bread.   It still stuck a bit to the pan so be sure to cut around it with a knife and use a large thin spatula to make sure it's loose from the pan bottom.  Will definitely make it many more times!

I liked this recipe, but had to apply a bit of the knowledge that comes with experience to have a good result given that I had to reduce the recipe in half for we are not too many here. Thus,  my 4 stars rating.  I noticed that the batter was a little too watery, so I had to compensate by adding a few tablespoons of flour (approximately 4 tbsp.) and an extra pinch of baking soda to balance for the extra flour.  I also had to add a little bit of pecans as I ran short of walnuts. My only personal touch was a pinch of nutmeg. I followed the instructions to a T. the recipe yielded 12 nice cupcakes and a small round cake of 6 inches. As someone mentioned, the flavor develops especially the next day. It was very tasty, moist, and not too sweet,eggy, or oil tasting.  All of the aforementioned are the shortcomings that I find/found in all the other carrot cake recipes I have tried over the years. This definitely is worth to make again. Try it and follow your instinct. This is an excellent recipe but I must say that it is for the experienced.

There are no words!  Absolutely FANTASTIC!  I reduced the amount of cinnamon as others had suggested and added a tsp of nutmeg.  I think it would have been ok with all of the cinnamon added.  I didn't add the raisins and used pecans instead of walnuts.  This was the first carrot cake I had ever made.  It was so moist!  Really very good and not hard to make.

I made this cake twice for my Aunts birthday. She loves Carrot Cake. It has to be the best Carrot Cake that I have ever tasted. I made it into two 9" round  pans. It was baked in 28 min at 350 degrees.

I alter every recipe, including this one, but it is fantastic and highly coveted when I make it. People who don't love carrot cake, love my version of Sam's. One of my tricks is to shred the pineapple and carrots in the food processor together and Then let the carrot soak in the pineapple juice for about 10 min before mixing with the batter. I also leave out the raisins and sub pecans for walnuts.

Absolutely loved this recipe!  I soaked the golden raisins in hot pineapple juice and this gave them a head start on getting plump.   My biggest suggestion would be:   If you use a food processor to grate the carrots, I would then use the food processor with the chopping blade to even chop them more.  Either that or use the small grater portion on your stand up grater.  I found the carrots to be a bit too stringy and hard when using the grated carrots that I processed only on with the grater.
I did omit the nuts due to food allergies.
This cake is MOIST and delicious!

Only modification was I used 1 cup sugar instead of 1-1/2 cups. I use less sugar in all the recipes. This recipe is absolutely delicious and exactly what I look for in carrot cake. In my opinion it doesn't even need frosting, and I LUV frosting! I like the fact that it has a lot going on in the cake! Great job Sam!

this carrot cake is amazing.   Skipped the coconut, and used pecans instead of walnuts.  Added a little allspice and nutmeg.   i baked in 20 individual ramekins.  Let sit a day for flavors to blend.  Frosted with cream cheese frosting II.

Delicious and moist. I omitted the raisins and swapped pecans for walnuts as one reviewer suggested. I used the cream cheese frosting recipe that's on the major cream cheese brand's website, but doubled the vanilla extract in the frosting for a little more depth of flavor. It was perfect and delicious!

Giving it 5 stars bc I made it just as the recipe said and it was delicious! The only thing I did different was I baked it in 3-9" round pans for 27mins bc I wanted a layer cake. I used the "whipped cream cream cheese frosting" recipe found on this site and it was a HUGE hit. Everyone at Easter dinner loved it. This will definitely be my go-to carrot cake recipe!

The first time I made this cake, it was for a bake sale.  I was told it was good.  So for Easter, I made this for my family.   I loved it!  Everyone else said it was really great.  I used golden raisins just as a preference.  I used a 9x13 pan because that's all I have.  It took about 50 minutes to bake.  I will make again for us and another make bake sale next month.

Made this cake for Easter today and the family raved about it.  Like others, I made it in (2) 9" cake pans and frosted it with the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe.  Subbed pecans for the walnuts and omitted the raisins.  Definitely a keeper!

Before I go any further into this review, I wanted to preface it by saying I did not follow the recipe exactly.  I left out the raisins, coconut, and walnuts.  Everything else was exactly the same:  items and quantities.  This carrot cake was an absolute hit at Easter dinner!  It was so moist!  I had never added pineapple to carrot cake before--I was worried the flavor of the cake would change.  I was pleasantly surprised, however.  My mother is a carrot cake traditionalist, and I'm going to serve this to her for her birthday without telling her what's in it and see what she says.  I also made this with the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting available on this website.

This cake is great.  The first time i tried it I made it exactly as is so I can gauge any changes I wanted to make.  Traditionally Carrot Cake is considered a spice cake so this time around I cut the cinnamon down to 1tsp and added nutmeg and allspice.  I also cut the oil by adding 4oz carrot baby food.  I didn't add raisins or coconut and replaced the walnuts with pecans.  I made a lemon zest cream cheese frosting to offset the sweetness of the cake.  The original recipe  is great as is but this recipe also allows for some creativity.  The key ingredient in this cake is the pineapple so please don't leave out that.

This is by far THE best carrot cake recipe ever. I've been told so by so many people!!! I don't do nuts or raisins tho.  I love this cake. DELICIOUS! If you aren't a baker I could see where it would turn out not so good because it is a bit involved, but any bad reviews....I'm sorry it's you! Not the recipe! Thank you so much! Been making it for 10 years now. Just again enjoyed it for my sons birthday. Oh-and PLEASE....don't be use canned icing. It deserves homemade cream cheese icing.

It's excellent, except too sweet for me. I reduce the sugar to half in consideration there's sugar in pineapple.
I'll make it again & again.
Thanks a lot for sharing this recipe.

Fantastic recipe. I've been making this cake for years. I omit the nuts and raisins and add a dash of nutmeg and allspice. Bake it in 2, 8 inch round pans for 45 mins. Top with cream cheese icing, crack a bottle of red...and enjoy. Tonight I'm adding white chocolate chips...

I hated the pineapple in this. It totally overwhelmed any other flavours. The only modification I did was reducing the sugar which I always do.

Wonderful recipe, very close to my mom's. Only change was half brown, half white sugar and I decreased the cinnamon to one tsp. and added one tsp. of nutmeg - those were from my mom's recipe. Oh wait, probably half cup or so more carrots. Other than that, no changes. I hadn't used buttermilk before and other recipes have one more egg and more oil. I think this might have a few less calories because of that, so pile on the frosting! VERY moist and flavorful, I had a hankerin' for carrot cake and this fit the bill. Will definitely use again.

It was delicious.  My husband (also named Sam!) really enjoyed it as his birthday cake.

The only change I made to the recipe was a substitution for buttermilk that I didn't? have on hand.  I believe it was 1 cup of milk with a tablespoon of lemon juice.  I also omitted the raisins.

I also put half of the mix in a bundt pan, the other half in 4 mini loaves to freeze for later.  I used the cream cheese frosting II as suggested by others.  I topped it with pecans.  I will definitely be making this again!

I have now made  this twice.  I wanted to try it before making for Easter.  It is wonderful!!  First time I made it I followed some of the suggestions of  less cinnamon and no raisins.  Second time made it just as the recipe is written.  Both my husband and I like it much better with the raisins and cinnamon as suggested.  Will keep this recipe as a favorite.  Thank you Sam!

I also did use the food processor to shred the carrots.  I worked just fine.  I did cut the carrots in to 3 smaller pieces so I would not have long strings of carrots.

This is an outstanding cake.  I did not modify or change a thing very moist.  This cake does not have a frosting in this recipe I believe "Sam" served it that way.  It is incredible w/o frosting and just as yummy with a cream cheese frosting.

I've been making this recipe for about 5 years - finally remembering to review it!  Best carrot cake ever. I make it to take to work, and everyone RAVES about it. I do leave out the coconut, and don't miss it.  I top it with a basic cream cheese frosting, into which I stir some chopped walnuts.

Great recipe.  Because of a couple reviews stating they could taste the oil, I used 1/8 cup oil and made up the difference with unsweetened applesauce to total the 3/4 cup in the recipe, as suggested by one reviewer.  I also used only 1 cup of sugar but next time will use 1  1/2 cups of sugar.  I have no doubt that making the recipe without the changes would  be delicious.  This cake actually does taste better the next day so it could be made the day before a  busy event or holiday.  I baked our cake in a tube pan for 53 minutes.

My son's girlfriend is gluten intolerant, so I made this using Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 GF flour. It was terrific.  No one noticed any difference just that the cake was wonderful.

Absolutely wonderful!  I was searching for a carrot cupcake recipe and couldn't find any that included everything I wanted.  The only changes I made were on the fly for personal preference, not to change the integrity of the recipe.  I replaced the vegetable oil with coconut oil, which I then decided to cut back the sugar to 1 cup since everything else would make it plenty sweet, and only put a small amount of chopped walnuts because  I was running low.  Like another review, I made my own buttermilk with 3/4 tbsp of white vinegar.  Since I was making cupcakes, I baked at 350 for 25 minutes and it made 24 perfectly.  I also decided to make the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site per some other reviews, but beware that it makes a TON, I still have so much left over!  The end result was everything a carrot cupcake should be.  I brought these to work today for a special Valentine's Day treat.

To me this is one of the best cakes I know. It's sweet, but not too sweet, it's fruity, it's moist, it's complex. I made it a couple of times in the past year and everyone loves it. 
Unfortunately I don't get vanilla extract here in Germany, so I use freshly grated vanilla. 
I always add a frosting made with cream cheese, a little butter and a little icing sugar. The frosting still has to be sour in order to contrast the sweet cake. That way it's perfect. 

Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.

I made it in two layers for my grandson's 18th birthday and it was a hit!  I did leave out the nuts and raisins because a couple of family members do not care for them, and it was delicious anyway. Oh, and I put in 3 cups of carrots since I left out the  nuts and raisins.   I do think the nuts and raisins would have probably made it even better.  (If that's possible)  Yum! Everyone loved it.  My son in law said he does not  like carrot cake - but this one was a big exception since it was sooo good.   I made the traditional cream cheese frosting and it worked perfectly and looked lovely.

Great recipe. Made it per the recipe but added nutmeg. My husband and son who love carrot cake were very happy indeed. Will probably reduce the sugar a little next time I make it. This is my new  go to recipe.

this is my favorite carrot cake. I like to bump up the spices, though, maybe extra cinnamon and add some ginger. Also if you cut back on the sugar a little, the family might not notice. Yum! definitely frost with cream cheese frosting (NOT a can, please: gag, and heart attack), maybe with a little orange zest.  Thanks so much!

I have made this cake a few times and this last time served without frosting as a light weekday desert.  Made in a loaf pan.  It was delicious on its own.  Didn't have buttermilk so made with milk and 1 teaspoon lemon juice.  Omitted the coconut flakes, otherwise made exactly as stated.  I hand grated the carrots (about 5 medium sized carrots - about 2 cups).

First carrot cake I ever made.  Used 1/2 cup  sugar, use coconut oil instead of veg oil. The cake came out super soft, did not rise much but taste very good.
Thank you for the recipe.

I made this once for Easter a few years back. Now, it is requested for EVERY holiday lol! I make it exactly as written and use the Cream Cheese frosting II recipe located here to go with it. Super delicious, can't say enough good things about it :)

This is the best Carrot Cake I've ever made. Everyone loves it!

I soak the raisins in a bowl of water for about 5 minutes before adding them to the mix. It makes them extra plump and moist!

I made three round 8-inch cakes and then layered and frosted with cream cheese frosting. Fabulous! Everyone raved about this wonderful cake. Definitely a new family favorite.

I used scotchgirl's modifications and it was one of the best things I've ever baked. Coworkers loved it, I'll make it again for my family this Christmas. I don't normally like cake at all (I bake them because I enjoy decorating them and my friends enjoy eating them) but I have to make an exception for this one.

I have made this twice now.  Came out perfect each time!  It is without question, the best carrot cake we've ever had.  I have tried other carrot cake recipes, but the others were too heavy and not sweet enough.  Like I said, this one was perfect, and given 5 stars by everyone in the family.

This carrot cake came out very moist and flavorful. I did need to add nutmeg and next time more carrots. I also added one ripe banana for extra moisture. Will make again.

Sorry, I wanted to love it, but I guess I'm a traditional girl. I actually made the cake for my mom, so it was also her opinion that I stick to my regular recipe. Of course, it still all got eaten though! ;-)

Everyone loved this cake, but I used my own buttercream cream cheese icing. I also have to admit that I altered the recipe significantly, because the ingredients appeared to have over powered the cake. I did use 1.5 cups of carrot and it gave it that soapy taste some carrot cakes can get, so next time I will scale it down to 3/4 cups, I used only 1/4 of the pineapple and about less than half of raisin ration cited. Finally about  about 6 pinches of the coconut flakes. I also used a light buttermilk and used sugar to taste. It just seemed the flour ratio to the other ingredients ratio was a bit off. 
By making the changes I made the cake was rich and moist and just the right color and no one ingredient overpowered the other. I gave it a four only because I felt using the measurements to the letter would not have resulted in a good outcome and the actual taste of cake would have been lost in the pineapple and carrots, raisins and walnuts.

I love to bake and this is one of the best cake's I've ever made. I brought it to work to celebrate October birthdays and it was literally gone in 10 minutes. I did a 2-layer round cake with the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site and it was amazing!

I followed the recipe except no pineapple because I just don't like pineapple in my cake. It turned out dry and I'm not sure if that's why. It had a good taste though.

Loved it!  I  finely chop the carrots ( per user suggestion) and added a bit more spice and salt .  I  chopped up some of the canned pineapple chunks I had on hand  and added  about 1 T. pineapple juice to equal  8 ounces.  I love the spongy texture this produced;  didn't think the cake was too oily or too sweet.  In a glass pan,  it was done at 55 minutes.

Very delicious. Very dense, didn't rise at all. I didn't cook it as long as directions stated, in 2-9" rounds. I didn't have coconut, so I added more carrots. Still very good.

I made this exactly as written and it came out awesome!  Even my father who doesn't really care for carrot cake thought it was great.  This will be the only carrot cake recipe I will ever make.  The pineapple and the coconut really made it flavorful.  Loved it!

I made it in 6 in round cake pans, 3 of them. baked about 45 minutes. I frosted it with basic cream cheese frosting. DELICIOUS. I did put gourmet raisins in and they were to large. Next time just sunmaid raisins in, also I would use pecan instead of walnuts. I would make it again and again. I. love it. moist firm and tender.

I loved this and made it exactly as written.  We thought it was better after being refrigerated over night.  I think next time I will add more spice such as some clove and nutmeg but that is just personal preference.  I liked this because it is not overly sweet.  Just perfect.

I love this recipe and use Cream Cheese Frosting  2. My co-workers go nuts for it and I believe one person licked the empty pan.  Have also made it in 2 9 inch cake pans and put a cheesecake in the middle as the third layer before frosting it. So yummy and so easy!!

This is a terrific cake! The only modification I made was using milk instead of buttermilk and it still turned out amazing! I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site for the icing, as suggested by another reviewer and sprinkled some crushed walnuts on top. Next time I'm probably going to cut down to half of the ingredients and make a batch of cupcakes, as the recipe as it is yields enough for a very hearty cake!

Excellent recipe! I made cupcakes (25 min) and a loaf cake (45 minutes) I didn't change anything about the measurements except I left out the raisins and added a little nutmeg and allspice cause I like it that way. I am going to be frosting it with cream cheese frosting with orange zest added in, but I ate one of the "naked muffins" for breakfast and it was great. This is exactly what I was looking for in a carrot cake recipe. It's dense, moist, not too sweet, not too greasy. The salt balances the flavors and brings everything out!

Delicious! All family loved it! I had to hide it so we would not eat it the same night I baked it. The only thing I added was a 1/2 cup of applesauce and this cake was super moist!

This is the best carrot cake ever! I didn't change anything except I used gluten free flour and chose to make cupcakes instead. Thirty minutes in oven. They are so moist I worried that they weren't done at first...but they were....just absolutely AMAZING! I used cream cheese frosting II from this site. You could sell these. I've never tasted anywhere near this yummy in store or bakery. Thank you for sharing!

Made this twice, the first time I left out walnuts and coconut (for a food allergy)  and the second time made it exactly as written. I preferred the first one made so maybe will make it with a reduced amount of raisins and walnuts. I prefer a cake without too much 'stuff' in it, but everyone else absolutely loved this cake. I got complements on it even weeks later!

I made this for Father's Day because my dad loves carrot cake.
He said it was marvelous but I thought it was slightly dry so I think you should add maybe some  butter.Other than that,my family and I enjoyed this cake.

This is definitely my go-to carrot cake recipe. So, so good! Moist, not too sweet, and chock full of goodies! I just used the (1 lb.) bag of carrots, rather than measure the 2 cups and I used Penzey's cake spice in place of the cinnamon. I also increased the salt to a scant 1/2 tsp. I baked in a 9x13 pan, frosted with my own buttercream-cheese frosting. My whole family loves this cake!

I've made this three times now with great kudos from all. I used a bunt pan for my cakes. You will have to increase the bake time to about an hour. Also, I topped the batter with finely chopped nuts and a generous sprinkling of Demerara sugar. That becomes the bottom of the cake and is a nice crunchy foundation for the bunt cake. I used the cream cheese lemon icing using  lemon zest, powdered sugar, half the amount of cream cheese, and only lemon juice for the liquid. Yum!

BEST.CAKE.EVER.  I have made this cake many times, exactly as the recipe states, and it is perfect.  My FIL has Alzheimers and can't remember a lot, but he remembers this cake and asks for it every time I visit.   On the other end of the spectrum, I supervise 100 college students who BEG for this cake (although they only get it on special occasions because I have to bake 4 at once;)  I forst with "Cream Cheese Frosting II" from this site.  Thanks, Brian!

I made this cake for a family gathering.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought the cake was too oily and dense.  But my family loved it.  Ate the whole thing in one day.  I guess can't argue with that kind of response.  So due to many requests, I will be making this cake again.  I think it helped to refrigerate the cake overnight before serving.

Made for Memorial Weekend Family raved how moist and yummy it was. I also used 3-cup of shredded carrots, I didn't have raisin on hand so I used dried cranberries soak them in a little orange juice. And it tasted wonderful. Used the Cream Cheese Frosting II. From All-Recipes.

I made this carrot cake for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it! 
The cake came out very moist. I didn't add the coconut and raisins because personally I'm not a fan but otherwise it was really great. Definitely making it again.

The only recipe I'm allowed to make for my husband's birthday.
I do add extra cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves and replace half the oil with applesauce. Add cream cheese frosting and you've hit the ball out of the park. Thank you, fabulous recipe!!

I will make this again and the family loved it.  Instead of double layer cake I made 24 cupcakes and frosted them with cream cheese frosting. I made these on a Thursday and 3 days latter there are only 10 left (there are only 4 people here to enjoy them) and I would say they are a success.

Moist and not too sweet. I did not use pineapple, raisins, or walnuts and increased the carrots to 3 cups as another reviewer suggested. Next time I'll add little nutmeg as also suggested. This was my first carrot cake and it was a total success!

Wow. This was delicious. I followed this to a T, with the exception of halfing the amount of cinnamon and adding 1 teaspoon nutmeg. I don't have buttermilk as its not lactose intolerant, so I just used our lactose free milk with 2 teaspoons of lemon juice. Will definitely use this again! For those that need a lactose free frosting, I used the following frosting recipe from Carrot Cake III and used lactose free ingredients: 1/2 cup smart balance butter stick, 8oz Daiya cream cheese, 4 cups powdered sugar, and 2 teaspoons vanilla. Mix well until smooth. It tasted just like regular frosting. Can use less sugar if desired.

I  personally did not like the pineapple and coconut.  Next time just carrots...too moist & need more cake like for family personal preference.

We loved loved this recipe!!!! The only changes I made was I omitted the raisins and made it in 2- 9 inch cake pans.  The approx baking time was about 40 minutes. My Boyfriend said this is the best carrot cake he has ever eaten!! As other viewers suggested I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site...delicious!!

This was a good cake but a little dry- I would have preferred it to be a little denser and moist. Everyone enjoyed it but nobody "raved" about it as they have the other carrot cake recipe I've tried.

Made it this past Easter with Cream Cheese Frosting II. Followed recipe exactly. Really, really good and will make again.  Mine was a bit overcooked but still delicious. My oven runs hot and I knew I should have lessened the time a few minutes.

Absolutely delicious!  Made this for Easter and got so many compliments.  Very moist and flavorful.  The only modification I made was to leave out the nuts since my daughter is allergic.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a "T".  I iced it with Allrececipe.com's Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe and it was delicious!  I will definitely make this again.

Made exactly as written, except used pecans instead of walnuts and frosted with a cream cheese buttercream frosting.  Very good, but I like a little more spice.

I have made this several times now. The first time I made it as written,  aside from the coconut (we don't like coconut) it was very good. Got rave reviews from my coworkers. 
I felt it was missing something  little. I made ONE change, I did one cup white sugar the rest in brown sugar.  I did like the cake much more with that small change. and again rave reviews! Super easy to make, super moist! 
Thank you for sharing your recipe with us! it is outstanding!

Absolute perfection!  Only change I made was to use dried cranberries (as suggested by Trishia) in place of raisins, which I do not like.  It was divine . . . so moist & rich without being too sweet!

Delicious!. The only alteration I made was leaving out the raisins...just a personal preference. I topped it with coconut cream cheese icing(also on this site), and it was perfect. Everyone raved about it. I have no idea how anyone can mark this lower than a perfect 5 stars!!!

I have never made a carrot cake before. I made this cake and it really deserves 5 stars.  It is absolutely delicious. The only things I did differently were to use 1/2 cup vegetable oil and a 1/4 cup applesauce and drained the pineapple juice and used more applesauce (2 tablespoons).  I used pecans instead of walnuts and left out the raisins.  I will make this cake for all holidays and special occasions.  I can't wait to make it for my family reunion in July 2016. Thank you for sharing the love through the tummy!!!!

I followed this recipe exactly except I put it in 2, 9 inch round pans and made a layered cake. I cooked the cake at 350 for about 40 min and it turned out great. The only reson I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was I thought there was too much going on in the cake. Next time I would put less cocont, raisins and nuts. I frosted mine with cream cheese frost and topped with pecans. I will make this again.

THE best carrot cake ive ever had! I didn't change the recipe at all, and it was absolutely perfect. I made it for Easter dinner dessert, and my company all loved it. Only thing I did differently, was bake it in two 9inch pans for 45mins.

This is  my  "go-to" recipe for carrot cake.  I have prepared this recipe  numerous times over the years.  Having tried many carrot cake recipes , this is by far the best of all.  An excellent recipe that also includes the addition of coconut and pineapple.  I usually decrease the raisins to about 1/3 cup and sometimes I just sprinkle pecans or walnuts on top of the frosting  instead of  adding them to the batter.  This recipe is most deserving of the 5 star status that most of reviewers give it!!

Since I started using this carrot cake recipe several years ago, I've gotten many requests to bring it to different occasions. I use the coconut-cream cheese frosting recipe (minus the artificial coconut extract) with it and everyone tells me it's the best carrot cake they've ever had. I don't really care for all of the pineapple and raisins in it, but others do so I add them. The coconut-cream cheese frosting really makes it perfect.

Great base recipe... I exchanged the oil for butter, and increased the sugar to 2 cups. Also, I used fresh pineapples crushed in the blender. I omitted the raisins and walnuts so my 1 year old could safely eat. The cake turned out delicious!

I guess our oven is pretty hot because we didn't need to cook it for 1hr...closer to 45 min. Thankfully didn't overcook it. It's a very delicious cake!!! I'll make it again for sure

This was wonderful; the texture was beautiful too. I added a bit of ginger to enhance the taste of the cinnamon. And I made homemade cream cheese using 1/4 block of philedelphia cream cheese (heat it a bit until softened) added 1 and 1/2  tablespoon milk and 3 teaspoons of sugar (or until sweetened to your personal taste). it was WONDERFUL!!!!!

I re-hydrated the raisins in orange juice and toasted the nuts to bring out their flavor.  I made this for my mom's 60th Birthday and it was very moist and was getting rave reviews from some of our older generation guests at her party.  I am making it again for my in-laws  39th Anniversary!   Definitely a keeper!!

Carrot cake is my husband's favorite cake. Until now, I could just take it or leave it. This definitely the best carrot cake we've ever had. I did make a substitution since my family has some milk allergies.  I used 3/4 cup unsweetened coconut milk with 2 tbsp vinegar instead of buttermilk.  I also cut the sugar down to only one cup since I used sweetened coconut flakes.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

I was thorough in reading reviews for any helpful tips or correcting misleading comments. I followed the recipe exactly and followed the tips of straining excess water from carrots and using pecans instead of walnuts. Perfect!  I had saved several other carrot cake recipes but recently deleted them because they're not needed anymore!  Hands down awesome, tastes even better the next day. Also, used the same whipped cream cheese frosting that was recommended.

This really and truly is the BEST carrot cake I've ever had!  Ingredients wise, I made it exactly as written except left out the raisins because I don't like them.  Also, the 12 x 8 pan called for in the recipe was too small (batter spilled over the edges a little bit) so next time will use a 9 x 13 pan.  This cake was delicious, moist and has just the right amount of flavor balance.  If you make this, please don't change anything!

This  is hands down the BEST carrot cake recipe of all time. I love the compliments! I share the credit, but smile just the same. Very heavy, moist, dense cake, feeds a crowd. I use a 13x9 pan every time.

This recipe is spectacular! I've tried a couple different carrot cake recipes over the years and this was the best by far. I made this for a baby smash cake for his 1st birthday, omitting the raisons and nuts as requested by his mom. Also pulsed the carrots, coconut and pineapple together before adding to the batter, I think this was a nice touch to really mince and mix those items together.  Made into a two layer baby cake and also got 2 dozen cupcakes out of the rest. It tastes amazing, even without the frosting yet! This recipe has made a carrot cake fan out of me for sure.

This was my first attempt making a long time favorite recipe GLUTEN FREE by substituting "Cup 4 Cup" Flour. Divine....simple divine birthday cake for my GF son-in-law. I tweaked the spices by adding 1 t cardamom and 1/2  teaspoon nutmeg. I barely covered and soaked the golden raisins in a small glass bowl for about an hour in Myers Original Dark Rum. I added the small amount of leftover rum into the batter.
Topped with simple cream cheese frosting and grated orange peel. My guests did not believe it was GF and asked for the recipe.

I must admit I was a little scared to make this cake after reading some of the negative reviews but it was INCREDIBLE. I added the 1/8 tsp of nutmeg just to be safe. Again, I was afraid. Also I was very careful to use only the 8oz of pineapple called for of the 14oz can of crushed pineapple. AMAZING. The whole dinner party loved it. And the leftovers tonight were yummy.

I liked how this recipe turned out, I thought it was a nice, moist carrot cake. This recipe also allows for a good amount of personal substitution when playing with the recipe. I didn't use the Coconut, Pineapple, and Raisings because the person I made if for didn't like those ingredients however I agree that those ingredients would go very well with this recipe. I look forward to using this recipe as my base Carrot Cake recipe in future. Thank you for sharing.

Made 24 cupcakes, baked for 30 mins @350. Made some changes, no coconut, used pecans, 1 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 cup oil and 3cups of carrots and plumped raisins in pineapple juice. Wanted to use as bkfst muffins. They were very good, a little sweet for what I had wanted them for. Next time I will reduce sugar to 1 cup and possibly  a little less than 1/2 cup of oil. But overall a solid carrot cake recipe. Definite do over.

I was extremely impressed with this recipe. It requires a little work but the results won't disappoint. It's hands down much better than any store bought carrot cake, even from most bakeries. I think I saw this in another post but I'd recommend using the "Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting" (Yes, the title says Cream twice) recipe on allrecipes.com. Amazing.

I baked this cake for Christmas and I was not disappointed. The cake was super moist and the most delicious carrot cake I have ever eaten. I omitted the raisins (personal preference) but that was it. My daughter and my sister-in-law asked for the recipe.

I thought it was just okay. I've definitely have had better. I followed the recipe exactly except I added a pinch of nutmeg and I omitted the raisins. 

It's not super flavorful. They were cooked perfectly, but again, kinda bland.

I used freshly shredded carrots, even sifted my flour!

Followed the recipe to the letter and added the Cream Cheese II frosting. This carrot cake was a huge hit! One of my guests stated it was the best she ever tasted.

Good texture, richness and spice flavor (substituted 1/2 tsp cinnamon for 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/4 tsp nutmeg).  Pecans work well if you dislike walnuts.  For less calories, I used unsweetened applesauce, splenda, and 1/2 wheat flour.  Came out great and I feel less guilty eating a big piece!  Baked in 2 round cake pans for 40-45 minutes.

This was my very first carrot cake that I've made so I was a little worried that it wouldn't come out as well everyone else's that reviewed this cake.  I couldn't be more wrong. I made this for Thanksgiving yesterday and when it came time for dessert I was nervously awaiting the critiques of my family members.  I made this cake exactly as listed except for the buttermilk (I used regular milk with lemon juice as another reviewer mentioned) and it was a hit!  Everyone said I should make these cakes and sell them!  It was the best carrot cake I ever had!  It was soooo moist and flavorful!!  I do want to add for the readers contemplating making this cake that they will keep this recipe!  The batter will seem very loose but fear not, it will turn out perfectly!  Thank you for this recipe!!

I made it just like the recipe, and added a touch of almond with my vanilla to the cream cheese frosting. Just when I thought it couldn't be better,  I ate the leftover slice that had been in the 'fridge 2 days later and it was even more awesome!

This was the BEST carrot cake I've ever tasted! Cooking wise it took longer to cook than the recipe suggested (about 20 mins) but was moist and absolutely delicious.  Frosting I made was from this site, cream cheese, powered sugar and vanilla.  Everyone loved it.

This carrot cake was terrific!  It will become a family favorite. I adjusted it for high altitude (over 5000 ft) by increasing the temperature by 25 degrees, baking in 2 separate 9 in pans, decreasing the sugar by 2 Tablespoons, decreasing the baking soda by 1/4 teaspoon, increasing the buttermilk by 2 Tablespoons. It came out great.  My daughter is allergic to nuts so I increased the carrots by adding another 1/2 cup and excluded the nuts.  I also substituted 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for white.  It turned out as the best cake I have made!

Brian , I want to send you a big thank you for sharing your grandfather's carrot cake . I have truly never tasted one better. I made this for my family as is ( oops plumped the raisins with orange juice  not really sure that made a difference anyway besides the important thing is the raisins were still in there) Terry Berry Avex review was right on to the taste of this cake.  THIS CAKE IS NOT OILY. My family devours this cake when I make it.  I can't tell you how many people I have told or given this recipe  for them to try. When I think of carrot cake I think of Sam's .

I made this recipe with two very minor changes: left out the coconut and replaced with more carrots, and used pecans instead of walnuts. That's it! It was delicious and received tons of compliments. Of course, I topped with a cream cheese frosting from another recipe. I also used a 9x13 dish and it was ready much sooner than the recipe said (took about 45 minutes). I would definitely make this again.

Best ever!!!  I doubled this recipe and added raisins to one batch and left them out of the other.  I made 2 two-layer cakes for my sons birthday and it was loved by everyone!  I'll definitely make this again.
(I made cream cheese frosting and while it was delicious, it ended up a tad runny.)

This recipe produced a very moist and delicious carrot cake. I made the recipe just as written. The only difference is I split the batter and made it in two 9 inch round cake pans (took 45 min. to cook)  so I could make a double layer cake. It turned out amazing. I will make it again.

I made this recipe exactly as it was written and it was perfect, very moist and flavorful. I baked it in two round pans for 45-50 minutes, using the toothpick test to test for doneness. I frosted it with the Basic Cream Cheese Frosting recipe from this site, which was delicious (I did reduce the powdered sugar from 4 cups to 2 cups and it was plenty sweet.) Everyone who tasted this cake thought it was fantastic. A keeper!

Best carrot. Cake recipe I have found.  Ever.  My hubby loves carrot cake better than anything and of all the different recipes I have tried o er 22+ years of marriage, this is his favorite.  He wants no other now.  Add cream cheese icing with a hit of lemon juice and its perfect.  Have had a bunch of friends ask for the recipe too.  No complaints from anyone!

I made the cake exactly according to the recipe. 

Pros:  baked up with perfectly flat, uniform tops in 3 6" Wilton light-colored aluminum cake pans in about 45-50 minutes.  Release from the pans was effortless.    Dense texture makes it easy to transport.  All these things make assembling and decorating it a breeze. 

Cons:  The cake is oily to the touch.  No comment on taste yet, but I suspect it could benefit from a little less oil in the future.  We've put it in the refrigerator and waiting for the taste to develop over a day before cutting. I'll update the review then.

I changed it up to suit my taste. Used 1/4 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of apple sauce. Did not add pineapple, nuts or raisins Added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 cup of shredded coconut.  Reduced sugar to 3/4 cup as I do not like it too sweet.Very moist. It's a keeper.

First I want to say that I absolutely loved this recipe, and I wish I could give it five stars.  I made this cake because I didn't want the carrots I had laying around to go bad.  I had guests over and out of the five of us I was the only one who loved it.  Everyone else thought this cake was mediocre at best (mostly do to the "extra" ingredients they didn't feel should be in carrot cake).  They all hated the raisins, nor did they care for any of the other "extra" ingredients (coconut & pineapple).  However, I did love this recipe with all the "extra" ingredients.  The cake came out wonderfully, it was dense, moist and very flavorful.  I like a little spice to my carrot cakes so I did add 1/4tsp of nutmeg, and I used a vanilla buttercream instead of a cream cheese frosting.  If you haven't tried a carrot cake with a vanilla buttercream you really should give it a go, its much more subtle and allows the flavors of the carrot cake shine through.  Even though I can only give this 3 stars this will be my go recipe for carrot cake when I have a craving for it, just not when I'm making it for others.

Holly cannoli, this is the best carrot cake I've ever had and I've had a lot of carrot cake!  I made this for my daughter's 32nd birthday and even my 85 year old mother said it was the best she had ever eaten.  I made two changes based on the reviews I read.  I added 1/8 tsp of fresh ground nutmeg and I soaked the raisins in orange juice.  Everyone commented on how good the raisins tasted.  I made this in three, nine-inch pans, cooking at 325 degrees in a convection oven for 23 minutes.  They came out perfect.  I used the Cream cheese icing II recipe using 1 1/2 times the recipe.  Next time I'll double the icing because I really had to stretch it.  I'm sure this is amazing without icing too.  Needless to say, I will make this again.  If you are looking for the best carrot cake recipe, look no further.

The BEST carrot cake recipe that I have tried!! I made a few adjustments to the original. I used half whole wheat flour and I cut the sugar down to one cup. Instead of crushed pineapple, I used a cup of grated zucchini (that I had in my garden, along with the carrots). I also doubled the cinnamon. Added cream cheese icing and I can't get my husband to stay away from it!!!!

Made  this  a couple  of  times.  Last  time  no vanilla  extract  so I  used orange. Not  bad!  Almost  did this again but  had some on hand (vanilla ). If you  do use orange  just  a teaspoon  should  be enough.  Also  used fresh pineapple!  Less all over sugar  when  it's  fresh  pineapple.

Ok, I made the cake for my hubby's bday. He loves carrot cake, I HATE carrot cake. So the work was done by me, and the review is by the hubby and our friends.  I didn't change anything at all.  The hubby said it was very good, but next time go easy on the raisins. The friends LOVED it. Very moist, great flavor.  They don't like walnuts or coconut and still scarfed it down. So, good job, Sam!

Holy moly this cake is delicious! I made it in the form of a 2 layer round cake therefore I reduced the baking time to 30 min and it was perfect! For icing I used half vanilla buttercream and half cream cheese icing (I mixed them together). This cake is amazing!

Best Carrot Cake Ever. My family absolutely loved it. I made two modifications, instead of pineapple,  I added two ripe bananas. And instead of all purpose flour,  I added gluten free flour. And it still came out delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

Best carrot cake! However, I do think that all of the, "stuff" (walnuts, raisins, carrots, coconut, and pineapple needs to be ground up in a food processor. It was too chunky, especially the chopped walnuts, but the flavor was so good I still give it 5 stars.

This cake is fabulous. As many have said before, it's a wonderful carrot cake. It was my first attempt at carrot cake and my whole family loved it. I omitted the raisins and walnuts but would have followed the recipe exactly had I not been making Mother's Day dessert for a crowd. I didn't have buttermilk so I made my own with milk and vinegar. I also baked it in a 9x13 pan for 50 minutes. I will definitely make it again. I topped it with a delicious maple cream cheese frosting.

1) half a cup raisin instead of one cup
2)half a cup walnut instead of one cup almond.
3)one cup sugar instead of 1.5 cupz.

Absolutely wonderful. This carrot cake is moist and delicious. I had some pretty picky eaters that absolutely loved it! I did half the white sugar with brown sugar and added nutmeg. Also used canola instead of vegetable oil. Thanks!

This is the best for a gluten free adapting I have tried so far.
 I substituted Namaste perfect blend flour. I used 2oz lemon juice in milk for buttermilk and and extra 1/2 tsp of soda. It took longer to bake even in a convection oven and ceramic baking dish and turns out a little sticky as is common with gluten free flours.

I tried this recipe because of all the fabulous reviews, let me tell you that it was not disappointing at all. I made it for my husband who is a very picky eater and he loved it, but when my son who is an even pickier eater said he loved it, I knew this would be the recipe that I would keep for carrot cake.

Yummy!  I made them into muffins.  They don't raise a lot though.  I added some candies pineapple (because I had it).  I like raisins and microwaved them for 1.5 minutes with some brandy to hydrate them.  I would make them again for sure.

This needs to become my signature cake. Although it is a bit time consuming, it's sooooo worth it. Sure to impress with a cream cheese frosting. Natal helped me make this cake the first time and said it was "the best cake ever."

Plumped the raisins by boiling in OJ before adding as several reviews suggested. Husband would prefer without raisins, but I liked them.

I have made this cake several times.  I LOVE this cake! I make it exactly according to the recipe, except I omit the raisins (I'm not a fan of raisins). Topped with cream cheese icing, it couldn't be more perfect.   This has to be the best carrot cake ever!  I've eaten bakery carrot cakes and this puts them to shame.  Thanks for sharing this great cake recipe.

Thank you so much for posting it & for the reviews. I made this for my mother's birthday today, and everyone loved it! 
I used the suggestions too; 1tbsp lemon juice added to 3/4 cup of milk (instead of buttermilk), added 1/2tsp ground ginger & 1/2tsp nutmeg (in addition to the 2Tbsp of cinnamon) and increased grated carrot by 1/2 cup.
Cooked for 35 minutes in two 9" round cake pans @ 350'.  Test at 30 minutes with a cake tester!
This is a hearty & very moist carrot cake, full of flavour!!

So I have been trying to make a carrot cake for a long time but my hubby and daughter keep talking me out of it cus they say they don't like carrot cake.  I finally made this for Easter and OMG it was so so so good!  My hubby and daughter LOVE LOVE this cake.  I used a cream cheese frosting from this site (another thing my hubby "doesn't like") and they LOVED that as well.  I will for make this cake again and again!  I'm not a sweet eater but loved this cake cus it's not too sweet.  I'm so glad I found a carrot cake recipe that my family really likes.

For personal taste I omitted the raisins and used food processor to give all mix ins a finer consistency. This way there was all the flavor and no chunks. I also did add a little clove and nutmeg. 2 9 inch pans for 45 min. Delicious!

I have tried many carrot cakes and this by far was my favorite. I followed the recipe exactly except we did not add the nuts. I could have cook this for 50 minutes as 1 hour was a bit too long.

I made this cake for Easter dessert and it was  delicious!  The only thing I omitted was the raisins and it was perfect. It was not bland or oily as others stated. I made 2-9" round pans and they were done in 35 min. I used the cream cheese II frosting which was delicious! I will definitely make this cake agsin...received rave reviews.

Best carrot cake I've ever made! I didn't have crushed pineapple so I used a cup of applesauce. I also let the cake batter sit for an extra 10-15 minutes because my oven was slow to heat. I think that helped to plump up the raisins. I baked in a 9x13 pan for about 40 minutes. I iced the top with a mix of cream cheese, powdered sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice. The citrus gave it a nice touch.

The BEST carrot cake recipe you'll ever find or make! I followed the directions to the tee with the exception of recommendations from another reviewer to simmer the raisins in orange juice and adding 1/8 tsp nutmeg.  Absolutely delicious. I made this for my husbands birthday (carrot cake is his favorite) and everyone loved it! There were no leftovers! Even the kids loved it! This will definitely be in our family for years as the annual birthday cake and Easter cake tradition. Thank you for sharing!

I usually don't like to review a recipe and then change the whole thing, but I did!  We don't eat coconut, nor nuts, so then I had some fresh zuchinini slices, maybe 1/4 cup, so I threw them in!  My newest thing is adding  2 tbsp of Vanilla instant pudding mix into the mixture before you cook it.  I have never had so many raves about a cake!  I could hardly control my self from nibbling on it.  I'm making it again, but this time I'm insisting that my daughter take it home because this cake could be addicting.  The pudding adds some flavor, but Ohhhh the moisture is outstanding!  I did this vanilla custard to a pound cake and to chocolate chip cookies.  Guess it's my new favorite ingredient!  Yep, I know it adds calories and sugar, but hey! as long as I've gone this far, what the heck!

Have tried many carrot cake recipes. This one is the best!  Love all of the fruits/veggies/ nuts added. Only thing I change is I add a lil nutmeg. Have made as 2 layer& 3 layer cakes and as cupcakes. I love the cupcakes. Bake at 350 for 20 min and test with toothpick for doneness. I frost with either cinnamon cream cheese frosting or white chocolate cream cheese frosting. I also top frosting with toasted coconut. Delicious!

Adding to my original review because I just made it again. I also Sub 1/4 cup applesauce for 1/4 cup of the oil. Absolute best carrot cake I’ve ever had.

This cake is fantastic - that's all there is too it. It's my favorite cake, my family's favorite cake, my coworker's...and everyone requests it for EVERY holiday/get together. It's very most, bakes beautifully through (no hard edges). The only changes that I made were to add an extra cup of shredded carrots and omit the raisins (personal preference). The extra cup of carrots seems to make the cake even more moist. When I make this I usually bake it in 2 9" round pans for a double-layer cake. Otherwise, a lot of times I will make cupcakes and bake for 25-35 minutes. The time varies so much, so just use your baking eye to tell when they are done. I then use the Cream Cheese II recipe that everyone else seems to use and sometimes top with either candied walnuts, toasted coconut, or even candied ginger. YUM.

Wow!  I am not much of a baker and this is the only carrot cake I have ever made from scratch and it is AMAZING!  It was very simple to make.  I left out the raisins per everyone's reviews and also the coconut because I'm not a fan.  I made sure to grade the carrots so they wouldn't be too stringy.  It was super moist and delicious.  Everyone in my family loved it including my 3 year old daughter who is a super picky eater.  I made two 9in cakes and it took less cooking time, 35 minutes or so, just check with a toothpick.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!!!!

I made this cake along with another cream cheese icing recipe from allrecipes.com.  This cake had a wonderful flavor and texture! It was bakery-worthy for sure! The only thing I did differently was that I bought shredded badged carrots and then put them in the food processor to chop them up (I didn't want shreds of carrots in the cake and I didn't want them puréed either). It was a big hit. I baked it as a double-layer round with icing in the middle too.

Wow, very good...made as directed except for excluding the coconut (personal preference.)  Took advice of another baker and increased the carrot to 3 cups when omitting the coconut.  I'm sure it would be fine with 2 cups as well.  I used a 13 x 9 glass pan and baked at 350 for 45 min, very moist and delicious.

I am ashamed to say my partner and I ate this whole cake in less than a week. It's perfect. As others suggested, we used the "Cream Cheese Icing II" recipe on this site to frost two rounds, but we could've used a tad more icing in the middle. Moist and dense. Drained the pineapple and the carrots, and plumped the raisins in their discarded juice. I also added cinnamon, nutmeg, and a touch of cardamon because we like spice. VERY GOOD!

This is an amazing recipe. I've made 4 dozen muffins (this recipe makes 2 dozen at a time). They are irresistible and my family and company couldn't leave them alone. No icing needed.

I made this cake for my brother's wedding. In the process of making his wedding cake I made 4 different varieties for the bride and groom to try and this was the favourite by a long shot. The cake was moist and flavourful. All the wedding guests loved the cake and there was none left.

Best ever!!! So moist and tasty I used a cream cheese icing recipe from this site and added 1/4 teaspoon of lemon extracting and I still would but just a drop the citrus was a nice addition to a rich cake. Thanks for an awesome recipe

This is AMAZING!  I made my first carrot cake following this recipe for Easter dinner and my family LOVED it!!  it was so moist and delicious!  My husband is a HUGE carrot cake fan and I was worried about making this for the first time!  Not anymore!  Tip - if you make the 9" round cakes wait for the cakes to completely cool before icing.  I didn't do this on my dry run and the layers slid right off of each other and made a mess.  my boys ate it anyhow though and said it was great!  Gotta love those boys!  Thank you Brian for the wonderful recipe that I will enjoy making over and over!

YUM! My mom asked me to make carrot cake for her Bday. I wanted to make a completely from scratch cake similar to my grandmother's recipe and finally decided upon this one because of it's similarity to hers. While I thought this was VERY good, I do think I'll cut back on the carrots, fruit and nuts next time. I will also sub chopped pecans for walnuts (since I was making this to share, I went with the traditional walnut but actually prefer the taste of pecans). I really wanted to taste the cake itself, but there was just too much going on with each mouthful. Cutting the carrots, coconut and nuts by half and the raisins to a quarter cup would be much more to my liking. As I did this time, I'll continue to add 1/2 t ground nutmeg and 1/4 t ground cloves (I felt this needed a little more than just cinnamon). Since I do not own the pan size called for, I baked this in a 9 x 13 in. baking dish and reduced the total baking time to 45 minutes which worked great for me. All in all, this was quite tasty, especially when frosted with cream cheese frosting and sprinkled with toasted coconut! Too bad my carrot cake-hating husband missed out.... My parents and I thought this was the BOMB. :) Thanks for sharing your granddaddy's famous recipe, Brian!

I hate to say it, but this recipe is so much better then my cc that I have been making for 45 years. I have made twice now once exactly as written the second time I used golden raisins that I plump up it warm water.  The second time I didn't have buttermilk and the buttermilk is a must.  could tell the difference. Golden raisins were much tastier.  I also used a 9x13 pan and cooked for 40-45 mins.
used a cream cheese icing and had a cake that was addicting.  My husband ate almost the whole cake in two days ( I helped a little, lol)  Give this a try you will enjoy immensely

My husbands favorite is carrot cake, so I am always looking for a great one to try. He loved the fruit bits and it was really moist. The only thing I changed was omitting the walnuts.(He doesn't like those in his carrot cake) I think next time I might use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil only because it's healthier. I always try to make the recipes the same the first go round before I change anything. I'd make it again. I used the cream cheese frosting recipe from the Awesome Carrot Cake with cream cheese frosting found on Allrecipes. Perfection!

Excellent carrot cake. The only modification that I did was to add fresh grated coconut. I live in the Caribbean and dislike store bought coconut flakes. Instead I went outside and got 2 coconuts and grated them and cooked it down with 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup sugar for about 15 minutes. I added 1/4 tsp groung nutmeg and 1/8 tsp ground cloves. This cake was moist and very delicious. I took it to work and even collegues that do not like carrot cake gave it a thumbs up!

When I first looked at this, I had my doubts because there was so much in it.  But it is absolutely delicious!!!  I just didn't add the coconut because I can't stand coconut.  Everyone loved it!  I made t with a cream cheese frosting I found on here and it was perfect!

Delicious for sure...no doubt about it.  I chopped up the carrots a little more and next time I will chop the walnuts up a little smaller and add additional pineapple.  * I put the raisins in a small sauce pan and boiled for 10 minutes on low with a little bit of maple syrup and orange juice to plump them up...I will also chop them up a little next time for consistency's sake.  I used the Lemon Cream Cheese icing for the top.

This recipe is fantastic!! I used 3 cups of shredded carrots, some fresh grated nutmeg, a pinch of ginger powder, and some lemon zest. I omitted the raisins because I'm not a fan. Thanks so much for a great recipe. I also made a cream cheese frosting using a recipe from this site. Delicious!!

I didn't change a thing, and thought the cake turned out great.  It was my first ever carrot cake from scratch, and I found it to be surprisingly easy. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely perfect! I've made this many times, exactly as instructed. Well, except I make it in two circular pans and frost layers with a cream cheese frosting. It's our family favourite! Just plain excellent!

It was perfect!Based on other reviews I added 2 cups powdered confectioners sugar, 1/4 tsp nutmeg (could have added more maybe 1/2, 3 tsp cinnamon and 3 tsp vanilla. I'm not too fond of raisins so reduced them to 1/2 cup and soaked them in orange juice for 1/2 hour before adding. I used pecans instead of walnuts. Overall, just the carrot cake I wanted!

My family LOVES carrot cake. I made this cake for Christmas dinner and we finished it in 2 days, we were so sad it was gone, that we made another one! One of my aunts who always makes a carrot cake for Thanksgiving got a phone call from another aunt that she needed to get my recipe (that aunt likes to make trouble though!) 

The only thing I did different from the recipe was omit the nuts, my dad hates them. With or without them though, this is the best darn carrot cake I've ever had!!

The first day I made the cake I hated it and I felt like it has too much stuff in it and  I  could feel the carrots , the cake was also bland . The next day it got better but the third day in the refrigerator it got way much butter and I couldn't see the carrots and and every thing  absorbed by the cake  . The only change i've made is adding 1/4 tsp nutmeg

I have been hanging around All Recipes for a long, long time now. So many great recipes, so many wonderful tips from everyone to make them even better! I really feel like I know a lot of the contributors! I FINALLY JOINED myself, just to rate this recipe! I did a half version (10 servings) just to try it out. I used a combo of walnuts/pecans and in place of the buttermilk, used milk with about a 1 tsp vinegar. I chose to bake it in a 6 jumbo muffin pan (new size pan for me...love it) and also got 1 mini-loaf. I baked them about 23 minutes , and they came out perfect! I will make a cream cheese frosting later, but I was so desparate to have one like that, that I put some whipped cream cheese on top and sprinked with a good dose of confectioners sugar! Unbelieveably delicious cake! Thanks, Brian, for sharing your grandfather's recipe. It is sure a winner, like I'm sure he was, too!

In a word? Phenomenal!!!! Served this to a group of 60 people and many begged for the recipe saying it was the best cake they'd ever tasted. Made exactly as written except for the walnuts, which I didn't have on hand. Many thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This cake was so good. I followed the recipe as written except for the raisins. It was very moist like a tres leches cake. I made it in 2 round pans  and used the cream cheese II frosting from this site. I added pineapple juice to the frosting and it was fantastic. I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I will make this again and again!!!

Excellent recipe.  I use melted coconut oil added last & mixed in well rather than veg oil, and I have substituted gluten-free flour occasionally with no problems to the results. It also makes excellent muffins to send in lunch boxes without the frosting...

I brought this to a party and people said it was the best carrot cake they ever had. I didn't have buttermilk, so I substituted almond mild with a little lemon juice.  This is the kind of cake that you can't stop eating.

This cake is AMAZING! I always get great compliments. Follow the recipe exactly and you will not be disappointed. I have ommited the raisens or nuts a time or two due to dietary restrictions of those I have made it for and it turns out great no matter what. I even make it in one bowl instead of the three suggested and it comes out the same just follow the directions for the wet ingredients first, then the dry, followed by the chunky bits. Oh and I use golden raisens instead of regular as they are less overwhelming. Great cake. I will never use another carrot cake recipe this is the ONE!

Poppyseed & grated lemon or orange zest - i love the recipe and made it many times, using all kinds of sugar and oil, and wholemeal and white flour. I have also subbed Mascarpone cheese for the cream cheese frosting, which gives a lighter frosting that I like but my kids prefer the cream cheese so it depends on the person. I sometimes add poppyseed for some extra bite and grated orange or lemon zest to make it fresher. I can really recommend this! However, Sam's recipe is already perfect without it: my additions are a twist, not a change. He totally deserves 5 stars as the recipe always works, the cake is perfect, not dry and not mouldy, just moist! Thank you!

Ok well I don't know where I went wrong but my cake didn't rise.  IT was more of a dense rye bread than a cake and I was very disappointed with it.  I noticed there is no baking powder...did anyone else have the same problem.

OMG...I cannot believe that I have not reviewed this recipe yet (although my review is obviously not necessary since everyone agrees -- YUM YUM YUM). I have made it 3 times in the past month, if that's any indication. I replace some of the oil with natural applesauce (last batch: 1/4 c. oil and 1/2 c. applesauce, although next batch I'll be brave and try all applesauce) and there is no loss of moisture...just fat & calories. I also sometimes replace some of the white sugar with brown sugar (not sure if I can tell a difference). My family does not like raisins, so those are omitted. I use the Cream Cheese II frosting recipe from this site (with low fat cream cheese/Neufchatel)-- so so so good!

This was spectacular! I made this cake for a wedding, and paired it with the brown butter bourbon cream cheese frosting. The only changes I made were to add 1/4 tsp nutmeg as another reviewer recommended, and I soaked the raisins over night in brandy. This was phenomenal, and there was only enough cake left for the bride and groom's anniversary cake. Thank you for sharing this! I well keep this recipe close at hand, and it will be made often

Delicious!  I added a little more cinnamon, but everyone loved these!  I made them into cupcakes and reduced the baking time by half.  Several asked for the recipe, and that's always a plus.

I baked this cake on Tuesday; I followed the recipe as written, the only thing I left out was the walnuts (My husband doesn't care for walnuts.) Both my husband I loved it! We ate the last of the cake for breakfast this morning with a hot hot cup of coffee. My husband asked if I would bake another one today.  All I (WE) can say is that this is the best carrot cake I have ever baked!!! Moist, and very flavorful. Thank you for sharing!!! I will certainly bake this cake again and again.

This is the best carrot cake recipe by far.  It has everything, the only addition I made was from the advice of another reviewer...I added  a pinch of nutmeg and simmered the raisins in the pineapple juice to soften.  I have made this recipe at least ten times prior to this posting. Everyone loves it! Thank you Brian and of course Granpa Sam!!!

Okay - so I made a couple of changes to this recipe.  I used only 1/4 cup of vegetable oil and added 1/2 cup apple sauce.  I also used only half the amount of white sugar and added an equal amount of dark brown sugar.  I omitted the raisins and coconut as the Beau does not care for either of those - and this was to be his birthday cake.  For the icing, I doubled the amount but used 8 oz of cream cheese and 8 oz of mascarpone.  All to say - the cake was beyond fabulous and the flavor improved the next day.  The Beau took the remainder to work the next day - his team mates demolished the cake in short order.  Thanks for the recipe, Sam!

This recipe is much more than the standard spiced carrot cake because it has everything; nuts, raisins, coconut, and pineapple. I made the recipe as written, but would reduce the baking time to 40 minutes as an hour is much too long. I checked the cake after 50 minutes and the top was already too dark and it stuck to the glass Pyrex pan sprayed with Bakers Joy. If you don't like the texture of coconut in a cake, try pulsing it in a food processor to make smaller pieces and bring out the coconut flavor. I used one teas cinnamon rather than two, 1/2 teas nutmeg, and 1/4 teas cloves to balance the spice. I topped this with a very spreadable cream cheese frosting from Cooks Country: 8 oz cream cheese, 6 Tbsp butter, 1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar, and 1 teas vanilla. Thank you Brian for sharing your grandfather Sam's wonderful cake recipe. A keeper.

I don't like carrot cake (except for the cream cheese frosting - I usually scrape off the frosting and throw away the cake), but this was actually pretty good. A friend requested a carrot cake for his birthday so I selected this recipe and everyone raved about it. I made them into cupcakes (24) and made half with raisins and half without. I also ground the walnuts a little smaller because I also don't like walnuts in carrot cake. Anyway, everyone loved the cupcakes and I actually ate one as well (and enjoyed it). I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe.

I have made this fab recipe a number of times.  There was not much that I had to do to improve or change it.  But I did substitute golden raisins for regular raisins.  Made it in two layers, & used the frosting from one of my favorite cream cheese frosting's.   Thsi recipe is the best Carrot cake I have ever had!

It was good, but a little too "fruity" for me. Very moist & dense. I topped it with a whipped cream cheese frosting.

This recipe is amazing as is written. My only change was to soak the rasins in spiced rum until the were swollen the dump rasins an rum into batter. I also used the cream cheese frosting II as others did. I have made this recipe so many times layer cakes, cupcakes and sheet cakes it is always the first one one and the one everyone requests i bring.

This definitely up there with one of the best tasting carrot cakes I have ever had --- I consider myself an avid baker but never have attempted a carrot cake before.  My disappointment came with making it into cupcakes --- they stuck to the paper!!!  The taste was awesome, but they were a lot of work to get into!  My advice ... just use the recipe for a cake.  Also, I made the Cream Cheese frosting II from this site and about halfway through the frosting process, the frosting lost its consistency.  I'm still in search of the perfect cream cheese frosting for this cake.   I made it basically as written but did make a few of the suggested changes (less oil, added applesauce, put in some brown sugar, added more vanilla, added allspice and nutmeg (next time, I will add more allspice and nutmeg), and upped the carrots to 3 cups).

I made this exactly as directed and WOW! It was for my sister's birthday and my first time making carrot cake. It was so simple too which I found odd! Next time I make it I might scale back the raisins to a half a cup. It was moist and so flavorful! Thank you!!

Wow!  I'm thrilled.  This cake turnout delicious and moist.   Not being a baker a cake like carrot cake always seemed daunting but this turned out great, thank you Brian.  I did make some of the suggested changes, ie, 1 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar, boiled the raisins in oj (yum) and used almond milk with a tsp of lemon in place of buttermilk (lactose intolerant).  I will eat this cake without frosting, I frosted half for hubby.  Even after all the work I will be making this again, soon!

Wow! After making this cake you won't need to look for another carrot cake recipe again. It's the kind of cake that gets you compliments on the very first bite! I made it without icing and it's great that way. Next time I'd add a little fresh ginger and leave it in the oven an extra 5 minutes longer than the recipe suggests, but apart from that - excellent!! It's a neat way to use up leftover buttermilk too. :)

I really enjoyed this recipe and so did my boyfriend. I added some nutmeg and extra vanilla and omitted the raisins and walnuts but aside from that I followed the recipe. I used the cream cheese ll frosting that others recommended and it's perfect with this cake. One piece of advice, let the cake bake for the full hour. It may look done after a half hour because the cake is so dark in color and when you insert a toothpick it may come out clean but don't be fooled it's not done. I also wanted to mention that mine didn't rise too much when baking so if you plan to make cupcakes fill them more than you normally would. Loved this recipe. Will definitely be making it again.

This carrot cake is every bit as good as the 5* rating suggests. Scaled the recipe at 2/3’s, baked a 8½" x 4½" deep loaf for about 50 minutes and extra batter used to make a few 2½" x 4" mini-loaves (30 minute bake time). Grated the carrots as shown in the video rather than shredding them as indicated in the recipe. Since we have no dislike of specific ingredients, there was no need to change the recipe - - a nice blend of ingredients to produce a nicely textured, moist and tasty carrot cake. Frosted a couple mini-loaves w/ Cream Cheese Frosting II but decided not to frost the larger loaf since the cake was so delish by just going solo. Thanks BIGBRI for sharing your grandpa’s legendary cake.

Great recipe but I did add a little bit more spice, 1/2tsp nutmeg and 1/2tsp ground cloves and upped the cinnamon to 2 1/2tsp. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. By the way, workmates all asked for the recipe!

Best carrot cake ever! I've even seen people who claim not to like carrot cake LOVE this cake. I cut down on the oil and substitute with apple sauce to make it a little lighter. But then of course I smother it in cream cheese buttercream icing. Heavenly

Aside from reducing the recipe by 1/3 to make an 8x8 cake, I made this as written. I found this cake to be very rich, dense, and heavy, reminding me of fruitcake . . . which I happen to like . . . except that this cake was long on texture and short on flavor. If I make this again, I will definitely add nutmeg, allspice, maybe a little mace, and perhaps a pinch of ground clove. Adding some applesauce in place of some of the oil might not be a bad idea. Finally, I wish the recipe had specified FINELY grated carrot (as indicated on the video) instead of shredded carrot.

pretty darn good, this is the second time I've made it and in the tradition of allrecipes, I've amended it to my liking...added a teaspoon of salt, brought out the carrot taste more.  toasted the walnuts for more of THAT flavor....totally over the top excellent.

I am a huge carrot cake fan and I've had some amazing carrot cakes. So i finally decided to try make one myself. This recipe had a huge number of glowing reviews. Okay, I'll admit I forgot to add the crushed pineapple that was sitting right on the counter. I know almost every carrot cake recipe calls for it. But can the pineapple make that much difference? Anyway, I was very unimpressed with this carrot cake. Too much cinnamon. Other then that the taste was just so-so. Texture was not so great either. Certainly NOT the best carrot cake ever. Not even close.

The actual cake was pretty good, it just had to mo much inside of it--- too many walnuts, too many raisins, coconut, etc. Also, I would have liked to have a recipe for whichever cream cheese frosting goes best with this cake. I made my own from scratch and it was too thin. I know that took away from it.

Love this cake.  I use 3 cups carrots instead of coconut, raisins and nuts as someone suggested.  Cream cheese frosting is a must on this.

It was decent, but not a five star recipe as stated.  Not as moist and flavorful as I was looking for.  I did leave out the nuts, raisins, and coconut as I don't like those things in cake so maybe with those additions it is a cake others like?  Not my taste...

This is the abosolute best carrot cake that I have ever eaten. I have made this recipe several times and it is fabulous. I wouldn't change a thing. I use the "whipped cream cheese" frosting recipe on this site. Delicious!

I have had this recipe in my box for sometime and decided to make it for a B.D. Well, I got distracted and over baked it, my bad. Even though it was a little dry I could tell the flavor was good and it was still a hit with everybody. I will make again, and definitely make a day ahead of time to let the flavors develop.

This cake was awesome.  Only had to change a few things out of necessity - I didn't have buttermilk and used low fat milk, blended the crushed pineapple quickly because I don't like fruit chunks, and grated carrots by hand (do not put in food processor!), and chopped the walnuts by hand until very small pieces but not finely chopped (do not process these either!).   I only had canola oil.   Frosted it using cream cheese frosting ll.  Hubby loves it and he is very picky about cake.

Couldn't find my grandmother's recipe that I normally use and this recipe did just fine! Even non-carrot cake lovers like this recipe. I add extra cinnamon to make it a spicier cake for my husband which he loves.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday because he is a huge carrot cake fan. I've actually never made a carrot cake before, but this recipe really had everything and I loved the story behind it so I knew it would be special. The only changes I made were to add more cinnamon and a little nutmeg since my boyfriend is a huge cinnamon fan.  

Since I wanted it to be more like a birthday cake, I baked it in two 8" cake pans instead. There is a lot of batter and part of me knew when I was filling the pans I had filled them a little too much... rookie error. Since the cake is so dense, I found my cakes cooked a little bit unevenly. The outsides were getting crisp but the middle was still gooey. This was my mistake for departing from the original recommendations. If you do bake in cake tins, be sure not to fill them too high. 

Luckily, this recipe is very forgiving. Although the middle was a little more moist than I would have liked, after spending some time in the fridge overnight it firmed up nicely and now I don't notice a problem. The flavours developed even better overnight too! It is really a fantastic recipe and thank you to the poster for sharing such a family gem. Sam's legacy really lives on by making so many people happy with this wonderful cake.

Excellent Carrot Cake!  I did not add coconut.   I used 1 cup regular flour and 1 cup whole wheat.  I used the leftover crushed pineapple and made a nice jam like glaze that I added on top of each piece as served.  Rave reviews from everyone.  My mother-in-law said it was the best carrot cake she ever tasted.  I found it to be moist, but not greasy.  In fact, I am craving another piece right now!  I will make this again for sure.

This is my favorite carrot cake recipe and I am asked to make it often.  I use butter cream frosting instead of cream cheese and it makes a nice variation.  Also, when I do not have coconut or raisins, I just omit them and it still turns out wonderful.  Also, I use cranberries instead of raisins.

I made this recipe except as I was mixing the ingredients, I realized I didn't have any raisins. I also chose to leave the walnuts out as this was a gift and I wanted to be safe.
I made a 9 inch 2 layer cake and there was enough left over for 5 cupcakes (which I was able to sample). Can I just say this was amazing? The taste was perfect - moist and delicious.

I made the changes suggested by Scotchgirl. It was very moist. People liked the pineapple and coconut. I wish I would have made a frosting from scratch (wasn't sure about this recipe for frosting). I did mix some grated carrots, raisins, and chopped walnuts to the frosting. I put the batter in two round pans and I'm glad I watched it b/c I took it out about 10 minutes early. I think it was just slightly under done in the middle. Rave review!

We make muffins out of this recipe for a great take along snack for my toddlers. I use applesauce instead of oil and leave off the frosting. I'm always looking for ways to get in veggies during snack time instead of being limited to fruit and cracker like meals. Short breads such as zucchini bread, pumpkin bread etc is great for this. We will be adding this recipe to our muffin rotation. Your cake recipe not only tastes fantastic it is chock full of nutrients. My picky little eaters love it! Thanks for sharing your grandfathers recipe!

This is the best carrot cake I've ever eaten...and I MADE it! I made some changes as well - I didn't put in the raisins or the coconut and put another 1/2 cup of shredded carrots instead. The bought the pineapple in slices but then put it in my blender to crush/liquify it which added to make the cake have a moister texture. For cream cheese icing, I used:

1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened

1/4 cup butter, softened

2 tablespoons sour cream

2 teaspoons vanilla extract

1/2 (8 ounce) box powdered sugar

Everyone who had a piece of this cake loved it! I definitely recommend it and I have my second batch in the oven right now...fingers crossed that it turns out as great as the first one! :)

SO good! I made this for cupcakes once and loved it, but I was NOT a big fan of the raisins. Ew. I just recently made it for my mom's birthday cake and it's DELICIOUS. I paired it with the cream cheese frosting from another carrot cake recipe on this sight, and it was great!! I did everything just as instructed except for the raisin thing, and I only put 1 1/2 cups of carrots (not for dislike of carrots, but for lack of carrots!). And I just chopped the pecans and sprinkled them on top. Delish!

Moist, delicious, and flavourful.  I always get requests for the recipe when I make this.  It always has a cream cheese frosting on too.  I am not a fan of nuts especially walnuts, but I keep them in the recipe and it is still lovely.

Good but not great. Very moist and good texture but not sweet and not lot a flavor. The cream cheese frosting definitely helped. If I made it again, I'd probably up the sugar.

This truly is the best! Tried making it before omitting the coconut & pineapple and it definitely was missing something.  Made it for Easter this year, following the recipe to a 't' and it was awesome! I wouldn't change a thing!

It was good, just didn't knock my socks off. Followed the recipe exactly as written. The cake was very moist, but I might use a little less pineapples next time, didn't like all the chunks of pineapples.

I made this cake for Easter and it was a HUGE hit!  Absolutely the best carrot cake I have ever eaten!!  Baked it in two 8-inch rounds for about 45 minutes.  Iced it with the Whipped Cream Cheese icing.  Incredible!!

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  In my opinion, it doesn't even really taste like carrot cake.   After reading all the reviews, i had great expectations, but they were unfortunately not met.  I will go back to my own carrot cake recipe.

Okay, I'm still giving it 4 stars because I changed a couple things in the recipe and it was pretty good, jut thought it could do better.  First off, the changes I made: I used pecans instead of walnuts since it was for my mother who gets cold sores from walnuts (weird,  I know). Second, I was really looking to make a lot, so I doubled the recipe.  Third, my father was also going to eat some who hates raisins baked into things,says he thinks they feel like bugs, so I just left them out.  Finally, I was really looking for cupcakes so I baked them that we which took about 22 minutes for a standard cupcake.  I haven't frosted them yet, but my initial honest assessment is that they taste more like muffins than a cake.  There is so much stuff in them (and I left out the raisins) that there doesn't seem to be a sponge like texture at all.  As a cake it's probably fine since you are thinking cake, but as a cupcake, well,  it eats like a muffin.  Although, i thinkmaybe all carrot cake does!  I hope the cream cheese frosting helps them tomorrow.  My other thought is I might have liked a little darker flavor from some brown sugar, or molasses, but the sweetness and flavor are really okay.   On a side note it might be worth making again and planning as a muffin and adding a cinnemon streusel topping.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was an AMAZING carrot cake. very moist and full of flavor. My old carrot cake recipe is now in the garbage and replaced with this one. The only thing i changed was i used milk instead of buttermilk. only because i didn't have any. Bravo! this cake is totally worth it. I just love Carrot Cake :)

When making this recipe I FORGOT TO ADD THE OIL!!!! Silly me. I also used the lemon juice and milk trick instead of buttermilk. I made these in muffin tins, getting twenty four in all. Made sure not to over bake (because of the oil) and hoped for the best. I LOVE this recipe. The cakes were very moist, froze well, and tasted great (even better after pulled from the freezer). Without the oil they translate to roughly 155 calories a muffin (if you make 24). I would suggest spraying with non stick if you plan to use cupcake holders! Thanks for the YUMMY treat!

The best carrot cake.  I made exactly as written and used the cream cheese II frosting on this site.  It was the only cake at the party that was gone.

This had everything but the kitchen sink in it! Lol! I made this because i had extra buttermilk that i needed to use up.  It was very moist and deliscious. I omitted the raisins because i dislike them and decreased the sugar to one cup. Other than that i made no other changes. Very very good. I frosted with whipped cream cheese frosting from this site. Thank you!,

I haven't tried the final product yet, but it smells wonderful when baking, looks great, and the batter was tasty!  I did not use raisins.

Thought I'd try this recipe along with my usual carrot cake.  My goodness Sams Famous Carrot Cake was a big hit. I personally loved all the nuts, raisins and coconut, the pineapple in was great too.  I am keeping this recipe in my recipe box and plan on making it again.  
It is already a fantastic cake, I am going to change a few next time.  I think  chunks and crushed pineapple and maybe add dried cranberries in place of the raisins. In the cream cheese frosting I may add fresh orange zest.

I made this for a co-worker for her birthday and it got rave reviews.  It is fabulous with the recipe for Cream Cheese Frosting II on this website.  I was worried about the coconut because I don't care for coconut but it is not overwhelming at all.  This is a keeper.

This was awesome and super easy. I followed the directions to a T and I also used the cream cheese frosting II from this website. I used two round cake pans and baked per the instructions and they turned out perfect. I will definitely make this again!

This cake turned out well.  Texture was good, flavour was okay...I just do not like coconut but wanted to make this as written. I had mixed reactions from my taste testers.  No one "loved" it but thought it was alright.
I would make this again with a few adjustments

Followed recipe as is and came out great! I ran out of sugar so I had to use Splenda to make up for almost 1 cup of reg sugar so it didn't come out as sweet as I'd like but besides that, the texture and flavor was great. I made them as mini cakes, used a cupcake pan without the liners and put flour and grease before pouring in batter. Topped with cream cheese frosting.

I made this cake for my sister's birthday. The family loved it. I made 2 batches in 2 square 9  inch pans and stacked them to make a double decker! I read the reviews before making and only made one adjustment, grated orange zest in cake and icing.

The best, best, best ever. I cooked ir for my parents and they absolutely love it. Absolutely no need for sweet glaze. Instead of raisins I used sliced apricots & covered top with greaseproof paper as surface of cake became quite dark too soon.
It taste EVEN MORE GOOD on second day.

The best carrot cake ever! I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and added a half cup of applesauce, reduced the sugar to half cup of white sugar and half a cup of brown sugar. This cake is absolutely amazing with cream cheese frosting and have made it over and over.

The cake I made turned out nicely, I made a lot of adjustments, like cubed pineapple, I sauteed the pineapple, carrots and coconut in butter with cinnamon and nutmeg then flambeed at the end with Brandi. I omitted the nuts and raisins as the person I made the cake for does not care for them had I used yellow raisins and would have soaked them in Brandi. I also made a cream cheese frosting using brown butter. The recipe is a solid foundation.

This was pure perfection! I added a bit more buttermilk and more coconut and they balanced each other right out! I took out the raisins and walnuts though because of some reasons, and served this to my boss and coworkers at a company picnic and EVERYONE wanted seconds and thirds!

This carrot cake was AMAZING from start to finish and took maybe 20 mins to make batter I had to double the recipe, I looked at the pictures and they showed one layered cakes, I wanted two, so I double it up. YUM! Only THING::: I don't think it baked long enough i had to go somewhere before it was done so I had someone else take it out -- I think maybe 8 more mins wouldve done the trick had a hard time getting out of pan kinda crumbled but it was A okay!! YUMMY HIGHLY SUGGEST!! Used with cream cheese frosting II

Very moist.The buttermilk is the trick here.Do not omit it.I added a touch of nutmeg as well.Next time I will only use 1/2 cup walnuts, 1 cup was too much for me.Flavor was great!

This is a really yummy carrot cake, I did leave out the raisins, lower the sugar to 1 cup and next time I might use a little less oil but it was still right up there with the best carrot cakes I've tried.  I like it a lot because it has all the good bits in it without having a huge fat and sugar content to match.

Normally after baking anything, I try a bite while cooling, and then wait overnight for the flavour to develop. That's when I rate the baked goods usually. But this one I just tried a bite and it was SO GOOD! It wasn't too sweet (I used half brown, half white sugar), and I added bit of other spices on top of cinnamon (ginger, nutmeg, cloves). Because I baked them as muffin/cupcakes for tomorrow's snack, I didn't want to frost. So I added about 1t of cream cheese inside each muffin/cupcake. I probably should have "whipped" the crem cheese since it looks exactly like the way I put them (cut them in cubes), but still the taste is fantastic. Next time I will add some sugar to the cream cheese. I also added slightly more carrots and pineapple and omitted raisins just because I didn't have any on hand. Oh and I used half applesauce half oil. I used only 2/3 of recipe (didn't want to make a big cake) and made about 15 medium muffins/cupcakes. They are absolutely delicious and I will definitely use this recipe again!

I followed the instructions to a T and I thought this was just ok.  I would have to agree with the other reviewers who mentioned that there's too much liquid in the batter.  Also, do NOT use this for cupcakes because the cake will stick to the cupcake liner.  Someone said it seemed like an egg pudding/undone, and he was right.

I'd never made a cake from scratch before, let alone a carrot cake, so I was very nervous. I used this recipe (minus the nuts as my brother is allergic) and the Cream Cheese Frosting II, and my mother said it was the best carrot cake she's ever had. I don't even LIKE carrot cake and I liked it!!! :-) WOW!

I was a tad skeptical that I would like this because, although I love all of the ingredients, I thought it might be a bit too "busy" for my tastes.  Boy was I wrong- and sorry I waited so long to try it.  This is very dense, but manages to be sinfully moist.  You get the crunchy bits of walnuts, the chewy pop of raisins and the sweet pineapple tidbits.  If I were to change anything it would probably be to add more pineapple, as I love it in this.  I did not have any cream cheese to make frosting for this cake, and I did not miss it at all.  I may try it frosted some day, but for now I am happily enjoying this just as it is :)  Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Mr. D'Amico!

As another review put it...good but not great.  It was very dense, heavy and filling and I liked that, but was kind of bland. I think if I make it again I will add more spices and not use any cream cheese frosting.

I made this for my boss at work and I was worried that it would be gone before he got a chance to have a piece.  Everyone commented on how delicious and moist it was.  They really loved the cheesy taste of the frosting.  I did not change anything in the recipe! LOVE IT.  It will be my number 1 recipe for carrot cake.

I made this cake for the 1st time for a friend's mother's birthday as I couldn't find a previous recipe I had. Though I did not have any of this cake, my friend tells me it was divine! So moist and delicious. I accidentally bought pineapple rings instead of crushed pineapple so I threw the pineapple rings in the food processor (that was my only modification). I have extra carrots so I'll be making myself this cake so I can try it!

This cake is amazing!  I got rave reviews from everyone who tried it (total of about 30 people).  I am not a big fan of raisins, but i decided to try this recipe exactly how it was written and I was glad I did.  It is perfect just the way it is.  This is definitely a permanent addition to my recipe box!  Thank you Brian!

I've made this cake 3 times, and every time I was so amazed at how delicious, moist and satisfying it is. All the good stuff inside too, like coconut, walnuts, pineapple and the carrots, you can almost get away with eating cake. So easy to make too. Love it, thank you Grandpa Sam and Brian.

Made it exactly as posted, except for leaving out the nuts.   Delicious as is, even better with a cream cheese frosting.

This cake lived up to its reputation!  FANTASTIC!  IT was very moist and full of flavor.  Top it with a simple cream cheese frosting and it will absolutely impress any dinner guest!  

The cake's moisture almost makes it rich so remember to cut smaller slices than normal.

I only made this because I needed to use up some carrots and buttermilk that I had in the fridge :)... everyone loved it so much, even my daughter in law who does not like pineapple at all! I doubled the batch and froze the cake after baking...very moist cake and freezes well...thanks for the great recipe!  :)

This is an amazing carrot cake. Rich, with so many additives that it could be considered a serving of fruit/vegetables! ;-)  I made it as my wedding cake, with a simple cream cheese frosting. Raves from everyone.

When I made this, I got a very watery batter. Thus, when I stuck it in the oven, the cake did not rise with a round top like most cakes do. It tasted fine, but it was pretty ugly.

This is the first time I've ever made a cake.  It came out amazing! I used golden raisins since I prefer the taste, and based on other reviews I swapped 1/4 cup of the oil with applesauce.  I topped the cake with the Cream Cheese frosting II from this site, and then I sprinkled walnuts on top to cut the rich taste a bit.

Really, this was perfect.  Great taste, great moist consistency, and dense like a carrot cake should be.  This will definitely be my go-to recipe for carrot cake.  My boyfriend's ten year old son could barely wait for it to be done before he grabbed some.

I made this cake for two reasons:  1) I was in search of a good carrot cake recipe and 2) I had a can of crushed pineapple that had to be used.  
This cake was fabulous!!!  I omitted the nuts (personally I just don't like them in baking) and used a 9x13 pan so I had to adjust the bake time - other than that, I followed the recipe to a T.  It is by far the best carrot cake I have ever had.  So moist and so much flavour but not overly sweet.
We had dinner guests and one complimented saying it would probably win over those that don't like carrot cake because it's so much more than just a carrot cake.  
Will definitely make again and will be my go to for potlucks etc.
Thanks for sharing :)

My daughter requested a carrot cake for her 8th birthday this year so I went looking of a carrot cake worthy of a birthday.  This is so worth it.  The hardest part of this recipe is grating carrots (which isn't nearly as much work as it sounds!!) so don't be scared.

I made one change and one ommission - I didn't have buttermilk so I used milk/lemon juice as a substitute, and I left out the nuts because our family doesn't like them.  Oh, and I didn't have an 8 ounce can of pineapple so I just scooped 1 cup out of a larger can.

The texture is awesome, the flavor is out of this world.  It is a heavier than normal cake, but it just added to greatness of the recipe.  Other reviewers said it was better the next day so I baked the cake the night before.  I topped it with the "Cream Cheese Frosting II" recipe from this site.

My daughter was thrilled, my family loved it, and it was easy to make!

Just a note - Step 5 says to "fold in well" but the batter is much thinner than what you would anticipate for "folding" in anything.  Just mix it all together and pour it in the pan.  I anticipated something much thicker by the wording and worried that I had done something wrong until it came out of the oven.  YUM!

My husband loves this! The only carrot cake we both had to compare this recipe to is the carrot cake Barnes and Noble used to offer. We loved B & N's carrot cake, but thought it was too dry. 
I had added 1/2 tablespoon ginger, 
1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, and 1/2 teaspoon of lemon zest to this recipe. Instead of sugar, I had used honey at 1 1/4 cups. Coupled with the Cream Cheese Frosting II on this website, this was a pairing made in heaven! Moist too!
6/17/2011: Wow, what a wonderfully tasty cake!

I ommitted the raisins and nuts (personal preference) and accidentally used a larger can of crushed pineapple, but otherwise made as written. It was so good! Didn't even last 24 hours with my family because it was just so moist and yummy! Would definitely make again.

Nice, moist cake. I made it exactly to recipeexcept I baked in a 9x13 pan for 45 mins. Next time I will try leaving out the raisins as they add a bit too much sweetness for my taste and adding more nuts. I will also take the advice of other reviewers and increase the amount of cinnamon. The Cream Cheese Frosting II is a perfect topping for this cake but it is good enough to eat unfrosted.

Best cake ever!  Served this cake at a family get together everyone wanted the recipe. It is so moist and full of flavour.  Definately try it you won't be dissappointed.  I iced it with a cream cheese frosting to which I added 1 tsp of orange rind.  Gives the frosting a nice flavour. Enjoy!

Just finished putting on the icing and having a piece, the cake itself is yummy a bit heavy and somewhat chewy but tasty just the same.  The icing is the best creamy, cheesy and just the right amount of sweet put the two together and you have a awesome cake.  Would make again, we will see how the family likes it.

The best carrot cake. I doubled the recipe and baked it in 1 round springform pan + 1 loaf pan.

I have also made this gluten-free. I followed the recipe exactly, using a standard flour replacement mixture (brand Finax). It was still perfect, no adjustments needed.

I don't use all the different bowls as specified but rather mix all dry ingredients in 1 bowl & all wet in another bowl (with sugar) then gently fold everything together. I don't like stiff, sickly sweet cream cheese frosting so I use 450 g cream cheese, 120 g butter, 1 tsp lemon juice & 500 g powdered sugar. This makes way more than needed despite splitting the cake into 2 layers.

I made this cake because of all of the 5 star reviews and was kind of disappointed in it.  It was just an okay recipe.  I've honestly had better carrot cakes that were more moist.

Best carrot cake I've ever tasted! I've made it several times now and always a huge hit. I used golden raisins because they are much more mild which I prefer as I'm not a huge fan of raisins. I made the coconut cream cheese frosting from this site to go with. Amazing. Thanks for sharing.

This by far is the best carrot cake ever. I followed the recipe. Not too much of a pineapple fan, but it was DELICIOUS. I choose this recipe because of the reviews. A GOOD recipes is one u don't have to make any changes to at all. I made my own cream cheese frosting. My family LOVE LOVE LOVED it. I will make again.

Scrumptious cake! I used pecans, but next time it will be walnuts - don't mess with the original I say! I was sure I had raisins but couldn't find any so I used a few craisins. Also - I don't keep buttermilk on hand, but I found some powdered buttermilk at the store and used it...it worked just fine! Just a suggestion...before adding spices make this cake with just the cinnamon. I don't think you'd be disappointed.

This was an exceptionally moist, delicious, light-tasting cake... not over-spiced, like many carrot cakes.  The only things I did differently were to omit the nuts (due to allergies) and add a pinch of ground cloves and a double-pinch of nutmeg.  Neither of these additions were really detectable; i expect you can tweek the spices to your own taste and will still LOVE the results.  I don't own a large food processor (eee-gads!) but used my 'mini chopper' to pulverize chopped baby carrots.  I'm very pleased with the resulting texture, especially the juxtaposition of the carrots and sweet, plump raisins.  I actully am sorry that I put a cream cheese icing on this; I myself prefer it au natural!

very excellent carrot cake.  I made it as cupcakes and I think would be better as a cake in 9 x 13 pan or definitely a layer cake. It was moist and delicious. Mush better than Carrot Cake III. Add the raisins next time!! (Didn't have any on hand.)

I made this recipie, exactly as stated minus the coconut and rasins and probably halved the walnuts. I have yet to taste it but just looking at it and smelling it is amazing. It looks insanely moist. I will review again after eating it for my dad's birthday tomorrow!

This cake is divine!  I make it every year for my boyfriend's B-day.  I do the same thing as another reviewer and use half white/half whole wheat flour; lower the oil to 1/4 cup and sub the rest with applesauce; add some lemon zest and nutmeg - top with cream cheese frosting and suddenly I'm the mayor of yum city!  Thanks Sam!!!

This was good, but honestly, not a true carrot cake. There were so many other ingredients in it that I couldn't even tell there were carrots in it. I baked it in a regular size bundt pan for 55 minutes. It came out very moist, but very dense, too. I made a cream cheese glaze to go over it.

This is an excellent carrot cake.  I made it exactly according to directions except that I made 1 1/2 times the recipe to make it a 3 layer cake.  I also used the cream cheese frosting recipe from this site but modified it slightly.   Made this for a family get together - they couldn't stop eating it.  I have to say that it is the best carrot cake I have ever made and family members agree as well.   This will be my go to carrot cake recipe from now on.  Brian, thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe...

i made this carrot cake for Easter sunday, it was truly the best i've ever had! my daughter thought that maybe alittle more spice would make it even better. i'm going to try some pumpkin pie spice along with the cinnamon next time.

This is fantastic.  I have never made a home made carrot cake before, but I have no reason to look for another recipe.  It's the perfect density for a carrot cake- not too fluffy, but not too heavy either.  Very moist and the cinnamon is just enough spice.    The only extra step I added was straining my carrots (just squeezed them in paper towels), and I will definitely do that again- keeps the carrots more crunchy.  I also added in about 1/2 cup more carrots, and just a little less coconut and nuts (I chose pecans).   I will definitely make this again!

Absolutely amazing!  I was looking for a carrot cake to take to the inlaws for Easter and not only were the *stars* rating the recipe awesome, our son's name is Sam so I had a fondness from the start.  I have never been a fan of carrot cake; however everyyyybody in my husbands family loves it.  when I took this I felt like a rockstar at all of the praises, oohs and ahhs :)  And, it's true - it was DELISH!  Thank you so much for sharing a recipe that will ALWAYS be my carrot cake staple.

This cake was awesome! I read many of the reviews and took a couple of suggestions.  The first suggestion was to add nutmeg. Well, I don't like to use nutmeg, instead I used oriental 5 spice which is what I use when a recipe calls for nutmeg. The amount recommended was 1/8 teaspoon. The other suggestion was to brush the cake with simply syrup.  So, I generously brushed each 9" layer (including the sides) and let it sit overnight.  This cake was a hit with my co-workers!  It was extremely moist and the 5 spice gave it extra umph! If you're looking for a good carrot cake this is the one.  Also, I would use the Whipped Cream Cheese frosting as well.  Both compliment one another!  I will be baking this cake again.

I don't usually write reviews but this cake was delicious! Possibly the best carrot cake I've ever made.  I did not have pineapple on hand, so I ended up putting 8 oz. applesauce and it still came out wonderful!  Great recipe, I will make this again

Carrot cake tends to appeal to those of us who enjoy a healthier dessert.  This recipe bakes up moist and tasty and is chock full of carrots and fruit!  It isn't overly sweet, and is complemented well with a cream cheese frosting - but quite frankly could be enjoyed without.

I really loved this cake!!  I made it for Easter and everyone raved about it, my only question to anyone is "did anyone's carrots in the cake turn bright green??  I had purchased already shredded carrots, in which were very fresh and none were green in color, but some relatives of mine pointed out the gross green stems" as they call it" in my cake, I know it was the carrots but why did they turn that color??  very curious if anyone can give me an answer I would appreciate it, I will keep on making this cake:)  thanks

Wonderful taste and texture!  I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce and kept all remaining ingredients the same with the exeption of a pinch of nutmeg and cloves.  It was no different than a cake that calls for 1 1/2 cups oil.  Moist and rich.  Not quite sure what makes me cut the oil anyway, I mean I end up frosting it with cream cheese frosting but it makes me feel better cutting a big slice "thinking" I'm eating low fat cake!

Doesn't need icing!  *Pointer: when making cream cheese icing, do NOT use Fat Free cream cheese, poor consistency, bad flavor, and not very creamy.

I tried this cake again today to see if maybe my taste buds were just overloaded yesterday. Nope--this cake is still too sweet for me. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, but it was STILL too sweet. To be fair I think it would be perfect without an icing, but as it was Easter I made a cream cheese icing for it and between the two, I really wanted less sugar in the cake part. To be fair again, I often bake my cakes with part white whole wheat flour but I used 100% all-purpose this time as I didn't want to alter the flavor of the cake negatively, so I might just be too accustomed to whole wheat cakes now. This cake is moist and bakes up beautifully. It is easy to remove from pans and easy to layer. My weird taste buds aside, this is a great recipe. Thank you!

I made this cake for Easter and it was good, but could have been better. It came out quite crumbly, so I'm not sure what I did wrong. I followed the recipe word for word, measurement for measurement- which I don't normally do- but I wanted it to turn out since it was for family. I used a standard cream cheese frosting but had no milk (my husband use the last drop for his cereal that morning) so I used some cream. That really made the frosting rich and wonderful!

I omitted the coconut because I didn't have any and switched the raisins out for dried cranberries.  This was an amazing carrot cake.  The cranberries added a bright freshness to this rich and spicy cake.  Love this recipe!

This cake is AWESOME.  Made it as is, and it quickly disappeared.  Very moist, easier to make than I thought given the ingredients and absolutely the best carrot cake I've ever tasted.  Thanks for sharing this fantastic family recipe!

This cake is a must have in your recipe box!!!  I was asked to make a carrot cake for a birthday party.. never made one before so I started my search for a recipe.  After reading all the reviews I just had to try this one.  OMG!!!  I have never received so many compliments on a cake.  I baked in 2 round 9 inch pans for 39 mins, then iced with a homemade cream cheese icing then sprinkled chopped walnuts and coconut on the top for a little decoration.  IT was DELICIOUS!!!!

Wonderful!  I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce and ommitted the raisons as DH doesn't like them. Was moist and delicious.  Thank you!

This recipe was awesome and my family loved it.  I did omit the raisins, used pecans instead of walnuts and added a bag of white chocolate chips and 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg.  I have already been asked to make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

PERFECT!!! This is one one those recipes that you don't need to tweek, it's perfect the way it is! I did leave out the raisins because I personally don't like them. Thank you for this wonderful carrot cake recipe. This is a keeper! I will next time  use the applesauce that other suggested just to make it a bit healthier. Again thank you for sharing your grandfathers recipe:)

This was by far the BEST carrot cake I've ever had. I did bake it in 2 round cake pans as per the picture, and I frosted it with cream cheese frosting.  Simply amazing!

My nine year old requested a carrot cake for his birthday. Once I read the reviews, I knew I had to try this recipe. Glad I did! This is a wonderfully moist cake. I omitted the raisins and also cut down on the nuts because I ran out. I used two nine inch pans. Unfortunately, I set the timer for 45 minutes and didn't check the cake, so my edges were a little darker than I wanted. However, it did not affect the moist texture. This recipe is definitely a winner! I will be proud to share this cake with family and friends in the future.

I added more carrots, organic carrots have much more flavor so try it if this is a special occasion.  This cake is so good that the recipe is being used at a wedding coming up.

This was awesome!!!!!!  I made this recipe with an egg substitute, soymilk, and deleted the walnuts because of food allergies and it turned out excellent.  My friends could not even tell that I had omitted that stuff.  I used a cream cheese icing from the store without dairy in it.  I sprinkled coconut on top.  My cake was a little short.  If I make this again, I will probably try to use two 8 inch round pans or a little different egg substitute to get just a little more height.  I make this review for those with food allergies in their families to encourage them to try some recipes for loved ones. It is  more difficult, but it is not impossible.  The cake has excellent flavor and baked beautifully with the instructions as provided.  Thanks for sharing your family recipe!!!

This is an excellent cake!!  I've made it 4x and everyone has absolutely loved it.  I was very pleased to impress my Mom.  I think it's the buttermilk replacing half the oil that makes this cake so wonderful.  I just love this cake.

This is a phenomonal carrot cake, the best I've ever had.  I brought it to a 4th of July party and EVERYONE raved about it.  I toasted the coconut, added a bit of nutmeg and omitted the walnuts, otherwise made it as written.  I used a basic cream cheese frosting recipe.  Thank you for sharing this Brian - this deserves a Throwdown with Bobby Flay! :-)

Delicious! I left out the coconuts and added a little extra carrot but other than that, followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. I made it for my boyfriend's parents and they absolutely loved it.

I love love love this cake recipe!   I make it for all three of my kids' birthdays and I usually sneak in whole wheat flour for part of the all purpose.  I love that I can feed a crazy bunch of kids at a birthday party a homemade cake that they go nuts for.  I use organic ingredients, the cream cheese frosting II from this site, and an overload of sprinkles!  Thanks for sharing and bringing a new tradition of cakes to our family...

Oh my, this is just delicious! I served it to family and coworkers and they just could not get enough of it. The ingredients set it apart in a subtle way--I had to field the repeated question of "What did you do differently?". While a good cream cheese frosting is a nice and traditional addition (and one that I did use), I think the cake would be great on its own.

A new family favorite - it has already been requested for the next birthday party!  I did slim it down by using applesauce in place of the oil and omitted the coconut and nuts, based on personal preference.

Ok wow! This cake was AMAZING! My family couldnt get enough of it! I was up in the middle of the Night eat it. Yes it's that Amazing. I made a homemade Cream cheese Icing for it. The recipe i got for the cream cheese tasted just like a cheese cake. All around this cake was So good! I don't think there is another carrot cake better than this one!

FanTabuLous.  Never made carrot cake before, and this was a snap.  Plus, it was delish.  The girls at work really went for it, not a piece was left to bring home :(  I think the buttermilk really made it moist.  Used half white, half wheat, like one of the reviewers suggested, and sub'd the oil for applesauce.  I also used Apple pie spice in place of the cinnamon for that extra "Me" touch.  Thanks so much Sam :)  Dis cake is da bomb, even when I used storebought cream cheese icing for a topping :)

This is absolutely the best carrot cake i've ever had! I made it first for my moms b-day party and had about 10 people ask for the recipe! Since then whenever there's a family gathering i'm asked to bring some of "that amazing carrot cake"

Absolutely wonderful!  I did not change much of the recipe. I omitted the nuts (personal preference) and added another cup of carrots.  Moist, delicious and a lot of flavor.  This recipe was a hit with my inlaws!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This recipe is great, and it's one of a few carrot cake recipes with only three eggs instead of four.  I managed to change a few things just for personal preference without ruining it.  I just wanted regular carrot cake so I left out the coconut, juice, nuts, and raisins.  Also I added a teaspoon of nutmeg, and used regular milk.  Turned out tasting delicious anyway, and I'll certainly make it again!  Thanks :)

This is an amazing recipe! Everyone who has tried it has loved it- even if they weren't a big cake fan :-D I usually replace the walnuts with almonds and always top it off with cream cheese frosting. Yum yum yum!

This was wonderful! I made it for Easter because carrot cake is my friend's favorite. She really loved it! I didn't even put icing on it because it contained everything but the kitchen sink, and was sweet enough without. I will definitely keep this in with my recipes!

Perfection! The only changes I made were to add 1/8 t. nutmeg and some lemon zest.  I frosted with Cream Cheese Icing II to which I also added some lemon zest and a few drops of lemon juice.  This was the best carrot cake we have ever eaten!

Delicious!  I didn't have any coconut so had to make it w/out, but still came out so good!  Cream cheese frosting is a must, of course.

I made this in a bundt pan and cooked it a little longer that an hour when I should have just kept it to cook for only an hour.  I stuck to the recipes vital ingredients but did make a few changes on some other things.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of carrots, omitted the coconut, and used chopped pecans because that was what I had.  I thought it turned out really yummy and fairly moist! I think it would have been better if I had stuck to the recipes cook time=more moist! I topped it with the creamy cream cheese frosting that is also on this site!  I will probably make this again!

I've made many carrot cakes, but none of them compare to this recipe.  The icing is not as sweet as the typical cream cheese which is nice.  My family wants me to use this recipe from now on.  It's the best and so easy to make!

One word for starters- WOW!!!!and this is coming from a baker!This cake was super moist and delicious- Was just a tad short on the nuts- i ran out! and packed the carrots in 2 cups. used the simple and efficinet wet/dry method. Whipped up a simple cream cheese icing by blending 8 oz cream cheese and about a cup and a half of icing sugar and a couple tbsp of lemon juice-for a fuss free topping  Fantastic recipe.Made it for easter dessert instead of boring ol pumpkin pie.This is going to be 'the carrot cake recipe" for me and my family. I had an old fav that i lost, but it doesnt hold a candle to this one! Way to go Uncle Sam. And thanks for sharing Brian!

I have made this cake for many executive board meetings and it is a winner everytime, especially with the top rated cream cheese frosting found on this site. The pineapple really makes this cake moist. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Absolutely amazing!  On a quest for the ultimate carrot cake for a special occasion I am catering for a friend, and I found it in this recipe!  I added the zest of one lemon to the batter and frosted it with cream cheese frosting.

Pretty good-- although a bit lighter than I'm used to, this recipe isn't as dense as other carrot cakes I've eaten which is a nice change.

Very good. Not too much of the coconut or pineapple flavor comes through - just moist and dense in texture. Used whipped cream cheese frosting from this site, which was super.

Sam's the man!  This is an exceptionally good carrot cake and deserves every one of its five stars!  I prepared it per the recipe and iced the cake with Rebecca Rather's wonderful Mascarpone Cream Cheese Icing from her Pastry Queen Christmas cookbook.

This was the first Carrot Cake I had ever made and I was striving to make it better than my mother in laws (who should have been a professional baker). This recipe had a lot of the same ingredients as her carrot cake and omg, did it turn out better than hers. The combination of everything is superb! I do not care much for raisins, but in this cake they were awesome! I don't think I'll try another carrot cake recipe again. The only change I made was I poured the batter into two round pans. I just like round cakes better. This one's a keeper!

I agree with the other reviewers...this is an incredible cake. So moist and dense - just as a carrot cake should be. I even froze half of it and it was great when I thawed it. You won't be disappointed!

Awesome carrot cake.  I made mine into cupcakes to take to a Bunko night.  They were all gone at the end of the night.  I frosted them with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site.  Great combo.

I made this yesterday for my husband's 40th birthday - carrot cake is his favorite. I picked this recipe largely because of the reviewer who had tried 5 different carrot cake recipes for a wedding cake.  However, I wanted to make it as written, which I did with the exception of using 1/2 brown sugar for 1/2 cup of the white, and putting 2 T of rum with the raisins. I also made it in three 8 inch cake pans and baked it for 45 mins. Next time I would check it at 35 mins. I was hesitant about putting in the raisins and coconut, and next time I would probably omit the coconut - when eating the cake the shreds of coconut are very apparent and seem a bit out of place. I did not drain the carrots, which I grated using a food processor, or the pineapple and used the oil as written. It was not oily to me and was moist, but not soggy. I frosted it with Cream Cheese Frosting II to which I added 1/2 cup sugar for taste, and 1 cup finely chopped walnuts. In fact I have eaten moister carrot cakes than this one. However, I like my carrot cake very moist. I gave this four stars because it was not the best carrot cake I have ever had. However, it is the first carrot cake I have made in many years, so I can't really compare it as a recipe, and I was definitely pleased with the results. It certainly was easy to make. I would like to try the "Best Ever Carrot Cake" recipe as a comparison.

use 3 cups of carrots and omit all extras except pineapple. use 16 oz. cream cheese, 1 stick butter, 32 oz. powdered sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/4 tsp. salt for frosting (makes a lot). Bake 35-40 minutes if using 2-9 inch pans. cupcakes: 350 degress for 25 minutes 1/2 frosting and frost generously.

Very good cake. I didn't put nuts or cocnut in (personal preference) and it was sooo delicious. I made it for my mom's birthday and she said it was one of the best cakes she has ever had (maybe she is biased because I am her daughter:) It is very moist and delicious.

Wow, we just returned from 4th of July campout, and this cake was a hit. It was almost embarrassing the way the guys were carrying on about this carrot cake. They absolutely loved it. It was the most moist and flavorful carrot cake ever. I also frosted this cake with a fresh orange cream cheese frosting, I think that put it over the top

The cake was delicious, I added a lot of extra pineapple to it and left out the nuts and raisins and found it tasted wonderful even after tinkering with it.

I paired it with a crème cheese frosting recipe found on here and the frosting hardened to a new form of cement—but that was to no fault of the cake. So I just ended up peeling the frosting off (yikes! scary thought, huh?) and having a battered (but yummy) cake for everyone.

Sam, you are my baking hero. What a moist, moist and flavorful cake. The spices and flavor reminded me a little of fruit cake but so much lighter! I subbed craisins for raisins, pecans for walnuts, and a mashed banana instead of the coconut. I baked it in two 9 inch rounds for 45 minutes and topped it with Cream Cheese Frosting II. If my guests weren't talking about the cake they were stuffing themselves with it. Thanks for the recipe!

Your grandfather's legacy certainly does live on, because this is the best carrot cake I have ever tasted and we've made it several times and counting!  (Including one baking right now - tried a tube pan  this time and increased the recipe by 1/3 because I had a lot of carrots to use up.)  It's the only carrot cake recipe I'll ever use again.

This was an awesome recipe.  I did had a few extras and make one change.  I love to have a bunch of fruit in my carrot cake so I also added 1/3 cup each of chopped dried apriocots, dried cherries & dried blueberries.  I also like to add... this is definitely a bit different... mayonnaise to my cakes, it makes for a moist, flavorful cake.  I omitted the salt and where the oil was called for used 1/2 oil, 1/2 mayonnaise.  I also added 2 Tbsp. each lemon and orange zest to the icing along with 2 Tbsp. of Grand Marnier... yummy!!!

This is by far the best carrot cake I have ever tasted.  There wasnt a frosting listed with the recipe but I found a great one to compliment the cake.  2 (8 ounce) packages softened cream cheese, 1/2 cup butter, softened, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.  Try this and it is to die for!

This carrot cake was delicious!!! For the frosting I used another recipe on this site, Creamy Cream Cheese Frosting.  It was perfect!  Next time I will use a little less coconut and raisins though(personal preference).

made this for Easter 2008 - used Macadamia nuts instead of walnuts and omitted the rasins and added 1/4 c crystallized ginger.     

frosted with cinnamon maple syrup glaze- drizzled on top and garnished with chopped mac nuts.

Great recipe, but a bit heavy.  I didn't realize how dense this cake would be.  Served it for Easter Sunday and it was a big hit.  Used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe like other users.

I made this recipe as cupcakes and used Sprinkles cream cheese frosting - absolutely to die for!

8 oz cream cheese
4 oz butter
3 3/4 c. confectioner's sugar, sifted
1/2 tea. vanilla extract
1/8 tea. salt

Cream the butter, cheese and salt in a stand mixer until light and fluffy. Gradually add the sugar until incorporated, then add the vanilla.

Good. I'm used to a denser carrot cake but will make again, possibly add more cinnamon.
