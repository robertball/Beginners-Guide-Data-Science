When I chose this recipe there were 3 reviews and all gave it 5 stars.  I followed the recipe precisely because of the glowing reviews.  Whoa!  SALTY!!
Nice flavors but soy sauce, fish sauce and salt?  I will make it again, no tsp. salt and I will add 1 more tblsp. sugar and perhaps some heat.  (Excuse me, I have to go check my blood pressure.).

Easy to do, great to taste. I substituted chicken thighs for chicken wings & marinated them for about 3 hrs. Then I grilled them on the BBQ flat plate for a short time ( 2/3 minutes each side)and finished them off on the open char grill flame. Tender & Delicious!!

30 minutes wasnt' enough time to cook them. Took an hour for the crispy effect. But still good nonetheless.

Easy and tasty.  I put the wings under the broiler for a few minutes to make the wings a little more crispy.  They were wonderful.

Great flavor but felt a little greasy, a crispier finish from some direct heat would move this up to five stars.

Made these for our Book Club this past week. It was a HUGE hit. I tweaked it a bit by using Low Sodium Soy Sauce since Fish Sauce tends to be salty anyway. I also added about 1 tbsl. of fresh chopped ginger. After cooking in the oven, I put it on broil to crisp them a bit, sprinkled them with chopped cilantro and they were amazing.

The chicken didn't come out like the one in the picture but it was still pretty good. But like everyone said its very salty even after I put in 2 scoops of sugar w. a laddle.

It turned out a bit too salty, so I had to add some sugar. I don't know why mines wasn't crispy, even though I followed the directions exactly.

My daughter had to make a recipe as part of her book review project at school.  We chose this one and it was a hit.  The high-school kids loved as well as our own family. I have since made it for parties and it is a hit with our friends as well.

Very tasty. I grilled these instead of baking which kept them from getting slimy as mentioned by a previous poster. I also cut the salt out and increased the number of cloves of garlic to 4. Also used lemon grass instead of lemon juice. Made these along side traditional hotwings and were a bit hit.

I didn't think that these had much of a flavor, but the flavor that was present wasn't very tasty. I just marinated them for about three hours though so maybe that was the reason. I didn't add extra salt and felt that they were salty enough. Won't make again.

These wings were the best that I have had or made.  After reading a lot of the reviews I made several slight changes to the original recipe.  I used low sodium soy sauce instead of the regular soy sauce.  I omitted the teaspoon of salt and increased temperature to 425 degrees.  I made two trays of the wings doubling the original recipe.  Two teenagers and four adults were looking for more wings.

This recipe is a keeper! Sammamish Guy

This was a bit too salty for my taste, even without adding the extra tsp of unnecessary salt. I actually used three large boneless chicken breasts, cut into 3-4 pieces each, instead of wings. I also added some pineapple chunks during the last 15 minutes of cooking, so the saltiness was cut with something sweet, but the result was still just okay. I doubt I'll be making this again.

I just made this yesterday for a party. They are very good. I did take the advice of another reviewer and add another 10 min to the cooking time (and increase the cooking temp for those last 10 min to 450 degrees). While they turned more golden and we're still very juicy they weren't crispy. Broiling them for a short time may do the trick for that. I made the recipe with ingredients, as is (except I did use low-sodium soy sauce since that was what I had on hand) and didn't think it was too salty.   I did marinate it in a freezer bag for 24 hours flipping the bag every few hours. Great Asian flavor!

Overall the underlying flavor was good, but this chicken was WAY too salty.  If you try this one OMIT the salt.
