Very nice - loved the melding of the different flavors. Personal preferences meant I used less garlic and added some hot pepper flakes, lemon juice and grated romano.  I would think this would be great with white beans or with quinoa.

I really enjoyed this.  Had some spinach to use up and when I typed in 'sauteed spinach' this is the recipe that appeared.  It was delicious and loaded with flavor.  I like that the tomatoes go in at the end so they remain firm.  VBM, great recipe that I will be using again as I always have spinach on hand.

This recipe has all our favourites and I knew we would love it.  Garlic and spinach with grape tomatoes and basil pesto…magnifique!  This takes no time at all to make…try it…you'll love it. Next time I'm going to serve it with eggs… can't wait.

What a flavorful dish this is. Goes perfect with anything, we had it with chicken. Made it as written, and like  another said i like that the tomatoes go in last. Thanks Volleyballmom for a very tasty dish... I'm going to try it with swiss chard next time. and probably beet greens would be good with this to..

Made with 8 oz of fresh spinach and that was just enough for two. Next time I will add more spinach, less olive oil in the pan and hold back a little on the garlic. The pesto adds a lot of both of those. This is really good.

Easy and quick! I had leftover turkey and was looking for a way to jazz it up, so I added it at the end before mixing in the pesto (added 3 Tbs. instead of 2) and mixed it all up and served it over spaghetti with Parmesan Cheese on top! Yum!
