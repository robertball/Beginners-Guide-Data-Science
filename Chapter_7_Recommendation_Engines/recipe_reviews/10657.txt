Dough was very easy to work with. Cooked 10-12 min on an air-bake pan. The flags were adorable-took to a St Patty's party so I made mine a little smaller than the recommended 2x3. Delicious.

The cookies weren't very tasty and frosting the cookies wasn't as easy as it looked.
I tried using a brush and then a butter knife, but then just gave up.

Very good.  Simple icing.  Use cookie cutter for seasonal cookies.

The recipe is a pretty thick sugar/butter cookie.  I cooked mine for 13 minutes and that worked well.  I didn't have cream of tartar so I substituted one tsp of baking powder for the cream of tartar AND the baking soda.  I had to add an additional 1 1/4 cup of flour to make it a consistency that would roll OK.  (I also threw in a little additional vanilla and confectioner's sugar so it wouldn't throw off the taste too much by adding so much additional flour.)  Still, all in all, a fun cookie for St. Patrick's Day or to celebrate the Irish!  I'm considering dipping the bottom of the cookie in chocolate to give it a little more flavor.  It's good by itself, just a little plain is all.

I've been making these cookies for at least 30 years.  I thought, hey it's missing something. 1/2 tsp. almond extract along with the vanilla. If you don't like almond, up the vanilla to a extra 1/2 tsp., instead of the one.  Also, you have to refrigerate this cookie for at least 2 hours then you don't have to add extra flour that probably is why it tastes so bland with all the extra flour.

Great cookie! Instead of rolling out and cutting flag shapes, I  divided the dough and made 3 logs, put them in wax paper, and refrigerated for about 20 or so minutes. I then took them out, kept the wax paper on and squared the logs to get 3 long rectangles. I used a knife to cut the cookies 1/4 inch thick and baked on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. I don't bake any cookies or breads without parchment paper. I doubled the frosting recipe. In addition to the vanilla, I added a touch of almond extract. I divided the frosting for the colors. Chop sticks worked for mixing and applying the frosting. I did one batch of flags, got impatient and drizzled each color on the rest of the cookies... I had just enough frosting. They actually look really good.  I will definitely make these cookies again.
