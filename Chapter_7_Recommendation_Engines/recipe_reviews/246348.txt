These were actually pretty good.  I didn't have almond butter so I used peanut butter and I substituted vanilla extract for the almond extract.  They were a bit soft but very chocolatey.  Super easy to make and hard to believe there's garbanzo beans and no eggs or flour. Didn't tell anyone at home about the secret ingredient or they wouldn't eat them.

more of a blondie. Very gooey but the flavor is great. I also used peanut butter and vanilla because I didn't have Almond butter.

The good news is that the texture of these brownies is amazing; it’s simply incredible that chickpeas make such good brownies. The bad news is that the person who created this recipe clearly likes almonds much more than they like chocolate. 

If you make these according to the recipe, you’re going to end up with blonde almond brownies with hardly any chocolate whatsoever. If that’s your thing, great; if not, you’re going to have to make some changes. Add a tablespoon of cocoa powder, more chocolate chips,  and a packet of Splenda. Skip the almond extract entirely. I haven’t tried substituting peanut butter for the almond butter, but I expect it to be an improvement.

A great way to use chick peas;  very tasty.  Used peanut butter instead of almond butter.
