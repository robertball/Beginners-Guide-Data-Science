Frozen lemonade concentrate + soy sauce + seasonings = some darn good pork chops.  Wow, the lemon flavor is instantly recognizable but not too overpowering.  My pork chops were from Costco (that means they were THICK), so I marinated them for two days.  I baked mine at 350 degrees for 40 minutes because of the cold weather here.  I cannot wait to try them on the grill.  Serve with something that will enhance the lemon flavor, like asparagus or green beans.  Great recipe.

These were very good.  However, due to the busy-ness of our lives, I left these in the marinade for two days.  Guess what?  That improved the flavor!  Will make again!

My husband said this was one of the best marinades I have ever tried.  He even went so far as to ask me to try it on steak next time. :o)

I knew I was taking a chance when I tried this recipe, but I had to.  Boy, am I glad I did.  My husband went nuts over it.  The only change I made was to use pork steaks instead of chops because that's what I had.  For the sake of my marriage, I will be making these again and again.

Really a great recipe.
The marinade is good with chicken
too. Try thinly sliced onions on
top of the chops before baking;
350 degrees for about 45 minutes,
until nicely browned.  The onion adds   a nice flavor.

I rarely make marinades because my husband prefers a rub, but tried this while he was at work.  I poked holes in the chops and we grilled them. He really liked it and we will make this again.  I think that I will try it with a touch of lemon pepper next time and eliminate one of the salts.

Absolutely scrumptious! Mine took a little longer to cook because the chops were quite thick - about 15 minutes on each side under the broiler. Served with steamed rich topped with cream of mushroom,and fresh broccoli steamed and topped with cheddar cheese!  Yummy!

This recipe is wonderful!! I used pork chops and cooked them on the grill. The flavor is so delicious. I poked several holes in the chops with a fork so that they soaked up the marinade really well. They smelled so good while they were cooking!!

These pork chops were really good.  I enjoyed the sweet, tangy, lemony taste.  My husband probably wasn't too happy about the soy sauce, but I thought the taste wasn't too bad.  I will make these again.

Light lemony flavor that's unique, yet not overbearing at all.  Didn't have celery salt so I substituted seasoned salt.  My boyfriend said it was great and even said I should give this marinade recipe to his dad so he could use it!  Will definetly use again!

I followed this recipe exactly as stated and this was good. Not at all what I expected. The chops were very tender and had a nice teriyaki flavoring w/ a hint of sweetness from the lemonade. Next time I will add ginger to the marinade and green onions, which I think would heighten the flavors.

I made this with 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts tonight. Marinated for 2 hours and then cooked at 300 deg. for about 40 minutes, leaving half of the marinade in the baking dish. Yummy and juicy!

I live in Australia. There is no such thing as lenonade cons., here. I used the juice of a large lemon with 1/2 of it's rind grated fine.Left it in the maranade for overnight and most of the next day. Turned out fine. Not sickly sweet like most of your American recipe's are. We who live down under like to taste the food not sugar.

These were wonderful. The flavor was very unique, yet very familiar...hard to describe. You might think that the chops would have a strong lemon flavor because of the lemonade, but that is not the case. I followed the ingredients list with no alterations, however instead of broiling I grilled the pork chops. They turned out fabulous. I will definately be sharing this one.

Great marinade. My dinky grocery story didn't have any good looking pork chops when I went shopping, so I got a pkg. of pork tenderloin (2 1-lb. loins come in a pkg). I doubled the marinade (only had 12oz cans of lemonade, and I thought I could use more since the meat was not sliced), let it sit in the fridge about 6 hours (turned them over once), the grilled them. Grilled over med/high heat for about 8 min./side, until temp was up to 160 degrees. I meant to take them off at 150 and let them sit for 10 min. to finish cooking on their own, but I missed it. Anyway, they were tender, juicy, and delicious!!!  Even though the outside was pretty charred from sitting right over the flames, but it did not ruin it at all. Maybe it held in the juice. Served with white rice and sweet potatoes. Yum!

The flavor was okay, but the chops came out super tough. I even had them marinating 2 nights! I'm not sure if maybe it was the cut of meat I bought or what. Maybe will try with thin chops.

Great recipe.  This is the only pork chop marinade I've tried that my husband has really raved about.  I strongly suggest using regular soy sauce and not subsituting low-sodium.  I don't like a lot of salt, but I had to salt this when I made it the first time with low-sodium soy sauce.  The second time, I made it with regular and it was so much better.

FIVE STARS! These chops were so tender and juicy! Great flavor, not to salty not too sweet! I marinated for the full 24 hours, except i grilled them instead of broiling. My husband went back for 3rds! This recipe is definately a keeper. I served them with a side of white rice and mixed veggies. Yummmmm!

I followed the directions to the letter (except I grilled) and it was just OK, not bad not great.  Slight lemon flavor but not overpowering at all.

This is one of my favorite recipes, and I frequently make it for my family and guests. The flavor is fresh and delicious. The marinade locks in the juices and makes the pork extremely tender. I like to use pork tenderloin, and cook slowly on the BBQ grill. This caramelizes the marinade and results in a delightful flavor and appearance. Try this recipe!

This was just okay. Expected a more "punch in your face" lemon taste but overall the flavour profile was very subtle. not sure I'd make this again.

I used this marinade on pork steaks that I put on the grill. They came out nice and tangy with a hint of sweetness. I'll definitely use it again.

This was one recipe I wont be making again. I dont know if I did something wrong, as I see so many positive reviews. I followed it down to a T, and none of us liked it.

We could barely taste the lemon at all. If I were to make it again, I'd probably just use lemon juice. Thanks anyway.

Really tasty. Cut rather large boneless pork chops in half to defrost faster then marinated for four hours. Grilled instead of broiled and boiled the marinade to baste with. Family really enjoyed.

I loved these but my hubby wasn't thrilled. I thought the sweet tangy taste was delish and served the extra over rice! try it!

All the salty seasonings added to this marinade worried me at first but, it turned out good. Not too sweet and not too salty. I bet this would be much better with chicken.

A fantastic marinade! I used this on chicken and pork and the chicken was actually better than the pork. I marinaded for about 2 hours in the fridge and they turned out GREAT!

My husband and I aren't big fans of pork chops, but we thought this recipe was good.  I marinated them for two nights and used extra seasoned salt instead of celery salt.  We grilled them on a Foreman type grill instead of broiling them.  They were good!

I used a few tablespoons of the marinade and the drippings to make gravy (because my chops were very, very thick), and everyone asked for more gravy!  This is a wonderful recipe.

What a tasty marinade for porkchops.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing I did slightly different was to marinade for 4 hours instead of overnight. My husband really enjoyed them too.

Best if after the overnight marinating, bake pork chops in a 350 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours in the marinade.

What a lovely marinade. I almost passed it by because of the lemonade concentrate ingredient, but it was a nice complement to the soy sauce. I marinated pork chops overnight and broiled them for dinner. I will definitely use this again.

Great, easy recipe with loads of flavor. First thing my son said was "I can taste the lemon!" I didn't have celery salt, so used celery seed. There's plenty of salt with the soy sauce anyway. Will make again on the grill when the snow covering it melts.

These were so good.  The tangy taste was perfect for pork chops.  I can't wait to try it with chicken.

Very yummy!
I allowed it to sit for about 24 hours, and cooked it on low on the grill.
Hubby thought it had to strong of a lemon flavor, but I loved it.

It was a decent marinade, but not one I would use very often.  I marinated overnight and it just didn't seem to impart very much flavor to the chops.

I made these pork chops a few nights ago, and my husband really liked them.  Before he even finished he was asking how soon I would make them again!

Let me start by saying I am not a lover of pork chops.  Tried this recipe and was not in love.  I did not use all the salts because my husband cannot have salt, I did use everything else.  I also didn't have time to let the pork chops soak in the lemonade mix all night, it only sat in the marinade for about 15 minutes.  I guess if you love pork chops, it's a great recipe.

These chops came out tasty. If you are worried about the taste of lemon with your pork chops, we didn't experience that. It just add some sweetest to the soyness. Thanks!
