I must admit I was a bit skeptical about this recipe, but it was excellent.  Don't be scared off by the strange combination of ingredients -- this is a hearty vegetarian meal with great flavor and texture!

I modified this recipe by only using one half of one onion (just seemed like too much otherwise).

In addition, I used about half of a can of diced tomatoes, since I wanted the sauce to be thicker.

I used a little cheese, and, since my family doesn't like peppers, I omitted them, and used diced avocado as a garnish for color and flavor.

Definitely will make again!

This recipe is fabulous!  I ommitted the olives, used extra salsa (fresh "Mi Abuelo brand from the refrigerated section of Sam's Club--excellent!), and farfalle (bowtie) pasta.
I then topped it with melted colby/jack and sour cream, mixed it all together and reheated it to make a warm, creamy sauce.  Top it off with crumbled blue corn chips and you'll be in comfort-food heaven!!!  It was so good that I made it again as soon it was gone!!!  Tip:  I didn't like the McCormick taco seasoning as well as other brands.  The Taco Bell brand was amazing!!!

"Good" pasta. Not great but certainly NOT bad either! I omitted the beans and used a whole can of corn (drained). Also, I added 2 TBLS of sour cream and the end and mixed it in to better make a sauce. This recipe is a cross between a pasta casserole and a chili..but good! I think some seasoned grilled chicken strips could add a nice touch as well..or even some shredded cheddar cheese. Thanks Mimi.

Everyone loved this recipe! I doubled everything except the beans. I used Rotel in place of plain stewed tomatoes. It had just the right amount of zing! This will be a tried and true cookbook addition.

This was a great recipe.  I didn't have any black beans, so I used a whole can of corn.  I used a can of Rotel tomatoes.  The combination of ingredients sounds strange, but tasted excellent.  Will definitely make this again!

This was really good!  I was a little worried because it sounded like an odd mixture of ingredients, but it turned out well.  It was also very colorful ~ it would be a pretty dish to bring to a potluck dinner.

For some reason I read this as a pasta salad not warm pasta.  So I made it that way.  Don't like olives or green bell pepper so I didn't add either.  Used farfalle pasta and an entire package of reduced sodium taco seasoning as well as diced canned tomatoes with mild jalapeno peppers.

It didnt look too appetizing at first so I was a little scared.  However, after the first bite we were sold.  It was delicious!  I followed the recipe except I used Penne because that was all I had.  It was a little too dense so next time i'll use the seashell pasta. We also topped with cheddar cheese.  I will definately make again

This was okay as written. Made it again and added about one cup of salsa. Originally found it to be a little dry when reheating...

This was a hit! Used red pepper instead of green, can of mild Rotel instead of tomatoes & salsa. Fabulous, quick & easy dish with the slightest touch of heat.

This was pretty good. I used only one onion and more like 1/2 cup of salsa with onions and green pepper in it. I also put in more corn, olives, and taco seasoning. I didn't feel like 1 1/2 tablespoons was enough of the seasoning. But it came out tasty and my boyfriend enjoyed it too.

Not only is this recipe yummy and versatile, it's easy and inexpensive to make. All these ingredients are pantry staples for me, and likely for most people. I haven't tried it yet but next I'm going to add in some shredded chicken breast. The "sauce" would be great served over baked chicken, too, I think. One quick tip - don't cook the bean mixture too long. The beans will get overcooked quickly and be a little mushy.

We liked this. I made exactly as written but use ditalini pasta instead of shells b/c i didnt have shells and omitted the black olives b/c of allergies. This makes alot. Next time I think I may cut it in half. Four people ate it and I still have a quart leftover. Thanks!

As I put this all together, it just looked like salsa poured over pasta, and I thought it would be bad, but the  taste of the beans and corn mix nicely with pasta (I used whole wheat).  Nothing I would serve to company but something cheap and nutritious for the family

I made this for dinner tonight and it was great.  I didn't have any black beans, so I skipped them.  I also wanted some protein, so I added chicken breast and topped it off with some shredded Cheddar cheese.  Next time I'll definitely add the beans, keep the chicken and maybe throw in some rice too.  It's a very versatile recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

To make it a little healthier I used whole wheat elbow macaroni because that's what I had on hand. I also used a onion and 3 pepper mix and added some green pepper frozen mix. I only used a tablespoon of taco mix because that's all I had. Quick easy and pretty healthy.

This was so quick and so easy.  My husband and I loved it. You only need to use one onion though especially if you use a chucky or spicy salsa.  You could easily double it and make it for a crowd.  It is almost chili like.  Yum!

This was fabulous!! My family recently adopted a vegan lifestyle, and this was one of the first recipes we tried. You definitely won't miss the meat when you make this. I made one change, though: I traded the pasta out for cooked brown rice. Everyone in my family adored it. I'll be making this again for sure!

This was a perfect quick meal for my family which includes a five year old and a three year old. I added about a half pound of ground turkey and kept it to half an onion. I only had chopped olives on hand but they worked out perfectly. I also used red bell pepper instead of green. My nine month old baby even liked the pasta pieces! Thanks for the great meal idea!

This wasn't bad.  I was definatly a big fan of all the vegatables included in this meal. The only thing that I would change is to store the leftover pasta and and bean mixture seperatly.  Otherwise the pasta soaks up all the liquid and makes it kind of dry.

Very good, surprisingly so. Quick and easy. I reduced the onion to half of one and used yellow pepper. It has great flavour and makes a lot. Could be could with ground meat as well (for meat eaters).

Pretty good! I halved the recipe and cheated by using a nice chuncky black bean and corn salsa in place of the corn, beans and tomatoes (so for half a recipe, I'd say I used a heaping cup of salsa).  I think it needs some sour cream and/or shredded cheddar for garnish to make it complete, but we really liked this.

Needed a vegetarian mexican dish when my granddaughter can for a visit. Gooled and found this one. It was awsome! Everyone loved it. I will be making this again.

I added sour cream to the sauce and topped with cheese, it was delicious!  My husband didn't even notice that it had no meat until I told him!  Thanks for sharing!

I loved cooking this recipe. It was fun to prepare and cook. My boyfriend enjoyed it a lot. He loves mexican food and it was a hit. I added some chili powder, as he loves spicy food... This recipe is a keeper! :D

This is very similar to a cold Mexican Pasta Salad I have made from a Moosewood Cookbook.  So this would taste great cold as well as hot and the veggies would not need to be cooked!  The only thing we did with the corn was (because it was frozen) dropped it in boiling water for about a minute.  Made this tonight, the kids loved it!

we all (including my 2 year old) really enjoyed this for dinner. i made a few alterations:  added garlic in with the peppers and onion used one onion instead of 2 used a whole can of corn kidney beans instead of black beans added some chopped cilantro added a spoonful of sour cream at the end  topped each bowlful with shredded cheddar cheese  i think it will make delicious leftovers (reheated in the stove) and i think i will do what another reviewer suggested and add crumbled tortilla chips to the mix.  i love that you can adjust it to whatever you have on hand and its pretty well rounded. thanks for a new staple item!

This recipe is an incredibly yummy quick dish! Very healthy and high in fiber~
and quite delicious. The standard recipe is for 4 people but it made a huge batch--more like enough for 6 people. I would like to try substituting the pasta for rice next time..I bet that will be delicious also!

I read a bunch of reviews for this and made some of my own changes and it came out delicious! I made this for a dinner party so I tripled the batch-I used 3 boxes of whole wheat shells that I boiled in a giant pot while sautéing 2 yellow onions in another pot with a little salt and pepper, Cajun spices, and chili powder. Then I added 3 cans each of black beans and corn-putting some of the liquid from them into the wok. Then I added lime juice from two limes (one probably would have been enough), two cans of rotel tomatoes, cilantro, and a small jar of salsa. Once the pasta was done (I boiled it for about 8 minutes) I drained it and returned it to the large pot and added a block of cream cheese. I heated it until it was melted and then added the wok of all the other stuff. And then I put in two packets of Taco Bell seasoning and mixed it up over heat until everything was hot. We ate it out of bowls and added sour cream, cheese, sliced avocado, and verde hot sauce. Everyone loved it!

This is really really good but it needs salt. Alot of it. Also it tastes much better cold. the flavors blend nice. I used two TBSP of the taco mix as it didn't taste like much...also added cilanto from my garden to give it a jump start. Will make again, i really liked the combo

This was a great easy recipe that came together in about 25 minutes!   I substituted the beans for ground turkey and added "Taco Seasoning I" from this site instead of packaged seasoning.  I probably added 3 tablespoons of the mix because I like it spicy.  I topped it with some sharp cheddar.  Great recipe that I will make again!

Tasty. I loved the mexican flavor without it being overbearing. The change I made was I substituted the beans for hamburger because my husband doesn't like beans.

Great meatless dish!  My husband loved it, and so did I.  The only thing we can't agree on is the olives.  I wasn't a fan of the flavor they added, but my husband enjoyed them.  We added a little shredded cheese on top.  Even our 16 month old daughter devoured this dish.  Overall, a quick and easy dinner.  Highly recommend!

I don't why some people wrote they were iffy about this recipe, I thought it sounded great from the beginning! What's not to like?? It was GREAT! And very easy to make, which comes from a college student. I plan on making the "sauce" with brown rice and putting in a burrito too!

LOVE IT!!  Like some of the others suggested, I added some sour cream, chopped up some avocado for some additional color, and added some cheese to the top.  I didn't have green peppers, so I used red (which I actually prefer), and omitted the olives.  My kids and my husband couldn't get enough of it!

two onions would have been way too much. i doubled the recipe and used One onion and only one can tomatoes and that was plenty for us (my husband still thought it was too much onion). Next time i'd consider using no onion or diced tomatoes and adding more salsa instead. Great idea though! Quick, easy and tastes pretty good

I made this one, and I followed it except I added shredded cheddar cheese and didn't have taco seasonings so I used Chili powder, and that was fine. I liked it, and I would make it again. Very easy.

This was great! It can be made with any type of pasta (I only had elbow macaroni at home so I used that). This is even great as a dip with tortilla chips (Minus the pasta). I added chilli sauce, cilantro, a jalapeno pepper and it came out even better!

This is a good recipe, but we felt that it needed a little more flavor.  We added some sour cream to make it creamy, added some roasted cumin, used rotini pasta, a red pepper instead of a green pepper, and added some jalapeno.  After all of these additions, the pasta was really good.

interestingly good, the first few bites I wasn't entirely liking it, but after that it just got better and better.  I used red pepper instead of green, 1 cup of corn instead of 1/2, omitted black olives and added 1 tsp cumin with the onions and peppers while cooking.  I will make it again

I'm giving 5 stars because it was really easy to make and tasted great.  It went over well and got compliments.  The only changes I made were that I used fire-roasted diced tomatoes instead of plain.  I also added one jalapeno and used slightly more seasoning (Trader Joe's brand) and olives than it said.  It turned out perfectly spicy and I didn't even have to add cayenne (which I do for most things I cook).  Again, I highly recommend this one.  Great one for a beginning vegan such as myself.

This ROCKS!  I added 3 cloves of garlic chopped to the onions and used frozen chopped gr. pepper.  I used an entire can of black olives and sliced them (I love them).  I did drain the tomatoes as I was not sure to do this.  I added some salsa verda which made this nice and spicy.  Garnished with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream!  I LOVE THIS!  What a wonderful dish and meatless meal.

So So good. 
Used mac noodles and a full package of organic corn...because you can't have to much.  I made a double batch. Used the taco spice 1 recipe here on all recipes.
 Someone suggested adding sour cream. . .  I just tested it in a bowl. I like it both ways. So I am serving with SC on the side!I bet with that thicker noodle it would have rocked!  could easily add groud anything for meat eaters!

This recipe was both simple and delicious. I didn't add the green pepper and olives just due to family preference. Used a fresh ear of corn, advocado and because we are doing a vegan challenge this week (we are vegetarian) I added a bit of vegan cream cheese. I fed it to a roomful of manly carnivores and they devoured it!! Excellent recipe!

I don't like to review a recipe if I have altered it, but it tastes very good so I will tell you what I did.
I had a can of tomatoes, a can of creamed corn, and a can of black eyed peas. To these I added purple onion (what I had), and the chopped black olives. I had no green pepper. I did have some sun dried tomatoes so I added those. I did not have salsa. I had some hummus I made yesterday, so I put about 1/4 of a cup of that in. I used the whole envelope of taco seasoning mix, gradually taste testing til it all ended up in there!
I didn't have any pasta, so I have brown rice in the rice cooker right now, and will serve the sauce over the rice.
I think this is a very forgiving recipe, put in what you have. It would be good with sour cream or plain yogurt, and avocado on the side. Also, could be made a bit hotter with some sort of chili's.
Like I said, if I didn't alter it, I would give it 5 stars. But I can't rate what I didn't actually make. I love my version.

This was yummy and filling-coming from a meat lover ;)
Had my vegetarian cousin down for 10 days and was hunting for some good dishes, I recommend this dish to all. The only thing I did different was put half the can of tomatoes and next time I will add more spices. Maybe a thyme leaf! I used a whole can of corn and the whole can of black beans which made up for not using the full can of tomatoes.
Really enjoyed and recommend. Thanks for sharing.
5 stars.

Hubby and I really enjoyed this.  I followed the recipe exactly and used Taco Seasoning I from this site which is so much better than the package stuff because there's less salt and preservatives.  The flavors in this really go well together.  What a great weeknight meal!  Thanks for sharing.

This was a fine, quick dinner especially if you are short on time and have no meat available!  I only used 1/2 an onion, left out the corn and used chili powder, cumin and oregano in place of the taco seasoning.  Also added cheese.

I used Bill Echols recipe for Taco Seasoning (I use this for everything) and added 1/2C sour cream, upped the salsa to 1/2C, added 1/2 a 10oz bag of baby spinach, 1/2C cheddar to the mix and threw it in the oven (also used frozen peppers onion mix and added that to the pasta 1 minute before draining, along with the corn) for 20 min. at 350 so I could prepare salads. An excellent Meatless Monday meal, and super quick!!!

Yummy! I substituted rotel tomatoes. Did not use peppers, onions, or salsa. Added 1 lb ground turkey, 4 oz of velveta, and 2 TBS of taco sauce (I was out of salsa).  Thanks for the inspiration! I can't wait to take it to work's potluck tomorrow.

Very, very tasty...with more taco seasoning and cumin.  I used kidney beans (drained) as DS doesn't like black beans.  I also added unseasoned cooked ground beef and onion as I had some leftover.  To make it a one-dish recipe, I also added 1 8-oz. can of tomato sauce and 2-3 cans of water before tossing in the uncooked pasta (used macaroni as that's what was on hand).

I'm always a little leery when I see things like pre-packaged taco seasoning and salsa as ingredients in a recipe, as you could end up with something akin to Hamburger Helper (which I love, but I'm not about to go out and buy loads of ingredients and devote time to cooking something that tastes like it), but this is pretty good. I think it needs some cheese, but it's still fine (and probably healthier) without it.

This was really good and my 2 year old enjoyed it.  My only suggestion is to use a whole package or 2 packages of the taco seasoning.  This will give it more flavor otherwise it's a little bland.

This is a great recipe, for one because I am a vegetarian, and two because it just tastes great. I did not worry about the pepper because I made and canned salsa when we harvested, which includes diced peppers. The diced tomatoes and corn were also from the garden. It is a great recipe for using up what you grew in the garden, and it is quite simple to concoct. Adding some shredded cheese to the top and a dollop of sour cream really adds to the already great flavor. I recommend it!

Although skeptical at first, I loved this recipe!  I cut the onion in half, and used Rotel instead of the regular diced tomatoes.  Very impressive!  Even my very picky son ate it!  Thanks for a great recipe, which will be made again.

A great quick-fix meal!
If you're out of taco seasoning, use one of the recipes on this site or salt/cumin/paprika/chili powder to taste. 
I also added some sour cream to the finished dish to make a creamy sauce.

I made this last night and thought it was pretty good. 2 of my kids did not like it but my picky eater loved it and took the rest to school today for lunch. I doubled the recipe, added a small can of tomato sauce and a half cup of sour cream bc it was a bit dry. I used lime cilantro salsa by Muir Glen.  Also, I didn’t feel like chopping so I used the frozen 3-pepper and onion blend.

This was a nice cross between italian and mexican.  My husband was confused at first bite because he expected a nice tomatoe sauce..but then was pleasantly suprised with all the delicious mexican flavors.  I did add sour cream to the sauce the last few minutes of cooking and topped with some shredded cheese.  I also used spaghetti because that's the pasta the kiddies wanted.  Will make again for a different but good dish.

Great recipe. I used canned diced tomatoes with jalepanos which added a bit of a kick to the meal. I also mixed in a spoonful of sourcream which improved the taste as well. Served in a tortilla this one was a hit.

Super yummy! I did change the pepper to zucchini and it still tasted good. I think the salsa and taco seasoning really made this dish, gives it great flavor. Had the  next day, cold, it had dried out a little but still good.

This is a delicious recipe! I added lean ground beef, to give it an extra boost of protein, but otherwise I followed the recipe. I did add a bit more of the taco seasoning because of the added meat. Very Good!

I didn't find it liquid-y enough to coat the pasta noodles, so I added 3/4 cup of chicken broth and 3/4 cup of sour cream. Also added red pepper chips, ground beef and shredded cheese. Overall, I liked it.

Everyone I made this for loved it. Since no one in our group was a vegan, I added some sour creme and shredded chedder to the entire batch.  For the meat lovers in our group I sauted some sausage in a seperate pan and added it to half of the batch.

Thanks for the great recipe,Mimi!!  This was easy to make and delicious.  I added fat-free sour cream and chicken. This will be on my dinner menu often.

Very quick and easy and has a great taste.  The kids loved it too.  This is ideal for a quick and easy luch, re-warms nicely too.  Surprisingly satisfying.

I've been making this many years now, mostly serving in the summer for dinner. I don't change the ingredients, except we don't have organic seashell pasta by us so we use whatever pasta is available and I always add extra salsa when serving. Turns out wonderful.

Very tasty.

I didn't use all the pasta the recipe called for. I think 1/3 pound is plenty. Additionally I used 1/2 cup salsa and doubled the taco seasoning.

I'll definitely make this again!

I made this as part of a health push we are doing at home. Very little in the way of processing is done to make this. it was fairly quick and painless, while tasting good. I used whole wheat noodles and didn't add salt&pepper, it didn't need it.

Second time I’ve made this and oddly enough the second time it went over great!  Used Costco’s edamame spaghetti and my own blend for taco seasoning (cumin, oregano, coriander, paprika and chipotle chili powder. Will use the leftover sauce for meatless Monday burritos.

This is one of my favorites, esp. in the summer, as it's great cold and as leftovers.  I make it exactly as it is written,  but I like to add a bit of salsa as condiment.

DELICIOUS. Easy to customize to suit your dietary needs. In our case, we're low sodium. We used cooked dried black beans, frozen corn, and DIY taco seasoning and salsa. We used the veggie-rich pasta.

I followed the exact recipe except I added some chopped jalapeños for a little spice! I am not a vegan so I added some sour cream and finely shredded cheddar cheese to my plate and I could honestly eat this every day. My boyfriend is a vegan so he doesn't add the dairy but he agrees, we could eat this every day. So good!

Super easy recipe, nice flavor, great texture, very filling. I liked the little pop of olive flavor here and there. It survived substitution of farfalle and trotolle that I needed gone, as well as cutting the taco seasoning in favor of some spices I already had on hand.

Awesome. Came out looking exactly like the picture..Doubled up on the pasta, and did 1 green and 1 red bell pepper, yellow onion, and a can of Cuban style black beans..pace picante mild salsa. Great flavor, and really good. Only thing I would add to it is maybe diced green chilies. Soooooo tasty. Would absolutely make this again...

This is my kind of recipe.  I made it with Banza pasta (chickpea pasta) and canned tomato with chiles.  And Kroger Private Selection chipotle chile pepper salsa.  I had a red pepper not green so I used that.  No oil, I used veggie broth to saute the onion and red pepper.  It pairs well with guacamole.  So easy, delicious and vegan.  What's not to love?

This dish was a hit with my family! My fiance doesn't eat olives, so I made it with double corn (on a tip from another reviewer.) I also threw in a packet of Trader Joe's meatless 'ground beef' (don't remember the actual name of this product but it is fantastic - this is coming from an extreme skeptic of meat replacements.) I also used threw in some additional mild salsa to make it more of a sauce consistency.

Delicious and going in the rotation. My modifications were 1 onion, half a can of black beans, 1\2 cup of cheddar cheese,  and 4 oz of cream cheese.  Each serving was sprinkled with Cotija cheese. Great reheated.

Instead of using pasta, I made the ingredients as listed, added some taco seasoned ground turkey (don't need the taco seasoning then) and put this over a salad.  It works very well with the Taylor Farms packaged southwest salad kit.  Good warm, or cold from the fridge left over.  My family couldn't get enough.

I liked it but it was a bit too bland for our tastebuds.  Next time, I will double the salsa, add garlic, and add some jalapenos or other  roasted hot peppers.    A dash of cayenne or some other ground chile pepper may also be good in place of the roasted peppers.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars based on the advise given by many of the reviewers. I substituted Rotel diced tomatoes and green chilis and 1/2 cup plain diced tomatoes for the diced tomatoes. I added 1/3 cup of salsa instead of just 1/4th. I also added 1 heaping teaspoon of freshly ground cumin and 1/3 teaspoon of garlic powder. I used 1 cup of frozen corn, omitted the black olives and one of the onions. To finish, I sprinkled sharp cheddar cheese on top and a sliced avocado. After all of those changes, this was a hit with my family. I think that the addition of the Rotel tomatoes/chilis, cumin and garlic were the most important changes that I made. Without these changes, it probably would have been a little bland. I will definitely make this again.

I made this for my roommate and I tonight and it was quick and super easy! We used a green chili pepper olive oil and a taco season blend from some local companies in AZ that we love and it gave it a great kick!! Next time I'll probably use more corn than indicated and I'd definitely recommend using a half cup of salsa rather than one fourth. Will definitely keep this handy!!

Substituted whole wheat spaghetti, added an extra 15oz diced tomato and used a whole 15oz can of black olives, topped with little kosher salt. Refrigerated overnight, served at a party next day, people couldn't get enough.

I made it as written.  The amount of onion seemed like a lot, so I picked the smallest onions I could find.  In the end, the onions and green peppers overwhelmed the dish.  If I were to make this again, I'd at least cut that amount in half, increase the beans and corn and potentially add some sour cream or cheese.  I really don't know why the salsa is even in there - you can't taste it in such a small quantity.

Very tasty with just the right amount of spice. I forgot to pick up onions, so I had to use onion powder. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Very quick and easy meal.  I will definitely be making this again!

I used more veggies and extra seasoning. Rotel tomatoes (28 oz can) and omitted the black olives since my husband doesn't like them. Throw on a dollop of sour cream. Wonderful with the Mexican Chicken recipe on here!

I thought this was going to be terrible.  Boy, was I wrong!  We barely had any leftovers.  Made some minor changes - only used 1/2 onion, no bell peppers or salsa,  whole can of mexicorn,  whole can of Rotel for diced tomatoes, added some cayenne pepper, used 1 pkg of taco seasoning (will cut back a little next time), and stirred in sour cream near the end.  Fantastic!!!

Quick and easy to make, and definitely delicious. Went over quite well with the family, and made enough for leftovers! It wasn't anything incredible, but it's definitely a recipe worth keeping for a quick and easy meal that won't disappoint.

We halfed the amount of onion and it was still a bit much. Plus, we admit, we missed the meat.

This recipe was dissapointing. I expected a lot of flavor with all the ingredients and didn't see how this dish could go wrong but it fell flat. I don't want to have to eat the leftovers.  I will not be making this ever again.

Another quick and easy favorite. I made some small changes and it was amazing. I used red pepper not green and cut back on the onion. One thing I did that I believe made a big difference is using frozen roasted corn and canned roasted tomatoes. A good salsa makes a difference too. Top with a good shredded cheese and tortilla chips and you have a great easy meal.

I feel like this recipe will please anyone - I served it because I had a vegan friend eating over - everyone loved it! I used a fresh tomato instead of canned, I used an entire can of corn that had some peppers in it and added a small can of green chilies.  I also used a mix of shell & rotini noodles.  I omitted onions since I don't like them and used a bit more black olives.  It was more than enough to feed 4.  Loved that this was healthy & tasty!  I can see it being fantastic with ground turkey/beef added or omitting the noodles and serving in tortillas!

I liked this very much . I used green chilies (small  can) for olives. I added a little cumin and chili powder and garlic salt. You could add vegetable broth and have a nice soup.

This salad was a big hit. Even the grandkids liked it, although they picked out the beans. I doubled the corn and black olives. I would consider taking this to a potluck. It is easy to throw together at a moment's notice.

Doubled the recipe and got 8 servings even though I had to short it a can of beans because I ran out of room in my pan. I just used one packet (1.25 oz) of reduced sodium taco seasoning and it was plenty.

I thought this was really tasty!  I took a couple of additional suggestions that sounded good.  I used 1 can of corn drained, 1 can of black beans drained, one small can of olives drained and 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chiles.  I also added about 3-4 tbsp of cream cheese and some Colby jack cheese to make it creamier and cheesier.  I would even add more corn and olives next time.  Oh and I added a little extra salsa for extra flavor.

This was yummy!!  My husband has intestinal issues, which means he's basically on a vegetarian diet right now, so I am trying to find filling and satisfying non-meat meals.  This was just that!  Although I love olives, we had none, so I omitted them, and left out the corn, too.  I used red and orange peppers that I had in the frig, black beans, and 1 onion.  I also don't cook with those taco seasoning packets, but instead use 2 parts chili pepper to 1 part garlic powder, and a little chipotle seasoning.  With the black beans, you really don't miss the meat.  And although it seems like the flavors will not go together, they do!  I will make this again!!  It came out fantastic!

Very good! My husband likes to have meat with every meal so I added some ground turkey burger to this pasta and it was great! 
Although, we tend to like things a little spicy so I added a few dashes of ceyenne pepper and it turned out great.

Was really good, I love pasta and beans so for me was a good combination.  I used a can of red kidney beans instead of black beans, turned out well and it was very colorful! The kids liked it!

This was a pretty good recipe! Easy to cook and definitely made a lot of food. I cut back on the onion, only using one half of an onion instead of two and added some jalapenos (from a jar) for a kick. I would highly recommend that and I wish I had put in more!

I agree with the others- it does seem like an odd combo, but it's pretty tasty. I used Cavatappi noodles and swapped the corn for a can of hominy. I also omitted the black beans since I didn't have any and followed the suggestion of other reviewers to add 2T of Mexican sour cream to the sauce to liven it up. The taco seasoning/salsa combo ended up being a bit too zingy for my kids, but my husband and I thought it was delicious. Thanks!

I liked it. Followed the directions exactly except I left out the olives. I used Taco Seasoning I on this site as suggested by other reviewers. For the taco seasoning, I left out the chili powder as I like it a little milder. It worked well. Next time I make this, I will make it with rice instead of pasta.

Loved it!  Teh recveiws were very helpful.  I borrowed several ideas.  Used one onion and substituted ro-tel tomatoes.  Served it with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of broken tortilla chips.  I think I will try substituting brown rice for the pasta next time.

Very tasty. Didn't have fresh onion so sprinkled on some dried chopped onion. Don't like green pepper or olives so didn't use them. Don't know how people are calling it bland - didn't even "salt and pepper" to taste - salsa and taco seasoning are salty enogh. Used whole can of corn (drained.) Added about 4 Tblspns of neufchatel cheese. Maybe I didn't drain cans as well as I should have - would have liked sauce to be a bit thicker.

This is really tasty.  A vegetarian version of chili mac. Will definitely make again.  I left out the black olives.  Used hot salsa (Herdez brand.  Also, I don't like packaged taco seasoning mix so I used a mixture which I use when I make tacos.  The mixture contains chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and cayenne pepper.

Delicious and a fun twist on the boring old pasta salad. I doubled the amount of taco seasoning and added 3 tablespoons of sour cream to thicken the sauce. Best eaten warm.

The basics of this recipe are good, but like some other members, I tasted it when it was cooking and found it bland.    For starters I only used a half of a moderately large onion instead of two onions, a whole can of corn, and upped the amount of salsa from 1/4 cup to a full cup.  Before it was rather dry, and I think the extra salsa not only spiced it up, but gave it some extra liquid that it needed.  I also used more taco seasoning than the recipe called for, and added a bit of chili pepper with my salt and pepper (with just a tiny dash of garlic powder).  I think those adjustments gave it the kick it was missing.  Next time, I'm going to take some suggestions from other reviewers and add some sour cream and pepperjack cheese to it.  Maybe a bag of Morningstar's fake ground beef crumbles (or regular ground beef for you meat eaters!).    It's a good recipe, I think it just needs a little customization to make it less bland.

Oh my gosh, this is fantastic!  It tasted fresh and wholesome--because it was!  A yummy meatless meal--but you could easily add some diced chicken or ground turkey or beef.  It's easy and inexpensive.  I followed the recipe except for the bell pepper because I didn't have one on hand that night.  I'd say the taco seasoning is unnecessary--next time I'll just throw in a bit more salsa.  I'll also use rotini pasta (I use whole wheat); we're not that fond of shell pasta.  I really love that this dish can be adjusted to one's liking so easily.  Oh, we threw a sprinkling of Cheddar cheese over our servings, which added even more yumminess...

Very tasty! I didn't use olives or salsa (I love them, just didn't have any on hand) added jalapeno's and "Fiesta blend" cheese at the end- VERY good. Thanks!

My 4 year old cleaned his plate! My family cannot eat tomatos, so I took those and the salsa out, but with 4 oz of cheese added at the end, we didn't miss the flavor.  I also added black pepper and garlic, and it made a very tasty dish.

This has become one of my family's faves! This recipe could be customized a million different ways to fit anyone's individual tastes. It's almost better left over! We add cheese when we eat it and there's no need for side dishes as this is a super hearty meal. Great recipe!!

I really enjoyed this recipe!!  It was great as a left over as well.  I also added the sour cream at the end of the recipe and found it to be more tasty.  I also added ground beef for my husband (he won't eat anything without meat lol)  This one has made its way to my recipe book!

This did not go over as well as I thought it would. Everyone ate it, but no one had seconds (which never happens when it's pasta). I probably won't make it again.

Easy & colorful dish. I modified this as others suggested - only used 1 onion & added 1lb of lean ground meat, which meant more seasoning was needed. The sour cream is really good with it too. I might try it with some fresh cilantro next time.

I found this recipe years ago and never reviewed it. Then I couldn't remember what it was called and have been wanting to make it again. We used to eat it all the time and it is so good. Sometimes I add a little sour cream or pepper jack cheese.

This was a great recipe!! I loved how easy it was. It was very easy to play around with too. I didn't use black beans or olives, but I used a whole can of corn and I chopped two chicken breast to put in it too. It was a hit with our family! Next time I want to try it as a dip or on taco shells!

I have been looking for a tasty vegan pasta salad and decided to try this (as a salad, not a cooked entree). It was great!  Definitely better when chilled overnight.  I made the recipe as written, except I added extra corn, peppers, and fresh tomatoes, put lime juice on top, and did not cook any of the veggies.  Very tasty the next day!

This is a very simple everyday recipe.  It is really easy to vary the ingredients to your taste.  You can also vary the flavor completely by using different types of salsa.  I used mango salsa which turned out great.

I omitted the beans since I didn't have any on hand, and used spiral pasta instead. For the taco seasoning, I used the hot instead of mild for extra spice.

This was a great dish for company. No meat kept the cost down with keeping up the well balanced meals we all need. We enjoyed topping the pasta with cheese and sour cream for "zest".

I think if you like chili mac with veggies, you'll like this.  I did make modifications, but only because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I omitted the bell pepper, olives and taco seasoning, and used dried garlic and onion.  I also made my own seasoning out of lime juice, oregano, chili powder, and crushed red pepper.  I used fresh tomatoes and about 1/2 c. of medium salsa.
I used flax pasta, and topped the dish off with colby jack cheese.  It was DELISH as well as filling, quick, easy and inexpensive.  I do recommend trying it out.

This recipe is awesome!  I rarely eat all veggie meals and usually end up putting some kind of meat in it, but this one didn't need any!  I omitted the olives and added extra salsa as well and it was great!  I highly reccomend!

This turned out fantastic!  I was really concerned as to how it would work over pasta, but it did.  I used whole wheat pasta and it really stood up to the recipe (maybe more than white pasta would).  I added some chiles, some soy cheese and some vegan sour cream and it was so tasty!  Will definitely make again.

i hated this over pasta. the base of the dish is good but could use some kick. would add jalapeño next time and serve over rice.  modifications i made this time: 3tbs of taco seasoning, 1tbs cumin, 14oz of chopped olives. also added a sprinkle of cheese and dollop of sour cream as others suggested.  would  be great with some kick, and served over rice.

Good and filling!  I used multi-grain macaroni instead of the shell pasta, and diced tomatoes with green chiles.  I had a red pepper, so I used that and only about 1 Tbs of oil.  I also added scallions, fresh cilantro and a dollop of fat free sour cream to finish it off.  Very yummy!

This was fantastic recipe. Very tasty. My kids gobbled it up too. I didn't had beans, so made it without it, but still turned out great.

I made this just like the recipe said, with the exception of sprinkling a little colby-jack cheese on top of each bowl.  We loved it.  Next time I might try to add some cooked ground beef, but it was just fine without.

This was good. I browned about 1/3 lb of ground beef with the onions and peppers to add a little more heartiness to this dish and I used pinto beans instead of black beans (personal taste)as well as using almost 1 cup of corn instead of 1/2 cup. We topped it off with a sprinkle of colby jack cheese. My suggestion would be to use Rotel instead of the plain diced tomatoes. This just wasn't spicy enough...and I don't like things terribly spicy. I think the Rotel will give it just the right amount of spiciness. My husband's suggestion was to definitely use black beans. He said the pinto beans just didn't give it enough flavor. Thanks for this recipe!

Great recipe.  I didn't have any mozarella on hand, so I made it without baking it.  Wonderful as a side dish or as a main dish, even without the cheese.

Great dish! Lots of flavor and very easy. My 12 year old son made this by himself. We also added shredded cheese and some extra cumin. Thanks, we'll make this again.

This was a good pasta dish!  nice change for a vegetarian variety!  We used black soy beans instead of regular black beans and sprinkled cheese on top.  Next time I would do something different to the sauce, like add sour cream as others suggested or spice it up a bit in some way.  Overall, it was tasty.

Made as described EXCEPT skipped the olives and added 1/2 a brick of cream cheese to the sauce.  It tasted healthy and filling, but I would definitely add more seasonings and more cream cheese and or sour cream to make it really mexican-y and creamy.  Also added some shredded mexican cheese on top - this added some much-needed flavor.

This recipe is just delicious. A real nice change for us vegans who end up eating a lot of the same things all the time. I used tri-colored rotini instead of the seashell pasta which gave the dish lots of interesting colors. Very good.

My boyfriend liked this recipe allthough I felt it was missing something.  I felt that it could have used more sauce or some type of meat.  Even though my boyfriend picked it for the purpose of being low calorie or fat, I felt that lean sausage would have made this better.  We'll try it again but next time with the sausage and a bit extra sauce.

This was quick, easy, and quite good! It had a nice taco-salad sort of taste to it and will make great leftovers for lunch. Lots of beans and veggies make it very nutritious and very filling! It made quite a bit more than four servings, though...
