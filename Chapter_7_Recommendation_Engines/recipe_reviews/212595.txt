I make this recipe all the time! My kids love it & I always get asked for this recipe! I add a small chopped onion to the ground beef & 1 tsp garlic powder & a dash of worchestershire sauce. Fabulous!

I used spicy BBQ sauce instead of the ketchup!  I will NOT do canned sloppy joes again! :)

My husband and daughter liked this.  I thought it was okay.  Tasted a little too much like tomato soup, but I can fix that by spicing it up a bit more next time.  Also, I'll saute some onion and green pepper to add more flavor.  Good starter recipe, tho.  It will be easy to make it my own.

This was pretty quick and easy. To make it a little healthier I used, Healthy Request Tomato Soup & Ground Turkey. For a little calcium, I added a slice of cheese on top. Pretty good overall, and I will make again.

The reason I gave this recipe 5 stars is because my husband and my daughter love it. (It's very hard to please them with cooking sometimes). 

This is a very light, non-spicy recipe. (I really emphasize the non-spicy part. It is as non-spicy as sloppy joes can get!)

(As for myself, I don't like it so much, its not spicy enough for me. But I add my own stuff on the side to it)

I made this dish for my family and they did not care for the taste.  I followed the dish and used the sema ingredients, but the dish was a little salty.

The recipe is nice and simple but left alone the taste is missing something. I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder and onion powder as well as pepper, 2 tsp worchestershire sauce and 1tsp of bbq sauce and salted to taste with 1/3 cup brown sugar and it turned out great!
