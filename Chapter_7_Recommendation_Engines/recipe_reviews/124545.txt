This is the biscuit recipie I've been looking for!  I DID make 2 changes from how it is written:
1) I misread the measurements, so I ended up using 2 tsp instead of Tbs of sugar
2) I never roll out biscuits.  I was tought to turn out your dough, then pat it out so you don't get too thin nor too tough.  It hasn't let me down yet.
That said, these biscuits turned out flakey, tender, & moist.  We had chipped beef gravy for supper as well as trying them just with butter. I got 10 biscuits from the batch & though there are only 2 of us, there are none left(the DH just came out of the kitchen with the last 2, a jar of jelly, & a smile on his face).  Thank you for the perfect biscuit recipie!

The best biscuits EVER!  This is TOTALLY my one and only from now on. I didn't roll them out though - simply turned the dough over twice with lots of flour and patted it down - made for thick and fluffy biscuits without the tough texture that can be so easily produced.  Thanks for a FAB recipe!

My aunt asked me to make baking powder biscuits to bring for Thanksgiving so I did a trial run today.  These were so easy and came out just as I'd hoped!  I only used 3/4 of a tablespoon of sugar and I added a tad more salt.  I also used butter instead of shortening for more flavor.  I floured my hands and put the dough onto some floured parchment paper.  The dough is sticky but I added a little extra flour as I turned it over a couple of times.  I barely worked the dough for fear it would get tough.  I just flattened it out to about an inch thickness, floured the rim of a small glass and cut the dough into circles.  You then can lift the parchment and pull the circle off and place it on the baking sheet.  I brushed some melted butter on top of half of them and even added some garlic powder and parsley flakes to a few for experimentation purposes.  The dough made 12 biscuits using a 2 and 1/2 inch glass.  They rose to a nice height and were light and flaky.  I definitely think the dough should be at least 1" think when cutting them out, you could probably even go a little thicker.  All of my experiments were very tasty but my favorite is when they are hot with butter and honey-wow!  I have also made a similar biscuit recipe using the "drop" method with shredded sharp cheddar cheese and garlic mixed into the dough.  Thanks for a delicious and very easy recipe.

Biscuits so tender they bordered on fragile. I turned the dough over on a floured surface, just 8 times until it would roughly hold together, before patting out the dough, rather than rolling it. I think I would leave out the sugar, unless I was using them for strawberry shortcake (and I think I will!) Will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is much better than the one I had been using. It is much lighter and I like the slight sweetness. I didnt have any milk or shortening so I used water and butter instead. Delicious and buttery. Next time I will use milk but keep the butter.

I am not a good biscuit baker!  However, these turned out light, tasty, and slightly crummy.  They didn't get golden brown on top, (they were sort of dark-orangish speckled), however, they tasted great and were nothing like hockey pucks--which my biscuits usually are.  I followed the recipe exactly, using butter for the shortening.  Thanks for a "can-do" biscuit recipe!

Oh my word, these were amazing, simple, easy, and fast! My whole family loved them! I didn't roll them out and just kinda flatted balls of it onto a cookie sheet. They came out great. A little sweet, but perfect with mashed potatoes. :)

These are Delicious! When I finished with the mix, it seemed too moist to roll out, so I threw a couple in the oven to test it. they were great! Even so, I few more Tbsps of flour in and patted them flattened and shaped each one. Delicious either way! I'll make theses again and again!

I never made biscuits with an egg in them. These are good but I could not tell them apart from the biscuits I have been making for years.

These were the best biscuits that I have ever made and I have made quite a few.  They were light and airy.  Very easy to make.  I did follow some other reviewers suggestions and left out the sugar (I don't care for sweet things).  I also used half butter and half lard for the shortening to give the biscuits more flavor.  I usually won't eat more than half a biscuit because they fill me up.  Tonight I left my soup just so that I could eat a whole biscuit.  Yummy

We love these at my house! Instead of rolling them, we drop them by the spoonful (I know, I'm a bad southerner. . .) They come out REALLY light that way and then I don't have to roll them. You can whip up a batch in five minutes!

These biscuits are so awesome!!  I read the reviews and used butter with one batch and shorting with the other.  Both turned out Wonderful.  They are light, fluffy and disappear fast.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE.

Note:  with one batch I added shredded cheese and green onions.  I did this in the final stage by patting out the dough on a floured surface, adding the cheese and onions and folding in half before cutting with biscuit cutter.  They were Fantastic!

Biscuits were very light and fluffy inside, and a nice flavor too. They didn't rise much and the dough was way too wet for rolling out too so I had to add a bit more flour. They tended to crumble upon splitting though. Overall a good biscuit if you can overlook the negatives.

These were very good and I was pleased with the result. Although, I was a little disappointed because they did not rise as much as  I had hoped.

Amazingly enough, even with my mistakes, they still tasted great.  My mistake was that I didn't watch how much liquid I was adding and it got gooey.  So, I had to add a little flour but it was still gooey.  I was afraid of them tasting like flour so I changed them to drop biscuits.  Next time, I do plan to make some changes.  I'm going to cut the sugar by 1/2 and reduce the oven temperature to 375.  Not sure if my oven is too hot but the bottoms were dark and the tops were barely tinted.  I'm guessing the "gooey" problem impacted this too.  But, as I said, the flavor was great and company loved it.

these were really good.  The dough was really soft and I couldn't roll it, (probably my mistake), so I spooned it onto my pan and the biscuits were soooo soft and flaky...so light...the best I have ever made!  I greased my pan with butter before adding the dough.

Delicious.  I followed other reviewer's suggestions and only added 1 tbsp. sugar, and patted the dough instead of rolling it.  I only got 8 biscuits.  This would be a wonderful biscuit to use in a strawberry shortcake.

My family loved the biscuits with sausage gravy. We were even able to make them dairy free. My son has dietary restrictions so we were really happy to be able to make this for him using almond milk instead of regular cows milk. Now he won't be missing out when every one gets biscuits and gravy.

Will definitely make again. I doubled the recipe and only used half the sugar since this was for biscuits and gravy and breakfast biscuits, so didn't want them too sweet. I folded the dough once I laid them out on the floured surface and cut them a little thicker. I was so pleased at how they looked coming out of the oven and they were very light.

I finally found a biscuit recipe that's as good as my Mothers biscuits! I toss them on a floured board, press them down and cut, press around the middle of the biscuit to make a little higher. Thank you for this recipe, I love it!!!

Had to test this out as it is so very close to what we normally use from an old 1969 Betty Crocker cookbook,and WOW is this good. Don't matter how it was used, it was great with butter, gravy, honey, ANYTHING... We did make one change due to us being diabetic, we used 2 TBS sweetener in place of sugar. Amazingly good!!!

These biscuits were good. They are not exactly what I was looking for.  I wanted more of a flaky biscuit.  They were good though and I will probably make again.

Wonderfully easy recipe. Usually my family call my biscuits hockey pucks, but this recipe turned out beautifully!!! No more store bought biscuits for us!!! The thicker you cut the biscuits, the flakier they turn out.

Easy, quick and good!  I followed other reviewers and patted out (with my 2 year old) pat, pat pat....they turned out great.  We got around 17 biscuits because we patted a little thinner than 1/2 inch.  Used a 1/2 pint canning jar to cut out.

I was looking for a biscuit recipe that called for less milk than my usual recipe... I am so glad I found this one!!  I had to change out half the shortening for butter and half the milk (because I just didn't have enough) for water and still these were fantastic!  My family is pretty picky about their biscuits and they inhaled these!  Thank you for sharing :)

This is a wonderful biscuit recipe!!  The first time I made these, I was using them as a top to my Chicken and Biscuits and everyone devoured that.  I did accidentally add 1/2 t. of baking soda that time but I just made them again this evening exactly as the recipe states and they are wonderful on their own!  I live in the south and I have been making homeade biscuits for years but this recipe beats all.  The biscuits were flaky and yummy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  I may increase the sugar and add cinnamon one time and use them for a breakfast biscuits to see how that turns out.  I will update for sure.  Thank you Catherine for this excellent recipe!

I added an additional teaspoon of sugar to the recipe and 2 more tablespoons of butter which made the biscuits a little more flaky.  This recipe is awesome!

These are sooo beautiful!  As a true southern cook, I would never dream of using egg and no buttermilk in biscuits.  I have to admit, after making these a few times (omiting most of the sugar), this is probably the best, easiest, most fool proof recipe for biscuits ever! I made these the first time mostly out of curiosity and my family loved them (even better than my trusty buttermilk recipe I always make).  I will continue using this one.  It's definitely a keeper!

This is my new favorite biscuit recipe. I used butter instead of shortening, reduced the sugar to 1 tbsp and patted out the dough to 1 inch instead of rolling as others suggested. The biscuits were perfect!

These were great, exactly what I was looking for. I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I'll probably make some tweaks and use smart balance instead of shortening and add some seasoning for flavor. I'm also thinking about doubling the recipe and cutting them larger!

Excellent recipe!  The only change that I did was 1 Tbl of sugar, skim milk, and subbed the butter for shortening (sorry, heard that shortening is 2 molecules away from plastic, eew) and everything remained the same. Oh, I did brush some skim milk on them between baking...   Fluffy, light and delish. Easy recipe!  I think the only change I would do the next time is maybe not add any sugar.

These biscuits are terrific. I find they make excellent drop biscuits as the moisture is too much for rolling. But my husband loves them this way. I tried reducing the moisture and rolling them out but he prefers the original recipe! Yum!

This is the first time I've made biscuits from scratch - these were very tasty and easy to make. I took the advice of others and cut the sugar down to 1 tbsp. I dropped them instead of rolling the bough out and also brushed melted butter on top before I baked them. They were fantastic, almost like a scone, and worked perfectly with sausage gravy and with blackberry jam later in the day. :) Thanks for the recipe!

After adding extra flour, they patted out onto the counter very nicely.  We used them for bicuits and gravy and we enjoyed them better than store-bought by far.  They were very simple to make after adding the extra flour, and didn't take very long.  I won't be buying biscuits anymore.

Very tasty! Not as fluffy or flaky as I would have liked, though.  I took another reviewer's advice and used half shortening and half butter. I will make these again, but will next time I will use about 25% less butter and shortening and will roll dough to 1.5 inches for loftier biscuits.

Very, very delicate. Skip the sugar, the sweetness is a little sickening. Overall, very kfc-esque, if you like that sort of thing...bake 'em.

Most excellent!  I also skipped the rolling out part and just prepared them as drop biscuits.  They were so tender and moist, they were yummy even plain.  Served them with chili one night, then used the leftovers (had doubled the recipe) for biscuits and gravy.  Then I made another batch to go with some soup!  It's my new biscuit recipe for sure!

Great on there own,  I roll with lots of flour as it is very very sticky. I also made a batch with garlic and cheese mixed in.  Those went over great with everyone.

I used this recipe to make the cheddar drop biscuits in lieu of using biscuit baking mix and they were perfect. When I have more time I may roll them out and cut them as the recipe states.

Love these! My husband rolls and cuts them -I just drop them. They are great both ways. I cut out the sugar and use non dairy butter in place of shortening.

This one is a keeper!  I usually make this biscuits and my hubby makes the gravy.  This is the best biscuit recipe I have tried yet.  It yielded some tender and tasty biscuits!  I only used 1 tbsp of sugar instead of 2 and they were great.  I will make these again and again.

Not my go to biscuit.  Just made these and didn't care for at all.  First the sugar gives them an off taste especially for a breakfast biscuit when you are looking for a vessel for ham, or milk gravy.  In fact if not for the salt in my milk gravy I would not have ate.  The texture was crumbley with is does not mean flakey.  I will keep on looking for a biscuit recipe.

These were awesome! I have been making baking powder biscuits a lot and can never get them to turn out right but this recipe was great, light, flaky and moist.  I used buttermilk in place of regular.  The dough was really moist so I had to add a bit more flour when turning them so they would roll out.

I LOVE this recipe. I never follow recipes exactly, because I have to make them gluten-free and dairy-free. So, I changed the flour and used soy milk. This recipe is the one I have been searching high and low for. I have made at least 30 batches of gluten-free biscuits, at least, trying to find a combo that actually tasted like a biscuit. All the others were called "biscuits", but they were just missing something. This was perfect!!! If my gluten-free biscuits came out this terrific, I can only imagine the luck you can have with this recipe! I will make these over and over!

very good and very easy. I took the advice of others and just patted them out (after turning the dough over a couple of times) instead of rolling. Super!

These are perfect. I was afraid they might need a bit more salt so I used a "hefty" half tsp of salt. I floured my board and patted out the dough after kneading a bit. I had several left over and found that they were just as good the next day"zapped" in the microwave. They sure paired well with beef stew on a snowy afternoon. Thanks, Catherine!

Awesome biscuits!  I made them to go with a chicken stew recipe from this site.  Made them as directed.  Like some other reviewers the dough was too sticky to roll, so they were drop biscuits, but that's alright, it worked great.

Love these biscuits.  Reminds me of Mom's.  Made as is and dropped them by the tablespoon.  Light, flaky, a bit crumbly.  Great by themselves, with butter, or drizzle with honey for desert.  I serve them with my soups and stews.  For less calories, I've made them with 1 packet of Splenda, half & half butter, egg substitute and skim milk.  Still great!

Incredibly light, soft and flaky inside. Perfect for slicing and buttering open. 4 stars only because I strayed slightly from the recipe:  I only used a generous pinch of sugar rather than 2 tablespoons and I didn't have shortening on hand so I used margerine. Like other reviews I turned out the dough on a floured counter and patted it out - cutting shapes with a glass like mom did.   We really enjoyed these. I've been looking for a recipe similar to the baking powder biscuits I grew up with. While this wasn't like my mom's .. it was still really really good with our chili and I even have one with me now as an after-meal snack. (can't resist)  They didn't golden on the top but had a cute orange and yellow speckled appearance on the tops. Thanks for sharing this with me.

I made these to go along with my beef stew last night and they tasted GREAT.  I also  had the problem of the dough being to sticky to roll out, sooooo ...drop biscuits they became. I can't attest to how they come out as a rolled biscuit, but they sure make a tender, tasty and flaky drop biscuit :>).

This is an excellent biscuit recipe. I made it just the way the recipe said except I gently patted the batter into shape in my hand instead of rolling it out. They are light and fluffy with a great taste.  I would like to try them with a little whole wheat flour and butter, instead of shortening, next time.  Definitely a keeper.

these are sooo amazing!! they are light and fluffy and soooo yummy!! i made them for breakfast with the cinnamon honey butter recipe also on this site, and it was wonderful! i added all the milk(actually i used soy milk) and egg mixture and the dough was a little too sticky to roll or anything. so i just dropped them by the spoonful onto the cookies sheet. i made 7 gaint biscuits. they didn't look as pretty as they would have if you roll them out, but they still tasted amazing!! i highly recomend these! thanks for the awesome recipe!!

Pretty good, very tender. A couple of things...the dough was more like a batter so I had to add about 1/3 cup more flour AND 2 tbsp made them too sweet for my taste!

Excellent, exactly what I was looking for, simple to make and taste great. I brushed egg white over the top to give them a golden brown appearance.

Delicious!  I made these with my 6 and 7 year old girls and they were so easy.  I used Smart Balance instead of shortening and 2 tbs of sugar and thought it was just right.

I enjoy this recipe! I use a cookie sheet with a lip on it to roll out the dough evenly with a rolling pin. and use a glass to evenly cut out the bisquits. On last Thanksgiving my wife made some scratch bisquits, and I made these at the same time.... All of mine were gone!

Mine flopped---came out totally flat---I changed the servings to 4 and couldn't just add 3/8 egg--so I added a whole egg and that was probably the problem.
