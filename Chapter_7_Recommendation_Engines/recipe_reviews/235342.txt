Dear Lord have mercy on my soul… these are AMAZING. I made the fatal mistake of trying a spoonful of batter before baking, just because this recipe made a little extra. And I may or may not have had a few spoonfuls more before self control kicked in. The muffins came out even more amazing when baked! I used M&M's instead of chocolate chips, but made no other changes. These muffins are supposed to be for tomorrow's breakfast…. they might not make it. ;)

These are AMAZING! It makes a lot but in my family, it's not that much! These were fun to make but I actually didn't use the oats and I added more chocolate chips. They turned out great, 5 stars!

These were fun.  The batter smelled like no bake cookies.  My kids gobbled em up.  My only sub was almond milk for milk due to lactose intolerance.  I did need to bake them a few minutes more.  Will make again. Oh, and I got 21 good sized muffins out of this recipe.

Perfect! My husband and kids loved them. We started gobbling them down fresh out of the oven. They had gooey chocolate in them. Yummy! My kids didn't even complain (or notice) the oats! Thank you for a wonderful recipe for those who can't have eggs or when you are just out of them

This recipe is great! The only thing I was disappointed in was that you couldn’t taste the peanut butter. I’m 12 years old and these muffins were fairly easy to make, I would recommend this for large family’s it made just over 24 muffins! I would highly recommend this recipe!

Amazing muffins. Just be sure to make a half recipe if you only want 12 muffins.  I made a whole recipe and got 24.

Good muffins. The recipe came together quickly.  It produces a dense, moist, and fudgy muffin.

These were really easy to make but they are definitely lacking something. My guess is salt. If I make them again, I will be adding salt because they tasted pretty bland, especially fresh out of the oven. They had a bit more flavor once they cooled but I won't be making them again without changing something.

Oh my goodness! The family loved these muffins. And, they are so easy. My full batch was gone in 3 days. Added peanut butter chips as well as chocolate chips.

These were very good, although a little crumbly.  I wish I had halved the recipe, though.  I assumed it would make 12 muffins, but it actually  made 24!

I LOVE this recipe. I never use the oats. I find them a bit....bland. I also save on calories by leaving out the chocolate chips.  Nuts, coconut flake, chopped dates all work well, and every time it bakes up like cupcakes but faster, moist and fudgey. With white whole wheat and coconut sugar it's more....dark chocolate, less peanut butter cup, but just as good. Best batch got hand made almond butter (with skins still on) and chopped hazelnuts. Since I'm mostly cooking for one, I only make a half batch at a time to make it harder to pig out.

Overall this wasn't a bad recipe. I added a tbs of vanilla and one banana. The muffins tasted a little fudge-like but was a little on the dry side. Since oatmeal like rice soaks up moisture; I've come to the conclusion that's why they were dry. I would suggest three things:
1. Eliminate or cut in half the amount of oatmeal used.
2. Fold in sour cream in batter once mixed to create extra moisture.
3.  Reduce cooking time Cook 10 minutes instead of 13. 
I would definitely have a glass of milk handy to wash it down (trust me on that) I was going to take these on my trip but I think I'll freeze these and have as breakfast when I get back.

Made a half recipe and got 12 regular size muffins that were filled more than 2/3 full. I probably could have stretched it and gotten 14 or 15 muffins. Muffins baked up nicely. Cooked them without liners in a silicon pan. Muffins needed 3-4 extra minutes to cook through. Good chocolate and peanut butter flavor. Less sweet than I expected. Dense and rich. Would be good for people who prefer bitter/dark chocolate. My husband said, "These are making me thirsty." Overall, not a bad muffin since I was out of eggs to make one of my normal recipes. Recipe may need some salt to help make the flavors pop and not seem so flat...3.5 stars
