This was a great starter recipe. I had left-over croissants, but no cherry pie filling, so I made the following changes.  Omitted the cherries, almonds and chocolate and added apple pie filling and cinnamon. I doubled the custard, adding a loose cup of brown sugar and about a tsp of cinnamon. I used enough croissants to fit in a 9 x 13 pan - I think it was six very large croissants.  I assembled as instructed: soaking the bottom croissants topping with apple pie filling and adding the top croissants - also soaked. Poured the custard over the top, and pressed down to distribute custard evenly. Boy was this ever good!

What a great dessert! So easy & quick!!  I substituted shaved chocolate for the chocolate chips and used half the can of cherry pie filling for each layer. It reminds me of a cross between cherry pie and bread pudding, very unique. This is a keeper!

Not overly sweet, I preferred mine cold with whipped cream.

Yum! I doubled the amount of cherry pie filling in the layers to use up the can. I also baked it in a 9x13 pan. I'm not sure how this would all fit in a deep dish pie plate. DO NOT pour the extra egg batter on at the end. Pour it on before you top with the final layer of cherries and chocolate. It will turn purple if you leave it on top of the cherries and is a bit off putting. I had to add another can of cherry pie filling to cover up the ickyness.

I made this for a company dinner and everyone loved it.  It was both pretty and delicious.  Definitely use an 8" square baking dish, or larger.  It would never have fit into a pie dish.  Be sure to add any left over milk-egg mix before putting on the top layer of cherries, chocolate, and nuts.  The only thing I'd change in the future would be to only use 1/2 c. sliced almonds, and just put them on the top.  I'll make this quick and easy dish again.
