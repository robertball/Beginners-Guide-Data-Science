I used romas and didn't add any salt as my husband is on a very low sodium diet. This was great! Even my 2 kids who only eat tomatoes in ketchup and pizza sauce ate this and loved it...my kindergartener even had seconds! This is a very nice quick way to use up our abundance of fresh garden tomatoes.

this is delicious! it is as the other readers said very wet but who can complain about summer-tomato juicy-ness with sharp cheddar (yes use sharp!). we used the home-made mayo recipe here and it was a true taste of summer. i suspect this would also "beef up" the taste of less-than-delicious tomatoes which unfortunately is sometimes how they come from the grocery...

The flavor of this dish was very good but I can only give the recipe a 3 star because when I pulled the pan out of the oven it was half full of watery liquid. It made for a very unappealing presentation. I wonder why no one else had this problem. I followed the recipe exactly. Maybe that result is to be expected but it ruined the recipe for me.

This was very good with my garden fresh tomatoes! My sons 19 and 7 Loved it. Yes it is juicy but add croutons or bread crumbs in the cheese if you prefer. The wateriness may depend on your tomatoes too!I did add a pesto/garlic seasoning sprinkled between the layers of tomatoes. I will make this again.

This was simple delicious and fresh. I added mozzarella instead of cheddar and some fresh spinach. We loved it and will make it every time we have a plethora of tomatoes.

I had picked up a large container of tomatoes at a farmers market and saw this recipe. My husband isn't crazy about tomatoes so he wasn't sure till he tasted it - perfecto - he loved it and so did the kids - the entire baking dish was gone in minutes. I used sliced Sharp Cheddar and followed the recipe.

Excellent recipe! After slicing tomatoes I placed them on paper towels to drain a bit before assembling the casserole. I therefore avoided the watery appearance when taking it out of the oven. I also added a light topping of breadcrumbs for a slight crunch!

Meh... This tasted to me like spaghetti sauce when I cooked it however the leftovers the next day tasted better. I think it needs time to "congeal". Also think it would be better with Roma tomatoes since they are a bit meatier. Had to turn up the heat and cook longer but I doubled the recipe. Looked pretty in the pan though!

I thought this was great and hit the spot. It was very liquid but that's ok. Serve with a slotted spoon.

I did not like this. It was too juicy and just didn't have falvoe. I did think that maybe if you add some pepperoni it might make it better. However I made it as the recipe stated and most of it went to waste.

This was pretty good as written but with a few tweaks it could be great.  Next time a little more seasoning and we would use mozzarella.  It was pretty watery but I am sure that depends on the type of tomatoes used.

This is a wonderful recipe because it is easy and helps to use up my over-exuberant purchasing of farmer's market tomatoes! I didn't have enough cheese so I mixed it with some Italian breadcrumbs and omitted the salt. The mayonnaise was a pleasant surprise and added a nice flavoring to the finished product. This one is a keeper!

This was a hit at our house. This is an easy recipe to make with the kids. The sauce created by this dish is fantastic. My kids saw tomatoes and cheese and immediately put it over some pasta.

Ran out of mozzarella so used Chihuahua it turned out great. I like the idea of the crushed crackers on top. I may use that ingredient on one of my zucchini recipes.

I took the suggestion of soaking up the extra juice from the tomatoes when I sliced them.  I added Italian seasoning and a layer of Provolone cheese slices topped with mild cheddar shreds.  Turned out wonderful:)

Simple yet delicious! I happened to have a large garden tomato that I just picked this morning's After I cooked the casserole, I garnished it with some fresh chives, fresh basil and some crumbled bacon. I served it over some toasted white bread and the sauce made it feel like a gourmet BLT sandwich. Really refreshing easy summer recipe!
