This was much harder to make than I anticipated. Never made a roux before...stirred and stirred but after 30 mins the color never turned chocolate. Had to keep the caramel color. I used chicken breasts and canned ckn broth. I also didn't have a HUGE pot for all the ingredients. I don't think I'll make this again, although it turn out ok.
