I am Japanese and have made Omurice many times but using a processed cheese was new for me but it was good! Omurice is Japanese not Omo-rice as Korean. You may know Omo-rice for Korean maybe similar to Omurice but this is definitely Japanese Omurice that my mom used to make when I was a kid and living in Japan (I was born and rainsed in Japan).

This was a great way to use up some leftover brown rice I have from some takeout I had from the night before. I modified the recipe by using some lamb bacon and adding a small onion to the ingredients.

I cut up the bacon into cubes and diced the onion. I cooked them together in the pan till the onion was translucent, then I added the rest of the rice ingredients. It added an extra 10 minutes to the cooking time.

Added onion, skipped the cheese.  Katsu instead of ketchup.  Will fill omelet and add cheese with leftovers.

This is a great! Omu-raisu is one of my favorite dishes from Japan. The processed cheese sort of threw me off at first, but now I see a little cheddar would only add more flavor to the yummy "omelet taste". I like to use chicken most of the time instead of ham, but ham is great, too!
One thing I was surprised about though was that it doesn't call for all the yummy vegetables.  I like frying up some chopped onion, peppers, julienned carrots, and chopped tomato before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I think that really adds flavor and interest to the dish.  
My husband prefers an over-easy egg on his, and my kids like to eat theirs with toast and a strip of bacon. ;) Yum!  Overall, by it's self, this is a great recipe though and can be made for breakfast or dinner!

Used Soyrizo to make it vegetarian.  Have made it about 10 times so far, so it must be pretty good!

Great dish! I saw it somewhere and I decided to try it on a whim.  And I am glad I did. I ended up sharing half of it with my 15 year old daughter.  I used slices of Forrest Ham cut in small pieces and a slice of precessed cheese.  I’ll definitely will make it again! Maybe with some veggies...

DELICIOUS! 

No ham or processed cheese on hand, but very good nonetheless.

I substituted an extra sharp white cheddar for the processed cheese and luckily, upon cooking, the cheese mellowed out quite a bit giving the rice a nice consistency and a great taste in combination with the ketchup!

I've so far made this one twice.  Both times I was short on ham.  The first attempt I used pre-crisped broken up bacon, it was a hit.  The second time I used sausage which again worked very well.  I've also used shredded Colby and Monterrey jack to good effect.  I will defiantly  make this one again.

I really loved this recipe! My fiancée (who's more of a meat & potatoes man) wasn't impressed: he thought it was very bland and could use more eggs.

A good starting point for making Omurice. Lots of room to experiment  and make this to your liking. 

I used left over strips of beef from making stir fry the other night, cubed them up w/ a little garlic and spring onion.

I nixed the parsley and used cubed hotdogs instead of ham out of necessity, but the family loved it!! It's much better if you serve the rice folded into the omelets, though, as it is traditionally.
