Perfect! They stayed soft and plump! So much better than the recipe on the back of the Reece peanut butter chip bag. I made small cookies, and cooked them for 12 minutes. I also added some chocolate chips as I have a bad habit of skimming off the top of the peanut butter ones!

instead of peanut butter chips, I added 1/2cup chunky peanut butter and 3/4 cup of chocolate chips.

i didn't have shortening, so instead used another 1/4 cup of butter. 

bake at 350 for 11 minutes. 

perfect.

The shortening is a mistake. I made them once without (substituting butter) and once with. With it, the texture is weird and there is less flavour. Another mistake (was it a typo??) - the 20-minute bake time. The usual 10-11 minutes is what is actually required.

This was my first time trying cookies with peanut butter chips. And I loved it!
I only had 1/2 cup of white sugar so I filled the other half with pure cane granulated sugar. I also added about a cup of semisweet chocolate chips. They turned out wonderful!
Thanks for the recipe, will make again for sure.

Very nice recipe.  I've tried 2 chocolate cookie recipes previously and while neither was bad neither was worth remaking.  This recipe is a keeper.  I grabbed butterscotch chips rather than peanut butter chips by mistake and subbed 1/4 cup flour with 1/4 cup oats(to add a little texture), otherwise followed the recipe.  It's a bit sweet so I added almost 1/4 cup flour to the remaining 1/3rd of the batch which improved it.  The butterscotch chips are far too sweet and attributed much to the over-sweetness.  These are wonderfully tender cookies with a wonderful flavor.  Good stuff, deserves 4.5 stars or a 9 out of 10 rating by me.  Very nice cookie.  

Almost forgot for added interest I sprinkled just a touch of salt on top of some of the cookies (less than 1/8th tsp for approx 24 2.5" cookies).  It was a nice surprise ... salty and sweet chocolate.  Hey, they're not health food!

You can't go wrong w/chocolate and peanut butter, right?  I halved the recipe as I only had 1/2 bag of PB chips to use and that yielded 34 smallish cookies.  Fresh out of the oven and slightly cooled, these taste great.  The true test will come when I try a room temp cookie, though (I'll return to edit, if necessary).  The bake time is a little off, for me.  I found my cookies (and they were smallish) needed 10-11 minutes to be set.  Thanks for the recipe!

THIS! Will be my go-to recipe, best one I’ve ever made! A previous comment is spot on, this recipe is far better than the recipe on Reese’s pb chip bag! Much less sugar. I was running low on regular sugar so did 3/4 cup of each...omg. They are delish! Thank you!

These turned out really good!  The peanut butter chips I used were super sweet so I opted to add half peanut butter chips and half 60% cocoa chocolate chips.  My husband said he'd be very happy if I made them again.
