The first time I made these, I used butter flavored shortening. The dough was REALLY dry. I had a hard time getting the dough into a ball to be able to roll it out, then it fell apart as I was cutting it. I did take another reviewer's suggestion and baked them at 425* for 15 minutes. VERY dry. They smelled close to Fair Scones but wasn't close enough in taste. I turned right around and made a second batch, this time with butter and I added a touch more milk. The second time it formed into a ball PERFECTLY and cut without falling apart. I did bake them at 425* the second time also for almost 15 minutes. For a family who is originally from Seattle and is pining away for Fair Scones, this is blessing for us. I didn't have raspberry jam (Fair Scones are cut in half and have a dollop of raspberry jam in the middle of the two halves), I did use my homemade strawberry freezer jam. Not exactly the same but close enough. The smell alone was worth the price of admission.......which is really the whole appeal of the Puyallup Fair. Most locals will agree with me. This recipe's a keeper.

You are all missing the point. If you have tried Fisher Scones, at the Washington State Fair, this recipe is very close to their's. No tweeking needed. Butter and raspberry jam is all they need. Make sure to sift the flour before measuring.

I love scones like this----just a good flaky vessel for my butter and jam!  I did use shortening this time, but next time I'll either use butter flavored shortening or just butter or half butter and half shortening.  I didn't bake them the whole time because I thought my parchment paper would catch on fire!  I do believe that I will cut the temperature down to 425 degrees next time.  I made only half a batch, and the next time I'll cut them into smaller pieces (personal preference).  I guess you keep hearing "the next time," and that's because there will be a next time.  I'd like to see how they are served at the Fair!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these a 2nd time & they were much better.  I added 1 tsp bak. soda 1 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp vanilla extract & 2 eggs.  It gave them more richness & made them fluffy with a hint of cinnamon & vanilla sweetness like our fair's scones have. .

I followed Sarah Jo's suggestions and used butter instead of shortening, added more milk (3 Tbsp), lowered the temp to 425 and they were ready in 15 minutes!  Served warm with butter and strawberry jam...yummy!

Usually I make a recipe then adjust it to our taste the second time.  Reading these reviews I liked the advise I saw from other bakers.  I copied a lot of their suggestions.  425 - 14 minutes.  Used Self rising flour and adjusted the base recipe to this.  Used half shortening & half butter.   Added 1 tsp vanilla & cinnamon.  Delicious!!!

I decided it needed to be on steroids and put cinnamon in the flour mixture, then after it was a dough I put  in some raspberries (organic from a local farm of course), and when it came out of the oven I brushed on a glaze of milk, powdered sugar, vanilla and butter

use a kitchen aid with a paddle goes faster but on low. or fork is good. i used 1 cup of milk . it was   wet enough then to stay together i didn't have to  knead it but a couple times is at all,  on floured table and did as written for cutting once baked  they  had no crumbling stayed together well ."like firm" perfect for a biscuit.it was  the same flavor and texture was the same as a biscuit .
not sweet at all.as my boyfriend thought they should be.
       changes i  made this time because we scarfed those up. 
now this recipe change below makes a less heavy scone higher, little sweeter still stays together , a little  crumble  and a lot more moister . great with butter and jam but still taste like a biscuit.just dont have to put as much jam on ,because of the more sugar added.
1 cup milk as b-4.  ( u can use less as it is wet.)but
(makes less tough. over kneading biscuits  makes  them tough too.)
1/4 + 3T. sugar 
3T. baking powder
ps  or fyi 
for the shorting 6T= 1/4 cup plus 1 T.

These were a huge hit at Easter brunch! I took previous reviewers advice to lower the temp. to 425 and use butter instead of shortening. I'll never use another scone recipe again.

I knew right after I added only 1/2 c milk that it wasn’t going to be enough. So I quickly looked up some recipes and I actually needed one WHOLE cup. This recipe also says to bake 15 minutes, where the other one said 10-12. I can’t imagine how inedible they’d  have been if I’d stuck with this recipe.

So, after reading the reviews I made these scones. I sifted the flower, I used butter flavor shortening, cold heavy cream instead of milk, and no flavoring 425° Fahrenheit at 15 minutes.
 
 they were delicious but they didn't rise at all. from the pictures I was expecting something fluffy. maybe I needed the dough too long don't know.
 
 next time I think I'll use butter and make sure it is really cold. perhaps more baking powder too. very delicious.

Delicious! I used puréed ginger, the juice and zest of one orange, and cream for the liquid. I mixed them together to create the 1/2 cup, then mixed in additional cream to get the desired dough consistency. I also added cinnamon. I made them into a heart using a cookie cutter (made 20) and topped them with a simple vanilla buttercream. This will be my go to recipe.

Absolutely delectable, added 1 cup of cranberries to give it something extra. I also added a glaze to the top. Although I think it could use a bit longer in the oven.
