Funny, I am the submitter of this recipe, and I don't recall putting Morton's curing salt on the list of ingredients!  LOL!  Guess they're a sponsor here.  You can use any meat tenderizer, like Adolph's.  I've also used red wine in the place of the sherry, just add a tiny bit of sugar to the ingredients.

This was a great way to cook venison - I omitted the curing salt as I did not have any and didn't think it would need it.

This was tasty, but the meat was not as tender as I would have liked. I couldn't find curing salt. I used regular table salt and I don't know if this had any affect on the tenderness of the meat. I like more gravy so I used a 14oz can of beef broth(minus what I used for the marinade). In step four after I put the remainder of the marinade into the pan I added the beef broth. I used Wondra gravy flour and thicken to taste.  I served this over buttered noodles. Overall, a very good recipe that I will use again.

wow, made this double and can not believe how tender the steak came out.  followed the recipe exactly, except added a clove of garlic and accidentally put in a mildly hot pepper that got mixed in with the bells that we planted last year and froze. the spice was perfect. The marinade made the steak so tender could cut it with a spoon.  spooned the steak and sauce over some boiled potatoes and carrots and ummmmm.

I found out at the last minute that I didn't have dry sherry, curing salt or steak seasoning, but I proceeded with the recipe. I had about 2 lbs of venison steaks to contend with and it turned out really well. Unfortunately there were a few tough pieces, but that wasn't the recipes fault. It was very good, and I would make this again. Family really liked it.

We eat alot of venison and I marinate the meat in milk overnight. It helps to take the gamey taste out and it tenderizes at the same time!! This recipe sounds wonderful and I will be making it soon!!

My whole family thought this was very good.  I used about 2 lbs. of venison tenderloin, cabernet instead of sherry and I added sliced fresh mushrooms with the other vegetables. I wanted more gravy so I used a total of 32oz. of beef broth which I thickened with cornstarch.  The meat was fork tender and delicious.   I served this over buttered egg noodles with fresh baked bread to sop up the gravy.  Will definately make this a lot.

This is an awesome recipe for venison. I've cooked it several times now and my husband loves it. The only thing I would change is making more sauce and cutting back on the salt. The soy sauce makes up for the sodium.

This was absolutely delicious.  I did add more wine and beef broth to the skillet when making the gravy.  Will definitely make again.

Very very good!  I didnt' give it 5 stars because I didn't think it made enough gravy.  I used a small can of beef broth to make the gravy (with the marinade) at the end and it still wasn't a lot.  Meat was very good though, I just used regular meat tenderizer not "Morton Tender Quick" and it was fine.

Very good. I am told I will be making this again. :) I skipped the sherry as I had none on hand. I also skipped the curing and steak seasoning as I do not like my dishes over salted. I prefer for everyone to salt to taste. I added more broth and soy sauce to substitute for the sherry. The venison was very tender and I think could have been passed off for beef.

Excellent. Did not have meat tenderizer so used seasoned salt and a bit of sugar.   Omitted extra salt.  Kids all loved it.

This was an amazing recipe. Cleaning out some venison steaks which had slid to the back of the freezer, I used this marinade to soak the steaks for about six hours before cooking. The brine needed to be augmented in order to have enough for gravy but the whole thing went perfectly well over rice and served with a cupcake vineyards shiraz wine. I can see that this marinade will work equally well with chicken and beef.

Fabulous!  I took the advice of other reviewers and made extra gravy by adding a can of beef broth, extra cabernet (didn't use sherry as I did not have any on hand) and soy sauce.  It was a hit and will be our new 'go to' venison recipe, especially for entertaining friends who claim to not be fond of venison.

Excellent, boys and hubby loved it.  Healthier than frying it.  Soaked my venison in water the night before changing the water 2-3 times.  Used  3t of soy sauce , used white cooking wine because I didn't have sherry,  seasoned my meat with Tex Joy,  2 shakes of garlic powder, couple of grinds of pepper corn, and 1.5T of brown sugar.  Used 1/4 cup of broth because the marinade smelled like wine (yuck).  Did everything else like the recipe.  The meat was so tender, it melted in our mouths.  WILL DEFINITELY make this AGAIN!

This was really good, I didn't use the curing mixture, I used a dry white wine instead of sherry, and used a little flour for thickening instead of corn starch. The meat was really tender, I served it over pasta. My picky 2.5 year old ate it all and had seconds.
