Very good and not at all as heavy as most pumpernickel breads are, especially when baked in a bread machine.

I did not care for this. I love pumpernickel bread and this was dry and kind of tasteless.

This was an excellent bread. The only thing that I had happen, was that the top fell in. But I will try it again and make some adjustments. It was that good.

I loved the rich flavor and great texture of this bread! I changed the recipe to be like my boyfriend's favorite bread at a fancy chain supermarket's bakery. I prepared the dough on the dough cycle of my bread machine (needed a little extra flour). At the end of the cylce I added about a cup of raisins and started the machine again to mix until the raisins were distributed. I then let the dough rise for one hour in a ball on a lightly greased 10 inch cast-iron frying pan. I baked the bread on the frying pan for 33 minutes at 375. It made a delicious bolle. Thanks for a keeper!

Very good bread, I used less molasses thou and add caraway seeds (1 Tbs) and 1 tsp of instant coffee powder, the coffee gives a very good flavor and goes very well with the chocolate.

Everyone loved this, I followed the recipe except didn't have any rye flour so I used whole wheat. I think I will add honey or sugar next time as it looked sweeter than it tasted.

I followed the instructions exactly but found the bread slightly bitter with an unpleasant after-taste.  I'll try it again, reducing the amount of cocoa (perhaps 1 tbsp cocoa and 2 tbsp sugar) but for the moment I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

Nice flavor and texture bread.  Plus with the bread machine doing all the work, it was quite easy.  I made this bread with beef stew and it went well.  The deep flavor might overwhelm a simpler soup like homestyle chicken.  I look forward to using this recipe during the fall and winter months to accompany robust stews and soups.

Didn't think this was anything like a true pumpernickel.  There was too much cocoa and it had a bad aftertaste.  Sorry.

Looking for a bread recipe that used rye flour is how I came across this recipe.  Plus it had all the things I was looking for.  It used rye flour; it hadn’t been reviewed since 2009 and it was a ‘faceless’ recipe.  A plus was that it was to be made in the bread machine.  I knew that my bread machine could not handle baking a loaf that had 3 ½ cups of flour in it (I learned the hard way on another recipe), but it could handle mixing it up for me.  I added all the ingredients and hit start.  When it was time to bake, I just removed the dough and put it in a well greased loaf pan.  I let it rise in a warm spot for 1 hour and then proceeded to bake at 350° for about 40 minutes.  The bread is delicious and cut beautifully with the help from my electric knife.  I served this with ‘Best Wild Rice Soup Ever’ and ‘Strawberry Cream Pie to Die For’ both AR recipes for my parents.  It was my dad’s birthday.
