The first time I made this, I had the same problem as a number of other reviewers....no body was willing to try this because it looked a little odd. The next time I brought it to a party, I mixed it all up together an sprinkled a bit of paprika and fresh parsley on top. NOW people were willing to try it. It was a big hit, and I got lots of requests for the recipe.

Unfortunately this was not well received.  I had a candle party with 9 people and I was the only one who tried this.  If it's any consolation, I liked it.  I guess I don't live in jezebel country.

I'm a southerner living in the north where no one has ever had this. I served it at a party recently and it was a big hit with my unenlightened Yankee friends. I might add a little more horseradish to taste next time, although it was absolutely delicious as the recipe is written.

Instead of black pepper, try using 1/4 teaspoon (or to taste) of red pepper flakes.  It adds more kick and satisfies the need for a more desirable look. Encourage people to try to first bite and then relax...it's gone!

Loved it!!!!  For those of you who enjoy more a little extra kick in the spice department.  I substituted 1 Tablespoon of Chinese Mustard for one of the Tablespoons of Dijon.  Everyone loved it!!!!

Everyone at my party looooooved this recipe. I was concerned about the horseradish thinking alot of people don't like it but I was pleasantly surprised! I bought Peach Preserves by mistake but it was still very good. I am making it again tonight but will use Apricot this time. I have been asked for this recipe by alot of my friends!
Thanks, Lisa

I was intrigued by the odd ingredients in this dip.  It was really very good, but I doubt I will make it again.

Easy, and very tasty served with cream cheese. Also any leftover dip is good served as a dip for chicken nuggets,or chicken fingers.

This is really, really good. I've made it for years with half apricot and half pineapple preserves. Recently, I used a small can of drained crushed pineapple instead of the pineapple preserves and it was really good too. Great with Triscuits - you need something substantial. Also, I always "pre-spread" a few crackers and put them on the serving plate to get folks going. You can tell timid eaters to spread a lot of cream cheese on the  cracker with just a little sauce so it's not to hot for them.

My Mother-in-law gave me this recipe (with half pineapple preserves instead of all apricot) about 30 years ago. I didn't know it was so famous! :)

Delicious, inexpensive and easy as pie. Unlike others here, I didn't really have any problem getting anyone to eat it, perhaps because I live in the South. I've seen this recipe in many forms (some sweet/hot/tangy concoction poured over cream cheese) using various perserves or jalopeno jelly or sweet red pepper and onion relish (like Harry and David's) or even just Pick-a-Peppa sauce. They're all good.

This is a wonderful sauce. While experimenting to see if I wanted to serve this at my New Years Eve Bugget, I mixed it altogether with the cream cheese and spooned it over a baked chicken breast. Yummy. Since lots of reviewers say guests are reluctant to try it, I thought I might cut the cream cheese into 1 inch cubes, place a dollop of Jezebel on each cube and present it on a platter with romaine lettuce leaves or parsley in the center and crackers around the perimeter.Thanks for sharing, Jen!

I've tried many versions of this but this one is DEFINITELY the best!  It always goes.  Guests always have the same puzzled look on their face when you tell them what's in it.  TIP OF THE DAY: Next time you are grilling, spray grill with nonstick spray then brush this glaze (minus the cream cheese, of course) on porkchops, chicken, ham or shrimp!  I've gotten rave reviews on this, too!

For a knock out presentation, which takes more time to explain than do (and can be done ahead of time): 4 lightly buttered phyllo pastry sheets stacked one top of the other, cut in squares (makes 12), each square placed in muffin pan, bake (empty) at 300 until golden brown.  Do this twice for 24 phyllo cups.  When ready to serve add spread in cups, then garnish. Beautiful... all gone

Very good.  I used apricot preserves, but apricot/pineapple preserves work well, too.  People either love it or hate it, but most will love it.  It's a nice change of pace from regular dips and spreads.  It's a snap to prepare, which is great!  I serve it with buttery crackers.

This one always goes down a treat at my Christmas parties. Because it looks rather unattractive if made as listed I actually reverse things by adding everything but the preserves to the cream cheese. I then have a wonderful topping of apricot that looks much more appetizing. I sometimes serve it with the apricot warm and it is liked just as much that way. This recipe was a real find.

I've had many Hot Jezebels over the years. After the meeting was over and everyone left, I tossed my old Jezebel recipe and replaced it with this one. It passed the test of twelve fussy musicians.
Creamy, full flavored and stood on it's own with any of the half dozen kinds of crackers I served. 
The texture is perfect.

I served this at an open house during the holidays and loved it.  It was so simple to make and I served it with crackers and sausage balls. I did need to do a little coaxing to get my guests to try the dip that is why I gave it 4 stars.

This recipe has been a standard in Southern kitchens for ages and has withstood the test of time!  No matter how many times I serve this, folks still seem to enjoy it.  Keeps well in the fridge for several days.  Thanks!

I made this for a party and it was all gone! I also added paprika to give it a better color. This is a good fall recipe because it has a pumpkinny color to it.  Great recipe!

I really liked this sauce very much.  I did add a touch more horseradish and lots of black pepper.  It was hard not to eat every bit of it myself!

I love this dip!  I personally like a bit more horseradish for kick.  Only 4 stars because it looks rather unattractive on the plate.

Delish!! Only I didn't use the mustard because I didn't have it on hand. I can't believe with the previous users that people are not willing to try new things!!

I make this all the time for entertaining -- it is so easy and fast to whip up once you have the ingredients in your fridge.  I usually make with fat-free or neufchatel cream cheese and low-sugar apricot preserves, it is still wonderful.  I serve with water crackers or wheat crackers.  Guests rave about it, and they are always surprised to hear what the ingredients are!

I made this dip last night for my jewelry party.  It was the hit of the party!  Everyone raved about how good it was!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I used 1/2 apricot and 1/2 pineapple preserves, and used crushed red pepper instead of black pepper.  I also blended the cream cheese into all ingredients, to make a "dip" consistancy.

Sounds strange, but, also sounds interesting. So I had to try it out! I now have a new addition to my permanent recipe collection. If you like it HOT, add a little more dijon and horseradish. I served it with Triscuit Thin Crisps. Nice contrast of tastes and textures!

I thought this spread tasted fantastic, in fact I'm not sure if anyone is familiar with the astefully simple products, but this is simialar to the sweet pepper jelly over cream cheese sweet, a little spice, and the saltiness of the cracker is fabulous.  The only bad thing is that it really doesn't look all that appealing! But once you get people to taste it it's yummy.  I love horseradish so I added a little bit more that the recipe called for, and I could of added more. Very easy!

My guests were afraid of this dish (looks like mashed potatoes with sweet and sour sauce on top), so there weren't many takers, but it was DELICIOUS. The presentation left a lot to be desired, but if you're good at that sort of thing, this dish will be very popular.

This is an amazing combination of flavors. I like to sprinkle the top with a few red pepper flakes and some toasted almond slivers. It's best chilled overnight.

This has been a favorite in my family for years! I make it several times a year and its nice to just have on hand. We like it best with Wheat Thin crackers and any leftover dip is DELICIOUS on a burger with swiss cheese. Mmm...

We like this altho my version could have been a little spicier.  I could only find extra hot horseradish, so I cut back a bit, probably too much!

This was exactly the recipe I was looking for!  I took the advice of using the red pepper flakes instead of black pepper for appearance reasons and added much more horseradish for our preference.  I served it as a spread for grilled pork tenderloin.  Wonderful.

I am not a fan of horseradish, but I absolutely love the sweet/spiciness of this! It's very creamy, so you'll need a firm/crisp cracker to go with it.

A local horseradish company used to sell something similar already prepared.  I was thrilled to find this recipe as they don't sell it anymore.

Loved it - and so did everyone at the party I brought it to.  Also, I was traveling about 2.5 hours to the party and this was so easy to transport.  I just kept the apricot mixture and cream cheese chilled with an ice pack and when I arrived at my destination it was a snap to throw together.  Everyone raved about it and asked me for the recipe.   
One thing to note is that I overdid it on the horseradish at first and had to use an additional amount of apricot preserves to balance out the taste.  But that also allowed me to use the leftover mixture the next night for dinner - served over chicken.  Delicious!

Sorry.  Tried this one out for Easter because it sounded so interesting, had numerous great reviews and my family loves hot/spicy dishes.  I convinced everyone to give it a try and they all thought it was just so-so.  It was the only appetizer leftover on the table!  I may try again, but add more horseradish or dijon.

This recipe did scare me a bit, but due to all the positive feedback and the need to try something really different, I made it.  It was great, and big hit.  I asked all of my guests to try it, regardless of what it looked like, and boy did they start gobbling it up!!!  We will be having Hot Jezebel for New Years Eve!

thanks Jen!

made this because I was looking for a recipe similar to a appetizer I had at a cookout, that was made with a well know, more expensive pepper jelly.  This really captures that taste, but it took a little convincing to get my familar to try it, but once they did they scarfed it up!

This was great!  My guests really enjoyed it. From what other reviewers posted, I was worried what it would look like, so I went out and bought an italian looking, apricot colored dessert plate with a pretty design for $3 at Ross.  I made a big dome with the cream cheese and poured on the jezebel.  It looked beautiful!  The mustard I used had little seeds in it, which gave it a little sprinkle of a different color and I used Triscuit triangle crackers.  I'll definetely make it again.

Loved this recipe!  For presentation I pressed the cream cheeze into various sized small prep bowls (lined w/saran wrap) to create half spheres.  I removed when hardened and dripped the topping over the various sized circles.

I absolutely LOVE when I have a recipe that people gobble up, and this is one of those recipes.  People want to know what's in it, and can't believe it when you tell them!  For a nicer presentation I spread the creme cheese on a pretty glass platter, then put the preserve mixture on top.  People can then either spoon some dip on a plate for themselves or just dip the cracker into the dip that is on the platter.  No double dipping though!  :)

I have this recipe using pineapple preserves, black pepper and horseradish.  It is delicious, however, people do tend to shy away from it due to the way it looks.  For people who like spicy dishes it is delicious and easy.

This hot Jezebel wasn't hot enough for me, so we increased all the hot stuff!  And I also used some homemade Apricot Chili Jam I just happened to have in the pantry.  It was yummy, and it disappeared, so then I had to refill the dip plate.

This recipe is certainly an acquired taste.  Both my wife and I tried it and thought it was an average recipe.  Nothing spectacular that would make me want to make it again.  We halved the recipe and still half of what we made went to waste.  The flavor is not for everyone.

Our friends think I'm so cool with this new recipe!  I added a lot extra dijon mustard to give it more of a pleasant hot flavor, and I swirled the apricot preserves throughout the cream cheese to give it a little extra pizzaz.  Delightful!

I brought hot jezebel to an office party.  People were a little slow to try it, but once they did they couldn't stop eating it.  Everyone was amazed at the appetizer and couldn't stop talking about it.

Great! I first tasted this over 25 years ago and have finally found the recipe. I made this for Christmas Eve and it was the hit of the night, especially with the kids in their 30's. They all wanted the recipe. It's like ambrosia. You can't get enough.

Very different, very good. We don't like horseradish so I cut a hot chilli pepper very 
finely and used it instead. No one could guess what it was made from, but it was 
very popular. Super easy.

Really not bad.  I think I would use a good hot horseradish next time, though.  I added a little paprika to up the colour from a dull orange to a much nicer bright colour.  Much more appealing.  Serving it with water crackers and baguette slices.

Good recipe.  For our taste we upped the horseradish and mustard.  My mother has used the apricot/horseradish/mustard mixture on pork roasts before.

This is a great mix of heat and sweet, it's super simple to make, and it's a crowd pleaser. (It's similar to the old favorite of hot pepper jelly on cream cheese, but this is a unique take and more complex in flavor.) I like it if the horseradish is quite hot so that the sweet of the preserves is a nice foil to that hot flavor (otherwise, this recipe would be too much "sweet" for me). Several times I've bought new jars of horseradish for this recipe and the horseradish is quite mild. So now I prefer to grate some fresh horseradish to ensure that I get just the mix of heat and sweet that works for me. If my eyes water a little, I've got the right combination! (And it's quite the conversation piece being that hot -- but it's a "quick heat" that dissipates fast, vs the lingering heat of a jalapeno or other hot pepper.)

I always get compliments whenever I make this (although I have to change the name when bringing it to a church potluck!). I do however add much more horseradish and mustard so that the hot and sweet really balance out to my liking. It's always a good idea to start out with the original recipe and then alter to your liking (as we all know, you can't take anything out once it's in!) Enjoy!!

Made this to take camping at Bristol NASCAR race.  Due to camping mixed everything together as a "dip" instead of layering - Flavors blended - super recipe.  Stored in a shaped bowl with lid, sprayed with PAM for easy removal.  When ready to serve used checkered flag paper plate with lettuce leaves.

I was very skeptical about this recipe and while I didn't care for it very much, it was the HIT of the New Year's Eve party!! I kept hearing people say things like "Oh, WHO made this!?! Its excellent!!". they would also try an guess qhat was in it and most of them were suprised to hear the ingredients! Thank you so much!! (I would recommend you make it far enough in advance to chill the sauce fro at least 2 hours before serving.)

I served this to a group of co-workers at my house and even the most finicky eaters gobbled this up.  I had to double the recipe.  They all begged for the recipe.  This is definitely a keeper.

I brought this to a Thanksgiving dinner and the out of town guests (all from Louisiana) scooped this up in no time.  As a matter of fact, I received a call yesterday asking me for the recipe.  This is a definite keeper.  I love making unusual things to bring, so this was perfect.

I didn't like this one at all.  It was like sweet and sour sauce poured over cream cheese, and I don't think it went well with crackers  It didn't look pretty either.  I gave it 2 stars because my mother-in-law really liked it, but nobody else did.  But I heard this is a southern recipe and we're from MN, so maybe that explains it.

This recipe was a real hit at our Thanksgiving gathering.  Even those who profess not liking horseradish were raving.  I even added twice the amount of horseradish called for in the recipe.....it was super!

I loved this one!  I didn't have any horseradish, but I did have wasabi and added that instead.  WOW!!!  Big hit with all who tried it.  I used neufchatel cheese and molded it in a star shaped pan.  Great recipe, and a keeper for sure!

I took this to work one day and it really went over well.  People were very intrigued by the name, also!  I'm only sorry I don't know the story behind it... Anyway, I wouldn't change a thing.  I'll make it again.

I tried this recipe last Christmas.  While it wasn't a really beautiful presentation (and I can get over that!), the taste was delicious!  I love horseradish and the sweetness from the apricots is a great combination.  A few people were reluctant to try it but when they did they loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

After reading the reviews, I thought I couldn't go wrong bringing this to a party.  However, hardly anyone would try it!  It seemed as if they weren't sure what it was made of and weren't willing to try it.  Those who tried it didn't seem too interested in having seconds.  I have 2 parties next week, but I think I'll try something else for those.

This was absolutely incredible.  Brought this to a barbecue the other night and it was the most popular appetizer on the table!  Very fast and very easy!  I added a little more horseradish and a little more mustard to give it a little more zip.
