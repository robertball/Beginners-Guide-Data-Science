This was such a light tasting stew but yet very filling!  All I had was apple juice and next time I think I would like to try the cider.  I also just used small/thin boneless chicken breasts and threw them in whole and frozen.  About two hours after cooking I took them out and cut them up and then put them back in.  I let the entire stew cook for about 5 and a half hours and it was just perfect.  The chicken was so moist and the flavors were so different.  I also threw in half sweet potatoes instead of all white.  I will make this again for sure!

The only suggestion I have is to use about a cup more of apple cider.  Also reserve 1/4 cup and mix with 1t. cornstarch to thicken up the stew a few minutes before serving.  No problem with the flavor, this was very tasty and hearty.

This is some of the best stew I ever had. 10 minutes of prep, try closer to  25 - lots of veggies to chop and chicken to brown. I started to get nervous during prep when I finished chopping all the vegetables, put them in the pot and only had an inch left for the chicken and apples. I thought I was going to have to sit on the lid to keep it on. It cooks down a little though and comes out really nice. Most of the crock pot recipes here that tell you to cook on "high", you should cook on low otherwise you will overcook your food. This is the only one I have come across that you SHOULD follow the instructions and cook on high. Perfectly spiced. Great recipe!

Very good and simple.  Didn't brown chicken.  Added a couple of boneless breast also, for balance.  Cut pieces pretty big because they shrink.

This was good, but it needs a little work.  There was no way 1 1/4 cups of liquid was enough to make a "stew", so I doubled the apple cider.  I think next time I would be better off adding a can of chicken broth instead, and just leaving the cider the same.  The cider taste was too strong.  It could also use more spices.  So I'll make some modifications and try again because I love the idea!  And as made it really wasn't bad, just like drinking apple cider with chicken and veggies in it!

This was a great recipe! I needed more liquid for the slowcooker so I added a cup of chicken stock along with the apple juice. Instead of cubing the chicken breasts I boiled them with some olive oil and sea salt and shredded it to give it more of a brunswick stew feel. I also added some cubes of squash that I froze from the summer and a handful of dried sweetened cranberries for yet another splash of autumn. It was a huge it in my household and will be made again in the near future. Overall this was quite enjoyable, thank you!

I left out the celery and added in 2 chopped leeks. As I was at work all day I cooked this on low for about 9 hours. Just before serving I added a tsp of cornstarch to the gravy to thicken it up. Hubby really enjoyed this and said the only thing missing was dumplings. I will definitely make this again. Thanks.

Excellent!  I didn't use the caraway seeds and I used an extra apple.  It is super easy and very good.

The kids love it, so it's a keeper.  I used sweet potatoes in chunks instead of white potatoes, and wow, was that good!  I love having this alternative to beef stew.

I must admit that I tried this because of the submitter's comments.  I am from Omaha, NE and my family and I just went to Kimmel Orchard yesterday (bring home both apples and apple cider with us).  I know it's a silly reason to try a recipe, but man am I glad I did!  This is awesome!  I didn't have everything it calls for, so I deviated a little.  I left out the carrots, added some minced garlic and used 1 tsp. garlic salt and 1/2 tsp. table salt.  I also didn't have caraway seeds or bay leaf.  Right before serving, I thickened the sauce with some cornstarch & water.  Served with some crusty bread and a green salad.  Perfect!

Outstanding!  I used what I had...chicken breasts, 1 potato, 2 apples, white onion and extra celery.  I also had no caraway seeds or parsley.  Still with those changes, the stew was delicious!  My house smelled fabulous and even my kids liked it.  I cooked it on low overnight and didn't saute the chicken just put the 4 whole breasts on top of the vegetables.  After a couple of hours I cut them up and put them back.  The Granny Smith apples become a part of the sauce-if you cooked it for less time they might not. This one is a keeper!

Delicious! I changed a couple things in this great dish: Since I didn't have any apple cider/juice on hand, I substituted with orange juice which turned out to be fabulous! I also followed the suggestion of another review by putting in frozen chicken breast (took out after 1hr to cut in pieces, then returned to pot). I also added one yam, since I had it on hand & didn't want to waste it. I added a bit more apples (Pippins) & Thyme & used Mustard powder (had no caraway), & Cayenne instead of Black pepper.  Instead of 4-5 hrs on HI setting, I did 1 hr on HI, then reduced to LOW for another 5 hrs. My family & kids' friends loved it & it was gone in less time than it took to make it!

I will make this again. It is easy enough to bring camping with the crock pot!! The only change I did was omit caraway seeds - none in cupboard. Carol, thank you for sharing.

Thought this recipe was a little bland.  If I make this again, I'd play with the spices more, because my husband and I thought it needed something more savory to balance the sweetness of the apple cider and apple.  The chicken was also a bit dry, so I'd try putting it in frozen or use bone-in chicken pieces.

Tasty & comforting on a cool day. Used 2 sweet potatoes & 2 reg. potatoes. Didn't have dried thyme leaves so used slightly heaping 1/2 tsp. ground thyme. For the liquid: used apple juice & cider vinegar, and also added a can of chicken broth; the end result was a thick stew and the chicken was moist. For apple: cubed 1 small golden delicious & 1 small gala. They seemed to disappear into the sauce during the cooking process - I forgot to place them on top of the chicken & had just mixed in the apple cubes with all the other veggies- but it turned out very tasty anyway! My boneless/skinless chicken breasts (used 5) were frozen. I still attempted to brown them (dredged in flour/salt/pepper) before putting them in the crock pot whole, and after 5 hours on high they shredded like a dream! Followed the recipe exactly for other ingredients. We will have this again! Thanks for sharing!

I made this for a dinner party on a cold night, and everyone loved it!  I made a few changes.  I used marinated turkey tenderloin, yukon gold potatoes, two apples and matchstick carrots because that's what I had on hand.  For seasoning, I used a packet of garlic herb wine marinade and layered as suggested.  When I make this again I will add celery for sure.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used a cup and quarter apple cider, and the same of chicken broth, in the end it was more soup like than stew like, so I added cornstarch to thicken.  Thanks for the recipe!

this is a good recipe. i'm a mother of 3 and my oldest is a picky eater as well as a light eater. this dish he actually asked for seconds. to me its a little bland but it might have something to do with the fact that i didn't have all the seasonings. i just put salt, pepper and ground allspice. thank you for this recipe.

It was good but somehow not good enough to make us really want the leftovers the next day.  I actually did 4x the apple suggested which helped.

This was an easy dish to throw together.  I did find that the apple flavor was a bit overwhelming.  I think it was the tartness of the apple I used (grannysmith).  I think I will try a sweeter apple next time.

Pretty good, a little on the bland side, but I still liked it! Maybe fresh herbs would have made a difference or stronger cider(I just used a cheap-o brand one).

This was very tasty.  I didn't have any potatoes, so I added extra carrots, celery, and onion.  I also put in 2 apples, and omitted the caraway seeds because I didn't have any.  The hubby and I both loved this dish and I will be making in again very soon.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is a lovely recipe.  Gently sweet flavor, tender chicken, very nice complement of spices. Definitely a keeper.

So easy and DEEEEElicious. I didn't brown the chicken because I'm lazy and I added a sweet potato because I had it. It cooked on low for 7.5 hours. The leftovers I'm eating today are amazing too!

This is a delicous meal for those cold days. I substituted sweet potatoes for regular potatoes, and a yellow onion for the red onion. Also, I did not include carrots or celery or the caraway seeds because I didn't have them. I did add frozen green beans for a green vegetable. In addition to apple cider, I added 14 oz of chicken stock as well. I also  used more apples because I had bought to many at the store. I also used more spices and added garlic. When the stew only had 30 minutes left, I added quinoa to it. Delicious. My fiance and I both added additional spices for our liking before eating it.

We really enjoyed this recipe!  I took other suggestions and added a sweet potato, chicken stock, and a handful of dried cranberries.  I thought it was a tad sweet, so next time I will decrease the amount of apple juice and use more chicken stock.  I also did mine with a chicken leg quarter in the crock pot and shredded the chicken.  It was SO flavorful and everyone just loved it!  I will be making this again, and have already been giving out the recipe!

I had never cooked with caraway seeds before.  They added such a nice flavor to this stew.  I wouldn't leave this spice out as it adds such a nice balance of flavors.  You would never know it has apples and apple cider/juice except for the fact that it lends a certain sweetness to the stew.  The only thing I did differently was to shred the chicken when I stirred it at the end of cooking time to make it more like a stew.  I didn't want the chunks of chicken.  I also added a little chicken broth at that time and it made it the perfect consistency.  UPDATE:  Browning the chichen is not necessary.  This time I added WHOLE, mostly frozen chicken breast.  Toward the end of cooking time, it shredded easily and was perfect for a stew

This was good, but my kids asked me what was in it that made it taste so odd. I think they weren't prepared for the mixture of chicken and apple. I liked it, but not so much that I'll make it again. I did make the recipe exactly as shown here.

Delicious! I have three kids and I was looking for a slow cooker recipe for the rest of my frozen chicken breasts. I had everything on hand except the caraway seed. Tasted great- a nice mild tang.

Pretty good, although I wouldn't really call it a stew, as there is almost no liquid left.  More like the ingredients are boiled in apple cider, with little cider left over as the end.  Nevertheless it is pretty tasty, although the chicken is usually pretty dry.

I decided to use this recipe since I had some grouse to use up. This does end up being sweet tasting, but pleasantly so.  I omitted the caraway and substituted onion powder for fresh onion.  I used flour to thicken the gravy and ended up adding some salt to suit our tastes.  It was a good dish and I may make it again.1

I made this with chicken thighs instead (which I think slow-cook better).  And that way I didn't have to pre-cook anything.  Turned out wonderfully!  The apple taste is there but not overpowering, and it gives a nice new taste to chicken stew.

I love this recipe! I've made it for my family many times, using both the slow cooker and the stove. When I shared some with friends, they raved and insisted I give them the recipe. Now they too make it often for their families. This is comfort food at it's best! The one thing I do tend to change from the recipe is I add about twice as much apple cider. We like a lot of sauce...also once I added sweet potato chunks. MMMmm...

I followed this recipe to the letter. It had a weird flavor and the red onion turned everything a purple-ish color. We did not eat the leftovers and it turned out to be a big waste. It was edible, so I gave it three stars.

I didn't have time to use the crock pot, so I added 4 cups of chicken broth and made soup instead for a lunch meeting.  It was a huge hit!  My kids were salivating all morning while I was making it, and very disappointed that I didn't leave some at home for them.  I'll try it as a stew sometime when I'm not rushed, but the recipe works really well as a soup, too.

Excellent recipe -- great blend of flavors!  I didn't have caraway seeds and used fresh thyme (~1/2 tablespoon)instead of dried.  Also, instead of sprinkling half of the salt mixture over the vegetables, I mixed it with some flour and dredged the chicken before browning.  I deglazed the chicken browning pan with ~1/2 C bourbon and added that and a 14 oz. can of chicken broth to the cider.  We ate it with whole grain and seed bread, which complemented the sweetness of the stew nicely.  My husband couldn't stop raving about this recipe!

I'm giving this a a four, because I thought it was just OK, but my husband LOVED it. I didn't use the crockpot; I made it on the stove instead... which might be why I wasn't crazy about it. I thought it was too dry (not stew-y enough).

Wonderful!  I didn't thaw the meat ahead of time, so I cooked the chicken on high in the crockpot for two hours, then I cut the chicken up and put it back in the pot with everything else.  Then I cooked it on low for 10 hours, so I could serve it for an early lunch.  It worked out really well, and I will use this recipe again.  Next time, though, I might use the suggested cornstarch to thicken it a bit.

My whole famly absolutely loved this recipe, it filled up a 5qt crock pot and it was all gone that night with only 3 of us, and I don't eat very much, so it was my husband and 10 year old who ate most of it.  I did change a little, used a cp more apple juice, 2 med apples, didn't have caraway seed or bay leaf, so just sprinkled with italian seasoning, also didn't have any carrots, so I just added frozen mixed vegies to make it more like a stew.  It was excellent, but next time will had the apples in a little later and probably add another one too, and maybe a little bit more apple juice or try apple cider.  Other wise, fantastic!

I just threw everything in the slow cooker, no prebrowning chicken. I also used more apple cider as per other reviewers suggestions. The chicken comes out nice and tender but the vegetable were still not cooked through even after 9 1/2 hrs on low. :( Disappointing.

The seasoning was amazing and it made the whole house smell wonderful! We used a little extra apple, a little less potato, and about twice as much apple juice. For me, the apple chunks in the dish were a little weird, but my wife LOVED it. We will most likely make this one again. Thx!

Had no apple juice so I used Cranapple, and we just weren't thrilled with the results.  The children loved it but the adults felt it had an odd taste.

Good but bland. Only our children under the age of 5 liked it as written, because it has the bland, comforting taste of baby food. My husband and I saved it with garlic powder, creole seasoning and cumin powder.

I have made a recipe very similar to this years ago and had misplaced it. This was very close but not quite the same. Definitely way too much pepper. A quarter teaspoon would have been plenty

Really good. Don't stir too soon or the apple pieces will disintegrate. Didn't really get the purpose of the bay leaf though?!

Nice mix of flavors. The apple pieces thicken the broth. Next time I'll cut back on the pepper a little.

Very good and easy to make.  Followed the recipe as is.  Used cider instead of juice.  Would make again.  The leftovers were delicious the next day!

Its a good concept but I would play with the spices.  The recipe was just a bit bland for me.   Next time I make this,  I will change up the spices listed and find something less bland

This was the first thing I made with my slow cooker.  I chopped up the veggies the day before and my boyfriend cooked the chicken and put everything together.  I really liked this, it was hearty and had a very good flavor.  I wish it had made a little more liquid to pour over everything.

This was just ok.  
Cooked longer on low instead of high.  
Tried to adjust based on reviews regarding the liquid.  Used 8oz chicken stock, 8 oz spiced apple juice.  It was plenty liquidy to qualify as a stew but I felt like I lost all apple flavor.  I taste the spice of the seasonings and onion but not much sweet or tart apple.  Perfectly edible, but disappointing.

Adding a cup of broth really tempered the sweetness of this stew, but made it entirely too liquidy. Next time I would use a cup and a half of liquid, using half broth and half cider. Overall, this was better than I had expected.

I was so excited to try this recipe, especially because of the cider.  It turned out good, except ironically I didn't like the sweet taste in the broth.  
I will probably make it again using chicken broth because everything else about it I liked.

Loved it. I was nervous about adding only apple juice so I added a can of chicken broth also. My younger kids ate mostly broth with crackers in it.

Yummy. Very autumn feeling and tasty. I would have liked a little more sauce so I'll add more juice next time.

This was really just barely ok for me.  Kind of bland.  My apple turned to apple sauce.  The potatoes were bland & tasted like apple sauce, and even though I kept the onion slices thick they just turned out stringy when cooked.  Not a fan, sorry.

Very good, though my kids wouldn't touch it.  Used small red skinned potatoes so I wouldn't have to peel them.  Left out the caraway seeds because I don't like them.  Cooked the chicken (frozen) as breasts for 2 hours on high in some cider, then shredded the chicken and put it back in with the remaining ingredients on low for 5-6 hours.  Also followed another user's tip about thickening with some cornstarch at the end.  Will make again.

Surprisingly delicious!  I am not a stew person but wanted a crockpot recipe with potatoes and chicken.  I placed frozen chicken breasts on the veggies as well.  Subtly sweet, very tasty; the flavors blend well.  I will make this again!
