I'll be honest, in the morning when I first made the sauce and did the old "finger dip taste test", I wasn't crazy about the flavor.  But when I made the entire dish that evening, WOW!  I made a special trip to a Oriental market for fresh lemongrass and that made a huge impact on the sauce.  We had the fish served over rice and a side dish of green beans.  Very rich, very Thai.  I highly recommend you double the sauce in this recipe.   I'm going to try it over chicken as well.

The basis was good.  I used fresh ginger instead of ground, swapped curry paste for the tumeric,used a whole lemon grass stalk, and omitted the pepper flakes. I also added about 1/8 cup of Fish sauce.  I also added garlic in the mix.  It was a five star after that.

This is a very good recipe.  I used garlic chili paste instead of crushed red pepper to give it an authentic Thai flavor.  Would definitely recommend making this dish.

As a Thai food loving family we all agreed this was fantastic! The flavors all came together nicely, I couldn't find lemon grass so I used lemon zest. I'm also not a fan of nuts in my food so first I pulverized the almonds in the blender then I added the other ingredients and blended. I served it over sticky sushi rice, we couldn't get enough!

Do you remember the movie, 'Amadeus?' The part when Salieri was performing a little march in Mozart's honor of meeting.  Mozart took the silly little tune and turned it into something great.  The same holds true with this recipe. I added one whole can of coconut milk, 3 x 1 inch piece of ginger peeled,12 almonds, 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, 1 tablespoon of fish sauce, 2 tablespoons of curry paste(red or green or yellow) dropped the salt and sprinkled the fish on one side with hot curry powder and black pepper and garlic powder on the other side.  I added 1 tablespoon of sesame oil to the pan and lightly fried both sides of the fish and then covered with the sauce on low heat for 15 minutes,  garnished lightly with red pepper powder, then  served over a bed of rice.That was really an AWESOME dish!!!

This recipe is simply awesome!! It's soo tasty, you can't get enough of it. My boyfriend told me this was the best fish recipe he ever tasted and I agree with him... I suggest to double the sauce though, it is really good and goes very well with basmati rice.

That was interesting...and tasty.  Left out the fresh lemon grass (didn't want to make a special trip to an Asian market for a tiny amount).  I added just the right amount, for me, crushed red pepper flakes and a dash of cayenne pepper. Watch your cooking times, might not need 15 minutes.

Made this for company last night and it was a hit!  I suggest definitely doubling the sauce and adding a teaspoon or so of garlic, a tablespoon or more of brown sugar and some curry powder (just a dash).  We also added a bit of red pepper flakes to the sauce for a bit more spice.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe because it was only 4 points on Weight Watchers.  I didn't know quite what to expect, but when we tried it... wow!  My wife told me to keep it in my bag of tricks because she wanted me to prepare it again.  Almost any mild pan fish could be substituted for the tilapia.  I have since substituted chicken breasts with favorable results.

Very nice! I can see this becoming a favorite in our family. I doubled the sauce as some suggested. The only thing is, I think the ginger might be too much because it's a bit bitter, next time I'll put only half the amount. And I will ground the almond first before putting it with the rest of the sauce ingredients. Thank you for a very nice recipe. I love it!

This is one of our favorite tilapia recipes.  It's easy, fast and I served it with Thai peanut noodles and a spring mix of greens with an oriental salad dressing.  It was delish!

We really enjoyed this recipe and will make it again with additions/changes based upon the contents of my pantry. I made and refrigerated the sauce yesterday afternoon, because we had last minute dinner quests and I didn't have enough Tilapia. For the sauce, I omitted the salt-intentionally; the red pepper flakes-unintentionally; and doubled the almonds because we love almonds. Everything blended wonderfully in a regular blender.  Instead of stove top, I baked at 400F for ~20 minutes in an aluminum foil-covered pan with some Safflower oil. Really yummy. In the future I'll use fresh coconut milk (all I had was the canned stuff) and some of the meat, fresh ginger, and will be sure not to omit the red pepper flakes.

The very best way to serve tilapia. My son made it and told me about it. My husband and I love it! I've made it many times and passed the recipe on to others as my son did with me.

This is so unique, it was the first time I cooked with lemon grass and I wasn't disappointed. I like to purchase thicker cuts of tilapia for this recipe so that it can absorb the flavors. I also use light coconut milk to cut back on the calories. Very nice change to my typical broiled tilapia.

This was an excellent dish.  My 4 year old gobbled it up.  We did need to add salt and red pepper to it when eating, but that is how we prefer it anyway.  We doubled the sauce recipe too to have it to put over the rice. We used frozen Tilapia filets which do tend to get a little fishy tasting, but this did not taste fishy at all.  Will definitely make this again!

I found the flavor of the sauce too mild and sedate to merit the appellation "thai-style".  I love Thai food and even the fish dishes have more flavor.  I don't know if it's a matter of putting more spices, using red onions instead of white onions or what.  I used half a white onion, four thai chilies and cilantro and find the flavor mild at best.  I'm not crazy about this dish.

Very tasty and nice for a different take on fish.  The tilapia came out with a wonderfully delicate taste which actually was a little overpowered by the sauce.  About 2/3 of the way through my portion (which was quite a bit larger than the weight mentioned in the recipe) I scraped off the sauce and enjoyed the fish by itself.  The sauce is very good, but becomes a bit cloying after a while.  I cut the amount of ginger by a little bit, and I'm glad I did--it would have been too much.  Next time I'm going to try this with low-fat coconut milk, too.

I could not find fresh lemon grass, so used dried, but it tasted wonderful.  Fish is not my favorite, but I really enjoyed the tilapia and will make it again.

this is a wonderfully easy recipe... so delicious everyone loved it, even people who don't like fish... I have made it with Shrimp and tilapia.  Glad I read the reviews because I did double the sauce and you need to.  I also added garlic and thai red curry paste (1 T)  Very yummy!!!

I give this 4 1/2 stars... It was so easy, and so good- a winning combo in my book!  I added garlic, and if I were going to make it again I would use a full cup of coconut milk, there wasn't enough sauce as written.  Otherwise the flavors and texture of the fish was awesome!

I have tilapia for dinner very often, have tried several different recipes and while all of them are really good, this one is amazing!!! I didn't have turmeric, but the flavor was authentic without it, and instead of simmering the fish on the skillet, I baked it (375F, for the first 5-7 minutes just fillets seasoned with kosher salt and pepper, then I added the sauce and baked for another 13-15 minutes). Definitely getting some more tilapia tomorrow for my next dinners this week!

Doubled the sauce like other suggested and added a handful of cilantro to the blender also added more garlic and ginger and lemon grass than was called for.  Turned out really well.  I'm a huge Thai food fan, and even though I would make this recipe  again I felt like something was missing that gives Thai food that uniqueness.

This is fairly good. It's even better, though, if you double the sauce and instead of tilapia, simmer one pound of peeled shrimp in it for about 15-20 minutes and then serve it over hot steamed rice.

Wonderful recipe.  I made some of the suggested changes, doubled the sauce, I didn't have lemon grass so I used a little lemon pepper, added some garlic and curry powder.  Served over rice.  It is a definite keeper.

While I did not follow this recipe, but mostly got inspired by it, I did combine the onions and coconut milk (I used hot Berber spice, curry, dried ginger,lemon juice and a handful of flaked coconut at the end) and simmered the fish. This was something that I never do with fish(usually always flour and pan fry). The whole family from my 3 year old to my 13 year old, enjoyed it and ate everything up, no leftovers. And the most incredible thing was that I did it with frozen fillets (I was in a jam) and still it was lovely. Thanks for the inspiration!

I'm sorry to report that I found this quite bland. From someone who truly enjoys Thai restaurant food, this was only a distant cousin. I used lite coconut milk (part of the problem?) and about 2.5 tbsp of fresh lemon grass. While there was definite heat in the sauce, it was not the craved mouth-burning flavor of Thai food. Maybe the addition of curry (as others suggested) might have helped? Two stars here are for presentation -- the turmeric-yellow sauce looked wonderful in the pan and on the plate. I also recommend jasmine rice as a complement.

We liked this a lot.  We also doubled the sauce and added red curry paste, a little chili oil and fish sauce. Very good - we all had seconds.

The sauce came out really lumpy b/c of the processed almonds.  Maybe my blender is not good at pureeing the nuts.  Seemed bland to me, but I did cut out the hot spices b/c I can't handle it.  I felt it missed flavor (not spiciness).

This is a very tasty dish, filled with strong, Thai flavor.  Lemon grass and coconut milk are the two ingredients that really make the recipe Thai.  Lemon grass in particular imparts a highly recognizable flavor; substituting cilantro or parsley, as mentioned by other reviewers, will not give you a real sense of this recipe.  If you can't find fresh, try dried.  It's just not the same without the lemon grass.

It tastes great but is extremely filling and rich.  The sauce is so velvety!  My husband loved it and I'll probably make it again.  I added some baby corn and omitted the red pepper flakes.  :-)

This was very good. I made several changes though. I added the juice of one lime to the sauce, replaced lemongrass (I had none!) with ground coriander, added around a 1/2 tsp ground cumin, and replaced the red pepper flakes with 1/3 or 1/2 tsp of cayenne. The recipe seems very nice and flexible. I'll definitely make it again!

Great unusual flavor. My husband loves this. I did find the cooking time to be a bit long, and the first time I cooked this I over-did the cayenne--be go easy on it. Overall a great recipe.

This was sooooo good.  I had made Tilapia once before and found it had very little flavour which is why this recipe is such a hit.  It is full of flavour.  I doubled the recipe so there would be lots of sauce which is also good over rice. Coconut milk makes it!

My family really like this tasty fish dish. It was easy to fix. I used a lite coconut milk. when I was finished, I used the rest of the can of milk to make a pumpkin pie. It also turned out well.

The sauce was delicious with the addition of more chile.  I also had to use lemon zest as lemongrass is not available here.  I used it to disguise some old fish filets that had been in the freezer a questionable length of time.  It worked very well on top of sushi rice.  The fish tasted fine.

I love this recipe and have made it quite a few times.  I don't change any ingredients.  However, I do not puree the sauce ingredients.  I like the texture of the nuts, lemongrass & onion.  When I can't find fresh lemongrass I buy the pureed lemongrass in the tube.  I find it in the refrigerated section of the produce.  I use sliced almonds.  I just mix it all up & pour over after fish has cooked in pan.  Quick and elegant little dish if you want to impress.  Pair with brown or jasmine rice.

This was absolutely amazing!  I didn't have lemon grass, so I added a few tablespoons of fresh cilantro and a teaspoon of dried lemon peel.  I also used fresh ginger and a teaspoon of minced garlic.  We didn't add any red pepper flakes and it was still very flavorful.  This will be great with chicken.  Thank you for the recipe!!!!

I loved this receipe. My kids aren't crazy about tiliapia so I use boneless chicken thighs or even cubed chicken breasts. The best part is the pureed sauce. The first time I made it I didn't have any fresh lemon grass so I used the paste that comes in a tube by Gourmet Garden Lemon Grass Herb Blend. It was a good substitute.

We loved this!  It was excellent, with one minor addition.  I added 1 Tbsp of Thai Red Curry paste.  I also used an entire can of coconut milk because my family likes to have extra sauce for the rice.

I tried this recipes, and wasn't a big fan.  It tasted really bland, no real flavor.  I love Thai food, and this just didn't cut it.

Yum!  What a delicious recipe!  I followed the directions mostly- with the exception of a little less red pepper because I wanted my 2 year old to eat it too! I also used about 1 tsp. of dried lemon grass because I couldn't find fresh. I can't wait to try this with chicken too!  Flavors are GREAT!  Served over jasmine rice and it was awesome!

This a fantastic recipe - probably my favourite so far from this site. This recipe presents beautifully (if you're trying to impress guests) and adults and kids alike will love it.  (I tell my 3 year old it's chicken and he loves it.) Even better - it's delicious as leftovers.
I follow the tip about doubling the sauce - really important.

This was my first time to make fish, and it was wonderful.  I left out the lemon grass, and I used a can of cream of coconut and a small can of crushed pineapple.  My whole family loved it!!!

Great easy and fast recipe.  I forgot the ginger and I think the dish missed it :( Other then that I found it a bit bland and did add extra red pepper flakes on top of each serving, served with sweet mango rice to cut the spicy, supper yummy, thank you!

Amazing meal, but unless you have to, don't skip the lemongrass!  I made it without it, and wish I had run to the store to get more. Served over rice and it was delicious.

Good but mild. Didn't use the chili flakes. I felt like it was missing something. Next time, I might add some veggies, like potatoes.

This recipe needs a lot of work. It is known that Thai food has to be well balanced salty, sweet, sour and hot. I have used fish sauce instead of the salt, added a bit of sugar, a squeeze of lemon and a chili. I have also used more lemongrass and added some shredded kafir lime leaves. it tasted a lot better.

Smelled fantastic, looked authentic, but tasted very bland. I think it just needs a little something extra to give it that authentic Thai kick, I'm just not sure what.

This was delicious!!! I took the advice of some other reviewers and added curry paste in place of tumeric and was not at all disapointed!  I love thai food and this definitely had good thai flavour.  Don't skip the lemon grass!

So I used lemon juice instead of lemongrass (hey, it was Easter), fresh grated ginger instead of powdered, and a whole can of full-fat coconut milk (oops--forgot to check the measurements).

The result was really saucy and yummy, excellent over brown rice.  I can't wait to try the lemongrass if it's this good without it!

There was little flavor in this.  I added curry, extra cayenne, garlic, extra onion and it was still to bland for us.  My boyfriend cleans his plate with the dishes I make.  He had two bites of this meal and said he couldn't eat it anymore.  Would not reccommend this.

This is a delicious and easy dish!  Following other suggestions, I doubled the sauce.  I omitted the almonds, substituted curry powder for the tumeric, skipped putting salt and pepper on the fish, and added 2 T. of fish sauce.

This was really very good.  I didn't have coconut milk, so used Cream of Coconut.  Others had said to double the sauce so I used 1/2 cup of the cream and 1/2 cup of milk.  That was still a bit too sweet (although my son thought it was perfect), so next time I'll just use 1/4 cup of the cream.  The red pepper on top is a must!  Definitely lights up the dish.  This was a fine restaurant quality dish.

I make this recipe today and it was really good. I also felt it was an easy thing to make. I had to make a couple of substitutions, and it worked just fine.

Lemon Grass - Lemon zest

Really incredible flavor!  Followed the directions pretty closely, but I eyeballed the measurements.  Probably used more onion than the recipe called for, and instead of red pepper flakes I put a single thin serrano slice on each filet.  Would make again.

I will definitely make this again! I used pecans instead of almonds because that's what I had on hand, and I used lemongrass paste since the grocery store didn't have fresh lemongrass. I also forgot to add parsley because I meant to grab some out of the garden, but it was delicious nonetheless, and I'll add it next time.

Doubled the sauce at other reviewers suggestion and subbed few drops lemongrass essential oil for fresh lemongrass. Great way to make tilapia more exciting, delicious with coconut lime rice.

I made a few changes to this,  I didn't have lemon grass on hand, so I used a limes and a little lime zest.  I also sauteed carrots, red bell pepper and spinach to top off the tilapia before adding the sauce.  I have to say, it was tasty.

I doubled the sauce like others had suggested. I didn't have lemongrass (too expensive for the amount used in the recipe) I did add 1 minced garlic clove. It turned out full of flavor and the fish was nice and flakey - not tough and over cooked (although I only cooked it about 10 min.). I will definitely make this again.

This needed a little sweetener to add some missing flavor.  I sprinkled a little white sugar on top after serving it, but I would add some brown sugar next time while it's cooking.  Also, I doubled the sauce and it was delicious.

I increased the recipe. I also added cinnamon, garlic, curry, apple cider vinegar, brown sugar, and cumin. I garnished with cilantro. I substituted lemon zest for the lemongrass. 5 stars with additions.

This recipe was great! We made it exactly to the instructions and it turned out very tasty. It was so easy. The hardest part was finding lemongrass which we ended up finding in the international foods section in a jar instead of using fresh. We also used light coconut milk to cut down on the calories even more. Definitely recommended.

Delicious sauce!  I didn't have lemongrass, so I used lemon basil.  Next time I'll try lemongrass, just to see the difference - but I certainly wasn't disappointed.  I took others' suggestions about doubling the sauce.  Great tip.  While it increased the calories of the dish, it was worth it.

I only gave this a four when ours was a five with help. I added the turmoric but added thai green curry paste (1 1/2 t.)and red curry powder (1/2 t.) and also a t. or two of fish sauce. I didnt have lemon grass so I added fresh lemon juice. Everything including the pepper flakes were put into the vitamix.

I followed this recipes basics, and made modifications based on what I have on hand, personal tastes, and also other reviews.  I did make about twice the amount of sauce, as recommended.  I didn't have coconut milk, so I used instead milk, cream and shredded coconut.  I used a curry paste in place of ginger, garlic and turmeric.  I also used a whole lemongrass twig (because I LOVE lemongrass), and some fresh cilantro and a sprinkle of crushed red pepper (we like it spicy) all to the blender.  The sauce came out great but I had to use a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up.  I had leeks on hand, so sauteed them with a little olive oil and white wine before adding my fish fillets (I used haddock) and my sauce mixture.  I simmered the fish for about 15 minutes.  I served on rice, topped with steamed red and green bell peppers.

Made it with double the sauce (for the rice- based on the reviews), was out of Tumeric and decided I wanted to do Curry...  Also decided to throw the red pepper flakes into the food processor to get the heat all over.  The aroma was not good...  the first few tastes were so disappointing.  I added more salt, and it was better.  Maybe some more lemongrass?  (but one reviewer said not to) definately needs something more... When I go for my leftovers I will try some lime juice and more heat...

This was very good! I didn't have coconut juice since we're about 20 minutes from the closest asian store so I used what I had in hand (guilty!); coconut cream called Coco Real usually used for our pina coladas! Since it's pretty sweet I used half and the rest just water. I didn't have turmeric so I googled the next best and it said dry mustard, since I didn't have that guess what? A squirt of it didn't alter the taste and added a bit of color! It came out sweet, tangy, perfect! Loved it!

I thought this recipe was very good.  I am always serching for new and different recipes and this one fit the task.  I did not use the lemon grass or turmeric as where I live it was not avilable but we still enjoyed it.  Gave tilapia a whole new taste.

This was not what we were hoping for! I made it exactly by the recipe and it did not taste good. Since I was already committed, I made it again, used 1/2 the turmeric, more lemon grass and fresh ginger. It helped, it was still not good.

This dish was a huge disappointment. There was little to no taste, and I followed the recipe to a "T." Worst of all, we think the smell rates lower than the taste. We will continue to explore Thai cooking, but we will never make this again.

I loved the recipe.  My family are not big fish eaters so this was perfect.  I did not have a very good curry for the recipe, so it was lacking a little.  Next time I will use a more pungent curry powder.

Like many of the other reviews, I thought it was good but lacked something.  In my experience, Thai restaurants typically serve the coconut sauce a bit thicker or creamier and that is what I was expecting.    I substituted the tumeric with madras curry and doubled the sauce and it turned out to be more than enough for 4 fillets.  Overall, pretty good flavor, but it does need some salt to pull it out.

This recipe was pretty good! I think it would have been better if I had had the lemon grass on hand but as it is I substituted cilantro and added a bit of lime juice to the coconut milk sauce. I will probably make again as it is really an easy and tasty dish even without the lemon grass.

Made this recipe to the T except I didn't have lemon grass, so I substitued parsley with a squeeze of lemon. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special. The thinner pieces of fish tasted better. Probably will not make again.

I made this last night-- It was my first attempt to make Thai styled anything-- That being said, I found the fish in this dish to be wonderful-- but the sauce was horrible.  The flavors were way too strong.  I guess if you like the spice, It be great but for me it was just too strong.

Great recipe! Absolutely loved it. My first time trying tilapia, but it was sooo good. Thank you for this recipe.
