I LOVED this. I doubled the recipe so I could take dinner to a friend as well and it turned out to be a HUGE pot of food enough to feed both of our families dinner twice with more for a lunch as well! Because kids were going to be eating it I skipped the jalepeno and only added half the chili powder. It was not spicy at all, but it was still full of flavor! I did have to add some liquid, and I used a can of chicken broth (or half a can for a single recipe). I will definitely be making this again. EDIT: Now that I have made this a second time I will say that I believe that the flavor is much improved by cooking the quinoa in chicken broth (or vegetable broth if you prefer) instead of water. I think I did this without even thinking about it the first time because I almost always do when cooking grains. This time I didn't bother with it, and the flavor was not as good. I remedied it by dissolving some "Better than Bouillon" in a couple of tablespoons of water and stirring this into the finished chili.

Wow, so good (we love quinoa), I omitted the zucc (didn't have one) and the meat and added a can of V8 as it was quite dry.  Excellent flavour and left overs for lunches!  We will make this at least once a month, thanks for the recipe.

I liked this a lot but had to add some water to keep it from getting too thick.  Also, with personal taste, I just like things a bit spicier so added some ground red pepper.   I served mine over a baked potato with shredded low fat cheese and fat free sour cream and it was great.

This is an amazing chili recipe!  I followed the directions exactly except that I cooked the chili in the crock pot.  I didn't add the quinoa to crock pot because I was afraid it would dry out into porridge.  I cooked it on low for 15 hours and then added the cooked quinoa to the finished chili.  The chili was a tiny bit watery from the crock pot, but it thickened up nicely once I added the quinoa.  This is a really tasty and healthy recipe.  I topped it with a bit of avocado and cheddar cheese.

Quinoa Chili Haiku: "Magical quinoa, elevates chili to 'wow!' A little too thick." This chili is heavenly, and we adored the earthy bite of the quinoa addition. I only wish that I'd added some diced canned chipotles in adobo, per the other recipe on here for "Black bean quinoa chili" b/c I think that would've added a special flavor that this seemed to be missing. Otherwise, I was faithful to the recipe's ingredients, but I put everything (save the cooked quinoa) in the crockpot b4 leaving for work in the a.m., and stirred the quinoa in when I got home. The quinoa balloons up so I only made about 3/4 c., and then it begins to absorb all of what remains of the liquid in the chili (which really, is only that from the canned tomatoes), so I had to add a little water to counter the gummy thickness. With a sprinkle of cheese and a handful of cilantro, this recipe has transformed us into quinoa+chili junkies.

I was doing a cleanse and decided to give this recipe a try (without the ground beef) to add a little variety to my boring cleanse diet. What a pleasant and tasty surprise this dish turned out to be! I never would have thought of using quinoa this way. Thanks for the recipe! It is now a part of our regular rotation :)

We LOVED this recipe. Instead of beef, I used ground turkey (dieting here) and didn't put in any of the jalapeno (kids). I added a little extra cumin instead and left out the chili powder. Kids loved it as it was so colourful & the hubby too. Definitely making this again and again.

Wonderful! This dish is delicious, hearty, and healthy... what more could you want? The only thing I did differently was that I added about a cup of vegetable broth when I added the tomatoes as the chili was very thick and I didn't think it would hold the quinoa well. It was a little "soupy" but when I added the quinoa at the end it soaked everything up to create a thicker consistency (which I prefer when it comes to chili). My boyfriend would have liked it a little spicier so I think I will add a bit more kick to it next time. Overall, a wonderful meal that I will be making again!

This is fantastic. I made it with the intention of freezing it in portions, then reheating at work, so I wasn't too excited about it at the time. When the time to reheat came, it was incredible. I even got multiple "That smells GOOD" comments from cubemates. Definitely a must try!

Recipe was good, a little spicy. I suggest cooking the quinoa in half water, half chicken broth for extra flavor.  I made it with chicken instead of beef, too. Came out well!

I was looking for a good way to introduce my family to quinoa; I have some very picky eaters. It was a HUGE success! We all loved it! Topped with a little sour cream, cheese, green onions and cilantro... This is a 10!!!

I really enjoyed this!  
I used 8 chicken tenders (sliced into 1" strips) instead of ground beef, didn't add the jalapeno or corn (didn't have any), and added around 1/3 cup of chicken broth at the end because it was a little thick.
After cooking the onion, garlic, and spices, I cooked the chicken and then proceeded to add the tomatoes and the other ingredients following.
It wasn't my kids favorite, but they ate it.  I will certainly make this for myself again and look forward to leftovers tonight.

This was an appealing recipe beacuse of all the vegetables and the intersting healthy grain, but if you are from Texas or the Southwest there is  not enough spice or flavor. Hopefully, the taste will improve with refrigeration. We have lots of leftovers. Won't be making this recipe again .

Simply wonderful! Followed recipe but altered slightly to better suit our taste. Since we prefer our dishes not too spicy, I omitted the jalapeno. Omitted the grn pepper since we don't care for grn peppers & increased the r. pepper since we love r. pepper. After sautéing the onion (& 5 lg. clvs garlic at the last 2 mins), I remove from skillet & sautéd r. pepper as well (about 8 mins). We like our r. pepper cooked down slightly to bring out the flavor (you could probably sauté the onion & r. pepper together, & garlic at last 2 mins). Tossed in zucchini at last 2 mins. Omitted cilantro since we don't care for it. Used organic chicken broth rather than water to cook quinoa (enhances flavor) & instead of ground beef or turkey, used TVP (Textured Vegetable Protein). A wonderful meat substitute! *Bob's Red Mill TVP is the best! (also Quinoa) Google it or look it up (Amazon, Vitacost, etc.) & read the reviews. This is a must have for the peeps who want to incorporate healthier foods into their diet. Reconstitute the TVP with org. chicken/veg. broth by bring broth to a simmer in med. skillet. Stir in TVP, lower temp. cont. stirring & let reconstitute for 1 min. Remove from heat & viola, you have your "protein packed" meat substitute. Added an extra cup of org. chicken broth to the chili to keep from being too thick. The chili was not only incredibly flavorful but it's PACKED with protein & virtually fat free. A dollop of low-fat sour cream made an extra yummy addition. Bon appétit!

To keep it vegetarian, substitute a 12 oz. package of veggie crumbles for the ground beef.

I haven't tried this, but it is similiar to my husbands chili, except for the quinoa. My husband makes his vegan by adding meatless grounds, and as former meat-eaters we swear you can't tell the difference!

This recipe was a great base, but i ended up not using corn, zucchini, or beef in it (had none in the house).  A couple of additions that I made: 1 cup red wine, 1 1/2 tsp paprika, another can of beans (i used pinto), and a packet of sazon.  I also took the suggestions from previous reviews and added more liquid. It's great after it's sat overnight.  Thanks!

Awesome, awesome recipe. And it makes SO much food - my boyfriend and I will be eating this for a week.  I did tweak it a little, though:

- Half an onion
- A whole package of assorted mushrooms instead of green pepper and zucchini
- Twice the chili powder and cumin
-Kidney beans instead of black beans - they are smoother and compliment the vegetables more, in my opinion.

The mushrooms really absorb the flavours of the spices and tomatoes, and go well with the quinoa's texture.

Made this recipe exactly as written, and it had no flavor whatsoever.  This was bizarre because it smelled wonderful when cooking.  Not a bad flavor, just none.  I wound up having to add a ton more spice (and of different variety) to get any taste to it.

Wonderful!  Favorite chili I have made!  I didn't have a  jalapeno so I used a salsa pepper instead.  It was nice and spicy.  But I had to feed some who didn't like spice.  To tame it down I added tomato paste, little stevia, and used milk with the quinoa instead of water (I used a crockpot).

So good. Didn't want it to be too spicy, so cut out the jalapeno and used chili powder to taste. I cook the quinoa in vegetable broth for more flavor and I find that I need to continuously add liquid to the cooking quinoa to keep it from burning. I have made this many times and it is definitely my favorite chili recipe.

LOVED THIS!!  Every time I find a recipe with quinoa, I am anxious to try it as I love the grain so much - this caught my eye as an unusual and interesting way to use it!  I did not add the cilantro at the end due to personal taste (dislike!) and I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I also swapped some of the regular chili for some chipotle chili to add some more heat.  The other main thing which I found key for this recipe - it NEEDS more liquid.  Along with the can of crushed tomatoes, I added a full can of water to the chili, otherwise it would have been way too thick.  Overall, a fantastic dish, very yummy and very hearty!  A repeat for sure :)

Just made for my family. Used things I had on hand like a packaged chili spice mix. Wonderful!  Extra cilantro right before serving and a dollop of sour cream pushed it over the top. I will leave out the ground beef next time. It was overkill. Froze like a charm in individual servings.  Used red quinoa which gave it a rich nutty flavor.

This was a good concept and I followed the recipe pretty much as stated. I had to add about a cup of vegetable broth to thicken it up, and I added some taco seasoning and more chili powder. The end result was just ok. I found it quite bland and ended up adding more seasoning and hot sauce to my bowl.  I also added extra cilantro to the top, along with some cheese.  I appreciate the quinoa/beef idea, but I won't be making this again.

This is on our regular rotation.  My whole family loves this including our 15 month old.  It is very mild even with the jalapeno.  
One hint is to soak the quinoa before cooking it.  Quinoa has a bitter outer coating that will be removed if soaked then rinsed before cooking it.
So yummy!

This chili tasted great although I changed it up a bit.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and omitted the jalepenos because I didn't have any.  In its place, I used crush red pepper and also a couple tablespoons of horseradish for an extra kick.  I also didn't use zucchini because I didn't have any on hand.  Lastly, I didn't add the quinoa to the pot of chili because it is my personal preference to mix the quinoa and chili in my bowl (because of the water soaking up issue).

Followed proportions on all ingredients and it was outstanding.  Added some spicy V8 tomato juice at the end so it wasn't as thick.

Very nice meal. There are so many ingredients in there that I decided not to add the quinoa in the end. Instead I layered the chili over the quinoa when I served it. I agree that quinoa is better prepared in a broth instead of water for better flavor.

This was a fantastic, healthy chili. It freezes easily. I put the left overs into small freezer containers and brought them to work for lunches. Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was featured on the food blog Colourful Dish (www.colourfuldish.wordpress.com) and it was really tasty, but I must say that I found it a little bland as is, so I did add some extra seasoning to make it pop just that much more.

I also didn't have zucchini so I added bok choy instead. It was a very colourful dinner and all in all it was tasty. With that said, it's very similar to other chilis, and I would've thought that given it's name, the quinoa would've had a more powerful role.

Our whole family loved this meal, gave it 8/10, even our 5 yr old and 7 yr old friend ended up eating 2nds. I used 1/2 lb ground brown chicken and pink himalayan sea salt which really brought out the flavours. It was also very dry for me so I added about a cup  of water and veg broth to keep it moist. It's definitely on the high frequency list.

I loved this recipe...but I didn't use beef and doubled the chili powder and cumin since we like things with a little more kick.   Thanks for introducing me to quinoa...I'll definitely make this again and look for other quinoa recipes.

Love this! The first time making it, it turned out quite thick. Because we prefer a more liquid based chili, the second time I added a can of tomato soup, 1/2 can water, a whole can of dark red kidney beans without rinsing or draining them along with the 1 can of black beans, which I did drain and rinse. Because of the addition of tomato soup I increased a few ingredients to accommodate – 6 cloves garlic, 3 Tablespoons chili powder, 1 1/2 Tablespoons ground cumin, 1 1/2 teaspoons oregano.  We also tend to like our chili to be on the zippy side, I used one large jalapeno pepper removing only ½ the seeds and ribs. Served it with a bit of shredded cheddar cheese on top, and yum to the maximum!! It’s a huge hit with the family and friends!! Also, I did brown the meat with the onion, bell pepper, jalapeno, and garlic. I then pretty much followed the recipe from that point. The reason for doing this was strictly a time issue – running short. However, it did not seem to make a difference in the end. Great recipe – thanks for sharing!

I made the vegetarian version by excluding the meat. It didn't have quite a enough spice for me (I LOVE everything spicy) so I add some hot sauce to it everytime I eat it :) I really enjoy healthy, delicious dishes like this. I'll for sure save the recipe!

This was out of sight! Friends and family loved it. I did alter based on what was in my fridge. Everything I did the same except for I used ground turkey, two red bell peppers, no zucchini, and I had no corn by itself so I dumped in 1/2 a bag of frozen mixed vegetables. It was really good and the quinoa allows you to eat smaller portions because it is so filling.  However, you are going to want more just because it tastes great! My first review even though this has been my go to website for quite some time.

The taste was good, but next time I would cut down on the amount of quinoa.  It was more like a chili-flavored quinoa side dish than chili.  Or maybe I'm just too picky right now because I'm pregnant and any food kind of makes me queasy.  I'll add an extra star just for that.

Pretty good!  I added more crushed tomatoes because it was really thick.  Also had to add more chili powder and replaced jalapeno with red pepper flakes.

I have made this about 4 times so far and it has been an absolute hit with friends and family. Sometimes I will use a different meat such as lamb or pork and add a chilli sauce instead of jalapeño peppers, but overall it has been great. I haven't followed the measurements exactly since everyone has different taste, I simply taste as I go along and add more herbs/spices as needed. I love that this is very healthy and filling.

I love this recipe and it was very easy to make vegetarian with veggie crumbles.  I felt it was too thick though and added a 12 oz can of tomato sauce plus a can of water  The second time I made it I added in a can of mushrooms.  Very versatile.

I have made this a number of times now and find it to be a very versatile recipe.  You can substitute ground lamb for the ground beef,  and add some garam masala and have a sort of chili/curry cross.  Or you can prepare it with soy ground beef for vegetarians or exclude the meat altogether.   It is great for using up any left over vegetables.  Everyone who has tried it, loved it!

Made it for family and friends and it was delicious.  Everyone gave it a big thumbs up!  After reading a few reviews, I decided not to put as much quinoa so as to have some sauce leftover.  Will definitely make it again.

I really liked this chili. I made it for a chili cook off and it was nice to have a different and interesting chili in the mix. The only thing I would add to this recipe is either some Asian hot sauce or more jalapenos. I felt that the intense cumin flavor mixed with the nuttiness of the quinoa could stand up to to a bit more heat.

My guy & I like our chili thick so this was perfect. I drained off most juices from the beans, tomatoes, etc, but left a tish in to make it a little naturally juicy.

Made this vegetarian by using the soy ground beef crumbles in place of ground beef... I have been wanting to try quinoa for the longesst and this is a great way to try it. i used organic vegetable broth from TJs to cook the grain . It reminded me of grits but with an oomph! I think I will have to warm my teenager up to quinoa though. he is veg but this grain has a weird (but weird in a good way) texture. hes the type that dosent like things because of texture. I also kept the quinoa separate from the chili because everyone says it soaks up all the juice. i put the chili in a bowl, topped with quinoa and chopped fresh cilantro and MAN is this delicious

This was very good.  The Quinoa was a different touch.  Even though I LOVE chili on a baked potato as one cook did I couldn't do it with this one - would have been much too heavy.  This is good as is.  I skipped the zuccini - didn't want to waste one because it would have got lost.  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  Other then that I followed the recipe exactly - only increasing the cumin - that is just personal preference.  The heat was just right.

I included the ground beef.  It is a very thick chili which lacked the kick of chili.  I added lots more spices to make it taste like chili.  Once doctored up it was good.  Easy to make so will make it again.

Original recipe was great taste-wise but it was a little too dry.  I added a small can of diced tomatoes with juices and it greatly helped the texture.  I would definitely make this again.

This was a great easy recipe! My family loved it. I made it extra spicy by adding more jalapenos and red pepper flakes. I did not feel overly full after eating this like with most chilis. I will certainly make it again!

We loved this recipe! It comes out thick, like chili stew. I omitted the beef to keep it vegetarian, and I didn't have cilantro on hand. It came out very tasty. This is on our new favorite list and it was very fast to make.

Some adjustments made but I don't see how you could go wrong with this recipe, all the basics are there to adjust it to your liking. I made this with what I had in the pantry, so instead of 28oz crushed tomatoes, I used a can of Rotel and a can of diced tomatoes. The Rotel more than made up for the fact I didn't have a jalapeno. I left out the meat altogether and used just half the cumin. When adding the quinoa back in, it did absorb a lot of liquid, so I did as some other reviewers did and added a bit of V8. Loved it and will make it again sometime!

I am not a fan of traditional chili but this recipe is excellent! I changed a few things due to not having all the ingredients. I used 2 pablano peppers instead of red bell pepper/zucchini, basil instead of parsley, and 9 green onions instead of an onion. I do not like a strong pepper taste so I cooked the peppers in olive oil until they started to soften before adding them. We topped it with Greek yogurt and a little cheese--delicious!

We used 1 can of chili beans, garbanzo beans and light kidney beans instead of 3 cans black beans. Added a lot more garlic and a can of diced tomatoes. Added a cup of water too because it was pretty thick. Loved it!!! Quinoa was such a great addition!

A very unique Chili, loved it! Next time I would add a can of plum tomatoes to make it less dry and more tomato-y, and omit one can of beans.

This went over very well with my wife and it was great to take to lunch the next day. I tried not to adjust the recipe too much but the black beans come in 15oz. Cans so, I add two cans for a total of 30 oz. of black beans. Still great! It will be in regular rotation.

Yummy!  This was absolutely delicious.  I used vegetable broth instead of water to cook the quinoa (I always do that when cooking with quinoa for richer flavor).  Left out the jalapeno.  I will definitely be making this again!

LOVE this recipe! A few edits... 
- I didn't have crushed tomatoes. Instead, I blended up a can of chopped tomatoes. 
-I left out the jalapenos because I didn't have any. I added a can of rotel instead.
- I added a TBSP of beef bullion to the pot of chili and 1 tsp of bullion per cup of water used to cook the quinoa. I put everything except the quinoa in the crockpot on low for 5ish hours. I cooked the quinoa in our rice cooker and added it at right before we sat down.

A super hearty chili- I left out the beef, and jalapeno.  I have a small rice cooker that I use to cook the quinoa in, which works great! I make this chili, with variations, several times a month!

Excellent Recipe. 
For my first time cooking with Quinoa and first time cooking chilly, this was amazing!
I added 1/2 T sugar to even out the "bitterness" with the salts and seasoning and BAM there it was!
I made a change to the beans also. I added one 15oz can of kidney beans; 7oz of white beans; 7oz of black beans. I love the presentation they make and the flavor is great (first time for white beans too!). 
I cooked 1c of Quinoa and only ended up putting 2/3 of it in. Perfect for me. 
I would also chop the cilantro way fine and use a little of it. 

Thanks for a delicious recipe. I will share with friends.

I have made this twice now and we love it! Instead of adding meat I use two sweet potatoes/yams which I chop up, microwave to soften and then stir in when I add the corn and quinoa. It is hearty and delicious! We will keep making this one!

This is definitely a very tasty chili. I made it exatly as called out the 1st time and thought it was really good. Since then I've made it many more times and have made some changes only to suit my own personal preferences. I either eliminate the bell peppers all together or substitute with sweet petite's. I just don't care for the texture of peppers. I also leave out the jalapeno, again texture issue and add a 15 oz. can of Hunt's sweet onion tomatoes, this really helps to compliment the little bit of heat of the chili.I try to always use fresh corn and always add some cayene pepper along with the black pepper. When the chili is done I always add several dashes of jalapeno flavored tobasco sauce. This really spices up the flavors. I don't add the quinoa to the chili and make cornbread for some family & friends who have that preference, and everyone makes there individual servings. As well, the cilantro is added individually per preference. Wonderful chili!

Perfect!!  Added a can of corn with the liquid in it, only had to add a little water close to the end.  Goes great with Hannaford's recipe for Hearty Corn and Bean pie

I made this completely vegetarian a couple of nights ago. So basically I just didn't add the beef, but put more beans and veggies in. Just used up my leftovers today and added sliced avocado, corn chips and a wedge of lime. It was delicious. Without the beef it's a very summery-tasting dish. I'll make it again for sure. Thanks :)

This was an excellent chili that only got better the second and third day.  The quinoa stayed crunchy and  the only thing I would change was to add a little salt (the recipe says to taste, but I'd add tsp or so right off the bat).  My husband said it's a keeper and I agree.

This is better than chili.  I made this for my husband, and we love it!  Tasty and you know you are getting the protein from the quinoa.  I always cook my quinoa in one cube of either vegetable bouillion or chicken.  Just a great recipe.

Great recipe! I omitted the corn and zucchini at the request of my husband, but put in more tomatoes to balance it out. Very hearty and flavorful. I doubled the batch and after the four of us ate, we have enough left over for several more meals. My kind of recipe!

I did not add the meat and found it wasn't missed at all.  The only thing I will change for next time is add a few fresh tomatoes and spice it up a bit more.

Great flavor! Made the recipe as is until about halfway through, then I realized it needed some liquid so I added two cups of water and a chicken boullion cube and that was perfect.  It says 8 servings, those are HEARTY servings.  For me personally I think it's closer to 10-12 servings.  Great for freezing for later though!

I didn't have jalapeño pepper, so I added a small can of diced green chilies.  I also omitted the zucchini because i didnt have it on hand. It made so much I made another meal out of it, I put it in a casserole dish, topped with fresh sliced tomatoes and sprinkled shredded cheese on top. It was a huge hit with even my picky eaters!

Great...even my picky husband enjoyed it!  I chose not to mix the quinoa in but served it on the side.  AND , I substituted soy crumbles for the turkey.

I thought this recipe was great and very easy to make, although I think the prep time is a little longer than it says. 

I don't eat red meat, so substituted ground turkey. Also, I didn't have chili pepper (didn't realize it until I was cooking), so I substituted a Cajun seasoning that still added a lot of great flavor (although I would change it to 3/4 tsp). Instead of the large bell peppers that it calls for, I opted for yellow, orange and red baby sweet bell peppers , which added great flavor.  It also added a nice touch of presentation, since they're smaller and can be cut from the ends up to the stem, resulting in small, circular slices that look lovely in the dish.

I agree that you need to add more water (I added one 28 oz can, and will need to add more to reheat, since it has thickened overnight).

All in all a great recipe for the cold weather!

Very good and filling! I did add a lot more seasoning to get it to taste more like chili. Also, I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth instead of water. It made a lot more than I was anticipating which was not a problem at all!

used a pre-packaged bag of quinoa, an extra pound of ground beef, a little less onion but was delicious.  My mother-in-law and husband raved about it.  Kids wouldn't touch it though.....

A yummy alternative recipe for chili, my favorite meal. I will definitely make this often. Might try a vegetarian approach for meals with my vegetarian friends.

This will be joining my normal rotation it is so good and easy! Made it as stated, but added some cinnamon, cloves and chocolate powder for a little something different. The combination of veggies (which I was extra heavy handed with in quantity) made for a great taste plus healthy too.

This was very good! The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I had to double up on most of the ingredients. I followed the recipe when I first made it and after it was simmering a little while it just wasn't spicy enough (and we don't even do real spicy in this house) so I had to double all the spices. I also added a can of diced "chili ready" tomatoes which really helped. I didn't add the whole pot of quinoa (which I cooked in vegetable stock first) because it just seemed like there would have been too much of it in there. I also had to add salt and like another reviewer I put in a couple teaspoons of cocoa powder. Although, to be honest, I don't know if it did anything but I wanted to try it!
All in all we both liked it and I will for sure make it again. Thank you.

I modified this recipe quite a bit and made it vegan but it was super delicious! I used cooked quinoa, black beans, salsa style diced tomatoes, minced garlic, a ton of chili powder, cumin and red pepper flakes. Since I left out a lot of the vegetables because I didn't have them (and the ground beef because I'm vegetarian) I added some baked tofu to bulk it up.

Good "chili". Although, as other people have said, it's a little on the thick side to be traditional chili. Not that it is bad, just maybe not what you'd expect making it. Only 2 changes I'd make is adding a bit more spice and double the meat.

Made this chili and it turned out wonderful. I added an extra 8onz of tomatoes and about 1/3cup of vegetable broth. I also added some celery and sautéed it together with the onion. Other than that, followed the rest of the recipe.

I gave it a 3 because the original recipe was 'okay'.  It was a bit too dry and devoid of flavor after adding in the beef and quinoa.  

I ended up doubling the herbs, adding about 1 tsp cumin, adding about 1/2 tsp chili powder, and 1 tsp paprika.  This, along with another 20 minutes of light simmering, at least brought the flavor through.  I also had to add 2 cups of water at the end and simmer away some of that to get to the consistency that I desired.  This brought the entire pot to a 4 star rating (it actually tasted like chili) and edible over a longer period.

In the future, I think I'll try a few things.  FYI: when they say 'large pot', they really mean LARGE POT!  First, I would absolutely cook the ground beef with some of the spices like chili powder, paprika, and S&P so that the beef isn't completely bland.  I would double or even triple  the quantity of corn (I love corn).  I would also reduce the total quinoa by about 1/3.  I think I would also add a medium sized can of tomato sauce to bring out the tomato flavor and thickness.  

I'm going to try to freeze a healthy portion of this to save for later since there is no way I'm going to be able to finish the entire pot by myself.

I love this recipe!!! Everyone that I have made this for has also loved it. I've tried it both with meat & without & I almost prefer it without meat. It is definitely a little think which is how I like my chili, but if you don't I would suggest adding a little broth to thin it out.

Everyone liked this recipe in my household, except for my mom. She does not like new and exotic things though. But all 4 of my children thought this dish was great and it is rather nutritious which make it even better. (My husband likes almost everything I cook, so he had no complaints.) I added more chili powder, because for chili, I know from experience, that what is listed is not enough for a chili taste. I also dropped the corn, but that was just preference because not everyone here likes corn. I did make it with the zucchini. I will have to make this again sometime. :-)

This recipe was absolutely wonderful!! I cooked my quinoa in beef broth but left the rest of the recipe the same. Will definitely be making this again.

Great meal! I topped this dish with some diced avocado, a bit of grated cheddar, and served it with salsa and sour cream. Wonderful.

This had wonderful flavors (after I doubled the chili power and cumin) and was very filling. My family of six all loved it.  And, there was a lot of left overs!

Tasted amazing. I never had quinoa before so I was super happy when it came out tasted so delish!! Add some meat seasoning to the recipe to make it taste less like tomato and more like meat chili but other than that. Superb. Ty!!

Delicious! Very hearty and filling. Only thing I'd change is next time add less quinoa and more water at the end so it doesn't stick together and adds some juice to it.  Other than that, great chili!

I am giving this 4 stars because I had to double the spices and jalapeno to give it flavor to suit our tastes.  I also added about 1/2 cup of beef broth before adding quinoa.   Overall a very good recipe and a great way to incorporate quinoa into our diets.  Thanks for a good recipe.

Delicious! Lots of time needed to chop veggies so best to cook with your honey. Will definitely make again. I didn't use corn and instead of canned tomatoes I diced up fresh tomatoes. :)

I made this recipe with a combination of oat flour and all purpose flour. I also cut the honey down to 2/3 cup and substituted coconut milk for yogurt and organic coconut sugar for brown sugar. I made only 9 giant muffins and baked them for around 30 minutes until the toothpick test was clean. Wonderful and healthy!!!

1. I think the Quinoa was just a filler and got a little overwhelming ,I won't add it next time.
2. I think I will ad more of the seasonings next time, it was a little bland.
3. lastly it got a little dry by the end of cooking so I added some chicken stock.

Otherwise it was an ok recipe.

One of my favorites to make. I don't add in the beef since I don't think this needs it. The quinoa really does well as the star of this chili. I like some zing, so I add in three jalapeños and occasionally add in some cayenne pepper. This is a fun recipe to use as a starting block, then branch out to try new things. Each time I make it I try something new (different beans, different spices, different peppers), and it's never been bad.

I had quinoa, garbanzo beans and ground beef but it all worked in this chili! I was really surprised, to tell the truth. Good flavor. I reduced the chili powder and omitted the jalapeno as I'm not a fan of spicy. I also did not use the corn and zucchini as I didn't have either. The rest I followed. I enjoyed this. Will make again, and plan for the zucchini and corn.

I would eat this again! I used ground turkey (our normal substitution for ground beef) and adjusted the amount of peppers and spice to our taste.  A good main dish or can be used as a side for taco/carne night.

If you're looking for a chili that is mild, this is a good one, just leave out the jalapenos. My toddler doesn't like to much spice I so left those out and it still tasted pretty good. I didn't have peppers or zucchini so used up some celery instead and it worked fine.  THIS IS A THICK CHILI, you may want to add some liquid or don't drain the beans and corn.

4 stars only because I think the beef would be overkill! I left it out, and this made a superb vegetarian chili without it. The quinoa provides plenty of protein. A couple small tweaks based on preference and what I had available: Used less than a cup of quinoa, because I was almost out. Somewhere around 2/3c? It came out just right in my opinion, and maybe prevented it from being too thick like some reviewers have mentioned. I also cooked the quinoa in broth instead of water; subbed chopped jarred jalapeno slices for the fresh (it worked, but I'm sure the fresh would be better); used one can black beans and one can white kidney instead of two black; subbed Bragg Organic Sprinkle herb and spice blend for the dried parsley and oregano (that stuff is SO good for so many things, I highly recommend it!) Other than that I followed ingredients and amounts as written. I don't usually use a recipe for chili, so sometimes it comes out better than others. But this will be my go-to standard from now on! Served with cheese quesadillas, YUM. Thanks!

This is delicious.  I messed with it a bit though.  I used the juice in each can of ingredients as many reported it to be too dry as written.  Also, I used canned corn with the juice.  I cooked the quinoa in natural beef broth and added a lot more beef broth and a little water to the mix while it was cooking.  I threw in some garlic powder, salt and pepper toward the end as the flavors can cook off.  I cooked it a little longer than required, as that helps the flavors meld better.  Eating it next day for lunch at work as I write this!  Next time, I think I will cook the onion, garlic and spices in the large pot and add the meat to it for deeper flavor.

I have made this 2 times and have to add so much liquid that I then have to add many more spices to get the right flavor.  There is no way that you can make this without more liquid.  Original recipe should be adjusted accordingly.  It tastes great when I doubled the spices and added beef broth.

This was my first time trying Quinoa. It was pretty good. I read most of the reviews before attempting this recipe. Like most others had said, it was a little bland.  I added a few dashes of Worcershire sauce and that didn't fix it. Then i added some all purpose seasoning and it was still missing something. Then i added a packet of Ranch dressing. That was the ticket! It turned the chili from OK to amazing. I highly recommend this modification. I also loved all the vegetables in it. Don't skip the zucchini, it was my favorite part.

This was a great healthy meal. I love how you can make it vegetarian by omitting the meat which we did. It was so satisfying and filling and made enough for a few more dinners and lunches throughout the week. I made mine pretty spicy but really enjoyed it with a little melted cheddar on top and a dollop of plain Greek yogurt to cool it down. Will be making this again and again, many thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe. My husband loved it and my picky 8 year old ate every bite. I used chicken broth to cook the quinoa and left out the jalapeño and halved the chili powder and cumin. Just the right amount of spice for us.

I loved it. I had to use diced tomatoes instead, but it was still wonderful. Unfortuately I was the only one who did like it.

Was good. Made vegetarian by adding more beans and quinoa.

Everyone in my family loved this! I did add beef broth to make it a little juicier & my fiance loves a little more spice so we added red pepper, but otherwise no changes.  Great quinoa recipe!

Very healthy and filling!  The recipe makes enough for my family to eat on for several days.  We omit the beef and add lots of extra spices.

This turned out great.  Didn't use a green bell pepper - only red, and halved the recipe, and it was still a lot of chili.  Next time I wouldn't bother with the ground beef - it didn't need it.  Always good to have a solid vegetarian chili recipe around.

This has become one of my staples. So hearty and healthy. It is great in summer or winter. It's great with sour cream and a little cheese on top. I follow the recipe exactly and it turns out great every time. Thanks for the great recipe!

I didn't hate this, but it lacked the hearty tomatoe-y meaty goodness of regular chili.  I like a very thick chili with lots of beans and meat, and lots of good tomato flavor.  While this certainly filled the bill for thick, the veggies really thinned out the flavor, and to me, adding my expensive pound of grass fed beef was a waste, as it got lost in the huge amount that this made.  I ended up adding a lot more spices, some salsa, and some tomato sauce to give this more depth, only with so-so results.  When spooned over cornbread and topped with sour cream and cheese, I'm sure it'll pass muster, but really, in that case, what wouldn't?  Sorry, definitely won't replace my regular chili recipe with this one, and I love my quinoa and veggies just as much as the next girl.

this is both healthy and delicious.  Makes a big bunch and I may cut the quinoa in half next time.  Otherwise you have to add some more liquid to it as you go continue to reheat it, since there are only two of us.  V-8 small cans work nicely

This was pretty good - in my house we always put mixed veggies in the chili, so we didn't follow the exact recipe, but definitely worth a try!

Yum! I had never cooked with quinoa before and this was super easy and my whole family loved it. It was really quick to throw together after a long day at work, though I do have to admit I skipped the peppers and zucchini but added some green taco sauce to make up the flavor.

I've made this twice and love it.  I keep it cooking a lot longer for the peppers to soften and flavours to blend.   I've been feeding this to friends and it's a hit.  Better than my previous chili recipe.

Wow! This was amazing! Of course I did some tweeking. Like others instead of water I used vegetable stock to cook the quinoa. Also took other reviews advice about the "spice" factor. I used 2 jalepenos, 1.5 T of cumin. 1 T of ancho chile powder and about 1T chipotle chile powder and a couple sprinkles in the with meat. When I added everything together I also thought it was a bit thick. No problem. So I added a splash of veg stock, a can of tomatoes chili style, along with a small can of diced tomatoes that I had on hand. I added the extra tomatoes basically because we don't eat beans and I forgot the corn. Topped everything with melted cheddar cheese and cilantro and YUM! I loved the zucchini bites the most! This was delicious and a great way to incorporate all the health benefits of quinoa :) Thanks so much the recipe!

This is my new favorite chili recipe. The addition of the quinoa and the Zucchini gives it a nutritious boost and the corn, black beans, and cilantro give it a perfect southwestern taste. I added an additional can of kidney beans, and added an entire can of corn (without draining). It turned out perfect! I'm making this again soon. It was very filling and the leftovers tasted fantastic.
