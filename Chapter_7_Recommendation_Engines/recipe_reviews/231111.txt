I followed the recipe as directed and it turned out wonderful. I like my beans a little softer so I mashed them just before serving the soup. This goes great with some crusty bread.

I made this a couple of days ago. It was very nice. I left it in the fridge overnight and took some to work. Wow, nice recipe! I like it after it has had a chance to merge all the flavors. I used navy beans.
