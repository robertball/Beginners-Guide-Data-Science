Excellent!
I am so glad I found this candy recipe.
Here's an important tip I found while making this:
Don't melt your chocolate too hot, because you don't want to pour really hot chocolate over the marshmallows.
It will make it too runny. 
Make sure the chocolate is just a little warm before you pour.
It helps it to stay nice and firm.
Not gooey.
Thanks so much for the recipe, it's the best!

I thought these were fantastic! I made these with milk chocolate though, not semi sweet and I think that made a big difference.  I'm so glad I went with this recipe instead of making a fudge recipe from this site.  These are like a peanut cluster fudge.  I read one of the other reviewers comments that it did not "set" for her; but I had no such problem.  After chilling for two hours they were delicious!!  Creamy, Yummy!  I did not use marshmallows, I just added a 16oz can of Walgreens lightly salted peanuts; I thought the sweet/salty combo would be good and it is! Just the perfect taste.  Thanks for a great recipe...super easy and super delicious.  It's killing me not to eat them all and save some for Christmas cookie trays!!

These were great...I filled up two disposable pie pans instead, and they were gone in two days...between only two people! You could probably make them into drop clusters as well and press a square caramel into the centers...that's how I'm going to make it next time. =)

Outstanding treats, Saundra. I took these camping with us over the weekend. I liked one reviewer's idea about adding caramel. I didn't want the caramel to melt, so I snipped little pieces and stirred them in when the mixture was slightly cooled but not set. I also added raisins.I, too, dropped them individually onto parchment paper. The only bad thing about this recipe is that they don't last long!Thanks so much for sharing.

Tasty treats!  I'll definitely be making these again.  I used mixed nuts instead of just peanuts and I dropped heaping soonfuls on wax paper in "clusters" instead of pouring in a greased pan.  They were all eaten in a matter of minutes by my co-workers.

Although I enjoyed theses clusters, I was disappointed mine didn't harden. Did I do something wrong? I put them in the fridge and the top firmed up, but the bottom was runny. Than I put them in the freezer and they are still in there. I plan on using them to top off some ice cream at my son's 2nd birthday party.

I was very dissapointed in this recipe! I had such high hopes with the title and especially the picture. They looked like "little soft fudge candies." However, the end result was what looked like and somewhat tasted like a bowl of sticky chocolate frosting lightly coating lots of marshmallows and some nuts. The coating was way too thick and there was too many marshmallows and nuts. As a result the mixture was difficult to mix or shape into anything. Marshmallows come in 10.5 oz bags, so even using less marshmallows there still was not enough of the thick chocolate mixture to coat the ingredients. I finally stuck the mixuture in the freezer to harden it slightly. After about an hour I could scoop it into globs, but they were still quite sticky and appeared like nothing more than small piles of marshmallows completely visible and lightly mixed with some chocolate frosting. It would take at least another full bag of melted chocolate to re-dip these and turn them into actual candy!

These took what, two minutes to make?  Oh wow, they were so great!  Used milk chocolate chips, and fat free condensed milk (like it even matters).

This recipe has problems with it; my bad for not studying the whole recipe before making them!
1) Mini marshmallows come in 10.5-oz bags, not 16 oz.
2) Even using a 10.5 oz bag - 50% less than the recipe calls for -- there's way too many add-ins for the chocolate used.  There's only a small amount of chocolate to hold together all the nuts and marshmallows, and there's lots of nuts and marshmallows left over at the bottom of the bowl.  It doesn't look at all like the picture, in which everything is covered with chocolate!
3) The recipe is for "clusters" and the picture shows what looks like dropped candies, but the instructions say to pour everything into a 13 X 9 dish, which does not form clusters.  Even if you cut them apart afterwards, it won't look like the picture.

These were good, but mine didn't harden up as much as I had hoped.  I didn't have any marshmallows so I used marshmallow fluff.  Maybe that is why; it's more like a fudge than cluster.  Even though we have to eat them with a spoon (or really fast with fingers before they melt) my hubby and 3 kids enjoyed them.

Yummy. I was going to try pouring the plain chocolate over marshmallows and pretzel but it never got to pouring consistency, so I added the peanuts, spread on a plastic wrap covered cookie sheet, stuck in the fridge and called it a night.  DH's coworkers were happy to have "fudge" with peanuts instead of walnuts lol.

Yummy.  The first time I made exactly as written.  Tasted good, but not pretty.  The second time, because of some of the other reviews, I used less marshmallows and milk chocolate and it was soooo much better.

These are delicious!  Instead of pouring in baking dish, I mixed mine and dropped by spoonfuls on waxed paper.  I have tried the semi-sweet and milk chocolate -- the milk chocolate ones come out much smoother than the semi-sweet ones.  Wonderful either way!

Excellent!  The only change I made was adding melted caramels, drizzled over the top!  Got rave reviews from everyone!!!  Even those that do not particularly care for "marshmallow" stuff.  Thanks for sharing.

After reading reviews about the marshmallows making these too gooey, I decided to leave them out.  I tried a variety of nuts & pecans seemed to taste the best to me (even though I'm not really a pecan fan).  Mine never set however, in fact I have to keep them in the freezer or fridge just to be able to remove them from the parchment paper.  I was going to throw the whole batch out because I figured I wouldn't be able to give them as gifts or even plate them without a huge mess.  After letting my parents & the kids taste them, I changed my mind -everyone loved them.  They have a fudge-like consistency & great flavor!  Thanks!

Turned out great, I cut down on the marshmallows and used chopped pecans that I toasted and salted under the broiler instead of peanuts. I also added toffee bits to the marshmallow mixture.Whole family loved these!

These were easy to make and they are tastey.  I did not do mine in a pan, but made clusters of them on wax paper which turned out fine.  By the way, mine look nothing like the picture that is with the recipe.  They are "chunky" looking and you can see the marshmellows and peanuts.  I have already put these in foil cups for gift giving.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Mmmmm! I varied this a little bit-used milk chocolate chips, then added in toffee bits,raisins and pecans to the marshmallows(warning--very sweet!!!) and made them drop-cookie style onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.Turned out amazing--will be a great addition to my Christmas cookie tray this year!

Yummy! I made them into little clusters. Dropped some onto waxed paper, and some on Silpats ... they came off much easier on the waxed paper.

These just weren't what I thought they would be.  I was trying to duplicate a chocolate cookie candy that I bought recently in a bake shop.  The ones I tried had some crisp rice cereal in them as well so I cut down the nuts and marshmallows in this recipe and added 2 cups of cereal.  However - the problem was the chocolate.  It wasn't smooth and there wasn't enought to really cover the mixture. The peanuts didn't really want to get covered and stood out naked.   I used about 1/4 milk chocolate chips and 3/4 cups semi-sweet.  I dropped the clusters on waxed paper - worked ok.  I was not satisfied.

I made the Ga Ga Clusters over Christmas.  My whole family loved them!  I followed the recipe exactly but used less peanuts (1 1/2 cups instead of 2).  I'm glad I chose to reduce because I think 2 cups would have been a little too much for my taste.  I also suggest making sure the chocolate mixture is fairly warm, but not hot, when you pour it over the marshmallows.  They need to melt a bit to bond the ingredients together.  All in all, a very tasty treat.  Thanks for sharing, Saundra!

I also dropped big spoonfuls onto parchment paper instead of pressing it into a pan.  It makes a *lot* of clusters!  It's a good thing, too, otherwise they might not make it onto my Christmas goody tray!  I've already eaten half of them myself!  They're great - like Rocky Road fudge.  Yum!

Thank you so much for this delicious recipe. My 10 year old daughter made this as a "drop cookie" and won 1st place on it in our parish fair!Instead of putting it in a dish, she dropped them by spoonfuls onto a greased cookie sheet. They were so easy to make.

My daughter and I really loved these! The chocolate texture is like a creamy fudge and its not like the hardened chocolate we are used to.  I eyeballed the marshmallows and reduced the amount than called for but would probably reduce it even more and add more nuts.  I used macadamia's that came from hawaii (chopped in half) instead of peanuts because it needed to be used up.

Delicious & easy to make! I used milk chocolate chips because that's all I had on hand. Just poured it into a buttered 9x13 and after 2 hrs. in the fridge it was perfect... kids really loved it!

Super easy in the microwave (under 3 minutes)and yummy for everyone.  I made it in a microwavable bowl, combined all ingredients except the peanuts.  Microwaved the contents until the chocolate was melted.  Added the peanuts, stirred and placed in a greased pan. 2 hours in the fridge... Thank you, my daycare kids love them...

This came out with what seems like a LOT of marshmallows, and my bag was smaller than the one in the recipe.  It looks like they will mostly be chocolate covered marshmallows.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing! ;>)  I forgot to buy peanuts but I had a bag of walnuts wanting to be used so I used them and decided to give the milk chocolate/peanut butter swirl chips a try.  If the fact that I wanted to shove my face in the bowl is any indication, I think the combo will be really good.  I did use the fat free milk...whatever I can do to make myself feel better about these! :>)

It may not be fair to rate this only 3, I wish I could do a 3 1/2...I think if I made this again, I would do a better job...maybe 1/2 semisweet and 1/2 milk chocolate chips, I guess that would work.  I made 'drop' candies with this also, it did make a lot.  I had a problem with my marshmallows melting and swirling into the chocolate, I guess I just got it too hot.  I would try them again, but probably not until next Christmas.

Yummy! These are so good and simple to make. Instead of chocolate chips, I used bakers semi-sweet chocolate squares, which is basically the same. Instead of roasted nuts, I used chopped walnuts.

Easy and a good combination of flavors and a great texture.  My family couldn't get enough of these.
