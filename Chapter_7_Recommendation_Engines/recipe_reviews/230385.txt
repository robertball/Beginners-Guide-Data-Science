Followed the recipe as written and I'm not exactly sure what happened. The middle biscuits were not done. However the ones on the edge were very good. When I make these again I will probably spread them out flat (pizza style) and bake.

I made this tonight. with all the ingredients it costs plenty. I left it in the oven for 45 mins and it looked and smelled incredible. stuck the spoon in to begin serving it and ALL THE BISCUITS WERE RAW except the top layer. I wont be doing this again.

I added pepperoni inside each ball. I thought I was being creative, but it was very time consuming. The end result was a great idea however, the buscuit flavor was over powering. Next time I would try with a pizza dough.
