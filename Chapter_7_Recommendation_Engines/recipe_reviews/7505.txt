This is a nostalgic recipe in our family that has been one of my kids' favorites since they were very little--and now they're both pushing 30! I never used the nuts only because the kids didn't like them, and occasionally make this in a Bundt pan. The aroma as it's baking is wonderful, like a good comfort food should be.  It is deliciously moist with a ribbon of cinnamon and not too sweet, especially since there is only a powdered sugar glaze and not a heavy frosting. Even now when my kids come, I still make this cake---just for the memories.

I love, love, love this recipe. I can't stop eating it. I made this cake in an oven-safe plastic round cake pan. I was worried halfway through baking that it would cook too quickly on the outside, and be runny on the inside. I lowered the oven temp to 350, and baked it an extra 10 min. I also used 1/2 c. of sour cream and more cinnamon. But I know it still would have been perfect had I followed the recipe exactly. I left off the icing and it was so moist and GOOD! I also swirled the batter with a butter knife after I layered the streusle filling in the middle. I read the reviews about too much cinnamon right in the middle. I liked that change the best. It gave it an eveness. Excellent, thank you, will make it again ASAP!

I used a yellow cake mix and applesauce for the oil.  It turned out really good.  I'll be making this again.

This cake was really good. It was a little to dry for me. I think increasing the amount of oil to 1/2 cup instead of 1/3 may make up the difference. Like some others have suggested, I will swirl the cinnamon mixture into the cake instead of leaving it one layer. It tastes so good inside the cake (not overpowering at all, like I thought) that I wanted it  in every bite and not just the center. But my family loved it! Even the cake master herself (my grandmother) commented that the cake was delicious! I think I "socked-it-to-them" with this one! Happy baking everyone!

I made this as muffins. I followed the  basic recipe omitting the 1/4c added sugar in the cake batter (as if the mix doesn't contain enought sugar). I placed about a tablespoon of batter in the bottom of the paper-lined muffin pan, topped it with 2 tsp of the following streusel: 2/3c flour, 1c brown sugar 1 tbsp ground cinnamon and mixed it with 6 tbsp of melted butter. Added more batter and then another layer of streusel. I baked it for about 20-25 minutes and then when cool, drizzled it with powdered sugar icing. Excellent 'coffeecake' muffin! Moist and cinnamony. Yum!

This recipe tastes good but a little dry for me. I just increased the oil to 1/2 cup and omitted the water and increased the milk to 1/2 cup. Great! Thanks for a great old favorite. I will used it again.

My husband and I agreed that this cake was dry and the flavor was a little on the bland side.  I normally enjoy sock it to me cake but this is just not the recipe for me.

I was looking for the original Sock It To Me Cake I used to make from the side of the cake mix box.  This one is close (and very good) but it's missing something flavor wise - a tiny bit bland in some way. After some research on the original recipe, I think I'll add the 2 tsp vanilla to it next time. Also, less white sugar.  It's a bit too sweet, even for my sweet tooth, after all the brown sugar.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly!  I did have to take it out at 40 minutes instead of 45, but that may just be my oven.

I'm trying this one for the 1st time as I write this (it's actually in the oven now!). I am pleasedwith the simplicity of the ingredients but I am not pleased with the flow of the recipe on the paper. I am going to have to rewrite this one so I am adding the right ingredients at the right time. I can't wait to taste this cake!

THIS CAKE IS SO AWESOME! I HAD LOST MY RECIPE FOR SOCK IT TO ME CAKE, AND SO GLAD I FOUND THIS ONE. I FOLLOWED ADVICE OF PREVIOUS REVIEWERS, SWIRLING THE FILLING THRU THE CAKE WITH A BUTTER KNIFE INSTEAD OF HAVING IT IN ONE BIG LAYER. AND I LOWERED THE TEMP ON THE OVEN TOWARDS THE END TO 350. INSTEAD OF USING THE DRIZZLE FOR ICING, I MAKE MY OWN HOMEMADE CREAM CHEESE ICING, WHICH YOU CAN FIND ON HERE, THERE ARE MANY RECIPES FOR IT. USING A LIGHT CREAM CHEESE FROSTING REALLY MAKES THIS CAKE A TREAT!!  YUMMO!

This desert was a family favorite back in the '60s and I began sharing this version with friends recently.  I have altered it a bit  by including more brown sugar and pecans in the swirl.  I also only use 3/4 cup of sour cream and use Condensed Milk  for the remainder 1/4 cup and a little Mexican Vanilla to give the cake a bit more sweetness.   I also glaze pecan halves and place them on the top of the cake for decoration on the wider slices of the bundt.  Enjoy!

This was a great recipe; extremely popular at work! I made it just as written, and I found a bonus for the filling. In the grocery aisle with the ice cream toppings, I found a can of cinnamon coated pecan chips.  I used those in my filling in place of plain pecans, along with all other ingredients called for.  The result was a cake that tasted like a cinnamon roll.  I also did a little swirling of the batter after it was all in the pan, just a butter knife back and forth.  I may try cream cheese frosting next time to enhance the similarity to a cinnamon roll.

OMG this cake turned out absolutely delicious it was simple to make and baked perfectly, the only thing I changed was the glaze I added more of a cream cheese icing glaze is that recipes glaze was a little too powder sugary for me. I will make this again for sure! I did add 1/2 cup of oil as others suggested, I used butter pecan cake mix and also swirled the mix instead of leaving it in the middle. It was very tasty!

Overall, this was a good cake.  I followed the recipe to the letter, but it still came out a little dry for me.  I will definitely try again but with a few adjustments.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I omitted the nuts and I added a little extra cinnamon to the cake mix.  I also dusted the pan with a cinnamon/ sugar mixture first. (I got that idea from the recipe for  Banana Sour CreamBread found on this site.) I also doubled the cinnamon/brown sugar mix for the middle.  This will be a definite keeper!

Sock it to Me Cake III. Easy and good coffee cake. I followed recipe exactly, I baked it at 375 for 50 minutes and I think 45 min. would have been long enough. I have one of the newest heavy Nordic Ware Bundt pans with a swirl design and it makes a beautiful presentation for brunches or potlucks.

Sorry, I followed the instructions to the letter and I was very disappointed with the outcome of this recipe.   I know good cake, and in my opinion, this cake was a complete failure.   Even though I generously greased the bundt pan I used because I already knew that sometimes cakes with filings that include brown sugar can sometimes stick to the pan.   I cooled the cake 25 mins. as directed and the cake, with it's hard shell top was securely stuck to the pan.  I carefully tried to use a flexible knife to unstick the cake.  When I thought I had freed the cake, I turned it over and it was still stuck.  I had to pound the pan against the counter to get it out.   It fell apart.   If that wasn't enough, the instructions said to bake at 375 degrees, for 45-55 mins. I left it unbothered for the minimum 45 mins.  The cake really appeared overcooked with a dark hard shell on top, securely melded to the Teflon bundt pan.   The cake was on the dry side to me.   I recently had a friend's Sock It To Me Cake, and hers was much better.   Even though I finely chopped the pecans as directed, to me the amount of 1cup was too much.   I was very careful to follow the instructions but it didn't turn out well.  Nothing is more disappointing to me than to follow a cake recipe carefully and for it to fail.  All my ingredients were fresh, so I really don't know what was wrong. I even have a relatively new oven.

This is a great sock it to me cake recipe. Was easy to make. The only thing I did differently was add vanilla flavor. Mmy family loved it and it took me back down memory lane.when I was a child we would visit the south for our family reunions and this was always my cake.

This recipe was good.  The batter tasted good.  The flavor of the cake was very good but the problem was the cook time.  45-55 minutes is way too long.  I took mine out at 42 minutes and it was burned.  This was disappointing since there was no indication it was being overcooked (no burning smell while baking).  The outside was very dark and hard but the inside was a moist delicious cake,  didn't bother icing it since outside was ruined but I still ate it.  If you make this recipe I would start watching the oven to take it out around 30 minutes.  I would make again, with adjustments to cook time.

I followed this recipe exactly.  I used a Pilsbury Butter Cake mix and also added a little butter extract.  Some of the other cooks stated that the cinnamon was too strong in the center, so I decided to swirl this through o even out both the taste and texture.  Very quick and simple cake.  Thank you for sharing.

My guests raved about how good this tasted, but for me as a baker it was a little too dry although it was moist. Next time I will increase the oil to 1/2 cup.

I can't imagine a better version. This was perfect. It's just the right sweetness and is so moist.  Mine didn't need to bake the whole time. I took it out 5 minutes early.

This was fantastic, everybody loved it.  I substituted vanilla yogurt for the sour cream because I didn't have any at the time and it was still great.  The only thing I think I will change when I make it in the future is to decrease the cinnamon a bit.  I love cinnamon but to have that much in one small area was a bit too much.

My husband voted this cake to be one of the top 3 of his favorite cakes. Delicious only thing it spilled over and went flat. Didn't even need the glaze. Making it again only this time no kids quiet house and not opening oven until closer to the time.

This is the traditional recipe for Sock it to Me cake. I made it exactly according to directions, but checked it after 35 minutes. So glad I did because it was ready to come out of the oven then. I think over-baking is causing some of the complaints of a dry cake. Thank you for the recipe!

This cake is rather dry and the taste is not quite right. I made it according to recipe but if use this recipe again I will definitely make some changes to make it moister. Probably decrease temperature to 350 and add a little more milk.

Made this cake in place of pie for thanksgiving dinner.  After reading the reviews about it being dry I upped the sour cream to 1.5 cups.  
After eating it, I will double the brown sugar and cinnamon for the filling as I found it to be a little lacking, and will only use 1 tablespoon of milk for the glaze as most of it ended up in the bottom of the cake server.  Having said all that, my family and I loved it! 
I might have started a new tradition for the holiday, Thanksgiving Cake!

Recipe said to bake it 45-50 minutes and even though my oven usually cooks on the slow side the outside burned after only 40 minutes.  The inside was still good though.

I substituted greek yogurt for the sour cream. This cake was good, but 45 minutes was too long. Next time, I will check for doneness at the 35 minute mark.

A little disappointed in the directions. ...says to use a box of butter recipe cake mix,  but doesn't say if you follow the box directions then add the other stuff. ..my box calls for 3 eggs and 1/3 stick of butter, this recipe calls for 4 eggs and 1/3 C of vegetable oil. ..not consistent or good directions at all. ...we will see how it tastes.

I read all the reviews and modified the following...
I used 1/2 cup of Canola oil since that's what I had on hand and
I added 1 tsp of Almond extract.  OMG!  This was a moist and flavorful cake.  Absolutely fabulous.  Thank you Becky!

I just baked this cake using yellow cake instead of butter, and walnuts instead of pecans because that is what I had on hand.The only reason for the 4 stars is the glaze. In the pic it looks wonderful, but when I mixed it up, it just didnt taste that good...too much of that powdered sugar taste that I just dont like too much.

I had a craving for cake tonight, and this filled it!  It was so good!  I used yellow cake mix because that's all I had, and omitted the pecans (didn't have any).  Very good.

Great cake! Made it last night, and was a little suprised how dark the outer layer turned but I was pleasantly surprised with a moist and fluffy piece. I did omit the glaze. I think it is even better this morning.

I have to say this cake was outstanding my wife hates cinnamon but she loved this cake  I can't really say it's the best I ever had      
because I only got to eat one piece the rest she hid it from me and ate it all

This wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  Kinda everyday.
