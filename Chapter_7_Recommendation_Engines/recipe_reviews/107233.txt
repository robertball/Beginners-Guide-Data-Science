I used  bacon flavored Spam and it came out great! I used more cheese than the recipe called for, next time I won't put so much on top. It  was a bit too much. Also it would be really good with flavored diced tomatoes (maybe with green chile or jalapeno) and some jack cheese instead or in addition too. Overall, will definitely make again.

I used a 10 oz. can of diced tomatoes with green chilies and 8 oz of regular greek yogurt.  I like the idea of this casserole, but the flavor was not to my liking.  I guess I'm just not a big Spam fan.  Next time I will try it with bacon instead and regular diced tomatoes.

This shocked me! It was really quite tasty. I was originally put off by the SPAM idea, but was able to "lighten" this up a bit, to about 220 calories for a decently sized portion. I used 2% milk cheddar cheese, fat free plain yogurt, and turkey SPAM instead of regular SPAM. Also, I had fresh tomatoes on hand so I diced those up instead of using canned, and just microwaved my grits because I had a few packets in the pantry. I would make this again but my husband wasn't even interested in trying it. He said he was put off by the look of it.

My family enjoyed this.  I made it exactly as the recipe was written.  I think next time I will use a little less cheese and a little more spam.  Or perhaps just add a little bacon.

I had not bought a can of spam in 20+ years, but I had some grits I needed to use and and wanted to try something new, and this popped up.  Gotta say - I was pleasantly surprised.  Who woulda thunk to grate spam? It was very good, and the recipe is easy to tweak to your personal tastes or other ingredients you want to use up.  Go for it!

I made it. I didn't have quite enough cheddar cheese so I used American in the casserole and sprinkled about 3/4 cup of shredded cheddar on top. I wasn't crazy about the spam, next time I'll use cubed cooked ham instead. Oh yeah, I added butter and a little sprinkle of garlic powder and paprika because that's how I make my grits.

This is a great new casserole that I have added to my recipe box.  It's always good to have another good recipe.
