This cake is to die for !   It's a mix of banana bread & coffee cake. WOW! So moist, I can't stop eating it...
  I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only difference in mine was I used regular sugar and regular flour~I like the Wheat Montana flour so much better than the popular brands. 
 I used a bunt pan. I sprayed the pan and put the pecan mixture in then the cake batter on top and cooked it for 45min. I think it could have finished baking in about 40min.
 Thanks for an awesome recipe.

Great recipe, it allows you to make subtle changes and still comes out fantastic. I followed recipe except didn't quite have 1 cup of ripe mashed bananas-so I mixed in 1/2 cup applesauce to the bananas, and I used 1/4 cup brown sugar in with the superfine white sugar and I had no nuts so I added about 1/4 cup of chopped dates instead for the topping. It came out great!! Really moist and very tasty...not at all like a dry banana bread. I will definitely make again.

I love banana bread and coffee cake so combining the two was like heaven to me. I didn't have pecans so I substituted almonds and it still tasted good. Add to my archives of favorites

Excellent coffee cake. Took to the office today and it was a big hit. Followed the directions as written. Didn't take 45 minutes to bake so you should start checking it at 35 minutes to avoid over baking. Definitely a keeper!

This is a good recipe. I had to substitute yogurt for the sour cream because I didn't have any on hand, but other than that I made it as written. I think when I make it again I will cut the sugar down by at least 1/4 cup, depending on how ripe the bananas are. It was a little sweet for my taste. My husband loved it!

Moist cake with nice banana flavor, will definitely make this again. The trick is using very ripe bananas for best flavor. Delicious!!!

Great coffee cake!  Very easy to make and very tasty results.  Turned out I didn't have as many chopped pecans as I thought.  Instead I used a combination of chopped pecans, chopped hazelnuts and dried cranberries for the topping, which ended up being a great alternative.

Light, fluffy coffeecake. I added 1 chopped cooked apple since I didn't have sour cream and it came out great. My hubby is in love with it.

Loved it!  Very moist and delicious.  I have an allergy to cow's milk, so I substituted margarine for the butter, and substituted goat milk for the sour cream.  Came out beautifully.

Next time I make it I will probably reserve some of the batter to drizzle over the top of the topping before baking, to give it more of a swirly appearance.

Wonderful!  We use walnuts and about 10 times as much brown sugar and make a lot of topping.  It gets more moist every day!

YUM!  I doubled this recipe using regular sugar as opposed to superfine sugar.  This made a lot more batter than 2-9x9 pans.  So instead I got 3 pans worth of coffee cake.  Two of the 9x9 size and one smaller round pan.  It worked perfectly as I gave away 2 of the pans.  I made 2 with the pecans and 1 without for my son.  When I spread the pecans on the batter before baking, they were all around the pan, include the edge.  As the cake baked, the pecans gravitated toward the center of the pan.  It did not effect the taste of the coffeecake, just the appearance, a little bit.  This was a nice, moist coffeecake that everyone enjoyed.

This recipe makes a lovely coffee cake.  I used the recipe as written except that I used walnuts instead of pecans, since that was what was on hand.  It's got a nice banana flavor with a much lighter texture than most banana bread recipes.  One note of caution - even using an 8" square pan (again, what I had on hand), it only took about 30 minutes to bake, not 45.  Keep an eye on it in your own oven.

The house smells wonderful, the cake is moist and oh so yummy! I bring it to church to share and it always gets gobbled up! My daughter and I made muffins out of the mix this go around. The only thing I changed was the amount of time to cook which is 35 min instead of 45 for the cake. They are perfect! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Great cake! I did tweak it a tad by using less sugar & also substituting half of the butter with unsweetened applesauce. I had to use walnuts because pecans weren't available in my pantry. Also used yogurt instead of sour cream like another reviewer said because we rarely eat sour cream. Thanks for sharing, MissKL!

I made this cake twice and It's delicious. I did exactly what it says in recipe. Only changed pecans to walnuts on the second time. Both were really good. It's a moist cake and is not too sweet.

The only change I made was to use regular all purpose flour in place of cake flour. Excellent taste. Moist and crunchy nuts. Great for a girls lunch or dessert for the family.

Wow!!  I added 1/4 cup extra banana, 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon,and a dash of salt to the batter.  Toasted the pecans. Swirled a bit of the topping into the bread.  This was a hit. No leftovers. Will double the recipe next time.

I personally didn't care for this but my family raved about it. I found the banana flavour overpowering although it could have been my bananas. The only changes I made was I substituted the sour cream for vanilla greek yogurt and used  regular sugar instead of super fine as that's what I had. my biggest issue with this recipe is that it is written in such a way that it makes the process more complicated than it has to be. I'm sure the two bowl method or the creaming method would have produced just as good results with way less effort. Probably will not make again.

Great recipe!  My end result tasted great, but my mistake was trying to bake it in the toaster oven.  My nut topping burned while the cake was still batter in the middle.  I scraped off the burnt topping, replaced it with a basic cinnamon crumb topping and finished it off in the oven!  I may reduce the sugar a bit next time.  Might even bake it in muffin cups, but I will definitely NOT attempt to make it in the toaster oven!  Lol!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good, but watch the bake time.  I followed the recipe exactly as written except I only baked 35 min... and it was over baked.... My oven temp is accurate so next time I will watch the oven closely... I think 30 min. or less would be the correct time.. Thank you for sharing...

Delicious change from banana bread.  We often have left over bananas but the family is tired of banana bread and since I moved and lost my favorite banana bread recipe I have been looking for something new .  This was easy and delicious and I highly recommend trying it.  I doubt this will last 24 hours in this house.  Followed the recipe exactly as written.

Pretty good! Nice and moist. I made some substitution based on what I had: margarine for butter, Greek yogurt for sour cream, and I drizzled some melted margarine over the topping. Bake time was 40min. My family liked it. Tasted like rich banana bread w a crunchy top.

Turned out great and very easy to make! I will definitely be making this again. Only thing I changed was I used regular flour because I didn't have cake flour.

Good recipe.  I had no  nuts on hand,  besides,  they tend to  be a bit pricey.  So to add texture and crunch  I used shredded,  unsweetened coconut  ( specialty section of grocery stores ),  and  unseasoned Panko bread crumbs  (to total of pecans called for).   Nice and pretty. Will add an additional 1/2 cup of banana  next time.

Made this following the recipe exactly.  Very moist and easy to make.  I gave this four stars only because I feel the topping could be better.  I think I will try this without the topping next time.  Thanks for sharing.

This was very tasty and my fiancée loved it with coffee as an afternoon snack. I made the following substitutions to cut back on the artificial sweeteners since baking anything with banana already has a sweet boost--used 3/4 cup regular white sugar in batter; light sour cream; 1 cup regular white and 1/2 cup whole wheat regular flour, and for topping 1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar. Also, for one cup mashed banana, I found that two small bananas filled out one cup exactly. I baked for 45 minutes and it came out browned a bit on top and moist on the inside. After tasting, I think it could use the additional 1/4 cup sugar and maybe an additional 1/4 cup sour cream. Though it was moist, I found the cake a bit heavy tasting, true "cake" taste and consistency. (I'm comparing it to the taste of fruit loaves, like banana and carrot nut breads--those are denser, but more rich with flavor of the fruits because they have a more equal ratio of fruit to flour). This coffee cake is a true coffee cake--a great gift for brunch, a light snack, and for a mini dessert treat.

'Using my mad math skills ;) I put this in an 8x11 glass dish; done in 35.  Nut allergy so went with an oat topping:  3/4c oats, 3T melted butter,  1/4c brown sugar, 1/2t cinnamon.  This would've overflowed in an 8x8 so don't do it - unless you're into cleaning your oven.  'Only thing - & it's not bad, just different - is that this dimpled.  There are four - five dimples.  Odd.  I smoothed it before baking.  Oh, well.  Maybe with glass, the oven temp should be lower.  A moist cake that isn't as light as most cakes, but lighter than most coffeecakes; not heavy or dense either, still soft.  'Feel free to read that one again!  :D  The oat topping, not reflected in the rating, was okay; but I doubt I'll use it again.  Days later:  I don't know why this isn't gone.  It's good, but I'm the only one eating it.  'Think this might be a better lighttextured banana bread - put it in a couple loaf pans.  No biggie.  Maybe the oat topping is scaring them.  :o

HIGHLY RECOMMEND! This is a fantastic recipe.  I didn't have cake flour, so I did the cornstarch and all-purpose flour trick.  This cake was so light and moist.  It's now one of my favorite recipes.

This is amazing! Used a bundt pan and replaced the sour cream with 2% Greek yogurt. Because that's what I had. Perfectly fluffy and substantial at the same time. Bundt pan creates a nut crunchy bottom with the brown sugar topping. Used slivered almonds twice, pecans once and walnut another time. Great, great method.

not enough banana flavor.  Next time I will add some banana flavoring to make up for the lack of banana goodness.

Good recipe,  but more of a bread than a cake and I'd have then streusel in the middle of the cake rather than on top and put a cinnamon drizzle on the top.

WOW!!  Loved this.  I don't like frosting or high sugary things for breakfast and this is PERFECT!  I didn't have applesauce or sour cream so I used cottage cheese and it was Wonderful.  I used plain sugar and plain flour, 3 ripe bananas,  doubled the recipe and baked in 9x13 for 50min. All other reviews are extremely accurate!  I will definitely be making this again with my black bananas in the freezer!
