What a wonderful combination of salmon,pasta, and exquisite ingedrients.  I think the measured amounts of the combined ingredients makes this recipe work, it savors the palate.  The taste is lasting and makes a flavor statement.  Try it yourself and see what I am saying about the satisfying taste.   Good job Holly    
And this is called a salad!!!!!

Because I didn't have some of the ingredients in the house that I thought I had, I changed the recipe just a bit, substituting the blue cheese dressing with a light olive oil Italian dressing, and adding some capers and dill. I also used feta cheese and mixed it and the other ingredients throughout the pasta instead of just topping it. Yum!

This salad had a great combination of ingredients and a nice flavor. We tried it with blue cheese dressing and it was just "okay" but when we used italian dressing it was excellent. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Delicious and beautiful presentation. This is perfect for a light dinner. I made a few changes.  I added some imitation crabmeat and avocado. Just as yummy.

I took this to a BBQ on the 4th of July and it was a hit!  I added a little dill to give it more flavor. Very good!

I seasoned the vegetables before I added them to the pasta. I also doubled the recipe. It tastes even better the next day.

My family really liked this! I was surprised that even the youngest ate it. I'd like it more with extra peppers and tomato. I also added extra chunks of Bleu Cheese and mixed it all together instead of just layering it. I'll make this again for sure and might add olives

OK, but heavy using pasta. Will change to spinach for a lighter salad & use more tomato, cuc & red pepper. We used Roasted Red Pepper with Parmesan dressing & feta cheese. The feta gave it a much needed flavor. My husband smoked a piece of salmon & it was wonderful in the salad.

This was just ok for us.  Apart, we like all the ingredients in this salad, but together it was just ok.  I did try half with the blue cheese and half with the Italian dressing and preferred the Italian over the blue cheese.  I thought the blue cheese dressing was to heavy and rich for the salmon.  Thanks for sharing befg.

Yum!  I followed the recipe as closely as my pantry allowed, but had to substitute sundried tomatoes in oil for the fresh tomatoes.  Used coarsely grated blue cheese with oil and red wine vinegar.  Added chopped Vidalia onion.  The flavors balance nicely. This is a recipe that can take some tinkering to suit individual tastes.

I followed the recipe exactly using homemade smoked salmon-- I think if I make it again, I will try substituting Italian dressing for the blue cheese. The pasta needed a little more flavor & i think that would do the trick. As is, still good though.

I used Zesty Italian dressing and threw some lemon pepper on the salmon, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  My boyfriend, who generally hates vegetables, salads, healthy stuff, etc, even loved this dish.  Salmon is always so filling to me for some reason...I think that's why it goes so well with vegetables, as opposed to an equally as filling side dish or something.  Thanks for the recipe!
