I am only going to comment on the filling since I used my own pastry for this recipe.  I prepared the filling according to the dircections.  However, when I make these cookies again, I will not pre-cook the filling.  Doing so can make the filling too hard/chewy in the even that the cookies over bake, and it is easy to over bake these so watch carefully.  When I make these again I will simply combine the ingredients and fill as per the recipe directions.  Do not be tempted to use more than the specified amount of filling or the filling will bubble out of the muffin cups as the cookies bake.  I also feel the filling could benefit from some flavoring.  I added 1 1/2 teaspoons dark rum and 3/4 teaspoon vanilla.  The addition of these 2 ingredients really made for some delicious cookies.  With some changes, this is a very tasty cookie that is certainly worth making.

Other reviews said the filling was missing something, so I looked at a pecan pie recipe.  Substituted brown sugar for the confectioners sugar.  It is so good!  Don't cook the filling either- that turns it to candy.  Just melt the butter and stir in the brown sugar until it is dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in the corn syrup and pecans.  Doesn't even need cooled in the fridge. Will be proudly sharing these at a cookie exchange soon!

these are very good and would make them again. I used miniature muffin cup pan. A tip would be to make sure there is a good amount of dough on the bottom when shaped in the pan.

After reading through some of the previous reviews, I made some adjustments; I used the mini cupcake pan and for the filling instead of the confectioners sugar I used the dark brown sugar and added about a teaspoon of vanilla (just a smidge more). I also added a bit more pecans. I also only warmed the filling until the butter was melted. They turned out fantastic. My pickiest of eaters couldn't eat enough. Will definitely make again!

These cookies tasted OK, but the filling was way too hard and sticky prepared as directed. I think the problem is in the amount of time it was boiled before being put in the cookie crust. When I took it out if the frdge after cooling it was like a rock and I had to microwave it to be able to get pieces off. Thanks anyway.

Yummy, beautiful and easy! I will be making these A LOT.  Double the filling. It's not quite enough. I ended up filling half of the shells with cherry pie filling. Those were also very tasty.

I made the mistake of not using the cupcake tin, but instead rolled them into little balls and making the thumbprint.  The "pies" turned out flat like cookies, but were still very yummy and had a great texture.  I also used 2 tsp of vanilla instead of one for more flavor.  my family and I had to restrain ourselves from eating it before it was baked ;D Thanks!

This is pretty good, I like the crust because its sweeter then most but the filling needs some tweaking I think. All in all thought its pretty good and I will make it again.

These are good. Sticky, crunchy nuts in the middle of a nice sugar cookie. These are cookies not tarts or mini pies so the outside does not taste like a pie crust. I did not boil the filling just melted the ingredients together. Made them in a mini muffin pan. Filled the well to the top with the filling but after baking most settled and came out looking only half full. They are stick in your teeth good.

My husband and I really liked them.  I halved the recipe since there's only two of us and came out with 10 cookies.  I also added some cinnamon to the cookie mix.  I give it 4stars because the pecan filling came out too hard.  Still have to figure out how to make it more chewy.

Oh.My.Gosh.  These mini pies are AMAZING! They are a family hit and I'm definitely making them again.  To make it a little healthier, I used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat and reduced the amount of butter by a couple tablespoons for the batter. Not chewy at all, very soft and sweet. I recommend this to anyone looking to satisfy a sweet tooth.

These are so yummy! They're fairly quick and easy too. I may have a new favourite cookie. I Canadianed them up a bit with maple syrup rather than corn syrup and added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to the crust but otherwise followed the recipe. Be careful not to overfill them, they boiled over a little, though it kind of acted as a glaze on the top of the crust so it was no big deal but if they'd been a little more full, it could have been messy. Make sure to watch the time as they bake quickly and I found they were perfect after only 9-10 minutes (though I tend to like things lightly baked).

The crust is more like a soft cookie, not really a pie crust.  They fell apart taking them out of the pan.  Did not taste like a pecan pie either.  I was very disappointed.

Good luck, if you try this! It takes a better cook than I. They sound so tempting, but are a world of work, and then, impossible to get out of the tins without falling apart. Oh, you can eat it - they just won't look pretty. And, if you DO try, make sure to add a pinch of salt!

Always use min cup cake pan and do NOT cook the filling just mix and DO add some flavor to it, like Almond extract or Vanilla or Rum extract. I used bread flour too. Also watched real close. Thanks !!

SO easy and delicious! I made them for friends for the derby and they were a hit! I omitted the corn syrup and added a little coconut rum and vanilla to the nut mix, and in the fill part i put some dark chocolate chips. The cookie base is delicious- you could probably experiment with a lot of different fillings! I also used a mini cupcake pan and it worked really well. I will be making these again for sure!

Very yummy cookies. Good tip is to use a small melon baler to scoop out the perfect amount of dough. This also helps to keep them all the same size.

These are really tasty. I added a Tablespoon of molasses into the sugar/nut mixture to make it taste more like pecan pie. If you don't eat them while they're still warm I recommend microwaving them for 10 seconds to make the center a bit gooey.

The filling was delicious but I tried this recipe twice and my dough was very sticky. I could not work with it at all, I had to spoon it into the muffin cups. Any suggestions?

I halved the recipe then followed others suggestions. I used a mini cupcake tin. It made 23, argh, one short. 
For filling: Substituted brown sugar for the confectioners sugar. Did not boil filling so as to avoid making hard candy.  Only melted butter and (brown) sugar just until melted then removed from the heat and added other ingredients but also added 1 tsp vanilla extract to mixture as suggested. Did not refrigerate since I didn’t boil it. Anyway it cooled quite enough while I prepared the cookie. 
For the cookie: no changes made
Using a melon baller to fill made it easy!
Cleanup was super clean. Absolutely no worries that the sticky ingredients would leave hard to scrape residual on my pans. Really happy about that! Not exactly sure why people substituted brown sugar for confectioners sugar in the filling. So, just out of pure curiosity,  I may make these again using confectioners sugar and compare the difference.

I love this recipe for several reasons.  It converts well to gluten free using Bob's Red Mill 1-to-1 flour.  The cookies look fancy but are really easy to make and they freeze well.  Getting them out of the pan can be a bit tricky.  If I'm feeling lazy, I'll  just use cupcake liners that peel right off after baking.

I made these for a bake sale and for my husband who loooooooooooves pecan pie.  he prefers the pie because he's used to it.  I don't mind this and I hate the pie.  Little notes: use dark brown sugar in the filling instead of confectioners as it adds a nice flavor.  I didn't boil and refrigerate it as many people said that made the filling hard as a rock.  Mine came out very nice.  More nut than sugar mix and that's why i liked it more than the pie.  The cookie part is good all by itself which is a hidden bonus as you need to double the filling to have enough for the cookies.  I used paper lines in my cupcake pan for easy cleanup and sale, but I think the amount of butter makes it unnecessary if you want.  Overall, very good.  keeping this one for the southerners who like cookies.

These cookies are incredibly delicious!!!!!!!!! My family loved them and I couldn't stop eating them. 1 tip I have: use mini muffins tins and a cookie scooper for the cookie dough. Both are the perfect size for making these tassie cookies.

Made these to go in my Christmas cookie tin I gave to neighbors each year. Had a few leftover for my Christmas gathering with friends - they were delicious!  I was surprised how quickly they baked in the oven - 11 minutes. I made these to look more like pecan tarts, only problem is there wasn't enough filling (4 short). If you go this route, be sure to boost the filling ingredients slightly. I highly recommend these 
!

I made this as written. I found the cookies/tarts to not have enough filling and the shortbread was more grainy  than my other shortbread recipes. I won't be making this one again. If you choose to make these I would recommend adding more filling.

These disappeared very fast at a family gathering. I will definitely makes them again, but I think I’d drop in a couple of raisins into the cups before I add the filling.  De-lish!

The pecan pie cookies are very good.  I baked them in small cupcake pans instead of regular size cupcake pans and my family loved them.

Definitely need to use a mini cupcake pan to get the pie effect. Using a cupcake pan made them a bit flat. I didn't experience the hard candy-like texture of the pecan mixture like other reviewers noted. I would make these again even without a mini pan.

I’m giving this recipe five stars for flavor and possible user error. I made the changes others did ( brown sugar instead of confectioners sugar and I didn’t cook the filling) But I used a mini- muffin pan and I couldn’t get the mini pies out without them breaking. I do plan to try this recipe again and use my regular muffin pan to make thinner pies and see if that works better. The flavor was so good I want to make these cookies look nice enough to serve company

I just had margarine to make this and the consistency ended up being so liquid. Had a good result buts is more like a mashed thing. So I made 3 batches, 1 with more flour and another one with oats too. They ended up being ready but good.

Too much crust and not enough filling. I think the recipe expects you to use mini-muffin pans (maybe??) but does not specify. Either do that or half the crust/double the filling. I would like to try this again with proper ratios. The version I made had the crust overwhelm (i.e. close around the filling) on some cookies.

This recipe is very good. I only had one qualm with it: the dough stuck to the pan. As for the ingredients themselves, I added vanilla to the pecan filling and did not bring the mix to boil. The filling was delicious and gooey not hard like candy after baking. Definitely don't boil the filling mixture. Let it finish its cooking in the oven. The flavor was fantastic. Will make it again however I made a batch with mini cupcake cups at the bottom. I highly recommend it to prevent the mini pies from sticking to the pan. In mini muffin pans, the yield can be up to 34 mini pies!

I made these cookies today. i added 1/4 cup extra of flour because the dough was sticky. I also added 1 1/2 teaspoons of rum flavor and I didn't cook the filling. The cookies came out pretty good after I made the adjustments. I also used brown sugar  instead of the confectioner's sugar and added salt to the filling.

So good,  was a hit a Christmas, I made the recipe twice because they went so fast. Cookie part is delicious, bakes up  firm enough to hold filling, but still tender. Try it, you will absolutely enjoy it.

Didn't change anything but I did learn to let them cool completely in the muffin tin before turning them out. Until I did that the bottom tore out of the warm cookies.

Very good cookie!  I didn't put them in a cupcake pan. I just made balls and put them on a cookie sheet. Made a depression and put the pecan mixture in. They worked out great!

I would definitely put cinnamon or nutmeg in the pecan mixture next time I make them. The pecan mixture seems just a bit bland.

I will definitely make them again! I like the softness of the cookie. They're not hard like some cookies are.

These were easy but I wasn’t wowed by the crust.  I used the mini muffin pans and like these better.  I will make again but maybe add a little salt to my dough.  The key to getting them out is 5 min in the pan and then cool on rack.

This recipe was a disaster. Not one of the cookies came out of the pan in one piece!!  The dough was sticky like there wasn’t enough flour and the filling was awful. I wasted 2 hours and about $20 of supplies, including some pricey pecans. I will not be making this recipe again

I made this recipe as is except for adding rum and vanilla to the filling and as suggested, I did not cook it. These things were really good. I think without the rum and vanilla it would have been pretty plain.

I am torn between 3 and 4 stars. Like most everyone here, I had to modify this recipe. The recipe name should be changed to Pecan Tarts because they are not cookies. I chose to use two mini-muffin/tart pans that hold 24 individual pieces. That was a good choice. I agree 100% with NOT cooking the filling because it gets too hard. I purchased several frozen pie crusts and thawed them. I did not want all that sugar in the crust! I used brown sugar for the filling, not confectioners sugar; however, after they were cooked, I sprinkled confectioners powdered sugar on them for a festive look. They were delicious which is why I gave them 4 stars, but way too labor intensive (3 stars). One hint is that I used an appropriate-sized water glass to punch out perfect-shaped circles for the dough, then eased each circle of dough into the muffin tins. They looked perfect, but way too much work!

I followed the advice of others and did not cook the filling. I used brown sugar in place of confectioners sugar in the filling. I split the light corn syrup with dark corn syrup and added cinnamon to add richness to the flavor. Also, I toasted the pecans prior to chopping and adding to the mix. I used the dough recipe as submitted. I pressed the dough into mini muffin tins without utilizing liners. They were fairly easy to remove from the greased pans.

These were delicious. I listened to the recommendations of other reviews and they were very helpful. Didn't cook the filling (Just melt the butter and stir in the brown sugar until it is dissolved. Remove from heat and stir in the corn syrup and pecans. ).  I also used brown sugar instead of the confectioners sugar. I tried both minimuffin and regular muffin trays and both came out fine (I preferred the regular muffin trays slightly). Was careful not to overcook (stuck to 10-11 min).

I made a test batch this morning using the hint to not boil the topping mixture.  That was a good call.  I did find getting them to come out of the tin and not mutilate the cookie  quite challenging.   So my solution was to use cupcake wrappers.  This made fluted crust edges and made removal a breeze.  I ended up making four more batches.  I’ll add these to my annual cookie bake.

These came out great!  I took some of the recommendations and used a mini muffin tin.  Added a bit of bourbon and vanilla to the filling and substituted brown sugar for confectioners, and added a 1/4 tsp and some cinnamon and nutmeg to the dough.  The filling ran out so I improvised with some other fillings at the end.  Looking forward to taking these to my cookie exchange!

This is a very easy to follow recipe. I think I left the filling in the fridge for too long so it was completely set like a toffee so I was unable to spoon the filling into the crust. Do watch them carefully as mine were more than done after 10 minutes.

4 1/2 stars, these are delicious little pecan pies!  Pecan mixture does get a bit hard to work with once in fridge so I would suggest to put it in just to cool it down. I used a  mini cupcake tin to form cookie base which worked really well Yummo!

As someone already stated once you let the filling cool you have the consistency of peanut brittle, really hard. I put my filling in the microwave until I could stir it easily (not hot) and added one egg to the mixture. The filling was more like the filling of a pecan pie. It baked beautifully! I will make them again but will add one egg to the filling once it is cool but not refrigerated and bake as usual

The batter and the filling amounts matched to completion.  I added a 1/2 t salt to both the batter and filling. In addition to the vanilla flavor, I added the same amount of rum flavor.  Thirteen minutes bake time was good, but the pies had to cool completely in the mini-cup tin on a rack or they would fall apart.  This meant that unless there are two pans, one has to wait to complete the batch.  It also took a bit of practice to release them.  They went straight from the pan to the plate without a “part two” cooling on a rack. The recipe made 37 pies. I will make these again; took less time and finesse for this baker.

Fantastic recipe! I made it exactly like it is and everyone loved it! I left half of the batch as is and the other half I dipped in a mixture of semi sweet and milk chocolate and they tasted even better! My sister and my mom  have asked me to make more. This recipe is a keeper!

Not a perfect recipe, it doesn't have the depth of flavour an actual pecan pie has but it's nice none the less. It's good for bringing to a meal or giving as a gift since it's a little different and stands out.

Cookies taste great and the filling really smelled like pecan pie! However, I found them a little finnicky in that it was hard to get the filling in just right and often the filling would bake over the cookie, making it look messy. They needed to be completely cooled almost before taking them out of the pan otherwise they would fall apart (I may have made the pockets too deep). I also made a few changes to the recipe based on other reviews:
Filling:
Added 1 Tbsp molasses to filling
Used half confectioner's sugar/half brown sugar in filling
Did not boil the filling
Added 1 tsp cinnamon to filling

Dough:
Added a little almond extract (this is personal preference)

I made a couple of changes after having trouble getting them out of the pans (tried it twice).  I used my mini cheesecake pans and they worked well.  I pushed the dough about halfway up the sides.  I also substituted dark karo syrup for the light and it has a better flavor.  I baked them about  15 minutes instead of 13 (I was using dark pans so lowered the temp to 325).  I didn't refrigerate the filling but just let it sit until thick and cool.

It was good, but needed salt in the dough.
