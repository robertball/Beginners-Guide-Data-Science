i use this recipe at home except i only use 1 3/4 cup sugar, 1 cup pb, and melted hershey bars (about 1 lb) i also melt the pb because if you put it on and try to spread it on the hot cake sometimes it will tear the cake. 30 seconds in the microwave and a stir and it goes on fast and easy. you will NOT be disappointed with these--better than the tastycake brand!

This is an absolute hit everywhere I take it!! It is enjoyed by both adults and children. It is the homemade version of Peanutbutter Tastycake (even better). And it's a large tray so there is plenty to go around.

Not a bad treat. Everyone seemed to like it, although my son thought it was a white cake! It is more a pale yellow. In consideration of the reviews, I only put in 12 oz chocolate (2 bags of Christmas bells melted down) and added about 1TB of peanut butter. This made the chocolate topping less hard and easier to cut.

This was very good, and very easy to make.  It really did taste like a Tastycake!  I do not have a jelly roll pan, but I made it on a stonewar "bar" pan which is about the size of a cookie sheet.  Because it is stoneware, it took about 5 -10 minutes longer to cook than the recipe directed, but still turned out very well.  I will definitely be making this again.

Good flavor, but didn't care for the texture of the cake...a little on the tough side.

This tastes just something I used to buy in Philadelphia. I have made these numerous times and always get raves for them. I gave one to my grouchy UPS man, and he is now unbelievably friendly. A real hit!

I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed in this cake.  I love peanut butter and chocolate, but this cake didn't cut it.  The cake had an odd texture, really chewy, almost like rubber.  I agree with the user who said that the peanut butter needed to be sweetened.  Plus, 2 cups of peanut butter was way too much.  I heated it to help it spread and it oozed over the sides of my pan.  Even though I greased and floured my pan, the cake still stuck.  Sadly, this isn't a keeper for me.

Great recipe. Cake turned out well. Had to bake a bit longer than specified, and I agree that two cups of peanut butter is too much. Overall I will definitely make again!  

UPDATE

made again last night and halved the PB and used. Half a bag of semi-sweet morsels and half a bag of milk chocolate morsel, as well as a 1/4 cup additional milk on the batter and I feel that it made the cake a bit more moist. My only complaint is that I don't feel that ot was moist enough.

Since I didn't actually use the cake recipe provided here, I'm not sure if I'm entitled to rate it, but here goes:  I used a Jiffy yellow cake mix and baked it in an 8 by 8 pan (they're small mixes), then spread about 3/4 cup peanut butter on it.  I broke up one of the big Hershey bars and put the pieces on top, then set it in the turned off oven for a couple minutes to melt the chocolate and spread it over the cake.  The amount of chocolate was perfect and I had no problem cutting it, even when cooled.  This was very easy and yummy, I only wish I had tasted a real Tandy Cake before!

I have been making this recipe since 2001.  It's always requested by family members for various parties.  I have one in the oven now.  I melt milk chocolate chips instead of the bars.  Also, I melt more than the actual recipe calls for.  Also, I bake at least 23 minutes.  It has never cooked for me in 20.

I wanted to bake a dessert for dinner, and I wash thinking... CAKE! But since Iâ€™m getting pretty good at cooking, I thought that I shouldnâ€™t use a cake mix from the box, and just make a cake mix from scratch. The best part about cake is that you can frost it, so I wanted to find a recipe that has good frosting on top (that I havenâ€™t tried before). I made servings of 12. But here are some things that I did that are different from how the cake should REALLY turn out, I didnâ€™t had any chocolate, so I had to use Nutella. My brother didnâ€™t want the frosting on the whole cake, so I put it half. But thanks for the cake recipe!

Excellent recipe, not sure how some reviewers complained about the cake as it was perfect.  I baked in cookie sheet for 22 minutes.  I'm from NE Pennsylvania so have had the real thing often and these were better!  Thanks.

Tastykake Kandy Kakes have been my favorite snack cake since I was a little girl. In some ways these are even better than the packaged version! The cake is more moist and so delicious! I will be making these over and over! Thanks for sharing!

I will definitely make this again it was a big hit! tasted just like the real Tastykake, tandy cakes. I use butter instead of margarine and I melted the peanut a bit to spread easier. only 1 lb Hershey''s chocolate bars and that was plenty, 2pounds of chocolate would be Overkill in my opinion and I love Hershey's chocolate!

This was so good! I did use only 1.5 cups of peanut butter and a bag of milk chocolate chips. I did not feel like the extra was missing. I kept it in the fridge and everyone kept sneaking in and grabbing them. Yum! I will make these again.

As a native of the Philadelphia area where Peanut Butter Tandycakes are a staple, I was anxious to try this recipe.  I thought it was a reasonable approximation of a Tandycake, and all those who tried them liked them.  I would recommend not putting the peanut butter on the cake when it's right out of the oven because the peanut butter melts too much and accumulates in a thicker layer near the edges of the cake.  Allowing it to cool just a little would probably work better.  I trimmed a little bit from all around the edges of the cake before I cut it because they seemed a little crunchy.

This was excellent.  I tried this square at a picnic a couple of weeks ago and loved it so much that I came online to get the recipe myself.  I made it last night for a babyshower.  The recipe was easy to prepare and turned out wonderful.  Everyone raved about it!
