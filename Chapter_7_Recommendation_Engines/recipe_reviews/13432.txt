I have made this bisque several times now and it is always fantastic. I tend to simplify things so I use a package of imitation lobster in place of the crabmeat and frozen cooked and peeled shrimp. I use extra onion. But the real secret...I use all heavy whipping cream instead of the half-and-half and the wine. It's already low-carb but by using the heavy cream, you can almost eliminate the need for the flour, making it even lower in carbs! Silky smooth and rich. I love this stuff!

Family loved this recipe!! I skipped the chicken boullion and added an additional 1/2 cup of half & half.  I also added 2 tablespoons Old Bay Seasoning and 
1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper to spice it up.  It was wonderful - I will certainly make again!

This was simple and delicious!  I doubled the recipe so I had some to freeze. I added some minced garlic to the onion, added a 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper, used half fat free half & half, and half regular, and used imitation crabmeat.  Before adding the second half of half and half, I used my wand blender, and blended half of the recipe.  This was terrific, and I will def. make it again.  Thanks!

This was a big hit with both my clients and my husband. I too sauteed the onion, with some garlic, before adding the called for ingredients. Also added some scallops, along with cooked potatoes and carrots - which made for a hearty meal. Served with warmed Naan bread. Yum Yum...definitely a keeper!

This was really good.  I doubled the recipe and added black ground pepper to give it a little more spice. The only thing I would do differently is omit the salt and only use half the amount of wine.  Thanks for the recipe...

The flavor was excellent!  I would recommend omitting the salt because the bouillion gave it plenty.  I also was not sure if I was supposed to use raw or cooked shrimp.  I used raw and simmered for 25 minutes.    In addition, I spooned some into the blender and it gave it a great texture.  I served this Christmas Eve and it was a hit.

My husband and I LOVED this. I couldn't get fresh crab meat, so I used 2 4oz cans. It was wonderful! I can't wait to make it again. Thanks for posting.

I only had 2-3 bites and threw the rest of my bowl away and my husband thought it was the worst thing I have made in our 17 year marraige. I followed the recipe exactly. I will say that maybe it was the wine that gave it such a bad taste.

With minor changes, perfect! I used 1/4 cup cream sherry and 1/4 cup water to make up for the 1/4 cup I left out, as well as 1/2 tsp. Old Bay seasoning. I also added 1 stalk celery, sauteed; don't do this, as it added crunchy bits that took away from the overall creamy texture. Loved the soup! Only makes 2 servings, though.

The only reason why I rated this recipe with four stars is because there is so much more the preparer can do with it to increase the flavor and texture!  Like others, I added Old Bay seasoning and sauteed garlic and the onion.  I happened to have Cauliflower in my refrigerator that I steamed and chopped to thicken and provide additional texture.  In addition, I added a cup of sweet frozen corn, a can of petite diced potatoes, and a pinch of freshly dried thyme.  It turned this soup into a great tasting chowder that is typically found in restaurants! Don't be afraid to customize this recipe to your liking with additions like the ones mentioned above.  Just a side note, I do believe the flavor of the soup is compromised when using imitation crab meat instead of canned or fresh blue claw crab meat.  Most likely I'm partial, since growing up eating crabs on the east coast!

This is a good basic recipe to start with, but I made several changes. I chopped my onions and then sauteed them in butter & olive oil. Once they were soft, I sprinkled about 1/4 c flour over them and stirred to get it all mixed. Then I added about 1/2 a carton of chicken stock and stirred it until thickened. Then I added the wine and about 2 c of milk until I got the consistency I wanted. I added a whole large can of crab meat and no shrimp, because that was what I had on hand. It turned out WONDERFULLY. My husband and I both loved it. It made about 4 servings.

This was super easy to make.  I doubled the recipe, omitted the salt, added more onion, added a tablespoon of minced garlic, added a pinch of black pepper and cayenne, and used light half and half.  I also pulsed half of the ingredients in a blender before serving.  Served it in a bread bowl  It was so delicious!  Thanks for the post!

I omitted the salt, only had black pepper, and used the suggestion to use sherry in place of white wine.  I had plenty of crab so I did not use any shrimp.  Garnished with Old Bay.  I thought it had too much sherry and wished I had used white wine!  I'll try this again and watch the amount of wine (trying a little at a time) so I can give this the higher rating it probably does deserve.

This is very similar to the other Shrimp & Crab Bisque on AR.  I've made both and can't tell the difference.  All to say that I think the 1/2 cup wine is too much, I did use only about 1/3 cup of white wine and it gave a perfect flavor.  We enjoyed this with some toasted french bread and both of us thought it was great!!

This is FABULOUS! made some changes, needed more than what it made. I used 2 pints half & half, 1 fat free and 1 regular. also being a Marylander I omited salt and white pepper, added 1 tbsp Old bay and 3/4 tsp black pepper. Also, half cream sherry half white wine totaling 3/4 Cup. Just for added flare, part green onion, part white onion & 3 cloves fresh garlic This was soooo good it could be served in a resturant! Thanks

If you like seafood, you will love this soup!  This is a delicious comfort food ~ so rich and creamy.  After reading the reviews, I used 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 half-and-half.  Also following the advice from other reviews, I blended about a cup and a 1/2 in the blender and added it back to the bisque for texture. I will definitely make this again.

The bisque that I ended up with was fantastic.  This recipe as is, is just weird to me.  As I was preparing it, I was thinking, When do I add water?  I looked at the directions and realized that the cream and wine were the only liquids.  So my soup was basically a seafood stew?  I added some more water (next time I'll just use a can or two of chicken broth instead of boullion), put part of the soup in the food processor so it wasn't quite so chunky, and omitted salt.  It was still too salty, so I'll use reduced sodium broth next time around.  What I ended up with was fantastic, but this recipe is just not good, sorry.

I had to add water, more chicken stock, cream and wine to make it add up to four servings.   I also had a problem with the blandness of the shrimp.  The bisque had wonderful flavor with the added Old Bay, but I would suggest sauteeing the shrimp first in the pot with a  couple of seasonings.  Remove and proceed as normal.  Add the cooked shrimp at the end.  But just to throw the shrimp in the bisque raw does nothing for the overall outcome.   Will make again in few months ... It's too rich to be a regular menu item.

I made this Bisque on NYE and everyone loved it.  I paired it with a hearty bread and I must say it Rocked.  I did however omit the salt as I figured seafood is already salty enough.   I added a lil more onion and 2 tbsp. of minced garlic to the onion/butter/ flour mixter 1/4 tsp. cayenne peper and 1/4 tsp. old bay to give it some extra flavors.  I did a 1/4 cup of white wine and 1/4 cup of chicken stock.  I also used heavy whipping cream (fattening I know but well worth it). Next time Im going to make a double batch and freeze half. Definitily need to try it.

This was a stellar recipe! I forgot to add the wine, but it was still phenomenal without. I did season to my taste and added a generous amount of old bay and garlic, and a tablespoon more of butter. I used fat free half and half and it was perfect. We ate this with rosemary bread. I was afraid I would net have enough liquid, but it was perfect for 2-3 people if your generous with the portions. Recommend doubling the recipe if you're cooking for more people. I will definitely make this again!

This was the first time I've made bisque and couldn't have picked an easier recipe.  I did alter a bit based on another review and added Old Bay and Cayenne.  RAVE REVIEWS from my  Christmas dinner guests.

I made exactly as described, and it was a huge hit!  Only a couple of clarifications:  I cut the shrimp into smaller pieces.  I used Chardonnay wine.  And I used Better than Bouillon from a jar rather than granulated.  My people are seafoodies, and they loved it.  I'll make again.

I have to start by saying I didn't use half-and-half in this soup... I'm trying to cut out dairy in my diet, so I used the Omega-3 fortified unflavored Silk soymilk, and I was a little worried, but it was delicious! I made a double batch, and used a full 12oz package crab (and other fish made to look like crab) meat, and about 1/2 of a 16oz bag of precooked shrimp. I was really worried it wouldn't be thick enough, but I let it simmer on the burner for quite a while and it thickened nicely. Wonderful and easy soup!

I made a couple simple changes. Since I don't like bouillon I substituted 1 can low sodium chicken broth then adjusted the liquids to accommodate the change.  To keep it rich I used whipping cream in place of half and half.  I also added 2 tsp. of Wye River Seafood Spice and some lobster pieces.  It was delicious!

This recipe is awesome! Its extremely simple and easy to add your own touch. I used Pacific Rim Riesling (my fav to drink) and added a little shredded parmesan.

This is super delicious. I doubled the recipe and added 2tsp of cayenne pepper to spice it up. I chopped up the shrimps into smaller pieces and added more onion. Oh and I also blend half of the recipe in a blender before adding the remaining half and half as one of the reviews suggested. Will def make this again!

This is absolutely delicious! I took the advice of others and doctored the recipe up a bit (by adding Old Bay, paprika, and a dash of worchestershire).  The flavor was great!  I used heavy whipping cream instead of half and half and it was very flavorful and RICH! Thanks for sharing the recipe, it's definitely a keeper!

I loved the recipe, it was a hit, however I have to give it a 4 star since I made some changes. I cut the wine in half (too overpowering), and totally cut out the salt (the bouillon has enough). Other than that I followed the recipe to a T. You need to remember to make a roux at the beginning with the first ingredients in order to get a really good consistency. First melt the butter then GRADUALLY add the rest of the ingredients the result will be a nice heavy thick base for your soup. Tip: I mix all my dry ingredients together and have them ready before I melt the butter then just shake them over the pot to slowly incoperate.

I absolutley loved this - especially how easy it was. I ended up blending the soup a bit and adding some milk but that's to preference. Next time I'll make 2-3 batches so it lasts longer than 1 lunch. :)

Thanks, this was very flavorful.  I used two small cans of crab meat, 1/2 lb. small shrimp, and 1/2 of a medium onion.

This ended up being very expensive because of the crab, but so delicious. I didn't change a thing, and it was great. Very good with crusty bread - tastes better than at a restaurant.

My husband and I made this for the first time.  We followed the recipe precisely...It was terrible.  There is no time for the soup to delvelop any flavor.  The crab and shrimp were not enough.  The broth tasted like plain half and half.  The white wine seemed to make it worse, creating a taste that was less than appetizing.  Please think twice before wasting you nice crab meat on this dish.  Very disappolinted....ended up making sandwiches for dinner :(

OMG sooo good! Changes I made: used heavy cream w/o flour. Sauted onions, with garlic, red pepper flakes, and pepper in the butter. Added the cream, wine (only 1/4 cup),  added chicken bouillon, seafood, heated served. Fantastic.

This was an elegant 5-star soup that was the starter course for our Valentine's Day meal. I made the recipe as is although I used fat-free half & half as the cream. I also added a touch of Old Bay since we Marylanders don't eat anything with crab unless it has Old Bay. Thanks for a wonderful soup.

Great basic soup, and really easy.  I decided that I wanted shrimp bisque and was able to make this with things on hand, with the exception of the shrimp and crab.  I omitted the wine and bouillon.  In place of the bouillon, I added about 1 oz of homemade chicken stock (1 ice cube).  That added a little bit of depth to the flavor.  I also used about 1 tsp of Old Bay and more onion.  I was really pleased with the results, and it was a hit- even with my 3 and 1 year olds!

If you like wine...you'll like this recipe.  I added the 1/2 cup of wine as the recipe said. Then, I taste tested it. I ended up adding an extra cup of cream to try to cover up some of the wine taste. My husband hated it as well.   I will try this recipe again, but maybe only put 1 Tablespoon of wine.

I have made this a few times so far!  It's a great base recipe.  I did some minor changes based on personal preference and what I had on hand.  I added the onion right at the beginning with the melted butter to start cooking before I added the flour, salt and pepper.  Instead of using chicken bouillon, I substituted some chicken stock and cooking sherry for the white wine...basically 3/4 chicken stock and the rest cooking sherry for the white wine. I also add a sprinkle or two of cayenne pepper for a little zing! Thank you for the recipe, Katrina!

Liked this a lot.  I live in Abu Dhabi and used canned crab.  It worked very well.  I would suggest skipping the salt, for sure.  I also would suggest using Chardonnay instead of Sauvignon Blanc as the wine. Great recipe.

I've made this as written and it's good, with some changes it's great.  I saute the onion (more than called for) and some celery in the butter.  I then add the white wine and let it reduce a little.  I then add flour/half and half or just heavy cream and let it thicken up and then I hit it with the immersion blender so there are no onion or celery chunks.  I saute the shrimp in garlic and evoo until they are about half done and then I coarsely chop them and add them to the soup with the crab to let them cook the rest of the way.  I also reduce the white pepper to about 1/8 of a teaspoon and add old bay to taste.  Sometimes I add a pinch of cayenne.  Delish!

So disappointed! I followed the recipe as written except I used black pepper and imitation crabmeat. It ended up bland but very salty.

This is the best crab bisque I have ever made and rivals restaurants.  I followed the recipe except ommited the shrimp, and just threw in a bouillon cube.  I did double the recipe which was perfect for 4 people.  My fiance and future father-in-law really enjoyed it as well!

I am BRAND new to this cooking thing!!!  I generally mess up everything.  This bisque was sooooo Delicious!  I wanted to make more because the pot went so fast.  I only wish there was a recipe to make larger portions.

I don't put the onion in.  I use onion powder instead(as an adult, I still hate the onion crunch) and we use  1lb. crab(with a k) and chop it up finely.  We always end up using more pepper; we use both white and black.  We also add garlic salt to taste(my family loves garlic).  I always add more half/half, after everything is in, it's too thick to eat as soup, but I never measure, I only add until I have the right consistency.  We also add at least 1/2 cup of grated parm.  This is a fantastic tasting, very easy and fast meal to make(even my 13-year-old can make it by himself).

I added oregano, garlic cloves, onion powder, scallops, boiled potatoes, and seafood seasoning.  Add enough for your taste buds, dip garlic bread in it.  Serve it over grits also.

Delicious.  Since we don't drink alcohol, I simmered the shrimp shells in water and Old Bay Seasoning, drained it and used the stock in place of the wine.  It was awesome! I cut up the shrimp in small chunks and would recommend you doing that too!

I made a few tweeks to this recipe.   1) I used 3 tablespoons of butter and then cooked the shrimp shells in the butter and then strained 2 tablespoons of butter out of that. This added a much better seafood flavor. 2) I used shallots instead of onions 3) I added a tablespoon of tomato paste to the butter, shallot and flour mixture. 4) I added a teaspoon and a half of seafood seasoning (Seafood Magic, you could use old bay or your favorite seafood seasoning) 5) I cut the shrimp into smaller pieces which improved the texture. 6) I added a few drops of Sriracha hot sauce at the end to give it a nice zip.  Okay so looking at my edits I realize I changed a lot about this recipe so I almost feel like I'm reviweing a different soup. I can't tell you if this reheats well as there was NONE leftover. I made it for Easter dinner and even my dad who is notoriously picky enjoyed this soup.

I tweaked this recipe so much I'm not going to give an in-depth review, but I'll give it three stars as a good base recipe. The white wine was a lovely touch. If you find the wine taste too sharp let it boil down a little and add a pinch of sugar if you desire.

Very good recipe as written but I had to add a bit of cayenne to wake it up. Exceptionally easy to prepare and is ready to eat in minutes

Found it to be a very good soup. However, like most people are saying it was a little bland.  I do plan on doing the recipe again. Next time, I am going to put either Old Bay or Tony Chachere's seasoning and a little paprika.  That should give it the little extra kick it needs.

I made this dish just as it was written and it came out with hardly any flavor so I started to look for something in my kitchen to pep it up. Although it may sound weird I added a can of cheese soup as well as two tablespoons of Wistershire. I also added a half of can of celery soup and it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe because I could never of pulled it off without the base.

i've been making this for 4 years, i've actually memorized the recipe. i usually triple it. the whole family loves it. i never measure spices, i'm sure i use more than called for. i use half and half/whipping cream/milk. whatever i have on hand. imitation crab works wonderfully, that's all i've ever used. delicious!

This was perfect for what I was looking for, I wanted a good recipe for Shrimp bisque and found this one, tried it last night, I didnt have White Wine so I used Chardonay, only 1 and 1/2 Tbs of wheat flower instead of white and it was so delicous I put it over angel hair pasta to make it more of a meal than an appetizer. Served it with French bread toasted in the toaster oven with butter, parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of Italian Good Seasions spice until the cheese was melted. I loved it and will make it again and again.

For this dish, I used one fish bouillon cube and 2 cups of half-and-half.  I hate when dishes don't have enough salt, so believe me when I say that this came out too salty even with the increased half-and-half.  However, the dish still tasted really good, so I will definitely make this again and just omit the 1/2 tsp salt.  Thanks!

Such a great soup!! I cooked this soup in a party and everyone enjoys it a lot! I didn't put crab meat but the taste is delicious! What I would recommend is to boil the shrimp heads seperately and then cook its stock together with all other ingredients. The taste of the shrimp is so rich. The 4-6 servings is really not much so next time I'll scale the recipe to 8 if I were to make for 6. Because everyone wanted to have more!!

I made it per the recipe for dinner and added a salad and french bread. We're not big eaters but my wife and I ate all of it so recipe should state 4 servings as a side.  We had just come from a trip to Savanna, GA and had a similar bisque. I was over the top. I don't what it needs to get there but it is close.

Unfortunately I didn’t have the half & half. I almost didn’t make it because of this. However, I settled for 1 % milk. I kept it on low heat longer than usual to reduce it. Bottom line, it was out of this world delightful. I did add mushrooms after sautéing them. What a wonderful recipe. Kudos to the creator of this most addictive bisque. I DEFINITELY will make it again.

Wonderful, simple recipe, but definitely double it.   I doubled it to get 4 servings out of it, but  cooked it exactly as written.  It was pretty bland, so I followed some other reviewers' advice and dumped in some Old Bay (probably about a Tbs), some paprika and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  The flavor was awesome!   The other reviews are right, though, the seafood should have been halved at least.

I used sherry instead of wine, 1 pkg biscuits(not 2), onion powder instead of onions(son won't eat onions), and 3/4 cup chicken broth instead of granules.  Added some cayenne and old bay. Will make again - excellent!

I switched the crab and shrimp for a more affordable mix of frozen sea food. Followed all other instructions and IT WAS DELICIOUS. All ingredients are items I always have on hand. I'll definitely be keeping this as my go to soup for cold days!

This was really good. Took advice and used only 1/2 the wine ( I had sherry) and it was delish!  Also added Old Bay and dash of cayenne paper. Served it with spinach salad and a thick slice of garlic toast. (Used fat free half & half)

Really yummy, and easy to make -- I did spice it up a little with Old Bay's and a little cayenne, but that's just personal preference.  I left out the wine because my two guys think they don't like the taste of wine (although they get it often in my cacciatore).  I know I'd have liked it even better with the wine taste, so maybe I'll sneak some in next time.

Excellent recipe.  I followed the recipe as is except for I didn't have any fresh crab meat so I used canned and it still came out awesome.  I made it in a bread bowl and it was a big hit.  Thankyou for this one--it's a keeper!

Very good recipe. After reviewing other ratings, I omitted salt and wine and just used 2 cups whipping cream, 2 tsp of Old Bay seasoning, 2 cloves garlic and 1 tsp of cayenne pepper--would NOT use cayenne again, or would do 1/2 tsp (for a kick)or 1/4 tsp (for a little heat). It was wayyy too spicy, and my husband (who likes hot food) said it was really spicy. If it weren't for the cayenne (still blowing my nose), it would be a 5 star recipe.

This was very good but I would use fresh crab if it's in season.  I didn't love the flavor of the canned crab but the company I served this to really enjoyed it.  It was also extremely easy to make and quite impressive for company.  I defrosted frozen shrimp and then peeled them in advance.  I used my kitchen sheers to cut them into small pieces.  Everything was pretty much tossed in the pot within a few minutes and it was ready to go.

I love this recipe. I made two changes, one I used heavy whipping cream instead of half and half. Second I added 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper. I can't wait to make this recipe again.

This was a great, easy recipe. On the advice of other reviewers, I added a little Old Bay seasoning and that made a good bisque great. The recipe didn't call for chopping the seafood but I did, as not doing so would make it kind of wierd. Next time I make this I will finely chop some of the shrimp/crab so it's not so broth vs. chunk.

I made it at 4 servings...for 4 people, but there wasn't enough for 4 people, so I made egg noodles with it and we put it over that. I also tried imitation crab...I won't do that again. We loved this recipe. Glad I found it.

This was not a very flavorful bisque. I followed the recipe exactly (except that I used black instead of white pepper). Any suggestions on adding some more flavor?

This is a wonderful soup!  A meal in itself.  I added cayenne pepper because I add that to everything and it gave it a great kick. Next time I won't add the additional salt, the bouillon is salty enough.

This was just ok. I added some scallops to the other meat, but that didn't jazz this up at all. I had to add significant amounts of spice to get this to have any flavor. Once I doctored it up it was good, but it was pretty bland beforehand.

This is such a rich and delicious recipe that I feel guilty eating it.  I've made this several times using just shrimp, and it's been a hit every time.

I made this for Christmas & everyone loved it.  I did double it, and I added about 1/2 cup of shrimp broth (simmered the shells).  I also added about 7-8 scallops.  I did not double to wine.  This was a hit & I have had several people ask for the recipe!

This was excellent and so quick to make! We are used to a little more "kick" so we added some black pepper once it was cooked and it was then perfect. We also got a "sweet" taste to it but that was probably because we used imitation lobster meat.

The seafood lovers in my family loved it. I used a lobster bouillon that I found instead of the chicken and it came out great. Quick and very easy too.

Outstanding!!  It was the hit of my Christmas brunch.  I had a few leftover scallops from another recipe and threw them in too!  Will definitely make again!!
