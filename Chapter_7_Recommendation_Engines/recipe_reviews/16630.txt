Wonderful dressing - I used olive oil instead of veg. oil and dijon instead of dry mustard. Very refreshing and was perfect over mixed greens.  This would also be great over pasta salad as well.

this recipe was delicious!  very easy to make, and it has an incredible zing to it.  i made it without the sugar (accidental omission), and with a little less (olive) oil, and it was just one of the best salads i've had.

I made a number of changes to this recipe which not only suited my tastes, but I believe made this better - olive oil, not vegetable oil, no sugar, fresh dill (although dried would have been fine) and white wine vinegar rather than red. Light and delicious, a dressing that supports the salad rather than dominating it. My four star rating is WITH the above changes.

Nice and Tart, with a wonderful flavor of Dill.  The Blender makes this a smooth and thick dressing that coats leafy greens well.

WOW! I made this dressing for a salad on Father's Day. Three people BEGGED me to give them the recipe. It was wonderful! I used Splenda in place of the sugar and didn't have dry mustard so I used dijon instead and it turned out great. I will use this recipe alot!

Everyone loves this dressing.  We use it not only on salads but as a seafood marinade!  It is so light and crisp but packed with flavor!  The best!

Really enjoyed this over tomatoes from the garden. With all the rain this year, the tomatoes don't seem to have as much taste as usual, and this greatly added to the flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very, very good vinaigrette.  Hubby and I love salads and I'm always looking for new dressings to prepare.  I went against the majority and used the full amount of sugar called for.  I thought it was the perfect ratio of sweet and tart.  I used half red wine and half balsamic vinegar.  Very unique tasting.  Thanks Rinnie.

I would use a little less sugar next time (maybe just a teaspoon), but all in all this is a GREAT vinaigrette that I will certainly use again and again!

I made a simple mac & chesse last night and a salad to go along with it with this dressing and it was wonderful. I doubled the recipe and now wish that I had trippled it. One of those dressings that you just want to drown the salad with it because it was just that good. I will be using this one again and again. Thank you Rinnie

This was a delicious dressing.  My husband, Mr.I- Only-Eat-Blue-Cheese-Dressing, really liked it as well. I doubled the recipe, and we had it on a regular salad one night, and I used the rest on tomato slices the next day.  Will definitely be making this often.

Oh yeah babe, gooooooooood dressing. I cut back on the sugar based on DReginek's advice and I'm glad I did as it would have a little too sweet for our tastes. However, I do feel it does need at least some sugar or else I think I would have gotten that "just sucked a lemon" face. The kids went nuts over this Rinnie!

This dressing is FABULOUS!  I followed the recipe fairly closely, subbing EVOO for veggie oil and leaving out the black pepper (I detest black pepper).  I'm not quite sure how to describe this, other than YUMMY!  It's got a subtle light flavor that still allows the flavor of your salad shine through.  This makes only enough for 1 large salad, w/a slight bit left over, though, so keep that in mind when looking to make in larger quantities.  I was too lazy to get out (really to clean after) our blender, so I just mixed it w/a spoon right in my measuring cup.  I can't wait to taste it on tomorrow's lunch salad after the flavors have melded.  THANKS for a great recipe!

Incredible! I used olive oil, full amount of sugar and substituted yellow mustard for the dry (didn't have) - excellent. I'm a ranch dressing person but I actually prefer this recipe to ranch now & I feel less guilty eating it.  Thanks!

I am so happy to have found this recipe! I originally made it to use on "Patty's Pasta Salad" from this site. It was so delicious! I have tried so many store bought vinaigrette dressings but never like any of them. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Great dressing! So much tastier than bottled dressing for very little effort. I usually make double the amount of this dressing with canola oil or olive oil and it makes enough for about a  week's worth of salads.

Great dressing!  I used this last night to marinate asparagus & that was good, but I used the rest on a lunch salad today & YUM!  The longer it has to meld together, the tastier it is!  I did cut the sugar in 1/2 & used "garlic red wine vinegar, mmmmm.  Thanks Rinnie!

I didn't read the reviews until AFTER I made the dressing, so I used the full amount of sugar.  I didn't find it too sweet, but I did use "heaping" 1/8 tsp of the dry mustard, garlic and onion powder so maybe that compensated for it.  Nice to find a recipe with ingredients that I always have on hand. A+ in my books.

Great dressing. It was very easy. I would use a little less sugar next time, but I guess it depends what is in the salad. I agree with the reviewer who said this would make a great marinade.

This dressing was so good! Taking the advice from others, I cut down on the sugar (using a little less than 1 teaspoon). Also instead of veg. oil, I used extra lite olive oil. I didn't have onion powder so I sliced a bit of an onion.  I didn't have dry mustard so I used dijon. The recipe turned out great! My only complaint is that I didn't make more!

This was excellent!!  The only change I made was using olive oil, which unfortunately doesn't hold up well to use it a few days later.  I did use all the sugar, but I added it gradually so that I could taste it along the way.

Tasty and easy. I doubled the recipe, but only used 1 tsp of sugar . . . actually I used Splenda because I don't eat sugar and the taste was terrific. We tossed some of our fresh tomatoes from our garden in this and served it with a fish entree.

Tasty, I added a clove of garlic to jazz it up just a little. (Nothing was wrong with the original - I just like more garlic) Would be good with garlic or dill croutons.

I didn't have any dried dill weed so I used dill seeds instead. Not a good idea, I didn't like having seeds in my salad. I ended up straining the dressing through cheesecloth and what was left was fantastic. Just the right amount of sweetness and not bitter at all. I will absolutely make this again with the dill weed. Just keep in mind that this only makes 2 servings. The next time I will triple the recipe.

I used extra light olive oil instead of veg oil and didn't bother with the blender - just whisked it really well. It was excellent and everyone loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

Good salad! I made this for our first "course" pre-steak meal. Very good! However, I should have heeded other advice about the sugar...next time I will use less or none at all. The result was a little to sweet. Still, would make this salad again! Thanks Rinnie!

I really liked this vinaigrette recipe. I used fresh dill instead of the dry and stone ground mustard instead of the dry mustard. The result was fresh and light- really lovely over mixed greens.

I really liked this.  It is a little like a Greek dressing, because of the sugar.  I used one teaspoon of sugar, and next time will use even less.  I have started a good quality vinegar collection, and used my sherry vinegar this time.  It was great.

As a salad fanatic, I am always looking for new dressings to change things up. I was not a fan of this one - far too sweet and oily! It did not compliment the delicious salad I prepared to go with it.

I used this to marinate my beans and potatos, and served on the side of my salad nicoise.  Fabulous!  I started slow on the sugar as other reviewers suggested, but found I used about 1/2 what was called for to cut the acidity of the vinegar.  Fresh dill made this extra special.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I used EVOO instead of veg. oil, converted the dill to fresh, omitted the onion powder since I didn't have, used Dijon rather than dried mustard, reduced the sugar to 1 t., and I used the blender.  Then I tripled it.  It was great.

This dressing is delicious! A little sweet and tangy with wonderful dill flavor. I actually substituted fresh dill for dried but I imagine either way is good. I served it with baby greens and grilled chicken on top. Perfect light and yummy dinner!

I used olive oil in this but left everything else exactly the same.  I thought the vinaigrette had a good flavor except for a strong bitter taste.  The only thing I can think of that could have made it bitter is the dry mustard.  I've never used dry mustard in a recipe before but happened to buy a bottle last week.  Because the vinaigrette had good flavor otherwise, I'm going to try making it again sans dry mustard and hoping it doesn't have the bitter taste.  Maybe I'll put in a little bit of yellow or dijon mustard to make up for it.  Update: the dressing lost the bitterness after being in the fridge for a couple of days and was really good.

I made this dressing exactly as called for in the recipe and it was delicious.  I used a mason jar to mix the ingredients and it came together beautifully; tasty, rich and thick!  There will definitely be a next time for this one!  This vinaigrette is absolutely the PERFECT balance of tart/sweet.  One of THE best vinaigrette recipes I have ever tasted!  Thank you Rinnie!

Great easy dressing! Followed the recipe exactly, except I used fresh dill that I've been wanting to use up. FYI - if using fresh, use more since dried has a stronger flavor! I probably used about 2 teaspoons, and mixed it all up in the magic bullet. Fresh and delicious!

Awesome!!! I have to admit, I started making this before I realized I was out of red wine vinegar, so I subbed cider vinegar and cut down on the sugar a bit. This was divine served over a simple salad of spring greens, dried cranberries, and goat cheese crumbles.  I'll definitely be making this again!!

I just made this, as I am on a "diet kick" and wanted something fresh for lunch. I used balsamic wine vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar, and quadrupled the recipe... removing the lid from the blender, the aroma that came out smelled amazing! I took a little taste and it is delicious!!! So easy to make :)

I like this dressing. For me it has just the right amount of sugar to offset the vinegar, without tasting sweet.  I will make this again.

Good dressing, no alternations needed.  I added craisins to my salad for some sweetness to compliment the tart vinaigrette.  I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing ther recipe!

Great recipe...I modified it sllightly due to our tastes, but it is awesome, easy & most people probably always have these ingredients on hand.  Why buy salad dressing, this is much better. I used fresh dill in quantity rather than dill weed, & added a bit more oil (a little olive oil) and sugar as my family thought the vinegar was a bit strong.  The blender method is the best part adding the oil last and slowly blending it in makes it perfect and it does not separate.  A definite keeper, which is also easily modifiable to use different herbs from your garden...ie. tarragon, savory, etc. Would be 5 stars, but made a few changes.

This was great.  I also used a little prepared brown mustard, because I did not have dry mustard on hand.  Good mix of flavors, thicker consistency for a vinaigrette, which I liked.  I did not use a blender, just should in my salad dressing cruet and it turned out great!

Used 1 tbsp snipped fresh dill in place of dried.  Also used 1 clove pressed garlic in place of garlic powder.  Delicious over sliced tomatoes and cucumbers.

This is great.  I doubled it and poured it over a salad composed of romaine, cucumbers, black olives, avocado, tomatoes and two drained cans of flaked solid albacore. Then I sprinkled the whole thing with some garlic salt.  Serve it with some toasted sourdough and it's a meal.

Loved this dressing. Recipe called for too much sugar for my taste, so cut back by 1/2 teaspoon & added fresh lemon juice. It made a perfect dressing for my pasta salad!

Delicious! We had it on a romaine and salmon salad, but I can also see just tossing some cherry tomatoes in it. I used a little squirt of Dijon mustard instead of dry mustard.

This is my go to dressing and I love it! I do make a couple  of minor changes. I withhold the dry mustard and use white pepper instead of black. This is a fabulous recipe and after trying many I hit pay dirt with this one.

I liked this quite a bit. My only real complaints were that the dill was a bit muted for my tastes and I think it was a little too sweet. Those are easy fixes for the future, though.

It doesn't strike me as a great dressing for cold lettuce salads (though I haven't tried it, so I could be wrong!), but I used it on a slightly warm no-fish Niçoise salad and it was fantastic.

Tasty.  I quadrupled the recipe so I'd have enough for a few days.  I also made a few other changes, using a combination of 75% EVOO and 25% canola oil, substituting Splenda for sugar, and using only half the amount of sweetener called for in the original recipe.  I used it over a simple salad of leafy greens, cucumbers, green onions and tomatoes.  It will go on a spinach salad tomorrow.  My partner and I both agreed that this recipe is a keeper.  Edited on 12/19/15 to add: I made it several times as above, but tonight I made the recipe as is except for substituting EVOO for the vegetable oil.  Though it was sweeter, it was also an acceptable level of sweetness for some salads.  Wonderful to have such a tasty recipe that is so easy and uses ingredients I always have on hand.

Perhaps my taste buds were off, but I couldn't taste the vinaigrette or the dill. Not tangy enough for me. More on the creamy side.

Yummy and very fresh tasting!  Only change was to reduce amount of sugar, as recommended by other reviewers. (thanks for suggesting that...)It's just what I wanted to use on my home grown cukes!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

One of our favorites.  We don't add the sugar because of my husbands health needs but it is still wonderful!

OK but not the best.  Didn't really taste much dill but probably should have used fresh.  Used less sugar but it still tasted too sweet.

This is reminiscent of the vinegary dill flavor of dill pickle potato chips. A nice way to get the taste without the fat. I used fresh dill for extra flavor. I'd make this again next time I have fresh dill and salad fixin's on hand.

This was a yummy change of pace for us.  I used a dill mix that had onions and garlic in it.  I might fo it differantly to see if it made a differance, but it was good this way.  I did go back and add a little more dill and sugar.  It was still a little oily for me, but I'll probably make it again.

Hate to go against the grain, but we did not care for this, even with reducing the sugar as so many other reviewers suggested.  Thanks, Rinnie.
