This is the real deal for people in Maine.  I have lived on the Maine coast all my life and this is the way we make lobster stew.  The secret to rich flavor is using the tomalley and the roe.  Once cooked, it disappears into the stew giving it a wonderful flavor.  For those that add other ingredients like extra spices, vegetables, etc. it is not authentic Maine lobster stew. We serve this every Christmas Eve in my family.

Great, easy receipe! Only thing I added was a little bit of spices (salt, pepper, celery salt) and by little I mean only a dash.

I totally agree using the tomalley and the thick white substance from inside the claws makes all the difference in a stew... I've never used the eggs myself... maybe will try it next time. I'm making this tonight but using fresh frozen meat so dont have that option. I will next time I get fresh though!!!

Now that is how lobster stew is made, use the whole lobster and keep it simple. Anybody who says they changed this or you should do this are fools.
