Delicious! Next time I would double the chicken mixture. After the initial 15 minutes of baking time, I placed the biscuits on top, covered with foil, and baked for 10 minutes. Then I removed the foil and baked for 10 minutes longer. Perfect biscuits!

This was great. My hubby never eats veggies but he ate every bit on his plate.

I used the 98% fat free cream of chicken and put a dash of garlic and onion powder in the mix to give it more flavor. I also added a little bit more milk and used a 10 oz bag of frozen carrots, peas and green beans. I did not use canned chicken; instead I cut up a chicken breast and cooked it before adding to the recipe. 
I used frozen biscuits after 15min and foiled the top for another 15min, took off the foil and broiled for 5min to get the biscuits a golden crisp.

Everything worked out wonderfully, I will make this monthly.

Thanks :)

This was very yummy and so easy. I followed another reviewer's advice and covered the biscuits for 10 minutes with foil and then baked another 10 after removing the foil.

I doubled everything....  I used 5 chicken breast cooked and chopped.... I added mushrooms and cream of mushroom soup..... I cooked the biscuits half way first then added them to the top to finish cooking... For my taste, I found this to be a very bland...  Needs more flavor... I will not make this again...

A really yummy base recipe, but the biscuts were still kind of raw- I think I'll cook them on a baking sheet for a little bit 1st next time. I have made a healtheir version by using rice instead of biscuits.
*EDIT* I made it again, this time I cooked the biscuts for 5 mins before adding them so it wasnt raw. Also I used 1 can cream of ck, 1 can cream of potato and I added onion. Very yummy this way!

I made this dish recently, with two changes: I doubled the recipe, and omitted the cheese. It came out very tasty and filling, and was extremely easy. However, as others have said, I would suggest baking the biscuits separately and adding them on top right before serving. Mine came out slightly doughy on the bottom following the recipe. Overall a good recipe I'll make again!

Very good and easy. I used VegAll because I had it - probably not the best idea though. Next time I'll double the soup and I might double the veggies. I cooked my own chicken breasts because I didn't have canned.

Very good recipe, nice spin on chicken broccoli casserole.  I made a few changes.  I used a lot less than 1/4 cup of milk, more like the bottom of the soup can worth.  Mine always comes out soupy when I use more.  I did not use any pepper, instead I used basil, oregano, dried onion, and fresh parsley...roughly a teaspoon of each.  The frozen veggie mix I had was with carrots, green beans, and peas and I also used a bit of fresh broccoli.  I have no clue what canned chunk chicken is.  I boiled chicken and cubed that.  After I put the chicken in my casserole dish, I tossed with a tablespoon of caesar dressing, then put the rest together, adding cheese and mixing and then topping with cheese.  I didn't cook with the biscuits because the last time I made something like this, my boyfriend didn't like the mushy biscuits.  I cooked for 20 minutes, but it could have used more time.  Overall, great.

I wanted to make this with healthier ingredients, so I sauteed some matchstick carrots, garlic and half an onion in EVOO and added 1/2 of a head of cauliflower I trimmed down into bite-sized pieces. I also threw in a cup of flash frozen white corn. This was a little thick so I used 6 oz. of sharp cheddar and 1/3 c. white wine and 3/4 c. of milk. It's in the oven now, I hope this is a family favorite. It was easy enough to make with most ingredients I usually have on hand. (And most of the ingredients I bought cheaper at Grocery Outlet, so I could feed my three boys well on a smaller budget and healthier ingredients.)EDITED: Awesome the way I made it. So good. I was a little torked with undone biscuits on the bottom. If I were to make this again, and I will, I'd cook the biscuits seperate. I'd add more cauliflower, too.

Homestyle Chicken & Biscuits Haiku: "Forgot to add milk. Glad I started biscuits first, made sure they were done!." Other than some garlic powder and dried parsley added to the soup/cheese/chicken/vegg mixture, I kept everything the same, but also took advice of many reviews saying to do the biscuits partially separate b4 finishing their baking time on top of everything. This was an easy and comforting dish, and one that I'll look forward to making again in the fall, although it could benefit from the additional of some sauteed onions, additional spices, and peas!

I always wanted to make a dish like this and I wasn't disappointed.  I liked it better than my husband, which is kind of rare.  I used 1 package of (unthawed) frozen stir-fry vegetables and some fresh, blanched broccoli.  I added a tad of Worcestershire sauce to the soup mix.  This is comfort food.

SUPER Easy and DELICIOUS!!!!  I doubled it based off others recomendations, so glad i did.  I added extra veggies, finely diced onions, salt, pepper garlic.  and i used cooked chicken. I split the biscuts in half and put them on top and once they were golden i flipped over and brown the other side.  SO SO good and EASY!

Really great recipe but the biscuits did not get fully done. Made it a second time and cooked biscuits half time on cookie sheet and then finished baking on casserole. Delicious!

Recipe was good and very easy. However the biscuits did not cook in the recommended time, I would suggest cooking them on a separate cookie sheet. The only thing different I did was to buy a precooked chicken from the grocery store and shredded it. Next time I will try the canned to save time.

This was a really quick recipe that got both my kids to eat broccoli and cauliflower.  The biscuits only got done on the top half though.  Next time I will bake the biscuits seperately.   Also the canned chicken is very easy, but it would probably be better with chicken breast cut up.
