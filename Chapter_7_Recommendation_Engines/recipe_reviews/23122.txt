YUMMY! This was super easy to make and tasted great, too. I used 1 can of apple pie filling and cut up 3 white peaches to add to it; I also subbed vanilla yogurt for the sour cream, 'cuz that's what I had on hand. By only using one can of filling and some fresh fruit, this was very tasty without being too sweet. I also like how easy the crust is to make. I used a 10x10 casserole dish for this, so the topping was a thin layer. Next time I'll use a deeper dish so that the cream layer is thicker. This set up very well, but you definitely have to chill for a few hours, after it cools, before serving. The kids loved this with a little scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This recipe is EXCELLENT! I used lowfat sour cream, pre-made crust, and frozen fruit instead of canned. This resulted in a delicious and low calorie fruit pie. Thank you Kathleen!
