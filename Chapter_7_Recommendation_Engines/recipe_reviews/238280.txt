I had a blast making these! I used a ring pop mold and they turned out really cute. The red hot candies completely disintegrate. I wasn't expecting that. I also wasn't sure how they would mix with the flavor of pink lemonade but they worked great together. This is super easy and I highly recommend making some for your kiddos this summer.
