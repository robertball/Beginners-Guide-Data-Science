This was and easy and delicious recipe for fortune cookies! Even though I didn’t have milk, water worked just fine.

Because of some "operator errors" on my part, the recipe didn't turn out exactly like it should have. but if I had followed directions like I should, they would have been perfect.  Nice easy recipe and very tasty.  My boyfriend thought they were a nice addition to the Chinese dinner I made.  You have to make sure that you don't spread the mixture too thin, or make the cookies too large, or they will crack when you are trying to mold them.  A few trial and error mistakes, but they were very good.

Tried doing the recipe twice, and both times it failed, it was a good taste but I couldn’t get the cookie mix to spread and they were not very easy at all

These were very easy to make and shape. Made them for a New Years Eve party with my granddaughters. We added some melted chocolate and sprinkles over the finished cookie to make them festive.
