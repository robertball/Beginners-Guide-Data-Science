Great recipe! I have made a few times! I used 1 tsp ground cardamon and the grated rind of 1 lemon (I can not find cardamon extract) and it tasted amazing! Thank-you!

Great flavor, but what a mess! The very center was still a tiny bit gooey, and the rest was quite crumbly. I doubled the recipe and made two loaves. Maybe I shouldn't have.

This takes quite a while to bake, but it is well worth it. I was amazed that this was one of the more popular cakes I have ever made! More popular than rich chocolate cakes etc. You will be surprised how wonderfully it turns out and tastes!

Wonderful cake! Thank you!

This quick bread is simply amazing and very forgiving.  I've made it at least 10 times, once with only half the butter, and every time this unassuming cake gets all kinds of praise heaped on it.  And it's a fantastic alternative to banana and zucchini breads, and even easier.
