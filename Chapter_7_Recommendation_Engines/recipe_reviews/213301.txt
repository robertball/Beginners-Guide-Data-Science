Pretty good, considering how easy and quick it is. I made it exactly as written, even down to the brand-name ingredients (although Campbell's seems to have shrunk their cans down to 10.5 ounces). The peas seem a bit unauthentic, although they work anyway. But overall this makes a good, quick, tasty rice. There are probably better recipes, but this was my first, I think, and a good introduction.

This was such an easy recipe and was a hit with everyone.  The rice was moist and had major taste.  I would definitely make it again!

This is pretty tasty. I had to do quite a bit of subbing since I did not have some of the ingredients on hand. I used brown basmati rice instead of white rice. I also omitted the cumin and the garlic powder. I was worried this would affect the "Spanish" flavor but the salsa I used took care of that. I also used regular chicken broth. Quick, easy, and hard to mess up. I'll definitely make this again.

Made this for family gatherings at Christmas time. I chose to cook it in a crockpot & I used brown rice for it. I bought picante sauce in bulk, so I love having a recipe that uses it. I omitted the peas.

I was looking for an qucik easy side dish to go with Mexican food and this recipe was perfect.  I used a different brand of chicken broth that was a larger size so I decreased the amount of water used accordingly.  I didn't have peas on hand so I left those out too.  I think this recipe could also be good with corn and black beans added.  Super easy and lots of ways to adjust to fit your own tastes.
