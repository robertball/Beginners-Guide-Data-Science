Simple and easy to make, but most of all delicious! I think this could be made with other fish such as salmon, cod, etc.

This is a recipe that is so much better than the sum of its parts! Just FYI, I was dead beat tonight: all I had was concentrated lemon juice and dried parsley and there was no way I was leaving the house for either of these items. Regardless, it was incredible. I don't think it matters but we had steelhead trout, by the way.

Simple & delicious.  I used fresh Meyers lemon, parsley and added a little dill. I finally learned to dry then dust the skin with flour before putting it in the hot butter. That's how you get the crunchy crust. Basic thing but I always rinsed the fish off and threw it in the pan.  Just adding that little pat to dry the skin made all the difference.

This is a great recipe for those who consider themselves cooking challenged. There were only 5 ingredients and they are things you typically have at all times. I typically burn everything that has to be broiled but the 5-6 inch setting helped me not smoke up the kitchen. It was delicious, simple and looked beautiful next to a nice salad.

I can't get enough. We make this once a week! It is simple, quick and delicious! The only change we make is we use cilantro instead of parsley just because we love cilantro. I have come to the conclusion, after using many recipes on this site, that if it is a recipe submitted by Chef John recipe, it is going to be amaaaaazzzing!! Thanks so much for another winner Chef John!!

I didn't change a thing- delicious!  The brown butter and parsley made this dish sing.  Important to S n P well.   Made with trout caught just yesterday.  Fresh, simple, healthy, yet very satisfying to the taste buds.  Only way I'll ever cook trout again.  Thanks, Chef!

This is a delicious dish. The ingredients are simple, fresh, and bursting with flavor. There were no changes made to this recipe except to substitute steelhead trout for rainbow trout. Thank you Chef John. I no longer fear making fish.

This will definitely be my go-to recipe for trout. It was so good! Taking the time to brown the butter is time very well spent. I skipped this step the first time I made this, but now I know better. Do not skip any steps!

Outstanding and simple recipe!  Was out of fresh parsley so had to use dried which worked just fine  in a pinch.  With a mild fish such as trout,  simple ingredients work best.  Aside from trout amondine, this will be my go to recipe for trout from now on.

This is very fast and easy to make with good lemon and butter flavor. I normally like my fish breaded and fried, but this is a more heathier way to go. I’ll save the fried fish for camping when anything goes and the delicious healthy version for home. Thank you for this simple yet tasty recipe.

A-mazing. And I understand why Chef just calls it "trout." I never want to eat trout any other way. We live in an area where dear husband catches a fair amount.... and this is our favorite recipe. When we have leftovers.... we make fish tacos. The browned butter sauce is key!

Perfect! I’ve drizzled butter and lemon juice on trout before, but for some reason preparing a sauce this way is way better!  So good!

If I need a recipe I always check Chef John first- his recipes are always fantastic. I had never cooked trout, and rarely cook fish so this was the perfect recipe to start out with. So quick, easy and brought out the natural flavor of the fish without anything else getting in the way.

It turned out okay. I made the recipe accordingly but I should have adjusted the amount due to I only had two trouts  filet and not two whole trouts. It was a little bit to much lemon juice. I will definitely try and remake this dish. I will half the ingredients. Also I tried what the lady suggested about the skin, it did not work.

I am not very good in the kitchen and have never made trout before. This recipe is so easy and it was good!! I added oregano and rosemary to season the fillets before cooking. I also added garlic to the butter sauce. I think next time I will add more lemon - just my taste preference. Instead of baking, I wrapped in foil and grilled 3-5min each side.

We had a 2lb fillet so it required more than double the cooking time but the fish was perfect and not super fishy tasting. Chef John never steers is wrong. We will definitely be trying this on other fish as well as trout again.

Amazing recipe! And amazingly simple. The only thing to watch out for is over-cooking the parsley—add it to the butter sauce immediately before serving. If you add it at end and then let the sauce sit, it will wilt and turn brown. Consider sprinkling the parsley raw over the fish at the end, then pour the sauce over it to avoid over-cooking....

I didn't make substitutions, but next time I would cut back on the amount of butter for the sauce by at least half, to 1/4 cup or even 1/8th cup.

Excellent. Rainbow trout doesn’t need much because it’s already delicious, so this was a perfect little light marinade.

Excellent recipe! My hubby and 2 year old son are VERY picky eaters. They both cleaned their plates and asked for seconds! I used flounder (only fish on hand). A definite keeper!

After melting the butter, I seasoned with salt and pepper and a couple teaspoons lemon, and dipped/flipped the fish before adding crushed Saltines to the top, fresh ground pepper and some parsley. My family said it was the best trout I ever made!

I really liked this recipe and will make it again. My family is not found of fish but said it was good but too much lemon.  Could've been my fault since I eye ball a lot of measurements.  I thought it was wonderful. Very easy. Love the browned butter.

Delicious - cut the butter in half, added double lemon and a sprig of Rosemary on each side. This is a great recipe and it was so easy!

Easy and delicious - the whole family loved it and are asking me to send them the link. We didn't have any parsley, so we chopped up fresh basil instead. Amazing.

Very easy fish dish. I had a thick filet of trout and it needed more than 10 minutes under the broiler. The butter /lemon sauce added a fresh lemony flavor to the fish.

Very nice! After watching the video, I think I browned the butter too much, but it was still delightful. The balance of the butter and the fresh squeezed lemon juice and the freshly picked parsley was wonderful. Instead of salt and pepper we used a salt free lemon pepper.  We used a 1.5 pound rainbow trout fillet, so it ended up taking about 10 minutes to cook. We will be making this again.

I did not make any changes nor will I.  I do not cook fish very often but with recipes like this I probably will do.  Very flaky and cooked perfectly with these directions and ingredients.  We loved it.

Used fresh skinned and deboned Norh Carolina Mountain trout pieces, as well as dried parsley and dried dill and bottled Lemon juice (because that's what we had on hand) and it was excellent for both the regular trout eater and the non-regular trout eater. Incredibly easy and tasty! This recipe is a keeper.

easy and tasty.  I had to cook 6 to 8 minutes.  my fish must have been thicker. I used lime and cilantro to go better with the Pico de gallo/avocado salad I made.

Very tasty, very easy.  Next time I think I will have hubby remove the skin though or buy trout fillets.

The first time I made trout I used this recipe and haven't looked for another. It's so simple and flavorful that it makes the perfect bite! I add a few chopped capers sometimes for a little extra to complement the lemon.

Very simple recipe that went over well. A little bland for my own taste but everyone ate it so no complaints there!
