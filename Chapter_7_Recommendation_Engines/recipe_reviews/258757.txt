This is an update to my previous review.  If you have a blender, mix it in there for a while.  Also, the Maria cookie folks have a recipe for this which also calls for 4 oz cream cheese at room temperature, and that should do the trick!

5.1.18  Recipe directions tell you to “cut into squares.”  I left this in the fridge overnight, and it never firmed up.  The recipe tells you to beat with an electric mixer until “well blended,” which I did, not until you reach a certain consistency.  Layering this dessert was impossible because the Maria cookies floated to the top.   It would seem to me that the milk mixture would need to be thicker for this to work.  The cookies taste good and that's the only reason I'm giving this a 2-star rating, but the milk mixture all puddled at the bottom of the dish, just runny.  Sorry for the bad review, but I don’t see how I could have made a mistake in preparing this dessert, simply because of the simplicity of the recipe, but this was a failure for me.
