Pretty tasty stuff.  I didn't blend this and really can't see why you'd have to.  Just throw it into a ziploc bag and mix is up.  I cut the marinade in half because I had just two steaks.  I used a bunch of minced garlic instead of garlic powder and also skipped on the hot sauce.  I ended up letting it sit in the fridge with the steaks (top sirloin) for about 3 hours.  When it was time to make dinner, I took the steaks out of the bag and then threw in 8 ounces of sliced mushrooms until they were well coated and dropped all of that into a pan.  I cooked the mushrooms until most of the liquid was cooked out on medium high heat.  Grilled the steaks to medium rare, then served the mushrooms on top!  Turned out very flavorful and very delicious.  Thanks!

This marinade was amazing.  I really wasn't sure about the ingredients (didn't want teriyaki type), and decided to take a chance based upon the ratings.  Boy, was I glad I did.  The steaks ended up marinating 3 days (due to changes in plans).  They were so tender, and the taste... fabulous.  This marinade is very subtle, it really enhances the meat well.  I didn't have parsley, so I added a dash of thyme.  My DH was extremely happy with the taste, and wants me to use this recipe again and again.
***UPDATE***-I wanted something different for Christmas dinner for 15 people, this was my choice, and everyone raved about how flavorful and tender the steaks were (we used flat iron steaks).  I brought the steaks home from the store, fixed the marinade, popped them in the freezer for about a week, then defrosted them Christmas Eve.  My DH put them on the BBQ to cook, YUMMM!  On a busy day, it was an effortless, but outstanding main dish.

The best marinade that I have ever used. I was very skeptical, aspecially after I blended it. It did not look like it would taste good but it was really really good. I used top sirloin. Highly reccommend this recipe

Steak purist as he is, hubs preferred his steak without this marinade and didn't use it.  In hindsight I wish I would have followed suit. Thank goodness l at least used fresh garlic, but I think both the lemon juice and hefty amount of garlic powder contributed a strong, "off flavor," as one reviewer put it, that I just didn't care for - not so sure I liked the basil either.  It was fun to experiment, but it would have been so much easier and so much better to have just stuck with the simple steak seasonings we're accustomed to.  When something is really good, like a good quality steak, it simply doesn't need anything to make it better.

I don't know if this is "THE BEST" steak marinade, but it comes in close.  I used this on two pretty large NY stips and it came out great!  I cut the olive oil down to 1/4 c. and used all minced garlic, no powders. I used 2 Tbsp. of dried basil and 1 Tbsp. of oregano.  I didn't have white pepper, so I used 1/2 tsp. of black pepper.  I put everything into a ziplock bag and let it marinate all day.  Perfect with a baked potato and salad!

Very good marinade.  I only had garlic salt, and it was a mistake to use it.  The garlic salt made the marinade too salty, definitely make sure you use garlic powder as the resipe calls for!  Otherwise the flavor was pretty great!

This is good, but I have been doing the "exact ingredients for over 20 years. You "do not" need to blend ingredients in a blender at all. In fact, if, after tasting "mixture", it seems "to strong for your taste buds", just an a little water to it.". I also always add "a little oil or canola oil" to the mixture(it depends how much you make, but "at least a tablespoon". It tenderizes the steak/pork/or venison" meat, and gives the flames on the grill a chance to "dance upward", giving those nice "charred lines>

I also use both powered garlic and real garlic. I subsitute lemon juice with "rice flavored vinegar or wine vinegar. Be sure "not to over due the acidic ingredients(lemon or vinegars)If you have "fresh basil leave handy, instead of dry..even better. I always "freeze "fresh basil leaves" in a ziploc baggie, to have handy in the house. Just crush the leaves once from, grab a handful to add to your "marinades or pasta sauces. Makes a "huge difference in flavor.
Sometimes, instead of "soy", I'll use Terriyaki sauce instead, or sometimes "a little of each". Especially with "pork tenderloins. Even throw in chopped green onions. Once you are "comfortable making your own marinades, "the "skys the limit". You also , if a tender cut of meat(like pork or beef or venison tenderloin", do not have to marinate "more than a half hour".  Marinades will stay in a glass jar up to a week, if you do not have time to do it "daily". I send up a batch with my husband went he goes hunting

Excellent Marinade. I actually didn't add the last 4 ingredients. I didn't have parsley flakes & just forgot the pepper. I marinated 4 large Ribeyes for about 4-5 hours and the steaks were delicious, best I've ever cooked. My husband took one of the steaks to work 2 days later and microwaved it for lunch. He was concerned that it might be dry or tough and said it tasted even better. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

The problem with marinades that are intensely acidic is that they make the surface of the meat mushy, gray, and resistant to browning.   I have made a version of this marinade with only a tablespoon of lemon juice and the zest of one lemon for flavor, and the texture was markedly better.  I also used fresh herbs, as dried herbs have an off flavor.  I would not suggest anybody use a third of a cup of lemon juice, as the acid does not actually tenderize the meat past the first few millimeters of the surface, which becomes waterlogged and broken down by the acid.

This marinade was simply wonderful. We have been cutting back on expesnses in our home, which includes not eating out. I have been doing by best to deliver resturant quality dishes so that no one gets board. This did not fail! My fiance just raved over it. The only thing I changed was that a few mintues before the meat was done cooking, I sprinkled a little bit of turbanado sugar on the meat to balance the salt. It was to die for! By the way, although you dont have have to blend the ingredents together with a processor, I hightly recommend it. This really allows the flavors to mix, the herbs to be ground (which increased the flavor of any herb) and the oil to be infused with the flavors of this marinade. Dont hesitated to try this one!

This really is one of the best meat marinades I've come across in over 30 of cooking.  I have used it on steaks, roasts, pork and chicken with wonderful results every time.  I have never blended it, rather just whisk the ingredients together in a glass bowl.  The copy I made of this recipe is actually worn out from so much use!  A friend is a NC BBQ pit master and he uses it frequently.  No better endorsement than a pro!

I never really eat steak, but that's what my mom wanted for mother's day. I don't really have anything to compare it to because I've never marinated steak before! It was very easy to put together...I skipped the blender part and just mixed it in a bowl, put the steaks in ziploc bags and poured the marinade in. Mom said "this marinade is delicious!" so it looks like I did good. Once the steaks were on the grill I poured the excess into a pan with some mushrooms, butter, and a little cornstarch and served that on top the steaks. That was the best part. Don't throw out that extra marinade!!

I'm afraid I was just a bit disappointed by this marinade. Still, at 4 stars, it was pretty good. I definitely agree that the ingredients should be mixed in a blender so they are uniform. This also makes the marinade very thick so it sticks to the meat extremely well - but this is part of the problem. Because of its thickness, even after grilling there is so still much marinade coating the meat that it is overpowering - the flavor of the meat gets lost in the marinade. So, the solution is simple - make sure you wipe most of the marinade off before you cook the meat! With this one addition to the directions, it might have gotten 5 stars from me.

I just put the ingredients in a ziploc bag, add the meat and squeeze out the air. Blending isn't necessary. I often do several steaks at a time and pop the bags in the freezer so the meat is ready for the grill on short notice. This is very flavorful and especially good on kabobs and London Broil. I've used this recipe for a few years and it's become the "house marinade" because it's never failed to tenderize a piece of beef or generate a compliment. It can be tweaked for variety's sake and doesn't require exact measurements. A tip of the hat to you Kookie!

I used this marinade for two big juicy ribeye steaks.  Neither me nor my fiance cared for it that much.  With all the soy sace, lemon juice and worchestershire it made the meat very sour and almost made it taste rancid.  I was a little disappointed in how many ingredients I wasted to make it.  I think maybe if the measurements were right, with a little tweaking, this could be a good recipe.  Maybe using fresh herbs instead of dried would be better as well.  Overall, it needs some work.

When I made this the first time, I definitely had my doubts. It looked like baby diarrhea, but I saw how many ratings there were and I decided to go ahead anyway!! WOW!!! I was very surprised. My girlfriend thinks I'm a Genius!! (Sorry... I'm not telling her I found it online!!) Way to go!! Keep adding more recipes. You make my cooking look really good! Thanks Kookie!

This is the last time I'm going to ruin a perfectly good steak with a marinade.  I used this on New York Strip steaks tonight and was thoroughly disappointed.  In my opinion, a good steak only needs a little bit of salt and some pepper, so I'm promising my husband and myself that I'll never use a marinade on good meat again!

So I made a steak for the first time ever today (I'm only 22, give me a break).  I used Allrecipes to find a good steak recipe since I had no idea what to do, except that I was going to pan-fry it.  This marinade came up on top of the ratings list.  I used the hot sauce and extra garlic, and the only thing I changed was I used minced garlic instead of the garlic powder (didn't have powder), and used italian seasoning instead of the basil (once again didn't have basil).  This turned out amazing!  I can only imagine how much better it would've been if I was more experienced cooking steak!  Definitely recommending this one to friends and family.  Thanks for posting it!

Not even close.  This is not only NOT the best marinade in existence, but really substandard.  The use of both of the garlics gives it a heavy aftertaste.  The basil is, well not really sure why it's there.  And the lemon juice adds an odd tangy note totally unlike anything else in the marinade.  Perhaps substituting a wine instead of lemon juice for the acidity requirement might bind the whole thing together.

This did not work at all for me.  Sorry to say.

THIS HAS TO BE THE BEST MARINADE IN THE WORLD! 

Marinaded for 6 hours- Turn the Grill on HIGH and with the lid down get the inside temp to 400, (wait untill its up there), sear the meat on all sides opening and the lid to to check and flip. When seared or blackened to desired crust, turn the grill on LOW to cool it, untill the temperature gets down to about 275 or 300. When the grill cools down you can  close the lid and cook the meat turning occasionally until the  inside temperature of the meat is to the desired temperature.  (150 is good) Take the meat out on plate cover with a dish cloth for about 10 min to let the meat rest. Nothing else needed. 

This is the marinade I chose to use for the tenderloins at the company picnic.There were 3 tenderlions about 3 lbs each, 9 lbs total. I doubled the recipe for the marinade.

I used both the minced garlic and the powdered garlic. Don't use 'Salt Garlic'. And for the 'Lemon Juice' I used 'Real Lemon' in the bottle. 

I used 'Black Pepper', not the white because I like how it crusts. And for the hot sauce I used 'Red Pepper' powder.  The hot pepper boost serves to balances the spices it does not make the meat hot at all..

I used 'Extra Virgin Olive Oil' because it has more flavor.  I wanted to stretch the recipe so I added about 1/3 cup more oil.  

I split marinade up into three plastic zippos, threw a tenderloin in each one.  Marinaded it in the frig, turning the bag over a few times over a 6 hour period.

If you're using this do NOT let it marinade for more than a few hours. I let it marinade over night and it was horribly strong. No one in my house could choke it down. I'm not brave enough to try again with less marinade time.

I have used this same recipe for over 15 years with one change. My recipe calls for a 1/4 cup of mustard. I prefer a grainy dijon but any will work and each will subtly change the marinade's flavor. I have even used horseradish and what a kick that gives. I also will marinade tougher cuts for 12 to 14 hours and the lemon juice makes them very tender. It also works very well as an injection sauce but must be very well blended. JC3

This was great. I used 3 fresh garlic cloves, sirracha sauce and added a little dijon mustard as another reviewr did. I mixed this in my food processor and it gave the marinade a great texture....one that I dont think I could have acheived by just srtiring with a spoon.  I marinated 2 ribeyes for 22 hours. The steaks came out so juicy. I had reserved some of the marinade and heated it up to drizzle on as I served the steak. It was wonderful. This ones a keeper for us!!

I'm sorry, but I really didn't like this marinade, found it too overpowering.  The taste of the meat was not there anymore, all I could taste was the marinade and I marinaded it for less than an hour.  My husband took a bite of the meat and just left the rest on the plate.

VERY VERY VERY GOOD! I followed the recipe exactly. I tried the marinade before marinating my 2 filet mignon steaks and I wasn't impressed at all. It tasted like seasoned worcestershire sauce to me. Anyway I let my 2 steaks marinate for 4 hours, cooked it on each side for 3 minutes, added the remaining sauce to mushrooms like another commenter suggested, sauteed and served on top. DELICIOUS!!!! The marinade combined with the steak WAS DIVINE!!!! My bf and I couldn't get enough!!! Believe me, DO NOT get discouraged if you try the marinade by itself, you will NOT regret making this. AMAZING!!!! Great Job Kookie!!

Omit the lemon juice and you have a really good marinade.  The acidity of a lemon really takes away from the flavor of a nice cut of meat.

I had to try this recipe because of all the rave reviews and I thought for sure I had a winner but was very displeased with the end product. The steaks (Ball Tips) came out super tender but the flavor was all wrong for my family and I.  The flavor was too over powering!  They were uneatable. 
This is the third bomb in as many weeks. My sweet hubby, who is a awesome cook, is getting sick of me "experimenting" on my family especially when they end up leaving the dinner table still hungry on ‘my dinner nights’.  If I keep this pace up I just might end up getting fired from my dinner nights.

I decided to try this after seeing some good reviews. It makes quite a bit of marinade, but I did two large flank steaks with it in two separate bags. I followed the directions, except I cut the basil in half as I ran out. I used low-sodium soy sauce, and would definitely suggest that. It is quite salty, from the soy sauce, even using that substitution. I also did add the optional ingredients. At first bite I thought it had a strong taste of the basil, but the more I ate it, the more I liked it. The only downside, is it actually over-tenderized. I never thought that was possible. I broiled my flank steak, as usual, and it was so tender I almost had trouble cutting it. I would definitely use this for a tough, less flavorful, cut of meat as the marinade does have very strong flavor. It would mask a good steak, in my opinion. For some reason, I could see men liking this though.

Excellent marinade.  Basically a salt & pepper & olive oil man at time of grilling, but on tougher cuts, properly scored or with use of tenderizer tool, and on a roast, it is absolutely delicious for taste and moisture retention when left to rest.  Very good.  I prefer a little chipolte seasoning to the pepper sauce, and the fresh garlic.  a very good 5 star + marinade, thank you,  I usually prefer my home made rubs, but this was very very good.

Tried recipe at home with flank steak. Used all ingredients except parsley flakes because I couldn't find in my pantry (it'll probably turn up now that I don't need it!). Marinated overnight in fridge. Let meat come to room temp before tossing on a screaming hot BBQ grill. 4 minutes each side gave me perfectly medium rare steaks. I'm going to try lime instead of lemon (or both) next time. It was a big hit with everybody. Thanks for sharing this!

This marinade is okay.  After cooking the only flavors that stand out are the soy sauce and lemon juice.  I have had much better, and will most likely not use this one again.

I've read a lot of reviews were people substituted this or that, well for me, I always try a recipe as written first, before I decide to substitute, add, delete, etc.

There is nothing I would change about this recipe!!  I tried this for the first time on a day I was having my family, and an old Navy buddy who was passing through town, over for grilled steaks and boiled shrimp.  I wanted to do something different with the steaks, and I found this recipe and tried it.  I doubled the recipe because I had 8 steaks, and put them on to marinate about 10:00pm to go on the grill at 4:00pm the next day.

There was not a single bite of steak left on ANYONE's plate, and all were raving about how flavorful and tender the steaks were.  (I use a gas grill) My Navy friend took a photo of the recipe on his way out so he could have it when he got home.  He sent me pictures of the baby back ribs and chicken he was grilling after marinating them in this stuff, and said they both came out fantastic!

So thanks Kookie for sharing this!  It's phenomenal just the way it is, and I really can't picture myself seasoning a steak any other way anymore.  Heck, I may even marinate some rib eyes just to see how great it will make them taste!

This is a really great marinade.  It has wonderful flavor, tenderizes the meat, and goes well with most cuisines.  My only complaint is that it's a but salty- so I don't use as much soy sauce.

Simple and good.  I used this to marinade a london broil for 24 hours before grilling.  The flavor is not super-strong but it's good and tenderizes the meat.  I poured the ingredients into a large Ziploc and just kneaded them around, instead of blending.

Great marinade! No need for the bottle of sauce! I marinated some steaks all day for the 4th of July weekend, grilled them up and everyone loved it, they were so tender! I made it as directed (yes, blending it up) and have made this a few times since, it's that good!

This is just perfect.  I use it all the time for steak in stir-fry recipes, and last night I used it for grilling a big slab of beef.  My husband was literally moaning at how delicious it was.

I do substitute 2 cloves fresh garlic, pressed, for the garlic powder.

Better than steaks we have had in New York, Chicago, or even Las Vegas's best.  We did change lime juice for lemon and use real minced garlic rather than powder. Also added fresh ground black pepper. Have tried both blended and not blended, blending does seem to mix everything together better but is not required. Everyone we have made this for goes crazy about how good the steaks are with this. You really just can't go wrong with this marinade. It lives up to its name and then some!

I was looking for a great steak marinade and decided to try this one - mistake!  Way too much basil - my kids wouldn't eat it.  I think some aspects of this marinade are good.  I'll try it again, using much less or maybe totally omitting the basil.

I don't typically write reviews but thought this deserves mention.  This marinade was a hit and very quick and easy to make.  We all very much enjoyed it and I will definitely make it again.  Thanks!

This marinade smelled so yummy I couldn't wait to try it! I was sooo disappointed. None of me kids liked it either. We had to drench the meat in bbq sauce to drown out the flavor of this marinade. Will NOT make again! Definatly not kid friendly recipe!

I have made this 2 times already.  The first was on steak, then the second was on pork chops.  For a 3rd time this month, I am using it once again on chicken.  

My family loves this recipe and is a keeper.  Minor changes : (1)I don't blend it, I just use a whisk and whisk it really good before I put it in a ziplock bag. (2)I do use the mince garlic, but it is fresh. We love garlic, so the more the merrier and (3) instead of 1 1/2 tablespoons of parsley, I just use 1 tablespoons since parsley can be strong. 

This recipe is a hit. Even with folks that don't care too much for the ingredients, but together and after grilled, they are amazing. I recommend everyone trying this.

Made as written, except didn't blend everything together and only marinated for 30 mins.  Would be even better overnight.  Definitely a keeper!

It was Great!! I left out the lemon juice and used fresh garlic. Instead of the of using pure olive oil i used garlic and basil infused. Also i used crushed red pepper. The steak was great! Using a blender really makes a difference.

This was just okay for us. Too strong, too salty, and bland. Perhaps I bought the worst kind of Soy Sauce on the market - I followed the recipe exactly. I'm sorry! I WILL try again with a different soy sauce.

This marinade was pretty good but I thought it was a little overpowering for a steak.  You couldn't even taste the natural flavor of the steak.  I think it has too much Worcestershire sauce in it.  I marinaded mine for about 4-5 hours.

Very good.  I'm a huge fan of using fresh ingredients so I used fresh garlic, parsley & basil as opposed to dried.  Marinated our Filet's in this for about 3 hours and they were tender and juicy.  Will definitely make again.

I'm going through and reviewing all the recipes I have tried and I can say I like this one.  I use far less olive oil because I really don't see the need.  I also use less lemon juice because it will "cook" the meat.  Not necessary to use only white pepper so I just used good old fashion fresh cracked black pepper (yumm).  Marinate with soy sauce, olive oil (2 tbsp), splash of lemon juice, Worcestershire, minced garlic, parsley and tsp cracked pepper.  NO NEED to blend in blender.  Just throw in a non-reactive bowl or baggie (my choice)  Marinate for at least 2 hours.  Take the out of baggie toss on grill as you normally would and they come out quite nice.

This marinade is delicious!! Instead of only marinating for an hour or so it turned into more like 24 hours due to a change in our plans. I was delighted that the marinade was so delicious. It literally turned our steaks into gourmet affair. I also sauteed some mushrooms and onions with the remaining marinade to go with the steaks. YUM!!!!

I think maybe the basil should have been 3 teaspoons instead of table spoons.  It really overpowered everything else, but I think this would be and excellent marinade with that correction, so 4 stars.

I used this marinade for a whole chicken.  I put a double batch of the marinade along with the lemon rinds in a ziploc bag with the chicken for 48 hours.  I removed the chicken and rinsed it off well, added the lemon rinds inside the cavity, seasoned with rotisserie chicken seasoning and baked.  So delicious!!  The white meat was extremely juicy and tender.  The flavor was great!

This recipe more than lives up to its name. I used bottled lemon juice instead of the fresh squeezed and omitted the hot pepper...it was still outstanding. All of our dinner guests were truly blown away by the flavor!

Doubled the recipe, but only used enough lemon juice for a single batch (Only had 2 lemons, and it wasn't enough, apparently).  Overall, it was very good!
UPDATE: I made it exactly as written, using a large pack of stewing beef that I softened with my meat tenderizer.  I poured the marinade over it & let it sit for about 30 min.  Then I made Shish-Kebabs with it.  I ised 1 large pack of stewing beef, 1 red pepper, 1 green pepper, and 1 red onion.  It made 22 delicious shish-kebabs!!

All I can say is "Yum"!  Our steak was delicious, tender, and so good!  I changed only one thing, and that was adding some onion powder as well as the garlic.  I highly reccommend this marinade!

Now this is some fantastic stuff!  The flavor of my first bite of my (grilled) New York strip reminded me of something you'd get at an upscale steak restaurant.  I'll definitely make this steak marinade again.

I thought this marinade was great but my husband thought it was, "too lemony."  So, if you have lemon-squeamish people around you, cut down on that ingredient a little bit!

This is a wonderful steak marinade.  It works wonders on the cheap tough cuts of supermarket steaks.  They always turn out moist, tender and delicious.

This was delicious! I added onion powder, shallots, minced onion, and chives to the marinade because I love onion flavor. I also reduced the amount of basil and worcestshire by half. I didn't throw it into a blender, because I didn't feel like cleaning an extra dish :) and it turned out fine. Will definitely put this into rotation! P.S. it's good on chicken as well. :)

This is good! I woke up a little late, so I only had an hour to marinate the meat, but this marinade still lent amazing flavor to our steaks. I didn't bother with the blending (dirty as few things as possible is always my rule in the kitchen), cut the oil to 2 T., and added a generous spoonful of minced fresh garlic instead of dry.

The marinade completely overwhelms the taste of the beef. It does tenderize but cannot recommend unless you want to disguise the meat - say, for lamb.

I didn't even measure I just put in all the ingredients except parsley and white pepper(I didn't have). I added red pepper flakes, black pepper and meat tenderizer and wet minced garlic and didn't blend. I just put it and the meat in a plastic bag in the fridge for a few hours. It turned out so good!!! Best steak marinade I have ever made!

This marinade recipe truly lives up to it's name, it is the best steak marinade I have made!  I used it marinate kabob's that I grilled, they were out of this world!  My only substitution was fresh garlic instead of powder.

I made some changes. I used 4 cloves of fresh Garlic, didn't have any Basil, but added 1Tblsp of dried Rosemary and a heaping Tsp of dried Sage.Very tasty, and I grilled fatty Sizzle Steaks over Charcoal. Was delicious!

It is indeed, very, very good.
As per another reviewers suggestion, after removing the meat, use the marinade with other veggies.   I added it to tin foiled packets of onions and mushrooms.  Amazing.

This may be my personal preference, but I found the basil way too strong. It was all I could taste! Next time I think I'll try halfing the amount. I do feel like this recipe is onto something, however.

This is good if you like a strong, teriyaki flavour. I would say it's more suitable for chicken, rather than steak.

We've been using this marinade for YEARS! We don't add the hot pepper sauce. 

We use it on chicken! We marinade boneless, skinless chicken breasts and grill them on the bbq pit. We also take what's left of the marinade and boil it down on the stove, skimming off any fat off the top, and serve it as an au jus on the side. 

It's tangy and salty. We love it!

Great recipe and I only added one thing and that was because I didn't have enough Worcestershire sauce so I added some Teriyaki sauce instead. I left the chicken in the marinade for 5 hours and the flavor was out of this world. I might add that this was the most moist chicken that I have ever eaten!

Very good and very simple. Changed it up a bit and used fresh parsley and regular salt and pepper while the steaks cooked. Left out the hot pepper sauce and the minced garlic. Next time I would add chopped fresh garlic too. Otherwise, my son ate it and loved it. That's my real test right there!

Incredible! Didn't have fresh lemon juice so I just used the bottled kind, and had black pepper so I used that instead of white. Didn't had the optional ingredients and this was definitely the most flavorful steak ever!

I made the marinade exactly as instructed with the optional ingredients added and yes I used a blender (is it really that big a deal to blend it).   I marinated one 1.25 inch t-bone I bought from Publix (which are pretty good quality as far as grocery store steaks go) in a sealed container for almost 2 hours.  Then I rinsed off (yes rinsed off) the marinade from the meat and patted the steak dry with paper towels. Then I put approximately 1/4 teaspoon of kosher salt on each side and about a 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper on both sides and finally, liberal amounts of garlic powder infused with parsley on both sides.  Then I let the steak sit at room temp for a little over half an hour and broiled for 7 minutes a side for medium rare and it was outstanding! The marinade adds just a subtle hint of flavor that brings out the beef flavor nicely. No steak sauce needed at all.   This was SLIGHTLY better than my normal routine which is just using Moore's marinade for a half hour meat-bath prior to seasoning and cooking.  All in all this recipe is a winner!   I wouldn't marinate it for a long time like many posters have done, unless it was a sorry piece of meat.

This was a great marinade.  I omitted the white pepper by mistake, and the dried minced garlic because I was concerned it would put the garlic flavor over the top.  I cut the recipe down for one steak.  I didn't blend it.  Just combined the ingredients in a large ziplock bag.  I marinated a ribeye steak for just over an hour, and loved the result! I think it would have been ok after all with the minced garlic, but hubby said he liked it just as it was, without the pepper and minced garlic.  The flavors were balanced perfectly, and the marinade didn't overpower the meat.  I probably wouldn't want to marinate meat for more than a couple hours, or I think you'd lose the taste of the meat.  All in all, a great recipe, and I think this is going to be my standard marinade recipe.  Thanks for sharing your secret with the rest of us!

Taste great as written. Not a wham bam punch but more a beautiful layering of flavor through and through. Exceptional delicate blending of spices work very well together. Will keep this recipe forever.

Fantastic! I used 4 cloves of freshly minced garlic instead of the powder, finely chopped fresh basil, left out the parsley and hot pepper sauce. BTW, 1/3 cup lemon juice is about 2 lemons. Next time I will use a little less lemon, but there will definitely be a next time!

The closest thing I had to lemon juice was a bottle of Mike's Hard Limeade, so I used that instead.  It turned out great! LOL.... Used this to marinate cubes of sirloin steak for shish kabobs.  Also dipped the veggies in it too (mushrooms, green peppers, yellow squash and cherry tomatoes) before threading them on the skewers.  Grilled till done.  Very delicious!!!

I marinaded a top round flank for about 10 hours and it was wonderful. The only change I made was to use only 1 tbsp of the dried basil as I was afraid hubby would taste too much of it.  Wonderful marinade, next time I'll opt for overnight or longer. Thanks for a great one Kookie!

My parents use a very similar marinade, except they also throw in some red wine vinegar and dry mustard, and omit the basil and hot pepper sauce. And the garlic is NOT optional. They use their marinade for a skewer feast--all sorts of veggies, steak, chicken, shrimp and scallops. Mmmmm... Everything gets marinated overnight, and it tastes so good the next night right off the grill.

Perfect! It didn't overpower the meat, while still giving it great flavor. It didn't burn or flare up on the grill, and there wasn't any 'burnt herb taste' that I sometimes get with herb-y marinades. Now, I did mistakenly write down 'oregano' instead of parsley... But I won't be correcting that anytime soon. Marinated for 6 hours, and it was juicy and tender. Fantastic with Hasselback Potatoes and fresh salad. Thank you very much!

My husband and I loved it! It completely penetrated the meat but still left the steak flavor. I actually cut the recipe in half because I was only marinated 1 steak. Will definitely use again!!

This s a great recipe. This is the basis for a quik marinade in most my cooking. Reading the recipe only shown what I've done but never actually wrote down. :) I'm big into going threw the cuboards and adding what I find that will work well together and I usually have all these ingredients. I usually add a litle bit of brown sugar and/or paprika to help the outside of my meats get that nice texture when flavoring. I notice reviews that have few stars saying why ruin steaks. And I agree, if you are cooking a steak to eat it as is, but if your ooking steak to add to salad, stir fry, soup, rice and beans, etc, you want to add some flavor and depth and this type of marinade does just that. I stick with as much fresh as I can get or that I at least have in my pantry. Fresh garlic is a must, and fresh lemon juice with some of the peel grated up helps this marinade really take shape and add freshness to it. Something you will never get in a container. Ever try jarred minced garlic? the stuff that looks fresh in oil or water or what ever it's kept in. Has the taste of garlic but it's bitter and missing the depth, and full experience. It's non sense! Anyways I'm done rambling thought I'd share some knowledge :)

I let my sirloins marinate in this for well over 24 hours and I must say it was one of the best tasting steaks we have ever had.  I made this exactly as written, blender and everything.  Every single one of us gobbled every bite last night and I am STILL in the mood for it again.  Another reviewer mentioned they were timid about it being like a Teriyaki-type sauce but I didn't get that at all.  I can't describe exactly what it reminded me of, I just know it was fabulous.  EDITED on March 4, 2015: If you can tell me a better marinade, please e-mail me @ louisvillehugger@yahoo.com.  Thanks.  I have been using this ever since I found it.  We eat more steak because of this marinade.

In general I like the marinade, but I think there are a few things that could be improved. I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil, I think this is better for bringing out other flavors in the marinade. I used 4 cloves minced garlic, 1 teaspoon of gochujang (you can also use sriracha for something milder). I also added a teaspoon of grated fresh ginger, 1 tbsp of honey, and sliced green onions. I did not use parsley or basil. Whisked the marinade instead of blending.

I was looking for a marinade to use with some top sirloins I had to make a steak salad. I used this recipe with great success. I added all the ingredients but hot sauce and minced garlic, but I changed the amounts of many ingredients after looking at the list. To marinate just a few small steaks it would make way too much marinade, and I thought the amounts were a little off. I halved the soy sauce and olive oil. I used only about a teaspoon of bottled lemon juice, same amount worchestershire, same amount garlic, about 1 t basil, and 1 t parsley, and a dash of pepper. I didn't blend, just added to the bag my steaks were in and let it marinate for 2 1/2-3 hours, then grilled on the BBQ. The marinade was a great way to make a cheap cut of steak taste great. I think my tweaking and reduced marinating time made the flavor perfect and not overpowering. It worked perfectly in the salad. I won't use this for nice cuts (all those need is salt) but it will be my go-to for the tougher and less-expensive cuts from now on.

Great flavor, easy to make. I probably wouldn't use this for a super high quality steak where I'd want the flavor of the meat to shine through though. Marinated for about 2 hours and was a touch on the salty side; definitely use less soy sauce if you plan to marinate for a long time (overnight, etc.).

I made this exactly as the recipe calls for and it is fantastic.  I even brought the used marinade to a boil on the stove while the steaks were cooking and put a teaspoonful over the meat when served. I wouldn't bother to do this again because the meat is beautifully seasoned.

Awesome marinade. I didn't put ingredients in the blender. I mixed in a large bowl and then placed cubes of meat and put in the fridge for about 6 hours then put them on skewers and grilled them. Yummy. The kids are already asking me to make them again.

This marinade is incredible! I used it on a few pan fry steaks while cooking for my parents and our six children this past weekend. The meat didn't marinate but for a scant 30 minutes (we were running late with our lunch plans). Nevertheless, the meat still tasted amazing and I'll definitely be trying this again when I have more time to let it soak up that wonderful flavor!

I give this recipe 4 stars because like others have said, it needs some changes.  The first time I made it exactly as written, except with fresh basil and fresh garlic (I always use fresh when I can) and found the basil and soy sauce over-powering.  It was too salty!  The second time, I omitted the soy sauce completely and reduced the basil - it was still not quite there.  Now I substitute balsamic vinegar (1/8 of a cup) instead of any soy sauce.  I also add 1 tsp. white pepper, 1 tsp. mustard powder, 5 cloves of fresh garlic, 1 tbsp Frank's Red Hot (I like a bit of heat) and 2 tbsp. Montreal steak spice - I know, I shouldn't have to add the Montreal steak spice, but with it actually seems to really enhance all the other flavors and make a good thing even better.  I use the juice of one lemon and haven't noticed an "off-flavor" as others have put it.  But I personally like lemon and it probably cuts a bit of the salt from the Worcestershire sauce and the Frank's Red Hot. I gave this 4 stars even though I make a lot of changes, because this recipe was the springboard for me to find something that works for me.  I have marinated New York strip steak overnight and they are melt-in-your-mouth tender.  I have done 24 hours and 9 hours and 5 hours - I am in the "longer is better" club because I find the 24 hours to be awesome.  Do the ziplock bag and shake it every 3 hours during the day just to get all the flavors combined.  :D

I have made this quite a few times and think the best was when I did puree it in the food processor. It must just "blend" the flavors better.

My guys raved over this! I really like a teriyaki type taste which this is not but it was a nice change. I made it exactly as written and I do think that putting it in the blender was an important step.  It helped combine the flavors better. From now on, I think I'll put any marinade with solid ingredients (garlic, dried spices, etc) in the blender.

Excellent.  Used this for flank steak (what I had on hand) and really tenderized the meat.  I grilled the meat and boiled the excess marinade on the stove for 5 minutes.  The marinade because a thick and delicious sauce!

Turned out yummy.  I was really skeptical with all the basil but it was good, my steak was super tender which was most important because I am pregnant and need to eat my steak well done, and this marinade made me still able to enjoy it.

This was really tasty, and my family agreed.  I just whisked all the ingredients together and poured into a plastic bag with flank steak for about 24 hours.  The aroma while grilling was very nice - will definitely use this again and try it on chicken, too.  Thanks for the amazing recipe!

This was pretty good. I had no idea how much I would need for the meat I made...guess I should have read the recipe better :P So next time I'll half the recipe for sure. The only change I made was to use 1/8 tsp cayenne instead of hot sauce. I didn't blend, just mixed together. Then I let it sit in the fridge for about 4 hours.

I used Teriyaki sauce instead, and didn't add the optional ingredients or the basil. Still came out so delicious. My boyfriend and I both thought it was out of the world, having really rescued a couple crappy pieces of steaks. Just, so delicious.

This is truly the "Best Steak Marinade" ever! My husband recently got dentures and had such difficulties adjusting to them. I used this marinade recipe (substituting lemon juice with 1/3 C of wine, and eliminating the hot pepper sauce) on a rib-eye steak. I pricked the meat with a large fork, poured on a portion of the marinade over the steak and marinated the meat for about 3 hours. He really eat up his steak!!! Now I keep this marinade in the fridge for the next time I use it on steak. Thanks, Kookie, for sharing this recipe.

Delicious and flavorful!  I'll definitely make this again, but like another reviewer said, I'll reduce the amount of soy sauce to a 1/4 cup because this marinade is a little on the salty side.  I marinated 2 boneless sirloins for only 3 hours (because my mouth was watering and I couldn't wait any longer!) and the flavor was incredible.  I didn't use the optional minced garlic or hot sauce.  The steaks burst with so much flavor, you don't even need them.

Yes, this IS the best. Outside of using minced garlic instead of garlic powder and cutting it in half for only two of us, I followed the recipe completely. The meat (cheap cut, but I can't remember exactly what it was) marinated for 24 hours and was cooked in a Foreman grill. It was wonderful and we'll use this method again. Thanks for the post!

This truly is the best steak marinade. I've made it twice so far, once on the grill and once for the sear/bake method and both have turned out wonderfully. Never have lemon juice so I omitted that and I use black pepper, but everything else basically stays the same. I do add a little more soy sauce and Worcestershire to my tastes.

I made this as written only to find out that it was enough for many steaks.  I put some in a container and froze it for another time.  It is tasty.  I kept flipping it over in the plastic bag to make sure that it coated all of the sides of the meat.

This is a really good marinade. I imagine it would be evn better if I used a good piece of meat, rather than a bad cut.

Honestly,it was just ok.I expected this to top my current favorite recipe on this site,GRILLED DELMONICO STEAKS, because it had fewer reviews than this recipe but unfortunately there wasn't much flavor here.I followed it exact except I used 2 tablespoons of minced garlic,1/2 cup of onions and no hot sauce and marinated them overnight.

This was an excellent marinade that I will be sure to use in the future. We grilled some kabobs after marinading the meat in this, and the family loved it! Even my little picky eaters had their fill. Thanks for posting the recipe! I might try it with some chicken and add a little honey!

Wow, this is good marinade.  I did sub Montreal Steak seasoning for the blackpepper and salt.  I hate to admit it but I think this marinade will replace my "old faithful" steak marinade.

Delicious! Thanks for the incredible recipe. Last week we tried a couple NY Strips with a store bought Mesquite marinade and although the flavor was good, the steaks were tough (a usual problem for us because we like our steaks medium well). This week we used the same kind of steaks with this marinade and wow, what a difference, the steaks were much more tender and flavorful. The marinade and steak flavors really knock your socks off and remind you why beef is so wonderful!

We enjoyed this and will make again.  There are better out there.  This one is different enough to keep using, but not going to take over the "go to" marinade.  I only got to marinate for about 8 hours as that was what time permitted.  Thanks.

Mouth-watering.  I marinated sirlion steak, then grilled it and sliced it in thin strips and made a steak salad by putting in on top of romaine lettuce and some other salad veggies.

This was delicious!  The only thing that I would add is maybe some salt or garlic salt.  I didn't put any hot sauce in it but I did add some fresh minced garlic (instead of the dried).  Excellent!

Mmmmm WELL ... it definitely had flavor, and my boyfriend ate up his portion and loved it. :o)   I should have choosen a better cut.... I used a Top Round, marinaded for 24 hours.  Lots and lots of good flavor here in this marinade, just not exactly what I was looking for though.

Not sure if it was the BEST I've ever had, but it was pretty good. I used some extra tenderizing worstechire sauce and let the steak marinate in the mixture overnight. Made the steak have a good flavor.

Yum yum! This was so tasty and smelled so good. I marinated 1lb boneless short ribs for 4 hours and had my husband grill them on the barbecue. They were so juicy and moist! I followed the recipe exactly, except I added about 1tsp cayenne pepper flakes and the only thing that would change is to add more. Love the spicy!

This is a great recipe though I never have white pepper to use or parsley flakes! I made this twice and both times used oregano instead of parsley and balsamic vinegar instead of worcestershire sauce. So in reality I never really tried this exact recipe! LOL! But my guests loved it just as much as we loved it! We used flat iron steak as another reviewer and must say its probably the best cut of meat for this! I am a huge fan of flat iron steak ever since!

This was incredible! I only marinated the steak for 4 hours (maybe) and my husband loved it! He took it to a cook out and they were all envious that his new york strip steak looked and smelled incredible!   Adapted: Black pepper instead of white Fresh minced garlic instead of dried Mrs. Dash instead of garlic powder  To speed up the marinated, try vaccum sealing the ziplock bag or pushing all of the air out!

This is the best and especially for tougher cuts of meat!  We marinate overnight, too.

I only had 1 hr to marinate but it still gave the meat good flavor.  I will use this again and next time will let the steak marinate all day.  I substituted A1 for the Worcestshire sauce since I didn't have any.

Yes indeed... it is the best steak marinade ever.  It can make any cut taste like a top of the line cut of beef.  My son who always needs steak sauce did not use it once he tried steak with this marinade.

My husband LOVED this marinade! I left the steak in the marinade for two days, it was little too strong for my mother that way, but my husband and I loved the extra flavor. Will definitely make this again!

Did exactly as the recipe called for and I honestly wasn't that impressed. Not a whole lotta flavor and didn't tenderize the steaks at all, will choose a different recipe next time.

I have been using a similar recipe for years:   terriyaki or low sodium soy sauce; olive oil, 1 cup red wine (Merlot/Cab Sauv, etc), Worcs. Sauce, crushed garlic, 1-2 T of Moore's Seasoning; prepare the beef first by rubbing in a mixture of salt, fresh ground black pepper, dill seed, coriander seed, paprika, garlic; marinate for 1-8 hours; prepare the beef/steak and reserve the marinade; sautee fresh mushrooms & garlic in 1-2 T olive oil, add marinade; reduce heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes until rendered and consistency is just right!  Serve Steak w/ Mushrooms in Wine Sauce.   Yum!  (For chicken or pork, I use a white wine - Chardonnay, etc) with everything else the same.

Thanks Kookie, excellent recipe.  I only made one little change and added a clove of fresh minced garlic instead of dried, everything else I followed to the letter.  Mmmmmmm.

Made two rib eye steaks (big ones) with this marinade last night and it was the best steak I have ever made. I left out the hot sauce (not a fan) and lemon juice (on accident) and it was still fantastic. I pan seared the steaks in a cast iron skillet for about 6 minutes each side and then popped it in the oven for another 10 min to finish it off. Perfection! And made delicious cold leftovers also! I keep sneaking bites all day.

Gotta say I've tried lots of marinade recipes, and I don't know whether it was this or the cut of meat, but it had us moaning and groaning at the table!  Everyone agreed that the steak was perfect!

Awesome.  I added a bit of sugar because the marinate was a bit too sour.  Other than that,  everything was the same.  Thanks.

I have used this with chicken breast and soak them for three days. When I grilled the chicken, it was so tasty and it really didn't taste like normal chicken. So tender, and you didn't have to grill the meat very long as the marinate really cooks the meat. I did not put hot sauce.

Wow...  Wow...  Referencing an old Saturday Night Live bit... "it's (the steaks)  like butter"..   I had out of town guests come sorta unexpectedly to help us out w/car issues.  Since our local grocery store had a steal of a sale on Tbones, that's what I decided to serve.  Why marinade Tbones?  Cuz my sister-in-law insisted.  Boy am I glad she did!   I made this marinade and used it on the Tbones and ohmygawd... I could tell that pretty much everyone wanted to lick their plates!   My changes?  Well, I used fresh parsley, basil and garlic cuz I had them and since I had only half the Worchestersire sauce (how'd that happen?) I just added extra soy sauce and put in about 1 Tbsp of tomato paste substitute the missing Worch.  Anyway, yes, this is a keeper of a recipe - THANK YOU for being willing to share it with us when you know others are bound to take the credit for you/your family's recipe.  I promise to give credit where it's due - it's only fair consider what you shared with us.  EVERYONE should try this!  It is EXCELLENT!  No one touched the bottled steak sauces that usually get poured on.  A couple people added a little salt, other than that, they ate them as I served them off of the grill.  Again, thank you Kookie!!!  I'm going to try it with burgers, I'm sure it will work it's magic there, too!   Thanks again, Becky

Awesome!  I didn't have any soy sauce or olive oil, so I just used all Worchestershire sauce and canola oil. It was still really good, and now that I have the other ingredients, I will try it the exact way next time!  Thank you!

My parents have been making a very similar marinade as long as I can remember, and you're right - it's wonderfu!  My family's version adds about 4TB of brown sugar and 1/2 tsp of dry mustard - otherwise, it's identical.  The brown sugar makes for nice carmelization when the meat is grilled or broiled. We also usually use fresh garlic, but the nice thing about this recipe is it's pretty forgiving.  Thanks for posting!

This was amazing!  The smell had me right from the start.  I put all the ingredients in a large ziploc baggie then put the steaks in and let them sit in the fridge for almost two days.  We cooked them on the barbecue and they were fantastic!

Wow!  Very Delicious, I've been having a hard time to find just the right marinade and have tried quite a few.  This one is the best so far, my husband and I loved it.  Just in time for BBQ season :)  PS I've made this twice now, the first time I just wisked it all together and the second I liquified it in my blender..the blender was better seemed to thinker it up into a pastier consistancy. Thanks for the great recipe!

used this tonight on my anniversary dinner steaks... not very often i get to have a new york strip because they're just so expensive and i wanted it to be full of flavor without having to use steak sauce.... this did the trick.  used jar minced garlic instead of dried mince garlic... and i whisked it instead of using the blender.. only let it marinade for 2.5 hours roughly and brushed some on when grilling... very very yummy.  definitely using this again in the future.. and it smells incredible

A flavorful and delicious marinade! It's perfect as is, no changes needed, unless you want to (a) save a step and skip the blender AND (b) use fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder. You can mix all the ingredients together in a Ziploc bag and put the steaks inside. A wonderful and super easy recipe - you probably already have all of the ingredients on hand in your kitchen! This is our family's tried and true marinade for beef and chicken.

Wonderful!!!  I used bottled lemon juice and black pepper (fresh ground), because I had those on hand.  The blending really makes the flavor of the spices come out, you can tell.  I agree with a previous reviewer that it turns a funky color from blending- I thought that was kind of comical.  Very very tasty, though!!

As the recipe states - don't marinate over 8 hours.  I marinated overnight and the worcestershire sauce totally overpowered everything else.  Parts of the steak weren't submerged, and the balance was really good!

I have made this twice.  The first time I did NOT follow the directions that said to put it through a blender or processor.  But I did follow the advice from Christie suggesting to sprinkle some sugar on the steaks before cooking.  That made all the difference for us.  We are a little sweet oriented.  The second time, I put the ingredients through the blender first.  Wow!  That was great.  Nice, smooth sauce.  And adding the sugar at the end made these the best steaks I've ever put on the grill.

Not to pop anyone's bubble but I've been making this for 20 plus years.  I have never blended it.  I put it in a quart jar and shake it up, pour what I need to cover meat I've put in a ziplock bag, and saved what's left in the fridge until the next time.  I also add about 3 tablespoons brown sugar.  It's an excellent marinade for beef, pork and chicken!!

I marinaded 2 Sirloin Steaks and then cooked them in my new 12" Allrecipes Sizzle Sensor Nonstick Fry Pan. I placed 1 tbs of butter in pan and waited for the sensor in the pan to turn red.  I then browned and charred the steaks and cooked to medium rare perfection.  We loved the flavor.

Absolutely AMAZING! We buy ribeyes, Deni them front and back, pour the marinade into a pan and let them soak for 5-8 hours. Best steaks ever!! We loved the marinade so much, I take the remaining marinade, reducing it with 1 tbsp of sugar: bring to a quick boil (kill bacteria from the raw meat) them immediately keep stiring it with a whisk on low heat.. Perfect steak sauce as well. Add a dash of corn starch to make it thicker if desired.

I was really pressed for time and needed a good marinade for a last minute bbq! I found this recipe as it was the first to pop up in my recipe search and I had all of the ingredients on hand!  It whipped up in 5 minutes, poured into gallon ziplock and added the Choice sirloins. I only had time to refrigerate for 2  1/2 hours. I grilled it and sliced it thin and it was delicious! What a great flavor! I will definitely use this recipe again and share with friends

You know, it's funny. You look at the list of ingredients for this recipe and it doesn't look all that special. Then you mix it all up and it looks like the sort of stuff that you used to make as a kid and dare each other to drink. But then you marinade and grill some meat with it and, oh my god, it really is good.

This was just the flavor that I was looking for with my kebabs. Much obliged for sharing.

This is a very good recipe for select steaks.  I definitely would not use it on choice or prime meat(kosher salt and pepper only). If you do use this marinade, please don't waste it afterward.  Add simmered to mushrooms and maybe onions as an excellent topping or side dish to your meal.

This was seriously delicious! I halved the recipe since we only had 2 large steaks. Didn't have all the spices so I improvised a little with dried thyme instead of oregano. We cooked these in the grill the next afternoon and they were very tender and perfect flavor!! Yum!

Very tasty!  Can make cheaper cuts of meat amazing on the grill.  I, like other reviews, didn't see the need to mess up the blender and tossed all ingredients (minus white pepper) into a ziplock bag with the  meat to marinate up to and beyond 24 hours in the fridge.  This is now my GO TO Marinade.  thanks!

Now that we live in Cairo we can not serve medium well steak as we would in Canada so we had to use a marinade.  This one turned out very well!  We didn't add the parsley flakes but did add a little onion.  Very good!

This really is a great marinade for steaks!  First time I only let it marinade for about 2 hours and it was good.  Today we had steaks after letting it marinade for 20+ hour.  It was awesome!

I mix all the ingredients and dump it in gallon zip-lock bag and shake to mix more.  Then I put as many steaks as I can in the bag.  I try to coat them as best I can on all sides.  Then stick it in the fridge.

for variety, I use this recipe as a base, and switch the lemon juice out for either white wine or beer. marinate overnight, flip the bag over to marinate the other side the next morn before cooking, yummy!

I didn't change a thing.  Marinated for 8 hours on some nice ribeye steaks. This is the most amazing marinade I have ever tasted!  Will be a staple in my house for sure. Thanks for posting it.

This really is the best steak marinade in existence! I add 5 fresh chopped garlic cloves, poke a bunch of holes in the steak with a fork then marinade for 24 hours. It makes for the most flavorful and tender steak I have ever had. I LOVE this recipe!

The name says it all!  This marinade is superb!  When I buy steaks on sale, I mix up the marinade, put it in a Ziploc along with the steaks and freeze them until we're ready to use them.  This marinade is excellent for fajitas as well.  The meat is tender and perfectly flavored! Thank you, Kookie!

I made this exactly how it said and it came out perfectly! This recipe is enough to cover 2 steaks in one ziploc bag. Never again will I try another marinade this one has me hooked. I only marinate them for around 4-6 hours (any longer the flavor becomes too strong I think).

Second time making this. Excellent marinade, followed Diyeanna's lead and did mushrooms with the sauce too. I personally found it a touch salty so use light or sodium-reduced soy sauce to tone the salt down a bit. I also used half onion half garlic powder instead of the full garlic powder amount and I used my food processor to blend it (didn't the first time). It does make it nice and thick and I found the flavours blended better but that's just my two cents!!
Quick edit: For the love of steak, make sure it is PATTED DRY before grilling/cooking it! Taking it out and throwing it on the grill without patting it down makes it taste very off.

This is the fourth time I made this marinade and I think it's the best.  You will get a lot of marinade if you follow the recipe so if you plan on making only two steaks like I do, you may want to cut the ingredients in half.  I used black pepper from my grinder, low sodium soy sauce and did not add cayenne.  I usually marinate for 5 hours and then grill.  This marinade will make "cheaper" steaks taste great.  Thanks to this marinade I can make steak that tastes better than any steakhouse steak!!  I will use only this recipe from now on.

Fantastic. Check ahead to make sure you have enough of each spice and liquid though, because it's pretty demanding on the ol' spice rack. ;)

Absolutely perfect. Didn't change a thing (except didn't bother mixing it with the blender). I've made steak twice with this recipe and both times has turned out amazing.

Out Of Sight! I did not have lemon juice, but was able to substitute lime juice instead. I used fresh basil and skipped the parsley. And used fresh minced garlic. Adding your own veriation is totally ok with this recipe. Definitely a keeper! Thanks

Didn't have fresh lemons so I used lemon juice. Mixed in zip lock bag and put two pounds of sirloin tips in it all day, turning and mixing all day about every hour or so. It was raining so I broiled them about 6minutes each side. My son and I ate these right up. This one is a keeper.

I used this to marinade beef kebabs for a party based on it's reviews.  This was WONDERFUL!!!  I used ribeye for the kebab meat and it was OUTstanding!  I marinaded the meat overnight and I found it  touch too salty for my taste (and I'm a salty kind of guy) but I also don't use low-sodium soy sauce.  I might buy some to have on hand for this marinade or maybe half my soy sauce and use rice wine in stead (not rice wine vinegar for anyone who is reading this and it sounds good).  Rice wine is a totally different product - no salt, about 14% alcohol called Shaoxing and it's darn hard to find.  Go to the asian grocery and ask.

This recipe is awesome! My family doesn't want steak unless I use THIS marinade! It is perfect the way it is.  I don't add the minced garlic but do use the dash of hot sauce. Delicious! Thank you so much for sharing! Oh and for those that don't understand why you need to blend it, it is to emulsify so the flavors all bind together and to break down and disperse the herbs :)

Tried it, LOVED it! I did substitute a few things. I used a large portion of rosemary with a dash of basil, and went easy on the lemon juice as the ribeye's I had were top quality and did not need much tenderizing. Smelled good enough when it hit the grill to pull several of my neighbors out to inquire. I wound up sharing out a few tastes and now we've a impromptu friends an neighbor's BBQ in a few days. Use sense with this recipe, if you don't like strong herb flavor's go easy on those, adjust the acids to suit your quality of meat (cheap needs the full amount). This is a great starter marinade to branch out from as you get comfortable an start to tweak.

Amazing marinade! I didn't like the sour taste of the original recipe, so instead I only add about 1 tablespoon of lemon juice instead. Use your own discretion with how much of the marinade you use because it can be too much!

WOW! The name says it all. Like others I just mixed it in a bowl and poured over steaks in a plastic bag. When and if I ever get tired of this I will substitute pineapple juice for lemon juice. The next beef marinade recipe I will try is "Better Than The Best Steak Marinade in Existence", if someone comes out with it!

This is the best steak marinade that I've ever made, hands down! My husband and I invited my sister for supper, and used this marinade on our steaks, and then BBQ'd them....absolutely delicious. I let them sit in the fridge for about 6 hrs. So good my sister wants the recipe. We're not into hot sauce, so I didn't use that, and I used bottled lemon juice, and I used onion powder instead of the minced garlic. This recipe will definitely be my go-to recipe for marinade from now on. I'm going to try it on boneless chicken breasts as well.

Delicious marinade. Had one 16 oz strip steak, so I cut measurements in half and that was more than enough. Did not have dried parsley flakes or white pepper, so used fresh chopped parsley and black pepper instead. Thanks to OP and other reviewers for contributing:)

Don't let the looks of this marinade put you off! Tried it out on my husband who is very picky & pretty much doesn't like any green foods. As soon as he saw it he made a face & said "what's all that green stuff?" I told him it was herbs & to trust me all the while crossing my fingers hoping it lived up to it's name. It was so delicious! We did steak tips on the grill with it. It was a last minute idea so it only marinated for an hour. It was still good! Even my picky husband liked it! I wouldn't say it's the best marinade in existence but it's in our top 5. Goning to make it again tomorrow & let it marinade for the full 8 hours. Thanks for sharing!

This is probably more like 4 1/2 stars, as I didn't have the lemon juice to add to it.  With the lemon juice, it would be even better.  Does a wonderful job of tenderizing the meat.  I have made this a few times now and still have yet to add the lemon juice.  I let my ribeye's marinate for about 6 hours each time.

I used rice vinegar instead of lemon because I didn't have lemon.  I also did not have  white pepper so I left that out and used 1 tsp of hot sauce.  I put it in the Foodsaver marinade container and let the machine do its thing for about 30 minutes.  Family loved it!  I will use this marinade many times again!

This was pretty darn good!  We had a very cheap cut of steak.  I was looking for a way for it not to be as tough as it normally is. Here's what I did.  Covered it in kosher salt for 1 1/2 hr.  Washed off the salt.  Marinated in this mixture for a couple of hours in the fridge.  Then, took it out and let it warm up to room temperature and grilled.  What a difference!

I do not eat beef, so I cannot personally speak to the taste of this marinade. My husband though, practically drools if I mention I making this marinade. He grills his steak medium rare, and says this is the best steak he ever had. If a recipe scores me brownie points with husband, its a hit in my opinion :).

This tenderized my steak and gave it a slight teriaki flavor but the soy wasn't too strong. I used this for a London Broil and while it helped tenderize the meat, it really didn't enhance it as much as I had expected. My husband is a steak purist so he wasn't impressed with this marinade, but he did say it was alright.

This was an awesome marinade.  I did substitute black pepper for white only because that's what I had on hand.  My dad always puts A-1 steak sauce on his steak.  Had the bottle sitting right by his plate and he never touched it.  He said the steak was perfect without it.  I would have to agree.  We used Delmonico steaks, marinated 4 hours and then put them on the grill.  They were so tender.  Will definitely do this again this summer.

This recipe is by far the best and most consistent recipe I've ever used to marinate steaks. I use it for rib eyes, tri tips, new york steaks, you name it. 

De. Li. Cious.

I don't believe it overpowers the meat's natural flavor in any way, and in general I feel it enhances it. I rarely use steak sauce or anything else when I use this marinade, the flavor that you get is more than satisfactory. 


Delicious, thank you so much for sharing this recipe, my fiancé and I love it, and make it all the time. I'm actually getting ready to start making it tonight, haha, that's why I came onto Allrecipes, to look up the recipe.

I reviewed this recipe 5-6 mos. ago and gave it 4 stars, but since then, I don't think I've prepared steak (read: ribeye) any other way, so an upgrade to 5 stars is really necessary!  This really IS "the best" marinade ever -- as long as you include all ingredients, including the hot sauce (this is really "the secret") AND put it all in the blender.  Use 1/2 - 3/4 for the marinade and reserve the rest for sauce.   Please forget the so-called "purists" who have reviewed this with disdain and low scores.   Look -- steak is great in many different ways.  If you're not a marinade type, you have no business here.

I loved this marinade. The meat was so tender and tasty. Couldn't find dried basil so I used fresh basil and added fresh parsley, coriander and garlic. I also added leftover marinade to sauteed mushrooms with cream as a side sauce for the meat. Delicious!!!

Marinated sirloin steak & pork loin chops.  The marinade is excellent for pork!   There's no need to put in a blender/processor.  A whisk & bowl work just fine.

Used this as a marinade for kebobs over the weekend - was awesome!  Grumpy, who is a proclaimed Kebob hater, wanted to know if we had any leftover that evening!  I made slight changes (used fresh garlic and reduced the ingredients to make less marinade).  The marinade was a great way to flavor the chunks of beef sirloin and this will be kept as one to use over and over again.  Thank you!

I used light soya sauce, halved the oil, doubled the garlic and used fresh minced, I halved the basil, was enough marinade for 5 steaks. Next time I will double the lemon juice and pepper. Was enjoyed by everyone.

I used this marinade on a flank steak and we liked it but didn't love it.  Just a little too much lemon for my taste.

Tried this marinade for 3 small steaks I had. I substituted lime for the lemon and they marinaded for a little over 24 hours. I broiled them on a hot cast iron skillet, and made sure to use tongs to flip them, not a fork. Let it rest 5 minutes after removing from the oven before serving. My husband thought it was so flavorful and juicy, he didn't even use the A1. That is the best culinary compliment I could ever hope to get from him!

My husband and I just didn't enjoy this. I followed the recipe but found it to be REALLY acidic. The flavor was really intence and reminded me of Spoiled red wine, and the steaks weren't overly tender... I won't make this again. :(

Very good marinade.  I followed the directions exactly except I only added half of the lemon juice.  I marinated two types of steaks and let them marinade for 2 days and it added great flavor to the steaks.

You, sir, are correct in your self-proclaimed title of Best Steak Marinade ever. Indeed it is! I search no more for you have provided the perfect marinade. I used Malinda's bhut jolokia sauce for heat and it was awesome. I salute you!

I tried this over the weekend but I marinated a whole scotch fillet, hence doubled the quantities.  It was in the marinade in a large plastic container  for 2 days (in the fridge).  I slow cooked it on the BBQ rotisserie for 2 hours.  It really was something to die for.  Excellent recipe, thank you very much.

I didn't care for the seasonings.  I will try this again with horseradish, mustard and onion instead of the garlic, basil, and parsley. Of course, it will hardly be like the original.

amazingly delicious!!! every time I make for anyone they can't get enough! now making on a daily basis. One thing I did substitute because I didn't have lemon juice, I used orange pineapple juice and it was still out of this world. In fact, I think it tasted better then the lemon juice.

Enjoyed this very much, but the name is misleading. :)  Made exactly as stated and marinated 4 strip steaks for 10 hours. Grilled, and meat was very tender and juicy with a subtle steak-sauce flavor.

This is almost identical to a recipe that I developed back in the 1970's.  The original recipe I based it on was from a recipe book that came with a Big Boy BBQ grill my parents bought back in the late '50's.  It is a really great marinade, and I have used it on beef, chicken and lamb, and it works great on all of them.  Try it with fresh garlic and parsley!  I sometimes sub Kikkoman terriyaki sauce instead of soy, and that is good, also.  GREAT marinade for kebobs!

Excellent and very tasty! We are a family of 4 so I halved the recipe which worked very well. There was plenty of marinade to cover 4 medium-sized steaks. We will be using this marinade again!

I was tired of the old steak marinates I have used for years.  Tried this today on some very thick t-bones.  This was the wonderful.  Made the meat taste great.  I didn't use the last two optional ingredients.  The next time I use this I will use some Texas Pete for the hot pepper sauce.  Can't wait to see how that turns out.

Very good!  My husband couldn't stop talking about this dinner!  Very tender and flavorful meat.  (We left out the hot pepper sause, but it was still super yummy)!  Thanks for the recipe!

I hate Worcester so I replaced it with red wine! I used it to marinade filet mignon. It was sublime!

Most Delicious Rare Steak ever!!!  WE loved this marinade....used NY strip steaks, cooked rare....beautiful YUMMY Juices of the meat mixed with the marinade were terrific!  Had to use lime juice instead of lemon because that is what I had and added the extra garlic!  Made the meat super tender...melt in your mouth...scrumptious!  Wish I could afford to eat steak every day!

I am not big on marinated steak, but I thought this was okay.  My family liked it very well though, and my 2 year old ate almost a whole steak by herself, she loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I might try it again on chicken, but I am not sure if I will make it again for steak or not.

LOVE IT!!!  I did use both of the optional ingredients. I marinated 3 steaks for 7 hours, washed off the marinade, dried the steaks, and then cooked accordingly. Not too overpowe ring and I love the flavor. Served with PW's Crash Hot Potatoes and Southern Fried Cabbage. A perfect meal.

I wanted to try something different and I was not disappointed! I think the lemon juice definitely added something that would have been otherwise absent. I didn't have hot pepper sauce nor white pepper, so I substituted regular coarse ground pepper as well as a touch of ginger. Wow. Great recipe!

The BEST steak marinade I have ever tasted! It's very strong in flavor so my husband didn't like it as much. If you like a strong flavored marinade this is the one for you! I also marinaded it over night which probably contributed to it being so strong (but delicious) :)

I made enough for just two steaks, but didn't use a blender, just whisked it in a bowl. I did add the minced garlic, so left out the powdered garlic and a couple dashes of our favorite hot sauce. Put the steaks in a zip lock bag and let them marinade all day in the fridge. We grilled our steaks on charcoal and they were not only very flavorful but tender and juicy. Thanks Kookie, we will make this again.

Great marinade.  I didn't have lemon juice so I threw in some red wine vinegar.  Came out very good!  Only marinated the meat for a couple hours, but still excellent!

We really enjoyed this marinade.  I broiled the little sirloin steaks, and they turned out great.  Some of the steaks remained in the marinade for longer than the suggested time--even three days, until we got around to cooking them, and they were even better. Just broiled them about 7 minutes on each side--easy dinner with vegies and potato side dish.

Such a good base for making a marinade!!!! I added a lime just cause I had one lying around and I love them. I don't like spicy stuff so I ommited the hot pepper flakes and used black instead of white pepper. I only had an hour to marinade the CHICKEN but daaaaaaammm! It was good. I bbq'd the chicken and it was super flavorful. I used it 3 times, per my family's request, in one week! =D I've yet to try it with steak but I definately will.

Kookie, you definately deserve 5 stars for this concoction! This has been my favorite steak marinade for about 2 years now. I've used it on top sirloin, strip loin, and even my expensive ribeye steaks, and it has turned out amazing every time. I change it up a bit depending on what I have on hand, I have made it exactly as written and with various changes. Today it was strip loin steaks. I left out the lemon juice because I wanted to marinate all day (acidic ingedients like lemon can toughen meat after about 2 hours. Do try it with the Lemon though, its fabulous!). Instead I added about a teaspoon or so of dijon mustard. I used all fresh herbs and garlic, frank's red-hot, marinated about 10 hours and then threw em on the grill. Mmmmmmm...so delicious! Thank you so much for sharing this Kookie!

LOVE this marinade! Have been marinading flank steaks with it, and then cooking on the grill... OUTSTANDINGLY GOOD!  I don't use the hot pepper sauce, and use fresh minced garlic instead of dried... seriously... good stuff!  Kudos to Kookie!! Thank you so much for sharing!! ?

I had some NY strips in the freezer that I'd bought at Sam's (last time ever I buy meat there) that turned out to be tasteless and tough.  I made no changes to this recipe, put a couple steaks into this marinade in the morning, grilled in the evening, and they were tender and succulent.  I think this really may be the "best."

OMG. This was great. We threw a family BBQ the other day at which we cooked steak for the first time. After searching for marinade on this site, I decided to go with one that lot of ppl have tried and loved. Boy, am I glad I did. I didn't change anything.  I let the steaks marinade overnight because we love lot of flavors in our meat. This was one great BBQ because of the great marinade. My brother, the BBQ expert of our family loved it. Thank you Kookie.

The ultimate marinade.  I have made it twice, and my family begs for it!  What I did differently.... Putting each steak in its own ziploc bag a portion the marinade makes a big difference.  I only marinaded for 5 hrs max.  I also sauteed onions in the sauce after removing the steaks.  WOW!

this really is great stuff and I always have all the ingredients on hand.  I for some reason have not actually had Worcestershire sauce handy the past couple times though so I just toss in a bit of A1 and it is so good.  I marinate overnight and all the next day.  This produces a steak that rivals the steakhouse's!!!!

I give this recipe 5 stars based on my modifications.  First of all, I was just cooking for my fiancé and me, so I halved the recipe.  In place of the garlic powder and minced garlic, I used one clove of chopped fresh garlic.  I used fresh basil (about 4 leaves chopped) instead of dried and I reduced the amount of oil and lemon, although not by much.  I also added red chili flakes instead of hot pepper sauce.  I marinated overnight and this is similar to a korean bbq type of marinade but not as sweet.  Regardless, it was DELICIOUS!  My fiancé loved it too and he's a very cultured food man :)

This steak marinade was good. Not best in existence, but good. I didn't find that it tenderized the steak much, which is what I was really looking for. I will probably use this marinade again with a more tender cut of beef. I also like my marinade to have a little sweetness to it, so I would probably add some honey or brown sugar to it next time too.

W.O.W.  This was Ahhmazing. Sooooo good. I used more minced garlic then garlic powder. I only had 1 3/4 tbsp of basil so I threw a little Italian seasoning and oregano in.  Took 2 strip steaks out of the freezer, dumped on the marinade and let them go for 8-9 hours.  A definite keeper.

This was very good. The only thing I changed was cutting the recipe to 4 servings (only two steaks for us) and a little less soy sauce because DH isn't a fan. I wish I could've let the steaks marinate a little longer but this was a last minute dinner idea. I didn't blend together, but may try to next time.  I will be making this again and will meal plan a little better next time so they can marinate longer ;) Thanks for sharing!

Super yummy! Made for Valentine's Day dinner and we all loved it. Only wish I would have been able to let the steak marinate longer, only able to do 3 hours. Next time I'll try overnight for more intense flavor. The flavors are excellent. Thank you!

My entire family LOVES this marinade.  My son - who doesn't like steak otherwise - loves this marinade.  Depending on what I have in the house, I've made it with and without the lemon, substituted teriyaki sauce for part of the soy when I ran out, used fresh garlic instead of powder - they still all love it!  I don't bother with the blender - that's just one more thing to clean.  I mix all the ingredients in a very large measuring cup and then pour them over the steaks.  Also - I boil the marinade afterwards, adding a cup of water with a tbs of flour in it to thicken it, and make a sauce/gravy to use over the steak, rice, and or anything else.   My kids literally lick their spoons !

This was okay. My husband liked it more than I did.  I had to substitute Italian seasoning for the basil because that's what I had on hand. I also added some mushrooms to the marinade and grilled them alongside the steaks.  It was great on the mushrooms.

Delicious.  I didn't have any Tobasco so I just put a small pinch of Cayenne Pepper in there, and I didn't have any white pepper so I put some cracked black pepper in there.  Otherwise, made it as written!  We marinated our t-bone steaks for about four or five hours, and they were amazing.  We will definitely use this again.

This marinade works wonders on a cheaper cut of steak and makes it taste better than it would on its own. I wasn't as impressed when I used it on thick cut ribeye steaks, it didn't have the same effect and made the meat taste oily.

This marinade was definitely very good.  It's a little expensive to dress up lower quality cuts of beef, but it definitely does the job and tastes great.

I made this exactly as it was presented, and it was plenty of marinade for a 2 1/2 pound tri-tip. I grilled it. I always use Chaka's Mmm sauce, but I was out so thought I try this recipe. I marinated it for 2 hours. It was very good and a tasty flavor alernative to the Mmm sauce with the herbs, but it definitely won't replace Chaka's Mmmm sauce. I will try it again. I think it'd be a really good flavor for grilled chicken.

The marinade was good.  It by no means lives up to it's title but it was plenty good.  I am still searching for the marinade you serve to guests and they 100% will rave over it.....I know it exists somewhere!!

This was outstanding. I omitted the hot pepper sauce  and used fresh garlic instead of dried or powdered. Used this to marinate elk tips. Seared the tips and then added reserved marinade. Reduced and served as a sauce. Mmmmmm!!!

Outstanding steak marinade! I almost psyched myself out because I was using T-Bones, and I usually don't marinate them because they are so nice to begin with. But I'm so glad I did! I made the recipe exactly as stated, minus the Worcestershire sauce because I didn't have any. I subbed A-1 instead. I also left out the garlic powder and used 1.5 Tbsp of minced garlic instead. I marinated the T-Bones overnight, then pan fried them today. Fabulous! This is definitely going to be my go to marinade from now on!

The name says it all...I used this on grilling meats all summer, and every time I served it to guests, they couldn't believe how tender and flavorful the meat was! This recipe definitely saved my butt every time I needed a quick, tasty meal.

This marinade was fantastic.  I was a little skeptical at first but it turned out wonderfully.  I did however have to make some adjustments due to lack of a couple of items.  Instead of parsley and basil, I used 3 tablespoons of Italian Seasoning, and a dash of sage.  I also added one clove of fresh garlic.  Everyone raved about the flavor of the steaks.  I normally let them marinate overnight was behind schedule, so they only got about 3 hours of marinating in and still turned out delicious.  I will be using this marinade over and over.

OK..Don't get me wrong, this marinade was pret-ty tastey and all...But with a name like this, I was expecting to have my socks knocked off...It tastes like I could have gotten it from a bottle. I like the idea of using fresh ingredients, so I will be making this again.  Maybe with a little less lemon juice and some more hot sauce :~)

This is, literally, the best steak marinade in existence.  I make it at least every other week, and find myself craving it often.  I follow the recipe as is, except I only use 1 tbsp of basil.  Dried spices are expensive, and there's really no need for 3 tablespoons; 1 works just fine and tastes fantastic.

Made this prior to camping for something new.  It was good, but not great to us. For our personal taste preference, I would consider making it again with the addition of fresh garlic and crushed green peppercorns. It was fun for a change though.

I used this one to marinate a 5 pound striploin roast we did for a family BBQ for our youngest one's 3rd birthday.  My roast marinaded for about 26 hours or so.  I didn't have white pepper, so used regular black instead.  Very tasty beef was enjoyed by everyone!

Fantastic!  Used fresh garlic (4 cloves) instead of garlic pdr.  Used fresh basil instead of dried.  Put it all in a Mason jar & shake.  Tenderized top sirloin steaks first before marinading them.  Wow, delish!

I use a similar recipe learned from chefs on cape cod. This is simpler and fantastic on Rib Eye.  1/4 cup or equal parts of Red Baslamic vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, Soy Sauce and Ken's Light Ceasar Salad Dressing.  ( the salad dressing has oil and lots of black pepper). Poke holes in steak with fork. Just 20 - 60 minutes in refrig is enough.

MMMMMM! This really is the best steak marinade in existence! I'm thoroughly impressed with how tasty and easy it is to make. I didn't have any garlic powder/dried garlic, so I just threw in a coarsely minced large clove into the blender. Also subbed fresh basil for dried. Oh, and I scaled it down to 2 servings to marinate a single 3/4 lb grass-fed porterhouse steak--the perfect amount for an awesome steak.

Hands down the best marinade ever!!!  I added a teaspoon of Better Than Boullion (that stock rocks in French Onion Soup!) but prepared as written aside from that.  I'm planning on making a double batch next time and freezing it in ice cube trays so I can have it handy to add some extra kick to rice side dishes and stir fry.  FABULOUS - Thank you!

AMAZING!!  I had to use lime juice rather than lemon because it was all I had on hand, but so, so, good!  Even my 4 year old couldn't get enough steak!  I'm not usually much of a meat eater, but I ate every bite!

This was an awesome marinade and it makes alot! I did not blend just whisked well by hand. Only thing I would recommend is if you are doing it to feed just 2-3 people to cut the recipe in half. My whole family loved this. My husband after numerous "MMMMM's" said when he was done that I "could make this recipe any time I wanted" LOL...

This is a great marinade. I use fresh garlic instead of powdered, but otherwise follow the recipe exactly. For a family of 2, it makes enough for three marinades, so I freeze two portions to use later. Thanks for sharing!

This marinade is very powerful and masks the flavor of the steak to a large extent.  It's definitely tasty, but I would not use it on finer cuts of meat like ribeyes or filets.  Save it for flank steak or fajitas.

Delicious, but I wasn't necessarily crazy about my steaks being covered in green herbs.  Lots of parsley and basil--I''ll cut back next time.

Good, very good taste, but alas not the best in existence. Does nothing to tenderize, so folks should know that part. Still, a VERY good flavor, and we all enjoyed it very much.

Oh my heavens.  I used this marinade on fresh green beans and cooked them up in the wok... sooooooo yummy.  I did add a few more splashes of Soy (low sodium) sooooo sooo good.  (I think I'll use it next time I'm roasting patatoes.)  Really can't wait to use it on steak!  Thanks for sharing!

I really enjoy this recipe a lot (including for tuna steaks).  One of the changes I did make was to substitute cayenne pepper for white pepper, since I have found that cayenne pepper goes wonderful with steaks.  Also, I have found one of the best ways to cook with this marinade is to sear the steaks at high heat (either pan or grill), then place them in a glass container, pour the marinade on them, and cook in the oven until they are done to your liking.  This cooking style is a variation of the most common restaurant style in which an iron skillet is used to sear them and then bake them.  My wife doesn't normally like steak, but she loves this recipe.  Thanks for sharing your family's work with us.

Excellent marinade. Halved the recipe & replaced garlic powder with 3 very large garlic cloves. Put all in a ziploc bag with 2 ribeye steaks, only could marinade for 2 hours but was enough time for it to do its magic and transform an ordinary steak into... Well, you will just have to try this yourself. Sliced 8 oz. mushrooms, added to excess marinade and sauteed, then topped this over the steaks. The last time I had a steak this good was with an aged steak. Hope this helps in your  decision making.

Ooooh, I loved this!  I didn't follow the recipe exactally, I just used what I had in my cabinet, no parsley flakes, used half olive oil and half vegetable oil, it turned out perfect!  The smell of the cooked steaks made my mouth water, and they tasted just as good as they smelled!! Will definately make again!

i should have marinated longer, it really was delicious though. I had rib eye, put cast iron skillet in ovet at 500 degrees for 20 min, then i took skillet out of oven, placed over high heat on oven, seared steaks without moving, 3 min each side, then threw oven on broil and did 3 min each side on broil, about 6 inches from flame. after that, i let stand 5 minutes so juices absorb. came out great, making again soon and will marinate more than 30 minutes this time.

I thought the Steak Marinade was good it could use a bit less in the Lemon Department though. I opted out of the hot sauce and extra garlic as the persons i was cooking for would curse me for the stomach aches :)

This was pretty good as is!  I used it to marinate some NY strips for about 8 hours.  Personally, I felt that it was missing a little something.  It was good, just missing something nonetheless.  However, my 8 year old and 4 year old loved it!  They are big steak eaters and said it was the best steak they have ever had.  I will definitely make this again, but next time I'll play around with the ingredients some.

This was super easy! Made the marinade quickly before work and threw it & 2 tenderloin steaks in a ziploc. Then grilled them on the george foreman when I got home. This is the 1st time my husband actually liked at home steak! 5 stars for that! Delish.

This was a great marinade, I didn't have lemon juice so I replaced it with Sherry wine vinegar..YUM.  I replaced the parsley with Oregano, and used Thyme instead of Basil.  IT CAME OUT FANTASTIC, we used NY strip steaks, and my fiance loved it.

This was really great!!! I followed the recipe with the one exception of adding a little more Worcestershire. I think next time I will actually up the soy sauce instead! I used low-sodium soy so it wouldn't get too salty, but that was the best flavor in the meat. With this marinade, we can afford to get cheap steaks and therefore eat steak MORE OFTEN!!! For that, I thank you :D.

Everyone loved this at my house. Be careful of marinating it too long, it will be really salty. (Had a family emergency the night we were going to cook it, so it sat for two days before we got to cook it.) Otherwise it was wonderful and next few times I've made it and marinated it overnight it was fabulous. I've also added about 1/2 cup of red wine if I have some around, and it's great with that too.

This is a superb marinade, without question.    I used fresh basil and parsley from my garden instead of dried.  I didn't blend the ingredients, and only marinated the meat for about two hours.    I cooked the ribeyes, until the core temp was about 155/160, over charcoal with soaked hickory wood chips.  The result was to die for.  This is a recipe that will I will use again and again.  Bravo!

This really was absolutely gorgeous.  I marinated pork chops in it overnight for a bbq the next day, I didn't have any parsley, but I don't think it would have needed it. Everyone loved them. Fantastic, I'll certainly use it again.

Great and easy.  I blended it per the directions, but i can't see why it was necessary unless you just like washing oil out of a blender.  Marinated them overnight and they turned out great.  Squeeze the lemon juice fresh, it's worth it.

I gave this a 4 star rating because (a) I've never used a marinade before and have no idea if it is the best marinade in existence and (b) I did tweak it a little bit:    I made it according to the recipe but reduced it for 2 people.  I always read the reviews before trying a recipe and so with this recipe I took some reviewers' advice and added some Dijon mustard (Hellmann's squeeze) and about 1 tbsp. of brown sugar.  It was really good, thank you for sharing your recipe.  My husband really liked it and so did I ... and we're extremely fussy.  LOL  I let it sit in a Ziploc bag for over 30 hours (because we couldn't cook it and it had to wait until the next night but it was great for having to sit that long in the marinade).  I tossed it on my barbecue.  I also tenderized it prior to putting it in the marinade in the bag by hitting it with a jar of pickles (LOL ... don't have a meat tenderizer hammer thingy). Then when it was in the bag along with the marinade I pounded it again.  It really was tender (it was a very large sirloin tip steak that was on sale) and I didn't need any A-1 Steak Sauce like I normally do.  I served it with baked potatoes and garlic sauteed Swiss chard in EVOO (extra virgin olive oil).  I'll make this again and I've printed it out and it's going in my Tried & True Recipe Book.

The name of this recipe is spot-on! I've tried many different marinades through the years, this one gets raves every time.  Definitely the best I've ever tried, bar none!

Another five star review.  I used this marinade on sirloin steaks for the 4th of July barbecue.  The men raved about the steaks. (I love it when that happens!) :o)  I used about 5 large cloves of fresh pressed garlic in place of the powder, omitted the optional hot pepper and dried garlic, and did not blend the mixture. Just threw the steaks and marinade into a freezer bag and froze them until I needed them.  They were superb!!  Thanks for a definite winner!

Used this marinade as written for Fathers Day on some top loin steaks. Let is marinate for close to 24 hours. Didn't need any steak sauce for these steaks, plenty enough flavor just as grilled. I will be using this again. Can't go wrong with lemon, garlic, and soy sauce!

This came out very flavorful and it was very easy! A couple of lessons learned: 1) I think this is definitely a beef-oriented marinade. I tried it on pork and the flavor was definitely "beef." 2) Don't salt the meat with this marinade. Came out wayyyyy too salty. I liked that I didn't have to marinade for very long (maybe 2 hours) to get a good flavor from this recipe.

Took a cheap cut of meat and made it phenomenal.  Didn't have garlic powder so I used minced garlic, marinaded for only about 5 hours, grilled it and it turned out great.  I'll definitely use this one again.

I'm not sure about "Best In Existence" -  I'll get back to you when I've tried all the others.  This one, however, is sure to rank high for any competition that factors in cost,  simplicity, availability of ingredients in an average kitchen and the flavor of the ultimate result.  It didn't overpower the steak's flavor, but complimented it.  On the grill, it charred a little around the outside of a thin vein of fat - keeping the flavor in.    Once on the grill, I poured the remaining marinade on top and let it soak into the meat as it cooked.    I'll certainly be using this one again.

Used this for Mother's Day with the family this year; everyone raved!!  Using the blender helps to emulsify the ingredients, so they don't separate when the steaks are marinating.  Super fabulous!

This was excellent.  I marinated two steaks for 2 hours, and used my GF grill. I then served the steak with some white rice.  the steak juices mixed wonderfully with the rice and the meat was marinated perfectly.  Thank you!

This was very good, but not my favorite one ever.  (My fave would be Savory Garlic Marinated Steaks, from this site).  I used as many fresh things as possible (basil, garlic) and marinated sirloin steaks all day.  Then we grilled them.  Very yummy!

This was very good, I used it for two ribeyes. My husband and I liked it very well. I used black pepper instead of white, since I don't like white pepper, but other than that followed the recipe. Very good, will make again for sure.

It really is the best marinade I have tried in a long time.  The first time I made it, I only let it marinade for about 4 hours.  The next 2 times, it marinated overnight.  It made all the difference.  I used basalmic vinegar instead of the lemon juice - YUMMY!!!

This recipe was excellent. I gave it five because I don't usually care for marinades much. I like a steak to taste like steak. Hate traditional steak sauce - it covers up the taste. This marinade enhances the steak flavour and is great for helping with those 'tougher' steaks.

This recipe is just about perfect.    Next time I think I will use vegetable oil because olive oil solidified when it was in the fridge.   I marinated the steak overnight and it was very tender and tasty.    Will use this recipe again

I cut the soy to 1/4 cup. Cut the Worcestershire to 1/8 cup.  I added 1/4 cup good balsamic vinegar and 1 heaping teaspoon Dijon mustard. Used pressed fresh garlic rather than garlic powder. Go easy on the white pepper, I used fresh ground black pepper. Just hand mix in a bowl.  Now, its the Best Steak Marinade in Existence. Try it.

Excellent recipe. I tenderized the steak first, poked holes in both sides with a toothpick and added an extra quarter teaspoon of hot sauce, and let it marinate for 24 hours. Awesome!

I love having a marinade on my steak; my husband not so much. I did this exactly in half because it was just the two of us and the steak wasn't that big. I have to say, this marinade changed my husbands mind! It was delicious! So much flavor! I will definitely be using this again.

never marinate filet mignon.  it is so tender and does not need it.  Marinate a sirloin and this is a good marinade.

My wife and I have made this several times leaving out the hot pepper sauce  and the minced garlic.

We let it marinate for anywhere between 24 and 72 hours.

When we cook it in a pan on the stove (yes, I hear you all gasping -- this is how we have to do it right now!), we pour the marinade in the pan and cook the steaks in that.

We have never found a better marinade.

I seriously thought the basil amount was going to be too much, but it wasn't!  I didn't have lemon juice, so I used lemon pepper and skipped the pepper part of the recipe.  BEST marinade I've ever had.  I marinated overnight.  I've done this twice now... yum!

I've used these exact ingredients myself for years .  I will marinate a big sirloin then, after grilling, slice as for long ndon broil and drizzle more marinade on it. My grandkids love it!  Note:  cook the marinade on the grill while steak grills, so the raw meat juices will be cooked.

I've been using this recipe  since first saw it posted here. Really perks up a top sirloin. By the time I think about it, I only get a couple of hours marinadeing but worth it!! I sometimes reserve  some and boil/simmer down thicker for serving.  DW

I don't typically marinate steaks, but, thought I would try this for a change.   I marinated for about 8 hours and made as the recipe stated with the exception of using black pepper instead of white pepper.  The steaks were amazing!  They had wonderful flavor and were crazy tender!  Thanks for the great recipe!

My family and I did not like this marinade. Husband said it ruined the steaks. 
It made the steak taste bitter and sour.  Not a good flavour at all.

This marinade is wonderful I have made it several times. It is good on the grill or in a frying pan. The longer you let the meat sit the better the flavor I have gone up to 24 hours,  it's a great way to make venison steaks or chops also.

Followed recipe to the letter and it did not disappoint. I have been using Dale's sauce, red wine, garlic and pepper for years. I thought a change was in order. My husband was nervous about the change but one bite sent him to happy place. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you for sharing.

My husband is a steak purist who believes that you should never put anything on that piece of meat except some A1 when you're ready to eat it.  Luckily, I persuaded him to let me try this marinade because he LOVED it!  He actually told me I'd "hit it outta the park" on this one--and my young adult kids thought it was the best steak they'd ever had.  Will DEFINITELY be making this again--and again!

I will never grill steaks the same again. This was a 10/10 in the house.  I let sit 24hrs then grilled. This is a pretty universal flavor with no odd seasonings.

I've done a few other marinades because I like try to different flavors, but adding soy & lemon juice kicked it up. I also tenderized my sirloin steaks & had intended on allowing them to marinate for a day....turned into 3. Then I broiled them in my cast iron. My hubby told me I outdid myself. My 11yr old on the other hand didn't care for the sauce as much. But he did eat it all to get dessert :)
Will be making this again (but with simpler ingredients for the kiddo lol). Thanks for sharing!

I've made this many times and my steaks always turn out tender and delicious! My mother (a restaurant owner and amazing cook) even raved over how wonderful my steaks are, because of this marinade.

Generally a good marinade.  Certainly not the best I've ever had.. close, but not quite.  Very good mix, however in my opinion, needs to have some sweeetness to make it sing.  I followed the recipe to the T with exception of adding liquid smoke.   Used on some filet minon  and was very good, but I think some brown sugar would have taken it over the top.

I have had nearly the same exact recipe for over forty years. Not sure if it was printed somewhere at some time or not. Anyway, I use only fresh garlic and I omit the heat and the basil. No blending necessary. Best on flank steak and when meat is marinated overnight. Double the marinade and reserve some to reheat as an au jus. Cook meat to medium rare and slice thin.

Will definitely make this again, excellent flavor to this marinade! This makes a lot so if you're only marinating a small amount of meat,  you could probably halve the recipe. Delicious!

Very tasty. Meat was  absolutely delicious.  Didnt blend it just mixed in all ingredients and let the meat stay in the marinade for about 30 minutes...its the best I've ever had and so easy to put together..

In love with this recipe.  I used two NY Strips, allowed to marinate 24 hours, and could really taste to flavors.  Whisked in a bowl because I was too lazy to clean a blender or processor after.  When I make a few mason jars for friends, I'll probably blend.  Used fresh parsley, basil, and 3 cloves of garlic instead of dried herbs.  Since this was my first time making it, and it turned out superb, I'll probably stick to the fresh (unless I'm too lazy to go to the store).    
I don't care what people say about good steak and only salt and pepper........this marinade is far superior to the just salt and pepper.  :P  Thanks for the recipe.  Next test.....use on my dad.

I tried your steak marinade and purposely bought a tough cut of beef.  I marinaded the steak for 24 hours and BBQed it.  It was superb, the meat turned out tender and flavorful.  The only addition I made was 1/4 teaspoon of smoked ancho ground pepper and it simulated the taste of Aracharra I grew to love in Mexico.   This is a keeper ......well done!!!

This is the best marinade! I followed the recipe exactly, will not change it. This is my go-to marinade. The steaks were tender and flavorful. Thank you for this wonderful recipe. SinceI first wrote this, I have continued to use this recipe with outstanding results. One review mentioned not blending the ingredients, just putting them in a Ziploc bags. I wanted to mention that I have done that,  but usually take the extra couple of minutes to blend. It is much better blended.

I followed the recipe with the exception of the hot sauce and I did use fresh garlic instead of dried.  Marinade the first steak for 12 hours and a 2nd steak for 3 days.  Both were great but the 2nd steak was by far the best I have ever done on our smoker!

I intend using this as an injection for my next Roast and Brisket on the smoker.  This is fantastic!

Bought a 1 inch thick New York Sirloin which cost approx. $12.00.I mixed in the blender and it came out greenish although as another reader mentioned was to use fresh garlic which I used 3 cloves because we love garlic and its so healthy for you and as well the granulated garlic. Lots of basil does this. Marinated for 4 hours and grilled on my grill. Was very tasty. My husband and I enjoyed it with Parmesan noodles. I would recommend!

It is a five star for flank steak and skirt steak and the excess marinade keeps well in the refrigerator.

 At best it is one star for others.  It did not work on a ribeye for us. 

I would suggest not using it on steaks like ribeye, t-bone or porterhouse.

I have to say, I have been following recipes.com for a few years and I am always amazed with the people who did not follow the recipe and then give it a low rating, or for that matter, any rating at all. Please follow the recipe before you rate it. Your rating is otherwise meaningless.

I made this marinade pretty much as written, but did make a few minor changes based on others comments:  I used 1 Tablespoon of lime juice (didn't have any lemons on hand) and 2 Tablespoons of balsamic vinegar in place of the 1/3 CUP of fresh lemon juice.  I also used 2 Tablespoons of minced garlic and left out the garlic powder.  Otherwise, made exactly as written (including using the blender).  It turned out great after marinating the steaks for about 4 hours.  I used the leftover marinade to sauté some fresh mushrooms and onions and they were also delicious.  Thank you---will be making this again!

Me and the fam really like this marinade. I've made it several times already. First time making I used a blender but every time since I've just mixed the ingredients together and poured over meat. Theres no difference in taste so I save on extra dirty dishes. I also use black pepper instead of white. I only use this marinade on lesser cuts of meat. Good quality meats don't need a marinade!

Not sure if it's the *best* in existence but it's pretty good. Used 2 New York strip steaks and halved the recipe. I couldn't find any white pepper so I just used the regular black pepper I had. If I use this marinade again, I'd probably use more of the soy and pepper sauces, more pepper, and a little less lemon juice. I let the steaks sit in the marinade about 2-3 hours before throwing them on the grill. They were really tender and the excess marinade made a nice crust on the edges. 9/10, would use again.

Edit: Made this again, realized I'd forgotten to add the Worcestershire sauce last time.  I made the full recipe this time instead of half. Would still use more pepper next time. I didn't use a blender either time, just dumped everything in a zip top bag and mixed it together like that.  

Final say: 9.75/10. I'd still make some personal taste adjustments but if you actually use the Worcestershire sauce like the recipe says to, it does turn out better and you can use the full amount of lemon juice the recipe calls for.

tried this for the first time tonight with my wife. Marinated the steak for about 5 hours and it turned out great. I added a grilled jalopeno and tomato slaw to the top of the steak and it was a great compliment to this recipe.

This is my first rating ever - the reason I made an account was just so I could write about how tasty this was! I was skeptic of the ingredient combo, but it REALLY CAME TOGETHER! It reminded me of a top notch steakhouse steak. I used it on grilled Tbones. Marinated about 8 hrs. 
Don't leave out the hot sauce. The steaks don't come out 'hot'  but it adds a nice flavor! THANK YOU! I will make again.

I cut the marinate in half and used it on a flat iron steak overnight.  It was tender and very delicious barbequed and cut against the grain.

Better than 5 STARS!!!  I use this recipe once a week and it is fantastic...exactly as written...no changes needed.  My one tweak is that I put the steaks in a Ziploc Bag and pour the marinade in with them.  I usually try to let marinade for at least a few hours.  I also pull them from the fridge 30 minutes prior to grilling to allow the steaks to come to room temperature ~  They are fantastic!!!  Won't use any other marinade.

I could literally drink this marinade; it's soooo tasty. I substituted garlic paste for the powder, and used fresh basil , oregano and rosemarry sprigs from my garden. It's great for chicken, too!

As others have said, not sure if this is the best, but it is delicious! My hubs deemed it "restaurant quality" tonight. I made it as written, except: omitted dried garlic & cut down olive oil. I did use the blender -- keep in mind, if your marinade is smooth, no "burnt bits" from the grill. I popped it in a bag with juicy filets. Let it marinate in the fridge for 3 hours. 1/2 hour prior to grilling, I drained marinade over sliced portabellas, and while steaks were resting, I simmered the 'shrooms. Delightful!

I have made this recipe a number of times and it is fabulous EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.  Kudos to the creator of this masterpiece.  *tips hat* The only thing I haven't done with this recipe is leave it to marinade for a long time,--I keep doing the couple hours before dinner thing. I just can't see it getting any better than it has been!

This recipe was a great marinade. I bought 3 huge cuts of quality steak and decided I wanted a nice flavour filled marinade and this did the trick. I followed almost perfectly other than I also added some mustard. Turned out great and will do again

I've made this a couple of times and used 4 garlic cloves instead of garlic powder and I must say that this IS the tastiest marinade I've ever made with my steak tips!  Great recipe!

Definitely a keeper.  I used fresh garlic instead of powder, but otherwise stuck to the recipe, and the result was excellent. A really flavourful and tender steak.  This will be the only marinade I use from now on when I'm grilling steaks.

Very good mixture, the blender part is essential to emulsify the ingredients completely. I let sit for 4 hours which was sufficient - wouldn't change a thing, Thanks Kookie!

I tnink that the lemon was too overpowering. My husband and grandfather are steak lovers and they didn't like this marinade. Too salty and a bit sour. Won't be making this again.

Followed this recipe exactly as written, except used reduced sodium soy sauce because I am on a low sodium diet.  Trust me, there is still a LOT of salt in reduced sodium soy sauce.  Wisked the ingredients in a bowl, used rib eye steaks and broiled in the oven because it was snowing.  Was afraid the marinade would over power the steak flavor, but not at all.  In fact, it enhanced the flavor!  Can't wait to try outside on the grill.  Thank you for this wonderful marinade Kookie!

I made only one change, and that was to use less soy sauce (a personal preference). I let the steaks marinate for about 7 hours and then seared them on my grill pan and finished cooking in the oven using my meat thermometer. It tasted alright, it just wasn't as good as I expected it to be based on the reviews. I will probably keep searching for go-to recipe.

This was by far the best marinade I have tried. And the longer it marinates the better. No steak sauce needed. Even my 12 year said it was the best steak she has tasted. She usually will not eat steak.

It isn't inedible or anything, but it did absolutely nothing for my NY strips. I am wanting a far deeper flavor without tasting like teriyaki. These babies soaked for 8 hours; and two things were evident: The Asian flavor was off-putting, and the other flavors weren't strong enough to soak into the steak. In the future, I will stick to a mustard/melted butter combo with steak salts. If you do like the flavor, I suggest letting it sit for 24 hours in it, to maybe pull in the flavor better.

Just loved this recipe.  I used it on a 3 lb. boneless inside blade roast.  Put the roast in the marinade at 8 am while it was still frozen.  As it defrosted the marinade did work through the meat.  Roasted in my roasting pan using tatters and carrots as a trivet.  Also poured about 1 cup of the marinade in the pan with about 1/8 cup of water.  Will be making again.

This recipe was good but I replaced the olive oil with a cup of Apple cider vinegar and a half cup of canola oil, the vinegar act's to tender the meat and cooks out as well as not being as greasy. Also added a small amount of Mrs dash onion and herb seasoning.

This was alright. I will probably reserve it for flank steak. I tried it on elk and it really did nothing for it. I might even try it on chicken.

Absolutely delicious!  I added about 1/2can of beer to the mix second time around and it was even better.  I did blend the ingredients but agree with other reviews that you probably don't have to.  I also used bottled lemon juice and regular minced garlic instead of the dried garlic and it was just fine.

By far the best steak marinade I have ever had. I dare to say almost better than restaurant steak . I'll never buy store  brand marinade again. Let steak marinate for a day and you'll agree.

Good flavor. I think this is a good marinade for a cheap steak, to improve the results. I used it on Delmonico steaks which stand fine on their own. Will use again. Only change, I didn't have fresh lemon juice so I used bottled.

This recipe only needs one word...AWESOME! I left out the soy sauce (don't like it) and used fresh parsely, and...YUM. Okay, that's two words, but do you really need more? :)

I'm a novice in the kitchen and on the grill, but I can't imagine it gets better than this! OUTSTANDING flavor and super simple to make. Worked fine when I added all ingredients to a large ziplock back to mix and marinade. I omitted the hot sauce since I dislike spicy flavors and it was still fantastic and so flavorful. If you prefer the heat I'm sure the hot sauce is a great addition. The longer you let the meat marinade the better. We used this recipe for grilling steaks all summer and loved it every time. DELICIOUS! Thanks for a super recipe!

This was pretty good and I am glad I tried it, but I much prefer G's Flank Steak Marinade on this site.

I really wanted to like this marinade! Tried it twice, on two cuts of meat. It just doesn't taste right.

We don't usually like to marinate our steaks as we are purists when it comes to the taste of the meat but we had lots of people for dinner and had to buy a lesser grade of meat. This marinade was WOW!  Everyone asked for it. I said it was an old family recipe!

Fantastic recipe. The steaks were amazing and there was practically a fist fight over the au jus. Adding basil gives it an unusual but very tasty fresh zing, and blending the mixture for 30 seconds really makes all the ingredients available to the meat. I used a half-dozen garlic cloves instead of the powder, black pepper instead of white, a 50/50 mix of fresh lemon and bottled lime because I didn't have enough lemons. I also used a basil paste and only had about half the specified amount of Worcestershire sauce. I then salted and peppered four 1.25" NY steaks, rubbed in some olive oil and then put the steaks in a 1 gallon ziplock and marinated for about one hour at room temperature. Best one-hour marinade I can remember. I highly recommend it!

I use this on moose and deer steaks and it is perfect. Other than using fresh basil, I followed the recipe exactly. My fiancé and his family loved it when we had them over for a BBQ. It made the steaks very tender. If I recall correctly, they were T Bone and loin steaks.

Excellent.  I didn't put it in a blender and I used fresh garlic instead of the minced garlic (still used the garlic powder).  We will be using this marinade in the future!

OH YEAH!!!!
Been looking for years and I never have to look any further. Let me say I did cut the recipe down to serve 4
Didn't have garlic pwd so I used chopped garlic and I am ashamed to say I didn't have dried basil either but I did have chopped fresh basil  paste  so I cut that down to 1 Tbsp.
Thank you Kookie for sharing this awesome marinade.

Wanted to try a new marinade. This one is really good, it stands up to it's name. The flavor is outstanding. I used this recipe to marinade chicken and beef kabobs for grilling on the BBQ grill. Will be using this recipe again. Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe.

This marinade is defiantly worth trying! I have grilled and broiled my steaks after using this marinade multiple times. I don't blend, I whisk in bowl or  bag and marinade anywhere from 4-6 hours. I also have reduced and added mushrooms as Diyeana suggested.  You can't go wrong any way that you decide to use this marinade.

This was delicious on some ribeye steaks. I actually followed the whole recipe and loved it! I thought the basil might be too strong but it wasn't. Used a Jim Beam hot sauce for a little kick. I just wish I could have marinaded overnight to really let it sink in.

Absolutely the best!  The only steak that I didn't even have a desire it put steak sauce on.   Not to try this would be doing yourself and family a disservice.

I made this for supper last night. I am not a steak person as I find it tough but my husband loves it. As it was father's day I wanted to make him and his dad their favourite. Normally he isn't one to marinate steak but I gave it a try to compromise for the women. We all love it! I will be using this from now on. It doesn't over power the meat at all just gives it a nice tenderness. Thank you!

My husband said this was the best steak he had ever eaten after I tried this marinade.  We will never eat another steak without using it.  Talk about meat that melts in your mouth.  You have to try this.

Works everytime! I just avoid the lemon, we don't miss it and the tip of using leftover marinade to saute mushrooms in the butter made for a nice touch! Thanks to the originator of the recipe.

I made this marinade for the "Flank Steak with Avocado Salsa" also from this site, and it was the best steak dinner I have ever had. The leftovers were also amazing. I sliced the steak very thinly and added it to sautéed yellow pepper and red onion along with a fajita seasoning mix also from this site. Both meals were simple to prepare and excellent. Sigh of contentment.

I didn't care for this at all. The marinade left none of the taste of the meat, it only tasted of the marinade. I wish I would have grilled my steak plain.

Tried this recipe 5 days ago and just used it again for our May 24 get together BBQ! Taste is wonderful and our kids enjoyed it as much as we did so no need for more than one marinating bag. Restrain yourself from adding any kind of salt, it does not need it! I like to try a recipe "as is" before making any changes and chose not to make any, seasoning is simply delicious.

It was ok.  It makes the steak nice and tender but doesn't add anything to the flavour. If anything it takes away the steak flavour. I prefer Northwest steakhouse marinade from this site much better.

Tried this last night on Prime Sirloin Tips.  The hubby is a steak purist and does not believe in putting anything on a steak other than salt and pepper.  I marinated half of the tips and he did his salt and pepper on the other half, and what can I say?  This marinade won, hands down and he is now a convert!  The marinated steak was so much more moist and juicy, not to mention extremely tasty and delicious.  This is our new "go to" marinade for our steaks.

Used this marinade and it was great! Saved it for regular rotation. I was not able to let it set for 8 hrs. I whipped it up and left meat marinade for about 1 hour and it was still amazing!

Tried this recipe for a kabob dinner and it was fantastic. Two days later, used it for Easter get-together with family.  It was the only recipe people wanted when they left.

Marinade was really good. I didn't have dried basil. So I used Italian seasoning and some fresh parsley. Added some onion to the marinade. I used flank steak.

By far the best marinade I've found for beef. I use this weekly on sirloin for the grill. I make exactly like the recipe reads. Perfect for our taste. Smells like a steak house.

Even my SUPER-picky 4-yr-old ate it! I used a smaller proportion for my small family. Put all the ingredients in a ziplock, put in some sandwich steaks, and pounded them in the marinade. Cooked immediately. YUM!

I found this marinade to be too strong - it overpowered the meat.  I marinaded it for about 6 hours.  I wouldn't try it again.

I used this on venison after pounding the heck out of it. It stayed in the marinade overnight then I cooked it in the crock pot. It had no gamey taste whatsoever and it just fell apart!

I whipped some up and tossed a couple of (cheap) top sirloins into the bag and let it sit for 7 hours - and it was amazing.  Kids devoured it - nobody cracked open the A-1 sauce or the ketchup - wished I had made more.  Definite an addition to the rotation.

Made this marinade for cube steaks last night. Two stars for tenderness, but the basil absolutely ruined it. Don't add the basil if using for beef! However, it might work better for chicken. I will try this again, but without the basil. I can't believe how just one ingredient can make or break a dish like this!

This really is an awesome marinade.  I skip the parsley and the garlic powder and only use fresh basil and freshly grated garlic. It makes it taste so much better.  I haven't used another marinade since I found this one last summer.  I just mix everything in a gallon size zip lock bag, squeeze it all together to mix and add the meat.  It's really one of the best marinades I've ever tried.

I didn't have lemon juice or garlic powder, so instead I used balsamic vinegar and fresh, crushed garlic. I also swapped the white pepper for regular pepper and added a teaspoon of crushed red pepper. It was delicious! Spicy and tangy. If you're not a fan of spicy food, this isn't food you, but we're spicy food lovers and it was right on the money!

It's tangy with a little bit of sneaky spiciness, and it works well on venison steaks! I had no lemons, so I used red wine vinegar instead. I also used red pepper instead of white, and opted to squeeze a little sriracha into the mix. I let the meat bathe in the marinade for ~6 hours, then grilled it over charcoal for ~5 minutes each side (to medium rare). I made a sauce from the left over marinade by simmering it in a sauce pan for a few minutes. It was great drizzled over the venison cut, which I arranged on a bed of wild rice... So fancy... So 
delicious. :)

This was very good! We pan fried the steaks and used the marinate in the pan so no additional oil needed. Towards the end i sauteed some onions in the juice. It was delicious!

I was a steak purist - only put a little salt, pepper and butter on it to grill.  I would never consider putting a marinade on any steak...and then I tried this!  Now it's inconceivable to me to grill a steak without this delicious marinade!  Try this, and you won't be disappointed!

I amped up the hot sauce and added 1 teaspoon dark molasses. Pan fried the steak with the mixture, let the marinade reduce and thicken a bit and it made for a very bold and flavorful steak sauce!

Loved this marinade!  My fiance and I are steak-lovers, and this was the perfect platform.  One mod - I rarely have fresh lemons on hand, so I used 'Real Lemon' instead.  Worked like a charm!

This is now the only way I prepare my steaks, except for one change: cut the quantity of lemon in half, which from my measurements means using half of one average size lemon. Also, keep in mind that the brand of soy sauce used matters, as different brands are saltier than others.

This is a fairly good marinade but watch the time allowed in the fridge. The "Up to 8 hours" is way too long and makes the flavor far too strong.

I would limit the marinade time to about 3 hours for the best results, at least if you want to taste the steak at all. Otherwise the only flavor present will be the marinade seasoning, which is pretty potent.

When used for grilling it does help the steak take a nice "semi-blackened" color quickly without requiring overcooking and excessive temperature. While I do like this recipe as an addition to my reportoire of marinades it is by no means the "Best Marinade In Existence" in my own humble opinion.

The husband and I loved this marinade!  I encourage every steak lover to try it and adjust it to your personal taste.  We love both rubs and marinades and we want to taste the meat, not just the seasoning.  We didn't blend it (just hand chopped) and marinated our ribeyes for 2 1/2 hours.  If they had sat for much longer, it would have been too much.  I could understand why some reviews said it was too overpowering if they read the recipe as 'marinate for 8 hrs' instead of UP TO 8 hrs.  We don't eat red meat very often but this recipe makes it impossible to stay away.  We're making it again tonight!

We tried this recipe last week and we're making it again tomorrow!  We get flat iron steaks from Kroger on sale on a regular basis; they are individually packaged and I can take the right amount out of the freezer whenever needed.  We did have a lot of leftover marinade last time, so I'm going to try Diyeana's idea of cooking the marinade with some mushrooms for a topping.  Can't wait to have it again!  Leftovers(if there are any) will be served the next day with take-and-bake baguettes for little steak sandwiches with a salad.

Good marinade. However, like another I don't use a blender; just whisked it. After using this recipe three times in three weeks (yes, I like it that much)I use less basil and use more garlic.

I wish i could give this more than 5 stars. Omg so good! I didnt add the hot pepper sauce but i did add about a tsp of minced garlic. Marinated 2 steaks that are about 1" thick 6 hours and popped them under the broiler after pouring a bit of marinade on top 5 minutes. Turn, poor more marinade on that side and broiled for another 3-4 minutes and sooooo good. moist, tender, a hint of acidity from the lemon juice and the basil pairs so well with the other flavors. Love it. Great job.

Love this, but be aware that it makes enough marinade for about six average size sirloin strips. I've used it twice so far and no complaints! I will try experimenting with it in the future.

Gave this a 4 based only on the flavour - I didn't really use it with intentions to tenderize meat - so I can't give it a 5 because I don't know how tender it will make a steak (but I intend to find out).  I thought the flavour of this was really great and it was easy because I had all the ingredients on hand already. I didn't find the taste was offputting like some other ratings said it was.  I also didn't puree the ingredients  - just because I didn't feel like dirtying more dishes! I cut the recipe in half and used 3 minced garlic cloves in place of the garlic powder and dried minced garlic. Had some sirloin steaks in the fridge and felt like trying a marinade so I whipped this together and marinated for only an hour - the flavour was really great after an hour but the marinade didn't have time to work yet (my own fault for not leaving it longer).  I am looking forward to trying this again on a more tough peace of meat for a much longer time period. The only thing I would change would be to add some salt - but I'm usually heavy handed with the salt anyway.  Thanks for a great recipe Kookie!

I would challenge the accuracy of the recipe name, but it is still  good. Reduced garlic powder to 1 Tbsp, added 1-1/2 T freshly diced garlic. After the first use, added 1/4 cup Sherry. Mix in bowl, marinate in frig. Very tasty. Top ten marinade, for sure. Best ... uh,no.

Yep, it was delicious. The steak was tender, and it definitely enhanced the meat flavor instead of overpowering it. The only thing I changed was adding a little white wine vinegar instead of lemon juice, because of personal preference. I will make this again.

This is wonderful it makes even the less expensive cuts of meat tasty and very tender. Have not added the hot sauce to the marinade but minced garlic adds a great kick to it.

I was excited to try something different and brought these marinated steaks to a family BBQ. This was served along with steaks marinaded in the traditional montreal steak marinade. Several people commented that this seasoning reminded them of an italian pesto. Ater everything was said and done all the montreal steaks had been devoured and several of the best steak marinade where left behind. Sorry to say I'm going to stick with the montreal seasoning.

Very good marinade. We like a little sweeter coating off the grill, so I used orange juice instead of lemon juice. Good!

Needed to rate this.  Made it as is.  I suggest you do this and make changes, if you feel it necessary, according to your own personal preference. 

Absolutely need to blend the ingredients.  It makes a BIG difference.  The ingredients can blend together.  I used my immersion blender - made the job simple.  And yes - it looks off but it'll be ok.  Once you grill it - you'll be left with a piece of meat that will look and taste beautiful.

I made it once in the morning to serve it that evening, once the day before I served it and once I froze it in the marinade.  They all pretty much tasted the same.  So I would say whatever is convenient. 

Also, I didn't feel the need to season my steak at the table - which is a bonus for me.

Thank you soooo much.

Excellent marinade plus I always have these ingredients on hand. After cooking the steak to a nice med-rare I let it rest and then served with basil butter. Serve on Foodies this one is a winner!

I rarely cook and this is the first marinade I ever made. Now, it still is my go-to recipe for all my steaks. Everyone I serve it to absolutely loves it. I don't ever want to try anything different! It is AMAZING. I also added a Montreal Steak Spice, which made it tastier. I didn't blend my ingredients but put it on the steak directly and flipped the steaks over a couple of times in the sauce, still delicious.

I have used this marinade many times on beef and pork and it always turns out perfect. With the steak I usually use the left over marinade and boil it on the stove and use it as a sauce for the meat, it is abslutely delicious!

This is really good, everyone loves it. I mostly just use it if I have a not so good cut of beef, I have also used it on pork. I have used this recipe probably 5 times. I leave out the oil though, and use minced fresh garlic instead of garlic powder though.

Rating it 5 with my additions, without it I would say about a 3. I used 3/4 cup of apple juice, 3/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of lemon juice. It was absolutely scrumptious! Without the apple juice/sugar it would have been just salty. What I added made it just slightly sweet, not overwhelmingly.

My family loves steak... they'd eat it every meal, if they could!... but no one cared for this marinade. I'm not sure if it was the basil or the overall combo, but it was way too sweet, and way too strong. Will not use this recipe again, and would not recommend.

This was very good however when I make it again I will definitely cut back on the soy sauce and Wocestershire sauce.  It was a little too salty. Otherwise it's a keeper.

I halved this recipe and followed the instructions almost exactly as written. My only variations were that I used jarred minced garlic instead of garlic powder and I did not blend the ingredients....I just put them in a large ziplock bag with the steaks. This is a decent marinade. The steaks turned out tender and flavourful but perhaps a wee bit salty. I'd like to try some of the other marinades on this site before going back to this one.

Four stars as written, five with a few tweaks.  I cut the Worcestershire sauce amount in half, I use low sodium soy sauce, I skip the garlic powder and dried minced garlic and use 3-4 cloves of fresh garlic that I mince instead, and I finely chop some onion to add. I also cut the lemon juice down to 1 Tablespoon. Don't fuss about finding or using white pepper. If you have black (or a melange like me that I freshly grind) that will work great as well. I don't bother putting all this in the blender - it's not really necessary. It simply all goes into a zip-lock bag, in goes the meat and it all goes in the fridge  for at least two hours. It gives a great flavor to the meat and it grills up tender, delicious and juicy every time!

Good stuff! I was never good with steaks but bought some because they were on sale.  This marinade is all I use on steaks now and I'm cooking steak more often because of this recipe.  I've never blended the ingredients, I mix them in a dish and let the steaks marinate overnight.  So good!

Excellent recipe for beef or venison!  Also great for a steak salad.  The only change I made was that I skipped the garlic powder and just added 2 Tbsp of minced garlic.  I also did not use the optional hot sauce because I was afraid of the high vinegar content and used red pepper flakes instead.

My family thought that this marinade was the best!  Has lots of flavor and makes the steaks very juicy!  This is a keeper.  I have made it several times and am asked when we have steak to please marinade it in this.  If you like lots of flavor this marinade is for you.

Very good marinade. I didn't have any parsley on hand so left it out. I marinated a sirloin steak for about 4 hours, grilled it then topped w/a pat of seasoned butter & let it rest 10 min. Sliced & served, we loved it.

Great marinade!  I love it because it's simple and it calls for ingredients that I usually have on hand.  I'm using it tonight to marinate antelope back straps!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Best steak I've ever had, I didn't have basil so I just used oregano, and used black pepper.  I pretty much just winged it with the amounts.  I have never ate a steak without A-1 sauce but I didn't need it with this, and it left me wanting more!  Definitely a keeper, thanks for sharing!

This is a pretty good recipe.  I marinated the steaks and cooked it on a skillet since I don't have a grill in my apartment.  The only problem was the herbs would get burned if you let the steaks sit on high heat.  So I would recommend let it slowly simmer on the skillet with a good amount of sauce.  The sauce tasted really good with rice.

This is by far the best marinade I have ever made. The steak had so much flavor. I ran out of garlic powder so I put in about .5 cup of minced garlic. I feel there can never be too much garlic... It turned out amazing. Will use again very soon.

My husband just came home from an exhausting four day scuba diving trip and I prepared this marinade as a "welcome home honey dinner." I used fresh garlic and low sodium soy and did everything else as suggested EXCEPT I didn't blend I just added all of the ingredients in a ziploc bag. I used fresh chopped garlic and kept everything else the same.  My husband could not stop raving about how tender and tasty the steaks were (I used flank steak boneless ribs)... I pan fried the steaks in 2 TBS of olive oil and then added fresh mushrooms, butter and a TBS of cornstarch with the remaining marinade. We will definitely be using this recipe again. I did find it on the saltier side (reason for four stars) but my extremely picky husband loved it and that is all that mattered to me.  He will definitely remember this "welcome home honey dinner" which I will be preparing again very soon OR maybe it will be a traditional meal for those times I welcome him home. We'll see...

We liked this a lot.  Tried it with steak, and then with pork chops.  My husband and I agreed that it was better on the pork chops!  We are still partial to the basic Montreal Steak Marinade for steak! ;)

Gee, I had to look to see who gave this recipe. This is pretty much my dad's recipe that he used for decades (he's now been gone for twenty years) but he was a pro at the grill and this was his steak marinade. It was always the best!!

My steak looked freezer burnt, but there was not hint of it at all. This marinate added wonderful flavor that stayed on throughout the grilling process.

Great recipe. I found it after I read that John Legend made it. There's a photo of him holding the steak, in your marinade, on his girlfriend's blog, So Delushious.
Kudos to you & your yummy marinade.

Loved this!  I followed the ingredients and ratios exactly, except that I used fresh basil, parsley and garlic.  I made kabobs and used this marinade for steak, chicken and the veggies.  Every single bite was delicious!  I always make enough to have some leftover for my lunch the next day, and wow......the meat tasted even better, cold, the next day.  I'm marinating a pork tenderloin in this tonight.  Can't wait to taste it!

I was looking for something quick and easy and I think I found a "keeper" with this recipe.  Very tasty and made with ingrediants most everyone will have on hand.  I marinated a piece of sirloin steak for about 8 hrs. then grilled it for 3-4 minutes per side.  Excellent flavor and tender.

Great recipe, bought eye of round steaks on sale, marinated for 4 days, steaks turned out tender, hubby said it was delicious, can't wait to try it with more expensive cuts of beef. This marinade would work perfect with pork, chicken and even seafood.

Followed the recipe exactly how you had it. I even added the optional ingridients. Although i dont like basil this was absolutely amazing. My steaks had great flavor and were really juicy. I didnt have the problems with the flames that i read about. It was not to salty nor potent. It was just perfect. One recipe made enough to cover 6 steaks. Thanks so much for sharing, this will definately be in my recipe box.

Best steak marinade I've ever had! I followed directions exactly and marinated t-bones for about 5 hours. Next time I think I will try and cut back on the oil and use fresh garlic. Very flavorful and juicy!

Bought two packs of t-bones on sale. First pack we tried with no marinade was really disappointing - tough and no flavour. Tried this recipe on the other pack and WOW!: tender, juicy and full of flavour. They smelled so heavenly when they hit the grill. Thanks for sharing this one!

Wow - the name is 100% accurate!  We marinade the steak overnight and the results are absolutely amazing!

Not impressed at all. I could taste the Worcestershire sauce mostly. It actually tasted like Argentinian Churrasco. It is the perfect marinade for it. All you'd need to add would be the Chimicurri sauce to the steak. Overall it's something I could say I won't do again. And for the record I marinated ROULADEN (pretty thin) for 2 days.

All I could taste was the lemon… It was a very bland marinade. I didn't like it and I wont be using it again.

OMG - Try this with kabobs!!!  The boyfriend bought some really cheap meat which I was expected to do something with as a "thank you" brunch for a friend of his from work who was helping him work on his prized '83 jeep.  I ended up cutting it into cubes and used this recipe to marinade - do not think I waited more than 15 minutes before putting them onto wood sticks and bbq'ing - it was absolutely wonderful!!!!  Cooked up some hashbrowns and eggs to go with and his friend still raves about what a good cook I am!!! (even after I admitted I found the recipe online!!!)

Even a brief 2-hours makes any steak taste incredible.  When you have a short marinade time, keep some of the mixture on the side for dipping.  That isn't needed if the full 8hr soak is possible.  This recipe name is actually fitting (as many claiming "best" usually aren't - this one IS the best steak marinade.

Holy Cow! I've done a lot of marinades and this really is the best. I used NY Strips and family and guests agreed this was one of the best steaks I've grilled. Thank you, this is my steak marinade for the summer!

Awesome!  I made shish-ka-bobs using stew meat and marinated it for only an hour and mmmmm so good!  Poured the rest of the marinade over the entire shish-ka-bobs and made the onions, cherry tomatoes and green peppers so much better!  Thanks for sharing!

Just made chicken breast from this tonight.  This is slap your momma good.  I didnt have white pepper - ran out of it and instead of the lemon juice, I used orange juice.  I like the sweeter taste though.  My friends loved it and made it for their parents, who in turned asked for the recipe.  This is divine.

Tasty, juicy and tender. Good for less expensive cuts. The first four ingredients are common to many marinades and are great for tenderizing. Most people would not marinate more expensive aged steaks but if you do, don't leave them in too long or they will get mushy.

I made this marinade yesterday afternoon and put a really tough cut of steak in it for about 24 hrs. Wellll.... my boyfriend ended up making shish kabob out of it on the grill and it was honestly the most tender, succelent, flavorful steak I've ever eaten!!! We both like our steak well done but my parents don't.... They went back for more and more and more! My mom couldn't stop talking about the flavor and how tender it was! The steak was such a tough cut to begin with, how it got that tender while being well done is beyond me. Amazing!

The only thing I did different was use lemon zest instead of lemon juice, didn't add worchester because I didn't have any (will next time) and put about  1 1/2 tblsp of dijon mustard in it. SOOOOO GOOD!! :)

Awesome!

I marinated two venison backstraps last night and it came out just awesome! I only had about 1 TBL of basil, and I added in some black pepper. I was too lazy to blend it, so it all just went in a ziplock bag and left on the counter for about an hour. After the venison had marinated and was on the grill, I took the left over juice and poured it into a foil pack of mushrooms that went on the grill too. They came out just delicious.

I think in the future I might cut down the oil a bit. Will DEFINITELY use again!!

my husband said it had a nice flavour and when he bbq'd it it didnt burn he rated it a 4 !/2  he also says its an excellent marinade for a thin steak. My daughter on the other hand rated it a 31/2. She says eegh- I dont know, i thought it could have been a little steakier! (She is 13) So on average it came out to a 4. I could go either way -

I used this recipe for a thick shoulder steak. Didn't have garlic powder, lemons, or white pepper so I substituted 3 large cloves of garlic (Italian household...need lots of garlic), fresh lime juice, and black pepper. I also added in a little dried oregano and omitted the pepper sauce. I thought 8 hours of marinating was too short, especially for a thick cut, so I went up to 20 hours. After taking the steak out of the marinade I boiled the extra for a few minutes so I could use it to baste portabella mushrooms (also grilled). Amazing! The 20 hours was a good choice, and I think it would have been better if I had let it sit for 24, but I was very happy with the result. Even my husband (the grill master in our family) absolutely loved it! I'll be adding this to my recipe book!

Everyone really loved this.  By some miracle, I actually had all the ingredients on hand, except I used fresh garlic and fresh parsley.  I also didn't blend the marinade - I just left it chunky.  I marinated boneless pork loin chops for about 24 hours, flipping a couple of times, then we grilled them.  They were fantastic.

This is an awesome marinade I will agree with some of the others it's not the best in existence but it's really good. I did two version one the ay it was written and the other by adding balsamic vinegar The balsamic adds a little something to it that I love maybe it's it's the sweetness. I will be trying this recipes again because the marinade didn't take away from the natural taste of the steak.

FOR PEOPLE WITH SOY ALLERGIES:

To substitute the 1/3 cup soy sauce called for in the recipe, I used three packets G. Washington's Rich Brown Seasoning & Broth (found in my local Giant's organic section, 1/3 cup water, 1 tsp. balsamic vinegar, 1/2 tsp. dark molasses, and a pinch each of ground ginger, white pepper, and garlic powder. Mixed up these ingredients and microwaved for 1 minute to dissolve; it yielded 1/3 cup 'soy' sauce. Then I continued with the marinade recipe as written. Delicious!!

The soy sauce substitute was taken from Rongway's "Soy Sauce Substitute Recipe" right here on allrecipes - the first ingredient in that recipe is beef bouillon, but read your labels - I've yet to find any flavor standard bouillon that doesn't contain a soy ingredient, so be sure to check out a specialty store or the organic section.

This really IS the best marinade in existence! I ran out of Worcestershire so I put a splash of A1. While the grill was heating, I took the steak out put sliced mushrooms in the marinade and then sauteed them while the meat cooked. It was to die for!

This marinade was just ok. I didn't put the hot sauce in mine. It did make the meat very flavorful but it tasted a lot like teriyaki to me which I found a little odd for a steak.

This is my go to marinade. It's just wonderful! You can easily substitute vegetable oil for the olive oil, and lime juice, for the lemon juice. Turns out great either way!

this is an excellent marinade...my guest thought it was one of the best things steaks I have ever made.  I used Filet Mignon steak from Costco, and marinated it about 5 hours (is all the time I had)
If you want a non sweet marinade this is the one to use.  Thank you for sharing it! I did not add the hot pepper sauce but may try a dash next time :)

"Best Marinade In Existence" is not an exxageration.  I tried this tonight for the first time, and it was the best tasting steak I have ever made!!  It was easy, and I had almost all the ingredients already.  It was DELICIOUS!!!!

Followed the spirit of the recipe. Used Italian dressing instead of oil or basil. The steaks turned out really good and tender.

This is definitely the best marinade I have ever made. My in-laws and husband always use steak sauce with their steaks, and no one even mentioned it tonight. These steaks were wonderful and so flavorful. The only change I made was to use minced garlic. I use it on everything, I also added about a teaspoon of accent, it gives the flavor a boost. Will definitely use this again! Thanks!

Did not like it at all.  I guess I was looking for something with more of a garlic flavour.  Not a big Worcestershire fan so maybe that was part of the problem.

Very good - I used two cloves of minced fresh garlic instead of the dried, and omitted the parsley and garlic powder.  I marinated the steak for about two hours, and it give the meat great flavor without covering it up too much.   We liked it!

I dont know if this is the best marinade ever (since i haven't tasted them all), but I can definitely say this is the best marinade I have ever used.  The taste permeates the meat and it just wonderfully flavorful. I used this to marinate sirloin steaks and then to marinate T-bone steaks (for the 1st dinner I ever cooked for my boyfriend).  I was so nervous but he really liked it.  Instead of the tsp of dry minced garlic I used one whole garlic clove.  It. Was. Great. I searched and searched for a good recipe that would be worth the time and just decided to go for it....so to all you skeptical people who don't want to waste your time on a marinade that isn't good...TRY THIS!!!!

This is super delish!  I made 4 different marinades from this site, "A Marinade to Die for", "Teriyaki Marinade", "Steak Marinade I"... I am very impressed with this one.  I let the meat marinate for around 4 days and then grilled it, hubby and the kids loved it!

I made it three times now and received rave reviews from my guests each time.  I ddin't use a blender. After the first time, I cut back the oil to 1/3 cup and didn't notice any difference in taste. Love the recipe.

this is an amazing recipe! I didn't use the hot sauce because I didn't have it on hand, and used reg. minced garlic instead of dried... but sooooooooo tasty. Have used it on filets (AMAZING!!) and am currently testing it on chuck tender steaks... yummy yummy yummy AND most of the ingredients are already in the pantry :)

Pork Tenderloin and this marinade were created for each other. Didn't use the optional items. If you like super lean tender meat that lacks flavor from not enough marbling then can't go wrong here.... Slice the pork like a loaf of bread then cut those slices in half and grilled in a basket.

Doubled the ingredients, 4 large Filet Mignon's, blended ingredients in BlendTec Mixer,(The Secret - we marinaded them for 2 nights turning them every morning and evening), Placed on a Treager Grill using mequite pellets at 375 for 30 minutes, turned over and cooked another 7-10 minutes. The Filet Mignon's were at least 1 3/4 inch thick. The result - PErfection like none other. The filets MELTED in our mouths and no other sauce was necessary. My most sincere compliments to the creator of this recipe. We absolutely love it. Also, using fresh ingredients works best.

This is my go to steak marinade. Makes the meat tender and gives it a wonderful flavor. The spices look like too much, but they make the meat so flavorful. I didn't blend the marinade, just mixed it in a Ziploc bag and put the steaks in. I skipped the hot sauce and dried mince garlic.

This steak marinade really is amazing 5/5 stars. The steaks came out so tender and juicy. It would have been blasphemy to add additional toppings.  Normally I'm a green butter kind of girl, but with this marinade forget it.

Delicious and so easy!  It makes any type of steak cut come out tender and full of flavor.  I use this almost any time I make steak now.  Also, my husband used the leftovers on potatoes before roasting them .... what a fantastic way to use the marinade without throwing out!

Just finished enjoying the marinade, I will for sure use it again!  I used fresh garlic instead of the powder and black pepper as I didn't have any white.  Very satisfied!

This was a good marinade. I think I will try it again and cut down on the lemon or soy, it was a little...tangy. But I had thick steaks so they turned out delicious!

This was excellent!  My husband and sons gave it two thumbs up each!  Really made the steaks delicious.  My only changes:   I dont ever use Garlic Powder, so I minced a large clove of garlic.  I also couldn't resist:  I added a couple squirts of Dijon Mustard.  I think this would be delicious to use on grilled halibut, salmon or shrimp too--  we will try that soon!

This was GREAT!!  Our Boy Scouts had a campout this past weeekend and wanted steak on a stick.  I cut chuck roast into strips and marinated it in this.  This marinade makes even cheaper cuts of meat tender.  Even the Scouts asked for the recipe.

This marinade definitely lives up to its name!  I made it twice in the last 4 days and it was amazing both times!  I followed the recipe exactly as listed, including the optional items, except for using lemon juice from the bottle.  Will be using this to make steaks many more times!!!

Attention everyone, this steak marinade is the best home made marinade recipe to date! I was pretty skeptical at first but after my first bike without an A1 sauce, it made me a believer. The taste just exploded in my mouth! The thinner the steak, the more you can taste the flavor! Try it out, the worst that can happen is you won't make it again ;)

Awesome! Made as is and used a slightly thinner cut of new york steak (all I had) and marinated for 4 hours. Turned out perfect. I've always love the salty and tangy combination. Probably not a favorite of my daughter but it's something I can go back to when Im too lazy to make our favorite steak & onion recipe.

We love steak of all kinds in my household. I ran out of  the store bought marinade that I usually buy so I tried this today. I will never buy store bought marinade again! It really is the best marinade I have ever had. I just wish I had more steak ;)

I tried it and it had a bit too much garlic flavor for my tastes.  MY TASTES.  This could be because I used a super fine garlic powder or maybe because I am a vampire.  It's all rather subjective, you see. I also found that fresher lemon juice and knowing the basics of how to cook will prevent a tough steak. That being said, I cut the worcestershire by a couple tablespoons, used two very fresh lemons, and added a couple tablespoons of Brown sugar.  Freekin' Awesome.

this is a good marinade. i wouldn't say it's extraordinary. i marinated two rib eye steaks for about 24 hours. they were definitely good, but between marinading for 24 hours and throwing some montreal steak spice and worcestershire an hour before cooking - not that crazy of a difference. if you're using an excellent cut of meat is a lot more important.

Thanks for such a great marinade. Totally ran out of basil so I picked some flower which was left on the basil stalk in the garden and throw it into the marinade after it's all blended. The flavor was amazing! The steak I used was silced too thin, but it was still good. I am sure it will be perfect with the thicker sliced steak. Can't wait to make it again!

I thought the marinade was great. I used it on 2 1/2 pounds of top sirloin. I found the amount of basil and parsley to be a waste as most of it gets left behind in the bowl and washed down the drain, not to mention the dried herbs absorb the marinade and rob it from the meat. I will use less next time as I don't think 3 Tbs of basil, and 1 1/2 Tbs of parsley is really necessary. I will also reduce the lemon juice to 1/4 cup as it didn't overpower but was on the verge in my opinion. I used Sriracha pepper sauce and left out the additional minced garlic because this sauce contains garlic. I didn't use white pepper as I'm not a fan, instead I used black. It needs a little something, perhaps a little coriander.

Really delicious. The ONLY change I will make the next time I make this is to cut the lemon juice down from 1/3 to 1/4 cup, because after a few bites the acidity built up with nothing to counterbalance it. Other than that, the flavor was fantastic.

I usually don't use marinade for my steaks but this sounded good so I tried it tonight. Ribeye for me and sirloin for my husband. I let it sit in the marinade for about 1 1/2 hours and when I grilled it the smell was wonderful. It tasted even better than it smelled and my husband said it was great and he hardly ever compliments my cooking. This recipe will be used again and again.

Awesome steak marinade! I made the full recipe, froze half and put the other half on a lb of Ribeyes overnight. Grilled them last night and they were tender and SO delicious! Will definitely use again! :)

Worth getting your blender dirty!!!  The only adjustment I make - is using a tablespoon of horseradish in place of the pepper. OMG.  Thank you so much, Kookie.  Best steak I've ever made!!!

This was SOOOOO GOOOODDD!!!!!!!! I'm telling you, you gotta try this, it complemented the steak perfectly, didn't mask the flavor, tender juicy flavorful steaks, marinated in just an hour and a half. I followed it perfectly except one thing: i didnt have white pepper so i used black pepper.

great flavor!  i marinated the steaks for 3 days (as we ended up not being home) and was a little worried the lemon juice would eat it up, but it was fine.  will definately use this again.

Love it!  I didn't blend it in a mixer either; just put it in a container, threw in ingredients, and shook it up to mix.  Then I put the steaks in the container to marinade. Delicious.

Used Tri-tip steak from Costco, which I had never cooked before and it was one of the best steaks I have ever had.  Marinade kept it moist and flavorful.  We ate steak leftovers on a salad the next day and it was amazing.  You HAVE to try this recipe.

This is delicious and I sometimes change the spice ingredients around a bit. Still always awesome. The core oil/lemon/soy/worchestershire is also good on its own and if you leave over night it will tenderize tougher cuts of meat. Thanks kookie.

It's wonderful. I didn't add the hot pepper or minced garlic, I marinated the steaks for just over 24 hours... they were tender, flavorful, and my boyfriend declared them better than the $40 steaks we ate one (expensive) night on vacation. I'll make this OVER AND OVER AGAIN! Eager to try it with something else, too!

I mixed up this recipe minus the optional items (didn't have the pepper sauce on hand) and it was AWESOME! I did as some other reviewers did and did it in a zip lock bag and threw my steaks in. My husband loved it and my two year old ate almost a whole steak herself. She is not usually a big meat eater, so I was impressed! Definitely a recipe I will be using on a regular basis from now on.

I think this would have been very good, but the Worchestershire sauce was very heavy and overpowered the other flavors. I even added a little more olive oil and lemon juice but the next day the Worchestershire was still too strong. I would tone it down to just a couple teaspoons next time.

I usually don't like my steaks marinaded, but do it sometime because my wife likes it. This marinade may have changed my mind. I let the steaks marinade in it for a little over 24 hours and then grilled them. Excellent!

This was a really good marinade. I marinated my steaks overnight and then tasted the marinade the next day. It had a slight more lemon taste than i like for a steak so I added some more soy and let marinade another day. AWESOME! I also did not blend the ingredients, I put steaks (4 ribeyes) in a gallon ziplock and turned periodically

Absolutely fantastic marinate. I used in on a flank steak that I trim and put on a sandwich and it was great. I will definitely use again. This marinate made the meal.

I don't know about it being the "best", but still quite good. I marinated the steaks overnight and they were nice and tender.

This was very good.  I think next time I'll add more garlic!  I also made some steak and froze it with the marinade so we'll see how good that turns out - marinading and freezing can be awesome!!  My dad loved it for father's day and it kept the steak moist during grilling.

Used it on filet mignon for fathers day...got RAVE reviews. ONLY change I made was to add 1/4 cup cheap Paisono red wine....but that's because I add it to almost everything.  Fantastic marinade

I made this marinade for my dad and brother to take along for their weekend at the lake.  When they got home, one of the first things they said was how good the marinade was.  I used Frank's Hot Sauce for the hot pepper sauce.

I used this to marinate beef rib shorts for beef kabobs. I was making it and was kind of wondering with all the basil if it would turn out as well as it looked. the ingredients are a bit off the wall and random but I have to say i was genuinely impressed at the first beef tester and proceeded to baste the entire kabob layout with the sauce. WOW!! did they turn out amazing. i didn't have garlic powder on hand so i substituted with garlic salt, used the minced garlic and used Tabasco instead of pepper sauce. 5 stars from me sir, i have bookmarked it and will be using this amazing concoction again in the future!!

In my husbands words "this is good, this is really, really good.  This may be the best steak I've ever eaten!"  The only change I made was omit the hot sauce and it only had time to marinade for about 45 minutes. Great recipe!

I mixedingediants in a ziplock, stabbed steaks as if I were killing the cow myself and let them sit over night and all day. FIRST time in my life that I did not eat cow with ketchup! So flavorful, but not quite 5 stars for my taste buds.

I know taste is entirely a matter of opinion, but did not like this marinade.  I suppose if you prefer a tangy/tart flavor then you might like it.  I would prefer a simple salt/garlic rub.

This is fabulous.  I upped the amount of hot sauce and let the meat marinade overnight in a plastic bag in the fridge.  Moist and delicious.  I used the same ingredients minus the Worcestershire sauce to marinate a big bowl of veggies for about 8 hours and then did them in the grill basket.  The two went together beautifully.

Awesome! I didn't have white pepper or hot sauce, and I didn't blend, just dumped all the ingredients in a gallon ziploc with the meat and shook it all up. Marinated 2 hours - meat was SO flavorful and moist. Will definitely pass this recipe along and use it again!

This tasted good, but I thought the flavor of the marinade overpowered the flavor of the steak a little bit. Next time I think I'll play around with the ingredients to see if I can tone it down a little.

The title of this is definitely appropriate.  I have yet to find a better marinade anywhere.  I do admit to cutting back a bit on the soy and adding a bit more worcestershire.  But that is a personal preference.  This is great as is!

Excellent marinade! Marinaded a sirloin overnight and it came out juicy and tasty. Also marinaded my chicken breast for 2 hours before using in stir fry and that was excellent as well. I think I will try it next with pork chops. Thank you.

Great marinade.  I only made half of the recipe for 1 large cut, and it was perfect.  Very very flavorful, but not overwhelming.  Will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this last night and it was amazing.  I used 1/4c of olive oil and used fresh minced garlic because that is all I had.  I followed the rest to a tee.  My husband loved it and it made a lesser cut of beef taste so flavorful!  I will definitely make it again!  also, I did not blend it in the blender.

I didn't have any garlic or garlic powder on hand, but this was still a stellar marinade! Our steaks marinated for about 3 hours before hitting the grill and they were delicious. I'm sure that the garlic would make this even better, so I'm giving 5 stars. :)  I didn't use the blender, just a whisk, and things mixed up perfectly.

Really liked the marinade...our mistake was not having a very good cut of meat. (We bought a half of a cow that was grass fed. The steaks weren't the best this time around) I can't wait to try it again with a really great steak! I know that it will be much more delicious.

YUM!  This marinade was delicious!  Perfect.  The  only think I might change next time I use this is a little less olive oil....maybe 1/4 cup.  I grilled it on high for approx. 5 minutes, turned the heat down to med & grilled another 5 minutes.  Turned the steaks and contiued grilling on med for about 7 minutes.  Will definetly use this marinade again.

I used a bit less olive oil and garlic powder, but added crushed fresh garlic (in place of dried) and a little grated ginger. Used lime juice instead of lemon and fresh parsley instead of dried. Flank steak got rave reviews.

This was good, and I will use it again.  I was in a hurry, so I didn't blend the ingredients, just mixed them together.  Next time I will use the blender as the "green stuff" scared my kids!

Did not care for this marinade.  I will stick to the steak tip marinade on this site which only has 4 ingredients, and is awesome.

It IS the BEST!!  Every time I use it, my husband and I comment on how it is better than any steak we have had in restaurants.  The last few times, I haven't had Worsteshire sauce, and it still beats any restaurant steak!

I thought this was so-so.  Read the reviews.  I read only the top part of the ingredients, not realizing there were more below (I guess it printed weird).  The funny thing was, what I was adding to make the recipe my own is what was listed below!  I did not have white pepper.  I added some lime juice, etc...I think that the blending may be the key (I just mixed mine like some others did).  They marinated all day, the flavor was ok, but I'll take plain ol' salt, pepper and garlic on my steak anyday over this.

Very good marinade. I took top sirloin and prepared it with a Jacaard needling device. Ifv you don't own one they are well worth the money. I then let the prepared steaks sit in the marinade over night. The result was a very tender and tasty steak.

Absolutely delicious!  We usually use a favorite restaurant marinade, but we were out, so I whipped this up instead to use on our T-bones.  So good!  My husband couldn't stop raving.

Excellent and different. You have to love basil for this one. The basic really comes through. Would like to try it on chicken or seafood, maybe on a bed of pasta.

I have used many of marinades in my time and this one beats all. I didn't even use the greatest cut of steak and I only let it marinate for a few hours and this was excellent. It was so tender and yet one particular ingredient did not overpower another. We couldn't even taste one specific thing but just an overall great flavor. This has become my all time favorite and I will use over and over again. Thank you!!

I read some of the low rated reviews and get this. If you don't like garlic, worcestershire, or soy sauce, don't use this. But if you want your steaks to be butter knife tender and to have a full flavor better than the most upscale steak house in town, use it. I added a liitle adobo for kick and kept the steaks in the frig overnight. Absolutely the best steaks ever. Thanks Kookie.

This one is a keeper! So simple to make and tasty too.  I did as another reviewer and mixed all the ingredients together without a blender.  Put the steaks in baggy and pulled them out of the fridge after 8 hours marinating.  I can eat this one without steak sauce which is unusual.  The title alone says it all.

Great marinade! I used teriyaki instead of soy sauce and did not use the hot pepper sauce, but I will next time. I also used fresh minced garlic in place of the dried. Marinated for about 4 hours, but will marinate overnight next time. Great flavor! Mixing in blender is great because it thickens the marinade and really brings all the flavors together. Will use again and again, thank you!

Used lemon juice from concentrate. Everything else--followed exactly up to par. I *did* use ground red pepper instead of white. And I also added just 1/2 tsp of ginger for that extra kick :) DELICIOUS!

This is a wonderful marinade. I used it on some bone-in NY steaks and the flavor was perfect. I put them in the marinade in the morning and bbq'd them that evening. The marinade is thick, so it stays with the meat while it cooks. The lemon was not overwhelming ... just right. Thanks for a definite do again recipe!

My husband is extremely particular when it comes to steak.  I could not make a steak for him at home that he enjoyed until I found this marinade.  Now, we enjoy eating in!  This makes the steak so tender!

This was great! When I 1st mixed it to put over our venison steaks I wasn't too sure - it didn't smell good to me but after about 6 hours of marinating the steaks were wonderful! It isn't overpowering - it has a very delicate flavor. I will use this from now on - thanks for posting!!!

This is the best marinade ever!  Made steaks the other night for my family using this marinade and have to admit...they were the best steaks I've ever made.  Tender, juicy, flavorful...yummy!  We are having friends over for a get-together tomorrow...I planned the get-together just so I can show off this steak marinade recipe!  LOL....can't wait.

I can't recall how many times I have used this.  I have 100's od friends that say that it is the best steak that they have ever had !!! .... at first i felt like people were just being nice but after at least 20 party's, then i started to beleive that they really meant that this was the best steak that they had.  I let is soak in at LEAST 2 days and it is GREAT!  ... However DO NOT frezze the steaks with this is losses so much flavor it's a shame to frezze it ... I hope you will love this as much as i do ...   BY THE WAY my father always uses steak sauce and this is the first time he never used steak sauce!

This did not blow our socks off.  It was good but will stick with our favorite steak marinade that does blow our socks off.  Was nice to try something different and we always hope to find a new favorite.  I marinated top sirloin for almost 2 days due to a change of plans.  Good but not better than our standby.  Thanks for the recipe.

The name of this recipe totally fits.  We have been eating cheaper cuts of steak all summer due to the economy and I got to the point where I just could not eat them anymore until this recipe.  I once again bought a cheap sirloin steak on sale.  Followed this recipe exactly and let them marinate for 24 hours in a ziploc bag.  I did flip the bag around from side to side in the fridge a few times so each side was marinated properly.  Grilled them up and I was in steak heaven.  The flavor was fantastic and tender like you would not believe. We talked about those steaks for days!!!

Yum!  Also very delicious quick-marinade for the mushrooms.  After throwing the steaks on the grill, toss the mushrooms in the marinade for 5 minutes and then saute until nicely browned.  SO good!!!

This is very good. I made slight changes by using smashed whole garlic cloves and a bit less basil. I didn't think the hot sauce was necessary. As recommended by another reviewer, I set aside some of the marinade and used it to saute mushrooms and onions to accompany the steaks - yummy.

This is an excellent recipe.  I marinated a flank steak in it for about 8 hours and my family raved about the flavor.  My husband commented numerous times how delicious it was.  I did not add the optional ingredients and it was still wonderful.  One note - this recipe makes quite a bit of marinade.  I had a 1.75 lb. flank steak and had alot of leftover marinade, so will maybe halve the recipe the next time.

This was wonderful! Bottom round roasts were on sale, so I bought a few and cut them into steaks to try several different marinades. This one had the lowest expectations and turned out to be the best! I am not a huge fan of pepper, but this one had the perfect amount for me.  Hubby loves pepper and says he could taste it and it was the perfect amount.  He would suggest using more, because he is a fanatic, but its not often that he is satisfied with the amount of pepper. He would suggest more to further suit his own tastes, but states it is fabulous as is.  If I were going to change anything, I would add more hot pepper sauce, as I used a cayenne pepper sauce and felt that was more of the pepper flavor I was tasting. Definately taste the basil in it and would like to try with fresh basil. Outstanding! Have been looking for a great marinade to use on steaks that I'm too afraid to ruin with marinade and have decided this couldn't ruin any steak around.  Unbelievable!

OMG this was so good, the only thing I did different was I used 2t of minced garlic instead of the powdered and the dried and I didn't blend it just put it all in a bag and let it set for 5 hours (all the time I had) I can't wait til I can make this again. This is a keeper. Thank you Kookie

By far the best marinade I've found yet. I followed the recipe exactly. I used this with Ribeyes, and I'm going to try it with tenderloins this weekend.

This IS the best marinade ever! Adds lots of flavor. I don't buy bottled anymore. Thanks, Kookie, this is one recipe I will be printing out for my son. He is moving across the country and I'm putting together a book of favorite recipes for him. You rock.

I used this marinade on flat iron steaks and they were awesome.  I did not have dried minced garlic, so i used fresh minced garlic.  I also used my blender bottle and shook the ingredients together instead of dirtying the blender.  It turned out very well and I will definitely use again.

I just read this recipe yesterday and decided to try it, as i was planning to grill steaks for my family anyway. I only marinated them for about two hours. but they turned out great! The only substitution I made was some bottled lemon juice and some fresh lime juice. Only because that was all I had on hand. The seasonings were just right. I did use the hot sauce, which i recommend. Will definitely use again.

I used this marinade on some Porterhouse steaks that I grilled.  I thought the filet side came out quite nice, but the flavor of the marinade was a little too subtle for sirloin side--we added A1 Bold & Spicy to that.

Flavor was superb and everyone loved the london broil that I marinated. I only let it marinate for 4 hrs and it was delish. This is a nice change from my italian dressing marinade.

This is the first time I felt the need to post a review.  This is excellent!  I used it on boneless chicken breasts and even my 5 year old loves it.  We will use it for steaks tomorrow.  I have used other marinade recipes and nothing ever worked.  Even some of the teens that hang outside our house with our son tasted some of the chicken off the grill and said it was the best they ever tasted.  One begged me for the recipe.  I did add a little brown sugar and ground mustard.  I will use this all summer long.  My husband's only complaint, there wasn't enough for seconds.

Absolutely "5" Stars.  It really is one of the best ever.  Marinated Flank Steak overnight in this and it was fabulous.  No changes at all.  This will be used time and time again.

Great! - did not have the white pepper or garlic powder but just added more minced garlic and red pepper flakes - marinated for about 6 hours and the steaks where full of flavor.  Will make again.

Way too much basil.  The rest of it was good, though, so I will probably make it again and just leave out the oregano (and probably some of the parsley, I didn't like having so much dried greens on my steak.   WIth the exception of the basil, the taste was otherwise good, so I'll update this after I've tried it again with some adjustments.

My husband said that if a steakhouse had served him that steak and charged him $20, he'd be happy to pay it.  Our two steaks cost about $12 and I had all the remaining ingredients in my pantry, so I figured I earned myself a new pair of shoes!  (I didn't have garlic powder, so I used fresh pressed garlic.)

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I added some liquid smoke to mine to give it a little more kick but other than that it is the best marinade I have found to date. Try this recipe, you will be glad you did.

Wow, what wonderful flavor.  My DH is a little picky, so I only marinated my ribeye.  I was planning to grill it after only 3 hours, however, we were called away for the evening.  After soaking it for over 24 hrs. I grilled it and managed to get my DH to taste mine and he actually said he liked it.  This ones a keeper.

Very good, but goodness, this makes a lot of marinade.  My husband surprised me with this for dinner.  He swears that he followed the recipe exactly and the meat was swimming in the marinade.  Very good recipe, thanks!  Updated:  this is the only marinade we use any more. It is consistent with good flavor every time without being overpowering.

This seriously is the best steak marinade in existence. I follow the recipe exactly and think that putting it in the blender nicely combines the flavors. I will usually pour this over steak at night and grill it the next day after work. Longer than 8 hours but it's delicious. This marinade makes even the lowest grade steak taste delicious.

This recipe has ruined my adventuresome spirit as I don't use any other!  It's such a great blend of flavours, without overpowering the meat.  I marinade a beef fillet as a standard when having company, it's a no fail. Tsee commented about the taste of balsamic, but the recipe doesn't call for this! The only change I make is use fresh garlic rather than powdered.

Wow, When I fist mixed all ingrediants except the parsley, because I did not have any, I was a little nervous,  because of the amount of Basil the marinade did not look to tasty, even a little scary. When we cooked it on the grill still a little scary because the Basil causes the steak to become very dark. Then I had my 1st bite. That was when the WOW factor came in, I loved it this is a keeper. (I as well did not use a mixer). This recipe is really good, I have always been told that my marinade is the best anyone has had, I'm not so sure anymore. If anyone would like to try another very simple steak marinade that is awesome, all you need is 2 part  Wish Bone Robusto Itlian dressing and 1 part Kikkoman teriyaki marinade. I never measure I just make sure that there is more dressing than merinade. I have made my marinade forever because everyone loves it so much,I'm so glad to finally find another marinade that is very good

This is a very good marinade but I gave it only 4 stars because it simply wasn't what I was looking for and is not necessarily my preference.  Having said that though the flavors were wonderful together and everyone else really like it.  It taste's like an Asian marinade of some sort (Asian BBQ?). The salty soy sauce and sweet balsamic are very pronounced.  I marinated for 24 hours and the steak came out fabulously juicy and tender!  However, If I try this again I'll marinade for a little less time because I couldn't really taste the actual beef.  I used sirloin steaks.

This is wonderful.  Didn't blend it or add the optional hot sauce but did everything else as directed.  Marinated 2 days the first time, 2 hours the second.  Both times it was so good it left me longing for more.

This was a wonderful marinade. I popped steaks into it the night before. They were mildly flavoured and were extremely tender and juicy. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because we like a lot of flavour in our house. But this marinade will become part of the regular rotation.

Very, very tasty! I made this exactly as directed except I used fresh garlic instead of powdered (two generous teaspoonfuls for a half batch of this recipe) and I did not blend it. I only had time to marinate the meat for two hours, but it still came out great. I will definitely make this again.

Bravo! Excellent marinade. Only thing I changed was instead of lemon juice I used red vinegar. Used it on skirt steak, marinated it for 10 hours, and it was outstanding.

I used this for cubed steak and used black pepper instead of white pepper.  I cooked on the stovetop after marinading in fridge for 1/2 hour.  I poured left over marinade into pan with it as it cooked.  Came out very flavorful!

Very tasty!  My husband would disown me if I marinated a 'good' steak (ribeye, NY strip) so I used a London broil- this was much better than the bottled marinades I have been using.  Even my husband thought it was good!

This recipe is a good one because most of these items I found in my pantry. It just didn't come out as good. This could be due to a couple of reasons: 1) the wrong cut of meat 2) not enough marinating time. If you want a quick marinating recipe, this is probably not the one. I will try this again though with a different cut and more time for marinating.

This truly is the best marinade in existance! My dad even asked what was in it and he is the king of the grill. This was easy and quick to make and didn't require and weird ingredients that I don't usually have in my kitchen. Ten out of ten!

Great marinade!  I substituted pesto in place of the basil cause it's what I had on hand and marinated steak for about 7 hours.

Very good, but maybe not "the best"....but hey, it's all a matter of personal taste!  :)  We enjoyed it.  I did cut back on the basil some after reading other reviews, and may take it back to 1/2 the next time....yes, we will make this again because it's very good!  I would marinate at least 24 hours, I think we actually did 48, but the longer the better in my opinion.  Thanks for sharing!

The basil flavor is quite pronounced. This marinade is pretty decent, even though in my case, I only marinaded the N.Y. strips for three hours. ADDENDUM: I used this marinade on July 4, 2018 and marinaded our K.C. strips for 24 hours , and the extra time made all the difference in the world. This will continue to be one of my go to marinades.

Nice and tasty. I used fresh garlic instead of powder. 

I don't think it will be in my all time favorite list though, I'm sorry. 

I like marinades witha bit more zing.

Best in Existence? Not sure, haven't tried them all yet. This is easily an "Incredible" one though. Personally, dropped down the basil a bit and bumped up the garlic with fresh minced and 12 hour marinade (1.5 lb cut). Made it for the 2nd time in one month tonight. Trying a 24 hour marinade. Great recipe.

I found the worchestershire sauce very strong in the taste of this marinade. I like this sauce but think there is too much called for here. I was hoping this marinade would tenderize my steaks more than it did. No one complained about this marinade but no one complimented it either. Thanks anyway.

We absolutely loved this marinade. It is easy to make, and within a few hours, steaks taste wonderful. The first time I made it, I mixed it by hand in a bowl, which was OK, but the herbs remained a little too chunky for our tastes. The next time, I blended it as directed in the original recipe, and it was perfect. I marinated New York Strips in this for about 4-5 hours, then used some of the marinade to baste while grilling. Excellent!

This really is the best ever.  I never have been that thrilled with steak on the grill...until now.  This is perfect, because it is not too salty like some other marinades.  The taste was amazing!

I used freeze dried basil, onion powder instead of garlic (about a teaspoon), and about 2 tsp minced garlic.  I also let these marinate overnight, as dinner plans ended up changing.  We grilled them tonight for dinner with company.    Was it the "best in existence"?  The general consensus was no, but it was good.  Will I do it again?  Maybe.  I'll probably keep searching for one that my family raves about.

I made this exactly as the recipe calls, but this was too acidic for my taste.  I would make this again, but bring the lemon juice down to 1 tablespoon.  I did like the combination of everything else, but it was just too acidic with the 1/3 cup of lemon juice.

The whole family LOVED the taste of this marinade.  I wasn't crazy about the smell when it was all mixed together so I was a little hesitant, but it was very flvorful and yummy.

The only things I did different were....I used bottled lemon juice instead of fresh and I used black pepper instead of white (only because thats what I had available).  Also I didn't put in the blender/mixer.  I just mixed it all up and threw it all in a ziploc bag overnight.

I'll definitely use this recipe again although next time I will buy a less lean/more tender cut of steak (my own fault).  I bought a marinating steak (this is what it said on the package) and it was quite tough.

I used 5 large cloves of garlic, a generous handful of fresh parsley and a generous handful of fresh basil instead of the powder/dried.  Wizzed it with the hand mixer and reserved some for basting.  Marinated for about an hour and it was great!

Great marinade; perfect as shown.  Steaks will melt in your mouth.  Also great on chicken.  My son (who is very picky) begs me to make "that chicken".  Thanks for the recipe.

I found myself going on line scrambling for a meat marinade recipe.  While I didn't have any dried minced garlic on hand, I had all the other ingredients.  I've printed this recipe off and it's now in my "Meats" section of my recipe book.  Without a doubt, it's a keeper so thanks Kookie!!

I would not consider this one of the best marinades out there, I thought it was ok though.  The steak was tender and I had all of the ingredients on hand so it was convenient.  I will not make this again.

I didn't have parsley and this was still great.  I peirced both sides of the steaks several times with a fork to speed up the marinade.  I did it on my foreman grill for 1 1/2 min.  No need for A-1 or any other sauce.  This has lots of flavor.

I got an outdoor grill for Christmas, and wanted to find a quick and easy marinade for some ribeyes, came across this. The first time I used it, I didn't use my blender and it still turned out wonderful. The second and third time, I did and it had a different flavor, but still wonderful. My boyfriend who is the Master-Griller loved it as well.

This is a great marinade. I use it on rib eyes and add a touch of fresh grated ginger and fresh herbs instead of the dry and it tastes awesome!

I don't get it.  Everyone loved this recipe and I followed it to a T; but I didn't care for it.  It SMELLED good but it didn't taste very great.  It was edible but I would have prefered to just marinate the steak in plain old soy sauce for 30 minutes.  The steak tasted pretty tart.

I left this to marinade overnight and the family loved it. We had some leftovers that we added cold to a salad the next day. I didn't have white pepper so I'll give that a try next time. Will definately make this again.

Very good marinade! The only complaint I have is that the soy sauce is very strong. Will probably reduce how much of it I use next time.

This is one of my favorite marinades for steaks. I make 2-3 batches at once and keep it in a large mason jar in the refrigerator. In my experience, it has kept very well for a few months. I think the longest I kept one was 6 months and it was fine, but I would say that would be the max.

Made, marinated thin sliced steak. After appox 2hrs, fried it up and put on salad. Let everyone put what they desired on it, dressing and cheese, egg, etc. Everyone raved. They loved it, including hubby who doesn't normally care for salads. New favorite

I didn't bother blending this mixture.  I just placed my sirloin steaks in a 9x13 dish and evenly poured it over the meat.  Then turned the meat in the marinade until each piece was covered.  Refrigerated it overnight.  Turned the meat again in the morning.  Then cooked on my traeger at 450° for 5 mins per side.  The meat was not that thick and it came out medium rare.

I followed this recipe step by step, I let my meat marinate for 48 hrs instead, my husband loved the tenderness & flavor so did I . My steaks tasted better than some steakhouse restaurants  I've visited.

I used this marinade with an elk steak, and definitely will use it again.  I left out the hot pepper sauce as my husband isn't a fan of spicy. He loves this marinade without the spice.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I used this on a flank steak, and it was “okay”.  The flavor was really powerful, and I felt it overwhelmed the meat more than complimented it.   Just my opinion.

It was fun to try something new, but if you already have a nice cut of steak, no need to use a marinade.

This is fantastic!  initially tried it on a less than spectacular piece of tenderlion and it transformed it into wonderful main dish that I serrved at Xmas. My brother tried it on a piece of sirloin and was raving about the results.  Great for turning a too chewy piece of meat into a tender flavorful meal.

So happy I tried this -- it turned two average steaks into a wonderful dinner. I did not use a blender and cut the recipe in half, marinating for about 4 hours.

I picked this recipe because of the number of high reviews and they definitely weren’t kidding!  This is now my favorite way to grill steaks...  I marinate them in this for several hours or overnight, and then spoon this over them while they sit on the grill.  It’s wonderful!

I never eat steak because it costs too much. My wife made a soup that called for steak so we got ourselves some thin cut NY Strip. Did the recipe just like it said minus the 2 options. * hours soak in the marinade and just grilled them with a little pink in the middle. 
I will be using this marinade from now until the end of time. Steak, Pork, and Chicken. I bet turkey would be great with this too. 
That was some of the best steak I've had. Cant wait to try is with a better cut instead of something from Walmart.

This marinade was a great change from the way I usually do my steaks. WOW! I had some striploins that unfortunately had some tough areas (can’t see what’s on the inside when buying the large ‘slab’ from Costco...) so the lemon in this marinade helped to tenderize those areas. For those who don’t know already, use a Ziploc bag as as the ‘vessel’ for the meat and marinade, then seal the Ziploc after getting as much air out as possible.I left it in the fridge for about 4hrs, then took it out and let it continue soaking up the juice for another 1.5hrs. BBQ’d them and fed them to my family along with some garlic & parmigiana roasted potatoes and a cucumber salad. HUGE HIT WITH THE MYSELF AND MY KIDS! (Single mom here lol) Definitely will make again

We were not crazy about this marinade.  Just not our taste.  Not bad but because of the title I was disappointed.  For other for whom this combination of tastes tickles your palate the right way, I have no argument.  But I'll go back to looking for the right combination for us.

I made it without the Worcestershire sauce because I forgot I didn't have any. I doubled the soy sauce and marinated it for about 20 minutes. It was a huge hit!

You definitely get a flavor when using these sauces. I used real garlic based on some others comments but feel the strong flavor came from the soy and worcestershire sauces. I do love the flavor of good ol steak but this combination works when you want a little variety.

Overall, this is a very good marinade, but I think many steak eaters don't want an outwardly herby flavor, especially if it masks the natural flavor of the steak.  That's why for me, even though I don't personally mind basil flavor, I did experience an uncomfortable basil aftertaste, which leads me to believe it is overdone in this recipe.  Also, no marinade has to be put through a blender as the flavors of the ingredients will naturally marry while in the fridge (and I think it looks more professional to end up with bits of the ingredients being visual to the eater - I mean, why use parsley if you don't want it to be noticed?).  A whisk in a bowl is quite enough.

Good, not great. After reading one review I decided to replace the lemon juice with lime juice. I let it marinate for seven hours. The steaks were tender and the flavor was not overpowering, but I felt it was just okay. My wife liked it much more than I did and said she would be happy with it again.

This was AMAZING! We pan fried ribeye steaks and it was so flavorful. We were a little concerned about the amount of basil, but it was great. I’m not a huge steak lover but this was a game changer. I savored every bite!!! Also , we did not blend it, still awesome. Not sure why it would need to be blended.

I will be using this marinade again! My fiance came home the other day from Costco with 4 Steaks. Needless to say, we had steak two days in a row. My first go-around was bad!!!!! I did the typical salt and pepper. In a separate pan, I melted some butter and added, mashed garlic cloves (2), fresh rosemary, fresh parsley, fresh basil, and fresh oregano. I allowed it to basically simmer for about 10 minutes. When it came time to turn my steaks, I poured my butter mixture over top and covered the skillet and cooked another 7 minutes on med-high. WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED!? NO FLAVOR WHATSOEVER!!!! We were very disappointed!!!!!!

Not to allow defeat, I got on my favorite recipe site and found this marinade. I used all fresh ingredients and followed suggestions of adding 1T Sugar and 1C Beef Stock. I put everything in the blender for about 30 seconds and poured it over top my steaks in a ziplock bag. I only marinaded for 4 hours! And they were very VERY good. 

I would have given 5 stars, but for some reason, part of my steak had NO taste to it. I'm not sure if it's the meat or something I'm doing. I do promise the next time I make this I will redo my review if it comes out better.

I had to improvise because I didn't have all ingredients. Substituted A-1 for the Worcestershire sauce and added red pepper, a dash of Butt Rub seasoning, and sprinkled the top with some additional seasoning. It was absolutely delicious! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I didn't use a blender  this time because the marinade turned out really thick.  Maybe, I had the blender on for too long?  I used half  the amount of oil today and I minced a few garlic cloves and my hubby insisted on chopping up some onion for extra flavor.  Four giant ribeyes are marinating as I write this.

This is an excellent marinade.  I didn't have Worcestershire sauce so used HP sauce instead.  Next time I will back off a bit on the lemon but otherwise this is definitely a keeper.

We've been using this recipe for 5 years, and it is hands down the winner over everything else we try. Thank you for sharing this!

I also have a soy allergy, so I omit the soy sauce and just increase equal parts of olive oil, lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce.  Still tastes amazing.

Really unique flavor and a great addition to my grill ideas. I made this as is but then made double the liquid for the 6 flanks I had. Blending it worked out great. I also chopped up green onion, cilantro, parsley, basil, and garlic that I add in with any marinade. The fresh basil and lemon where a great combo. Will be using again in the future or at any party I go to.

I make this recipe just as written, except I use fresh garlic instead of dried. I always blend it . I use either a flank or flat iron steak and prick the steak all over with a fork before covering it with the marinade. After cooking it on the BBQ we let it rest for a few minutes and then cut it thin at an angle. It turns out fabulous and has been a favorite of our family and friends for years. It is in our file of "go-to" recipes.

Just made Marinade for the third time!! ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! However, I've not yet made it 100% with all the ingredients. I've never put it in a blender. Just a tightly sealed Tupperware container, added steaks and shook the hell out of it!! :-) First time, I didn't have enough soy sauce. Second time, no Worcestershire sauce and this time I have no lemon juice. For some reason, I keep running out of one or the other ingredients but when it's something you crave, you learn to substitute.  For instance, tonight I had to substitute the lemon juice with white vinegar! :-) Each time it has tasted a slightly bit different but still absolutely the best! Sweet, Garlicky, spicy flavor. Just writing this review has made my mouth water! :-)  Had friends come over last weekend and made it for them. They actually copied the recipe and took it home. They ranted and raved about it being the best steak they had ever ate their entire life. I totally agreed! I'm thinking the next time I might try it over pork chops and just make it a little more spicier and a little less sweeter. or, maybe even just adding some of those ingredients to my favorite barbecue sauce and try it over chicken, with a little honey¿

followed the instructions and it turned out to be too salty to my liking. I would recommend going easy on the soy sauce or even using low sodium soy sauce and refrain from using thin slices

Absolutely delicious,  however slightly salty.   A definite keeper, and will cut back on soy sauce to reduce the salty taste.

Ok with a statement like that how could I not try it.  It’s true. Totally true. So good. I saved it so I can make it again.  You have to try this.

This recipe made the best steak I've ever had. We have an autistic child that only will eat a handful of foods, literally only a few. We got him to take a small bite and even he loved it!!!!!

I bought a cheap pack of sirloins, and threw this marinade together - substituting one citrus for another - lemon for lime - but made it exactly as the recipe called out for 0 blended and all (halved, only two steaks) - and left it in the refrigerator to marinate overnight. 

I then pan seared the sirloins, a minute on each side at high heat, then threw the an into the oven at 500 degrees for five minutes to cook to the perfect medium rare (around 130 degrees internal temp).... 

Seriously. This is the Best. . Marinade. Ever. And a wonderful base to experiment from. 

The marinade and the pan searing made these 3 dollar steaks taste like a high end restaurant quality steak. 

THANK YOU!!!!!!!!

Excellent marinade. I already have a go to steak marinade but wanted to try something different. I did not blend the ingredients, and it came out fine. The marinade was enough for 5 NY Strip Steaks. Thanks for a great marinade! Everyone loved it.

Made this without the optional ingredients and it was pretty good. Question though as I'm new to this, what is the best way to go about adding salt here ? Any advice is appreciated.

I didn't have lemons so I substituted with bottled  lime juice. Followed the recipe and added a little onion powder.  Definitely use the blender. Everything blends together and soaks in better. Marinated ribeye steaks for about an hour and cooked them on the charcoal grill @ °450 for 3 minutes each side. My kids and I devoured them. I'm sure it would have been even better if I had fresh lemons. Will definitely use this recipe (more prepared) in the future

Very tasty marinade.  Easy to mix with ingredients I had on hand.  I mixed it in a ziplock bag with excellent results.  Our steaks were very tender and moist .  The marinade did not overpower the steaks.  Will definitely make again.

I made this for a cheaper cut of steak.  I cut back a bit on the lemon juice and garlic powder as suggested by others .  I did use the blender to mix.  Marinated 2 steaks in a ziploc.  Cooked one and froze the other.  The marinade was a great success.  I used some of the leftover marinade for a port tenderloin.  Again, a big hit.  I will definitely make again.

Seriously, this was amazing! And it’s only the second time I’ve grilled steaks. I was looking for something different and I’ll use this marinade over and  over again. It was easy, fast and so good. I did use the blender and cut the recipe in half as I only had two steaks. I did not use the hot sauce or extra garlic, both optional. Outside of that, I followed the recipe. I marinated them for about 5 1/2 to 6 hours.The meat was 1” thick sirloins and I cooked them to medium plus. And the best part was I didn’t put steak sauce on them. I find that if the steak isn’t flavored to my liking, I’ll use steak sauce. These were a touch of flavor but not over powering. I marinated them for about 5 1/2 to 6 hours.

I used fresh garlic instead of powdered, and threw a bit of roasted garlic powder in there (just a pinch).  I whisked it up, and threw it in a bag with the steaks.  Everyone loved it!  I’ve used it several times now, and even marinated lamb chops with it to delicious results!  I was worried about the lemon overpowering the meat, but it didn’t.  The soy gave it a nice salty flavor, but didn’t taste like chinese food (don’t worry I use soy in vegetable marinades all the time, it's a great salt substitute if you balance it with a nice acid like balsamic vinegar or apple cider vinegar, lemon juice etc).  The flavor profile was very mild and didn’t overpower the delicious steaks ?? Happy days ??

I've used this marinade multiple times, most recently on some filet mignons. It's great - I follow the recipe as is. Tonight I'm doing some NY strips that I put in the marinade this morning. Thank you for sharing it. It absolutely takes a great steak to the next level.

Hands down best steak marinade. Perfect flavor. I didn’t blend and enjoyed the bits of parsley and basil and garlic left on the steak. Yum!!!!!

It was very bitter. I added in a drop of 'smoke' liquid, a bit brown sugar. Was much better. Wont make again.

Great recipe! The taste is amazing and the meat is tender even if you don’t marinade it for 8 hours. The only recipe I use the marinade meat unless I just use dry rub.

Simple and easy.  I only marinated the meat for 2 hours because this was a last minute thought but it was delicious. My husband typically doesn’t like sirloin but loved it with this marinade.

I've used this a few times and we love it.  I do use all fresh: garlic and herbs.  This time I used red wine instead of lemon juice (was out of it) and its a good alternative.

Like the title says "Best Marinade in Existence" No changes needed. I tenderize my steaks with one of those plungers with all the little blades on it and it cuts down  the time it has to sit in the marinade. Great flavor!

We loved this! I did not blend; I used lots of minced garlic (no garlic powder), and did not add hot pepper sauce. I marinated 3 large T-bones in it for 2 days, then grilled them. Even though I overcooked the steaks (I'm a lousy griller), the steaks were delicious and tender. My guest asked for the marinade recipe. Definitely a keeper.

Lives up to the name! I left the steak to marinade overnight. Due to cooking for a crowd, I also left out most of the pepper. It was absolutely delish.

This marinade turned out great! I marinated one sirloin steak (about 10oz) which was 1 inch thick at the thickest part. I reduced the measurements to tablespoons/teaspoons keeping the ratios roughly the same. I used bottled lemon juice and left out the white pepper and dried minced garlic. I marinated the steak for about 3 hours at room temperature. I made the steak on the grill and it was so good! None of the flavors were overwhelming. They blended well to give the steak a really nice flavor.

Great recipe!  i did it without basil, hot sauce and parsley,  and it was still very tasty.  i prepared the marinade and poured over meat in the evening, kept in the fridge 24 hours and grilled the next evening.

Took the advice of other reviewers and made the following modifications... left out lemon juice and basil, used low sodium soy sauce, marinated 6 hours. Excellent.  Cooked 14 pounds of filets for 24 people..all raved. Did not overpower the excellent cuts of meat.

I made this and thought it was wonderful.  After removing the steaks to grill, I tossed some sliced mushrooms into the marinade and cooked them on the stove in a little butter.  Very good!

This is the best marinade that I've ever tried! I made 5 New York strips and marinated them for about six hours using the exact recipe listed here. I wouldn't change a thing!. Very very good!

This marinade did not disappoint, I think next time I will use fresh garlic instead of powdered, I prefer fresh to powdered, but wanted to try recipe exactly as written.

Th marinade is awesome! One of the best steaks we've ever cooked at home. I just chose this recipe because of its ratings and reviews, but it turned out to our most favorite steak marinade recipe.

LOVE this stuff!! I have some steaks currently in my oven right now that have been marinating in it for the past 6hrs. My picky eater LOVES it! He’ll eat 3 or 4- 4oz steaks smothered in it if I let him (I do, now that I learned to buy more than 5 steaks for my 3 person family. Husband loves it, hasn’t complained that it’s literally the 5th day in a row that we’re having steak (he’s more of a chicken person). I also made this into a pepper steak with sautéed peppers and onions over jasmine rice. TO. DIE. FOR. This marinade is GOLD!

I made and loved this marinade! Did not blend it all together but it still came out great. I also had to omit the lemon juice as I didn’t have any lemons, but it still tasted amazing! Will definitely make this again.....maybe for chicken next time!

Will definitely make again, skipped the spicy stuff and the blender... still turned out beautifully. Marinated for 8 hours in the fridge then let sit at room temperature for 2 hours before grilling at high temperature. I’d recommend dabbing excess marinade off the steaks before grilling to avoid char, then let rest for 5-10 mins. Couldn’t have turned out better!

I don't believe in universal absolutes with cooking, but this is an easy choice for the best steak marinade that I've ever eaten. Every barbecue I've brought this to has had at least one person asking after the recipe. It's versatile enough to work well without the hot-sauce, or the minced garlic, or with black pepper in lieu of white. A total must-try for any avid meat eaters.

I’ve made this marinade more times than I can count. It is by far my favorite marinade. I don’t order steak when I go out to eat because no one makes a steak like this. My dad always told me if you cook it right they don’t need condiments at the table. This definitely fits the bill

I liked this marinade. I mixed this up in a bowl, using basil leaves instead of dried. Since my steaks didn't marinate for 8 hours, I spread this on 3 small T-bones periodically while they were grilling. I skipped the hot pepper sauce and minced garlic.

Have made this several times with flank steak.  I use food processor or blender if I am using fresh ingredients (ie parsley or basil).  Otherwise, not necessary.  
My son stumbled upon this recipe when I told him to take the steak out of the freezer and marinate it.  It was a huge hit!

Very good. Marinated two steaks for two days and they were fantastic. Tender and flavorful. Adjusted the measurements to cook two steaks instead of 8 servings. Pan seared steaks in a cast iron skillet on the stove on high heat and they were perfection. Would absolutely use again.

Ok I had a sirloin steak which was tough, so I made this marinade and put it in a glass dish and covered the meat for 24 hrs in the fridge. Cooked it yesterday and  it seemed to be a little more tender Rated it 3 out of 10.

I don't use this as a soaking marinade.  I use as a drizzle on whatever I am grilling.  Kids love chicken grilled with this grilled into it.  Keep the marinade in an old soy sauce bottle to liberally splash on meats.  My go-to grilling sauce...

Super easy to make plus all the ingredients are already at hand. I only had about 1 hour to marinade and it still tasted great. Can't wait to marinade for longer.

Family LOVED this marinade... I put in freezer for a day then defrosted for the next day to cook... Ooo So Perfect... I add about a Tab Spoon of liquid smoke for that smoked grill taste, used Tabasco Sauce & Freash Minced Garlic... I Heated cast iron skillets to cook... Used about Tab Spoon or so of (more if you prefer) Unsalted Butter mixed with (Tab. Spoon or so Olive Oil) also spooned over juices/oil while cooking.... Remember your just lightly frying/cooking & not deep frying so oil is Not Heavy... Cook for about 5-6 min per side....Keep oven on 500 for more cooking if steak is to rare....Luv Luv Luv it..

This was great! In my opinion it needs salt but, I did use a teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce so that might be why my version needed salt. Will definitely make again!

This has been my go to for the last 2 years. You can’t go wrong with it. I also add 1/3 cup red wine. I’ve used it to marinade steaks and also for when I did a roast in the slower cooker. Made a gravy with all juices afterwards. Nom nom nom. Everyone loves it so it’s been shared and shared.

I’m of Greek origin and my husband of Cuban. We take turns cooking, labeling our meals Greek, Cuban or other. This is the first steak marinade that meets us half way, satisfying both tastebuds. I followed the recipe exactly as written, and marinated sirloin and ribeyes for 2 days. They all came out tender and delicious!!!

This has been my go to recipe for years. I buy good quality steak tips, cut into cubes, and marinate them over night. I then cook the steak tips on a skewer on the grill. This recipe has made me famous!

Was so good! I did add some other herbs to the recipe and it came out amazing. I only let my steaks marinate for 2 hours and it still tasted amazing. Will be doing again.

"Best in existence" is a pretty bold claim. It's one of the best in my kitchen and definitely in the top 10 of my life.

Made it without the parsley (didn't have any) and nothing spicy (sensitive stomach), but everyone loved it. The basil gave just enough flavor and aroma to complement the steak.

We love this marinade!  I triple it and keep it in the frig.  We use it all the time.  It's so good on london broil.  
We use fresh garlic and regular soy sauce.  Great recipe!

I am honestly shocked with how many positive reviews this recipe has. I really felt it was blah. It needed a little salt added to it, but even then, just not a great combination of flavors. Very disappointed and definitely wouldn't make again.

If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would. The only thing I did differently was not putting it in the blender.  We were supposed to have grilled it for dinner that night, but we ended up going out for lunch and were still too full to have it for dinner.  So......it marinaded for 3 days lol. The flavour was exceptional. This is a definite keeper.  I think the length of time it marinated also made a huge difference. I've never marinated a steak before and this recipe has changed my way of thinking.

This is the BEST marinade I've tried. Made this but used Italian Seasoning and black pepper as that's what I had on hand. Put the optional hot sauce but not the minced garlic. Placed all ingredients in a gallon plastic bag and squeezed the bag several times to mix. Placed 4 boneless rib eye steaks in and mixed again. Placed in frig on Saturday morning and didn't cook them until Sunday evening. They were divine! So juicy and the flavor was amazing! Thanks for perfecting this recipe!

I quit buying sirloin steak many years ago because it always seemed so tough. This marinade made all the difference! I followed the recipe exactly using a 1 1/2 inch sirloin. It was perfect. Made it medium rare. Perfect! I can't wait to make it again.

This was the tastiest steak ever! So I didn’t have any lemon juice so I added some ginger ale and I used grated orange peel also. Left out the minced garlic and no hot sauce or white pepper. It was so delicious!

Disappointed. Usually I read the reviews and think that the people gave it a bad review because they didn't follow the recipe correctly, etc. But this was just bad.  Not a good flavor. Odd that so many liked it.

I didn't have fresh (or dried) basil, so I subbed in fresh cilantro.  I thinly sliced my  top sirloin, and cooked it in the instant pot on "Saute" in batches.  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  (And it only got 30 mins to marinate). Thank you for a great recipe.

This marinade was really good. I used sirloin that I found on sale. I didn't have lemon juice so I used orange juice. No parsley, minced garlic, or white pepper either. I used the garlic powder it calls for plus onion powder and regular black pepper. Didn't add the optional items either. My daughter who does not care for steak loved the steak this was marinated in! The meat was so tender and juicy. Will make again in the future.

I’m perplexed. How is this so highly rated?!? I just ruined a nice ribeye with this recipe. Maybe it’s something to try with a sirloin or flank that’s more tough? Honestly-it’s not that it tastes bad aside from being overly salty and too acidic. It’s that it kills all beef flavor and is incredibly boring on top of it. When I cook a steak, I want to taste steak.  I so wish I’d just sprinkled it with some S&P, spices and seared it in the cast iron as I usually do. Only ate 1/4 of my dinner because this marinade just ruined it. Thank goodness for the baked  potato or I’d be ravenous. NEVER again. Dogs will be happy even if they need to drink 5x the normal amount of water. Really bad marinade IMO.

This marinade was delicious.  I used it on filet mignon.  I added 3-4 cloves of fresh grated garlic as well.  I only let the steaks marinade for an hour or two and they were still yummy.  My boyfriend really liked it too!

Awesome! I used half and put the other half in the fridge. Even though the oil solidified, the marinade was good to use 5 days later. Just warm the marinade for 20 secs in the microwave before using.  The recipe makes enough for 6 large sirloin steaks, we used it all up!

Loved this marinade! Used it on a couple of beef tenderloins. I did not use the hot sauce or the minced garlic. However I did add about 2tbls of crushed red pepper to give a little kick. It was awesome!

While this was good, and I did enjoy it, I thought it was rather overpowering to the natural flavor of the steak.  If you are the type that smothers your steak in steak sauce anyway, I suspect you'll love it.  If you prefer more of a moderate taste that highlights the natural meat flavor, then possibly not.

This is a wonderful marinade!  I have gotten rave reviews from friends and family.  I also just measure the marinade into a zip lock bag and omit the blender step.

It was fabulous. Used it on two flank steaks. It tenderized them but they still maintained their shape and sliced thin, they were a hit!

I made this a few nights ago with a few differences, as I used what I had. I used mandarin orange juice, (lemon) sesame oil, (olive) and omitted the hot pepper sauce and white pepper and added celery salt and onion powder. The steak was so tender and flavorful, I pan seared it without any other seasoning. I think the food processor made a difference in blending, will make this again!

I used this on my steaks last summer for a family cookout and everyone looooved it.  Since then, I haven't used any other kind of marinade but this one. I was actually surprised how juicy and full of flavor they were. If you haven't tried it, I HIGHLY recommend you do!!

This marinade was so good. I did switch out the soy sauce for a garlic cilantro balsamic vinegar I like and it was perfect.
Used it on porterhouse steaks and let them sit in the marinade overnight. The staEaks were sooo tender and melted in our mouths.
This is now my favorite marinade!

I'm impressed. The steak tasted good from the grill. And all this without vinegar, except if you use the quartee of hot sauce.

I used fresh basil, not as much as called for but 3 sprigs, some fresh parsley, and added dry (both). I also put a few cloves of fresh purpley garlic, yum yum!!!

Amazing marinade.  I tried it out yesterday on a london broil. Slow cooked it on a grill for a about an hour using lump charcoal and hickory chips.  Best grilling I have ever done! Only "adjustments" I made was that I used 2 fresh garlic cloves and 3 drops of Dave's insanity sauce

Very good. Easy to make. I zested a lemon the second time around and that seemed to perk up the recipe a little.

I’ve used this marinade recipe multiple times with my picky family and they all agree every time, it’s the best marinade.   I don’t use the hot sauce with it and I seldom let it sit for 8 hours. It is plenty flavorful!!

The best steak marinade?! No way! The lemon was WAY too overpowering and gave the beef a weird taste. BLEH!!!

I added some turmeric n chili for heat. Turned out really good, but I might have over cooked the steaks a bit. Will keep trying for the perfect one

I substituted fresh minced garlic for the garlic powder and dried minced garlic. Pretty awesome! I also took the rest (I made a bigger batch) and tweaked it into a steak sauce for the finished steak.

This by far is superior to any recipe I have ever tried for a marinade.  It tastes absolutely delicious!  I do recommend adding the fresh garlic, and letting it marinate for the full 8 hours!

Cheap steak was on sale. Bottom round. Normally you need to slow cook that. Not anymore! This was the best marinade ever!

Tried this for 4th of July BBQ on Filet Mignon steaks, it came out perfect! We didn't add the hot sauce however, skipped that to keep it mild. Recommend 100%!

Great marinade! I sometimes switch it up by adding rosemary instead of basil and sometimes adding a touch of sesame oil too.

It was okay.  I tried this marinade on my July 4th steaks, but it didn't knock our socks off (like I was hoping it would have).  I made it just as directed.  Hats off to the chef for coming up with it, but prolly not making it again...the search for a great marinade continues.

We love it!! I used it for the 4th of July cookout and everyone liked it. I didn't have white pepper, so I used black pepper. I also added fresh minced garlic instead of the dry minced garlic.  I didn't use hot pepper sauce and it was still good. My time was limited, so I only left it in the fridge  for about 3 hours marinaring, but the steaks still got the good flavor.  I'm leaving the leftover steaks to marinade until tomorrow, I think is going to be even better.

I threw this on a flat iron steak and marinated it for 24 hours. Put it on the grill and it was absolutely delicious! This is by far one of the best marinades I've ever used and will absolutely continue to use it going forward!

This really was so good! 
We’ve tried a few different marinades and nothing compares. I don’t ever leave reviews but this recipe is definitely review worthy! We marinaded it for 2-3 hours and the steak was amazingly flavorful. Try it!

I am so glad that you shared this! It is amazing:)
I did put just a bit less of the parsley & basil(These always seem a little overpowering to me) and it made me famous.
I brought it on a camping trip and everyone wanted the recipe.
Thanks for sharing Kookie!

I made this once without the dried basil and it was fabulous. Then I made it with the dried basil and it overpowered the taste of the beef. No basil next time!

Yummy and easy.  And it's great to know what's IN your marinade vs. mystery store bought! I didn't add the dried minced garlic(didn't have any) or the hot pepper.  Used with a skirt steak and it was awesome!

I tried this marinade for the first time yesterday. I used fresh basil parsley and garlic and used El Yucatecco XXX hot sauce. The steak was excellent positively succulent! We have purchased and cooked these exact same steaks previously so the difference was this marinade! Give it a try!

Really nice marinade! Hubby cooked the stakes with a little Kosher salt sprinkled on either side on our charcoal smoker grill and I can honestly say it was a fantastic steak.  This will now be my go-to marinade!

I usually don't marinade my steaks, and with the ingredients I was a little skeptical. Glad I took the chance. Best marinade I have every had.

I wouldn't use this (or any marinade, really) on better cuts of steak. But it truly is a great marinade for anything from London Broil to flank steak to a piece of chuck when your budget won't allow NY Strip, ribeye, etc. I have always added a half cup or so of brown sugar. But otherwise it looks exactly like the one I've used for years.

Excellent Mainade!!!  We had friends over for a Memorial Day cookout and everyone raved over the ribeyes my husband grilled.  I made the marinade per the recipe except I use a low sodium soy sauce and left out the hot sauce.  Put the steaks in a glass dish to marinade for 3 hours and they were just so juices and tender.  We won’t be using store bought marinades ever again!  Thanks!

Let me put how good this marinade is into perspective. My sister stopped eating steak about 15 years ago. I made top serloins for the family with this marinade, and made a piece of BBQ chicken for her. BUT when I came in from the bbq she said the steaks smelled amazing, and asked to have that instead! I couldn’t believe it! She ate every bite, and went back for more. That’s about the best compliment you can get as a cook, and I owe it to this marinade! 
That being said, I do modify it just a bit.  I use one or two cloves of pressed fresh garlic instead of the dried minced garlic, two table spoons of packed brown sugar for a bit of extra sweetness, and a squeeze of Siracha (because that’s how I roll). Perfect every time! It’s the best for a less fatty cut of beef that needs a little extra flavor, like serloin or flank steak. Thanks for posting it!

I'll DEFINITELY will be using this recipe again as a guide. I of course added some extra tidbits..like a little kosher salt after cleaning the meat and fresh ground black pepper. Too, instead of ground white pepper I used black. As for the soy sauce, I used low sodium. Also, I added about a teaspoon of sugar, dry Italian seasonings 3 cloves of fresh crushed garlic and about 3 dashes of Montreal ?? seasoning...and only one average lemon which was a little less than 1/3 cup per the recipe. Lastly, I marinated the steaks about a 1.5 days. My family and I absolutely ?? this marinade and my children do not normally care for steak unless it's somewhere like Morton's Steakhouse. Which is quite pricey but WELL worth it if you could afford it. Magnific!! Thanks for sharing!!

I made it to use on venison chops. My husband was opposed saying all we need was salt and pepper. When he tried it he said it was really good. I agree. Love it and will use it on other types of meat. Thanks for the recipe.

My meat was still a little frozen the first time I made this so the olive oil, basil and parsley congealed so I placed them on the meat to cook   in. It was tasty. The whole family enjoyed it.

I made exactly as  written. Based on reviews I wiped off excess before cooking. They were very bland  and the lemon juice changed the texture of the meat.  Most likely I won't use this recipe again.

literally IS the "Best Steak Marinade in Existence"!!! Perfect amount of flavor and balance! I actually doubled the batch and have a little leftover, so I'm going to also marinate some chicken breast in it....if I don't eat it with a spoon, first!

This recipe is amazing! It makes the steaks so tender and juicy you wouldn’t imagine. Def 5 stars! I cut the soy in 1/2 & did the other 1/2 with balsamic vinegrette... amazing! You don’t need the full 8 hr marinade time either, I did it for only a few hours & it was lovely. Made this more than once! Despite the reviews I did decide to blend it & think it helps. Will never marinade a steak another way.

My husband is not a fan of New York strip steaks. However, I soaked our steaks in this marinade for about 4 hours and cooked the steaks in the broiler. They were super tender and just as tasty. I’ll make it again.

This came out well, I modified the recipe and only used 1 TB of lemon juice and 3TB of italian seasoning in place of the parsley and basil.  I didn't use the optional ingredients, but did add a few good shakes of chili powder.   I only marinaded 2.5 hours since this was my first go at the recipe, probably doing 8 hours would be better.

For those complaining of bitterness and the like, you really need to wipe the steaks off prior to broiling a marinade like this so spices and herbs don't burn.

I only made one small change, I used fresh grated garlic instead of the dried minced garlic. This really is the best marinade! Will use this recipe again and again.

Made it exactly as written (otherwise what's the point in rating a recipe).... and LOVED IT!  Plus my marinade-phobic husband LOVED IT!  Won't change a thing except probably won't dirty my blender next time.

I made this yesterday just as the recipe said.  We weren't as pleased as others have said.  I can't pinpoint the issues but we will never fix this one again.  Seemed as though the seasonings fought with each other.  The soy sauce was OK but we thought it might be a bit strong, but it wasn't at all.

Appropriately named, Best Steak Marinade in Existence! I had all but lemon juice, and the steaks were the best we've ever had. Wait until I get fresh lemons off the tree. Life cannot get any better.

I loved it. I knew it was a keeper when our teenage daughter- who would live on soup alone if we let her - raved at the flavor and asked for seconds.  Delicious!

We used this marinade for a venison and beef steak cook out. We soaked the meat for 3 hours. Then cooked directly over lump charcoal in a Weber Kettle.  Turned out great. We made it again but substituted the Basil with Mint leaves. Cooked lamb chops over lump charcoal. Absolutely to die for flavor.

This recipe was not to our taste. It was too “citrusy.” I was Leary of adding the lemon to my steak, but wanted to give the recipe a go. I made the recipe exactly as stated, but left out the two optional ingredients. My family said they liked it, but the leftovers are still in the fridge 2 nights later. This is something that does usually occur in my house, food just disappears...thank you for sharing the recipe. It is appreciated!

It was good but a tad on the bland side we added some steak dry seasoning at the end after tasting. I only marinated it for 24 hours. A 48 hour marinade would have been perfect, I believe. We don’t like it too salty but it simply needed more salt.

We though the lemon came through a little to much and the marinade was a bit too tangy.  I may try again but will eliminate the lemon all together.

Absolutely fantastic!.  Left out the mustard and halved the garlic (but will probably add it next time).  Was a bit too soy saucy, so I'll probably halve that.   I didn't bother with the blender, just mixed thoroughly, there's really no need. Didn't add parsley because I didn't have it.I marinated it in fridge for 5 hours.  Made it very tender and tasty.

Great way of giving a relatively inexpensive piece of steak great flavor.   Marinaded it for 7 hours and the meat was tender and very tasty.  My steak fussy husband loved it and that speaks volumes.

If thought this was pretty good. A little heavy on Basil but overall balance was good. I was pleased that it seared and crusted well on the grill with high heat. Thanks for Recipe!

This was GOOD. I was honestly a little hesitant to make this as I usually would never marinate steak.. However, the cuts I had on hand were a little tough, so I thought why not! It didn't smell the greatest once the ingredients were whisked together (blender isn't req for this) so i was a little iffy at first. I marinated for 24 hrs in a zip lock and WOW... it turned garbage cuts into something worth talking about. 

- i had a lot of left over marinade as i only had 3 steaks
- blender not req
- definitely use a low sodium soy sauce, or even use less then it calls for

well done!

I have made this a million times, I don't bother to use anything else, I don't change anything about the recipe (which is NOT me) and it is great.  I've used it on New Yorks, Ribeyes, Tri-Tip, Leg of Lamb and chicken thighs.  Never fails.  John Legend Score!

Didn't make changes. Worked great and really brought out the steak flavor. I love a good medium rare steak and don't want something covering the flavor.

I made this marinade for a porterhouse steak I was planning to cook on the grill. I made some minor substitutions; used lime juice instead of lemon (because that was what I had in the fridge) and I added 1/2 cup of mesquite marinade to the recipe. I marinaded the steak for 24 hours and cooked it on a charcoal grill until medium rare. I finished the last five minutes cooking with Chef Shamy's Garlic Butter. The steak was one of the best steaks I've eaten in awhile, including steaks from high end restaurants. I will definitely use this recipe next time I cook steaks.

I didn’t care for it at all. I made it twice thinking I did something wrong. It used lots of herbs which made it expensive. This is being deleted from my Favorites.

I am not a big fan of steak, but this may have changed my mind! I made exactly according to the recipe and it was amazing. Will definitely make again!!!

My husband really liked this recipe, but I thought it was just okay.  Nothing like the best marinade in existence.  So I compromise between his 5 and my three.  It was pleasant eating, and maybe one day I'll try it again.  This recipe was highlighted in Allrecipes Magazine this month and gave instructions for pan searing sirloin and finishing up in the oven.  That recipe called for 7 minutes at 400 degrees for medium well done, but I found it took about twice that long tp get to medium.  Next time we'll barbeque.

It wasn't knock my socks off good.  I made it exactly as the recipe read and used the blender too.  I don't think I will be making it again.  It wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't spectacular.  It was also a bit salty.

Everyone loved this so I'm making it again now. Compliments steak (eye of round) very well. I  reduced the oil to match the (lite) soy sauce. Trimmed the steaks., then tenderized them a little with a hammer, and using a cutting board, tapped the tip of a knife in the steak all over to make some slits to have the marinade penetrate better. I dipped the steaks in the marinade to coat, then put everything in a bag to marinade. I let it sit up to 1.5 days and it came out great. I think this would work well with pork and plan to try that.

I've used this marinade twice now following the recipe exactly, including the hot sauce and minced garlic. The steaks, even though a bit overcooked, were delicious and tender. The hot sauce gives a nice, subtle kick.  I marinade for 24 hours in a gallon zip-loc, flipping the meat several times during the day. This really is a great marinade ... I used left over for a bit of sauce.

I been doing this since 2000 except I don't mix in blender and I use reg black pepper. I know it's the best that's why I've continued to use these same ingredients for so long.

Love this recipe! I rarely have soy sauce on hand – so I substitute A1 steak sauce in its place. I’ve made it both ways and both ingredients make it taste fabulous. I don’t use regular minced garlic, instead I used the chunky garlic in a tube. Never fails to please my Guests and family!

I haven't tried this... YET, but from the ingredients & the reviews I've seen, I can tell you that I would NEVER use this on a 'high-end' steak!
Strips, Rib-Eyes, Fillets, etc. should ONLY have salt, pepper & MAYBE some granulated garlic!
Use it with CHEAPER cuts of beef, that will BENEFIT from its flavor enhancing & tenderizing properties (Flat Iron, Sirloin, London Broil, Kabobs, etc.)!
I WILL be trying this (& editing my review) SOON!!!

Absolutely amazing marinade. You'll look at that amount of basil and think "This is way too much basil". While you're putting it in, you'll think "I must have read it wrong. This is way too much basil." When you're about to cook the steaks, you'll think "They are covered in basil. It's just too much." Then you'll eat it, and realize it's not too much basil.

The only change I make is to use about 4 cloves of fresh garlic instead of dried. I've made it half a dozen times and it comes out great every time.

I've used this recipe twice on tri tip roasts. Before barbecuing them, we marinate them for a few hours in this killer stuff. I've used fresh garlic and fresh herbs, as well as powdered seasonings, but it either way, the other ingredients just bring out the best flavor in the meat! It's surely a keeper for grilling steaks or roasts.

I was a little unsure at first but because of the high reviews I decided to give it a try. very good marinade, the only thing I will change next time is a bit less lemon juice. I would suggest everyone give this a try.

Made this to take to the cottage. The steak marinaded in the cooler overnight. It was fabulous! The meat was tender and flavourful. First time I had multiple requests for seconds. A great marinade to make a lesser expensive cut satisfy a hungry crowd.

This is our go-to marinade and we've recommended it to pretty much all of our friends and family. We have a lot of wild meat (moose mainly) and the steaks can be a little tough and gamey. This marinade solves both of those problems and we end up having steak a lot more often. This recipe makes a lot so I usually marinate the meat in as much as I need to, then save the extra to make into a sauce for the meal. We have also used it to marinade meat for home made pho (soup) and I add the extra to the broth. Yum!

I'm really bad when it comes to measuring so I admit I might not have followed exactly.  However, I did use all the ingredients and the marinade was delicious!! And I love that it doesnt require hrs to develop the flavor.  I can only imagine how yummy it would be if marinated overnight!

I've used this recipe a few times and absolutely love it on steak, so I tried it on chicken and it's just as delicious!  I don't blend, just put in a ziplock bag and shake it like crazy, then added the meat to marinate.  Thank you for sharing with us!

I have to say I was skeptical about this recipe, but I have to admit I was blown away. I was amazed at how good the steaks tasted! I'm not a fan of sauces like A1 or Heinz 57 that overpower the taste of the steak. This marinade compliments the taste of steak. The wife loved it also. Will be making this again VERY soon!

Made this last night and followed the recipe exactly.  Did not use the optional hot sauce or fresh garlic.  Mixed together with a fork.  I used thick rib-eyes and marinated for about 8 hours.  My advice is to pat the steaks down with paper towels before grilling to avoid over saltiness and to get a good sear.  Turned out perfectly!

I find that if you buy a very good quality met their is no need to ruin your steak with sauces etc.  Most grocery store meat is a medium quality.  That is what your average steak house buys.  if you do not pay at least 40 dollars plus for a steak at a restraint they are using the same grade of meat as a grocery store.

I've been searching for a great marinade for flank steak for quite awhile. This is it! Didn't use the optional garlic or hot sauce. Used 1.5 lbs. flank steak and marinated for 8 hours. Grilled over medium heat 10 minutes on the first side and then 8 minutes on the second side. Wow!

I did not have lemon juice, so I subbed red wine vinegar as the acid and it still turned great! I'm sure the lemon juice is even better. I used this on a top sirloin steak I bought on sale. I put a couple tablespoons of butter in a cast iron skillet and seared each side on medium/high heat for about 5 min. on the first side and 3 min. on the second. I poured the melted butter and pan juices over the steak. It came out a perfect Medium. Even my cheaper cut of meat was tender and delicious!

Great marinade. I substituted 2 cloves of fresh garlic for the powder, cut back the dry basil to 1 tablespoon and skipped the blender.  A 1 lb. sirloin marinaded for about 8 hours grilled to medium was very tender, juicy and had a great flavor.

Excellent!  Thank you for sharing outside your circle of friends and family. I added two extra shakes of  Worcestershire sauce because my family likes a little extra tang in sauces. 
It is my new go to marinade for steaks or my east coast favorite, steak tips!

Easy to fix. Left a skirt steak in the marinade for twenty-four hours before grilling on a Traeger. Delicious, although it did little to tenderize the meat.

I've made this 4 or 5 times this summer. I thought it might get too salty with all the soy and worcestershire but it's not.  
I started using fresh herbs, basil, rosemary, and italian parsley instead of the dry herbs and it makes it even better. Don't skimp on the lemon juice and use fresh squeezed lemons, not the bottle stuff, yuk. You won't be disappointed.
I've also used pineapple juice in place of the lemon juice. It's delicious.

WAY better than I expected.  A nice change from the typical ginger & soy varieties.   I agree with another reviewer - blending is a necessity rather than an option.  I didn't want globs of dried herbs coating the steaks only to be charred when on the grill.  Next time, however, I will probably cut the recipe in half as a lot of it was wasted - we had a little over 2lbs of ribeye steaks.  I also didn't use as much oil - it just wasn't necessary.  We will definitely make this one again.

I have used this for years! I like fresh garlic better. BUT!!!! I don't use this on steak, as I like my steak just to taste like steak. I use this on pork chops. Throw together in a bag with pork chops. Is prefer to leave for a day or two! You will never have a better pork chop! Ohh and I like my pork a little on the pink side! Delish!!! Also good on chicken!

I've made this marinade several times, it is the best steak marinade out there- living up to it's name!!!!  I always use fresh basil from my garden instead of the dried- which is the only change I make.  I've tried many marinades and this one is truly the best!

Very good marinade! I had just over a half lb of meat, so I scaled this down to 5 servings. I marinated for 24 hours, and there was not much liquid left over in the zip-lock bag. Cooked on my George Foreman grill in two batches. I found that after two min, they were already getting to be done more than my preferred med-rare,  amazingly. That grill works fast! I would use this marinade again.

Amazing! I marinate my steaks for 24-72 hours, so long that the meat becomes stained from the marinade. It's SO good!

The blender is overkill, though. Just give it a stir.

SO good!  I used fresh parsley, basil and garlic.  Definitely lives up to its name.  Bonus - makes enough to use it twice.  Just as great on pork tenderloin.

Very good tasting steaks! My fluff on this recipe was I didn't ;et it marinade long enough to get its full potential. I recommend this marinade but add, let it sit for a minimum of three hours in fridge .

Made t-bone steaks on grill tonight. Only had time to marinate for 1 hour, but they were juicy, delicious, and tender. I mixed  the steaks and all the ingredients in a ziplock baggie. Everyone loved the taste. I boiled the leftover marinade, then cooked some portabella mushrooms in it. Yummy.

I made this exactly as the recipe is stated, including the optional  hot pepper sauce and minced garlic.  It is a very tasty marinade.  I only left the steaks in for 2 hours.  Next time I will leave them in the marinade for the full 8 hours.

Familly liked it but I didn't.  The lemon gave the meat a sour flavor. All of the ingredients competed with each other. Will not make again.

Not to be a hater, but it's just way too strong. Wouldn't let it on more than 20 mins before cooking or brush it over as it's cooking for a little extra flavor. I'll be sticking to salt and pepper (and a bit of lime for fajitas) when I make steak.

Not bad. The level of sour and salt are right. It certainly needs something a little fresher -- I'd advise doing what I did and using fresh herbs (I used parsley and chives) instead of dried.
.
Next time, though, it could definitely use some savory -- I'll either throw in some fish sauce or oyster sauce, or just a little tomato sauce to bind with the sodium in the soy sauce and make monosodium glutamate.

This is a great marinade.  I let it sit overnight and was amazed at how much flavor was infused into the steak but it did not over power the natural flavor.

This sounds delicious and the reviews are encouraging. I apologize I haven't made this yet, but I wanted to ask, if anyone made it wrapped in foil in the oven. My electric grill broke so I was wondering if I can, cut the steak into 2inch cubes, marinate for a few hours with some baby potatoes and just wrap it up in foil and put in the oven. Any recommendations? Thanks!

Absolutely Fabulous!  I knocked the basil down to 2 T. because it seemed like a lot, but otherwise followed recipe.  Used top sirloin and marinated 5 hours.  So tender and delicious!

There's just two of so i cut the recipe in half and marinated about 4 hours.  Turned out great on a strip steak even without tenderizing it.    Will definitely use it many more times.

I made the recipe with no changes - I had 2 steaks and some boneless skinless chicken thighs.  I marinated the meat all day, then cooked them in my Treager smoker/grill.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I think it would be great for pork, too.

Good for steak marinade for meat that is a bit tougher. Made my steak nice and tender.

I thought this was  just ok. The lemon kind of overpowered it. I made it as marinade for chicken and beef kabobs.  I would perhaps use again on beef but didn't think it paired well with chicken. Made it for 2 batches exactly as written.

Literally my favorite marinade to date, absolutely DELICIOUS. One side note: I would highly recommend following the instructions to the T and use a blender for at least 30 seconds. The consistency is much more uniform this way and I feel helps it marinade quicker and more efficiently then if mixed by hand.

We loved our steaks!  Marinaded 4 tenderloins in a ziplock bag all day - BBQ'd 2 of them that same evening.  Delicious!  Smelled so good cooking we could hardly wait to bite into them!  We weren't disappointed at all.
   We've frozen two of the marinated (raw) steaks (also in another ziplock bag) to thaw for our next camping trip, so we'll see how they are following freezing.....

Scrumptious!  Made exactly as written except tossed all the ingredients into a mason jar and gave it a good shake instead of pulling my blender out.

I have a similar marinade recipe (uses brandy instead of worstershire sauce) and was looking to change up the recipe for a party.  We were serving pork tenderloin on the grill and I marinated them overnight.  It was an absolute success.  I thought we had way too much meat for the party, but we only had a very few pieces left at the end of the evening.  Thanks!  This is my new go-to marinade.

One of the best marinades ever!!  I used 4 cloves of fresh chopped garlic instead of dried and skipped the parsley since I did not have it.  Mixed it together and used half of the marinade to marinate a flank steak and half  to marinate a bowl of sliced onions and bell peppers (2 onions sliced, 3 red bell peppers).  We ended up sautéing 1/2 of the onion mixture to serve with the steak that night.  A few days later, we cooked the rest of the onion mixture, mixed with leftover rice and steak for a stir-fry.  Such an amazing, versatile marinade!!   My family now requests I only use this marinade.

This was great! I didn't have dried minced garlic so I used fresh and did not include hot pepper sauce. I also used a whisk to blend the marinade, but only because I was too lazy to pull the blender out. I marinated a sirloin steak in this and it was fantastic. I would definitely make this marinade again.

I made this less the white pepper and additional garlic. I managed to ruin 2 filet mignons in the process. The taste was sour/bitter and overpowered the flavor of the meat. 
Use this if you don't like steak.

Very good, I put  red pepper flakes in as I didn't have the sauce and I used fresh garlic.  It could have been my beef, but I didn't think it tenderized the meat as well as some others I have tried.  Very nice flavor.

I agree with Diyeana.  Save cleaning a blender.  Put it all in a Ziploc bag and shake it up.  I also cut the recipe in half.   The steak was delish!

We followed the instructions and were very pleased with the results. Only thing we deviated on was black vs. white pepper. We also marinate portobello mushrooms in the sauce, which may have been the star of the meal. Steaks did marinate overnight and the shrooms only marinated for about an hour, but still a win! Thanks

Fantastic. Used it on 1-inch bone-in pork chops.  Only had 2 so probably could have cut the ingredients in half. Was out of garlic so omitted that  and didn't seem to miss it. Really Great.

Absolutely delicious!  I seared the steak in my cast iron skillet then I added the marinade back to the skillet (couldn't let it go to waste!)and added baby Bella mushrooms and onions (you could add baby potatoes and/or carrots too!).  I put the veggies and the reduced marinade over the steak.  Great recipe!

Ok  --You might that is a bogus title for recipe, BUT....
We make fajitas every Sunday during the summer and I had been looking for a good flank steak marinade.  Look no further folks!  I do the marinade the night before and got to tell you it is sooo tasty and flavorful.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!!!

We've used this recipe for years.  Best endorsement was my uncle from Texas saying those steaks were the best he'd ever tasted!  You can use Montreal Steak seasoning for the spices, with some extra garlic added, of course.

I've been making this marinade for  YEARS-minus the lemon juice-add a little white or red wine for tenderizing.  I also add fresh minced garlic and season the steaks with McCormick's Steak seasoning and sea salt.

I have been using this marinade for years, learned it from my mother... but I only put a couple quick squeezes of a fresh lemon in OR balsamic vinegar, small amount, never together. The meat doesn't get mushy and still browns beautifully on the grill. I don't feel you need to put in blender and I use fresh ground black pepper with fresh minced garlic. My BF doesn't like it because he likes to taste nothing by the steak but I think it enhances the taste of the meat. He is first person I have served it to in 40 years of cooking that doesn't care for it.

This is similar to other marinades I've seen and used on cheap cuts. Soy sauce overpowers. I don't use it. I would never use this or anything like this on goods cuts of beef. Low temp. grilling or broiling one step down yields tender meat that tastes like meat.

I accidentally left out the lemon juice, and hot sauce (on purpose) and this was fantastic!  I marinated it approx. three hours in a ziplock.  No fancy mixing other than a spoon; turning every hour or so.  It  took two mediocre tough steaks (we bought in bulk) and made them tender and tasty.  We  will use this recipe again.  Yum!

I will definitely make this steak marinade again.  The only change I made was that I used dried onion because I had no onion powder in the pantry.  I had planned to overnight marinate it but,  something came up and so, I grilled it after only about 4 hours in the marinade- still plenty of flavor.  My 12 year old said it was the best steak he's ever had!  Holla!

I use this marinade at least once a week for something. I use it on steak, chicken and pork and I also marinate veggies for the grill using this. I don't use the garlic powder and use fresh chopped garlic instead, but that's the only change I make.

Amazing marinade! Had a couple people over for a BBQ, and even the purists had a piece of my marinated steak after tasting it. Will make this often. Blending the sauce brought out the flavours nicely.

I have always been steak challenged. They always came out tough. Every one T-bone, Porterhouse, Sirloin every one. I started using this marinade and I cannot believe the difference. I can cook steak now. They come out fantastic. Super tender! I didn't blend everything, just put it in a ziploc bag. Highly recommend this one!

this was simply a great marinade for any cut of beef, I found it to make an even more juicy then a regular steak or what ever cut you are using.   I like to mix it in a plastic bag personally  and then put my meat in with it so it gets an even better coating on the meat and even if there is extra sauce left in the bag when you put it on the barbecue just pour it on and that well give it an ever better and stronger flavour.

Another good one!  I tweaked it to what I had to use, combining with another recipe similar.  I used red wine vinegar, just a touch of Dijon, not so much dried herbs,  basil, some parsley, oregano, thyme and rosemary, extra garlic, as one can never have enough.  A couple drops of hot sauce, black pepper, no salt, used Aminos soy, (all natural, less sodium) avocado oil as I had NO virgin olive oil.   I whizzed it all in the blender and soaked for 2 days 5 sirloin steaks.  Very tasty despite being a very lean cut of meat.  We sadly overcooked them just a tad, but still enjoyed the great flavor.  A keeper!

I hosted a large patio party so rather than grill individual steaks, I cut the steaks into big cubes and marinated for two days. Many many compliments and requests for the recipe.

This came out great, and everyone loved the flavor. I cut back on the garlic powder and the dried basil. Next time I would cut back even more on the basil--only using half of what's called for. I did not put in a blender. Thanks for a great marinade!

Excellent marinade the only thing I would add is about 2 Tablespoons of katchup, or 1 large squirt!  Everyone asked me what I did to make the marinade.  It was excellent!

Inconsequential changes. Side note: 1/3 cup lemon is two very small lemons or (probably) one good sized one. I had a limited supply of basil so I supplemented with Italian Seasoning and didn't bother with the fresh garlic.

Look ... most marinades neither substantially change the flavor profile or do not  significantly make your meat more tender. This is a simple recipe that does both.

Used on Top Sirloin, made a significant impact. Beef approached filet mignon in tenderness and that was with only 2 hours. The other piece of meat will be cooked up with more time.

Never...EVER...marinate beef with a high acid liquid like Lemon.  All you're doing is cooking it in acid.

I thought I'd try breaking this cardinal rule based on the number of positive reviews.  I now realize that there are just 2000 cooks out there who don't know anything about cooking steaks, and are basing their approval on some primordial flesh eating part of their brain and not because of a basic understanding about fine cuisine.

I used this marinade for beef kabobs, and they turned out great. I marinated the meat for 24 hours and basted the kabobs with the remaining marinade. They came out tender and full of flavor! The only change I made was substituting black pepper for white pepper.

I used this marinade recipe for the first time. I let my steaks marinade for 24 hours. It turned out absolutely amazing. The steak was just falling apart. No steak sauce was needed. My boyfriend said it was the best steak he had ever eaten!!

I used this to marinate steak that I was using for steak salads, and we thought this was good! It had a nice flavor and complimented the other salad ingredients nicely. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made tri tip steaks using this marinade and we only marinated for 6 hrs. I'll try again using this marinade for steaks overnight. The taste of the steaks wasn't up to par with all the ingredients that went into it. I much prefer the tri tip marinade from this website to this one. I'll give it another shot and review a second time.

I LOVE this steak marinade!!  I always have the ingredients on hand, as they're mostly pantry staples. This has quickly become my go to marinade.  I really love the flavor combination of garlic, soy sauce, Worcestershire and fresh lemon (to tenderize the meat).  I've used dried herbs per the recipe, which are good but expect it will be even better with fresh herbs from the garden. I cut the recipe in half, mix in a small bowl (no blender needed), pour into a ziplock bag to coat the steak, and toss it all in the fridge. I usually only marinate 1-2 hours- I'm not great at planning ahead- but with this recipe that's all that's needed for tons of flavor!!  Highly recommend this recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!!

This marinade is silly good. I followed as directed & blended with a vita-mix. Also tried it without blending. Blending is better. White pepper is key & adding a bit of chili powder tonight for tomorrow night's steaks, thanks very much for sharing.

This marinade has serious potential, but all the citrus ruins it and overpowers anything you put it on (from steaks to oyster mushrooms). I would highly recommend cutting WAY back on the citrus to be adjusted to your taste (start with a few teaspoons and go from there). This recipe could be close to perfect with a few adjustments.

Made exactly as written, and marinated for 24 hours.  It was good, but not great.  Maybe I'm too much of a steak purist, but this was too lemony.  I'll say, however, that the kids liked it.

A very solid basic beef marinade, which you can easily and modify to taste by changing the type of herbs you use. I kicked the acid level up a bit with a couple tablespoons of red wine vinegar, and added a bay leaf.

This is a wonderful recipe. I had pesto in the freezer. I added one Cube that I had previously put in an ice cube tray and frozen. This replaced fresh minced garlic and dried basil with excellent results.

This sounds pretty similar to something I make but I thought for a change I'd try this one. It's not bad but I like mine better.
I do use soy sauce and sometimes instead of olive oil I use sesame oil and grated ginger if I want more of an Asian taste. I use fresh garlic and some thyme and brown sugar. And what's with taking out a blender to mix this up? Just mix in a bowl or just pour into a zip loc bag. So much easier.

Used this on venison backstrap. Cut it into 1.5" thick medallions and marinated overnight. Fried the steaks on med-high heat for 2 minutes each side, then finished in the oven at 400 degrees, about 7 minutes. Let them rest in foil about 10 minutes and they were DELICIOUS!!

Absolutely flawless marinade. I stuck pretty much exactly to recipe and used it on sirloin.  Perfect cut for this marinade.  It was the best steak I've ever cooked.

I don't think blender is necessary.  I just put all ingredients in a gallon ziploc and shake it up then add steak.  For a single 1 lb. steak I cut the portions in half and it was still more than enough.  

Pan-seared the steak on medium high heat.  Came out medium/medium rare.  Perfection.  I was in awe with every bite.

So great! Weve been cooking steaks with just plain salt and pepper for a long time so this was a fun mix it up. My husband love it, only complaint was it was too "worcestershire-y"but I loved it. I think I'd get sick of the taste if you made it consecutively three times in a row but this will be saved as a family favorite forever. It touched something deep in my soul that I cant put my finger on...

This was my first time trying this recipe and boy IM GLAD I DID! I went to Costo with my wife and bought me some sirloin steaks to make the next the day. We went home and I started to do the marinade. I did the whole recipe but left out the hot pepper sauce and garlic salt because i replaced that with montreal steak seasoning(not on the actual recipe to blend) . Once I blended the recipe  I got 2 ziplog bags and before I put the steaks in there I sprinkled them with the montreal steak seasoning and it actually sticks to the steak right away. Put them on the bags carefully then i poured in the marinada and closed them up and put them on the fridge for about 17 hours give n take. Thats why put them the day before to marinate well. I put them on the grill once they were ready  we tried them and IT IS THE BEST STEAK I HAVE EVER TRIED!!!! I had bought A1 sauce as well cuz I always put them on my steaks and not this time! The flavor was so good I forgot about it! Definitely recomend this recipe! Will do it again soooooooon!

I just made this today! This recipe marinadeded 1 three quarter pound ribeye steak. My hubby loved the steak! He said its a very good flavor and he likes it on top of rice! so all the juices gets absorbed by the rice! 

However, I say this recipe is more for CHEAP steak that are lean and chewy on their own. It tenderizes the meat quite a bit...no point of using it on a slice of USDA CHOICE RIB EYE?.

The only change I made was using fresh garlic and I did not blend the marinade.  I placed the steak in a dish to marinade for 8 hours, turning it a few times.I was looking for a marinade that would be flavorful and this one did not work for me.  The steak did turn out to be tender.  I will not be using this one again.

Definitely going to use this recipe every time I want a juicy flavorful steak oh my goodness this tasted sooo good.  The only thing I changed was adding 2 cloves of minced garlic instead of the dried garlic flakes and I didn't use any hot sauce.  It was amazing!

I like the flavor/flavor combination, however it is a little too overwhelming. It overpowers the beef flavor. Thinking I will try watering it down to obtain the same flavor, but not so strong.

I marinated filets in this sauce.  Absolutely the best steak I have ever tasted.  I made it exactly as shown in the recipe.  I was hesitant at first that the steak would pick up the flavors, but instead it enhanced the steak flavor and made it juicy, tender and flavorful.

I was cooking tuna steaks and found a lonely freezer burned ribeye in the bottom of my freezer so I decided to marinade it  and it was even a bigger hit than the tuna steaks everyone wished there was more! It definitely brought new life to the steak, the only changes I made was I used fresh minced garlic instead of  garlic powder and fresh parsley and basil. I also did not use the blender I mixed everything in a bowl and used a  ziploc. This one is definitely  a keeper!

It was horrible. Very sour lemony flavor to the steak. I followed the recipe to the "T" with not a bit of alteration. 
I use only fresh ingredients and so I know that was not an issue. I would eliminate or severely cut back the lemon juice in this recipe.

Seemed like a waste of a lot of ingredients, especially my California olive oil which I generally don't like to blacken. Just rub your steak with fresh diced garlic, salt and pepper and throw it on a red hot frying pan for a few minutes on each side. Much better!

Good marinade overall.  Found it to be a bit salty but marinated overnight and maybe too long.  I agree with other posts that you will need to blend.

Absolutely amazing! I actually used this twice already on filets (gasp, I know), and the taste and tenderness can't be beat. I did use fresh minced garlic, and let the meat sit in the fridge for 4 to 8 hours, but other than that, I am a firm believer in leaving people's recipies alone at least for the first time making it. Thank you so much for this!!

This is my go-to Steak marinade. The longer you marinate the better! Usually I marinate top sirloin steaks in this  and everyone loves it! Including my 8yr old son.

Really enjoyed it, though I didn't taste/see the value in adding the basil and parsley.  Will likely try without next time.

No changes.  Marinated my steaks for around 24 hours, cooked them in a pan on the stove in about 25 minutes, was pretty awesome.   I added some feta on top and it paired really well.  I used the leftover steak in a burrito the next day...  and that was also amazing.

The only thing I added to this recipe was 1/4 cup of zesty Italian salad dressing. I also used black pepper instead of white. I mixed everything in a ziplock bag, added the sirloin steak and marinated in the fridge overnight. This was sooooo good!!! Even my hard to please 16 yr old son couldn't stop commenting on the great taste.

I was not impressed with this.. It had way too much Italian seasonings, and I really couldn't taste anything else. I wish it was either saltier or sweeter, it was just bland otherwise. I was hesitant to add so much parsley, but did anyway because of all the positive reviews.

This is pretty good!  The only ingredient I didn't have was the white pepper so black pepper had to do.  I will definitely keep this in my recipe box and do it again very soon.

It's. by far the best marinade I've made. The hot sauce isn't hot and gives the meat a complex layer of tanginess that's out of control.

I used this to marinate skin-on chicken thighs, and I baked the chicken almost immediately.  The flavor was great!  I didn't blend anything.  Just put all the ingredients with the chicken in a mixing bowl and moved it around with a big spoon.  I didn't have parsley so I skipped it.  Instead of hot sauce I used chili flakes.  Kids and husband gave me thumbs up.

LOVE this marinade! We use it mostly with flank steaks. Sometimes I'll use the leftover marinade and cook it with mushrooms and onions and serve with the steak. I always get compliments when I use this and many ask for the recipe.

Fantastic marinade! Mix, place in a ziploc bag and let the steak marinate until you are ready to cook it. I try to keep some of this on hand just in case I have an emergency steak night.

Used exact recipe. Marinated for 12hrs on NY strip steaks. The lemon  was more pronounced then what I liked.  I feel the need to look further.

Easy to make and very tasty however it's not as good as the name might suggest! I should have guessed by the ingredients that it would have a teriyaki taste to it but I was looking for something quick. I gave it a 3 because it was easy to make and everyone ate it without complaint.

I tried this recipe about 3 years ago, and wont eat steak without it! I used to love going out for dinner to get a good steak, but now when I crave steak, I forego the restaurant and just wait until I get some at the grocery store, just so I can have this marinade.

The only steak that's now better than mine (with this recipe) is the one i get once a year when i go to Vegas and eat at Gordon Ramsays restaurant!!! lol

I made this and it was delicious!  My picky brother-in-law said it tasted like he was at a steakhouse.  I marinated sirloin steaks overnight so for 17 hours.  These were the best homemade steaks I've had.

Made this per the directions and sorry to say we didn't care for it.  It overpowered the yummy flavor of the grilled steak.  However, it did smell amazing when I was making it so I plan on trying it on other types of meat such as chicken or pork.

This is a great marinade! definitely different from what I usually do, it was a nice change.  I used lemon juice rather than freshly squeezed lemons since that was all I had. the hot sauce isn't enough to make it spicy but adds great flavour. Will definitely make again

I followed the recipe except I omitted the garlic powder and added onion powder and Italian seasonings. I also did not have parsley. I did not blend anything in a blender it was not necessary. Marinated all day on ribeyes and it was great. I will use this on all the steaks I cook from now on.

This marinade worked well with my round steak.  The flavor was good but something was not right.  Like others said, it overpowered the beef flavor of the meat.  To tell the truth, I don't know why one would want to marinade a good t-Bone or Sirloin.  It did make my cheap, lean cut of beef nice and tender

This is the Best.The only difference in this recipe is that I left out the optional ingredients.   Got great reviews from wife and kids.   The second time I was asked to make this steak again and I had 3 1 1/4 inch thick sirloin steaks marinating.  
Life happened and I couldn't grill the steaks that night.  By the time I was able to grill the steaks it had marinated for 3 days in the fridge.  It still turned out perfectly.  Didn't look very good coming out of the Ziplock bag I had it in as the olive oil had clumped from the cold temps.  This time the family asked me to never try another recipe and always make steaks this way.  MAKE EXTRA STEAK so you have steak and eggs for breakfast the next day.

I have made this recipe several times, mostly for my own enjoyment. No need to blend, it is certainly optional. I usually always add the minced garlic. Marinade for about 1 hour yields the best results in my experience.

I did not have all the ingredients but used 90% of them and it was amazing. I highly recommend this marinate. I used coconut oil instead of olive since I prefer it when cooking and it worked wonderful.

I would give this marinade more than a 5 Star rating. Like the other reviews, I was a little skeptical of the ingredients but they worked together just well. My husband said, "now that's how I like my steaks!"

Absolutely love this recipe!!! Tried it on a whim and now it's a regular in our house. We just tried it with a pork loin and I must say it was even better than the steak! With this marinade you won't need any sauce because the meat has so much flavor.  I didn't add the hot sauce or basil and used bottled lemon juice and it still came out amazing!!!

Meh....i definitely wouldn't say it's the best steak marinade of all time. marinaded a big new york strip for 2 days and stuck it on the grill. i tried this as an experiment obviously as the title caught my attention and quite a few people made it but i think i'll stick to just salt and pepper for my steaks. i feel there was way too much basil in this and the worchester sauce overpowered everything

I followed the recipe exactly  except for the fresh lemon juice. I was out. I used seasoned rice vinegar for the acid. It tasted excellent. Now I haven't  cooked the steaks yet, they're marinating overnight, but I'm sure they will be delicious. This is a keeper and my go to steak marinade now. ??

Marinated regular ole sirloin overnight and it was amazing. So tender and juicy. We have our own cattle butchered so the meat is generally more tender than what you get at town, but this worked wonders. Tasted fantastic.

I did not make any changes and I would make it again.  I usually use just worcestershire sauce and soy sauce only to marinate the flank steak  But this was a nice change and our guess loved it.

Wasn't  impressive to my family.  Used it marinate NY Strips and I think the flavor of the meat was better BEFORE adding the marinade!

Love it. But seriously just go by taste! Make it your own. I added balsamic vinegar and excluded the lemon! So yummy.

I always try to follow the recipe as written the first time, then modify it from there. This was 5 stars from day one, and I don't think I could improve it. Don't stop with beef, I use it almost weekly with chicken and love it on shrimp and fish. Go ahead and make the whole batch then refrigerate what you don't need, you WILL want to use it again.

This was just 'ok'.   It was missing a 'saltiness' factor.  It was very bland to me.   I would not recommend an overnight marinate.

I substituted white pepper for black and added 1/2 teaspoon of ground peppers indigenous to Iwo Jima. I let the steaks marinade for almost 7 hours and cooked them to medium rare. They were very tasty and had a nice kick from "Sulfur Island!" I will most definitely be using this marinade again, thanks!!

pretty good marinade. we probably didn't let the steaks marinate enough to truly get the flavor integrated with the steak (only 1 hour).
however, what saved the day was that after we threw the steaks on the grill we added the leftover marinade to spinach i had already started sautéing. then i reduced the liquid over high heat. the spinach was a perfect complement to the steak.

Left out the minced garlic, put in less hot sauce, just mixed it (didn't blend it) and just marinaded for 1-1/2 hours at room temperature.  Delicious!  Will never make a steak without it again.  Thanks for a great marinade!

This is a great marinade with steak and with a little tweeking will be great with chicken too (have to try it with pork still). The only thing I did differently was I used 2 tablespoons basil per batch instead of 3 (I didn't have enough basil) and I didn't blend in in a processor or blender.

It was pretty delicious but way too salty for my taste. Would use real garlic and less soya sauce next time. Meat did come out pretty tender though and The flavor was a nice blend. Will try again with less sodium in the marinade.

This is my go-to.  Amazing succulent steak.  Works perfectly every time and you will impress your guests.  The only thing i would say is be prepared for flavour....this is not a mild, wimpy marinate - now that I have this one, I never use any other.

This marinade lives up to its name!  I have made a few times marinating an hour or two and it's good.   I marinated some steaks for a day and half and they tasted way better!  I used 5 cloves of minced garlic instead of the dried, did not use a blender, just a ziploc.  Simmer the left over marinade for a few minutes and use to baste the steaks as they are cooking.  BBQ is the best!

This is excellent. Only change I made was throwing about 1 1/2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard in the mix,  using fresh herbs from my garden, and not blending it. .

My husband has always declared that he doesn't like marinated meat.  I do.  I decided to make two strip steaks and I marinated them in this recipe for 4 hours, then grilled them to medium.  I served the steaks and waited for a comment.  The comment was "what did you do to this steak?  It's fantastic!"  When I told hubs that I marinated the steaks, he said to keep doing it, as it was a "keeper".  The only changes I made to the recipe were- 1) I just mixed the marinade up in the zip lock bag and 2) I added 1 tablespoon of a smoky flavored barbeque sauce. (I halved the recipe)  So glad that I found this recipe!

Pretty tasty. I skipped the spices since my kids never enjoy it, but otherwise made as described. This was a success on grilled steak and pork chops, and we'll definitely make it a staple in the future.

We love this recipe for grilled flank steak. It's very flavorful and still works well if I don't have every exact ingredient and need to modify at times.

Good marinade. I used all ingredients as suggested. Only had time to marinade for 5 hours so not sure how much difference it would have for a longer time marinating. I made kabobs with cut up rib eye pieces. Red onions, red and yellow peppers and mushrooms. The vegetables got marinated in the last 2 hours before being cooked while on kabobs and that was extra yummy. Will use again but try marinating longer to see if it makes a big difference because while it was good it wasn't amazing.

I really didn't like the flavor.  Maybe it would be OK to use with a cheaper cut of meat.

Delish! husband loves his steak just flipped,  S&P Only.  So was extremely surprised by his awesome reaction to this recipe;  Blended using vitamix, using fresh garlic.  Pierced thick-cut steaks w/ a chef's serving fork before marinating in a zip lock bag. Only had 1 hour to do so & am so glad I made it!
Steak was flavorful & tender.  Yum! Afterwards,  wished I could've marinaded it all longer.  Thanks for sharing your recipe....it's a keeper.

This really is very good. I never blend it just mix it up and stir with a spoon or whisk. I have marinated steak for as little as 90 minutes and it still came out really good.

Very flavorful, maybe a bit to sour from the lemon. So maybe reduce it a little. I cooked this with venison and left it overnight and it was very good. Don't even need to add salt or pepper when cooking

Best in existence? Well, I have not tried every marinade in existence, so... It was really good, though. 

A few modifications: I did not have lemon juice, skipped the basil, and cut the oil by half.

This marinade has so much flavor, I have to say I'm impressed. I've tried so many different marinades looking for something that I can taste, let alone that everyone else likes. I tried this recipe tonight on steaks for 6 and every last bit was gone (the dog didn't even get any!) - and my mother, who doesn't like steak, complimented me on how good it was. I'll be making this again. Thanks for the new favorite!

Didn't have white pepper so I put in black pepper. Marinated 4 hrs. some thin ny strips and some sirloin pan steak for tailgating at a brewer / cub game at Miller park. The meat was the best in our row in the parking lot. Used whitefords cayenne pepper sauce. And instead of olive oil I used ditkas hot gardinara juice.  Plus an extra dash of tastefully simples garlic garlic. It's what I had on hand. Delicious!

The cut of meat you choose for this marinade is of high importance!  I had a variety of steaks: Porterhouse, Ribeye, and Filet.  I marinaded them all about 2 hours.  The Filet and Porterhouse were PERFECT.   This is a marinade I will go to regularly for those cuts in the future.  The Ribeye, however, were EXTREMELY salty!!  Clearly, the higher fat content/marbling allowed more salt to be absorbed.  These were almost inedible.   I will either use this marinade for a much shorter length of time, or change recipes altogether.

I'm super picky about my steaks but I love a well seasoned steak. This was awesome. I didn't blend it and I added a little Canadian steak seasoning & a little carne asada seasoning. It was perfect! I used the remaining seasoning to create an au jus sauce (just in case). All I had to do was add the seasoning, water & a beef bouillon cube and boil on high. It was fantastic!

I hesitated to try this as the husband is somewhat of a purist, likes his steak plain grilled and hates teriyaki marinade. I had some not so good NY strip steaks that needed to be used ....  Mixed up the marinade (added more garlic); cut my steak into kabobs and about 6 hours later grilled- delish! We both love this marinade

The ingredients suggest this might be a great marinade, and our guests dod go back for seconds.  It did  not have the "wow" factor I was expecting.  Good but not distinctive.  I only left out the hot sauce and I added a bit of brown sugar.

I will try it again for the family before I try it at a backyard BBQ gathering.

I use fresh minced garlic instead of powder and a teaspoon of mustard powder.  I use an emulsifier to mix everything.  It wouldn't come out right if you don't blend or mix it vigorously.   I do really like the marinade and it actually sticks to the steak

The name sums it up perfectly!  Not only will this be our only marinade from now on, it'll be the one I recommend to our friends too.

Mixed it in bowl, added to fresh sirloin steaks in a ziplock bag prior to freezing. Allowed to thaw and come to room temp priot to BBQ, which I did on a really hot searing element before turning down to cook over med-high heat for about 10 minutes total coming off med-rare to rare depending on size. Everyone loved them.

I had a 1.2 lb shoulder steak that I pounded with the nubby side of the mallet.  I halved the recipe, skipped the garlic powder and hot sauce, added 2 cloves minced garlic and dried minced onion.  Then it marinated for 6 hours and DH grilled it.
Update: same amt of steak,  didn't halve recipe. Not sure it matters. Same changes as above. DH, T, and I loved it, A&E not so much. DH asked to add hot sauce next time.

Didn't add red pepper and used minced fresh garlic. Skipped the blender and everything was nice and easy. Good flavor and will use again. This recipe makes quite a bit and will cover plenty of meat.

I didn't care for this recipe. I even used fresh ingredients in place of the dried stuff. Fresh basil and garlic. I think used as a base it has promise, but I'd never fix it by the recipe again.

I had a ton of fresh garlic and basil to use up, but otherwise followed the recipe as is.  This marinade was delicious on the top sirloin steaks we grilled for dinner tonight.  We marinated them for about 3 hours, turning once.  It has so much delicious flavor, but doesn't overpower the natural flavor of the meat the way vinegar-based marinades usually do.  This marinade would be even better on chicken, pork, or seafood, in my opinion.  I made a double batch, and poured it into a quart size Mason jar to keep in the fridge.  I plan to try it on some zucchini I want to grill, too.  Thank you for sharing!

I have made this 3 times now and its always a hit.  The only thing I changed was omitting the dried basil as I was out.  Otherwise,  everything remained the same.  This is a "bookmarked"  recipe.

Really bad. Made it exactly as it said and put it on some tomahawk steaks. My family and I were very disappointed and I regretted putting it on such nice steaks.

I had a couple of cheap steaks that I wanted to salvage and thought a good marinade might do the trick. This recipe saved the day! The steaks turned out tender and yummy. I marinated for only  1 hour. If you only have 2 steaks I recommend cutting the recipe in half. I made it as shown except for the garlic powder. I couldn't bring myself to put that much garlic powder in. I used 1 tsp instead of the 1.5 tbls. Delicious!

Perfect  flavor! It will be my go to marinade  for  steak. So easy to prepare and quickly soaks into the meat if you're in a hurry.
I didn't blend it....just stirred it up and poured it into a zip bag with the steak. Thanks for a great and simple recipe!

My brother didn't want me to marinate the rib eye steaks so I left one plain...but he had one that was marinated and loved it! I'm marinating a London broil for a family grill tomorrow and he specifically requested this marinade. I used 1/3 cup Worcestershire , only 2 T dried basil and I cut fresh Italian flat sparsely into it.  I don't think you can go wrong with this one!

OH WOW this is such a great marinade - it has quickly became our favorite and the only one we now use.  I  e mailed it to my son and they had it 3 days in a row on steak - delicious!!
I saute mushrooms, onions and peppers in the reserved marinade for approximately 15 minutes till done while the steak is cooking.
Thanks again for such a tasty marinade.

Lives up to it's name.  I didn't blend it;  just dumped it all in a large ziplock bag and it was still great.  It does make a lot;  I had a little over two pounds of sirloin tips and there was more than enough.  I only marinated for two hours and it was still very flavorful.  Even got a compliment from my fussy husband and daughter.  I will make it again.

I love this marinade..!! I add a bit of prepared mustard to the blend & warm it a tad in the microwave to really blend all the flavors before adding it to the beef...but I just adore the results!! Thank you for this recipe!!

This marinade is fantastic!   For the hot sauce, I used the new "chipotle" Tabasco sauce and it added even more mesquite flavor to the steaks!   Making it again tonight with filets.   :)

OMG - Amazing.  I was a little dubious about this recipe - I mean, herbs in a marinade for beef?  But of all the recipes I looked at this one was the only one that I had all the ingredients on hand for.  And frankly, it looks like sludge when it comes out of the blender.  But I used it on a thick piece of  supermarket-grade sirloin for about an hour and a half at room temp., then put it on the grill, first for about 15 minutes to sear, and then on indirect medium, and it came out juicy and extremely delicious.  This recipe is a keeper.

This is a delicious marinade easily made with ingredients you probably have on hand. I've made it several times most recently with a large loin roast that fed 23 family members. Everyone raved, there wasn't a scrap of meat left. My husband - who won't eat any condiments, sauces, etc. - now has me making this marinade twice a week. That 1/2 steer which was taking up freezer space is rapidly disappearing. Thanks very much for this recipe it is truly a winner!

This really is an outstanding marinade, I will tentatively say that it is the best. Made a philly cheese steak with ny strip and it really made a savory sandwich.

This was good. I can't say I think it made it amazing for me but it didn't make it bad either. I followed it exactly but didn't use the blender or optional hot sauce. I halved it for 3 large steaks and it was the perfect amount.

This was excellent.  I cut the olive oil in half but otherwise made as is. I did not blend this -- just tossed it in ziploc -- worked fine.  The addition of the lemon juice really sets this off.

Wow, boys and girls this is terrific!!  Have you ever mixed something and taken a long look only to say to yourself: "am I going to put $25.00 worth of steaks into something that looks like the cat had been eating grass!"  You taste the marinade and almost pitch it but then you throw caution to the wind and decide to try it.  Even when cooking I thought I would get surprise...then I couldn't wait any longer and cut a small piece while still on the grill.  My goodness!!  My tonsils started to slap my taste buds silly!!!!

I didn't change a thing other than I didn't ad the hot sauce (I have surgery in the morning and am supposed to be NPO after midnight.  

Steak lovers, you have to try this marinade, it is to die for!!  Thanks for sharing this with us common folk...we are not worthy??!!

Made this for Father's Day with bone-in ribeyes.  Was told by all it was the best steak they have every had.  I made a couple of changes...but only because I'm an idiot.  I put ingredients in the blender and after pouring the marinade on the steaks, looked over and saw the lemon juice still sitting there...so that didn't go in.  I also wanted to add a little molasses because a friend of ours makes awesome steaks and uses it in his marinade.  I didn't realize I had run out, so I used honey instead.  All of my scatterbrainedness turned out well enough that I will replicate this mess in the future.  :)

I only marinated our steak for 3 hours and this still added some powerful flavor. I can only imagine how it would enhance the meat if I marinated it overnight. This is a keeper. Very good.

Can out really well, marinating a steak for about an hour before hitting the charcoal. So well, in fact, that I refrig'd the leftover marinade, and marinated some chicken thighs a day later, which came out really nicely as well. Made pretty much as described, except I was out of white pepper so just omitted, as well as omitting the "optional" ingredients. Had plenty of flavor, and nice complexity with basil, parsley, Worcestershire, etc.

This was absolutely delicious!!! First time making a whole 6 lb filet mignon on the BBQ for Father's Day. The only thing I left out was the garlic powder, I instead I increased the fresh Garlic to about 2 TBLSP.  All I can say is WOW!! Everyone, just like other reviews mentioned, went back 2 and 3 times.  Even my picky 13 year old and our company who's 2 year old swore he didn't want to eat it said after one taste, "I'm going to eat ALL of it!" LOL Will be using this often. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Excellent on top sirloin I used for Shish Kebobs. I cut the basil back to 2 tablespoons, omitted the hot sauce and used minced jar garlic instead of the dried, probably 2 tsps of that.  I kept about 1/3 of a cup aside, before adding the meat, so I could baste with it. I didn't blend it, just tossed it all in a zipper bag and mixed.  AMAZING!

I was a very tasty Marinade  but didn't overpower the steaks. They turned out moist and perfectly tender. I let the steaks sit in the marinade for about 6 hours before cooking them.

This was disgusting. Beautiful steak ruined. Kids, hubby, & myself couldn't eat it. These flavors just do not go together. It has a weird, unpleasant aftertaste. We're all steak eaters, but in the future I think I'll stick to searing it off with a good steak seasoning and leave it at that. Two thumbs down. Don't know how it got so many great reviews...

Superb. The longer it marinates, the better it tastes. I have marinated it for 3 days and my hubby wanted  to marry me all over again!

This was OK, but believe the basil was over powering.  I would have preferred more of the garlic and/or perhaps a bit more soya or some red wine, would be preferable to the basil.

I thought it was amazing just as good as my hub's cousin who uses similar with black bean sauce.  My husband is allergic to many things so I substituted worchester sauce with molasses watered down a little with water. I would recommend it.

This is a great steak marinade, my favorite by far!  I halved the recipie as it was just me and one t-bone, I had something come up so I couldn't grill the steak that nite so it marinated for over 24 hours and still a great steak, so my modification to the recipie is this, forget about the 8 hours, it doesn't matter, it's going to be the best steak you've had in a long time.

I normally shy away from cooking steaks because They have always turned out awful. Not this time, the meat was so tender, juicy and full of flavor. My 1yr old was eating handfuls of it.

I had this made for me and with lime juice instead of lemon and low sodium soy sauce. It was perfect. It was tenderized flank that was it was used on and about two 1 pound cuts and it was marinated for 8 hours. To boot, we saved off the marinade, brought it to a boil in a pot and thickened it with about a cup of water with some flour in it... A very nice gravy ;) We put it over roasted red potato and sweet potato.

For the work involved in making it, I prefer a teriyaki/brown sugar based marinade--much simpler to make and equally if not better tasting...but then it is a subjective test, isn't it?

Made this marinade as written in the recipe, minus the optional ingredients. It was delicious!! I left out the hot sauce since my wife doesn't like spicy food. Next time I will add the optional minced garlic since we love garlic and it could have had a bit more punch to the marinade.
One word of caution, the lemon juice might be a little intense for those that don't like that acidic punch, so you may want to reduce the amount by a little bit.
Otherwise, I'd easily call this 5 stars as written.

I bought top sirloin steaks just to try this recipe on, and it didn't disappoint.  The only thing I should've done differently was marinate the steaks a lot longer than 3 hours.  I'd pounded them a bit first before marinating, and hubs grilled them on our Texas smoker.  They were  tender and flavorful but didn't seem to quite reach their full flavor potential that would've come with an overnight soak.  Will do this again planning ahead the day before.

This is delicious.  I followed the ingredient list with the exception of the dry garlic.  I let the steak marinate for 48 hours due to conflicting schedules.  The steak (I used flank steak) was very tender and had a wonderful flavor.  Prior to grilling the steak, I used paper towels to remove the spices and put the steak on paper towels to absorb excess marinade.  I will definitely make this marinade in the future.

Good marinade recipe, especially with the addition of soy sauce.  Only changes made were to use light soy sauce and fresh herbs, garlic & pureed onion vs. the dried that this recipe calls for.   Always looking for a marinade recipe that tops our family favorite and while this came close, we still prefer the Best Steak Marinade recipe found in the International Bellhop Magazine published on June 19, 2013.  This recipe calls for lighter herbs and the addition of V-8 juice, which we have fallen in love with.  However, I'd make this marinade again just for change in taste over the grilling season.

Exactly what I was looking for.  My changes were that I used 1 tablespoon of minced garlic and omitted the garlic powder.  I cut the basil to 2 tablespoons.   We enjoyed a tender and flavorful steak.  Thanks for sharing

i use all the ingredients as written on rib eye steaks and it turned out great. The flavor was just right and made the steak very tender. i marinated overnight and let the steak come to room temp before throwing it in a lightly oiled cast iron skillet in a preheated oven at 500. i cooked it for 5 mins on one side and 2 on the other side.  i will definitely make it again

I would not change one thing. Very good. I did not blend the ingredients. Added chipotle puree for the heat.

Love this marinade. Super delicious. I

I usually combine this marinade in use with the Steaks with Roquefort recipe: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/84718/steaks-with-roquefort-sauce/

Sometimes when I have extra I use it as a base for a salad dressing, and just add some chunky cheese pieces in.

Yes I made a change in a cpl spices and added some ketchup. Next time a tad of mustard also should give it some beef. And I used 3 rib eye triple a beef steaks and only sat in the fridge for 4.5 hrs  most of the marinade was soaked up but yes I'm sure would've been gd without my additions but glad I did.

Me and my husband have been making this marinade for about 5 years now. It's the only steak marinade we use! Amazing!! We sometimes use low sodium soy instead of regular though! Must try!! YUM!

Absolutely THE best steak marinade I have tried.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  I did not add the optional ingredients this time.  The blender really is beneficial in releasing all the herbal flavors.  My whole family loved it.

Used it on Skirt Steak.  I took a chance and deviated from my normal marinade because I wanted to try something different.  I only substituted lime juice for lemon juice. Also I whisked instead of blended.   It was fantastic. Tender, juicy and packed with flavor.  I received rave reviews from my 30+ guests.  It's easy to prepare.  I will definitely use again.

Just as good as everyone says! The combination of ingredients concerned me, but it was just so good, even my little kids wanted more. I used 1/2 of the oil they suggested cause it didn't seem necessary, and it wasn't. It enhances the flavor of the meat...I highly recommend it!

Didn't have parsley on hand so didn't use it, and used bottled minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  Also just whisked it and let it marinate overnight in a marinater.  Very tasty.

Best marinade around!   2nd. time I made it I added a little
Balsamic vinegar for more flavor depth, but either way it's wonderful.  Used on a Trip-tip grilled roast......yum!

My husband said this is the best steak he's ever eaten. He always covers his steak with A-1 and did not use it with this steak.  He told me to remember this recipe. I left it in the marinade five days.

This was so good! I used flank steak from Costco and refrigerated for 2 days. I followed the recipe exactly but added 3 tablespoons of honey. Grilled 6 minutes per side on high. It came out beautifully! Thank you for a winner marinade, will definitely make again!

Not what I was expecting.  It is very flavorful but came out of the blender as a thick liquid.  I used it on a piece of ribeye and the meat was well flavored and not too spicy.

This is so darn good.  I blended so that the consistency would be smooth as pieces of herbs, especially dried herbs, scorch on the grill.  One thing I changed:  I used fresh, minced garlic.  Otherwise, perfect.  Deep flavor to accentuate the beef.  The suggestion to cooked the marinade down in a skillet of mushrooms is the perfect topping.

This was a huge hit with my husband and grown boys.  (and myself also). DELICIOUS!!!!  I marinated sirloin steaks with this overnight which I made exactly as the recipe lists it to be made. Now I want to try this on boneless pork loin chops. Can't wait.

I have a marinade I use that's very similar to this, but I decided to try this version.  Very good, however, still impartial to my own.  I use savory, instead of parsley; ground dry brown mustard instead of basil; and (sometimes, especially if it's venison) a wee bit of ginger, instead of the lemon.  I also put a few finely chopped shallots in there for good measure.

We all love it and have used with chicken breasts & pork chops too.  We do not opt for the hot pepper sauce/Tabasco and we do add minced garlic, about 1 TB and no garlic powder. Dash of (regular) salt.  I've also wondered about the need for using a blender but we all continue to make it that way, so not messing with perfection!

If one has a foodsaver device, place meat and marinade in a foodsaver bag, vacuum seal it and in 1 hour or less, your meat is marinaded thoroughly.

Really enjoyed this marinate sauce. I made it in the blender, following the recipe as is. I only had three hours to marinate the steaks which was enough time for an excellent tasting dinner. I will use this recipe again!!

We love this marinade. It's so easy and we add or subtract depending on how much meat we're using, as well as ingredients on hand. It is so versatile.

Here's how to make this even better.  Add a table or teaspoon spoon of Nutmeg and a 1/4 cup of Balsamic Vinegar.  It's almost identical to my own with the addition of the items I listed above.   I use fresh ground black pepper and will sometimes also add some Italian spice (mix Italian herbs).

It's great, and basically I have been making it for years...except I use fresh garlic and a splash of maple. That really ups the ante...tr y it. Guests have mopped the plate w/ their fingers after this stuff.

I got a VERY similar recipe (exactly the same actually) from another cooking website a few years ago, the only difference is I never blend mine, just throw it all in a jar and shake it. It'll keep in the fridge for a couple of weeks.It's my go to, and we use it on all types of meat.....

This is an easy marinade to throw together  in a pinch and I only had 1 hr to marinade the steaks, it was very flavorful! I added some flour to the leftover marinade, brought it to a rolling boil and used as a sauce.  Delicious and will absolutely make again.

GREAT marinade.  This marinade gives the steak amazing flavor and they come out juicy every time.

The only issue I have is the call for it to be marinated for up to 8 hours in the fridge.  Because of the olive oil, if you refrigerate this marinade, it eventually congeals and the steak can't absorb it.  Better would have been to offer some instruction on how long to marinate it at room temperature before /after refrigeraing or before cooking.

I don't know if I would ever do a steak in this, but I wouldn't marinate a tri-tip in anything else! I don't add the dried minced garlic or puree it in the blender first, but just shake it all in a ziplock bag, add beef, marinate in the fridge 1-3 days, then grill. It is insanely good!

I put all the ingredients in a ziploc bag and marinated my steak in it for 8 hours. It was very delicious. I have used different versions of this recipe over the years that have been good also. A little of this and a little of that. But all these flavors together made a wonderful marinade and left my steak with a bold flavor that I really loved. Thanks for the recipe!

I have been using this recipe for years. It is the BEST for the most flavorful meat on the grill. I use it on chicken too, and it is amazing! Thank you for this recipe! I do not blend it as the recipe calls for. I just throw it all in a zip lock baggie, close up the baggie and mix it up by kneading the bag, then throw in meat. The longer you let it marinade, the better!

Makes even the cheapest cut of meat tender and delicious. Marinated all day,  grilled and sliced to place over a salad.

This really is a great marinade. I let 1" and 2" ribeyes marinate for almost 24 hrs flipping them twice (once before bed and again in morning). They did NOT over marinate. Everyone loved it. It will be hard to deviate doing something different when this is so good.

 I used fresh basil instead. I added fresh minced garlic, and some hot sauce. I doubled the recipe and it was enough for 6 lbs of ribeyes. I would guess marinating for 8 hours or less will produce a very delicate flavor enhancing the steak. Next time if the timing works out, I'll try for 8 hours and see how it's different. 
I also wonder if I substituted balsamic vinegar instead of lemon juice? Maybe then 24hrs may be too much.

Updated 5/1/2016
I followed recipe and ended up marinating the ribeyes marinate for 28 hours because of having a late dinner.. Definitely too long.

Best steak marinade ever! Used minced garlic from a jar and didn't add option ingredients. I was concerned that the basil would be too much but it was excellent. Will use fresh basil this summer. Think this would be good with some fresh ginger too. Marinated cut up pieces of London broil for about 4 hours and grilled on charcoal. Juicy and tender steak, we didn't have any leftovers! Kids raved about the flavors.

I would rate this a 3.5 it was between ok and good. I used this on a ribeye steak that I pan seared and finished in the oven. I enjoyed the marinade but it wasn't anything special. I followed the recipe exact except I didn't have any basil so I used oregano instead. This was pretty lackluster for me.

This receipe is awesome!!!!
I used this and added some fresh herbs, cilantro and chunks of red onion. After 24 hours of marinating  I popped my steak in the oven then seared it in a hot pan for a few minutes only adding a pinch of sea salt and black pepper.....delicious! It was so flavorful and tender!! Will be using the basics of this marinade as a staple !! Thanks for the share

Used this with sirloin on the grill and it was enjoyed by all.  A perfect marinade, nothing overpowering.  Only change was I used fresh garlic instead of the powder.

So I made this recipe as is the very first time and it had WAY to many dried herbs. It gave the steak this awful texture and you just got a mouthful of dried up herbs... 

I made it a second time and edited what I did. First I cut everything in half. I used 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup soy sauce (full sodium), and 1/6 cup worsteshire. Added 2 tsp minced garlic, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tbs basil, 1 tbs parsley, 1 tbs lemon juice, 1/4 tsp hot sauce and let it marinade for an hour at room temperature (my steaks were cold when I stuck them in the marinade- I just left it out long enough for my steaks to hit room temperature). 

Seared the steaks in a hot pan to get some nice color on both sides. Cooked mine to rare and the husbands to medium. It was awesome with those adjustments.

Absolutely the most amazing marinade I've ever used. I use this every time I grill steak, or flank steak for any reason. The only thing I've changed is not using the white pepper or hot sauce, and use cracked black pepper instead. It's best when marinated overnight. Seriously, absolutely amazingly awesome!

Everyone  loved there steak,  I ommitted adding 1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce  which was  optional.  This will be my go to steak sesoning.  Only downside it does require a large amount of various seasonings,  but it was worth it.

This is a fantastic flavor.  I have made this for over a year now and it works great on beef steak and cubed pork loin. I have even used it on roasts. I like to marinade the meat for a day in the refrigerator,  and I try to avoid freezing my meat now.  Not sure why but two identical packages of rib-eye steak bought at the same time. I froze one, the other marinated with this recipe over night and bar-b-qued was fantastic. The frozen steak was frozen for 2 weeks, thawed and marinated over night and bar-b-qued was great but not fantastic.  

With the high cost of meat I have tried this on lower quality cuts and it is always with  fantastic results!  The pork loin bar-b-ques nicely cut in 1 inch cubes in this marinade and a chopped purple onion, in a wire cooking basket.

I added all the ingredients besides lemon juice because I forgot and I also mixed an egg, and cayenne in with the rest of the ingredients. I let it sit for 6 hours with my meat and then heated butter up in a pan and poured it all and cooked on medium-low til tender and cooked. I almost made rice and cut the meat up into small pieces. I turned the rest of the juices into a gravy with half-half milk and flour with a little bit of water.  I mixed it all in the rice and served it.  Was awesome! I will make again and I will try it with lemon juice to see if I can tell the difference or which one I prefer to make.

Steak was too overpowering and tasted too salty and lemony. Wasted 2 perfectly good steaks. I would not recommend using this and i will not be using this marinade again.

Maybe I made too much or marinated too long but this didn't work for my BF. He ate it but was not impressed.

This recipe gave us a tender and flavorful steak, but next time I will be adding Teriyaki to the marinade. The flavor was nice but seemed a little off, yet dipping the steak in some Teriyaki worked wonders. I will absolutely make this marinade again, but I will add Teriyaki next time.

Absolutely delicious! No need to blend, just mix everything in a ziplock bag and put your steaks in to marinade. Can't imagine using a different marinade ever again.

I only marinated for about an 1.5 hours, with the last 30 minutes out of the fridge and uncovered. The flavor was great especially for the timing. I used NY strip from local food store. I will keep this as  marinade for other steaks as well.

great marinade! I use fresh peeled garlic cloves and blend the whole mixture till its as uniform as possible. remember to let the steaks come back up to room temp before you grill/sear them so as to prevent the meat tensing up.

I loved this - haven't eaten the steaks yet, but wanted to eat the marinade with a spoon!  (I would do it on salads with a little less oil)

Me (Indian) and an american friend loved the taste of this sauce. Generally its difficult for me to like western food because I like my food with spices. 

I did put the meat and the sauce in a ziplockbag overnight.

I didn't have basil nor did I do the optionals... But I absolutely love this marinade. I use it for steaks and porkchops. :) I haven't tried chicken yet.... When I have the other ingredients I have no doubt it will still be yummy!! I have added honey from time to time. Still yummy ;) thanks for sharing your secrets!!!!

I made it per directions the first time. It was good. No doubt about it. I then made it again leaving out the optional items and replacing the white pepper with black pepper (I forgot to get white pepper at the store). I then got into some weird experimental mindset. I went a little strong in every ingredient,but I also went closer to 2-2.5 TBS of Worcestershire sauce (I love that stuff, anyway) and did not use a blender to mix, just a fork. I let the steaks (rib eye, both times) sit for 4 hours. Took them out of the marinate and covered one side with the drippings. While it was on the grill I put the marinate on the up side and then flipped. Again, I put marinate on the up side, flipped one more time, repeat. I cooked the steaks to medium. A true medium not the  you get at restaurants. I liked it the first time but, . The variation I made, made my wife say, "this is the best steak I ever ate." Which obviously boosted my ego but, I had to agree. Great recipe.....Thanks for sharing!
P.S. I used this recipe for 2 16 oz steaks.....I did 4 with the first attempt. I also only put the steaks in the fridge for  the first 2 hours and, they were killed the same day (both times, I always go to a local butcher).

I have used this marinade few times already and it had given me pretty good results. And keep in mind how your steak will come out depends on many other factors, such us the cut o meat, the grill temperature and grilling time,..
Back to the marinade, I just whisk the ingredients in a bowl and then pour over the steaks in a Ziploc bag. I had use vinegar for lemon juice couple of times and that didn't affect the recipe, cause both lemon juice and vinegar are acids that tenderize and break down the meat fibers, allowing the spices and herbs to infuse the steak with flavor.

Great marinade. The only changes I made were to add a touch of ceyenne pepper and to use dried minced garlic rather than powder. Fresh garlic also works.

Perfect marinade and will use over and over. I like that you can adapt to your taste easily and it won't screw it up. I used less soy sauce (because I'm not a huge fan) and didn't have any more basil on hand. Only marinated for a half hour and the flavor was excellent.

A decent start but next time I would reduce the basil by a third, it was way too overpowering. Otherwise a good marinade.

Phenomenal marinade!  This recipe was a hit with the correct cut of premium beef. What flavor! If you like spice I recommend pairing it with El Yucateco's habanero.

My son made this while I watched, he said the steaks were cheap ones I don't know but this was the best steak we have ever had.  He did as directed with one change he used 1/2 Asian soy soy sauce which is lower in salt and 1/2 regular soy sauce.  With that said we thought the only change would be to use all asian or reduced salt soy sauce.  We thought it was just a bit salty but man that stopped no one. 
He did blend it in blender and I do think that helped make this marinatde in that it kind of imalsified the dry herbs n spices.
It did not look very nice.
Marinated overnight grilled over charcoal the next day.

I didn't have half of the ingredients on this list, but decided to give it a try anyways with just mushroom soy sauce, olive oil, lemon juice, and fresh garlic. I added a little bit of chili oil and black pepper and marinated overnight. I can't afford to buy the best quality and cuts of meat, so I don't buy it very often, but on the rare occasion I do buy steak as a treat, this marinade is just what I need to make those inferior cuts tender, flavorful, and satisfying.

This was very quick to put together for a weekday dinner. I put beef slices in the marinade for a couple of hours.  Then I placed the cooked slices in a flour tortilla with some mayo (just a little bit), lettuce and shredded cheese!

I found it to be a bit too salty with regular soy sauce. I would have used the low-sodium version if I had it at the time. Thanks for posting this!

Best  marinade ever! However, don't stop with steak. We have had equal success with pork loin and chicken breast. Always moist and tasty. No need to blend with blender. Add ingredients to a storage bag, shake, then add meat. I do cut back the the dried herbs to one tablespoon. Just personal preference.

I wouldn't change anything.  My  husband says a bit too much oil only because it makes the grill burn a bit too much.  But after 2-3 hours marinating, it's sooooo gooooood!  Rave reviews everything.
Be sure when you marinade to do it in a Ziploc baggie...here is my no mess way to do it. http://1organizedmomma.blogspot.com/2015/09/marinating-in-bag.html

I made this recipe for an end of season BBQ, everyone loved it,  worked great to tenderize select cut sirloins.    Doubled the recipe,  more than enough for 5 lbs meat.   Definitely keeping this one for future use.

Consistently great. Try it, you're going to keep this one. I've tried a bunch but this one tastes great no matter what the cut of beef. It's become my go-to recipe for beef marinade.

I made this recipe as written, with Frank's Red Hot for the pepper sauce. I marinaded rib eyes for nine hour and grilled them. It went over really well with everyone. This will be my go to marinade for the foreseeable future.

Second time making this, its so good! The night before, I like to soak the steak in seltzer then in the morning I drain the seltzer, put the steak into a ziptop bag with the marinade. Steak will always be good if it's a nice piece of meat and is cook correctly.

Very Good and flexible marinade recipe. By that I mean you can "Asian"  it up a bit by adding 1/4 c. of fresh or pickled ginger and 2-3 tbps. of sesame oil and cutting back olive oil to 1/4 c.   Use the minced garlic in this marinade.
I use some of the marinade (2/3 c.) for an Au Jus by adding 1/4 c. red wine or cooking sherry, 1 tbsp.  molasses or maple syrup.  Since you have meat juices in the used marinade - heat the mixture up to a light boil in a small sauce pan.  Skim off the foam caused by the cooking beef juices if some appears on top.     For lamb chops add to the base recipe 1-tbsp. dried mint or more to taste and 1- tsp. coriander,  then add the wine and molasses/maple syrup for the Au Jus.

I used 1/2 tsp granulated garlic instead of the garlic powder, but other than that, I followed the recipe. The basil really comes through, in a good way. Will use this marinade again.

I made this recipe on the fly and loved it.  Best steak recipe I've found to date!  Made steaks very flavorful and tasty! I didn't have white ground pepper so I used black ground pepper instead. Also used fresh basil leaves instead of dried, just doubled what the recipe called for.  Looking forward to many more barbecues!

What is great about this recipe besides the fact that it kicks a ___ is it is simple.  I didn't have to work at it and had all the ingredients already.  I was glad I had picked up a real lemon because its important to use fresh in this (super lively).  I did not use the blender either and halved the recipe for two good sized New York steaks and it covered them well.  Used a few drops of Tapatio for kick. Only marinaded for 3 hours which I found to be perfectly fine.  Thanks for sharing your family's recipe!

Yum, this was awesome. Marinated thin cut flank steak for 30 min and grilled. Will definitely make again.

The flavor of the basil didn't go well with the beef flavor and it had a slight floral smell when it was pulled off the grill. My steaks were very thin so I only marinated it for 30 minutes.

Different strokes for different folks I guess. This wasn't awful but I don't understand the high rating. I followed the recipe to the T and no one thought it was a keeper, myself included. Oh well, win some and lose some!

Agreed! Great on flat iron steak that's tougher and needs a marinade. I've used the zip lock bag method and the suggested blending method. Blending gives a more even distribution of the flavors but makes a bigger clean up job. I'll stick to the zip lock and squish it around a few more times.

This tastes just like a salad dressing made in Canada by a company called Little Creek. I have wanted to recreate that dressing for years...now I have not only a great steak marinade but a salad dressing as well

Marinated a flat iron steak with this last night and it was delicious. As with any marinade, you can enhance the flavor of cheap cuts of meat, and this one is one of the better ones. One small critique: this makes way more marinade than I needed for just one steak, so next time I'm going to cut the recipe in half and see if that's an adequate amount.

Holy smokes, this was good!  I used this on an (2 lb.) inexpensive cut of chuck roast.  Made exactly as written, marinated for 24 hours, and grilled for 15 minutes each side.  This was great flavor and tenderized a tough cut of meat.  I would make this again for the chuck, not sure if I would use this on an expensive steak.  Thank you for sharing.

This is a great tasting marinade. I did not use the blender  and also did not have garlic powder and use chopped garlic instead. Great results, but one problem I found is that the huge amount of oil used created an inferno inside my grill. Next time, I will reduce the oil and pat dry before grilling. Taste wise though, it could not be beat.

I made this.  I used ribeye. it was tender and the smell was great! However, I didn't prefer the heavy soy flavor that seemed to overpower the other seasonings.

This was the tastiest marinade ever! A bit time-consuming to prepare as marinades go, but well worth the effort. I didn't have any hot pepper sauce, and I added extra garlic. Marinaded for about an hour. Charcoal-grilled. Turned an otherwise boring sirloin cut into a masterpiece! Absolutely nothing needed to be added to this steak!

it's good, but be careful not to marinade too long. the acid in the lemon juice "cooks" the outside of the meat and affects texture

Only substituted fresh garlic for dried. Left the rest the same. Meat was tender and delicious. Used it on buffalo steaks - ribeye and sirloin. Got rave reviews from my dinner party guests. Marinated for about 6 hours. Thank you for sharing!!

This is close to my marinade except I use a jalapeño instead of hot sauce and a garlic clove. Sometimes I throw in a shallot.  Sometimes I will use red wine vinegar instead of lemon juice. I use it on Flank Steak or London Broil. Skirt Steak is rarely seen in my area and if you find it, it is very expensive.

I thought this marinade overpowered the taste of the meat and just seemed a little 'off'. Won't make it again, but not everyone's tastes are the same. Sorry

I don't really measure anything when it comes to soy or Worcestershire anymore. If the steak isn't marinated in those two key ingredients just skip the receipe. This recipe gives everything a kick while being extremely simple. I used lime since there were no lemons at the store. Amazing either way.

This was really good as is. I don't have dried garlic so I just use fresh in a garlic press. Very subtle flavor without over powering the meat itself. I love this recipe and have made it several times, thanks for sharing!

Loved this marinade! I did add about 2 tablespoons of caper brine to the mix. Let the steaks marinade overnight and broil them in the oven, superb!

Green, but GOOD! Very, very good!!  Of course I changed it up and would like to share my version, as it turned out so wonderful. This will be my new and exclusive marinade, and the one I will be sharing with friends. I used Teaspoons instead of Tablespoons of the garlic, basil and parsley, and a half Teaspoon of black pepper, and added a chopped onion which I grilled on a mat alongside the steak. YUM!  I felt the larger quantities would be too overbearing. So for those of you who didn't like the original, try tweaking it like I did. You're going to love it now!!

This was okay.  I prefer a bottled Thai dressing myself.  If you have nothing like that on hand than mix this up because you probably have all these ingredients in the fridge and pantry.

I love this marinade! I used the low sodium soy sauce and used fresh garlic rather than garlic powder. I didn't have any dried parsley so I used dried oregano instead. Delicious! It's my new favorite marinade.

Well I must say this is "The Best Marinade" I have used in a long time ! I used fresh garlic out of the chopper,not powder and did not blend it all in the blender,marinade overnight and was flavor filled and juicy! (New York Strips) I did use this on chicken breast too  because we personally like the lemon/garlic flavors!! Yummmmmmm and Thank You!!

Have used this for a few years now and it's always great.  You can put the left over from the bag in a sauce pan and biol for 3-5 minutes then simmer until steak is ready for extra dipping sauce at the table.  Delicious.

Very good marinade. I did't have worcestershire sauce, so I added a wee bit of apple cider vinegar,and a teaspoon of Demorara sugar, no garlic powder, instead, I added  three cloves of fresh garlic.I added fresh copped basil instead of the dried, which was a VERY good idea!The garlic and basil flavour is phenomenal!

I rounded up on rating as it's more of a 3.5 for me. Probably more my mistake than anything, but it was a little too salty for our taste buds and herby. Will probably use again as a base and tweak to more of our liking.

The marinade smelled amazing going in and on the stovetop.  Unfortunately, the marinade was way too salty in these proportions.  I'm going to have to use low sodium soy sauce next time to see if this helps.  I'm willing to try it again, but I'm not sure about this recipe being the "best steak marinade".

I make a lot of flank steak and this brine really fills it with flavor and softens the meat. I take the liquid and then boil it down to a jus. It takes a cheap cut of meat and elevates it to something very edible.

This, in my opinion, was not good, at all, in any way. I followed the recipe exactly with no personal tweaks. It was not the meat itself, I know this because I bought the meat same day and only used this marinade on half. My kids ate it swimming in ketchup, like most other foods, and my husband ate it on the principal of being a man I guess, but in the end his normally naked steak was basted with steak sauce (kept in the house for guests and rarely used by our family). Sorry but a huge thumbs down for this one.

I didn't blend the ingredients either and it came out perfect. also i didn't do the exact measurements.. added a little more of what i liked.. lemon juice etc.. also i didnt' have white pepper and didn't use hot sauce.. still absolutely perfect! I let them marinade for only three hours and then cooked them slowly on the grill. a fantastic quick recipe, definitely using it again!

Excellent flavor and tenderness. The only downside was the smell of soy sauce left in the house for the next day or so.

Best tasting steak I've ever made! I used it on NY strips and marinated it overnight, broiled it to temp the next evening, and had no leftovers and happy bellies!

This is my new go-to marinade!!!  I made it with all the ingredients, except the minced garlic, but that was because I didn't have any left. I also only had 40 mins to marinade it before cooking it, but the flavor was phenomenal!!  I can't wait to let it sit for hours!  I also didn't blend it because I was in a hurry, but it turned out wonderfully. 
I will definitely use this recipe from now on. Excellent job, and thank you for sharing this!

The best steak marinade holds up to its name. I used this marinade for flank steak and refrigerated it overnight. Grilled it the next day for lunch and it was amazing!

Thank you for a wonderful marinade.  For those of you who didn't see the point of using the blender, please try it.  All ingredients went together much faster this way and u do not need to chop the herbs befoe blending.  I used sirloin steak and it tasted great.  I marinaded it for about 6 hours and pan sautéed on the cook top.  Very flavorful, and super tender.

This marinade was so good! Subtle and not overpowering but so tasty. I did add onion powder and used dried cilantro leaves instead of parsley because that's what I had on hand. Followed the recipe besides that. I pounded my steaks before marinating for an hour and then grilled them. Will be putting this one in my recipe box!

I do steaks all the time and when I used this marinade,  or a slight modification of it, they were great! I broiled them in the over after letting them sit for 2 hours or so. Great steaks

It was okay.   It was a bit too much for a steak.  Kinda hid the taste of the steak itself.

Very tasty and with the lemon juice makes a good tenderizer for tougher cuts. This has become my go-to marinade. I usually halve the recipe for a perfect portion for 2 steaks. And I don't bother with the blender - I just whisk everything together and then pour it over the steaks in a zip-lock bag.

I used this recipe for a steak marinade for the second time yesterday and just love the taste. I really like the basil taste even though the second time I cut down the basil to about 2 tablespoons.  I think the flavor is better when blended because the first time I did not have something to blend with.  I think it just helps all the flavors come together.  
And for any one who might think with the soy sauce it might have a teriyaki taste don't worry it doesn't.  I was nervous about that too but doesn't come into the taste.

for those who don't want to go with the hot sauce option, yellow mustard gives it some tang without heat.

Good marinade. We liked it.  I had London  broil in it. Poke the meat with forks to let marinade get all through it.i 
 I PUT some real onions garlic in it.  My husband thought it had too much Worcester sauce in the marinade. We will use this recipe again.  My daughter sayes mom this was  good. Please make this again soon.   Thank you for your recipe.

Maybe not the right fit for a "steak purist", but it is a great marinade. I like a steak with salt and pepper, but I also like to mix up the flavor as well. This is my trusty marinade on nights when I want some extra flavor.

I love this marinade recipe! Its very flavorful. I used all ingredients but omitted the hot sauce & minced garlic. After allowing it to sit over night the next day I cooked it stove top inside a cast iron pan for 32 minutes total flipping it every 8 minutes. You don't have to add anything else to it to enhance flavors. Just pull it out the ziplock bag and strait to the pan for cooking.

This is the best steak marinade I have had. I am teaching my sons how to cook (they are 12 and 14). Both love this marinade, and it is easy to do. We always have the ingredients in our house. We have substituted cayenne pepper for white pepper. It comes out great. There is no steak sauce needed when we use this. We sear it, grill it, and serve it. I have given this recipe to my friends. One of them keeps it at work to give to other people.

Great flavor.  We marinated for about 6 hours  and it turned out amazing.  We put a little canola oil in the pan at higher heat and seared for about 4 minutes on each side to medium well.  No steak sauce needed for this one.  We complimented the steaks with a great portobello mushroom recipe.  Best dinner ever!!

The title is true, it is the best. We used it on tri tip steak and let it marinade for almost a day in the fridge. Grilled it for about 20 minutes (for medium) and it was good to go. The adults and kids ate every bit of it.....Even my 4 year old who always fights us on eating meat.   Very juicy, tangy, and tender.

This really IS the BEST marinade ever!!!  (hubby even said it was the best steak he's ever had!)  I made it as written w/o changes.  I DID, however, use my Foodsaver marinade container to cut time down to 2 hrs.  =D

Very easy to make and most of us have the ingredients handy.  I don't always have time for an 8 hour marinade and it's STILL delicious.  This is my third time making it because my teenagers really thought it was yummy.

DELICIOUS!!!!! Didn't blend the recipe but did put it in a ziplock bag and shook it like a Polaroid picture. Insert two New York strips. I froze this for two days then took it out and laid it on the counter for ten (10) hours for de thawing and coming to room temp which is apparently the secret to a tender steak. Cooked them in a cast iron skillet on medium hi for four (4) minutes on each side and let sit for 4 minutes prior to serving. They were delicious. One of the best marinades I've ever had re pleasure of cooking  with. Thanks for the recipe. Saving and can't wait to find two good filets to use it on.

Amazingly good, the best steak marinade I have ever tried to be sure.  This will become a summer grilling staple.  It's easy to make.  Give it a try.

Oh,my God the best Marinade recipe I ever had it's better than any store bought brand. I didn't think it would be that good because of the lemon juice boy was I wrong. I Marinated some chuck eye steaks in it for about 3 or 4 hours and then cooked them on the grill for 5 min on each side they were so tender & juicy I could cut them with a fork and these were cheep steaks they were so delicious they tasted like an expensive ribeye.So I say again OH MY GOD!!! Everyone you've got to try this marinade it's delicious.Thanks. Will

This is an amazing marinade! We used it to add extra flavor to our holiday beef tenderloin. The results were wonderful! After marinading it for 8 hours, we grilled it to sear in the flavor and the rest is history! Thank you for sharing!

I have tried this recipe a number of times. I would not change a thing about it.  I actually marinate my steaks for two sometimes three days to really get the flavour into the steak. My husband loves it and so do I.

I added real minced garlic instead of powders since I didn't have the powders. It's really awesome. I had to use lemon juice from little plastic lemon container instead of fresh too. It's still yummy!!!!

Whenever we grill at home, we marinade our beef (ribeye, tri-tip, etc.) in this marinade. I add minced onion as well because I usually have those on hand anyway. I like to leave the coated meat in the fridge for at least 24 hours. Delicious. Hands down the best marinade I've had.

I do not normally rate but this one is worthy!  I have used this on different types of steaks and every time a huge hit.  Of course the longer you are able to marinade the flavor is stronger, but I have let it sit overnight as well as for a couple of hours.  Great steak marinade if you need one!

This is one of the best marinade's I have ever made.  So simple.  Great with sirloin steak, pork chops, and yet to try it with chicken.  Unless I find another this is the one I use now at least once a week.  Thanks for sharing.

FANTASTIC.  The optional ingredients make it even better, esp the hot pepper.  Was unsure of the soy sauce too, but wouldn't leave it out for sure.  Five stars.  Love marinades and rubs.  This one works!

Great flavor, but my meat was tough.  I used this twice on sirloin, once marinating all day and once overnight.  I'm going to try a different cut of meat next time and see if that makes any difference.

Ended up marinating for 24 hours due to a change of plans. I did not have basil and did not add the extra garlic, but did add a couple dashes of hot sauce.  The steak was super. My 15 year old daughter, aspiring to be vegetarian,  actually had seconds!

Nothing exceptional. Very bland, wished I had omitted the lemon juice, perhaps because I froze steak with marinade I lost why it was in the recipe, and doubled the amount of worcetershire (sp).

I really like this. Some reviewers didnt blend it but should. It really makes a diffrence. My hubby and daughter loved this. Always looking for new ways to make food taste good!! I did add a bit of brown sugar to only one of the steaks so I could really rate as is. I think the brown sugar adds great flavor.Thanks for sharing!

This really IS the best marinade EVER!  I have tried several since my boyfriend got his smoker and this one is a hit!  My only addition...more garlic!

This was really amazing! I love that it requires no salt because the sy sauce contributes plenty, and it only require dry spices which makes super practical. 

I do have a question for Kookie or anyone who can answer. I am making steaks on Saturday for about 23 people and they are pretty much all getting their own. I would really love to use this recipe on those.

What are the rules about doubling and tripling the marinade? Would it change the flavor, or should I just do one batch at a time?

Also, how much marinade should I use per steak? Is 1/3 cup enough? I plan to put each of them in their individual ziplock bags.

Thanks!

Obsessed with this marinade.  I use it at least once a week.  Not sure why you would need a blender.  I just throw everything in a Ziploc bag and let it sit for 24-48 hours.  It really does live up to the name.  I add a little onion powder and cayenne pepper to it as well.

Delicious, we used it on rump steaks on the BBQ. I didn't whizz this up either. Just popped in a sarnie bag and marinated for 4/5 hours. We also went without the hot sauce and used rapeseed instead of olive oil as I prefer the flavour and its cooking tolerance. I find olive oil better at lower temps (we seared the beef high and cooked low).
Highly recommend, will certainly be using this recipe from now on and can't want to try it on other meats! Best marinade yet :)

one of the best marinades I have made or purchased. Tons of flavor. I used it with some pork blade steaks I had, marinaded them over night, and BBQ'd them. It is a keeper.

The whole family loved it and it was so quick and simple. I only used fresh minced garlic. I used a less expensive cut Sirloin and allowed it to marinade for about 8hrs and the meat was super tender. Heated my grill to 400F and kept the temp between 350 and 400. Place on grill for 5mins flipped, cooked 5mins, flipped and cooked 4mins and flipped and cooked 4mins, for medium well.

Very good, especially since it calls for ingredients I always have on hand. Marinaded a couple of inexpensive thin cut steaks for a couple of hours and *boom* had a wonderful meal!  Thanks so much!  Can't wait to try it on a better cut.

I made this recipe as instructed.  The steak is juicy and delicious.  My mother came for a visit.  She isn't a huge steak fan.  She asked me to share this with my father who cooks the steaks.  
I don't want to eat steaks without this marinade.

This is the best marinade recipe I have ever tried.  It's so flavorful!  I have never put lemon and soy sauce together before and wow, the result is amazing.  I also didn't use parsley but I did put in fresh garlic in addition to the garlic powder.  I couldn't stop tasting it after I made it.  I only used about half of the olive oil called for.  I made steak with it and the hubby and I loved it, then the next night I marinated whole white mushrooms and grilled them - they turned out excellent.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

Hubby said this was a 4 or 5, but I felt it was a 3 so I compromised.  It is different, but I'm not sure I want to cover up a piece of good steak with this very often.

Barbecued a tri-tip steak using this marinade last night, and it's absolutely amazing.  I only did it for 5 hours or so, and will definitely shoot for the full 8 next time.

This is a very good fresh tasting marinade. Next time I will double the marinade and use the second batch for dipping and drizzling on the steak.

I thought this marinade was very tasty and it yielded a very juicy flank steak. I used fresh basil and parsley instead of the dried herbs.

Loved it! I prefer it without the hot pepper sauce and minced garlic. Makes quite a bit. No need to use a blender. Used it on "rib in bone" steaks aka "prime rib steaks"...YUM!

Very tasty. My wife thought it was a tad too peppery, but that could have been due to bad measurements on my end. I was very pleasantly surprised by the end result and will definitely use this again in the future.

Completely missed the lemon juice somehow and it was still awesome! Made a cheap cut of steak (patio steak) into something special!  Next time I will add the lemon juice as the acidity probably had an extra tenderizing factor! Yum! I was also skeptical that it would be too teriyaki like wig the soy sauce, but no, it was fantastic.

I enjoyed it. I used a whisk vs. a blender and it seemed to work just fine. I used black pepper and didn't have the parsley. It definitely worth trying out!

I tried this marinade on tri-tip steak, and my tri-tips have never turned out so tender! I used fresh, sliced garlic instead of powder and instead of using the last 4 ingredients, I used Montreal Steak Seasoning. PERFECTION!

This marinade was a hit with my family! Tender, juicy steaks with a bit of a bite from the hot sauce! I used habanero sauce ...we like spicy! Marinated the steaks as per the recipe for 6 hours and then BBQ to perfection! Definitely keeping this recipe!!

My daughter and I made this for my husband - he usually cooks the meat. It turned out awesome!  This will be our go to steak marinade from now on.

OMGosh this was SO good. I marinaded ribeyes in it for about 6 hours, and they turned out AWESOME. Probably the best steak I've ever had. GREAT recipe! (Made as-is without the last two optional ingredients.)

I put this marinade together for a top round from our butcher not store bought beef. I don't normally use Asian flavors for western raised beef. I like to stay close to tradition. That said I took some liberties with this recipes. I have many years experience with marinades, rubs and tenderizers. I added onion powder, salt and fresh ground black pepper and to tenderize in a shorter time frame I added some cider vinegar. I must say I will use the soy more often. It really surprised me on the flavor. And the vinegar added a nice tang. Thanks for the tip.

I decided to give this a try on steak tips for our 4th of July BBQ.  My husband was concerned about trying a new marinade on a holiday with guests.  I took the risk based on reviews and am glad I did, everyone loved it! I did make a few substitutions based on ingredients I had available.  I used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder,  1/4 tsp Cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce and black pepper instead of white.

Very tasty!  However way too much parsley and basil.  Next time I'll use a little sprinkle of each.  Good flavor otherwise.  Might be good on ribs too.

Love, love, love this marinade!  I followed the recipe exactly except cut ingredients in half since I was cooking a 1 3/4" lb. sirloin.  Only marinated for a couple of hours; cooked the steak in a hot cast iron skillet for about 3 min. on each side; finished it off in a 375 degree oven for 6-7 min.; then covered with foil to rest for 5 min.  Perfect tasty medium rare steak!  Will definitely allow enough time to marinate longer the next time.

Great marinade, the flavor doesn't overpower the meat.  Very easy to make with common ingredients.  My only regret is that I didn't marinate it long enough (only about 5 hours); next time I'm leaving it in the fridge overnight!  Also, I didn't use a blender because I was lazy and it tasted just fine.

Did not have the time to pull out the blender, so thought I'd skip that step.  Can't imagine that blending could make a difference, but next time I'll try it just to see if it does.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  DH and I thought this was incredible and loved it!  Will definitely be making again!

Crazy!  It really is the best!  I made it and had to freeze the steaks:(  because we couldn't get to them in time.  They froze in the marinade and when we thawed and grilled them, they were honestly the best steaks we have ever had!

Tried it and not a fan. 
I did go back and make it again for a nice sirloin but used fresh herbs (left out hot pepper sauce completely and used a blend of different ground peppers) and it was so so much better....

Also works very good on venison!  The oil makes it ideal for a leaner meat:) Thanks for sharing this recipe.  My go to marinade before this was very similar but the addition of soy sauce and white pepper makes it out of sight!

Great!! I am an infused oil and flavored vinegar enthusiast. I swapped the lemon for lemon vinegarette and the basil and oil --for basil flavored oil.  I did use the hot sauce.  It sounded strange when I read it but it added the perfect touch.  Perfect marinade!

It was ok... but definitely not the best in existence. It overwhelmed a lot of the meat's natural flavor.

Made it last night, and there was  NO steak left.  We Loved this receipe.  2 things I did differently, I put everything in the zip lock bag (did NOT Blend), and I used Horse Radish...it gave it a nice crunch. MY son ate his steak, and the rest of mine...Delish.

I used some lime juice instead of all lemon juice, and it was spectacular. It is not overpowering, but enhances the meat flavors perfectly. I will definitely use it again.

My grown daughter ALWAYS uses A1 on her steaks, even when I believe the steaks are amazing.  Tonight I asked her to try her steak before adding sauce.  She was amazed and put up the A1. I'm in shock! So as for her 5 stars.  I normally myself just use garlic salt, pepper and maybe a few other seasonings or McCormick Steak Seasoning and I'm happy. I don't ever use steak sauce.   For me this marinade was just ok,(I thought it needed something else or maybe it had too much of something, basil maybe) I'd give it a 3, so I'm rating it a 4.

This was awesome. I Left out the lemon juice. Poured marinade in a big ziplock bag with 2 juicy steaks. I let them sit for a few hours. Then, I patted them dry and dusted them with a steak rub.  Best steaks ever.

Amazing! My husband is not a steak connoisseur, but he asks for me to make this recipe. The only thing I do different is to stab the steaks with a fork to tenderize prior to marinating. BTW the longer it marinades the better it is.

The title of this recipe doesn't do it nearly enough justice! It was so good! I used it on skirt steak that I marinated for about 6 hours. I also did half soy sauce, half balsamic vinegar, and instead of hot pepper sauce, I used actual hot peppers, and it was just to die for! Please make this!

Have a London broil in the fridge now using portions of this marinade as a base, I replaced the lemon juice with fig balsamic, and used Greek oregano instead of basil also added a bit of honey and brown sugar and lowered the amount of soy and added a 1/4 cup of a malty beer, smelled and tasted great now just waiting to see how it blends with the steak

Very tasty! I used this for a rather cheap cut of steak and all the picky eaters in my family loved it. The only modification I made was using bottled lemon juice. I added the tobasco and minced garlic and next time will add a little more.

Very good! I did not used hot pepper (my husbands does not like his food to be spicy)used very little black pepper, 2 tablespoons of chopped garlic and marinated overnight. Steaks were tender, juicy and a wonderful taste. Thank you for sharing this simple but delicious recipe!

I would not have considered lemon juice, but it works. I mixed the marinade in a bowl and then poured it onto steaks inside a ziplock bag.

TITLE SPEAKS TRUE, this marinade was absolutely DELICIOUS. Real easy to prepare and so worth it to, if you're having steak. The flavour was amazing and the best part was that I could prep this with ingredients I'd usually have in the house (:

My husband is a meat and potatoes guy, and steak is his absolute favourite, so when he came home and found his steaks marinating in something he didnt make, he was kinda upset. But then he tasted them, and he loves this marinade. Its very delicious, I use A1 sauce on all my steaks but with this marinade, I dont need it. Definitly a winner here!

I made this once about a year ago, and now I use this marinade recipe each time I make steak. The family loves it. I've cooked it for my sister and her fiancé and they thought the flavor was restaurant quality. (I don't use as much soy sauce as directed).

I really enjoyed this recipe, I too wanted to try something different on a steak. I added a little more Worcester sauce to the marinade and used lime juice instead of lemon juice and my steak was full of flavor and tender. I even added Portebella Mushrooms to the marinade and cooked on top of my steak. Steak was great!

I didn't like the sour taste. I felt that my steaks were ruined. No one in my family could eat it. It is a very disappointing recipe especially when your hungry but you'll never know until you try it yourself.

I was not impressed. Using lemon as the acid really took away from the flavor of the steak. Maybe try with a cheap cut

This is a phenomenal steak marinade.  My daughter Rooney was not a huge fan of steak till I made this and grilled for my son's going away party and now she asks me to make it every week.   : )   Thanks for sharing.

I have been looking for a good steak marinade, and I was really surprised that this one was so amazing. Simple, yet tasty. I tried it as directed with steak tips and everyone loved them. Trying it again today (for longer soak) with tri-tip, and we'll see how it come out.

I made this pretty much as listed with the exception that I didn't have enough garlic powder so I added a little more dried garlic flakes and I used black pepper because again, I didn't have white pepper. My family loved it! It added wonderful flavor to the steaks!  Just a note that it was more saucey in texture than other marinades. I will definitely be using this again

This was a good marinade. I just stirred the marinade real well, but did not put in the blender.  I added garlic and a little garlic salt.

It had a slightly "off" taste to it.  I suspect that, like other reviewers, that the lemon juice caused the flavor problem.  I wonder if lime juice would have made a favorable difference.

Found it left the steak with a sour taste.  Need to cut back the lemon, it was also missing something, not quite sure what it was other than a little celery seed.  Will give it credit for tenderizing the steaks.

Tried this marinade today.  I think that it just had too much going on.  I don't think its the BEST steak marinade around.  Personally I use Emeralds steak seasoning and olive oil for a marinade and like it the best.  I still have not found anything better, but I like to try new things just in case.  I suppose I should just stick to it.

This marinade is simple and quick. I had 7 lbs. of USDA Top Sirloin. The steak chilled in the fridge for about 3 hours. Fired up the grill. Seared the meat, grilled the steak until the center was a nice pink color - medium rare. I let it sit for about 10 minutes. Took the first bite. Absolutely loved it. Even sopped up a little of the juice from my plate onto the steak. My taste buds were in heaven.

This is the first marinade I have ever tried, so I don't really have a lot to compare to, but I have eaten a ton of steak, and this was amazing!  I had 4 big striploins and had to double the batch.  They marinated for about 6-7 hours, yum!!!

Great marinade. I made it exactly to specs adding the optional hot pepper sauce and (fresh) minced garlic. I put 2 huge T-bones in a ziploc bag with the marinade and flipped them over every 30 min to an hour for 6 hours. Set left 2 burners on grill to full blast and left the right 2 off. After grill reached about 600 degrees, I seared both sides for 3 minutes on direct heat side then put the steaks on the indirect heat side. Using a electronic thermometer, I closed the lid and let the internal temperature slowly creep up to 140°F. Steaks came out perfect. The only concern is that some of my guests may want more "steak" flavor than I got from the marinade at 6 hours. Next time, will marinate for 4 - 4 1/2 hours and see if it doesn't come out with a little more beef flavor. All in all, my daughter excitedly ate 2 helpings (1 before even touching her favorite food, mashed potatos and gravy)and my wife said it was one of the best steaks she had ever had, period. Many thanks for the recipe. It will be put in my "bag of tricks" and I will definitely be seeing it again.

Sorry but I just got too much citrus taste from the lemon juice to be enjoyable with beef.  I followed the recipe to a "t" with the exception of not having dried parsley on hand because I always use fresh.  I marinated NY strips cut for kabobs for 4 or so hours and grilled as usual with the meat on separate skewers apart from the veggies.  The lemon just overwhelmed the beef.  Not a recipe I will go back to even though the positive reviews contradict my own.

Only reason I gave this a 4, is because I am marinating my steaks now. So will have to get back to you after dinner. I'll tell ya one thing...this is the first time that I've ever tasted the cold marinade and it was delicious! I have no doubt these steaks are going to be awesome!!

Wow. This was amazing!!! My whole family raved over it. Super easy, made with pantry staples. I used bottled lemon juice because I didn't happen to have any lemons and it was still phenomenal. I can only imagine what using fresh lemons would do. YUM.

This marinade was a big hit at a family cookout. My brother-in-law must have mentioned how amazing the steaks were at least 20 times. The only thing I changed was fresh basil for dried and fresh garlic rather than dried minced. No one thought it was overpowering and the steaks (we sed rib-eye)were very tender.

Meh, nothing to write home about.  I switched out the dried ingredients for fresh, including the garlic, and it still wasn't spectacular.  It was good, don't get me wrong, but hardly the "best in existence".

Best?  Probably not... but it's up there for sure.  Followed the recipe and used on some top sirloin steaks.  Tender, juicy, flavourful.  Liked it so much I passed it on to some folks at work.  Marinaded it for about 9 hours and it was spot on, any longer might be too much.

It was good, but not great. In my opinion, the basil and parsley added nothing to the marinade, as I could not taste them in the final product. I think making it with the first five ingredients and the white pepper would prove to be better.

Good marinade, could cut down on the olive oil so as to not be so oily of  a steak. But, as with all grilled meats, it's more of how you grill it. will definitely keep this as an option for easy and quick mariade

Sorry...but it is NOT the best steak marinade in existence.  I'm always open to trying new recipes while keeping an open mind about the outcome.  We grow our own beef, mostly use very simple but effective marinades and seasonings without fail.  Because of all the rave reviews, gave this one a try. Its got to be the lemon juice, it just doesn't belong in a meat marinade in my opinion. I will give it 2 stars for the fact that it did make our flank steak very tender (I marinated overnight) and used the remaining sauce to marinate chicken for the following night.  Will stick to my never-fail marinade sauce from here on!

Too many dry ingredients and I could taste the lemon, which was weird with beef steaks.  Hubby was not impressed either. Sorry, won't be making this marinade again.

We liked this marinade but would use a little less basil. I did add paprika to this cus we love us some paprika!  The meat was tender and very flavorful. I did marinate the meat for 8 hr. I would make this again for sure.

Excellent marinade, have used it many times.  Only change I made was to use fresh garlic (about 6 cloves, chopped) instead of minced, and a tablespoon of hot sauce.  Marinated 2 large flank steaks overnight, then instead of throwing marinade out, put 2 frozen boneless chicken breasts in bag and had those the next night.  I did not use the blender, just a bowl & whisk , then poured in the ziplock with meat....easy...

We found this to be just OK. I made it and marinated the steak as directed, but there was just such a mish-mash of flavors that it ended up tasting strongly of nothing in particular, if that makes sense to anyone but me. Usually a marinade tastes strongly of one of its ingredients and the others are just there to play supporting roles, but in this marinade, there didn't seem to be a "star" ingredient.

Loved it! My husband has never been a huge fan of marinades, but upon tasting his steak exclaimed, "I WANT THIS MARINADE ON MY SOUL!". Haha, we both enjoyed it very much and have used it several times. I didn't put it in the blender, just mixed it up in a gallon sized ziploc and threw the meat in. I hated to pour such goodness down the drain when we were done, so I threw a few frozen chicken breasts in the bag and let it refrigerate for about two days (we couldn't get to it any faster). It was SO GOOD!

I marinades a sirloin for 7hours. I don't usually get sirloin, but the price was as good as it looked.
I made the for my husband's bday, cooked on the grill to a medium-well. I ate the leftover 2 days later. It was still tend and flavorful.
This is a keeper and a sender to my friends and family.

If you haven't already tried it you might put a tablespoon of sesame oil in it especially if you're going to pan fry them and not grill them

Was fantastic, did not use the last 2 ingredients, and did not blend it.  May blender it next time just to see if there is a difference

I tried this recipe.... I marinated the sirloin steak for about one hour and then cooked on the stove top... I was initially  not impressed with the recipe but after trying the left over steak that was left in the fridge over night, I would say I would use this recipe again for sure!! it definitely needs a lot of time (preferably over night to really get into the meat) the next day the meat was 5 times more  delicious than it was for dinner. Recommended for sure.

Fantastic!  Wow, did this work well on the grilled steaks.  I pretty much stuck to the ingredients, but didn't bother to blend it - just mixed in bowl & added steaks for a few hours.

This really is the best, but what it needs is about 1/4 cup honey. Trust me, it's fantastic. Sesame seeds go pretty well too, if that's your thing. We used it for steak-tip shish kebabs and they were the best.

Great!  I cut back a little on each ingredient and had plenty for a large steak.  Marinated it about 3 hours.  Very tender.

This was good.  As per other reviews I will drop the Olive Oil as I made the mistake of making this the night before and the Oil went solid as Olive Oil does if you put it into a fridge.  All was not lost and I marinaded the steak with the remaining liquid, then fried two minutes on each side, then put the cast iron pan in a pre-heated oven for 5 minutes.  The steak tasted reaaly really good.  It could be a bit strong for some people, but I really liked it and would make again.  It makes enough for several steaks.

Its okay, good start, but its missing two key ingredients and a couple things need to be removed from this recipe. So its definitely not the best yet.

Thought I'd try this when we had two other couples over for dinner.  Didn't change anything on the recipe and it was AWESOME!  My company couldn't get over how good the steak was.  When I first put them on the BBQ I had major flames - assuming from the Olive Oil, so have a spray can ready, but after the initial flame up I didn't get anymore. 
I will be using this again!

The only problem I had with this recipe was the steak wasn't big enough (12oz New York striploin). I will never cook a steak again without using this recipe. Must admit I did not blend the ingredients but did blend using a whisk. Next time I will add the optional minced garlic. Usually my wife would only eat a half of a New York striploin which leaves a good day after snack for me. Not so this time.

This was so good. We ended up leaving it on our steaks for about three days and the flavor was incredible. I was a little worried about the lemon flavor because I don't really like lemon on my food. But the balance of flavors was great. I also substituted dried herbs because that is what I had. This was good. I did not blend the ingredients. I just dropped them into a ziploc bag, mixed them and added the steaks. They lay flat in fridge until it was time to broil them. Thanks for a good recipe.

Love, love, love this marinade. I didn't use the "optional" ingredients, but did add 3 cloves of fresh garlic and blended all together. I let it marinate for 24 hrs. We had thick steaks, and they melted in our mouths. Truely enjoyed them, especially being it was our first grilling of the year! Yeah spring! LOL

My husband did not slather his steak in ketchup after taking the "required" one bite without ketchup!  No matter how tasty a marinade I've used in the past, he's always still used kethcup.  Upon tasting his steak tonight, he declared he would not use ketchup tonight.  He raved the entire meal.

I have mixed feelings about this.  My steaks were incredibly tender after marinating for 24 hours, so it has that going for it.  But, the marinade itself has a weird, earthy flavor to it (because of all those spices).  I was not a huge fan.  It didn't have an overpowering taste on the steak, but I did was one reviewer suggested - I coated the mushrooms with the marinade and cooked them.  You could really tell the marinade's taste with the mushrooms, and it was not pleasant.  It was a little dirty tasting.

I did not blend the ingredients in a blender and I don't think it would have been necessary. I marinated my steaks for about 4 hours and it was plenty. Steaks turned out juicy and tasty. The marinade did somewhat overpower the steak taste so those who like to taste the beef wouldn't like this.

Wow this makes great steak!!! Used black pepper bc I didn't have white, and used fresh minced garlic instead of dried. Don't think those changes made a difference in taste. Amazing!!

This recipe is amazing.  I let it marinade for 2 hours.  Would not let it sit longer because it would get too strong.  Will definitely be using this again.

This marinade is awesome. Made this for a big sirloin on the grill and prepared exactly as is with the exception of black pepper instead of white (didn't have any). Will absolutely make this again!

I've used this marinade on beef, venison and chicken, and it's fantastic on all of them!  I've never added the dried minced garlic (because I never have any), but sometimes I add in crushed garlic or dried minced onions...both good additions, but definitely not needed for a great marinade!

This marinade was fan freakin tastic!! I didn't have any lemon, or hot sauce and I chose to not add the dried garlic. My ribeyes were frozen so I let them thaw in the marinade for about six hours. I swear they were better than Outbacks!! Thanks for the great recipe!

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. We made steak and lobster for his birthday dinner and this steak was so good we didn't even finish the lobster. Making this again tonight for my birthday. It's definitely going to become a staple steak marinade for us! So tasty and juicy!

Really simple recipe. I made it even simpler by not including the Worcestershire  sauce (not a big fan) and parsley. I also just dumped everything in a bowl and stirred until mixed. I then added the meat to the bowl and let sit for about 45min. The steak turned out great! So delicious, this is probably my favorite steak marinade to date.

I made this without the hot pepper and minced garlic but I did add 1 tbs. of brown sugar to the mix and it gave an excellent balance. I will use this recipe from now on, it was excellent.

Excellent! I cooked strips of beef, onions, and bell peppers in it and eat it with rice. I'm always going back for seconds. Small tip: It calls for *a lot* of seasonings and I'm trying to save money. I made it with about 3/4 Tbsp garlic powder, 1.5 Tbsp basil, and 1 Tbsp parsley and it still tasted delicious. I could probably make it with less next time and it would still be great.

Did not blend, just put everything in a plastic bag, shook it up, then put in the meat. I let it marinate overnight.

I haven't tried making my own marinades for the most part; however, having tried this one, I can't imagine a marinade any more delicious.  I didn't have the parsley or I didn't use the fresh garlic only because of the amount of garlic powder, but next time I will try the recipe as written.  It was wonderful.  I definitely will try it again. Thank you!!  ~Lucy from Pasadena, CA

My husband LOVES steak, and proclaimed this the best steak marinade he has ever had.  You don't have to blend everything together - just toss it all together in a bowl and pour it over your steaks.

I was looking for a steak marinade that I use for fajitas. Because I knew I wanted it for fajitas I changed just a couple of things... I used oregano instead of basil, lime juice in place of lemon and fresh garlic instead of the dried garlic. My husband raved about the steak so I will use this again for fajitas or just a nice piece of steak.

I used this marinade last week and was totally pleased. My only regret was using  striploin instead of a cheaper cut. It was so good my girl ate her whole steak instead of just half.

This was delicious! We were arguing over who got to have the leftovers - which I took and they were still tender. ;)  However, though I rather rate a recipe on it's own merit, I have to say I did combine this with  Sirloin Steak with Garlic Butter here on AR. Great combination.

Fabulous!!! We didn't have dried garlic, so I used fresh and it was still great. Marinated for about 4 hours, and halved the recipes for just 2 steaks, and proportions worked perfectly. Highly recommend!

I came across this recipe wanting to try a new marinade. I have to say that I was surprised!
Everyone loved it! Even my mom who is not a steak person said it herself.
I did however have to make small changes due to lack of supply. instead of using lemon juice I used 1/3 cup of lemon infused olive oil, and cilantro instead of parsley. And if u want a little more bite maybe add a little more hot sauce.
Will defiantly be making this again. :)

Very good flavor. I grilled over propane, so the oil caused flare ups so I had to be pretty careful about that. I'm sure this wouldn't be as much of a problem over charcoal, or if I didn't have my grill cranked to the max. However, as far as flavor goes..outstanding!

This is THE marinade! I've made it several times and I always get rave reviews from my family and guests. It's as good on chicken thighs as it is on steaks. 
Here are my few adjustments: I use vegetable oil, instead of olive oil. I use 1-2 fresh, minced garlic cloves, instead of dried. And, I never keep dried parsley, so I skip that altogether. 
This recipe is a real winner.

We had some dynamite rib eyes last night thanks to this marinade.  They were in the marinade for about 6 hours.  I loved how they immediately flared up when placed on the grill.   Gave a great sear.  I like my steak well-done and it was still juicy.  Great job on this one.

I have used this recipe a couple of times now and the family absolutely loves it.  Don't be afraid to use it on chicken or pork, it is just as delicious.  It is now in my top 5 list for marinades that I will use for years to come.  Thanks for sharing, Kookie!

It's good but not mind blowing.
I use less ingredients when I grill steak. Simply brush dond entire surface of meat with olive oil, then add minced garlic, 1/2 - 1 TBS crack pepper and a few dashes of Mrs. Dash Table blend. GReat seasoning yet true grilled flavor with each bite.

How could I not try it with this title?!  It is awfully good - didn't overpower the meat, but tenderized a cheap cut nicely.  The changes I will make next time are to use just real minced garlic instead of powder, and to cut back on the "green stuff" - too much basil and parsley in my opinion.  A tablespoon of each would be more than enough to get the flavor in there, without coating everything in moss-like crud (ending in a nicer presentation).

Very nice marinated.  I didn't blend but just stirred and then put it and the meat in a ziploc bag.  I marinated it for at least 6 hours and flipped it and squished the marinated around about every hour.

Wonderful marinade!  This is a keeper!  It's really perfect for kabobs.  I marinate the veggies and steak in different containers for the day, pop em on the skewers and grill.  Wouldn't change a thing!

Delicious! I didn't have white pepper, so I just used black.  I omitted the hot pepper sauce, but did add the minced garlic.  I used it on NY strips and marinated them overnight in a ziploc bag.  Everyone really liked it.

I've been using this recipe fir years on steak and chicken it never disappoints... I'm really surprised by the bad reviews! I made this once without using a blender and it was meh so not sure if that is what ppl r doing.... U must blend it or use a magic bullet to thoroughly mix everything!  I've added sriracha or chilli garlic sauce for the hot sauce and We simmer the left over marinade and pour it over the meat and it is extra delish!

It is the best steak marinade I have ever used!  I only had one hour to marinate my steak and it was still exceptional! I will be using this many more times.  JUST THE PERFECT COMBINATION OF FLAVORS COMPLIMENTING THE FLAVOR OF THE MEAT.

This is such a great flavorful marinade.  I left out the hot sauce and minced garlic.  I used almost a 3lb london broil.  First, I rubbed it with garlic and onion powder and season salt.  Let that sit for 1-2 hours.  Then wisked all the marinade ingredients together and poured it over top.  Soaked that for another 1-2 hours.  Then broiled it for 10ish min or so on each side. Perfect!  Will definitely use this recipe all the time.

This was very good, but a little too salty for us. We'll definitely make it again but with less soy sauce. Used it with flank steak on the grill.

It really is! At least in my entire marinating history, this is the best steak marinade that I have run across. Marinading steaks in this for a good 36 hours before grilling during Memorial Day weekend. Made some homemade steak fries and a fresh salad - this was better than any Steakhouse joint that I have ever been to and the highlight of the weekend! I have plans of repeating this again VERY soon, and that's saying a lot since I usually try to avoid red meat!

This marinade is incredible. I have used it with moose, bison, elk, sheep, and beef. Aftet the steak comes off the bbq my family enjoys adding steak butter to the top (steak butter - herbs, garlic and butter mixed).

I don't know if it's the best in existence, but despite the rather unorthodox herbs, it really is very good. We had this on t-bones and it was very tasty, no need for steak sauce. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Used this on the first grill of the season and it was a spectacular meal! The recipe lives up to its name.

Definitely best marinade I've ever tried.  I whisked ingredients together and only marinated for about 4 hours in fridge.  Results were amazing BBQ'd sirloin steaks!

I made this the first time for Mother's Day and my family really liked it.  I had only been able to let it marinade for that day and I used whole beef tenderloin.  At first I thought it was ok but found myself wanting more later in the evening and had to make it again.  This time I used whole beef tenderloin again and I was able to let it marinade for 2 days.  I also used about 1/2 of the lemon juice and I used about 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar.  It is more of an acidic flavor and if you crust the meat up a little by having a nice hot grill, the crusty meat and marinade flavor dances on your tongue a lot longer.  I also didn't find the need to blend the mixture.  I haven't tried using fresh herbs yet especially because there' s so much flavor with the dried, plus I also used a tablespoon of dried oregano too.  I enjoyed this and will again and again.

Wow what a great marinade. I was so surprised how flavorful it was. I marinaded my kabobs with it. I added a few extra of my favourite spices and it was fantastic

Great marinade. I added a bit of rosemary to counteract beef's carcinogenic tendencies when grilled and served over a bed of rice and garlic sauteed spinach.

This was an excellent marinade! I wish I had used a better cut of meat so that we could have thoroughly enjoyed it. Can't wait to try it again.

I am making this for the 2nd time today- for fathers day. The first time i let it marinade for 2 1/2 days. It was fabulous. I made mine with a mix of lemon and lime as i love lime. I also use only fresh garlic and fresh herbs, but i didn't put in blender. Just whisk really quick for about a minute. This marinade is by far one of my  favorites.  Meat comes out really tender.

Have made this several times now & each time it's come out perfect. It doesn't matter if you have a change in plans & leave it in the marinade for a day or three, the steak only becomes more tender & the flavor only enhances the meat - it's never been over-powering. Always receive compliments, kudos to the author!

This was delicious. Lots of flavor. The only thing I did different was not use the blender - lazy I guess.  I let two filets marinate all day, then threw them in a pan for about 10 minutes.  Let rest, sliced thin, and served over a spring mix salad tossed with an olive oil/balsamic dressing.  Will definately make this again.

Such a GREAT marinade! Just tried this recipe and it was an instant favourite. Such a great flavour that doesn't overpower the steak - just the perfect blend of different herbs and tastes. I will definitely make this again!

Worked out great! Next time will cut back the soy a little and marinade for a shorter time.  I did two filets for 7+ hours and think I could have gone 4 hours with better results.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This marinade was GREAT! I only had little over an hour to marinade this and was worried that the flavor wouldn't be very strong but it was! I even managed to convince my BF not to cover his steak with sauce before trying it and he was happy he did! I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Loved it! Just grilled 8 minutes each side of steak and came out great. Love the spice mixtures, very flavorful. Steak just seemed juicier and the char portions were outstanding.

Finally tried this recipe the other night with some tenderloin steaks - awesome. Great flavor, nice and tender. We let them marinate for a whole day. Even good reheated!

It is the BEST ever! I have been in pursuit of a sweet and garlicky marinade that is savory.  This one did it for me. It tastes like fine dining and can turn any piece of red meat into a great bite.  Thank you SO much for sharing.  I will treasure this one and have lots of fun at our dinner parties!

I added 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar just to see how it works.  I can't wait to cook my steaks.  It's been so long since I had a great steak!!

I have never found a marinade that I have absolutely LOVED, but this one's a winner! I don't eat much meat, but this marinade leaves me wanting more. I didn't add the last 4 ingredients and I used black pepper instead of white pepper- it was PERFECT! I think the basil and parsley would have changed the flavour a tad too much.

I don't think so.  I didn't care for the flavor.  It didn't overpower the steak flavor but it didn't add much to it either, unless you like Teriyake steak.

The only changes I made were no hot sauce & cut down on the basil a little. It smelled wonderful. My steaks marinated for almost two days. They were okay but for a steak they tasted way too herby. The parsley & basil just didn't seem to go w/ steak. And even w/ the soy sauce, I thought it needed more salt.

My family and I love this recipe...even my picky 9 year old!  I marinate the meat all day and then throw them on our panini grill for a few minutes.  Perfect on both sides and pink in the middle.  Since we started using this recipe we eat steaks once a week.  Left overs make a great addition to salads for lunch the next day.

Awesome marinade. I blended it in my food processor.  Turned out  thick and creamy.  Different than if i would have just stirred it. I only marinated it for about an hour before I grilled it. Very flavorful.  I did not use basil and guessed at measurement.  Will use this again.  Thank you.

Made this last night and it was awesome!  I only got to marinate for about 4.5 hours, but it was still great.  Even my picky, youngest (age 5) ate it and my oldest (8) said, "This recipe is a keeper!"  Will use again and again!  :-)

This was a good marinade. I wish I could have let the steak soak for longer. We only had a few hours. The flavors were great though. I will try this again!  No one could taste the hot sauce. I will add more of that too!

I have always used a teriyaki marinade and loved it.  My husband was wishing for something that tasted more like steak.  This was fantastic.  We ate it for a stay at home girls date with a great salad and we felt like we were at a fancy restaurant. Yum!

Awesome marinade!!! I did some steaks in this stuff & it was great! I had 4 small steaks & still made the full marinade. The only change I made was using 2 TBSP of basil instead of 3. I used the hot sauce but left out the optional fresh garlic cause I was in a rush. Fantastic, TONS of flavor!

This recipe was ok. The flavors were nice, not great. Sorry. It did make my steaks very tender though. The smell while frying them up made a sort of rancid smell that was kind of overwhelming, but could be overlooked if the marinade was amazing. It wasn't a favorite in our house though. I think we will stick with using Famous Daves Burger & Steak rub. (I used real garlic)

Absolutely delicious.  Great change from your typical teriyaki steak marinade.  I halved the recipe since I was only making one steak.  The only other change was that I used minced garlic from a jar instead of garlic powder or dried minced garlic.  I had a frozen flank steak which I partially defrosted, placed in the marinade overnight then broiled in my oven the following evening.  Hubby and kids all loved it.  Thanks for the great recipe!  Can't wait to try it on the grill this summer!

This is one of the best marinades I've had in a long time. I used it with some really nice cuts of filet mignon. it was awesome. I cooked them on the stove and turned then every minute until they were cooked medium. The only thing i will do different next time is use a lot less worcestershire sauce. it was kind of too much. thank you

This was the first time I've made steak... ever. I've always been afraid of it. I decided to try this recipe and am so glad I did. My family and I enjoyed it very much. I followed it exactly. Only marinated for 3 hours. I think I'll try to marinade longer and cook the steaks in the slow cooker. Mmmmmm. :-)

This is a good marinade. It made our freezer burnt steak taste great! I'll keep this on hand for those times when you need to give your meat a little pick-me-up. I'll bet this would be good with chicken or pork too.

I marinated very thick fillets for the suggested 8 hours. WAY too strong!  We could barely taste the meat, I will not be using this again, just plain soy sauce for an hour is the best I have found, maybe this would be ok if just used for an hour or so, or on a different peice of meat, a sirloin maybe?

Made this marinade exactly by directions. Let NY Strips marinate about 3 hrs. Just wasn't good to our liking.  We eat steaks often & typically rub Cavenders one 1 side of steak & Montreal seasonings on the other.  Much better. Just hard to beat my old stanby.

Excellant!  I needed a quick marinade for steak tonight and this was easy.  I didn't have the time to marinate for 8 hours.  Instead, they marinated for 2 hours and were still excellant.  I did not keep all the herbs on the steaks while grilling.  I have some picky eaters who think they do not like these flavors, but LOVE them when they can't actually see them.  :)

This marinade is the best. My boyfriend loved it and so did our families. I accidently put in 1/4 of a cup of hot pepper sause instead of 1/4 of a teaspoon. Oops! They didn't even notice ;p

I put this on a sirloin tip roast and marinated for 6 hours. Excellent.  My Son noticed immediately that I've never used this marinade before and he loved it.

I highly recommend not putting the pepper in this one...and leaving it in the dish for the full eight hours. I left it for 2 and didn't truly enjoy the flavor. It was very different and tasty but I think I will stick to my own. Congrats on coming up with it!

It is a yummy little marinade. I like to use this when I go cheap and get tougher cuts of meat. I let mine marinade for 12 hours, flip the meat, and let it set for another 12 hours. You really only need a super hot cast iron skillet, salt, and pepper for the perfect steak.

This recipe is everything it claims to be and more! I marinated some steaks and veggies for kabobs using this marinade and it was delicious. They all marinated for about 8 hours before grilling and I served over couscous and my guests loved it. Threre wasn't a single kabob left. Very flavorful, but not too overwhelming. The only thing I would change is using a reduced-sodium soy sauce since I have hyptertension and try to follow a low-sodium diet. It was a bit salty for me, but none of the other more healthier guests had the same issue. Also, I didn't have white pepper so your garden-variety black pepper worked just as well.

This tasted very good, but perhaps I let my steak marinade too long.  The lemon juice started to "cook" the meat so parts of it had a wierd texture.  I also used a rather thin cut round steak.  I'll make this again with a thicker cut of meat and keep an eye on the marinade time.

Amazing marinade. Makes a good steak great, and a great steak even better. I used this when my in-laws came for dinner and they were so impressed. I hardly want to share the recipe so I can keep this secret to myself!

Tonight was truly one of the best steaks I have ever had in my remembrance. I have to say I was leery because I can't say I've used basil with steaks before. We had rib steaks with this marinade.   We didn't have the hot sause or fresh garlic with it but it was still amazing.  We marinaded it for about 4 hrs which really permeated the steak and then we brought the meat to room temperature for about 2 hrs (always a good thing to do with steak) Thanks Kookie for sharing this with us, it was  "THE BEST STEAK MARINADE IN EXISTENCE!"

This review is based on my changes.  Was quick and easy and pretty good.  I used low sodium soy sauce, added a couple dashes of liquid smoke, and left out the lemon juice.  If I were to make this again though, I think I would use a little bit less of the dried basil.  Maybe just 2 tbs.

We had an office bbq last week and I found this recipe and convinced them to let me marinate 80 steaks with this recipe.  It was a HUGE HIT!!!  The fresh lemons were not real nice  and they were pricey so we used Real Lemon Juice instead.  I will use fresh at home in the future though.... :)

I really liked this mariade. The only issue I have is the herbs tend to float up in the mizture. Thats easily fixed by marinating in a ziplock bag and it's less mess as well! Simply toss the bag! This was great on some really thick rib eyes, I let them sit for a whole day. Would also be great on some porck chops and chicken. Very versatile recipe.

The name pretty much says it all.  I am not much of a steak eater, and usually have chicken instead.  But tonight, my husband insisted that I try his steak, and I have to admit, it was better than the chicken I was eating.  I should have used this marinade on the chicken as well.  I think that this would work well on chicken, as well as some types of fish.  I marinated the steaks overnight and they turned out flavorful and juice.  What a great find!

My husband loved this. I got A1 sauce just in case (he often likes to add things to what I've cooked him) but he didn't even use it. I used this with a rib-eye steak and grilled it. Perfection!

Made exactly as the recipe stated and it delivered! My boyfriend fired up the grill with some juicy fillets and they came off PERFECT, like I would expect from an expensive restaurant. Will not need to waste money on mediocre steaks when dining out anymore when we can just whip this up.

Super! I have made this several times. Usually i follow the directions pretty close but this last time I was in a super hurry and running out to a BBQ so I just grabbed all the ingredients, didnt even measure them, dumped it all in the blender then into a ziplock with the meat (seriously 5 mins total!) and it was still AWESOME. Love this sauce.

Love this marinade!  It had a little too much basil and for my liking so I cut it in half.  I have never had steak this tender made at home.  It was delicious.

By far the name for this marinade is accurate.  We put this on filet mignon last night and as soon as I tried it I could not put my steak down!  Amazing!

WOW! I'm not a real steak person, but my BF  has been cooking and loving steak for years. I LOVED it, and he said it was the best steak he had ever had! I followed pretty closely, used low salt soy sauce, fresh basil, did not have any parsley, used crushed garlic only. Marinated 24+ hours, grilled, FANTASTIC! Thanks!

I haven't tasted a better steak marinade.  Used 4 cloves fresh garlic and 6 leaves fresh basil -- no dried garlic powder or basil.  Marinated 8 hrs.

The best ever. We use this when ever we entertain. We have also started to use it for camping. I can make it at home and just put it in freezer bags. No prep at the campsite just a perfect meal.

Truly the "best" steak marinade we've ever had! My husband wanted to "lick the plate" when he finished his steak!!  This is a must keep recipe - and the cook who developed it should bottle it and sell it!

My father used to make a marinade similiar to this one and it brings back many memories.  I found even marinading for 2 hours was enough for less thick cut rib eyes but marinading over night was good too.  Fantastic!

This steak marinade was amazing.I modified mine though....i added more worceshire and a tad bit less soy sauce.I used fresh garlic and lemons.I notice that a lot of the one star reviews they are rating it low because they didnt use enough steak ex.two small steaks....i used about 2-3 lbs. of steak....the steak turned out tender and flavor full...i cooked my steak on a lower temperature so they be more tender,but overall i rate this marinade 5 stars.

This was delicious.  We used fresh garlic and herbs and we've made it with dry/powdered garlic herbs.  Either way it was delicious.

Excellent!!!!   The only thing I did different was use fresh parsley instead of dried.  This marinade is not over powering like some, just adds a nice flavor to the meat.  I also marinated some fresh mushrooms in a separate container  and cooked in a pan while steaks were grilling.    Yummy!!

this is an excellent marinade.  Fairly salty but great flavor.  I buy sirloin filets, cut into 1 inch pieces.  marinate overnight. I don't use the hot pepper sauce and instead of dried minced garlic use 2 minced garlic cloves.  Skewer then grill for 8 minutes.  I've made this for company 2x and it's been a huge crowd pleaser.  Be sure to serve with something like  feta couscous or rice-you dont want to overpower the flavor.  I highly recommned this marinade.

We bought half a grass-fed cow and ended up with tough steaks. I marinated some in this overnight and they turned out tender and tasty! This is definitely going to be a regular on my menu. I used fresh garlic, fresh basil and fresh parsley instead of dried.

Made steaks on the grill after marinating them for about 4 hours in this marinade.  DH and I both loved them!  Yummy!  Will be using this again.  Thanks!

I tried this recipe this past weekend for my steaks, and I must say, it's the BEST ever!!  My husband loved it, as did I.  I wouldn't make any changes to it, it's perfect.  Thanks for this recipe! I will definitely be using it again, and again.

This is absolutely hands down the best steak marinade I have come across. My family loved it. I used cubed sirloin and marinated it overnight and grilled them speedie style. Absolutely phenomenal. They were gone in minutes.

I'm a newbie at marinade's and grilling! I don't order steak at restaurants because it's usually tough and no flavor.  I paid 17.00 for 2 steaks ... chose this marinade and I couldn't have been more pleased!  My steaks were tender and tastey!!!!!

The marinade was good, reminded me chimchurri, but just was not to my taste.  I wanted to try something different as  mine is just olive oil, water, vinegar, cracked black pepper, and kosher salt.  Still like that better.

About 3 average lemons to equal 1/3 cup. Roll them on the counter before you cut them and the juice will release and be easier to squeeze. I don't think you would need to blend the ingredients. Just add them all to a bag. The oil will make everything stick to the sides of whatever you are mixing in. Mix yourself and then add the meat. You can add or take out anything but I think this is a great marinade!!

Family LOVED this!  We make an additional of 4 servings by adjusting the quantity and simmer 10 minutes on the stove.  We use this for dipping the steak in. So good!  Only changes were to use fresh parsley, basil and garlic rather than dried.

This marinade is only as good as the steak you serve it with in my opinion. I have made this recipe a little over 4 times now and i must say if you marinade it early on before you cook it, it wil turn out better in my opinion. Put a bit more parsley and basil than the recipe called for out of preference but each time this recipe continues to make me a winner amongst my family.

This is truly the best. I used all ingredients but did not put in blender, just mixed up in a bowl. The marinade made our top sirloin taste like a steak house ribeye. I can't wait to try it on some of our venison. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Delicious.  I only got to marinate the steak for about five or six hours. Next time I think I will aim for at least 24 so it can soak into to meat more.

Very Good marinade.  Didn't overpower the meat, but gave it a good flavor and tenderized it.  I just blended all ingredients together.  Used half lemon juice and half lime because I ran out of lemon juice.

What a delicious marinade!  We've used this marinade on rib eyes and filet mignon (I know, the filet mignon's don't need it).  They grill up so nicely and have a really nice flavor with the unusual combo of ingredients.  My husband LOVES this and my kids eat this steak now without A1 steak sauce because it has so much flavor!  Thanks for the recipe!

Literally the BEST homemade marinade ever! I used all ingredients as listed (even the optionals), but didn't see a need to blend it. Since you're marinating in plastic ziploc baggies anyway, I saved the dirty dishes and just mixed it up in the bag before adding the steaks. This recipe was the perfect amount for 2 HUGE steaks with enough leftover to brush on while grilling. We also brushed veggie skewers (zucchini, summer squash, mushrooms, red pepper) with the marinade and they were fantastic! Thanks :)

I followed this recipe exactly as listed, except for using salt free soy sauce, fresh garlic and lime juice instead of lemon, since that is what I had at the time.  I blended it in my Magic Bullet and marinated all day.  BBQ'd the NY steaks, and they were absolutely fantastic.  This is the best of marinades, and I have had many!

Epic steak marinade. Goes good on a hunk of london broil, indirectly smoked with cherry wood and lump oak charcoal. Extrêmement délicieux!

I used this marinade for rib eye steaks last night and it was a huge hit with everyone.  My fiance's son said that it was the best marinade in existence.  I started them on Saturday afternoon and served them Sunday night.  The flavor was not overwhelming, but very tasty.  The only change I made was to use fresh garlic--about 7-8 cloves minced.  Great recipe.  Thank you.

Very good, the only change I did was I had fresh basil so I added that instead of dried.  Fantastic!

YUM - I rarely use marinades but I bought a tough cut of meat and used this marinade for nearly 24 hours. I was unsure about the amount of basil that went in, and when the meat came out, I thought it smelled a little strange but when I took my first bite, I fell in love, haha. I didn't have any garlic powder, so I put in 2 tsp of minced garlic and I omitted the dried garlic. I'll also be putting more hot sauce in next time, maybe a full teaspoon. Definitely a keeper!

This is wonderful recipe!  My husband and step-son love it!  Only one change I made is to add some dashes of onion powder.  Next time, I want to try mixing very small size-chopped onion.

Loved this recipe.  I used this marinade on pork tenderloins and bbq'd them for Easter.  My brothers said "The pork rocked" and they took home all the leftovers.  It was just the right combination of spices.  I did use mirin rice wine vinegar because I didn't have enough lemons, and it was still delicious!!!! Thanks for the recipe.

I really like this. It has the best flavor. I didnt have chili paste with garlic so I used chili sauce and 1 tsp of red pepper flakes for the heat. I didnt have any chinese wine so just skipped that. Even thought I changed it. It still was awesome. Definately will use a lot.

I needed to find a marinade for the lamb chops I made today for Easter dinner.  I used this recipe because it was very easy to make and had such great reviews.  Since I was making lamb, I decide to replace the basil with rosemary.  I didn't have enough rosemary, so I wound up using 2 Tbsp parsley, 1 Tbsp rosemary and 1/2 Tbsp thyme.  I also added 1/2 tsp of a mixed black/red pepper spice and 1 tsp of brown mustard (I didn't have Dijon).  I blended the mixture, poured it over the lamb and let it marinate in the refrigerator for 5 hours.  When it was time to cook the lamb, I poured off the excess marinade and grilled the chops on high heat.  The lamb cooked beautifully on the grill.  The meat was very tender and flavorful.  No need for steak sauce or gravy.  The marinade added flavor, but did not overpower the meat.  I caught my son sucking the small bits of meat off of the lamb bones.  He really loved this recipe and so did my husband and I!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I don't know about the "best in existence" but it certainly is good.  We used this on strip loin steaks.  I marinated them all day.  I didn't bother pre-mixing but just put everything in a ziplock bag and shook it up with the meat.  The flavours are strong but we enjoyed the combination.

I have no complaints or changes to this marinade at all!  So quick to make - didn't use a blender but just whisked it up.  The flavor was just perfect and not too salty.  I only marinaded my steaks for about 3 hours but they were packed with flavor.  I did not end up using either of the optional ingredients. I usually use a  McCormick marinade packet but from now on this will be my go to recipe!

In the middle of preparing it I realized I was out of parsley and only had a bit of basil left.  I added the basil I had.  In order to get that herb flavor I used oregano, marjoram, a bit of rosemary and a bit of thyme.  I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but my boyfriend loved it.

Great marinade.  All guests loved it. Even the steak that was cooked to well done was still jammed with juice and flavor. Will use again and again.

Best marinade in existence seemed rather optimistic, but I figured I would try it out.  I get pretty tired of soy sauce based marinades, it seems as though 99% of marinades have soy in there.  I was a little skeptical because of the soy, but it is quite subtle.  Overall, I thought this was excellent.  I did blend it but I don't really see the need for it.  Nice thing about the blending is the herbs get ground up and all over the steak.  I also used the extra marinade to cook mushrooms in, that was a great idea.  They were terrific.  We will definitely use this several times.  I can say it is the best steak marinade I have made.

My boyfriend LOVED this marinade.  No other marinade that we have made or tried has been this delicious. I let it marinate over night, and when I made the steak, it smelled divine, and tasted even better :)

Really liked this recipe! After reading a lot of reviews, my changes were....used low sodium soy sauce, only 1 tablespoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon dried basil, lowered pepper amount to 1/2 teaspoon (not a pepper lover). Added 1 tablespoon brown sugar, 1 teaspoon minced garlic from a jar, and 1 teaspoon onion powder. I will use this marinade again, but might only use 1/3 cup olive oil. It makes a large amount. I only had about 2 hours to let the meat soak. I used it on a top round and then cooked it on the George Forman grill. Husband came back for thirds! He left just enough for one meal today, lol. Guess I'll be nice and let him enjoy it one more time. I would agree, it's the best!

Certainly the best marinade! We added just a dash of salt and the seasonings were perfect. Marinated overnight in the fridge then grilled on George Forman grill.

I added some fresh mushrooms, cut in 1/2, to the bag after the steaks came out. Let them absorb some of the flavor and then simmered everything at Medium heat till steaks were done...  This  stuff is the BOMB... Thanks.

I never give reviews but I had to on this one!  This is OUT OF THIS WORLD!  We were planning on fixing sirloin steak for dinner which I do not care for so I searched for a recipe to give it some flavor.  Came across this one and so glad I did!  I was out of basil so used everything else it called for and then added some italian seasoning, it was delicious!  My husband who never cares for marinated steak really liked it too!  Thanks so much for sharing!!

Followed the recipe just as described and it turned out great. I let the steaks marinate for 4 -5 hours and grilled to an easy medium. Great flavor and the family just loved it.

i've never had a better tasting steak! NEVER. i always have to use some type of steak sauce because there is never enough flavor. once i took a tiny bite to taste it, i had to really try and not shovel it in like a cave woman! i will never use anything else for my steaks but this marinade. i wouldn't change anything! i didn't have any basil, but i followed everything else exactly, including the optional ingredients. it was just amazing!

A lighter-tasting steak marinade than I'm used to, but very tasty! If you're looking for something smoky and robust, this probably isn't for you, but it's got a nice flavor that's unique enough to be interesting.  Oh, and no need to blend it...just stir or shake it up good.

This is awesome... I didn't change a thing except I used fresh basil (marinated for 24 hours). My fiance is SUPER picky about his steaks and he said this was the 2nd best he ever had.. after some ridiculously expensive steakhouse in South Florida. I'll take that!!! Thanks for sharing Kookie!!

Made this marinade the other night and boy was it good! My husband who is really particular on how his steak is prepared exclaimed that this was one of the best steaks he ever had.  The only thing I did differently was I used my garlic press on three cloves of garlic. It really gave the marinade an intense but balanced flavor of garlic.  This one is a keeper!!

I used this marinade for New York Strips for Christmas.  It was a hit.  The steaks were 'melt in your mouth.'  To save prep time I froze the steaks in the marinade for a few days before defrosting for the holidays.  Great way to save time.

This marinade is so wonderful!  I don't have a blender so I just mixed this by hand but it still came out great! I ended up leaving the steak in the marinade for over 2 days since the meal kept getting put off and it only made it better.

I added balsamic vinegar and it tasted just perfect. We used a cheap cut of steak but with the marinade they turned out deliciously tender.

Very Good!!! Didn't have white pepper and used black pepper instead and it was fine.  Also added 2 cloves of pressed fresh garlic.  Very tasty and there wasn't any steak left over.

Excellent! Instead of the dried herbs and garlic I used the "fresh from frozen" kind (herbs are frozen and 'ready to use' in a little box or sometimes cube form) and this turned out fantastic! We sauteed some mushrooms, garlic, parsley, red wine and some 'instant beef gravy' mix for a nice sauce which worked well with this marinade.

We have had strip loin steaks recently and they were not as tender as I had hoped for.  This time I used this marinade.  Every single steak was very tender.  I only marinaded them for 5 hours and they were very good and the marinade was not overpowering the steak taste.  Used fresh garlic.  New favorite for us!!!  thanks.

Super delicious. I have never had a steak fail with this marinade. No steak sauce needed and your steak is left so moist and full of flavor. I use this on 2 thin cut top sirloin steaks and half the recipe for the marinade and it works out perfect.

This was a great marinade.  I did not use the optional hot pepper sauce, as we don't like spicy in our house.  It had a nice little bite from the pepper; just enough for us.  I will make this again!

Made this for my daughter who usually dredges her steak in A1 or barbecue sauce. She took one taste and put the A1 sauce away.  This marinade is awesome and I will be using it frequently.

Very good.  I've made it several times.  The only problem I had was once when our dinner plans changed after I had started marinading the steaks, and I left them in the fridge for about 2 days before making them.  They tasted very strongly of lemon and were not as good as when I marinade them for a shorter time.  I find them best after about 4-6 hours.

Delicious and easy! I added about a tablespoon of white sugar and about a half teaspoon of ground cumin.  I used the marinade on a flank steak.

My husband and some friends went crazy for this recipe!  (i'm a vegetarian, so i didn't eat any steak but i can tell you that marinade smelled amazing)  I did cut half the basil because i thought that 4 1/2 tbsp dried herbs was a little heavy and dried basil gets overpowering, in my opinion.  Also, i was in a hurry, so i didn't blend it, i just whipped it in a bowl and then put it in a ziploc with the steak.  I massaged the steak and flipped the bag over every 20-30 minutes and everyone said it turned out great.  I'll definitely make this again!

I marinated boneless ribeye steaks overnight (16 hours). We grilled the steaks and my entire family loved the flavor. I'm glad I blended the ingredients (I used my Magic Bullet) because it kept the ingredients from "separating".  This marinade is definitely a keeper!

This marinade is chow!! I didn't add the optional ingredients and was only able to marinate for about 4 hours but it was still so delicious!!! Going to be using this one again, maybe I'll try the "optionals" next time around. Thanks!!!!

By far the best steak marinade I've found yet.  Followed the recipe to a tee, even though some reviewers thought there was too much lemon. It is tasty, yet doesn't over power the flavor of the meat.  No changes needed here!! Thanks Kookie, an awesome recipe.

I thought this was okay, not anything spectacular.  I followed the recipe exactly and let 2 thinner steaks marinate in it overnight as well as the next day.  (I flipped the steaks in the morning).

Great recipe.  Only marinaded for about 3 hours but steaks were tender and very tasty.  Was initially put off by the color (combo of green olive oil and blended spices) but after tasting them I'm a believer.

Calling it the "best steak marinade in existence" is a little far fetched...it was good but not great.  I ended up eating the steak with A1 sauce and that made it better.  I followed the recipe exactly minus the optional ingredients and I marinated for about 24 hours.

This is dee-lish.  I used fresh garlic and parsley and added a wee bit of brown sugar just to mellow out some of the tang.  So good.

This is great! It turns any steak, no matter the quality of the cut, delicious! The first time I marinated about 6 hours(still great) and this time it was almost 24 hours mmm.  Amazing! And the boyfriend loves it too.

Very good. I didn't have parsley, so I put a little sage in. Very flavorful. I LOVE A-1 with my steaks, and I almost (almost) didn't use any because it was so good on it's own

This was good and did bring out the flavor of the steak. I wouldn't call it the best in the world, though.

Wow, this marinade was really good!  Like another reviewer suggested, I poured the leftover marinade in a pan, added mushrooms, cooked until most of the liquid was gone (making sure to cook at a higher temp to get rid of bacteria!!), and served the mushrooms atop the steak.  The mushrooms were to die for!  I might keep a batch of marinade on hand just as a sauce for sautéing the mushrooms in!  The steak was good too, of course. :)  I broiled the steaks and accidentally cooked them a bit too long, but the marinade was tasty!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe actually caused me to start eating red meat again; I didn't know it could taste this good! I love, love, LOVE this marinade. I mainly follow the recipe, though I use fresh garlic (to taste) and fresh basil, and I leave out the hot sauce. I let the meat marinate for at least a day; three days if I have the time. I find this is great to prepare on the weekend and let marinate, and then cook up during the week when I want an quick but tasty dinner.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

My whole family loved this marinade! I would suggest cooking it on a charcoal grill...the smokey flavor went awesome with the steak. I didn't have lemon juice so I omitted it(but it was still great), I didn't have dried parsley so I used about 1/4 C fresh, I was hesitant of all the basil so I only used 2 1/2 T and I did add the garlic. But like I said it was still great and I can't wait to try it with the lemon juice.

I did not have all the ingredients-had to use Italian spices instead of the basil.  It overpowered the steak.

Don't change a thing in this recipe, it is the best steak marinade ever! I made a steak sauce to go with it but after taking the first bite I knew the steak sauce would not be used. This marinade gives the meat so much flavor it is amazing!

I used minced garlic only and black pepper instead of white.  (i didn't have any on hand)  Next time I'll probably do more Worcestershire sauce and a little less Soy.  Great marinade as is, my changes are just my preferences.

This was OK, but WAY too heavy on the basil.  I'd cut back on that if I make it again.

This really is the best. I didn't use a blender, I just whisked it and that seemed to be just fine. We had this for fathers day, and it was truly a treat. It'll be put into my personal recipe box to use again and again. The flavour is VERY tasty. Thank you for posting this recipe. :)

Already used it twice (in one week) at boyfriend's insistence. He had to remind me several times to slow down when I was eating! Steak was tender and juicy. Keeper recipe.

Excellent!  Left out the optional ingredients and made speidies.  It rivals Salamida's State Fair Speidie Sauce!

I cut the recipe back a bit, since i was only marinating one rather large chunk of steak. I used real minced garlic instead of dried, and added a 1/2 cup of Merlot. Whisked it all together in a bowl and poured over steak in gallon-freezer bag, marinated 1 1/2 days. Cooked in the oven. I never got to taste it, but my son ate the entire piece of meat (enough for 3 people). He literally couldn't stop going back for more!  Next time I will get to try it too. No need to look any further for a marinade recipe this is it!!   Thanks SO much for this great recipe.

This is very very good. I did use a little less olive oil, though. And I tried what another reviewer suggested - boiling it after marinating and adding mushrooms to serve as a gravy/sauce. Once it boiled down a little, it was VERY salty!! So if you decide to make it into a gravy, be sure to add some water to it.

WOW.  So incredibly good.  I did add 4TB brown sugar and a few pinches of onion powder.  My boyfriend could not stop eating it.  We did a 2+ pound tri tip with it and marinated overnite.

A very powerful marinade. Doesn't really need the extra garlic or hot sauce (really depends on your taste preference). I'll use this again, but probably marinate for less time (I left the steaks in the fridge for 6 hours, and it was quite an overpowering taste).

I used this to marinate some steak for 48 hrs and made kabobs!!! I did use a Teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce. They were a hit, the meat practically melted on my tongue. I will be keeping this family secret a regular favorite of mine!

Not just for steaks!! It was teriffic on salmon filets, a really distinctive change to the usual seafood preparations. My husband and I both wished  I had fixed larger portions. I made two small changes as per other suggestions with a little brown sugar and used only fresh minced garlic. I marinated the filets overnight and baked the fish for 25 min at 350. I basted the salmon once or twice with the remaining marinade but I just like to futz, it probably wasn't necessary. A most excellent marinade .... our new favorite.

Absolutely DEEEELICIOUS.  I didn't use the lemon and added some dry mustard.  I grilled it with wonderful rib-eyes.  OMG, it was Heaven on Earth.  I normally smother my steak in A-1 Sauce no matter how good the cut of steak is or what resturaunt we go to.  I loved this marinade better than A-1.    I can't rave enough about how delicious this was.  My husband said it is wonderful too!

Oh,I liked it but I wouldn't call it,the 'Best',I was told it needed more liquid and I'll admit I didn't put lemon in. But the herbs were a bit overwhelming.

I wouldn't change a thing, it's amazing!  Also, you can cook the leftover marinade for a slightly sweet sauce (it caramelizes nicely over low heat)

Excellent marinade! Only change was to use black vs. white pepper as that's what I had on hand.  I marinated cubed beef and veggies all day and grilled up kebabs on the grill.  Really well blended flavors-- Brought out the best of the meat and veggies! Mmmmmmm!!

This is wonderful!  I did not put it in a blender - like another reviewer, I just put it all in a ziploc and let it blend and marinate.  I used minced garlic from a jar instead of the minced dried garlic, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Just wonderful - I will use this many times - thank you for the recipe!

One of the best steak marinades I’ve ever tried.  Followed the ingredients except for the hot spices; did however, use 2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard.  Poured the mixture on frozen top sirloin and let thaw. Our guest could not say enough, the ultimate compliment.

Being that I am a vegetarian, this rating comes from my fiance. He loved the steak I made for him. I made it for him on his birthday. This was the first steak that I have ever made and he said it was terrific! I made him swear that he was not just trying to make me feel good. =)

Only made a couple of changes: used low sodium soy sauce and not quite as much garlic, fresh lime juice, and fresh basil.  Marinated in plastic bags 5 extremely thick rib eyes and t bones for 12 hrs. The flavor was just ok, kind of bland, not sure why it didn't have the kick I was looking for..

Followed the recipe exactly, and even marinated the steaks for about two days, but I was not thrilled by this marinade.  If I were to ever try it again, I would definitely cut the herbs in half.

Had friends over and cooked T-bone steaks.  Marinaded for 6 hours, did not blend.  Everyone raved. I used low sodium soy, this was great.

I poked the steak and then placed it in a baggy with all the ingredients and let it sit for 5 hours prior to grilling.    It was excellent!  I did add a little more lemon that it called for.

This truly was delicious!  I marinated some Bison steaks for2 days in this and they turned out fantastic.  Straight into my Recipe box!  I used fresh crushed garlic instead of powder and the taste was awesome. Thanks Much

This marinade is definitely one of the best.  I made it for my husband for Valentine's Day and he loved it.  He told me to save the recipe for another occasion.

Awesome! But I replaced the garlic powder and dried minced garlic with about 2 tablespoons of jarred minced garlic. Also, be careful if you have a big flame because it may catch on the herbs (despite them sitting in marinade for 24 hours).

I made this last night and used my food saver to marinate it. If I had more time time I would definitely have marinated it longer. The combination of herbs and spices were great! Great last minute, pull from the cupboard recipe.

I made this recipe one night when I didn't have any steaks in the house.  I used it to marinade some pork chops instead.  This stuff is so good, my kids thought they were eating steak!!!!  It really gives your steaks a 'steak house' flavor!

This is excellent. The whole family LOVED it, even the picky 21 year old who puts ketchup on everything ... didn't wven go for the ketchup.  I think the blending is a good idea because of all the dry ingredients, just a thought.

This marinade wasn't bad, but it just wasn't the "best steak marinade in existence". I followed the recipe exactly as written and used it to marinate a top sirloin steak that I grilled. Sorry to say, this recipe probably won't be a repeat at our house.

This is the BEST steak marinade I have ever had. The longer you marinade it the better. Overnight is the best. I used fresh garlic but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

This is the best.  I lost track of how many times I used this recipe and have tried on all cuts of beef - Even tenderizes London Broil.  I ususally marinate 1-2 days ahead and either grill or broil.

Absolutely fantastic!  I used the lemon juice in the little lemon plastic bottle, since I didn't have any fresh lemons on hand, and I ran out of basil. I only had time to marinade for about 3 hours - still came out great! My husband was raving about this steak!  Thank you!

I marinated a couple of sirloin steaks (I did not blend the ingredients - I just mixed them together).  Very flavorful, especially because I was only able to marinate for about one hour.  I think I will try this with flank steak and marinate for longer.  Also, I think I will add the optional ingredients next time - I think that will add some good flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was great. I did blend it, but I don't really see why you have to. I was a little hesitant about adding the hot sauce because I don't like my food to be even a little spicy, but I added it because my husband likes hot sauce. You couldn't really taste it, so I'm not sure whether it would be any different without it. I let the steaks marinade for about 24 hours and they were excellent. I'll definitely use this again. *Update* This is now the only marinade I will use for steak. Even my husband, who isn't big on using recipes, asks that I use this one specifically. :)

This is a fantastic marinade! I meant to marinate for 24 hrs but my ribeye and new york strip ended up in the marinade for almost 48. After mesquite-charcoal grilling them to medium-well...even my wife was speechless.

I wholeheartedly agree with the title of this recipe.  The steaks I grilled after using this marinade were the best I have ever made. I, too, just mixed the ingredients in a bowl instead of putting them in the blender.  Absolutely delicious!

This was sooo good. I'm not much of a steak consumer, but this brought me back for seconds! I used fresh parsley and skipped the hot sauce, but otherwise stayed true to the recipe.

I really liked this, I felt like it gave the meat such a pop of flavor in your mouth. But my husband wasn't so impressed.

This is WICKED.  With three kids under age 6, and a husband with a very healthy appetite, I'm always looking for taste that appeals to my whole family. I work full-time, so I made the marinade the night before and let it soak 18 hours in a ziplock bag and then threw it on the BBQ right when I got home, sevred with fettucini in cream sauce and some green beans. There were no leftovers! DO blend the mixture: the liquids need it. I will be making this again FOR SURE.

As suggested by others, I used minced garlic rather than the garlic powder.  The touch of hot sauce was a nice addition. Thanks for sharing.

I treated my husband to a top-quality Ribeye and marinaded it using this recipe.  I didn't change anything and he said it was to die for!  I let the steak sit in the marinade for two days...delicious!  Thanks, thanks, thanks!!!!

I did not have any lemon juice, so I used 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar instead. I know this is a little different flavor than as written, but was quite excellent! I marinated 1" thick New York strip steaks overnight and grilled  over charcoal. They came out tender, juicy, and the charred crunchies outside were delicious.

This is the best steak marinade ever!! It so easy and all the ingredents are staples in the house. Not a fan of hot pepper so I left that out. I'll never buy a already made marinade again!

Have made this twice now, did not puree the ingredients the first time.  I think it does make a difference to take the time to do it.  Marinade comes out thicker and adheres to the meat better.  Steaks came out flavorful and the marinade is not overpowering.  I used filet mignon for this recipe.

I used these ingrediants on moose steaks. I didn't really measure the ingrediants, just, put them all in a lg bag, rub the meat with the marinade and refridgerated overnight. Best in existance? Not so sure...but, pretty good all the same! Thanks!

Was quick and easy. I just used the listed ingredients and just eyed the measurements. I did add Steak Spice by Herbs & Spices-Spice Bouquet That I purchased at a discount grocery store. Tasted Great! Will use again!

Wow! This marinade lives up to its name! I was afraid all the flavors would overwhelm the taste of the steak, but after marinating my ribeyes for about 2 1/2 hours, they had the perfect flavor. Even my mom, who's had her own favorite marinade recipe for years, insisted that I give her the recipe for this one! This is a keeper.
