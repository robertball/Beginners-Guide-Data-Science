This recipes is terrific.  I made a few personal variations by using artichoke hearts instead of the mushrooms and actually splitting the recipe in half to reduce the quantity.
I will definitely make for some Christmas give-aways
Really good!!!!

This is a wonderful recipe! I changed up some of the veggies, adding carrots and dropping the broccoli, adding both yellow and green beans and only using green and red bell peppers. As long as you keep the proportions the same, you can suit it to what you like and it is amazing every time! My extra garden veggies are finding their way into every new batch. Next time I'm adding eggplant.

It was OK, but have tried other recipes that my family enjoys more.  Wonâ€™t make again.

Delicious!! I had to adapt the veggies to what I had on hand -leaving out the green beans and mushrooms and I added a few jalapenos-but I followed the method. Having read the description about subbing out the ketchup, I chose to use Sriracha instead! I think next time I'll roast the tomatoes for a more rustic flavour. Thank you for the recipe.
