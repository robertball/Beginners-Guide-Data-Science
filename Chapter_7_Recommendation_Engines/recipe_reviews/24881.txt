Made this for a picnic at the last minute and it turned out great.  I doubled the recipe but next time I will not add any more garlic.  On a hot summer day this is the perfect summer salad  (it's still warm here in Naples, IT).  The dish was liked by adults and children alike just the way the recipe was written.

I thought this was very good. I eliminated the sugar and oil and added a little salt. Very refreshing with garden fresh tomatoes and basil! I am making it again today and might add some chopped mozzerella.

Made this for Recipe Group:  23, July 2011  I made this as written with the exception of peeling and seeding the tomatoes.  I just put all the ingredients in the Magic Bullet and blended.  The tomato mixture had good taste, but think we would have enjoyed it more if it would have been heated.  The directions weren't clear as to what to do with the pasta.  Are you suppose to serve cold sauce over warm noodles?  I will try this again with all the fresh tomatoes coming on - but next time I will warm the sauce and pour it over warm noodles.

I made this for recipe group and the first thing I want to say about it is that the directions aren't that clear. If the spaghetti is supposed to be cold, shouldn't you rinse it like you do when making a cold pasta salad? Well, that's what I did and then refrigerated it for a couple of hours before eating. When I ate it, I inhaled it. It was good, but you really have to like the ingredients. I don't think it would be universally appealing. With that being said, I'm glad I made it, tried it, & of course ate it. However, I'm not sure I would again unless someone gave me free garden tomatoes. Tomatoes are almost $3 a pound and the peeling and seeding was pretty time consuming & messy.

I liked this. I halved the recipe since it was only me eating it. I had some garden ripe tomatoes that were getting mushy. I didn't even bother peeling & seeding, just threw them in the blender. I did get out a bit of the water when I cored the top part out. I left out the sugar. I had WW pasta already in the fridge from the night before.  I also used a splash of Lemon Olive Oil that a friend gave me. Gave it a nice fresh twist. It was a great, easy healthy lunch.
