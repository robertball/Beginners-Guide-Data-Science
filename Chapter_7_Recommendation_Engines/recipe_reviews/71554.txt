I made a lot of changes to this and the resulting recipe was really tasty.  Firstly, I fried some onion in olive oil.  When the onion was softened, I added 2 minced garlic cloves and cooked that for about a minute while stirring.  Then I added the chicken seasoned with salt and pepper, cooked for 5 minutes, then flipped the chicken and added two thinly sliced apples, 1 tsp crushed dried rosemary, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, and some apple juice in which to braise the chicken.  I covered this and let it simmer over low heat for 20 minutes.  When it was finished, the apples and onion had softened together and I had a really nice thick sauce on top.  This was great served over rice!  With my modifications I'd give this recipe 5 stars, but I would find it too bland and dry without the onions and apple juice.  Thanks for the great starter recipe!

Excellent taste - exactly what I was looking for.  I did not have pumpkin pie spice, so I replaced with cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg.

This was a very good recipe however the spices were very overwhelming.  I would cut back the pumpkin pie spice and tarragon by half, the pepper to 1/4 tsp, and the garlic salt to 1 tsp.

I'd never had an apple/chicken combination before so without having anything to compare it to this wasn't bad. I used 4 chicken breasts and 2 apples. The apples ended up turning to mush, will using baking apples next time. Also cut way down on the garlic salt as suggested. I added about 1 1/2 cups of apple juice to keep it from drying out. Not bad at all, will try again for sure.

I was feeling a bit iffy about this one, but was too intrigued not to try it.  I'm so glad I did!  The spices are strong, but I loved it!  I followed other's suggestions and toned down the garlic a little.  This is a great recipe though, with very interesting flavors!

I thought this was great. I didn't have tarragon but it was great without it (not sure what the taste difference would be with it, but I'll probably try it with it next time). I did add garlic powder and the salt separately to limit the salt and it came out perfect.

I should have read the reviews also before preparing it the first time - way too much garlic salt!  The second time it got rave reviews from all the teens eating over - modified to 2 tsp garlic salt and 1/2 tablespoon black pepper.  Very simple and smells great!!

With a few changes this is an AWESOME recipe. My husband was crazy about it. I sauteed an onion in the oil before I added the chicken, used garlic powder instead of salt, about 3/4 t. cinnamon and a tiny bit of nutmeg. I also used two apples. Then, after the chicken cooked for about 5 minutes, I added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of apple cider. I served it with a really yummy whole grain brown rice and green beans. It was scrumptious. I can't wait to make it again!

Woweeeeeee, that was a LOT of salt and pepper!  I liked the way the chicken and apples looked together before I added anything else.  I'll definitely try this again because I think it's a great idea, but next time, I'll just use a dash of everthing instead of the measurements given.

This was OK.  I liked the first few bites but then couldn't even think about it the next day.  I think I'm just not a fan of tarragon and even though I cut back on the garlic salt, it was still way too salty.  I would put in 1/2 tbsp. next time.

I should have read the review first.  Way too much Garlic salt.  It would be good I think if you reduce the salt.

As is I thought this was very bland.....so I added carmelized onions in brown sugar and mixed that in with the chicken and it really made a difference. I served it with buttered rice and hubby devoured it...by the way I also added butter to the olive oil when making this and it made a huge difference in taste. Thank you.

I followed everything reviewer "icookstuff" said and it turned out very nicely. I also added 2 tbl of brown sugar to make it a little bit sweeter. I didn't have rosemary so I used thyme instead, and it worked just fine. I put some crushed pecans on top, and it was great.

This was an excellent combination of ingredients, however a few adjustments are necessary! add another apple, cut the garlic salt to 1 t, cut black pepper to 1/4 t.  Follow the recipe as is and then add about 1/4-1/3 cup of apple juice, cover and simmer for about 15-20 minutes.  Serve over whole grain jasmine rice.  Absolutely delicious!

Interesting blend of spices but entirely too much garlic salt. I added water - didn't have apple juice - or it would have been very dry also.  Might try minced garlic cloves while browning the chicken and a teaspoon of salt with apple juice.  Spicy good - salty bad!

This was pretty easy to make! It gave me a reason to use my vegeable-slicer attachment on my kitchen aid - so easy!.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I substituted cinnamon. I also added some curry powder. Served with extra wide egg noodles. I loved it!

I didn't like this at all!  The chick was very dry and I even added some broth to it.  It didn't have a very good flavor either.  Won't be making again.

I liked this a lot but my husband thought it was bland. We used suggestions to add onion, garlic & apple juice.  I think it was the apple juice that he didn't care for. We want to try this again with chicken broth. We did serve it over rice and we liked the broth the juice made to have over rice. I used the seasonings according to the recipe except not as much pepper.

Duplicated pumpkin pie spice with 1/2 teas cinnamon, 1/4 teas nutmeg, and 1/4 teas ginger, and that gave it a bit more bite than I would prefer.  Next time, I think I'll use just a pinch of each.  But that was due to my own changes - the recipe itself was delicious.

Overall I thought this was pretty good. We served with rice and green beans. I had no trouble with it drying out as mentioned is some reviews. I ended up using only about 1/2 of the mixed spices and thought the pepper was overwhelming. Next time, I will cut the pepper to a tsp.

This was a good recipe I liked it a lot but I made a few changes. I put two apples in the mix and I used fresh tarragon instead of dried. I also thought there was a little bit too much pepper but my family liked the pepper so i guess its just opinion!

Mmm not bad. i do a similar recipe, but i usually cook the chicken and apples seperate at first, get the chicken almost all the way done, then add it in with the apples ive already been slow cooking in a skillet. i also stagger the apples that i put in(so some are more tender, and others crisper. i like the variance in texture, but the similar taste) i also do a quick cook on onions and coat the whole combined mess with some red wine. for seasonings obviously salt and a little of whatever else you like.

Lacking a little something; needs some tweaking.  As a starter recipe, this was great.  I never imagined that pumpkin spice would be good on chicken, but it truly was!  I didn't use tarragon because my husband dispises it, and it came out fine.  I didn't use the garlic sailt - like most of the reviewers on here - but rather used about 1 1/2 tsp garlic powder instead.  I sprinkled it with a little sugar (about 1 tsp).  I also added sauteed onions and dried currants.  Otherwise, I sort of felt as though it was sauteed apple pie filling with chicken...will do again!  And SUPER easy and fast, which I like.

I wasn't really sure what to expect, but it was a good experiment. I thought it tasted like applesauce flavored chicken. I like those items separately but mixed was 'meh'.
Made it as listed except for cutting back on the salt some. Probably won't try this again unless someone that's a better cook than me does it. Maybe it was my lack of skills that wrecked it?

We loved this recipe as is. Will be getting a covered skillet or wok and add garlic with chicken broth, love chicken cooked well, needing to cut the salt for health reasons as well.

I tried this today. I made some modifications and added garlic salt to taste (as per others advice/comments). I also substituted parsley for the tarragon. I may have added the spices too early because I was concerned about the chicken's flavor. I think that adding the spices before the apples was a mistake. I may try again to see if there is a difference. I really liked the pumpkin pie spice in the flavor. Gave the chicken a little something different.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe, and my 5-year-old couldn't get enough.  I did use only 2 tsp garlic salt and 1/2 Tbsp pepper, but other that, I followed the directions completely.  My husband even asked me to make this chicken for dinner again tomorrow night!

I used two cloves of garlic instead of the garlic salt, and used three chicken breasts and two apples, because that's what I needed to feed the family. We all thought it was delicious. I served it with baked sweet potatoes, and kept thinking that I could probably have done everything together in the oven. It's a really nice blend of flavors. Next time I might try caramelizing the apples in butter instead of using the olive oil, but this was really very, very good as is.

Spices were definitely overwhelming. The apples with the chicken was a nice refreshing change from the norm. We liked it but I would definitely follow the advice of many reviewers and tone down the spices next time.

Made this recipe as an alternate side dish for Christmas. Great taste!
Hints:  golden delicious apples are best, use garlic powder and salt separated, cinnamon, paprika and brownsugar worked just as well.  I set this dish over saffron rice...my mouth was delighted! A great "something different" dish if you're looking for one.

This came at the right time as we were low on groceries but had apples and chicken.  I would definitely cut the garlic and black pepper back to half if not a little more.  I use 3-4 chicken breasts and 4+ small apples or 3 of the big ones.  It's been such a hit I make it on a regular basis now.  Thanks!

I thought this  was very good. It had a bit to much black pepper. I didn't have garlic salt so I just used garlic. Husband and I thought that it was very tasty.

Had a good taste, but the chicken was a bit on the dry side. I used garlic powder, rather than the salt.

I think the recipe was a good started, but needed and still needs some more tweaking for me. I doubled the apple for three breasts, added some onions and used minced garlic instead of salt. I think it needs a little zip as well as perhaps a veggie or something in it.

We enjoyed this!  My husband and son were wary, but said they'd like to have it again! I doubled the chicken and apple and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  It was seasoned well and easy to make.

This has good flavor, but too much of it! Either cut the amount of spices in half or double the chicken.

I thought that this was delicious.  My husand and picky daughter also liked it too.  Major pluses:  something different, easy and fast to make with ingredients on hand.  I did not use the tarragon since I don't have any.  Also, I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt (half portion).  Thanks.

This was pretty good.  Lots of spices which I like.  About the garlic salt, I personally never cook with it.  I use either garlic powder or fresh, and then salt the food to my taste.  If the recipe calls for a large amount of garlic salt the amount of powder used might need to be adjusted to compensate for the missing salt. Enjoy

So, I'm a student in the fine art of improvisational cooking: I had no tarragon, no pumpkin spice, canola instead of olive oil, and thighs instead of breasts. So I used four thighs, two semi-small apples (that I didn't peel, but will next time), the garlic salt and black pepper, and added in cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg, allspice, and parsley. It turned out quite tasty, and gave me enough for three meals. I would call this a success.

One of these days I may make it strictly according to instructions. :)
