This cheesecake was fantastic! One thing I would change though next time is that I would heat up the jam before I tried putting it into the cheesecake. Swirling globs of jam didn't work so well so instead of a marble affect, there were just random patches of strawberry inside. This cake turned out HUGE and was just as big of a hit with everyone!

This makes the best cheesecake ever! You don't even have to add the strawberry to it.  I switch it up and use this same recipe for all different kinds of cheesecakes. I also always have trouble getting it to cook like I want it because it makes so much so I halve the recipe with a full crust and bake it 38-40 minutes in a 9 inch spring form pan and it comes out perfect everytime!!

Thank You for a great recipe! My son wanted Strawberry cheesecake for his birthday and they are expensive to buy, so I thought I would try. (I never made cheesecake before) But every one said it was the best cheesckae they ever ate. Thanks for the tip about warming the jam, that was a good idea.

Wish I had read the reviews before putting the jam on top!! It was thick so I warmed some more and it swirled beautifully!!! After it was cool I placed a container full of thawed frozen strawberries on top. Yum yum!! I will  make this again!

5 stars for how easy this is and the end result is tasty.  I had to make an easy to transport and easy to serve cheesecake.  This fit the need perfectly.  The swirls bump this basic  9x13 size cake up to the 5 stars.  It's a nice presentation for a cake pan cheesecake.  And, again, tasty.  I prefer my cheesecakes baked in a springform pan and I have a go-to recipe that rocks.  This recipe is great for potluck luncheon....and kind-of rocks too!  :)

I like that this is made in a 9"x13" baking dish.  This was easy to make and turned out perfect.  It was delicious, too.

recipe was really good, with a soft set center. Made homemade strawberry jam and the family really liked. I would have liked it to be a little denser but as is was really nice.

I just wanted to add, when you drop on the fruit definitely warm it up and drop small drops over the cheesecake. If you put them in a row and run a knife straight down the row it will make little hearts. Or you can swirl, either way is pretty. I put a bowl of boiling water in the oven like I do when I cook any cheesecake and I didn’t have any cracks. I used a jelly roll pan and 2 packs of graham crackers for the crust and it worked perfectly. It only needed about 30 mins to cook since it was a little thinner from the larger pan.

I have made a lot of cheesecakes in the past, and this one was great! I made a double batch (which was absolutely crazy, considering the fact that I dumped 10 packages of cream cheese and 8 eggs into a bowl along with a myriad of other ingredients, and somehow it turned out just as smooth as I had envisioned), and even when I doubled it this recipe only took about 45 minutes to prepare the whole thing! I have yet to taste it, as it is currently cooking and it is for a party tomorrow, but it is looking good and the jam swirled into it quite well. It's absolutely fantastic that it is made in a 9x13, especially for parties, because it makes so much and is easy to serve. Overall, it is a good cheesecake and I would recommend it.

It is now the next day, and I can honestly say that I love the taste of this cheesecake!

This is a wonderfully easy recipe. I made a couple of changes.  For the crust I added approximately a half cup of chopped pecans and  half teaspoon of cinnamon before baking.  My husband requested blueberry so I added a couple of tablespoons of lemon juice to the cheesecake batter and swirled approximately two tablespoons of blueberry preserves into the top before baking. My family loved it!

Still in the oven but looks and tastes fantastic.  Recipe says use a 9 x 13 pan even though picture is not from that type of pan.  Glad I did, this is a large recipe which would not have fit any of my spring form pans.

Wow what a great recipe. Absolutely loved it. 
Followed recipe exactly as written except I halved  the recipe (there is only 2 of us) and took another reviewers advice and warmed up the jam first. This will for sure be one I’ll make all the time.  Also reading threw all of the other reviewers I put a bowl of water when I cooked it and it worked, no cracks.!!!

Delicious and easy cheesecake recipe. I like a thicker crust so next time I make it I will double the graham cracker crust. 40 minutes is the perfect cooking time even though it still jiggles in the center. Baking it longer would make the center dry. As it cools it sets up beautifully.

Best cheesecake I have ever tasted!  I made my own strawberry topping,  however. This is the only recipe I use now when making any flavour cheesecake!  I have a bakeapple (cloudberry to most of you guys) one on the go now!

Seriously good and easy.  I may have left it in the oven 5 minutes too long but it was still very good.  Used homemade raspberry jam.  Will make again.  Will work well for family get togethers since the recipe is large.
