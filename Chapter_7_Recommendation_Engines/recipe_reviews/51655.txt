I roasted the peeled cut up carrots with a little olive oil and a few peeled garlic cloves in a 450 degree oven for about 25 minutes, instead of boiling them.  Make sure to puree the roasted garlic cloves with the rest of the soup.  I used whole milk.  The soup is better the next day after the flavors have intensified!

Outstanding! I used garlic powder, water (instead of chicken stock) and whole milk. I also had to use dried herbs but even so the flavour of this soup was fantastic, and it's texture... velvety! This tastes wonderful with warm garlic bread.

Not bad, but a bit bland until I doctored it up.  I used a lot more dill (probably twice what the recipee called for) and you must add salt and pepper to balance the flavors before serving.  I also stirred in a couple tbsp. butter for richness.  Garnished with toasted sliced almonds, it was company-worthy.

I looked for this recipe after we enjoyed the Dill Carrot Soup at the Union Station Museum Restaurant in Ogden, Utah.  I used baby carrots, and let my dried dill weed and fresh chives soak in the milk while the carrots, onion, and garlic simmered in the broth.  We rate this even better than the restaurant's version!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  We are soup lovers and always trying something new.  I used PAM instead of the oil, due to our diet, and added some pepper and a little salt, not much, at the table.  It is a keeper for us.  Thanks:)

WoW - so, so good!  Totally surprised!  I couldn't stand to lose all those nutrients from the boiled carrots, so I made a standard soup base by sauteeing the onions and carrots for about 8 minutes, then added the garlic, then sauteed for another 3 or so and added the chicken stock.  Boiled for about 15 minutes until carrots were quite tender.  Pureed as indicated, and honestly at this point with a tad more liquid this is an awesome soup on it's own!  I did add extra chicken stock vs milk, and then the herbs - fantastic!  Thank you for sharing this surprisingly wonderful recipe!

Great idea for a soup - I really like carrots with dill.  It did need a little tweaking though, as I found it somewhat bland as well.  I added salt, pepper, an extra tablespoon of dill, more onion, and used green onions instead of chives.  Overall a very yummy soup, and coming in at only 80 calories per 1 cup serving! (I used skim milk)  I'll make this again.

Perhaps it was my method, but I think I followed the recipe exactly... this tasted like baby food mixed with dill and milk.  I couldn't serve it.

This was great! Fresh dill and chives are a must.  I used skim milk and a little cream since I didn't have 2% milk.  We had it with turkey burgers, wonderful.

Quite a few reviews mentioned very bland, think because there is no mention of S&P in the recipe.  I added salt to the water I boiled the carrots in.  Put a little salt & pepper in the onion and garlic.  Other then that followed the recipe (except had to use dried dill) and I thought the flavor was excellent.  I will make again without chives.  I love chives, but the texture was weird to me.

This was delicious and easy. I cut out the first step and cooked everything together in one pot. First I sauted the onions and garlic and then added the carrots and broth and simmered until done. Then followed the rest of the recipe.

Delicious! I altered this slightly. Instead of 3/4 cup milk, I used 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 cup half and half. I also added some kosher salt when I sauteed the onions and garlic. At the end, I used 1/2 teaspoon dried dill, as I did not have fresh and I added cayenne pepper to taste. I couldn't stop eating it! yumm.

Great soup!  I left out the milk and added more broth.  I also threw in a handful of quinoa during the simmer stage to give the soup "body."  A big hit with the whole family.

This soup is awesome!  I made some changes to this recipe.  I used 3/4 cup whipping cream instead of the milk.  I used dried dill and dried chives.  I used 4 cups chicken stock.  I sauteed the onions and garlic in butter and then transferred this to a stock pot, along with the rest of the ingredients and cooked on low for 5 hours.  Afterward, I pureed the ingredients in a blender and added salt and pepper to taste.  The results were out of this world!  Top it off with some Fresh Gourmet tortilla strips Santa Fe style and it tastes incredible!!

Delicious! I mostly followed the recipe except I sauted the carrots, onions, and garlic together ...I don't know if it made any difference in the flavor over cooking the carrots in water first.  I also used dried dill and chives and added some salt and pepper. This is certainly one soup I'll make again.

This is a really good recipe.  I recently had leftover carrots from a corned beef and cabbage dinner that I served to 286 people.  I normally discard the extra 4 or 5 pounds of cooked carrots left over but decided to try something new to use them this time...  I ran across this recipe and tried it.  I don’t think I would normally be a fan of cooked, pureed carrots but this recipe surprised me.  It was excellent with subtle flavors and not too sweet.  I modified it a bit by adding 3 stalks of celery and 1 heaping teaspoon of dried dill weed rather than the Tablespoon of fresh dill.  I also ended up using 5 cups of chicken stock rather than 3 ½.  Try it.  You’ll like it!

Yep! This is a great recipe. Super easy.

NOTES: 
- Doesn't make a lot. Small 4 bowls? (REEEEALLY small bowls!) 
My carrots & stock reduced a lot during the simmer process, so I ended up adding in about 1/2 cup more liquid (stock). 
- Will definitely, double, if not triple next batch to get more out of it. 
- Used Skim milk, and it was still thick when I blended with an immersion blender. 
- To create a smooth, creamy texture siphon through cheese cloth.
- Added a good 'handful' of fresh dill for a fresh, stronger taste.  
- Use vegetable stock instead of chicken for a vegan alternative.

This was a great way to use up some dill! Used vegetable bouillon instead of chicken stock, green onion instead of chives, and skim instead of 2% milk.

Have now made this soup several times, with and without chives, with half&half, heavy cream, skim milk, easy to substitute. It always turns out absolutely delicious and very flavorful. A staple at our table!

I tried this recipe because I got an immersion blender for Christmas and I was really excited to give it a go. I added a little more garlic and an extra can of vegetable stock. The soup turned out great.

Good basic recipe. I took a few other reviewers suggestions and: roasted the veggies on the grill (added in two small orange peppers since I had them on hand), used veggie broth and almond milk to make it vegan, and used at least double the fresh dill. It was fine but a little bland, so I added salt to taste and a few squirts of fresh lemon juice (about a tablespoon). The lemon juice really brought out the flavors.

I nearly doubled the garlic and dill. I used 3.25% milk instead of 22% and plopped butter into each dish....mmm... Yummy leftovers, too!

edit: i made this again and it was totally bland. added tons of salt. going to add dried dill with each leftover bowl.

Added ginger , celery, fresh dill(not dill weed), and half a green cabbage. Used more carrots, and more chicken stock so no soup to make tomorrow ! Delicious, sweet, healthy soup, even with butter which added a nice creamy texture, low cal substitute milk maybe next time.

Made this as a soup course for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it. Dill and chives complement the carrots well.  Need to add salt and pepper - personal prefernce - otherwise perfect as is.  Thanks very much for sharing!

This soup is amazing!  I pretty much followed the recipe with these few exception:  I boiled celery leaves with the carrots.  When sauting the onion and garlic, I added pepper, sea salt and 1 tsp of dill at that time.  I did not use chives.  I'm excited to share this recipe with my family!!

Made this last night for dinner, and had it for lunch today!  Yummy recipe that would have gotten 5 stars, except that after I made it following the recipe exaclty, I had to make some slight modifications.  I added about a tablespoon of brown sugar, and I added salt and pepper as well because it was lacking flavor.  Very good!

Instead of dill and chives, I added a bit of sliced up fresh ginger root and about 2 tbsp of red curry paste. (I found another carrot soup recipe on another site and kind of married the two together.) It's got quite a kick to it.

This soup was great! I LOVED it and I am not a huge carrot person. I had a bag of carrots and was not sure what to do with it and so I thought I would try a soup and now I will be making this A LOT! The flavor was great! Thank you for a wonderful recipe. I did not change a thing!

This was good. My carrots didn't really puree, they were still tiny pieces; but I simplified and just "pureed" the carrots, not the entire soup. I substituted soy milk for the milk.  The serving sizes are not large servings.

Watch out for the salt content in this soup!  If the butter and stock that you used have salt you probably will not need to add any... unlike I did!  Also, parsely and mint are good together in this recipe if you are out of dill.

After reading other ratings I roasted carrots, garlic, and onion for 1 hour or so, used chicken broth made from roasted chicken, added salt, pepper and results were excellent.

I like to use coconut milk instead of milk to make this a perfect paleo soup.
I start with a bag of precut mini carrots to keep it simple (the bags are measured by the pound as well).
Definitely add a healthy amount of salt and pepper while simmering or risk blandness.
Make sure to cool after simmering, before you blend or else it might explode as the heat expands!!! This happened to me once when I used my nutribullet and I spent the night cleaning my kitchen instead of eating delicious soup!
I also purée the dill with the carrot mix so that the flavor is mixed in and you don't get the little shrubbery while eating it. 
Enjoy!!

I made this soup, but I added an avocado to make it creamy and used almond milk instead of regular milk (I'm dairy free).  It was delicious!  I used a previous reviewers advice and roasted the carrots and garlic instead of boiling.  It gave it a great flavor.  Definitely will make this again!

Great taste, creamy texture & very aromatic.  I used non-fat half & half instead of milk.  Don't add extra dill as some suggest until you taste it first - I failed to do that & added an extra Tbs of dill & it overwhelmed the soup.  I added another pound of roasted carrots & it was very good.  My dumb mistake

Not a bad overall taste, certainly not completely bland as comments suggest. I used whatever stock I had on hand (I think it was vegetable stock) and used garlic paste with the onion then a bit more garlic powder when I put it on to simmer along with salt. I also added slightly more fresh dill than the recipe called for and I soaked it in the milk as another commented suggested, along with green onions since I didn't have chives. Right before using the hand mixer on the carrots I added just a little bit of black pepper. I felt it was missing just a little something at the very end so I put in just a tiny bit of sriracha. I considered using a pepper of some sort but as I don't like spicy I felt it would be too risky. My mother loved it with a teaspoon more of dill in her bowl, I opted for a few more drops of sriracha in mine. Taste was definitely better with that in, not enough to make it spicy or even noticeable but just enough to give an undertone of peppery tang. Delicious.

I used dry herbs at the recommended amount.  The soup needed some more flavor added.  You could go many directions from here, but the recipe as is, is bland.

Very good. We made ours with veggie broth and dry dill. Added more of that and the fresh chives. Needs some salt and pepper. Nice with a caprese salad and grilled sourdough.

I roasted the carrots onions and garlic together after cooking- what a difference in flavor! Also, added a tsp each of coriander,  curry, Cumin and garlic powder. Outstanding with garden fresh green onions & dill!

This was delicious!!! I love soups but really don't make them often. I made it because i bought dill for another recipe and had a lot leftover (dill is my new obsession btw!) . The flavor was unexpectedly amazing without adding any extras and i loved the fact that it didn't need heavy cream or flour since i am always watching fat and calories. I used 1% milk and it was perfect

I omitted to the sauté onions and garlic. I substituted onion salt and garlic powder.  Still super tasty.
