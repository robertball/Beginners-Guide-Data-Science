Delish and tasty! I'm addicted to this. For a more authentic Mexican flavor, omit the Italian dressing and make your own dressing by whisking together olive oil, lime juice, pinch of cayenne pepper, and if you like it  hot, some diced green chile or jalapenos.

My fiance' and I LOVED this! I was browsing for a side dish for an enchilada casserole and I had an idea to use corn and black beans but did not know quite how to execute that idea. I also thought to make a very simple guacamole and serve with chips or just a lettuce and tomato salad. This recipe kind of combined all three ideas, with the black beans, corn, avocado and tomato. YUMMMY!  I served this on a leaf of butter lettuce with tortilla chips and a steak enchilada casserole and this side dish stole the show!! I will make this again!

My family loved it! It certainly dresses up the dinner table - colorful & aromatic!  I have a touchy stomach but I thought, wow, I must try this. I lessened the amount of green onion, red onion & used only a half packet of the dry italian salad dressing mix.  I didn't have avocado, next time I will. Also substituted rice vinegar for the red wine vinegar (using half of what was called for). Didn't serve with the corn chips - took the suggestion of another reviewer to serve on a bed of lettuce. I used romaine. I coupled this recipe with the allrecipes Kraft version of Enchilada's, and added fresh red grapes for the dessert. MMMmmm

I have been making a version of this for years, and it is an addictive hit, especially in the warm months.  Instead of mexican-corn, I use shoepeg corn, add juice from a 1/2 lime, add salt/pepper, and omit the Italian dressing, olive oil, and green onions.  Serve with tortilla scoops....amazing!!

This recipe is a really good and easy to make but it always takes me about 1 hour to prepare it.  I do all of the chopping with a knife and cutting board so maybe if you use a food processor it might cut the prep time down to 20 min.

Now, this is a totally yummy side dish.  My only change was to add the juice of 1 lime.  It enhances the tropical flavor of this salsa.  DH said:  "this one is a keeper:.

Very tasty! Also, simple to make.  The downside is the cost.  You could easily slip in some type of pepper for a little kick.

This sounded like a great recipe but I was missing a number of the ingredients.  Rather than black beans I used lentils, the only onion I had were small Spanish onions and instead of corn I used celery.  I also subbed white wine vinegar for the red, and taco/guacamole seasoning in place of the Italian . . . for a sweet touch I used yellow cherry tomatoes to compliment the 3 diced tomatoes.  End result - the lentils actually gave the salsa a refried beans flavoring . . . and it was great.

I just made this for Mother's Day since she loves all kinds of food like this and it was a major hit.  It's simple enough that anyone can make it but packs so much flavor no one will be disappointed.  I'm making it again but this time I'm using a press-chopper to evenly cut the veggies and it cut the prep time in half at least.  I've been highly recommending this to everyone I know, thanks for the recipe!

This is SO good, I think I just ate half the bowl myself!  I did add fresh cilantro because I have it growing in the garden, red pepper and squeezed half a lime into it (just because I had them on hand and they would go to waste otherwise).  I'm not a big bean fan, but this salsa is just awesome, I know what my dish to pass will be at the next potluck!

Always a favorite. If you want it to be gluten free, I remove the vinegar and Italian dressing packet. I mix fresh lime juice with the olive oil,  and I add Italian spices. I don't use the green onion and find the red onion is enough.

We loved the salsa so much, my friends asked me for the recipe! I didn't use as much red onion, I added cilantro, and I used zesty Italian seasoning instead, but it was delicious! Next time I will use only half a can of black beans though, a whole can was a bit much for my taste. Five Stars!

Excellent recipe, I made my own Italian dressing just like a previous poster recipe. I had extra lettuce and mushrooms so I threw those in and served it as a salad instead of a dip.

This salsa is amazing, everyone always loves it! It does take some time to chop everything up, but it is definitely worth it. Let it macerate for a few hours and it will be perfect.

Great basic recipe. I used 1/2 jar of green salsa verde and omitted the vinegar and Italian seasoning and oil and added cilantro. Everyone raves about this salsa. So good!!

This is a super fast, easy, and YUMMY recipe. I'll sometimes add some jalapeno for a little heat, but really, this is awesome. It doesn't need any changes to make it so great. I'm a picky eater, but I haven't come across anyone that didn't LOVE my new go-to salsa. They all call it my crack salsa since it is so addictive!

I added cilantro and took out the avocados. I used a tablespoon of olive oil and sprinkled the salad with lemon juice. Delicious. Also I used low sodium black beans. I used one large tomato,, mexicorn,  and half of a purple onion. I plan to eat this for lunch for the next 3 days.....next time I want to add garbonza beans.

This was pretty good, but I cheated.  I went to the store and bought fresh salsa and added it instead of chopping all the veggies.   I didn't add the dressing, just added fresh lime juice.  We will be using this recipe again.

Grape tomatoes were a pretty substitution for the chopped tomato.
