OH YUM! First I have to say that I am absolute fan of the avocado being cook this way. It was soooo good that I could've just eaten it like that w/ a dipping sauce, lol. Ok, back to the taco...this was a last minute decision for lunch today to use up some avocados, so I had to go with what I had on hand. I didn't have any corn tortillas, and personally they are not my fave, so I used a WW flour tortilla. Also, I had no cabbage, so I just used lettuce and chopped up a regular tomato. I can't believe how wonderfully crispy and delcious the avocado came out (no one would know that these were baked ad not fried). I served it w/ a side of sour cream and taco sauce, which I think is a must! I will def be making these over and over~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I followed your recipe exact and the avocado didn't brown up and really felt this recipe needs some work.

Loved the baked avocado idea, but as a whole, these didn't make the favorites list.

The idea is amazing, but mine just didn't hold. I am new to cooking so I may have messed this up, but the coating was just bland and clumpy and didn't brown. However, I changed the toppings and used fresh cilantro, limes, tomatoes, onions, pineapple, lettuce and a bit of tzatziki, sour cream, and salsa topped with cheese. After all of that I put it in my sandwich press and had a crispy unique flavored taco!

I didn't use the taco sauce, which was a mistake. The idea of these tacos sounds great, but they were pretty bland.
