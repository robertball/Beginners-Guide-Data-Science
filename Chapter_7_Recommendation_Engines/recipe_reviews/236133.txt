Great base recipe!  Would have given it 5 stars, but I added to the recipe.  I omitted the orange bell pepper and added diced tomatoes and onions instead. I didn't have brown sugar so I used regular white sugar. I wanted a little more flavor, so I added chili powder and garlic powder.  At 24 minutes the cheese was getting too brown, so I would only cook for 20 mins.  Turned out awesome!  Kids loved and husband told me to add to the rotation!

Good basic recipe. Easy to make. Definitely too much sugar. Thinking about adding onion, chili powder, and garlic powder next time to add some more flavor.

Made a few changes, and it was DELICIOUS!

1- Make sure you SALT YOUR RICE WATER. This recipe definitely needs more seasoning than listed.
2- Added onions cut in 1/2 in strips.  I didn't want to add raw veggies straight to the oven, so I stir fried the onions and peppers (1/2 in cubes) until the onions were translucent with olive oil, salt, pepper, and two whole cloves of garlic (smashed to release flavor)
3- Used 2.5 cups of tomato sauce and only 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Seasoned with salt, pepper, parsley, and oregano.  I simmered the sauce in a med. pot for 5-10 minutes to allow the seasoning to cook in.  Then I heated my ground beef in the sauce (I brown and freeze ground beef in bulk).
4- Only cooked in the oven for about 20-25 minutes.

This was such a good recipe.  It reminded my roommates and I of home.  Definitely a soul-food recipe.  :)

Most of my picky eaters liked it. Husband wants it added into regular rotation. I did as others and added onions,  garlic, diced tomatoes, and salt or it would have been too bland. Buy great starter, I didnt really measure the sugar, I doubt I had a full 1/2 cup. But it was good with the sugar and a little more wouldnt have ruined it.

Used it as a basic recipe & tweeked it by frying onion, garlic & Hamburg in olive oil.  Then added tomato sauce, Italian seasoning, fresh basil, bay leaves, oregano & only used 2 tbs. white sugar.  Reduced the rice to 1cup & added a little shredded cheese to the beef mixture.  Precooked chunky sliced green peppers (only used green) in 3 tbs. water in bottom of baking dish.  Poured meat mixture over peppers & sprinkle more shredded cheese over top.  My husband said it was great & wanted me to keep this recipe in favorites.....Easier than making stuffed peppers & my sister didn't precook the peppers & loved it that way too.

I sautéed1/2 c chopped onion in 1T olive oil to start, then added ground beef to brown. I also added only 1T sugar, salt, pepper, basil, oregano and minced garlic. I also added crushed tomatoes, cooked rice, and instead of all that cheddar cheese I mixed in 1/2 c grated Parmesan cheese. Yum.

Really enjoyed this ingenious spin on stuffed bell peppers. I've never made stuffed peppers before, as i new the only thing that would be eaten by my teenager, would be the stuffing. Way to much work and cost in a meal to waste uneaten peppers. Really enjoyed this recipe, and a good way to use up some aging peppers from the frig.

This tasted okay, although too sweet for me and little too dry. I don't usually cook the ground beef first, and I use MInute Rice with added water, then bake covered for an hour. This saves a couple steps and extra dishes to clean. I also use peeled whole tomatoes in addition to the sauce, it makes a very hearty casserole. I think I'll stick to my recipe, but it was interesting to try this one. Minus one star for having to cook the beef and rice first, unnecessary. Thanks for sharing!

Really good base.  But, I also added chopped onions to chopped green peppers.  Then, I added a can of diced tomatoes with chilies.  I used the brown sugar blend with stevia, instead.  I will make again.

I had leftover steamed white rice from Chinese takeout and some bell peppers in the fridge.  Decided to make this.  It turned out great.  I doubled the tomato sauce (it just looked dry) and omitted the brown sugar as sweetness didn't seem to go with this savory dish.  Hubs and I loved it and was easier to make and easier to eat than stuffed peppers

This is the best thing I have eaten in ages. The only changes I made was to add onion and a can of tomatoes. I also cut the recipe in half. I intended to have it one night and freeze the rest. I ate it 3 days in a row. I couldn’t stop eating it and I plan to make it again next week!!

Added a can of diced tomatoes (didn’t have any fresh ones that were ripe), but it ended up being a bit soupy. Tasted great, though—much easier to eat than actual stuffed peppers—at least for the kids. Also added banana peppers.

I added some chopped onions to the meat as it cooked, added some petite diced tomatoes to the tomato sauce, and used 1/3 cup of brown sugar. It was perfect. My wife doesn't like stuffed peppers, but said this was a keeper.

Too sweet and too bland. I had already added all the brown sugar by the time I read the reviews, so I also added some taco seasoning and crushed red peppers. That kicked it up a notch, but I think it definitely needs way less sugar and more spices or some chopped onion cooked with the meat.

This is a good starter recipe, but it didn't have enough flavor for us. 
I used spaghetti sauce instead of plain tomato sauce. I added 1/2 an onion, Italian seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder and a few dashes of hot sauce.

This is a great recipe, everyone loved it . We had enough for three adults to have twice. I only used approx 2 Tbs of sugar and it was enough for us.  Cut the peppers in 1 inch pieces. Thank you, I will definitely make again!

I love stuffed peppers!  I made this recipe instead of my "go to" crock pot stuffed peppers because I had peppers about to go bad and didn't have time.  I found that this seems to make more servings and tastes great!  It reheats well also!   I believe I will make it this way more often now.

Used turkey instead of ground beef. Came out ok, I prefer to stuff the bell pepper but this was definitely quicker. May try it again.

This was great.  Perfect for ppl who don't want to eat a whole pepper.  I followed the recipe pretty close,  but I only used half the rice in order to cut down on leftovers.  Did not use the sugar as other reviewers suggested, and it wasn't missed at all.  I added a little onion powder for flavor.  I would make this again,

This was easy to prepare, cheap, and filling. My husband and I liked it but both agreed that it didn't need sugar at all.

Loved it! I would add a few tweeks. A little less sugar, add some Italian seasoning. Over all, yummy.

Wanted to make something easy but filling. This hit the spot and even satisfied my finicky wife. And plenty of leftovers.

Only thing I changed was instead of 1/2 cup brown sugar I used 1/4 cup. Will make it again.

This recipe was ok. I added the spices suggested by another review but over all it was too sweet. If I tried it again I would only put half the sugar or omit it altogether.
