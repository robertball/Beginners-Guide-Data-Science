This was a easy recipe to throw together but my family did not enjoy this dish to much. The beans on top of the pie got hard when baked. The flavors did not work well together.

Adding chopped onion (if you're onion lovers) and using corn instead of green beans works better for us.

I can't say enough about this recipe. It was a real winner at our house. It's so easy to throw together and it's a great base for experimentation.
