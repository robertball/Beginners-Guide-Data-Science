Scaled down to 3 servings, used reduced fat cream cheese, toasted the chopped walnuts (didn't have halves) in the toaster oven, and then blended in my Cuisinart immersion blender mini-chopper (for an easier cleanup than using a food processor).  We had this for breakfast on toasted mini cinnamon raisin bagels, and my husband said "...this is as good or better than any cream cheese spread you've ever made for bagels."  Haven't had Trader Joe's honey walnut cream cheese, but this is made fresh, and I doubt TJ's could compare more favorably to this version, Totally easy to make, and the honey and the walnuts share equally in making this awesome.  Thanks for sharing Cute Brunettes.!

We always toast the walnuts in an oven or a toaster oven. Anyways, we hope you love it however you may prepare it, toaster oven or not!

I did make this and I added a little brown sugar to it...  It was Super Delicious!   Who would've known you didnt have to spend a fortune to get a GREAT quality spread for your bagels.. or whatever you want to put it on!
