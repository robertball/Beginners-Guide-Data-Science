Okay, I cheated on this one!! Having last-minute guests and wanting a great meal, instead of boiling potatoes and mashing them, I found the instant mashed potatoes in my cupboard and made some according to the box that would serve 10.  I then mixed the cooked mashed potatoes with the remaining ingrediants and baked as directed.  The last 10 minutes, I sprinkled cheese and bacon bits over the top and baked again until melted.  GREAT GREAT potatoes.  They were devoured! Thanks Beth...I'll do in the right way next time.

I made this to take to Thanksgiving dinner in 2001 and they were a huge hit.  I was really upset when I couldn't find the recipe for this year as they were so tasty.  I made sure to save it to my recipe box this time.  
These are great, the cheese and sour cream add a real richness to the potatoes that you can't get with just butter and milk.  My grandfather who hates both cream cheese and sour cream loved them.  We just didn't tell him the truth about what he was eating.  
If you are looking for an easy way to do make ahead mashed potatoes this is it.  They are great!

My husband found this recipe and made it for us and it was the best mashed potatoes I have ever had! He added some green onions and grated colby-monterrey jack cheese on top, which was delicious and colorful! I made these about a week later myself because we both liked them so much. It makes alot though, so we invited company the second time! I served them with pork tenderloins.

If you cover these potatoes with foil for half their baking time, they do not dry out.  I didn't have whole potatoes so I substituted a thawed bag of hash browns with peppers and onions.  I steamed on the stove for 10 minutes then mashed.  These were very good!  The addition of the sour cream "and" cream cheese was a nice flavor.  Will make again.

I have been making these for years and they are fabulous! One of my most requested side dishes but definitely not one for those that are dieting. You can do the "lite" side of it but it is in no way the same. This is worth the extra calories.....believe me!

I have made this recipes for holidays, big family get togethers and parties.  Its a great hit!  For parties, I usually end up making this a a couple of weeks in advance and freeze it. (Don't bake it until you need it)  Believe it or not, it actually taste better.

These potatoes were FANTASTIC! I was really looking for something new to do with potatoes. I added a little more sour cream to make it a little creamier. I also used garlic salt since I didnt have any onion salt. Really good. I might try some minced garlic in this next time. This is going to be a regular in our house!! Thanks for posting it.

These are really good and love that you can make a day in advance.  However, the calorie load is high and Im not sure the calorie to taste ratio is necessarily worth it.  People didnt realize there was all the cream cheese and sour cream in there but did say they were "good potatoes".  So its a good recipe but definately not for every day.  Also, these got a little dry after being in the oven and I used whole milk to thin the leftovers and that worked really well.  I'd almost recommed putting some milk into them if you are putting them in a bowl for oven heating since the bowl takes a while to heat through and they can dry out a bit.  The creamier texture allowed more of the nuanced tastes to come through.

I got this recipe years ago from my mother-in-law and I always get rave reviews! Use white pepper instead of black to avoid the speckles, if you like. I just use regular salt instead of onion salt.

These are fantastic! I like to add just a dash or so of Ranch seasoning mix, but you don't need it b/c these are delicious as-is!

Christmas dinner, Fluffy and light, but the cream cheese and sour cream overpower the potatoe taste.  If I were to do it again I would cut down on those items and add more butter.

These potatoes are the BEST!!  I made them for 13 people last night and everyone raved about them!  I put some cheddar and bacon bits on top for the last 10 minutes of the bakind time which really added something good to this already delicious recipe.  Thanks!

I have made these potatoes several times. I used to only make them for Thanksgiving, but then my family kept asking me to make them for other occasions. I make them the day before, refrigerate and put them in my slow cooker. They are an easy dish to make and easy to bring to pot lucks and everybody loves them. If you have never tried them you are missing out.

this is a great tasting potato dish!  I made this for a Christmas eve get together with my home group.  The changes I made was I added some onion dip as well as the cream cheese and sour cream.    Instead of onion salt I used garlic salt and a jalapeno spice blend I have at the house! topped it with cheese and crumbled bacon!  Delicious and a HUGE hit with everyone!!

Very good recipe.  They do dry out in the oven, so I had to add more milk to moisten them.  Also, I mixed green onion and bacon into the potatoes before I baked it.  Put cheddar cheese on top, and they turned out really well.  If you want to freeze some (before baking) make sure to add more milk because they can get dry.

This recipe turns out great every time.  I always add a clove or two of garlic to it just for a slight garlic flavor.  I love the fact that I can make this recipe ahead of time, it just makes my life that much easier!

Good potatoes. I added some extra butter. I think that I will add milk next time too. They get a little dry after baking. Very good.

Oh, my gosh!!  These were sooo good!!  I boiled the potatoes with peels on them.  I didn't use the sour cream or the onion salt -(trying to cut my fat levels).  Instead, I squeezed one large clove of garlic through a press, and substituted "I Can't Believe it's Not Butter" for the butter.  Used about 2/3 of the cream cheese and added skim milk until the potatoes were creamy with a few lumps here and there.  This is the way I like 'em!!  They were a huge hit in my household.  Will make again for Thanksgiving!!  Thanks for an Outstanding recipe!  We absolutely loved them.

Very tasty, but incredibly fattening (even with lower fat cream cheese).  For that reason I only give it 4 stars.  If you are not diet-conscience, then this is the mashed potato recipe for you.

Wow, these are great and have become a standard at our house on holidays.  I sometimes make them the night before, put in the casserole I am going to serve in and cover with a very thin layer of milk, then place saran wrap tightly on the milk to seal.  They heat up wonderfully -- do take a bit more than 30 minutes this way though to get warm thru the middle.

These were very good for mashed potatoes.  I did add the bacon and green onions on top!

Love this recipe!! It was so easy to make and my family of picky eaters loved it as well! The only things I did a little different was I added 3 slices of freshly cooked bacon crumbled up and chives to the potatoes. I also added cheese to the top.

This is wonderful. It is now a regular everyday dish in our family dinners. Sometimes I add a sprinkle of garlic powder to make garlic mashed potatoes.  Very Good!

This was a great recipe but I thought it was just alittle too much cream cheese.  These potatoes came out really thick and creamy.  I like my mashed potatoes to be alittle more fluffy.  To make it look more apatizing I added paparika, montery jack and cheddar cheese blend.

I was in a hurry, and needed a potato dish for a large amount of people.  Used instant potatoes, and followed recipe.  Threw in crockpot to keep warm.  HUGE hit.  Added bacon bits, not sure if that was in recipe or not.

So good I wanted to lick the pot clean! I made a few minor alterations that I think added to the flavor explosion: I used Yukon Gold potatoes, added a few roasted garlic cloves, and used 2 tsp onion powder and 2 tsp Kosher salt instead of 2 tsp onion salt and 1 tsp table salt. De-lish! :)

Did not like this at all, sorry.  The cream cheese and sour cream gave this a creamty texture but also too bitter of a taste than we like.

Made this for my family for the holiday.  Very easy to make and everyone loved it, they all went home with copies of the recipe.  I made it the night prior and then put in the crockpot the next day for serving, I also added some garlic powder and I used low fat sour cream and cream cheese.   No one knew the difference since they were asking for the recipe.  MMMM...very good.

these were OK.  I made them for a party last night and everyone seemed to love them but I thought they were just alright based on all the added fat I would think they would be much better.  I added chives, scallions and crumbled bacon to the mixture which def. helped the taste.  I also added garlic salt instead of onion salt.  I sprinkled cheddar cheese on top.  They were def good but not sure if I would make them again.

It had been quite some time since I made these.  I had forgotten about this recipe.  My daughter hadn't.  After months of not making these, she was in a panic last night to have them with her broiled pork chops.  She helped me dig through all the recipes and she even helped make them.  Thank you again for saving the day!!

fantastic!  I used garlic salt because I didn't have onion salt and used onion powder instead (2 tsp of ea).  Also used 1 tsp season salt instead of regular table salt.  Topped with butter and sharp cheddar cheese and it was the hit of the party!  Definitely a keeper and so easy to do.

Added some garlic cloves to cook with potatoes and mashed them right in.  Also stirred some parmesan cheese in with cream cheese and sour cream.  Easy and good.  Next time will add some minced chives.

I also cheated on this one.  Instead of buying potatoes & cooking them, I bought the frozen hash browns - they gave the dish a little texture.  Everyone loved it!

This was a winner all the way around. DO NOT OVER COOK - they will get very dry and they need a bit of moisture when reheated. I put them under the broiler to brown up the top and every one loved them. Great flavor and texture. Not your every day mash!

This has to be hands down the BEST mashed potatos ever. The whole family loved them. ( Not a easy task.) They were easy to make and very very much enjoyed!!! Thank You for posting it.

Thank you for such a fabulous recipe! My dinner guests raved and wanted the recipe! My Mother begged to lick the spoon and the bowl as if it were cake batter!

I once made this recipe for my boyfriend.  Now, the only type of potatoes allowed in my house are party potatoes.  
Regular mashed potatoes are too plain for us now.  If you want to add a little bit of stir to regular potatoes - try this!

Great mashed potatos!  I substituted garlic salt for the onion salt and added a bit of milk, which worked well.  I will make this again.

Pretty good.  (my daughter--2yrs--wanted seconds and then, when I went to put the leftovers in the fridge, she snagged the spoon to lick it hehe :p)  I didn't have time to bake it but despite that, I think it turned out pretty good none the less.  Thanks for the awesome side dish!

Yummy!! This was good!! I like the rich flavor in these mashed potatoes. What makes it even better is preparing this dish using fresh potatoes instead of store brought. Fresh is always better. I don't know what else to say but- yummy yummy yummy!! Thank you very much. This is going to be something that I will make again in the future.

I'm fond of this recipe because you can make it a day ahead.  9 large potatoes will usually fill a 13x9 baking dish.  I usually reduce the onion salt to 1 teaspoon.  For another taste variation, top with shredded American cheese and a small can of fried onions before baking. A keeper!

I make something almost like this but HIGHLY recommend using FRENCH ONION DIP instead of sour cream.  Also a bit of garlic salt!

The only thing I added to this recipe was a few roasted garlic cloves (we like garlic).  These are wonderful.  I served them with slow cooked beef brisket and roasted brussel sprouts form Christmas dinner!

I love these potatoes!!!!  I used cream of mushroom soup this time, but I might try cheddar soup next time since the people I'm serving don't really care for mushrooms!  Isn't is great when you find these things out after you cook for them??

These were great! I used the regular salt to flavor the water when boiling the potatoes. Boiled for about 15-20 minutes. I used light cream cheese and sour cream and thought they worked great.

I'm not a mashed potato fan...but it's one of my DH's favorite things.  I've made it several times now (for Thanksgiving and last weekend with meatloaf).  The first time I followed the recipe to the "T" and everyone at Thanksgiving enjoyed it.  The second time, the potatoes were still warm after I was done mashing them, I skipped the step of sticking them in the oven.  Tasted just as great!  So if you're running low on time, not putting it in the oven doesn't change anything and you save 30 minutes.

Love this! I have made it so many times I no longer measure anything and just add to taste. I do add more sour cream than called for. We make this for every holiday family meal and they are always gone!

I love these potatoes.  I made them when I was still living at home, my mom was letting me do all the cooking for Thanksgiving and I found this recipe so I tried it and the WHOLE FAMILY LOVED IT!  It takes a little work, but it is really worth it!

I love these potatoes. I've made them for years. They seem to go with everything and you can use different seasonings to suit the main dish. I usually add some sauted fresh garlic to give them a kick. Other times I add some wasabi paste to make wasabi mashed potatoes. Anyway you dress them they are sure to please.

I have made these several times and they're always well received!  I follow the recipe exactly except add a little grated Cheddar cheese to the top instead of butter.  Really wonderful and I love that I can make them ahead of time and just pop in the oven to heat.

Can really taste the cream cheese, was nice but I just LOVE the taste of potatoes and as personal tastes go I have a great garlic or regular mashed recipe.  Otherwise it was good.

These were ok...my boyfriend really liked them!!  I agree with other reviews that state the sour cream and cream cheese take away from the potato taste...Mine did turn out very creamy and not at all dry...I only used 7 potatoes rather then 9...Thanks for sharing!

We enjoyed these because they were different.  When I make them again I will use garlic salt instead of regular salt and add a little more butter.  Thanks!

Very flavorful recipe, and fairly easy to make.  My potatoes were a little dry though.  I only dotted the casserole with four small pats of butter, which may have been the reason.  I would probably add more to the top and also add additional sour cream and cream cheese to the potatoes so it's more moist before it goes into the oven.  Either way, my husband (who is a mashed potato fanatic) loved this dish.  I'll make this again.

I didn't love these. The extra ingredients take away from the potato-ey taste, and they came out a little dry.

These were a great change from basic mashed potatoes.  Everyone loved them!  They were so creamy and the onion salt really added a wonderful flavor.  One of the best things about this recipe is that it's able to be made ahead of time!  I HIGHLY recommend this!  Thanks Beth!

Compared to other mashed potatoe recipes I've tried from this website, I'd say these have the most flavor. No one ever said mashing potatoes was easy, but the beater really helped! I'd give this recipe an A.

These are THE best!!  If you love garlic mashed, bake a garlic bulb with a little olive oil, peel and add the cooked garlic cloves to the potatoes when you beat in the cream cheese etc. FABULOUS!!!

The only thing that I didn't like about this recipe was that it called for only cooking the potatoes most of the way, not until they were soft.  It was too hard to not have lumps.  I would use the recipe again except I would fully cook the potatoes.

in addition to the recipe instructions, I added garlic salt to the boiling water to infuse that flavor into the potatoes, with good results.  I also make a consummate from beef drippings to pour over the spuds during the meal.  Yum!

Delicious! I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. I will definitely be making this again! I substituted onion powder for onion salt and used plain Greek yoghurt instead of sour cream.

Yum! This was a really tasty recipe, with room for  lots of improvising.  I made it the night before Thanksgiving and stuck it in the fridge. The next day , I brought it out for 30 minutes, then cooked as the recipe stated. The potatoes had a nice, creamy texture and a mellow flavor. My husband doesn't usually care that much for mashed potatoes, but he thought these were very good. This recipe is a keeper!

Great recipe!  I substiuted garlic salt for the onion salt as my family loves garlic.  Would add a little milk to this next time as it was a bit dense.

I made this for Christmas for 10 people and this is what I did.  Peel and boil 2 bags of white potatoes until fork tender. (I used 2 pots so they didn't get starchy). Put into a large mixing bowl with 1 8 oz package of light cream cheese, a 16 oz. container of sour cream, 3 tablespoons of butter, garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste.  Mix well and poured into my crock pot, topped with sliced green onions and put on the "keep warm" setting until dinner.  Just before serving I topped with a few dots of butter, stir and served.  There wasn't a drop left over and everyone raved about them.  Enjoy!

A bit too salty, but we enjoyed it.  We are going to go straight onion powder and reduce the salt a little next time.

My family has been using this recipe for years.  It's from a Southern Living cookbook from the 70's.  For a prettier presentation sprinkle with paprika before baking.

I thought that they were OK, my fiance loved them. They are really really thick and dense, so either cut down the recipe, or invite about a hundred people to dinner. Give them a try and decide for yourself.

These spuds were "The Bomb".  Our 2-year-old didn't touch, but what's new.  We used low-fat cream cheese and light sour cream and they were still awesome. Yo.

These were VERY tasty.  Everyone loved them.  I did add some milk to it because I thought they looked a little dry.  Came out fabulous and I loved being able to make them up ahead of time and just pop them in the oven.  A big hit.

I made this for a family party and served it with ham and turkey.  Everyone loved it and the leftovers were fantastic also.  I will definitely make this again.

These were the best potatoes I have ever made!  I will definately make this again.  Next time I will try fat free sour cream and cream cheese.

The recipe turned out alittle too tangy for our liking, never the less, it was a hit.  We added finely chopped parsley and fried onions for extra zip.
