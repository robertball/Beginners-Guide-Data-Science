Please note that these biscuits should not be given to children under 1 year old because they contain honey.

These are great!  Just baking them a little longer as other reviews have suggested dries them out and they harden just right.

I like this biscuit. My changes were to decrease the amount of vanilla to 2 tsp and use 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all-purpose.  Also, I cook the biscuits for about 17 minutes, turning them over after about 12 minutes.

My baby loves these.  Unfortunately so does my dog.  I did have to add some additional flour to make the dough stiff enough, but it might be because it is so humid here right now, I have been having all sorts of issues baking lately with that.  I didn't use any honey because my son is still too young but it was easy to substitute simple syrup.  I didn't have the issue hardening that other seemed to have.

This recipe worked for me perfectly exactly as stated.  I'm so happy my 13 month old twins like them since they are so much healthier than teething biscuits at the store, and they're very easy and fast to make.

These weren't especially good. I found that they didn't harden up like you would expect a teething biscuit to do. The flavor wasn't bad (I tried one).

They were hard to roll out and they tasted bitter. This could be due to the type of whole wheat flour we used. I made twice and used honey once and syrup the next time, but the taste didn't change. My son eats them, but doesn't ask for more.

Easy to make - had to bake longer than recommended but baby loves them. So do the dogs when baby drops 'em!

They came out really good and my daughter loves them. I used sprouted whole wheat flour and needed 1-cup.
