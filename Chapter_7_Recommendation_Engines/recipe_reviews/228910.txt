I loved this recipe.  I was looking for a burrito recipe to rival Qdoba and I have found it!  I did marinade and grill my chicken on a George Foreman grill instead of using rotisserie chicken, which added flavor, so I would suggest that.  I also used about 2 Tblsp of bottled lime juice instead of fresh from a lime.  The flavor was terrific and very much like Qdoba.  I'll be holding onto this recipe!

I thought these turned out pretty good. But, my husband wasn't a big fan (he's not a big fan of Mexican food anyway). I did have to alter the recipe quite a bit though. I omitted the cilantro, because I knew he wouldn't like it. I used Tyson frozen chicken and added poultry seasoning for flavor. I couldn't find the Old El Paso seasoned beans at my local grocery store. So, I used regular black beans and added burrito seasoning to them while they were cooking. Overall, it was good. And, I would make it again (when he's not home).

This was a very good, easy recipe. Unless you like a strong cilantro taste, I would use a bit less of it though. My husband and I added some cheese to this recipe and also decided to fry it in a skillet with some vegetable oil-gave it a very nice crunch. It was good without frying too though. Easy for beginner cooks like ourselves!

So good! I used the leftover chicken from Lime-Chicken-Soft-Tacos from this site. I doubled this recipe to freeze leftovers. I added a cup of frozen corn to the chicken/rice mixture. I used 2 cans of drained/seasoned black beans. I set up an assembly line, tortillas, then 1/8 cup black beans, then 1/4 cup of the rice mixture. I wrapped the ones to freeze in foil.

Awesome burrito with little effort!  We added some El Paso burrito seasoning to the chicken to give it some more flavor.  I also cut the cilantro to about a quarter cup.

I made this exactly like the recipe. It was delicious! Both my children liked it too.  My daughter is a vegetarian, so I left out the chicken in hers.... She loved it!

I thought these were pretty good, but didn't exactly remind me of Qdoba or Chipotle burritos.  They were very easy to make for a busy weeknight.  My lime was extra juicy and I wish I would have used a bit less of it's juice, as they were a little too limey for my taste.  I used homemade salsa and served the burritos with the extra salsa and chips on the side.  Thanks for the recipe, Old El Paso!

This was SO GOOD!!
Used frozen southwest chicken breast strips (cheaper than a deli chicken), used Goya canned seasoned black beans because I couldn't find the Old El Paso. It was easy and a great flavor combination.

Delicious! If you have ever been to Chipotle in So Cal, this tastes just like their burritos. Yum!

So good and so easy! Just like Qdoba but way cheaper - my favorite.

This is a good start. I used Brown rice and iceberg lettuce to keep it lo cal and healthy. I will make this recipe again so that I can experiment with adding to it.

Nearly all recipes on this site have a 4-1/2 rating and that's a shame because I actually made this.  It was awful:  bland with a texture of blubber.

This was really good and a meal you can start at 5:00 if you haven't figured out what you're making.  The few changes I made were, I used quinoa instead of rice (b/c that is what I had), I also used refried beans in addition to black beans and that was the first thing I put on the tortilla.  Last, I added a slice of avocado inside (and sour cream).  It was really good!  Will definitely make again.

It was alright, but I don't know if it was worth doing again. My husband made it and he made a mess of the kitchen. It may go better next time if I do it myself.
