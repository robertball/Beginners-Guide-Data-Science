Let me start by saying that by trade, I am a baker and cake decorator so I did not goof up this recipe. 
I am searching for a homemade recipe for my cakes because I tired of all of the unpronounceable chemicals that are in commercial products these days. 
First off, it did not dome while baking, and as I was removing it from the oven, there was a strong odor of egg coming from it.
I let it cool for 20 minutes then taste tested it, egg and orange juice was the dominate flavors. I waited another 40 minutes and tasted it again in a cooled state and the flavor was the same  eggy/oj flavors as before.
I did not find it to overly sweet, but that maybe because I was overwhelmed by the other two negatively dominate flavors.   
Usually, I try to salvage test foods, but this one ended up in the compost - there was no saving it.
To it's credit, this recipe produces a moist cake.

I don't generally do this, but I decided to look at some of the reviews for this recipe, specifically, those rating it poorly. By and large I disagree with them, and can only report my own result - and here it is - MMMM-MM. Yes, it IS a heavy, dense cake - not all cakes are SUPPOSED to be light and fluffy! This cake would be ideal where a sturdy cake is needed for carving.  It is rich and moist.  It's deliciously, delightfully and delicately orange flavored. I was somewhat suspicious of the disproportionately high sugar to flour ratio, but I went with the recipe as written and wasn't disappointed.  It might be a tad heavy on the oil, and I don't see that it would hurt anything to reduce it by 1/4 cup or so if that's more appealing to you, but I enjoyed this cake so much I'm not going to quibble about a couple of tablespoons!  I frosted it with a vanilla buttercream and loved it.  An orange flavored buttercream (including zest) would be nice with this too. On top of being toe-curling good, it couldn't have been easier to mix up and just HAS to be fool-proof because of it!

Although I read all the reviews I decided NOT to add the flour that it seemed liked it needed and just decided to go with the recipe as it was written.  It was great!!  This was a very moist, sticky yellow cake with some orange zest.  It was great as is.  It looks a little funny baking... the middle gets done quicker but it is great as is.. wait it out!  :)

I have made this cake about a dozen times, and it turns out great every time.  It's super easy, I always have the ingredients on hand, and it's best WITHOUT FROSTING!  Not to be used as a decorated cake!  It has crispy edges and a wonderful flavor that reminds me of Nilla Wafer cookies.  Honestly, just try it as the recipe is written and no frosting.  Don't try to turn it out, leave it in a 9x13 pan.  It's much to moist to turn out, or decorate.

As usual, I was looking for a cake I could make with the ingrediants I had on hand. I only had two eggs, but gave it a shot anyway. It turned out awesome, and I don't know why some people are having such bad luck. It does have a citrus-y flavor, but anything will if you put OJ in it! Cooked for 30 mins. in a 9x13 pan.

This cake turned out way too sweet, the crust was hard and crunchy and it didn't dome at all. No one in my family liked this one. Even my son who will eat anything. I followed the recipe exactly.

I always like to let a cake rest overnight before evaluating its flavor and texture, and I did the same with this cake. The pros: Super-quick to throw together, with a nice, subtle orange essence, and it was a moist cake. The sides were crunchy, but they softened overnight. The cons: the cake was moist, but oily; I think the reviewer below me has the right idea in subbing half of the oil for yogurt. The cake also had a strong eggy flavor. I didn't get a particularly dense or fluffy result; the texture wasn't bad, but the oily result and the eggy flavor were real turn-offs.

Baked this once before and used milk and it turned out bad. I decided to give this another try with the exact ingredients except a bit altered and one word, AMAZING. LOVE the hint of orange in it. soo good! and it is SO moist it's unbelivable. I changed a couple of things though. 1 cup of sugar instead of 2 because it will be way too sweet and 2 eggs instead of 4. you have to try it and ignore all the bad reviews. They obviously didnt make it right the first time.

I have to say that at the beginning, and after reading all the bad reviews, I thought it would be a dissaster.  I was surprised with the results.  I absolutely liked its apearance and taste.  And best of all, it was easy to make with ingredients I had on hand.  I would recommend you give it a try, you will probably be as surprised as I was.

While I appreciate the experience represented, the fact that one has dedicated his/her life to being a baker does not make one infallible. Fellow "non-experts," please remember this when reading reviews such as the previous one. :) Don't be afraid to try a recipe yourself, even if the professionals are naysayers.

Now, for my experience... I made this recipe almost exactly as specified and it turned out great for me. Keep in mind that a cake made with oil will turn out a bit more dense. I think you also have to use some common sense with this one. It does not specifically say to use a mixer, but with most cakes you do. So, that is what I did with this one. Do not over-mix, though, or you will have an even denser cake.

The only change I made was to use brown sugar instead of white. I also cut it down just a bit and added just a tad more flour to make up the difference (probably about 1/4 cup exchange). It looked like a slightly runnier cake batter when it was mixed completely.

Also, before I added the wet ingredients to the dry, I mixed them first. Again, this just seemed sensible to me, based on other cakes I've made. I did cut back on the orange juice because I was afraid it would be overpowering to use as a strawberry shortcake. However, I wish I had not. The orange flavor would have been better with the full amount of juice.

Great moist cake! Nothing wrong with the recipe. I think it just needs to be clarified a little to say exactly what it means.

Loved the fact that this called for orange juice, as I love any kind of citrus flavor.  I didn't want to add a full cup of oil, so I ended up using 1/2 cup of orange yogurt in place of half of the oil.  This resulted in a fluffier, less dense cake than most reviewers stated.  It was still plenty moist with just a little orange flavor.  Since I was taking these to work, I made them into mini cupcakes as well as mini Bundt cakes.  I frosted with the golden orange frosting recipe (from this site), and they were just perfect!

I really didn't like this cake. Very eggy flavor, crunchy top and sides (I didn't overbake), and the texture was weirdly sticky and coarse. It was moist and not dense but overall just not very good.

I just made these and they're awesome! I made them into cupcakes and they cooked in about 20 minutes. I used 1/2 cup of orange juice instead of 3/4 because that was all I had left. I is very delicious and moist. it has a crispy top that is also very good. I was going to make a frosting for these, but I think they are better alone.  I wouldn't use this as your basic yellow cake mix, but it's still a good cake.

I made this with the help of 4 kids ranging from 1-9 years old. We used fresh squeezed orange juice and the kids got impatient after only squeezing 1/2 a cup so that's all we used. The batter looks like it needs more flour but after reading a review from another user, I knew not to add any. The cake is moist and delicious!!! We're using it for strawberry shortcake. It was super simple and tastes oh so good! I will be using this recipe instead of buying boxed cake mix from now on!

This is wonderful.  Very easy and works for a milk and gum  allergy. Just what I've been looking for.  I used cake flour and made a frosting with orange juice con. and powdered sugar and even my boyfriend loved it....he hardly likes anything I make because he does like certain textures or foods and this cake is loved by all.

This is an easy recipe for bake-from-scratch cake. The flavor was good and it was moist. I thought it called for too much sugar though so I cut it down by 1/4 cup and it still tasted pretty sweet. Will try it with just 1-1/2 cups next time. Overall it's a good and simple recipe.

This recipe was okay, but like some other reviewers here, it wasn't to my tastes. It was crumbly, the flavor was okay but I didn't like the "mouth feel" and it was awfully heavy. Since this recipe seems to have varied results for both pros AND novices (why hate on either? both are valid), I'll keep looking for one thats a little more dependable.

I just made this and it is EXCELLENT.  So easy to make and so tasty!  I have a lot of whole wheat flour so I added 1/2 cup of that instead of using all all-purpose-flour.  I also added 1/3 cup less of sugar just because I don't like things too sweet and it still taste pretty sweet to me.  I've tried other highly rated white/yellow cake recipes on this site and they turned out kinda dry, but this is the most moist cake I've ever baked.  Finally, a cake I want to bake again!

I made mini-cupcakes from this recipe. My whole family liked them, which is a huge shock. It does have a citrus flavor (which I think is to be expected). I frosted them with a butter-cream icing, which may have made them a little sweet if they had been regular-sized cupcakes, but as it was they were fine. I plan on using this recipe again.

This cake is absolutely GREAT. I have had several friands and relatives try it and I have all kinds of positives coments. The great sampling came abour when I misread the recipe and used two cups of vegetable oil which meant that I had to double the rest of the ingredients. That gave me much more to share. The positive comments were outstanding. The only variation that I made is that I did not have enough vanilla extract so I substituted lemon extract. It was still great.

very good for a quick cake with minimul ingredients.  I did only use 3 eggs and i subsituted lemon juice for orange juice and lemon extract for vanilla.  I liked that it didn't really need a frosting since the cake was very sweet I may reduce the sugar a little next time I make

This was wonderful. The best thing about it is that it's so easy to put together, with things most people have on hand. The oj make just the right amount of secret flavor. I did only use 1/2 cup of oil and it was a little dense. but if you want a homemade tasting cake,definatly try this one.

I've been using this recipe for about 2 years now. Every time that one of my family members or friends have a party or need a cake they always ask me to make it. It's the favorite of all cakes with them. Goes really great with an orange glaze.

This is so good! I added to mashed bananas and 1 1/3 cup of butterscotch chips to the mix. Then I baked it in a loaf pan for 45-50 minutes.

This cake was fabulous! Instead of using vinilla extract, I used 1 1/2 of almond. (serving size 12). This has a great orange flavor and is a dense cake that I absolutley love! I served it for desert for my mom's birthday with whipped cream on top and a slice of orange,. The orange juice I used was from my orange tree that I squeezed to make the cake, and the flavor really stuck out. I will definatley make this again!

My husband ( who is NOT a baker) made this cake as written and it was wonderful! The cake was sweet so we  frosted it w/ a butter cream frosting and I just cut some of the sugar out of that recipe. My kids loved it and I will have him make it again. He also baked it in a stoneware bunt pan because thats what he thought the picture was of:)

Excellent recipe.  Made exactly by the recipe except added 3/8 tsp of salt to accent the other flavors.  Adding 1/8 to 1/4 tsp of salt per cup of flour is a good rule of thumb on sweets.  You don't taste the salt but it intensifies the other flavors and keeps the recipe from tasting flat.  I used 4 standard large eggs and it did not taste eggy at all.  Mixing was done by beating with a wisk.  The pan (9 x 13 glass baking pan) was prepped by using cooking spray and dusting with flour.  It was served directly from the pan and didn't stick.  Is probably too moist to try to remove from the pan for presentation.  Very moist and flavorful and does not need an icing. I used an oven thermometer, preheated the oven to 350 as directed, and cooked exactly 45 minutes.  The cooking time will vary depending on the altitude (we're about 200 ft above sea level).  The whole family loved the recipe and it will definitely be a regular.

This was really good!  I did tweak it just a bit.  I didn't end up having enough OJ, but I did have a few lemons, so I juiced those.  About 1/2 and 1/2 OJ & lemon juice.  I also added in the lemon zest from 1 lemon.  I had some lemon juice left over, so after I took it out of the oven I poked holes in the cake and poured a lemon glaze (lemon juice & powdered sugar) on top.  After that set, I sprinkled it with powdered sugar.  It was wonderful!  Tasted just like lemon bars.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I got this cake to turn out wonderfully - with modifications thanks to reading the reviews. I added a cup of flour and subtracted an egg. I didn't have oj in the house so I used mountain dew. I beat it on high speed for two minutes. I would start checking it for doneness as much as 10 minutes early. My oven bakes fast and I took it out after 35, but it could have done with a couple of minutes less. The cake domed beautifully, looked and tasted great.

This cake is delicious! It's moist without being to heavy. The only thing I changed was the amount of orange juice. I'm not a huge fan of it, so I reduced it to 1/2 cup. Today, I made this for the 4th time, and it always comes out tasty!

I've been baking cakes succesfully...from sratch...for almost 40 years, and this one was a big disappointment. I noticed that the amount of oil in proportion to the flour it called for was far too much... almost as much oil as there was flour.... and it was so sweet. It tasted eggy and like the vegetable oil I used; I couldn't taste the orange juice at all, which I squeezed by hand!. My cake developed a brown, hard, crusty rectangle in the middle of the cake that looked awful, it didn't dome, and the sides were crusty and stuck to the pan. Maybe by increasing the flour, or decreasing the sugar and oil would help, but I'm not going to take the chance of wasting good ingredients again.

Fantastic, this is absolutely delicious. I only had 3 eggs so the cake is a kinda crumbly around the edges. I also ran out of oil so the measuring cup was just one level (I'm guessing 1/8c less) below 1c. Also I used 1c o.j. (to make up for the other deficiencies) I'll definitely make this again.

I used this cake with pineapple upside down cake V instead of the box cake it calls for.  I used 1.5 cups of sugar and 3/4 cup pineapple juice.  I baked it in two 9in pans for about 30 minutes.  It is VERY moist, sweet- very tasty.  I made it for my husband's birthday and he liked it a lot.

I thought this was very tasty! I had to make cupcakes and didnt have any box mix or milk in the house so I picked this one. Also they were going to be Halloween cupcakes so I thought the orange taste would be perfect. They came out moist and yummy! 27 minutes in my oven for 24 cupcakes and they are perfect. You can fill up the cupcake batter almost to the top, they dont rise much. Batter very watery but they taste great!

The cake taste too much eggy, and it came out very moist but with the oil. I believe it is high in calories, therefore we can improve it. I will make it again: 2 or 3 eggs, 1/2 cup of vegetable oil,and 1 1/2 cup of orange juice.  And 3 teaspoons of vanilla extract I will post the result when I try it.

I have to say I love this cake! I have made it several times now and it is a big hit at the office, home & birthday parties! I followed the recipe, but reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups as I found it a tad too sweet. To add a little freshness to it, I added some lemon zest. Not too much, but just a tad to give it a fresh taste. This is a keeper for me!

I really liked this recipe, very moist.   I substituted white cake flour, as I only had whole wheat all purpose flour on hand, and used 1/2 cup lemonade instead of 3/4 cup orange juice (as I was out of oj).  I baked in two 9 in round cake dishes, reducing the cook time to 35 minutes.  As other reviewers suggested, I skipped the frosting.  I served with fresh strawberries and whip cream.  I will definitely make this again. Will try the oj, or maybe pineapple juice and I think I'll give whole wheat pastry flour a try. I'm not sure why other reviewers had problems with the recipe. I am not a baker and found it simple to follow.  I did mix thoroughly  w/ an electric mixer for a very smooth texture (about 3 min).  Delicious!

I felt like I had to review this recipe since it got several bad reviews.  It is not a cake your going to make for a fancy party, but it is quite good.   I have just moved and don't have a mixer yet and it only requires simple ingredients.  My children and a neighbor have like it so far.  It reminds me of a simple cake from my childhood.

I made this and followed other user's suggestions by adding 1 add'l cup of flour and reducing the egg by 1.  It was WAAAAAY to floury.  If I were to make this again I'd try adding an additional 1/2 cup of flour instead.  I love that this had no butter, but other than that the flavor was lacking.

I also by trade am a baker and by that, I know what I am getting into when I get random recipes online. This was a pleasant surprise. It is not something I would frost up or decorate, but maybe leave in the pan, or make two with a think frosting center and no outer frosting. The taste is very unique and super moist. The crispy edges taste amazing.  Expect something different and you will love it!

I did not like this cake at all. I followed the instructions and should have listened the reviews. The cake was very dense..not light at all and had a crust on the top.

I needed a basic yellow cake recipe to convert to a coconut cake because I hated all the recipes I found for coconut cake. This one worked amazing! I used cream of cocunut in place of the orange juice and topped it with a buttercream made with cream of coconut instead of milk and added flaked coconut to the top. It was amazing!!!

I thought this cake was great! I wanted a non-dairy cake, so I was pleased to find the recipe. But then I didn't have any orange juice. I substituted canned pineapple, used a little less sugar and it was delicious! I don't know how it didn't come out for other people.

Was looking for a yellow cake recipe because all I had was chocolate cake mix in my pantry.  This is a keeper.  A moist tasty sponge that took little longer to prepare than cake mix.  I followed other reviewers that reduced the oil to 2/3 c, sugar to 1-1/2 c and orange juice to 1/2 c (thanks).  I made 2 dozen cupcakes -- baked them in 2 batches for 25 mins each time.  Next time I'll put them in for 20 mins as the tops are not very soft when they cool if they're too brown.  I melted 1 cup of white chocolate chips with 1 tsp of shortening in the microwave and when cooled, spooned this in a ziplock bag, cut a little hole in it and drizzled this over the cupcakes. This was not only easier then making frosting, but emphasized the tastiness of the cake.

my cake stuck to the pan so i would reccomend that you butter and flour the pan before you pour in the cake batter. it was a little oily for my taste but it was incredibly moist although it was not the yellow color that i was looking for it turned out very dark but i think that was because of the orange juice. it tasted great but i thought the orange was to subtle, next time i'll use a regular yellow cake recipe with orange extract. not very impressed since the cakes fell in the middle too.

This cake was good, but it seems to have too much oil in the recipe.  I would make it again; next time I'll change the oil to 2/3 cup and also reduce the amount of orange juice a little (maybe only 1/3 cup).  Also, it only took 35 minutes!

Super easy & fairly quick to make. Baking time was only 33 minutes, so that wasn't bad :) Very tasty, though a slight orange taste. I can't wait to frost it w/chocolate!

Typically I don't make reviews on recipes, but this one needed it. I absolutely loved this cake and I have made it 3 times, and am about to make it again. Each and every time I have made it, it comes out perfectly. It is a bit more dense than some other cakes, but not all cakes are supposed to be light and fluffy.

I have read some other low star reviews, and a lot of them seem to talk about how they are great bakers and such. Never start off, or trust a, review that starts off with them boasting about themselves.They continue to say that the cake smells and/or tastes like egg, which I have never experienced when making this cake. All I smell and taste is a sweetened orange flavor.

In my opinion, definitely make this cake. It turns out great.

I finally found my favorite yellow cake batter!!! I have tried several recipes for yellow cake on this site and they all baked up way too dense. Dense is fine if I want a pound cake or decorating tiers but not for a simple moist cake. My kids loved it!! I swear I taste only buttery goodness but the recipe had not one drop of butter. The sweetness was divine and the icing I made up didn't get used because the cake was tasty without it.  I don't know why some people had horrible outcomes but I followed the recipe exactly using freshly squeezed oranges for the juice. I have been using this site for a few years now and feel so excited to finally have a EASY yellow cake recipe to use from here on out!!! Can you say "HAPPYYYYYYYYYY?!

I really like this cake. It is not a really light cake. I cut back the sugar 1/2 cup and cut back the oil to 3/4 cup. Other than that no other alterations. It came out excellent. My family loves it. I topped it with a whipped cream frosting I made myself, to which I added peanut butter to flavor since my family loves peanut butter. You could easily make this in two round cake pans as a layer cake with a filling of your choice. I will use this from now on.

I followed the instructions exactly, and while I liked the flavor of this cake, it is unusable as a yellow cake.  It was dense, sticky, and had crusted edges.  I used it instead as a "short cake" with some strawberries and whipped cream.

I am not an expert cook or baker, so when I bake especially new recipes I must follow the directions perfectly.  I did, and this cake turned out great!  It's moist and did not crumble at all.  I'm always amazed at reviewers who change or modify recipes then complain that it didn't turn out or they didn't like it.  I don't quite know why so many people had problems, but for me it was easy and tasty.  I didn't use frosting.  I drizzled orange juice mixed with a little powdered sugar over the top and it was wonderful.  I did use a glass 9 X 13 pan so maybe that made a difference.  This recipe is going in my keeper file for sure!  Thanks for posting it.

I made a pineapple upside down cake with this recipe, and it was perfect!! I cut the oil to 3/4 cup, used 1 less egg, and used the pineapple juice  (from the pineapple can) instead of orange juice. Nice and moist, with a nice flavor. Super easy, too. I'll use this recipe often!

Finally!!! I made this cake a few months ago for a friends birthday and it got amazing reviews so when I wanted to bake a birthday cake for my son I searched for this one. Unfortunately I couldn't find it anywhere. I searched for an hour until thankfully I found it. Yes, it's THAT good. Moist, dense, and simple. Just the way I like it! Thanks

This cake is very different, kind of funky but edible. my husband and kids all rated it "different" i added a couple more cups of flour to the batter because of how watery it was. its very moist, and has a citrusy flavor. my daughter decided to dye the batter pink, just for fun and it almost ALMOST could fool you if we labeled it a raspberry cake ;) we used a homeade chocolate frosting and that turned out good. i probably wont use this recipe again, but like i said, its edible.

This cake was not to my liking!!! DO NOT BAKE THIS. I made the cake the night before a Superbowl party and it got stuck in the pan and got stuck. I was soooo glad that I didn't serve it to my guests.

I read reviews b4 cooking so I made a few adjustments:cut sugar to 1 1/2 cups-oil to 1/2 cup.2 eggs..baked really nice but not a deep cake --should be baked in 9x9 or 12 cupakes...taste good but will add addtl teasp. of vanilla next time-easy cake and wanted to use the ingredients I had at the house ..I will use again if I need a cake in a pinch made caramel icing so it was great with this cake it was the starring role. 4 stars bucuz of ease

This was not a good recipe!  We made cupcakes and they did not cook through the center.  There was way too much sugar and they crumbled into pieces.

The cake didn't rise properly so the presentation wasn't good so I gave it 4 stars. I had to improvise a bit and ended up using soymilk in place of orange juice and orange extract in place of vanilla. The changes went over well-it had a great flavor and there wasn't any leftover!

I made this cake bc I had all the ingredients already. I liked it very much it is very moist, since I didn't have any oj i used fruit punch. I did find the cake very sweet so I did not frost it  next time I will use less sugar and maybe a little less oil.

ok, there's a good chance this was my fault. I tried to use the recipe for cupcakes, and they completely collapsed. they didn't taste terrible (a little eggy, as others have said) but i liked the citrus tones.... it may have been my oven, which is old and shady : (

Not a bad recipe. It was a little eggy with three eggs, I am glad I didnt use four as the recipe called for. It is a basic cake I will definatly make again. I didn't find the orange juice to be strong , it was a nice flavor. topped with white frosting and fresh blueberries made a nice refreshing dessert.

If you expect this to turn out like a store bought boxed cake mix you will be disappointed. If you are looking for something slightly unusual and distinctive, you will be satisfied. I ony used 3 eggs and omitted the OJ. It tastes almost like sugar cookies and yes, it does have a crispy "crust" but that just adds to the uniqueness of this cake. YUMMY!

It broke apart, but I think that was my fault. Otherwise it was quite good. It did smell a little eggy as it was baking but it didn't taste that way. I separated the layers with apricot jam -- yum. The orange didn't come through as much as I would have liked, so next time I might omit one of the eggs.

Very good - moist, sticky and "citrus-y." I selected this recipe because I was very low on milk, and this recipe doesn't call for any.  But it is different. I have not tried baking this in round pans and decorating with the usual frosting. Instead, I bake this in a 9x13 casserole and add a thin glaze made from powdered sugar, milk and a little orange extract.

This was quite sweet but was very good.  My 13 year-old daughter made it by herself and, since we were out of orange juice (and she's a picky eater) we used water instead.  She baked it in the giant Wilton cupcake pan and it made enough batter (very runny, as all have said) to fill both the top (frosting side) and the bottom (the cupcake part) of the pan.  We'd make it again, but maybe add 1/2 c. less sugar.  The outside had a nice chewy, crispy texture that made it similar to a quenelle.

YUM!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!  Great texture, taste and they were moist.  I made 18 cupcakes.  The first review I read almost discouraged me from making the recipe, I'm glad I made it.  To that reviewer that said it was eggy, maybe you used extra large eggs?  Maybe use one less if your eggs are huge.  The oj for me wasn't  overwhelming, I used Minute Maid that my kids drink. The badder had a good flavor too.

Great way to use up oranges. My brother has an orange tree so I needed a way to use up aging oranges.  I blended 8 oranges and poured a full cup of the “smoothie” instead of just 3/4 cup of oj.

The cake turned out perfectly for me. I however did make multiple alterations to the recipe.
Firstly I used a lot less sugar, just a little more than half of what was required. Secondly, I used less oil. 
Thirdly, I mixed half the yellow batter into melted chocolate and made a VANILLA-CHOCOLATE marble cake instead of a plain yellow cake.
It worked out fine. It wasn't too sweet or too dense, so I'm glad I cut down on the quantity of sugar and oil. Light and soft. It rose in my oven splendidly. And was easy to make. I'd say I might make it again.

I can't believe I haven't rated this yet, because I have used it multiple times - as is and as the base recipe for my version of Sunshine Cake. It's a great cake for icing, and the delicate orange flavour comes through even better the next day.

I was making a pineapple upside down cake and realized I did not have a cake mix so I pulled this up and gave it a try.  I will not use this one again.  It is far too dense and the flavor of egg is very strong.  If or some reason, you need a dense cake, maybe for cake pops, this is fine.  However, for a fluffy cake, this is not the one to make.

The cake was made exactly as stated and I decreased the baking time by 10 minutes.   

The flavor was okay, however it was oily, too sweet, and the very edges were just like a candy.  I am going to try this recipe again by;  increasing the flour 1/2 cup, decreasing the sugar by 3/4 cup, and decreasing the oil by 1/2 cup.  I'll let you know how it turns out.

I made it with 1/3 cup less sugar and just three eggs. I made cupcakes, which yielded 24, and were done in 20 minutes in a 180 degree C oven.  They came out very nice-looking -- slightly brown on top in an appetizing way. I used the specified amount of fresh orange juice, but I had been looking forward to more of an orange taste. My cupcakes were pleasant but I didn't feel "Wow!"

Seems like it would actually fit a recipe better for a pineapple upside down cake.  I had to pull it out of the oven 15 minutes before the suggested time because it got very crusty.  It's extremely dense. I was not expecting this.  Maybe my error for not recognizing the hints.

Followed the recipe to the T. It came out super eggy like other people said. Ended up cutting it up into small squares and put it out with jam and butter. Was like a cakey biscuit.

This is not a light and fluffy cake! 

With that being said.....I loved it. Its dense and moist, not too citrusy, and definatly hit the spot! I made it just as the recipe states. I added a light layer of butter frosting.

Super simple recipe. Definitely not for decorating (or serving to guests), as it's too moist to turn out and has a lovely crunchy top that acts as a topping. Most recommended for a cake that's easy to make, has common ingredients and is for serving to the family. BTW it freezes well as well.

I followed the recipe except to swap out whole wheat pastry flour and barley flour for the all-purpose to add a little more nutrition and I made cupcakes instead of a cake.  They came out totally sunken down in the middle and were very hard and chewy around the edges.  Probably won't try this recipe again.  They did have a good flavor though, and I even cut the sugar to only 1 and a half cups instead of 2.  Two cups would have been WAY too sweet!

This cake did not turn out good at all! The flavor was okay so I used it as a base for strawberry shortcake. It stuck to the pan and was crumbly. I hate to give low reviews but I will not be using this recipe again. Save your time.

I tried this recipe despite the negative views of a few.  I loved it.  It had no egg taste or heavy orange flavor.  In fact, I don't know if you would even know it was orange.  I made an orange glaze for a topping, but I want to use this for strawberry short cake and also with chocolate frosting.  I did beat my eggs well before adding and then beat the batter well.  I used Braum's orange juice which is not strong and large eggs that looked medium to me.  Since the cake did not mound you could cut it in half and frost a square cake.  I had to make myself stop eating this cake it was so moist and tasty.

My new pot luck "go-to" cake!  It is as easy as mixing up a pan of brownies.  The 45 min baking time is spot on.  I love a recipe that just works the way it should.

I poured the batter from this recipe over fresh peaches and made "Peach Cobbler".  It was amazing.  I'll always make it this way now.

I signed up with Allrecipes just so I could review this poor maligned recipe.
I've made this twice, once with the OJ (though I diluted it slightly) and once with 1 tsp lemon extract in place of vanilla and 1/2 lemon juice, 1/2 water in place of the OJ.  
The batter is very runny, but it bakes up beautifully.  Resist the temptation to add flour!  I've used 2 9-inch rounds to make a layer cake.  The texture is great and the flavor is delicious.  Make sure to mix thoroughly for a few minutes to fully incorporate all of the eggs.

I used this recipe to make a pineapple upside-down cake, so I replaced the orange juice with pineapple juice.  It turned out fairly bland even with the added pineapple and brown sugar topping. I think I'll keep looking for a good yellow cake recipe.
