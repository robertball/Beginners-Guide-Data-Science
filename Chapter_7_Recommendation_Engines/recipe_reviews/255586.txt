I made this recipe yesterday.  The blend of flavors and the sweet contrasted against the spicy makes for an explosion of goodness with every bite.   The longer the chilli sits, the better the flavors blend.  Made this for a Boy Scouts chilli coof-off and it was very well received.  Many comments about how I was "cheating" with all the tasty bacon inside.
