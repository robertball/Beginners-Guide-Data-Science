I found the amount of liquid called for to be way too much. One can of soup and 2/3 cup of water should be sufficient. 

I will try it again with less liquid.

My boyfriend absolutely LOVED this.  I thought it was pretty good as well.  I was stranded at home with a broken down car, so I really had to improvise with this one.  I don't usually have canned French onion soup on hand, so my intent was to use a Lipton soup packet.  Turns out, I was out of that too, so I had to make my own (2T + 2tsp dried minced onion; 1tsp onion powder; 4 beef bouillon cubes; 1/4tsp celery salt).  I tried this recipe with brown rice (cooking for 50 minutes instead of 25) and only used 2 cups of water, due to other reviewers suggestions.  This will definitely be made again in this household, only next time, I'll try the full amount of liquid as my rice came out a little crunchy (that's the brown rice talking, though).

Brwoning the rice in margerine or butter before you cook it is very important--it gives the rice a sticky texture and a yummy flavor. You could use a little less water. With the 2 cups called for, I had to let it cook for at least 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for. Next time I will use a little more rice or a little less water. It was a super easy and simple but very tasty rice side dish.

This was fine but I can think of more sophisticated side dishes to make.  Since onion soup concentrate has beef extract (and I am vegetarian) I simply used 10.75 oz. boiling water (the amount in a can) and added vegetarian onion soup mix to it to create my own concentrate.  Pepper makes it more tasty!

I love this rice and have been looking for a recipe like this for a long time.  Based on other reviews and what I had on hand I made the following changes:  I used Uncle Bens converted rice, browned it in about 3-4 tblsp of butter along with a small chopped onion, used the full 2 cups of water with 4 beef boullion cubes, then combined with chopped portabello mushrooms (amount to your liking) and put in a 9x13 casserole and baked uncovered in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes, stirring the mixture twice while baking.  Has a wonderful texture and flavor.  Served this with marinated chicken kabobs from this website.  Fabulous!

This is a good rice recipe and is very easy and simple to make.  It's an excellent rice dish for a bbq.  May I make two suggestions for this recipe: 1. cut by half the amount of water and 2. add finely chopped green onion.  I will definitely make this recipe for another bbq down the road.

This was very bland and very beige. It lacked any quality that would make me want to make it again.

I took some of the other reviewers' advice and used less water. I partly used the water from the can of mushrooms as well as regular water equalling to 2/3 cup. I think I might use more next time even though the rice still came out great. My family devoured it!

Not having any french onion soup, I used cream of onion.  I also used chicken stock instead of water.  It was great.

This recipe is even more flavorful if instead of the two cups of water, you add a can of beef consomme soup. I have found one cup of rice, 1 can french onion soup, 1 can beef consomme, the mushrooms, and the butter slices on the top to melt while cooking makes this incredible.  I think the 2 cups of water would water it down too much....try replacing that with one can beef consomme and your guests will go wild!

I prepared this recipe for the first time yesterday as a side dish for pork ribs.  My family absolutely loved it.  It was quick and easy to make.  I will for sure make it again.

I used an 18 oz can of Progresso French Onion soup, didn't drain the mushrooms, and added no water. It was the perfect consistency and tasted very good. (My picky roommate ate 2 full bowls.) It's well worth the limited effort and simplicity. Will make again, trying wild rice for a change of pace.

Very easy and tasty! I used brown rice and I cut up a small onion and browned it with the rice. I think it needs some garlic!

used butter, basmati rice, the soup and the mushroom juice and that alone was the the perfect amount of liquid. the texture was perfect. I added sliced almonds and some parsley to "make it my own." adding 2 more cups of water would have maybe helped the flavor but would certainly ruin the texture. the soup alone cost me $1.36, plus the shrooms. would have better off using a package rice mix with probably better results. sorry.

I have this recipe, but it's just a little different.  My family loves it!  I use 1 stick of butter (cut up) instead of 2 T. & 1 can of chicken broth (instead of 2c. water).  Everyone asks for the recipe!  Dump it all into an oblong, uncovered dish and bake at 350 for 45 minutes.

This definitely made a side of rice more of a feature, but we weren't blown away by it. I used Campbell's condensed French Onion soup, and fresh mushrooms. Not bad.

This dish was delicious, and very easy to make.  I would have liked it to have a little more onion and beef flavor, but the slight blandness of the dish actually worked well with the very rich and strong flavors of the entree I served.  I'll make this again, it's a perfect accompaniment to strongly flavored entrees.  If I make this with a bland entree, I'll add more seasoning/flavor/onion to give it some punch.
