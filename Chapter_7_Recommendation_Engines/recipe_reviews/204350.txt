Note on the cilantro - Do not puree or you will end up with green rice.  To avoid this chop by hand (do not add to blender).  If you end up with "green rice" it still tastes great, but kids aren't as quick to eat it. :) This bit of the instuctions was missed after the editing process.

I enjoyed the recipe very much; my family ate plenty. The recipe is good as is.  However, I did find the rice to be a bit onthe soggy side.  I will try a few alterations to see if that helps.  First, I will brown the rice a bit before added the other ingredients  Also, I will not put the other ingreadients in the food processor, I will just chop small.  Lastly, I will have the cilantro at the end to keep the color and flavor fresh.

This was a very tasty rice dish. I made as written, except using standard rice as opposed to instant. It was a nice accompaniment to the broiled tilapia that I had marinated in olive oil, lime juice, cilantro, chili peppers, etc. We did top the rice with some shredded cheddar which gave the rice a little more depth. I will keep this recipe in rotation. Thanks for sharing!

This was awesome!  Just like the kind you get at Mexican restaurants!!  I agree with some others that you need to *pulse* the cilantro in the food processor (added last) or it chops too fine.  I also left off the 1 Tbl. butter to keep it healthy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fresh and flavorful recipe!  I was looking for a rice dish using lime and cilantro to give a kick to our usual side of plain rice and this recipe fit the bill.  I made it just as stated, except I used fresh mild green chilis, omitted the bouillon to avoid MSG, and just added some salt to substitute.  I served it with homemade steak and black bean tostadas and fresh salsa, lettuce, and tomato from the garden.  I did put the cilantro in the blender because I didn't see the edit in the reviews, and it turned out great. The rice stayed white mixed with green flecks.  Maybe because I added the cilantro mix after most of the liquid had been absorbed by the rice, just before serving, by oversight.  I made this recipe a second time to serve a chicken dish made with a Southwest sauce and tortilla strips.  I wanted the chicken flavor that the bouillon in the original recipe would provide but again, wanted to avoid the preservatives and MSG so I used some defrosted chicken broth from my freezer in place of the water and added a bit of salt.  Thank you BCOLLINS1, we love this recipe!

Very tasty!  I made this to go with a chicken dish and it was a great compliment:  light, but very flavorful.  I did leave out the green chiles for my children.

Good! I had a recipe similar to this years ago and lost it, and I've been looking for a replacement ever since. This recipe is close. The flavor is really good. I would suggest adding about 2 tsp of cumin. I use green onions. Now I need to adjust this to make less, since you end up with a ton of rice, but the leftovers would be good in burritos! Thanks - I'm glad to have this back in my rotation!

Very tasty! The puree smells so good and fresh. I accidentally added 7 ounces of green chilis instead of what was recomended so it turned out very spicy, but I liked it that way. Would definitely make again!

I try a lot of recipes on here and make a lot of alterations but this one was spot on.  I forgot the butter but it turned out perfect!!   LOVED IT!    I did use Jasmine rice and my rice steamer.

Amazing rice! I was skeptical since I'm not a big fan of instant rice. But this is very tasty. Perfect for taco night.

I did not have Instant rice or chicken bouillion, so I used regular rice and chicken broth instead of water.  We liked this, Thanks.

Was absolutely delicious.  Like other recipes definitely add the cilantro in later.  Add more chiles for extra flavor! Don't be scared of the green color. : )

Easiness rating is a 5. I didn't have bouillon granules, so I used chicken flavor broth to make the rice. I made this once with rice, and then I used this same recipe, but replaced the rice with tofu.

We made this even more easy, but kept with the same premise of the recipe.  I had to make this on the fly as a side.  I did only half for just my husband and I.  I basically cooked 1.5 C of instant rice using 1.5C of chicken stock and 1/2 tbsp of butter.  I juiced half a lime, and after the rice was done and "fluffed", I added that in.  Used about 2 tsp of dry cilantro, added in the zest of half of the lemon and 1/2 tsp of salt.  It was DELICIOUS.  Perfect pairing with our shredded pork tacos.  I will definitely make this again, probably as-written though :)

Left out the chilies. Cut up everything and put in the rice cooker. (two cups rice per liquid at the 2 line on rice cooker.) Family loved it!

Yum! No kids in my house so I used jalapenos for the green chiles. I added the cilantro as directed and gently pulsed it to my liking.  I liked the way this rice complimented my enchilada entrée with nice citrus and chile kick.  On my next attempt I'll add some frozen peas/carrots to increase the vegetable factor to the meal.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Good flavor and zangy.  Not mind blowing but still good.  I used healthier brown rice and perhaps that was the issue.  I saved half the mixture on the side because there were only two of us eating it and I didn't want to make that much rice.  We actually used the chile pepper mixture as a salsa on some other dishes and it is SO good!

My whole family loved this!  I made this to go with blue corn chips for a card party.  I'm lucky the dish made it there.  LOL!  The only thing I changed was I used frozen corn instead of corn on the cob (out of season) and I baked it in the oven instead of the grill.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this last night with enchiladas for out-of-town family, this was delicious!!! I think I overcooked the rice a bit but it was still delicious. Very easy and fresh tasting. Found that the cilantro wasn't overbearing at all as it can be in some foods.
