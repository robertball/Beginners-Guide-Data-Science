This does take some time to prepare, so plan accordingly.  Actually, for my mushrooms to reach the color in the video, it took a solid 30+ minutes at a low temp.  BUT, don't rush because this step brings richness and enhances the depth of flavor in the soup.  I halved the recipe and used an immersion blender (instead of a blender) which emulsified the soup to a creamy texture.  Very nice and a little decadent :-)

This recipe and the result is outstanding. My family, including the children ate it up and my son-in-law ate 4 bowls of it! Take care, however. No way this takes only 15 minutes of prep time. I had to use 6 boxes of fresh mushroom, which took what seemed forever to clean and slice (sliced mushrooms not available where I live.) Next time I will buy the largest mushrooms I can find to cut down on the prep time substantially. I don't know how Chef John got his mushrooms carmelized in just 15 minutes; it took mine a lot, lot longer, but they are wonderful when done. The only thing I did at the end was add more stock. The soup came out thick as mud, and while I like very thick soups, this was beyond thick. The flavor is absolutely delicious. If you love mushrooms and want to feel like a professional chef, make this soup. Outstanding recipe, Chef John!

Great recipe!  Easy to make, too. I bought sliced mushrooms which made the preparation easy. Made exactly by instructions and it was fantastic.  I think the secret is the roux and cooking the mushrooms to a golden brown. This made for a very rich flavor.  Achieving the golden brown only took about 15 minutes as the instructions said.   Based on similar mushroom soup recipes, I think you could cut down the hour simmering time if you are  pushed for time. Next time I will experiment with adding a little more flour to make it slightly thicker and I may add a little Sherry.

Very good mushroom soup recipe!  I've made it a few times now.  Each time I've added a little sherry.  I also like to adapt this recipe to that of a favorite restaurant's mushroom curry soup.  They serve it with a dollop of orange marmalade in the bottom of the bowl. Really delicious! I add curry powder (1-2 Tbsp) while simmering mushrooms/onions. I really like this recipe as-is but LOVE it with the curry & sherry.

Love me some  Chef John.  Normally, I don't change or tweak his recipes, and that's saying a lot for me 'cause I tweak everybody's recipe.  In this case, I accidently tweaked.  

The mushrooms caramelized for almost an hour because my ADHD self spotted a squirrel or chicken or something and forgot to get back to the pot.  It worked out though. 

No fresh thyme. Went to my herb garden and the squirrel or chicken or something ate the thyme so I used the dry stuff that comes in a jar.  

Some white wine may have fallen out of the bottle I was drinking and into the soup pot.   It happens...

The last tweak, I admit to doing on purpose.  Black Truffle Oil... just a tiny drizzle.  Amazing, but very little goes a long way.

I tasted as I cooked and before tweaking so I can honestly say the recipe really is perfect exactly as written.

Very good.  Right before I served it, I added a couple of teaspoons of quality Balsamic vinegar and it gave it such a wonderful rich flavor.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This was absolutely wonderful!  Takes time (it did take more than 15 minutes to cook out moisture and caramelize the mushrooms, closer to 30 minutes, but the end result was so worth it.)  I know I will get requests for this often...and my fabulous cook of a daughter-in-law (who also loved it) is anxious for the recipe too.

This recipe takes time but is worth the effort. I used a mixture of crimini and shiitake mushrooms. I can't eat cream so I added lactose-free milk with a bit of corn starch.

This recipe is an outstanding delicious masterpiece when prepared exactly as written. A wonderful flavor and consistency that I never found in any other mushroom soup. I did substitute frozen mushrooms in lieu of fresh which worked out well without affecting anything. The next time I will be using dehydrated mushrooms since I buy fresh in 100lb lots. I also used "Bobs Red Mill" quinoa flour to avoid Frankenfood GMOs. I found the prep and cooking times to be perfect. Chef John really nailed this one.

Superb mushroom soup! I made a roux of 2 Tbsp butter and 2 Tbsp flour instead of just adding flour. I didn't have fresh thyme and instead added 1 tsp of dried thyme. I also added 1 Tbsp of sherry at the end. I will double the recipe next time. It wasn't enough for us. Yummy!

Off the hook goodness. After adding the water and chx broth I added 8oz of sliced golden oak shitakes that needed to be cooked out of my fridge and that just put this recipe over the edge. This was a 6 star cook.

Thank you John!
     This is a carbon copy of the recipe my beloved father-in-law taught me. As I entered his kitchen some 40 years ago, my primordial baby was filled with joy as Mr. Glenn Roughmbo's shroom soup enveloped me.
     Years later, I felt that to change his majic blend would be desecration. But... May I suggest at the end of cooking....
Summer add a dash of lemon zest.
Winter add a dash of worscestershire sauce. 
Thanx again for sharing

Wonderful for mushroom lovers. I like to vary it by using a mix of wild mushrooms such as enoki, shiitake, oyster, and, if I can find them, chanterelles. But if these are unavailable or just too expensive, regular white mushrooms will work just fine. Just before serving, I like to add a tablespoon or two of dry Sherry or Madeira. Again, not a deal breaker, just an enhancement of an already-fine recipe. A small spoon of sour cream makes a delicious garnish.

What a wonderful and tasty soup! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly as Chef John described it in his video. The only difference was that I used a little bit more butter and about another 5 ounces of mushrooms so that after they were cooked down to that golden brown,  I not only had enough mushrooms to garnish the soup but I also chopped the rest up into tiny pieces and introduced them back to the soup to have a little bit of mushroom to chew on with each bite. Not only was this recipe amazing to eat, it warms the house with wonderful smells and aromas! Take your time when getting the mushrooms golden brown. It's worth every minute to truly give this soup AMAZING taste profile! Chef john.... yet another hit! My family could not get enough! (Might have to make a double batch next time!)

Fantastic mushroom soup! Kudos to Chef John who once again came through with winner. I made it exactly as written and was amazed at how deep and wonderful the flavors were. I am a cream of mushroom soup lover and this was the best I have ever had. Can't wait to make it again, might just go to the market right now to get some mushrooms....
UPDATE: I finally have an immersion blender and it made this so easy-peasy! Pretty sure I'll be making often, especially during winter...a true comfort food! If you like mushrooms, give it a try, you won't be disappointed. Gotta admit, I've been looking for reasons to use my dry sherry, may give it a try next time...

Fabulous! My husband raved, the only thing I changed was to use white wine in place of the 1 cup of water. But I did use a hand blender in the pot. And you must make a double batch, because you will want more!

I made this soup again yesterday and had a bit of an epiphany. When the mushrooms had given up all their juices I was struck that all the wonderful 'shroom juice was going to go into vapor as I waited for the mushrooms for caramelize.  So I strained the 'shrooms and kept the juice to add back later with the chicken broth. This also slashed the amount of cooking time. The added back 'shroom broth really boosted the overall flavor.

This is a very good recipe as is, but I deducted a star (perhaps unfairly) because I do think it can be improved upon. After the first time, I reserve about 1/4 of the cooked mushrooms for a coarse chop so there is at least a bit of mushroom texture in the soup, increased the flour (I use GF) to 2 Tbsp, and replaced the water with a cup of a good white wine.

This was awesome. I usually follow Chef John's recipes exactly, but didn't have the heavy cream so used canned milk and didn't puree completely because we like some mushroom chunks. But I have made this a couple of times and we just love it!

This has become a staple in my household. Absolutely fantastic. I used baby bella mushrooms from Costco and sliced them in my food processor in a couple of minutes and then chopped the onion in the food processor. That way the whole prep only took a few minutes. Mine browned nicely within 15 minutes. They still had some juice in the pot but I went on to the next step and feel that it does not make much difference. I used 1% milk instead of cream and processed the soup in my vitamix which made it super creamy. I always eat some the next day as left over and it still tastes great. Only minor thing I don't like is the color but for home made super delicious soup that's easy to make it's well worth it.

Another awesome recipe from my favorite chef!!  I do have a confession: I did put a cup of white wine in it for kicks.  Also used an abundance of assorted dried Asian mushrooms,  2 portobellos and the standard white  type.  With all those mushrooms I did add more cream. 
Absolutely loved it!  
Mahalo from Maui! I'm a transplant from the city!!!!

Because of the simple list of ingredients, I thought this soup would not be very flavorful. I was mistaken. I made this recipe exactly as written and found it to be surprisingly tasty. I think the thyme really added some depth to the mushrooms.

I made this recipe again and added in a package of assorted dried mushrooms for a more earthy flavor and an extra clove of garlic. I re-hydrated the mushrooms and used a cup of the liquid from soaking in place of the one cup of water. This recipe didn't need sherry or balsamic. It really needed the time for the mushrooms to cook slowly.  That is a huge step in this recipe.

Good grief I could die now and be happy this is such good soup!  Substituted half and half for the heavy cream and it turned out great.  Also I rinsed my mushrooms which added a solid half hour to the sauteeing stage where you can add the onion.  Now I know to take the time and just wipe the mushrooms with a damp cloth and not to get them wet.  Also you can just roughly chop the mushrooms since theyre all getting pureed anyway don't spend the time on useless precision.  I have never made better soup thank you Chef John!

I've loved every Chef John recipe I've made and this is no exception.  The only minor thing I will change the next time I make it is to add the garlic cloves to the mushroom mixture at the same times the diced onions are added, I think browning the garlic makes it more flavorful.  

I had a craving for mushroom soup and this recipe delivered!

I need to find a bigger and better word for Chef John than "magnificent" because I'm sure he's just getting tired of all the accolades!  An example of that would be this recipe.  Best mushroom soup I have ever made as verified by the 3 people that ate it.  The only addition I made is adding 1/4 teaspoon of dried jalapeno peppers because I tend to like a little heat in what I eat.

I read another review where someone said they were in love with Chef John.  Let me know where the line is forming so I can go too!!!

Thanks again,

Petra-

Fist off I LOVE MUSHROOMS so this was a dish I really wanted to try.  As far as flavor it didn't disappoint. But, this was more like a 2 hour production, not 1:35, so I took it down a star. It took longer for my mushrooms to cook off the water and caramelize. THANK YOU Chef John for clear and concise instructions otherwise!   It WAS very tasty!  I loved it, but my family was so-so, their palates being young and not appreciative of the two hours I put into the dish!  :/  My only substitution was to use ground thyme instead of the sprigs as I didn't have the fresh thyme. Still worked great. This takes way too long for me to consider using it in place of canned cream of mushroom soup, but on a cold winter night, with cheesy toast and salad it was a wonderful dinner.

This is a great mushroom soup. Julia Child recommends this way of browning mushrooms to intensify their flavor in The Art... (classic French prep), and Chef John brings the technique to life here. It's brilliant. Take the time to do this as described here, as elsewhere with Chef John. He's a generous, wonderful teacher you can trust.

Sub fat free half and half for the heavy cream and this gets MUCH healther with little change in taste.  Used a mix of fresh mushroom types, 1.5 pounds of white button and 0.5 pound of a shiitake, oyster, and portabella blend.  The 15 minutes indicated in the recipe for reducing the mushroom liquid is about half, to a third, of the time it really takes; so, be prepared to spend the time. I also used unsalted chicken broth to help reduce the sodium.  It turned out very well; a nice deep mushroom flavor and the thyme was just enough. Thank you Chef for the inspiration. Will, absolutley, make this again.

Great flavour and much easier than other mushroom soup recipes I have used before. I liked not having to waste time making a proper roux.
I made it with portobellos and shitakes  and made it healthier and vegetarian by only using 1 tbsp of butter with 1 tbsp of olive oil, and substituted whole meal flour, vegetable stock and skimmed milk and it still came out delicious and super thick and creamy with an intoxicating fragrance.

Excellent soup!  Creamy, delicious, rich in flavour.  I made a couple of changes due to lack of ingredients:
1) Substituted 2 cups of whole milk for the cup of water and cup of heavy cream, and 2)
Substituted herbes de Provence for thyme (I don't like thyme).  

I pureed 2/3 of the soup and left the rest of the mushrooms un-blended, which gave it a wonderful texture.  Fabulous!

Excellent recipe!  Best mushroom soup I've ever had.  Period.  The only changes were to add 1/2 cup sherry and to reserve more mushrooms to add after blending,  just because I like a chunkier soup.  Need to try this with fresh morels and leeks next spring!

Perfect! Just what I want in a cream of mushroom soup. This was truly restaurant quality while being super-easy to make. Giving the mushrooms enough time to caramelize is key. I only made half the recipe and used a pinch of dried thyme instead of fresh. I also didn't have chicken stock and hate using the mix, so I used regular water and upped the black pepper. It was truly perfect - Chef John has never let me down! Thanks for this amazing recipe!

This is delicious, just like most of chef john's recipes. I didn't change anything, next time I will make a little thicker, but that is just personal preference. I would definitely use this in cooking in place of canned soups as well.

This soup is fantastic! I used dried thyme instead of fresh because it’s all I had on hand, and I thickened it by simmering it down rather than using the flour. I will definitely make it again!

My creminis took over an hour to caramalize. Sherry is required, 2 Tbsp at the very least, to deglaze the pan. 1-2 Tbsp curry powder added while mushrooms simmer - Wowie! A dollop of orange marmalade in the bottom of the bowl.  (Balsamic vinegar will sub for Sherry.)

I used this recipe when first learning how to make cream of mushroom soup from scratch and it was excellent. I've since made it enough times to adjust and tweak it to my own preferences and it's just awesome. Most recently I used homemade beef broth instead of chicken and added roasted garlic powder to the caramelized onions and only 1/2 cup of heavy cream. It was amazing. Just popping back in here to say thank you for the base recipe, Chef John!

Mushroom Soup is probably my favorite soup to enjoy so I was very happy to have been able to make it myself. The steps were very easy to follow though it does take some time from start to finish. The taste was amazing and would be very easy to tweak to our own preference. Next time I'll try making it with mushroom stock to make it a vegetarian dish.

love the method of slow cooking the mushrooms to achieve the wonderful flavour that come out. I adjusted spices - increased the thyme and pepper, and a bit of soy sauce with some red wine. (I wish I had sherry) also added a bit of cream cheese at the end.

I made it according to the recipe but used different mushrooms.  It turned out wonderful!  I have this thing about using canned soup, so I made this to pour over some pork butt steaks to bake in the oven.  It was a huge success!  I honestly think you can use any flavorful mushrooms for this.  We have an abundance of oyster mushrooms right now in the woods around here, so I used those.  Absolutely delicious!  This will be my go-to mushroom soup recipe from here on out.  In future, I will definitely try adding a little sherry, especially when actually serving as soup.  Thanks for sharing this with us, chef!

Cream of mushroom soup, even from a can, is a delicious ingredient used in many recipes. The problem is even the lower sodium canned soups are incredibly high in sodium.  I decided to begin trying different recipes to find one I liked. This is it. I made the recipe exactly as presented. Granted it took a while but the result was likely the best cream of mushroom soup I've ever tasted. I've now made this recipe several times, precisely as directed and wouldn't change a thing. It's truly spectacular. The health bonus is it's quite low in sodium which means I'm not as limited on other ingredients in whatever meal I'm preparing. This also works perfectly when used in recipes calling for cream of mushroom soup. Just remember, this isn't condensed so adjust your recipe accordingly.  I rushed one batch and found the flavor just wasn't there. That may explain the comments mentioning a lack of flavor. This isn't something to be rushed. Allow the flavors to grow by not being impatient.

Didn't use any thickening agent since so many of my friends are glutards and subtracted the 1C H2O and it thickened up nicely. Added about 1/4tsp Allspice and it really made it nice! I think later I'll add sherry to "sweeten" it.

Simple. So delicious. You do need some patience, and maybe some experience in cooking and making soups from scratch. 
This was a lot easier than my baked potato soup and less time consuming than any gumbo. 
We used all olive oil as I forgot butter from the store. 
Wait for the broth to reduce before mixing then adding your heavy cream. I have never had a mushroom soup. I have never been so satisfied in all of my life with such a simple soup. I will make this and share it for years to come. 
We added about a teaspoon of red chili flakes as well for some kick. I used fresh rosemary instead of thyme.

Excellent!  Like some of the other reviewers, it took much longer than stated to caramelize the onions.  2+hours for the whole thing.  I added a dollop of white truffle oil before serving.  Gave it another dimension!

Wonderful recipe; great flavor and nice consistency. 
I added more garlic (6 cloves) and did not have quite enough mushrooms as called for in the recipe and it still turned out great! First time ever making mushroom soup and I will definitely add this recipe to my winter soup roster.

I made the recipe as directed.  I used fresh spanish thyme instead of the regular thyme cause I grow it and  still it was amazing! It took forever for the juices from the mushrooms to evaporate in the first steps, but it was worth the wait! The only complaint I have is that it wasn't enough!

This soup was fantastic and turned out great even though I'm a novice at cooking. It was creamy and had so much flavor. Cooking the mushrooms until the juices evaporate seems like a critical step and took closer to 35 minutes for me (rather than the suggested 15). I used an immersion blender to puree the soup in the pan only because the transfer step could have easily ended in disaster for me. I honestly think you would get a better texture with a regular blender, but the soup was so good that I didn't care. Yay Chef John!

It was really good. I'll make it again. I did make a couple of changes though. I used coconut milk instead of cream. I  like to avoid adding adding all the dairy and fat when ever possible. I also use about three tablespoons of rice as a thickener  instead of the flower.

Delicious!  I didn't have thyme twigs so used dried thyme in a spice shaker for both soup and garnish.  Also substituted cream out for 3/4 cup 2% milk + 1/3 cup butter.   Also used beef broth instead of chicken.   It came out amazingly well!

Amazingly sophisticated without the sophisticated time and hassle. I made it as is, with the exception of adding a splash of sherry prior to adding the flour. Wonderful recipe and well worth the effort. Yummy!

Made it for Thanksgiving. The guests couldn't get enough of it and whatever leftovers I had, they insisted on taking home with them. I followed the recipe pretty closely other than substituting half and half for the whipping cream. Caramelizing the mushrooms is the secret and the house just smelled heavenly. If I could give it 10 stars, I would!

Cooked the mushroom and onions together for a little more than 15 minutes, all liquid was gone by then (cooked on low heat).  When I added the garlic cloves, I added my fresh young thyme leaves only and didn't remove the thyme.  I ended simmering it for 75 minutes, I forgot about it and by then the liquid had reduced by half.  While mixing it in our vitamix, I added about 3 cups of chicken broth.  Back into saucepan with whipping cream and reheated it on low heat till hotter.  Delish!  Didn't have to add any salt or pepper to it.  It's a keeper!

Excellent recipe. I omitted the flour (yet soup still needed to be thinned), doubled the sprigs of thyme, added 2T sherry, and a pinch of cayenne. Used equal a months of baby potabellos and shitakis. Served with French baguette & butter.

This soup is outstanding! The flavor is wonderful and rich. It was even better when reheated the next day. I agree with the other reviewers that it takes much longer than 15 minutes or so to sautée the mushrooms to caramelization. I used a combo of portobellos and white button and got mushrooms on sale that were a little 'ripe'. I think they added to the strong mushroom flavor. I will make this soup again and again. My family loved it as much as I did!

I am so thankful to Chef John for this recipe.  I have made it about 15 times and each time I further perfect the method.  I have used many combinations of mushrooms i.e. white button, shiitake, baby bella’s and a few delectable morels my dad picked while in Saskatchewan.  I add garlic powder, a little all purpose seasoning and flower of the ocean Celtic sea salt to finish.  I use my Vitamix to blend small batches to add back to the pot.   I now refuse to use canned mushroom soup for my green bean casseroles - this is the only mushroom soup that will do.  My four year old refuses to eat mushrooms but called this soup yummy.  My mother in law is a fabulous chef and requested for me to make this soup for Christmas.  It’s truly the bees knees.  XOXO!!!

I froze the soup before I added the cream.  After thawing and heating, I added the cream.  Fabulous!  Oh ya, I put in 1/4 cream sherry.

This is a decent basic recipe, but not a lot of flavor. Some Marsala wine or port, more garlic, more thyme, and some tarragon would help. Next time I would also saute the mushrooms in a skillet, so they get enough heat to caramelize; they were too crowded in the soup pot.

I cooked the mushrooms and onions a LONG time to really get all the flavor I could out of them but it was still lacking.  Maybe less cream and more seasonings next time.

Delicious soup!  I only used three large Portabella mushroom caps and I added a few extra cloves of garlic.  A few substitutions were necessary because I didn't have all the ingredients:  Two small onions instead of one yellow, dried thyme instead of fresh, and three tablespoons cornstarch mixed in one cup whole milk instead of heavy whipping cream.  I was worried about not having enough mushrooms in the soup but it had a good, strong mushroom flavor.  This is now my go-to recipe for mushroom soup.

This was absolutely fabulous!  I pretty much followed the recipe except that I used half and half.  Next time I think I will stop the vitamix a little sooner and allow a few little pieces of mushrooms. This soup is so good freshly made!   This is going into my best recipe collection!

First batch was SO good, even without thyme; also simmered it for just 30 min. I doubled recipe on 2nd try; learned that I must saute mushrooms + onions in 2 batches so they brown properly and mushroom liquid cooks away. Thanks for this easy recipe!

Did not use the thyme as my family doesn't like that flavor.  Otherwise, absolutely delicious.  Used a blend of mushrooms - oyster, portabello, button, and cremini.  It is now my go to recipe for mushroom soup.

Excellent recipe! Make when you have more time than it says.  The caramelizing and onion steps both took longer than expected.  I added loose tarragon because I didn't have cheesecloth. Worked well when I puréed with the hand blender.

I will certainly make this again. It was a bit of a show-stopper considering how simple it is. I made some minor changes but pretty much just followed as written. 

I used 5 TBSP of butter, 1 QT of Chicken Broth, 1 cup of water  with 1lb Shiitake and 1lb Cremini mushrooms. Added a ton of fresh ground black pepper, 4 minced garlic cloves, some finely chopped thyme, the yellow onion and about a teaspoon of sea salt to the reduction before blending. (As other cooks have noted, expect this to be 25-30 minutes) Let it reduce until there was very little liquid left before sprinkling in the flour and cooking another 3-5 minutes to brown this with the butter and remaining broth. After it was cooked and blended, returned it to the pan at low temp and added 2 cups of heavy cream with the suggested bundle of whole thyme sprigs. Brought to serving temp. (Maybe another 10 minutes total) Removed the thyme bundle. Rich, beautiful and bursting with flavor, a silky texture you don't expect from "mushroom soup". I served  this alongside a big loaf of olive bread and a salad. Made plenty for myself and 3 other guests; everyone loved it. I did not add the Sherry as suggested by some reviews but I imagine that would be a  great addition and I'll be sure to add it next time.

This soup is amazing, but expect it to take much longer than stated in the recipe.  Based on other reviews, I decided to cook my mushrooms down to the point where very little moisture remained, and this took nearly an hour on medium-low heat (electric stove) as compared to the 15 minutes that the recipe suggests.  However, it was well worth it, and I didn't need to hover over the mushrooms during this step.  Stopping by the kitchen for an occasional stir was all the attention they needed.  I also saved some time using an immersion blender at the end rather than transferring my soup to a blender for processing, saving clean-up time as well.  Aside from these details, I prepared exactly as written, grinding in fresh kosher salt and black pepper at the end.  Served with garlic bread, this soup was a delicious comfort meal.

This is a simple and delicious soup. The cooking time for the mushrooms is at least 2-3 times what the recipe states. Other than that it was yummy!

Chef John, your recipes never cease to amaze my taste buds.  Five stars and then some.  Your Mac n cheese recipe has been in my kitchen for a few years not and is always requested by my daughters and their friends.  Thank you for sharing.
Those reading the reviews, I used a combo of white, portobello and porcini mushrooms to enhance the flavor and threw in a porcini bullion cube.  I  served the soup with a large grilled portobello mushroom with melted cheese.  yum yum yum. Great alternative instead of having meat.

Excellent recipe ! so much flavour, this is now my go to for mushroom soup.The only thing I did differently was I removed some of the liquid when cooking the mushrooms, there was about a cup, continued to saute mushrooms and when started to brown I added back the liquid. Love Chef John's recipes!

This was a great mushroom soup recipe. Overall I was very pleased with the flavours and the way it turned out. 

A few key points:
- it takes a lot longer than 15 minutes on low heat to get all the mushroom  juices evaporated. I used a variety of mushrooms for this recipe but still stuck with 2lbs and I think it took 45 minutes or more to get the juices to evaporate
- it's a very thick soup and I added about an extra cup or chicken stock to it but realistically I think I could've added 2 cups
Other than that I followed the recipe to the tee. 
Definitely will make it again.

Great soup Chef. I think adding more mushrooms to the recipe and taking out around 1-1 1/2 cups with onions adding back in at the end for a "chunky" to give it a more comfort food texture.

Loved this soup. Super easy and so tasty.  Only changes I made were: sauteed mushrooms for 30 min instead of 15; added a little more garlic, used 5 cups chicken broth instead of 4 cups broth & 1 cup water; added 1/2 cup dry Sherry towards the end.  Served with chopped chives on top. YUM!!

Absolutely delicious!  Waiting for the mushrooms to lose all the liquid and caramelize took the longest time...more than half an hour, but it was so worth it.  The rest was easy, and I did add  3/4 Cup or so of dry red wine, before the hour of simmering, because it's all I had.  The soup broth is deep and brown, and after adding the cream, it still retained the mushroom flavor with a slight taste of the wine.

I didn't have any fresh thyme so I used my fresh rosemary springs. I put it in the broth for 3 minutes then pulled them out. Used baby potabella as well. Everything else was per the recipe. Just one more of Chef John's recipes that has becomes a new favorite!!

I have tried a few different recipes for cream of mushroom soup, but this one was amazing good. It came out creamy. I added a little more mushrooms and garlic to the recipe, and my family has already asked when I'm going to make it again. It's a new favorite and I gave this recipe 5 stars for a reason: it's perfect.

This was a great recipe. I did tweet it a little by taking out the flour and instead thickening which a little corn starch. My wife is gluten free. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Great as always Chef John.

I made this soup for Christmas Dinner. Put it in a beautiful soup terrine, and it was a hit. There wasn't a drop left. It was eaten with a piece of bread scraping the bottom.  Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm it was so good and my guests loved it.  Thank you, Chef John.

Love this recipe! Perfect flavours. Made as directed with addition of a splash of white wine.
It's my go-to recipe for a cold autumn day...

The flavor of this soup blew me away. Tasted like there must be a dozen fancy spices in it, but it's just the pure depth of mushrooms. Sumptuous! Next time, I'll cook extra mushrooms, reserve 1/3 of them on the side, then add to the puree. Needs texture!

Creamy and delicious. Any recipe that calls for an hour long cook time is probably one I'm going to enjoy. The only change I made was skipping the step that required blending the ingredients, since we do not have a blender. However, the result was still wonderful. I look forward to trying this again with the required equipment.

Good easy recipe. Used white mushrooms but for some reason the colour turned really grey.  Will be making it again.

Great mushroom taste. Don't be afraid to amend the ingredients and instructions to suit your flavour buds. As well, swapping some of the "heavier" items (Whipping cream) with a lighter 50/50 blend also work well.  Nice change of pace.

I made this but I altered the recipe a bit by including both fresh mushrooms (cremini) and dried porcini mushrooms.  Approx 2/3 fresh to 1/3 dried.  I also used the soaking liquid for the porcinis as part of the 5 cups of water/broth listed in the recipe.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This was pretty good if you really like mushroom soup. The flavor is all mushroom, so perhaps using a couple of different kinds of mushrooms would bump it up a bit. It took all of 40 minutes to get the mushrooms to give up all the juices so be prepared for a longer prep time than stated. I followed the recipe as written except that I cut it in half. It was fun to make and I think I'll try it again with a trio of mushrooms - I used all portobella for this try.

Definitely will make it again.  It was ALMOST amazing.  The flavor wasn't quite as bold as I was expecting, but I think I didn't caramelize the mushrooms properly.  I cooked them well over the recommended amount of time, but there was still a lot of juice and I wasn't sure if I should keep going or if I would over cook them.  Next time I will keep going until all the juice is gone.  I did use half portobello mushrooms so maybe they have more liquid in them or something.

Thank you Chef John. Once again you pull through with a great recipe. I followed it to a tee and the results are luscious. The layers of every flavor are exceptional and I can’t get enough of it. But alas, I must not eat it all as I’m serving it tomorrow (Christmas eve) with some homemade croutons on top and a salad.  Excellent recipe!

First of all, Prep Time was closer to an hour and half vs. 15 minutes!  Took me longer than that to slice the mushrooms!  It wasn't BAD, it just certainly not worth the effort to make.   Very bland.  Won't try again.

Simply delicious! I bought a package of mushrooms from Costco, which is 24-oz, so I made 3/4 of the recipe. I drizzled EVOO on a few slices of French baguette, toasted them and rubbed raw garlic on them. They go perfect with this soup. Both my husband and I enjoyed it very much.

Really bland and disappointing.  I properly caramelized the onions and cooked the mushrooms, and even added some extra garlic, but it was still very blah.

I was able to liven it up with a bunch of ingredients afterwards, but if it's no good as written (excl valid substitutions), then it's a dud recipe.

If you really want to make it, then double (at least) the garlic, double the thyme (or pull off the leaves and put it in the soup, rather than pulling it back out again) and make sure you have fixins on hand.  Various mentions in other reviews include sherry, white wine, balsamic vinegar, worcestershire sauce, curry powder and orange marmalade!

I substituted coconut milk for the whipping cream and vegetable broth for the chicken broth. It was OK, but the strong mushroom flavor was not something that we wanted to eat the second time.

This is delish!  I made this soup specifically to use in place of canned mushroom soup for my family's beloved Thanksgiving green bean casserole.  I used a mix of mushrooms and only pureed about half of the soup.  I will make this when it's not Thanksgiving it is so good.

Made it in my 8 in 1 crockpot, slowly caramelizing the mushrooms, onions, and garlic. The flavor was amazing. I use a emulsion blender to blend, but I leave it chunky also. My family really enjoy this recipe.

Absolutely delicious.  I used low sodium chicken broth for all of the liquid. I liked another reviewers idea of using white wine for the water, I’ll do that next time.  Cooking these mushrooms down took a lot longer than 15 minutes and  higher temperature though.  5 star taste but the cooking method and times described are not spot  on.  Thanks for another great recipe, CJ.

I have made this recipe several times and it is a crowd favourite. I leave the mushrooms chunky and don't blend them down. Thank you for the recipe.

This soup with a few adjustments was 5 star restaurant quality and the best I have ever had. My adds were a shot of vermouth, and four dashes each of balsamic vinegar and worschester  sauce during the caramelization process. I also substituted mushroom broth for the chicken broth. Last change, I only pureed half of the mushrooms in with the broth and left the other half whole. Will make again and again

Absolutely delish! I used portabello & button mushrooms & skipped the  thickened cream for a lighter soup. Followed recipe & had a beautiful,  tasty wholesome soup that was so rich in flavour.  Definitely a winner!

I used dried thyme instead of fresh and didn't remove, used mushroom stock instead of chicken and it was excellent. The key really is letting the mixture simmer a while.

It took about 25 minutes to get the mushrooms the right depth of color and the final was really really good.  I did use a variety of mushrooms and would again.

Scrumptious and high in Vitamin D. If you take the stems off the mushrooms after cleaning them, arrange them on a tray and set in the sun gills up. The mushrooms increase their Vit D level by 150%. That is incredible and doesn't get lost in the cooking.
Highly recommend using Chantelles' or wild mushrooms as they always have a higher Vit  D level.

Outstanding soup worth at least 5 or 6 bucks for a bowl at many restaurants. I made as written except, in my haste, I forgot to add the flour to make the roux before adding the broth. Not to worry, though. I simply made a slurry of a tbs or 2 of cornstarch with a little cold water and added it for thickening. And, as always, I enjoyed.

Made this Mushroom soup last night and it was delirious. We used only white button mushrooms, but I think it would have been even better with a variety of mushrooms. The only changes we made were; to not blend a couple of ladles of the mushrooms. This changed the texture a bit. We also did not have any fresh thyme, so used dried thyme. A little labor intensive , but well worth it.

Great recipe! Took 30+ minutes to cook out the mushrooms. If I make again, I will  add an additional half pound of mushrooms, cooked and diced (not blended) in the end.

Great depth of flavor......I used a few dried morel and porcini mushrooms along with the liquid used to rehydrate them.  I had fresh button and shitake mushrooms for approximately 2 pounds.  Well browned really makes a difference.  Thanks, Chef John .

I'm caramelizing mushrooms right now and I just realized I dont have any heavy cream so I'll probably just use crème fraîche.

I made it exactly as the ingredients were listed.  The only thing different I did was to puréed ALL the soup.  It was for a friend who just got home from the hospital and she was on a special diet.  All food had to be puréed.  I tasted the soup before I took it to her and it was amazing!  She loved it and told me it was the best mushroom soup she has ever had and that it should be a signature dish of mine!  Guess that is as good a review as any!

Outstanding soup.  As others have said, it took a lot longer to caramelize the mushrooms, about 30 min.  I set the timer for every 5 min to stir and they were beautiful.  However, after I blended them, it was very very thick.  Next time I will add more stock.  The hour cooking time brought out the great mushroom flavor.  I used mainly Cremini mushrooms.  Their flavor was fantastic.

Just made this today for Teacher Appreciation week using a vegetable broth substitute to make it vegetarian friendly. I wouldn't recommend doing this if you don't have to! The flavor of the soup would have had far more depth had I been able to use the broth. That being said, it also still would have lacked in seasoning taste with either broth. The pinch of salt in the beginning wasn't enough to flavor the entire soup, so I'd suggest adding about a couple teaspoons of kosher salt to start and bumping up the pepper recommendation to about a tablespoon. The texture of the soup was perfect. When I try this again, I'm going to make it with the chicken broth and also try some various mushroom types to bring in another level of flavor. Only using baby portobella mushrooms this time around may have flattened the flavor too.

I used 1/2 fresh shiitake and 1/2 white mushrooms with BETTER THAN BOUILLON vegetable type. It was really delicious. I added a small amount of almond milk the next day because it had thickened and it only improved. Very yummy!

VERY delicious but it took just WAY too long, thus the four stars. It took me close to an hour to caramelize the mushrooms and the prep time was closer to 30mins. I used a mix of shiitake, baby bella, wood ear, enokatike, and oyster mushrooms and added a leek in addition to the onion.  I used Better than Bouillon (chicken) for the stock and Organic Valley heavy cream. I also saved about a cup of the mushrooms when blending the soup and added them back in after blending the rest of the soup for some texture contrast. If you like mushroom soup this is top notch! But be prepared for it to take up to twice as long as the recipe says.

it tastes great but keep some mushrooms out for texture and visually so I doesn't look like a bowl of mud.  :-)

OMG! Chef John this is absolutely delicious! We just made it and it is so good, and well worth the wait to simmer it. I highly recommend others take the time to make this beautiful dish. Now we can freeze it for lunches and for our baked pork chops and mushroom / smoked Gouda soup! Thanks much Chef, love your recipes.

I made a few changes but was very pleased with my healthier version.   I substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth , dried thyme instead of fresh,  and I substituted a can of white beans pureed with a little water for the cream .  I  used an immersion blender for easy clean up.  It turned out great!

Delicious and simple, my favorite kind of recipe. I used a combination of shittake, cremini and wild mushrooms. Don’t hurry it along. It was decadent. I’d serve it for a dinner party as the main dish, it was so good.

I made this recipe using instapot. Select soup and low pressure. It turned out great. Next time, I am gonna try the slow cooker option.

A+ Delicious!!! Best mushroom soup I’ve ever had. Made a few minor alterations: replaced water and chicken broth with 5 cups vegetable broth; used 2% milk as I had no cream (didn’t miss the cream - soup was still very rich); added 1/4 tsp. truffle salt; and per reviewers’ suggestions, also added 1 T. sherry (will add 2 next time) and 1 tsp. balsamic vinegar. It took me closer to 45 min. to get the mushrooms to brown up as much as I wanted but totally worth it. May divide mushrooms between two pans next time to speed it up. Consistency was just right, thick but not too thick. Served with pita bread for dipping.

This is a very good -- and very easy to make -- Cream of Mushroom Soup recipe. But because I follow the "Keto Lifestyle", I had to tweak it  -- if only in one instance.  Specifically, I substituted 1/2 tsp. Xanthan Gum for the 1-1/2 tsp. Flour (which reduced the carbohydrate count to 2). I didn't have fresh Thyme (I never do), so I used Parsley (which I always have on hand)  instead. We like our Cream Soups REALLY "creamy", so I think  the next time I make it, I'll reduce the Chicken Broth by 1/2 cup and substitute an additional 1/2 cup of Heavy Whipping Cream.  I didn't do it "first time around", but I think in the future I'll try  different variations (e.g., adding a stalk of celery to the soup,  garnishing with scallions, crumbled bacon, jalapenos and/or  melted swiss or cheddar cheese. I'm actually thinking about cooking some Hamburger meat along with the mushrooms and adding it, too, to the soup.  I'll have to think about that a bit , but , at first glance, that seems like a "one pot meal" I'd like to see served in one of our local restaurants.)

This is the first time i have made mushroom soup.  My husband and I both love this recipe. I used white button mushrooms.   It took almost an hour to cook the juices out of the mushrooms, so it is not a quick soup to make but worth the time.  Also, I used fat free milk instead of cream and we both felt it still had a rich flavor.  Will definitely be making again.

Turned out amazing but I tweaked it somewhat. Takes about 45 minutes to evaporate the juices. Used evaporated milk for less fat and it’s fantastic! Also used 1/4 teaspoon ground thyme as I didn’t have sprigs. Highly recommend this recipe!

As mushrooms are meaty in flavour, I used beef broth to enhance this and left out the garlic as I didn't want it to overpower the mushrooms.
To save time, I might try slicing them in my food processor the next time.

Loved this!   Yep, takes a little while, but it’s so earthy and delicious!   Followed the recipe except I only had beef stock.  It was amazing!   I also halved it for two and it was perfect.  We made some garlic croutons for the top.

The recipe was delicious, but I served it as a main course for lunch with a side salad and bread. I doubled the recipe, but hardly had any left over after serving 8 people. So I think the serving of six is meant for it to be served as a first course. Several of my guests had seconds.

This recipe is easy and delicious. I had all of the ingrédients at home except for the fresh thyme so I substituted 1/4 tsp of powdered thyme. It turned out fine.  I am wondering if anyone used olive oil instead of melted butter. It seems to me that this may be a healthy substitution....I may try doing that the next time I make this soup. I always try to follow recipies as written the first time I make them. I would definitely make this one again. It's always nice to begin a meal with a cup of soup!

This is the best!  I made 1/2 a recipe, as it was just my husband and I, and it was plenty filling for our lunch.  I also made it with regular milk to cut calories, and it was still really yummy!

Made just as  given.   But mine I used a stick blender.  It was good but not as smooth as Chef John's.   I followed the directions except I didn't use a blender to puree it.  Is this why mine was more grainy?

I added a bay leaf with the thyme, brandy (though sherry or white wine would work) with the stock, and finished with a little sherry vinegar.

I roasted the mushrooms for 20 min first because I read in another recipe it brings out the flavor..then followed this recipe for most of it. I substituted cream for half and half to cut the fat.. it's wonderful. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because maybe it could be just a bit better. Don't know how or why! Maybe it's the mushrooms? Or maybe I just was tasting it too much! Lol

Made as written.  Next time I'll leave some mushroom chunks and won't completely puree it all.  Also, the flavor was wonderful but it was too rich with all the butter and heavy cream.  Will probably use half and half or milk next time.  Made the kitchen smell great.-
made a second time as written and liked it better.  Used a little salt and pepper.  Instant Pot Duo Plus; Soup Program, "less," 20 min + NPR.  Used the Smart Stick to puree.  Everything cleaned up before it was time to serve. ??. Thanks, Chef John for another winner.

Delicious and pretty easy to make. I used a mix of several kinds of mushrooms, and before pureeing reserved a few of the cooked slices to add back in. Perfect with some crusty garlic bread.

I love Chef John recipes and this one did not disappoint! I doubled the recipe and used a cup of marsala and a cup of water rather than just 2 cups of water. I used an immersion blender at the end which was super convenient. My whole family, kids included, devoured this wonderful soup! So much for leftovers. ;)

Not even my mushroom lover was a fan. Too bad, had high hopes for this. It need some some acid and we tried balsamic and lemon juice (in different bowls) and it was still blah. Maybe some sherry or brandy would have helped. Was quite disappointed as I had high hopes.

The best mushroom soup I have had in a long time.  Instead of using the food processor I used the. Immersion blender so there were bigger pieces of mushrooms.

Made the soup with fresh ingredients and directions as per the recipe. It was tasteless.  Beginning to doubt source of the recipe. It's not written by a chef, that's for sure.

Wonderful soup !  Didn’t have Heavy Cream so used Half and Half and more chicken broth.  Didn’t have Fresh Thyme so used dried  Thyme  and still had really good flavor. My husband said on a scale of one to ten this soup rates an 8 ! I will make this again. It is worth the effort .

Wow! This was good!  Mushrooms did take ALOT longer than 15 minutes to brown.  Which is fine.  Maybe not a weeknight soup unless you do some prep earlier. Not a lot of hands on once things get going.  I added a little more garlic, a splash of dry sherry with the broth (because I love sherry with mushroom soup), 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream (could possible sub evaporated milk), a splash of Tabasco at the end (doesn’t make it hot, just balances the flavor a bit for me), used immersion blender.  Did end up using about 5 cups of broth instead of 4 to get the texture I was after.  Thanks for sharing, Chef John!  We loved it!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS! I didn't have heavy cream, so I subbed two cups water/stock with 2 cups of whole milk and replaced the cream with milk, too. My mushroom/stock mixture was almost completely goopy before adding the milk--so, it was perfect when I added the milk. My 10 year old licked the bowl and begged me to make it again!

Fantabulous! I made mushroom soups before, but they all tasted mediocre. This is the first recipe that made me wow, and that's something because I am super picky when it comes to food tastes. I was skeptical about simmering for an hour, but I was surprised by how it pulled so much flavor from mushroom and balanced the seasoning at the end(it tasted quite salty with broth and salt at first). Definitely recommend.

Made as directed except used Better than Bouillon and 4 cups of water since I didn’t have chicken broth. I didn’t add the extra cup of water in case it was too watery knowing I could thin it later if necessary. I only simmered for 20 minutes and it was perfect. I’m wondering if simmering it longer makes a difference in the flavor after having already carmelized the mushrooms? I don’t think it’s necessary!

This is a great recipe but lacks some flavor...I feel there wasn't quite enough salt in the ingredients and this was a very easy fix. Added some diced cooked chicken and it was a great, hearty dinner.

Made half a batch, using a combination of cremini, oyster and shitake mushrooms.  I did not reduce the amount of butter.  The mushrooms took about 30 minutes to brown nicely.  I normally make my own stock (and use it over broth due to the richness it imparts), however tonight I used a store bought MUSHROOM stock (900 mL).  Cooked it in a large pan to help reduce the volume of liquid and intensify the flavour.  Pureed  mushrooms in blender to silky smooth before adding back to the broth.  Did not have heavy cream, so used half and half (remember I used full amount of butter).  Splash of port, drizzle of truffle oil, and some chopped fresh tarragon gives it a lovely finish.

I've made many soup recipes, and this just might be my favorite. It took a lot of time (a good 30 minutes just to cook the mushrooms), so it's not the best weeknight meal, but it was so worth it! Such simple ingredients, but so much flavor! The only changes I made were to use chickpea flour and vegetable broth, and I used cremini and button mushrooms. I also set aside a small amount of the soup before pureeing and then added it to the pureed mix for texture. I garnished each serving with freshly grated nutmeg, which put it over the top. This is an absolute keeper!

This is the best cream of mushroom soup recipe I’ve ever made.  I have been trying to crack the code for this soup for a long time and gotta say it was 5 star delicious.  I used a hand blender to held control the consistency’s.  Thank you so much chef John.

It is a bit of work with sauteeing and simmering but the taste is worth it. I used homemade chicken stock instead of store bought. I used evaporated milk for the whipping cream and no water. I used 1/4 tsp dried thyme for the fresh. I added some extra seasoning as well Mrs Dash garlic & herb, no salt Emril's Essence, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper and salt. I had also added a tbsp of sherry which I saw on other recipes. I also only pureed half the soup to keep some mushroom pieces whole. My son was very happy as he loves cream of mushroom soup.

I gave this 4 stars because it was an excellent foundation of a recipe for cream of mushroom soup. I subtracted 1 little star,  bc for my palate, I made some changes. I knew that I wanted to puree the soup in my vitamix and reserve back some sliced, meaty mushrooms to mix back in once the puree was done. that's why I chose this particular recipe bc it does exactly that. however, I went one step further and prepared sliced,  sautéed mushrooms separately but in parallel so that I could use expensive shiitakes, hen ?? of the woods and king trumpet mushrooms for the slices. and regular button and baby bellas for the main body of the soup.
((one note about prepping... yeah it takes longer than 15 minutes, but then again, I prepped all the mushies myself and didn't buy presliced. working with the entire mushroom allowed me to remove the more fibrous stems and ends (especially of the shiitakes) and place them in the store bought bone broth to enhance the broth while cooking the dish up to the addition of the broth... just strain straight into the mushie and veggie mixture and you're golden! I try and use every part of everything.))
another change was using sherry to deglaze the pan after sautéing and prior to adding the flour, then broth. 
another change was to add celery with the onions and mushrooms bc I wanted the extra sweetness and volume from celery in the final puree. 
yet another difference was deciding to put the cream in prior to blending the mixture together. I read a cou

The only change was to reduce the thyme since I’m not fond of thyme but put enough in for my taste.  Otherwise, followed the recipe as is.  Carmelizing the mushrooms is key for added flavour.

I’m going to need a larger pot. The first time I only made a half portion of this lovely soup. Today I made the full recipe and it still wasn’t enough. I added a little extra butter when cooking the mushrooms, but I think that may have extended time to caramelization. I am going to try it w/a bit of sherry.

2lbs is a lot of mushrooms, a crazy amount of mushrooms. I weighed precisely and ended up with a very thick soup. I ended up diluting with twice the amount of chicken broth and ended up with perfection. Mushroom umami for days! Yummy!

In order for the water from the mushrooms to evaporate, I had to increase the heat to medium and it took about 30 minutes before adding the onions.
I wish someone would confirm that the recipe matches the video; in the recipe, it states to decrease the temperature to low and in the video, Chef John states to decrease to medium low.

Thought this was going to be gorgeous because of the way the mushrooms caramelized so beautifully, but the end result was missing a little something - so I added about a 1/3 of a cup of sherry!  Did the trick!

I doubled this recipe so it took quite a while to cook down all of the mushrooms. I also didn't have thyme. I used an immersion blender and left the mushrooms as very tiny pieces rather than puree the whole thing. It was amazing and I will definitely be making this again soon.

This is a very good recipe if you are looking for a flavorful mushroom soup.  I followed the recipe exactly and while it turned out as the recipe states (rich and creamy), it was too strong for our taste, so probably will not make it again.

Made this over the weekend for visiting family. It was stupid good! My family loved it and actually said it was the best they ever had. I’ll be making this for years! I used  half and half because that’s what I had, also didn’t have chicken stock for the he first batch (made 2) so used beef.

Needs to be thicker, I will add cornstarch. Good mushroom flavor. Don't be afraid of how large 2 lbs of mushrooms look they cook down to about a quarter of what you start with!

I was hesitant about making this but it turned out yummy.   I used 3 types of shrooms... baby belladonna, portobello and button.   next time no portobello just button and baby bella. I served with hot bread and parm.

The mushrooms were chopped way too fine for me by doing it the way the recipe says to. Decent flavor but definitely need to let the mushrooms brown well.

I made it as written. It is good, but nothing special. Given all the rave reviews, all I can think of is that I didn't cook the mushrooms long enough. Will probably try it again.

This recipe is very close to my own.  Yes, it takes longer than indicated here but it's indeed worth not rushing it.  I use beef stock instead of chicken for my family's savory personal preference.  Either way, this is some of the best cream of mushroom soup you will eat.

Will definitely make it again. Did add an extra cup of heavy cream. I think I used a bit more mushroom than was required as a result I needed the extra heavy cream. Absolutely delicious.

This soup is excellent! We had it three mornings in a row for breakfast. It is not hard but takes time. We used food processor for chopping up soup and the clean up took a long time. Still it's so outstanding that we're going to make it again soon. Great recipe. Also used baby Bella mushrooms.

Wonderful taste.  I love big chunks of mushrooms so i didn't blend it.  Just added a little corn starch whisked into some milk to thicken it.  Definitely worth the time to cook down the mushrooms.

Very rich and very delicious!  I simmered it for too long but it was very easy to recover by adding more chicken stock.  Took me far longer than 15 minutes to carmelize the mushrooms, but it was worth the effort.  Love Chef John - he never fails!  Nor do I when I follow his directions!

This was outstanding! I love mushroom soup but honestly this was better than most I've had at restaurants. I didn't feel like it too up that much time and what time it did was completely worth it. I'm making this for a pot luck coming up and I KNOW this will be a crowd favorite.

I must have done something wrong, I really didn't like it, mine turned out "watery". Maybe because I altered the serving size? My husband liked it. Or perhaps The Cheesecake Factory spoiled my taste buds. I used baby Bella mushrooms. I'll try again using the original serving size of 8, use Shiike (spelling?) mushrooms and beef broth. I'm giving 4 stars because my hubby liked it and it didn't call for too many ingredients.

I had eaten a mushroom soup in Santa Fe that I liked and wanted to make one with a little more flavor for my family. I started with this recipe, but added celery to cook with the onion and garlic. Once tender, I added the mushrooms and cooked according to directions. I added the spices and broth with the substitution of smoked salt for the regular and a tablespoon of crushed red chile, brought to a low simmer for a few minutes and blended half of the mixture with my immersion blender, After, I added 4 cups of finely chopped kale and simmered for  a few more minutes before adding fat free half and half in place of the  whipping cream. I simmered it to reduce it a bit to the desired consistency. My foodie family loved it. With the healthier adjustments my husband said this is a keeper.

Excellent mushroom soup. I used a combination of brown and white mushrooms because that was what I had on hand. Followed the directions that Chef John dictated.

Just made this last night and the whole family loved it.  Pretty straight forward recipe and I followed exactly except I added a bit of sherry to the mushrooms just before the onion step.  That's just my preference as I put sherry  in several of my soup recipes.  Will definitely be repeating this delicious recipe.

This was a great soup and I got a lot of compliments on it! I was serving a group that included kids and they loved it as well.  I used 1/2 the amount of cream called for and thought it struck a good balance of richness and flavor. Would definitely make it again.

Loved this recipe!! It was rich, creamy with the taste of the thyme coming through nicely. I added an additional clove of garlic (our preference) and little bit of extra thyme..... we'll surely be doing this one again!

Delicious! Tastes just like a famous restaurant's (in the NC mountains) soup! Made as directed, with the exception of pureeing only about half of the soup before adding the cream.  We like some mushroom chunkiness! Delightful with some sourdough bread for dipping.  YUM!  Will definitely make again! Not long to make but note the hour simmer time. It took 15 min for my mushrooms to absorb their juice, then about another 15 to caramelize,  which is what I understood chef John to say.  This soup is perfect!

This was so delicious. I have made it twice. Perfect each time. So so easy. I did not use the thyme. And I used half and hallf instead of the heavy cream. So mine was not so rich or thick, but delicious.

I used Chanterelles just picked, with half and half instead of cream. It took a long time for the moisture to cook out of the mushrooms, but they cooked beautifully. The soup was delicious and worth the time to cook.

Loved this recipe....simple but tasty. Cooking the mushrooms took me longer than the recipe stated as I wanted to get the browned look. I followed the recipe exactly and those I served it to loved the soup. I will definitely make again and I think next time I might add a few different types of mushrooms just to see what difference (if any) it would make. Thanks again Chef John.

I accidentally reviewed this soup which I did not make.  I cannot figure out how to delete the review, so I moved it to five stars and wrote this.

Although very simple, it still took quite a while to make this.  I'd say it's worth it.  Very mushsroom-y!!!

This is wonderful! I made this to use up some mushrooms I had in the fridge so just made a half batch. I added extra garlic and used about 2 tablespoons of dried thyme and lots of black pepper. I whipped it up silky smooth in my Vitamix and it was enjoyed by my mother who normally hates thyme but is currently on a liquid diet after surgery, as well as my 8 year old nephew who declared it "delicious!"

Love this recipe. I think I rushed the first step, didn't realize just how long it would take. Next time I will plan to spend more time. The soup itself is lovely but I added another two cups of  sauteed diced mushrooms after the last step because I like having some substance (and it reminds me of Campbell's!) All in all, a success.

Not bad nothing special though. Too much mushroom even for mushroom soup I found though. I also think I would like it better if it wasn't blended.

Very yummy. I used 10% cream instead of whipping cream and it turned out just as good.  It did take about 2hours but it was much better than a can of soup.

I would make it again.

I made this tonight and it took about 1.5 hours but was well worth the wait.  The only thing I did differently was to not add thyme and that was only because I ran out.  My 1 year old ate his entire bowl!!!

It came out really flavorful. I made adjustments on the serving (6). Would have liked it to be a bit more thicker. Will freeze a serving or two for my mom to have when I'm traveling:)

My husband just got out of the hospital today. I wanted something special for him for supper. I made Chef John's Cream of Mushroom Soup with lettuce wedge salad and Chef Jon's homemade Bleu Cheese Dressing. It was a huge hit. I have used Allrecipes forever. Whenever I want something special I come here, BUT why have I never found Chef John? He has some awesome recipes. WILL try more. Thank you for sharing Chef John. I made both recipes exactly as written.

My mushroom soup turned very thick and creamy so maybe I shouldn't have used the heavy cream. Otherwise it tasted very good and had a really strong taste so a small portion will be enough and more than fulfilling.

It was really wonderful-chef John could hold his head high in any of the Spargl Fests I attended faithfully when I lived in Germany. The seasoning was spot on (tho' I'm not a fan of John's 'essence of life'-cayanne. I have to hold waay back when I use it. I've learned that after searing my taste buds with hot pepper in any form, I'll need to skip the dish. This was NOT too hot -sigh- smile.

It was OK.  I spent an entire evening making this soup.  At first I thought it was fabulous, but the next day (when most soup is tasting even better than it does initially) I thought it was mediocre, and I had to force myself to eat it.  My 86 year old mother said she didn't like it nearly as much as the split pea soup I had been serving her.  I think that this might be a wonderful mushroom sauce to use in a casserole.
