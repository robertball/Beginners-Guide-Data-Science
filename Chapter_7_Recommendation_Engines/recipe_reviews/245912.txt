I am sure that this is delicious, but I thought that the following warning is important if you do not use this fairly quickly:  Botulism is potentially fatal food poisoning, and it can come about when making garlic-infused oil at home. The bacteria spores that cause botulism are called Clostridium botulinum, and they can spread in certain foods when not exposed to oxygenâ€”as is the case when infusing garlic in oil.

Why would you ever buy flavored oils again when you could just make this in a pinch?  This makes a great dipping oil for bread, a tasty salad dressing, and delicious when sauteeing meat or grilling veggies. The only thing I did slightly differently was to use use fresh rosemary without drying it, only bc I was a little impatient. I used the back of the knife to bruise the leaves in order to infuse more flavor into the oil. Perfect!
