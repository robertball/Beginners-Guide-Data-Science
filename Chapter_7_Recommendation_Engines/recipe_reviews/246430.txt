A savoury farinata to add to your bread alternatives. This indeed is delicious with dips and spreads and holds up to being handled. I made a half batch and needed 15 minutes to cook. Toast your leftovers make a great pizza! Thank you for the recipe.

This is my second time making this and this time I added a full bundle of spinach and 10 mins to the baking time. Delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly but the "dough" came out as batter. I wonder whether the cups of water were meant to be tablespoons or something much, much smaller. I made the batter into dough myself by adding more besan flour and a couple of eggs to make it stay together but it came apart as I was rolling it out. The only way to salvage it was to convert it back into batter again (which it was never meant to be in the first place). I have been using it for savoury pancakes. It has a pleasant flavour and, as pancakes, it goes well with a potato and pumpkin topping.
