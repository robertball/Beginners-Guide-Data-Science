The whole family loved this! After I sauteed the veggies I threw them and all other ingredients except the pb into the crockpot. Put uncooked green pepper in at begiining as well. Sitirred in PB before serving.The only things I did differently were to use coconut oil instead of olive and doubled both the garlic and cayenne. It had an amazing flavor.

I used a whole cayenne pepper instead of the powder, a large apple instead of the juice, and diced tomatoes instead of the juice.  Wonderful comfort soup kind of soup!

I've decided to go vegan one day per week (already been vegetarian for several years). This dinner was amazing! So flavourful. I did make a few small changes: I cut down the onion (used half a large onion), and I added a can of chick peas. Served it over brown rice.

Surprisingly fantastic stew.  Stuck with all the ingredients listed and was so happy with the taste.  Very simple and many ways to serve it up.  Calling this my Feel-Good stew.

Very delicious and easy to make! I did make a couple changes: one whole apple instead of apple juice and coconut oil instead of flakes (what I had on hand), and sunflower butter instead of peanut butter (allergy). I also put it on top of some brown rice. Will definitely be making this again!

This is a very unusual dish, but my husband and I thought it was delicious, which is good because it makes a lot. I used the food processor to chop (pulse) the veges to speed the prep so it turned out more shredded than chunky, which was fine. Also, it didn't say to cover the pot while simmering, so the result was a thick stew that I served over bulgar wheat. I ended up doubling the cayenne and adding 50 percent more ginger (I threw in some freshly grated, as well). I didn't have tomato  juice on hand, so I used a 1:1 tomato sauce/water mixture.  The only coconut I had was frozen shredded (available from Indian markets), so it disappeared into the stew and, sadly, was unnoticeable. Also, there is no need to use  oil to saute the veges because they release enough moisture themselves. Finally, I used Kirkland brand natural smooth peanut butter, which worked beautifully.

I made this recipe simply because it seemed so strange/different, and I was stuck in a food rut. The combination of ingredients. I couldn't wrap my mind around it. I was blown away at how good it was. I will be making it regularly. I didn't have cabbage,  so I left it out. Soo yummy.

This meal was absolutely delicious.  It was the first dinner I made for my husband and I when we started trying to be vegan and the complexity of flavours had my husband guessing at every bite.  We both agreed it was restaurant-fabulous and evening though we are no longer vegan, we still make this stew.

My wife loves Vegan African Stew we serve it over brown rice.  Easy to make and it hits the spot.

Very good. I think I may have put too much peanut butter but everyone except my husband, liked it. I think serving over rice or with Naan bread is a good idea. Also adding beans or peas for protein :)

I added black pepper as I used a whole teaspoon of cayenne instead of a half, but otherwise made it exactly as instructed. It was delicious.

I'm new to vegan cooking, but this was delicious and easy. I added some rinsed black beans to get more protein, which also gave a good color contrast. I also served with coconut sprinkled on top for garnish and texture. Will absolutely make it again.

I loved it. My husband on the other hand was not a fan. I made as is except used a peeled, chopped apple in place of the apple juice. I also sprinkled each serving with crushed red pepper. Served over whole wheat pearl couscous. Freezes well. Great comfort food!

My pinch of salt was closer to 1 tsp, but everyone has different taste. Super easy and delicious!

This was really good with naan bread. I added extra cayenne, ginger and garlic. I also pureed about 4 cups of the soup to make it thicker. I will definitely make this again!
