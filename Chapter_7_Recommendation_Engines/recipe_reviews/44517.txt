Yes, you really do put it in frozen!  Chuck roasts work too, but NOT English-cut roasts (too fatty).  This is just excellent, a favorite of our family - which includes 2 toddlers.  I do modify it: skip the wine, use a 16 oz jar of mild salsa (Paul Newman is best!), skip the garlic & S&P since these are in the salsa.  Then I increase the cilantro to use the entire bunch.  The first couple of times I did this with rump & chuck roasts and they just fell apart with a fork easily shredding it.  Sometimes I add a can of black beans, rinsed, to increase the protein (I'm crazy that way).  Leftovers are great in other "All Recipes" like Beef Enchiladas II with Sara's Red Enchilada Sauce or in Six Can Chicken Tortilla Soup (can substitute your leftovers for the can of chicken and some of the broth if you have lots).  Just a great recipe.  Highly recommend!

Ok, I just finished serving these tacos to my family and wow...I mean WOW!  What's better than throwing a hunk of frozen meat into the crockpot with a few other ingredients and leaving for the day, you ask?  I'll tell you, it's coming home and having the meal not be mediocre, but actually INCREDIBLE!  I followed the recipe exactly, and the meat was tender and the flavors mingled so well together.  For those of you who had trouble finding the mexican hot tomato sauce, I found it at Wal-mart in the canned tomato section.  Really, you must try this recipe, all 4 kids (even a picky 5 yr old) gobbled up their plates and had seconds.  I warmed up some corn tortillas to wrap the meat, lettuce, cheese and sour cream in, then served these along side the Spanish Rice II recipe (also from this site), and delish! I'd give it more stars if I could.  Thank you, Diana, for an easy and AMAZING meal!

Turned out wonderfully.  I used a bottle of Corona instead of white wine.  I also recommend adding just enough water to cover the roast completely.  Great recipe.

I cooked up about 4-1/2 lbs of rump roast(weight after fat was trimmed off). It fed 9 adults and 4 children, not 16 as the recipe suggests. Unable to find Mexican tomato sauce, I used plain tomato sauce and added 1/2 tsp. ground cumin and 1-1/2 tsps. crushed oregano (not ground). The recipe made a juicy, delicious filling for our soft tacos. Our condiments included lime wedges, salsa, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and olives. The only thing that disappointed me was how difficult it was to shred the cooked rump roast. Next time I'll go back to using a less expensive boneless chuck, which shreds like a dream. Otherwise, this was a big winner in our family's book.

I used cumin, beer and rotel (diced tomatoes/chilies) along with the mexican sauce.  The beef shredded nicely and I froze individual portions (which we're now using for burritos and quesadillas).  For the ease of making it, it gets 5 stars, however, it could've used something to give it a little more oomph, which is why it got 4 stars.

The best tacos I've ever had!  I threw the meat in frozen, used El Pato Hot Tomato Sauce and poured enough water to cover the meat.  I also added some garlic, salt & pepper.  These shredded beef tacos can give Chipotle's tacos a run for their money.

I was a little skeptical about the frozen roast, but everything was delicious.  I used a light white wine (Chardonay) and made sure to skim some fat off before shredding.  If you don't want to spend a long time with a spoon, try lightly laying a paper towel on top of the liquid to pick up the fat on top.  Excellent flavor and great recipe!!!

I have to review this amazing recipe!  I had never so much as touched a rump roast before, so if I could do it, anyone can!! It was so easy and tasted incredible.  The only things I added were some whole black peppercorns and chopped jalapenos (since we LOVE spicy.)  Oh, and for those who couldn't find the Mexican tomato sauce, they had it at Pathmark in the Mexican food section (near salsa) in a yellow can in Spanish writing. Give this one a try!

Very tasteful. I didn't use wine. I used a crockpot-using one can of medican hot tomato sauce. After the meat was cooked I dumped half the top sauce to cut down on the fat. I then aded the other can of mexican sauce, onions and cilantro. I cooked for an hour or less on high in the crock pot. Seved wonderful tacos the first day, burritos the second day, and great enchiladas on the second. Yum, I was in heaven eating my favorite foods! Thanks!

I can't say enough good things about this recipe. It sounded too easy. I was amazed! I served this with grated cheese, sour cream and pico de gallo. To heck with regular old ground beef sytle taco's. This is the best!

I have made this recipe twice in the last two weeks.  I made a few changes based on other postings.  First, I used a rump roast that was thawed.  I cut the roast into 4 pieces as I found it was easier for me to shred.  I used a full bottle of Bud Lite Lime (I didnt have any Corona) as a substitute for the wine, a can of mild green chilis, lime juice, and I cooked it on low for 6 hours. After 6 hours I shredded the meat, put it back in the crock pot with the green onions and cilantro for an additional 45 minutes on high.  I fried fresh corn tortillas and sprinkled parmesan cheese on them.  I served the tacos with Pico de Gallo (also on this site), and cheese.  My kids said "I'm not hungry" before dinner.  I had them eat at least 1 taco.. by the time dinner was over they each had an additional 2 tacos (they never eat more than 2) and told me they would have more if they weren't so full! Thank you for this great recipe.

This was very, very good and super easy.  I piled mine on fried corn tortillas and topped with salsa fresca, cheddar cheese and sour cream.  A great meal!

Great recipe! The kids ask for it now.  I make this meal at least 3 times a month.  I have made a few alterations to the original recipe.  I use beer instead of wine.  I add couple of teaspoons of Cumin.  I use 1 can of the Mexican style tomato sauce while cooking for the first 8 hrs.  While shredding the meat I place the other can of Mexican style tomato sauce plus 1 can of Rotel.  I use a hand mixer to blend (it thickens the sauce a bit).  Then I add the shredded meat back in to cook for additional 30-45 minutes.

It was good but needed just a little more. The second time I added a little more spice by adding some hot peppers and cumin.

This is a REALLY nice change from doing tacos or burritos with ground beef and the flavor was excellent.  The roast I used was just over two-pounds and while it wasn't hard to shred by any means, it took more effort than I had anticipated.  I can't imagine a four pound roast being tender enough in the time allowed.  However, I have to admit that I did leave out the wine and the extra acid probably would have helped things along.  I used two cans of Ro-Tel type tomatoes & chilis, one packet of taco seasoning and four teaspoons of chopped garlic.  (I never met a recipe I didn't modify.)  I'll certainly make it again, husband & kids LOVED it, as did I!  This one is a keeper.

I've made this a few times now. My husband loves it! Any cut of meat will do. I used a flank steak today, cutting it in half so the meat strings wouldn't be so long. I also forgot that it didn't need to be thawed, oh well. I use beer, instead of wine, because we're not wine drinkers and I'd rather waste the bottom of a bottle of beer than over half a bottle of wine. Also, it tastes great! I didn't have the mexican tomato sauce on hand today (though I highly recommend it!) so I used a can of 'zesty' tomatoes. It's a real no fail recipe. I usually make homemade refried beans (this website, can't remember the name though), guacamole and mexican rice. I set it all out with taco shells, tortillas, salsa and sour cream (lettuce & tomato too, if others are joining us), for a taco/burrito bar. Did it today for the Superbowl and it went over great!

I was so excited to make shredded beef tacos at home. But......it just was not very good. Not a lot of flavor. I want tacos like when we go out to dinner at a Mexican food restaurant.

OMG!!! Amazing and easy.  I could not find the Mexican tomato sauce so I used (2) cans of tomatoes with green chili's and mixed in a can of tomato paste with the wine.  Also added cumin from reading some of the reviews.  Restaurant qauality. I cannot wait to make enchilada's tomorrow night with the leftovers.  Bravo!!!!

I added 3 tomato sauce instead of 2 but next time I think I will add 4 to make it spicier. The sauce is called Salsa de Pato it's a yellow can with a picture of a duck :D You can also find it in the Hispanic section at your grocery store. I also changed the recipe a little bit I added the rump roast in a pot filled it with water and 6 beef bouillon to give it flavor with half an onion and half a clove of garlic after 40 minutes i took the rump roast out and placed it in my crockpot for 4 hrs super easy i added like 3 cups of the left over beef broth into the pot and the remains of the non cooked half onion and then i followed the recipe so delicious!!!!

In my guests words "This Meat Is The Bomb"!! I've been waiting for the opportunity to make this recipe...finally did and the outcome was fantastic! I substituted chicken broth for the wine(didn't have any),and regular onion for the green. I didn't have mexican style tomato sauce, so I used a combination of reg. tomatoe sauce & tomato paste. I added homemade taco seasoning & chipotle sauce. My roast was a bit bigger, so I cooked on high for 14 hours. The meat was so tender and flavorful. I'll certainly make this again..thanks for sharing!

Meh. I am indifferent about this. I have tried several shredded beef recipes on this site (Mijo's shredded beef / Charley's Mexican-style meat), and ea. did not come close to meeting my expectations. I had high hopes for this, but it also let me down.... Having said that, I DO believe this version to be the best of the 3, although TERRIBLY bland. I pretty much followed the submitter's direct. to a T, except for 1/2ing everything since it was just for my fiance & I. My only other "slight" ch. was to use a 2 lb. chuck roast instead of a rump one. I would HIGHLY recommend NOT doing this. Chuck roasts are MUCH fattier than rump roasts (I had a LOT of fat to trim = gross). I used an 8 oz. can of LaPreferedia brand (HOT) Mexican tomato sauce & a little more than a 1/2 cup's worth of white wine (I buy 4 packs of sm. red/white wine bottles to keep on hand; not wanting to wase part of a bottle, I used all of it which equated to somewhere b/t 1/2 - 3/4 c.). I must say, using a frozen roast is GENIUS!!! I ALWAYS forget to defrost my meat, and when I DO remember, plans change and my meat spoils. :( Anywhoo, served w/ corn tortillas, co-jack cheese, more green oinon / cilantro, guacamole, chips & a side of Uncle Ben's micro. Mexican rice, this was an OK, no fuss meal, perfect for a busy weeknight. I guess there's nothing like Chipotle's barbacoa (sigh...), so when the craving strikes, I'm just going there (I give up!). Tx. anyways! :-)

This is super simple and pretty good.  I agree with other comments that it's kinda lacking in the flavor department.  I used some simple things like beer, lime and cumin for addditional flavor.  The best part of the recipe is it introduced me to Mexican tomato sauce.  I'm gonna have to start using that in more recipes - it was great!

Our family really enjoyed this.  I used cooking wine rather than table wine.  I used a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes because I didn't have enchilada sauce.  We served this with just warmed flour tortillas, finely shredded Monterey Jack and some homemade pico de gallo.  I recommend not getting too fancy with your toppings, because the flavor of the meat is so wonderful you won't want anything to compete with it.  Yum, yum, yum!!!

I was very excited to find this recipe but boy, were we very disappointed. We eat Mexican food (of many various recipes) at least once a week. This was very stange tasting. I followed the recipe to the tee and I think it was the wine that made it strange.I used Sauvignon Blanc (about $10.00) It was so bad that I threw the entire thing away and went out to dinner. I am so sorry.

this is incredible. I just season an arm roast with sea salt, garlic powder or minched, and pepper. dump a jar of medium picante sauce and wow! it is awesome. we like them soft tortillas with a little chz, lettuce, and guac, the sauce from cooking makes it extra juicy! make this all the time now!

The recipe is great, but it is very unsafe to put anything frozen---especially meat---in a slow cooker such as a crockpot. It should be thawed before placing it in a slow cooker.

Used a frozen 6 pound chuck roast & doubled everything else (except the green onion & cilantro, kept original quantity). After the meat was cooked & shredded I removed the fat from the broth & strained it before adding it back to the meat, & just added strips of roasted Anaheim chile before serving. Took it to a fiesta potluck & everyone loved it! Not bland at all as some other reviewers have said.

I was told that the were SO good (I don't eat meat, so I didn't try it).  I didn't have white wine so I just used a little water (no beer either!).  I also forgot to buy cilantro, but it was still great without those things....and SUPER easy.  I'd definitely recommend this!

This was absolutely awesome!  My alterations were nominal.  Used my own homemade tomato sauce, 2 toes of garlic, 1 poblano pepper, 1 gr. pepper, 2 japs....we like alot of spice.  This was just awesome - made me look like a 5 star chef!  Fried up corn tortillas for the vessel and made a salsa/topping of tomatoes, onion, cilantro, 3 different peppers and vinegar and lime juice.  This would be a TOTAL hit in ANY Mexican restaurant!!!  Thank you so much for the great recipe!!!!

I made this yesterday and it is pretty darn good.  I was a little skeptical at first putting a frozen roast in the crock pot, but it worked out nice.  The sauce is a little runny so I put the crock on high and left the lid off for a little bit after I shredded it.  Next time I will increase the garlic by triple- when you cook something so long you loose that strong flavor.  I will also up the green onions and cilantro.  Thanks for sharing this is an easy one to do.  Great for those super busy days when nothing is thawed out.

This is an incredible base recipe!!!! I added adobo seasoning, 1/2 cup chopped onions, some red pepper flakes, chili powder, and served with tortillas, grilled corn, homemade salsa and incredible mango margaritas from this website. My husband was wowed, we will add this to the regular rotation. Great recipe!!!

We LOVE this recipe!  Super easy, super delicious.  I also do this exact thing but sub the meat for several boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  It's divine!  Thanks for a great, *SIMPLE*, recipe.  P.S. -- Look for "El Pato" mexican tomato sauce - the small can with the duck on it.  It comes in all varieties of heat so you can make it to your liking.  It's in the mexican food isle of your supermarket.

Very easy and shredded really well.  My only complaint is that there wasn't enough flavor.  For some reason whenever I cook beef in the crockpot...I never seem to get enough flavor to infuse in the meat.  We will use this again, but still try to get more flavor.  Thanks for the post.

This is a great recipe! I was a bit skeptical when I read some of the ingredients and amounts -- 3 T. of crushed garlic? But by the time the beef finished cooking the smell was heavenly and the last minute addition of the fresh cilantro and green onions added so much flavor. We had purchased fresh tortillas at a local Mexican grocery store the day before and warmed those in a skillet. Served with sliced avocado, diced tomatoes, shredded lettuce and sour cream - this was wonderful! We will make this again and again - it would be perfect for football parties or tailgating. Thanks for sharing Diana!!

Followed the recipe exactly, but it tasted like pot roast.  Not sure what I was expecting.  The cilantro did add flavor, but for tacos or any mexican dish, I think you would need to seriously spice this up.  Further, unless you are feeding the Brady Bunch, I would cut this recipe in half and skip the whole "frozen roast" thing.  After 9 hrs, mine wasn't tender enough to shred and I used a chuck roast, which is typically very easy.  All in all, edible, but nothing special.

Wonderful! Tasted like Chipotle's Barbacoa burrito/taco meat.  I add "liquid smoke" and a can of rotel makes it Smokey and a little spicier.  Try with a brisket, shreds much better

This was AWESOME!  I had to make a few changes.  I couldn't find the hot tomato sauce, so I used a can of the fire roasted diced tomatoes.  I also left out the cilantro because my family detests it. I used a chuck roast that was partially thawed and had no problems.  At the end, after shredding it and before adding the green onions, I drained off all the extra juices.  Super yummy!

This makes ALOT of taco meat. Great for freezing and using at a later date. I subsituted the mexican style hot tomatoe sauce with a can of rotel and 1 cup of ChiChi's chunky salsa (Medium) 
I have made this twice, once I used fresh cilantro and the other time, I used the tubed cilanto. I prefered the tubed cilantor vs fresh...seems like tubed cilantro is more concentraded

Very good, and the crockpot does all the work. I also threw in a small can of diced green chiles.

EDIT: Made again 3/27/2011 - added red and yellow bell pepper along with fresh jalapenos (without seeds and membranes) --- also used red wine, as that is all I had. Still very delicious!

I am all about easy - just browse my recipe box - this would get 10 stars if I could because it not only tastes great and is easy but I got 3 dinners from it - Tacos, burritos - FROZE the left overs then reheated on low stovetop simmer to make another round of tacos a few weeks later. - BONUS - KID APPROVED!

This is a great recipe!!! The beef cooked up soooo tender. I used a thawed rump roast, so it took about 5 hours. Also, my family prefers a bit more flavor, so I added a can of Rotel green chili mix, 2 packets of Sazon, and some Emeril Essence.

This recipe was so easy!  I too do not like to change the recipe, but after reading several reviews followed suit.  I used Corona instead of wine and added diced green chilies for a little kick.  The trick with this recipe is to let the beef marinate for as long as you can after shredding.  This will allow the meat to soak up the flavor.  I only gave 4 stars because it was good, but I wasn't "wowed".  With that being said however I will make this again.

This was just great!  I followed the recipe exactly and couldn't be happier with the results!  The meat literally fell apart after cooking so shredding it was a snap.  I let it cook all day on low, shredded it, and then let the shredded meat simmer for about an hour longer in the juices.  The cilantro and green onions are a MUST!  I think a squeeze of lime juice and some pico de gallo added to each taco would be amazing - will definitely do it next time.  I intended to freeze half of the recipe, but my boyfriend enjoyed it so much that he had four servings between dinner and bed time, and I know he'll eat more for lunch today.  Next time, I'll have to stick half in the freezer before he gets his hands on it!  haha  My only suggestion is to pour the meat in a strainer and let drain for a few minutes before serving - we didn't and our un-fried corn tortillas disinegrated due to so much juice.  We froze the extra juice to use as a chicken marinade or something in the future - it was so yummy!

This makes so much that I froze half for another dinner. Very, very tasty. Wouldn't change a thing.

This was Great! I used a 4 pound rump roast.Used a small can of tomato sauce, a can of rotel, about 2 Tbs. of hot chili sauce (couldn't find mexican tomato sauce)and 3/4 of a beer in place of the wine. Two adults a a teen ate and we have enough left for at least 2 more meals. Highly reccomend this.It shredded really easily after 7.5 hours in the crock pot, on low. Will definately make again.

This seriously was the best wrap filling I've ever made.  As w/ all crockpot recipes, I reduced the juices on the stovetop at the end to intensify the flavor.  Yum!

this was not as "taco-y" as i was hoping for. It was a little spicy but mostly just tasted like a delicious roast beef.

YUM!  I halved the recipe and used enchilada sauce instead of the tomato sauce.  I also added a couple of dashes of hot sauce and some cumin. Thanks for this fabulous recipe!

First of all, I thaw out my roasts before using. I want to make sure that they get good and heated and cooked through. This is a good recipe otherwise. I didn't have mexican sauce, however, I subbed one can of rotel with chile's and one can of regular tomato sauce. I added a few more spices. Thanks for a delicious alternative to eating out.

Great recipe.  This has become our regular standby for Mexican beef dishes.  I leave out the tomato sauce and just add a couple tablespoons of picante sauce for a truer beef flavor.  Also works great with pork roasts.

I used pork instead of beef for this, and beer instead of the wine and it came out perfectly. i love the cilantro and green onions at the end. We served this with some homemade guacamole, black beans and rice and the rest of the beer!

I didn't really care for this recipe at all.  After 9 hours in the crock pot, it was still not very shreddable and didn't have much flavor.  I added a lot of spices, and kept it in the crock pot on high for another 2 hours.  After that, I was able to shred it, and it had more flavor, but I didn't think it was anything special.  Would not make again.

Although I made a few changes as other reviewers have, I have to give this recipe 5 stars for it's simplicity and taste.  I mean, how many recipes allow me to just throw a frozen piece of meat in a crockpot and come back hours later to the most delicious Mexican-style shredded beef I've ever had.  I did rub taco seasoning on the frozen beef, added chopped onions, replaced beer for the wine and cut the recipe in half.  If you love Mexican food as much as I do, you have to give this one a try.

I found this to be a bit to soupy for me. It tasted bland when I pulled it out, but after putting it on the taco with the gauc, cheese, etc it was better. I might try to put some tabasco in next time, I am not a person who likes things hot, but this didn't have much heat or flavor at all. I am going to give it another try with some adjustments.

This was so good and so easy. When I pulled the roast out to shred it, I left some of the meat out of the sauce and let my kids put that in their tacos. I put the rest of it back into the crock pot with all the juices and my husband and I scooped out meat along with the spices and it was so good.

This recipe was a big hit!  Made exactly as stated and results were great flavor.  It does end up with quite a bit of liquid, so be sure to either drain or serve with a slotted spoon.  Thanks for much for sharing this easy, delicious recipe!!

I did not care for this recipe. Very plain and unflavorful shredded beef for tacos. If it wasn't for the ease of making (combine ingredients in slow cooker and leave it alone) I'd have rated this zero stars. A few suggestions to make it better:
Add spices/seasonings (maybe onion powder, cumin, cayenne, crushed oregano (for the sonorans out there), or chili powder).
After mixing the shredded beef back into the juice, put it under a broiler to make it slightly crispy.
In all fairness, the meat did shred rather easily.

This is an excellent recipe for basic shredded beef. you can jazz it up a hundred different ways if you like more spice/heat, whatever. also keeps well in the fridge. I do omit the wine when I make it. just sub. beef broth or water.

This is great!  What I really love about it is that there can be variations made to suit your taste.  I added a diced fresh jalapeno and crushed red 'cause we like it hot!  I think that I will try to turn this into a soup when the weather gets cold again by adding some beef broth & other veggies, then topping with tortillas & sour cream for garnish.

I made this over spring break for a sleepover for 5 children(ages 6 to 13).  They loved it so much they didn't mind having it two days in a row.  Topped it with lettuce, tomatoes and shredded cheddar.  Used a 4-lb rump roast and made plenty for kids and 2 adults.  I would freeze half next time.  Used marsala wine.  Used tomato sauce with basil, oregano and garlic.  Used yellow onions...great recipe to use what you have on hand.

I think by "Mexican hot tomato sauce" the author means Rotel or similar (it's like tomatoes with green chilies, but has some other chilies in it as well.  Much stronger flavor than "Mexican style diced tomatoes" and comes in smaller cans.  Should be right next to the other diced tomatoes in the store).  Even the mild is pretty spicy, but it's good and gives a good flavor to the meat.  Yum!

Not sure how this is supposed to taste.  It was ok.  Maybe some cumin would help.

This was a great recipe. Since its just me and my boyfriend, I used a 1.5 lb frozen roast, replaced the wine for 1 cup of warm broth, used regular tomato sauce but added 2 chipotle peppers (with a tbsp of the adobo sauce) to add a spicy flair. I also followed another review and added half a can of rotel tomatos and put real garlic into the broth. 5 hrs on HIGH and the meat was tender as ever!   Oh just a FYI for first time users of the crockpot.. if you are going to put in a frozen block meat, please remember to put in a cup of warm liquid to act as a "cushion" since extreme temperature differences can shatter the ceramic bowl / cookware.  Have fun :)

Great recipe, I make it about once a week and it freezes well.  The only changes I made are adding some diced fresh tomatoes, about 4, a can of diced green chilies and, as I like my meat a tad more spicy, 1/2 to 1 cup of my favorite hot sauce. I also leave out the wine as the juices from the extras I add makes it unnecessary. Works great for tacos, nachos, chimichangas, tostadas, enchiladas, and even sandwiches on pita bread.  Great recipe DPULLIAM, thank you.

This recipes just didn't do it for me. I used a 3.75 pound beef round roast. I put my roast in the crockpot already defrosted. The recipe says cook the defrosted roast for 5 hours on low. WRONG! After 5 hours this roast would not shred at all. I had to cook it for an additional 2 hours and it was still not easy to shred. The roast itself was just flavorless and swimming in juice. I will never make this recipe again.

Easy and excellent. I used beer in place of the wine since I usually have beer on hand and don't usually have wine. I also added a can of green chiles by mistake and forgot to add the onions. It was very good that way. Thanks for sharing!!

Easy and delicious! I did use the frozen rump and it cooked perfectly. There was almost no fat, and it was one of the cheaper cuts of beef I saw at the store. I shredded it after nine hours and then let it simmer for about another hour. I too used a whole bottle of CORONA. My kids (11 and 6) loved it too! This will be a new regular in our house. You can use the meat for tacos, burritos, tostadas, the possibilities seem endless.

I used this recipe to take on a camping trip. I prepared it in my crock pot at home, then took it still in the pot, to the campsite for dinner our first night. The huge recipe will definitely feed a crowd. The adults really liked it, they gobbled it up. The kids didn't. I only gave it four stars because the flavor of the wine was pretty prominent. I don't think this recipe is the best choice if you are serving families.

This was okay, but not as good as I expected based on the previous reviews. The only thing I did different from the recipe was that I used a Mexican beer plus a TBS of apple cider vinegar instead of the wine, and I started with a fresh (not frozen) rump roast. Also, I was short on time and cooked for 2 hours on high and another 5 on low. I found Mexican hot tomato sauce - El Pato brand - easily at Wal-Mart in the Hispanic food section. It did not seem flavorful enough and if I make this again I'll add cumin and some hot sauce to it; right now it's decent for a homemade meal, but definitely not like what I get at the authentic Mexican restaurants I visit. Also, mine did not shred easily at all - maybe because I cooked part of the time on high(?). Next time I will try cooking this for 12 hours on low and hope that the additional time will be enough to break down the meat further. After shredding, I let the meat simmer in the juices for another 30 minutes and that helped the flavor get incorporated more than it had been. Some reviewers have said to add water to cover the roast completely. If you did that you wouldn't have shredded beef - you'd have beef flavored soup! You get PLENTY of juice from just following the recipe: anything more is overkill.

I have to say this is awesome! I hate it when people say a recipe is great and then proceed to tell all the things they changed...but I had to change only one thing, and that was the cut of meat. My grocery store only had a chuck roast, so it was a bit fattier than a rump. So, I had to strain off the extra fat from the juice, but then reduced it and added it back to the shredded meat for the tastiest taco/burrito filling ever! I used a mexican tomato sauce that I found at Safeway on the mexican food isle labled "tomato sauce with jalepeno" and it turned out amazing. Did everything else exactly as reccommended and will for sure use this again! Might try with beer just because several other reviewers said it turned out great that way. Thank you for the awesome recipe!

I used Picante sauce as a substitute for the tomato sauce, as well as a Corona as a substitute for the wine. I also included the onions in the mix, not later.

 After the nine hours I removed the beef and pulled. Then I strained the liquid and put the "thicker" portions (the veggies from the picante and the green onions)into my food processor with a small amount of the thinner liquid. Pulsed for a few times, then put the beef and sauce back into the pot for another 15 minutes.

 This was the best pulled beef I have ever eaten. Will use this recipe again for many other meals and with different meats.

 We used the leftovers for nachos the next day. Yum!

As written - not the kind of mexican flavor I was hoping for.  With many, many additions (enchilada sauce, hot sauce, red pepper flakes, cumin, chili powder, and lime juice) I was able to create something I really enjoyed.  But, after cooking and shredding as directed (even after letting the shredded meat simmer in the juices) there was no real seasoning for the beef to absorb.  Smelled like a very weak chili.  The idea to add the cilantro in at the end was a good one - definitely adds to the dish.

I made this for our Bunco weekend, and it was delicious. Here are my changes: couldn't find mexican tomato sauce, so used 1 regular tomato sauce and an equal amount of taco sauce. I also used a defrosted roast, cut into big chunks. I cooked it on high for about 6 hours and then turned it down. There was a lot of juice, which I saved,and put back in the meat after I shredded it. All 8 of us decided it was way better than ground meat!

Nope. Nothing special. Nothing special AT ALL. Ended up tasting like a slightly spicy italian roast...NOT Mexican.  If you have picky kids this would probably be a hit, but for those who who don't eat PB&J everyday for lunch, it just won't hit the spot.

Madeit but I couldn't find the mexican style tomato sauce so I used a couple of cans of Rotel diced tomatoes. I would say it turned out okay, but I couldn't get the roast to shred. It is a cool dish in the firehouse because you don't have to watch it and it is very simple.

I made a few changes to this but the basis of this recipe is great.  I didn't use roast.  My hubby bought chuck steaks which I had no idea what to do with, so I used them for this recipe and yum!!!  I rubbed them down with my favorite taco seasoning(frozen at that) and added canned green chiles to the recipe ~ otherwise, followed as stated.  Well, minus the cilantro because we don't care for it.  It was delicious after 8 hours on low in crockpot.  This made the best burritos and is so versatile could be a filling for many other dishes.

I have to agree with other reviewers, this is Fantastic. Each time I try a new recipe I follow the instructions and ingredients. This turned out really good. I just had a problem with the meat, but I think it was just "my" piece of meat, it didn't want to get tender, it cooked for 8 hours (defrosted) in the slow cooker, after this I was getting somewhat upset and cranked it to high for another 3 hours, and finally it was ready. I also agree with some one that suggested to add some cumin (that's just because I like it), I'll do that next time. Plus I now have left overs for at least 3 or 4 more meals. Thank you for this recipe it couldn't be easier to make.

I can barely explain how much we love this recipe!  We always freeze the left-overs for quick dinners later on.  It is fairly simple to make in the crock pot, just dump the ingredients in and let simmer all day.  We usually serve with cilantro rice, black bean and corn tortilla’s.

As I sit here writing this review, the smell of this recipe cooking in the oven is making me drool!!  I've had the roast in the oven all night at 225 degrees, and this morning when I got up the meat was almost falling apart. I shredded it and returned it to the juices to  let it sook for a few more hours while we're at church.  When putting this together I couldn't find any Mexican style tomatoe sauce in my grocery store, so I took 16 oz of salsa and pureed it. I also didn't have any white wine so instead I used apple juice.  I then poured in some home made taco seasoning (from this site), some onion powder, cumin and franks hot sauce.  At lunch time I'm doing to serve this with tortillas, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and guacamole.  I can hardly wait.  Diana, I will use this often!!

Everyone agreed that this was a good new way to make tacos. I didn't have mexican style hot tomato sauce, so I just used 1 15oz can of regular tomato sauce and spiced it up a bit with dashes of hot sauce and a dash of chili powder and cayenne pepper. The result (8 hours later) was very moist, easy to shred, and tasty meat. We used flour torillas and topped with our favorites such as lettuce, green peppers, green onions, and sour cream. My only complaint is that the meat was somewhat greasy. Perhaps it was MY meat but overall, it was still and easy & good meal.

This recipe is extremely easy to make.  I cooked this in my slow cooker all day.  There is nothing like coming home and having your whole house smell like good cooking!  Yum!  Great recipe!

My family liked this beef alot!  I used Corona instead of wine.  I also added some sea salt after I shredded the beef.  I thought it was going to be too spicy with the mexican tomato sauce but it was perfect.

We loved this, even my son who is picky had seconds. 
I used Herez salsa (just because I could not find the spicy tomatoes). After I shredded the beef I thickened the juices and added some of it to the beef for added flavor. 
I will be cooking this again!

Amazing!  If I could give this 10 stars I would.  I just put it in the crockpot in the morning and we had a delicious dinner waiting for us when we got home.  The only thing I didn't add was the green onions, definitely a keeper!

My boyfriend is Hispanic and I am Italian so I am better at cooking Italian foods rather than Mexican (I have no idea what I'm doing in that area) But I made this and he LOVED IT! Told me to add it to my recipe book! I used 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup mascato white wine. I also added a dash of cayenne pepper to make it a little more spicy. Best taco meat ever, we will not to back to using seasoning out of package!

I used a different cut of meat which made a difference in the shredding process. But let me tell you. It made no difference in how ridiculously yummy it was in the end. I wanted to drink the juice right out of my crock pot. No joke! You've got to try this.

I was really ready to love this, and like other reviewers, found it sort of underwhelming.  I love how easy it was, but then I just spent 30 mins. tweaking the spices to try to bring it to "really good," so the time savings wasn't as great as I'd hoped :-)  Here's what I added in the end, to make it tastier (I'm hoping that by tomorrow maybe it'll taste great!):  more salt and pepper, 2 tsp. cumin, 1/2 tsp white pepper, lime juice (1/2 lime), 2 T sugar (may sound crazy, but it brings out the flavor without actually making it sweet), a pinch of chili powder, and a dash of cayenne (jalapenos would have been good instead too).  The cayenne is really to keep my boyfriend from eating too much of it at once, plus to give it a little kick since it wasn't spicy at all.... and I'm not someone who likes my food super-spicy.  I'll probably make it again with these revisions- just be prepared to doctor it up some before you serve it.

Easy and delicious if you like spicy beef!  I loved this, but it was too spicy hot for my kids.  Next time I will use 1 can of the hot tomato sauce and 1 can of regular tomato sauce to make it milder for them.

Delicious!  It was very easy to make and it tasted incredibly good!  My son brought home two friends, unexpectedly, to watch TV.  I offered them the shredded beef tacos and they both went back for seconds.  One of them asked me for the recipe so he can have his mother make it at home.

This was so easy and SOOO GOOOD!!!  I do not use alcohol even to cook and so I used 1/2 C apple juice and 1/2 C cider vindgar instead.  It was great.  We ate it as tacos the first night and then burritos with the left overs.  I actually thought it might have been better the next day.  Great recipe.

Perfect shredded beef. I used 2 - 2 lb rump roast (they were outta the 4lbs) and defrosted overnight. I'm prob one of the few that DID use the wine vs. the beer. It worked wonderfully. I also double the liquids, up'd the garlic, shredded and tossed back in for the last hour. The leftovers went great as "Shredded beef Chimichangas" on this website. Thanks - my house of US Marines loved it! We're making it again manana!

Great Recipe for the working mom!! I put it in the crock pot and when I got home the meat was still a tiny bit difficult to shred...mind you this was about 11 hours after I started the crock pot. So I put it on high for 30 minutes and shredded it in intervals came out nicely. I did mess it up a little the first time I made it by only using regular tomato sauce. I ended up adding a ton of cayenne pepper and cumin to try and salvage it but it just tasted like tomato roast. The next time I made it I used Pace Picante and it tasted a lot better. Next time I make it I am going to add the taco seasoning that sounds like a good idea!!    Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Very good meat filling for tacos. I didn't have any wine so I did without and it was still good. I made it for a lot of people and them all liked it.

Excellent!  So easy and yet so tasty.  I used the Mexican spicy tomato sauce. My local grocery store had its own brand.  I was a bit worried about it being too spicy, but it was perfect.  We put it on tacos, but I have leftovers that I want to try with other things.

Holy cow, this is great! We had decided we were sick of ground beef tacos and wanted a different kind of meat. This was the first recipe I tried and we loved it! We used the left over meat for enchiladas a couple days later and they were wonderful too!

I liked this one, but some of my family thought it lacked the "taco" taste.  I would probably add more seasonings to the meat next time.

My 4 year old ate this and he hates EVERYTHING.  This was incredibly easy and simple.  I used ortega's salsa instead of the mexican tomato sauce(my grocery store didn't have it) and some Pace mild salsa.  This was delicious.

I'm giving the recipe 5 stars because everyone gives it such a great review!Could enchilada sauce be the same as mexican tomato sauce?  I haven't made this yet, but purchased the ingredients, and couldn't find the mexican tomato sauce?

I like the convenience of this meal.  However, it was not quite as flavorful as I would have hoped.  I will try it again and modify the spices.

I used a 4lb pork roast, beer instead of wine, one can of Mexican hot tomato sauce, and one can of diced tomatoes.  Cooked it on low for 8 hours and it fell apart!  Shredded it and let it simmer in the liquid for another 2 hours.  Added cilantro and onions right before we ate.  It was delicious!

This is my go to for mexican beef. It is awsome with soft corn tortillas and homemade salsa. I also use it for enchiladas and chimichangas. I do add a can of green chilis to the crockpot, too.

I just finished making this and I changed it a little, I use regular tomato sauce 15 oz. can and one small can of rotel hot, also used one cup of beef broth instead of the wine. It is great, next time I will cut back on the cilantro, it taste great anyway.  This will be a for sure for my family.

I could not wait to try this. The flavor was great I used a corona instead of the wine. I also had a chuck roast and used that too (not frozen), like some others. It didn't shred :( Oh well it was still tast chopped. I guess I'll have to splurge on the $20 rump roast to see if that makes a diff. Still great and will do again.  Update... I accidently left the crock pot with avout half the roast going for about 4 hrs after dinner... shredded like a dream. I would suggest wheter frozen or not the roast should still simmer all day,

My beef didn't shred well, but the flavor was good and different than what I usually do for tacos.  This had a little more zip than the usu. ground beef and chili option.  I wasn't sure what was meant by spicy tomato sauce...so I used a can of enchilada sauce and rotel tomatoes.  Was good.  Family loved it and it made many, many meals (lunch & dinner over 3 days) for my family of four!

this recipe was indeed heavenly. i'll never go back to fast food tacos! i did what others suggested and used corona beer instead of the white wine. i wasn't sure which one was the mexican tomato sauce at the store so i used an 8 oz bottle of taco bell medium taco sauce, about 1/4 of a jar of tostitos mild salsa which i had leftover and needed to get rid of, a 4 oz can of medium jalapeños, a packet of taco seasoning, and i squeezed in a wedge of lime.

This recipe was delicious! Very flavorful. I changed the recipe only by using a whole bottle of corona instead of wine, and adding water until liquid was 3/4rths up the meat.  I also cooked the meat unfrozen, on “high,” for 6 hours. On my tacos, with corn tortillas, I added mozzarella cheese, iceberg lettuce, hot taco salsa, and sour cream.

This smelled so good while cooking all day that the whole family couldn't wait to try it. However we were all disappointed in the outcome. The beef was tender, but not as tender as I expected, took some work to pull apart. That could just be the cut of beef, I did use a rump roast as called for. I did add some diced jalapenos, cumin, chili powder and paprika for more spice, other than that followed the recipe as written, was still bland tasting. It was like having plain roast beef tacos, My family all agreed to stick to my ground beef from now on for tacos. However I will give this a try again, spice it even more and use a different cut of beef, maybe a chuck roast instead, pull it apart an hour before serving and return it to the pot to soak up juices.

First time i was able to do a great shredded beef.  I used the beef for burritos and it was wonderful.  I like how you use a frozen roast, it makes for an easy meal to throw in the crockpot before work and enjoy when you get home.

Goodbye ground beef! This was amazing! 
I made some modifications. I used a bottle of beer in place of the wine and I added 2 tbsp taco seasoning. My husband who ordinarily dislikes Mexican food ate four servings and then announced that he was going to take the leftovers for lunch the next day. Even my picky kids gobbled it up joyfully. I love this recipe. It will definitely be in regular rotation.

I have made this a few times now and everyone time I have loved it.  My kids love it, too!  The cilantro and green onion really go well with the beef.  I do make mine with beer instead of wine, but other than that I follow the recipe.

This was amazing!  Used red wine instead of white because that was all I had; and used 1-8oz can of El Pato jalapeno salsa & 1-10oz cans of Rotel in place of the Mexican style tomato sauce.  Received rave reviews!  Thanks for the recipe.

Oh, so good.  This recipe makes the most amazing shredded beef which my family used to make burritos.  I followed the recipe and the meat didn't fall apart as I expected it to.  However I pulled it apart and chopped it a bit and it still was very tender and flavorful.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I just made these. I must say that I am somewhat disappointed with the outcome. With all the great reviews I expected more.  I felt that the meat was pretty flavor less.  I followed the recipe to a T.  I will try it again but try to get more flavor into the meat with some spices.

Mine didn't shread as easy as you would think. But it was wonderful. My family said they like that much better than ground beef tacos. Thanks for the recipe. Oh, I did like other reviewers and used 1 can tomato sauce, hot sauce, and a few other spices, like oregano, red pepper, and cayenne pepper.

This was excellent. I couldn't find the hot tomato sauce that the recipe calls for so I used a can of regular tomato sauce, and added a splash of hot sauce instead. This wasn't too spicy for my kids and meat just fell apart. I will definately make this again.

Very good and really easy. I didn't have mexican-style tomato sauce (just regular). Instead I added about a cup of homemade salsa to one can of tomato sauce and then followed the rest of the recipe as stated. It turned out well and the meat easily shredded. I also added a bit of cornstarch to the sauce when the meat was done to thicken the "sauce" a bit.

I was all set to make this recipe when I realized that I only had two of the ingredients--meat and white wine. I saw that another reviewer had used salsa in place of the hot tomato sauce. I had some green chile salsa on hand (it's not tomato based, but some brands have chopped tomatoes in them) so I used that instead.

It turned out fabulous! The meat was so tender and flavorful. 

To help shredded beef retain its flavor and moisture, I pull apart the roast then place the shredded meat back in the crock pot. I let it marinate in the juices for at least 15 minutes before serving.

This came out great. My husband actually like it. I thought it was too dry and tasteless at first, but after I shredded the beef and mix it well with liquid, it came out great. Also I left the leftovers in the crockpot and kept it in warm overnight, it dried the sauce out but the tanginess of the Mexican tomato sauce came out. We rolled it into a burrito with shredded cheese and freshly chopped onions. Very flavorful!! Will defintely become a regular in our house.

My husband loved this!  I couldn't really get into the flavor...it tastes more like Memphis barbecue to me!  HAHA!  I had to keep adding taco seasoning to finally make it taste like a taco should...but I just really didn't like it.  On the other hand, my husband ate the leftovers for 3 days for lunch...he thought it was wonderful!

Easy and delicious!!! Even the kids liked it. Just the right amount of spice for us. We used it in burritos and had plenty leftover for tacos on another night.

This was the quickest, easiest recipe I've ever made- and tasted wonderful! I added a packet of fajita seasoning & sauteed green, red, & yellow peppers along with some onions & ate fajita-style. My husband and I LOVED it! I will definately be adding this to my recipe collection!

I made this exactly as the recipe was written. It was very,very good. I had a fiesta party and all my guest enjoyed this. I don't like really spicy foods..but the canned hot tamatoe sauce really added a nice punch without making it extremely hot.  It did have a little kick to it but wasn't overwhelming. Thanks for sharing & I will make this again.

Very good recipe - this would be good with so many dishes.  I used it in soft tacos, with homemade tortillas, and it was delicious.  It would also be great leftover on nachos, or taco salad.  It was perfect for company - I cooked the meat in the crockpot half the day, then shredded it, put it back in the crockpot with the juices, and let it cook on low until we were ready for dinner.  Great and easy - thanks for the recipe!

Thank you for this recipe.  My husband has always hated my tacos and he hates taco mixes...this was GREAT.  I cooked a (thawed)rump roast in crock pot, but after several hours on low, it still wasnt shredding, so i have a pressure cooker for my microwave and finished it in that, but next time i will do the oven slow cook method and maybe even use oven bag to cook it...great taste! it was a big hit on Cinco de maya !!

This roast was quick and delicious, as well as easy.  I only used one can of the Mexican tomato sauce, and the meat was spicy enough.  The inner layers of meat were less spicy, so my kids loved it.  I will definitely make this again!

I have been using this recipe for years, it's been in tamales, enchiladas but can also stand on it's own. I use chicken broth when I'm short on wine and regular tomato sauce, if that's all I have and it is always great.

Used a chuck roast & it shredded beautifully.  I was afraid of the mexican hot tomato sauce.  I am a wimp when it comes to spicy hot.  So, I used fire roasted diced tomatoes and green chilis.  I also thought 8 tablespoons of garlic was too much, so I used half.  Although it was delicious, we ended up adding some tabasco sauce for an itty bitty kick and next time I will use more garlic.  Everyone liked it.

This was fabulous.  The only change I made was using minced garlic instead of crushed.  Rubbed it all over the roast.  Served with extra chopped cilantro and Mexican slaw.  Mixed up a pack of slaw with 1/4 cup each of mayo and sugar, added cumin, pepper, chopped pickled jalapeños and cilantro. So good!

I wasn't too sure if I liked this at first, but once it was all together in my taco - - OH YEA! it was good. It was super easy & quite tastey. Next time I'm going to try using a clear carbonated drink to go alcohol free. If anybody's tried that, please let me know. I was able to make some extremely tastey dishes with the leftovers.

I used ro tel diced tomatoes and green chilies and tomato paste instead of mexican style sauce.  After all was cooked I reduced by about 25%.  Was so good.  Thanks.  This is a good dish to do ahead for a big party you can always use soft shells put a little cheese inside and your good to go.

Fabulous recipe... and so easy!!  I've made this several times.  The only thing I change is I use a can of beer instead of the wine. Sent the last batch with my hubby & his friends on a fishing weekend. They ate it for lunch & dinner. One of the guys said he even had some for breakfast!  Might have to try that next time!!

This was a delicious recipe. The meat was very tender. I had a defrosted roast and cooked it all day in the crock pot with El pato and wine. I think I will try salsa next time as it was very "smokey" from the chipotle in the hot sauce. I will definately make again!

Awesome recipe.  Totally easy (even for a bachelor) and it worked for me with some shoulder chuck roast (or something like that).  I'm saving this one!!!

I agree with one reviewer, it does taste like regular pot roast.  I have to add taco seasoning & cumin to get that mexican flair into the meat.

Wow!  This was awesome!  I was kind of nervous about how it was going to turn out.  But that first bite was soooo good!  And it was really easy too!  My kids and husband liked it as well.  I can't wait to see how the leftovers taste!  Thanks!

I changed this recipe up a bit... I used red wine instead of white, and whisked the wine in with 1 can of beef broth, then 1 large can of tomato paste. I added 2 Tbsp. cocoa powder, 1 Tbsp. Worcestershire, 1 tsp red pepper and 1 tsp garlic juice to the sauce mix, then stirred in 1 whole minced onion and 2 tbsp. chopped jarred garlic. I spread that over the roast, then crock-pot cooked it. Wow! My family loved this! I gave it 4 stars because of the adjustments, but with them it deserves 5! This is so customizable!

I am going to give it 4 stars based on the rest of the reviews.  I tried the recipe but can't give it a true rating b/c I didn't follow the recipe correctly.  When I wrote out my shopping list I copied Mexican hot sauce and left out the tomato part.  Needless to say half way thru cooking the meat I had to dump out all the liquid and finish cooking it in beef broth.  I will try the recipe again but this time use the Mexican tomatoes!

We thought this was delicious.  It was so simple to make!  My husband doesn't like pot roast and at first wasn't even willing to try it, now he thinks we should make it for company.  I made it exactly as the recipe said and it was just right as far as being spicy.  My husband likes extremely hot/spicy and I like mild but we both thought it was perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This tasted like a roast with hot sauce on it to me. After I tasted it I tried to add some taco seasoning to help with the flavor as other reviewers has suggested but it still didnt help. My daughter said it was okay but I could see she wasnt a big fan either. It was okay but not great. I will not be making it again.

I loved this recipe. The beef was very tender and delicious. I served it with corn tortillas and Mexican rice. My family loved it. What I loved the most was how easy it was to make. Perfect for the working mom!!!!  Thanks for sharing.

This was yummy! I couldn't find the tomato sauce that this recipe referred to, so I just used mexican tomato sauce and added a chopped jalapeno for some spice. Went great on flour tortillas.

VERY GOOD! I wanted tacos, but didn't feel like the ground beef, so decided to try using another cut of beef. I tried this recipe and it tasted great. I did make some modifications. I omitted the wine. I added sauted hite onions, a pack of taco seasoning, cayenne pepper, a couple of diced adobe peppers, and diced tomatoes. The cilantro added a wonderful refreshing taste. I topped the tacos with sour cream, refried beans, green onions, shredded cheese, and salsa verde. These were awesome and I will be making this again!

I give it a two foe ease but I was not happy with my results.  I must have had a poor cut of meat because it was unshreddable and the juices were just tomato flavor, very little mexican taste. Had to cut it up for sandwiches with gravy - bummer.

Made twice, first time exactly as written.  I was eaten very quickly by friends and family.  Everyone liked it except for my sister who said it just tasted like pot roast. May have even been the meat that I had.  Second time I made it I tripled the recipe, used beer intead of wine and added 2 packets of taco seasoning, addl seasoning (chipotle, chili powder, and dried cilantro powder because I didnt have any on hand and my friends also hates it, and omitted the onions because I forgot to get them)  this time I got thumbs up from everyone.  Will make again and did pass the recipe on.

The recipe in a slowcooker I am sure is very good, but I would suggest being careful if you try to make it in the oven. It takes a lot of work to keep it from drying out. Make sure you cover it w/ some foil in the oven! I should have known that it would take more work to keep it tender since I was not making it in the slow cooker, but I ended up having to simmer the roast in a big pot on the stove in the sauce because it was too tough to even begin to try to shred when I first took it out of the oven. In the end I managed to salvage it and it tasted amazing!! Would have put it in the slowcooker if mine was big enough to fit a whole frozen roast!

So good and easy.  I used beef broth  in place of the wine.  I actually used this for restaurant style nacho; cheese sauce, green onions, sour cream, tomatoes and avocado. So yummy!

I made this for our cinco de mayo office food day.  It was a hit.  I changed the recipe a bit (that's why 4 instead of 5 stars) based on others' suggestions.  I used 1 bottle of Corona, 2 cans of ro-tels tomato/chili mix, and added some cumin seed.  I did add water like others suggested, but I don't think it was needed too much.  It did keep the roast moist at work, though.  I have several people that don't like terribly spicy food, so I toned down the cumin more than I would have liked, but it was a terrific dish!  Will definitely make again.

I used the shredded beef to make flautas. This was very tasty! I added a few other ingredients. I added Tonys cajun seasoning,yellow onion,cumin,chili powder,chulula hot sause,beef boulin cube,and rotel medium style with peppers. Instead of using mexican style hot tomato sause I used rotel.

Really liked this recipe. It was a good base for what I was trying to accomplish-Cafe Rio Pork Barbacoa. Thanks for sharing.   We added brown sugar, chili powder, lemon juice, garlic powder, cumin, s & p, dried cilantro, omitted wine and used a 2 pound pork roast instead of beef roast. 1 hour on high, 4 hours on low in the crock pot and it was done to shredding perfection. Will add more salt next time. Realize this is not the exact recipe, but like I said, it is a good base for another recipe-less food endeavor.

Turned out great. Definitely recommend that you cut the roast so that it's all submerged in sauce or broth while cooking - tends to get dry. Also followed advice and added cilantro and onions after shredding so that the cilantro didn't lose its flavor.

We followed the recipe exactly.  It shredded very nicely.  But we weren't crazy about the overwhelming flavor of the wine and the cilantro.  Next time, I will probably try the beer instead of wine and no cilantro (leave that for the pico de gallo served on top).

I used beer instead of wine (didn't have it), but other than that, kept recipe as is. Would like more seasonings in it to make it more "Mexican" tasting.

Very good, very easy, and highly complimented!  Changed a little.  Used rotel, salsa, and a mexican beer.  Crocked the rump roast on low for almost 10 hours.  Shredded and returned to the pot for another hour or so.  Added the same fresh ingredients as stated in the recipe.

This is an all time favorite recipe in our family.  I have made it multiple times and every time it's been a success.  The secret is shredding the beef and letting in sit in the sauce for about 30 minutes before you add the cilantro and onions.

Crock blahhhh..... I'd give it a five for ease, but there was no taste to our meat. Sorry, just didn't work for our family.

In general, absolutely fantastic! Very tender and has a nice bite. Definitely needs a bit of salt though. It really is more like a burrito or enchilada filling, but that's merely a quibble. Will definitely make again!

This recipe is great.  I switched the beef for chicken because I was making it for my bunco group.  They ate it up and everyone wanted the recipe.  I think the fresh cilantro at the end is what makes it great.  This one's a keeper.

This was a great recipe!! My whole family just loved it. I wasn't able to find the hot tomato sauce, so I used a can of regular tomato sauce and a can of hot rotel tomatoes. I only wish I had made more!!! This one is a keeper!

This was pretty good.  I was a little skeptical about cooking a frozen roast but it works.  I wasn't sure what the hot sauce was so I just used 1 can of tomatoes with green chiles and 1 can of beef broth.  I don't think the beef broth was necessary - it made too much liquid.  Next time I'm going to add 1-2 cans of tomatoes with chilies and then at the end, put a small can of diced jalapenos in to spice it up.

This was an easy recipe to put together and tasted good.  I made the mistake of putting crock pot on high.  It dried the meat out a little.  But this had a good taste.

Delicious!  I only had a 3 pound bottom round, and it was awesome.  This makes a lot and I can't wait to make it for our next get together.

I didn't have green onions but the recipe was still very delicious! I actually let mine cook overnight, degreased the liquid, shredded, added back and cook until dinner time in the crockpot and it made a cheaper (usually tougher) cut of meat perfect! I used leftovers for burrito pie and put some in the freezer for a future meal. Wonderful and easy recipe!

Excellent. Couldn't find the hot tomato sauce and used Newman's Own salsa as suggested by another reviewer. I cooked it all in the slow cooker and shredded the meat when it was done, then I put in back into the slow cooker for about 30 minutes. The meat came out so delicious. I served on warm corn tortillas with onions, chopped cilantro, and lime wedges.

This was pretty good.  I used a frozen rump roast and followed the directions as written.  I added 1 jar of salsa with the rest of the ingredients and it came out delicious.  I used it for tacos one night and then for enchiladas another night.  I was even able to freeze some too.

My husband is very picky about his meat, it must taste just right.  This recipe was very, very good!  I used it for tacos, burritos and chili.  My friends had the chili at a party and couldn't say enough about the flavor!

We really enjoyed this one -- thanks for submitting Diana!  The only change I made was to substitute the white wine with dark beer.  The Mexican style hot tomato sauce is a MUST!  Next time, I may even add another can of sauce along with some jalepeno slices to spike up the heat.  The addition of chopped green onions and cilantro at the end really is a nice touch.  This meat will be great too for beef enchiladas.

Wondering if using a 2lb roast could have made that much difference. It was awful. I will try again w/bigger roast because I think it could be good
