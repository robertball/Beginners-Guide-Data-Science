Thanks Diana for a great, easy to make recipe.  We used frozen octopus we'd had for some time, 2 large regular onions as that was what we had in the house and I just added some chopped greek olives.  It was 'out of the park' delicious  We served it with whole wheat pasta, green salad & crusty panini rolls.  So easy, so delicious.  Left overs the next day were just as scruptious!

I will ABSOLUTELY make this again, thank you! 
Baby octopus is one of my favorite things to eat but if you don't get it right it's just wrong. 
This...is fantastic. 
The time it takes is worth it. I deglazed the sauce pan with Brandy after the reduction part which I think adds a little depth of flavor and added a Â½ teaspoon of red curry paste because I like everything spicy. I also used just 1 very large onion only because my daughter (11) isn't a big onion fan (yet). Otherwise everything here is absolutely spot on! I served this over pain white rice. 
This will not disappoint. Thanks again!! 
Definitely making this again.

Best octopus recipe I've tried.  It was so delicious the kids fought over the remaining portion.  Even my less than adventurous wife raved about it.

Made it for dinner tonight.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and it came out better than I had expected for something simple.  I think patience was the key ingredient.

So easy!  Though I had whole baby octopus and had to look up how to clean them.  Even my young children loved this.  I supplemented the octopus with a cuttlefish and I bet squid would be fabulous as well.

i was nervous to begin as I've never made octopus. Such an easy to follow recipe, that tastes great. 
i did add half a teaspoon of minced garlic and quarter cup of pitted and halved greek olives  a few minutes before the crushed tomatoes.

Excellent!  After cooking the onion I had the squids and cook them for 2 minutes then white wine to get the sugars from the pan. As some recipies suggest had a bit of paprika. They were tenders  best ever .... I did use squids because I did not have octopus it was so good ??

Seriously, EIGHT ONIONS?   That's the only reason I'm giving this recipe four stars instead of five.   This delicious dish definitely improves after chilling overnight and reheating.   I served it over fresh homemade French fries tossed in Cavender's Greek seasoning -- that fabulous stuff in the yellow container.

Like any foodie who hates to go out in -25 degree weather, I used what I had on hand.   My octopus was on the small side of two pounds, so I added half a cuttle fish, peeled and cubed.   I added two stems of fresh oregano with the bay leaves.   The only other modification was using TWO large red onions, and not adding them until the ten minutes so they retained some texture.   Absolutely fabulous!
