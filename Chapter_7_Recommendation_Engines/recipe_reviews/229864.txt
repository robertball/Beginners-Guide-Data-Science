This is the first time I've cooked goose. This recipe was fantastic. I've heard that goose has a gamey taste, but there was none with this recipe. I plan to use it again in the future.

My favorite recipe for goose so far. My husband brought home 22lbs of breasts this year and I don't love goose. I used 5lbs of breast instead of whole geese. I added other spices for our tastes (cayenne, garlic, pepper) and water with corn starch to make more of a stew. So good. the base recipe is good too, I just tweaked for our preferences

Very good! My kids had second helpings. As noted by others that it was bland I added a garlic and herb spice to the mix. I served it over mashed potatoes. Saving this recipe with the additional spices.

This is really great! Kids, friends, and the hunter approved as well. Goose is not my favorite food, but this is a nice way to use it up. I served with mashed potatoes and mashed sweet potatoes on different occasions. I almost want to give it 5 stars, but it is goose haha.

This was delicious!

I cut the recipe in half and only used one goose. I also left out the mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them. I ate it over greens and my husband had it over mashed potatoes. Very tasty and the goose turned out melt-in-your-mouth tender .   I used one whole 7 pound domestic goose from our farm.

It was alright, not a whole lot of flavour, just tasted like a standard stew.

It is BY FAR the best tasting easiest recipe I have tried and the whole family loves it!   from now on this will be my go to for goose! 
  I have to add that it was a  very tight fit for two whole geese and three cans of soup concentrate. I have  A 6 quart crockpot. I cut up the two geese and jam packed it in and barely had room . But I'm glad I did it. 
Thanks much
