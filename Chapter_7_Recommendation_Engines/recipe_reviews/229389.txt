10.25.17  If you’re a fan of pimento cheese, give this recipe a try.  I know, I know it sounds a bit strange with this combination of ingredients for a dessert, but it works!  I used sugar-free Jell-O®. skipped the sugar completely (would do that again), pineapple in its own juice, and light whipped topping to make it more diet friendly.   The pimento cheese gives the dessert a bit of a chunky texture (and that's OK), but it’s very light and creamy   This one’s definitely outside-the-box for me, but we liked it and I would make again!
