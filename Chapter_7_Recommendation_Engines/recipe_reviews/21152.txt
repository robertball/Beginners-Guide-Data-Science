I used fresh cut up strawberries that had been mixed with a little sugar.  
I thought it was great, and so did everyone else that tried it.  Thanks for sharing!!

THIS WAS GREAT! I took it to work this morning, and it was gone in 10 minutes!  The dough gets pretty tough (with all the flour) and turns into a ball and I thought it wouldn't turn out good, but I was wrong. Much better than banana bread.....and I love bananas!

Thanks for sharing Corwynn!

This is an amazing, unique bread! People said there was too much oil, so I substituted some of it for milk and water. I also tasted the batter and decided it was not sweet enough, so I added about a tablespoon of brown sugar. It was absolutely wonderful! Thank you!

I used fresh strawberries that were sprinkled with a little bit of sugar. I made little loaves and gave it away and everyone thought it was good.

I had some frozen strawberries that were begging to be used in something so I made this recipe this afternoon, except that I halved it for 12-muffins, baked at 350 for 30 min. The batter is the consistency of cookie dough so it was very thick and difficult to blend. The amount of oil was staggering (IMHO), so I scaled it to 1/4 c. oil & 1/4 c. applesauce. End result was a decent-tasting muffin, especially when eaten hot w/ melty butter (albeit a bit dense and an unusual texture that I couldn't quite put my finger on, possibly due to the berries being of the frozen variety?) so I'm not too sure that I would make this recipe again.

I was not crazy about this recipe. It calls for way too much oil.  I made it a second time using a mixture of butter and applesauce and liked it much better. The flavor is not exceptional either.

This was excellent - and I don't care for bread!!!  I had left over strawberries I didn't know what to do with... I used a basket of fresh strawberries.  I decreased the oil by 1/4 cup but added about that much water to keep it moist and make it easier to fold.  I also used pecans because I prefer those to walnuts.  And after I put the batter in the loaf pans, I sprinkled cinnamon sugar.  The bread came out beautiful - brown and crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside.  I loved it and it's my new "regular" bread for my kids' snacks and gifts for the neighbors!

In the end this was an OK bread.  When I was making it the dough was very dry and wouldn't have formed a loaf had I not added the juice from the strawberries.  With the juice it seemed to work fine.

I followed the recipe but my breads came out very dense and the flavor was not there.  I used fresh strawberries, perhaps that was the problem...Too disappointing to try again.

This was a good use of some fresh strawberries I cut up & mixed w/sugar this summer!  It was a nice alternative to banana or zucchini bread & my boys liked it too.

I used 1/2 all purpose flour and then 1/2 whole wheat flour.  There was a ton of oil in this recipe.  I thought it would have been a little less crumbly. It was a little dry too, but still good.  My husband put ice cream on it.

I scaled the recipe down in half and substituted the oil for about 3/4 cup of applesauce.  I had some frozen strawberries and blackberries that I threw in there.  I also added some nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon to the dry mix.  Thought it tasted great and was so easy to make.

Nice flavor, but it turned out dry and not-so-tender.  Most of my other sweet bread recipes call for more sugar; next time, I will try increasing the sugar to 1 1/4 or 1 1/3 cups.

Made for my grand Daughter's Beta Club bake sale. Some with nuts and some without. It was a big success.
