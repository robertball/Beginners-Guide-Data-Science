Outstanding!  1 tbsp of rye isn't quite enough,  I used 1/4 cup of sliced almonds, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and about 1/4 cup of Gibson's Finest rye whiskey.  Good with pretty much any crackers you can think of.

Even those relatives don't like brie LOVED this recipe.  We used triple sec as we didn't want to buy more expensive Grand Marnier for such a small amount.  It gave the same orange flavor and blended really well with the brown sugar and pecans.  May not wait for the next party or holiday to make this again!

This is one of our favourites - try it also with Grand Marnier and serve with triscuits and slices of tart green apples - delish!

I love this dish.  I have served it as an appetizer and as a dessert especially on those evenings when you have to whip up something fast. I have experimented with many variations and one of my favorites is 1/4 brown sugar, 1/4 sliced almonds and 1/4 Amaretto.  I serve it with a stack of unsalted crackers and some apples (if I have time to "lemonize" them) if in a rush, a pile of fresh, cold, seedless green grapes. If I am serving this as a dessert I will usually buy some brownies from "Divine Brownies" each one with a different flavor and frosting, cut them diagonally, it makes a beautiful presentation, just so I have something else to offer if someone doesn't like or can't have cheese.

I really liked this recipe.  My only complaint is that you need a way to keep the brie warm.  It is not good once it cools off.

I have been making this for years. Only I use Cognac or Brandy, add a little extra of course. I have also use Grand Marnier, and that's excellent too.

This was the best Brie topping I have made!  I used 1/4 cup of Pumpkin Spiced Whiskey and slivered almonds for the nut.  I thickened it while heating with a little cornstarch slurry.  We could not stop eating it!

I used Southern Comfort (more than called for) and almonds.  Also, I boiled the sauce a bit in order to thicken it.  Delicious!

This was the first recipe that came up when I searched "Brie and pecans" - it is super easy and was very tasty - the combination of the brown sugar and the rye whiskey was very nice and had almost a maple type flavour.

This was just ok for us.  I really had expected it to have more flavor, but it was just kind of blah.  I used Bulleit Rye whiskey and almonds in place of pecans.  I had to bake it longer to get the brie melty and warm.  THANKS, for the recipe!

I was in a bit of a rush and didn't measure anything out, but approximated 1/4 cup of each of the topping ingredients.  I also left the brie in the oven a bit too long, but luckily it was in a small baking dish so everything was a big gloopy mess that tasted amazing.  I think in the future I'm going to do it all exactly the same way.  I won't be able to eat brie again without thinking of this.

Used bourbon because we didn't have any rye whiskey.  It was really good but would have been even better with the rye as it would have made it less sweet.   Next time I would decrease brown sugar slightly and increase whiskey a little.  This recipe is so fast and easy.  It is definitely a keeper!
