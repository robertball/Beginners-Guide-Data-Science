We give this a 5! Super good recipe. The only issue we had was that there was not nearly enough broth but this could be that we used a little bit more of each of the veggies than called for. My husband found it a bit salty so next time we will not add any extra salt but super delicious and we cannot wait to make it again (though with the extra broth we added we have enough for two more meals at least)!

I can't believe no one has posted a review of this wonderful recipe!   I grew up eating minestrone with small chunks of beef in it.  This recipe with sausage is sooooooo much better!  The broth is delicious, and the vegetables tender and flavorful.  I only had white wine on hand so I had to substitute.  It was still outstanding in every way.  I will be making this often!

I'm always looking for a quick and tasty soup. This fits the bill. I made some adjustments. I used bulk sweet Italian sausage.  I added: 
1 small chopped green pepper and 1  yellow (summer squash). I added 1 can of rinsed and drained low sodium kidney beans. I used 3 cans of low sodium beef broth and 1 can of low sodium chicken broth. For more flavor, I added 2 T. of Worcestershire sauce , 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes, and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder. I would suggest cooking 20 min. before adding the beans and the pasta, then continue to simmer for 10 min. The pasta will continue to cook as the soup cools.
I will definitely make this again.

It was good. Minestrone-y, but sort of stewish. I added rutabaga and sauteed it with the potatoes. Then I drank the rest of the bottle of wine with my sister.

Good foundational blueprint for minestrone which, by definition, is simply a vegetable soup (meat optional) that includes making use of the vegetables you have at hand. Every time you make it, it will be a variation of what you made before.  I did the same, following the general recipe but with some liberty – added garlic and fresh parsley, mini beef tortellini for the pasta, ceci (garbanzo) beans rather than Great Northern, eliminated the potatoes (not a fan), skipped the zucchini only because I didn’t have any, used my own tomatoes put up from my garden, some leftover mushrooms, and added some leftover spinach at the end, just long enough to wilt it. No need to measure anything; toss in broth, pasta, tomatoes and vegetables as it pleases you.  This soup was a lifesaver tonight – after a day of a couple of long mishaps that ate up most of my day, this came together quickly to produce a nutritious, delicious and satisfying meal.

This is probably the best soup that I have ever had, it's definitely the best I've ever made myself. The only problem is that the broth needed to be doubled. Otherwise it is AMAZING.

This is absolutely delicious.  I did find it needed more broth even though I did not add extra vegetables.  I added two additional cans beef broth and 1/4 cup ketchup.  SUPER

Great soup recipe.  Good vegetable/sausage/spices ratio.  I made a lot of substitutions based on what I had, and it turned out great.  I used green beans, carrots, black beans and chicken stock for the beef broth and red wine.  We used mild instead of hot as well.

Hearty is right! This soup is very filling and was perfect on this freezing Colorado night. I doubled the broth, using a combo of both chicken and beef bases, along with the cup of wine (I would reduce that a bit next time; maybe just 1/2 - 3/4c). This is definitely a "clean out your fridge" kind of soup. My version: Johnsonville's half pork/chicken sausage (no grease!) pinched into dime-sized pieces, like tiny meatballs. I diced up an onion, a stalk of celery, 3 carrots, 1 large potato, some leftover mushrooms and half a green pepper, 1 can of cannellini beans, and 1 can of petite diced tomatoes with juice. Simmered for closer to 45 minutes and decided to throw in a handful of small shell pasta about 20 minutes before it was done. I also tossed in a couple large garlic cloves, added both garlic/onion powders, a few shakes of dried parsley and extra basil in place of oregano (not a fan). Served with Stef's Super Cheesy Garlic Bread, also from this site, we had a delicious, flavorful dinner that will be repeated. Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow when the flavors have really melded. Will probably also freeze the remainder, as it made a HUGE pot!

Good recipe, made a few changes.  Used chicken sausage to make it healthier, added carrots and garlic, and didn't use extra salt but most importantly doubled the amount of broth and still should have used more.  There is so many ingredients that the broth is absorbed so you may need 2.5 to 3 times more broth.  Lastly I added the pasta and beans at the end.  I should have added the pasta 12-15 minutes before serving and the beans 3 minutes before.  The beans were mush being cooked for 15 minutes.  Overall great taste and a hearty meal that stands on its own.

Great soup! I used sweet Italian sausage, instead of hot (I'm feeding kids). I sauteed the sausage with the pepper, onion, and celery in a little cooking spray. Then I dumped that into my crock pot with all the rest of the ingredients, except for the pasta. I used tomato juice instead of red wine, and diced Italian style tomatoes for the whole tomatoes. I let it cook on low all day long, and then added the pasta at the end and let it cook on high for 30 minutes. This made a very nice soup that was delicious and kid friendly, and packed with veggies. Next time, I think I will double the broth so I can add even more veggies, such as green beans, carrots, green pepper, yellow squash, kidney beans, spinach, parsley, etc. Though, I thought the broth to ingredients ratio with the recipe as written was perfectly fine. But then, I prefer a thick, almost chili or stew-like soup.

This soup is an absolute winner.  I have made it many times.  I too add additional broth, some Italian seasoning, and corn.  I cut back pasta to 1 1/2c.  My husband is actually quite a good cook and he LOVES this!

I stopped by my Mums house on the way home from work and she asked me if I wanted to try the soup she made, suffice it to say I stopped by the store on my way home and picked up the ingredients. AWESOME! I usually keep my Minestrone vegetarian and also have never added wine but it was great. Bless my Mum who always finds time to try new recipes.

What an awesome recipe!  Like others I put my own spin on it.  First and foremost, no wine in this house, I replaced it with 2 cups of chicken broth, because it's what I had on hand, and 2 cups instead of one because I increased the veggies quite a bit.  The only thing I omitted was the potatoes, I don't care for them.  And I added the following: a yellow pepper, a yellow squash, cabbage (I just couldn't imagine minestrone without it), garbanzo beans, and red kidney beans.  I also tossed a piece of parmesean cheese in - a trick I learned from the Carraba's recipe for minestrone.  As someone suggested I waited until about 10-12 minutes from the end to add beans and pasta.  I felt this would insure a more al dente texture.  Oh, and I used Johnsonville Mild ground sausage.  I meant to buy the links, but when I got home I found that I'd gotten the ground, so I made little meatballs out of it and sauted them up as directed.  Oh, and I tossed in some garlic and onion powders - they're like my "salt and pepper to taste."  And I salted and peppered to taste too, which included adding no salt, although I didn't find it salty, I didn't find it laking salt, and thought it would be better for individuals to add their own if desired.  This is an awesome place to start a minestrone, and we will have plenty for days!

Best Minestrone soup I've ever had! My wife makes this recipe all the time! The only thing we do different is instead of Johnsonville Italian sausage we use a pound of ground JIMMY DEAN hot sausage. This makes for a great texture and it blends so well with the other ingredients. This soup actually brings a smile to face down to the last drop! Thank you for posting this.

I followed what the other reviewers said and added extra broth as it needed it after I put extra vegetables in it. It was perfect as served but leftovers were not to be had as the noodles continued cooking from the heat of the soup and became overdone. Will remember to take it off burner sooner so we can have leftovers too.

Very good!  A touch spicy. I added more broth than called for, skipped the potato, and added carrot. Was better the second day, when I pulled it out of the fridge and removed the solid, spicy grease.

This is a delicious bowl of comfort food! Love the extra zing from the sausage. I will use the mild or sweet sausage next time as it was too spicy for some.

I add any leftover vegs. Always turns out delicious. Sub kidney beans whenever I don't have white.  I boil the pasta separately so that it doesn't soak up the broth.

Delicious. My husband wasn't thrilled when I told him what was for dinner, he isn't a fan of minestrone but he ended up  loving this recipe. I think it was the spicy Italian sausage that made him happy. I added an extra zucchini, minced garlic, and some tomato sauce that I needed to use up. Easy and quick recipe.

I love minestrone, but this was truly fantastic! We don't like cooked pepper, so just used more of the other veggies. Not sure it really needs the potato at all. You can really use any sausage, casings removed, that suit your particular taste. And, like others said, it was super salty. Can not figure out why and I didn't add any extra salt at all. In the end I added hot water to curb the salt; you could also just add additional canned, and unflavored, tomatoes. Also, it freezes well.

This was super yummy! Perfect for a cool fall day. I added garbanzo beans, kidney beans and green beans for variety, but otherwise followed the recipe. I did use Johnsonville brand ground hot Italian sausage so I didn't have to remove any casings. The spicy sausage really makes this soup stand out!!!

This was excellent. I used smoked sausage instead of links, mushrooms, pinto beans, onions, and summer squash. My baby went crazy over the broth, and it was enjoyed by my six-year-old as well. A great, adaptable recipe to what you have on hand.

great recipe  The Johnsonville sausage makes a difference.  I have used other brand of sausages in minestrone but these have a nice and unique flavor.  I used the Johnsonville Italian sausage patties as I could not find links.   Oops I forgot the wine but it was still great.  I am not going to forget this ingredient today.
