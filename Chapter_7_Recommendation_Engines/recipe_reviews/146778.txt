I made this salad for Father's Day and everyone loved it!  I added a few extra things which went very well with this. I added some crumbled bacon, mushrooms, and diced onions.  The best part ive been asked to make it again for a party my father is having

yummy! got rave reviews as a side dish for an easter brunch. wasn't sure how the strong taste of the balsamic would go with strawberries, but i need not have worried. adults and kids alike raved...big hit! didn't need all the dressing so kept it for a regular salad the next day ;)

I cut down the amount of sugar by half in the dressing. Even though I tripled the amount of spinach and used twice the amount of strawberries, added string red onions, there was still lots of dressing left over. Everyone loved it, all the salad was gone, next time, will add more spinach and more berries.

we loved it!
It gives a full-flavor to the "same old"
spinach salad with strawberries and toasted
pecans.  I loved that the carbs are low,
and still rich in flavor.
Easy to make, keeps well in the refrigerator.
The touch of sesame oil kicks it up a bit along
with both sesame and poppy seeds.

Great salad!  I cut the dressing ingredients in half, plus reduced the amount of sugar (I don't care for Splenda).  I still had dressing left over, which is fine, because I will use it up.  Just wanted to note this for those who don't like things leftover after making a recipe.

This is soooo good!! I changed it a bit...1/3 c each of oil and balsamic vinegar instead of 1/2 c each. added chopped hazlenuts, thin sliced red onion and I used a baby green mix that was 50% spinach. also used a t of sesame oil instead of 1/2 t. Left out the poppy seeds...did not have any. This salad rocks!!! even had extra dressing.
