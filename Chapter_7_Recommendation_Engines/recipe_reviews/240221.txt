Great flavors - our favorite.   I didn't peel the apple, there is no need and it gives the stuffing a bit more color. I used broth, instead of boiling water.   You are going to have to play with the amount of broth / water you need.   I needed more, but we like our stuffing to start out pretty moist - then when baked is just right.  I baked in a cast iron skillet - the bottom is crispy and the stuffing moist.   
Add celery if you like it.  Also, dried cranberries would be a great addition.

This is a really easy recipe with good results.  I love mixing cornbread stuffing with sausage and some kind of fruit-in this case, apples.  I loved it and my roommate who self-professes to dislike stuffing actually ate it - a whole bowl and left none for the dogs to lick-up.  I recommend this recipe for its ease and taste.
