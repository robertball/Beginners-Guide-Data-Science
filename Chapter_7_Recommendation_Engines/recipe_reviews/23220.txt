Good recipe.  I used plain yogurt. Garlic would be a nice addition. Very quick and easy.

The recipe has potential, but there was WAY too much parsley for my taste. My husband, who loves strong flavors, scraped the sauce off his mussels. The second batch of sauce I made, I used 1/4 cup of parsley, 1/8 c. fresh oregano, a 1/2 cup of feta cheese and three cloves of garlic. Awesome that way.

We enjoyed the mussels, but next time we would use garlic.  I used plain yogurt.

Made as written except that I used garlic like the other reviewers mentioned. Everything was great until I went to add the Greek yogurt and then it became a big flop. It separates and does not ever reduce down into a sauce. I will make again but only if I ditch the yogurt. I knew better and just as I expected the yogurt was a disaster. Sorry.
