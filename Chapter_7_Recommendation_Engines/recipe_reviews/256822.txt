Ok, so, I wanted this to be this beautiful dessert, with the pears all fanned out on top in a gorgeous pattern . . . but that didn't happen. BUT - this is DELICIOUS! OMG . . . really awesome! I learned a few things while making this. 4 pears is too many for a 9" tart. I ended up poaching 3, and only ended up using about 2-1/2 of them (they were delicious, so I just ate the leftovers). There is too much of the frangipane filling as well. I used all of it, and when I placed the pears on top, the pears sunk into the filling (hence not the beautiful presentation that I was hoping for) and while it was baking, the filling went over the edges and onto the baking sheet (good call on having a baking sheet under the tart pan)! I also didn't use blanched almonds. I just ground them up in my food processor, which I'd do again.  The flavor is wonderful though, so I'd definitely make this one again. Oh, and that poaching liquid - I strained that and have been  using it to sweeten a cup of tea. It's just lovely!
