I cooked with the marinade and it worked perfectly when I doubled the amount of ingredients.

My husband and I thought this marinade was awful!  I marinaded it overnight...maybe that was too long.  I won't be making this one again.

No changes were made but feel the combination did not allow ingredients to reach full flavor.  Next time no Marsala and will use garlic, honey, and a herb basting oil. I ate it and found myself critiquing while my husband would not want  it again.
