really good recipe! I originally had made filling for homemade Beirocks but I didn't want to go through the tedious hassle of the yeast dough so I decided to make them into empanadas instead. Ground beef filling with onions, cabbage and shredded carrot, plus I added sliced pickled hardboiled eggs to each empanada. I used the leftover egg whites with water instead of the yolk to brush up on the outside. I'm adding a pic.

It's good...kind of like a light, airy biscuit. I cut the recipe in half since it is just me eating it.

I actually tripled this recipe, using 1/2 butter flavored crisco & 1/2 butter bc I had some other projects in mind. Not only were my pumpkin, hatch pepper & cheese empanadas delish, but my other projects got lots of compliments as well. One was a baked brie en croute I brought to a Thanksgiving gathering; the other was a pumpkin pie I made for family bc the one at the gathering was too weird for my hubby. This is my new go-to crust recipe!

Great recipe.  I am not great at rolling out dough, so I made 6 instead of 12 with this recipe.  But very tasty and I liked that you don't have to chill the dough.
