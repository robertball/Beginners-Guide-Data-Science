Chocolate gravy is a recipe passed on down from my great-grandma - however, "my" recipe has milk and vanilla extract instead of water - a much tastier gravy!!

I've been looking for a chocolate gravy recipe like my grandma's for a LONG time.  This one comes the closest, so far.  Next time, I will add less sugar and a bit more chocolate, though.  Very good!

I have been looking for a chocolate gravy recipe! This is great! My grandmother, who has passed on, used to make this and no one knew her actual recipe. (She used a little of this and a little of that) :) Thanks! This is great!

And all my freinds thought I was crazy.
My Great-Great-Grandmother made this and it has been passed down through the generations. I'm so glad that I'm not the only one that likes Chocolate Gravy over warm buttered biscuits.
For something even easier.. we use warm choclate pudding. the kind you have to cook...Thus Biscuits and Pudding...
I'm so happy that I found this recipe.

people thought I was crazy when I would tell them about the "hot chocolate" and biscuits we used to have for breakfast...They always thought it was the drink and when I would explain that it was chocolate gravy they would give me the weirdest looks...Now I know I am not alone...Thanks for the recipe..Now my kids will get to have hot chocolate and biscuits too...

I grew up eating my grandmothers chocolate and biscuits, this recipe is too sweet and not thick enough.  I had to keep adding more flour to get it as thick as I like it.

I use milk and corn starch instead of water and flour. Makes it creamier and thicker....

My mom used to make this for my brother and I all the time when we were kids. He still comes over when I make it. People think we are crazy when we talk about it but don't knock it till you try it!!!

I use milk, too.  And I cook it in the microwave and stir it every two minutes until it's thickened.
