This is my second time making these. The first time I filled them to the top with the brownie batter and that was too high. The taste, however, was wonderful! So I tried again and this time I filled just under 3/4 of the way with the brownie batter. If you're looking for something a little different for your cookie trays, you should try these! Of all the cookies I've made this year, and I've made quite a few, these by far are the favorites of everyone in my family. SO yummy! :)

I was very impressed with this recipe....it actually tastes like a chewy fudgy brownie in a mini pie form.  My variation was to skip the cherry and to top them off with toasted coconut and drizzled with caramel.  I had no problems working with the dough unlike a previous user and I disagree with the idea of needing sugar in the crust, it is supposed to be like a pie crust and you don't put sugar in a pie crust.  My only problem with this recipe is that it doesn't make nearly as many servings as it claims to.  I was able to get just 18 small servings out of the recipe.  I look forward to making this again and trying out new variations!

When I finished making the dough for the shell, I thought, "You can't make a very tasty crust with just flour, butter, and cream cheese." I tasted it, and it sucked. So I added about 1/2 cup sugar. Much better. I also had to add a couple sprinklings of water in order for it to actually make a dough that I could form into balls.

The finished product tastes pretty good, but because it wasn't easy to shape the dough into shells and spoon the chocolate into them without getting chocolate everywhere, mine turned out pretty ugly. Next time I might use a plastic bag or pastry bag to pipe the chocolate into the shells.

I also sprinkled crushed peppermint candies on top of them halfway through the baking time, instead of using a cherry on top.

All in all, these were pretty average. Fairly tasty, not too pretty, and needed some adjusting.

I had no troubles with this recipe.   I made no changes to the recipe except the cherries- I didn't use them.  I made them for a co-workers birthday and she loved them so much I decided to take them for a house warming party the same weekend.  I was asked for the recipe.  They had simple ingrediants and were easy to prepare.  I made sure to chill the dough for an hour and it helps a lot.  It was also faster for me because I have pampered chef tart press.  It makes shaping them a breeze!  Thanks for this posting!

this recipe's pretty good! but there'd be a couple of changes i'd make

firstly i'd bake the tarts in the oven for about 15 mins before filling it with the chocolate mixture

secondly, i added vanilla essence

thirdl, fill the tart shells up to only 3/4 full. the filling tends to rise 

the tart pastry tasted good without addition of sugar. The chocolate fudge is sweet enough.

The only reason I take one star away is that I never feel the mixture for the tart cups makes enough; for me, it yielded 18 instead of 24.  I just upped the cream cheese, butter and flour a bit and made more.  These are a great hit with all of my friends and family.  They are a nice surprise.  Be careful though; don't overcook because if the cups come out too brown, the insides are a bit chewy.  Also, don't walk away from the chocolate and butter while they are melting or the mixture will stick, non stick cookware or not.  Great recipe overall.

I followed the recipe and the crust turned out great.  If you chill it like the recipe recommends it is easy to work with.  I made these this weekend and everyone loved them and wanted the recipe!  Thanks!

I found this to be one of the easiest desserts I've ever made, and if you don't count the time for chilling the dough, it was one of the fastest too!  They turned out great, are easily adaptable depending on the crowd (I topped them with a dollop of whipped cream and fresh strawberries), and everybody loves them!  One major benefit is that there are a small number of ingredients and the recipe is easy to remember, so I can whip these up anytime, anyplace for a quick, crowd pleasing dessert.  I also think the dough makes a great, simple, tasty shell for other desserts... ex: fill with whipped cream and fresh fruit, or angel food cake topped with strawberries, etc.  I've definitely given this recipe to all my friends!

Everyone at the party loved these!  I made half with pecans and half plain.  I was able to make exactly 24 because that's how I divided the dough up.  1/2 to 3/4 full of filling is plenty.  I piped heavy whipped cream on top of the cool tarts and dried the cherries with paper towels before putting them on top.  Rave reviews!  Thank you for the recipe!!!

dough didn't work. I used mini mini tins and the dough just sank and turned into dough "(flat) cookies" when I tried to prebake the dough. Dough tasted ok a bit buttery.Maybe shoulda used a bigger pan

The filling of these is great.  Maybe it is just my sweet tooth talking, but the outer crust needs some sugar.  It was just very doughy with not much flavor.  These are good, bite-sized treats, perfect for parties, dressed up for the holidays.  The outside just needs something.

love this, followed other suggestions, only filled 3/4 full.  Two things helped me: I used ice water to dip my fingers in to mold crust, and I put chocolate mixture in a baggie to get into the crust. Very simple, but a bit time consuming.  I did not add cherries; instead I dusted with powdered sugar and topped with a fresh raspberry.  Delicious, and this will be one of my "go to" desserts.

Made these for a tailgate -- everyone loved them.  Had no trouble making 24 tarts in my pan with the ingredients as shown in the recipe. Get a tart tamper, such as Pampered Chef sells, and you will have no trouble making the crusts.  Did not use cherries, but did add pecan pieces.  Might add a couple shakes of salt next time I make these. They puffed up nicely and looked great on a platter.

Because I didn't want to wait an hour for the dough to chill for an hour in the fridge, I put it in the freezer for about 10 minutes. Just long enough for me to make the filling.

Lacked taste. These are like the ones you buy at the grocery store at the holidays - no flavor.  I do like the idea though & will make the crust out of a cookie crust for bars probably & then make a better brownie for the filling.  I was hoping this would've been better because I wanted something like this & didn't want to have to come up with my own recipe. I used brand name cream cheese & chocolate chips so that wasn't the problem.

I'll give it two stars, because there is a slim chance that I did something wrong.  But I doubt it.  These were gross, no offense.  I really didn't like them.  I had made them to take to DH's work but they turned out so poorly that I threw them all out and he took something store-bought.
