I loved these... can't wait to make them again.  The peanuts I think are what makes this for me... adds much needed texture.  I first started forming 8 patties... they were very small.  I ended up making 6 out of the recipe

I used beans instead of peanuts and microwaved and then fried it instead of using the oven

I doubled this recipe and my entire family loved it! Even the kids! I did decrease the cilantro because I used it from my garden and it had a strong taste. Because I used two pans I did have to increase the cook time by 10 mins at the end and increased the temp by 50 degrees to get them to brown a bit.

they came out a little too dry. Maybe too long in the oven? who knows, maybe I should have fried them instead. Not sure I'll be making them again, even though I'm a huge fan of oatmeal, peanuts and sweet potatoes! haha I think it lacked moisture..
