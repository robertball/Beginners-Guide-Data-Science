Tastes nothing at all like a strudel. Maybe I made it wrong but it was awful.

I think something is missing. It is very dry with the flour soaking up all liquids. Also it tastes nothing like a meringue or apple pie because it falls apart. Try real apple pie.

Hey this one is missing something! It is too dry. I followed the directions exactly and if not changed, it needs to be pulled off the list! Awful!!!!!

Nice low fat pie like dessert! After reading other reviews I stepped up the cinnamon and  sprinkled on about 1/4 c brown sugar before baking. It is a low fat pie though, but it gives me enough to satisfy the apple pie craving.
