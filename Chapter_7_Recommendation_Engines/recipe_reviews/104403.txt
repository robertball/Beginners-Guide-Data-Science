I lived in Tunisia for a couple of years and was thankful to find this recipe!  It brings back so many memories and now some of my attempts to cook Tunisian food will taste more authentic.   I did "cheat" however, and used a blender instead of a mortar and pestle.  I added some water and olive oil to make sure it was the right consistency. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

So different, exceptional. Caraway instead of toasted cumin? Wow. Check the other recipe for Harissa on allrecipes (By norm1, I think). With this I assumed to not toast the caraway (which is an important step with cumin in Harissa), and the final side is so bright, much less musky than with cumin. I implore you to make both. Both are different from what I had been making, yet they each have such individuality. I used this one to complement tabouleh, hummous and pita with yogurt. My opinion, but try it.
