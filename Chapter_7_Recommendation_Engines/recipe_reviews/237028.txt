I made this cake and it was very moist and delicious! This is My second time making this cake. The first time I made it I thought it was good, but too sweet for my taste, so I decided to make it a second time with a few changes.I Added one cup of white sugar instead of the 1 1/2 cup,
added 1/2 cup of brown sugar, one cup of oil and 1/4 cup of unsweetened apple sauce. Before I made the changes I gave it 4 Stars, now I give it 5 Stars! :-)My Family loves it so, I Will be making this cake many more times. Thanks!

Excellent! Thank you. I cut the white sugar by half and added a 1/2 cup of apple sauce to substitute. I also added a few table spoons of ground flax seeds. I like how you recipe has whole wheat and minimal sugar yet EXCELLENT texture, moist and delicious;)

Wow! I made this today and it was very delicious. The batter was very thick and I wasn't sure if it would be good but it was awesome. I omitted the sugar topping and reduce the sugar amount to 1 cup but it was just right. My husband loved it. I also added some cranberries to sweeten the taste. It was light and healthy. We can have it for breakfast too. Great recipe. A keeper.

Very good! One thing that I did differently was cut the sugar by a third across the board. It was still plenty sweet.

This was a very good apple cake recipe.  The only thing I would do next time is I would back of on the white sugar a little.  Super sweet and needed a little more apple flavor.

We found this to be oily and overly sweet.  I made muffins and they did not rise well subsequently over browning around the edges.  Needs tweaking so it goes on the probably wont make again list.
