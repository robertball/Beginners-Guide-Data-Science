Yum! The knoephla were a hit. I served everything separate and let guests mix however they wanted. I'm glad I cut the recipe in half, this makes a lot! Easy to make too. Thanks for a good one!

I made this a while ago and was disappointed.  The "kneophla" (the correct spelling is Knoepfle, which means "little buttons") were very dense and chewy.  If you want a really tasty German pasta, try one of the Spaetzle recipes from this site.  Knoepfle is actually another name for Spaetzle, but this recipe doesn't bear much resemblance to Spaetzle.

Absolutely DEEEElicious.  Very German flavor.  I decided not to drain the saurkraut in order to maintain moisture.  The family loved it!!  It was an easy clean up too.  Goes good with Bierocks.

Me and bf really enjoyed this.  It might be a tad bland but I sliced and fried some polish sausage and added that and it came out really wonderfully tasting with the sauerkraut and the kneoph- whatever, were a really nice addition.  Thanks!

I really like this recipe. It takes a bit of time to make but it is very tasty and has vary-ing textures.Also, the recipe for 6 makes a LOT of food! My 6 year old daughter gobbles it down,and I don't think she even likes saurkraut!This has become a family fave.

This dish was something totally new to my husband and I.  I halved the recipe, but used all the ingredients listed and made as written.  This was made as a main dish and the first thing my DH said was "Where's the meat?"  He didn't disappoint me, as I knew that would be his first response.  I did mix the potatoes and knoephia together, but chose to add the sauerkraut on top because I could tell there would be leftovers for lunches and I didn't want the kraut to make the other ingredients soggy.  This dish needs to be paired with something colorful as it is basically the same colors.  We had a spinach salad with 'Maple-Balsamic Vinaigrette' dressing from AR.  The taste is good, but not sure I would try it again.

Made this last night and it got rave reviews.  A few things I will change next time though - Make the kneophla smaller, closer to the size of the potato chunks.  Also, add more sauerkraut!  This looks like it would be a bland recipe but we found out that it required NO spicing up whatsoever!  I added salt to the kneophla water and that was it.  Wonderful!

I made this last night and really wanted to like it, but it was very bland and dry. First of all, you should fry the fry the potatoes first if you do make this. And maybe don't drain the sauerkraut.

My family always adds cooked and chopped bacon or ham to the final product. Bavarian sauerkraut is my personal favorite! Great recipe!

This was good, but I thought there was way too much knoephla for the dish.  Next time i will cut the dumpling recipe in half, use the same amount of potatoes & sauerkraut (I did not drain the juice), and add smoked sausage.

This recipe was good just the way it is. Wanted to add my Nana (50ish yrs. ago) made these when we were children, called them "potato dumplings". We covered them in poppyseed, butter,sugar & cinnamon.

I made just the dumplings out of this recipe. I dropped them by teaspoons into the boiling water. Dip the spoon in between scooping the dumplings and the dough won't stick all over the spoon. I use two regular kitchen spoons and scoop, scrape, and dip... It works great. They were just like my Grandma used to make. So very good, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside!

I’m so happy I found this! I make a variation of this dish, without potatoes and instead of using butter, I fry up pork and use the drippings/grease from the pork.

Knoephla in this recipe came out perfect! I made the dough and boiled them as the recipe states. I froze half and used them in knoephla soup two weeks later. So, YES you can freeze and use at a later date.

I've been looking for a recipe like this. It tastes a lot like what my german Grandmother, Mom, and aunt used to make. I pretty much made the recipe as written, just halfed it for just my husband and I.  My husband, who is not a sauerkraut lover, even liked it quite a bit! Love it, will be making again soon. Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband and I liked this dish but my kids didn't care for it  We all did like the "kneophla" and I have used them in other dishes.

My husband thought it was okay but I thought it was dry, bland and boring.  I was disappointed.
