This turned out pretty well:  but I made some modifications after reading the reviews.  I melted butter and then mixed in the flour, cornstarch, 1 t of lemon pepper, onion powder and lots of pepper.    I next added the milk, 2 bouillon cubes, some fresh sliced mushrooms and pimentos, and let it thicken.  I made sure to julienne the potatoes, and added broccoli.  The key is to julienne the potatoes so they get done in time.  The broccoli was a little overdone;  maybe I'll cover next time.  That's what's great about this site:  recipe building is a community process, instead of scripture!

Wow, we loved this recipe.  I did not have a problem making the sauce without butter.  I think that this sauce is very versatile, and could be modified for use with any pasta dish as well.  Next time though, I will ease up on the chicken boullion to cut down on the "saltyness" of it.  ps: make sure you julienne your spuds small if you want it to cook in an hour.. mine took almost two - well worth the wait though.

My family absolutely loves this recipe. I just cut up enough potatos to fill my casserole dish, dice up a ham steak toss it over the potatoes and pour the sauce over it. It turns out great every time. I serve it along with a Ceaser salad. It makes for a great inexpensive meal.  It's wonderfully quick to make too if you don't have a lot of time!

This was a great use of our leftover ham but I did make a couple of modifications.  I didn't have time to cut the potatoes by hand (it was a last minute thing) so I used the slicing function on my food processor to get nice thin slices.  I then cut them  up a bit more but I don't think that was necessary.  I melted 4 tablespoons of butter and added the flour to that. I didn't have lemon pepper and didn't substitute anything.  I also used garlic instead of onion powder.  I added chopped onions to the sauce before adding the cheese.  I also only used 2 chicken bouillons instead of 3 and I still think it was a little bit salty.  We had much more than 1 cup of ham to use up so I put it all in.  My husband commented that there wasn't very much of it, I would do do an extra half recipe or even double it next time I make it because we like to have leftovers for lunch.  Definitely a keeper!

I didn't get the "toast the flour" portion of this recipe. I can't see how its possible ~ so I first melted 4 TBLS butter before adding the flour and (only half the) cornstarch.  I also used skim milk, only 1 tsp of lemon pepper and 2 chix bullion cubes. Finally, I added 1/2c chopped brocoli and a jar of diced pimentos for color and taste.  Not too salty or pasty. In fact, it was pretty good! Very homey (meaning non-gourmet) dinner.  If the potatoes are cubed to the right size (small) they should cook in the time allotted. Thanks Fran.

I liked this OK, but nothing extra special.  This is what I call a mac n cheese kind of meal, i.e. just a casual mid-week family type meal, what one reviewer called "homey."  (Someone else said it was like glorified potatoes au gratin - good description really.)  I followed the recipe exactly.  As to the undecided-if-its-a-white-sauce: I had absolutely no trouble with it.  I really didn't "get" the toasting the flour thing, but sorta did it anyway.  Didn't have any trouble adding the milk to just the dry stuff with no butter, and with no lumps.   (You must take that word "gradually" quite literally and add just tiny bits of milk at a time, make sure it's mixed well, etc.  You have to do this even with butter.  When it's more liquidy you can dump in the rest.)(For the self-proclaimed "expert" to be unable to do this strikes me as amusing.)  I have a cool little slicer thing that does julienne, as well as thin slices, and it's easier and faster than a food processor, and easier to clean.  I don't recall if mine was done in an hour, but I'm sure I would've made note had it been ridiculously longer than that.  And I didn't find it salty, but I'm a salt-a-holic so I guess I didn't notice.

I just made this after reading the previous reviews.  I reduced the bouillon cubes from 3 to 2 (to combat reported saltiness), made sure to julienne my potatoes (so it would cook in 1 hour), and used skim milk in the sauce (so it wouldn't be too thick). I'm glad I read the reviews first because these adjustments made the recipe come out perfectly.  While my husband and I enjoyed it, my 3-year-old twins were not big fans.  I suspect it may have been a bit too "spicey" for them.  They picked out the ham to eat but avoided the saucey potatoes.  If I make it again, I might try reducing or leaving out the lemon pepper.

Darn good and flavorful recipe, but it was a bit salty for me (and I like salty).  When I made the sauce, it came out a bit too thick and I had to add more milk and even some water to thin it out a bit so that it covered the potatoes and ham better.  

I am not sure if it was the ham or the chicken bullion that I used that added the extra saltiness.  I will DEFINITELY be making it again though!!!!

This really came out good with a few changes.  I really didn't get the dry toasting of the flour, so cooked a finely chopped onion in 1T butter until softened, then added a minced clove of garlic and the flour and cooked until the flour was a light gold, then added the rest of the seasonings and milk.  Pureed the sauce in the food processor (presto! no lumps!) with one bouillon cube (there was no way in the world I was going to use 3), then returned to the pan to cook until thickened.  Melted in colby/jack cheese and poured over the layered ham (about 2 cups) and julienned potatos.  Baked up with crispy edges and tasted wonderful.  Only slight negative I can say is the potatos turned a little gray since there wasn't enough sauce to fully cover, which didn't affect the flavor, but doesn't look as pretty.  Next time I would double the sauce to make the cassarole a little 'juicier'.

YUM this was so good!!  I intended to follow the recipe very closely but I accidentally added 1tsp oregano (had it out to refill my container) and I also added a bag of frozen broccoli.  That's the only changes I made.  The potatoes did take much longer to cook for me even though I sliced them very thin before cutting them julienne and I covered the pan with foil but I still had to leave this in the oven for 30 more minutes. Even though I'm not a fan of velveeta I had some to use up, and with that I also used 1c shredded sharp cheddar. That along with the seasoning was just so tasty - we'll have this again!

Very easy to make.  I had to feed 6 kids with this (and they're all picky), and they actually ate it.  I did not include the lemon pepper because I don't like it.  It was creamy, tasty, and a great use of leftovers.

This wasn't bad- I thought it lacked flavor, I would add sauteed onion and garlic to it next time.  I shredded my potatoes with a Salad Shooter because I was too lazy to julienne them.  My kids liked it, so that's a plus.

I followed this recipe very loosely but we loved it. I used 4 T. butter, melted and made a roux with the flour. Poured in 1 3/4 C. milk and let thicken. Mixed the other 1/4 C. milk (COLD) with the cornstarch and poured into the heated milk mixture to hold the roux better. I also added 1 T. dry mustard powder, subbed 1 T. chicken broth powder for the boullin (way less salty!) and added about 1 tsp. white pepper. I filled my 9x13 dish with finely sliced potatoes and onions. Then diced up 2 ham steaks.  I melted in about 1.5 C. shredded sharp cheddar and then poured the cheese sauce over the ham/potatoes/onions. Baked at 350 for 1 hour. YUM!

This was ok, I would rate it 4 stars if it wasn't so salty.  I would have to modify this recipe some if I decided to make it again.

I made this with no butter and it turned out great.  i am giving this a 4 because of my own problems- I overcooked the potatoes. However, I added corn and carrots. i also used lemon rosemary blend spice because I know my kids do not like pepper.  the sauce is fantastic.

The lemon pepper is overpowering and the cheese sauce isn't particularly tasty. The potatoes were undercooked in only an hour of baking. Definitely not a hit in this household.

This is a delicious recipe.  I needed to cover it with foil while baking to avoid burning on the top, but that may be my old, inacurate oven.  Also great to add cooked broccoli to potatoes and ham if you like that sort of thing.

This was fabulous!  I used a sodium free powdered bullion and it was not salty - in fact, I added salt at the table.  My mixture was lumpy and thick but, I had no time to worry about it so I just poured it over the potatoes and ham and it was wonderful.  Not dry, not runny, not salty, tender potatoes. 

My new staple favorite!

Having read the reviews about saltiness, I reduced bullions to 2. However, as I always seem to missing some ingredient these were my subs: 2 t pepper (instead of lemon pepper), and 1 t garlic salt (instead of onion powder). Though it was garlic salt, it didn't add to the saltiness, the 2 t pepper however, certainly does add ..."spice" and makes it taste more like pepper than a cheese sauce. This recipe turned out to me more like a glorified potatoes au gratin, but with like a hashbrown feel that you could take to a brunch.

I was in a big hurry to find a recipe for my leftover ham, I should have read the reviews.  I too questioned why no butter and couldn't believe how salty it turned out, I even tried adding sugar to cut down on the taste.  It was bland, the potatoes were not done in an hour.  Overall, it's NOT a keeper in my file box.

I made this delicious concoction over the Christmas holidays, and everybody (me included) loved it!  Absolutely no complaints about anything.  A totally enjoyable way to turn left over ham into a truly tasteful dinner.  Highly recommended.

It was very good and easy to make. I modified flavor a bit. I used garlic instead of lemon pepper. And I used butter to get sauce going. Pretty easy recipe with delicious results. Will definitely save this one.

This was excellent! Everyone in my family liked it! I added some leftover corn to the mix- yummy! It did take a long time to cook though, I did a double size and it took almost 2 hrs.

The only thing missing was some kind of oil or butter to make the cream sauce with.

I think it doesn't need the lemon pepper. Next time I'll put it in a smaller pan so I can put another layer on. It was only about an inch thick. When I first made the sauce, I thought it would never thicken then after I put in the cheese it thickened up too much so it kinda sat on top of the potatoes. I only cooked it for 45 minutes and the edges of the sauce started to burn. It was edible and not bad.

I just made this for lunch for my family and they loved it.  I didn't have any issues with toasting the flour, using an electric range and using 4-qt saute pan.  I did halve the recipe though and used one chicken bouillon cube.  Also added some organic carrots too.  Yummy and will make again.

This was really pretty good. I used Velveeta and it was just a bit gluey, but we all liked it and will definitely have it again (but probably with the cheddar). The julienne potatoes were a nice touch and cooked in 1 hr just fine.

That recipe is really delicious!  I decided, however that I wanted a bit more color and zip so added a chopped bell pepper - any color but green is cheaper, of course.  I also use a medium onion sliced in small wedges rather than the onion powder and combine with the chopped pepper to create another layer.  I cut the cheese sauce ingredients in half and add about a teaspoon of crushed red pepper to overcome the salty taste and provide a bit of zing.

Used it on Easter for brunch. It got raves, which is hard to do with my family- picky kids and in-laws that are great cooks.

Neither my husband nor I could finish our servings of this recipe.  It was pasty and had no taste.
