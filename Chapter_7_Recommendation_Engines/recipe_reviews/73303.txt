Authentic or not, this is a fabulous recipe...I leave out the bell pepper though simply because I don't like it. Also, brown the rice along with the onion and garlic for best flavor, and squeeze in the juice of 1/2 fresh lime just before covering.  THE SECRET TO GETTING THE RICE TO "FLUFF UP" is 1) use long grain white rice, 2) make sure whatever liquid you use is HOT when you add it, 3) ALWAYS use twice as much liquid as rice (1 cup rice, 2 cups chicken broth or water) and 4) once you cover your pot and turn your burner to low, DON'T TOUCH the rice, DON'T LIFT the lid, don't stir it, let it do it's thing. After 20 minutes turn burner off but let the pot sit for at least another 5 - 10 minutes before removing the lid. You will have perfect rice, every time.

Very good rice, although in my mind not entirely authentic.  My husband IS an authentic Mexican, and his mother's rice is nothing like this.  It may just be a regional thing, though - I saw a few comments that this rice is similar to that served in Arizona restaurants, whereas my in-laws are in Texas and most of the rice served in those Mexican restaurants are very similar to my mother-in-law's.  Although here in the northeast I find most Mexican restaurant rice similar to what I'm used to, also.  But, anyway....

Next time I will: omit the green pepper as their taste tends to bully the other flavors, up the cumin to 3/4 tsp, and stir in the cilantro after the rice is cooked to keep it's fresh, earthy flavor intact.

I really love this recipe but agree with a previous reviewer that, while it is pretty authentic Mexican restaurant fare, it isn't anything like the rice I've had made by people from Mexico.  Living in the Phoenix area for 15+ years, I've had lots of variations on the theme.  Still, it is an excellent recipe, and my husband prefers it to any that we've had in restaurants.  I found that it is even tastier if I saute the rice for a few minutes, then add the veggies (garlic finely minced)to the pan and let them cook down just a bit.  That way, the flavors "mingle" better, and it sweetens up the garlic and onion.  A brief saute also distributes the taste of the jalapeno and dissipates the heat.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is an excellent recipe.  The traditional Mexican rice that my Mother-in-law makes takes a lot longer to prepare. The prep time for this recipe is almost nothing, and I don't think my Husband could tell the difference.Make sure the rice gets toasted long enough, every grain should be browned. I cook the onions with the rice, then add some garlic and the peppers, then petite diced canned tomatoes.  Simmer one minute, then add the broth and seasonings.

I know the recipe calls for white long grain rice, but I tried using brown rice instead to make it healthier.  It didn't come out very good.  My husband liked it, but I didn't.  Just in case someone else has this not-so-bright-idea, I wouldn't recommend using brown rice for this recipe.  Not only does it take longer to cook, which I knew beforehand - it doesn't taste as good as white rice and doesn't pick-up the flavor as well.  Next time I try this - I'm using white rice.

Great flavor!  Plates nicely too!  I do have some advise for another reviewer, SISTAJAI.  I had the same problem with rice for a long time.  Finally I corrected it.  One reason could be brand - get a name brand long grain rice, not the store brand kind (it makes a HUGE difference in texture) also, when you reduce the heat and cover, DO NOT PEAK!  Don't stir it, don't touch it until the 20+ minutes is up, then check it.  If there's still a lot of liquid, keep the lid off and cook until it's evaporated.  I hope this helps : )

Just the right side dish served with Chicken Kabobs Mexicana and Best Black Beans.  Whether it's authentic Mexican or not, whether it should or shouldn't include bell peppers, I don't care. This was delicious, plain and simple, as written, with just a dab of butter thrown in at the end for added richness. Pefect, fresh, and unique blend of flavors. Hmmm, who knows what's "authentic" anyway? Is cooking ANY dish of any ethnicity ever precise and exact? Thanks for sharing your recipe, which we thoroughly enjoyed and will make again.

Fabulous!  I used all the ingredients and measurements as written, however,I added the chopped onion to the rice and oil (I used olive oil) in step one and when the rice was opaque I also added to garlic. (do not add the garlic with the rice and onion... it will burn and be bitter). I then stirred the cumin into the rice before adding the broth. Brought it to a boil, added everything else and returned it to a boil...and this means a full, rolling boil, not just a few bubbles! If you don't have a really tight fitting lid, cover the kettle with foil and then place the lid on top.. folding the excess foil up a over the top. This will help create a better seal and keep more steam in to cook the rice.  Also, as another person mentioned...DON'T PEEK! After 20 minutes on low, remove from the heat and let sit another 5 minutes...and DON'T PEEK!

Thanks for the wonderful recipe...it will be a staple in my house!

Here's a suggestion:  Make sure you bring all your ingredients together before you start cooking the rice...Have everything cut up and ready to go so that you aren't opening the rice constantly...That makes it sticky and clumped together.  Otherwise, great taste and I will definitely make this again....

This is a great recipe, but for the best use of cilantro, you should add it during the last 5 minutes or simply stir it in before serving.  The fresh flavor is easily cooked out.

I made a few changes:  I sauteed the cumin, garlic, jalapeno, onion and green pepper along with the rice in the oil before adding the liquid.  I used chicken stock instead of broth.   I also doubled the cumin.  I added the tomatoes and cilantro last, just before taking the rice off the heat and serving.  The recipe turned out great with these changes, very flavorful, very pretty.

My family loves this rice. I've always "precooked" my rice in shortening (usually butter) before adding the liquid, but what I do when making this recipe is saute the onions, garlic, peppers, tomatoes, etc. in a tablespoon or 2 of olive oil (the only kind I use any more) for a couple of minutes and THEN add the rice (I use Jasmine; again, the only kind I use any more) and "precook" that along with veggies (plus a bit more oil) for a couple of minutes more. I use 3 boullion cubes (2 chicken and 1 vegetable) because I can't afford the price of either canned or packaged "stock" and I don't have the freezer capacity to make my own. And I omit adding any additional salt. The seasonings (cilantro and cumin) are "just right" as posted and I like that I use all (olive) oil and no butter. I generally use this recipe as a "side" but I've also been known to add pieces of chicken, pork or beef (plus some cheese and a bit more liquid; sometimes even some peas, carrots and/or corn) to the rice as it is cooking to produce a DELICIOUS one pot main meal. As much as I love (and use) this recipe, I rated it a 4 on account of its suggestion that you don't first saute the vegetables before adding them to the "liquidated" rice. IMO, this makes a TREMENDOUS difference to the final presentation.

I’m an “authentic” Tex-Mexican from south Texas and in my opinion this recipe is 100% authentic. I alter my recipe a bit depending on my audience’s taste preferences. For example, I might use 1/4c bell pepper or 2 tomatoes, or ½ c tomato sauce if I don’t have fresh tomatoes, or even ½ tsp garlic salt if I don’t have fresh garlic.  Sometimes, I even omit the jalapenos or chicken bouillon. I recommend following the exact recipe and then altering to your taste preferences or dietary needs/restrictions.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe. I live in Tucson Arizona so I'm accustomed to great Mexican food. I felt that this recipe came out way to soggy and salty for my taste and it doesn't nearly measure up to my favorite local Mexican restaurant's version. It also didn't have any tomato taste to it which I like in my Mexican rice. I'll have to keep looking for a better recipe.

This turned out so well that my granddaughter thought I had gotten it from our local Mexican restaurant. Instead of using the chopped peppers and tomato, I used a can of drained diced Ro-Tel tomatoes and it was delicious. Thanks Alanasmom, this will be our recipe for Mexican rice from now on.

This is AMAZING rice! We had it with fajitas and guacamole! Since corn is in season, and extremely cheap in the grocery stores, I cut off the kernals of 2 cobs and added them in with the other veggies. YUMMY!!!

I have made Mexican rice before, but had never found the perfect recipe until now! I tried this one for the first time this evening, and it was perfect! Absolutely delicious! I did do a tiny bit of tweaking for convenience sake and to use what I had on hand, but I basically followed the recipe. I doubled the recipe because we had some company over. In the interest of time, I used two 14 oz cans of diced tomatoes (juice drained off so I didn't have too much liquid) instead of seeding and chopping a couple of fresh ones.  As per another reviewer's tip on the ratio of liquid to rice, I used four cups of broth to two cups of rice.  I'd used half an onion for another side, so instead of using a whole onion for a double batch, I just used the other half of the onion I'd already chopped. I think it would have been fantastic with the full amount of onion too though. I also cut out the jalapeno, because my husband can't take much heat, and used olive oil rather than vegetable oil. But other than that, I prepared the recipe as written. This has gone into my recipe box, and will be my go-to recipe for Mexican rice from now on!

I really like the flavor of this rice, but it was rather spicy (even after I had seeded most of the jalapeno in it). I doubled the recipe, and added a teaspoon of chicken base to it (because I had no bouillon cubes), but also added too much cumin toward the end of cooking it. My two-year-old spit it out, and said "spicy" for the first time in her life. I think next time, I will fully seed the jalapenos and stick to the measurement of cumin shown in the recipe (or less). If it was not so much work, it probably would not taste so good that I went back for seconds.

Edit: After many times making this, I now use minced garlic, sometimes don’t deseed the tomatoes to save time, and always wait to add the green pepper toward the end of cooking (as I don’t like them all mushy). I also cut down on the jalapeño fairly consistently.  This is a wonderful recipe, you can totally just tweak to your tastes!

Update: I truly cheated at it just now, for example: using precut onions, using drained diced jalapeños, using low sodium mini diced tomatoes I drained fully (which has seeds in it), reserving the fresh cilantro for after it was cooked (since my husband hates cilantro, but I added a little of dried cilantro), and adding juices of two fresh limes at the end (since my Mom likes that).  I still only cook the green pepper in it the last few minutes, and I always use that powdered chicken versus the cubes to up the chicken taste of it.  One more thing I added was two shakes of Cholula Hot Sa

Great recipe! I halved it, simmered on low 15 min, let rest 8 min and it was perfect. I would have liked more cumin, just a personal preference. Did not have jalapeno so used cayenne pepper. Added a little butter, some lime juice and chopped scallions before serving with traditional Mexican carnitas. Had to use frozen cilantro cubes, but I'm sure it would be much better with fresh. Moist, rich and delicious rice. Thanks, ALANASMOM for the recipe! Smacznego (delicious in Polish)!

Phenomenal!! I made this for my wife and I tonight and she was blown away! The richness, texture and taste of this rice is simply amazing with any mexican style dinner. Packs a little punch with some serious class. Bravo. I did add the veggies with the rice to satay down earlier, but other than that it was the original recipe to the T. Thanks a million for the recipe. You crushed it!!

This was really good. I didn't have a fresh tomato so I added half a can of drained diced tomatoes.

I'm married to a very spoiled Latin man. I did not grow up cooking mexican food as I am as white as a girl can get! BUT this recipe is so easy to follow and he even says this is the BEST rice he's ever had!

The rice was a wonderful dish, for me there was just something missing ... sadly I can't put my finger on what it is.  Don't hesitate to use the jalapeno as long as you seed it the heat is minimal

Good stuff! I used brown rice instead of white and canned tomatoes instead of fresh (it's what I had on hand). My family and I enjoyed this. The rice was very flavorful. I will make it again. Thank you!

The birthday girl requested Mexican food for her celebratory lunch, so I went looking for a highly reviewed recipe. Everyone at the table thought this recipe was good. It certainly is colorful. I thought it was OK ... but I wouldn't make it again because I really didn't think it was anything special. I followed the recipe exactly.

I've made this rice several times now, and it's absolutely delicious.  I'm not even a rice lover, especially white rice, but there is so much flavor in this recipe that I end up eating several servings of it in one sitting.  Excellent leftover too!

I thought this was really good. No, it's not super authentic but that doesn't mean it wasn't tasty! It did need two cups of broth instead of 1.5 (as christina b said you need twice as much liquid as rice...) but otherwise I made this as written and the flavors were very nice. Thanks for a quick and easy recipe.

This is a no fail recipe.  I've been making it for years.  I follow the directions to the letter and it turns out perfect every time.  The combination of flavors and seasonings give it a wonderful authentic Mexican taste.  I'm not a huge rice fan, but I can't get enough of this one.

This rice was awesome!  I took the advice of christina b and browned the rice with the onion and garlic.  I had homemade chicken broth (which I did about 2 1/2 cups) and garden tomatoes. Mmmmmmmm. I might add some chili powder and peas next time!

I quadrupled this recipe for a fiesta/anniversary party, and it was the first thing to go!  Everybody loved it and wanted the recipe.  I used seeded roma tomatoes (they were cheaper), and I used about half the amount of cilantro (I usually dislike cilantro, but it was good at this amount), and it turned out delicious.  It was light and fluffy, and not mushy (I didn't peek while the rice was simmering).

This was really good.  I left out the jalapeno and tomato and substituted a can of rotel drained into my chicken broth.  I then added enough water to make it 2 cups of liquid.  Diced up the garlic.  Sauteed the veggies in the oil for a few minutes, added rice and sauteed that for a few minutes.  Added spices  (including 1/4 teaspoon of salt) and garlic and sauteed for a minute then added rest of the ingredients (except cilantro) brought to a boil, covered and simmered for 20 minutes.  Stirred in cilantro and a tablespoon of butter, recovered and let it sit for 5 minutes.  Perfect rice consistency.

Very good and easy! I added a bit of red bell pepper for more color and used vegetable bouillon instead of chicken. Yummy!! Way better than Mexican rice seasoning packets.

Easy and delicious! I'm cooking challenged, so the fact that I was able to make this says something. I'm super lazy, so I used a can of rotelle rather than seed a tomato and chop a jalapeno. This was easy, yummy and spicy. I added fresh cilantro at the end and it was wonderful. Next time I'll double the recipe!

I can't tell if it's authentic or not, but it is similar to rice I've had in Mexico. The best thing about this recipe is that you can goof and it still works. See, I only had the one tomato, which I needed for my pork tacos, and only one can of tomato paste, for tomorrow's chili. So....ketchup! I made sure no one saw me add it, and didn't tell them what my secret ingredient was until they told me how delicious it was.  I can't decide whether to hang my head in shame or hold it high, proud of being so innovative. Bottom line, this is very tasty rice! Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe with our without changes.  I made a few.....I used one whole pablano pepper instead of the bell pepper and jalapeno.  I used one can of petite diced tomatoes, drained in place of the fresh tomato.  I used two garlic cloves, chopped fine.  As with other reviewers, I also sauteed my rice, onion and pepper for a few minutes before adding garlic and remaining ingredients, adding cilantro after rice rested.  Will definately fix this for my family again.  They loved it!

Absolsutely declicious! Perfect. Followed the recipe with the exception of the fresh tomato. I had 3 heirlooms but am holding on to those for another recipe so I opened a can of diced tomatoes, drained and used about 1/2 the can. Worked out great! Hubby and kids said one of the best rice dishes yet. Thanks for sharing!

This "Mexican Rice III," recipe is very good on its own. I only omitted the jalapeno pepper because my family cannot handle the spiciness or heat. In a skillet I sauteed the long grain rice in oil with chopped white onions and then added the chopped garlic. I seasoned with salt, black pepper and cumin. I added some sweet orange, red, and green bell peppers, stirred, then turned off the heat. Lastly, I chopped up some fresh roma tomatoes, then added it to the skillet. I mixed up everything and added it to the rice cooker. I then added the 1 1/2 cup of chicken stock (no bouillon) and let it cook. Once it was done I let the rice sit for a few minutes to let it steam thoroughly and set. I lifted up the rice cooker lid and  threw in some chopped fresh cilantro onto the rice to retain its color, add freshness and taste. The rice was very pretty with all its vibrant colors from the tomatoes, bell peppers and sprinkles of bright green fresh cilantro. The rice was cooked perfectly, fluffy, and inviting. I found this rice very fresh, lightly seasoned and flavorful. I served this with, "Chicken Kabobs Mexicana, " and "Best Black beans,' also from this website. Thank you for sharing your recipe ALANASMOM.

5 stars from me for the flavor! I like to rinse my rice, rinse it some more, then rinse it some more, then fry up the rice, add the chopped onion & garlic just before the rice browns, then saute it all until the rice is golden but not to let the garlic brown. I leave out the bell pepper just cause that's our preference but it's still good with, & usually use hot chicken broth but this is one of those times we actually like the bouillon, too...I love the tasty, fluffy rice you get at (American) Mexican restaurants & this is a close match for me!

I made this to go with some pork enchiladas. I put some fresh parsley in the rice while cooking and added the cilantro after it was cooked. I might try cooking the rice in butter instead of oil next time to brown and flavor it a bit more. I used some of the pork juices along with the chicken broth.
Update: I made this again and did stir fry the rice in the onions and garlic with the butter. Really does give additional flavor. I also used the broth from cooking chicken, with all the Mexican spices. No need to seed the tomato and add the cilantro after it is cooked for full flavor.

This was really good. My family loved it. I did have to increase the liquid (during cooking), and increase the cook time to adjust for high altitude.

Excellent side dish.  Per other reviewers I didn't put the cilantro in until ready to serve.  Didn't add green pepper because I didn't have any on hand still turned out great.  Didn't use chicken bouillon because I felt the chicken broth (1 can) had enough flavor.  I will def. rotate this dish!!!! Love the fresh jalapeno pepper in it!

HOLY WOW this is good rice!  I wish that I could give more stars.  I have found a recipe so good I will never look elsewhere for a Mexican/Spanish rice dish. The fresh ingredients are so tasty in this. My only suggestion to anyone who would like to make this is to do all your chopping/slicing/dicing before you actually start the sautéing of the rice; otherwise you may burn your rice. We have made this twice in the past week because it is just that good! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Love this rice! I make it often and sometimes alternate what I use depending on what I have in my fridge/pantry. Great taste and honestly... i eat it alone as a snack or as a main dish. It's always satisfying!!

This recipe was a great discovery for me, having never cooked rice in this way before.   We don't have chicken broth in the UK (not that I know of anyway!) so I just used twice as much chicken stock as rice and left out the additional bouillon cube.  I did add salt but shouldn't have as it didn't need it.  The rice turned out beautiful and was a huge hit with my 18 month old daughter who we have discovered has a passion for food with loads of flavour.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I've made this dish at least 10 times, and it turns out great each time.   The only change I've made is to add a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with green chili's instead of the jalapeno and fresh tomato, that way it's not too hot, and has a little more color.  I always get compliments on how fresh it tastes, and how much better it is than any of the box mixes you can buy.

Excellent! I will never use a boxed rice kit again on taco night. My five year old loved it and she rarely eats rice. I sauteed the onion with the rice and chopped up the garlic. I didn't have Bell pepper so I omited it. I used a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos instead of fresh. And I added the cilantro at the end because I don't like to overcook fresh herbs. Great the next morning in a breakfast burrito!

when making mexican rice you have to brown the rice well. then add your cumin,garlic,onion and tomato.  Sometimes I use canned rotel tomatoes in it.  Just be careful not to burn the garlic and rice when browning it thoroughly. You have to add enough broth in the rice that way it is not too dry or to wet. 2 cups of rice - 3 cups of broth

I used almost all of the ingredients with little alteration.  I skipped the bell pepper and used a fresh jalapeno.  It was really good, I was looking for a change from the usual spanish rice and this hit the spot.  I did change the cooking method though, I sauteed the rice in a pan and then poured it into my rice maker along with the rest of the ingredients.  It was a bit soft in consistancy when it was done, but that was because I let it sit for about an hour after in the rice make.  We had company over and everyone raved.  I can't make rice on the stove top to save my life, but if you can this recipe is so easy and so delicious.  If you're like me and rely on a rice cooker, this recipe is a snap.

Super rice recipe.  I like to add a small can of v-8 juice (5.5oz) without reducing the broth.  It adds a little color and nutrition.

I should first saute the onion, green pepper, jalapeno, diced tomato and garlic, then add the rice for a few minutes then add the chicken broth, bouillon cube, salt and pepper and cumin.  Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low. Cook for 20 minutes or liquid is absorbed.

Fantastic!  I browned the onion along with the rice and upped the cumin by 1/4 tsp.  Will probably use a can of diced tomatoes (drained) when tomatoes are out of season.  Served with spicy fish tacos and black beans for a great Mexican dinner at home.  Also great with the Slow Cooker Carnitas and refried beans.  Thanks, AlanasMom!

Really tasty! I made mine into a full one-pot supper by adding a couple pieces of pre-cooked chicken breast and some black beans when it was done cooking.  I didn't have any fresh cilantro or jalapeno peppers, so I improvised with basil and parsley (I know it's not the same...) and a few chopped, pickled jalapeno rings.  Still turned out great.

The only deviation from the recipe was I omitted the green pepper. It was excellent. I paired this with Enchiladas Suizas also found on this site and well worth trying.

I left out the bell pepper (we aren't fans of bell peppers) and the jalapeno peppers (5 kids who don't like hot food). My 8 year old daughter loved this which is really saying something since she NEVER eats rice. For a Mexican dish, it tasted better than anything I've had in a restaurant. I just don't really care for Mexican food.

This recipe is fantastic...did not change a thing.  Everyone I've made it for loves it and never is even one grain of rice left.  I personally like this recipe because it does not have a heavy tomato flavor.  You can taste the veggies and seasonings just perfectly and the mild heat from the jalapeno is perfect.  I make this to go along with all the Mexican meals I make....and there are a lot of them.

I should have made sure I had cumin, but I didn't! And my stock was frozen! So I used water and turmeric, believe it or not, and the rice had a beautiful color and delicious flavor. I sauteed the veggies for a few minutes after browning the rice, then added the liquid. It was good with my substitutions so I imagine it will be really great as written.

I normally have an aversion to Mexican rice, preferring Spanish rice. I gave this rice a try because I wanted to serve an authentically Mexican dinner one night. Everyone liked it, including me. I have to admit, though, I still prefer Spanish rice; but that's just me!

This is the best Mexican rice I have ever had.  I replace the bell pepper with canned green chilies.  This is restaurant quality rice, but I've never had any this good in a restaurant!  Salt sparingly.

Ok, I just successfully made the recipe with brown rice - I'm standing in my kitchen and taste tested it and it's great, not even that different from white.

I used 1 cup brown rice instead of white, and toasted it in the sauce pan with olive oil and the onion for closer to 5 or 6 minutes. I just kept an eye on it and let it get as toasted as possible without actually burning. Then I added 1 and 2/3 cups chicken stock, brought to a boil, covered it and reduced the heat to as low as possible. I let it cook undisturbed for about 40 minutes before checking it, then let it cook about 10 more minutes.

Best mexican rice recipe I've tried! The only change I made was using canned tomatoes because I didn't have any fresh ones. Served with chicken enchiladas. Have a couple leftover enchiladas but the rice is gone! I'll be making this again very soon. Thanks!1

We loved this rice.   It had a great flavor and was very easy and I think this may have been the first time my rice didn't stick together! :)  Served with Chef John's Shortcut Green Enchiladas - also easy and delicious - with some homemade guacamole.   After trying several rice recipes, I'll keep this one as my go-to mexican rice.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe. I made the mistake of thinking broth alone would pack enough flavor, next time I will absolutely add the flavor cube. Thanks for sharing.

My family rated a solid 4 stars.  Way too spicy/hot for us though!  Next time will use only 1/2 of a jalepeno.  Served with Lime Chicken Soft Tacos and Strawberry Avocado Salad from Allrecipes.com!

This recipe is fantastic just the way it is.  Quick and easy.  The only change I made was to skip the cilantro because I don't like the taste.  Garnished with a bit of lime.  Perfect! Thanks for sharing.

I made this rice to go along with some crab & shrimp enchiladas and it was quite yummy. The only problem I had was that my grocery store accidentally stocked Italian parsley in the Cilantro section so I had to leave out the cilantro. Though the recipe was great without it, it definitely would have made it that much better. Again, I followed this recipe exactly as written except I only used half a chicken bouillon cube. Will make again for a Mexican night!

I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I didn't have fresh tomatoes or jalapenos so substituted canned petite diced tomatoes with green chiles.  Also, doubled the garlic.  Very tasty.  This one's a keeper.  Thanks!

Loved this.  I've tried mexican rices before, but they never turned out quite like I wanted them to.  This one was the exception.  I substituted red bell pepper for the green, and left out the jalapeno because I didn't have any on hand.  Sauteed the onion and pepper with the rice, then added the garlic just before adding the stock (used 2 cups stock to 1 cup rice).  Turned out perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good.  It was definitely the most sucessful homemade rice dish (as opposed to Rice a Roni) I'm made so far.  I had to do a lot of substitutions though, based on what I had on hand, which is why I'm not giving this a 5 star.  I had no onion, so I threw in 3 chopped scallions.  I had no bell peppers (I want them in there next time!), so I subbed celery, which gave it some extra flavor.  I also didn't have quite enough rice, so I added in about a 1/4 c of quinoa and half a can of kidney beans (left over from a different dish).  I really loved adding the beans in, and think it would be good with black beans too.  I like that this recipe can be so versatile.  I really doubt there's much I could have done to this to make it taste bad, which is saying a lot because I usually don't like my rice dishes much!

Great Mexican Rice and it compliments the Black Bean & Corn Quesadillas very nicely.  Son loved this recipe so much he took all the leftovers back to college with him.  Loved the peppers and onions in this.  Alanasmom - this recipe is delicious and thank you for sharing.

YUM!!  Made this a few days ago and forgot to rate!  This is a great side dish for rice.  Definitely saute your onion/peppers etc along with the rice before adding your broth!  I left out the cilantro due to personal preference.  Perfect side dish for many dishes!

This was pretty good.... Although this didn't "rock" me or my husband's boat, we didn't dislike it either. Having said that, I do think I'll continue my search for a stand-by Mexican recipe to serve with Mexican entrees (i.e. enchiladas, tacos, burritos, etc.). I will continue to use this recipe to serve alongside Southwest dishes, however (this seems to be a better match for Southwest entrees such as fajitas). My only regret was not adding extra liquid as top reviewer christina b suggested. As is, the texture of my rice was slightly off (but still edible / good nonetheless). Definitely use 2 cups water for every cup of rice! I also think it's imperative to add fresh lime juice (right before covering as christina advises) and to wait until you are ready to serve to add your cilantro. This will not only give your rice a more appealing appearance, it will also add a fresh punch that you won't get if you steam it with your rice / veggies. Thanks for sharing, ALANSMOM! :-)

I knew I had to try this when I noticed the lack of tomato sauce/paste. My main dislike about most mexican rice recipes I've tried at home is the strong tomato taste, even when I halved the amounts. This rice is so good, light and simple. I left out the green pepper, and doubled the cumin, this will be my go-to mexican rice recipe, period.

My entire family loved this recipe!  My hubby doesn't like "traditional" mexican rice because he thinks it's too bland. then I found this! I used another person's tip to use a can of diced tomatoes instead of a fresh one. I made quite a few changes really because my family is a fan of extra spicy, extra flavorful foods. Here's what I did:  browned the onions with the rice then added 1/2 the garlic, a small can of dice green peppers and a larger can of diced tomatoes & simmered those together for a minute or two.  then added the broth and seasonings. In addition to cumin I added: 1/2 tsp. chile powder, 1/4 tsp. paprika and 1/4 tsp. cayenne.  I use my food processor to get the cilantro, jalepeno and other 1/2 of garlic minced really fine (and I don't like the surprise of jalepeno in the eye later)  I highly recommend this recipe!

I loved this. It was easy and simple to make! I used two tablespoons of minced garlic instead of a fresh clove, and canned chopped green chilis instead of jalapenos and tomatos (im not a fan of either). The chili cooked nicely with the rest of the rice and blended all the flavors together. I served this rice alongside the Tequila shrimp with avocado wedges and everyone raved about how great it was.

The rice had the right flavor of mexican rice. I used Minute Rice and it turned out just fine. However mine turned out way too salty so i would leave that out next time. Chicken stock and Chicken bullion tends to have lots of sodium.  good recipe, easy to make

This was really good!  I made this in my rice cooker and used 1 and 1/3 cups white rice so I could use the full can of broth.  I put all the ingredients in the rice cooker together and let the cooker do all the work.  I didn't have a tomato so I used 3 spoonfuls of salsa in it's place.  Also didn't use the cilantro since it was already in my salsa.

I used brown rice, omitted the gr. pepper, and added almost a full tsp of cumin.  I served this at a dinner party, and everyone was very surprised when I told them it was in fact brown rice.  Excellent recipe!

This was a delicious side dish!  I followed previous reviews and added a can of mexi-style petit diced tomatoes, and added red, orange, and green peppers for color.  I omitted the bullion cube, used low sodium broth, and didn't miss a thing. I also added a handful of frozen corn I had left over from another dish.  A definite do-over!

I made this with the Burrito Pie on this site it was a huge success!  Eight Firefighters inhaled a double batch, making sure to let me know they want this on a regular basis.  My only changes were that I didn't use green peppers as I didn't have any on hand and I used two cans of tomatoes with chilis instead.

This is a super recipe and easy to double!  I made the following changes for a double batch based on other reviews: used 1/2 of a jalapeno (seeds & white membranes removed), omitted the tomato, green bell pepper & salt, used 1 1/2 tsp cumin, and added 2 cans (14.5 oz each) diced tomatoes with the juice.  I also ended up browning the rice for 7 minutes because of the double batch. This turned out fantastic and was a cinch using the food processor on the jalapeno, onion, cilantro and diced tomatoes.

Lovely flavor rice!  The jalapeno was too spicy however...not many would eat it.  Maybe because I didn't seed it first?

Delicious and addictive!  Had two problems with it:  1.  Even after 20 min., quite a bit of the rice was still uncooked and 2.  Veggies were mushy; cilantro was tasteless.  Made the following adjustments: added spices and chicken broth to sauteed rice; stirred in veggies after 10 min. of cooking. Next time I'll try adding the cilantro the last couple of minutes for even more flavor.  Made this with Pico de Gallo Chicken.  Combined the leftovers from these two dishes the next day - wunderbar!  Enjoy!

This is an easy recipe and has an excellent flavor.  My husband said it was the best rice I ever made, but as a
couple of others mentioned, it is rather
mushy.  I prefer a firmer textured rice, but that is a personal preference. Overall, quite good, and I will make again.

Made this for a dinner party and was well liked.  It is a rather soft-soggyish rice dish, if you dont like that kind of rice, you wont like this.  IT's got lots of flavour and very tasty.  Will make again

This was so flavorful and delicious. The only change I made was leaving out the bouillon cube as suggested by others. It really didn't need it.

This was really good!  Pretty mitch followed the recipe as written,  with one minor adjustment.  As others suggested,  I sautéed my onions with the rice in the beginning.   After that,  no changes!  Added all the ingredients,  reduced to a simmer,  and didn't peek.   Very good!  Husband said better than the restaurant!  It's a keeper!

I've tried this recipe several times and I think I've figured out how it works best with the ingredients I usually have on hand. 

Since we usually use whole cumin (i.e. the seeds), I usually toss those in the hot oil first with the garlic so that the oil has some flavour when the rice goes in. I also found that adding the onions and bell peppers after I've toasted the rice in the oil helps add more flavour. I usually put in black pepper and some paprika instead of jalapenos (not a common pepper in my traditional cuisine). I add the tomatoes in at the very end when I have added in the water to the rice and brought it to a boil. 

If I find that after 20-25 minutes the water isn't completely gone, I usually turn the heat up a little higher (if there is a little bit left) OR take the lid off and use a chopstick to make little holes in the rice to let the steam escape (a trick learnt from my mother).

Very good recipe. I was hesitant but the flavors and cooking all together made a very tasty dish. Make sure you cook that rice first, it really adds another layer of flavor.

Delicious. Made it as a side dish for Cinco de Mayo. I only changed one thing and that was to subsitute red pepper for the green as my company didn't like green pepper. Thanks for sharing this

This is great Mexican rice!  I didn’t have a green pepper, but I did have a pretty good size jalapeno.  I made 1/2 the recipe, but used the whole jalapeno and I used some chopped grape tomatoes that needed to be used up.  I didn’t worry about seeding them.  I made this early in the day and just re-heated it in the microwave just before serving.  This paired perfectly with Ronaldo’s Beef Carnitas, also from this sight.  Yum!

I use this recipe often when making mexican dishes.  It always turns out and is forgiving depending on what you have in your kitchen.  I have decreased the onion, used red peppers, yellow peppers, canned jalepenos when necessary, and sometimes even canned tomatoes.  This is my go-to mexican rice recipe!

Even though I'm Latina, I wasn't raised in a home that cooked Mexican or Spanish food.  My husband however, did and said that this rice was worth calling, "Mexican."  I do use a small can of chopped up mexican veggies instead of using the fresh bell peppers, jalapenos, and tomato.

I absolutely DISLIKE spanish rice with all the tomato in it.  I've had mexican rice dishes at restaurants that I really enjoyed.  So, I searched for a recipe that sounded similar.  Well believe me, this one is quite awesome!  It's got an excellent flavor and is quite easy to make.  Try it you'll like it.

Use your Pampered Chef rice cooker, it'll be perfect! Delicious! I doubled the recipe for a full pot. I didn't change a thing as far as ingredients. I heated the chicken broth in the rice cooker.  I chopped all of my veggies in the mini chopper and sauteed in a frying pan. I pan fried the rice in oil until lightly browned. I added the veggies, rice and seasoning to the chicken broth. I cooked covered on high for 5 minutes, then on 50% power for 15 minutes. I let it sit for 10 minutes before opening the lid. It was perfect!  

(For simplicity, replace the "do-it-yourself" veggies with Fresh Salsa- the chopped veggie kind from the produce section. It'll work the same and save a lot of time and mess) 

Thanks for sharing Alanasmom!

My family and I really liked this recipe!  I used some roasted, hot green chiles instead of the jalapeno, and an orange bell pepper instead of green because that's what I had on hand and it was great.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Very good. I used fat free, low sodium chicken broth in place of the chicken broth & bouillon cube. I also waited to add the cilantro until just before serving. I love that fresh kick that cilantro has, but some of that is lost when it's cooked. So yummy. Thanks :)

I just made this recipe and am eating it for lunch in front of the computer. It is good! For those who claim it is not authentic, that is like saying everyone in Mexico cooks identical recipes and that the cooks don't vary according to what they have on hand. Just like you, they make rice to the liking of their families. I spent a lot of time in Mexico and I've eaten rice in tiny villages and in big cities. Trust me, it is not all the same. This is a good recipe, try it.

WOW!!! This was great, thanks to Karen H's review! I followed her advise to a T, and this rice was wonderful! My husband was a little worried at first but he liked it too! I didn't put in the green pepper and forgot the cilantro (my husband doesn't like it but I was going to put a little in mine but forgot! I will remember next time) I will definitely be making this again! My daughters' boyfriend makes great rice but I think this is just as good!

I have made this numerous times - as is and with unexpected substitutions. Sometimes I don't have fresh tomatoes and use stewed tomatoes instead or I saute the chopped veggies first. Each time, it is delicious!

A rare (for me) 5 stars. What really made this outstanding was a few preparation tips from one of the reviewers suggesting a 2 for 1 ratio of chicken broth, heated, before adding to the browned long grain rice. I served it last night to a group of friends ... they asked to take the leftovers home!!! So the keys: LONG grain rice, HEATED chicken broth, allow to stand, off heat, for 10 minutes before serving and a SQUEEZE of lime at serving. ENJOY!!!

love this rice, I used chicken broth and some tomatoe juice I had left over from making tomato suace. I had never fried rice in oil before simmering and this added a nice fluffy texture to the rice, I will cook rice with these instructions from now on, thanks for sharing

Loved the texture and the look of the dish!  Very good directions and easy to do.  I was worried 2 bullion cubes would be too salty, but it was fine.  I'm not really thrilled with the taste of cumin (personal taste), however the cumin wasn't overpowering.  I might try another spice next time, but overall the rice is great and came out as promised! Thanks for a good recipe!

I absolutely loved this rice! I was trying to find the kind that they serve in Mexican restaurants and this isn't quite it but it is delicious none the less. I followed the recipe except that I sauted the onion with the rice to soak up the flavor better. I skipped the jalepeno and the cilantro for personal preference. I also added a little chili powder... absolutley amazing!

Very good , this was my first time making Mexican rice. I had to add a bit more broth than called for, but the flavor is great. I did add a pat of butter after I took it off the heat, per another reviewer, and it added some depth, delicious! It wasn't too spicy at all, and the texture is wonderful. Thanks :)

I followed the directions on the rice package and added 2 cups liquid to 1 cup rice. BAD idea. It turned out mushy. Good flavor though so I may try again and follow the recipe to get better consistency results.

This was okay but a bit on the spicy side. That I can adjust. We really didn't care for the green pepper in this and I would rather have had tomato sauce instead of chunks of tomato. I used a roasted pepper which gave it a nice flavor. It was okay but didn't make our favorites. Thanks though, it was fun trying out a new recipe.

Best rice I ever tasted! I changed the long grain rice to brown rice which gave it a nuttier taste. It's even good cold! This is a keeper!

This recipe is another family favorite.  I serve it with Chicken Chimichangas with Green Sauce and Best Black Beans (recipes from this site).  I used other reviewers suggestions and browned the rice with the chopped onion and minced garlic before adding 2 cups of chicken broth and the other ingredients.  I also left the green pepper out only because my son doesn't like green pepper.  I double the recipe because we like it so well.  Thank you for sharing!

This rice was really good but it was to hot for me. The people who like heat went crazy for it though. I will make this again, but this time without the jalapeno.

This is great -- exactly what I was looking for to complement Mexican meal!  We didn't have a jalepeno, fresh tomato or chix broth on had so I skipped the jalepeno, used a can of diced tomatoes with peppers in it and used more bouillon cubes and water.  With all the subs., it was still great so I'm looking forward to trying it with fresh ingredients next time.  Will definitely make this again!!

I made this for a company dinner and everyone couldn't stop talking about it.  The only thing I did differently was use jasmine brown rice and I omitted the jalapeno because no one wanted spicy food.  My Mother keeps raving about it a week later.  Definately delicious.

We all enjoyed this rice with our burritos. Even though I didn't have enough cilantro, it was good. I didn't put in the jalapenos because my son and husband wouldn't have enjoyed it, so I put it only on my portion.

I added a can of hot rotel instead of the tomatoes and jalepeno.Also added frozen green beans, frozen peas, and 1/2 a cup of melted queso cheese. I def suggest adding the cheese. It made the rice so good and creamy. I will make again with the additions.

I didn't have stock so I used sodium-free granulated chicken bouillon mixed with water. I used some canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh as it was what I had. I let the whole thing sit covered off of heat for 10 minutes after the 20 minutes of cooking to let the rice absorb the flavors and liquids. This was a very tasty and simple recipe.

I have a similar recipe out of an authentic Mexican cookbook which has you covering your rice in boiling water and letting it stand for 30 minutes. Then you drain it in a strainer and let stand for 1 hour to dry. I think this makes the rice fluffier.  The ratio of chicken stock to rice is different too--4 cups of broth to 1 1-2 cups long grain rice.

The only other big difference is I add peas 5 minutes before the end of cooking.  It is very colourful and gets those veggies into us!

My husband loves this rice.  I have tried several spanish rice recipes and he never has given me so much positive feedback as with this Mexican Rice recipe. I followed the advice of one reviewer and added the cilantro last and  sauteed the veggies which did cut down on the spiciness, which was nice since I have small children. This is a keeper!

I have made this recipe a few times now, with equally excellent results.  My only deviation from the recipe was to use orange and yellow bell peppers.  The flavor of this rice is unbelievably fresh, and it complements anything it is served with.  I have served this with carne asada, carne guisada, and greek lamb kebobs, and have received raves each time.  THANK you for posting this recipe!  It is a true keeper.

Loved the recipe.  I doubled the jalapeno and maybe will add some cayenne powder or something next time because we like some extra kick.  Great recipe and heated up well over a couple of days, so it covered off the sides for several meals.  Thanks for sharing!

We are vegetarian so we needed to make some alterations - veggie broth instead of chicken broth, omit chicken boullion, and brown rice instead of white rice. 

I cooked the rice longer since it was brown rice. The recipe came out really tasty.  

Served with other recipes from this site - Spinach enchiladas topped with 10 minute enchilada sauce.  Delicious!

This was just like everyone said about restaurant quality.  Perfect for Cinco de Mayo affordable at home.  The only thing I deleted was the green pepper due to allergies and it was only missing the orange coloring.  Awesome.  This will be a regular to our mexican menu.  I served this with chips and salsa and Chicken fatigas.

This rice was delicious. I am always on the lookout for good mexican rice recipes. No one cooks better than my little mexican grandma....however...this rice was right up there w/ hers! Very flavorful. I added lots of cilantro because I love it in just about anything mexican, lots of pepper, lime juice, and fresh roma tomatoes. It was great.

This is defenitely the best mexican rice recipe I've ever come across.  I've tried to make it on my own and it was always missing something.  The cumin did it.  I also added 1/2 tsp of chili powder.  I did not use the cilantro because I absolutely despise it and I didn't use any garlic because I just forgot.  I no longer need to perfect my mexican rice.  This is the one.  Thanx!!

Delicious!  I did make one substitution to the recipe and it was still very good.  I decided to make this at the last minute to go with the Southwestern Egg Rolls on this site but then realized I did not have a fresh tomato.  So, I drained a can of rotel tomatoes with chili peppers and added these instead.  Since chili peppers were in the tomatoes, I omitted the jalapeno peppers for fear that it would be too spicy hot with both.  It was still delicious.  This is definitely a keeper.

5 Stars!!!! I love this dish.  The only thing I did different was I only used 1 tablespoon of  cilantro and instead of cutting up tomatoes, onions and bell peppers, I just bought a can of diced tomatoes w/onion and green peppers.  I just added the whole can and it came out perfect.  Makes the preparation time a bit quicker.  Thanks for such a good dish.

This was pretty good, however I made quite a few changes. I doubled the rice/chicken broth, but kept the same amount of veggies. Cut the cilantro in half, but added 1/2 of an onion (chopped). I didn't add extra bouillon b/c I pinch of salt was salty enough, bu t I did add half a small can of tomato sauce (my bf's mother always did). I also added the cumin and garlic while the rice was toasting. Thanks for the basic recipe.

I made this last night, only changes I made was probably using less cilantro (how do you measure that anyway) and I used 3/4 of a pickled jalapeno.  It turned out absolutely wonderful.  I'll definately double this next time for left overs.

Hands down - my family's favorite mexican (or any other) rice recipe!! My 11 year old already asked me to make it for his birthday which isn't until July. I've made it several times, and it comes out absolutely scrumptuous every time!!  The only things I do different is I use canned tomatoes with green chili peppers instead of fresh tomatoes and canned, chopped jalapenos instead of fresh - yum!!  Gotta double it though - one batch is never enough!!

First, when you cook rice, whatever the amount of rice you use you need to double the liquid, so 2 cups of liquid with this recipe instead of 1 1/2 cups.  We thought this was OK but didn't like the cilantro in this.  I will try again and change it more to fit our taste by leaving out the jalapeno and tomato, instead add a can of drained Rotel tomatoes.  I used 'Better Than Bouillon' chicken flavored bouillon which taste better than any broth or bouillon I have found, also will add more garlic.

The first time I made this, my family really liked it, but since then I have tried to make it again 3 or 4 times and it has been disappointing.  Maybe too long cooking, or too high heat, or too little liquid, I don't know!  Will look for another recipe :(

This was really good.  I waited until the end to add the cilantro so it wouldn't lose flavor, and before I added it I tasted the rice and wasn't impressed.  However, after adding the cilantro I tasted it again and it was great.  So don't skip the cilantro!  The only change I made was that I didn't have any tomatoes so I added half a cup of tomato sauce and half a cup less chicken broth.  That gave it a good flavor.  I think next time I will add a little more cilantro and maybe some cayenne to spice it up a little bit.

I have made this recipe numerous times and always a little different, depending on what I have on hand.  When I don't have tomatoes, I use a can of drained diced tomatoes.  When I don't have green pepper, I use frozen peas and it is delicious too.  A very versatile recipe.  Thanks for sharing this one.

Snaps for ALANASMOM! This dish was great just the way it was. I didn't have a green pepper or bouillon cube and it was still wonderful. Even my non-rice eating daughter enjoyed it. Goes great with chicken enchiladas I (this site too). I did cook it longer because the rice was still crunchy after 20 min. A keeper!!!

Everyone seemed to like this rice dish, and it was easy enough to make.  I left out the jalapeno for the sake of some and didn't add the chicken bouillon either. I'd make it again to complement a Mexican meal.

I made so many mexican rice recipes, and this, by far is my favorite! I am from Texas and love this flavor. I made baked tacos with stewed tomatoes and used some of the extra tomatoes for this and chopped them up. I didnt use the jalapeno and used dried parsley instead of cilantro, and 1/8 tsp garlic powder since I had no garlic. This was great and I will continue to make over and over!! Thanks for sharing!!

Good recipe but I had to make a few adjustments. After 20 mins some of the rice wasn't cooked all the way so I added some chicken broth and juice from the canned tomatoes. I added some more cumin and jalapenos. Next time I ill use half of the cilantro. To me it was  overpowering the other spices. This recipe went really well with the chicken ranchero I made as well! I will make this again.. Very good!

The PERFECT accompaniment to many Mexican dishes. I will definitely make this over and over. I'm sure it would be fantastic exactly as written, and I will one day make it exactly as written, but I had to make a couple of substitutions with what I had on hand; I used a can of green chilies in place of the jalapeno pepper and since I didn't have a fresh tomato I added about 1/2 cup of "salsa verde" with tasty results. Easy, quick, delicious!

My whole family, including my 19 month old daughter, loved this rice.  I did add a little tomato paste, about 3-4 TBSP, just because we like our rice with a little more tomato flavor.  This really was an excellent and very easy make mexican rice recipe, especially if you have everything cut up first.  I did saute all the vegetables with the rice and oil and then added the chicken broth.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I gave this recipe a 3, because it tasted ok. I was a bit disappointed by it, though. I much prefer the "Salsafied Chicken and Rice" recipe from this site, it's easier and a lot tastier in my opinion.

Very tasty recipe.  I made it exactly as the recipe says.  A bit spicier than I thought it would be, but I'm a wimp when it comes to spice.  Served this rice with the Pollo Fajitas and Adobe Sirloin from this site and everyone loved it.  This one is a keeper!

I was looking for something quick and easy to go with Gerry's Chicken Enchiladas (from this site). This recipe did the trick. I didn't use the jalpeno but know it would've been a nice addition if I'd had one. I stirred in  the cilantro just before serving and squeezed a fresh lime over all at the end. I found it gave it that little extra zing.

WOW...what a fab recipe...up here in Canada we are not big Mexican food eaters.  The only variance that I made to this recipe was as I had no jalapeno peppers, I added dried crushed red peppers and also added some finely chopped yellow and red peppers along with the green ones.  A real keeper !!!!

I was disappointed. No one including myself liked this. Must be a matter of taste considering all the five stars, or maybe it was the fact I cooked it exactly as the recipe said. Sorry

This is one of the best recipes I have found for Mexican rice.  Beware though if the jalapenos are extra spicy, it can get hot.  I would personally add half a tsp. of cumin extra.

I made this as side dish to some chicken enchiladas and found it very tasty.  I made some minor changes based on the reviews.  I also used Ro-Tel tomatoes, omitted the green pepper and added some black beans.  I sauted some of the cumin with the rice before adding the chicken broth for extra flavor.  Next time I will increase the rice by 1/8 or 1/4 cup because my can of chicken broth was 14 oz and increase the cumin.    I did add the cilantro after cooking, I like the fresh taste better.  I will be making this again.

This rice was okay, but I was disappointed.  I guess all the 5 star reviews got my hopes up.  First of all, definitely omit the bouillon cube.  It made the rice way too salty.  We also found this rice to be much hotter than we anticipated.  I know that your preference for heat varies from person to person, but this rice was so spicy that my children couldn't eat it at all.  I removed the seeds, but even my husband, a big fan of spicy foods, found this quite hot.  Who knows, maybe our jalepeno was overly hot!  I will try this again, but using less jalepeno and omitting the bouillon cube.  Maybe that will make the difference.

We love this! I saute the onion and pepper with the rice. As recommended by others, instead of the tomato I use a can of petite diced tomatoes with the juice. It is never dry and has great flavor.

Could have skipped the tomatoes. I left my jalapeno at the grocery store apparently and had to sub chitpolte powder.  Very good recipe.  Will make again.

I made this last night and we all really enjoyed it!  I made it as written and although it was excellent, I might reserve the cilantro and mix it in just before serving, but if I forget it's no biggie, it'll be super yum either way. I used jasmine rice as it was the only white rice we had, and it was great. Has a great spicy kick to it.  If I was served this in a restaurant I would go bananas for it so definitely double the recipe next time.

Made the recipe exactly!  Great flavor and looks great.  The only reference I have is to rice served in a Mexican RESTURANT and I normally ask for a substitution because it is so bland.  This is 100 times better and I am sure my family will love it.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

Great! This isn't the red rice you sometimes see in Tex-mex joints, it's the, uh, non-red rice you sometimes see in restaurants that are more Mex, less Tex. But every restaurant has its own rice, so why waste time arguing about authenticity? It's good, flavorful and mild (I left out the jalapeño; small child) and a great foil to whatever you're serving. Will definitely make this one again, thank you!

I just made this rice to pair with the fish tacos we are having for dinner. All I can say is WOW!!! Followed recipe exactly as it is written, and it turned out AWESOME!!! Its so worth it to make homemade Mexican rice as opposed to buying the flavored rice from grocery (which are usually so gross!). Only thing is I may pull rice off at about minute 18 because I like my rice a little al dente (firm to the bite), but that is just a preference thing. Thanks so much for sharing this, I just added it to my "recipe box"!

This is the best Mexican Rice recipe I have used!  KEY TO FLUFFY RICE:  COOK FOR 20 MINUTES ON LOW HEAT AND LEAVE ON STOP FOR ADDITIONAL 10 MINUTES WITH HEAT OFF!  I made several modifications based on the reviews I read -- no green pepper, increased cumin to 3/4 teaspoon, and added canned petite diced tomatoes, jarred jalapeño peppers.  Turned out absolutely delicious.  I paired it with the beef enchilada recipe.  I will certainly make again.

This was a big hit for dinner!  The key is to not to open the lid on that pot for the entire 20 minutes.   My few changes were that I omitted the jalapeno and cilantro, used 2 cups of broth instead of 1 1/2 cups and replaced green pepper with diced carrots.  I also sauteed the rice with the onion and garlic before adding the broth.  I think I'm going to try adding a can of tomato sauce next time.

Excellent! I didn't have fresh tomato or white rice, so I used red bell pepper, 1/2c of tomato sauce, long grain brown rice and an additional 1c of water. I'll definitely be  making this again!

This was good.  I used less cilantro than recommended because I'm not fond of that flavor when it is overly strong.  I also added the juice of 1/2 a lime, as others suggested.  Next time I would use a whole fresh lime.

This is a good recipe and compliments any mexican dish. I made this rice with homemake chicken enchaladas with red chili sause for our Sunday night dinner, and My son is somewhat picky, when it comes to rice, but he ate every bit of it. I will definately use this recipe over spanish rice any day!

This was so simple to make and came out delicious!  Agree with the other reviewers about adding the veggies and spices first, saute, and then add the broth and cover.  Yum!  Will make again and again - my fiance also loved it.

Let me just start by saying that I cannot cook toast without burning it. So, when I decided to take on this recipe, I had very low expectations for the end product. After reading other reviews, I decided to go for it. (Thanks a MILLION to the gal who said to leave the lid on and don't touch it! As I definitely would have) It was so easy and SO GOOD!! OMG- my husband loved it. My 2 little ones loved it as well- next time I will leave out the jalepenos so that they can eat more of it. There is hope for my cooking! Thank you!!!

Excellent recipe!  My husband said he liked it better than the rice served in the Mexican restaurant he frequents for lunches.  A definite keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

This is very spicy, and the cilantro is the key to whole deal.  Excellent rice.  Some may prefer leaving out the jalepeno seeds and just include the pepper itself.

Fabulous flavors!!  Isn't orange like in popular Mexican restaurant so guests know it isn't out of a box!!  Son rates and tracks foods and has been doing it since he was 6 (now 22).  This rice went straight to the top!

Loved this! I left out the bell pepper, to suit our taste and I substituted 1 can of tomato sauce for the tomatoes because my family does not like chunks of tomato in hot foods.  I thought the amount of liquid wasn't quite enough so I made sure that between the broth and tomato sauce I had 2 cups of liquid for my 1 cup of rice.  The only thing that I will do different is reduce the cilantro to 1/8 cup.  Once the rice was cooked I let it sit an additional 5 minutes and then right before serving I added the cilantro.  The rice was fluffy and did not stick together at all.  We will be having this again and again.  Thank you Alanasmom!

Not sure if this is an authentic recipe or not but my husband and I loved the Mexican flare it did have!! The rice was not as fluffy as I desired, but that was my own fault. It was still great!!!

This rice was a hit with both adults and children.  I chose not to add too much jalapeño.  The flavour was rich yet light.
It was easy to prep but it does take some time to chop the ingredients.  Let that not stop you from putting in the effort get ending up with a rice dish that will have people asking for more.

This was good, I did leave out the jalapeno since I'm not a fan of them but I left everything else the same. It was an easy dish and tasted good. Thanks for the recipe!

I liked this recipe a lot.  I will add either one very large tomato next time or two small ones.  The tomato really made it and I could use a little more of that flavor, but this was delicious.

Very good low fat recipe for Mexican Rice. I did not change a thing except had to add water because I cooked it longer. Doubled the recipe and fed 12 people with left-overs.

This was just okay for me, but my husband really liked it.  The things I didn't care for were the green bell pepper, which I don't like cooked, and there was too much cumin for me.  I think I would like it better if I reduced the cumin to 1t and left out the bell pepper, and maybe add another jalpeño.  Not sure I'll make this again.

Very good!  I usually make boxed spanish rice with mexican meals, but I am usually disappointed with it.  This was so much better.  I am glad to have finally found a recipe to make with rellenos or enchiladas.

This is seriously the best rice I have ever made.  I'm usually terrible at cooking rice, but this came out great.  I looked this recipe up at the last minute to compliment a meal, so I omitted the bell pepper and tomato as I didn't have them on hand.  To be honest, I didn't miss them at all, hence the four stars & not five.

If this is authentic mexican rice I'll eat my hat.  What it basically is is a jazzed up Italian tomato risotto...pretty boring but edible.  I excluded the pepper as I didnt have any to hand but you really do need it.  I think it would add more juiceyness.

I used brown rice to make this dish a little more healthy, and thought it turned out great. Very nice flavor.

Great recipe! I made just a few modifications which I think slightly helped improve the flavor....  First I used canned jalapeno's instead of fresh. The time the pepper soaks in the juice helps to give the final product some added kick. Second, I used green, red, and yellow bell peppers to give some added color to the dish (I was making the dish for a crowd of 25 so I needed the extra pepper anyway). Finally, and most important to the taste, I added the cilantro just about 3 minutes before it was done cooking (adding cilantro at the beginning to dishes that cook so long tend loose the cilantro flavor, putting it in near the end retains the flavor better).

I made this recipe close to as stated but used some review tips and made it vegan instead. I omitted the bell pepper since I had none. I used a touch more onion. I also fried my rice in the oil AFTER flavoring the oil with annatto seed and removing the seeds. Like another reviewer, I sauteed my rice with the onion and garlic before adding the broth. I used 3 vegetable boullion cubes disolved in water instead of the chicken broth and 1 chicken boullion. I also omitted the jalapeno pepper because I was out. I used 2-3 cloves of garlic instead of one.   After I cooked it for 20 minutes I found it was a little too moist. I cooked it uncovered, fluffing gently with a fork for a few more minutes on medium heat until it was what I wanted. Everyone loved this and kept going back again and again until it was totally gone. I would make this again and again. Next time I will add some diced potatoes and corn and peppers to see how those flavors marry together.

---I've continued to make this rice over and over again. I'd give it 6 stars if I could. :) The potatoes, corn and peppers I mentioned wanting to try were absolutely incredible together. I've also added 2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce instead of the jalapeno with fabulous results.---

The rice was good but wasn't as great as the first time I made it.  Not sure why.  The first time it was outstanding but I think I made changes to it.  I just don't remember them.  I made this again and followed to a T...except added Knorr chicken tomato boullion instead of chicken bouillion.  The rice definitely had a kick because of the jalapenos.  I added more tomatoes and cilantro after it was cooked to add more flavor.  Better than most restaurants.  I just think I need to work on it a bit more.

I made this for the first time last night and my husband & I both loved it!!  I did leave out the bell peppers b/c I don't like them.  Also, on the recommendation of other reviewers, I added the juice of half a lime just before covering the rice, and I waited until the rice was done to stir in the cilantro.  Thank you for this fantastic recipe that we will use over and over!

Very good, I halved the cumin since my daughter doesn't like spicy food, but there was still plenty of flavor for the grown-ups to like it too!

Did exactly as recipe states, except I just used the whole green pepper because I didn’t know what else I was gonna do with it and didn’t want to waste it. And extra garlic I used 3 instead of 1. Me and DH loved it, not sure if kids liked so much because they didn’t ask for seconds but they did eat it. Overall a great recipe.

I took this dish to my husband's company picnic and it was a huge success. I omitted the tomatoes and added saffron. In addition to the cumin, I added chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, oregeno, seasoning salt, and paprika to taste(Ingredients from Taco Seasoning I). I added the cilantro after the rice had finished cooking. The dish had an intense smokiness to it. People loved it.

For the folks that don't like the green bell pepper in the rice, what I do is put it a slice of it in the rice while it cooks and then remove it when the rice is done. This way you still get the essence of the pepper in the rice but not the pepper itself!

I tried it and it has a good flavor.  I over salted it though.  I don't think it needs salt if you are using broth and cubes to flavor it.  Not bad, only thing was the color was off a bit.  Maybe add some tomato paste and sauce to give it a deeper orange color.  But the flavor was good, cept for the saltiness. . .  my fault.

This was the best mexican rice recipe I've ever tried!! It was very flavorful and cooked to perfection. I followed another reviewer's suggestion, sauteed the rice in olive oil, added the peppers, onion and garlic and sauteed a minute or two longer. Since I didn't have any cumin I used 1 heaping tsp. of chili powder, and added the tomato along with the water and bouillon and I increased to 2 cubes. It cooked perfectly in 20 minutes. As to one reviewer's comment about twice as much water to rice--you have to look at the ingredients...this recipe has several moist vegetables cooking along with the rice which puts the necessary liquid into it. Trust me, this was excellent and my entire family loved it.

Delish!  Made this a few weeks ago with salsa baked chicken breasts and again tonight with tacos.  I made a couple of changes: no jalapeno pepper or the crumbled boullion cube, and instead of a chopped tomato I used half a can of Aylmer Accents - Diced Tomatoes with Spicy Red Pepper.  It added just enough heat to it, absolutely delicious!  I will be making this every time we have mexican food, which is going to be more often so I can make this rice a alot!  Thanks for the new staple rice recipe.  :)

This is really good, yet a little time consuming for me.  I have made this several times, but I will try to find some short cuts.  I make this with Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas submitted by Brenda and it is FABULOUS together!  I think this is our favorite meal.

Very good.  I served it with refried beans and shredded beef tacos.  It was excellent with the fresh tomatoes and bell pepper.  Much better than Spanish Rice.  I don't like cilantro so used parsley.

This mexican rice was amazing!  Per some other cooks suggestions, I omitted the bell pepper and used 2 cups of broth rather than 1 cup.  Also I added the jalepeno, garlic, and onion once the rice started to brown...cooked that for a while, and then added the tomatoes.  Definitely the best!!

Great Rice! I add rotel most of the time instead of deseeding tomatoes and jalepenos. My only tip is do not rush the cooking time! Let the rice boil in the broth for a few extra minutes. Also I add 1/2 the cilantro at the end.

I love this rice! Just don't get carried away with the jalapeno like I did! I used one large one and it is HOT even though I seeded and deveined it! I followed the recipe except for one thing. I did not have a tomato so I used 1 can fire roasted diced tomatoes. To counteract the heat from the jalapeno I stirred in a chopped avocado and am thinking I may need to top with some cheese to help cut the heat even more. Regardless, the flavor is delicios and my house smells great.

This is a tasty dish and easy to make. It goes well just by itself with a side of refried beans or add small chunks of chicken bits. I have made this dish several times. Yum!

This was only the 2nd time I've made rice from scratch. I made it for a potluck at work. It turned out pretty good. Personally, I prefer much spicier rice, but for a large group of people, the subtle flavors of this recipe were great! It complimented the pork I made, which was spicy, quite nicely. 
When I make it again for myself, I'll kick up the spices more.

I made this to go along with chicken enchiladas. This is the second time I have made this recipe!! My whole family loves it! I skip the tomatoes and jalapenos only because we don't care for them. But everything else was followed to a T! Turned out great both times. Thank you for this recipe!

These are not the mexican rice you find at the restaurants! I think they are a southwestern version or something. Anyway, they were really good anyway and my husband, who is from Mexican, loved it. I would make it again.

Great recipe!  The squirt of lime is the key.  I also added some tomatillos along with the tomato and also a packet of Zazon Goya. Just delicious with the chicken enchiladas and some refried beans!

Excellent rice! The only ingredients I haven't added to this are the chicken bouillion cube or the extra salt... just didn't feel it needed any, especially with the jalapeno for spiciness. I know I'll make this often, thanks for a great recipe!

I know nothing about authenticity, all I know is this dish was SO flavorful!!  With jalapenos being pulled off the market right now and no tomato on hand I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis instead.  This worked really well, but I probably should have drained more liquid from it as the rice turned out a little on the "wet" side.  We will make this again without question!

I liked the flexibility of this recipe.  Instead of just chicken broth, I put chicken broth, stewed tomatoes, and garlic in a blender, then added to rice and veggies.  It was awesome!  Next time I will try adding more veggies (like corn), and make it spicier.  Overall...very good!

Great flavor, only suggestion is to increase the liquid amount to double the amount of rice at least (1 cup rice, 2 cups liquid). This recipe was a little dry when I only added the amount of liquid that it called for. Awesome flavor!!

made this x4 for a camping trip.  Prepped everything except rice and water in a ziploc and threw in the cooler.  Added rice and water, and cooked on a campstove at the campsite.  Worked very well, and got lots of compliments.  Also made Refried Beans w/o the Refry and Fajita Marinade I (also prepped before hand in ziplocs).  Great change from brats and burgers, and dinner for 30 was ready in under an hour.

This rice was so good.  We've tried making mexican rice before and it ended up tasting like rice pilaf...not a bad thing, just not as great as this!  Even my picky 16 month old son ate this, and he doesn't even like rice usually.  The only variation I made was using jarred jalapenos, since I didn't have any fresh ones.  5 Stars for sure!

I've made this several times and it always tastes great. My family doesn't care for anything spicy/hot so I skip the jalapenos. I also typically substitute brown rice for white. I prepare a Mexican dinner at least once every couple weeks and this recipe has become a staple. Thanks for sharing it.

Excellent flavors.  Be sure to use the long grain rice; I had read that authentic Mexcian rice should be made with medium grain rice.  Using medium grain rice will make this dish somewhat sticky, like a risotto.  Long grain rice will make the dish fluffy and lighter.  Both are good - it's a matter of personal preference.

I'm from Arizona, and while this rice tasted similar to Mexican rice in AZ, it looked much lighter.  Next time I'll add more tomato sauce to redden the rice a bit.

This is one of my favorite recipes for a side dish. My only modifications: leaving out the onion as my husband won't eat them, and changing the jalapeno to a serrano pepper (not seeded). We like it spicy, so I also will add a dash of cayenne from time to time, depending on our dinner guests' taste.

My family is very finicky. We don't really care for traditional "spanish rice," overwhelmed with alot of tomato sauce. This recipe worked out like a charm. It was light and flavorful. The only thing I changed about it was the garlic. I used about a teaspoon or a teaspoon and a half of freshly minced garlic instead. I have made it several times now and will continue. Yum!

The rice was great but 1 1/2 cups of broth was not enough liquid.  I added about 1cup  of hot water and it was still a hit.

My boyfriend says it's the best Mexican rice he's had! And it was so easy to make! A tip for a better taste: Continue cooking the rice on a low heat after all the soup (or water) is gone. This rice tastes better if it's a little dry, the way Mexican rice should be.

This rice was fabulous!  
I omitted the jalapenos to have a less spicy side dish for company and it was delicious.  
Add some chicken, shrimp or chorizo and you'd have a meal. Thanks for a 'keeper' recipe!

I really liked this. I used sun dried tomatoes instead of regular and used red pepper flakes instead of fresh. I think I added more garlic and didn't both adding the boullion cube. Oh, I also used brown rice so this had to cook for quite a bit longer than the 20 minutes. I'll be making this again.

This rice was great as a basic recipe. I did make some minor changes:I sauteed the onion, bell pepper, garlic, and jalapeno first in a little vegetable oil until the veggies were soft. I used a whole clove of garlic, minced. I sauteed the rice as directed, and then added softened veggies, and 1 1/2 cups of water w/chicken boullion and a small can of tomato sauce w/garlic (all mixed up) and the rest of the ingredients as directed (except cilantro, which I added at the end). The fresher the ingredients are the better this rice will taste. As others suggested, the secret is to stir all the ingredients and wait for a rolling boil then put the lid on and lower the heat and put the timer on for 20 minutes and DO NOT PEEK at all. Once the timer goes off, fluff the rice and add the cilantro. YUMMO!

This rice was just okay. It may be authentic in some regions, but I've never had Mexican rice like it. Quite bland.

Excellent!  Probably the best Mexican/Spanish Rice recipe I've found yet!  The cilantro is the best part.  I did, however, omit the jalapeno and the tomatoes and instead, used 1 can of tomato sauce with taco seasoning that I had some chicken simmering in.  Delicous!

Great recipe and easy to change. I used brown rice and increased liquid by 3/4 cup water. Took about 40 minutes to cook though, not 20.  Used fresh salsa with cilantro instead of the tomato and ommitted the jalapeno pepper. Very good!

This was a fantastic recipe - the rice ended up plump but not limb.  I doubled the jalapeno's to give it more kick.  I also added extra diced tomotoes (finely diced and drained).

I skip the chicken broth (since the chicken bouillon cube is already in there), and toss in 1 'bunch' of cilantro regardless of the size it comes in. Leftovers are perfect generously added into a scrambled egg mixture and dressed with cheddar cheese in a tortilla shell served with salsa for breakfast. I hate to say it, but you won't miss the sausage.

I thought this was really good but no one else in my family was that excited by it.  My kids could take it or leave it.  My husband didn't like it at all.  The only change I made was to use brown rice since that is all we have in our pantry.  Thanks!

Very good recipe! I did not have a fresh tomato, so I substituted a can of tomatoes with green chilis drained. I also used a teaspoon of chicken soup base instead of the boullion.

We loved this.  The flavour was fantastic. I made it exactly as stated except I followed a few recipes suggestions and sauted the green peppers, onion, and garlic at the same time as the rice.  This was so perfect and nicely spiced for a side dish. It was also great in burritos.

Very delicious and flavorfull! I even used brown rice and it was great. I had to let it cook longer which also meant I had to add a little more water but I'll definitely do this one again.

I used long-grain brown rice because it is what I had; sauteed in olive oil for probably 10 minutes until grains were browned. Used a red bell pepper, "Better Than Bouillon", rather than a bouillon cube, skipped the jalapeno pepper and subbed with chopped green chiles (was afraid the flaming hot enchilada sauce I made for another dish would overwhelm our tastebuds).  Cooked for about 40 minutes due to the brown rice needing more time.  Was a very nice dish.  Thanks, Alanasmom!

this was and excellent recipe to go with any mexican theme.  I added a can of black bean to add some color and texture and everyone loved it.. I think next time I will add more jallapinos because one didn't really add enough spiceyness and my family likes things mild.  thanks for the contribution

This recipe was great, good flavor, we cut back the heat a little by using pickled jalapenos, and added a 1/3 can of black beans for texture and color. we did not have the bullion so we added a little extra stock. still came out great. lots of compliments from friends at dinner.

This is the most wonderfully versatile rice!  I've made it exactly as the recipe says, with mexican food, but I also sometimes leave all the spices out and add carrots, corn and peas serve with strongly flavoured meat dishes.  When in a hurry I replace the tomato with half a cup of tomato puree.

Very good flavor. I used red and green peppers, a small can of green chiles instead of jalapenos, and a can of mexican stewed tomatoes instead of fresh. The colors were gorgeous, and I could have easily added more spice for extra kick. I'll make this again.

Very good and a definite crowd pleaser! An ideal accompaniment to Mexican dishes. I give it four stars only because I usually like my rice less mushy.

This was so great and so easy to make!  The only thing I did different was to add small cherry tomatoes so that I did't have to seed them.  Loved it!!!

This recipe was just ok, I thought it lacked flavor. However, my boyfriend really enjoyed it. I probably won't make it again.

This was my first time making Mexican rice, and it came out perfectly! Really spicy too.  I added a little extra garlic and left out the cilantro, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly - yum! It's good left over too - doesn't get dried out like regular rice.  Will definitely be making this again!

This rice was very tasty, but a touch too salty for our tastes.    Next time I will try to use half the boullion cube, as the boullioin did add a nice flavor.  I used jarred jalepenos, but otherwise used all of the ingredients as written.

My husband hates rice but the only rice he will eat is Mexican Rice.  I gave him the rice from this recipe and he said that it was better than the local resturant.

Made this for a family Mexican dinner night and it was very well received. I omitted the chicken bouillon cube and used green chilies instead of the jalapeno as suggested by others. Wonderful!

This recipe was tasty and easily adaptable for a rice cooker.  I'll use more cumin next time and sautee it with the veggies right in the cooker before adding the rice.  Also, I completely eliminated the boullion cube just to cut down on the salt.

I have lived in Phoenix my whole life, and I can tell you that this is not like the rice you get in Mexican restaurants.  It's much better.  It's much more flavorful and complex.  I got great praise from my guests, and the next day, I had to make another batch just for me.  I did make a couple of alterations.  I used an Anaheim pepper instead of the bell pepper (this was an accident, having written the wrong thing on my shopping list).  I think it turned out to be a good move.  Other reviewers complained that the bell pepper was overpowering, but I found the Anaheim to be just noticeable, while blending nicely with the other flavors.  Since I knew kids would be having dinner with us, I used half of the jalapeno, but I think it could have handled the whole jalapeno just fine.  Definitely a keeper.

Excellent recipe!  Made exactly as written.  Great side to Lime Chicken Soft Tacos.  I squirted fresh lime on the rice, and it was the perfect finishing touch.  My husband said it's better than any rice he's had in a mexican restaurant!

We really enjoyed this rice. Pretty hot, I use jalapeno peppers in a jar, so I don't know if that made any difference.  Took other reviewers advice and left out the chicken bullion cube to cut out the saltiness.....couldn't see why it was needed when chicken broth was already used anyway.  Will definatley make this again.

Very flavorful!  I used 2 jalapenos instead of 1, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  This is just as good or better than any rice side-dish you'll find in a good Mexican restaurant.  The fresh ingredients make all the difference.  Next time I might use homemade chicken stock instead of canned, but that's the only thing I can think of that would improve this dish.

I took the advice and added the cilantro last, and also I prefer the canned tomatoes as they held up better then fresh, this is an awesome recipe!

I've made this a couple of times now and find it is best if I chop the veggies and let them marinate 30 minutes in oil with all the spices, adding about a teaspon of chili powder, 2 tbsp. of my favorite salsa, and using dried cilantro (fresh cilantro overpowers everything in this dish).  I saute the rice with this mixture before cooking it all down together in the chicken broth.  It's a five-star recipe this way (for me)!

Love this rice and gave actually won a Spanish rice competition at work using a modified version. I live in So Cal about 45 minutes away from the Mexican border so there were lots of Hispanic voters and people in the competition. What I do is I add in a tbsp tomato paste and a tbsp of better than bouillon, that’s it

I will make this again. I'm not sure what browning the rice does, but it tasted good. Had to dry out the rice 5 mins. longer by leaving the lid off, on low heat, and occasionally stirring the rice to let the steam  escape.

Without a doubt, the best Mexican rice I've ever made.  I forgot to add the bouillon but didn't even miss it and not really sure what it would add to the dish, other than more salt. Halved the bell pepper because as much as I like it, it doesn't like me.  Full of flavor, nice and fluffy. Pairs great with charro beans. Will definitely be keeping this recipe.

I just made this for my family tonight. It was a hit! Even with my picky kids! I didn’t have bell pepper, but I did have some garden fresh banana peppers. This recipe is wonderful to use some of those extra garden veggies. I think next time I will add 1/4 cup of corn with the rest of the veggies to add a little extra kid-friendly element to it. My husband raved about this rice, and anything he likes is a keeper recipe for me. Neither of us live in an area where authentic Mexican food is served, so this was a pleasant surprise for us! I’ll be adding this to my make-again recipes!

Great flavour! Easy -- just a fair bit of chopping. All in 1 pot. I did 1.5 times the veg to amp up the nutritional value. Added some cheddar on top for garnish. Boys LOVED it!

I made it according to the recipe, except I added the vegetables to the rice while I fried it rather than adding it after the chicken broth. I also waited until the dish was done cooking before I added the chopped cilantro. I will definitely be making it again!

So delicious. I did add the onion and garlic to the rice to brown first and next time I will brown the peppers too. I did 2 cups of broth and after the 20 mins took the lid off and evaporated it and then kept it on the heat to make it crunchy. I also used brown rice instead. Delicious

I am not a huge fan of traditional spanish rice, and i think its the sourness that tomato sauce adds to it. THIS however was a nice alternative to spanish rice. I wouldn’t say it was overtly “MEXICAN” nor “SPANISH”, but the flavor was good and it certainly didn’t clash with the other seasonings in the main dish.  I think that simply adding more of your favorite Mexican seasonings would do the trick it thats what you desire. 
This will definitely become a part of our regular dinner rotation.

Delicious Mexican rice!  Made it exactly as the recipe was written. I did put the cilantro in during the last 5 minutes of cooking, as some others have suggested. It does take some time to chop all the fresh ingredients up, but it is worth it!

We love love love this rice.  I found that if you sauté the rice in butter instead of oil it makes it amazing!  Also I’m lazy so I usually use one cup of jarred salsa for the tomatoes, onions and jalapeños.  It’s amazing with the fresh veggies too.

Very good rice.  I added extra cumin and a small amount of chili powder, otherwise followed the recipe.  Had my family for dinner and everyone enjoyed it.  Will make again.

Great, simple recipe.  I added a can of drained black beans to add some protein and took it for lunch at work!  I liked the flavor that the broth infused into the rice.

I used canned, diced tomatoes since I had no fresh ones on hand. I think they detracted from the recipe. Next time, it will be fresh tomatoes for me, along with a bit more cumin as others have mentioned.

Great recipe!

This dish had a really fresh flavor to it but mine came out mushy.  My stovetop cooks really fast so I had to keep adding chicken stock to it in order to get the rice to cook through.

I skipped the extra boullion cube, and followed the rest of the directions as written. For chicken broth, I used boxed low sodium broth (so I can add salt later).  Not sure it if is authentic, but it is very tasty and can't wait to make it again!  When I do make it again, I will probably add a tablespoon of tomato sauce, just to give it the right color.

This was delicious and it’s very forgiving. I used 1/2 a Hungarian pepper because I didn’t have jalapeño and a packet of sauzon seasoning because I didn’t have a billion cube. I took the suggestion of stir frying the onion and garlic with the rice. This turned out great. Can’t wait to try it with jalapeño.

Sauteed the veggies with the rice. Added hot broth.  Covered in a casserole and baked at 325 for 20 minutes.  This is my secret for perfect rice. It doesn't stick in comes out fantastic every time.

I used Better Than Boullion (a little more than usual to make up for omitting the boullion cube) which  I think adds a more authentic flavor, and instead of fresh jalapeno, I used canned pieces very sparingly which resulted in a mild heat.  (I'm very wimpy when it comes to spicy food. )  The next day I added shredded chicken to the leftovers, and wow was that ever good.  I will make this again.

This was really good!  I used a half a can of diced tomatoes (with the juice) instead of a fresh tomato (because it's what i had on hand) and it turned out great!  This will definitely now be my standard Mexican side dish.

Great and tasty. I had a lot of plain cooked rice so I just sauted all other ingredients and mixed it with the rice. Everybody loved it!

Wow! Best rice side dish I've every made. At restaurants, I pass on Mexican rice. At home never found package or recipe I liked. Finally found a winner. This recipe has a great fresh flavor. 
I made as posted. My wife is not a fan of spicy foods so I scrapped all seeds off jalapeño and rinsed in cold water to tone down heat.

For most part followed directions except I did put onion and garlic in when cooking rice as another reviewer mentioned and I didn't have cilantro but this was a hit by a very picky someone in my family.  Great recipe !!

Yummy, albeit with these changes for our tastes and available ingredients.  First, used a chicken bouillion cube, boiled in 1  1/2 cups water, along with 1/2 cup tomato sauce (sadly, did not have tomatoes in the house), a can of drained black beans, the dried cilantro, the cumin and black pepper.  Sautéed the onion and garlic along with the quinoa, which was used in place of rice.  Added the bouillion mix to the sautéed ingredients.  This made such a healthy and complete mix of yumminess.  Served alongside the Salsa Chicken found on this site.  Thanks for sharing.

I only had canned corn and it was delicious. Jalapenos would have added some nice heat, however I did not those either.

This  was a huge hit when I made it several weeks ago.  I did change a few things but only because of what I had or did not have on hand. I didn't have a tomato or jalapeno pepper so I substituted a 14.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes with jalapeno.  I did not use the bouillon cube because I don't think they add much flavor, just salt.  Everything else was the same.  I am definitely going to make this again.

This is a really yummy recipe. It's a good side for enchiladas, tacos, etc. One thing I've found that 20 minutes is too long to let it simmer. Rice will often burn at the bottom. I've simmered for 15 minutes with more success.

The only change I made was to add the veggies to sauté with rice before adding liquid. This is an excellent recipe! I've tried other Mexican rice recipes, but this is my personal favorite.

Too much work when you can just cook rice with salsa and have the same result. Plus the rice was mushy.

Really good recipe.  My new go to for Mexican Rice.  I do brown the rice and the veggies together to get the most flavor and I did omit the green pepper.  Otherwise I stuck to the recipe completely!

I've made many Spanish/Mexican rice recipes on this website, this is my favorite! I followed others' suggestions and sautéed the onion garlic and rice until light golden (on med- high heat ) then added the tomato for a minute before the broth. I didn't have canned broth on hand so I dissolved a tablespoon of Better than Bouillon into 1 1/2 cup of boiling water. My kids can't handle heat so I omitted the jalapeño and didn't miss it. I tasted the broth and added salt to taste then squeezed in 1/2 lime and covered the pot, turning the heat to low. Voila! Wonderful rice.

It tastes really good but the technical part can get tricky if you stray from the directions at all. I added chorizo and with that and the stock and the fact that I used canned tomatoes made there be too much liquid. But I fixed this by sprinkling in a little dry rice to cook with it. So good! I love it.

This isn't what you think of as a typical Mexican rice, but, it is good and was a great side dish for my chicken enchiladas.  I did add the cilantro after the rice had boiled and I had taken it off the heat because I love the bright flavor you get from fresh herbs.

Very good, but the additional bullion cube isn't necessary and makes this dish almost overwhelmingly salty. I'd omit it.

This is my go-to rice recipe that I pair with most Latin foods that I make. My husband absolutely loves it when I follow the recipe exactly. My daughter loves the flavors but doesn't like spice so I prepare some for her minus the peppers when I have the time.

GOOD EASY  this is great with Easy Salsa Chicken and other Mexican sides. I use Chef John's  basmati rice video to make rice. I add some of the green onions  while cooking in chicken broth. Add the rest later. I have also added peas.

I made a lot of changes, but the family loved it, and my husband said I should make it again.  My 8 year-old daughter went back for thirds!

Exccellent Rice!  Instead of green peppers, I put the colored snack peppers red, yellow, orange and it made it very colorful and very delicious.   I used long grain rice and it was perfect!!

My family loves this rice so much that I make at least a double batch every time.  I make the elaborate dinner the first night; usually with fish tacos or carne asada and black beans, and it's great left over (if there's any left) with a quick Mexican spiced ground beef mixed in.  I make it as directed with only one minor change: I prefer cilantro raw and add it in when plating the rice instead of cooking it in with the other veg.

This was absolutely fabulous!  I just changed the cumin to chilli powder as my daughter doesn't like cumin.  I did as other reviewers mentioned and did not peak...left it for the 20 minutes.  Perfectly cooked.
Next time I will leave the seeds in the jalapeno to add a little more spice.

I made this for a family gathering and so had to triple the servings count.  I followed the recipe exactly and despite all the other scrumptious num-nums available that day the rice was the hit.  I will do it again and often.

Very good. A lot of compliments from family and friends. I didn't add the chicken boullian and I had to use refrigerated cilantro as the three grocery stores I went to didn't have any. Next time I will saute the onion and garlic while I am browning the rice in oil.

Yum! I have now made this twice, and it came out beautifully both times! The second time I used a poblano pepper instead of jalepeno, because my wimpy taste buds cannot take the heat. The only other change I made was using brown rice, and therefore increased the broth to 2 cups, and increased cooking time to 37 minutes. Awesome texture, awesome flavor!

I made this for Cinco de Mayo and it was the best Mexican rice I've ever eaten.  I halved the recipe but kept the garlic amount the same.  Instead of a plain tomato and jalepeno, I used 1 well-drained can of hot, petite diced tomatoes with green chilies.  Next time I'll dice the onions and bell peppers the same size as the petite tomatoes instead of finely chopped.

I absolutely loved this! My dad used to make a dish very similar to this, but it was stir fried. He is half japanese so we've always eaten a lot of rice and he tends to create random stir fry dishes. For a quick meal he would stir fry the store bought pico de gallo into his cooked rice (there was ALWAYS a pot of rice in his house) we called it pico rice. these ingredients (bel pepper, onion, jalepeno, cilantro, tomato) are essentially pico de gallo. But What makes this so good (and even better than his) is that the seasonings and vegetables are cooked INTO the rice by adding it as the rice is simmering as opposed to adding it AFTER the rice is cooked. This rice is AMAZING. Like many of the other reviewers, I added the cilantro when the rice was done so it would keep its fresh flavor. i thought the tomato might get mushy and turn the rice red (the way i typically see mexican rice) but they didnt. Absolutely lovely side dish to the enchiladas and refried beans i made tonight

This rice dish is Fabulous as written! I do add a little Tumeric to the chicken broth to give the dish a nice yellow colouring, though.

Both my husband and I loved this! Don't really care if it is authentic or not, the flavours are beautiful and since I made this ahead of time, I kept going back to taste. It really is a wonderful dish and 158 calories per serving is even better. Can't wait to make this again. I did alter slightly in that I used leftover rice so I didn't need to add so much stock. I sautéed the onions and garlic, added the stock then the veg and other spices and let it cook down so it wasn't so watery when I added the rice. Thanks for a great recipe.

I like the change in this rice.  I usually make mine the traditional Mexican way (how my mom taught me) but I have to say this is a nice twist.  I enjoyed it very much.

AWESUM!!  Just browsing this site for what to do with leftover taco meat & stumbled across this recipe.  I made as is & added warmed-up taco meat at the end!  Yummy for a cold winter's night!  Will make again & may try adding shredded colby-jack cheese as I'm a fiend about the cheese!  Thanks for a simple, delicious recipe that doesn't use any canned ingredients - just fresh vegetables.

This may be one of the best and most authentic things I've ever made! Actually, my 12 year old made most of it while I assembled enchiladas. It was easy and the flavor is amazing! I didn't use jalapeños since I didn't have them, but everything else was perfect!!! You'll never want to eat that boxed mexican rice again!

Delicious!!!  I cooked the rice with the onions and garlic and did not add bouillion b/c w/ salt you can always add it but it's not so easy to remove it (I did include a few dashes of garlic salt and pepper).  No green pepper due to personal preference and one can of garlic and onion tomatoes drained in place of tomato.  This rice was so tasty!

This was amazing! We did have a problem getting the rice to fluff up as others had mentioned, even after following the tips of other members... We also found that this is pretty spicy (I LOVE spicy food), but my 6 year old, not so much. Still, I definitely recommend this!

Fantastic recipe. I'm from Texas and love good TexMex, however the rice at most restaurants is usually bland. This Mexican rice is not bland at all, full of wonderful flavor and a little spicy. The only changes I made to the recipe was substituting jarred jalapeno slices (that I cut up), instead of fresh jalapeno, as I did not have any fresh on hand, and adding a little bit more cumin than called for. My husband loves it, and so do my parents. Thanks for the wonderful recipe ALANASMOM, I've already made this twice and will continue to use this recipe!

Great flavor. I didn't have jalapeno or tomato so I just skipped that. Still enjoyed it very much.

I made it in a rice cooker; I warmed the rice in the oil (lid open) and as it heated up added the veg so they'd saute in the oil a bit. I stirred the rice around but didn't add the liquid until I was ready to close the lid and run the cycle. It turned out fluffy and with a delicious flavor. Will make again.

Absolutely love this recipe! My husband requests it at least once a week!!! Very fresh, flavorful, and easy to make. I usually have to add a bit more broth during the cooking process so my rice doesn't become dry before it is finished cooking, but otherwise a perfect recipe!

Made a slight change to this recipe by omitting the cilantro (don't particularly like the flavor)and substituted the jalapeno with chipotle pepper in adobo sauce.  Absolutely delicious.

This is the same way my mother-in-law makes her rice except she adds some tomato sauce and chicken and tomato bullion.
Then uses the chicken breast tenderloins seasoned with cumin, salt, pepper, garlic salt on both sides. Use enough vegetable oil to lightly cover bottom of pan.Heat oil. Add chicken cook about 3 on each side. add small can of drained petite diced tomatoes  1/4 cup of tomatoe sauce, 1/4 cup water. cover and let simmer about 7 minutes turning once half-way through cooking time. stir sauce to mix flavor from the chicken. place chicken on top of rice and add some sauce from the pan over the top.

I made this the other night, it was delicious.  I browned the rice really well like another reviewer suggested and I also added a packet of Sazon seasoning.  I added the cilantro to the rice right before serving and I also added a half cup of frozen petite peas after the rice was cooked and just let them thaw in the hot rice.  It was a huge hit.

This was absolutely delicious.  We made no changes except added a little more water as it simmered.  I made this with the Chicken Chimichanga from this site and it was fabulous.

Awesome recipe - super easy to make! I added about a cup of shredded cheddar at the end, because I used this recipe as a base for Cheesy Mexican Rice, which I couldn't find a recipe for. It came out great - I would add just a little bit more liquid, as the rice was a touch dry, but overall, a great recipe!

This rice was wonderful.  I did not add the cumin or cilantro because I did not have any.  I didn't add the can of chicken broth, instead I dissolved 2 bouillon cubes in 2 cups of hot water.  The only thing I might suggest is adding a little more salt.

This was really good.  It didn't have as much as a kick as I thought it would, but it was a great side for the other Mexican dishes I was making.  I made sure I had double the liquid as I had rice, i.e. 1 cup rice so 2 cups liquid.  Will make this again!

This is a simple and tasty rice dish. You can easily mix it up with your own ingredients. I didn't add the peppers or cilantro (didn't have it on hand). But mine turned out REALLY yummy. I cooked olive oil directly in the rice cooker, added onions and crushed garlic, sauteed for a little while before I added rice. I stirred the mixture for 2-3 minutes before adding the chicken boullion soup and tomatoes. It cooked perfectly in the rice cooker. Definitely a keeper for future rice dishes.

We loved this recipe.  I mostly followed as written, substituting the chicken broth/bouillon with their veggie counterparts.  I followed the excellent guidance of others and cooked the rice/onions/garlic first.  Per suggestions of others,  I added 2 cups of broth (not 1.5) that I had brought to a rolling boil & added lime juice as well.  My husband and I love spicy food, so we added 1TB of Cumin and 1TB of the homemade Taco Seasoning from this site.  I cooked it for 20 minutes, on low, and let it sit around for another 10 minutes.  This will become a new staple, thank you.

I mince the garlic, double the tomato and add extra green pepper and jalapeno.  It may look like a lot of vegetable when you start cooking but it's not overwhelming in the final dish.

Good flavor.  Sauted the onion and rice together, added garlic, 1/4 teaspoon whole cumin seeds and an unmeasured small shake of powdered cumin before adding broth, Knorr's vegetable bullion 1 cube, in 3/4 cup hot water instead of any chicken broth  (this was for 1/2 the recipe as written or 3 serving). I chopped the cilantro finely and added it when fluffing the rice after removing from heat and letting sit for 10 minutes.

THE CILANTRO IS WHAT TRULY MAKES THIS RECIPE AMAZING! MY HUSBAND AND I ALWAYS ENJOY THIS RECIPE. WE HAVE ACTUALLY SOMETIMES ADDED SLICED FRIED BEEF AND CHICKEN INTO THE RICE WHICH ADD SOME TEXTURE AND ROUNDS OUT A MEAL.

Worth the effort!  I made a whole Mexican style dinner and all anyone could talk about was how great the rice was.  The loved everything but the RICE of all things was the star.

First time I ever made this.  It was great - but I left out the peppers because my family doesn't care for the taste.

As many mentioned, this is not "restaurant" rice, but it is SO much more delicious.  We found it was even better leftover as the rice was able to dry out a bit and took on the restaurant-style texture.  It is very fresh tasting due to the cilantro.

Very good! My Spanish girlfriend calls this Spanish rice, since you fry the rice. Whatever....it's good. I drained a can of diced tomatoes and combined juice with vegetable broth for 2 cups fluid total; 3 mini, multi-colored sweet peppers for color; combined onion and rice together and sauteed until rice just began to brown; added cilantro just before serving.

Made the recipe as stated minus the jalapeno and added a little salt and cumin.  My 6 and 2 year olds ate more than their fair share.

My husband raved about this rice!  I really liked it and would make it again. It took a little bit of time b/c there are quite a few ingrediants to chop--so it's not a dish you'd make when you are in a hurry.  However, if you have a little extra time it's worth the effort!

Love, love, loooove this! I've made it many times and it's always great. Instead of the chicken bouillon I use a Knorr Tomate cube since that's what my mom uses on her rice, everything else I follow exactly.

Excellent recipie on it's own however i did fry up 6 slices of bacon and used the bacon grease instead of olive oil.  I also cheated and used a can of spicy red pepper tomatoes (aylmers) and dropped the cumin.  This is in the rotation and requested almost every week.  Left overs are zipped up by adding cubed cooked chicken and you have yet another fantastic meal.  Alanasmom thank you so much for such a versatile recipie that is well loved

This is amazing.  I made it with Bob's Mexican Chicken from this site last night for some friends and family.  Everyone loved it.  My boyfriend liked it so much he brought it to work today to let his friends try it.   The only changes I made was I added about a 1/2 cup of extra chicken broth.  1 small can of tomato sauce.  I used a can of Rotel instead of the tomato (only because I like it better)  and I also added chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder and paprika to it.  I also added another jalpeno because we like spicy food.  Once it was boiling and I turned the heat down and covered it, I did not remove the cover for the full 20 minutes.  I made it slightly ahead of time due to the amount of prep work involved to make the chicken so before serving I put it in a baking dish topped it with cheese and warmed it through.  It was great and tasted good reheated the next day. Thank for sharing we wont have another Mexican dinner without it.

Andale, andale! Arriba, arriba!  This is a good recipe for Mexican Rice.  If you want to add bit more color you can use sazon accent or goya with achiote. Even though this is not the authentic way of making Mexican rice it does has all the ingredients.  It will not be Spanish rice which in many places is called Mexican.

YUM! Absolutely delicious. I made it exactly as the recipe said to and it was super. I had to add a little more chicken broth about 1/2 way through cooking because it was cooking down too much, but that's the only change I made. I have added this recipe to my recipe box!

I made this as a side dish for Cinco de Mayo and it was really good.  I had to sub yellow and red bell pepper for the green because that's what I had in the fridge.  Will make again for sure.

This is a delicious recipe. I used brown rice and it turned out very good. One thing I would add is lemon juice just to give it a zip. Other than that, this will be my go to recipe for Mexican rice from now on.

Absolutely amazing! I liked it better than the rice i get at my favorite mexican restaurant. The only thing I skipped was the jalapenos because some of out guests don't like spicy food. Still amazing I can't wait to try it with the jalapenos next time for the extra flavor.

Good mexican rice.  Not exactly what I was looking for, but still good.  My daughter likes the rice at our local resturant, but she doesn't like chunks of veggies in it - maybe next time I'll try it with onion and garlic powders and tomato sauce. I used veggie broth and no peppers.

This was wonderful! I omitted the green pepper, used olive oil, and sauteed the onions after the rice was browned, then added the broth, etc. Added the cilentro just before serving. Maybe this isn't authentic Mexican, but it's like the restaurant Mexican rice I love. This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing this!

This is a great recipe.  I browned the rice and onion together.  I didn't add any green pepper and only half of a seeded jalepeno. The rice had enough zing without being too hot for the family.

Wonderful side dish for enchiladas. I left out the boullion cube because I worry about too much salt, and only used 1/2 jalapeno as my guests don't like anything too spicy. Quick and easy to prepare!

This was very good!  I left out the spicy stuff because I'm a wuss, but this was an asbolutely fabulous recipe.  I used all chicken stock instead of bouillon cubes and water and it came out great.  I felt the flavor was a little heavy on the cilantro, so next time I make it I'm going to reduce the amount of fresh cilantro I put in at the end.  And take the advice from other users and don't peek at the rice while it's simmering!  :)

Fantastic recipe! Like others I sauteed the veggies with the rice in oil, then dumped in the broth. I didn't add any additional salt because I thought between the broth and the boullion it would have plenty (and I was right). Thanks for this delicious recipe!

Good rice with just a little kick.  I had to adapt the recipe a bit, as I only had "Minute" rice in the pantry.  I added all of the ingredients but the rice to the pan and let them simmer together for 15 minutes, then added the rice and cooked it according to the instructions on the box.  Next time I'll make sure to have regular rice on hand to try this again.  The flavors were great!

Yummy!  I had to modify it a bit because I did not have all the ingredients.  I used brown basmati rice, an orange bell pepper, added a bit of cayenne instead of jalapenos, and used 2 cloves of minced garlic...And it still turned out fabulous!  I will remake it again using the correct ingredients to compare.  I can tell that the basic recipe is definately a keeper. I made it for eight people tonight included 4 kids under 8 years old and they all loved it.

Good flavor but not enough liquid. Mine dried out before the cooking time was up and the rice didn't cook all the way. So I was left with pieces of uncooked rice mixed with cooked. Also instead of using fresh tomato I used 1/2 a can of diced tomatoes, drained. I also left out the bell pepper. Had a good flavor so I will try one more time but definitely use more broth.

Not bad, but not great either. I'm vegetarian, so I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and veggie bouillon, so I suppose that might have made the difference. It looked nowhere near as pretty as the picture, either. Oh well.

This was kind of a pain because it needed constant stirring and I had to keep adding water so that it didn't dry out, but the end was result was worth it. I wish I'd had some tomato sauce though - my tomatoes were kind of watery and meh - but oh well. Thanks!

Don't know what I did wrong but my rice did not turn orange.  It stayed white.  I didn't add the cilantro, jalapeno nor the garlic salt.  I also used some rotel instead of a fresh tomato (per another review).  The rice cooked perfectly (although I don't know where it ever "puffed" or not).  Nonetheless it tasted good, but just not like Mexican rice.

This is an excellent recipe, I had my family over for fajitas and this rice dish and they rated it a 5+.   I altered it by cooking it in a rice cooker instead of on the stove, it was very moist and delicious. Anne

Really good and fresh tasting.  I added a bit more tomato sauce but other than that it is perfect!  This will be a staple in our house.  Thanx. Update 9/16/12 Added enough liquid (chicken broth, chunky salsa, tomato sauce) double the amount of rice. Also added chopped roasted poblanos and a little Chipotle powder. This really kicked it up a notch from already wonderful!!!

I really enjoyed this rice and I'm not a fan of Mexican rice.  The flavor was great although I doubled the jalapeno peppers.  Super easy and much better than boxed rices!

Holy moly this was AWESOME!  The only changes I made were I sauteed the onion and jalapeno in with the rice and omitted the green pepper.  I did add a bit of water as one can of chicken broth isn't quite a cup and a half.  I let it sit on the stove in the pan untouched for a bit while I finished grilling the chicken for fajitas and it didn't dry out at all.  A definite keeper!  Thanks!

For those who are looking for a basic mexican rice recipe that is similiar to what you enjoy from a restuarant or dare I say it "a box" then THIS is exactly what you are looking for without all the preservatives.  After attempting several different mexican rice recipes THIS is the one that I'll put in my recipe box to keep.  Thanks ALANASMOM!

Excellent rice recipe!  Very authentic taste.  I will add more garlic and a bit of hot sauce next time I'll be preparing this dish since I like my food quite spicy but the recipe is just fine as it is.

I made this for a camping trip at Glamis/Imperial Sand Dunes Ca. over Thanksgiving weekend.  It was a pot luck and was served with Carne Asada Burritos.  Every one loved it! I added a chopped poblano pepper (mild) and it added such great flavor.  Even the people who didn't like onions and bell peppers ate it!  I doubled the batch and there were no leftovers and people were looking for more. This is a keeper! I'm making it again tonight!

This was so good!  I can't claim to know what "real" Mexican rice tastes like but this recipe had so much flavour, it was wonderful.  I made it for a dinner party and everyone raved, I should have made more!

I made this last evening with Salsa  Chicken form this site. Really good and simple meal! Instead of adding all the veggies I used about a cup or more of my homemade salsa that I have frozen. I did not have cilantro or cumin so I added a tablespoon of taco seasoning. I was surprised how something so simple turned out tasting so good! It just makes such good sense to cook rice in chicken broth instead of water. I think this would be good with some beans added to it. This is a keeper.

I've mad this many times since finding the recipe.  It comes out perfect every time.  Once I used homemade salsa instead of the veges, and it still came out great.

This rice was great!  I didnt add the bell pepper or jalapeno because I forgot to grab it from the store and it came out good but lacking flavor.  Next time I'll include both and maybe use the diced tomatoes with chiles as well!  Great recipe!

A family favorite. I stick to the recipe except for the jalapeño pepper. My husband does not like hot things so I just leave it out. I have tried it with brown rice and it doesn't taste as good. Stick with the white rice. Thank you for a great recipe.

It was a little too hot for me, so I use a cayenne pepper instead for my second, third, fourth and fifth time I made this excellent dish. These also go great with tortillas. Add some cooked chicken, and it makes a great meal!

This was a good recipe.  I made a whole lot to go with Pancho Villa Baked Tilapia (which wasn't a good recipe in my opinion).  So, I'm very glad I had alot of rice because my husband loved it and ate a double serving.

This is a great recipe, the first time I made it I did not add all the pepers. I was afraid it would be to hot, it turned out a little bland. So add the peppers, as long as you like spice. Also it will need to cook longer that 20 mins.

One mistake I made was in mixing different kinds of rice. Each had a different cooking time and therefore the dish was crunchy and mushy. Apart from my mistake, I would like to taste a little more flavor before giving it a five star. Otherwise, the recipe was good.

This was a really great recipe, however I tweaked it a bit. I added cayenne pepper for spice b/c I didnt have any jalapenos, and I also added a half cup of frozen corn and a bit more chicken broth b/c it was a bit dry. It was delicious, my guests couldnt stop eating it. I will definitely make again.

This was REALLY good, however, it was  mushy. I let it cook awhile. I left out the jalapeno pepper and cilantra. Next time, I will definitely use both. I loved the taste!!! I added a little lime juice on top of my serving and it was delicious!!!! Hubby thought it was okay.

So good. Fresh and authentic. We added black beans and served it next to lime and chilli prawns. Don't forget a chilled Corona!

Great!!!  I'm always looking for new ideas at dinner and this one took the cake!  I did have to add a little more chicken stock but the end result was delicious!!  Thanks for sharing.

Flavorful and delicious.  Mine turned a little gummy.. Im still new at this rice thing. I realize you have to follow the instructions to a T otherwise the outside is done and the inside still hard.. Oh well will try harder next time .. but still very tasty.

I actually used Rotel instead of tomatoes & I didn't put in any green peppers.  My family loves them raw but not so much cooked.  Anyway, I thought it was good & very easy.  I will make again for my son & I at lunch but my 5 year old daughter didn't love it & although my husband ate some, he doesn't care for Mexican Rice.

Making a 20 serving batch of this for family and the spoonful that I tasted so far was excellent. I'm sure the rest of my family will love it!

Perfect Mexican rice every time.  Sometimes I add more peppers to heat things up, but usually the rest of the meal is where the spice comes in.

Loved this recipe.  I just eyeballed the jalapeno from out of the jar, next time might put just a little less in it but I loved the flavor.  Made to go with Texas Enchilada sauce and Spinach Enchiladas from this site.  All 3 recipes are keepers.

My husband is the cook in our house.  He made this one day and oh my gosh it was the best!!  I ate most of the leftovers the next day.  It only got better.  I can't wait for him to make this again.  Do not confuse this with Spanish rice... it is so much better.

Good recipe.  I used the whole can of broth.  I cooked longer than called for and I also added more water because of the longer cook time.

Good, but nothing to rave about. Made pretty much exactly as indicated. Like others say, this is NOT Mexican rice like you would find in a southern Mexican restaurant. Maybe this is what Northerners consider Mexican rice.

This rice taste so authentic...The flavor is excellent! I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles for a little extra kick. I also omitted the green peppers. The fresh cilantro really made the difference in this dish. I can't wait to make this recipe again.

I made this for a Mexican-themed party I was throwing and got great reactions from my guests!  It was a pretty big party so I tripled the recipe and it still came out great with a perfect balance of spices and flavors.

I don't care for bell peppers so I substituted some fresh tomatoes.  I also thought that made the dish look really pretty - adding some red colors.

The only other substitution I made was vegetable broth for chicken, since I had vegetarians in the crowd.  I added just a little salt and pepper instead of the boullion and didn't miss it at all.

I will definitely be keeping this recipe for future Mexican meals!  It was very easy and tasty.

I made this to go with our favorite enchilada recipe (beef enchiladas in the Red Betty Crocker).  We eat a lot of rice, and this one was a definte keeper.  It was far from boring and the different tastes linger nicely.  Fresh cilantro is key to making it stand out.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. Better than any restaurant's rice I've ever had. I used a fresh tomato, onion, and cilantro which I believe to be the key to how well it turned out. Especially the fresh cilantro.

This was fast, easy, and tasty! I didn't add the jalapeno (can't seem to find any in Prague). I waited until the last minute to stir in the fresh chopped cilantro. The chicken boullion gives it a nice flavor.

Prepared according to the recipe, minus the jalepenos. This dish was very good. The cilantro and the cumin make the dish.

This was really good!  The only change I made was I used a can of pettite diced tomatoes (zesty jalapeno) instead of the tomato.  Very, Very good.  I served with fish tacos, yummy.

This rice is REALLY good!  I ended up using a can of diced tomatoes with bell pepper instead of using fresh, but that was the change I made.  I also had to add probably 1/2 - 3/4 c more liquid, and it still came out a little crunch in spots..  I will definitely keep making this to find the way to have perfect results..  The flavor couldn't be beat, though!!  yumm!!

I made this rice tonight to go with Addictive Sweet Potato Burritos from this site.  The only change I made were to omit the green pepper because I didn't have any and I added about 1/4 cup of chopped, fresh Italian parsley at the end.  The only reason this recipe didn't get 5 stars is because the recipe doesn't call for enough liquid IMHO.  I ended up adding about an additional 1/2 cup of broth.  In the end though, a very nice side dish to any main course.

Awesome recipe! The cilantro flavor was a little strong even though I used slightly less than 1/2 cup; will use 1/4 next time.  Everyone (even my picky friend) loved it!

So easy and so good! I just roughly chopped everything, threw it in when the broth had boiled and let it cook for 20 min. Could not be easier. I also used just one bouillon with water, instead of broth and an extra bouillon. The ingredients are something I always have on hand, so I don't think I'll be using the packaged mixes anymore.

I love this recipe!  I've made it several times and it is always a hit.  It tastes like the rice at one of our favorite restaurants.  I usually add a little extra cilantro, because I love it, but I've made it without cilantro too.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  It is a keeper!

I loved this rice. I didn't have any green pepper but it was still really a great recipe. I will be making this any time I make Mexican food. I will never get Mexican(or Spanish) rice out of a box again.

We went crazy for this, I substituted ground chipolte chile pepper for the cumin (husband thinks he dislikes).  A very welcome break from Spanish rice or yellow rice!  Thank you.

Pretty good.  The cumin flavor was dominant.  We sauteed garlic and onions with the rice as other reviewers suggested, and I added the cilantro just before serving.  We also omitted the jalapeno for the kids' sake. Thanks!

I was surprised how well this turned out. I followed other reviewers' advice: i added onion right away w/ the rice, then garlic shortly after, then the stock, boil, vegetables, low heat for 20 min. I didn't have cumin so I added some cayenne pepper and it was still delicious! I used it for a burrito with some beans, chicken marinated and sauteed in salsa, and avocado and it was great! Thanks

This was a huge hit with my family. I served it with homemade fajitas and homemade salsa.(fresh salsa I from this website).  It was so good the requested the same dinner 3 nights in a row. Wow that was a first.  My kids are 14 & 15.

I'm a Mexican food fanatic, and I just loved this.  I'm in the UK right now, and can't find Mexican food anywhere.  I cooked this rice along with a couple other Mexican dishes and it took me right back to my favorite Mex restaurant!

This came out perfect!  Very tasty. Only substition was I like to use a little can of green chilis instead of jalapenos. I used some canned diced tomatos also since tomatos aren't in season right now.  We used this as a side dish with Salsa Chicken from this website-it was a great meal!

I would give this higher than a five if I could.  Sure beats the Lipton mexican rice.  I skipped the cilantro and salt.  Made this with the Beef Enchiladas II on this site.  Yum!

Great tasting rice!  I didn't have jalapeno peppers so I added a bit of hot sauce.  Next time, I would add a bit more water as I found the rice a little too crunchy.  Definitely will make again.  It went well with the Salsa Chicken recipe from this website.

This turned out really good. My husband said it reminded him of the rice at a certain restaurant we frequent. I'll make this again once I find something that it compliments. The chicken I paired it with didn't go over so well.

I'm rating this recipe 5 stars after using member-suggested changes.  OMIT green bell pepper and increase cumin to 3/4 tsp. Also, I'm a pokey puppy in the kitchen, and this recipe is VERY TIME-SENSITIVE.  Measure and assemble all your ingredients in front of you before you put your rice on to toast.  This is now my family's favorite "Spanish" rice recipe.  Serve it with Red Enchilada Sauce (Recipe submitted by Sara) found on this site.  YUM!  Thank you ALANASMOM!

i didn't use the jalapeno in this ( feeding a 2 yr old) and made it and it was really good, but then i made it again subbing 1/2 c of tomato juice for 1/2 c of the chicken broth- and i think it is incredible! thanks so much for the recipe it's great!

It was my first attempt at making mexican rice and it turned out perfectly, despite the fact I was missing a few ingredients.  I left out the garlic, and used canned tomatoes & onions, and dried cilantro...yet it was still delicious!  Thank you for the great recipe!

This rice is the BEST mexican rice I've ever had.  It has so much flavor.  It's even better than the Mexican restaurants here in Texas.

Thanks so much for sharing!  We LOVE it!

Delicious! I followed the advice of earlier reviewers and sauteed the onion with the rice, then added garlic. I used red pepper instead of green and a small can of tomatoes with chilis drained - used name brand rice and was sure NOT to peek! It was perfect! Family loved it - IF you have leftovers,(You might not) just stir in some cheese, scrambled a couple eggs and roll in into a breakfast burrito. Yum Yum.

Very good. I used cream of chicken soup
instead of cream of mushroom and the entire family loved this dish.

This was really good, much better than boxed mexican rice.  The only change I made was to use canned tomato with chilis rather than the tomato and jalapeno.  I also had to add more water and cook longer to get my rice to soften, but every rice recipe I attempt I have to do the same.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This side was very, very good and this is coming from someone who's not a rice fan. I didn't use the boullion nor the cilantro as we don't care for it. This went great with our Mexican baked fish last evening. Thanks so much!

I made this for my husband's birthday dinner and everyone raved about this dish!  The fresh ingredients add a lot of flavor.  During the cooking, I thought the bouillon cubes made it a little salty so I added cayenne pepper to balance it out (my guests did not think it was salty).  The rice had a nice little kick with this addition.  I will definitely make this dish again and again!

This recipe was flavorfull and tasted authentic.  It was also really
easy to make (hint, I chopped up and froze all of the fresh ingredients to make it ready to prepare in a pinch).

This is the first time I've made Mexican rice, the only thing I did differently was to cut down on the cilantro. I served this with chicken and bacon fajitas from this site. Whilst I could only get my picky daghter to try a couple of bites of the fajitas, she had second helpings of the rice and asked when we were having it again. Thanks.

HOLY COW!!!! I LOVED it.  I used a little red and a little yellow peppers.and just a dab of hot sauce because I had no jalapeno pepper. I dont know exactly how much cilantro I used, maybe a small had full I dont think it was as much as it called for but close.  I put the rice inside of a burrito and my kids almost had to roll me away from the table!!!! I couldnt stop eating it!!! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!!  By the way if you love cilantro have no worries about making this dish

Great tasting rice.  I increased the tomatoes, used hot pepper sauce rather than jalapeno peppers and added mushrooms.  I always have to be careful when cooking Mexican/Spanish rice to not let the rice burn.

When I was in the process of making this dish I wasn't sure of whether or not I would like the overall outcome because I really didn't like any of the ingredients by themselves.  This was a terribly wrong assumption!!  The rice was delicious.  I will definitely use this recipe again!!!

This rice is excellent.  I used half abborro rice and half regular rice (I ran out of regular) and it was so delicious. I usually make Rice-a-Roni Spanish rice with my enchiladas, but I didn't have any. I made this and my kids and husband liked it better!!

This recipe was really good, I've been looking for a mexican rice recipe for a while. However, some of it seemed almost mushy like it was overcooked, and other parts were crunchy, like it didn't cook enough.  I'm sure this is something I'm doing, since whenever I try to cook rice not using a rice cooker it comes out this way. Does anyone have any tips on how to cook the rice evenly?

I have been looking for just the right rice recipe to serve with my mexican dishes.  This is perfect!!! I will no longer be looking.  I even made this ahead of time and while frying up my tacos, the rice stayed warm and moist in the oven.  Thank you Alana's mom!!!

Even though I had some huge problems (not related to the recipe), it still turned out wonderful. About the time it was cooking for the last 20 minutes, our power went out for the night. Everything soaked in that chicken broth for hours and hours. I tried to salvage it the next night (we put it in the fridge, later) by adding about a cup of water and letting it cook for about 15-20 minutes longer. The water wouldn't boil out, so it was very moist. Maybe it's just the Southern girl in me, but I liked it better that way! Great recipe.

This best Mexican Rice ever!  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.  I did make a couple of small changes.  I sauteed the onion, bell pepper, garlic, and jalapeno first in a little vegetable oil until the veggies were soft.  I used a whole clove of garlic, minced.  I sauteed the rice as directed, and then added softened veggies, and 2 cups of chicken broth, and the rest of the ingredients as directed (except cilantro, which I added at the end).  This will definitely become a regular.  Also, I was concerned it might be too spicy b/c of the jalapeno, but it's not--it's perfect and even kid-friendly.

I made this recipe as directed and it came out great! I did have to add a little more chicken broth at the end because the rice wasn't fully cooked after 20 minutes. My entire family ate it up!

This is AWESOME!! The closest recipe I've found to the stuff you get in restaurants. The only thing I did different was sauteed all the veggies & spices in the broth, then a few mins toward the end I added Pre-cooked rice to avoid what other reviews said about under cooked rice. Also added the cilantro at the end too.......it had such a wonderful flavor! Will definately add this to my favorite recipes.

Wonderful flavor!!  I did add extra broth while cooking and the rice didn't turn out as fluffy as I wanted.  But that was because I did not reduce cook temp enough.  I will perfect it the next time around.

I loved this stuff. I used dry cilantro instead of fresh. Was still delicous. Warning:  takes the utmost in self-control to keep from finishing the whole pan yourself.

This is by far the best Mexican rice recipe I've made. The only change I made was, less jalapeno and a little more chicken bouillon and broth. Absolutely a keeper recipe. Thanks

This stuff is GREAT!  I used 4 Roma tomatoes instead of one big one.  I also used homemade chicken broth that I keep in the freezer.  I have made this by itself and also adding shredded chicken.  Also, I didn't have a fresh jalapeno so I used a few jalapeno slices from a jar.  This is as good as one of our favorite Mexican places here in OKC.

Let me just say this is EXCELLENT.  Made it the other night with some Flank Steak Arranchera that I get from my local Mexican Super Market.  I was so impressed that I am making a double batch today to bring to a friends barbecue.  I know this will be a huge hit as it was with me and my husband.

This is my new favorite rice!  It turn out a lot better than I anticipated and was even better the next day!  I didn't have any fresh cilantro so I used 1 1/2 tablespoons of dried and I didn't add green pepper but I followed the recipe pretty closely besides that.  Wonderful!

Not great but not bad.  It seems like this would be a good base recipe to add or subtract what you wanted.  I made mine this time w/o the veggies but would probably use mixed veggies and more cumin next time.

I followed some of the review suggestions (omitted the bouillon, sauted the veggies and spices with rice).  I used sliced jalapeno peppers but should have added more - it was still a bit bland, but I added a little salsa after it was finished and that did the trick.  It was delicious and even better the 2nd day.

This was awesome.  Easy to make and tastes great.  I used a 1/2 can of diced tomato's becasue I was out of fresh tomato, but it still tasted great.  The extra bouillion cube adds a kick to the flavor along with the fresh cilantro.  It's a keeper.

This rice was awesome! I decided at the last second to make some homemade mexican rice and found this recipe. I didn't have any green peppers on hand, but I think they would have been yummy! I thought I had some canned green chilis but didn't, so I threw in a can of Rotel instead of jalapenos/tomatoes. It made it probably a bit too spicy for my 7-yr-old, but my husband and I really loved it. I've been dealing with boxed spanish/mexican rice for ages, and I don't think I'll ever go back now. This was better than some of the rice I've gotten at the mexican restaurants around here. Wahoo, I'm excited about having this recipe! Thank you!

I loved this rice. I have made it two days in a row! Only thing I changed is I added a can of rotel instead of tomato. Thanks for the best mexican rice ever!

WOW!!! This recipe is incredibly flavorful and incredibly forgiving. I didn't have a fresh tomato on hand, so I used a dab of tomato paste...no white rice, so I used brown...also,no jalepeno or cilantro and it was still a knockout! I served this with Chicken Enchiladas II by Steph and it made a fantastic meal. Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious! I made if for a Mexican dinner party I had, and it was a HIT. I loved the authentic flavor, and it was easy to make. I didn't use the jalapenos .. was afraid that might be too hot. But it was still wonderful. A definite "do again" in my book!

This was very good rice. I didn't have all the ingredients, so I made a few changes. I was lazy and cut my peppers into chunks. As per other reviews, I omitted the boullion cube. I also added onion and substituted two cans of Rotel "mild" and "extra hot" (it's what I had) for the tomato and jalapeno. Everything else was the same. I will make this again. Oh, and I LOVED the fresh cilantro in this.

Although I didn't follow the recipe to a tee, it turned out wonderful.  I left out the jalapeno (didn't have one) and the cilantro (don't like it) and I was a little concerned it wouldn't taste as good as everyone here had mentioned but not to worry!  My entire family enjoyed this side dish and told me to hold on to the recipe.

This Mexican rice recipe is one of the best mexican rices I've every eaten and certainly the best I've ever made.  I leave out the jalapeno peppers and sometimes the tomato also, to please different tastes, but it always comes out tasting fantastic.  A must to accompany any Mexican dish.  I highly recommend trying it at least once.  You'll be in love.

This was very flavourful. I didn't have enough tomato so, the rice wasn't at red as it is in the picture, and i didn't use the bouillon cube as a review suggested. I also used some fruity hot sauce instead of jalapeno and the heat was perfect. I just threw all the ingredients in my rice cooker and everything was cooked to perfection.

Wow this rice was delicious.  It was the first time I made rice so good.  It was a little more spicier than expected but truly the best taste.  The whole pot finished in minutes with just three people.  It was that good. RECOMMENDED TO TRY

This was a very good recipe and tasted even better the day after.  The jalapeno in it gave it a nice flavor and really didn't add any hotness to it.  The only problem I had was that the rice didn't cook all the way, next time I will add more chicken broth.

Good flavor.  Better than other mexican rice recipes I've tried and my guests all liked it.  I used regular chicken broth and bullion and it does NOT need more salt as a previous reviewer suggested.  I used instant rice and no veggies except the jalapeno and cilantro.  This recipe was barely enough for 6 people

Excellent!  I cut way back on the cilantro, as I find the taste overpowering.  I only used a few tablespoons.  Tastes as good as the rice served at local Arizona restaurants.  Highly recommended.

Great flavor but definitely needs a lot more salt and 1/8 tsp more cumin. It would be really good with smoked peppers.
