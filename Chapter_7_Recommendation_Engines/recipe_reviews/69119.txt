This was really good. I drained the water off the kraut. Left out the sour cream and flour. It was perfect without it.

Wow.  This was a surprise hit.  I had some kielbasa in the freezer and a can of sauerkraut, so I was looking for a way to jazz it up.  In order to speed up cooking, I put everything other than the sour cream and flour in the skillet from the beginning with the potatoes and carrots sliced thin.  I also used dried minced onion and garlic powder.  I brought it to a boil and simmered it all for about 20 minutes until the potatoes and carrots were tender and the meat thermometer read 170+.  Then I added the sour cream and flour.  As I noticed all that delicious creamy sauce, I quickly decided to cook some egg noodles to serve this over.  Yum!  My 6-year-old son proclaimed it his favorite food.  What a shocker!

My German Grandmother used to make something like this.  It was even better than I remembered!!!  Even my son who hates sauerkraut LOVED this.  I will DEFINITELY make this again and again and again.  I did make a few minor changes though.  I diced and sauted the sausage with the carrots and garlic so I didnt need the butter.  I used chicken bouillon  instead of beef.  I mixed in the sauerkraut (which I squeezed the liquid out of) instead of layeriing it.  Will double next time for leftovers. YUM!!!!!!

I made this today wondering how it  would turn out.  GREAT!  It is one of the most delicious dishes i've ever eaten.  HOWEVER, next time I will make it in a dutch oven, as the skillet is just not deep enough and it makes a mess of the stove while cooking.  I had a surprise guest for lunch and she loved it, too.  The only thing i would add might be some chopped parsley scattered over it as garnish.  THANK YOU!

I didn't have caraway seeds, so I didn't use them. And like others omitted the sour cream/ flour step (although he added sour cream to the finished product after I mentioned I left out that step). My boyfriend almost ate the WHOLE PAN!!! He left a small corner!

We really enjoyed this one!  Just a few minor changes for us though.....used turkey kielbasa, olive oil instead of butter, totally elimanated the potatoes(and made pierogies on the side), and used only 1/2c. sour cream(low fat)......very tasty and a nice easy one pot meal. Will make again.  Loved the caraway seed.....adds a lot of flavor....great with the kraut. Thanks!

Loved it!! Creamy, filling, and delicious. I didn't have any sour cream so I substituted a bit of heavy cream and it was fantastic!

Delicious! I read a lot of the reviews... Use the caraway! I prefer it without the sour cream & flour. My husband and 4 year old loved it, too!

Didn't care for this... If you don't like sauerkraut you shouldn't make sauerkraut, instead of making it and then covering it up. My man loves sauerkraut and if he likes it, he'll go back for seconds... not this time.

I had to use brats sausage because thats all I had but we thought this was delicious.  I wondered about the sour cream but I really think it makes this recipe sooo good.

Very good and hearty.  My teenage sons liked it and even though it was not the "classic" sauerkraut taste, it was good for those who do like kraut.  Quick to make and not complicated, this dish is filling and inexpensive.  Will surely make again (and again!).

Great ethnic dish with the basics covered, so you can add your family traditions twist too it as you like. With my Polish ancestry kicking in, I used 1 tsp caraway seed, 2 bay leaves and about 1/3 tp peppercorns. I also did not use the sausage (didnt have it on hand), sour cream or flour, and it was a great side dish to a few lightly fried pork chops. I also added extra potatoes and plan to pick up some polish sausage tomorrow a there is plenty left!

This would have been tasty if I hadn't added the sour cream/flour which made it very mushy.  Very unappetizing looking.  I make a similiar dish but tried this for a change.  I followed this recipe exactly.  I do like the recipe up until the sour cream addition  so I may try it again without it.

I made this recipe to appease my husband, whose German mother made something similar.  Even though I don't care for sauerkraut, I enjoyed this recipe too.  The sour cream really tamed the taste of the kraut.  

I used chicken broth instead of beef bouillion + water.

A good one skillet meal when you need a quick and hardy dish.  I did overlook the addition of carrots, but I don't think they were missed...this even passed the preschooler test (she loves sausage!).

This is an AMAZING dish. I have made it twice now and I'd be lying if I didn't say that the first attempt was better than the second. The caraway seeds add a nice additional flavor. This is definitely a new favorite in our house!!

This was absolutely PHENOMENAL! My grandmother was Polish and used to make dishes so similar to this ... she's been gone almost 20 years now, but as I was making this the smell took me back to her kitchen.
My husband absolutely LOVED this! I'm a hit or miss cooker either it's great like this, or I make rubbery fish (don't ask). I made it almost as written. Instead of the bouillon and water, I just used beef broth instead. I also didn't have any caraway seeds, otherwise it was cooked as written.

Otherwise though, I wouldn't change anything - SO good and definitely a keeper!!

Very yummy! Didn't have beef bouillon or caraway seed and even after omitting those it was still delicious. I added some more spices for flavor and definitely replace water with chicken broth it makes it so much better! My husband loves it and my friends wanted the recipe!

Great one skillet meal!  Used ALL the ingredients with just a few minor "amount" changes.  My family loves sausage so I doubled the amount.  Used about twice the sugar because the can of kraut I used was very vinegar-y.  Used half the amount of sour cream which still gave it a nice creamy texture.  A winner at our house!

I was a little unsure of this recipe, but wow! It turned out delicious! I will make this again and again! The only changes I made were: chicken for beef bouillon (didn't have any) and I used dried minced onion and packaged minced garlic instead of the fresh stuff...either way, it was a great meal!

DELICIOUS!!  We all loved it.  I've had Kielbasa and Kraut for over 35 years and it's never been this good.  The sour cream, potatoes and carrots are definitely the finishing touch for key flavors to gel.  The only thing I left out was the Caraway Seeds.

This was super tastey!  It's pretty easy to make and uses up common household ingredients.  The first time I made it, I used up some bratwursts that we had grilled out the night before and it was quite delicious!  The cream really mellows out the sauerkraut.  Two thumbs up from a German Wisconsonite!

This was good. My husband said he "liked it, it was different". Will make again next time I will add more potatoes as I doubled the recipe and 4 potatoes just didn't seem like enough.  Don't skip the sour cream that is was makes it.

This is a great skillet meal!!!! You MUST try it with the sour cream flour mixture, it really adds to the dish. I halved the recipe using 1/2 a can of kraut, 1/2 can of sliced carrots, 3 potatoes, and 1/2 lb of sliced kielbasa sausage, kept the seasonings and the sugar the same. I put half of that in another pan and added the sour cream and flour mixture. I preferred the one with the sour cream!! Yummy I will make this again! A great weeknight meal.

This was fantastic-even the kids asked for more! I decided to make this as a side dish, so I added an extra potato and only used 1/2 a package of sausage. Following other reviewers, I left out the sour cream at the end. It was perfect! This one goes in our repertoire for sure!

Loved it!  I used 98% fat free cream of celery because that's all I had on hand, beef broth instead of water and a healthy dash of A-1 Steaksauce with the onion soup mix and cooked it on low for about 6 hours.

The taste was good.  I simmered the carrots and potatoes for 30 minutes before they were soft and I sliced my kielbasa rather than leaving them whole and then simmered them for another 20-25 minutes.  I used half fresh sauerkraut from the store and half bottled sauerkraut with mushrooms.  I don't know that I would recommend it to someone who doesn't like sauerkraut though, as the flavor was still strong, but that could have been because of the fresh sauerkraut.  If you live in a place without fresh sauerkraut, it might be more mild.  Will make this again!

Here's the thing ... I had fresh polish sausage, not kielbasa so I was worried it would get done. Took longer but steamed to perfection. I did cut what would have been sour cream in half but all I had was French onion dip - added a great flavor!

So good, exactly what I was looking for. For me and others at my dining table the sour cream made the dish.  With out it, it is just polish sausage cooked as usual dinner for us.  Yum Make it as stated is our recommendation.

Very good recipe. Lots of layers of flavor with the buttery carrots and sour kraut.  I too omitted the sour cream because I didn't have any on hand, and the caraway seeds because I don't like the taste they give.    Also, replaced water/bullion with chicken stock I had prepared.  Will do this again.

I omitted the sour cream and flour like others suggested - it turned out quite watery (the cup of water never really reduced) and the taste of the sauerkraut really got lost.

This was delicious! I didn't have the caraway seeds, potatoes or carrots, but found this through an ingredient search for sausage and kraut and gave it a whirl. I used the sour cream and flour and added some extra beef broth to make more "sauce". I had some leftover garlic mashed potatoes so I served it over them - sounds weird, but I think it made it even better.  This one was a hit with everyone, even our son (who HATES sauerkraut). The sour cream seems to tame the kraut taste, so I recommend using it. In fact, I'm making this the same way for dinner again tonight!

I made this without the addition of potatoes and carrots and served it with pierogies. It was excellent and the sour cream sauce was a great accompaniment to the pierogies! Nice way to perk up an ordinary week night meal.

I used boxed broth instead of the bouillon granules, so my version needed salt, I didn't add the sugar & didn't miss it. The next time I make it, I'll add some mustard to the sour cream.

It was tasty. I didn't omit anything and definitely not the sour cream like others did as it gave it the kick it needed IMO. For the bouillon and water, I added 2 tsp of Better than Bouillon and 2 cups of water. Added a third potato also. Thanks for the recipe.

I made a few changes. I drained and rinsed the can of sauerkraut, used a full teaspoon of caraway seeds, substituted 1 cup of beef broth for water and bouillon granules, used a bag of frozen California blend vegetables instead of only carrots. I also substituted a 1/4 cup of plain Greek yogurt (no sour cream on hand) and added 1/4 cup of dijon mustard to the vegetable, sauerkraut and sliced kielbasa skillet. I heated everything through in the skillet and served the mixture over mashed potatoes. Great meal! I served with the Herb Batter Bread from AR website.

This was very good.  I changed the quantity to feed two people, used Better than Bullion (1 teas) mixed into the water instead of beef bullion granules, 1 1/2 potatoes, an 8 oz can of undrained saurkraut and a whole package of Hillshire Farms Polska Kielbasa.  I would increase the potato to 2 whole ones, but everything else was fine.  We both liked the tart taste  and not overwhelming "saukrautness" of the dish.

Although I have used AllRecipes for over a decade this is my first review.  This dish is absolutely marvelous.   The ingredients blend so harmoniously and create a warm, satisfying, mouth watering dinner of deliciousness.  Don't change a thing but be sure to use high quality sausage.   I use Priemo  Sweet Italian from Costco and bake it first.  Thank you for sharing this!

I've made this for dinner 3 times now and my family loves it! Only changes I've made is that I also rinse the kraut when I drain it and I omit the caraway seeds and sugar. Excellent and easy one pot meal! Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  I took other reviewers advice and didn't use the sour cream mixture but ended up adding a heaping spoon to my plate.  I think the sour cream is needed for this to be well rounded and for the potato mixture to meld with the kraut and kielbasa. I will make as directed next time.  Seriously delicious! keeper for sure

First I caramelized the onion and garlic in 1T butter and 1T olive oil.  Then I zoodled a potato and carrot, left out the sugar, and served the sour cream on the side.  Husband liked his better without the sour  cream  and added mustard. The beef bouillon and caraway seeds added a lot to this dish, but I did increase the amount of caraway.

I was looking for ideas for using Polish Kielbasa tonight, and, being part German, I always have sauerkraut on the pantry shelf.  I was raised on sauerkraut as a child, and very much enjoy German food.  I prepared this recipe after reading many of the reviews, and pretty much followed the recipe.  I had a jar of Bavarian style sauerkraut, but no caraway seed on the shelf.  I only prepared half the recipe because it is only my husband and me, and to try a recipe I didn't want a big dish of leftovers.    I used up some baby carrots, two small gold potatoes, a third of an onion, a clove of garlic, and I also sliced the sausage into coins about the same depth as the sliced potatoes.  I cooked the sausage with the potatoes and carrots, I didn't add any sugar, and I used a little bit of fennel seed in place of the caraway.  I also stirred about a tablespoon of prepared mustard into the sour cream and flour mixture.  It was very good, we both liked the dish very much, and enjoyed having our sausage and kraut prepared in a new way.  With over 50 years of cooking daily meals in my repertoire, this gal can still learn a thing or two.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, and for the suggestions by other reviewers.

I didn't have  caraway seeds, but everything else was delish. My husband is Italian and is very picky and he loved it. I also made pierogies with onions and sour cream.

Awesome recipe but find its so much better if you cook it longer & also the day before. Also, I washed the saurkraut several times to rinse off the sour taste.

I made the recipe exactly and no one in my family of five liked it very much.  It definitely didn't need any extra salt and the sour cream gave it a tanginess I did not enjoy. I sliced my potatoes quite thin and even simmering double the time they still had a bite to them. Several other reviews left out the sour cream and I would recommend making it that way.

This recipe is awesome. I made exactly as written except I didn't use carrots because I don't like them. I would make the sauerkraut/potatoes without sausage as a side dish for pork chops too. Thanks for a great recipe.

I took advice of another reviewer and used a dutch oven.  I used fresh polish sausage that I cooked the day before and chicken instead of beef bullion.  Other than that I made the recipe as is.  I wouldn't skip anything at all!  The caraway seeds add SO MUCH flavor as does the sour cream. I don't even care for sauerkraut that much and love this dish!

I really liked this!!!!   You don't have to add the sour cream - I think it just adds extra calories!   I would add more carrots and leave out the potatoes just because I always make mashed potatoes! Yummmmmmm!!!!!

It was really good and easy to make. The sour cream really tamed down the kraut flavor.

Edible, but we didn't really care for it
