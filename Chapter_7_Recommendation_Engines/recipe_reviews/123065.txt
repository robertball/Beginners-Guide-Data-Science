Loved this sauce! My husband said we won't need to buy any anymore! I also added a few dashes of Worcestershire Sauce and Liquid Smoke, and reduced the amount of sugar to just a little over 1/4 cup. For the prepared mustard, I used horseradish mustard. Great recipe-thanks!

I never really thought about what was in barbecue sauce.  I wanted to make the barbecue beef cups that were also on this site, and I had no sauce.  I found this recipe, and it was so good!  I don't know if I will ever buy barbecue sauce again, and it was so easy! I added a little worstershire and that gave it a little zip as well.  I still can't get over how wonderful this sauce was, and that I actually had everything already in my kitchen.

Not bad! I made it according to the recipe and it was tasty. Then I added a little worcestershire sauce and some liquid smoke - bam! Yum!

Wow, this was great!  I was out of BBQ sauce and didn't feel like going to the store so I turned to this recipe.  I'll make this all the time now!  I like that as opposed to bottled sauce, you can make up just the amount you need fresh each time you grill!  Thanks for the recipe!

I'll give you that it was easy, but it just tasted like really sweet ketchup to me.  I added a bit of onion powder to cut the sweetness.

So easy to prepare with all the ingredients on hand!  I ran short on my usual barbecue sauce and fixed it right up by using this recipe.  All the kids ate their dinner tonight!

This is a great sauce, and I've made it twice now and intend to make it my regular!  Like others, I've added a couple of my own "secret ingredients", but the base sauce is amazing by itself also! Thanks Jenine for this sauce!

Excellent, quick and easy with a great taste. The only thing I changed was add some Worcestershire Sauce to it and turned out great on our barbecued chicken

This sauce was soooooo good!! And so easy!! I browned chicken drumsticks, and once they were cooked, I doubled the sauce recipe, (but there was ALOT) and put the chicken in the slowcooker, and drowned it with the sauce. My family devoured it for supper, then cleaned up all the leftovers for lunch. Definately will make again ... thank you!!!

This sauce was very good. I would use a little less sugar next time but it still deserves 5 stars. It's quick, easy and I always have these ingredients on hand.

This sauce is perfect!! Everyone in my family loves it! The 1st time I used it ( on chicken), I didn't say anything to my family, and they didn't even notice it wasn't from a bottle! Then I told them, and they all said, "Don't buy it anymore then, make this!" So, I don't! I've made this sauce for lots of dishes now, and it's always good! Thanks for the rcipe, Jenine!! :)

There are so many BBQ sauce recipes, I don't know why I tried this and not others.  It turned out to be just ketchup taste.  None of my guest could tell it is BBQ sauce.  Everyone thought this is just ordinary ketchup.  It is also way too sweet, so it turned out to be a VERY SWEET KETCHUP.  I followed this recipe to the dot, so would consider this a fail one.

I am not a big barbecue fan.  I will eat barbecue however it it if it is tangy.  I was looking for a tangy recipe and this one was not it.  It was way too sweet for my taste.  I am not sure why it is named Tangy Barbecue Sauce.

I didn't need a lot of barbecue sauce so I cut the recipe in half, but used a little less brown sugar-- 1/4 cup instead of 1/3 cup.  Also I didn't have any nutmeg so I used Saigon cinnamon (Costco) which has a sweet-hot flavor.  It was very good and I will definitely used this recipe whenever I need barbecue sauce.

I made barbecue chicken sandwiches with this from leftover chicken.  This fits all the criteria: quick, easy, and good! You can doctor it up anyway you like (hot sauce etc.)

This was good.  I liked that it was super easy and could be made from things I already had in my kitchen.  I definitely preferred it to most bottled barbecue sauce I've tasted.

I have been using a variation of this sauce on meatloaf for 38 years!! I mix 1/4 cup ketchup,3 Tbs brown sugar, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp DRY mustard and top a 1 and 1/2 pound meatloaf with sauce while baking. Never served it to anyone who didn't love it!! Also great to mix a little in with the mashed potatoes on your plate!!

I eyeballed the quantities and used this as a base...I added the drained beef broth I added to the pan when roasting the ribs, apple cider vinegar, honey, ginger and cinnamon. The cinnamon was a bit over the top, but it was still good.

This is good!  I adapted it according to reviews saying it was too sweet (used 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 2/3) and then added a tsp of onion powder and a couple shakes of hot sauce (per our tastes).  Don't know that I will necessarily use it instead of buying the store stuff, but I can definitely NOT panic anymore when we run out!  Can't wait for grill season to come back around so I can use it then - it caramelizes beautifully! - we've made this many times. No idea how many. My kids make it themselves.

This is A really good base for a BBQ sauce. Nothing wrong with it as is but if you really want to get interesting toss in some garlic and some chipotle peppers for a nice southwest kick. You'll get out what you but in. BBQ Sauce is a lot like life in that regard ;P

sauce turned out great.  I put a lil extra mustard because it was a little sweet, but very easy to make, and fast too.....
