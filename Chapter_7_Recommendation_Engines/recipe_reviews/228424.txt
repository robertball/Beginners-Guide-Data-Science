Everyone complains of lack of flavor.  The one essential missing ingredient....salt!  And salt is NOT something I like.  Nothing tastes good without an appropriate amount of salt.

LOTS of potential with this one. I'll do it again with other berries, other added ingredients, nuts, etc. Needed a bit more sweet for my taste.

I made substituions of sweetened vanilla coconut milk instead of soy, added vanilla, and used mixed berries (black, blue, rasp, and straw). It was incredibly lacking in taste and sweetness. I added stevia to my bowl and that helped. I think the ratio of quinoa and chia to flavorings is off. I'd use either a far less amount of the seeds or a much much greater amount of berries, honey, and whatever to give this a little more punch. As for my house smelling like heaven, well, I couldn't smell anything until I got near the crockpot and it smelled very earthy - not like warm vanilla and berrie porridge. Again, a ratio thing, probably. has potential, but certainly not as as posted here.

I made modifications though - almond milk instead of soy, used more water & less milk, left out the honey, used mixed berries, added cinnamon & pecans/walnuts. It's my go-to breakfast during the week.

Made this overnight and must say this has quickly turned into a primary go to breakfast item.  Not sure how these ingredients would create a house filling aroma though.   Very simple ingredients, easy to prepare, and very healthy, plus I can make a batch on Sunday, and have enough for quick healthy breakfasts throughout the week.   I did make a couple of changes.   I used unsweetened almond vanilla milk instead of soy. I used 3 1/2 cups of water & added 1/4 cup of Sugar Free Zero Calorie Walden Farms Blueberry Syrup.  Also added 1/2 TSP of salt .   Can't wait to experiment with other seasonal fruits.

For those who are not used to it, quinoa definitely has a unique taste, it can take some getting used to.  Also, quinoa is just like rice - you need to RINSE it beforehand.  Otherwise, you get an earthy, somewhat bitter taste when cooked.  So just put it in a strainer, & rinse it under some cold water before cooking.

I read the reviews before I made this recipe.  I used the base of the quinoa and chia seeds.  I did apples and cherries instead of the blueberries and added tons of spices (cinnamon, ginger, clove).  It turned out great!  I also added a wee bit of maple syrup to my bowl.  I loved the texture especially!

I would give the taste about 3 stars or a little less, but I deducted for the disappointment equal to the difference between the final product as described and what I actually woke up to.

I really tried to like this.  I read the comments and still thought it would be a good base cereal and be yummy if doctored to my taste, but it just didn’t quite make it.  I made it according to the recipe but I also added slivered almonds, raspberries, cinnamon and vanilla.  The comment about it being earthy was correct.  The comment about it needing salt was correct.  The comment about it needing brown sugar was correct.  I added all those things into my bowl after it was cooked but still didn’t like it.

It's a little bland by itself, just like oatmeal I guess! But with brown sugar, it was just fine. Different and full of texture. I like it but my friend found it too bland.

This recipe has potential, but like the other comments, it lacks sweetness.  I'll try again with different (sweeter) fruit.
