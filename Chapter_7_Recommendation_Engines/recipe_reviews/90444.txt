Well I changed a little. I baked the Talapia smothered in pesto and topped with a slice of tomato. In a pot I simmered the garlic, tomato and some pesto sauce. Then I added the sour cream and it made a beautiful sauce. I served the fish with a side of egg noodles and spooned the sauce over the entire dish. A couple of basil leaves and my family scarfed it down. A++++ and easy to make! Thanks

This turned out great!!  Based on others comments - I too made a few modifications. I used a can of Rotel (tomatoes and green chiles) in place of the tomatoes and added about 10 leaves of fresh basil.  It was awesome and had quite a bit of kick!!  The best tilapia dish I have made!!

Kudos for this one.  Since you can't find any good tomatoes this time of year, I used a can of Italian diced tomatoes (drained)I also used lite sour cream. This is a great week night recipe: quick, simple ingredients, healthy and tastes great!!

I made this for my husband and myself last night.  It was outstanding and I will surely make it again.  I used flouder, since that is what I had on hand and it worked great.  I also drained all the liquid off the fish after the first baking so that the sauce wouldn't be too runny when finished.

I thought this was one of the best fish dishes I have ever had. I loved the sour cream. The garlic and tomato were excellent. And do not forget to add the salt and pepper because they really enhance the flavor of the sauce. I would definitely make this dish again. My entire family loved it!

Great last minute quickie fix!  Very easy and simple.  I used roasted garlic and let it simmer with the tomato before adding the sour cream.

This recipe could easily be changed by using salsa, basil, or adding your favorite flavors.

Overall, this is a fairly easy and quick recipe. I definitely think Basil should have been added to the ingredients list though! And remember to spice the Tilapia good before you bake it, or it will be too bland. It's a keeper!

Beautiful on the plate and very tasty.  I used diced plum tomatoes, and, per some other suggestions by reviewers, added a little more garlic, chopped red onion and basil to this recipe.  Before I baked the tilapia for the first ten minutes, I seasoned it with just a little sea salt and a good amount of fresh ground black pepper, then drizzled just a little olive oil over it and a tiny bit of butter. 

This was delicious.  My only suggestion would be to be sure you are liberal with your spices when you make this.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe, thank you so much!  My 2 daughters, ages 7 and 3, ate it up very fast and loved it!  And my hubby who usually doesn't care for fish, liked it!  I brushed melted butter over the fish and seasoned it before baking by putting salt, dried oregano and basil on top.  And I used canned diced tomatoes.  Delicious!

Delicious!  Roasted the garlic and tomatoes before adding the sour cream.  Served with white rice.  A light and tasty dish.

We loved this recipe. I tweaked it, thanks to a lot of the reviewers. I did half the garlic recommended and red onions (sauteed in a little olive oil), threw in a few yellow peppers (cut very small, because I had them), a can of diced tomatoes and 1/2 a can of diced chiles. I kind of mashed up the tomatoes too to make the pieces smaller. I cooked the sauce for awhile because my hubby was working. I threw a bit of fresh basil in later, as well as red chili flakes and pepper. I only put 3 Tbsp ff sour cream. Continued cooking while I waited for hubby.... I finally cooked the tilapia - not as long as they recommend but close, threw the sauce on for the last 5 minutes, sprinkled with parmesan and voila! It turned out really nice, not bland at all.

But, I really liked this and I thought I would pass on my changes as well.  I thawed 4 pieces of frozen tilapia.  Baked it about 15 minutes with butter, garlic salt and pepper.  For the sauce, I only had italian stewed tomatoes and pre-minced garlic.  So I simmered the tomatoes with the garlic and added salt and pepper.  I realized that I didn't have any sour cream after the fact, so I added 4 T of cream cheese.  Very yummy fish.  My whole family liked it.

This was great!  So simple and delicious - and healthy!  We used light sour cream and followed the recipe almost exactly (great way to use up my italian tomatoes) - I used less garlic than the recipe because it seemed like a lot but next time I will add more!  Next time I will add some basil and spinach to the mix and serve over rice!  A definite keeper!

Instead of fresh tomato, I used a can of petite diced tomato.  I also added chopped fresh cilantro.  This was super easy and delicious.  The cook time was perfect.

This recipe is the bomb! I rubbed the fish in butter and a bit of sea salt before I put it in the oven for the first 10 minutes. Then I sauteed the garlic and a can of tomatoes in a dab of butter while the fish was cooking. I added the sour cream just before pouring it over the fish. I cooked it for 15 minutes the second time. It was such a great variation to talapia. We eat a lot of fish and I like the ease of this recipe!! And the taste was fantastic!!!

Fixed this for company based on input from the reviews.  Salted and peppered fish then spread pesto liberally on top.  Put garlic in can of diced tomatoes on the stove and simmered with a couple spoons of pesto sauce.  Added reduced fat sour cream, stirred, and poured over fish after 10 minutes baking. Served with yummy warm whole grain bread, steamed asparagus, and Lemon Orzo Primavera from this website.  They both went back for seconds!  This is easy, lovely and healthy.  Might serve with noodles next time to take full advantage of the sauce, but both my husband and our friend said it was great just the way it was.  Thanks!

I give this two stars because it had way too much garlic. I even used only two cloves, and I am a garlic lover. I think this would have benefited from sauteing the garlic beforehand. It really ruined it for me. I took two bites, and gave it to my husband (who agreed it had too much garlic but ate it nonetheless).

I made this last night and it was FABULOUS!  I took advice from some of the other people and added some fresh basil and parmesan cheese.  We have an abundance of tomatoes from our garden and this was a great way to use them. I doubled the sauce and served the fish and sauce over some whole wheat pasta.   YUM!

mmm. I used cream cheese instead of sour cream, and I didn't have tomatoes, so I used a little salsa and some taco sauce, roasted garlic, and sun dried tomatoes. I also added basil, oregano, a little cayenne pepper, and dill. I also put in some seasoned rice vinegar to make more sauce. I served the fish & sauce over pasta with cut up fresh bell peppers.

I thought this was delicious. I had all the ingredients on hand, so it was very easy to whip up. I only had a can of chili-ready diced tomatoes with onions. This gave it a little kick, so if you like spicy, you might consider going that route. I would definitely make again.

This recipe was SOOOOO fast and EASY!!!  Dinner was done in 15 minutes and it tasted delicious!  My husband thought I slaved over some sort of a vodka cream sauce...HA!  If you like garlic and tomatoes, you'll love this recipe.  I was hesitant about the sour cream, but you don't even know that's what was used for the delicious topping.

Oh my gosh this was amazing!!!  There was absolutely nothing "bland" about this recipe, it was incredible!  I used the Italian Style diced tomatoes (drained -- they have basil and garlic already in them).  I also simmered the tomatoes and garlic a bit (about 10 minutes -- while the fish was cooking) to mix the flavors.  And I seasoned the fish before baking it.  I put it on top of some left-over bow-tie pasta and it was superb!  Incredibly fast, easy, and delicious!

This recipe was great.  I changed it a bit by flaking the fish, adding two fresh tomatoes, a little more sour cream, and adding it to rotini pasta with a little asiago and parmesan cheeses.  We served it with fresh, cracked pepper, salt, and a mixed greens salad on the side.  E buono!

This was super easy and good. I would like to give it 3.5 stars, but I can only give whole stars! I think next time I will used canned tomatoes, as they are already peeled. The fresh basil added a nice touch.

I will definitely make this again. I used a can of stewed tomatoes because that's all I had on hand. I cut them cup and let them simmer with the garlic and a little juice from the can while the the fish was cooking, then I added the sour cream and spooned over fish and continued cooking for about 10 minutes. Very good!

WE REALLY LIKE THIS. I increased recipe to 6 frozen tilapia filets (thawed). I used one can italian seasoned diced tomatoes with less salt and one can mild rotel - both undrained. Seasoned the fish with a little olive oil, sea salt and pepper during the first 10 minutes of cooking. Then cooked for 20 with the tomato/garlic/sourcream mixture. Served over whole wheat rotini with green beans and bread sticks. SO good!

This recipe was easy to follow. I read other reviews, and upon their recommendations, I added fresh basil. Also, be sure to use seasonings liberally, I found the original didn't have much taste until I added garlic powder, dried basil, and more salt and pepper. My husband was impressed, and he is a picky eater!

I made a few changes but my entire family, kids and all loved it. I topped the fish with pesto and threw it in the oven, then chopped tomatoes, fresh basil, garlic and some more peston in a pan on the stove. Sauted it a little, 10 min later I threw all of it on top of the half bakes fish, cooked another 5 min. It was easy and very good.

Very flavorful if you use enough spices.  I used the 4 cloves garlic, some italian seasoning, onion powder.  Salt and pepper in the sauce and also on the fish.  Used reduced fat sour cream, but could probably leave it out altogether next time.  Husband who doesn't like fish overall said I made him think about ordering Tilapia at a restaurant, which is pretty fantastic.

This is the first recipe I tried from this website, even though I have found several I want to try. I just got married, and this is the first "from scratch" meal I made and my hubby loved it! :) I took some other reviewers' advice and sorta simmered the tomatoes (I used canned italian) with some extra basil, oregano, and garlic powder. (didn't have garlic cloves) Then spread on the fish 10 min. into baking. Husband asked to put feta on his fish, and he really enjoyed it! Great recipe, will make again! :D
EDIT: Forgot to say I didn't even have sour cream, and it turned out wonderfully!

This recipe was quick and good...I liked the color of the salsa after it came out. Instead of just smashing the garlic and tomatoes together, I roasted the garlic in Olive Oil with some onions and blended it in with the tomatoes. I also added some basil leaves that added a kick...I'm thinking next time maybe ill blend in some Jalepeno..I love my salsa spicy!! All around good fast recipe made it within 30 minutes.

A really great dish with fresh tomatoes and garlic.  Try using your favorite heirloom with this recipe.  Maybe some fresh basil would be good to try.

This recipe really has to be tweaked. I liked the fresh tomato flavor, but the overall flavor was really lacking. Next time I'll add butter and garlic salt. My husband normally doesn't have anything bad to say about my cooking, but this one he didn't like.

My whole family including 2 young children loved this.  I did add some basil as mentioned, but I also made sure to not skimp on any of the ingredients.  It was very flavorful, and the prep time was faster by using my food processor to chop up the tomato and garlic

Fantastic!  My husband and 4 kids gobbled it up!  I omitted the sour cream, and used canned tomatoes.  I also stirred in some chopped fresh basil with the tomatoes and garlic.  I served it with buttered egg noodles and it got rave reviews from the whole crew.  I will definately make this again.

This is such an easy, yummy way to make tilapia. I too used an entire can of rotel tomatos & reduce fat sour cream. I did not have fresh garlic, so I just used garlic powder and added alittle bit of red pepper to make sure it had a kick. I poured the fish and sauce over rice and it was a fantastic complete meal.

We did not enjoy this one at all.. I'm not sure if tomatoes and sour cream was the best mix.  Thanks for the recipe though!

I am normally a HUGE fan of tomato garlic recipies, but for some reason this taste did not compliment the fish. I would have rather used another recipie and will not be having this one again.

This recipe was really quick and super easy.  I was trying to figure out a way to make a quick lunch using up the last of my tilapia filets and diced tomatoes and this is what came up in the recipe finder.  I was out of sour cream and so I used parmesan cheese instead.  I bet it would have been even better with the sour cream, but my modification was still pretty tasty.  Low in fat, too!

This recipe is great!  I tried it using 14.5 oz can of diced tomatos with jalapenos and it added a nice spicy kick.  I'll bet the sauce is good on chicken or as a dip too.

I, like many others, made little modifications but the base of the recipe was used and it was great! I just have to find the right combo of pasta and i'll be sharing it with those I know. Not bad at all for a fist time trying Tilapia...

Wow! This was a great and easy recipe that the whole family enjoyed. The kids are not to fond of fish, so I pounded some boneless skinless chicken breasts to about the thickness of the Tilapia. I cooked them at 350deg for 15min and then put sauce on and finished for another 15 min. For the sauce I used a 28oz can of chunky crushed tomatoes and the other ingredients(calculated for 5 servings). I also warmed sauce on stovetop to be sure it was heated through. Served with a pasta recipe from this site(Pasta Hot! Hot! Hot!). The family liked it so much, I have to make it again tonite. Definately a keeper. Thanks Zoya13!

I took the suggestion of one of the reviewers and substituted non-fat plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  I also added cayenne pepper for flavor and served it with brown rice.  It made a very low-fat version of an already lower-fat recipe.  The cayenne pepper did wonders for the blandness!

Just finished eating this.  Mmmm... Added 10 fresh, sliced basil leaves.  Got home from the grocery store and realized I'd forgotten the garlic cloves(isn't that how it goes) so substituted garlic salt.  Used two fresh tomatoes and diced them up.  It was delish!  Boyfriend enjoyed as well.  Served on jasmine rice.

This was good.  However, next time I'll add salt to the tomato/garlic sauce and roast the garlic first to combine it better.  Otherwise, you end up biting into pieces of garlic.

This was absolutely amazing, and SO easy!!! I tweaked it just a tiny bit. I used whole stewed tomatoes since that was all I had, and light sour cream. I also threw in about 5 leaves of fresh chopped basil. It came out so good my husband asked me to make it again later this week!

This is my first time to review but I enjoyed this so much I had to chime in!  I made this a 15 min. meal with angel hair pasta (which cooks fast.) I used a can of tomatoes with roasted garlic and onion.  I browned the tilapia filets in a bit of olive oil then added the tomatoes and sour cream.  By the time the pasta was cooked the filets were done. Quick steam-in-the bag green beans made a lovely compliment. Gorgeous, healthy and delicious!

I followed the advice of others and used the RoTel tomatoes and added fresh basil and simmered the sauce before putting on the tilapia. I did season the tilapia with salt, pepper, all purpose dill mix(Pampered Chef spice) and lemon pepper. This was very good and an easy QUICK meal. I used the sauce on 5 fillets and have leftovers to take to work.  Will defiantely use again!

I tried this recipe. I used minced garlic, italian seasoning, salt and pepper. I let the fish get a little brown around the edges before I poured the sauce on. My sister who is pregnant said it was good.

I thought this was great!!  My hubby and one of the kids didn't really like the sauce very well but ate the fish.  I added a bit of onion to the tomato mix and used my handheld blender/chopper to puree it.  Next time I think I will only puree half of the mixture and then mix in the chunky stuff.  I served this over Jasmine rice and had glazed carrots on the side.

This is a great, easy, delicious dinner.  I am rating it 5 stars, however I did add some italian seasoning and some cayenne pepper to it for a little boost.  But it would even be delicious just how its written. Even my picky 10 year old loved it!

I made this for dinner tonight. I thought it was pretty good!  Might have been even better if some onions were added to the sauce.  Also, rather than baking the sauce on the fish, I think I will cook it on the stovetop next time first.

This was a nice change.  The addition of the sour cream takes the acid out of the tomoatoes. Easy and quick

This was good, definitely much different from the way I normally cook fish. I used a can of petite diced tomatoes as opposed to fresh, because it's hard to get decent tomatoes here yet. I'll probably make this again when I'm looking for a change of pace. Thanks!

I didn't care for this recipe. I did it exact except I added basil and even some onion and Italian season but it was horribly bland. It may be good with rotel tomatoes instead, but I didn't like it like this.
