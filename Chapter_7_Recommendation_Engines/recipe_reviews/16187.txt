I cut this recipe in half. I did follow the recipe closely, only using finely chopped red pepper in the patties instead of green peppers. I did use a homemade pizza sauce. This was an interesting way to prepare patties--it's like a mixture between meatballs, meat loaf and pizza. I had a difficult time keeping the stewed tomatoes in the patties and the mushrooms, olives and pepperoni was a bit awkward on top even though it's held in place with the mozzerella cheese. Though it's not quite a home run for us yet, the base recipe was great and I think I'll play with it a little to make it a family favorite.

I made this recipe much healthier and it tasted great! I used 1/2 ground pork and 1/2 ground chicken breast. I used egg whites and panko bread crumbs and omitted the salt all together. I used green onions instead of the gr bell pepper. I stuffed these w/ Canadian bacon, onion, reduced fat mozz chz, and roasted red bell peppers. I grilled these outside. I topped them w/ sauted onions and roasted red bell pepper w/ a little of a low sugar spag. sauce (which I also added a spoon full inside the patties and mixed w/ the meat). I probably cut the fat and calories by at least 1/2! These were good!

My family really enjoyed this recipe. It is a cross between meatloaf and pizza. It's a nice change from the usual.

These patties were very good! My kids loved them sooo much. I made them again the next day. The only thing I did day 2 was I cooked them on the grill and put the veggies, sauce and cheese on top. Either way....YUM YUM!!!!!!!

Very strange recipe.  My wife liked it a lot more than I did.  Tastes like a mix between meatloaf and pizza.

This was very delicious. If your kids aren't big on olives or mushrooms just don't put them on their patties! It also makes enough for two meals for a family of 5. (I froze five patties before baking them.)

I was not to pleased with this. Maybe it was the kind of pizza sauce I used. Wasn't bad, just not great.

Wonderful recipe! We really enjoyed these. When I make them next time, I would recommend a couple things. Since there is so much fat in the beef and pepperoni, the pan should be drained about 1/2 way into the cooking. Also, our cheese burned a bit on top- which might be due to our crappy oven! Perhaps bake for the first half without the cheese, then add the cheese during the second half on top. Great recipe.. will make again and again.
