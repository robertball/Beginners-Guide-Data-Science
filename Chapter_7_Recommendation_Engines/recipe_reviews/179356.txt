I have to agree with the person below me. This is a great change from the traditional 3 ingredient recipe. I have used both Jimmy Dean Sage Sausage and mild Venison sausage both are wonderful. The added milk keeps the balls moist and not doughy. The herbs add the perfect amount of flavor missing from the 3 ingredient version and u can never have too much cheese in my house. If u enjoy this recipe another family favorite is the Bisquick Breakfast Casserole. Both recipes are tasty and simple. I hope your family enjoys these as much as my family does.

I omitted the rosemary and doubled the milk.  It was very dry.  They're great to prepare a day ahead of time and freeze beautifully.

Just like the ones Memom use to make. My husband had never had them before, and he DEVOURED the whole batch. I recommend doubling!

This is a fantastic recipe and a super change from the regular, easy 3 ingredient ones I always used to make. If you want great flavor and that homeade taste, these are the way to go!

I wasn't really a fan of these. I followed recipe exactly. I used bob Evans sausage. They were bland. Too bready. This recipe calls for twice the amount of bisquick and half the amount of sausage similar recipes call for! if I had to give a tip to anyone wanting to make these I'd say use 1/4  the bisquick in this recipe.  I will not be making this one again.

This recipe was super easy! Made it for my son's basketball team dinner. Added a teaspoon of crushed red pepper to give it a little kick. Loved it!

Awesome! Family loved them and in-laws said they were better than their mom's. I added some ground sage and cooked them only about 17-18 mins on parchment. Note: makes 50 1-oz balls

I loved these the first time I made them. Second go around I added finely chopped onions and granulated garlic. Love them with the addition of these 2 ingredients.

I've made these twice so far. Both times turned out great. I only used the sausage, Bisquick and cheddar cheese and a little shorter cooking time, so they wouldn't dry out. Wonderful!

Great base recipe! I added more spices and extra sausage and everyone loved them. Super moist inside and crispy outside. Yummy! Oh, and by adding the extra sausage I was able to half the dough and make an extra spicy batch.

I made these for a party over the weekend and they were very yummy.  They had that little bit of extra "something" that the 3 ingredient sausage-cheese balls lack.  I will toss the old recipe and keep this one for sure!  I got lots of compliments!

I LOVE these things! They have been a family tradition on Christmas morning since I was a little kid. This recipe is a little dry though:( Next time I will either add more milk or an egg.

These turned out fantastic. I've always made the more traditional 3 ingredient version but this year wanted a little more flavor. This recipe was perfect. The added milk kept them from being dry and made it a little easier to mix. Like another reviewer suggested, combine the sausage and bisquit mix first then add the remaining ingredients. Thanks for this recipe!

I think I have to agree with Christie Leonard-Garcia very bland and doughy. Can not taste the sausage. Would recommend at least doubling the sausage as a starter

Did the recipe exactly!  Loved the flavor...I used the hot  Jimmy Dean sausage.  Will definitely make again. 

However, I think it has WAY too much Bisquick...turned a little to "bread-y" for me.  It was more like a sausage biscuit roll.  I think I'll take out a 1/4 to 1/3 of the Bisquick next time.

Actually, I think they are better re-heated then fresh..the overly "bread-y" texture got better somehow.
