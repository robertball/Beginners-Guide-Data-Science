I adjusted the recipe for  one a 4 oz. Lobster tail yields 6 bite size pieces.  Also added  1 tsp. Old Bay seasoning to the flour mix.  Deep fried using canola oil, turned out wonderful, was not greasy and the lobster was delishessly tender. 
I discovered fried lobster on the east coast, haven't found it since, loved it then now I can love it again.  Thanks for the recipe...

What a great late night snack or anytime. I used Everglades and Louisiana seasoning in place of recipe spices. My teenagers loved it! Try it you'll like it.

My family really enjoyed this as an appetizer.  We served it with butter and lemon.  We will make it again!

This was great. I made a Parmesan cheese sauce with flour, butter, chicken stock, and parsley to go with it. I also made homemade waffles with it for a Sunday breakfast. Delicious!

Didn't add the celery seed  or paprika I also used self rising flour. My family loved it they flew off the plate! Delicious and tasty!
