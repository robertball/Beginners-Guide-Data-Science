I made this when the Philly cooking creams were first advertised- delish! It's now a go-to meal in our dinner rotation.

So I used this as a base recipe.  It's hard to rate based on so many changes.  So my rating is based on my changes.  I sauteed up 1/2 cup onions, 4 cloves of garlic...added the red pepper and broccoli.  Then I put in regular cream cheese (store didn't have cooking creme) and added about 1/2 cup organic free range chicken broth. Added salt and pepper to taste as well as onion powder, garlic salt, and Italian seasoning. I used Capellini noodles as I couldn't find vermicelli. I also cooked my chicken strips separate in the oven.  So all in all it turned out pretty good.  Family was happy.

I used plain cream cheese, and added more pasta water.  Came out great!

Can't find the Philly cheese in our area. Substituted veggie cream cheese and heavy cream but not what I was looking for.
