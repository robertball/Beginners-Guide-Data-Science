This was superb!!!  Thanks so much for this recipe.  Out of necessity, I had to use 5 chicken thighs that I poached beforehand.  Added a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes and kept the thighs whole. Added the broth from the poached chicken as needed, and salt. Since I prefer food with substance, didn't blend and added some fresh green beans.  This was absolutely wonderful.  Not one spice overpowers the other one.  I did add 3 cloves garlic but again, I'm a garlicholic.  You can taste the individual spices and they add different levels of flavor to the dish.  Wow!  again, a great new Indian recipe for us Indian food lovers!  Served w/"Indian Style Basmati Rice" from Allrecipes.

Excellent with basmati rice and naan bread!
I used a 28oz can of whole peeled tomatoes. Tossed them in the blender with the onion mixture and added some of the juice from the can to help thin it down.

It was pretty good after a few minor changes. First, I added salt, since the recipe didn't call for any. Then, I found it to be a little too tomatoey, and spicey, so I added about a cup of plain yogourt, which did the trick. Also, when pureeing it, I would advise you to puree the onions and cumin first, cuz the cumin seeds stay whole if pureeing with the tomatoes. 
Also, I used beef pieces(for stir fry), and sauteed them a bit in the pan before adding the rest. It came out really good. I loved the flavor of the spices together. Served with basmati rice.

The flavors don't blend very nicely.  Tastes like chicken in tomato sauce.  Try the Tikka Masala recipe, it's much better.

Never knew how to make curry, and I didn't realize how easy it actually was.  I threw mine together using a 15oz can of diced tomatoes and used 3 cloves of garlic instead of one.  I too, like another reviewer, am a garlicaholic.  I actually had a blender handy and pureed it real quick, and it turned out great!   I threw it on top of some whole grain rice and it made a great meal.  Also, when it says simmer gently, Iâ€™d recommend placing a lid partway over it.  The sauce is thick making the bubbles bigger causing it to splatter a bit.

I like the spiciness of this recipe and its authenticity.  Instead of using fresh tomatoes, I used two cans of diced tomatoes (no salt added) and skipped the pureeing.  Made it much simpler, and I preferred the consistency. I also appreciate that this is a low-fat meal.  Not having to brown the chicken is a plus.

This dish tasted good but I think it needed more spices, maybe more garam masala. It tasted a little too close to spaghetti sauce. But we still enjoyed it.
Changes: I used 1 large onion, 2 14-oz. cans of diced tomatoes, and added mixed vegetables to it at the end. I'll probably make it again but with more spices.

Was craving something South Asian, but easy, which I think is hard to find.  This was perfect and simple to make. I didn't use a blender cause I'm lazy, and as long as you don't mind chunky it was still good. Only problem was it wasn't spicy enough for me.  I'll probably change that next time.

Easy to make, but not quite what I've come to expect from "authentic" Indian food. I felt it was missing something, but couldn't quite put my finger on what. It's a good place to start, but needs a little tweaking . . .

I am a cook of not much experience but I found this easy to follow and the results were fantastic. Improvised with a couple of the ingredients and added in potatos to it also due to personal taste and it came out great.

Awesome dish!! I love curry but live in a house full of more traditional eaters.  Made the recipe as stated with the only change being I used canned peeled whole tomatoes instead of fresh.  Everyone even my 12 year old grandson ate it up.   This is a keeper !!!!

Not too bad but not fantastic either. I found it a little thin in terms of overall flavour and the consistency of the gravy.

Really good curry. I made this vegetarian and served it over brown rice. It was healthy and good tasting. I had alot of leftover sauce so i used it the next day, added some chicken broth and made a soup out of it. It tunred out great. All things considered this was a really great recipe!

outstanding dish. Simple to make and tastes like it took alot of effort. The only thing different I did was to add already grilled and diced chicken that I keep in my freezer for quick fixes. I also will not use the cayenne pepper next time (as it is NOT kid friendly)only a small pinch at most.

Not that great... I live in London mind you and am used to awesome curries. It was too spicy and rather flavourless for my liking. I will keep looking.

Yummy over rice! Like a lot of you I used canned tomatoes and did not blend. My husband doesn't like spicy food and he liked it. Healthy too! :)

Wonderful recipe! I've made it twice now - first with chicken then again with stew beef. I did add a bit of salt but that was the only change I felt I needed. Thank you!

This recipe is good but lack one thing and that is 'yogurt'. I added half cup of yogurt and half teaspoon of coriander powder, almost doubled the quantity of garam masala and used thighs instead of boneless chicken. Turned nice!

We really enjoyed the dish.  Just made a couple of tweaks.  Added a tablespoon of sugar to break down the acidity a little, and added 1/2 cup plain yogurt after seeing a previous review, thought it was a good idea.  Served over Basmati rice.  My husband is on a low sodium diet, so finding flavorful recipes he likes is hard. This one was a winner, I would definitely make this again!

Strangely, I made this experimenting with Indian spices before I had the recipe (except I threw in some kidney beans).  The fresh ginger, garlic and other spices are wonderful - don't even think about using powdered ginger.  However, canned tomatoes (I used fire roasted) work nicely.  The whole family was really happy with this, and it was a great change from our usual fare, without running up the budget.

Very, very bland and not very tasty at all.  I followed the recipe to the letter, but it was missing something and did not taste like curry.  The spice was nice, but that is about it.  Both my husband and I tried adding all kinds of other typical curry spices, but nothing could save this dish.  Although bland and not that great, I still ate it.  My husband, on the other hand, would not take more than a few bites.  We were both very disappointed.

Very tasty!  I prepared with lamb cubes, and did it in a slow cooker on low for 8 hours.  Was delicious!  I upped the cayenne and garam masala a little.  Next time will try on the stove, but I was worried about overdoing the lamb.

Very easy to make. I will use less cayenne next time. It is spicey. I used coconut juice instead of water. Very yummy! I serve mine over broccoli or spinach with paneer cheese.

Very, very good!!   I also chose not to blend the ingredients.    Think I like it better as I can not envision blending making the dish better.   Used a large can on diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  Served over brown rice.   Also served chickpea curry (found on this site) as a side.   Will definitely make again and again.

I found this watery and kind of boring. I wound up trying to thicken it with a cornstarch slurry to get it to turn the corner from "juice" into "sauce", but it never quite got there, and I needed to add quite a bit more spices to get it to taste like anything other than the cayenne heat. My hubby said it was good, but I think he was just being nice. Probably not making this one again.

Very good but replace The cumin seed with cumin powder for texture, also add 1.5 tsp coriander.

I liked it. I still think it needs more flavors. I can taste most of the flavors on the back of my tongue (the bitterness), but there is some lacking of Indian flavor and aroma that I can't figure out. I am not an expert in the kitchen, but I have tasted Indian food. However, I liked it if in fact it was passed from an Indian grandma. Authentic food from homes always taste a little different from what we eat in restaurants. I added some salt. There is not much need to cut the onions and tomatoes in little pieces because they'll be blended anyway. 1 pound chicken is not much chicken. I added 1.5 pounds and still it wasn't much. Also, I'll give it more time to cook. 20 minutes is not enough for the chicken to cook well and to suck the flavors. I think I cooked it for 30 to 40 mins. it also gives time for the tomatoes to liberate the water.

This was fantasic, very very flavorful. Only change I made was that I didn't use the chicken.

A wonderful balance of flavors and very easy to make.  My husband cnat tolerate very hot foods, so it turned out a bit too spicey for him (perfect for me), but I added some yogurt to the sauce and that worked perfectly to cut down the heat.

Excellant flavor.  Didn't blend the ingrediants like the recipe said to.  I felt lazy that day.  I think I will next time.
