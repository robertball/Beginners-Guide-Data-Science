The cardamom adds so much depth to this otherwise simple recipe.  I made them for our "fancy" christmas dinner and everyone raved (even the little ones)!  I skipped the fried shallots and instead put the potatoes into a caserole dish and sprinkled with brown sugar.  Then put it under the broiler until the brown sugar was crispy.

These potatoes were incredibly easy. I was so grateful I didn't have to peel them, and once they were baked the rest was a snap. They got rave reviews from my family. Best of all, they didn't need added sugar or syrup, so our diabetics didn't have to compensate for it. The cardamom gave it interesting flavor and the fried shallots were a nice complement. It was a terrific addition to our Thanksgiving meal.

VERY tasty recipe, I love the cardamom with the sweet potatoes.  I made this for Thanksgiving last year and it went fast, I am looking forward to having it again this year!

You can even leave the butter out and it's just fine.

These were quite tasty. I like the flavor of sweet potatoes (and they're good for you!), but I am NOT a fan of the whole marshmallow/brown sugar thing. I also didn't have shallots but used mild red onion in its place, which was okay, though next time I would chop it rather than slice it in rings.

I liked the combination of flavors in this recipe. I am a fan of cardamon. However, I would simply fork mash the Sweets next time to give them a little more texture.

These are fantastic! I didn't whip them, just used a masher. Everyone loved them and the deep fried shallots are a winner. These will become part of the rotation. Simple, different and oh so savoury.

These weren't bad.  I love sweet potatoes and love, love, love cardamom, and while they went nicely together, there was a little too much cardamom and my husband kept saying they tasted dessert-y.  Also, for texture and ease, I just mashed the potatoes with a fork since they were incredibly soft after roasting.  When you try these, cut back on the cardamom, but just by a pinch or so.

This was extremely good.  The cardamom gave it just enough extra flavor that really made these not just simple to make, but really made it look like I had gone to more trouble than I had. I even pulled about half of the mixture and put it into a casserole dish and topped with marshmallows, because we had never tried sweet potatoes with marshmallows.  Well, it was this one that was gone before the "plain" mashed ones!  I recommend this recipe for anyone who loves sweet potatoes, it gives it some uniqueness but leaves what you love about them in tact.

this was not a hit at our Christmas dinner.  We do not usually do the marshmallow candied yam thing, so I thought this would be good-not too sweet but still traditional.  Nobody really ate it, not even my mom who loves sweet potatoes and cardomom, just not together apparently.

The idea of combining sweet potatoes and cardamom is great. I didn't have onions or shallots so I skipped that step. But I did add 4 tbsp of brown sugar to the mix. Then salted lightly to taste (not needed if using salted butter) and skipped the pepper. I also added a little extra cardamom because I wanted to strengthen that flavor since it makes the whole dish special. Definitely roast the potatoes in the oven because IMHO that adds more flavor. Consider letting the potatoes cool until lukewarm because then you can just remove the skins by hand. Some reviewers did not like this whipped but that's just a personal preference. I thought the smooth texture was super.

I *loved* this recipe. The cardamom flavor went amazingly well with the sweet potatos. I used garnet yams and also skipped the shallots all together. The only downside was they were a bit too thick. Next time I will add some milk to make them creamier.

This recipe is excellent!  The shallots on top, while not essential, do add a really interesting taste.  I also have made them with the durkee onion topping (like used on a green bean casserole), which was also well received.  I'd never thought of using cardamon this way, but really like it.

I really dislike all the sweetened sweet potato recipes,with brown and/or white sugar, marshmallows (a particular dislike!), honey, maple syrup, etc.  Sweet potatoes are already sweet!, and don't deserve to be made into candy!  This is a fine alternative.  I suspect it would work well with winter squash, too.

rather than ground cardamom, i crushed some pods and infused these with the butter over a low heat for 15-20 mins, which i strained just before use and added a little honey to accentuate the sweetness.. 5 star!!

Heaven.  I didn't whip the sweet potatoes, really no need.  The butter makes it very yummy but if you're watching fats then it can easily do with less.  It would still taste fine.  The shallots are great, but carmelized onions would work if you can't find shallots.  I spent a lot for shallots at a specialty store and it really wasn't any different than onions.

I know this sounds crazy but I've perhaps eaten sweet potatoes only in pie - which is mostly eggs, butter, and sugar.   I've resolved to eating whole, un-processed foods this new year. And I will now be buying shallots and sweet potatoes in bulk because this was soooo delicious. Now I can proudly say I love sweet potatoes, and not just in pie.

I liked this very much since it is a bit different than the traditional sweet potato recipes. I did not try the shallots, as they are not popular down south.

I made this recipe with the canned fried onion bits on top that people often use on green bean casserole, instead of shallots, because one of my kids has a huge aversion to onions but will eat those canned things.  Excellent even with that substitution.  Someday I will make them following the recipe more exactly, too.  Truth be told, the cardamom is an excellent addition to the mashed sweet potatoes and they would make a fine side dish even without any onions at all. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is a great recipe for sweet potatoes.  Simple yet delicious. We just tried it yesterday for our Thanksgiving dinner and all our guests loved it!  The cardamom taste is amazing and adds a unique flavor to it.  We mixed sweet potatoes with yams which gave us a nice mix of colors (yellow and orange).  We will definitely be making this one again!

This is a really sophisticated and easy way to dress up sweet potatoes, especially for those of us who don't like the gooey sweet marshmallowed variety.  Even without the fried shallots, this is a tasty dish full of beta carotene!

I can't believe this doesn't have more reviews! Using cardamom is a great alternative to other overly sugary sweet potato recipes. The first time I made this, the only thing I did differently was sauteing the shallots in butter instead of frying in oil. The shallots turned grey! The next time I added a splash of lemon juice to the shallots to correct the color after turning them. (The acidity will keep them from becoming grey.) I doubled the amount of ground cardamom and it was wonderful. The family loved it, so It's a keeper!

First, it was extremely difficult to fry the shallots without burning them. More importantly the cardamom could be cut in half as the flavor was very intense after baking. We ended up adding a crust to the top with brown sugar and crushed almonds since the recipe alone lacked some depth in flavor.

omg!  So deelish! It's so simple yet the flavor is out of this world.  Cardamom is expensive but well worth it!  I love how I didn't have to peel the sweet potatoes too.  I used some Smart balance instead of butter to save a few calories and it was AWESOME!  This will be my go-to recipe for Thanksgiving and Xmas!

Excellent potatoes, I really enjoyed the cardamom, which takes a simple dish to the next level. I didn't whip the potatoes, I just mashed them up with a fork. I used cayenne pepper rather than white pepper, but otherwise I stuck to the recipe.  The fried shallots are the perfect finish. Thanks for sharing!

Love a savory sweet potato dish, and this one is popular with my family as well.  Cardamom is a favorite flavor--thanks so much for the recipe!

Very good - interesting flavor.  I think I like the cardamom better than cinnamon.  I skipped the scallions; I'll try that next time.

An excellent alternative to the traditional, overly sugared sweet potato recipes you usually see (especially for the holidays).  The cardamom adds an interesting flavor and you can really taste the sweet potatoes.  I made most of this ahead of time for Christmas dinner, reheated the potatoes in the oven and then fried the shallots to add  right before we sat down - a huge time saver!  Next time I will try "mashing" the potatoes in the food processor to get them extra creamy.

I prepared this for Tday and it was delicious. I actually made it the day before which worked out well. Every year I forget the diff between yams and sweet potatoes but now I know that the orange/red ones are the way to go. I had made sweet potato pie so I really didn't want a syrupy marmellowy side dish.  This did the trick.  It reminded me of the sweet potatoes I used to get at an upscale restaurant.  I think I overcooked my shallots but they were still good.  I served them on the side because I figured the kids wouldn't want them (I was correct).  Thanks for the yummy recipe.  I'll be making them again.
