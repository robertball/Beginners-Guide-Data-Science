These are delishious, however, instead of making them with bread, I make them with crescent rolls.  Every one loves them this way.  Do not roll the crescent rolls out though,  Then are great just the way they come outof the package.

We had these with a bowl of soup for lunch today, and they were yummy.  I had really thin spears, so I quickly blanched them until they just started to get tender, and then plunged them into a bowl of ice water.  After you've rolled them up, they bake for about ten minutes, so be careful not to initially cook the asparagus to mush.  Ours had the perfect "crunch" that we like in fresh asparagus.  I could see adding some parmesan to the cream cheese mixture to enhance flavor even more.  Cut in half, these would be great appetizers/finger food for a buffet table.  We're trying to enjoy as much spring asparagus as we can because it's so flavorful and fresh this time of year.  Very nice recipe.

I had some asparagus left over, so I made these roll ups tonight to go along with my Cream of Pimiento Soup. I like them because they are different. They would also be great for a tea party, a ladies' luncheon, or a shower. If I made them for a shower, I would lay the asparagus so that a tip was on each end. Then I would cut them in half.

I have to admit I was surprised at what a hit this was too! LOL   I confess I did not stick to to the recipe, but used the foundation, which was clearly solid, thus the 5 stars.

My version also let the cream cheese come to approximately room temp, which was liberally, not generously, spread on the thinned, decrusted bread slices (wheat). Sprinkle with minced green onions and a light sprinkle of hot pepper flakes. Followed by a generous sprinkle of grated parm/reggiano cheese. Then a half slice of Boars Head Rosemary Deli Ham, you can get away with a quarter of a slice, but my hubby insisted on half a slice for a little extra. Topped by blanched, iced asparagus, roll, and brushed with butter flavored with roasted garlic (minced garlic roasted in butter, then strain out the minced garlic pieces). Done! 

Very easy and quick. Get the prep work is done, then this can be done in line process and put in the oven. I did cut the final product in half to make more like finger food and to stretch out servings. This was the 2nd quickest hor devour to go, was beat out by a very good stuffed cohog. I got compliments from everyone, one person insisted I make this for their party when we come.    

We had left overs, I made more the next day as our lunch.

Recipe Group Selection:  29, March 2014 ~ Delicious! I knew before making these, that I would love them.  It has all the ingredients that I like.  I didn't have chives, but did have thin green onions.  I just chopped up the entire onion and added it to the cream cheese.  These were great hot, but also very good at room temperature.  This would be an easy finger food for a crowd.  Thanks, luckoftheIrish for sharing, I will be making these again!

Made this for Recipe Group...These were good! My asparagus were thin, so they got a bit overcooked, but they were still tasty. I especially liked the bread and cream cheese filling. These were very easy to make and something different...I would probably make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

These are seriously delicious with a few minor changes!  Like they turned out a lot better than I expected.  I used fresh asparagus and boiled it for about two minutes...  Just enough for it to get bright green.  I shocked, drained and dried them VERY well.  I added about two cloves of garlic and some parsley to the cheese mixture.  I was fairly heavy handed with the cheese mixture (blue cheese lovers here).  Def cut down on baking time, I needed about 10 minutes for my test batch.  I honestly was not expecting these to come out so well.  Oh!  And brush with butter, don't dip!  They are plenty rich already.

My family enjoyed this fun twist on asparagus. I felt as though it calls for too much of the cream cheese filling. It's a bit overpowering. I will definitely make this again, but with less cream cheese filling.

Terrific; no deviations from the recipe.  My mom ate more of these than I've seen her eat in TOTAL at any other family meal :) I had to whip up some more so we could have any!

YEEHAW!!!    WE LOVED THESE!  SINCE THERE IS JUST THE 2 OF US, I CUT THE RECIPE IN HALF...I SHOULD HAVE MADE THE ORIGINAL RECIPE OF 12 SERVINGS!!!  WE ATE THEM ALL & WANTED MORE!   I MADE ONE CHANGE...WE LOVE FRESH GROUND BLACK PEPPER; SO AFTER SPREADING THE CREAM CHEESE MIXTURE ON THE BREAD, I PUT SEVERAL "CRANKS" OF FRESH GROUND PEPPER ON THEM, THEN COMPLETED THE RECIPE.   I SERVED THEM AS A SIDE DISH WITH GRILLED RIBEYE STEAKS & FRESH SLICED TOMATOES.  THANK YOU FOR THIS WONDERFUL RECIPE!

Delicious!  I loved the crunchy toast—I used butter bread—and the buttery asparagus. I found them too filling when I slathered on the cream cheese, so I cut back a bit. I also tried making them with puff pastry (my first time working with this) but I liked the toast better. However, using the extra cream cheese mixture in little puff pastry pockets was a happy little result of the experiment!
This will be a perfect dish to take to a shower or ladies group. Thanks for sharing!

This looks just so yummy but I haven't made it yet. I think there needs to be some clarification on the Parmesan. It says "divided," but it's unclear when only using 1-1/2 teaspoons to sprinkle on top before baking.  Assuming the remaining goes into the cream cheese mixture before spreading??

Love this recipe. Guests always ask for the recipe and are surprised at how easy it is. Blue cheese is a good addition.

Made this because asparagus was only $1.99 a bunch. I heated the asparagus spears in the microwave for 2 minutes in a glass tray and plunged in ice water. Superb color. I used seedless rye bread because it was heartier. After flattening  I spread bread with cream cheese and sprinkled with freeze-dried chives (I felt mixing cream cheese with chives was not needed). Didn't have bacon, but I used ham slices and gruyere  cheese to wrap asparagus. I followed the rest of the recipe. Came out great! Served with chicken noodle soup (no chicken, just broth, noodles, mushrooms, carrots and peas. Great dinner--will make again!

Only modified a couple things and have a recommendation:
*used egg bread instead of white
*used 7 strips of bacon instead of 6  (who couldn't use more bacon, right?). 
*used might cream cheese
* keep rolls separated on cookie sheet - don't let them touch, so he bread on edges can crisp 
* broiled quickly right before serving 
Everyone who had them at my very first serving demanded the recipe!

It was messy to make but turned out really good.  I used crescent rolls and pre-marinated asparagus.  After years of making the same Christmas dinner, it was a nice change.

Since the asparagus I used was very thin, I blanched it for only 30 seconds and then the ice bath. My frustrations were that the bread kept ripping while trying to roll them up.  Also, after 12 minutes in the oven they were not browning up, so I turned the broiler on for a minute. They were very good, but very time-consuming.

I did the croissant version and it turned out very well.  This was an incredibly easy recipe on the fly. I made it because my husband will actually eat asparagus,  plus he loves bacon, and tolerates  cream cheese! Anyway, the only thing I did different was  I used shredded parmesan cheese, and I cut the asparagus into 4 pieces when I rolled them up in the croissant, (so as not to make it look too much like a green veggie that someone would have to eat :) It was very good, even heats up in the microwave for about 10 - 15 sec., as a leftover .  Will definately be making these again.

Great idea for a side dish!  I used crescent rolls instead of bread, but otherwise followed the recipe.  They were delicious!

I made these for Easter dinner, and they looked so beautiful when they were done!  I used Brownberry buttermilk bread because plain white bread seemed too plain.  I also used slightly more butter to coat them, just to make sure each wrap would brown, and I used parmesan-reggiano cheese because I had it already for another recipe.  I think the only thing I would change next time would be to maybe double the recipe for the cream cheese/bacon/chive filling because it spread a little too thin for my tastes, but it also didn't overwhelm the overall flavor, so that was good.  My mother-in-law loved these, and she's a great cook, so that's the best compliment.  :-)

I was surprised that I didn't like this.  May be a good way to get kids to eat asparagus.  Most likely won't make again.
