I took this to an Open House party on Christmas and it was a big hit.  The only addition I made to it was that I sprinkled extra Parmesan Cheese on top before baking.  Will be making this again soon!

Made this for Recipe Group...We loved this! I added a bit less salt and pepper and used Hellmann's light mayo, but those were my only changes. Very tasty! I will be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made for Recipe Group. This is good, almost too spicy from the jalapenos and I cut it in half. Thanks for the recipe!

This was good, but I made a couple tweaks to it the second time, which suited my taste better.  The first time, I used the suggested teaspoon of salt which was way too salty for my taste, given the salty flavor already in the cheese.  I cut it down to just a pinch.  I also used 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/4 cup of sour cream.  I don't know if that really did anything to the flavor, but it seemed less heavy to me.  Otherwise, this was great!

THIS IS GOOD STUFF!! -- I made this the first time exactly as written.  I've made it several more times since.  based on the suggestion from TribecaChef, who submitted the recipe, I've sub'd canned green chilis for jalapenos.  I've also combined the  jalapenos & green chilis together. once I garnished it with a healthy dose of cayenne instead of paprika (about 4 pinches instead of 2).  This can be made as hot or mild as you want without taking away from the flavor & texture of TribecaChef's original recipe.  I shop at a local family owned grocery store that has an artisan bakery.  They make a jalapeno sourdough bread that is fantastic!  This dip & this bread are perfect together. -- I almost forgot, I did "tweak" it.  I don't add the salt because I think the cheese & mayo gives the perfect amount of saltiness, but that's just my personal preference - the additional salt may be perfect for many others.

Delicious!  I will half the jalapeños next time.  It was a little spicy for some folks.  Fast & easy to prepare.

This is good. When I make it again I will add more jalapenos. Thank you TribecaChef.

Recipe Group Selection:  22, December 2012 ~ I didn’t get this recipe made during the week of its selection, but still wanted to make and review.  Boy, am I glad I did.  I made a half batch to take to game night using jalapeños in half the dish and without in the other half.  I really enjoyed the jalapeño portion.  Everyone enjoyed this and I will be making it again for Super Bowl Sunday.  Thanks TribecaChef for sharing, this is a very good artichoke recipe.
