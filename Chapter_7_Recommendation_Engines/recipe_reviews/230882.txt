Made this soup mostly to directions. I added a 2nd potato cut into very small cubes and steamed. Left some of the broccoli on the side to.add later along with the steamed potato; this added a heartiness that a completely pureed soup lacks. Other than that, everything else was to recipe and this is definitely a keeper! Very tasty and rich. Will be making this often in the future!

This was pretty good, I did use half and half what I had and it did come out nice and creamy, very filling so I had it as dinner.

This soup is delicious and easy to make. Put a bowl of shredded cheddar on the table to sprinkle on top. I cooked the flour in the butter for 1 or 2 minutes to ensure there was no floury taste to the thickening mixture. Thanks!

I have some issues with recipes as written. 8-10 mins is way too long to sauté onions, but more importantly you never cook garlic as long as onions, or garlic turns bitter. Garlic only needs about 2-3 minutes. I added shredded carrots and sautéed celery with onions. Much needed flavor. Other than that this is a decent base recipe. I always use instant potato flakes to thicken gravies and cream based soups. Healthier, gluten, free and simpler!

I am not a great cook and this recipe was easy to follow and turned out wonderfully! Probably the best broccoli soup I've tasted! Thank you! 

Changes I made: I removed the broccoli and potatoes after step 2 and ran them through the food processor to chop, did not completely puree. I used half and half because that's what I had in the fridge. Added a cup or so of shredded cheddar cheese at the very end.

Delicious just as written!!  I don't feel like it's needs the whipping cream though, the flour mixture thickens up really nicely with just milk or light cream.  I couldn't resist throwing some shredded cheddar into each bowl but it's not needed!  Thanks!

Turned out great even with these changes: halved the onion qty and doubled the garlic qty; only used one tiny potato, but added few stalks of celery (added crunch!); used my own veggie stock from prev. cooked collard greens; didn't have milk so used water to soften the roux; only used half cup of whipping cream; then topped with red pepper flakes...yummy!  I think my hubby will add shredded cheese. thx, it's a keeper!

I tried it like the recipe says the first time and it got 5 stars, but the second time I shredded two potatoes, left out the whipping cream and changed the milk to evaporated milk.  I left the garlic out and I added some tiny  bits of steamed broccoli to the soup after it was done. I'm cooking for the really elderly and they gave it five stars, too.

I made this for my 90 year old mom because she likes cream of broccoli soup.  I always said "I don't care for creamed soups" but this one has changed that statement. I really enjoyed this soup and my mom loved it! So glad I tried it, now I have another great soup to add to my recipe box.

This is excellent. I added 1chopped carrot and 1 stalk chopped celery with butter. Also added a handful of shredded cheddar at the end. I mashed it in the pot with a hand masher as we like pieces in our soup. Will definitely make again.

This is delicious!  The only tweaks I made were to use an entire (4C) carton of chicken stock and since I was using frozen broccoli, I poured the entire bag in at once and simply simmered a little longer to soften before blending.  I also couldn't resist adding a handful of shredded cheddar at the end.  Great soup w/minimal effort!  THANKS for the recipe, BRITTLEY47!

I used what I had in the fridge. I used 1 TBS olive oil and about 3/4 TBS butter. I substituted 3 Leeks,(White part only), for the onion and  I only used 2 cloves of Garlic. I added 2 chopped Carrots, and used 3 Red Potatoes. I didn't think that there was enough liquid so I substituted 3 cans of Turkey Broth instead of only 3 cups.  I did use an immersion blender and gently chopped the mixture leaving some larger pieces. To thicken the mixture, I used 3 TBS instant potato flakes, and 12 oz. whole milk. This makes 5 Two cup servings. Top with low fat Sharp Cheddar Cheese and you have a relatively low fat and tasty dinner.

Great soup. Nice and thick. Added a couple of cups of shredded cheddar to the milk and cream mixture. How can you go wrong with broccoli and cheese! Yum!just made it again. This time I added a couple of cups of diced cooked ham. Even better.

We love cream of broccoli soup, but the best recipes seem to have a LOT of cheese. This recipe with the potatoes did not need the cheese for flavor. Freezes really well. I  did add carrots to mine and used 2 cups lowfat milk instead of cream, delicious

This soup recipe is very delicious if you change a couple of things. For one, I always make this soup doubled the recipe because everyone in my mouth devours it. All of the changes I make are based on doubled recipe. Now, for my changes.

I don't chop the onion nor mince the garlic. I quarter the onion and keep the garlic whole, maybe slightly smashed. That way, the 8-10 minute cook time on them gives the onion a nice translucent look and a pretty light browning on the garlic. You may also want to trt stirring a lot more often because in some cases, the onion and garlic are finished a bit earlier. I increase the amount of potatoes to about 4 large ones or maybe 8 small and decrease the amount of broccoli to maybe 4 or 6 cups (I don't measure them.) I also use salt free chicken stock to control the salt content. 

Once everything cooks, I use a blender  instead of an immersion blender wand. With light blending and the smooth simmered garlic, the taste is the best, especially if you can control the seasoning to your tastes. The milk and cream sauce can stay the same, with very light seasoning so you can adjust the taste at the end.

Very delicious, thank-you for sharing this amazing dish with us.

The family loved this soup!  I doubled the recipe.  Also, I added chunks of ham, 1 TBL of Italian seasoning, 1 TBL of fresh parsley.  It called for 1 potato, but I added 2 potatoes.

I added a ham bone but pretty much stuck to the recipe otherwise. My 4 and 5 year old grandkids ate it and asked for more. It's that good!

Made it the first time with the little creamer potatoes from Costco without the broccoli stems, and it was very good.  Made it the second time with a regular potatoe and the broccoli stems, but I thought it had more of a woodsy taste.
Made it the third time with the creamer potatoes and the broccoli stems, and that was the winner.  Used my Vitamixer to do the emulsifying.   Froze some for later.

Excellent. I skipped the cream, just whole milk was way creamy enough for me. Used more potato and Better Than Bouillion; Vegetable Base  instead of broth and Penzy's Sandwich Sprinkle, topped with grated cheddar. Why buy canned soup?

Very good! I used a bit less cream (3/4 cup) and added some blue cheese crumbles. Also used vegetable broth for our vegetarian household. Super tasty!
