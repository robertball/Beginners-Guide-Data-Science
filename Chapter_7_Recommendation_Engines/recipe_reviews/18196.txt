The cooking time on this one was way off--would not suggest tryign this one.  Lemon Sponge Pie 1 on this site is a much better recipe--came out perfectly and tested excellent.

bland flavor, cooking time is way too short, came out runny and pretty much inedible.

Mine came out runny as well, and needd to be cooked for a long time.  I changed the recipe by adding more lemon, more egg whites, and more flour.  It baked up much better.  As it currently stands, the recipe won't work quite right.
