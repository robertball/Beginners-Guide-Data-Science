I made this for New Years exactly as the recipe stated and it came out delicious!   When people start changing things in a recipe, it's no longer the recipe stated...it then becomes their own recipe.  Make it according to directions and you won't have any problems.  It was yummy and I will definitely make it again.

I made it this morning, with some changes, and everyone loved it including my 2 young boys.  I didn't have frozen cranberries, so I used 1 cup craisins (mixed half in the batter, half for the topping)--I would NOT use 3 cups--too much.  No pecans. Substituted brown sugar for the first cup of white sugar to mix with the craisins for the topping.  I also didn't make it "upside down" so I added half the batter, then a layer of topping, then layered the rest of the batter and topping.

This recipe was reprinted in the St. Petersburg Times and as soon as I saw that it was taken from Allrecipes.com, I looked it up online. First of all, this is a very simple cake that can be quickly made by a beginner cook - great for last minute. I followed the recipe as written, but used one bag of Ocean Spray fresh cranberries. I lined a 2 quart rectangular Pyrex baking dish with parchment paper so that it would release easily. I baked the cake for 50 minutes since at 45, a toothpick did not come out clean. I let the cake sit for about 20 minutes before turning out onto a plate and the parchment did the trick - it had no problem releasing from the pan. The appearance of the cake is great. Since it is tart from the cranberries and not really sweet, I would recommend serving it a little warm with vanilla ice cream. This is a cake that I will make again. Next time I will use an angel food or bundt type pan for a better presentation.

I took this to my church Christmas party and the pastor kept telling people not to eat it so he could take it home. I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon to cake batter. I  piped whipped cream in a lattice pattern on top as one edge stuck in the dish when I flipped it. Hid the crack very well.

I halved the recipe for this, since I only had a 1 quart baking dish. Turned out delicious, but it didn't survive being turned upside down. :c I feel it could use a little more batter.

I had fresh cranberry, and it came out great.  After reading other reviews, I didn't try to turn it over.  Instead, I served it like a cobbler.  Hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, it was fantastic.  So much for my diet.

This did not set at all!  I think there is not enough flour in the recipe.  It did taste good and I served it with whipped cream in a bowl more like a trifle.  Would try again but with some adaptations.

Delicious! was a huge hit at my church even with those who don't like cranberries!  I did add 1 tsp of cinnamon to the batter and used half brown sugar instead of all white with the berries and nuts as suggested. Will make again!!

A was a little short on the cranberries, just one package of frozen but was still excellent.  I think I would toast the pecans a bit first next time. Used a 9 x 13 pan

i love this recipe!  The right contrast between sweet and tart, and the batter evens everything out.  Excellent with a little whipped cream, too.  
Easy to make, but don't forget that 1st cup of sugar with the pecan and cranberry mix.  I did that once and had to add a karo syrup, white sugar, butter concoction on top to drizzle down into the cake.  Still good, but much better when you follow the recipe!
