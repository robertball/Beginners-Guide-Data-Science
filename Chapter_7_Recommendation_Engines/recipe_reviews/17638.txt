I made this for our Christmas Eve appetizer spread.  It looked beautiful when it came out of the oven.  We tasted it and it was terrific, I couldn't wait to sit down and enjoy.  By the time we did, it had gotten cold, so I microwaved it for about 24 seconds.  DON'T DO THAT!!!  The brie curdled and the oil from the cheese seperated into a messy puddle.  At that point the texture was shot and it was greasy.  It needs to be served and eaten right away, apparently.  I'm sad to say, I had to throw it out!  But it was a terrific recipe, very tasty and easy to make.  It just so happened that I ruined it! Eating it cold would have been a far better option!  :(

Really delicious.  I couldn't find mango chutney, so used apricot preserves mixed with a bit of cinnamon.  The curry adds something very special to the overall flavor of this dish.  One thing:  I baked for almost twice as long to insure that the cheese was gooey and bubbly.  YUM!

WOW!!  I got such compliments for this simple recipe I will certainly make it again and again.  Not only does it look beautiful - it tastes creamy and savory, sweet and nutty all at once.  What a treat!  I had to pass on the recipe to all my dinner guests.  I used pecans instead of cashews and it turned out perfect!

The blend of flavors between the curry powder and the cheese and the chutney were great. An impressive, easy hors d'hoevre.  Scaled to a 1 pound brie it still served 10 people.

I cut the coating off the top of the wheel only so that the softened cheese would not leak out the sides.  This helped to get the flavor of the mango chutney into the cheese.  What a hit for a very cold January day!!

This recipe is just so versatile, as long as you have the combination of sweet and salty and a little spicy you can't really go wrong! My husband doesn't care for the flavor of curry powder, so I left it out. We also have a nut allergy in my family so I couldn't use the cashews. I substituted six slices of bacon, fried until crisp and then crumbled. I put the chutney over the cheese and then sprinkled the bacon over that. I served the baked brie with two kinds of crackers and it got RAVE reviews. Even my husband loved it and he had been very dubious about the recipe when I told him what I was making. I have a family member who is deathly allergic to mangoes, so next time I will make this using cranberry chutney so she can have some too.

This is a fabulous and super-easy appetizer for guests. I served it with wheat thin crackers and it was very yummy. Even those who don't like curry rave about it.

The combination of flavors sounded interesting so I served this as an appetizer to our guests at Thanksgiving.  Didn't get as many rave reviews as when I prepare the brie with sun-dried tomatoes, pesto, crumbled bacon and spring onions, but I thought it was very flavorful and is an alternative for those who don't care for tomatoes or pesto.

Unbelievably easy. I love curry but next time I will use a bit less. It was a bit overpowering. I will also crush the nuts.

I made this to use some of the Mango Chutney (recipe from this site) that I made. It was sooo good. I added chopped pecans instead of cashews and served with sliced french bread and crackers. I left it in the oven another five minutes since it didn't really look any different after I cooked it, but the Brie was definitely melted when we cut into it (I didn't use a 2 pound Brie wheel though, it was 13 oz). My boyfriend loved it.

Amazing recipe - follow it exactly when company is coming... but we also make it once a week for a quick snack - just pop some brie/mango chutney and cashews in the microwave for 10 seconds - yum!

I'd give this more stars if I could!  This was FANTASTIC!  I followed the recipe to a "T" and wouldn't change a thing.  The hot mango chutney complimented the creaminess of the brie perfectly.  This recipe is absolutely a keeper!  Thanks, Hillary - - great recipe.

The flavors in this recipe are fantastic - but I learned from two mistakes.  Like the reviewer who made the mistake of re-warming this in the microwave, I also overheated it in the oven - making it a gooey mess (delicious, but gooey!)  It would be better to UNDERHEAT it since you still want to serve it with the consistency of a soft cheese.  I also will use a little less chutney next time - it was too much as stated.

Made this for Christmas eve & it was a complete hit.  I used a 1 lb brie wheel & adjusted the amount of curry & chutney (used a combo of Major Grey's & mango).  Very, very good & the simple preparation makes it ideal for the busy holidays.

5+ stars. This recipe is amazing. Every time I make it, everyone always asks for the recipe. I usually use more curry powder, covering the entire wheel/wedge of brie, whole cashews and bake it a bit longer (~30min) so it's nice and gooey. Delicious. I usually serve this as an appetizer to 'Curried Honey Mustard Chicken' and 'Curried Pear, Cashew and Spinach Salad' -- two other great recipes from this site. Great meal.

This was FABULOUS!! It was a huge hit at our get-together.  I used a madras curry and candied cashews from Trader Joe's.    Even those who didn't care for brie gobbled this one up!  Leave the white rind on otherwise it will ooze out too much. I made that mistake.  Enjoy this easy recipe!

I hate to be the voice of dissent, but something went horribly wrong here.  I gave this 5 stars as the recipe is inherently good but I think one needs to consider some factors:  1)the size of your brie wheel, 2)the quality of your brie, and 3)the power of your oven.  I bought a very good, very soft brie for this, and it was too small for a whole jar of chutney and 1 cup of cashews, so I downsized on that; however, 15 minutes in the oven was overkill.  I'll try it again for a shorter time, as the flavors go together wonderfully.  Thanks!

I've always wanted to bake a brie, so I chose this recipe...it was great.  Made it for a "girls night in" and we all enjoyed it very much.  I did cut the rind off the top before rubbing in the curry.  It spread out a bit, but the flavor combo was the best!  I will be making this again for sure!

Unique combination of flavors and so easy.  I removed rind on top and side of brie, then coated both with lots of curry powder.  A hit with the ladies of our group.

Yum! So good. I used apricot preserves also and the sweetness with the brie and curry was awesome.

This was wonderful despite the fact that I used a hot mango chutney.  The heat overpowered the creaminess of the brie.  Next time I will use a sweet chutney.

obviously this is something that you can change alot, and still have it turn out. I used a peach chutney that I had made the previous summer, and walnuts (because I had them). Served with whole wheat crackers it was delicious! The only problem was....the rind of our brie tasted "funny" - as I've never had brie before I don't know if this was normal, or just the kind of brie we had. But certainly not the fault of the recipe. :)

This was good. Definitely different. It is one of those appetizers that some will love and others will try and not go back for more. I don’t think I would serve it as the only appetizer, but it is a nice addition to a party that has an appetizer table. The mango chutney was not with the jellies and jams in the grocery store. It was on a whole different isle. You may have to ask where they stock it.

This recipe was a hit at the party I brought it to, however personally the 2.2 lb of brie was WAY to big--that could serve 50 people!  A small wheel is fine for an appetizer.  I did not find it that tasty but every guest raved about the flavors!!

Oh my! This was SO well received at a recent dinner party. I used curry and mango/papaya chutney from Sunny Carribee, a Caribbean spice company with cashews.  A keeper for certain.

Tried this recipe for the first time to take to a party. It was devoured! I'm making it again tonight to take to friends house as an appetizer before dinner. I am making a few adjustments to the recipe for tonight based on fixing it yesterday. I used 1/2 jar of the mango chutney and only about 1/2 cup of chopped cashews. I also found that it needed to bake @ 350 degrees for closer to half an hour for the brie to really soften up & melt. Served it with French baguette slices and also had sliced apples. It was fast, simple & YUMMY!

One word...Amazing! I hosted a dinner party and this dish was the star of the show! I highly recommend this, I must admit at first I was hesitant about the flavors meshing well, but they did and the dish is easy to make. I would give it 10 stars if I could.

I used Camembert instead of Brie (just a personal preference). It was nice except I didn't really like the mango chutney. It wasn't quite sweet enough to balance the flavours. However the texture of the melted cheese and crunchy cashews was lovely.

I omitted the nuts from this b/c of a guest with an allergy, but this went over really well in the taste department; however, it didn't clear out as much as my regular baked brie would, so that's reducing my rating a little.

Loved this and it’s very easy to make. I reduced the recipe for a small Brie round and it adapted perfectly.

This is a great alternative to our traditional maple syrup baked Brie. The flavours are very interesting but it may not appeal to everyone. Five stars from my family though!

This was delicious! Made it for an office potluck (used the toaster oven here) and it baked beautifully. Served it with thinly sliced French baguette and it was gobbled up fast. I used whole cashews instead of chopped and it looked so pretty. Also used peach chutney instead of mango (accidentally grabbed the peach) and it was delish! The combination of flavors (chutney and curry) are fabulous!

I have made this recipe several times now, and it's always a big hit with my guests. Highly recommend following the recipe as is... Though I substitute a wheel if mild Camerbert from time to time.

I've been making this since 2014 when I found it here. Needed to use up some brie & mango chutney & fortunately found this. Every time I make it, there are rave reviews from everyone.

This was a big hit! I brought it to my mom's for Mother's Day and everyone LOVED it. I used a smaller wheel of Brie and served with some leftover focaccia bread. Will make again.

It was a fight to see who got the last bite.  God help me if I don't make enough next time.  It was perfect as is.
Thanks for this keeper!

I'm sorry to say that I was not at all pleased with this recipe.  I took it to a family outing and did not get the usual rave reviews that I usually get when I use recipes from Allrecipes.com.  Maybe it's just not our taste...
