I think this would be a lot better with salt and some seasonings.  It was very bland tasting.

This month Rachel Ray had almost the identical recipe and we just made it - it was ok, I think they need a spicy dip. I give you 4 stars for your creation as it was good enough to get published in the future!

I only give it 4 stars, because there needs to be spices and it wasn't very hot for us. Great crunch and great idea! Be sure to throw in some taco seasonings or however you like your Mexican food!
