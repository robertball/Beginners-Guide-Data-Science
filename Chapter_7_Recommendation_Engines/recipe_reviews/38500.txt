i made this recipe exactly as stated except for the chilling and rolling and cutting because i have no patience. instead i pressed the batter into a baking pan lined with foil and baked for the 15 minutes then topped with mini chocolate chips and marshmallows baked another 6 minutes and under broiler until marshmallows wre toasted. it turned out to be a very delicious and gooey smore's bars. thank you for the great base to my experiment in smore's heaven.

Overall, this recipe is really good.  Make sure you flour your work space and dough well before rolling it out.  Also, the dough seemed easier to work with after it sat out on the counter for a few minutes.  My fondant rolling pin worked best for this dough.  I was able to get it thin enough to resemble a store-bought graham cracker.  I used the smallest size from my biscuit cutter set to make graham rounds, sprinkled them with cinnamon/sugar and baked them for 8 minutes.  They came out perfect.  Once cooled, I scooped a small amount of light whipped topping and made mini sandwiches.  They are a great light snack or guiltless dessert.

I like this one for two reasons.  They are a great snack with a little butter spread on them and they are good for using as graham crumbs.  The only suggestion I have is to age them a couple days before using them.

Excellent.   Tried making graham crackers with another recipe and were very bland and soft, these were tasty and crisp, just like store bought!  Definitely top with cinnamon and sugar.

These are an awesome change from store bought graham crackers. I love the texture that the whole grains add; I used whole grain spelt flour for the whole wheat, and King Arthur's White Whole Wheat for the all purpose. I also added a small sprinkle of cinnamon. I rolled them out on a well floured surface with parchment on top, and baked them on parchment, which worked really well. I cut them out into rounds and got 59 crackers. They're great; not too sweet and very tasty on their own, with a bit of orange curd, or a homemade marshmallow and a couple chocolate chips!

I don't know what a graham cracker is supposed to taste like, for you couldn't find them in Belgium. I found these crackers were a little bit bland when eaten plain. HOWEVER these made the best graham cracker crust(s) I've ever made. I used to make them with McVities Digestive (only whole wheat crackers I was able to find), but the graham cracker crusts are so better with real graham crackers, that I will certainly bake a batch any time I need a cracker crust. Thanks for the recipe. P.S.: I rolled the dough after only 4 hours refrigerating, and it was really ok. Don't forget to put enough flour on the surface you are rolling the cracker dough, though.

Very Good.  Sticky dough so use plenty of flour on your board.  Roll dough paper thin right on what you are going to cook them on.  I used a silicone liner.  Cin and Sugar on top was wonderful!  Husband even wanted them with milk for dessert.

Really good, kids had fun making and eating!  Also an easily handled dough, and edible raw-no eggs.  We even cut out initials and made homemade shapes.

Delicious... crispy and sweet.  I only used whole wheat flour, but was still impressed with this cracker.

This is the best Honey Graham recipe I've found.  I made 2 changes:  I used 1 tsp. cinnamon added to the dough itself (saved adding more sugar to the top).  I've found that a little cinnamon added to whole wheat flour (when it's going to have sugar in it anyway) often helps take the "wild" taste out of it.  I also used 100% whole wheat flour - no white.  It was great, and even better the second day.  A delicious, munchable, mellow graham cracker!  Thank you, Rebecca!

Amazing recipe!!! I live in Australia and you can not buy graham crackers in our grocery stores - thank you for sharing. They turned out perfectly and were yummy for s'mores. I used butter instead of margarine and rolled the dough out between two pieces of baking paper. Thanks again!

These have a slight sweet taste, but are otherwise bland.  (even after I added cinnamon to the recipe).  If my kids try them tomorrow and like them, then I might make them again, otherwise they weren't a winner for me.

Even though I rolled these out very thin, they do not have the texture of graham crackers at all. They tasted fine, I hope it will work for a crust, but I have my doubts.

After reading some reviews, I was worried these would be bland so I added 2 tsp of cinnamon to the flour mixture. I also used butter in place of margarine and 1/4c agave nectar in place of the honey. I did not refrigerate the first batch and it worked just fine. **For rolling EXTRA THIN - cut a piece of parchment paper the size of your cookie sheet and then move the parchment to the counter. Put the dough on the parchment and place a sheet of saran wrap over the top.  You don't even need to touch the dough this way and you don't need any additional flour.  After your dough is rolled very thin, simply put the parchment onto the cookie sheet, pull off the saran wrap and score it with a knife. I sprinkled the tops with white sugar before baking. I believe the key is rolling them as thin as you can. The thicker the cookie, the softer it was and it didn't taste much like a graham cracker.  The thinner cookie with the crisp texture was perfect so I had to play around with the timing to get them just right without burning them. We made smores using these and didn't really care for them although I think they're great all by themselves! All of my kids LOVE them!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome! Made stars, leaves, hearts and also small rectangles cut with a pastry cutter!  My son and I love them!  Also added 3 Tbs. ground flax seed to add nutrients and texture.  Didn't add the cinnamon on top, but plan to next time!

I used 3 C of Gold Medal baking flour and buttered shortening instead of butter -- they came out GREAT.  Instead of putting the dough in the fridge, I just rolled it out between two pieces of wax paper and had no problems AT ALL!  Tip for straight lines (to make rectangles) - use a pizza cutter pressing gently once the rolled-out dough is on the cookie sheet!     I had a long day and needed my comfort food (s'mores) and was sad to find we had no grahams in the pantry.  This recipe saved the day!

i don't think there is anything wrong with the recipe it just doesn't taste anything like graham crackers. not an ounce. i am not sure why. they are okay crackers but thats it. one of my kids ate them the other wouldn't even pretend to enjoy it she ran and spit it in the trash. so in short if you are looking for a graham cracker this would not be my suggestion. but it is a descent cracker if you really like the wole wheat vegan type of flavor.

I added 1 tsp cinnamon. The dough was very easy to make. I rolled mine out on a floured pillowcase (used only in the kitchen) and it was not at all difficult to roll out. I did not use any parchment. I cut the dough into animal shapes using cookie cutters and made graham animal crackers. My daughter loves them.

really nice, especially with the cinnamon sugar (1/4 cup sugar to 1 T cinnamon).  you need to roll these carefully, because the thinner batches cook much faster than the thinner ones.

I was so excited to make my own graham crackers at home and dip them in some cold milk, but these ones turned out really bland and weren't very tasty.  I tried adding the cinnamon and sugar sprinkle on top, but they still seemed like they were missing something.  Next time, I'll skip the effort and just get the HoneyMaid ones.

Pretty good! I was craving for something salty-crunchy and made these. I put in less sugar and a bit more salt. I also added about 1/2 cup of flaxseed for added fiber. Didnt bother to refrigerate and still turned out good. I just pressed everything on a layer of baking sheet and used a blunt knife to cut them into squares before baking.

While these "crackers" are tasty they don't much resemble commercial honey graham crackers in flavor or texture. They are softer and have a stronger whole wheat flavor than commercial crackers. Neither of those qualities is a bad thing! But for bakers looking for a clone recipe, this isn't it.

My first time making graham crackers, and I was pleased with the results. They're nice and not too sweet, would be a great base for ice cream sandwiches or s'mores! There might be a trick to getting the dough rolled thin enough.. mine were maybe 1/4 inch thick after baking.

Amazing, taste just like graham crackers. My husband ate the 1/2 batch I made in an hour. I didn't have milk, so I used water, and they still turned out fine! I also substituted a little of the honey (2 T) for molasses. Roll out thin to get the crispy graham cracker like texture.

I love these.  I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup (and used demera) and added about 3 T ground flax.  I mixed cinnamon and demera and sprinkled it on top.  I rolled them very thin and cut them into squares on a silpat, which I left them on.  They were fabulous!

These came out great! I am so excited because I can now make my own graham cracker crumbs for other recipes, and I love them as is with some peanut butter spread on them. Thanks for this recipe, perfect graham crackers on my first try!

WOW !  Absolutely delish !  My granddaughter even loved them.  I made the recipe exactly as reads & turned out fabulous.  I then proceeded to make another batch without the honey so I know in the future IF I don't have honey one hand.  It turned out just as good !!!  Thanks for this recipe !   :)

This didnt taste anything like the graham crackers you get in the stores.  The texture was way off too.  Besides that, these taste ok.  They tasted kind of doughy even tho they were crisp. Also the dough was much easier to work with when it was at room temp.  Im not sure what to think about these.  They  have there own flavor and there own texture that I can not compare anything too.  They dont even compare to a cookie.  I still ate them and my kids liked them.  These were just ok for me.

Good, wholesome recipe!  I used butter instead of margarine and added 1/2 tsp of salt.  We made them into cookie cutter shapes.  I did NOT chill the dough and it was easy to work with (I used powdered sugar to roll them out in).  They kept their shape very well; the best thickness for these seemed to about 1/8"; baked in about 8 minutes.  Nice for the kids to make since they don't contain eggs!

These turned out absolutely perfect!  I followed the recipe exactly (except I used real butter instead of margarine).  I will be making my own graham crackers from now on with this recipe.  I did put cinnamon sugar on top using the McCormick Cinnamon Sugar grinder.  YUM!

I followed the recipe exactly and these are very yummy. Be sure and watch them closly. Mine were done in 12 minutes and burned in 13!! I may add a sprinkle of sugar on the tops for the next batch. These will work great for smores!

I thought this was a great recipe!! To my amazement they actually tasted like graham crackers.  I cut them into rectangles but also used cookie cutters for some.  If you want them crispy and crunchy make sure they're thin (less than 1/4") or make them a little thicker and they're a great soft cookie texture.  We like them either way.  We store the extras in the freezer to pull out for a yummy snack!

Unfortunately, I didn't like this recipe at all.  They didn't taste like graham crackers and were too buttery for me.  There wasn't much flavor other than "butter" even with cinnamon sugar on top!  However, the dough was quite easy to handle and my friends liked them pretty well, I managed to unload them all on one friend who was perfectly thrilled with them! :o)

These were great!  More of a cookie texture than a cracker but delicious.  They are not like store bought but very unique.  I did sprinkle with a little cinnamon sugar.  I think next time I may try adding flax seed or some sort of nut extract for a little extra flavor.  The dough is very hard to work with but if you aren't too worried about perfectly rectangular crackers its no big deal.  I ate these with mascarpone or cream cheese and also crushed and used for a graham cracker crust.  It was the best pie crust I ever made!  Will definitely make these again.

Flavor was good, not great.  I had to keep adding lots of flour during rolling to keep from sticking and you can only do so many repeat rolls (to use up extra bits) before the batter starts drying out.

Love it! Love it! Love it! All of my kids AND my husband rated these a 10!!! I tried some thin and some a little thicker, will definitely go with a little thicker, just like store bought graham crackers as they soak up milk wonderfully!!! I also did half with cinnamon sugar on top and they couldn't decide which they liked better :)

Taste was great! Had a hard time rolling them out though.  Cut them smaller, so I had about 50-60 small crackers. I sprinkled half with cinnamon-sugar, left half plain; preferred the ones that had the cinnamon-sugar on them.

These were really, really easy to make!  I had tried another recipe before and they didn't turn out at all, but this one worked perfectly.  I actually ended up par-freezing the dough to make it easier to roll out and then baked them for 13 minutes.  At fifteen minutes a few of them burned which was my fault 'cause I wasn't watching them closely enough.  Great with Carnation Instant Breakfast and fruit for lunch or Pastry cream and coffee for dessert! Mmmmmm...

These were SO good coming right out of the oven that they kept disappearing off the cooling rack as fast as I could load the next batch on. After cooling off, they were still good but not quite as good as they were when they were fresh from the oven.  They don't taste identical to store bought graham crackers (although the texture and smell are nearly identical) but they still made a great treat and they were fun to make!

Yum, yum, and yum! I followed the recipe, except that I doubled the vanilla. Next time I may try using only white whole wheat flour. These are delicious. I had a little bit of trouble rolling out the dough and making thin rectangles...so with the rest of the dough, I made them thicker and used cookie cutters. They're yummy when they'e warm and soft too. This a great recipe - definitely a keeper.

Maybe I have to try this again. 

The first attempt yielded cookie like wheat crackers. The ones I didn't sprinkle with cinnamon were kind of bland. Maybe I didn't roll them out thin enough? I rolled them to 1/4 before baking.

AMAZING!   These taste better than storebought! They are not as sweet as storebought so i suggest to sprinkle them with cinnamon sugar or plain sugar before baking if you like them like that, or make them into something like crust. I made MoonPies by sandwiching the cracker rounds with marshmallow fluff and covering them in melted chocolate. (YUM!) I also suggest to take them off the cookie sheet IMMEDIATELY as these will stick very bad. These are sooo good. I would recommend this recipe to everybody.

I made my first batch and they turned out great! I split the dough and added 1/2 cup of cocoa to it. If you try the chocolate ones, I recommend reducing the baking time by about 2 minutes.

A tastey recipe. Like some others, I found dough too sticky to roll even on floured surface so turned to my grandma's method of rolling between 2 sheets of wax paper. That worked well but removing them once rolled thin enough was a challenge. 

On the second batch, I level pressed directly into a parchment paper covered cookie sheet, again covering the top of dough with wax paper while leveling. I'll need to use a larger baking sheet next time as it ended up too thick.

I may also take some other suggestions to reduce the sugar content and add flax meal.

These didn't end up crispy like store bought boxed crackers. They were slightly chewy and tender like a cookie or bread. But honestly the mouthfeel, imo, was superior to store bought crackers. I did use real butter instead of margarine because of food allergies so not sure if they turn out crunchy otherwise. I may have eaten 3 of these right out of the oven and I am sure my children will devour them tomorrow. I made a double batch in order to have extras for cheesecake crusts. Thanks for the amazing recipe! And anyone who said these are bland most likely don't truly appreciate the flavor in whole wheat baked goods. The wheat products the perfect mouthfeel, texture and flavor. Adding sugar, honey, cinnamon or vanilla enhances and gives more depth but these tasted great!

I don't typically write reviews for recipes but the reviews on this recipe were so split I felt I should.


This is a good recipe. It does take some trial and error to find the right bake time, rack position, and thickness for rolling, though. Once you figure it out for your oven settings you can get a graham cracker very similar in flavor and/or texture to a commercial graham cracker. That said...


If you want a uniform crunch like a commercial graham cracker, I found with my oven (fan force on 160°C) I needed to roll it quite thin (1-1.5mm) and bake it a little longer (16-17 minutes) OR cut the squares smaller than tradition cracker size. When you bake them to uniform crunch, however, some of the flavor disappears. I don't know why, but I found that when you baked them so that the middles were a little soft and the edges crispy, it has a flavor JUST like a honey graham cracker from the box in the US. I'm not sure what happens in an extra two minutes of baking or from cutting the squares smaller, but it makes a huge different in flavor. The crunchier they get the more they border on bland, which I saw many commenters remark on. 

If you want to make this recipe I suggest doubling the recipe then experimenting with a few different sizes and baking times til you find one you like best. I live in Australia now and can't get graham crackers for crusts, so I was baking crackers to turn to crumbs. I found that having a mix of all different crunch and flavor was ideal, and made no

Very pleased with this recipe!  The changes were that I used unsalted butter (that's what I had on hand) and added 1/8 tsp salt, plus incorporated about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon into the dough mixture instead of sprinkling it on top.  It was delicious; nice and light to the taste and not too sweet.  Won't need to buy the store bought ones again.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are delicious.  I did not make any changes in the recipe.  I did sprinkle with cinnamon sugar before baking.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Came out great. Kinda tastes like pie crust. I used real butter. I stopped using margarine decades ago.  I thought it would last longer. Got eaten way too fast.

Very bland, not really sweet at all even when sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar..The second batch I added a couple tsp of cinnamon to the dough didn't make much difference...might try more brown sugar and less honey next time as well as cinnamon and nutmeg. Overall mehh.

I wanted to make a healthy cookie cake so that my parents could eat it too, so cut it into my own personal cake shape - It came out crisp but cutable, and tasted great with the strawberry spread! Not only did my parents enjoy it, but even the little ones who are used to sugar parties!

I didn't have any whole wheat flour at my disposal, so I substituted semolina flour and they still turned out very well.

I was also short on brown sugar, so I made some with black strap molasses (which I usually find too strong); I think it helped with the colour. I nerfed the harshness of the molasses with extra honey.

Short on time, I chilled the dough in the freezer for about half an hour, then moved it to the fridge for an hour, and it still rolled out fine. Use loads of flour when rolling. I also recommend the cinnamon sugar topping.

This is a very good, versatile recipe that holds up to all kinds of stopgap substitutions.

I made the dough into round cookies, topped them with a marshmellow, heated to soften marshmellow. Toasted slightly to brown crown. Pushed down on marshmellow and topped with a Hershey piece. Now I have s'mores cookies.

I made this recipe as a base for a s'mores bar and I followed the recipes as it was stated except I didn't end up using all of the flour. I couldn't really taste the honey though, but it was fine since it was a base for s'mores and I don't like them too sweet. I wouldn't recommend eating them by themselves because they do taste a bit bland. Overall, it turned out awesome. Definitely making these again

This made some very tasty cookies, not crispy crunchy graham crackers.   I'm going to try this same recipe next time without the baking powder and soda and see if they don't rise quite so much.
