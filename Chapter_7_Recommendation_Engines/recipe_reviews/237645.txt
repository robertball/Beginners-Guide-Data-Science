This was my first attempt so I didn't change anything. The feta threw me off a bit but it tastes pretty good. I like walnuts and dried cranberries which definitely gives it a nutty and sweet flavor. I would make it again.

Added dried chopped onion, garlic powder and basil to the quinoa as cooking. Mixed all ingredients, 1tbsp of the feta brine and chopped scallion. YUMMY!

This makes a great addition to my lunch box. 1/2 cup is 245 calories. I think I'll try it with apple next week instead of cranberry just to mix things up.

I dried roasted the walnuts in a cast iron skillet and used shredded three cheese, (parmesan, Romano, and asiago) in place of the feta. delish!
