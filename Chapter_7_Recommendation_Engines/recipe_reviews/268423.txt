This was a time consuming recipe to make and had absolutely NO flavor!  My husband asked if it was chicken in the dish - he couldn't tell what it was and was just guessing!!  It was edible after adding some seasonings, including seasoned salt;  but not good.  My husband, who will eat just about anything, was very happy when we finished it!
