Delicious!  Added 1/2 cup parm, mush, two spicy link sausages, used a little more than 1 pint half and half, and 1 pint heavy cream, plus some Creole seasoning and it was heavenly.  Great base recipe.  We're definitely going to make it again.

This receipe is the best Crawfish Pasta recipe I have ever tried.  The best I had ever tried was Semolina's Restaurant in New Orleans.  This blew that away.  Do you guy own a restaurant or something?  If not, you should!!  I would even put up the capital.  Wonderful dish for Valentine's Day romantic dinner too.  Your other recipes are awesome too.

I like my food spicy so I used the red pepper flakes as instructed but also used Tony Chachere's seasoning instead of salt.  I then added some red bell pepper.  Finally, I needed to add a little corn starch to get the consistency I desired with the sauce.  The dish turned out really tasty.  I will definitely use this recipe again next time I have left over crawfish tails.

Great recipe. I had leftover crawfish from a boil that added great flavor. Even with seasoned crawfish I found I had go add some more spices and would also recommend adding about a tsp of dried thyme to this to give it a authentic Louisiana taste. Overall great recipe.

I followed the recipie very closely, but used chilli paste instead of red pepper flakes. (I didn't have red pepper flakes on hand...) The flavor wasn't what I expected. It tasted too onion-y It seemed to be missing something. Next time I'll do what others suggested and add some Tony's (creole seasoning) to the sauce. My Aunt also suggested adding a little bit of liquid Crab Boil instead of the red pepper flakes. We'll see!

Didn't have bowtie pasta, so I used Angel Hair Pasta.  This makes a lot of sauce, I mixed it with the angel hair pasta at the end, like I would spaghetti and it was still a lot of extra sauce.  I also added about 3/4 container of shredded parmesan and some mushrooms, the sauce would have been way too thin for my liking,without the parmesan.  But the recipe had a good taste, my crawfish were left over from a crawfish boil, so they added some more seasoning and I added Tony's Chachere, but seasoning is a personal choice, being from Cajun Country, we like our spice!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Good base recipe and can be adapted to be a little less bad for you too.  I used 1/2 cream and 1/2 2% milk and thickened with corn starch, and used less butter than called for.  Added chopped asparagus, more garlic, and creole seasoning. Without the added seasoning, it would've been pretty flat in flavor.  It would be really good with some spicy sausage too to give it more substance.

Easy to make and very good.  I used the 'basic' recipe, and made only a few changes to suit our taste and to use what I had on hand.  I added the crawfish near the end of cooking, after the sauce was nearly done...I also added sliced mushrooms at the same time.  Rather than red pepper flakes, I used a generous amount of Tony Chachere's.  I used 3 cloves of garlic rather than 1, and also sauteed 3/4 of a yellow bell pepper to add a bit more color and flavor.  Very tasty, and very rich.

I made this for my buddies......Very good. The sauce didn't thicken like I thought it would but other than that it was a hit. I followed the recipe to a "T".

This was VERY good, but IMHO had WAY too much red pepper in it! (I actually watered mine down with more cream) Next time I'll only put a couple tsp of red pepper and some parmesan cheese.

Delicious!  I didn’t have heavy cream so I used half and half with a little cornstarch.  I added a little (very little) cayenne pepper for color and a little more heat.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for posting!

My husband loved it.  I thought it was okay.  We added parm/romano cheese for texture and flavor.  The sauce was too thin for my liking, but the flavor was good.

Sauce wasn't thick enough for my liking.  I doubled the red pepper and it still came off a little bland.  THe onion/garlic/crawfish flavor is a great match!

Great application for leftover crawfish..as uncommon as that is!

This is my husband's favorite dish that I make.  I only use 1 pint of heavy cream and I add extra Tony Cachere's seasoning.  I also add sliced link sausage and shrimp.  Can't wait until its crawfish season again!

This was so easy to make, and the flavor is FANTASTIC. I changed it a little and added cyan pepper verses the pepper flakes. Also once the onion and garlic were cooked I put it all in the blender to liquify it. I also added crab meat with the crawfish tails.

I added 8 oz. pepper jack cheese before the crawfish.  Next time I will use 16 0z.  I let cream simmer slowly until it thickened.  Wonderful dish and easy to make.  I had people over that begged for the recipe and thought I had spent all morning over it.

Like quite a few others, I used 1pt half & half and 1pt heavy cream then added 1/2 cup Parmesan to thicken the sauce.  This dish was incredible.  My wife and two daughters loved it.  The only bad thing about this dish is having to wait for crawfish season to come around again.  I will be getting extra just so I can make this awesome dish.

One of the best dishes I ever made!  Used 1/2 & 1/2 with whole milk.  Added grated parmigano reggiano when done.  OMG!
