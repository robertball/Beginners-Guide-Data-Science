This is a great marinade and would no doubt be great for steak too.  I baked it covered with foil for the first 34-40 minutes to retain moisture, then removed the foil and cooked for another 20 minutes to crisp up.  Delicious!

This was great!  My husband and two boys devoured the chicken.  I gave some to my Mom also, now she wants the recipe. Marinated it overnight and most of the next day. We grilled it and the meat was still very juicey.

My family liked this chicken very well. Made according to the recipe and marinated for about 8 hours. Thanks!

This recipe was divine. I needed a barbecue chicken recipe that was easy and yet had a light flavor, and found it with this one. I used 8 or 9 pieces of  boneless, skinless chicken instead of the whole bird, and let everything sit all day, refrigerated, in a 9.5 by 13-inch covered baking pan instead of the plastic bag before firing up the grill that evening. I also reduced the sugar and salt for a tarter flavor. My entire family raved about the great taste all evening. Fabulous! Thanks so much.

YUM! Used brown sugar instead of white, and white wine instead of cider vinegar.

Everyone ate this but we felt it was too vinegary however I think this might be really good cold in a spinach salad with raspberrys and walnuts

I thought this was OK, my boyfriend really enjoyed it. I could taste the cider vinegar a little too much...did turn out very moist though! Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious!!!!!!!  Didn't have an onion on hand so I used two shallots instead.  Aside from that, followed recipe exactly and it was sooooo good - thank you for sharing!

This is my favorite chicken marinade. I have only tried it with Chicken breasts however. I noticed with the chicken breasts that the acidity of the marinade tends to make the meat a little tougher (probably due to the acid cooking the meat before actually cooking). Soon I will try it with a whole chicken. The taste is phenomenal though. It makes your tongue tingle with joy.

I used fresh squeezed lemon juice...omitted the onion (because I didn't have one and didn't feel like going back to the store).  Marinated chicken breasts overnight and all day, then barbequed.  Awesome flavor!  Everyone loved it!
