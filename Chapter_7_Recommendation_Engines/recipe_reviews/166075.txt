This is a 3-star recipe if strictly adhered to, 4-star if considered as a base recipe, and 5-star if tweaked to perfection, or at least to personal preference. As written the recipe is short in that there is no real medley of flavors, relying heavily on a hefty amount of cumin and garlic powder--therefore, three stars.  But it's a good start. So... I sauteed a couple of strips of bacon until crisp, removed the bacon from the pan and added the chopped  poblanos which I didn't bother to blacken, half of a good sized onion, chopped, one minced jalapeno pepper, a few cloves of minced garlic (didn't use the garlic powder) and a chopped carrot (no corn for hubs). Once the vegetables were tender I added the flour, a little butter, a couple glugs of half and half for creaminess, the chicken broth and only 1-1/2 teaspooons of cumin. Let it come to a boil, then reduced heat and added the chopped chicken, the black beans, and some leftover rice (Zippy Rice Pilaf from this site to be precise). For those having trouble with the cheese clumping, it's important that you remove the pan from the heat before adding the cheese and let it melt in slowly. I seasoned to taste with salt and pepper and garnished each serving with tortilla chips, the crumbled bacon and chopped green onion. I served this as the submitter suggested, with Basic Corn Muffins, also from this site. Delicious!

I had a small bowl of this, while my hubby and I mean this when I say that, he went back 3 times.....That is right. My dad called and said he had the best Cheesy Chicken Poblano Chowder in Donna, Texas..Could I find a recipe for one. Well I found this one and man let me tell you, It was soo easy to do. The only difficult part was peeling the chard skin off the peppers, and that wasn't that hard at all. The flavors at 1st, when making them, was--hmmm,okay where's it at, an the moment I put in the spices--MAN ALIVE!! The Cumin is spot on and I wouldn't change a thing. Well maybe add more Pepper Jack Cheese like a 1/2 cup more. Other then that, not a thing....Lovely Lovely!!! My mom will be making this for my dad....I'm bowing at the presence of greatness in this recipe. Yummy!!!!

This is fantastic soup. Every pepper will vary on how hot it is (even coming from the same plant...I used the poblano's from my garden and they were very different) so you will need to taste them before adding. I added 3, but next time will add more, depending on how how hot they are. An easier way to get the skin off the peppers is to blacken them by putting them directly in a flame on a gas oven or a grill, then follow the directions by putting them in a plastic bag. Much easier and less chance of burning them (which I have done). Just use a long BBQ type of utensil so you don't burn yourself. I otherwise made exactly as is except left out the chicken...no need for it in my opinion with the beans and cheese. Next time, I will add an extra can of beans and maybe another pepper or two. Thanks so much for the recipe!!!! Fantastic!

I made this for a get together with the intention of just leaving on simmer all day for people to graze on.  My plan didn't work out very well however when everyone devoured the chowder.  It was a delicious recipe and went great with the black bean burritos I had prepared.  This is an excellent soup for a football sunday.

Really good. I did make changes. I put in a whole chopped onion and some garlic in the oil along with two chopped slices of bacon then added the roasted peppers (only 2.) Then added the flour, chicken broth and grilled pork loin cut into bite-size pieces.  I actually used shredded cheese but I think that processed cheese might work better and then top with shredded cheese.

As others mentioned this is a great recipe to get started. I fired up the gas grill and roasted the poblanos & two ears of corn while I grilled the chicken breasts.  I omitted the beans since I didn't have any on hand. The fire roasted corn flavor really added to this recipe.

So yummy!  Was trying to find recipes to use up some of the poblano peppers from the deck garden and this one caught my attention.  A couple of tweaks...used grilled chicken thighs rubbed with the taco seasoning (recipe from this site.  Really enhanced the spice flavor.  Cut off 4 ears of corn on the cob (cooked) instead of canned.  Used 2% cheese, but may not do next time..taste is great, but didn't seem to melt right.  Overall, this recipe is awesome!

This was fabulous and super easy to prepare!  The only change I made was to lessen the butter and add some taco seasoning.  Yum

Very tasty and colorful. I was looking for a way to use up my tiny garden poblanos, and this fit the bill perfectly. After making the roux, I added a minced onion, then swapped diced sweet potato for black beans, crushed garlic for powder, and fresh roasted corn-on-the-cob instead of canned. Come January, I don't think that will matter. I'll definitely be making this recipe for a winter warm-up.

I wanted to make half of this recipe and knew ahead of time I’d be freezing some of it, so I went about this a little differently.  I made the soup, adding some carrot for color and taco seasoning, less cumin and fresh, minced garlic for a little more flavor.  I did not make the roux or add the cheese.  I just simmered the other ingredients to meld their flavors for about 10 minutes.  Then I allowed it to cool, packaged half for the freezer, and refrigerated the other half.  When reheating, I made a roux of 1 T. flour and 1 T. butter, tempered it by whisking in a ladle of hot soup and then added it back to the simmering soup.  I tasted it at that point and decided I liked it without the cheese, so I didn’t add it, but I may the next time, just to compare.  This is a hearty and filling soup,  and great for a cold, winter night’s dinner.

When my husband sat down to dinner, he said, "I don't know, I'll try anything once."  That tune quickly changed to "this is really good, we have a keeper."  I stayed pretty true to the recipes.  For the chicken, I diced up 2 large breasts & sprinkled them with taco seasoning in a sautee pan.  When I melted the butter, I threw in a few minced garlic cloves.  Instead of mixing the cheese into the soup, I just put some on top when I served the soup.  For the tortilla strips, I slice up a couple of shoft taco shells, put a little olive oil on them & baked them in the oven until they were crisp.  Really, really tasty soup, lots of flavor.

I had a hard time getting it to thicken up after I added the chicken broth so I ended up adding another 1/4 c of flour later on. Very delicious, my first time cooking with poblanos and I realized they aren't spicy at all, my children will eat this again!

We really enjoyed this - it needed some tweaking but was delicious in the end. First of all I recommend roasting the poblanos on the grill/open flame. I sauteed a diced onion and several cloves of fresh minced garlic in the butter before adding the flour. I used regular canned corn (no peppers) and would like to try it with fresh or even frozen in the future. Be sure to drain and rinse the beans before adding. I also used cheddar and mozzarella cheese because it's what I had on hand. And actually the particular poblanos I had this time were WAY spicier than I've ever had before so I was glad I didn't use pepper jack! It could use more cheese and I added about 1/2 c 1/2&1/2 too to make it creamier. Ours was so spicy because of the poblanos I had that we topped with sour cream too to take the edge off. Good thing we like it hot!

I have made this as written but have since tweaked the recipe to suit me. Instead of using whole corn I like to use creamed corn. If the soup is too thin you can add refried bean, a few tablespoons at a time, until desired consistency. If I'm feeling lazy I just put everything in the crock pot in the morning and it's ready for dinner.

Very desappointed with this recipe Except adding some sauteed onions and garlic, I pretty much followed the recipe. The cheese stucked to the bottom and sides of the pan and made lumps in the middle, the soup was too thin ( probably because of the unmelted cheese) and did not have much flavor. I will just add some chicken and roasted poblanos to my old corn chowder next time and see what happens

Great Flavor but needs some tweaking in my opinion. Maybe less chicken broth, and adding the cheese first before the other ingredients. Definitely has potential and the spices are perfect. Will definitely try again!

I didn't have much time to prepare, so I stuck with the main ingredients (minus thickening it with flour), threw it all in the slow cooker and let it cook for 8 hours. The chicken was shredded and the flavor was amazing. I added a little dollop of sour cream and shredded tortilla strips at the end. This is a keeper.

Tasty recipe, but it did not knock my socks off.  I added half diced red pepper for color and drained and rinsed the black beans to preserve the color as photographed on AllRecipes. I used more cheese than suggested by a half cup. Next time,  I will reduce the broth and add half and half  to improve the creaminess and add jalapeños for more spice.

Oh good. It tastes like Chick-Fil-A's spicy chicken soup. I made 1/4 recipe as I do when testing. That served 2 amply. I used homemade turkey broth instead of chicken broth and some leftover shredded turkey. Delish! I'll make this again.

Made with one adobo pepper and two cups pepper jack, one cup sharp cheddar. Nice and smoky, very mild on the spicy factor. Love it! Excellent with buttered toast too!

Made this for tonight’s dinner.  We loved it!  Husband said better than restaurant quality.  Full of flavor.  I used chicken thighs.  The only addition was chopped onions.  Topped with (more) cheese, tortilla strips and cilantro.  Our new favorite stew!

Wonderful! I did make a couple of tweaks. I didn't roast the peppers, I diced them small and sauteed them in the butter with one small chopped onion and a teaspoon of minced garlic.   I also cut back on the cheese (only used 4 oz of cheddar). Even with these changes (because I was short on time and short on cheese), it was still delicious, and so easy! This one is a keeper!

Just returned from vacation in Mexico where I really enjoyed Chile Rellenos so when I saw this recipe I was anxious to try.
Make with all ingredients as listed except tried to modify per weight watchers so used soft margarine instead of butter and low fat chicken broth and cheeses.  It was just the right spiciness for me but I can see maybe adding a bit more heat. I would normally like to add onions and celery to soup but I do not think they would add to this one.  I had no problem with the cheese melting in but did keep at a fairly low heat. I will also partially puree some of the beans next time.
Otherwise a great easy soup to whip up once the poblanos are charred and make enough for a week of lunches. (that is the kind of soup I like)
fyi I calculated at 3 ww points with modifications otherwise about 6 per serving.

I will definitely make this again. I don't like spice so I didn't like the spicy cheese in it. To me that is all I can taste. If you don't like spice or don't like much spice don't put all of the spicy cheese in it. I will totally make this again without the spicy! Also I used homemade chicken broth. That made it taste MUCH better. Hope this was helpful!

Well I had some fresh pablanos from my garden, and searched for recipes. I found this one, and was glad I did!  I also checked reviews, and took some hints from them.  I added the chopped bacon, using the bacon grease/ butter to make the roux, also added the chopped onion, and fresh chopped garlic in place of garlic powder.  I used a store rotisserie chicken, chopped it, and used the chicken skin/carcass to make 4 cups of broth (in lieu of one of the 32 oz. cans of broth).  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  Turned out great, will make this one again!!

This recipe was great! The only thing I would change next time is to omit the cheese from the pot and just sprinkle it on afterwords. It didn't melt well in the chowder. Otherwise, a great base recipe!

This soup is AWESOME!  I made exactly has listed except I did saute a chopped onion and some garlic in the butter.  I didn't really measure the cheese, so might have had a little more than called for.  I thought there must have been a typo when the recipe calls for 2 tablespoons of cumen, but it was right on.  Gave everything a delicious flavor.  I took this to a churck potluck and boy was it a hit! Thank you loriac1969 for posting such a great recipe!

Yummy! I ate it with chips. I couldn't find the corn like it calls for so I threw in a can of green chiles.

As a soup-junkie, I thought this was delicious! Next time I will nix the roux and use mashed potatoes to thicken instead. I also will not bother to blacken the peppers, too time-comsuming. Very mild spice for the spice-conscious, as written. I altered the recipe by using an onion and minced garlic, roasting the corn in a pan will taco seasoning and pureeing part of the soup to thicken.

This was positively delicious.  I used grilled boneless thighs and some over ripe pablanos as well to give it a little extra flavor.  My guests loved it.

This a good simple recipe.  I followed the recipe even though I was tempted to add some sauteed onions.  The recipe is fine without them. The flavor is great. My only problem was that the cheese just clumped and did not melt smoothly.  I think next time I will increase the peppers to 4 or 5 and then just sprinkle cheese on top.
