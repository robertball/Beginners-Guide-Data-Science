Flavor very weak.  Flour was clumpy and the wings stuck to the pan.  No direction to spray pan.  30 minutes made soggy wings.  Next time, NO FLOUR!

This recipe is wonderful - you can always add more or less spice depending on taste. Several of the people "rating" this recipe aren't rating it at all - they're creating their own version of a completely different recipe not using flour. It has nothing to do with how these wings are made and if they don't want to use flour that's fine, but don't rate a recipe you haven't made or tasted.

Each time I make them I change up the spices in the flour mixture to give them different flavors and then combine with different dipping sauces. To cut on time, I freeze them for 30mins and the pop in the oven at 415-425 until done, flipping once. They come out crispy and yummy   each time.

Hey kids
The secret is to dry off the wings as much as possible before tossing with flour.
I stack mine  with 3 layers of paper towel between each layer of wings after patting them dry, then I put them in refrigerator over night.
I then pat them dry again Then I put 5-6 wings in bag with flour & coat.
Also I cook mine @ 425 convection on parchment paper.
A bit of effort is required but it is well worth it.

This is the BEST! It's easy and healthier then frying. I love it. I make it all the time for my family not sure why it doesn't have 1000 5 star rating. Try it

I always make hot wings this way...they are crispy, spicy and oh so good. It's the family favorite for any sporting event get together. I have never had a problem with flouring them and also use parchment paper to line my baking sheets for easy removal.

I agree, flour isn't necessary. A little oil and a dry rub of spices is much more healthy. I bake them on a wire rack so they are not sitting in a pool of grease. I like mine crispy so I skip the butter. If you want them hotter add some Tabasco to the oil.

I can't say they were amazing, but they gave a good base to work with.  I'm sure after trying some of the other recommendations I'll be able to give it 5 stars.  They were very tender though.  I'm curious what hot sauce others used.  We used Sriracha, which wouldn't have been my first choice, but sometimes you have to go with what the pantry says.  Overall, I like that they are baked and not fried.  Now I have extra calories to spend on beer.

I already had a favorite, but now I replaced it with this one. I used Jumbo wings so I placed on parchment paper and baked at 425 degrees for 20 minutes per side and followed the rest of the recipe. They were perfect!!!!

AWESOME WINGS!!! I don't see myself frying much in the future now! I sprayed the pan, put down the wings, and sprayed the wings before covering in saran wrap and putting in the freezer for 30 min (I didn't have an hour to refrigerate). As for the seasonings, I used Garlic salt instead of regular salt, some Tony Chachere's, and Mrs. Dash Original seasoning.

I'll rate this 4 stars.  However, I don't understand the need to add butter.  I season my wings and bake them for over an hour, draining off the fat before drizzling them with Frank's Hot Sauce and tossing in a bowl.  Easy peasy, and a lot less greasy.  The meat falls off the bone. But try baking them longer and using less butter and fat, there's already plenty of fat in the skin.

Vry good! I first dipped in milk/egg mixture then into four mix, i laid them onto a cookie rack then onto a fouled cookie sheet. Refrigerated them for at least 15 mins then put into oven.  They came out nice a crispy. I also used chicken tenders, yummy! Will def make again!

These are always in my recipe box and a go to recipe. After making it several times, I would suggest to spray the baking sheet with cooking spray and also spray the wings as you turn them. It will brown them a bit more on the outside without burning the wings. That is my only tip I have for this recipe.

My husband thought these turned out really good.  I used a non stick backing sheet, clean up was very easy.  I put barbeque sauce (Famous Dave's) on a few for me, they were very good too.

Delicious and quick wings.  I found that there was too much flour in this recipe; otherwise, this was just the right amount of spice.

A great alternative to frying! I love buffalo wings, but am always guilty after eating them because of the fry factor. This recipe eliminates that guilt!

This turned out good. Not everyone in my family like hot and spicy food,but they LOVED this chicken. Very flavorful and not hot and spicy at all. I also sprayed the pan that I used so the wings wouldn't stick. This is definitely a keeper.

FINALLY, I have an easy recipe for DELICIOUS wings!!!  I actually broiled the wings on both sides after baking cause I love crunchy skin.  I also used a different sauce since my wife is not a big Buffalo-hot fan.  So I used garlic powder and onion salt in the flour as well as a little bit of a spicy dry-rub.  Then I combined Teriyaki and Robert Rothchild Roasted Pineapple Habanero sauce.

I got the sauce to room temp and then put the hot wings in a bowl and poured the sauce over - you can hear the sizzle!!

We like our wings "well done" and crispy, so we did end up cooking them a bit longer. The turned out great, but we did not use this sauce. We made our own.  But will definitely use this cooking technique again!

This came out very tasty.  I added pre-chopped garlic and ginger at the seasoning stage and a bit of extra salt.   I didn't get as far as making the butter sauce, because I fell asleep whilst they were in the oven and had to get dinner on the table quick!

So mine had a sort of crispy coating instead of a moist coating (we are from the UK, where this recipe is virtually unknown, so the kids didn't know any different).  It was a real hit and I will do it again and minus the butter sauce it was superhealthy.

These are awesome!  I cook mine longer because I like them crispy. I turn every 15 mins. Usually for at least an hour. (So worth the wait!)  I also like my wings honey hot so I add some honey to the sauce.  Really good for not fried!

I've made these this way a few times now and they are just as good as fried wings. The only thing I do differently is to use Piri Piri spice instead of cayenne pepper. They are even good without the added sauce. I have one child who doesn't like spicy sauce so just eats them plain, they still have a good flavour from the flour mixture without too much kick.

So easy to make it. For those who think it too mild, it is easy to punch up spicy goodness with more cayenne pepper, I nearly doubled. The recipe needs to be corrected to say prep. 1 hour 15 minutes, due refrigeration time. Also spray foil or try nonstick foil.

Never made buffalo wings before and I love them after trying to find a restaurant that made good ones I gave up & decided to look for a recipe. Totally love this one made a large batch (70) wings for a fight night and let me say there were a huge hit! I used parchment paper to make the wings & it came out crunchy although I did cook them on 400 & for longer time until I saw them brown up. I took the left over sauce & jared it back into the Franks Original Hot Sauce bottle & used it after for some breaded baked chicken breast delicious! Thanks this recipe will stay in my family for a long time! Oh to the dry mix I did add a little extra to what was recommended & some adobo just a little.

This was good for a home recipe, and bonus:  no frying!  I used chicken legs and baked them for an hour in a 400F oven.  Next time I might cook them a little longer to get them a little crispier.  The flavor was good, and I liked the spices in the flour dusting (I mixed them all together in a gallon-sized Ziploc bag and shook the chicken in the bag).  The sauce was good but I will definitely decrease the butter next time;  even this little amount left a sheen of oil on top of the sauce.  A terrific alternative to ordering pizza and wings!  Thanks!

This was just as good as deep fried but much healthier.  I baked it for 1/2 hour turning once and then added the sauce and slow cooked in the oven for another 20 mins turning once.  I will make again!

It came out great. I added a few more seasonings to the flour, and sprayed the pan. Mine came out very crispy. They were a big hit.

I thought this recipe was great!!!  I actually used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cut them in a little bigger than bite size.  They were really good.  I used Jim Beam hot wing sauce and it was excellent for flavor and hotness.

Followed most of the directions with some tips from other reviewers. I used whole wheat flour instead of white. I patted them dry thoroughly and put them in the freezer for 30 minutes rather than the fridge for and hour. Everything else was from the recipe. The wings came out decent, but definitely should've broiled for 10 minutes or baked longer as they weren't crispy enough. Also wish I omitted the butter as they're not very healthy!

I made these as directed and my wife and I loved them but I would have liked them to brown and crisp just a bit more, so next time I'll spray the wings as well as the tray. I also made Chef John's Buffalo Wing Sauce which probably takes away from the "healthy" just a bit because of the amount of butter but it has that authentic "Buffalo" flavor that we like. I stopped eating fried foods a couple of years ago and I try to bake them as much as possible, so this recipe will be my "go to" for "oven fried" anything for a long time to come. Goin to try it on my chicken fried steak as well. Thanks for an excellent recipe addition to my collection. Five stars and high fives

I love making this. My husband can't seem to get enough and I try different sauces for variety.

This is better then the fried ones and if you don't tell someone it was baked they would not be able to tell the difference.

These were very good--made them on Superbowl Sunday, 2019. Great taste, easy, healthier version than some of the other more butter laden and fried recipes. Lets your oven do the work without all of the extra fat!

I thought these were very good. I up'd the spices a little and added some garlic powder to the flour. I put parchment paper on the cookie sheets and let them sit for an hour or more in the fridge.  The reason for only 4 stars is that I didn't use the sauce in the recipe, I just used Sweet Baby Ray's Buffalo Sauce, just to make it easier. I did find that I had to let them cook a little longer then written to get to the crispiness we like. But all in all, they were very good! And a lot less expensive than buying them out!

Made as directed. Didn't crisp up in 30 minutes so gave each side 10 more minutes at 425, then 2 minutes each side under the broiler. Will make these again, but try them without the flour to see if they crisp up better. Also used less butter in the sauce, probably about 1 1/2 t. Good flavor, used Frank's original hot sauce. Almost forgot, I baked them on a rack sprayed with cooking spray so fat could drip away. Maybe they need to be in the fat to crisp up. So guess I really didn't follow the recipe!!! Sorry! Still a keeper!

Read all the reviews and adjusted.  Turned out great!    Cooking - Temp:  425 degrees.  Same cooking time.  Lined pans with Reynolds Non-Stick foil so I wouldn't need oil or spray.  Prep: Husband had used up all the cayenne, so had to powderize some crushed red pepper.  Reduced flour by half and there was still excess flour.  Sauce: Cut butter in half, added pinch of dried ginger, 1/4 tsp of Aleppo pepper for more heat, and 1/2 tsp flour to thicken sauce.  Texture was medium crispy.  We like really crispy, but I didn't want to risk dry chicken.

I was initially a little intimidated by the comments and mentions of "soggy" wings but mine turned out perfectly! I made 24 wings with this amount and cooked for 18 minutes on each side and 5 at the end but they were fall off the bone good! I will be making again for sure!!!

LOVE THESE WINGS ?
I have made these wings a few time now. My family absolutely love them. I followed the tip to dry the wings. also I cooked them on a wire rack above a baking tray and they turned out so crispy but still juicy.
Thank you for the recipe.

Everyone loved these. I followed the recipe exactly and refrigerated the floured wings for over an hour - had no trouble at all with sticking. They were also good leftover. Very tasty - Will make these again!

My teenage son loves hot wings and loves to eat them deep fried and crispy. I have been cooking healthier for him lately, I've cut down fried foods to once a month, He loved the wings. My only problem was...I didn't cook enough!
Great recipe as is!

Delish!  I basically followed the recipe but added just a few changes.  The recipe did not call for it, but I seasoned my wings first before dipping them into the flour mixture.  Then for the hot dipping sauce I added a few dashes of the hidden valley ranch seasoning packet just to add some tangy flavor.  
It was a hit for my family who by the way is my worst food critic!  
I will definitely be making these again....--- yodiegirl243

I sure that its good but, for even healthier option for buffalo wings just cook them with hot sauce on them and bast them for how much spice you want

Made this for my family last night.  I forgot about taking pictures but the chicken was really good.  Next time I make this I am going to use boneless chicken.
