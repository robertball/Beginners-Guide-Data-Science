This is one of my favorite easy "busy-day" crockpot recipes.  I make it Weight Watchers friendly by omitting the butter, adding mushrooms, and 1/2 cup of water, and substituting FF cream cheese and Reduced Fat soup. I serve it over whole wheat noodles or brown rice.  Only 5 points per serving plus the points for the noodles or rice.

This turned out to be a great recipe -- whole family enjoyed it. I, like many other reviewers, was a bit skeptical of combining the chicken w/nothing more than 1/8 c margerine and the dry salad dressing mix, but figured there must be a reason or Judi would not have submitted it this way, so I resisted the urge to add the canned soup in the beginning. I did add a splash of red wine that I had on hand, but other than that, there was very little liquid. Also used Good Seasons Mild Italian dressing mix, since my kids don't like highly spiced food. I turned the crockpot on low and cooked for about 7+ hours, and of course the house smelled incredible. The chicken chunks were golden brown and had a roasted taste and appearance, something that wouldn't have occurred had I added the soup at the beginning. I then added a can of reduced fat cream of chick soup and a brick of red. fat cream cheese. Plopped the brick in whole, covered, then stirred after it had softened. Turned out so delicious, and in no way reduced fat tasting! My 6-year old daughter ate so many "appetizer bites" out of the pot, she was full by dinner time! Very creamy and rich tasting, and the dressing mix provides just the right amount of seasoning. We served over noodles -- delicious! Very easy, tasty recipe -- and seems "fancy" enough for company. Putting this in my Favorites folder.

This is the best recipe EVER!!  I can't tell you how thrilled I was with how it turned out.  I cut down the chicken to 2 very large chicken breasts because my crock pot is only 1 1/2 quarts and it's just me eating (I don't like tons of leftovers), but I left all the other amounts for the sauce the same.  I cooked the soup (Campbell's 98% Fat Free), margarine and dressing mix plus 1/4 cup of white wine with the chicken from the beginning, then added 4 tablespoons of 1/3 less fat cream cheese (Neufchatel cheese) and about half a cup of fat free cream cheese.  It was fabulous- EXACTLY like Angel Chicken Pasta on this web site, which I love and is my favorite recipe in the world, only less fat, much, much less preparation, and fewer dishes that don't have anything burned or stuck on!  I think I'll be making this often now, thank you so much, Judi!  Update a while later: this is also awesome with pork chops instead of chicken and I use no butter and half the cream cheese.

This was the most delicious dinner.  I used frozen chicken breasts straight from the freezer to the pot and followed advice from other reviewers: Skipped the margarine, used half of 0.7 oz pkg Italian dressing mix (will use even less next time), 1 can Healthy Request Crm of Chicken soup and 1 can Healthy Request Crm of Mushrom soup thinned with about 3/4 c. milk.  I let it cook for about five hours until it was moist and tender, falling apart.  Shredded the chicken and then I added 4 oz. 1/3 less-fat cream cheese and about 1/2 c. of sour cream.  I let it cook in the crockpot for another 45 minutes to let the flavors blend.  Served it over whole wheat egg noodles and it was heavenly.

Typically, I make the recipe exactly as written the first time, but I didn't have any cream of chicken soup ... so I used cream of mushroom - YUM!  My picky, picky Hubby who doesn't like "white" foods, loved this.  My 5-year-old daughter gave it two thumbs and a big toe up! :-)  I'm sure no one will read this review, but I wanted to put it out there anyway ... definitely shred the chicken, then there isn't too much sauce and don't be afraid to thin it with some milk.  Delicious!  THANK YOU!

This was FABULOUS!!!!  I was in a dinner slump and just joined allrecipes a few days ago.  Picked out this recipe after reading all the reviews.  I did alter the recipe somewhat after reading the reviews--I put the 98% fat free cream of chicken soup, the butter (yes, I used butter!), 1/2 of the Italian dressing mix packet, 1/4 cup white cooking wine and 1/4 cup chicken broth (I used Herb Ox) in the crock pot and mixed it up.  I threw in the frozen chicken breasts and cooked on low for 5 hours.  I then shredded the chicken in the crock pot, added softened 4 oz. Neufchatel cheese, and about 1/3 cup of fat free sour cream.  It cooked for half an hour on high.  When I tasted it, I thought it tasted almost exactly like a pasta dish I always get at the local Italian Restaurant, minus the spiciness.  To add a little kick, I threw in some chilipiquin peppers that are growing in my back yard.  Served it over wheat egg noodles.  EVERYONE in the family loved it!!!!!!  THANK YOU!

I love this recipe! I did make a few changes to it. I add the soup into the mixture in the morning with the chiken. When I get home I turn the slow cooker on high and add the sour cream while the egg noodles are cooking! I make this all the time. It is so easy and tastes great.

This recipe is excellent just the way it is. I always go by the recipe first and rate it. There is no need to add the soup first. The margarine and juices from the chicken are plenty as it is. I get a bit bummed to see people rate these recipes a 5 star but yet there are two paragraphs to how they alter it. Therefore it really is no longer "this" recipe. I can see changing it to less fat or sodium.

This was delicious, although I made some variations based on the similar Slow Cooker Beef Stroganoff (which I loved) on this site.  I added a chopped onion, used only half of the Italian dressing mix packet (0.7 oz.), healthy choice cream of chicken soup, and only half of the cream cheese.  I also added about 1/4 cup of milk.  These changes made the end result less thick, caloric, and salty.  It was wonderful!

talk about easy. I put frozen chicken breasts in, added about 1/2 cup white wine to the butter and italian dressing mix. I then cooked it on low for about 6 hours, put the cream cheese on top, waited about 5 minutes, it was soft enough, put the cream of chicken soup in, and as I was mixing it together, I shredded the chicken at the same time (on purpose) served over egg noodles, hubby even comented on how it was a nice change of pace. Will definately make again!

Oh, this was good.  All 3 kids AND the husband loved it, which says it all. I liked that it was so easy to prepare.  I threw in 4 large frozen chicken breasts, the can of soup (low fat), the margarine, some white wine, and a .6 oz package of Tastefully Simple Garlic Garlic dip mix (because I didn't have the Italian dsg. mix and I REALLY wanted to try this recipe).  Left it on low all day, then shredded the chicken and added about 2/3 package of low fat cream cheese (that I melted in the microwave with some milk) about 30 minutes before serving.  Served it over brown rice and the kids ate it all up and didn't even realize they were eating brown rice!  The one thing is that it doesn't make much sauce, so if you like things saucier, add some more liquid to it.  We'll definitely keep this one in the dinner rotation!

I would  have NO hesitation serving this dish for company! It was fabulous! And I did not change a thing. I believe that if a person is nice enough to post a recipe, you should make it at lease once before you start messing with it. This recipe needs Nothing!!!

AMAZING!  I made a few simple changes, leaving all the ingredients the same.  I brushed the frozen breasts with the melted butter and Italian seasoning (I stirred them together before coating).  I also added the soup at this time so it would not dry out the chicken during cooking.  After 5 hours I took out the chicken and shredded it (extremely moist!) then added in the cream cheese and turned crockpot down to warm to heat through.  It was just wonderful, great flavor!  May I suggest the best thing ever??  CROCK POT LINERS!  No sticking to the pot and majorly quick clean up!  Pull it out of the crock pot and toss in the trash, boom... you are done with cleanup!! They are just the best and made this recipe even better... :O)

This recipe was a nice change of pace from other crock pot recipes. The flavor was excellent and the whole family loved it.  I think that one packet of Italian dressing mix was just the right amount of flavor, and it wasn't too salty.  After reading other reviews about using only 1/2 of a packet, I was a little worried it would be too strong as I'm a little sensitive to salt.  I wouldn't recommend cutting it back at all.  It was perfect just the way it is.  I did use low fat cream cheese, and fat-free cream of chicken soup and it turned out wonderful.  Crock pot recipes are usually very easy, but this one was unbelievably easy!  I'll be using this one again for sure!

Wow this is really good!!  I threw 3 huge frozen chicken breasts and the soup in the crockpot before I went to work.  When I got home I shredded the chicken and added everything else and cooked it about an hour.  Served it with egg noodles.  Yummy

5 stars for ease and flavor!  This recipe is fantastic and no major changes are required.  You easily can adjust the ingredients to your taste or dietary requirements.  There are even some other additions you could consider:  Bacon, mushrooms, onions, white wine or even a can of green chilies.  Hard to believe that this wonderful dish is both Weight Watchers AND Atkins friendly.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this yesterday and admit I used it as a base start. I have a habit of looking at the recipes and reading the reviews of others before deciding whether to try one or not!  I am so glad this one made it to my table! I used 7 chicken thighs as that was what I had on hand. We try to watch our salt intake and after coating the thighs with the dry mix remembered other reviewers said it was too salty so I rinsed off some of the Italian dressing mix off the thighs.  Next time I will just use ½ a pack so I will not waste it. After it had cooked for 7 hours I drained the juices out of the crock pot & de-boned and shredded the chicken.  Pre-heated the cream cheese & soup mix in a sauce pan with about 1/4 cup of white wine, and instead of sour cream used 4 heaping tablespoons of plain yogurt. When it was hot & no longer lumpy I then mixed it in the chicken added fresh sautéed mushrooms and left it in the crock pot for another hour. Hubby had his on wide egg noodles; I had mine on white rice. Served it with a side salad. It was awesome! I could not believe how easy it was to prepare. I will be making this again!  I will give this 4 stars as I believe that had it been made as it was written it would have been very good but feel that the simple additions is what made it so WONDERFUL!***We ate the left overs for diner last night and it was even better! OMG!!! I am soooo looking forward to making this again!

Really delicious and easy. I followed the instructions and didn't put anything but the margarine and dry dressing then added the liquid later. I also added 1/4c of diced onions, 1/4-1/2c of mushrooms, and a clove of garlic with I added the soup and cream cheese. I served mind over rice. New Family favorite!

Awesome!  Try it with chive and onion cream cheese, the flavor is amazing.*  I cooked the chicken for only 3 hours (stirring occasionally) on low before adding soup and cream cheese and it was done, very tender and delicious.  I had no cream of chix soup so I made a small batch: Melt 2 Tbs unsalted butter over med heat, add 2 Tbs flour and stir until well mixed.  Add one cup of milk and stir until it starts to bubble.  Add 1 to 1 1/2 tsp chicken bouillon (1 tsp = 1 cube) and mix well. Reduce heat and simmer for a few minutes before adding to chicken.  Add a little more milk if needed. Perfect for 3 large or 4 med boneless chicken breasts.  *I use only half a package of italian dressing mix if I use the seasoned cream cheese.

Its awesome, but its not stroganoff.  It does come out REALLY thick and kinda salty. I love it.  If you dont like high salt content, use low sodium soups, if its too thick, add some water or chicken broth.    Its a great recipe, but if you're looking for a classic stroganoff taste this doesn't have it.  Try this modification.  Add 2-3 bay leaves to the chicken and butter (I don't do margarine) and salad dressing at the start.  Once the chicken is cooked, add 1/4 cup sherry, let the booze cook off for about 15 minutes, then throw in 1/2 the cream cheese, 8oz of sour cream, and a pan full of sauted mushrooms. Skipped the condensed soup. I also like to water it down a bit with  of low sodium chicken stock.  Then it really tastes like stroganoff, although the original recipe is still yummy goodness.  I noticed some people putting in wine.  When cooking with cream sauces don't ever use white wine- its way too acidic and citrusy for a cream sauce.  Use sherry or chicken broth if you feel it needs extra liquid and water won't cut it.

This was great. Good Ole' Comfort food.  I used frozen chicken breast & threw right into crockpot. Used the seasoning. Waited about an hour & dumped in the soups with a 1/2 can of milk because other reviewers stated it was thick- with a splash of worcestershire sauce. Cooked on high for 4 hours, ,shredded the chicken & then put in 4 oz of softened cream cheese with 4 oz. sour cream lite. Cooked another hour. Served over wide egg noodles. This was outstanding!

I have made this before just following the recipe and it is great but I like a bit more flavor so my favorite way to do this is to put 4 chicken breasts (straight from freezer) in the crock pot along with 1/5 a cup of melted butter, 1 full pack of zesty italian spices and a few splashes of white wine. I make sure both sides of chicken are coated in seasoning and butter before I close up the pot on low for 7 hours. After the 7 hours on low I add frozen peas (1/3 a bag), mushrooms (3/4 can), 1 can condensed cream of chicken and here's the key: 1 container of cooking cream(Philadelphia, the new cooking cream cheeses, found next to the cream chewed) I use the Italian cheese and herbs. It really adds a punch to this dish. I let this cook for 45 min on low and serve over egg noodles. DELISH!!!!!!

I found this to be very salty tasting even with using a low sodium soup. It didn't end up being  family favorite.

I have used this recipie about 3 times and every time it comes out incredibly well!  I take 4 frozen chicken breasts (whole) and toss them in the crock pot.  Usually I don't have any italian dressing so I've substituted balsamic vinegarette and add splash of wine.  After the 6-8 hours it's in the cooker, I take it out and shred the chicken with 2 forks (takes about 2 min) and then add the soup and cream cheese.  It's become a favorite recipie at my house!

I thought this was a good recipe. I made it last night and I only made a couple of additions. I added fresh mushrooms and a 1/2 c of dry white wine at the beginning.Some hints...I softened the margarine before I mixed it in with the dressing mix..this helped coat the chicken better. Then, when it was time to stir in the cream cheese and soup, I softened the cream cheese in the microwave first and then mixed with the soup before I added to the crock pot..  I also used low fat cream of chicken soup and low fat cream cheese and it still was excellent-and very rich!Yum!

This recipe gets 10 stars for "EASY".  And, very good.  I followed the recipe just as written, with one exception; I did not cut up my chicken breasts before cooking.  I used the frozen ones, and just let them thaw in the refrigerator over night.  I resisted the urge to add any liquid and was very surprised that there was plently of liquid in the pot at the end of 6 1/2 hours of slow cooking on low.  The 2 tablespoons of margarine (not butter) and the juices from the chicken were sufficient to produce all the liquid needed.  I sprinkled the entire package of dressing mix over the chicken and margarine and put the lid on.  I had to cook a little longer because we were not home and got home a little later than I expected, but I could not tell that the extra 1/2 hour cooking time effected it at all.  When I poked the chicken with a fork, it fell apart and basically shredded on it on with only a few twists of the fork.  I put the entire block of cream cheese in the microwave for 30 seconds to soften it before I mixed it with the soup.  I then added it to the chicken and let it cook on low while I cooked some wide egg noodles to go with the stroganoff.  By the time the noodles were done, the stroganoff was ready to serve over the noodles.  I severed with some steamed green peas, which my daughter mixed with her stroganoff and noodles and said it was really good.  (I might mix the peas in with the stroganoff next time.)  We ate this with some Pillsbury Place and Bake Crescent Round

I made this tonight. I read several reviews and made these variations:
4oz Sour cream / 4oz Cream cheese, 1/2 C white wine, 1 TBSP red pepper flakes, 8oz fresh sliced mushrooms, and I used Campbell's new Cream of Mushroom Chicken Soup. I cooked it for 5 hours on low, served it over egg noodles and it was REALLY good. I put in the soup/cream cheese/sour cream/red pepper flakes after 3 hours. EXCELLENT!!!!

I made this using low fat cream cheese and cream of chicken soup. I also just dumped everything in at the beginning. After 5 hours on low, it came out perfect. At that time,I added 8oz. of sauteed mushrooms and mixed with extra wide egg noodles. Mmmmm, perfection.

This was the best!  I needed a chicken crockpot recipe that was easy and this one was perfect.  I have made this 3 times since the holidays and goes over so well each time.  It is a great HIT!

This meal was so easy & delicious! I read the other reviews & added mushrooms at the begining & shredded the chicken after the 5 hours while adding the soup & cream cheese.  I did half the Italian dressing mix & I liked how it came out, but my husband thinks i should add additional spices next time (not more seasoning packet, but different ones).

This recipe is fabulous! It is great comfort food for a cold day. I have made this recipe on several occasions and my entire family, picky eaters and all ate it up! I make it with fat-free cream cheese and 98% fat free cream of chicken soup. It brings the calories down to less than 300, the fat to about 6g, the sat fat to 1.5g and the cholesterol to about 64mg per serving. I also add a little water to make it a more "servable" consistency. I also, on occasion when pressed for time, make it on the stovetop and it turns out great every time. Love it!

My husband and I loved this recipe! I noticed some reviewers said that it was dry and/or bland. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and it was super tender and flavorful. Cooked on Low setting for 6 hrs and served over egg noodles.

Hubby and I both enjoyed this recipe.  We added a variety of fresh mushrooms the last 1 hr. of cooking and served all over fresh homemade noodles.  DELICIOUS AND EASY.  I thought, if desired, you could add some frozen peas the last hr. of cooking too.  And, for a more sophisicated palate, perhaps 1/2 cup white wine or Sherry.

Wow!  Couldn't believe the wonderful taste of this dish!!  The kids ate it up!  I used 1/2 package of onion soup mix instead because I didn't have the italian on hand, and threw the chicken breasts in frozen.  Cooked 4.5 hours and pulled the chicken apart with ease.  I will definitely be making this again and again.  Thank you Judi!

The ONLY reason I am rating this as a 4 is that I found that 5-6 hours on low for the cubed chicken was way too long.  I added the soup and cream cheese after 4 hours, and then kept it on warm for an hour until everything else was ready, and it was just fine.  I was prepared to add sour cream to give it that "stroganoff" flavor, but when I tasted the sauce at the end, I was amazed at how much like a stroganoff sauce it tasted, so I nixed the sour cream (yeah - fewer calories!).  This is a definite keeper in our house.  Thank you Judi Ann.

I have never left a review for a recipe--whether I've liked them or not.  But, I had to this time, because this is probably the best tasting dish I've had--coming from the crockpot.  I think the dry Italian dressing mix really added to the flavor & the cream cheese made it very creamy.  DELICIOUS!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Perfect score.  I read other reviews before making and made the following changes:  1 tbsp butter only, 1/2 pound of mushrooms and 1 cup of dry white wine added with the chicken and dressing mix.  The chicken was perfectly tender and the sauce not too salty.

Made this as listed.  Tasted good.... but was a little too thick.  Will definitely have to add milk or wine next time.  I cubed the chicken before, this was not necessary.  It just shredded after stirring.

I used two large chicken breasts and cooked them in the soup, salad dressing mix, and enough water to cover while I was gone at work (8-9 hours). The chicken was very tender and had a delicious flavor. I added the cream cheese, garlic salt, garlic powder, and pepper when I got home and cooked for an additional half hour. Served over egg noodles, this one was a tasty hit at our house! Thanks.

We loved this!  No changes needed, flavor is perfect and this is a great easy supper for a workday!  For those of you who are curious about adding the cream cheese and soup at the beginning it hurts nothing.  I add everything at the same time, go to work while it cooks and then stir it up and serve.  It doesn't change the flavor of the dish and still comes out great every time!

OMG! This is so good it's simple stupid! I put 3 nice size frozen chicken breast and sprinkled one package of Natural Good Season Italian Style mix and one can of cream of mushroom soup. I also used one small package of Baby Bella Mushrooms(think this made the dish) and cooked all day on low while at work. When I got back I added a package of reduced fat cream cheese and turned on high to melt. Served over some no yolk egg noodles and was best Stroganoff ever had! I usually have to add sour cream when making these types of dishes, but not this one. Think next time I will try fat free cream of mushroom soup and FF Cream cheese to make super low fat! Will post results next time of FF ingredients.

My family LOVES this recipe.  What I've learned from making this several times is that if you will be home in 5-6 hours, follow the recipe exactly.  If you are going to be gone longer, then it is best to add the soup in the morning unless you use frozen chicken breasts which will obviously take longer to cook.  I had a long day at work and left the thawed chicken breasts on low for 7 hours and they began to get brown.  This did not affect the taste of the recipe, however.  I have also used a packet of ranch dressing which I had on hand, rather than the Italian. This is simple and delicious every time!

We just finished eating this for dinner.  My husband loved it!  Followed the recipe mostly as directed excepted I added in a splash of white cooking wine in the first stage.  I resisted the urge to add any more liquids in too, as  another reviewer had stated.  It was hard not too, since there is not much liquid, but it is definitely worth it.  I might add that I sprayed my crockpot with nonstick cooking spray before adding any of the ingredients to make sure I didnt have a messy clean up on my hands afterward.  I also used reduced fat cream of chicken soup and 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  This had no effect on the taste as it was still very rich in taste.  Thanks for a great recipe I can add to my recipe box!

This recipe would get five stars, but it was really all the reviewers who made it excellent! I combined ideas and added a little cooking wine in the crockpot (about 1/4 cup). I was worried that the chicken would be in for too long without much liquid, but it turned out SOOO good (even after 9 hours, since I work full time). The only other change I made was to cut the cream cheese in half - I'm VERY glad I did because it was really creamy and I think it would have been overkill to add more than the 4 oz. of cream cheese. Thanks to all the reviewers for the suggestions!

Will probably make again after following advice of other reviewers.  Put cubed chicken in c-pot with a little onion + 2 pressed garlic cloves.  Mixed 1/2 C sherry with 2T melted butter & 1/2 pkt. Italian Seasoning mix.  Cook on low for 5 hours.  Add Sauted onion, garlic & some baby bellas, the soup, 1/2 container of Savory Garlic Cooking Cream (Philadelphia Brand)  and some peas & stir into chicken.  Cook another 1/2 hour.  Served over Egg Noodles.

This dish is SO GOOD and very easy to make.  I did make a couple of changes, however.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken and added two small cans of sliced mushrooms.  I will definitely make it again.

This was so easy and tasty!  I had 5 large chicken breasts, so I used 2 pkgs of dressing mix and doubled all the other ingredients.  I'm glad I did since we like a good bit of sauce.    My husband picked up the 98% fat free cream of soups (1 chicken/1 mushroom) by mistake, and I didn't realize it til I actually made the meal.  I was worried it might compromise the texture or flavor of the sauce, but it was delicious!  I softened the cream cheese and mixed it well with the soups before adding it to the slow cooker.  I did need to thin the sauce a bit, as others mentioned, so I used 2 soup cans of water and 2 bouillon cubes.    Also added a little garlic and a lot of black pepper and served with farfalle and petite green peas.  Thank you for the recipe, Judi Ann...we loved it! :)

This is the 2nd time I've made this; the last time I made it by another recipe I found on Pinterst, and it seemed bland.  This time, I put my whole skinless, boneless breasts in the crockpot with the butter (margarine is not food!) and Italian dressing and got it going.  I also doubled it and added a third pack of Italian dressing.  After 3 or 4 hours (I had it on high), I put the cream cheese on top since I was leaving home for about 2 hours; turned it on low.  When I came home, I added the chicken soup, took the breasts out so I could stir the sauce together well, then pulled the chicken into hunks and tasted.  I added some pepper and dried parsley and some additional garlic (cloves, minced in the beginning, and granulated garlic).  We didn't find it salty; if you taste the sauce alone, without the chicken and egg noodles, it seems a little tangy, I think from the dried Italian dressing.  This time we LOVED it.  Each person's taste is different, I'd say cook as directed, then taste.  Like us, you may actually need a little salt, pepper, etc.

This is a wonderful receipe. I tried it as written, the first time. For the next 3-4 times, I experimented until I found a version we liked that included lots of garlic and mushrooms. Poured the mix over linguine and it was wonderful. This receipe is one that is easy to adjust to your own tastes.

I made this the other night for a friend and my nieces (ages 10 and 14).  My nieces can be VERY picky so I was careful to choose something to make that I thought might please their palates.  Well--winner, winner, chicken dinner!  This was a huge hit with everybody!  I fatally cracked my slow cooker insert (long story) so I wound up cooking this in a large pot on the stove, making the necessary timing and temp adjustments (which I successfully guessed at!). The only hard part (not really) was cubing all that chicken which I tackled when the breasts were still slightly frozen.  
I served this over cooked egg noodles and had delicious Jersey produce as the sides: corn on the cob and cucumber & tomato salad.  I served cubed fresh watermelon for dessert.  Did I mention zucchini bread?!  My nieces have requested I make this chicken recipe again very soon!

I am addicted to this recipe! I've make it three times this month because I can't get enough of it. I add fresh broccoli and an extra can of cream of chicken and serve it over steamed rice. I really think the rice makes a huge difference. Sooo yummy!

I was nervous after reading reviews about it being too salty. It wasn't, it was awesome!!! I cubed frozen chicken and put it in the crockpot. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly. There were patches - very few - that were salty. I must not have mixed it as well. But aside from those 2-3 bites, it was perfection. My kids ate it. My anti-chicken-hubby had seconds. Next time I'll add some frozen mixed veggies near the end, too.

The basic recipe was very good, but turned out excellent with just a couple of modifications.  My family likes saucy stroganoff, so I doubled all ingredients except the chicken (but used 4 large boneless skinless breasts).  I used neufchatel lower fat cream cheese and fat free chicken soup.  I added one cup of chardonnay to the chicken, margarine and italian dressing mix at the onset.  This is a keeper!  Thank you!!

This was absolutely delicious! I added mushrooms to the crock while the chicken cooked. The sauce was a bit too thick after I added the cream cheese and the soup, so I added some milk to thin it out and turned the crock pot on high to heat it more quickly. I also added freshly ground pepper and a dash of thyme for flavor. I served this over egg noodles, with cauliflower on the side. Thanks for the great recipe!

I think that there is an error in the recipe ingredients: if the "dry Italian-style salad dressing mix" is Good Seasons, then the size of the envelope should be 0.7 oz., not 4.7 oz.  My husband loves this recipe!

My family loves this recipe! Great for kids. I'm not big on cream cheese, so I use half cream cheese half sour cream instead off all cream cheese with the soup. When you're in a hurry, you can make it on the stove top too.

This was very good, but not earth shattering (hence four stars rather than five - I don't give out five stars lightly.)  After reading a few reviews that said it was too salty, I only used half of the package of dry Italian dressing.  It was still very flavorful, but not too salty.  I will definitely be making this again.

Very good but a tad on the salty side. It could be that I used the recipe from this site for the Italian Dressing seasoning, since I didn't have any store-bought.

After reading reviews I made a few alterations. Cut out the butter completely and replaced it with fresh baby Portabella mushrooms and 1/2 C of water. Used FF cream of chicken soup and FF cream cheese. Added soup and cream cheese after 4.5 hrs. Also added garlic powder, 1/3C sour cream, and 2Tbsp of fresh frozen basil. Was too salty with just the original ingredients.  Will be making this again with the same alterations.

I loved this recipe! I cooked it the first time as written and it was great, but I wanted a little more vegginess. The next time  I added 1 large can of portabello mushrooms (stems and caps), used onion and chive reduced fat cream cheese and then threw some spinach in about 5 minutes before we were ready to eat.

WONDERFUL. I made this recipe exactly as written, but added 1/4th cup white wine to the chicken/butter/italian dressing. This was so good. I took a bowl to my in-laws, and they suggested trying to make this with shrimp. I'll have to tweek the recipe, but I think that'll be even better! I will be making this often!!

I would give this 10 stars !!! Very delish! Cooked the chicken ahead of time,this cut slow cooker time way down. Hubby walked in the door at dinnertime,asking "is that smell coming from our house?? YUMM!!!"     I also tried this recipe with cooked lean beef,substituted cream of mushroom for the cream of chicken,and tossed it all into the slow cooker at the same time. It was the BOMB!!!  Well after dinner was over,hubby wanted to heat up more and eat again! Thank you for this great dish!

my husband is never happy with the dried out texture of crock pot chicken so I decided to try boneless skinless thighs instead of breasts and he said it was the BEST crockpot meal he'd ever had.  I also cut the cream cheese and italian dressing mix in half and added 1/4 cup milk with the soup.  Yummy and easy

What I loved the most about this recipe was the simplicity!  I put whole frozen chicken breasts, a few tablespoons of olive oil (didn't have butter) and about 1/4 cup of white wine in the crock pot before bed and put it in the refrigerator.  In the morning, all I had to do was plug it in and leave for work.  I cooked it all on low for about 10 hours and the chicken was done perfectly--juicy, moist and tender.  I served the stroganoff with brown rice--so yummy!

My family loved it! You all don't know us, so it's tough to understand what a miracle this really is. I made a couple of simple changes only because of what was on hand. I used uncooked chicken tenders in place of the breast so cooking time was much, much less. I also used that crazy named cream cheese wanna be that is 1/3 the fat. Finally, I sauteed and onion and some mushrooms at the end of cooking time and tossed them into the mix. We served it over penne pasta and there are zero leftovers. I repeat - ZERO LEFTOVERS!!! Can you hear the angels singing? Great recipe! Will absolutely make it again. Thanks Judi Ann! You are now in the Will.

Simply excellent and so easy to make. I threw in 3 large frozen chicken breasts straight from freezer. Cooked for 5 1/2 hours on low and shredded it easily with fork.  I did cook about an hour after adding soup and cream cheese. I thought the whole seasoning packet was perfect flavoring as some people thought it was too salty. Served over egg noodles. Mmmm will definitely make again soon!!!!

I tried this for the first time yesterday.  The hub & I found it quite tasty, and it was so easy.  I cut both chicken breasts and thighs into chunks (bigger than cubes) and placed them, along with some diced onion in the slow cooker.  I melted the required amount of butter (instead of margarine) and mixed the dry italian dressing into it, then poured it over the chicken pieces.  I also added 1/2 cup of white wine.  I started cooking it on low, at 1:30 in the afternoon and then went about my day.  At 7:00, I added the cream cheese and cream of chicken soup, and started cooking extra wide egg noodles.  By, 7:30, everything was ready, so I mixed up the noodles & chicken sauce, heated up some garlic bread, and dinner was served.  Next time, I might add some green chilies to give it a little zip!!

Loved it! I was very skeptical about the chicken, seasoning and butter alone in the crockpot with no additional moisture...SO glad I followed the directions as written!!! The chicken had an amazing flavor. Wow! Thanks for sharing.

The chicken was tender, sauce was creamy with just the right tangy flavor. The only change I made was to triple the recipe and it worked great. So great in fact that the group of six I made it for did not leave me any of the leftovers I was planning on. 

This will definitely go in my list of "make often" recipes.

pretty darn good and quite simple! For me it was lacking a bit of texture though...im thinking next time we might add sun dried tomatoes or something simliar to give an extra texture and extra flavor...

So easy and soooooo delicious!!! I followed the recipe exactly except that I doubled it. Served over egg noodles, this was the perfect dinner by all counts. Thank you so very much for submitting this! I will be making this again soon. Everyone loved it.

We LOVED it!!  Okay, okay I changed it up a bit after reading the reviews.  I put the chicken in whole, melted the butter and added the italian seasoning.  Placed it in the crockpot stirred and made sure every piece of chicken was well coated with the butter/italian season mixture.  Cooked on low for 4 hours.  Shredded the chicken, mixed the cream cheese and I used cream of mushroom soup--no reason other than I wanted to--, put in fresh mushrooms and let cook on low for another 30 min.  The sauce did not look like enough liquid for the 4 of us so I added 1 1/4 cup heavy cream, grated 1/4 cup parmesean cheese and another tablespoon of butter.  Served over linguine with garlic bread and called it CHICKEN ALFREDO. YUM, YUM, YUM. and Oh so easy.  Definitealy a keeper.

I made this last night and we loved it.  I had 4 large frozen blsl chicken breasts, and I knew I would be gone all day, so I put them in the crock pot w/ 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, about 1/2 a cup of italian dressing (I didn't have any dry packet mixes on hand), garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, italian seasonings, (didn't measure any), and butter (I don't usually have margarine), cooked on low 9 hours (b/c that is how long I am away from the house, and I don't have a timer...darn it!), I removed the chicken so I wouldn't overcook it and added the low fat cream cheese, and turned the heat up to high and let it melt for about an hour.  Added the chicken back in (which we kept whole) and turned to keep warm just long enough to warm the chicken back up.  Served with rice, green beans and garlic and herb biscuits!  YUMMY!  Will make this again for sure!

I've been making a variation of this recipe for years that's even easier: i omit the margarine, and put all other ingredients in the crockpot together on low(i use frozen chicken breasts). When I get home from work, I'll stir it up (and cut up the chicken breasts), then serve over egg noodles.

My husband and I loved this.  Based on other reviews, here are the tweaks I made.  Used butter instead of margarine, only half of the dry Italian mix, and only half of the cream cheese.  I added some pepper, lemon pepper, parsley, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning to make up for not using all of the dry Italian mix.  Some othe other reviews said that it was too salty so that is why I didn't use it all.  I added some sauteed onions at the end just to kick it up a notch!  I tossed the egg noodles in the crock pot (about 2/3 of a bag) when it was ready to serve.  For step one, I melted the butter and combined the Italian mix before putting the chicken in.  For step two, I cooked it for about an hour.  We will definitely make this again.  My husband and I both rated this about 8 out of 10 which is very high on our scale!

This was delicious! Everyone in my family loved it and that makes it a winner in my book! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I tweaked it a bit: used 1/4 cup bottled italian dressing instead of the margerine/dressing mix, added 1/2 t garlic powder (we love garlic at my house) & a splash of white wine, cooked on high for 3 hours, then added the soup, 4 oz. cream cheese, 1/2 cup sour cream, 3/4 cup chicken broth, dash of black pepper and paprika, cooked on low for another 45 minutes and served it over rice (though I think egg noodles would have been even better). The chicken was "melt in your mouth" yummy!

This was so good!  It didn't take near the 7 hours.  I used frozen flat chicken breast.  I followed the Weight Watcher's way from a previous review with lots of mushrooms, 8 oz Fat Free cheese, 1 can 98% FF Cream of Chicken, and 1/4 cup of FF sour cream right at the end.  Instead of the italian dressing packet I used 1/2 cup of FF Italian Dressing.  I Cooked the Chicken with the Ialian Dressing and a splash of water for about 2 hours on high, then added the mixture of Cream of Chicken, mushrooms, and cream cheese.  cooked for another hour on low, added the sour cream and cooked for another 1/2 hour on low.  This is a perfect dish for a saturday when you are home to mess with it but busy cleaning and waht not.  LOVED  it, will definately make again.

Mmmm, the perfect comfort food.  I added a splash of dry white wine in the beginning with the chicken, butter, and seasoning packet.  Don't believe other reviewers when they say the whole packet is too much seasoning...it is the perfect amount.  I cooked on low for 5 hours then added a can of sliced mushrooms (liquid drained) and some frozen peas (thawed) along with the cream of chicken soup and cream cheese.  I served it over hot brown jasmine rice.  My fiance and I ate the whole pot ourselves!!

Delicious recipe, especially for a crowd with a wide variety of tastes! (Though it is a bit salty. Using Healthy Request soup helps.)  I have made this countless times. Most recently I used the Italian Dressing Mix homemade (minus salt) from this site. I also substituted the soup with evaporated milk mixed with a heaping Tbsp. cornstarch and two tsp. chicken base. To the original recipe I always add fresh sliced mushrooms. Garlic added is great too. Served with steamed fresh carrots and broccoli, and herb bread. I think the addition of chopped red pepper or pimiento would be wonderful for taste and contrast. I also thought this dish was great with the sauce cooked longer (less cooking time for chicken, more time with sauce). And if I miss the slow cooker deadline, I use the stove!!

Wow! This recipe has incredible flavor! Couldn't find dried italian dressing, but used dried italian seasoning for the crockpot instead. My entire family raved about this--even the little kids ate it.  Next time I will leave the chicken in strips or whole breasts, because my cubed chicken was kind-of dry after 9 hours on low. It still tasted fine with the sauce on it. I will definitely make this again!

This was a very quick and easy recipe.  I used the recommended 1/2 pkg of italian dressing, low-salt butter and mixed it in with fresh mushrooms, 1/2 orange pepper, full medium sized green pepper, and a medium sized onion.  I sprinkled it with both black pepper and hot chiles for a bit of a bite.  After slow cooking for 4 1/2 hours I added the cream cheese (light) as well as the Campbells cream of chicken soup (low fat) and 2 TBSP of sour cream.  It turned out amazing!  Placed it on a bed of rice and my girlfriend and I were in heaven.  A rich meal, not salty at all.  Next time I will try it with Bell Peppers or Habanero peppers.

Yum!!  I used 1/2 packet Lipton Veggie soup mix (instead of salad dressing mix), added 1/4 c. water, and sprinkled some dried parsley and dried soup veggies on top.    I also put in 5 small chicken breasts (didn't cut into pieces).       I actually put EVERYTHING in the slow cooker at once, from the start!!   Came out perfectly!!!!!!    Could see using this same recipe in the slow cooker with shredded cooked, turkey, and serving over stuffing - yum!!!!!    Thanks a bunch!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I was dissapointed, but I did eat this meal.  It was entirely too salty and the error needs to be corrected to 0.7 oz for the seasoning.  The chicken was hard because of no moisture when cooking.  If I try it again, I will add all the ingredients and let the chicken cook with the soup.  I also think that I am going to try sour cream instead of cream cheese next time

You CAN put just the chicken in the slow cooker for hours. (With the little bit of butter and seasoning, as the recipe says.) It was fine and did not dry out, the natural juices of the chicken came out and kept it moist. I even left it for longer, over 9 hours, since I left it while I went to work.
I also was worried the Italian dressing would give it the wrong flavor (I was thinking it would be basil and oregano flavors like spaghetti sauce), but not at all, it was a nice herb mix.  Although not the same flavor as beef stroganoff.  I've never heard of chicken stroganoff, so not sure what it's supposed to taste like.  But found this recipe to be a nice creamy, midly herbed chicken flavor.

I thought this recipe tasted GREAT with some modifications. I substituted: Health Valley brand low sodium, all natural cream of chicken soup, 2 bricks Neufchatel (1/3 less fat) cream cheese, homemade Italian seasoning for the Italian salad dressing mix, and unsalted butter for the margarine called for. At the start, to the chicken and butter I added 1/2 cup low sodium chicken broth, & 1 cup white wine.  Part of the way through the cooking processes I added chopped, fresh green beans and 1/2 diced red bell pepper. Increased the seasoning a little bit with a few drops of low sodium Worcestershire Sauce and a couple sprinkles of Frank's Red Hot. The chicken only needed 4 hours on low to cook, after which I added the cream cheese and cooked to melt. (I needed more cream cheese than called for because I had added too much liquid at the start). At the very end, added 1/4 cup of heavy cream. Very happy with the flavor, consistency and sodium level, but I'm not sure why my cubed chicken breasts seemed tough. Overall, when served on egg noodles, rice or quinoa this was a great 1-dish meal.

Wow what a delight, no need for
any extra liquid in the beginning. Cooked on hi for the first 3 hours & low for another 2 hrs.   I was skeptical about using the whole brick of cream cheese, so I used 3/4 and 1 can of condensed cream of chicken soup, I microwaved the soup and cream cheese to soften a little. added it to the crock and I tasted it 10 minutes later and decided to ad the rest of cream cheese.  I also added 1/2 cup of milk and a 1/4 cup chicken broth. this was for my tastes, not as thick that way, and goes further for a family of 4! Wonderful dish.

my family loved this recipe. but I made a few adjustments to make it better. I added a splash of white cooking wine in the beginning along with an 8 oz container of sliced mushrooms half way through the cooking. When I made the cream cheese/ soup mixture, I thought it tasted too much like cream cheese. So I added 1/4 cup sour cream. Served it over hot noodles & it was a hit.

This was good, not exceptional, 3 stars for flavor but added one star because it's incredibly easy to make. Many of the negative reviews said it was way too salty, note that this recipe calls for the tiny .7 oz dressing packet! The ones I buy are 1.3 oz packets so I weighed out my dressing mix & used the .7 oz called for & didn't find it too salty, just right for our tastes. Also some negative reviews said the chicken was too dry, well that can depend on size of chicken breasts used & size of crock pot. I have a large 6 qt crock pot & used medium sized breasts so most of my chicken sat directly on the bottom of the pot, & I noticed about 2 hours in that the chicken was already cooked through. Since I planned on 5 1/2 hours until dinner I turned it down to "warm" temp for the next 3 hours & the chicken turned out just right. The gravy was a bit thick, I think if served with just-drained-pasta it would have been okay but because I was serving with rice I wanted it thinner so it would drip down into the rice a bit more so I added a bit of milk, maybe 1/4 cup. I used the condensed cream of chicken soup called for in the recipe, which made it turn out a pale whipped-butter-yellow, which was kind of weird for a sauce, & I think it would be better with the addition of garlic, so I may try this recipe again using condensed cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup. This would make for a different flavor that I think we'd like more, the color would be more appetizing.

Trying this recipe today. I will add the dry noodles about 10 minutes before it should be done. I have done this in the past and they cook perfectly. This saves having to wait for water to boil, then cooking the noodles. Also saves on cleanup. Try it. It really works!

I made this for supper tonight, and like a couple other reviewers said was concerned about the lack of liquid but also resisted the urge to dump everything in at the beginning. I used 3 medium sized boneless breasts. Didn't have the dry Italian dressing mix, so used Lipton's Garlic & Herb soup mix. Cooked on low for about 6-1/2 hrs, and when I got home added the cream cheese & soup, put the lid back on while I put noodles on to boil. Then shredded the chicken right in the pot like another reviewer suggested.  It is a bit too thick for my liking, so I did add about 1/4 cup of chicken broth.  This is definitely an awesome slow cooker recipe.  It wasn't quite as flavorful as I was hoping, but that could be the change in seasoning.  I still gave it 5 stars though, because my 17 year old picky daughter loved it and had 2nd's...she rarely has 2nd's at home.  That's an accomplishment right there! :)  Thank you for sharing this simple but wonderful recipe!!

It's very bland, and   If I made this again I would use sour cream instead of cream cheese, and add mushrooms, white wine and worcestershire -- maybe even a little extra garlic.

I absolutely love this recipe, so does my husband! I follow it exactly, I don't put the soup in at the beginning. At first I thought it would burn or something with that little of liquid in at the beginning, but it doesn't. Gives the chicken a nice roasted/browned taste and look that you wouldn't get if you put the soup in at the beginning. Overall it's a great busy day comfort food. Will be making it more often. :)

Amazing!!  This is such a good, quick, easy recipe!  Both my boys love it and my husband says its his most favorite thing I make!  
It can be changed easily my switching out the soup and the dressing packet. 
A must try!!

This was very good.  I was, like other reviewers, worried about putting the chicken and butter in the crockpot - without liquid - but I followed the recipe and boy am I glad I did.  My family loved it and they have requested it several times.  I will be keeping this one handy.  Thank you Judi Ann!

Excellent, my wife told me to keep this recipe. I followed some tips from other people and added a layer of sliced onions under the chicken, added a 1/2 cup of milk and 2 TBLS Sour Cream. I cooked the noodles and added them to the crock pot at the same time you add the soup and cream cheese. It did taste salty until I added the noodles. Then it was perfect. Yummy!

Very easy to make. I added a can of cream of mushroom soup in addition to the cream of chicken so I would have more sauce. A cup of frozen green peas added with the soup and cream cheese also tasted good. Served over whole grain noodles.

Tastes great but it only needs 5 or 6 hours in the slow cooker.  I work 10 hour days and cooking that long on LOW turned it into mush.  Tasty mush, though.

Little skeptical when I tried this recipe, but its surprisingly good.  Ok I did add a few extra ingredients.  Added chopped bacon, mushrooms and peas.  I used precooked chicken and threw all ingredients into the slow cooker.  Next time I think I may add some cream or all little something else to make more sauce.  Perfect dinner for one of those busy nights.  I served with Rosemary pasta in roasted garlic sauce off this site.

Easy, smells great, & tastes wonderful too.  Saved some calories & fat by using FF cream cheese & reduced fat soup.

This was delicious and so easy! I followed the recipe, cooking the chicken cubes, 1/4 cup of margarine, and the dry Italian seasoning by itself for 6 hours and then added the cream cheese and chicken soup.  I also threw in some fresh spinach leaves and mushrooms the last hour or so of cooking. Served over egg noodles w/ Cheddar Bay Biscuits (MMMM!) and broccoli.  Delicious!

This was fantastic, I did make a few changes because I am on a low carb diet...fat free cream cheese, garlic, water instead of soup (made it more liquidy but still was good) onion were all added. I cubed the chicken also. This had an "oven roasted" taste too! Yummo!

This is perhaps an odd complaint, but I thought this was too rich!  I used reduced-fat cream cheese, but I did use the full amount of butter.  This was extremely easy to make, the house smelled fabulous, and my husband liked the dish (which I served over pasta).  I feel like I need to find the right way to tweak this recipe to make it great.  I'm going to try doubling the soup and chicken and perhaps reducing the margarine.

Was great as a stroganoff or a chicken dip! Really tasty and the kids loved it! I would defiantly use a low sodium Cream of chicken because it was to salty.  My crock pot cooked it in about three hours so that is something that needs to be taken into consideration.  I wouldn't just take the suggested time on this recipe.

This was very good!  It was a bit salty for my taste (condensed soup and dressing mix are both very high in sodium).  Next time I might not add the entire package of dressing mix - either that or double the recipe and still only use 1 pkg of dressing mix.  I would be willing to try low sodium soup next time, or add some milk to thin it out some.  I used cream of mushroom soup and it was very good.  Sauteed or canned mushrooms would be a great addition to this recipe!  Thanks for sharing this!

Loved this recipe!  So easy and everyone liked it, which is rare in our house.  I put the chicken in the crock pot frozen, and I did add a splash of white wine like others mentioned, left it on low for more than 9 hours (only beacuse that was how long we were out of the house that day) and the chicken was awesome!
Will definatly be making this one again.

I didn't have time to make it in the crock pot so I mixed all the ingredients together, poured over the whole chicken breasts in a shallow dish, covered with foil and baked at 375 for 45 mins.  I also am watching my calories/fat so I used 1/3 less fat Philly cream cheese and Campbell's healthy request cream of chicken soup.  It came in right at 350 calories a serving and tasted much, much more sinful than that.  This recipe is a keeper, thanks for sharing!

I made this without using a slow cooker. Salt & Pepper the chicken add to a pan with a little olive oil and butter cook until lightly browned and follow the rest of the direction by adding directly to the pan and it's done! Easy and taste great... just a few ideas on things you can add to make it a little tastier. Green chilis or a mixed frozen veggie great with asparagus,peas or broccoli. Just some ideas to add some color and texture.

I used boneless frozen chicken tenders (about 10). I used butter. I used the lower fat cheese (neufchatel) as well as the low sodium low fat cream of chicken soup. This is a rich and filling dish. Delicous prepared just as it says, but NOT on a heart healthy diet.

Absolutely the best-tasting Chicken Stroganoff ever!  My husband loves this dish.  I doubled it and we ate it all within a few days.  The cream cheese takes a while to melt properly so I had to cook it a little bit longer.  And due to the extra salt in the salad dressing mix and canned soup, you do not need to salt this at all.  We had it over egg noodles.  It's such a simple, quick dish, no chopping veggies or pre-cooking meat, just drop in crock pot, go about your daily activites, and come home to a wonderful aroma and delicious dinner!  We will definitely make this dish over and over again.  Thanks for this recipe!

My family loved this, but I think I will use cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken and sour cream instead of cream cheese next time.  I also suggest cooking the chicken in stock because the butter didn't provide enough liquid to keep the chicken from sticking.

This was a total hit with my whole family, which doesn't happen often!  The only complaint I got was that I didn't make a double recipe.  I didn't plan ahead enough to make this in the slow cooker, so I made it on the stove, and it only took about 45 minutes, start to finish.  I also tried to make it a little bit healthier.  I used fat free cream cheese and light "I Can't Believe it's Not Butter."  I also added some fresh mushrooms.  I will definitely be making this again in the near future!

Loved this recipe....very easy and tasty.  I did add some fresh baby portabello mushrooms with the chicken at the beginning....highly recommend this addition if you are mushroom fan.  I also added a little bit of water with the butter (about 1/4 a cup), might even substitute white wine next time.  Served over ange hair pasta.....it was fabulous!

I'm giving it 5 stars cause the basic recipe is great. I had to change things because I didn't have all the ingredients and it was snowing so I didn't go out.  Instead of cream of chicken I had cream of Mushroom( only can on hand)  didn't have the Italian seasoning mix so I used the one on Allrecipes and used 2T of it.  Didn't add any liquid to the chicken and it browned beautifully with just the butter and seasoning.  Added only 1/2 stick of cream cheese (4oz.) because that's all I had and then added 4 oz. sour cream.  It came out great.  Had no leftovers.  Will make it again for sure

This was outstanding!  I had to make one change as I did not have dry Italian dressing mix.  I  sprinkled dry Italian seasoning on the chicken instead, everything else was the same.  My husband and I thought it was wonderful. I think I will make this for an upcoming potluck.

I love this recipe! I make it on the stovetop, sauteing the chicken in butter with some onion and garlic powder, add in softened cream cheese and salad dressing mix, and then homemade cream of portabella mushroom soup. Serve over egg noodles. I make it with shredded beef more often than I do with the chicken, and it's delicious.

This was a disappointment :( The chicken smelled DELISH as it was cooking in the italian seasoning. Then I added the soup and cream cheese, and when I tried to eat it ... all I could taste was overpowering cream cheese. I'd suggest unless you are a huge fan of the taste of cream cheese, perhaps using a heavy cream in lieu of it.   If I try this one again, I'll omit the cream cheese and soup.

I was looking for an easy chicken slow cooker recipe this was a great one!  My husband wasn't feeling well so I actually omitted the soup/cream cheese mixture from the crock pot part and did that on the stovetop for myself.  So the only things in the crock pot were the butter, chicken breasts, some sliced baby portabella mushrooms and the italian seasoning.  And I have to say WOW!  This dish is so flavorful without the sauce that we have been making it every week.  The chicken and mushrooms make a really nice broth to pour over egg noodles.  I did try the sauce the first time but honestly I liked it better without!  There isn't anything wrong with the sauce - it was just that the flavor of the chicken without it was so fantastic I didn't want to add anything to it!  I read the reviews and agreed that the butter makes a nice coating and since I always toss in fresh mushrooms, it adds a richness to the flavors - and sometimes I use only half the envelope of seasoning because it can be a bit overwhelming.  This is one of our new favorites.

I used 1/2 c. white wine with the 2 tbsp. butter and dressing mix with my frozen chicken breasts on low for 5 hours... chicken was pretty tender... I shredded the chicken then adding the soup and one cup of milk with the cream cheese and turned on high for a little over an hour. After the hour I whisked the mixture .. to mix the cream cheese because of chunks.... Added sliced mushrooms that I sauted in butter and olive oil. I cooked egg noodles poured the chicken mixture on top... topping it with grated parmesan cheese... YUMMY!  Will keep this recipe for sure!!!!!!

A fast-cooker version.  I put in 8 frozen chicken breast tenders with the butter and 1/2 package of dressing mix in my crock-pot on HIGH for 1 hour. The house smelled amazing after just a few minutes.  After an hour I checked the chicken and it was cooked to perfection. I shredded it and added the soup and cream cheese. Covered and let sit still on HIGH for 20 minutes.  Meanwhile I sauteed mushrooms and an onion, cooked egg noodles, and microwaved a bag of Steamable Peas.   Then added the sauteed mushrooms and onions, peas and noodles to the crock pot. The sauce was too thick so I thinned it out with milk and pasta water. I also added about a 1/3 c of sour cream and a dash of pepper.  Yum! Next time I'll chop the chicken instead of shredding it and double the recipe.

This is a very tasty recipe. The first time I made this i followed the recipe exactly, and i found my chicken to be a little on the dry side(i did put my chicken in thawed). The second time i made it i had to put the chicken in frozen and added the can of cream of chicken soup. After about 5 hours cut the chicken up and added half a brick of creamcheese and half a cup of sour cream, wow what a difference, the chicken was so tender and the flavour was amazing, i think putting the chicken in frozen is what made it so much better the second time. I served over egg noodles with garlic bread, my family loved it! I will making this alot.

I was looking forward to eating this ALL day long... at 4pm I pulled up the recipe and realized I had forgotten it was a crock pot recipe. DARN!! I was craving it so much, I just decided to cook this on the stove top. I first sauteed mushrooms with olive oil and butter. Removed it from skillet then I cooked the chicken strips in olive oil, once cooked I added back the mushrooms and all of the other ingredients. I let it simmer for about 45 minutes on low.... boiled some pasta and added it to the chicken...WA-LA!!! it was delicious!!!

Delicious!!!! I was so worried about putting chicken, butter and seasoning in the crockpot without liquid.  The smell when I got home was awesome!  I added the soup, cream cheese, sliced mushrooms and a splash of milk.  This was delicious!

Excellent recipe!  I cooked frozen chicken breasts for 4 hours on high (w/butter and dressing mix) and shredded them when cooked.  I added 1/2 cup of white wine and sauteed mushrooms the last half hour also.

The Chicken is alright but I made this with beef and I will never make another version of beef Stroganoff again! It was awesome with the beef! I also used a big can of cream of chicken instead of the smaller ones. Thanks for sharing this! :)

We liked this recipe 'just okay'. Leaving just chicken and margarine in crock pot for 5-6 hours on high is way too long, chicken was very dry. Did not like the cream cheese/cream of chicken mixture, my husband and son described it as a pasty sauce.

Yummy.  I cooked 3 breasts from frozen with a packet of Good Seasons Zesty Italian, butter, a can of cream of mushroom and a splash of white wine.  After 5 hours on low I added 8 oz. of sliced mushrooms and shredded the chicken.  At the 6 hour mark in went the brick of cream cheese and I cranked it to high for another 1/2 hour.  I served it over egg noodles and had to stop my husband from finishing the whole thing so he would have leftovers for lunch the next day.  Really delicious and easy recipe.  Thanks!

I've made this once and that was off the recommendation from my mother in law, we added a clove of crushed garlic, about 1/2 cup white wine and about 1 cup of mushrooms.  The only thing I found was that you need to chop the chicken up in BIG pieces otherwise the chicken just falls apart when it's chopped small.  So make them big chunks otherwise you really would have a sauce and not a chicken with sauce.

Quick and easy, but way too salty.  Next time, I would use low sodium cream of chicken soup, and either half of the Italian style dressing mix or Italian seasoning. Saltiness set aside, the sauce is wonderfully creamy, thick and rich.

This was really good! I did make some changes. It seemed weird to have "stroganoff" anything without mushrooms. I added frozen chicken tenderloins to the bottom of the crockpot. Then in a saucepan I sauteed mushrooms, onions,and frensh minced garlic.I layered the veggies over the chicken and then combined two cans of the soup,1/2 cup of white wine, and 1 cup of milk. I only used about a tablespoon of the dry mix and that was plenty. Much more and it would have been way too salty. I shredded the chicken, added the cheese, and served over egg noodles. Really yummy and ingredients I always have on hand!

I followed the directions exactly. Came out so creamy and rich, even though I used Neufchatel cheese and low fat chicken soup. Directions didn't really say what to do with the juices in the pot; I left them in. Excellent comfort food for a busy day!

With a four hour off premise and three hour at home working, I have rediscovered slow cooking. I had high expectations but was a little let down. It was really lacking something. I used the suggestion of another member and used fat-free cream cheese and low fat cream of chicken soup. I also added mushrooms. I think next time, I will add some sauteed chopped onions.

How can anyone like this?? I followed the recipe to a T, with the exception of using "healthy choice" chicken cream soup with less fat and there is enough salt in the dish to kill an army!! It is edible, but I might as well just cook from a box or a can - it was no better than opening canned chicken and puring the salty cream of chicken on top. Yuck!
We definitely have a problem in our country if everybody likes this salty mess.

The only flavor I could taste in this dish was salt.  Also, the chicken became very dry even though I followed instructions.  I won't be making this one again.

I've made this several times and each time it comes out a winner.  I have added a dash of white wine to the chicken.  Also, I cook the chicken breast whole, then shred them before adding the cheese and soap.  Great dinner.

This recipe paired with rice makes a fantastic one-dish meal!  I followed the recipe almost as written, with a few changes: did not cube chicken (for sake of simplicity), only used 1/2 package of cream cheese, added 1/4 cup fat free sour cream, added 1 can of peas (drained).  Also, I substituted low-fat or fat-free products where possible, as the extra calories are unnecessary and make no difference to the final product.
I threw in 4 (or 5?) large chicken breast halves, margarine and 1 package of mix.  Cooked on low for an entire day (8 AM to 5 PM) while at work, came home and shredded the chicken with two forks and then added the remaining ingredients.  Then cooked on high for 20 minutes and then stirred and kept cooking on high for another 15-20 minutes.  Meanwhile, rice was cooked in a rice cooker.  So basically, the entire meal was ready to be eaten within 40 minutes of coming home!  Awesome and will definitely make again for me and my boyfriend (who could "eat it everyday").  Only change I would make is perhaps use 1/2 to 3/4 of a packet of salad dressing mix to reduce the sodium level.

Took the advice of another reviewer and used frozen chicken breasts, 1/2 the package of italian dressing and one can cream of mushroom plus one can cream of chicken thinned out with some milk.  Put it all right in from the start.  No cream cheese so subbed 1/2 cup of sour cream and threw in some frozen peas about 20 mins. before serving.  This turned out great.  So comforting, kind of like a chicken and dumplings.  I will definitely be making this again!

I love this recipe for its incredible simplicity yet surprisingly yummy taste!  I followed the recipe exactly...using Healthy Request soup, reduced fat cream cheese and butter in place of magarine.  I served it atop No-Yolk noodles and with a slice of garlic toast.  It's a keeper!!

This is the best chicken dish ever!!!  I didn't have hours to prepare it so I took the chicken breats and sliced them in about 2" peices and fried them in the butter and the Zesty Italian Seasoning mix until it was brown.  Then I mixed the cream cheese and the soup and about a cup of whole milk together in my crock pot and turned it on high then added the chicken and seasonings for about 30 min. until it was all bubbly.  Then I boiled some wide egg noodles , set both bowls on the table and my family put the chicken and sauce over the noodles and absolutely raved over how great it all tasted.  Wooo Hooo!

Very easy and kids friendly.
I used whole chicken ( the only thing I had on hand) 2 pkgs of dry dressing mix, 2 cream of mushroom soup, 4 oz of cream cheese and 1 cup of sour cream.For start, I added big chunks of carrots, red onion and mushrooms at bottom of pot, added butter and dry mix, and layed chicken on top. After 6 hours, I put in rest of soups,sour cream and cream cheese and continued on low for 1/2 hour more, then added a whole pkg of spagettini broken into 3, mixed all and left to cook for another 1/2 hour. It absorbed the liquids and made it into a thick stew. I served with thick crusty bread with butter on top. Kids loved it and so did DH. will make it again.

By cutting the cream cheese in half this recipe is wonderful. It was way too rich the first time I tried it, but this time was a winner.

I recently rediscovered this recipe and have made it 3 times in the last 2 weeks. This is the one time I actually prefer to cook the chicken on high because it doesn't fall apart. I used almost the entire envelope of seasoning and was not disappointed. I only added pepper at the table. I added frozen broccoli and chopped carrot the last 45 minutes and it comes out perfectly. Resist the urge to add liquid at the beginning if you like your chicken to stay together. Served over whole wheat rotini.

The chicken hardened and got crusty in the slow cooker because it didn't have enough moisture to cook all day in just the butter and seasoning.  Next time I'd add the soup in at the beginning and maybe thin it slightly with milk.

Made it as listed with reduced fat cream cheese. Delicious. Maybe a tad salty and thick, so I will try less cream cheese and less seasoning next time as others have suggested.

I first made the recipe exactly as written.  Tried it & it had too much of a cream of chicken soup taste.  So, I hate to modify recipes but felt I needed to do something because it was too salty as well.  So, I added sautéed mushrooms,  frozen peas, sour cream, and garlic.  Those additions made it better.  Served with egg noodles.

Made this exactly as the recipe is written and served over egg noodles and with peas. It was delicious and I was asked to keep it in the regular rotation. It is easy, tasty, and great comfort food. I will be making this again. Thanks  for sharing this recipe!

After reading some of the comments, I too put the soup in at the beginning. Also added about 1/8 of a cup of sherry. Will definitely be making this one again. So yummy.

This recipe is so simple and delicious. I made it twice, first time I followed the directions and used everything suggested. My boyfriend and his roommates loved it and it was gone within 12 hours. The second time I made it, I used reduced fat cream cheese and added an extra can of cream of chicken, towards the very end I cooked frozen broccoli then added into the crockpot, I also used 3 bags of egg noodles to help stretch the food out longer, despite my best efforts, every last drop was gone within 24 hours.

I made this in a crock pot with ranch dressing mix as a substitute. It was delicious! I used four frozen breasts, though I could have used a couple more as it makes a lot of sauce. I then shredded/chunked them at the end.

I baked this instead of slow cooking because I was short on time. However the chicken was still very tender and the meal was delicious. To cut carbs and fat even more, I used Neufchâtel cheese instead of cream cheese, I omitted the Italian soup mix and used Italian seasoning.

We tried this yesterday and it tasted pretty good.  I added a couple ingredients though because it looked to have a really thick/pasty consistency.  I mixed the soup and cream cheese in a bowl and put it in the microwave for about two minutes (stirring about every thirty seconds), then poured it in the crockpot.  Because this mixture is rather thick, I also added 1 cup of water and 1 cup of chicken broth, then stirred evenly.  The chicken was really tender and tasted great.  The only other change I might suggest was also in another review.  Depending on your personal preference, two packets of the italian seasoning may make it taste a little too salty, so only use one packet instead of two.  Overall, it's easy and taste good.

I've made this dish 3 times in the last month, primarily because it is such a huge hit with the teens in this house.  It gained the status of 'best dish ever!!!!" from one enthusiastic family member.  Corn is nice on the side, and I tend to cook up a bunch of green veggies as well just to add to the nutrition.  It is perhaps a bit bland for my palate, but hey the kids are enthusiastic and there is zero complaining when I make this dish so I'm just going to run with that.

My family really loved this recipe.  The third time I made it I realized I didn't have Italian dressing mix and used Knorr Vegetable soup mix instead.  It came out even better and the veggies gave it some color.

This is super good and easy to make. I sometimes substitute the Italian dressing mix for a Lipton onion packet and it gices it a twist. I serve it over rice. Very good!

Pretty good.  I used 2 big chicken breast only.  I am glad as there would not have been as much sauce.  Instead of cubing the chicken, I did shred it.

Overall, this was delicious. Besides shredding the chicken and only using 2 breast we followed the recipe exactly as it is. Next time, I will double the amount of soup and maybe add another half brick of cream cheese as we like lot of sauce.  We had ours over egg noodles and it was great, creamy tasting. I did use a packet of regular Italian dressing and next time I may try it with the zesty Italian and see how that is.

Some recipes are so tasty for how easy they are to assemble and cook-this is one of them recipes.  I did follow the directions with one addition; I added some blended roasted red peppers (cause I love them and they go well with Italian dishes...)  We served this over campanelle noodles and everyone loved it!

I, along with my picky husband, loved this recipe.  I even pureed some with veggies for my 8-month old who also enjoyed it.  I will say that if you are preparing the recipe with egg noodles, make double the sauce otherwise it will be a very dry dish!

Wow!! As always seems the case I "made some changes" because I didn't have Italian dressing mix, but I did have Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix. Recipe turned out amazing. Bit hit, I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious!  I put it over Japanese Boton rice and brocolli florets, it was soo good.  I added 1 Cup of white wine to make it saucier.  I also shredded the chicken at the end.  I didn't have a full pack of cream cheese, I used what I had and it was perfect!  I will try this with Cream of Mushroom next time since that's my favorite.  Great recipe, a nice chage!  Thanks for sharing!

I didn't read the directions and dumped the chicken soup in for the whole duration.  Probably made the chicken flavor from the dressing less, but it was still pretty good.  I'll make again following the directions next time.

Probably the best thing I've tried on this site, and I've made many things!  The first time I made it exactly as the recipe states and was blown away.  The next time I added fresh, sauteed mushrooms and was blown away again!  Both times served over egg noodles.  My husband calls it food crack.  This is company-good! Thanks, Judi Ann!

I loved this! So easy to make and it tasted sooo good! I used Cream of Mushroom Soup and added half a can of water. It was still very creamy because of the cream cheese. Served over spiral pasta. Perfect "comfort food."

I liked this, but the chicken got a little overcooked/dry for my taste. Next time I'll add a little white wine at the beginning per others' suggestions and maybe cut a little of the cream cheese. Still a really good, easy recipe.

Flavorful and enjoyed recipe.  We need gluten-free, and I had a chicken/corn chowder soup on hand that was used in place of the condensed cream of chicken soup in the actual recipe.  This helped, since the GF pasta requires a lot more liquid/sauce.

This recipe was great and very easy to make! Granted its a little on the salty side, its ok to splurge every now and then. Its a nice change from traditional beef stroganoff.

This is so good you have to make it! I did put frozen chicken breats in the slow cooker with 1/2 c. chicken broth added to the margarine and dry italian dressing.  After 2 hours I went and cut up my chicken into cubes. I will be making again and again. The Italian dry dressing is what really gives it the flavor.  Also I did add 1/2 cup of sour cream to the cream cheese and soup mixture at the end because we just love the taste of sour cream in things. Yummm

My family loved this.  I used chicken thighs because my husband hates white meat.  I also used real butter and added some Pasta Sprinkle from Penzey's Spices in with the Italian Dressing mix.  The thighs cooked for 6 hours and then I cooked the cream cheese and soup in (with a can of mushrooms) while I made the egg noodles to serve it with.  Great reviews at the table!

I've made this twice now, and I'm amazed at the simplicity and the great flavor this recipe brings! The only addition I make is a can of cream of mushroom soup, as well as the cream of chicken. I also let the chicken cook in the soups for four hours on the low setting, and add the cream cheese the last half hour of cooking. Cheap, easy, and literally takes 3 mins to throw in the crock pot!

This was really good- I used a ranch packet instead of italian seasoning. I also dumped a package of sliced mushrooms in (a must for stroganoff!)

I liked the cooking technique....I used 2 lb of boneless skinless thighs.  Could use even more seasoning, though.  I added 1/2 a chopped onion and it could benefit from way more seasoning at the end.  but meat was tender and tasted good over noodles and it was simple, so 4 stars in all.

This was pretty tasty, but I think it had a bit too much cream cheese in it. I could only eat so much at a time, but I think if I add more chicken or just less cream cheese it would be fantastic!

This was so good!  Although I didn't make it with the full fat cream cheese, it still tasted delicious and very rich with fat free.  I actually cut the richness with some chicken broth because it was too creamy for my taste.  The chicken turned out so tender.  Only 2 hours needed if you cut the chicken into small bits.  I served with egg noodles.

Delicious as is, but I think I agree with the other reviewers who added a bit of white wine at the beginning.  It was wonderfully warm and filling as is, but a little thinning might be a good thing in warmer climates (like ours.)  But you can't beat the flavor with a stick!  Awesome meal, either way.

note to self: low for 4 or 5 hours, not high for 7!  I started burning it in the slow cooker.  It tasted good, but I am sure if cooked the way it should, it will taste even better!
I will have to try it with mushrooms added someday, too.

This was simply delicious. I added the chicken breasts whole, then shredded when I put in the cream cheese and soup. I also added some onion with the chicken, and an extra can of (cream of mushroom) soup at the end.

Was really great. Could have users little less cream cheese but still awesome. I mixed the egg noodles into the crockpot after I cooked them and coated it in the mix. Very tasty!

Really good but too salty.  Microwaved sliced mushrooms and added it the mix.  Next time will use less of the seasoning packet and will add a bit of sour cream.

Easy, delicious recipe.  I didn't have any dry Italian dressing mix so I used the bottled ingredients - still turned out great.  I also added about 1/2 cup of half & half, stirred and let it cook for a few minutes because I thought the sauce was too thick for my liking.  Also, I used the pre-cooked chicken strips that I had in my freezer.  Turned out wonderfully!  Will definitely make again!

Yummy & easy peasy!  
I used four frozen chicken breasts, threw them in whole and forgot the butter (I don't use margarine).  Added the butter after about three hours, when I realized it, so a couple end pieces were a little burnt.  I cooked on low for six hours (due to the chicken being frozen) then added the soup & cc.  
Served over whole wheat wide egg noodles and it was so fantastic!  
My house did not smell good as the chicken was cooking, but I think it might have been because there was no oils in the pot for the first few hours.  So that probably was my fault!

I followed this to a T.  I give it 2 stars because it was SOOOO salty, and I'm a salt-o-holic, STILL thought it was too salty.  I took some lemon juice to try to aid in ridding the salt, which helped some.  Think that I will try again using the lower sodium cream of chicken and also just use italian seasonings, not the kind for dressing.  But as is, way too salty.

Fantastic!  The flavor was good and it made us all say "yumm" after the first bite.  My 4-year old took one bite and said, "This is a yummy dinner, mom".  Definitely a keeper.

I made this recipe for dinner last night. My husband loves beef stroganoff, so I figured I'd give this one a try. It was very dissappointing. It didn't taste anything like stroganoff. My 3 year old refused to eat it. It had a funny after taste as well. I made it exactly as the recipe stated. I won't be keeping this one.

Really happy with the chicken browning in the crock pot.  I may implement this method (adding soup at end) in some of my other chicken slow cooker recipes.  Thank you for sharing!

We found it only tolerable. The Italian seasoning mix was way too strong and took over the whole meal. I wouldn't make it this way again.

I made this exactly as submitted and it was wonderful. No need to use only half a packet of the seasoning, as the flavor is mild in the end. Tons of sauce to put over noodles. Rich and creamy, a definite comfort food. And it couldn't be easier to make.

My son BEGS for me to make this dish.  I find that half a packet of Italian dsg is enough to season the whole dish.  I also throw in some frozen veggies with the soup and cream cheese.  We eat it over rice, noodles anything!  It tastes even better the next day!

This is a keeper!  It's one of those recipes that you can have fun with by adding your own ingredients to suit your taste buds.  Today I added some red pepper flakes, 1/2 C. white wine and some fresh chopped basil....YUM!  Next time I plan to add chopped garlic, onions and red bell pepper.  Thanks Judi Ann for sharing this!

I forgot to start this until late afternoon, so I cooked it on high for 1.5 hours and then 2 hours on low.  I used "zesty" Italian dressing mix, reduced-fat cream of chicken soup, 4 oz. cream cheese, and about 1/4 cup sour cream.  I'll make this again with these minor changes, but next time I'll use reduced-sodium soup to cut down on the saltiness.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  Followed directions exactly, except that I used reduced fat cream cheese and I added some fresh mushrooms in at the same time that I added the cream cheese & soup.  Served over egg noodles.  The whole family loved it & it was easy to make.

Yummy! This is extremely hearty and extremely easy to make. The cook time is just about perfect for the chicken and the sauce. I served it over egg noodles with homemade Russian Rye bread. The whole family loved it. However, the serving size that the recipe gives is way off. I followed the recipe exactly and, after two of us had second helpings, my family of three has more leftovers than we have tupper-ware (though we will enjoy eating said leftovers). 4/5

I made this two nights ago.  My husband is extremely picky about what he eats.  He likes everything plain and has very little variety in his meal selection.  Needless to say, he LOVED this!  And there were leftovers for him to take for lunch the next day.   Like other reviewers, I also left the chicken breast whole and shredded it later.  You will be very happy with this receipe!

Kept to original recipe, with the only change being adding 1/2 a block of cream cheese instead of the whole thing, and a couple of big dollops of sour cream to make up the difference.  Oh, and I added fresh chopped mushrooms as well, because I thought they would taste good with this recipe.  Serves over egg noodles.  It was very easy, house smelled amazing, and was extremely delicious!  This instantly goes into regular rotation.

This was pretty good! Oops - I forgot the butter, but added a few tsp of water along with the chicken and dressing.  I probably used half of the chicken suggested so the chicken was definitely done in under 3 hours - turned out great. I used half of the cream cheese and added a little milk I would definitley add sauteed mushrooms and possibly sauteed onion the next time...  I would make this again.

I was skeptical about following the directions to a tee since you don't add any liquid, but I did and I'm glad I did.  It was awesome!  I did add a can of mushrooms just because we like them. This is a definite keeper!!!

Very tasty as written. I tried a cold version by stirring in penne pasta and frozen peas to left over mixture, refrigerated it to eat as cold salad. Delicious!! Great this time of year.

This was really very good AFTER I thinned out the sauce with some chicken broth and added some salt. Otherwise it's CRAZY thick and pasty. My daughter ate 2 helpings! It was great and really very easy!

Huge hit with my family.  It isn't my favorite, but it has made it into my regular rotation based on how much the rest of my family likes it.  Two young boys and my wife love it!  And it is incredibly easy to make.  I strongly suggest everyone try this recipe.

I have made this so many times, and it is excellent! It reheats very well too. Learning that so little butter is all the moisture you need to cook meat in a slow cooker has been a revelation to me. Chicken with just a couple pats of butter, salt and pepper in the slow cooker is now THE way I make shredded chicken for any recipe I need. When I want different flavors, I try different dry mixes including dry pesto sauce mix and my favorite, Hidden Valley Ranch dry dressing mix. I love that you can put pre-cleaned frozen meat in and it works just as well.

I really liked this recipe.  It was total comfort food.  I added a splash of white wine in with the combination of chicken breast and thighs, butter, and italian seasoning mix.  Then with about 2 hours to go, I added 8 oz. of neufchatel/lowfat cream cheese, low sodium cream of chicken soup, and a can of sliced mushrooms, because stroganoff has to have mushrooms.  I continued to cook on LOW.  I served this over whole wheat penne pasta.  Delicious!

This is just fantastic!!  I used frozen chicken breast tenderloins.  I added 1 can each of the cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup. I added everything all at once except for the cream cheese. I thought it needed some more liquid so I added a splash of white wine.  Tenderloins cook much faster than breasts and it was done in about 4 hours. I mixed it up with penne pasta and my family gobbled it up! They loved it.  I will definately make it again.

Holy cow!! This was great!  We followed some of the suggestions and put a 1/2 cup of wine and the can of soup in at the beginning.  So tasty and I can't wait to make a double or triple batch so that I can freeze some for later!  Am also going to try this one with pork chops!

I followed this recipe exactly, except when i put the chicken, butter, and dry dressing in, i added about a half cup of white wine just because other cooks suggested it, and i was afraid the chicken would dry out or burn without enough liquid in the pot.  I also used regular cream of chicken instead of condensed, and it was fine. Overall this recipe is great for a quick dinner, and is very flexible (be great with peas, or tri colored frozen peppers or even fresh steamed broccoli)  the only downfall is that it isnt exactly the healthiest of recipes, but that can be fixed with low fat ingredients possibly. Its also very tasty and yummy and quick and kids will love!  We put it over egg noddles and had it with steamed vegetables.   Thx!

I was so wanting to like this dish. Following all the directions I found it to be very bland with cream cheese as an overly dominant taste. It was given a  low passing grade by the rest of the family but that's not enough to serve again. As always though, I appreciate the post.

A family favorite now.  I was a little skeptical at first but the reviews were all good... I did what one reviewer suggested and added nonfat cream cheese instead of regular, then added 1/4-1/3 C of wine at the same time.  I like the wine flavor and this was a big hit in my normally picky household.  Thanks!

This was really good.  I used frozen chicken breasts, low fat cream of chicken soup and low fat sour cream in place of the cream cheese.  I like the tanginess of sour cream plus I didn't have cream cheese.  Mine turned out fine and was not too salty.  The leftovers the next day were great and it tasted like chicken soup when I warmed it with leftover egg noodles.  Easy recipe and a keeper for those long days at work.

Delish!!!..I made this recipe & a while after it had started cooking.. I unexpectedly found out I had to feed 3 more people...so to make it go further...I added more chicken..I added pepper & a few other items like garlic, onion,& celery powder & paprika to make up for only having 1 pkg. of italian dressing on hand & the only other soup I had suitable was cream of celery..( I also added another 1/2 pkg. cream cheese)& I also sauteed onions & fresh mushrooms... served on the side..which we ended up mixing it all together anyways..as it was so tasty!..served over no yolks noodles...& with a salad...it was loved by all! my elderly dad had leftovers the next day..he loved it too! next time I would use low fat cream cheese & soup.

Used 2 seasoned chicken breasts, browned them (till no longer pink)in oil first. Added to slow cooker (soup & Italian seasoning, fried onions). Cooked on high for 1 hour, then turned to low. Added 1/2 cream cheese & 1/2 c. monterey jack cheese. Cooked addt'l 1/2 hour. Perfect for 2, and cut cook time way down.

Very good start to a great recipe!  After reading most of the reviews, I used only half a packet of the dressing mix, a can of soup, and 8 oz. of sour cream (to give it that strogonoff "tang").  I also added about 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup of chicken stock in the beginning only because I was at work and didn't want to have it get done too quickly.  I drained the juice, added the soup and sour cream, and added the juice a little at a time to get the right consistency.  Served mixed with egg noodles..was super good!  Will definitely make again!

Easy and really good! The only issue I had was that there wasn't enough of the excellent sauce, so my advice is double the ingredients to make plenty of the sauce...it will be perfection!

I read the other reviews and I, too, changed it up a bit.  I used Knorr's Vegetable Soup mix, 'cause that's what I had and I added a little wine and a little chicken broth(about 1/4 cup of each) to the mix in the crock pot.  Then when I got home and the mixture in the crock pot was done, I sauteed up some fresh sliced mushrooms in a little olive oil and wine....I added cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken to the crock pot mixture.....added only 4 oz of cream cheese and when the mushrooms were done I tossed those in and mixed it until it was all creamy, hot and mixed....then served it over hot, buttered noodles.  Very good!

This recipe is golden!  I knew it would be great an hour or so while cooking in my slow cooker.  The aroma was fantastic! The only addition I made was adding sauteed onions mentioned in earlier reviews.  At the beginning I put some chicken stock in with the chicken, dry salad dressing and sauteed onions because I was concerned that the chicken would dry out.  I also added some fresh garlic at some midpoint during the cooking. At the end, about an hour before serving, I whisked 4 ounces of fat free cream cheese with a can of  Cream of Chicken Soup (the low fat version)with a splash of milk. Will make it again and again!!!!!!!!!!

Pretty good.  Too salty as written though.  Even for me, as I am someone who isn't particularly watching their sodium intake, this was still WAY to salty.  I used lower sodium cream of chicken soup, and only half the packet of dressing mix.  Also I only used 4 oz of regular cream cheese to cut the fat.  I will probably make this again the lower sodium way. Thanks for the recipe.

This was my first slow cooker attempt - and now I'm happy I bought the cooker! This recipe was easy to make, delicious to eat, and was loved by my entire family. I added baby carrots, 1/2 cup of red wine, and onion soup mix rather than the Italian mix 'cause that's what I had. I used 4 whole breasts rather than cubbing it first. In the final 30 minutes, I added 1/2 cup of sour cream along with the stated ingredients.  Yum!

This is a great, easy recipe.  So rich and flavorful, great comfort food for winter!  The only change I made was to add 1/4 cup white wine along with the butter and chicken in the beginning.  I served it over pasta with mixed veggies for a complete meal.  ****11/10/10 UPDATE:  I made it healthier by only using 4 oz. light cream cheese and Amy's Organic Cream of Mushroom Soup.  It was still delish!

This recipe was nice - but I never like the way chicken turns out in the slow cooker. I followed the directions and it still fell apart. I think next time I'll grill the chicken and make the sauce on the stove top, with a bit more spice. All in all a nice meal though.

5 stars for simplicity AND taste!  I took advantage of a sale on boneless chicken breast, and I'm glad I did!  The two other packages will come in handy when I make this next time, since one package wasn't nearly enough for us!  I served with buttered egg noodles, and used slightly less than the whole package of dressing mix, but next time I will try with white rice and will use the entire package of dressing, in addition to throwing in some fresh broccoli during the last 45-60 minutes. Thank you!

I made the recipe exactly as is except for adding about 1/4 c. of chicken broth in the beginning with the margerine and Italian dressing mix.  Also, I only added 1/2 the packet of dressing (which turned out to be a smart move, in my opinion).  It came out PERFECTLY.  My husband and I both really enjoyed it and I will definitely be making it again.

This was a super easy weeknight meal.  Hubby and kids ate it right up.  I added some water since it seemed to be overly thick, about a quarter cup sour cream and some ground pepper. I only used 3/4 of the cream cheese brick as well. This was a great no-fuss meal.  It won't go in the meal rotation, but will be a nice change of pace every so often.

This recipe was very delicious and easy! I did add an extra can of cr. chicken because we like extra sauce for leftovers. Also added mushrooms at the end. Definitely a fav!

This was so good and easy! While it was cooking I added white wine and worchshire sauce. I also used (extra) butter in place of the margarine. At the end I added in a nice healthy does of sour cream and served it over egg noodles.

This recipe was easy, inexpensive and tasted delish.  The only change I made is that I used only about 4 oz cream cheese.  I served it over hot cooked noodles and with a side of cooked frozen sweet corn.  Could have added veggies to chicken mixture and served over biscuits for a mock-chicken pot pie.  I'll be making this again, I'm sure.

Absolutely delicious!  I read the other reviews and added 1 small can drained mushrooms and the 1/4 cup wine.  Very simple, yet delicious and elegant dish.  I served whole (not chopped) over the noodles and then the sauce over the noodles.  Also added couple of dashes of red crushed pepper.  Definitely a keeper!

this was incredibly salty.. i used the italian dressing mix recipe thats on this site that one user suggested using and i think thats what did it.. the salty stuff didnt want to mix with the non salted such as the oregano and so forth... 

i might make this again but i'll be modifying it quite a bit... 

also i didnt like how dry the chicken came out, the texture of it was too canned soupy.. maybe next time i make it i do it on the stove top instead of in the slow cooker...

This is one of the best slow cooker recipes I have tried.  My picky kids loved the chicken before adding the sauce.  I added frozen peas and served over egg noodles.

Fantabulous!  This was SUPER easy and pleased everyone from 22 mo to 34 yrs!  I think that everyone had seconds.  I did make a few simple changes, I used reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat cream of chicken soup. I also used chicken tenders instead of breasts.  Pretty darn good, and it didn't taste a bit like "low-fat" typically does.  2 thumbs way up! *** Revised: After making this a few times my family and I came to the conclusion that we needed to make it more "stroganoff"-like, so we used 4 oz of RF cream cheese and 4 oz of RF sour cream.  Delish!

I usually don't review that many recipes, but I felt I had to chime in with my praise of this recipe. Of course it's super easy with a minimum of ingredients, which is always a big plus in my household with little kids. It also tasted great, with everyone going back for seconds. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't really change a thing. The chicken ended up cooking a little less long at 4 hours, but was incredibly moist and tasty.
Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was awesome!  Even making my own spice mix (Italian Dressing Mix recipe from this site) this was crazy easy.  I was nervous about cooking the meat without liquid but it came out beautifully.  I swapped turkey breast cutlets for the chicken, just to use them up.  Next time I won't bother cutting them though - they fell apart when I stirred in the soup!  It did need a splash of milk to thin it a little to combine with the No Yolks dumplings and frozen peas I added at the end.  I'm looking forward to leftovers for lunch. :)

This was SO yummy!  I didn't have cream of chicken, so I substituted a can of cream of mushroom.  While I was at it, I added a can of sliced mushrooms!  I served it over rice that I cooked with some sliced green onions.  Oh my!  True comfort food!  And EASY!  It doesn't get any easier than this one!  A definite KEEPER!

This was a great recipe with no changes needed at all. I shredded the chicken before I put in the cream cheese and soup and while that was cooking the last 1/2 hour I cooked the noodles and added them to the mixture. My grandson even ate it and he doesn't eat much. This is a keeper!!

This is by far the best recipe I've tried in a long time!!  For once my ENTIRE family loved it.  We put it over rice and it was just absolutely amazing!  The picture doesn't do it justice.  It actually ends up looking a lot more appetizing that the picture shows!!  This is a KEEPER!!!

This smelled great while it was cooking and the sauce turned out quite good, but my chicken was so dry I ended up just eating around it.  It was pretty inedible, which was disappointing.  I might have cooked it slightly longer than it called for but it shouldn't have made THAT big of a difference.  I probably won't be making this again.

OMG, this is so good!!  I did make a few alterations though (some suggestions from other members).  I used 1 can each of cream of chicken and celery and only 4 oz of cream cheese and about 1/4 of milk....but the big change (totally unintentional) was I had to use a different seasoning because I was out of the italian seasoning so I used Zatarans Cajun Seasoning, about 3tbs.  The "kick" that is cajun spice gave it was unbelievable.  I served this over pasta (although I would like egg noodles better i think) along with salad and garlic butter and bread.  This was so awesome that my sons girlfriend (who let me tell you never eats) ate it up!!  Thanks so much for the fab recipe!!

Pretty good, we enjoyed it.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and omitted the butter (I'm on WW) for FF chicken broth.  I'd like to make it a bit more tangy but otherwise it was excellent.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was really good.  My husband and 10 month old both enjoyed it, as did I.  I did make a few small changes.  Instead of putting just the chicken cubes, butter, and seasoning in the crockpot to begin, I also added several splashed of chicken broth (maybe 1/2 cup or so) because I was worried about cooking it for 5 hours with no liquid.  Then after only 3 hours, I added the soup and let it cook another 30 min, then added the cream cheese, and let it melt (about 10-15 more min.)  It was really good.  I served it over rice.

I made this for my husband and I.  It turned out very good!  I cooked it in the crock pot with some butter spread,about 3/4 of a packet of dry italian dressing, the cream of chicken soup, and about a 1/2 cup of white wine. I also added about a teaspoon of garlic powder and ground pepper.  I used 8 1/2 boneless chicken breasts.  I only used 1/3 of a block of reduced fat cream cheese.  It turned out great served over egg noodles.

Excellent recipe!  I made a few alterations as other people suggested.  I used 1/4 cup of white cooking wine, 1/2 cup of chicken broth, and low sodium cream of chicken soup with my 4 defrosted/cubed chicken breasts.  I let all of that cook for 3.5 hours on low.  I then added lite cream cheese, and about a 1/3 cup of lite sour cream, letting that cook on high for a half hour.  When it was complete, I put the mixture over wheat egg noodles and viola!  It was an excellent, no hassle meal!  Would highly recommend!!!!!!

This was wonderful and so easy too!  I did use 4 oz of sour cream instead of 8 oz of cream cheese and 1/8 cup of water instead of the butter.  Threw everything in the crockpot at once except the sour cream.  Served over noodles.  This is definitely a keeper!

My husband loved this.  I've been asked to make this several times since the 1st time I fixed it.  The only problem I have is that sometimes the chicken feels a little dry.

This was very tasty but a bit to rich, will cut back a bit on the cream cheese next time. Hubby and I liked it, but 2 teen boys hated it. Was  much better over noodles then rice. (made the rice gummy)Will make again when the kids aren't home

We LOVED the taste of this recipe, and I LOVED how extremely easy it was to make!  Since I try to cook health conscious, I altered the recipe slightly, using the 98% fat free soup, and only used a half package of the 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  I am going to make this again next week, and very often.  Thank so much for a recipe that will become a regular in my kitchen!

Very easy!  Great for those soccer nights! Kids and husband loved it(the three toughest critics around!)  A word of caution though, this is definately a rich meal.  Very heavy.  Not for the one watching their fat intake.  Anything served w/ it must be light.  (white rice, small salad, white wine)

I made it exactly as directed, always comes out great. However this time my chicken breast were frozen cause I had waited a little to late in the day to start. So i just thawed chicken a little in the microwave. Cooked onions with butter, cream cheese and soup in a separate pot. Then creamed together &  put it all in crock pot on high for 2 hours! Just before  I top it over egg noodles I always drizzle a little olive oil & a pinch of Italian seasonings on noodles & toss. Yum!

We just love this recipe.  I have been making this for a few years now and I always follow another reviewers suggestions.  I use both cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soups, omit the margarine and use only half of the Italian dressing mix.  During the last hour of cooking,  I add fresh sliced mushrooms, 4 oz Neufchâtel cheese and 1/4 cup sour cream.  Delicious!

I've made this a dozen times over the past year or so, never twice exactly the same and all were great. The one currently in the slow cooker has five large chicken breasts (we love leftovers frozen in microwaveable containers with sufficient cooked rice to feed the two of us). I cubed the chicken while it was still somewhat frozen. I also use cream of mushroom soup rather than chicken and even thrrow in an extra can of mushrooms. I cook it on low for 7 hours to make up for the extra as well as some extra stirring that I can't resist. Wife's whole extended family seek invites when they know I am making it.

Wonderful! Did as a few reviewers said - halved the cream cheese and added some milk.  Super creamy still and maybe a little too salty.  Maybe less seasoning or even adding my own spices next time instead.  Very tasty!! Husband and toddler gobbled it up & had seconds!  Thanks for the tasty recipe!  First time making stroganoff!@

I make this all the time for my family. To help tone down the saltiness of the original recipe, we add a few tablespoons of Ranch dressing (the actually dressing, not the packet). It adds good flavor without the saltiness. Also, for a little extra flavor and a little extra liquid, we add a can of cream of celery soup. To finish it up, we add a pound of egg noodles one hour before the dish is supposed to be done (when you add the cream cheese and soups), to give it that stroganoff feel. If you're running short on time, you can cook it on high for 2.5 hours and still add the noodles, cream cheese, and soup an hour before it's going to be done.

This was very good and so simple to make! I did everything as instructed, except I used low sodium cream of mushroom soup in place of the cream of chicken, and then I added some canned mushrooms on top of that. I really enjoyed the mushroom substitution because I think it brings the taste a little closer to a classic stroganoff recipe.

AMAZING!  I made a few changes-- used Lipton onion soup mix instead of the Italian dressing mix.  Reduced the cream cheese to half and added about 3/4 cup reduced fat half & half.  I also just shredded the chicken after it cooked rather than cube it.  I served it over thick German spaetzle-style noodles. My husband & kids love this so much, they want it once a week for dinner.  It's a kid pleaser for sure!  By the way, I have also made this in a pot on the stove and it turns out just about the same as the slow cooker!

My husband and I loved this very easy and most flavorful crockpot meal. I added fresh mushrooms to the recipe as well as a splash of red wine to the chickrn as someone else had mentioned. Follow the recipe as written. Don't add any liquids to the chicken in the beginning, other than the splash of wine.
I will definitely make this recipe again.

This is so delicious. Not sure if it reminds me of "stroganoff" but it doesn't matter because it is amazing. It's good over rice as well as noodles. I always use the low fat cream of chicken and the 1/3 less fat cream cheese and I don't feel like it has any kind of negative effect on the flavor at all, it's very rich.

So easy to make! Family loved it. I ended up putting ½ cup light sour cream at the end because it was really THICK, but that's completely up to you. Next time I'll try using cream of mushroom soup and slicing up some mushrooms. I try to stay true to the recipe the first time around.

This was ok. I was hoping for something more but it served it's purpose. It was definitely really salty. Adding some sour cream as others suggested did help that a bit, and added to the flavor and creaminess. Prolly won't be making again.

Very good! I did substitute the dry italian dressing packet for actual italian dressing because I didn't have the packet other than that made it just the way the recipe called for. I did cook the chicken butter and dressing on high for the first 2 hours stirring occasionally and put it down to low after the chicken was cooked then I added the soup and cream cheese put it back on high. Cooked the egg noodles then added them to the crock pot and added a bit of milk to make more sauce and cream. Added a bit of seasonings and pepper. Served with steamed broccoli.  Soo good! Will definitely be making again!

I thought this recipe was a nice base for a great meal. I added peas to the mix, just for color, and served it over egg noodles. Taste was great, easily made, and next time Im going to experience with spices to spice it up a bit.

Made almost exact to the recipe and this was amazing! (I like to try the recipes as is before modifying them) 
The only thing I did differently was used butter instead of margarine because we don't have margarine.  Despite the chicken burning due to lack of liquid when first cooking, this was amazingly delicious.  

I would only change how the chicken is cooked.  it burned for me with only butter and the dressing packet.  I might add some water just to coat the bottom of the pot...not sure yet how I will do this, but I will 100% make it again.

This was aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazingggggggggggggg!!!!!!!!!!!
Only thing I did differently was put the cut up chicken in a plastic bag and mixed the seasoning with a little olive oil and the seasonings and about 5 cloves of garlic(I love garlic) and let that marinate over night.  I didn't use any butter.

Then I threw the rest in a few minutes before serving.
Great over egg noodles.

It was absolutely delicious!! I even loved the chicken before I added the soup and cream cheese. Ok so I used the onion soup/dip mix instead of Italian salad dressing mix. It was really saucy but I think that's because I ate a lot of the chicken by itself before adding the soup and cream cheese. I am going to use just the chicken next time for tacos or even enchilada's. Im thinking of adding broccoli next time too. I am putting this recipe on an index card for easy future use.

This was Fantastic!!!! I added 1/2 the seasoning as some reviews stated it was too salty otherwise. Next time i think i'll use the whole pack. It was not salty at all!  I also added the soup the last 1/2 hour. It turned out perfect! I served it over egg noodles. My husband and 2 young kids loved it! Just writing this review is making me crave this recipe again! So yummy!!!!!!

Fantastic! But I didn't slow cook..no time.  So, I used already cooked and cubed chicken breast and cream of mushroom soup...a can of sliced mushrooms, butter, cream cheese and ¾ cup of Caesar salad dressing with a teaspoon of italian seasoning and ¼ cup of wine.  Mixed all together well, then added the chicken and let cook on stove for about a half hour.  Served over egg noodles.  DELISH!

This was salty!  But maybe it was the seasoning packet I used.  It's also very similar to the Slow Cooker Chicken Tetrazzini recipe on this site.  The only difference is this one requires you to cut the chicken up first and does not use chicken broth.  I always love it the first night, but the flavor is too much the second night, and I beg my husband to eat it so I don't have to.

This was really very good!  I did make a couple of changes.  Added about 1/2 cup minced onion with the chicken.  And when I added the soup etc I also added 1 cup sliced mushrooms.  Served it over fettuccini noodles.  Will certainly make again!

I like some vegetables of some sort.  Added some diced bell pepper and onion to the mix...  about a 1/4 of an onion and 1/2 a bell pepper.  Added some black pepper and garlic salt to taste near the end...  Used low sodium soup and it wasn't nearly as salty as some said.  But everyone has different tastes!

Really good.  Between chicken and beef I can't go wrong.  Of course, some like one or the other better. I have made both and will keep making both often.

This is the first time I ever tried "low moisture" cooking in the crock pot. The taste of the chicken was AMAZING, as if I had browned it perfectly myself. I would echo the sentiments expressed elsewhere:  there is NO NEED TO CHANGE a thing here, unless you want to use low- or non-fat soup and cream cheese.  Simple, yet delicious!!

This was very good and easy. I made changes, although I think I stayed true to the concept. I used homemade cream of chicken soup base. I also used the Italian Dressing Mix recipe from this website. I used Neufchatel instead of full fat cream cheese. I added some mushrooms. It sounds like a lot of changes, but they're all very slight variations. The basic idea of this recipe is enough to keep me coming back.

Very good, and easy. My slow cooker runs hot, so I added some water so the chicken wouldn't dry out. At the end, when I was adding the condensed soup and cream cheese it was very thick, so I added some milk. Will make again.

This is soooo good!  First, I like to try the recipe exactly as written, so I put in the chicken, seasoning, and butter and cooked as written.  Honestly, do not put the soup in in the beginning...the chicken will not have the flavors cooked into it as intended if you do and I feel the flavor will be more dull.  There was plenty of natural juices with the butter to cook the chicken without drying.  After 5 hours I put in the whole chunk of softened cream cheese with the soup and stirred.  Now at this point I made 1 adjustment only because I felt the mixture was thicker than I would like, so I added 1/3 cup chicken broth and let it cook for a half hour. It was amazing!  No leftovers as we ate ourselves sick!  Will definitely make again.

I followed this recipe exactly as written, except I cooked it on high the entire time (I started it way too late, and it was my first meal being made in a slow cooker). It was delicious. Even my picky brother loved this. I would love to add some white wine next time, as I think it would be delightful.

Made it today and the family loved it!! Didn't change the recipe at all.  I was a little uneasy about not adding any liquid at the start but went along with recipe as written and was pleasantly surprised!  This is definitely one of the easiest dishes to make and will surely make again!!

So good! I did four thighs and one breast and shredded when adding the cream cheese and soup. I also added mushrooms I was trying to use up. One my new favorite dishes. Husband, who is not fond of mushrooms, had seconds!

My only complaint with this recipe is the nightmarish amount of sodium, but other reviews have addressed that issue fairly well. I've made this probably half a dozen times and have found that how salty it tastes is largely dependent on what brand of salad dressing mix you use. If you find it too salty, try stirring in sugar and/or lemon juice a half teaspoon at a time until the flavors are more balanced. If you don't think of this recipe until a couple of hours before dinner, it also works on the stovetop as long as you watch it carefully and keep the heat fairly low.

A little too salty, and I like salty. I will try to omit the butter and cut back on the dressing mix next time. Needs more cream so maybe add in some milk at the end.

Waaaay too salty - even my kids 11 and 6 year olds couldn't handle how salty this was. I would definitely cut down on the cream cheese, probably to half the called for amount.  And I would find a low-sodium substitute for the called for condensed cream of chicken soup.  I would not make this recipe again without making some major modifications.  Sorry recipe owner!

I made this dish a few weeks ago and it was simply amazing.  My wife and I were both a little surprised at the amount of flavor this dish has considering the only seasoning in it is the Italian dressing mix. I made this exactly as the recipe stated with just 1 exception.  I added 1/2 cup of chicken broth to the chicken in the beginning due to the thickness of the sauce being a common concern/complaint in a lot of the comments I read.  The sauce was the perfect consistency when it was done. We would definitely be making this again.

Was pretty good but very rich! I ended up adding some chicken broth half way through to add some liquid. Also my sauce did not turn out a nice creamy colour - the chicken/butter burned a little and ended up making the sauce brown. This recipe was ok! Tasty but rich from the cream cheese.... Might consider using less than a whole brick if I make again!

Nice addition to my main meal recipes. Didn't have time to put in the crockpot but still worked fine on stovetop. I did add another can of cream of chicken soup, a little milk and sprinkles of Italian seasoning and garlic. I needed a little more than the original recipe made and wanted it a little thinner. Thanks!

Wow, this really works in the slow cooker! I've been making this same thing for years, but by tossing cut up chicken with dressing mix to coat, brown it in tbsp. butter and tbsp. olive oil in skillet, meanwhile heat cream cheese and soup in microwave until cream cheese melts, stir to combine, and then add cooked chicken to sauce. So I had some doubts about it turning out as well with the slow cooker method, but it worked great! The chicken pieces did brown a little, and I used 2 tbsp. butter not margarine.

Loved the flavor of this!  My hubby loved it too, which is great since I sent it for his lunch.  

I did make a little change to it, I thought it was really thick so I added about 1/3 c milk.  Next time I make it, and yes there will be a next time, we are going to try using light cream cheese and see how it goes.

This was pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly except for a splash of white wine when I put the chicken in. I would have liked a little more spice - next time I will add red pepper or something. However, I made it when my boyfriends kids were here so it was probably better not to be spicy - they all had second helpings.

This is probably a 5 star recipe. How good can it be if I use fat free or 1/3 fat cream cheese and low fat or healthy choice cream of mushroom? But hubby still ate it and he's a "high fat meal" kind of guy. I will make this many more times. Thanks!

I also thought this recipes was salty. I followed the recipe exactly as stated, and really hoped on liking it based on the reviews. I noticed other reviewers say they tried using low sodium chicken soup, which I did also. I noticed that on the Italian seasoning packet, the first two ingredients are sugar and salt! So I may try it one more time, and season it myself with various Italian herbs or some onion with the chicken.

This is wonderful! I used cream of mushroom soup, 4 oz. cream cheese and 4 oz. sour cream(both light or reduced fat versions; what I had on hand. I read a few of the reviews and decided to give it a try and I'm so glad I did. Follow the recipe and don't add soup until you are supposed to; it turned out great. Hubby said put this in the make again recipe file. I love slow cooker and crock pot dishes. It is so good to come home to a meal or dish ready to eat. I tried to make this once before but my crock pot quit working and ruined the whole thing. Aug 25 2014 - I make this about once a month and we had this again tonight. I must say it is superb. Creamy sauce with chicken that taste like it was roasted in the oven over noodles or rice (great either way). If I could give it 10 stars I would! Thanks Judi Ann for this keeper!

I just made this at work for a potluck. I was able to find all the ingredients at a nearby store (T*****) :) I doubled the recipe, and cooked it on high for 3.5 hours (NO lifting of the lid). After reading the reviews I only used half the amount of cream cheese. I changed nothing else. It cooked perfectly, falling apart (but still intact) tender little bites of chicken. I did check with a thermometer and it was up to temperature - 165 degrees. It was gone in 1 hour. I will say, there was too much sauce for the chicken, no big deal, but I might use half the amount of soup next time. I think this would be good with Rotel too. It's important to use the .7 ounce packet of Italian dressing mix, not the other size. I even got a compliment and a request for the recipe!

Tasty flavor! I followed the directions pretty closely except I added 1/2 can milk and a dollop of light sour cream + sauteed mushrooms and onions. The chicken ended up overcooked and dry -- 5 hours is too long. Next time I will try putting in everything at the beginning.

No changes, just doubled the recipe. My husband said its one of the 10 best things I've ever made.  My mother-in-law complemented the flavor several times during the meal.  Both kids loved it!

Complete success!!!! I made a few changes. I seasoned the diced chicken with the italian dressing mix powder, but then i added 1/3 cup of marsala cooking wine, 1 can of fat free cream of chicken, 1 can of fate free mushroom. Mixed it all together and let it cook on a high for 2.5 hrs. Once the chicken is no longer pink and the soup is mixed/heated well I diced up a black of low fat cream cheese and added it to the chicken mixture in the pot. Mixed it really well when the chunks of cheese melted easily. Let is cook on low for 30 more mins and it was done. A huge hit my 5 yr old son, his babysitter and her friend. Hubby liked it too. Definitely will make this again.

Cooked it on low in the crockpot for 7 hours with 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 can of cream of mushroom, a packet of zesty ranch powder, 1 cup of water  & a small can of mushrooms. Added a block of cream cheese at 8 hours melting it into the sauce then pouring it over egg noodles. Yum!!!

This is really, really good!  I made this for dinner and we hadn't thought to start it before work, so I cut the chicken into really small pieces and turned the crock pot on high for about two hours.  That was enough to cook the chicken and then we added the soup and cheese.  After about an hour it was ready to go!  It made enough for eight servings, but after my son and his friend tried it, I ended up only serving the four of us with one serving left over. :)  Other than adding about 1/2 cup of water to thin the sauce and stretch it a tad, I followed the recipe exactly.  We'll definitely make this again...and again!

Made this yesterday for my husband and he absolutely loved it! I'd say I loved it too, but I barely got any before he ate almost all of it. Love how simple it is but packs a ton of flavor.  This one is definately going into the regular rotation!

This is crazy good. Amazingly easy and basically my husband wanted to bathe in it. Next time I will add some sauteed mushrooms and onions to give it just a little bit more texture. I will also lessen the amount of cream cheese.

This was good.  I modified it according to other reviews and substituted half the cream cheese for sour cream.  I also added 8 oz mushrooms, 2 tsp worchestire, and 1/2 onion.  I just added whole frozen chicken breasts and shredded them after it cooked.  I made my own dry Italian style dressing from allrecipes but added no salt.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I almost panicked when I left the chicken in the crock pot with the tiny amount of butter, but all these reviews reassured me that it would turn out great, and it did. My husband even said this was my favorite chicken dish I have made to date, so this one is definitely a keeper.

I had to give this poor recipe quite a tweak. It was far to thick as written. I added 1 cup of 1% milk, I used Neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese and butter instead of margerine. I also added brocolli and corn to it. I also added pepper. I gave this 2 stars as written and I was feeling kind of bad about it until I read the other reviews. Almost No one made this as written. Im not up-rating something I had to fix.

An exceptional recipe to use as a base. I combined frozen chicken tenderloins, fresh sliced mushrooms, a 1/2 stick of butter, a can of cream of chicken, a can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic, a packet of Italian seasoning, and a 1/4 cup of Marsala wine into the crock pot and set it on low for 5 hours. I then added 8 oz of cream cheese and allowed the flavors to blend for another hour before serving over hot cooked, whole wheat egg noodles. It was the perfect comfort food for a cold, blustery winter day.

This was great!! The only thing I did a bit different was I added green onions and some fresh parsley. I let the chicken cook for about 2 hours, then added the condensed soup. I used low-fat cream cheese and next time would use low sodium soup. I put it over white rice and it was just fabulous.

Good recipe but very rich. Next time I would either use low fat cream cheese or low fat chicken soup. Great with a green salad and a french loaf.

This was very good.  I wanted something green with the meal, so I added a few frozen peas near the end of cooking.  Otherwise, I did just as the recipe said.

There's a good chance I'll make this again.

I found this long lost recipe and made it again.  This time I didn't have a package of seasoning mix, so I made this one (reducing salt to 2 tsp, not 2 T): http://allrecipes.com/recipe/25171/italian-dressing-mix/ and used 2 T of it.  It was good.  I served with egg noodles and vegetables.  It's nice to have an easy, throw-in-the-crockpot recipe sometimes.

This was so tasty and easy to make it.  Threw it in the crock pot yesterday AM; then added the soup , cream cheese; and added some milk to make it the right consistancy.  Served over noodles.  Yummy.  One thing was - did not have the Dressing; but really wanted to make this.  So I went to this site and search and found the 'Italian Dressing Mix' cut it in half and used that recipe.  I did not use the salt and was not needed.  Will make again.

This is my go-to slow cooker recipe! I add mushrooms and a yellow onion, and really you could add any type of veggie that you and your family enjoy. I also like adding a jar of Philadelphia Italian Herbs & Cheese Cooking Creme, which adds a nice extra bit of creaminess and flavor. It is just delicious. You can serve it over any pasta or rice...you can eat it all on its own...you can sub chicken thighs (cheaper)...and you can even sub a variety of low-fat items to make it healthier. Turns out great every time!

This recipe was really simple, and delicious! I served it over egg noodles, and it was great. I think the next time I make it, I will add a cup of sour cream, just to give it a more traditional stroganoff tangy-ness. I also added a bit more margerine, 1/4 cup, rather than 1/8. The packet of Italian dressing mix really added flavor. I will definitely make this one again!

I took the advice of some previous raters, I used 1/4 cup white wine vinegar, sliced up onion and shallots, celery and carrots, placed all of it on the bottom, then i used chicken breast and sliced them up into chicken finger size and added the butter and Italian seasoning(I mixed them together as well) and poured it on top along with 2 of the knorrs chicken stock, along with pepper, minced onion, paprika and a dash of sea salt. when the chicken was done, I then shredded them into bite size pieces, added the cream cheese and 2 cans of condensed chicken soup, with parsely, a pinch of cajun seasoning, montreal chicken seasoning, and a bit more pepper and paprika, and added a bag of mixed veggies-peas, carrots, corn and beans. made some egg noodles-and OMG! The chicken was moist, gravy was delicious! I will make this again and again, but maybe make some mashed potatoes for the yummy gravy or add them to the crock pot! My boyfriend loved this dish! and it was even better the next day when I had it for lunch!

Made this for dinner yesterday for company and everyone had seconds!  I used cubed chicken and half a packet of Italian dressing mix as suggested by others with some melted Smart Balance.Also added a bit of red wine I was trying to get rid of as well as some carrots and chopped onions. House smelled amazing! Cooked on low for 3 1/2 hours then added a brick of low fat cream cheese, a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of cream of chicken mixed with some milk. Also added some minced garlic, black pepper, parsley, and peas and kept it on low for about 30 minutes. Had to keep adding milk as the sauce was a bit thick. Served over whole wheat egg noodles. Will definitely be making this again!!!

Very good! I would change only 2 things: I'd add a little more liquid (water of chicken broth) because the chicken was a little dry and/or less cooking time than 6 hours. It really only needs 5 hours tops. Other than that, it's delicious! I made my own Italian dressing seasoning.

So easy and so delicious! Like another reviewer, I also added about 3/4 cup of wine while the chicken was cooking for added flavor. Next time I will probably add a little bit of pepper. Great recipe!

I had been really excited to make this but I did not care for it.  I made it exactly as the recipe read and 5 hours was way too long for the chicken.  I had to pick out the burnt rubbery pieces before adding the sauce.  The sauce was thick and pasty and tasted really bland.  If I were ever to make this again, I'd only cook the chicken for 3 1/2 hours.  I'd add some white wine and fresh mushrooms to give it more flavor.

I made this as submitted and it was OK. Not bad but it seemed a bit on the bland side to me and for whatever reason, the chicken was very watery when I went to add in the cream cheese/ soup mixture. I will keep this, though, because it was easy and I didn't have to fuss with it. Next time, I may add some onions in and perhaps a bit of garlic. I served it over cooked orzo with chopped parsley on top. Upside- there was ALOT left over for munching the next day.

Easy to make and quite good. I used 3/4 of the cream cheese and added 2 Tbs spoons of sour cream, healthy choice cream of chicken soup and a couple splashes of white wine and some cracked pepper. All over No Yolks noodles. Crushed red pepper flakes on mine. Yum.

This is a keeper!!  I added a small chopped sweet vidalia and a couple chopped stalks of celery, placing them on the bottem of the slow cooker.  I also mixed some chicken bouillon granules in about a cup of hot water where I mixed in the packet of salad dressing and the margerine.  I poured that on top of the chicken.  I followed the recipe from that point on.  We served it over rice.  It was soooooo good.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

If you tweak this recipe, its excellent, but as written, it barely deserves 2 stars.  5 hours is way too long to cook chicken with only 1/8 teaspoon of butter and some seasoning.  The chicken got extremely dry and tough.  After I added the other ingredients the flavors were really good, but the overcooked chicken ruined it.  Try Jennie's Heavenly Slow Cooker chicken from this site.  Its much better.

This was very easy and tasty too.  Both boys and husband liked it a lot.  Only made a couple of changes.  Added a splash of white wine to butter and italian dressing mix.  I used home made cream of mushroom instead of canned because I didn't have any canned soup.  I added the soup after about an hour instead of at the end too.  It was a bit thick so next time I'll add about 1/4 c of milk.  Thanks for sharing.

The dish is very easy to make on the run for a busy weekday. Family loved it adding it to the list of favorites. 
I did make a few changes and mixed the soup in with the chicken and and added 1/4 C of milk to make it a little creamy for the egg noodles to soak up.

I actually didn't find the taste or texture to be very good- it was thick and didn't have much flavor. I would have preferred sour cream instead of cream cheese with this, and I didn't actually like the flavor of the italian dressing on it. Will not make again.

I made this ... it was just OK... not nearly worthy of a 5 star.. I think Pat's Creamy Chicken is much better.. This is similar but using dried italian dressing w/o the cut up celery & onions...

This was VERY good and I will definitely make again.  I added 1/2 lb. fresh sliced mushrooms, sauteed with 1/2 med-lg. sliced onion the last 30 minutes of cooking, along with the soup and cream cheese.  I thought it neede a little sour cream, so I added about 2 Tbs., along with 1/2 tsp. paprika and some parsley flakes.  Served over hot egg noodles with a green salad.

5 stars for simple and tasty! I used low fat soup and fat free cream cheese.  The second time I added mushrooms, broccoli, and sundried tomatoes and served over rice.  A good meal with almost no effort!

This was okay, but not as good as I would have hoped for and I'm not sure I would make it again without reading all the reviews and trying to pizazz it up a bit. Maybe add some corn or something?

This is in our dinner rotation! I usually cant find dry italian style dressing  mix so i use onion or mushroom & onion. You can add or spice it up in alot of ways or make it just as is. I usually serve it over rice from the rice cooker making it a very easy meal. GREAT comfort food!

While my children loved it, which should give it a 5 star rating right there, I felt it was a little blah tasting.  It definately needed something more, pepper or something.  The first bite was good, but after that the taste was blah.

I added a can of chicken noodle soup, minus the noodles, because I didn't have chicken broth.  IT TURNED OUT AMAZING!  My husband said it tasted like something his grandmother used to make.  Will DEFINITELY make again!

Flavorful and easy.  This is a great meal for the nights that you are rushed or just don't feel like cooking.  Adding white wine takes it to a much more desirable level.

Another fantastic slow cooker recipe. I didn't make any alterations to it, but I do suggest softening the cream cheese in the microwave before mixing it with the soup. I didn't do it when I made it and I had some lumps in it. I had to take the chicken out and whisk it to smooth everything out. Even my son (8 years old) liked this one and he doesn't like anything with a sauce on it (unless it's spaghetti). In fact, he liked it so much he said "Mom, you should enter a cooking contest. This is great!" :) I definitely recommend this one for a twist on the standard beef stroganoff.

Pretty good I even add some mushrooms and sometimes switch the season packets. I've also tried it with a ranch dressing packet like it that way too.

Easy to make and tastes good.  I can't give it 5 stars because I altered the recipe. I didn't have a packet of salad dressing, so I had to make my own (Italian Dressing mix from this site). I took about 2 tbsp of the salad dressing mix and mixed it with a tbsp of olive oil and white wine vinegar.  I used a bag of frozen chicken tenders and it took about 5 hrs to cook (I did the last hour on high). I will make this again since it was pretty easy and still tasted good. I served with green beans and buttered bread.

Great recipe! Came out just perfect and I followed the directions. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that is was super salty. But my family and I love salty food so we liked it, just doesn't seem like a very healthy meal. I did add some frozen peas and sliced fresh mushrooms at the end and I thought that was a good call.

I cooked it less time, and it turned out yummy. We used Cream of Mushroom instead of Cream of Chicken. We also added mushrooms, and ate it over egg noodles. Only change I would make would be using 1/2 of the Italian seasoning packet, as it tasted a bit salty.

I made this for my boyfriend for the first time the other day, and we both LOVED it!! The only changes I made was to add a few dashes of red wine and doubled the butter in the crockpot. The chicken came out sooo tender and the sauce was to die for!

This is an okay dish that I will probably attempt again with some more seasonings.  If you like Northern very bland type food, this is it.  It is okay, but just not very flavorful for us Southern folks.  I also had to stop cooking after 4 hours, and even then the chicken was already over-cooked.  The good news is it is a very simple and quick meal.

Amazingly good and easy! My wife raved about it for DAYS!!

My obligatory revisions:  I used 5 pounds of chicken thighs with the skin removed--this was from a 10-lb bag of chicken quarters, but I saved the drumsticks for another dish.

To this, I added two packages of dry Italian dressing mix (store brand), 1/4 cup butter (yes, butter) and let it cook for about six hours on low.  I then added two cans of cream of chicken soup and only one brick of cream cheese, and let it cook on high for about another hour.

The chicken bones from the thighs just add a little more body to the sauce.

Served over hot rice with a slice of homemade sourdough bread on the side.

To quote my DW: To. Die. For. :-)

I am a dedicated & unapologetic food snob.  I normally eschew anything w an ingredient that reads "cream of _______." But I was trying to come up w something my 10yo niece could learn to cook & this seemed to fit the bill nicely.  I fully expected it to be edible but unremarkable.  I was wrong! It was really very tasty.  We doubled the amount of chicken & it came out just fine.  And to keep it really kid easy I had her put whole frozen chicken breasts into the slowcooker & just ran it on low for about 6h.  Didn't even bother to cube the chicken - everyone was just served a breast w the sauce over some egg noodles.  Not a bit was left! To jazz it up a bit I might throw in 1/2 C white wine in the future.

This is some comfort food right here! The chicken gets very flaky and tender. A little on the dry side but you can add milk or cream to thin it out at the end of cooking.

Simple comfort food. Simple to throw together. I used frozen chicken breasts, and (accidentally) only 4 oz of cream cheese.  I sort of shredded up the chicken while I was stirring up the sauce, but next time I will try to keep it more intact - I think it would look more appetizing.

Love this recipe! I have made it countless times and it always turns out great. The reviewers who add the soup or some other liquid to the chicken, margarine and dressing at the beginning are really missing out. If you follow the recipe as written, the chicken is so flavourful (and the house smells great when it is cooking).

Great and EASY dish!!  Kids and husband loved it, which says alot because they are very very picky.  I did add the soup at the beginning, and I added about 1/3 cup of milk.  Other than that, I did the recipe as called for.  I served it over rice and it was a hit!!

This is absolutely amazing!!!! So flavorful and easy. My only suggestion: Make extra, your family will devour this!!!! Those that are complaining about it being too salty or slimy...simply cut back on the seasoning and adjust the cooking time. Some Crock Pots are just different. You can also cut the cream cheese in half and perhaps just use a little cream instead to scale back the rich flavor.

Part 2: Since making this the first time, I have recently began watching my calories. My suggestion for all you weigh watchers: Eliminate the margarine and use reduced fat cream of chicken. I'd keep the creamed cheese full fat, as this can really molest the flavor. Also, the calorie count does not include the pasta. I simply added my pasta (about three or four cups) and then spread the recipe out over 8 servings versus 4. Only 259 calories a serving including the pasta! I hope this helps.

I fixed this recipe as listed except I put 4 frozen chicken breast in crock pot then added seasoning and butter. When I got home I shredded the chicken put in cream cheese and soup. Put on low while I boiled no yolk noodles. Stirred then served! It was awesome! Will make again and again!

I changed up the recipe using several other reviewers ideas.  Instead of margarine I used butter.  I added 1/2 cup of white wine with the chicken/butter/italian seasoning.  I used Reduced fat cream cheese.  This is one of the best crock pot chicken recipe's I've ever made.  Everyone (including my picky son) loved it!  I will definitely be making this again.

This was fantastic!  I doubled the chicken (large family) used one pkg. of cream cheese, two cans of chix soup and added some peas.
Loved by all!  I only wish I had this recipe earlier this year!

This was a huge hit at my house!! Its a plus because it cooked while I was at work - woo hoo. The only thing I did a little bit different was instead of a block of cream cheese I used the NEW cream cheese cooking creams - the original flavor. It was very creamy and delicious! My picky eater even wanted to take leftovers in her lunch the next day.

YUM... I make the same thing but call it Creamy Italian Chicken and serve over rice or noodles.  I omit the margarine and do not cube the chicken. I put in chicken breasts that are still frozen and then shred up before I put in the cream cheese and cream of chicken soup.

I thought it was great a change from hamburger or beef. The thing I did to shorten the time was precooked my chicken then cut it up and put all to gether except sour cream on high for about 1 hr. then served over noodles or rice your choice.

I was real excited to try this recipe!! I made it today going on instinct since Ia m not eating any typ eof meat during lent. I did not have the Italian dressing mix on hand so I used a package of green onion mix instead and also added in a splash of white wine along with the butter. After about 30 minutes I went ahead and added in some Italian Season Seasoning(maybe about a teaspoon). I also used chicken thighs because that is what I had in the freezer. Everything else I followed the recipe. My husband and 16 year old son who are both not prone to tasting new foods wolfed it down and barely left enough for the girls!!! It was so simple to make! I think it would look great with some steamed asparagus! I look forward to trying it myself after Easter!

Very good!  My family really enjoyed this easy dinner.  I put frozen chicken in the crock pot with the dressing mix and the cream of chicken soup.  I ended up mixing the noodles into the whole thing with some cooked peas.  It turned out easy and delicious.

Followed recipe but had an extra ckn breast so added that also.  I was late getting home so my husband (who really can't cook) followed the directions and finished dish himself.  It was very good and everyone said they wanted it again.

This recipe was pretty tasty.  My boyfriend really liked it, but I wasn't as big of a fan.  I told him I would only make it again upon request because it was definitely not my favorite.  Here are some reasons why:

--  Texture: I'm not a huge fan of slow-cooked chicken.  I was willing to give it a shot for the sake of the recipe, but I was eating it I just kept thinking about how it would be so more delicious if I made this in the oven.  The chicken was dry in chunks.  I recommend shredding it if you use the slow cooker.

-- Description/Ingredients: The word stroganoff seems to be a bit misleading.  I guess I could have decided that based on the ingredients, but this definitely has more of a taste of a chicken casserole than any sort of stroganoff.  Tasty, yes.  Stroganoff? no.  Then again, maybe I just don't know what Stroganoff means (very possible).

--  Flavor: While a tasty meal, yes, it is a lot of the same flavor without adding veggies or other good seasonings/spices.  I added a ton of frozen mixed veggies (peas, carrots, etc.).  This is where I started really liking this meal.  :)

--  Consistency of Sauce:  I had to water it down a lot as many of the reviews mentioned.  It tasted very... umm... cream cheesy in texture and kinda flavor too.

Pretty good meal, but because of all the reasons listed above, I give it 3 stars.  Worth trying, but consider your preferences and trust your recipe-tweaking gut instinct.  :)

This recipe was wonderful!  I made it exactly as written; I love that it's such a simple, 5-ingredient recipe, not much to fuss about for a busy day.  It's not a "pizzazz" recipe, but a great comfort meal.  And 2 of 3 picky-eater kids + hubby all loved it... that's a miracle in itself!

Great quick recipe.   I just put frozen chicken breasts in the bottom the of cooker.  Put butter, dressing mix and the soup on top and cooked on low for 7 hours.    Added 1/2 the cream cheese 45 min. before serving.

This tastes more like tuna helper than the stroganoff I had when I was a kid.  Good over egg noodles or rice.

Had really good flavor but a bit salty for my family.  Next time I will do half the dressing mix and maybe half the soup with milk also to make it not so thick.  Flavor was great and loved how easy it was.

There seems to be lots of mixed reviews on this, but, my husband LOVED it! I enjoyed it, too. It was super easy to make. First, I sprayed my crockpot before adding the breasts. I did, however, start off with frozen breasts and cubed them a couple hours later.  I was afraid to not add any liquid until the end so I poured the soup over the chicken in the beginning and sprinkled the salad dressing mix over that. I also used cream of celery since I'm not a fan of cream of chicken. I, too, served this over egg noodles. Yes, my husband wants this again soon. Thanks for sharing!

Followed the recipe exactly, will not make this again.  Fat content too high, very little flavor in this dish.  Easy to make, but not memorable.

WAY TOO SALTY!  I made this tonight and the only thing I did differently was put a little cooking sherry in with the chicken so it would not burn to the crock pot.  I added less than 1/2 package of dry "Good Season's Mild Italian" salad dressing mix (it was a 1 ounce package and the recipe calls for 0.7 ounce package, so I didn't want to use too much).  I noticed after adding it that the second ingredient is SALT.  This is NOT edible and tastes nothing like stroganoff.

One of the best crock-pot recipes I have ever tried! Chicken was moist..sauce was thick and rich. I did add some frozen peas while cooking noodles, and next time I would definately add a can of mushrooms to pot and use less cream cheese..maybe just a half of brick. I also used light cream cheese. Nice recipe!

So, so good!!  I made it once as is, and it tasted good.  But tonight I had some extra chopped onion & zucchini from another dish I was making (about a 1/2 c each) and threw that in there.  At the end after turning the slow cooker off, I added a 6-oz box of Uncle Ben's quick-cooking long grain & wild rice (w/o seasoning) and let it sit for about 10 minutes (also reduced cream cheese to 3/4)...it made the dish outstanding!  Of course, it turned it into a casserole-like consistency, but I was going to be serving it with rice anyway, so thought I might as well add it in there ahead of time.

Good recipe but needs some adjustments. I put the chicken in my crock put set it for 5 1/2hrs and then it turns to just keep warm. My chicken was very overcooked. I also think think that the sauce is too thick. I served it with whole wheat rotini and used some of my cooking water to thin the sauce. Next time I will cook it when I can be home to keep an eye on the chicken.

Absolutely delicious! I added a bit of mozzarella cheese and spinach when I cooked it and it gave it a nice flavor. This is a great recipe for company. So simple and it goes a long way.

This was so good! Used 98% FF cream of chicken and 98% FF cream of mushroom (1 10.5 oz can of each) and left out the butter. Only used 4 oz Neufchatel cheese and added about 1/4 c. FF sour cream. Served over whole wheat egg noodles, this was so good. My boyfriend even loved it!

this was a very good recipe. I made it a few nights ago for the Mrs. who  at times can be very picky and she loved it. The only thing I could add is to put frozen peas in it about 45min before it is done

I've even made it using a skillet to save time. Great either way!

Awesome!  We lightened this up by using light butter, fat free sour cream and healthy request soup.  (Just realized it was suppose to be cream cheese but it was delicious with sour cream!)

Perfect for crazy days.  I made this to have dinner ready for my family tonight beacause I have a dinner meeting, but I tasted it and it's good.  I used cut-up chicken tenders, 1 lb., and had enough sauce to cover twice that amount of chicken.  Used butter instead of margarine (and only 1 Tbs) , Zesty Italian dressing mix, 1/3 less fat cream cheese and Cream of Mushroom and Roasted Garlic soup.  Added a splash of white wine when adding the soup and cream cheese.  Served over brown rice with steamed broccoli on the side.  This is a great recipe to have in your back pocket for days like today.  Yum!  Wish I were eating at home tonight!

Very Creamy and Tasty!  Added, peas, ground black pepper and used cream of Asparagus. I kept the chicken breasts whole, also!  My two toddlers scarfed it up and a double thumbs up from the hubby!

I tried this last night, and after reading a ton of the reviews, both good and bad, I decided to tweak it just a bit.  I added about 1/2 cup of diced onion to the chicken/butter/seasoning mix.  And after about two hours of cooking, I added 1/2 cup of white wine.  I only cooked the chicken for about four hours on low, and then I added 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup and only 1/2 of the cream cheese (and I used 1/3 fat cream cheese).  The chicken was moist and the sauce wasn't too thick at all.  If I'd added all of the cream cheese, I think it would have been too thick and overpowering.  My family enjoyed it.  I'm not sure how often I'll make it, but it was good and super-easy.

Yum!  One of the quickest, easiest recipes I have made in my slow cooker and one of the best.  The only changes I made were that I used butter instead of margarine and 98% fat free soup.  I cooked as recommended...cooked the chicken, butter and dressing mix together and added soup with the cream cheese at the end and it worked out just fine.  Served over noodles.  I will probably try using lower fat cream cheese next time just to make it a little healthier.

I just prepared this today for dinner. I was short on time so I set my slow cooker on high at 1:00 pm and served dinner at 5:30 pm. I prepared this just as instructed - absolutely no changes and it was awesome! My family all ate seconds, including my picky 15 y.o. son! My 13 y.o. daughter asked if I could pack this for her lunch for school tomorrow. I served this with garlic bread, fresh fruit salad and a nice Chardonnay for my husband and myself. Absolutely the BEST!

This recipe was pretty good! At first I was not sure the chicken would cook correctly with such a little amount of liquid in the crock pot with it, but once it started cooking it made it's own liquid. I put the chicken and sauce on top a bed of bowtie pasta and it was yummie! The chicken did have a bit of a strange texture from being in the crock pot all day I guess, but still delicious. I think if I make this again I may add some peas and mushrooms. Good recipe!

This recipe wasn't one of my favorites. First of all, i am not a huge fan of chicken breasts in the slow cooker. They shred down to a canned chicken quality taste. Dark meat slow cooks much nicer. And I only use the best quality chicken. Gotta sty away from hormones, antibiotics and God knows what else. Definitely use mushrooms. They give it a little kick. And use thighs instead of breasts.

Very good, very easy recipe and went very very well with egg noodles.  I replaced the cream of chicken soup with cream of mushroom and used chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts.  The only thing I would change next time will be to cut back on the cream cheese.  We found that, with an entire block of cream cheese, you could distinctly taste cream cheese.  While it didn't overwhelm the other flavours, it didn't nicely balance with the chicken and mushroom flavours.  Will definitely make again.

This is AMAZING!! I cooked it just as Judy lists it. The only thing I did differently was cut each breast into thirds so the chicken was extremely moist. If you follow the recipe it cannot turn out bad! I have had several requests to make this over and over! Perfect winter dish served over rice with warm biscuits!!!

I had to add and change somethings in this recipe. I skipped the margarine, reduce the cream cheese to 4 ounce and used a cream of mushroom. I added in some red peppers, mushrooms and about a 1/3 cup of sour cream. I served it over some spaghetti noodles for dinner one night. It was really good! This is a easy recipe to start out with and to add to according to your preferences!

This was excellent!  I made it almost exactly as it is written, except I put a few shakes of garlic garlic (Tastefully Simple) in it, some chopped onion and a container of mushrooms.  It was perfect and I will make this over and over.

Very yummy.  BUT, cooking the chicken that way (with only that dry Italian mix and small amount of butter) dried it out TOO MUCH.  We will try more butter, or maybe some chicken broth, next time...and there WILL be a next time...many, in fact.

Not sure what I did differently than most of the folks that gave this recipe great reviews, but I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting butter instead of the margarine.  The chicken wasn't as flavorful as we hoped and even after stirring the cream cheese to break it up after the 30 mins on high at the end, there were still globs of cream cheese that you would hit in some bites.

What a simple and wonderful crockpot meal to keep on hand!  I followed this recipe's ingredients exactly...The only change I made was to increase the sauce amount a bit (as I was serving 6 people) by using 1 1/2 pkg. cream cheese and 1 1/2 cans of cream of chicken soup.  The other amounts I left the same and it turned out wonderfully.  After you cook the chicken in the seasoning and butter, it literally shreds apart in the slow cooker; so moist and tender!  I served over egg noodles.  I made this for my family plus my mother and sister when they came to visit and they had second helpings!  Will definitely be making this simple yet flavorful dish again!  Thanks!

OMG!!!! This was the bomb!  I added frozen peas and chopped canned mushrooms to it!  Yum!  Carrots would have kicked it up another notch. Maybe next time...My husband is in love with it! I made white rice to go along with it!

Okay -- It was a struggle but I followed the directions exactly. By not adding the soup (or any water/wine) at the beginning, the chicken cooked in a way that almost browned or seared. I did however, let the butter melt completely and ensured it completely covered the base before adding the chicken. I also added the entire packet of dry Italian dressing (some suggested only using half).   This was a success for my family - I would make this again. I might consider adding some additional spices or using a more robust mix (I used mild). I considered it slightly bland - although my husband loved it and stroganoff in general is mild.

Oh my gosh this was so yummy!  Not bland at all for us.  I used 1/2 cube of butter and added an 1/8 cup of water at first, and only used half the amount of cream cheese.  It was so delicious over egg noodles.  During the first 5 hours though my small little townhome smelled so strong I had to open windows!  Don't get me wrong, it smelled great, just hurt my nose a bit.  If you have a sensitive nose you might want to make sure you have good ventilation.  I am definitely making this again.

It's a keeper!  Rarely does a recipe get 5 stars from me.  I did the recipe a little different.  I also put the soup in with the chicken, margarine (cut that in half) and dressing mix.  Still put the cream cheese in but like the last 15 minutes.  Every loved it!

I followed the recipe . . . but, could have added a bit more chicken.  In addition, I threw in a splash or two of Chardonnay while the chicken cooked  . . . and then added some canned mushrooms, and frozen peas with the condensed soup and cream cheese.  Served over whole wheat noodles. Yum-Yum!  The wine seemed to be the trick:)

I read a few reviews and added my own touches to this. I followed the chicken part as the recipe says. I was a little worried the chicken would burn but to my surprise, it turned out so good!! I cooked my chicken breast whole , then I shredded them after a few hours.   The sauce, I did change. I added a small amount of milk and sour cream to it to make it thinner and creamier. I also waited till it was almost ready and added about a 1/2 cup of mozzeralla cheese to it. This turned out perfect!!! I served mines over egg noodles and it is a hit in my house!! Thanks for the recipe!!

This is great, very tasty and good enough for company. I did follow the advice of some other reviewers, however, and it really made this a five star dish. First, I put the chicken in the crock pot with about 1/2 cup of white wine, plus the margerine. Instead of Italian dressing mix, I just put in some dry Italian spices. I also used fat free cream cheese, and it was still rich and delicious. I'll definitely be making this again.

This was delicious! I found that having just the chicken and the butter in the crock pot for 5 hours (without adding soup, etc.) worked great! The chicken was very tender and yummy. At the end, I added 3-4 heaping tablespoons of sour cream, about a cup of milk to thin the sauce out a bit, and I sauteed some onions and sliced mushrooms in olive oil and threw them in as well. I will definitely be making this again!

The flavor was there, but it was WICKED salty.  Like really, really salty.  Edible, but too salty.  Next time, I'm definitely going to use low-sodium soup and probably the low-fat cream cheese.  Saltiness aside, the flavor was good and the chicken was really tender and moist.  Will try again.

This was good!  I had to use Kraft Italian dressing, because I can't find the dry mix.   After reading other reviews I added an extra can of soup and even a bit of milk so it wasn't so thick.  The kids loved it.

Added more cream cheese. I added 3 containers of baby bella mushrooms (to stay more true to the Stroganoff and I  added sour cream at the end.  It became a very delicious creamy meal that I served over egg noodles.

My only two cents to add is that next time I may add a little milk or chicken broth or white wine to thin it.  The cream cheese makes it very thick.  I liked the taste a lot, but I served it to a houseful and no one asked for seconds.  Great for a quick preparation meal, but I think a little liquid would help.

I thought this was great and easy. I will try reduced or fat free ingredients next time to reduce fat. *** Also, cooking in butter only will not dry it out, I came home after cooking on low for 4 1/2 hours and it was not dried up or burnt, actually gave it a good "roasted" flavor I don't think would have been accomplished by adding stuff before cooking. ***SUPER DELICIOUS UPDATE 1/7/11: I wanted to jazz this up a bit, so I started my chicken in the crock, then after maybe 2 hours added a can of drained, diced italian tomatoes in olive oil. After another 3 or 4 hours I added cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken, and chive and onion cream cheese instead of plain. Also added just a splash of white wine swirled around in the mushroom soup can. Cooked on high for a good 30 minutes, stirred and ate over egg noodles. Man was this really good! Original recipe is great I just wanted to spice things up a bit and it worked out wonderfully. Hubby even left me a note (works late, eats dinner after I am in bed) on how wonderful dinner was and that he really enjoyed it! He is the (amazing) cook in the family, so leaving a note on how great dinner was really says a lot about how great the meal turned out. If he is impressed it is definately a success!

Good flavor but the chicken was a little dry.  I'll either add the soup earlier or add some chicken broth to keep it moist.

Fabulous! I only made a few small changes, but after making this recipe a few times it is very forgiving. I did not add the butter/margarine and did add a can-ful of water bc otherwise the soup was to thick and browned in the crockpot.  I put the chicken, soup, water and italian mix in the crock pot to start. Then 30-45 before serving I added the cream cheese.   There was no need to cut the chicken as it falls apart after being cooked.

I thought this was ok, but my boyfriend really liked it. I prepared it exactly as written in order to be fair with my review. I think next time, I'll look into cooking the chicken a little differently. I thought it was a little tough. The sauce needs something to suit my taste. I'm not sure what. Maybe a little dry mustard to give it a little more of a zing? I thought it was a little bland. Don't get me wrong, this was good, but not one of my favorites. Everyone's taste is different. You might consider doubling the sauce as well for it didn't make a lot. Thank you for sharing.

Loved this!  I reduced the Italian dressing by about a third to cut down on sodium and will try and find low sodium soup next time.  Replaced part of the mix with garlic powder and pepper and also added mushrooms and served w/ egg noodles.  My one year old twins loved it and so did the rest of the family.

I accidentally threw the chicken soup first with the rest of the initial recipes instead of waiting till the end to do so... But it turned out delicious!! Thanks for a great recipe!

I did not cube the chicken---I just placed frozen chcken breasts into the slow cooker---they stayed together and each person was able to place their chicken breast, with sauce, over the pasta. Added fresh, sliced portabella mushrooms. Used low fat cream cheese. Added low fat sour cream (about 3/4 cup). Kept the temperature at low, but changed to the "keep warm" temperature to avoid the sauce from browning up on the sides of the cooker. Was fantastically delicious and enjoyed by the pickiest of eaters.

Overall this was a good recipe, however I think it would be bland as written.  In addition to the butter/dressing mix I added one diced up onion, a 10 oz. container of fresh sliced mushrooms, and 1/4 cup of white wine.  I added the chicken and cooked on low for about 4 1/2 hours.  Then I added the cream cheese and soup as stated.  After I tasted it, I ended up adding garlic powder and pepper.  Served over wide egg noodles.

Very good!  Like so many others, I used chicken broth instead of water and I also threw in a few sliced carrots and raw potatoes to make it a bit heartier (not a lot, though).  For my dumplings, I used the Jiffy mix recipe on the box (which is Jiffy mix & milk) because we love them & threw them in about an hour before we were ready to eat.  My husband loved it and took it to work the next day, too!  Delicious!  My sons also enjoyed it!  We'll make this again!

Excellent!! The only thing I added that was extra was package of fresh sliced mushrooms about 30 minutes before adding the cream cheese and chicken soup. Even my picky daughter ate this!

You CANNOT leave just chicken, butter and dry dressing mix in the Crock Pot for 6 hours.  Luckily my boyfriend came home early and was able to save it.  The flavor of this is not to our taste.

OH!! MY !!!!!!!!  This was incredible.  Didn't change a thing.  Followed directions. Slow cooked it for 8 hours.  I too was skeptical of chicken, margarine & Italian seasoning.....Was absolutely wonderful, flavorful, and smelled so good while cooking!!!!  Can't wait to make it again.  Perfect to come home to after a long day at work!!!!!  Thanks, Judi for sharing!!!!!

Really good and really easy! I followed the recipe exactly except I put the chicken breasts in frozen.  After 7 1/2 hours I shredded the chicken and added the last two ingredients. Even my husband who doesn't care for cream cheese liked this one. I served over egg noodles but rice would be great too!

I know a lot of people like this.  I'm just not one of them.  Admittedly, I used Fat Free Cream Cheese and low-fat cream of chicken soup, so that might be the problem.

Great slow cooker recipe!  I added a large can of mushroom, drained and only used 1/2 the Italian dressing in the package on 3 lbs of chicken breast because I was concerned about salt.  Next time I'll use low-salt cream of chicken because it was still too salty for me.  I used neufchatel - not sure the difference between that and cream cheese in terms of salt but it turned out creamy and tasty.

Great dish! Like other reviewers, I questioned leaving the chicken and butter in the crockpot for so long with the other ingredients but it turned out to be right on.  The chicken was so tasty and tender.  I did thin out the sauce as others suggested.  I also believe when I make this again, I will try to use the low-fat versions of the various ingredients and add some mushrooms.

This was soo yummy!  I really didn't know if I'd like the flavors but both my picky husband and I loved it!  I used about 8 frozen chicken tenders and no margarine.  I used the Neufchantel cheese and the 98% Fat reduced Cream of Chicken and it was so delicious mixed with No Yolk egg noodles.  Healthy and so tasty.  This is definitely in my new rotation!  Thank you Judi Ann for the easy recipe.

GI had to keep adding water to it and it still wasn't good. The cream cheese over powers everything. Maybe heavy cream or less cream cheese would have worked better.

It may not be fair to rate this recipe since I altered it to my personal taste and based on other reviews. I needed the ingredient amounts and cooking time. I sauteed 3 garlic gloves, 1/2 chopped onion and 8 oz sliced mushrooms. Adding this plus 1/2 cp white wine and 1/2 cup sour cream during the last hour of cooking. Salt and pepper to taste. With this conversion, the recipe is a keeper, IMHO

Easy and very good.  It had alot of flavor.  It was quite rich as some had reviewed.  Maybe next time I will cut the cream chesse in half.  But all in all....very good...lots of sauce and the chicken literally fell apart.  I only had to cook on low 4 hours but it was done before then.

I thought this tasted quite plain but was still tasty for such a simple dish. It would be a 5 star dish if some herbs were added. We had it over rice or mash potatoes. Good stuff.

Excellent easy meal. I put cream of chicken in at beginning and added cream cheese at the end. I also put in chicken breasts and shredded them in the crock before I added the cream cheese. Served over biscuits. Will definitely make again!

Sliced chicken into strips, mixed with butter and dressing mix.  Cooked for less than 4 hours on low before adding soup and cream cheese.  Delicious served over fettucine noodles, or even over rice.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is awesome!  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.  I, like other viewers, did alter it a bit.  I added a chopped onion to the chicken, butter, and Italian seasoning.  Instead of adding the cream of chicken soup at the end, I added 8 oz. of sour cream, 1 1/2 cups of frozen peas, and a small can of drained mushrooms along with the 8 oz. of cream cheese.  I served it over noodeles with a side salad and crusty bread.  This is company worthy!!  It is one of our 'Ten Most Wanted' at my house!

This was the most delicious dinner. I did follow some advice from other reviewers: Skipped the margarine, I did not have italian dressing mix, so I used light zesty italian dressing, 1 can Healthy Request Crm of Chicken soup and 1 can Healthy Request Crm of Mushrom soup thinned with about 3/4 c. milk. I let it cook for about five hours until it was moist and tender, falling apart. Shredded the chicken and then I added 4 oz. 1/3 less-fat cream cheese and about 1/2 c. of sour cream. I let it cook in the crockpot for another 45 minutes to let the flavors blend. Served it over whole wheat egg noodles and it was amazing!.

Somehow I had a different experience than most here.  I found this recipe way too thick and too fatty,greasy,rich.  Yes it was easy, but even after adding a lot of milk to thin it out we didn't like it.  The chicken was also overcooked and the ingredients scorched even on low.  Maybe it needs closer attention than our less attentive slow cooker approach.  Flavor was OK.  Just didn't appeal to us, but obviously does to many others.  Different strokes...

I replaced the margarine with 1/4 cup of water and cooked on low for 4 hours, then added cream cheese and soup and cooked for another hour.  This is a super easy, very tasty meal for a busy family.  My husband and son both really enjoy it.

This recipe was excellent!!! I didn't have the packet of Italian dressing mix, so I just used what I had in the fridge and it still tasted great!! My husband loved it too! And I loved that it was so easy to make! Next time I will serve over mashed potatoes!

This is very easy to make and yields great results. I added red wine to the chicken and italian seasoning. I omitted the margarine and was glad I did. This was extremely rich; next time I will use FF cream cheese. I served it with wholegrain brown rice which was delicious.

This recipe was an enourmous disappointment.  Chicken was tough and burned, sauce was too thick and extremely salty.  Added at least a half cup of milk to thin it out but still salty.

I used zesty Good Seasons italian dry dressing mix, 98% fat free cream of chicken, and reduced fat cream cheese.  It was delicious!  Thanks Judi Ann

Super simple and delicious!  I added fresh mushrooms with the chicken, dry italian, and margarine.  I used fat free cream cheese and reduced fat cream of mushroom soup...you couldn't even tell it was reduced fat!  Served over fettucinne, husband and 3 year old loved it too!

Ok, this definitely gets 5 stars for ease of preparation, but only 4 for texture.  It was a little too thick for us.  I had to keep adding milk to get a "saucier" texture that we liked.  I'm also not sure I like the tang of the cream cheese.  I might cut that in half and substitute sour cream next time.  Certainly worth putting on the regular rotation especially when you have young kids and are busy, busy, busy.

Loved it!  To make it a little more substantial I sauteed a pound of sliced mushrooms and 1/2 chopped onion and added to the last 30 minutes of cooking.  Substituted reduced-fat cream cheese and reduced fat cream of chicken soup and it was still incredibly creamy and filling.  I served it over wheat egg noodles.  AMAZING comfort food for our cold Canadian winters up here!!

This is the first time I have ever made a recipe without making any real alterations.  The only thing I did different was add an additional chicken breast because there were 5 in the package and an additional package of dressing mix.  Because of my schedule today I had to let it cook for about 7 hours before mixing in the cream cheese and soup (couldn't get to it sooner than that) but it was still moist and absolutely delicious.  I will definitely be making this again.  I like easy and yummeh!  Thanks!

I doubled the recipe and used two entire seasoning packets, two cans cream of mushroom soup and one can cream of chicken soup (should have used one less can of soup, though).  Since my last crock pot recipe came out extremely dry, I was afraid to start the chicken off with so little liquid, so I put two cans of the soup and ¾ c. vermouth (no white wine on hand) in at the beginning.  I’ll use less liquid next time since I ended up having to thicken the final product.  30 minutes before this was done, I added some sautéed mushrooms, garlic, and onion, and did some additional seasoning with oregano, basil, garlic powder, rosemary, paprika, and pepper.  Served over egg noodles—yum!

I didn't really love this. Maybe it's because I like vegetables in things like this. I'm not sure. The Italian dressing is DEFINITELY too strong as written. I would put in half the packet, if that. It was ok but I probably wouldn't make it again.

I thought this was just "OK".  I added frozen broccoli and peas just to add some veggies, which I think made it better.  I used the full amount of cream cheese and it was VERY thick, so I would reccomend less CC and add some more liquid. It had a good flavor just a little too thick for me

My husband LOVED this, but I did make some changes to the basic recipe.  Since I worry about sodium for us both, I used only half the Italian dressing mix, adding more oregano, basil, fresh rosemary, and fresh garlic.  I didn't use the whole 8 oz. brick of cream cheese, probably more like 2/3 of it, and I stirred in some sauteed sliced onion and baby portabellos with the cream cheese and soup.  I worried it would be too thick after reading reviews, so I stirred in about 1/4 cup of vermouth; if I had had white wine, I would have used that.  I served it over brown rice, and my husband raved about it.  Actually, I had bought sour cream to add as well, but I forgot it!

This was delicious!  I added the chicken soup in the beginning because I wasn't sure of cooking the chicken that long without it.  It turned out wonderful.  I honestly wasn't sure about this recipe and now I'm adding it to the rotation.  Thank you!

Great easy recipe. I doubled it and added just a bit of water to the sauce at the end...it was pretty thick. Added some pepper and served over wide noodles. I did use 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of chicken (2 cans because I doubled it). I also only used 1-8oz package of cream cheese and about 1 cup of sour cream. I cut the chicken into cubes, after it was cooked, instead of shreading it...just preference. The chicken was very moist and had a great flavor. My whole family really liked it.

So yummy. Only had thighs so I used those. After cooking the chicken I took it out and left only the broth. Then added fresh sliced mushrooms and onions. turn it up to high for 30 mins. (You may need to add some more chicken broth) Then after picking out the bones added the chicken, soup and cheese. Turned the cooker back down to low and cooked as directed. All loved it

I used a package of Hidden Valley Ranch mix instead of the Italian. I also used used a family size can of soup and 8 oz of light sour cream. This turned out soooo good. It was a tad on the salty side which is fine for me because we like our food a little salty...however, I think without the extra soup and sour cream it would have been even a little salty for us. Using the Italian vs the Ranch may make a difference in the salt as well.

I really enjoyed this recipe, and I wasn't expecting to at all, as I am not a fan of recipes that use canned cream soups. I used Smart Balance instead of the margarine. My cubed chicken breasts only took three hours in the crock pot on low. I used only half the package of Italian Dressing to cut back on the sodium content a little.  I used about 2/3rds of the block of cream cheese to cut back on the fat some.  I added in about half a box of cooked bowties to the finished sauce and chicken. I served it topped with shredded parmesan.  It was fantastic!

This dish was incredible. I gave it a 4 star only because it was bland until I tweaked it a bit. I added a package of sliced mushrooms with the chicken. I only added half the package of cream cheese (I took that advice from previous reviewers) and I added about 1/4 cup white wine. This meal smelled so yummy while cooking and it tasted just as yummy. Definately a keeper in my book!

This is the best recipe I've ever gotten from the internet.  I didn't have Italian dressing mix, so I used Lori's suggestion for "Italian Herb Salad Dressing mix Clone" at www.recipezaar.com and used 1 tsp. oregano, basil, paprika and freshly ground black pepper, 1/2 tsp. onion powder, 1 TBS garlic powder, and two tablespoons of granulated sugar.  I also added 2 cups of chicken stock when I added the cream of chicken soup because so many people have said the sauce was too thick.  I also added a little garlic salt to taste at the end.  I have to say, it didn't LOOK real appetizing, but, smelling it all day long sure made everyone eager to taste it.  My WHOLE family LOVED it.  My husband said, "This is definitely a 'do it again' recipe" and he's picky about textures.  My son made a face at the way it looked,but, gobbled it up and asked for seconds and thirds!  I will definitely make this again and again, and share the recipe with my friends!

This was a super easy and pretty good recipe.  I added some wine and onion while cooking the chicken.  I added everything together in the middle of cooking to cook longer together so it would get more flavor.  Topped it over egg noodles and served with some garlic toast.  It was pretty good,  but not spectacular.  I wasnt for sure if it just needed a little more flavor, but after eating a few bites it started to just get boring to my taste buds.  Good recipe, something super fast and easy to make if thats what your looking for.  But Ive just had better.

I made this the other night and it was fabulous!  I used four chicken breasts, cubed.  I cooked them with a whole packet of Good Season's Italian dressing mix in the crockpot on low for about 4 hours.  I then added 4oz of cream cheese, two big scoops of sour cream and a can of cr. of mushroom soup.  I let it cook on high for about 45 min and it was great.  The chicken was super moist and the sauce was thick enough to stick to egg noodles well.  The leftover were even better the next day!  I felt the full packet of seasoning was the right amount and the mixture of cream cheese and sour cream made the sauce just right.

Nom Nom Nom...soooo good and soooo easy! The first time I did it I didn't have the dry Italian dressing mix so I used a bottle of Italian dressing that was pre-made-it came out a bit oily (gee I wonder WHY lol) but otherwise yummy. Making it for the third time today and it's definitely a keeper. Thanks so much!

Followed directions to the letter and it was perfect.  Great meal for a snowy winter day.  Served over bowtie pasta with green beans on the side.

This recipe is fabulous!  I added a 1/4c of red wine and sliced mushrooms at the start of cooking.  Topped a bed of egg noodles with the stroganoff...it was excellent!  My family loved it and I will definitely make this again!

I liked the quick and easy part. The cream cheese makes it pretty creamy...maybe using part sour cream would give it that "sour kick".

I love the way the chicken cooks up in the crock pot! A whole package of seasoning mix is to much. It makes it way to salty and I like salt! Next time, I think I will try half a package.

Loved this decadent meal, and so did the family. Will be a regular now. I made the sauce richer by adding 1.5 bars of cream cheese and doubled the Italian dressing pack as others had mentioned it might be bland. Also used organic fresh chicken breasts that I shredded w/ two forks after two hours. Stood out as great winter warming recipe!

I made this yesterday, and came out with a gloppy, gluey, bland mess. I tried to doctor it by thinning with lots of milk, and seasoning it with paprika and other spices. The flavor was still wonky, though. My kids asked if they could just have the egg noodles plain next time.

I just got done making this for dinner, and had to review it - it is wonderful!  I am not a mushroom fan, and was excited to see a stroganoff recipe without them.  Every last bit was eaten up, even by my picky son. I think I could have doubled the recipe and it still would have all gone! I used the Zesty Good Seasons dressing. I was concerned about the chicken burning, so I did add about 1/3 cup white wine at the beginning, and am glad I did, both to keep the chicken moist, and add more flavor. I also cut back the cream cheese to 4 oz and stirred in about 1/2 cup of sour cream. I served it with wide egg noodles. I am glad I had peas, broccoli and carrots on the side, because the presentation would have been pretty bland without them. I ended up stirring the peas into my own serving, which complemented the taste so well that I may add them to the crock pot with the cream cheese and soup next time.  Thanks for the great recipe; we will be eating this again soon!

This was really quite good. The Italian dressing adds a LOT. I TRIPLED the recipe using the meat from chickens I had cooked (boiled) previously rather than the chicken breasts. Also, I NEVER use condensed soups in recipes so what I did instead was toss 3 celery ribs (chopped) and 3 T. of butter into the crockpot along with 3 chicken bouillon cubes, "some" dried parsley (probably about 3 T.) and 3/4 cup of water at the onset. When I added the cream cheese (2 12 oz "blocks") I also added 1/2 lb. container of (fresh) sliced mushrooms, approx. 2 T. Cornstarch and 1 cup of milk (Half&Half would work well, too). Upon serving (over 2 pkgs. BROAD PD egg noodles, cooked separately), I made salt, black and cayenne pepper, paprika and sour cream available for "takers". We are 6 pretty "averaged size" adults -- but when dinner was over and I set the leftovers down for my dogs, both of them looked up at me with kind of an "is that all that's left?" expression on their faces. [I gave this a 4 on account of the changes I made, but given my changes, I'd rate it a 10+ and a definite keeper.]

This turned out great! I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and added mushrooms and used only 1/2 the dressing mix. I found the sauce to be a little to thick so I added some chicken broth at the end. I served this over egg noodles and we ate it all up. Thanks for sharing!

I rate this recipe 4 stars, but my husband would give it 10. He LOVED it. I added milk until I got a desired consistency (too thick without it) and next time I might add some broccoli florets. I will make this again and recommend it to friends.

This went over very well with my family.  I started it late so I cooked the chicken on high and stirred it from time to time to keep it from drying out.
The sauce didn't have enough "bite" to it for my husband and I so I added white cooking wine and sour cream to taste.  After those were added it was fantastic!

Yum!  Be sure and follow the directions...don't dump everything in at once or the chicken won't be as moist and have that roasted flavor.  I threw in frozen chicken breasts and added 1/2 cup of white wine to the chicken and salad dressing mix.  For the sauce, I used half low-fat sour cream and half 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and couldn't tell it was a lower fat version!  Very good served over rice.

Purely heaven - this was so easy and the taste was so good.  For so few ingredients, the flavor was amazing.  I tend to jazz up new recipes that I try, but I didn't on this one.  The cream cheese adds a totally different stroganoff flavor.  This was a hit with our house and is truly a keeper!

I absolutism LOVE this recipe. I give it 5 stars even though I had to modify it. I took some pointers from other reviewers. I add white wine to the pot to cook w/ the chicken all day. . . and I use real butter instead of margarine. 

The house smells soooooo good all day and I get complements from all my daycare kids parents when they come to pick up their kids. 

Once I know the chicken is cooked through I can't help but sneak bites - I have learned to make more chicken than needed because of this. It's so good just like that.  I've given away this recipe numerous times.

This was the easiest receipe.  My husband has asked for it over and over. I was very skeptical about putting chicken in with no liquid so I added chicken broth with the dressing and the chicken.  I also used frozen boneless chicken breast right out of the freezer and it came out fine.  Love this dish.  Laura H, WI

YUM YUM YUM!!  This recipe is AWESOME!  The chicken is very tender & juicy and the sauce is amazing!  It goes well over rice or pasta.  I made only two changes:  I added about 1/3 - 1/2 cup of red wine and about 1 lb sliced fresh mushrooms to the crockpot in the beginning.
Also - cook times will vary depending on the size and brand of your crockpot . . .mine cooks 4 servings in only 3 hours (on low!).  So just watch out and keep an eye on it so you don't overcook the chicken.  :)

This was "OK". Made this tonight for my bf and I. While I liked it (he, not so much), I didn't care for it enough to add to my regular menu rotation. I guess I just don't care for slow cooked chicken... The texture is kinda wierd. As for preparation, I pretty much followed the recipe to a T except for adding about 1/4 c. of chicken broth in the first step (I had some left-over from another recipe that I wanted to use up). One thing to note, however, is that it took much longer than 30 minutes (on low setting) for my cream cheese to completely melt (even though I softened it in the microwave beforehand). This was not a problem since I needed to boil pasta and warm my veggie side. One suggestion for those who want to make this.... Mix your cream cheese and soup together before adding to the crock pot (it's easier than stirring with the chicken). Served over wide egg noodles with a side of canned peas and dinner rolls. Thanks for sharing!

We enjoyed this very much...I will definately double it next time.  I served it over rice and used reduced fat soup and cream cheese.  I am very glad I read some of the reviews before I made this dish or I probably would have added chicken stock to the first stage of the cooking process.  The chicken was very moist and juicy...I will recommend this recipe to all my friends...Thank you!!!!

Have made this recipe several times and it always turns out so good!  Have made some adjustments to the recipes as previously recommended in other peoples reviews.  Added chopped onions, sliced mushrooms and white cooking wine to the dried italian dressing, butter and chicken breasts.  Used low fat cream of chicken soup and low fat cream cheese.  Served over mini bow tie or penne pasta.  Best slow cooker chicken recipe I have found so far!

So tasty and so easy.  Busy cooks are always looking for hearty, easy meals and this one fits the bill perfectly!  
I prefer boneless chicken thighs over breasts, and I used those.  I also started the recipe late in the day (chalk it up to the "busy cook" day!), so I cooked on high heat for about 3 hours and it came out beautifully.  
You have to try this one....it will go into your recipe rotation for sure!

If I could give more than 5 stars, I would!  I made this exactly as directed and served over egg noodles.  It smelled great and was gone in a minute.  I need to double the recipe though cause my husband and one 12 yr old child ate it all.  I was lucky I got even a taste!!

This was fantastic!! I used 4 frozen chicken breasts instead of diced chicken.  I mxed together 2 Tbsps of melted butter, a tsp of dried minced garlic, 2 Tbsps of dried minced onion and 1/2 pkg of salad dressing mix to 1/2 cup Chardonay and poured that into the crock pot with the chicken breasts. For the sauce, I used a 3 oz pkg of low fat cream cheese, 1/2 cup low fat sour cream and the can of soup.  I also added a cup or so of fresh mushrooms. I served the chicken breasts, topped with the mushrooms and sauce, with potatoes and a vegetable.  Unbelievably easy and so good!!

I am giving this a 5 because my husband said he would pay me to make this recipe again and double it! I personally thought it was too thick next time I will add a little chicken broth, I followed recipe exactly and served over egg noodles.

Great recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except I used frozen chicken breasts that I shredded before serving. I also threw in some peas during the last 1/2 hr. of cooking and served over whole-wheat wide noodles. Will definitely make again. Thank you!

This recipe is very, very rich. I only had five hours so I put the chicken in on high with the butter and Italian seasoning. I think this really dried out the chicken, my mistake. Next time I will start earlier.

I doubled this, as I do with most crockpot recipes.  When doing this, I used 3 packages of salad dressing mix (saltiness was perfect!), added 1 c. white wine & 1 1/2 large pkgs sliced mushrooms as mentioned in other re3views, and used lite sour cream instead of cream of chicken.  Delicious!!!!!  Will make again and looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!!!!

Very nice--I followed others' advice and added about 1/2 cup of white wine and a couple of cloves of crushed garlic at the start.  I also added a couple of dollops of sour cream and a can of mushrooms.  I think it definitely could have used more mushrooms, so I'll add more next time.  The chicken was quite tender, and there was plenty of sauce.  I will make this again.  Thanks

I'm not sure where I went wrong, but this didn't turn out well for us.  It may have been that I used zesty italian and that made it taste "off."  I don't think I'll try this again however, even with the regular dressing.  I didn't like the consistency or flavor.

I changed the recipe like the reviewer from Texas to make it more heart friendly. Used FF cream cheese, RF soup and added mushrooms.  Used about a cup of chicken broth to mix the salad dressing with before pouring it over chicken.  It came out really yummy.  A comfort food for sure.

I rated this a 5 star because of the extreme ease to make in addition to the tasty flavor.  I followed this recipe exactly (with the exception of using Cream of Chicken and Mushrooms, verses Cream of Chicken).  It was the perfect serving portion for just me and my husband, with him having another meal later that night.  My neighbor does not like to cook, but I thought that this is simple enough that I made a copy for her.

one of my favorite and most often used crock pot recipes. i use cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken, and add a half cup of sherry, some chopped onion, and fresh sliced mushrooms. my father in law calls it "super chicken" and wants to know if that's what's for dinner every time they come over!

My boyfirend adores this recipe. I am a vegetarian- so I cannot rate this on personal experience. However, he raves about this meal. it is his favorite slow cooker meal. We use reduce fat cream cheese and reduced fat soup to make it healthier. he also pairs it with Rainbow Rowtini and a little hot sauce.

This the winner of two chicken dinners - glad I went for it.  I added chicken broth, and didn't have cream cheese, so substituted 1/2 sour cream.  And I also added 1/2 cup of chopped bell pepper in the beginning.  Lovely over miniature bow tie pasta. Will definitely make this again. Yum-yum!

Made this last night and the family loved it. I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs instead as I don't like chicken breasts in crockpot and substituted 1/2 of cream cheese for fat free sour cream. I made the italian dressing mix on this site and used two tablespoons of it.  Very good-my husband said this goes in the "keeper" file!

I just tried this recipe today and it is great. The way the flavors blended was great, the only thing I did do was I added some chicken stock to my sauce because it was a little thick for my taste.

So yummy!!!  I did make some changes to reduce the calories- omitted the butter, instead used about 1/3 c. chicken broth, healthy choice cream of chicken soup and 1/2 brick 1/3 less fat cream cheese. Tossed the chicken in only partially thawed and cubed, other than that, followed the recipe exactly, was super good- served over egg noodles. Results were creamy and perfect consistency. Next time I will throw the chicken in whole and frozen as I needed to cook for 9 hrs and the cubed chicken was not as juicy as I was expecting. Over all, great dinner- boyfriend almost licked his plate, will certainly be making again

I tried this recipe (following it exactly as stated) because of all the high reviews but was very disappointed!  The only reason I even give it two stars is because the chicken by itself, with the italian seasoning and margarine, turned out very good and would be great by itself or on buttery noodles.  However once I added the cream of chicken and cream cheese, the smell was horrible!  I had to add some chicken broth to get the sauce to smooth out even after 45 minutes on high.  The taste was like eating condensed soup out of the can. YUCK YUCK!  Thankfully I had some spaghetti sauce in the cupboard to put on our noodles.  My husband did eat one plate of it . . but did not ask me to save the leftovers . . the whole pot ended up in the trash.  ICK!!

I used frozen chicken breasts, sprinkled with 1/2 pkg Tastefully Simple's "Garlic Garlic," covered with 1 can undiluted Golden Mushroom soup and cooked on Low for 4 hours. Added one 8-oz brick of cream cheese cut into 6 cubes for 30 mins to soften, then added 1 can undiluted Cream of Chicken soup, let cook while the noodles boiled, then spooned over. My 7 and 9-yr olds gave this TEN STARS and this recipe feeds our family of 4 twice.   Served over wide egg noodles with petite green peas on the side, and cheesey garlic toast. A little starchy but delicious and easy! Thanks for the post, this one's a keeper.

The smell of the cream of chicken soup with the dry Italian-style dressing made our house smell terrible. As it cooked, it did not get much better. I believe IF I make this again, I will use a can of chicken broth and a can of cream of mushroom. No one in my family liked the flavor of this recipe.

This was sooo good.  I put a frozen slab of four breasts into the crock pot with 1/4 c of butter and sprinkled the dressing mix over all.  Cooked on low 5 hours, added soup and cream cheese, cokked on high 30 minutes.  Cut the chicken with a SPOON and mixed it up with the sauce, served it over rice.  I just loved the flavor.  The flavor reminded me of a recipe my grandma used to make called chicken ala king. Will definitely make again.

I was impressed with this.  I made minimal changes. I would add the complete package of seasoning next time. You do not need to add the whole package of cream cheese.  I would recommend thinning out the soup mixture to get more sauce. I think I will double the sauce next time.

Great recipe! My husband loved it! I made a few changes based upon others reviews. I used 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil instead of margarine, sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder,  substituted Fat Free Cream cheese, used reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup and added half a cup of white wine...delicious!

I rate taste a 5 star but texture a 3 star.  It tasted great but turned out "goopy".  We will try it again but next time we will add a little more liquid when we add the soup and we will cut the cream cheese by half.  My husband was left with the ingredients and the recipe and he put it together following the recipe.  He was nervous about the chicken and seasonsing alone in the crock pot, so he kept an eye on it.  Good thing since it cooked completly in 3 hours.  He turned it off and then warmed it back up to add the soup before I got home.  You should give it a try, the taste was great!!

My husband and I love this recipe!  I added one medium onion sliced and a large can of mushrooms.  I put everything in from the start - including the cream of chicken soup.  We served it over egg noodles.  It's excellent the next day, too!  Easy, cheap and tasty!

I made this again tonight but this time, I didn't add anything but the margarine, Italian mix & the chicken. WOW - the chicken browned up and by the time I added the soup and a block of cream cheese, it turned a golden brown color and smelled incredible! Served over egg noodles, and once again, picky 4 year old gobbled it up!

Everyone at my house loved this!  I added some chopped onion and chopped garlic to the pot before cooking.  We discovered by accident when I served chopped broccoli on the side that this recipe is definitely saucy enough that a 16 oz. package of chopped broccoli can be thawed and added right to the crockpot during the last hour of cooking.

Great recipe.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead (the reduced fat variety) and added frozen peas 20 minutes before serving.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this following the recipe -- it was just a little too salty for me. Next time I will take the advice of other reviewers. Thanks for sharing!

YUMMMMM - SOOOOO GOOD! The most creamy, comforting chicken dish I think I've made to date. I modified the recipe only slightly: Prior to cooking the chicken, I sprinkled dried tarragon & herbs de provence over top the breasts, along with some garlic powder, fresh black pepper & minced onion. Rather than cutting the breasts into cubes, I shredded them prior to adding the cream of chicken soup - and I took the advice of some others & used only a half a block of cream cheese (reduced fat) and 2 heaping big spoonfuls of reduced fat sour cream. It was SO delicious!! I served it over mini penne pasta with a salad. Thanks so much - this will definitely become a fall/winter staple in my house!

WOW!!! I had to beat the guys away while this was cooking. I was super pleased with this recipe...however. I did not have some items so I did some substitutions. I did the chicken with a little butter as it says.. recommend cooking like this, chicken was perfect. I did not have the italian dressing mix, but I used dry onion soup mix and Mrs Dash garlic blend. I also did not have cream cheese, so I used the yummy Allouette garden herb spreadable cheese and a few spoonfuls of sour cream. I added a splash of white wine some worcestershire and a dash of lawry seasoning salt and OH MY WORD!! I tasted the sauce during the last half hour and yuuuuummmmm! I allowed (big mistake) the boys to try it too and I literally had to keep a spoon in my hand to ward them off lol. (by the way my "boys" are 50, 20 and 19). Enjoy!

This dish was awesome! However, I did adjust the recipe in several ways with suggestions from other people. This was my creation: Start with 2-1/2 cups of frozen veggie mix (broccoli, green beans, onions, and mushrooms), 3 breasts of chicken (cubed), 1/2 a packet of Italian seasoning, 1/4 cup of water, and 3 tbsp of margarine all in a crock pot on low for 3-4 hours. Then add 1/2 cup of light sour cream, 4 tbsp of light cream cheese, and 1 can of both low sodium/low fat cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soup. Stir it all up and let cook for another hour. (Add a little bit of water if too thick.) Because I had broccoli in there, it actually came out with a little but of a broccoli cheese flavor, but my boyfriend and I loved it! Much recommended recipe.

Delish!  I would cut back on the cream cheese- maybe I'll use 4oz. next time.  I sauteed fresh mushrooms in some butter and olive oil with thyme and a little port, added them in when I added the cream cheese and soup.  I also added 8oz of tomato sauce.  This was soooo easy and really good, just a little too cheesy for us.  Thanks for the submission!

The whole family loves this recipe, and so do the freinds I have passed it onto. Reader modifications make it even better. I also use the 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and the low sodiumd/low cream of chicken soup. Cream of mushroom soup is also a tasy alternative. SOme leftover broccoli florets, pea, or mushrooms are also options for addition to this tasty meal.  For those who have tried it and thought it too thick,crcokpots are like micrwaves-they are not all the same-you may need to adjust the amount of liquid you add. I very often skip the crockpot all together! Making this in a deep skillet is super quick and just as tasty!

As others suggested, I added 1/2 can chicken broth and a can of cream of mushroom soup with the chunks of chicken breast. Make sure to warm and mix the cream cheese (I used 1/2 box as others also suggested) before adding it the last 30 minutes or it will not mix well. I did add onion and garic with plenty of pepper/salt for a wonderful taste to wheat egg noodles. My husband loved that I allowed the chicken to slightly shred with the mixture (7-8 hours on low) This will become a used recipe in our household--thank you!

This is delicious.  My 7 yr old who never eats anything but cereal went back for seconds.  I picked this recipe on my lunch hour and was worried about leaving it with nothing other than the butter, plus I needed dinner to be ready in 4 hours not 5.  I threw my chicken breast in frozen turned it on high added the butter and seasoning.  When I returned I blended my cream cheese and soup with my hand mixer so it wouldn't be clumpy.  I served over angel hair pasta.  We will be eating this again very soon!

Am I the only one who thinks this recipe is extremely thick?  It does have a really good flavor, hence the five stars, but I added milk and water at the very end (probably about 2 cups).  I doubled the recipe but only used 1 packet of the Italian dressing mix, I'm glad I didn't use two, it would have been WAY too salty.  Chicken turned out very tender.  I served it over egg noodles. This is definitely a keeper.

I made this when I was looking for something new and different. It is excellent. My kids are not crazy about a traditional stroganoff, so I thought this might work better since there is no sour cream and no beef. First, it smells wonderful, I added a second envelope of dressing mix, however, it also made it a little salty. I think this could be fixed by adding the second envelope to the soup instead of the chicken since only the chicken was salty not the sauce. I also added two cans of soup thinned with 1/2 c.milk since we like sauce, and I served it over penne. I'm going to make this again today since it has been a couple of weeks since we tried it the first time. I see this as a regular in our rotation.

Made this without any changes to the recipe. Everyone loved it (this never happens at our house.) I even got a kiss from my 14 year old and she said "Mom you should cook everyday!" High praise!

I made this by adding the cream of chicken soup, some onion, Italian dressing and 3 large frozen chicken breasts to my slow cooker.  I let that cook (about 7 hours) til 1/2 hour before serving when I shredded the chicken in the pot, added the cream cheese and cooked the egg noodles.  It was perfect!  Very yummy!

Very good!  I put whole frozen chicken breasts in the crockpot with the butter and dressing, waited about 15-30 minutes and then cut them up when they had a chance to defrost.  I then added the soup and a little cooking wine and let that cook all day.  When I added the cream cheese, I also added about 1/2 can of chicken broth, since it was pretty thick.  Served over egg noodles.  Husband also enjoyed it.  Will make again!

My family really enjoyed this meal. I did vary the recipe a bit. I took the advise of others and cooked the chicken in the soup. ( I used 2 cans of soup; 1 cream of chicken and 1 cream of mushroom. We like extra sauce) I used only 1/2 a pack of the Italian dressing mix. The last 45 min. I added only 4 oz of soft cream cheese, 4 oz. of fat free sour cream and fresh sliced mushrooms. I smelled wonderful while it was cooking and tasted just as good. Served it with noodles, peas and tossed salad. No leftovers. Thanks Judi, this one is a keeper.

I have tried this recipe and have read some reviews.  The dish was excellent and my family wiped the bowl clean.  The slow cooker really makes the chicken tender.  Also, this recipe is so easy and quick.  A definate 5 star!

Very salty. After reading VVGROVER's comments, I altered the recipe because we don't like the taste of much salt. I used 1/3 of an 8-oz brick of cream cheese (to cut the fat content), and an entire .65 oz. packet of Good Seasons Zesty Italian dressing mix. While this was an easy recipe and made the house smell wonderful, I won't make it again. Way too salty, even after adding soy milk and wide yolkless noodles to the pot at the end. Husband said it's bland, and even if I'd added peas or some other veggies to it (I added just sliced fresh mushrooms toward the end), the sauce would still be too bland. And did I mention salty?!

This recipe was pretty decent. I would personally serve over pasta (I didn't have pasta at the time and used rice in a panic) for a better texture and flavor. The flavor was pretty good, although maybe a bit bland for some. I would recommend cutting chicken chunks a bit small.

The only thing that happened was because I used a smaller crockpot and cubed my chicken too small, it cooked a little fast but the sauce was SO good!

This week will be the third time I have made this recipe in the last several weeks.  This time I am making it for company.  It is wonderful!  The only addition I make is adding a few sprigs of fresh Rosemary in at the beginning.  Fabulous!!

My friend sent me this recipe years ago after having it at her house, and I've been making it ever since!! It's delicious, satisfying, easy, and great for leftovers!  My sisters and mother have also stolen the recipe after having it at my house. I follow the directions to a T, except instead of cubing the chicken beforehand, I just throw the chicken breasts in halved, and they shred very easily once everything is cooked. I find it to be much quicker, and more sanitary, since I prefer to keep my handling of raw meat to a minimum. Sometimes I halve the amount of chicken, if it's just me at home, but I've also doubled the entire recipe when feeding more than 4.

We loved it!
I added frozen peas for color and a ‘green thing.
I only used 2 breasts that I already had thawed, but I used the whole can of soup and added 1/2 can of water. The consistency was perfect.

Cooked the ck, butter and seasonings in my instapot for 12 min and then followed everything else as directed using the instapot crockpot function. I didn’t plan ahead and decided to speed things up with the instapot. This turned out wonderful and will be in my kept recipes.

Followed the recipe exactly. Easy, tasty. Put over jasmine rice. Perfect.  When I heated up the leftovers, I added a lot of fresh spinach. Very good, also.

Delicious!  Not fancy but a tasty filling meal. I used skinless boneless thighs and butter. Otherwise followed exactly. Just enough sauce to serve over rice or egg noodles.

This was amazing, And the whole family loved it. I took the advice of  adding a little bit of white wine and I a little less marg. After one hour I added sliced baby Bella mushrooms since I was using less chicken. Also used the Greek yogurt cream cheese instead of reg cream cheese. Added spinach at the end and stored until the spinach softened. Served it over pasta.

This was a simple and tasty recipe.  I did notice that, after cooking 4 hours on low, there was very little moisture in the crock pot so I added about 1 cup of water to keep the chicken chunks from drying out.  I also added 1 cup of frozen peas about 1/2 hour before adding the cream of chicken soup ad the cream cheese.  My family really liked the end product of this recipe!  I served it over wide noodles.  Thanks!

I used chicken tenderloins and left them whole. Just dumped in crockpot with butter and salad dressing mix. When almost cooked through I added the cream cheese and cream of chicken soup. It was a little salty for my taste, I guess due to the dressing mix. My husband loved it but he loves salt. Next time I will try it with lower salt soup.

Absolutely delicious. Doesn't taste like traditional stroganoff, but in my opinion, much better. Will quickly become a family favorite. Thanks for the great recipe. Super easy, super convenient. I doubled it as well.

The chicken I cooked just as the recipe called for and it tasted fantastic on its own. I did add an additional can of condensed soup (mushroom) and a dollop or two of sour cream to the final product. I served it over egg noodles. The dish was fantastic!

It wasn't terrible, but the cream cheese taste was reeeeeeeeally strong. I wouldn't quite call it stroganoff, more like "chicken in cream cheese sauce." Which is probably fine if you can't get enough of cream cheese. But for me, it was a bit much. Very rich, very heavy. Like I said, it wasn't terrible, but I probably won't make it again.

I have been making this every other week. My family absolutely loves it. I usually add a little chicken stock to the chicken and seasoning, and don't use any butter or margerine. Sometimes I even double the sauce, it is so delicious over rice. We always have leftovers which are quickly devoured the next day.

extremely easy. Used a whole chicken, deboned it after it was cooked. Very good, slightly bland, but could easily be dressed up. could add mushrooms, sprinkle chives on top, add some herbs. But it is good, and everyone will like it as is.

I was skeptical with only 5 ingredients but wow! My family loves this and it was so easy. I melted the butter and put in crockpot first and then added chicken and seasoning and stirred.

My husband loves this. I've gotten to where I triple or quadruple the batch and we have this dish for multiple lunches/dinners through the week! We always have it with brown rice and I make it either exactly as the recipe says or I make some sauteed mushrooms and stir them in at the last minute.

Tasty and very easy. I've made it several times and serve it over egg noodles. 

Cooking for 5 to 6 hours is too long for my cooker for such small piece of chicken (~4 is enough), but I don't fault the recipe for that since slow cookers are inconsistent. Aside from that and adding some salt/pepper to taste toward the end, I follow the recipe as written.

(Incidentally, it's always good to see a slow cooker recipe that understands there's no need to drown things in liquid)

Delicious. I made this and subbed lowfat cream cheese and healthy request soup. I also added pepper, a whole container of sliced mushrooms, and 1/2 an onion. Served over whole grain noodles.

My version turned out awful and inedible.  It doesn't taste at all like real stroganoff.  It is extremely salty and the Italian dressing leaves a weird aftertaste.  In addition, by cubing the chicken before cooking and putting it in with no liquid, after just a few hours (I gave it 3.5 hours) the chicken is tough and unpleasant.  I do take some responsibility for changing the recipe--I like a lot of sauce, so I doubled the sauce ingredients (twice the cream cheese, twice the soup, a packet and a half of the seasoning) and added 3/4 of a cup of chicken broth to thin it a bit.

Loved this.  Added one cartoon of pre-sliced mushrooms at the start and wow did this take it over the yummy edge.  Next time might add more they were so good.  Use the low fat, low sodium of everything you can.  I can see how it can get salty fast if you don't.

What I love is that the chocken will sort of fall apart as you eat it so it mixes into the sauce well.  I'm going to see how it freezes, would be great for Burning Man if I can freeze and reheat.

So delicious! It was a bit too salty though but that probably had to do with the dressing mix that I used. I used pasta salad mix.

I found this to be very bland by following the recipe... To add a kick I seasoned my chicken when putting it in the crockpot and use a can of green chili's for more flavor. Over all it turned out good with a few minor adjustments!

When I was thinking of stroganoff this is not the taste I was thinking. The chicken was very tasty without the cream cheese and soup. I'm going to use this chicken recipe before the soup and cream cheese for something else it was so good

All I have to say is Super Yummy and Super Easy!  Didn't change a thing, but next time I might add some broccoli or mushrooms to get some veggies in there.

Great recipe!  Wanted to make a stroganoff but beef is so expensive and not as good for you as chicken, so I checked this wonderful web site and found this recipe.  I made my own dry Italian dressing (from this site) and cooked as written - not adding the soup until later.  I did add half of a large onion (diced) at the beginning with the chicken and dressing.  After 5 hours I added "roasted garlic cream of mushroom" soup and a package of fresh mushrooms.  Let that cook another 2 hours and added the brick of cream cheese.  Let it sit a bit before stirring it into the sauce, it incorporates much easier.  I boil my egg noodles and add them at the end and let it all marry together for awhile - then eat.  YUM!  I am very sure you can throw everything in at the beginning at let it go all day without any problems.  Thanks for this keeper!

The chicken cooked fine from raw with just margarine & 1pack of seasoning. I didn't peek so maybe that helped. This is a fantastic recipe, I doubled everything except the seasoning & chicken (only had 4breasts on hand) and it probably would have been enough but both the daughters came home along with a boyfriend so our usual 3ppl became 6. After I had half a cup with cut tortillas left over from enchilada casserole, and 2bowls for the oldest & bf (they thought it was "the best soup mum!"),  I stretched the rest with noodles a bit of sour cream (3Tbsp tops) and a splash of milk. The remaining daughter, husband & brother insist it goes on next months menu so they must have liked it.
It's a good thing the family is mostly skinny ppl that must eat minimum of 2500cal/day to maintain weight...
 All except me of course ;)

Always a hit in my family.  I start with frozen skinless breasts, and added a little wine and chicken stock... the last time I made it I was out of Italian dressing mix,  so I used a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch instead,  plus a 1/2 sour cream that last half hour, and that was just as great as this recipe.  the Ranch Chicken was great on top of Orzo Pasta.

My family and I liked it. We all agreed it was very tasty. I try to stick to recipes as posted without making any changes but after this dish was done, it turned out to be very thick so I decided to add a cup of milk and voila....delicious! Will be making it again.

I made this the way the direction stated first and it was okay 3 stars.  The next time I mixed 1/3c red wine with the Italian dressing and poured it over the chicken, added fresh mushrooms and cooked all together.  I also switched from Cream of Chicken soup to Cream of Mushroom soup to make more stroganoff taste (stroganoff for us always has a lot of mushrooms.)

Thank you for the great and easy recipe!  I had a somewhat interesting experience with it...my wife and I both work long hours and so I knew the 5 hour cook time was going to be an issue...so I experimented.  I put the chicken breasts in the slow cooker frozen, added the butter and Italian dressing mix, and put the cooker on low.  I returned home 9 hours later to find my chicken breasts cooked "well done" but not burnt, but they were surrounded by burnt crust.  After sampling a bite to test palatability, I decided to roll with it and transferred them to a saucepan where I shredded them and added the cream cheese and cream of chicken soup.  I ended up with a nice shredded chicken dip :).  Still improvising, I added the juice of a lemon (I prefer a lot of "tang" in this dish), a can of cream of mushroom and 2 soup cans of water.  This gave it the consistency I enjoy...will do it again when I can return in the 5 hour time frame and I think I will add the cream of mushroom, lemon juice and maybe even some sliced mushrooms.  Thanks again!

Great recipe.. I made no adjustments! I thought it was quick and easy and my husband and I really enjoyed this. It doesn't make much of a sauce so I did add a little water mixed with the leftover contents of the cream of chicken soup at the end just to give it a little bit of added moisture. Lastly, I used frozen chicken tenderloins and it
was fine. Thank you!!

Just made it!  Will be a new fav! I did things a bit differently because I did not have all day.  I cooked a LARGE breast and a thigh in my pressure cooker, covered in italian seasoning. I did add a bit of broth and butter to the pan for liquid. Once cooked, I shredded it and put it back into the cooker in the broth, added the CC soup, some sour cream and some cream cheese.  I adjusted the seasonings to taste and let it simmer.  Wonderful!  Thanks for the idea(s) and the recipe

I made this recipe for my mother in law (first time cooking for her) and she absolutely loved this meal!  I didn't follow the recipe exactly and it turned out better than I anticipated.  I used 1 can of low fat cream of chicken soup and 1 can of low fat cream of mushroom soup. Chopped up half of an onion and cooked with the chicken breast in the slow cooker for about 6 hours on low.  I then shredded the chicken and added half a package of low fat cream cheese, 2 spoonful's of sour cream and half the .7 oz bag of dry Italian dressing seasoning. Cooked for another hour or so on low until we were ready to eat!

I tried this today, sticking to the recipe, and although the end result was tasty the chicken was totally over cooked. I would recommend cooking it on low for about 2 hours as the chicken cooks very quickly when cubed like this.

Great recipe. Instead of plain cream cheese I used 4 tbsp of jalapeno cream cheese. Instead of cream of chicken I used cream of chicken with mushrooms.

I found this reciepe to be delicious and my family loved it as well!  However, I did make a few changes because we had a few guests stop by the house (7 people total)so I increased the amount of chicken to 10 chicken breasts cubed,1 stick of butter, 3 packs of the dry Italian seasoning, 1 tbsp of Garlic powder,1 tbsp of onion powder. I tossed the ingredients around in the slower cooker and let it cook on high for 3 hours 15 mins. I then used 1 8oz container of onion and chive cream cheese, and 8 oz of can mushrooms and then mixed into the crockpot and let it cook for an additional 30 mins on high (while it was cooking I did stir the mixture to make sure the cream cheese was throughly incorporated throughout) I boiled 1 bag of large egg noodle which I tossed with 1/4 stick of butter,a pinch of salt and pepper,three cheese parmisian,and dry parsley and placed stroganoff mixture over the top. It was fast, and delicious and I will definitely be cooking it again.

I love this recipe! I've been making this for a while now. I've only make a few changes. I omit the butter and add a diced onion to the first step when cooking the chicken. I also add a bag of frozen peas when adding the cream cheese and cream of chicken soup. Super easy and super tasty!

This recipe was very good, but not great. It doesn't end up tasting like a real strogonoff, more like a storognoff casserole. However my family did enjoy eating it and I'll probably be make it again some time in the future. Changes I made were reduced fat cream cheese and an on top of the cream of chicken, I added another can of cream of mushroom. Don't add salt to it as its fine without added salt, though it did need pepper.

Delicious and very easy, albeit quite salty.  My kids LOVED it served over egg noodles.  Also a fantastic base recipe if you want to make it with leftover cooked chicken for a fast dinner (just heat it up in the oven for 1/2 hour).  I've switched up the soup mix with Ranch, I've used cream of mushroom soup, add veggies - whatever you want - it's really hard to mess it up.

I only used half of the Italian seasoning and added a thing of fresh mushrooms. It was awesome. My husband said twice how creamy it was. Definitely going to be made again!

The flavors were great. However, I should have stuck with my gut thinking this chicken is going to be dry if it's cooked with just butter and seasoning for FIVE to SIX hours!! And it was so dry it was close to jerky..... We ate the noodles :). I used sour cream and cream of mushroom instead because that's what I had on hand. I will probably try this again but add sauce about an hour in so the chicken isn't so dry.

I did appreciate the way the chicken cooked i the crockpot with the butter and dressing packet. The consistency was so thick and bland. As written, it's two star. I'm sure you can make many changes to make it better but this just wasn't for us.

I made this recipe for our office (10 people). Everyone was raving about it all day and asking for a copy of the recipe.  Very creamy and tasty. Can not wait to try this recipe on the family. Definitely worth a try!!!

To be honest, I shouldn't really be reviewing this recipe because I didn't use a slow cooker, and that's a pretty serious deviation from the recipe.  I also used pre-cooked chicken breasts from a whole chicken I made earlier this week.  I'm pretty much reviewing on the flavor profile only, which was absolutely amazing! I melted the butter in a big skillet, added the Italian seasoning mix and cubed, cooked chicken, and stirred constantly for a few minutes.  Then I added the last couple of ingredients and stirred until the cheese melted and incorporated.  My only problem was that, since I didn't use a slow cooker, I didn't have enough liquid (I'm guessing the slow cooker would have rendered some off from the chicken).  So I just thinned it out with some pasta water from the egg noodles I served the sauce over.  Creamy, thick, and deliciously seasoned--awesome!

4 and a 1/2 stars.  Easy and good!  Only used 1/2 the amt of butter called for, used 1/2 package of cr cheese and subd plain yogurt for the rest.  Added button mushrooms at the beginning.  Turned out well- good easy family meal.  Needed salt and pepper.

This recipe has good flavor and easy but to call it stroganoff is a huge stretch. No mushrooms. No sour cream. No paprika. No onions.

Love this!  So deceptively easy, yet incredibly tasty!  I substituted fat free cream of mushroom soup and light cream cheese and added fresh mushrooms to the chicken along with a splash of red wine.  YUM!  This is going to be a regular dish around this household!

When my husband was still alive, he found this recipe online and after making it the first time we had it just about every week.  When we made it for just the two of us we used chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts and just as good.  We did cut down the amount of Italian salad dressing, but really loved it no matter what we did.

This has become a family favorite...However, I don't cube the boneless chicken breasts.  I have learned to combine the cream cheese and soup mixture until smooth first...I also whisk in the juices to this mixture from the already cooked chicken breasts. Pour over the cooked chicken breasts and cook for another hour.  Wonderful served over cooked noodles or rice.

I made this recipe as stated and loved it. I don't eat pasta or rice so I just had it with broccoli. I didn't give it 5 stars because it was a little salty. The next time I will use reduced salt soup and probably reduced fat cream cheese. This is definitely a keeper.

this was a really bad dinner... i will not be making this again. i cooked the chicken whole so the chicken was nice and moist, however, it came out as a sticky, SALTY, mess. maybe if you use sour cream in place of the cream cheese it might not be so sticky but that wont fix the extreme salty taste.

I followed this reciepe exactly as stated and put it over egg noodles. My family and I found it's taste to resemble a tuna casserole rather then a stoganoff. Didn't care for this as all.

It was AMAZING! Don't eat too much, calorie count is crazy. I threw in a bunch of fresh mushrooms to extend it for a family of 6 with 3 very active teenagers whom need a lot of calories.. I don't know how the italian seasoning did it, but the chicken was NOT dry! it was the juiciest chicken ever made in a crock pot. The mushrooms were perfect, half cooked down. Couldn't stop eating them as I waited for everyone. Had to add more.

 You don't have to cook for 7 hours. I cooked for 2.5, stirred the chicken a couple times during cooking. then added the soup and brick, let go about half an hour and added the mushrooms when i saw the portions, another can of soup and half a brick more of cheese. cooked until all melted. It was ready after just 3.5 hours, turned crock put off ( so it wouldn't burn.) until dinnertime, heated through again

We all loved it!! served with crusted bread and green beans.

OMG, I was skeptical of this one but, boy, was I wrong. This was soooo delicious. I was swatting my son's hands away from the slow cooker so that we'd actually have something to put on our plates. I followed the directions exactly but look forward to trying the healthier versions too. I will double the recipe next time for sure and will add an extra can of soup for more sauce. Yum!!

Tasted better than it looked. I used a little less dressing and I can't believe it's not butter. Was easy to make and my picky daughter liked it!

Family loved this. One of our new favourites. I did not have a package of Italian salad dressing so I just used Italian spices. I also added a up of white wine to the slow cooker. Was absolutely delicious.

Loved this recipe. So easy! I followed the recipe as written except I added more chicken (had to use it up) and used butter instead of margarine.  It was delicious! A keeper.

I made this recipe almost as written. I only changed two things: I used butter instead of margarine and I made my own seasoning mix (using an allrecipe recipe actually). This cut down some on the salt and gave it a nice flavor.

My BF made this while I was at work. He didn't cube the chicken, which was okay....the taste came out wonderful! We put it over egg noodles, and the chicken was so tender, that I shredded mine and then mixed it altogether. Awesome recipe! Thanks, this is definitely one we will be making again!

My family enjoyed it. I made the mistake of browning my meat first. Next time I plan on making a lighter version, as well as adding a can of water to the recipe to make sauce thinner.

Add fresh mushrooms and either white wine or sherry.  Add some sour cream for a tangier taste.

Tasty and easy!  Used boneless chicken thighs and followed the directions exactly.  The meat roasted in the crock pot was wonderful.  Only change was that I added halved mushrooms just before adding the cream cheese and soup.  Created great texture and taste.  Served over noodles and it was a HIT!!  A little roasted broccoli with it and the meal was complete.

This was SUPER good! I used low fat Cream of Chicken soup, plunked the chicken breasts in whole, added a bit of milk, and actually cooked it all together minus the cream cheese (didn't add soup later, but at the beginning). I was in a hurry, so I cooked on 3 hours ish on high before adding the low fat cream cheese and then cooking for half hour or so. Very very tasty!!! Served over whole wheat noodles.

I also resisted the urge to add liquid or soup in the beginning,the butter and dressing packet did great for 5 hrs,didnt get dry at all and the chicken was nicely browned...I did add a container of sliced fresh mushrooms with the soup about 30 minutes prior to adding cream cheese. It was amazing!!! So good,put it over rice. I will absolutely make this again,so easy and so delicious.

Great starter recipe with lots of room for alteration. Based on other reviewers' suggestions, I halved the the cream cheese and added about 1/4 cup of white wine. I also put the soup (98% fat free) in at the beginning of the cooking time, and only added the cream cheese at the very end. Lastly, I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breast meat. Very yummy!

I used chicken tenderloins, fresh mushrooms, low fat cream cheese, omitted margarine, and I added the cream of chicken soup in the beginning. The cream cheese flavor was overwhelming to me. I also did not like the way the chicken shredded when I stirred in the cream cheese.

This is delicious!!
I made the recipe exactly how it says and it was so good!
Next time I'm going to use low sodium soup and fat free cream cheese (just cuz it's a little fatty) and add veggies, but the way it is here it comes out very scrumptious!

I think this is one of those times when the whole is not greater than the sum of the parts. Even after following some of the suggestions I found in the comments, this still pretty much tastes exactly like cream of chicken soup with cream cheese in it.

Not a family favorite. I made it exactly as the recipe called for and while the chicken did become very moist and shredded easily I didn't like the smell of the seasoning cooking. Then the chicken shredded into nothing while I was adding the cream cheese and soup. (A lot of the reviews say they added sour cream...that's another recipe.) Six and a half hours on high may be too long for this recipe.

Way too salty, and really didn't look all that appealing.  We actually tasted it and ordered pizza instead. I was bummed it wasn't more of a hit.

Kids (6 and 4) loved it!  Haven't had my daughter eat everything on her plate in ages!  Sauteed some mushrooms for my husband and myself.  We both thought it gave it a little something extra.  Didn't have cream of chkn, so I used cream of mushroom.  Excellent and so easy!

This was really delicious and easy. I tried to lower the huge sodium count (the reason for only 4 stars) by using "Healthy Choice" Cream of Chicken soup, as well as adding the lowest sodium dry salad dressing available. I also used lower fat cream cheese (Neufchatel cheese, which is exactly like cream cheese and is available at any grocery store). Because it's stroganoff, I felt compelled to add about 2/3 cup of sauteed fresh mushrooms. I sauteed the mushrooms for about 7 or 8 minutes in a little butter, then added them at the same time as the soup and cream cheese. I stirred about a tablespoon of the mushroom liquid into the stroganoff. The flavor was surprisingly rich and savory. I served the dish over wide egg noodles with steamed peas on the side; it was a big hit with the family. Will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe. As another reviewer said, no need to turn it on high after adding the cream cheese. Just keep it on low for an hour rather than a half hour. Also, at the same time, to make it a one dish meal (other than the egg noodles), I added frozen vegetables at the same time as the cream cheese.

Oh my, this is delicious! My only regret is not doubling the recipe! (I like to cook enough to last a couple of days, and my husband and I will go through this in just one!) Thanks to the reviewers who offered reassurance that the chicken will be okay with just that tiny amount of butter to keep it moistened; although I did cook it for only 4 hours before adding the wet ingredients, as my crock-pot is pretty big, and stuff seems to cook more quickly in it than most recipes indicate it will. I also added a 4oz can of sliced mushrooms, half an onion, and either a quarter cup or half a cup of milk, I forget which. This will definitely be one of my "go-to" staple recipes in the future!

I was testing these just because I had to work and needed to throw something quick using with what I have.  I've tried many creamy type of sauces and this didnt make it to my keeper folder.  Although, it's a pleaser for kids.

I tried this recipe as written, as I typically do the first time I make a recipe, then I tweak from there.  I was skeptical, but I added the soup/cream cheese later in the cooking time as suggested.  That part was fine - although I'm not really sure what benefit you get from adding it later as the chicken sort of poaches in the butter and doesn't get brown or anything (at least it didn't for me).  The part that made me rate this recipe as "ok" was the Italian dressing mix. The mix packet made the dish just too salty for our tastes.  Like some other reviewers have said, next time I will either add 1/2 a packet, use regular Italian dressing, or just add my own herbs and spices.  I served it over brown rice (totally unseasoned) and with broccoli (also totally unseasoned, on purpose to dilute some of the salty taste when we mixed the chicken with the rice and broccoli) and that seemed to work pretty well.  My family didn't complain of it being salty all mixed together, but after dinner my husband did say "I'm so thirsty!" so even though he didn't equate that with the saltiness of the dish, I did!

This was delicious!  My whole family loved it, and the leftovers are even better.  I actually did not make this in the slow cooker, but used rotisserie chicken and prepared Italian salad dressing.  I sauteed the chicken in the dressing, then added some minced onion and a little Italian seasoning.  I used neufchatel cheese and low fat cream of chicken soup.  I also added steamed broccoli at the end,plus a little milk to thin it out.  I will definitely make this again!

I was unable to find a packet of of Italian salad-dressing mix without MSG, so I improvised with the spices from this recipe: Allrecipes' Italian Dressing Mix. I left out some of the salt because there were a lot of reviews saying how salty this was.

Like many other reviewers, I put in the soup at the beginning, and even that was not sufficient, it was dry when I came home at six hours. However, I put in the cream cheese and some chicken broth and was able to save it. Delicious!

Love this recipe! I've made it twice now, and second time around I loved it with the following changes: add splash of white cooking wine. Make your own Italian dressing mix if you don't have the packaged kind on hand (very easy). Add about 3/4 cup sliced fresh mushrooms and frozen peas to taste. Use cream of mushroom soup and use 4 ounces of cream cheese. Delish, creamy and extremely easy. This will be a regular for me.

This was fine, and it was nice for a change, but we didn't love it.  I prefer my chicken diced, not shredded, and cooking in a slow cooker so long made it all just shred apart when stirring in the cream cheese.  I added mushrooms, which was a nice addition.  I doubt I will make this again.

I FINALLY got to make this.  IT. IS.  WONDERFUL!  Instead of the cream of chicken soup..I found a recipe for home made cream of chicken soup.  I also added a little celery salt in the end. Next time I think I will add my own herbs instead of the Italian salad dressing mix.  And I could see adding chopped artichokes to this.  YUM
Just made this again. This time I used a can of cream of chicken soup but I didn't have the Dry italian dressing mix. So I made my own from a recipe on here called "Italian Dressing Mix" by Debby. I cut up some left over cooked turkey and placed it in a pot with the dressing mix with a cup of low sodium chicken broth. I did not add the salt and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt...did use celery salt tho and it was perfect.  I let that slowly warm and sit for a few hours on the stove so the ingredients would blend together...then I added the soup and cream cheese and it is sitting on warm until the hub gets home. I will serve it over rice.  I've already had several tastes and it's so good. I think I will sub a bit of nutmeg for the sugar in the Italian dressing for this next time. Also think I will add sour cream next time!!  Oh...and I make this on the stove...comes out perfect as well!

If you don't like reviews that change up the recipe, don't read this one! I didn't end up doing slow cooker because of how my day was going, so I cooked the chicken seprately with montreal chicken seasoning and olive oil and I put the sauce ingredients in a big pot and stirred until bubbly. I added 1/2 cup sour cream and a sprinkle of montreal seasoning and a can of green chiles because I just wanted to! I also added two packages of sliced baby bellas that I cooked to soften in olive oil before adding. I served this over jasmine rice or whole wheat egg noodles! yummy! rich and creamy :)

We all loved this.  I put the chicken in the crock pot (I used boneless thighs), tossed it with melted butter & salad dressing mix.  From there I followed the directions exactly.  Served over brown rice.  Yummy!

Very easy and tasty.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs,good seasons Italian dressing mix.  I had no cream of chicken, but used cream of muschroom soup.  It was really very good.  Meat was so tender and shredded with a fork. Will make this again.

Excellent- the whole family loved it.  Added 10 mushrooms, sliced and 1 chopped onion and omitted the butter and it was perfect served over egg noodles. Great weeknight recipe.

My husband loves mushrooms so I add @ 1/2 - 1 pound thick sliced mushrooms on top of whole chicken breasts. I then cover everything with a mixture of 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken soup which I've mixed with the Italian dressing. The breasts shred nicely after cooking for 6 hours on low. I usually use a light sour cream to thicken instead of cream cheese.

This was so delicious and easy! I added a little bit of sour cream for personal preference but this would have been great without it!!! I had never tried chicken stroganoff before and this was a fabulous new recipe that I will use again and again!

Delicious dinner!  This has been in my recipe box for a year and eight months.  Not sure why I waited so long to make this.  I used the ingredients listed; only making 'Italian Dressing Mix' from AR for the dressing listed and a fat-free soup.  Mine cooked for 9 hours on low in my crock-pot, but the chicken still had a nice firm texture to it.  I have an older crock-pot that doesn't heat as hot as the new ones.  The leftovers of this were every bit as good as the first time around.  We had this over egg noodles along with a salad and bread.  I will most definitely be using this recipe again.  Thanks JUDI ANN for sharing.

I've made this recipe twice.  The first time I followed the ingredients exactly and found it too salty for me and the family.  The second time I made it, I cut the Italian-style dressing in half and added about 1/2 cup of white wine when I put the chicken in.  Great "go-to" recipe for busy days.

So easy!  I used a whole bag of boneless chicken tenderloin strips.  I added a can of water and added some additional spices: garlic powder, minced onion, parsley and paprika.  I liked it as it was but the hubby likes it to have more flavor.  This has been added to the favorites and will be made again.  Served over whole wheat egg noodles and sauteed broccoli on the side.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I have a similar recipe that my family loves, but it is much more time consuming. I tried this as a substitute for that, and it worked! I also added a chicken bullion cube and used turkey rather than chicken, and ranch rather than Italian dressing. it was yummy. They loved it...served over rice. :-) Thanks for sharing this!

My family loved it! I was worried that my picky eaters would want something else but they loved this! The only thing I did different, because I didn't have  the  dry Italian dressing mix, was I used Italian salad dressing. I added extra oregano and garlic. Served it over rice and it was a hit!

Tried the recipe mostly as is with one slight modification - added 1/2 cup of water towards the end to thin out the sauce.  It was very tasty. Would like to try the following variations next time (1) low fat &/or non-fat alternatives (2) add chopped broccoli (3) add can of soup.

I made this as written with the exception of adding a little extra chicken broth and about 3/4 of a pkg of cream cheese.  I thought it was a little bland.  Might be because I used the Good Seasons Mild Italian Dressing mix rather than the regular.  I will probably try this again with a full packet of the regular dressing mix and a little white wine.

The only things I did change - I used butter instead of margarine and added some fried mushrooms to the finished product. My slow cooker only has low 8 or 10 hours so it did cook for 8 hours but that didn't ruin the recipe at all.  Very tasty.

Simply Delicious !!  I have made chicken stroganoff in more ways than I can count - but none compare to this !!  Only change I made was to add a bit of milk to reach the consistency I desired and used chicken breast tenders instead of cubing...though I'm sure that did not alter the taste.  This recipe and method is an absolute winner - easy and oh so yummy !!

Super easy, great base recipe.  The second time making it, I added 1/2 diced white onion with the chicken as other reviewers suggested and it was more flavorful.  Great over farfelle (bow-tie) pasta or rice with steamed broccoli or carrots on the side.  Makes great leftover lunches also!

This is really a simple, easy dish, and has great flavor. I use either butter or olive oil rather than margarine, though. I also use home made soup and dressing mixes, both of which recipes for can be found on this site. Not changes the recipe needs, per se, but it's nice to be able to control exactly what goes into the food you're eating.

LOVE this recipe.  It couldn't be easier!  I use butter instead of margarine.   I've made this several times and recently I started adding a can of cream of mushroom soup in addition to the cream of chicken, just to make the sauce go farther.  Amazing!  :)

This dish was absolutely fantastic! The dressing mix gives it such flavor. I don't even like salad dressings but in this recipe, it's a must! 

I changed it a little. I added fresh mushrooms and added a little half n'half to thin it out a little. It was still super creamy and thick but it needed a little help with the half n'half. I also did not use a crock pot but a pan. I put the butter, soup, and cream cheese into a pan to let melt, then added raw chicken and covered for about an hour. I highly recommend this recipe for comfort food lovers.

O M G This was amazing!  No substitutions needed, and this coming from a southern girl who has to tweak almost everything to make it taste "right"!  I did miss the "cubed" part of the recipe and just cooked the chicken breasts whole.. once I added the cream cheese and stirred after it melted, the chicken shredded and it was delicious!  Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe that my teens love!

I loved this recipe! I added about 1/2 cup of white wine at the beginning, and could not find italian dressing mix laying around so I used about 1/4 cup of Italian seasoning spice. Also, it took only 3 hours for it to cook (our crock pot gets VERY hot). I kept sneaking myself "test bites", it was so good! I will definately make this again.

I'm giving this 3 stars just because it was really easy. And it was edible. HOWEVER. I found the taste to be nothing special, and after a couple of bites I was sick of it. Needed a lot more dimension - could maybe be doctored, but as it stands the recipe is only OK in my book.

Great recipe. The only thing I changed was I added a half can of condensed cream of mushroom soup also. I think it gives it more of the "stroganoff" taste. So, so, so good.

I'm not a fan of this recipe.  The taste reminded me of canned tuna casserole but saltier. I did add the canned soup at the beginning because I misread the directions.  Maybe that's why it didn't taste good.........but I'm doubtful the extra cooking time with the soup would make much of a difference.

So easy and a great slow cooker recipe!  Resist the urge to add liquid in the beginning - it really does work as is.  Left this recipe for my husband to do while I was out, but he accidentally added a packet of ranch dressing instead of Italian dressing...whoops!  I added the Italian dressing packet as well when I got home and it turned out great.  I also added a package of frozen peas and some chopped carrots, and served it over egg noodles.  Next time I'll have to try it sans ranch to see the difference.

First, YUM!!!  I just made this (eating it now!) and I had to do my review.  I was tired and didn't feel like fussing over dinner.  Luckily I came across this recipe and had everything on hand.  It was so easy to throw together.  I always read as many reviews as I can before trying, so here's what I got from reading:  I didn't cube the chicken, I just threw 4 frozen chicken breasts in the crock pot.  Then I went ahead and put in the soup.  Then threw in a few heaping spoons of margarine (I hate measuring it so I eyeball it).  Then I sprinkled half the packet of seasoning all over it.  Crockpot on low, stirring only once or twice and 5 hours later, perfect!  I shredded the chicken while egg noodles boiled.  Then I plopped in the cream cheese whole, let it sit a little before stirring and it melted right in.  I will say it is missing *something* small, but it's not the seasoning.  The seasoning is perfect.  I think next time I'd like to add a little sour cream for some of that extra pop of flavor.  But still 5 stars b/c it's perfect as is and everyone loved it!

This was delicious!  My boyfriend, whose cooking experience is limited to hot dogs and frozen chicken patties, cooked this himself!  It was a very simple recipe and tastes so good!  We doubled the recipe (to have leftovers) and served it over egg noodles.

This dish is great, full of flavor, the cream cheese and cream of chicken soup blend together for a wonderful flavor. I served it over rice, but I imagine it would be good over noodles as well. A keeper for sure!

I too was worried that there wasn't enough liquid to go in with the chicken, but it worked out great. I cooked it for a few hours on high instead of on low, and followed everything else perfectly. It was good, a bit salty for my taste, but I would definitely do this recipe again!

Oh my! This is my favorite meal! I made this, but cooked in the slow cooker on high for about 1 to 2 hours, until I saw the chicken was cooked. The butter is totally enough, and I even added some sauteed onion and mushrooms at the end! Oh my! I was licking the spoon after it was done and couldn't put it down!

This is one of my favorite meals to male, and the leftovers are even better! I add a can of mushrooms drained to it. But it's perfect the way it's written!

It was good but not great. I would recommend doing half the italian seasoning in the beginning and the rest after you add the cfream cheese and soup, that might spice it up a bit. I would also add a little milk at the end, as it was very dry.

This was very good.  I did substitute 1/2 C of broth for the butter/margarine and probably had more chicken than the equivelant of 4 chicken breasts.  We ate it without noodles or rice last night and I'm rewarming it up for today.  Dh said it was like his mom's chicken ala king; thinking of serving over biscuits today.  It's a keeper.

Easy & tasty. My favorite combination. Plus it smelled great all day.
Will definitely cut back on the butter next time. Used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chix soup. Served over tri-color past. Added steamed broccoli before serving.

I added some sun dried tomatoes, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.   I thought they complemented the other flavors really well.   This recipe is really easy.   Perfect for a day when you'll be out all afternoon.  Best of all it tasted great.   My husband asked me to put it into our regular rotation.   A huge compliment from him for a new recipe.

I made this over the weekend and it turned out tasty! I did omit the margarine and added 1/2 cup water instead, but otherwise followed recipe. My husband is not a fan of cream cheese in foods, but enjoyed this recipe. Thanks for another great recipe in our rotation!

This is a huge hit in our house.  Everyone keeps saying how nice it is to have a flavorful slow cooker chicken meal.  It really makes a difference to let the chicken cook in the butter and dressing mix for several hours before putting the other ingredients in.  It lets the flavors really soak in and the finished product is so good!

This is ABSOLUTELY by far the most awesome recipe for Chiken Stroganoff. I LOVE cooking it in the crock pot. I have made this SO MANY times for my husband and we both enjoy it immensely! Although this recipe is perfect and needs No Changes, I have even added some things a few times to make it a bit different such as sundried tomatoes just playing around and it turns out PERFECT everytime! Also I can make this meal in less time than the recipe calls for, I just cut my chicken up in smaller peices, cook it on high and viola! supper in a couple of hours, plus it doesn't hurt to have a really good crock pot too!! 5 Stars!! YUM-YUM!!

This was very good in terms of flavor. My chicken was very, very dry though. And when it shredded it made the dryness apparent in almost every bite.

Next time I will try chicken thighs or to do a quick-cook method in a skillet instead. Will also add mushrooms.

I only had a whole chicken on hand. I cut the chicken into piece's, took all the skin off and cut away all the fat.  I added 1 can of healthy request cream of chicken soup at the start, along with 1/2 cup wine (chardonney), 1/2 cup of chicken broth, 1 cup of diced sweet onion, 1 cup of sliced mushrooms, and a package of ranch dressing (all I had on hand.) Started on high for 1 and 1/2 hours, (due to time restriction) then turned to low for 5 hours. (I've seen other cut up whole chicken crock pot recipes that call for 8 to 9 hours on low if you need.) After the first 5 hours of cooking, I took out of the crock, a cup of the hot cooked sauce, and mixed in 4 oz. of cream cheese. I let this cool and added 2 heaping tablespoons of flour to the sauce and cream cheese, then added it back into the crock for another hour and a half. I served it over low carb Dreamfield Penne with a shaving of asiago cheese. Delish!

Turned out yummy!  I only used 2 large chicken breasts and added fresh sliced mushrooms at the end of cooking.  Also, being in south Louisiana we like things a little spicier so I added garlic and red pepper and served it over whole grain linguini - perfect!

This was very good. But way too much cream cheese. This is definitely something I would cook again, but I'd most likely add some celery, a second can of cream of chicken soup and maybe a chicken bullion cube. More chicken pieces, too.

Very rich and creamy, yum! I am a novice when it comes to cooking, so I was very nervous to stray from the recipe. I followed it to a tee and it turned out great. It was so easy! I caught my 5 year old son who protested eating it at first make an yum sound after his first bite.

The whole family loved it! It did not take 5 hours on low at all, more like 3. I would probably only put half of the italian pack next time. I did put chicken broth in with the chicken and butter and 3/4 of the cream cheese. Just per my tastes. My husband's only comment, was I needed to make more. :)

The aroma while cooking was wonderful. The flavor even better.  Served on egg noodles.  Easy and delicious. I did mix the cream cheese and soup together so it was smooth before pouring in the crock pot.  Also took the suggestion from other reviewers to add a cup of chicken broth to thin the sauce.  Turned out perfect!

For those who are complaining of too much salt: make your own italian dressing dry mix by searching for a recipe on this site. Then alter the salt content to your liking. Then use reduced salt cream of chicken soup mix. Most of us have the ingredients for the italian style dressing mix on hand in our seasoning cupboard. Which can help save a little $ as well.

A family favorite - we customized it for more sauce by adding a second can of 98% fat free cream of chicken soup and a splash of red wine at the start.  We also use butter instead of margarine.  I throw the ingredients together the night before, we add to the slow-cooker in the morning, and enjoy a luscious and yummy dinner after a busy week-day.

I love this recipe as does my family! I've made it several times now and just wanted to share my suggestions, I also double this recipe, 4 hungry men!. Using all the ingrediants , I also add, 
tsp. smoked paprika, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. onion powder to the chicken. When adding your soups, I include 1 can cream mushroom soup, a 1/4 cup sherry. Let it simmer, serve over egg noodles, and top it with fresh shaved parmesan cheese.  Enjoy!

This is a keeper.  I did change it a bit. I omitted the margarine, I didn't have Italian style salad dressing mix so I used  1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder
 1 tablespoon onion powder
 2 tablespoons oregano, ground or 2 tablespoons oregano leaves
1 tablespoon dried parsley
 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
 2 tablespoons salt or 2 tablespoons salt substitute
 1 teaspoon black pepper
 1 teaspoon ground basil or 1 teaspoon basil leaves
 1/4 teaspoon ground thyme or 1/4 teaspoon thyme leaves
and a teaspoon of celery salt

and I used creme of mushroom soup instead of crm of chix soup.  I put it over brown rice.  Yummy!!

Very easy and tasty. My husband even liked it. I used 4 frozen boneless tyson chicken breasts. Put these in the slow cooker on low in the morning and they were done by the time I got home from work. I will certainly make this again. My husband was wondering how I could improve on perfection after I made this mea.  LDSH

This was fantastic.  I used less cream cheese (just because I'm not a big fan of cream cheese) but it turned out AMAZING!!!

Delicious as written.  No changes needed.  My whole family loved this, including the picky eater.  Their only complaint was that I didn't make more!

I give this a four since I had to modify recipe (since I couldn't find the dry italian dressing mix at the store). I used oregano and garlic as a substitution. This tasted really really bland. My husband liked it though and thought I should make it again, so go figure.

This is a great and easy recipe!  I followed the directions to a tea and found that the sauce was a bit on the thick side for our tastes.  So, I added a bit of chicken stock to thin it out and let it cook some more and it turned out great!  Will make this many times!!  Thanks for an easy, yummy recipe!  :0)

This was a super easy recipe and the results were good. I served it over rice. My husband took one bite and said "I'm going to want you to make this again". I thought it was a tad bland and added some hot sauce to my portion to spice it up. I actually preferred the leftovers a little more. Will definitely make again - it doesn't get any easier than this recipe, and I always have the ingredients on hand.

This was very easy and pretty yummy over egg noodles, but the sauce was too thick and too pungent for me.  If I make it again I'd try to thin the sauce and/or use less of the italian seasoning.

Very easy.  Used 1/2 block low fat cream cheese.  Threw it all in a Nesco for 30 minutes and added cooked egg noodles for last 5 minutes.  Added 1/4 cup milk right before serving to make creamier.

This is so amazing! It literally just finished cooking and I can't keep my fork out of the pot! I love it and it will be a regular for sure! I would definately double this and serve it to company. I followed the recipe exactly and I might consider adding mushrooms or even some green bell pepper next time. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Tasty enough but I thought it turned out a LOT like tuna noodle casserole as far as the taste goes so I wasn't overly impressed. I followed the recipe and can't figure out why everyone else adds everything to the crock pot so early, the chicken does just fine with just the spices!

This is amazing and so easy to make!! I made a few changes as per the reviews: Added garlic powder, splash of worchestershire sauce, 1/4 cup of merlot and 1 chopped onion and then cooked for around 6hrs.  I omitted the butter and found that you really don't need it. The flavor was fabulous!! This recipe is a keeper!

Not the prettiest to look or most flavorful but not bad and it was simple.  I had to take my plate back to the kitchen and sprinkle with cayenne for a bit more taste and color. Loved it then.

Delicious!!  I used 4 breasts..could have been 5 to stretch and still  have enough sauce.  Also added 8 oz. of sliced mushrooms and then sliced the chicken.  Added about 1/2 cup of milk to thin the sauce a bit.  Was MORE than enough for the 5 of us.  Almost for 2 meals.  Wasn't one of Chloe's favorites, but dad and I loved it.

Sorry, this was not good.  I could not even finish it.  I gave it 2 stars b/c the kids, in their kindness, said it was edible to them and if I tweaked it a bit, it would probably be good.  I was hoping this would be a regular we could add for busy days, unfortunately no such luck.

I'm not quite sold on this. I filled the soup can with water because it looked ridiculously thick, and even after that it still came out VERY heavy, thick and pasty. I think less cream cheese, or perhaps replacing the cream cheese with sour cream. Had I made this recipe as directed (which I did right up the part where you add the soup and cream cheese) I would have given it 1 star. However, with the added water, I would have given it 3 stars. Both kids and my wife loved this and demanded that I put it on the menu again. They all said 5 stars, so I'm giving it four, as a sort of halfway thing. Mushrooms would make it better.

I give this recipe 5 stars without any changes.  I cooked it exactly following the recipe, but I sauteed some mushrooms and red bell peppers which I put over the noodles prior to adding the chicken.  I also sprinkled some chopped green onions on top of each plate.  Definitely a keeper!

Oh-my-word...This tasted fantastic and was incredibly easy to prepare...pretty much fool proof!!  I left the chicken breasts whole and shredded them just before adding the cream cheese and soup.  I also added about 1/2 c white wine at the beginning of cooking.  There weren't many leftovers tonight!...I will DEFINITELY be adding this into my rotation :~)

Delicious!  We loved it.  I followed the recipe to the letter and really liked the way the chicken browned and got really tender.  The sauce seemed a little thick at the end, so I stirred in 1/2 soup can of milk.  Perfect.  I served it over egg noodles with steamed broccoli.  My daughter put her broccoli right on top, so I might just stir it in next time.  Thanks, Judi Ann!

Yeah maybe I messed this up, but I followed the directions as said and it was not good.  If you dont like hot cream cheese in a sauce, I don't recommend this.

this was amazing! Everyone in my family devored it and hubby has even asked for it again!! The only thing I changed was putting the soup in the crockpot at the beginning because I have a habit of burning food in there if there's not enough liquid. Will make it again and again!

We did not care for this.  Chicken was tough, not so much flavor, and I didn't like the consistency of the sauce.  Still searching for a slow cooker chicken recipe I like.

This recipe was very easy to prepare, and much appreciated on a busy weekday night. However, the taste just wasn't there for us. While it was okay, it really seemed bland and I ended up adding more spices in an attempt to make it more flavorful. It worked for the purpose we needed it for (to feed us all with little prep time) but I doubt I will make this one again.

I was a bit skeptical about only puting the chicken in with the butter, but it turned out fantastic!! Both of my children (ages 3 and 5) ate their plates clean and wanted more! We've now made this dish and served over rice and noodles, and added some frozen veggies to it. It's a go to in our house on busy days.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I wasn't quite sure about the Italian dressing. It turned out great. I loved it. My husband just thought it was okay. I followed the recipe except I added about a cup of sour cream.

The chicken lacks flavor and the stroganoff tastes nothing like stroganoff should taste like-creamy and savory. I was very disayppointed that I spent over $20 on a meal that did not satisfy at all.

I made this recipe for my dad & he absolutely loved it!  I thought it was a bit salty, but I figure that's from the can of cream of chicken soup.  I also took another reviewers suggestion & replaced the margarine with mushrooms & 1/2cup of water.  In addition, I used Neufchatel cream cheese & cooked it for an additional hour on low (instead of 30minutes on high).  In the end, I served it over whole wheat egg noodles - it was excellent & made for a wonderful lunch later in the week as well!  :)

I was excited about the recipe from the number of positive reviews and people who had saved the recipe.  Made as directed.  Served with egg noodles.  The taste combination was decent and my two year old ate it, however, the texture was gluey and thick...like a sauce that had Elmer's glue in it.  Removed from My Recipes.  I should have read the other negative reviews, which comment in a similar way in terms of texture.  I won't make it again but it was easy to make and didn't taste terrible.

Creamy, tasty sauce.  Added about a 1/2 to 3/4 cup of sour cream and and extra half pack of the dressing.  The kids loved it too!

I have to say that this was one of the best versions of stroganoff I have tried. Next time I will try the advice of the Weight Watchers version and see, but I followed the reciepe and there was no mistaking that this was an excellent way to make it. Simple and delicious!

Not a bad dish but I expected it to be better based on the overall rating.  Kind of bland for my taste.  I used 4 frozen breasts and let them cook about 6 1/2 hours then shredded them and added the cream of chicken soup and cream cheese.  It was very thick and I ended up adding about a cup of milk to thin it out a little so it would spread over the egg noodles.  I may have used too much chicken, they were large breasts.

I loved this!! So easy and was a favorite with everyone. I did make some modifications based off  the review suggestions: started with 4 frozen chicken breast, 1/3 cup of milk, cream of chicken & cream of mushroom. Cooked that for several hours on high, then chopped chicken, added 1/3 cup of regular cream cheese and 1/3 cup of sour cream. I boiled the noodles and mixed them into the crockpot after the crockpot mix was done! LOVED IT. Mom said this is a keeper!

This was good, but only gave 4 stars because I tweaked it a little based on reviews. I cooked the chicken in butter, a garlic/herb mix (no italian available) and chicken stock for 4 hours. Then added in 4 oz cream cheese and 6 oz sour cream. The result was creamy goodness! served over butter and herb rice a roni. Just felt like it could use some veggies, but that is personal preference. Will add peas next time.

I was impressed with how well the chicken cooked and how good it smelled. The creamy stroganoff sauce was just okay. I didn't love the consistency, but the taste was good.

Very good, I will be making this again.  It's not a "saucy" type of dish...you won't be spreading sauce over noodles, however, it's still great with noodles.

This was ok.  Made it exactly as written except added a generous spoonful of sour cream at the end.  I thought it was extremely bland but husband liked it alot.  Served over brown rice with a side of broccoli.

Frankly, I was not in love with this recipe.  Cooking the chicken for 5-6 hours shredded the chicken, and the sauce was incredibly too creamy.  The flavors were tasty, but it was simply too heavy.

After reading the reviews, I decided to add the cream of chicken soup in the morning (since I wouldn't be home from work for 8 hours).  The chicken fell apart after cooking that long, but that wasn't a turn-off for me since I like shredded chicken.  I added the cream cheese when I got home from work. And I also added mushrooms, a shallot, and 3 cloves of garlic that I sauteed in olive oil and an additional half pack of dry Italian salad dressing.  I thought the dish was still just a bit bland, so I added the rest of that second packet of Italian dressing mix to the crock.  Even as we sat down to eat this, it still tasted bland to me!  Overall this was pretty ok.  Easy, hearty and filling but nothing truly special.

This is a keeper, especially for those of us that work!  I, like others, was worried that the liquid was not enough - but after reading the reviews I followed the recipe as written.  It was great.  I served over buttered noodles and there was none left.  Thank you Judi Ann for such an easy quick delicious recipe!

WOW is all I can say. YUMMY!!! I did make a few changes and found them to be wonderful... I spiced the chicken with minced onion,garlic salt and pepper first.. Then I mixed half the cream cheese,a can of mushroom and a can of chicken and mushroom to butter and soup mix and cream cheese.. Then just poured it all over the chicken and cooked it for 5 hours.. The chicken was moist and falling apart... Served over angel hair.. AWESOME will be a regular... Thank you

Wonderfully easy and delicious. I substituted half of the cream cheese with sour cream because that was what I had on hand. Fed a family of four two entire meals.

Easy to make.  Whole family will like it.  I over cooked it and had to add another can of soup and an entire can of chicken broth to make the consistency right but my family didn't notice.  I shredded the chicken before serving over egg noodles.

This recipe was amazingly easy and tasty.  I didn't like the MSG and wheat flour in the condensed cream of chicken soup, so I used Progresso Broccoli, Potato and Cheese soup which is gluten and MSG free.  I also added a bag of fresh broccoli and a bag of fresh mushrooms and used butter instead of margarine.  Plus, I used twice as much of everything except for the chicken so the dish would be really saucy.  I served it over rice.

I made this putting the cream of chicken soup, half a package of italian dressing mix and a bit of butter in with the frozen chicken breasts to cook 4-5 hours on low. The chicken fell apart and shredded very easily and smelled amazing. I then added the cream cheese and about 1/2 a cup sour cream 30 minutes before serving. Everyone loved it! The food was gone in no time and I've had multiple requests for the recipe. Next time I'm going to use the entire package of Italian dressing mix to kick the flavor up a notch. Great dish!

Didn't love it ... didn't hate it ... was just kinda good. Tasted somewhat "artificial" and didn't have that casserole comfort food taste. Perhaps I should use a different salad dressing mix ... i used Good Seasonings.

Made this for dinner, not quite enough spice for us.  Started with frozen chicken breasts, full packet of italian dressing mix and 1/4 cup white cooking wine.  After 5 hours on low, added 4 oz fat free cream cheese, 4 oz fat free sour cream, 1 can healthy request cream of chicken soup, small jar whole mushrooms and some black pepper.  Served over egg noodles.  Will try some further alterations next time to kick it up!

It wasn't as good and we hoped it would be. I added some extra spice but there just wasn't much taste to it.... very bland. I would stick to the regular beef stroganoff.

I thought this was very good but one word of advice i would not cook this in the slowcooker unattened, such as when at work. I had to add more butter as the day went on since there isnt much liguid in the first 5 to 6 hours, i served it over rice but would use noodles next time

Maybe I toyed with this recipe too much?  Maybe my expectations of stroganoff don't include chicken?  Whatever it is, I just wasn't all crazy about the outcome of this recipe.  I took suggestions/tweaks/tips from many other people's reviews - perhaps I just did too much.  However, it STILL seemed to be lacking SOMETHING.  I don't think I will be making this again.  If I do, I will stick to the original recipe.

this turned out excellent!  My kids loved it and it was so easy to make.  I through in frozen breasts and after 5 hours cut them up into bite sized pieces before I added the soup and cream cheese.

Super easy and good but a little thick. I think I will try this again and add a little chicken broth. I followed the recipe except adding one additional can of soup since I needed it to serve 5.
Made this again and it wasn't too thick. 
I used 4 very large frozen chicken breasts. I put them in frozen, poured melted butter and then sprinkled 2 packets of dressing mix on. After cooking I removed the chicken and cut into squares (I also scooped out the white goo from the chicken cooking) mixed 2 packages cream cheese and 2 cans soup with the mixer, added it to the juices in the crockpot and stirred well and then put the chicken back in and cooked another 30-40 min.

Super Yummy!!  I put the chicken breasts in whole and mixed the italian seasoning with the soup and then poured the mixture over that. Cooked it on low for 8 hours then took out the chicken and cut it up and added the cream cheese and chicken back to pot. I then took the hot cooked egg noodles and tossed everything together and it was delicious!  My whole family loved it!! We will definetly make again! YUM!

Delicious! Added a little chicken broth to the chicken during cooking, as it was done long before suppertime and I didnt want it to dry out. Also used about 3 oz. extra cream cheese and a jar of pimentos. This one's a keeper!!!

I make this almost every week.  My husband is EXTREMELY picky and he loves it!  I only use a sliver of cream cheese as a personal preference so the sauce is not too thick.

Loved how simple this was to make!  Perfect for a mid-week dinner.  I thought it was on the bland side though; next time I'll spice it up a bit with some onion, garlic, and herbs.  But it's definitely going into the regular meal rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

I don't know how this has received such a high rating.  I couldn't eat it.  Maybe I'm just not a "cream of whatever" connoisseur.  Tasted suspiciously like tuna-noodle casserole.

I was super busy and needed to get something going as Tuesday nights we are all in and out of the house at different times.  I put one large turkey breast and two chicken breasts in the crockpot with the Italian dressing mix and two tablespoons of butter.  I let that cook on low for about 2 1/2 hours since the chicken breasts were frozen and I cubed them about 1 1/2 hours into cooking.  At that point I added 1 chopped onion and 1 can of roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup.  A half hour before serving I combined 4 oz. of cream cheese with another can of cream of mushroom soup and about 1/4 cup of milk (that's all I had left!).  I whisked before adding it in along with some peas and let it heat through before serving with mini-farfalle.  It was a huge hit and an unexpected one at that.  This was so easy to make and with the little changes I made, I think it might even work as filling for a pot pie.

Loved it! Would definitely make it again. I did tweak it a bit to my liking by adding onions, mushrooms and tomatoes for added nutrition, as well as cutting the cream cheese in half and adding a can of cream of mushroom soup.

Great recipe I also only used 4 oz. cream cheese and added about a cup of milk.  That is how I can get all my kids and husband to eat it without any complaints- Thanks

Wow! Like others, I was also skeptical of putting chicken with such a small amount of butter, dry seasoning, and nothing else. I did use a little more butter than what is called for. This cooked a lot faster in my crockpot, so I ended up switching to the "warm" setting after it was done to prevent over-cooking. When I finally tasted it, I was really impressed! Absolutely delicious! This has earned a place in my personal collection of favorite recipes.

This is a great recipe!  I will only change a couple of things next time.  I will not put he whole package of salad dressing because I thought it was a little too salty and I will double to cream cheese and condensed soup to have more sauce for noodles.

I should have listened to the other reviewers. I followed the recipe exactly. I got home when the chicken had cooked on low for 4 hours... It was burnt, charred, stuck to the bottom, hard as rock chunks and completely inedible. I still added the soup and cream cheese. The flavor of the sauce was delicious but the chicken you could not eat at all. I will make this again, but on the stove top. There is no reason at all why cubed chicken needs to slow cook for 5-6 hours...and if you do feel like doing so save your meal and add some liquid in the beginning!

I changed it slightly, but not enough to make much of a difference,  I used frozen chicken breasts, right into the crock pot with the butter and Italian dressing mix.  Cooked on high for 2 hours, until chicken shredded.  Added cr of chix soup, 8 oz cr cheese, a few dashes of worstershire, and 2 tablespoons of sour cream.  Turned to low for 1/2 hour.  It was wonderful!  definately will make again!

It's a hit at our house. I used a additional can of soup. The only dressing I could find was Zesty Italian so I cut back a little bit on the amount. Other than those two things I followed the instruction and it turned out great! Thanks Judi.

We make this all the time and it's always great. We use neufchatel cheese in place of the cream cheese add mushrooms and use cream of mushroom soup since that's what we generally have on hand.  We also always use frozen chicken to start and it turns out fine. :)

I had this in my recipe box to try and finally got around to it. What a huge hit with my family. I didn't have chicken breasts on hand but had some legs in the freezer so threw them in the crock with the butter and half a packet of the salad dressing mix and followed directions from there. This was such a huge hit and they all want to know when I'm making it again. Thank you for agreat recipe!

I used "Zesty Italian" dressing mix, and I added the cream of chicken soup along with the chicken, butter, and dressing mix.  I also added a little milk to thin it out.  About an hour before serving, I turned the crock pot up to high, and I added the cream cheese, a couple of generous spoonfuls of sour cream, and one package of sliced fresh Baby Bella mushrooms.  I served over egg noodles.  This was the perfect meal for a cool evening!

this was excellent!  The only change I made in the preparation is that I put the soup in at the beginning.  I waited until the last 30 minutes to put in the cream cheese.  We ate it over mashed potatoes.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe is quite tasty.  I had to substitute the cream of chicken for Cream of Mushroom soup, but it turned out deliciously.  I also added a few shakes of chili powder for kick.

Wow.  This was really good.  Very simple to make. I used the cream of chicken w/herbs soup and added a  can of chicken stock.  I let the chicken cook for about 4 hours on low and it was tender and good and not dry.  I mixed in cooked bow tie pasta when it was finished.   It did not taste too salty to me.  The sauce was a little thick but who cares...this was delicious.

This only slightly resembles regular beef stroganoff, but it is very good, quick, & easy. We just have it w/ a salad. It's part of our regular meal line up.

This called for four servings, so I ended up modifying it for my husband and I. I also took some suggestions from fellow reviewers. I ended up using 1 chicken breast (a large one), 1/2 the dressing packet, 1/2 the cream cheese, 1/2 stick butter, 1/2 c sour cream, and added in some oregano and basil to add some more seasoning. Ended up perfect. Could taste everything fairly equally and the chicken just fell apart. I'll definitely be cooking this again!

Great recipe, thank you for sharing. I do replace the butter and dry mix for a container of italian dressing,  and I also heat up and mix together my cream of chicken soup and cream cheese before adding it to the chicken. (so it doesn't clump up) This is something I have made many many times and its great every time. We love it!

I tried this recipe with whole frozen chicken breasts, lower sodium mushroom soup, butter, creme fraiche, and (accidentally) ranch dressing mix. The ranch led to a different flavor from the traditional stroganoff. It was good but we felt it was a little too salty. If you are looking for a little different spin on  stroganoff, try this recipe with ranch mix, but don't use the whole packet. I will try this again some time with the Italian mix. Also, if you choose to use frozen chicken, make sure to put some of the butter on the top of the chicken to keep it from drying out. Overall, it was a great, easy dinner!

As written, it wasn't my favorite - too greasy.  However, I tried again and made some modifications to create a recipe more to my liking.  I added one clove of chopped garlic, one small choped onion and a TB of butter into the crockpot along with 1 cup of chicken broth and my chicken breasts (1 use around 1 lb and a half).  Then I cook on low in the slow cooker for around 4 hours, shred the chicken, add a can  of cream of chicken and mushroom soup and a block of neufchatel cheese and simmer for a bit longer in the crockpot.  We serve it mixed with egg noodles.  I also would add mushrooms if I could, but my husband and kids don't like them.

Followed the directions as they are with just an addition of a bit of milk at the end.  It was really good.  My husband who's all about chicken enjoyed it and said he'd be happy to have it again.  Think next time I'll add some mushrooms.  Thanks for sharing!

Super easy recipe. However, I gave it a 4 star only because i had to make a few modifications. I used the 1/4 cup white wine in the beginning, which helped with the final sauce. However, in the end it tasted a tad to cream-cheesy, so i would follow the advice of the peope who added sour cream next time. Great and easy recipe though :)_

This recipe was okay.. but the chicken was dry.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and chicken cooked for 5 hours and it was way too dry.. If we make this again, I'll definitely cut the cooking time way down.. see if that helps with the chicken.  On the other hand, the sauce was delicious!

This recipe was good, although the creamy mixture was a too rich for my taste.  When I make this again, I will probably use 1/2 the amount of cream cheese.  There was also something missing, but I can't figure out what.

I raised my eyebrows at the cream cheese, but it was soooooo delicious! I doubled the recipe because as written, it doesn't make very much at all. My boyfriend devoured it. I was surprised because he doesn't like cream cheese. I served it over egg noodles and had asparagus on the side. Next time I will put mushrooms in it. DELICIOUS!

AMAZING!  The only thing that I would change is cutting chicken smaller and adding mushrooms!  Either that or use a cream of mushroom soup!  But still...amazing over rice!

No time for crock-pot...use your dutch oven on the stove. Just add a cup of water and simmer the chicken and Italian dressing mix for 1-2 hours on low, breaking up the chicken as it simmers.  I added another cup of water when I added the cream cheese and cream of chicken soup. My family LOVED it, and are demanding it again. (9yo, 12yo, and 14yo boys!)

This was delicious EXACTLY as written. Many previous reviewers didn't believe that it could be cooked with only butter for hours but it was amazing and the gravy becomes much thicker by only cooking it on high for the last half-hour. Don't change it!  I also tried this on the stove-top as I realized I hadn't prepared enough for the number of people coming over. I did things in the same order (chicken, butter & Ital mix first, then cream cheese/soup mixture) and it also turned out great, though the gravy wasn't quite as thick. I then mixed both batches together. This is a nice alternative if you forget to start it in time and still want to serve this delicious dish!

Very yummy! I made my own Italian dressing seasoning, (I found the recipe on this website). We always like extra sauce so I also added condensed cream of mushroom along with the cream of chicken. I also added milk.  Another thing I added was onions because we love them! Turned out perfect!!

Easy to do and tastes wonderful.   I didn't have dry Italian dressing so I used Herbs de Provence (Italian seasonings) and garlic.    It was perfect.

I thought it was simple and tasted simple. HOWEVER, I think this should be re-named "Man Trapper Chicken Stroganoff" because all men love this dish.

This take a light dish and makes it heavy and packaged tasting.  Real stroganoff uses sour cream and broth, much lighter than this stuff.  Not for us at all.  Beside real stroganoff only takes 1/2 hour to cook so why bother with a slow cooker.

I will say it's easy but that's my only positive. Used healthy low fat low sodium soup & low fat cream cheese and it still tasted rich and way to salty!  Not for those watching their diets.

I had my reservations about this initially, but it was delicious! I made it with cream of mushroom soup and low fat onion and chive cream cheese.  Like other reviewers, I added a few tbsp of white wine while the chicken was cooking.  The chicken came out flavorful and tender.  I served it over No Yolk egg noodles. Fabulous, and maybe even better on day 2!  It's a tad on the salty side, so don't add any salt.  It was also a bit thick for my taste, so I added a splash of milk to make it a little more creamy.

I made this for an easy Sunday dinner. The chicken went straight from the freezer to the slow cooker, and actually the cream cheese was frozen too (I threw everything in at once). Set the crock pot to high for about 4 hours. I added a few twists of fresh ground pepper and about a 1/4 cup of sherry to the pot about 30 minutes before serving. Judging from the faint sucking sounds from my three children and requests for seconds, and then thirds, I would say it was a resounding success. Five stars for easy prep, and yummy results.

Very tasty dish.  We have made it twice and really enjoyed it. Make sure you put it on at lunch time not in the morning.  The first time we started the chicken at breakfast and it was tough by dinner.  The second time we started the chicken at lunch and it was very moist and tender by dinner. Follow the directions and it will be great!

I should have noted how many servings this recipe makes; Next time I'll double the recipe.  My daughter and I loved it, but I agree with other reviewers who noted that it was a little bland.

This was soooo good! I was a little wary of putting the chicken in without liquid but it turned out fabulous! I served it over egg noodles and even my 3 year old son loved it! I wouldn't change anything.

I really wanted to like this because of the simplicity of the recipe...but it really tasted like it came out of a can. On top of that it was extremely salty (and I left out the margarine and used reduced fat cream cheese and soup) it was way too thick, even after I added some milk to thin it. I was very disappointed with this recipe.

Yummy.  Not haute cuisine, not anything that would make your eyes roll back, but tasty, simple food that is a snap to prepare.  Before church on Sunday, I put the chicken in the crock pot ) still semi-frozen, but thawed enough to make cubing easy) and all the other ingredients except the cream cheese and cooked on high.  After church, came home and mixed the cream cheese in and let it melt in and meld while the noodles boiled.  Lunch was ready quickly and was very satisfying!  We'll have this again and again!

I gave this only four stars because it is very heavy and fattening. I used Healthy request soup and lite cream cheese to make it lighter and it was still very good. Kids said it was awesome so it will be a keeper. I also added pepper and garlic powder to the recipe. At the end sprkinkled some parm cheese over top.

I'm rating this recip a 5, because of the simplicity of it.   Made this exactly as the recipe is written and it is very good as is!!  Having said that, I would definitely add to it more garlic and some Parm cheese to make it more alfredo-y next time.  Husband and daughter loved it!

I was worried about the cream cheese in this recipe as my husband has never been fond of it...but I gave the recipe a try nonetheless.  I followed as directed  at first (only adding a little white wine to taste) then discovered half way through that it seemed to be missing something in the flavor department.  I then added some garlic, parsely, and basil to the mix.  This seemed to help out a great deal as far as the favor was concerned.  My husband enjoyed the recipe and stated that it did have a good flavor but it was certiainly not one of his favorites.  The leftovers had a very unattractive chunky look as well...I am not sure if I will try this one again.

Used 1/2 cup of water instead of the butter. Also used FF cream cheese and Reduced Fat soup. Less Calories! We served over brown rice. Yum!

Loved this recipe.  This could be the best slow cooker recipe I ever tried.  I too was sceptical about cooking the chicken with no liuid.  But what happens is that the chicken gets browned on the outside instead of soggy like most slow cooker meats.  It makes all the difference.  I was tempted to try the chicken before I added the cream cheese and soup (I didn't).  I also put the chicken in frozen and it works fine when cooked for 8 hours on low.  It is rich as originally designed.  I might try a lower fat version next time as others have tried.

This recipe is just wonderful. I made it last night and it turned out great. I used chopped up chicken tenders(breasts were too expensive) and it turned out just fine. I was a little worried about the chicken cooking just in an eighth a cup of margerine and the seasoning, but the other reviews said it worked, so I just went with it. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was delicious!  The chicken was so moist and tender.  I used reduced fat cream cheese and low sodium cream of chicken soup.  It still seemed a little too salty...may reduce the dressing mix next time.  Served over whole wheat noodles.  Will definitely make again!

So easy!  So yummy!  This is one my picky eating son's favorites. Since I never have dry dressing mix, I made one modification.  I use Wishbone Italian salad dressing.  I think in the end, the taste is basically the same.   The last time I made this, I only used half the cream cheese and it tasted great.  And I thin the sauce with a bit of milk.  I found the sauce too thick without the milk. I serve over thin spaghetti noodles and with steamed broccoli.

This was a great basic recipe, I added Chardonnay wine, sherry, chicken broth, leek, onion, country dijon mustard, tarragon, extra half a packet of Zesty italian  dressing. I had 3 very large chicken breasts and so needed more moisture and prefer my sauce a bit thinner. I just melted the margarine and added everything right away, turned out wonderful!!

It turned out great tonight. In the Allrecipes tradition, I didn't exactly follow the recipe. As suggested by other reviewers, I used low fat sour cream and added peas. I also threw in some slivered almonds for some texture.

easy comfort food recipe. Serve over egg noodles. I have made this using frozen whole skinless boneless chicken breasts and it comes out just as good. Longer cooking time if the are frozen and the chicken "shreds" then.

Popped this in the slow cooker with no expectations. did note one reviewers tip and added mushrooms. I was so surprised at how well balanced all the flavors were. Not to mention that I used Fat Free soup and cream cheese. Nice addition for me. I served this on toast points. Everyone really liked this recipe! Thanks JUDI this is a hit round here!

This is a quick - comfort food type dish.  I used healthy request cream of chicken and fat free cream cheese and served over brown rice and it turned out great! I did as others suggested and added an extra can of cream soup (healthy req. cr. of mushroom). My fiancee who is a true southerner - fried food, meat and potatoe man really enjoyed it.  This is definitely a dish that can be adjusted to be healthier and still delish! I served the Sweet and Spicy Green Beans with this - nice compliment to the creaminess.  Thanks for this recipe!

This was delicious and very easy.  I ended up adding about 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock after I added the soup and cream cheese because it was just too thick, there wasn't much "sauce" to it.  I added 1 cup of frozen peas during the last 5 minutes of cooking time and served over egg noodle.  My husband and son immediately asked me to make it again next week!  Thanks for sharing!

I put whole chicken breasts in the slow cooker and shredded them before adding the cream cheese.  I used 1/2 neufchatel and 1/2 full fat cream cheese because it's what I had.  It was a little salty, but I didn't salt my egg noodles so it all evened out.  It was a little thick, but not too bad.  Next time, I will thin it with a little noodle liquid or chicken broth.  Easy and tasty.

WOW!! This is VERY good and my husband kept raving about how good it was. I did add the soup at the start because by the time I start up the crockpot and get home from work 10hours have passed, and I knew that the chix wouldn't hold up that long for me. When I added the cream cheese I added a little bit of chix broth to help thin the mixture just a tiny bit. The nice thing about this recipe is I always have the ingredients on hand! Will definately make this again! It made 6 servings for my family.

I couldn't believe how good this was, especially considering how easy it was to prepare.  I cut down the butter by half and cut the cream cheese by about 1/4...it was still amazing and I was able to save some fat and calories.  When I added the soup/cream cheese mixture, I also put in some chopped yellow onion, a couple cloves of rough chopped garlic and some chopped fresh asparagus.  It was wonderful, and I look forward to making it again!  Thanks for sharing such an unblievably easy, yet tasty recipe!  :)

this is SO good! i used the whole packet of dry italian seasoning and condensed cream of mushroom (it's all i had). i love this recipe because i don't have to thaw the chicken - it works just as well on a couple frozen chicken breasts. our budget likes it more saucy, less meaty, and it tastes good anyway. i throw the cream cheese in as i'm cooking the pasta (we prefer it with penne) and sprinkle grated parmesan cheese over each plate. it couldn't be more simple!!

I used lowfat cream cheese and 99% fat free cream of mushroom instead of the cream of chicken. (It was all I had.) It turned out great! The key to this recipe is making sure your chunks of chicken are large. Mine were too small, and by dinner time, a few of the chicken pieces were hard. (but still tasty) My husband ate til there was none left!

This was pretty good!  I prepared it exactly as the recipe called for.  It was a bit too salty, but I put it on egg noodles and it turned out delicious.  I'll probably do something to make it taste less salty next time.

This recipe is very easy to throw together before work -- I truly appreciate that.  Add some warm pasta, a simple steamed veggie, a little green salad, and dinner is served.  This isn't a dish to rave about, but when you need to put dinner on the table night after night, this is a decent meal to have in your arsenal.

Stellar.  I actually used 2-3X the chicken and doubled the sauce stuff.  I worried that there would be too little sauce from what other reviewers said and there was TONS of good sauce so who knows.  I added one chopped white onion, one package of sliced button mushrooms, and about 3/4 cups of dry white wine at the beginning, all of which I would highly recommend.  The mushrooms come out perfectly browned.  I also cooked the chicken for 3-4 hours whole then took it out and shredded it easily with a knife and fork.  It was good to get it wet all so many surfaces for awhile and I like the shredded texture more than cubed before ever cooked.  Easy and delicious and my husband worshiped it.

Good base recipe. I put 4 frozen chicken breasts in the slow cooker with butter and the dressing mix and they shredded easily after 6 hours.  When I mixed in the soup and cream cheese I also added garlic powder and onion powder.  Next time I would add some mushrooms and onions too.

After all the great reviews, I was disappointed.  I made this recipe according to the original directions and this was too rich for my taste.  I felt like it needed more liquids or less cream cheese.

Super easy, super tasty.  The Italian seasoning really makes this different!  Next time I'll probably cook 5 chicken breasts to even out the sauce/chicken ratio.

Excellent!  To make it healthier, I used brown rice.  I have always made stroganoff with sour cream, so I put part fat-free cream cheese, fat-free sour cream, and the healthy version of cream of chicken soup.  Despite all the fat free, it was very, very  rich and  creamy.  My husband loved it!

This is hold-the-phone delicious!  I made it exactly as stated. The chicken browned up nicely and was delicious when cooked alone, no extra liquids needed.  I used Low-fat Cream of Chicken Soup and Neufchatel Cheese and it still had a rich, creamy taste.  This is a dish to make for special occasions or company coming- very easy, but it looks (and tastes) like you spent hours in the kitchen fixing it! Bravo!

I love this recipe!!  Make it the way stated and you won't be dispointed...it has a completely different flavor compared to other chicken slow cooker recipes.  It has a roasted chicken flavor by cooking the chicken in the butter and dressing mix.  Don't stray and put the soup in in the beginning or you'll end up with a standared slow cooker recipe.

Loved this! Followed a couple of other reviews and added white wine and the cream of chicken soup at the beginning. I also had a few mushrooms and chopped onion on hand which I threw in with the cream cheese. Delicious addition ..next time I'll add more.

I have one caveat to this review, and that is that tossing the chicken with the Italian dressing mix is great and works very well.  If you stop there,  this is a great recipe.    I've just started cooking with my crock pot and made this recipe after reading all the positive reviews and was extremely disappointed.  It is quite bland and what flavor is there tastes is just cheap processed yuck.  Also the texture is horrible, very slimy.  I think this is from the condensed chicken soup, which is a disagreeable flavor and texture on it's own.

This was an absolute hit at my house! WE LOVED IT! I put4 frozen breasts in my crockpot along with the dressing mix and half the suggested butter.  I let it cook on low about 5 1/2 hrs and then I put the soup, about half the amount of cream cheese, and I added about a 1/2 -3/4 cup sour cream (I did'nt really measure I just put in what I thought would be about right) I then let that cook for about another 1/2 hour.  I served it over egg noodles with french bread.  AWESOME!!!  Will definately make again. Thanx!

This is delicious!  I'm making it today for the fourth time.  Even my husband loves it and he hates my cooking!  I sub sour cream for cream cheese because I can't stand cream cheese, add diced onion and sliced mushrooms and extra pepper.  You know, today was the first day I actually READ the directions (oops)...I have always put the soup in at the beginning with whole boneless breasts and cooked it on high for  a few hours.  Then you don't have to shred the chicken, it just falls apart.  Yummy on cold nights and reheats great for lunch at work the next day(s)!

This was very good.  I did add some fresh crimimi mushrooms with the soup and cream cheese.  Can't imagine this without them.  Next time I will add some minced garlic and onions.  This was very rich even tho I used low fat products.  I served it over whole wheat noodles.  Will use this recipe again.  Thanks Judi Ann!

This was really easy to throw together. I threw 4 frozen chicken breasts in the crock pot with the Italian seasoning. After 5-6 hours on low, I shred the chicken into chunks and threw in the cream cheese and the soup. I was worried I wouldn't have enough stroganoff so I threw in about 1/2c. sour cream and a can of cream of mushroom soup too. Like I said before, super easy and good, but not great. It tasted like a thicker version of chicken noodle soup, which I'm not a huge fan of. FYI- I would've had plenty with the original recipe. Its heavy and filling! Poured over egg noodles.

OH MY GOSH DOES THIS SMELL GOOD TO COME HOME TO!!!!  I could smell it outside my house.  This is an awesome recipe because you play with it in so many ways.  If you like this with homemade noodles or rice go for it.  I used an onion soup packet instead of the dressing mix.  You can add any veggies you would find ina pot pie like carrots, potatoes, etc than use krusteaz for a crust or pillsbury biscuits on top for chicken and dumplings...  the list goes on and on.  the idea of cooking the chicken alone for a roasted flavor is incredible and I will be doing this a LOT.  THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!!!

Super easy, awesome recipe.  As many others I was leery of putting in the chicken without liquid, so I did put a tiny bit of chicken broth and the chicken pieces were still golden brown.  I didn't have cream of chicken soup, so I used a combo of chicken broth and heavy whipping cream.  I also sauteed onions and mushrooms and mixed them in at the very end.  I will definitely be making this again!!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is fabulous.  Very adaptable to what you have on hand as well.  .... mushrooms, onions, etc.  Resist the urge to add the liquid at thebeginning.  It makes a difference.

This is a really good easy meal that my family loves.  I follow the directions for the most part but use 1 extra chicken breast.  I throw them in whole and shred when it is finished cooking.  We like it served over noodles or mashed potatoes.

This turned out really thick, almost like trying to eat chicken salad on top of noodles. The flavor was not bad and it smelled great, but something about it just wasn't right so I probably won't make this again. I prefer the beef stroganoff  recipe that has cream cheese in it from this site.

I didnt have time to do this in a crockpot so here is what I done.  I baked the chicken in the oven for the required time- i think 30 minutes.  While the chicken was in the oven, I cooked on the stove- cream of mushroom- didnt have chicken; italian seasoning, added white wine- due to other comments; a little water; and the reduced cream cheese.  I added according to my taste so more wine it went.  Something about adding the white wine made this dish a winner.  I cut the chicken in little pieces and added it the sauce.  I simmered it until the sauce was creamy not chunky.  I used the whole wheat noodles and pored on top before I served.  Had broccoli and garlic bread and it was a hit!!!  Can't wait until I get home today for the left overs.  I am sure it will be better the next day.  Thanks for this recipe - this is definitely a WINNER!!!

This was easy and tasty.  I skipped the Italian dressing mix and margarine and just put the cream of chicken soup in with the chicken, along with some chopped-up mushrooms.  Turned out just great and made life rather easier on me!

On a lazy Sunday I wanted to make dinner without having to go to the store and using my crockpot if possible. I happened to have all the ingredients on-hand for this dish so I gave it a try. The only change I made was I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs since that's what I had. Delicious!! My husband couldn't stop raving about it. Leftovers were even better. Will definitely keep the ingredients in the house to make this regularly.

This stuff was awesome and easy to make. I did have to fight the impulse to add it all together in the crock in the morning but controlled it and waited till after work while cooking egg noodles to throw in cream cheese and soup. It was so smooth and creamy. My husband really liked it but both agreed that next time I would add mushrooms. For that matter you could easily add your favorite veggie at the end as well. It was very thick and I did cut that with about a cup of chicken broth stirred in at the end but it did not change the taste and it was still thick and creamy after. The recipe is rich so you tend to eat a little less (not a bad thing) but oh so tasty.

I just made this tonight, and my whole family loved it.  I did alter a little to suit our tastes, I was worried that I wouldn't like too much italian seasoning, so I didn't use it all, but next time I will use the full packet.  I also used only 4 oz cream cheese, but just because my husband isn't a fan of it and I wasn't sure how much of that taste would come thru.  I left the chicken breasts whole, added the soup at the beginning, and shredded the chicken after cooking, then added the cream cheese.  Overall, this was a great, easy meal, and my family will definitely be eating it again.  I may try will the full 8oz cream cheese next time, just to see the difference in flavor.  The kids ate over rice, we ate over mashed potatoes, it was really great with both!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is extremely easy to make.  The breasts I used were frozen so I diced them up about 1/2 way through the cooking time.  I followed the recipe using Healthy Request Cream of Chicken Soup and low-fat cream cheese instead of the full fat stuff.  Hubby said it was good just like it is, I think it needs a little more seasoning.

This was easy to make. I put my frozen chicken breasts into the slow cooker with the margarine and Italian seasoning. I let it cook on medium until the chicken could be shredded. Then added the rest of the ingredients. Our family enjoyed it with rice, although I think noodles would be better.

Everyone had seconds, even my 6 and 7 year old sons!  I used Zesty Italian dressing, healthy request cream of celery (instead of chicken) which I added at the beginning with some leftover chicken broth and only used 1/3 the cream cheese at the end. I did not use butter/margarine but sprayed butter flavored cooking spray in the crockpot before adding anything. I trimmed the chicken breasts but did not cube them -- shredded them with two forks at the end.  Definitely a keeper at our house!

Loved this dish!!! I added mushrooms, and used low fat cream cheese and reduced fat soup, and also just 1/2 of the Italian salad dressing mix. Also 1/2 cup of white wine, as another review mentioned. We will have leftovers tonight- I'm sure it will taste even better!!! Thanks Judi Ann for the recipe!!

This recipe came out great.  The only change I made was adding a 1/2 cup of white wine at the beginning along with the butter and seasonings.  However I didn’t cube the chicken as instructed.  Instead I shredded the chicken like many other people mentioned in their reviews.  But I guess I shredded it too much.  It looked like tuna fish by the time it was done with all the stirring that was necessary to blend the cream cheese and condensed soup.  But even through it didn't look to appealing, It still tasted awesome.  Next time I will cube or not shred at all and just let the chicken fall apart on its own.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

No need to add margarine or butter. This recipe is great without it! My 4 kids almost lick their plates clean when I make this (not an easy accomplishment)! Use the low-fat version of cream cheese, soup, and sour cream (add 1 cup before serving). This freezes easily too. Just place all in a large ziploc without pasta or rice. Easy and delicious!

I was excited to try this after all of the reviews, but we were really not into it.  It was bland, and I even used the whole envelope of Italian seasoning.  It just tasted like Cream cheese.  I ended up throwing a can of Rotel in it, along with some spices.

This was pretty good for an easy weeknight meal.  Certainly not something I would make for company but was pretty good for the amount of effort required.  For some reason the leftovers weren't very good, maybe I was just sick of it.

This was pretty good and very easy. Very thick and rich, good comfort food! I added chunks of potatoes, they were yummy in the sauce. I will add a little more seasoning next time, but overall a good recipe.

This was a good week-night recipe.  It was too salty for my family's taste.  Next time, I'll use either less of the dressing mix or low-sodium chicken stock.

I normally don't care for stroganoff dishes, but this one is DELICIOUS! Not sure if the cream cheese instead of traditional sour cream, but it's very good. Easy, too.

This smelled good and tasted good...but it was the most un-appealing looking meal I have ever made. The chicken was so tender it practically shredded itself in the crockpot which, I think, was the problem. If it were cubed it wouldnt have ended up looking like dog food. Also there wasnt enough liquid for my taste.My hubby liked it but kids ate hardly anything. Next time I will stick with beef stroganoff.

My kids are really picky eaters.  They never seem to like the same things and rarely like what I cook (cause Im not really a good cook).  This dish though may have changed that.  They all ate it.  Each one.  They even asked when we could make it again.

I think I may have over cooked the chicken... it ended up tasting a lot like tuna casserole, so I was disappointed, but it may have just been my crockpot.

I'd give this 5 stars, if I hadn't altered so much.  I started by adding a carton of chopped mushrooms & 1/2 of a chopped onion to the chicken step, altho still included the butter & packet of dressing seasoning, with an extra 2T chopped garlic & 1/2c chicken broth.  since I put the breasts in frozen (forgot to thaw, for cubing first), so I just shredded the meat when it was cooked through.  to the final step, I substituted reduced-fat versions of the cream cheese & cream of mushroom soup, and added about 3/4c fat free sour cream.  we used wheat egg noodles - and enjoyed every bite!  I'll definitely be making this one again, and will not feel guilty about having seconds!  next time, I'm omitting the butter & just adding a little more broth instead tho.

Excellent!  We use low fat cream cheese and low fat soup and it turns out great.  We also use No Yolks noodles to keep the cholesterol down.

So yummy! We all loved this one. I did tweak it some....used 6 chix breasts, added one sliced onion, a whole pk of fresh sliced mushrooms, 1/2 pk. of reduced fat cream cheese. I did mix the dressing mix and the cream soup together first and poured that over the chicken and veggies and let that cook....after 6 hours, I added the cream cheese. I also made some steamed peas and served this over but of course buttered noodles. Really good and easy. My family enjoyed this one. Thanks!

Very good, but too salty.  I second the reviewers that suggest using low sodium cream of chicken soup.  Perhaps adding your own dried spices instead of the package of dry dressing mix would also help.  Next time I would whisk the cream cheese and soup in a saucepan over medium heat to get it creamier....I had chunks of cream cheese which weren't very appetizing.

A definite keeper! Everyone in my family loved it. I used 2 lbs of frozen chicken breast, combined that with 2 cans of Cream of mushroom soup (that's all I had in the pantry), 1/4 C of White cooking wine, 1/4 C of chicken broth, and the packet of italian seasoning. Let it cook in the crockpot for 6hrs and then added the block of cream cheese and 1/3 C of sour cream. Let it cook for another 30 min. The only thing I would change would be to cut back on the italian seasoning, maybe reduce it to 3/4 of the packet. The family still loved it as is, but I would cut back next time. I served this over pasta with homemade biscuits. The sauce is sooo good with biscuits! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was sooooo yummy and super easy. It's just the thing for a busy day when you need to have dinner just about ready when you get home.  Per some other reviews, I used nonfat cream cheese and 98% fat free chicken soup, and this still tasted wonderfully creamy and decadent. I used Zesty Italian salad dressing mix, which gave it some nice flavor.  I'll definitely make this again.

Everyone kept thanking me for the great dinner - even my restaurant mgr. daughter. I melted the butter in microwave, added 1/2 pk. dry mix and coated the chic with the oil/herb. Cooked on high, served over rice with green veggies. I made 6 breasts instead: 8 oz. cream cheese, 1 can cream of mushroom, 1/2 c ff sour cream = loads of sauce, flaky chic enough for leftovers.

This was absolutely delicious for such an easy meal! I get home from work later, so I cooked this on a Sunday, also cooked egg noodles, packed it up in the fridge and my boys reheated it and ate it for dinner during the week. They loved it! Will definately make again!

I tried this recipe and my family loved it. It was so easy and a little something different from our everyday meat and three. I cooked about 6 frozen chicken breast with the margarine, 2 packages of dry dressing, and a can of cream of chicken soup. I let it cook for 7 hours and then cut the chicken up and added a can of cream of mushroon and the cream cheese. I cooked the egg noodles and served it. Everybody really loved it. I will fix this again and again...

This was very Yummy! I made it in a crockpot. I melted the butter in crock added dressing mix, 1/4c. wine, then added frozen chicken, cooked for 3 hours on high. Stir once or twice. Then added the cream cheese, cream of mushroon soup, salt, pepper, garlic powder and dried onions. Cooked it on low for another 1 and 1/2 hours or till the cream cheese melted and mixed up good with the soup. Nice and creamy. Served it over baked potatoe's. Very very yummy! You gotta try this.

This was awesome. My four year old even thought so. I added some sliced mushrooms and a small chopped onion with a 1/2 cup white cooking wine and let that cook with the chicken until I put in the sauce. Definately a keeper!

This was fantastic and super easy.  I added fresh, sliced mushrooms as suggested by others which was a nice addition.  I also added and about 1/4 cup of sherry to thin out the sauce a bit.  Leftovers the next day for lunch were delicious too.  We will be having this again!

Delicious!  You can even cut down on the fat content with the cream cheese and not notice a difference.  I put mine over whole wheat noodles and it's excellent!

I didn't feel like cutting up the breasts (okay okay, they were frozen and I was late for work) so I tossed them in.  It worked just fine (I shredded the chicken when I got home before I added the cream cheese) and found it to be DELICIOUS.  An easy fix if you haven't thawed your chicken.

This was very good, although I may try just using half the amount of cream cheese next time, for the calories..

This is a good basic recipe. I made quite a few changes to make it lower in calories and more heart-healthy, it wouldn't be fair to change the recipe. I will post my own changes in a new submitted recipe. Thank you for the inspiration.

I made this numerous times. We like alot of sauce for dunking bread so I added a can of cream of mushroom and a can of chicken broth. I also added fresh mushrooms. I always have made beef stroganoff from scratch and wanted to find a good recipe for the crock pot. This is one of my childrens favorite dishes. 10+ Recipe

I used butter instead of margarine and home made italian dressing mix. Also I added rice the last half hour.  I took it to work and it was a huge hit.  I served it in soft buns for easy eating.  Will make again.

OK...I did this recipe based on the ratings and the number of reviews.  As busy as I was, I, who normally read all reviews and change the recipe accordingly, did not make any changes really.  I have an awesome recipe for stroganoff that calls for wine...SO...at the beginning added some white wine with the chicken and italian seasonings.  I also just threw in whole boneless chicken breasts that were frozen.  My husband came home before I did...and called with great reviews before I even finished the recipe!  My biggest critics..and complainers of my cooking...really liked it!  However, the 6 year old would not touch it!!!  8 year old liked it...18 year old and hubby loved it!  Those were my only changes and it was not bad at all!!!!

This was a great recipe, but I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand so I had to make a couple of substitions.  I cubed the chicken breast and put it in a ziploc bag with the italian dressing mix and some extra dried basil and oregano and put it in the fridge overnight.  The next day, I added the chicken, margarine and 1/4 cup of white wine to the crockpot and set it to low for 5 hours.  After 4.5 hours I sauteeed a package of sliced mushrooms and added it to the crockpot along with a container of chive cream cheese and 1/2 cup of pre-made onion dip. (I didn't have any creamed soup on hand).  I also added approx 1.5 cups of fresh broccoli and 1/4 cup of chopped sundried tomatoes and let it cook another 30 minutes.  Served it with angel hair pasta topped with fresh grated parmesan cheese. My family loved it.  I will make it again, likely as I did this time, but I will shorten the cooking time to 4 or 4.5 hours.

I owuld have given this a five but I changed the original recipe a little bit.  I followed another reviewers advice and added a 1/4 cup of white wine.  I served this with whole wheat noodles. A friend said he would have rated it 4.5 stars and long-time boyfriend said he would like this again for dinner.

This recipes was good, and I do like my food well seasoned, but I think the chicken was a bit salty.   My husband thought it was pretty good.  The next time I make it, I will use 5 oz of the Italian season.  I also cook the chicken on hi in the crockpot for 2 hours, then on low for 1 hour.  Towards the end I added 1 cup Italian cheese blend. Over all the recipe was good.

I added about 1T. of dried chives and some garlic powder and it was absolutely awesome! It was a little too thick for our tastes so I just added about 1/2 cup of milk to thin it just a bit.

This made a very nice entree!  Delicious over rice or noodles.  I like a "saucy" dish, so I used only 3 (large) chicken breasts. Does not have much color, so a dusting of paprika looks nice on each serving.  Only other thing I would change is maybe adding some sliced mushrooms, as suggested below.

OMG! This is the BEST recipe!  I would give it 10stars if I could!  My boyfriend loves this!  I also sent to a few friends and they rate it 5stars as well.  It is so convenient to put the chicken in frozen.  My only addition is that when you put in the cream cheese, I also add a package of fresh baby portabella mushrooms, then cook for the recommended 1/2 hour more.  It is delicious!  *UPDATE* I've made this 6 or 7 more times now!  So convenient for a weekday meal.  I've also 'lightened' it up a bit, omitting the butter, using reduced fat Cream of Mushroom soup, and using 1/2 block Fat Free Cream Cheese and 1/2 block of a third less fat Cream Cheese, served with whole wheat noodles.  Amazing!!!

My family loved this!  My 13 year old son went back for seconds.  The only thing I did was add a little milk and I wished I had added a little more, because the sauce was a little thick.  I think if I had not drained the egg noodles before I served it up, the noodles would have been a little bit more able to make the sauce thinner.  Other than that it was great!  Definitely will make again.

Very delicious. I am not a fan of condensed soup and have only used them twice in the last 10 years.  Yet, all of the reviews made me very intrigued and the recipe was so simple.  I made some small changes and it turned out pretty yummy.  I substituted Bittersweet Farms for the salad seasoning mix.  Bittersweet Farms does no sugar, no salt, no preservatives seasoning mixes that are delicious. I used their savory herbs mixed with their golden onion mix, tblp of each. I didn't want to open a bottle of wine, so added 1/4 cup of vermouth to the chicken at the beginnning.  Next time, I might add less, as the chicken did not brown like it was supposed to. I also did not use any margarine or butter (trying to control cholesteral and fat).  I sauteed (using spray oil in nonstick pan to cut down on fat) one chopped yellow onion, add to slow cooker. Then I sauteed one pound baby bella (or cremini or button) mushrooms) sliced thickly.  When finished at about 4.5 hours, I added the red fat cream cheese, red fat cream of chicken soup for the half hour on high as suggested.  At the end I added 1/2 cup of low fat sour cream to add tang for the Stroganoff as suggested by readers.  Perfect! When I said to my husband, do you want leftovers or turkey meatloaf tomorrow night....he said leftovers :)  YUM!

I make this at least once a month! It's super simple and very tasty. No changes need to be made to the posted recipe - it's really great just as it is! I've used chicken thighs, boneless breasts and skinless tenders, all of which turned out moist and perfect!! Thanks so much for posting this recipe! It's now a family favorite!!

Thanks for this terrific (and easy) recipe!  I only deviated from the recipe at the end by mixing half a can of cream of mushroom and half a can of cream chicken together, but that's just a personal preference on my part.  I used reduced fat soups and cream cheese, but it made no difference to taste ~ absolutely delicious over noodles or over rice!!!

Yummy!  and very simple! I used cream of mushroom soup and added sliced mushrooms (sliced water chestnuts might be a good addition, too - crunchy!)  Served over wide, wheat noodles and a side of fresh green beans.

I love Stroganoff and I was excited to see one that didn't include cream of mushroom soup(I'm not a big fan of mushrooms)and that looked pretty easy. It smelled delicious when it was cooking, but I wasn't impressed with this meal. I thought the dressing would give it some zing but to me it was bland, my husband thought it was saltly. I'm sadden that this wasn't the recipe I was looking for, and I won't be making this again.

I morphed the leftovers of this into another meal by adding a can of diced green chiles and making enchiladas suiza.  To make the stroganoff, I used frozen chicken breasts and instead of italian packet, I sprinkled (eyeballed) garlic powder, onion powder, lemon pepper and basil over the chicken, added 2 T butter and I couldn't resist adding a little liquid, so I also added about 1/3 c white wine.  After cooking for several hours, I added the cream cheese and healthy request cream of chicken soup but it needed something so I added about 1 tsp lemon pepper and 2 T lemon juice along with 1/2 c sour cream.  It wasn't bad...we had it over rice.

eh.....i love stroganoff and this tastes NOTHING like it. don't get me wrong, but it was not what i expected at all. i even followed the recipe to the T. the ONLY thing I did different was shred the chicken instead of cube it. may i suggest that IF you do shred it, only use half the recommended portion of chicken. otherwise there is soooo much and not enough sauce. this recipe tastes like a tuna helper box dinner. i for sure wont make it again. not because it was bad but because it tastes NOTHING like stroganoff.

I followed the recipe as is and it turned out great!  Delicious.  This meal makes a regular appearance at the dinner table.  I especially like how it doesn't take a really long time in the slow cooker--I don't have to plan ahead that much!

This was super easy & absolutely delicious.  My entire family -- husband and all 5 kids-- ate it up and asked for more.  The only comment that my husband made was that it was kind of salty for his taste.  I'll definitely add this into our regular rotation of recipes.  It reminded us all a lot of the chicken alfredo from Pizza Hut (but for much less money).    Thanks for submitting it!

I so looked forward to making this after reading the reviews and it looked so easy!  Unfortunately no one in my family liked it.  We thought it was bland and needed something.  The chicken was very tender though and we did enjoy that but I won't be making this again.

I tried this one when I was looking for a new way to do chicken in the crockpot. I did add some onion and a small splash of chicken broth to the crockpot before I left, since I was going to be gone longer than the six hours. Served it over elbow macaroni and broccoli; my husband said he'd give it "a six out of five!"

I, too, was skeptical of cooking little pieces of chicken for so long in the crock pot with just a little bit of butter and seasoning, but it was GREAT.  I also dumped the cream cheese in, let it soften, then stirred to mix it all up.  We had it over rice, but would also be great over noodles.  I LOVED how simple it was.  No fuss.  Gave me extra time to prepare a nice side or dessert.

This was great and so easy!!  Next time I'll try using zesty italian dressing.  I also used low-fat cream cheese and fat-free cream of chicken soup and the taste was still great.

This is the best and easy idea for dinner.  Put it on and forget it until dinner.  I did make one change, I put the soup in at first so there is something moist to begin with...wow, this is aa super dish, my husband loves it.

I loved this recipe! I didn't realize it only needed to cook for 5-6 hrs when I put the chicken in the crockpot before I left for church and I was worried we would end up having to eat it for lunch. When we came home, the house smelled great and the chicken had a nice color to it. When I added the brick of cream cheese and one can of soup, I was worried it would taste too much like cream cheese. I was also worried that since I was going to try to keep it in the crockpot til dinnertime that it would thicken up too much or dry out, so I added another can of the soup and never turned the heat to high. It was wonderful! I cooked the noodles and threw them in with the soup for the last ten minutes or so. Everyone had seconds and it reheated well too. Thanks!

I really didn't like this recipe at all.  The only thing I can think of is that I may have messed it up because I didn't have dry salad dressing packets, so i used a substituted recipe i found online.  That may be why this wasn't so good, in my opinion.

Made it with chicken tenderloin, as that's what I had on hand. Used reduced-fat cream cheese. Cooked 4:30 on low, then added the soup & cream cheese. Some of the chicken was a little over-done, some was delicious. Mixture was too rich for my husband, who suggested half the cream cheese next time. Served it over bowtie noodles, with green beans.

For slow cooker fare, this is easily a "five." It couldn't be easier, and the great smell wafts throughout the house. One can easily serve a healthier version of this with low-fat cream of chicken soup and low-fat cream cheese. My wife and son both enjoyed it.

I tried this recipe today and it turned out awesome! I added soup, margarine and dressing mix with chicken legs(I like their tenderness) and thinned with 1/2 c. milk. Cooked only 3.5 hours (I would have waited 4 hours if my husband wasn't drooling already). I threw in some broccoli and carrots half way for nutrition. Then added 3 oz. 1/3 less-fat cream cheese, 2 tablespoons of sour cream and cooked another 10 min. Served it over spaghettis. It was soooo delicious!!

This is excellent comfort food - great for a cold night.  I took others advise and to avoid it being too salty used unsalted butter, fat free cream cheese and fat free cream of chicken soup.  The aroma filled the house while it was cooking and when the family arrived home their mouths were watering.  every last drop was eaten.  Next time I will make extra!

For me the cooking time was way off. Only took 3 hours total or It would have probally been dry. I put the seasoning in, chicken, butter and 1/2 cup broth. I wasnt gonna put the broth in but the butter and seasoning were sticking to the crockpot. Cooked for 2 hours than put the soup in and cream cheese. Next time ill use only half of the cream cheese. This smelled great!! This was an above average meal (3.5) but I felt like this was strong for my taste and does need something to thin out the flavor. If I do make again I think brocolli would go perfect! Thanks.

Excellent! I made mine with Quorn fake chicken and it worked magnificently. Note: wet Italian salad dressing can be substituted for dry dressing.

So easy and was a big hit! Like others, I lightened up by using 98% fat free soup and reduced fat cream cheese.  Put chicken breast in whole and shredded in crockpot after cooked.  Added peas and pearl onions -- definitely needs veggies to be one-pot meah -- and severd on whole wheat egg noodles.  Served with cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit to taste.

This was really good, but I definetly had to modify it a bit.  The first time I made it I was pretty unsure about putting in the chicken with so little else with it, and I was right to be - if I hadn't added a two cans of the soup halfway through it definetly would have burned.  So I modified it based on a recipe I already had that was very similar but for beef.  I added three cans soup, a packet of Garlic and Herb mix rather than the Italian dressing mix (just because that's what I had on hand) and a cup of Sprite along with the chicken in the beginning.  I know the Sprite sounds weird but it turns out so good.  Then when I was about ready to serve it, I added in half a block of cream cheese and a little milk, and served it over egg noodles.  Maybe my crock pot cooks too hot or something, but the way the recipe was written I'd have to give it about 2 stars - once I modified it though it's worth 5 - my husband LOVES it.  If you have a larger crock pot like I do, definetly put everything in first!

Actually very scrumptious. I was pleasingly surprised. I'm not a lover of mushrooms but this tasted very much like the beef stroganoff w/ mushroom without the dreded mushrooms.

This is my new favorite crock-pot chicken recipe.  So easy and so delicious.  I didn't have margarine so I used regular butter and for the italian mix I used good seasons.  So delicious.  I did cook mine for 5 hours and that was plenty adding in the soup and cream cheese at the 4 hour mark.  Served over egg noodles.  Will make again and again.

My hubby and I LOVED this. It's sooo easy and yummmm.  Rather than using a packaged of dry italian dressing, I made my own so that it was a perfect blend for our tastes. Also, I used cream of mushroom soup which I highly recommned! This is a wonderful meal to be served on egg noddles!

This is really yummy with a few alterations. I didn't use a slow cooker, and it was still easy and delicious. I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup and low-fat cream cheese. I would definitely add white wine and only use 4 oz. of cream cheese. Mix with 12-16 oz. of pasta and chopped flat-leaf parsley. Yum!

The first time I  made this, the flavor was really good, but something was wrong with the consistency. It was incredibly thick, more like a spread than a sauce, and I never figured out what was wrong. I was thinking about making it again and looked at the recipe, when I realized my blunder! I used too much cream cheese! I used almost twice as much as the recipe called for...no wonder it was so thick! I am definitely going to give this a try again, being careful to only use the called for amount of cream cheese this time!

Super recipe-I wondered about it as it cooked, but no worries-This is a wonderful, easy recipe! I used light cream cheese and next time I will try the low fat cream of chicken soup, but as the recipe is written, it is just super. I threw together a spinach salad and heated a can of green beans, loved it!

I made this the original way the first time and LOVED IT!!!!!  Tonight I only have ground turkey and rice.  I'm gonna throw in a can of diced green chiles at the end, just for a little zip.  I'll let you know how it turns out.

It turned out GREAT!!!!  I just put the ground turkey mixture over white rice.  I served steamed veggies on the side.  All 3 of my kids ate it.  FYI...I always use light cream cheese, and low fat chicken soup, it does not change the taste.  Thanks for a great go to dinner.

So good an easy!  I followed as directed except did add fresh mushrooms, powdered onion and garlic and big splash white wine at the start.  Will make this often this winter!

This is easy and good, but a little rich depending on your tastes. I used 98% fat free soup and fat free cream cheese. So, for the lowfat version, the richness is amazing! I did add milk at the end to thin the sauce. My honey liked the seasoning. Will make again.

This came out so well! I did add fresh mushrooms, chopped onion and white wine to the chicken before adding the cream cheese and soup. My fiance loved it, said it wasn't too rich and still light.

Everyone in my house loves this dish.  My teenage boys and their friends love when I make it.  Although I do make a couple of additions to the recipe.  I like to add mushrooms and peas and I prefer cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken soup.

This was good! I made some substitutions and additions. First, placed the chicken breasts (2 large frozen), Italian dressing mix, butter, 1 cup of mushrooms and a healthy splash of white wine in the slow cooker, cooked on low for 4 hours. Removed chicken, cubed it and placed back in slow cooker then added about a 1/2 cup of chicken stock and 1 can of Cream of Chicken with Mushroom soup to the mix, continued cooking on low for 2 hours. About 30 minutes before serving added 2 oz of softened cream cheese, 8 oz of sour cream, 2 tablespoons of chives and a small jar of pimientos. Served over egg noodles and it was fantastic. Paired with fresh green beans stirfried in bacon, onion and vinegar (topped with lemon pepper). Had leftovers for lunch today and it was even better. A great comfort meal and in this day and age....we need all of that we can get.  

PS. I used lowfat and reduced sodium products as I normally do (except butter). Doesn't take away any flavor only unneeded fat calories.

My family and I loved this recipe. I am all about easy and this was just that. Next time I will double the batch and freeze some. I served this over homemade egg noodles from this site since I didn't have enough of the store bought kind and I will probably never buy noodles again. Yummy!

We loved this. Nice change from our normal canned soup and chicken in the crockpot. Much more flavor. I didn't have all of the ingredients (italian dressing mix) but was able to substitute with typical italian spices from the cabinet. I also put a splash of red wine in with the chicken, butter and spices and it was delish! Don't be afraid to use fat free soup or cream cheese - you can't tell the difference. Great recipe that you can easily substitute to suit your family's taste. Thanks for posting!!

This was so good for not a lot of work.  I did use butter instead of margarine, 1/2 fat free cream cheese and 1/2 of the 1/3 less fat, also the low sodium, low fat cream of chicken soup. Will definately make it again

My whole family loved this dish. Very easy to make and the house smelled wonderfull all day long. I wasnt paying attention and added Ranch dressing mix instead of Italian and it still came out great, so that may be a nice variation.

This recipe was very easy to make and quite tasty.  I'm not sure if I will make this too often, as it was a little too rich tasting.  We like to eat a bit lighter, and this dish bogged you down a bit.  But other than that, it really tasted good. :)

I thought this recipe was very good.  I followed the instructions as written but when I added the soup and cream cheese I also added 1/3 cup of white wine.  It really kicked it up a notch!  It was a little rich though with so much cream cheese and next time I may not add quite as much, but it was still delicious and very easy to make.

I think the whole packet of seasoning was a bit too much. My fiance and I both couldn't finish our plates. If I do make it again, I will for sure cut the packet in half. I also cut the cream cheese in half and added about a 1/3 cup of sour cream. I added peas and carrots.

This wasnt bad at all. I did modify it some though nothing to taste altering. I noticed a good amount of other reviews say that this was salty and the chicken was dry. I used fat free I cant believe its not butter spray in place of butter. I also added a whole can of low sodium chicken broth in the crock pot for the chicken to cook in the chicken was very moist. The ckicken I cooked the night before and stuck it inthe fridge so it only had to cook around 45 minutes the next day. I did have to add 2 tbs of flour to thicken it up at the end so next time I will use just a half of a can. I also used low fat cream cheese and low fat low sodium cream of chicken. I'm glad I did I can see how regular higer sodium would have made it to salty. Next time I will use 2 packet od italian dressing and the broth did seem to dilute the spices. I served this over noodles and added peas at the end (simply so my 2 year old didnt have them rolling all over her plate. My family including my inlaws quite enjoyed it and my mother in law asked me for the recipe. This was a perfect easy and quick meal before a soccer game. Next time I may add half white wine half broth to the crock pot next time to see how it changes the flavor.

Pretty good base recipe. I altered a bit, though. I added 1/4 cup white wine and used italian dressing in place of the dry dressing. I put all the ingredients in at once and added milk to thin it out as it was so thick. 

Turned out to be amazing! Not too thick, not too runny.. just right! 

Will make again, and add some onions and peas half an hour before serving.

I made this for dinner tonight.  We thought it was THE BEST.  I did use thighs cut into bite size pieces and sauteed a package of sliced Portabella mushrooms to add with the cream of mushroom soup.  I also used low fat when I could.  This is a keeper for our family.  Next time I am going to try adding frozen peas at the end also for color.

I followed other reviewers suggestions and used olive oil instead of butter and I used low fat cream cheese and low fat/low sodium soup. My husband & I enjoyed the flavor of this very much. It was creamy and had just the right seasoning.
I gave the recipe to my daughter and she and her husband really liked it also. The chicken was so tender I was able to give it to my 10 month old granddaughters. They seemed to like it too!

i usually don't rate a recipe unless I make it to the tee, but this is a good base recipe. I used frozen cutlets,frozen peas,shredded carrots and fresh mushrooms. I cooked on hi for 4 hrs, and added the vegetables towards the end. Really good recipe if you are home going out (sports,errands,etc) and will be home in 4 hrs. Would definitely make again.

Great easy recipe.  I read some of the other posts so I made some changes. First, I didn't cut the chicken breasts. I added 1/2 cup of white cooking wine, some crushed red pepper, fresh garlic, a package of sliced mushrooms which I sauteed and used lite cream cheese. I also didn't  read the instructions and put all the ingredients in at once.  The sauce was probably thinner than if I had added some of the ingredients later but we prefer it that way. I would definitely make it this way again.

This is "to die for" good!!  I substituted boneless, skinless chicken thighs for the breasts, just because I prefer dark meat.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter.  It was so rich and creamy!  My husband had seconds, which he doesn't do very often.  Excellent recipe - thanks so much for sharing!

This was so delicious.  I have made several slow cooker dishes and havent found any that I really like until now!  I did add fresh mushrooms but it really didnt need it.  The origional recipie is great how it is.  My picky kids even ate it and my 5 year old said it was delicous.  I will be making this over and over again.

I too was hesitant about just putting chicken, butter and the dry seasoning in the crock pot, but it turned out wonderful!  Sauce was just a little too rich for my liking.  May not use as much cream cheese next time and see if that helps.  This really is a wonderful 'busy day' dish to keep around.

This is a great recipe, but we prefer to have it with rice and my family has always called it "Italian Chicken". It is one of the regular recipes at our house that we keep all the ingredients on hand for.

Very good dish and I'm not a huge fan of chicken in the crock.  I used 1/2 envelope of italian dressing and mixed it with about 1/4 - 1/2 cup water first.  I sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder and freshly ground black pepper too.  Also used 1/3 red. fat cream cheese and 98% fat free cream of mushroom.  Took 4 hours total in my 4 qt crock.

WOW!  I didn't have any chicken but I did have boneless porkchops so I cut those up. I also added about 1/2 cup of light sour cream with the soup and cream cheese.  INCREDIBLE!  Couldn't have been easier. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!

This recipe was excellent! I served over pasta.  The sauce was yummy. I used frozen chicken breasts, and cut them up once then were done cooking.  It still was done in plenty of time.  Also, next time I will double up on the sauce ingredients (everything but the chicken).  We had chicken left over, but no sauce.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  It was easy to cook, and when cooked on High, took half the time.  We served this with hot buttery noodles and the flavors were really simple yet excellent.

Fabulous!  I used frozen chicken breasts, reduced fat soup and reduced fat cream cheese.  I also only used half of the seasoning packet.  I put a chicken boullion cube in with 1/2 cup water and omitted margarine. Served over whole wheat penne noodles.  A big hit!  Thanks

This was very good and very easy to make! I would recommend this to anyone! I used olive oil, rather then butter, low fat cream of chicken soup and low fat cream cheese and put it over whole grain noodles!  Will make this again!  Thank you!

This recipe is very good.  I wouldn't change a thing except it was a little too thick at the end so I added a little pasta water from the egg noodles I was boiling to the slow cooker and that did the job!  The flavor is great.

Very simple recipe. It is tasty, but very rich; I had to thin it out a bit with skim milk because it is very thick if you follow the recipe exactly. Next time I make it, I'll do a low fat version (which is what I originally intended), with low fat cream of chicken soup, low fat cream cheese, or neuchatel. I wanted to follow exactly the first time to see how it would turn out, and how I could improve upon it. Overall, it was pretty good. I used fettucine pasta instead of the suggested rice.

Ok so first let me admit that I very LOOSELY followed this recipe but it was a great base to my tasty creation. So heres what I did; I started with 2 b/l s/l ck breasts cut into bite size pieces. In a deep skillet I added 2T butter, 1/4 chopped onions, 2T garlic and the chicken. I browned the chicken and set aside. With the skillet still hot I added enough chicken broth to remove the ck bits then added the crm of ck soup ,4oz of cream chz & 1/2 pack of Italian dressing mix then reduced the heat to low-med (4 on an electric stove) and simmered. I added 1 pkg of spinach and simmered for a total of 15min (Stir often). I served over egg noodles. It was GREAT!!

I used what I had in the pantry, cream of chicken and mushroom, and added 1/4 onion finely chopped. Yumm :)

Added fresh garlic and a splash of sherry at the beginning; used cr of chicken and cr of mushroom soups; used less than 1/2 the cream cheese (lite); added mushrooms; stirred in about 1/2 c lite sour cream right at the end and lots of fresh cracked black pepper. A keeper.

We LOVE this and have made it a regular at our house. Even my picky 10 yr old will eat two helpings. Sometimes I use cream of mushroom soup instead--whatever I have in the pantry. I serve it with steamed broccoli.

This was very good! I just used the chicken and salad dressing mix, on low, for 4 hours. Then I added 98% fat free soup and 3 oz reduced fat cream cheese. I also tossed in a bag of frozen broccoli for an additional hour. Quite tasty, served over rice...husband liked it:-)

This was extremely easy and tasted good.  But not so good that I'll make it again anytime soon.  After all is said and done, it just reminded me of one of the chicken or tuna helpers I used to make back when I didn't cook often.

I added a dash or two of garlic powder and oregano and a splash of white wine. It was super simple to make. It could have been a little more flavorfull; I may add a few things next time, but I will make it again.

This is my daughter's favorite!  I like to start with partly frozen chicken because it is easier to cut and it seems to do better in the crock pot.  You get a different texture if you cook it on low all day as opposed to on high for a couple of hours.  Either way it is good!

I used golden cream of mushroom soup instead and added a splash of white wine. Yummy.

Stellar even before you add (fat free) cream cheese and (98% reduced) condensed soup! I'm so glad I came across this one otherwise I would never have known you could cook chicken in the crockpot like this without using any liquid. It's amazing! I can't believe I made something relatively low fat that tastes this good and I'm amazed at how brown and tender the chicken is. Bravo!

This was really good.  I did doctor it up with garlic powder, and thinned it out with white wine and milk, and added T. butter.  Served over rice.  Next time I will reserve a tiny bit of the italian dressing packet for the sauce.  Very easy and tasty.

This was great over wide egg noodles.  Not highly flavorful, but a nice comfortable mixture of flavor and creamy texture. I might try adding some garlic or extra Italian seasoning for a more bold taste.  Overall very good and super easy.

WOW - How easy was that!  I did it a little different to make it go a little further, per my sister's advice.  I just cooked the chicken as stated, before adding other ingredients, I removed chicken, shredded it with 2 forks and removed any fat that was still on it.  After I added the other ingredients to the slow cooker and mixed them up well, I stirred the shredded chicken back into the mix. I also added my cooked bow tie pasta at the same time. So very yummy.  Thank you for sharing.

I made this one busy day for myself and my daughter.  Followed the recipe exactly except my chicken was frozen so I allowed it to cook 2 extra hours. I used a package of noyolks noodles and boiled them separately then added them to the crock pot and mixed it all together.  Was a huge hit with my daughter and I took the leftovers to work and my co worker loved it too.

This recipe was so easy and sooooo delicious! I combined the soup with the chicken and added the cream cheese at the end. I also added a little chicken broth to thin the sauce out.

This was so good and easy!  I diced half of a sweet onion and cooked it with the chicken. I used regular cream of chicken soup and reduced fat cream cheese.  I added half a cup of chicken broth to thin it out a little bit. I served it with grilled asparagus and flaky layer biscuits.  My boyfriend, roommate and I loved it.

Not giving 5 stars only because While it was very good, it wasn't over-the-top. Tossed everything in at once (as other reviewers had done) and everything came out fine. Served with egg noodles and peas -- yum!

This is a great recipe. I was a little nervous putting the chicken in the crock pot with only the margarine and dressing so I added some chicken broth just to cover the chicken. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It was really good. I served it over egg noodles. YUMMY!

We all liked this one a lot. I didn't have time to make this in the slow cooker, so I baked this in the oven at 350 for 45 min or so. I also added fresh button mushrooms because my hubby likes them.  The sauce is sooo good.  We mopped our plates with several slices of crusty bread. My little ones liked it, too.

Instead of adding the soup I sauteed a package of sliced button mushrooms in butter and added 1/2 cup of cream and 1/2 cup of fat free milk then poured it into the slow cooker. I also added 1 tsp of garlic powder, a couple dashes of frank's red hot and 1 tsp of onion powder. It was very good this way. I believe it took care of the too salty problem. Otherwise I followed the recipe as indicated.

Big hit at my house, even with my 4 and 6 year old.  Mada a couple of changes - used cream of mushroom instead of chicken, added a jar of sliced mushrooms and 1 cup of sour cream.  Will make again.

This recipie tasted great and was very simple. I added a can of chicken broth in the crock pot while the chicken cooked to ensure the chicken did not get dry and enhanced the flavor. Before it was done I thickened the sauce with some flour. There was enough of this for 6 servings.

This recipe is amazing! I'm surprised so many reviewers found it salty, because I didn't have that problem at all. I made the recipe pretty much as is except I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. I also added about a quarter cup of red wine, which I think made the recipe even better. This recipe, while not healthy, is hearty and fantastic. Even the leftovers are delicious!

I saw this recipe today and tried it today. I followed the recipe except I added a chopped onion, a can of condensed Cream of Mushroom soup and 1/4 can of water because the sauce was really thick. I also only used 1/2 of the cream cheese. It's seasoned nicely, not salty. And once the chicken began to cook (with just the dry seasoning and margarine), it generated its own juices. I cut short the cooking time because the chicken began to shred (which really isn't a bad thing). I served it over pasta and my children enjoyed it. It's not the most attractive dish in the world, but it's good.

Another keeper!!!  I considered the other reviews and I added a small chopped onion, only 1 Tbs butter, and used half can of each: cream of chicken and cream of mushroom and half the packet of Italian Seasoning... WOW!** Note to self, not that's it's bad, but it's very rich, so try the reduced fat and/or fat free soups/cheese!

My family and I loved this recipe. It was so incredibly easy and it tasted like good down home cooking. A little pepper to top it off and it was a perfect meal. Thank you    .

Great recipe the food was demolished in no time !! no leftovers. I followed the instructions when adding the chicken pieces, dry mix and margarine but I also added thin slices of onion, a can of sliced mushrooms and a red bell pepper (gave it a touch of colour), also added salt and pepper. Will definitely be making this one again, thanks for sharing.

Wow!  This was great and so easy.  I didn't have a packet of Italian dressing so I just seasoned it liberally with Mrs. Dash's original blend (probably a tablespoon or so) and added 2 Tbs. of margarine.  It was fantastic over egg noodles.

Great recipe, I did change a couple of things:)  I just put the breasts in the cooker with Original Mrs. Dash, the margarine and a splash of cooking wine.  And I added fresh Parmesean cheese on top to make it a little gooey.  It needs a bit more of a "bite" to it, I don't know if the Italian seasoning would give enough bite....
Anyhow, this is a good one to experiment with.

This was very good and easy.  I would recommend adding a little more dressing mix (maybe 1 1/2 packages).  I served it with rice and it made a great "chicken and rice" dish.

This is soooo good! My boyfriend and I loved it! I used fat free cream cheese and it was still excellent! I also put it on top of cooked whole wheat egg noodles. This was so easy, I will definitely be making it again!

Excellent recipe. This is one of our favorite slow-cooker meals. I do add a bit of white wine with the chicken and seasoning in the beginning and use Neufatchel instead of regular cream cheese. Total comfort food. Thanks!

Oh my heavans - this is sooo good!  Not for the calorie conscience, but yum!  I pretty much followed the recipe, except I experimented by leaving 2 breasts whole and cutting 2 into large cubes. Both ways came out fine. I also used 3 TBS of butter instead of 2 b/c my chicken breasts were quite large. I ended up removing much of the melted butter before adding the soup and cream cheese. The sauce is a little thick, so I think next time I might try to add some milk or something to thin it out a bit. Served over bow-tie and wagonwheel pasta (I was using up two partial boxes).

5 stars and then some.  This was so good.  My kids gave it 5 stars too.  I did make a few changes though based on what I had on hand.  I also decided to add a little liquid while cooking the chicken as I noticed it looked like it was getting dry quickly. Here are my changes/additions: - added @ 1/2 cup chicken broth with chicken and butter - used a packet of stroganoff mix in place of italian dressing - added another @ 1/2 cup chicken broth after chicken was cooked - used reduced fat cream cheese Turned out great!

This was a good recipe.  The chicken was a little well done and I only cooked it 4 1/2 hours.  Some of the pieces burned also from the seasoning mix and not enough liquid.  I would however try to make this again and add a little liquid at the beginning.

I really like this recipe!  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and  omitted the cream cheese for an 8 oz container of lite garlic and herb cheese spread (like Alouette, but the off-brand). I was worried that the combination of that and the italian seasonings might be too much, but quite to the contrary, the flavors were just right.  My chicken was thawed when I put it in, and cooking time really maxed out at 3 hrs on high.  Served over brown rice is delicious, but I think I might try wild rice next time.  Some people talked about the chicken overdrying.  Two things: don't use any more than 1.5 lbs of chicken, and make sure the sauce coats the chicken very well while cooking.  (Of course, don't overcook.) I'll be making this again for sure!

This was a very tasty recipe.  I used chive cream cheese and skinless chicken thighs (chicken breasts can be so expensive these days).    The dark meat was so moist and so tasty.  My husband said that he would use plain cream cheese next time since the ital. seasoning added so much flavor already.  I would like to also add some white wine and mushrooms next time. Overall it was really good. I served it over egg noodles.  Yummy!

I tried this recipe twice with mediocre results.  The first time I followed it to a T and ended up with a burnt lump of chicken.  The second time I added in the soup at the same time as the chicken.  It ended up being super dry.  We had to add some broth to loosen it up again.

This is a great recipe. I love to start it early in the morning before work...coming home to this wonderful smell is fabulous! As another reviewer said, it seems strange to just leave the chicken with just the butter and dressing mix, but it turns out great! My picky 4 year old even likes this. When I have leftovers, I bring them into work and the guys think I'm the best cook ever! Everyone raves. Not low fat/salt, etc, but very good and quick!

This was tasty! The chicken smelled wonderful slow cooking in the Italian dressing mix. I used 8 oz of garden vegetable cream cheese & tossed in some leftover veggie dip I'd made with ranch seasoning & sour cream. I also added some fresh mushrooms. Next time I think I may only use one instead of both as the flavors did compete a little. I think I'll also add a package of Knorr vegetable mix next. Yum!

Yum, Yum, Yum is all we could say while eating!!!  After reading the reviews, I used 1 can of Cream of Chicken/Mushroom instead of only Cream of Chicken.  I didn't have plain cream cheese, so I used my container of whipped cream cheese with chives and onions.  Served over angel hair pasta and can't wait to make it again!!!

This recipe was definitely edible, but  I will cut down on the cream cheese next time.  I used a splash of white wine in the beginning as others did, and also  substituted the cream of chicken with cream of mushroom.  Next time, I plan to use about 1 part cream cheese and three parts sour cream, to avoid the overly sweet taste I found using all cream cheese.  Like other though, I did like the way the chicken roasted, due to the lack of moisture at the start.  Pretty good stuff.

I used thighs and had no margarine so I skipped that. I used 3oz. cream cheese and 8 oz. sour cream. Very creamy and the chicken was very tender. I think next time I am going to add some onions and mushrooms to the mix, that will make it even better!

this recipe was good but as others have said it is VERY salty...and we love salt but it was even a little much for us!  I put in an extra can of soup and there still could have been more sauce for my liking.  my 7 year old son would have eaten it all if we had let him it was a hit with him!  I'll probably make it again but try to cut down the salt at least a bit.

**Update: My husband took the leftovers to work the next day and he said they were even better, we just tossed the stroganoff over the pasta in a container so it was all warmed together...next time I'll toss the cooked noodles into the stroganoff the last 30 minutes or so.

I'm really rating the recipe with the  modifications suggested by other reviewers. I omitted the butter. In the crock pot I put one can of low sodium low fat cream of chicken soup, one envelope of Italian dressing mix, garlic powder, salt and pepper, onion, white wine, 1/2 can worth of water, and 3.25 lbs skinless chicken thighs. After the chicken was cooked I added only 4oz of cream cheese. After tasting this, I agree with other reviewers that 4oz is plenty and adding more would not be good. The resulting dish was very tasty and the chicken was moist and so tender it fell off the bones. I served this over noodles as suggested, but DH thought it would also be nice with mashed potatoes so I think I'll try it that way next time. Thanks for a nice recipe.

My family just loved this recipe.  When I first looked at it I was worried that it was too "bland" for them but when they lined up at the crock pot for seconds I knew this was going to be added to my permenant recipe box.  Only modification I made was to add a package of fresh mushrooms.

It was okay.  My kids and husband really enjoyed it, otherwise I would have given it 3 stars.  It needed more spices, I believe, but I'm not sure.  I added 1/2 can of chicken broth because I was going to be out all day and didn't want to risk it burning with no liquid.  I served it over egg noodles.  I may make this again, but it's not a "must-do".

Such an easy recipe and my toddler loved it!  I didnt have all the ingredients, but mixed and matched from other suggestions.  Used a Cream of Mushroom, cup of sherry, Lipton Ranch flavored mix, and the whole 8 oz of cream cheese.  Served over egg noodles.

This was perfect for a family meal.  I used bone-in chicken and it fell off the bone.  Hubby and kids LOVED it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was just ok.  While everyone I had over really seemed to like it, I thought it was salty and a little bland.  I tweaked it according to other reviewers' suggestion, so maybe if I make it again I'll stick to the original recipe.

It just does not get any better than this!  Here is what I did differently:  I used two cans of soup because we love our extra sauce around here, and I added about a half cup of white cooking wine.  These were both added in the beginning, based on the advice of other reviewers.  I did everything else the same as the original recipe and served over egg noodles.  Can't recommend this one enough.

Awesome! I was reluctant to leave the crockpot all day without much (or any) liquid in it, but this turned out excellent. I put 3 large frozen boneless breasts, 1/8C of cooking wine, 1 whole packet of italian seasoning and 1 can cream of mush soup in and left it all day. I added 6 oz of cream cheese and dollop of sour cream, and some fresh mushrooms twenty minutes before we ate it. Served over rice. My whole family LOVED it....even the picky 5 yr old!.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I cooked the chicken in the soup all day and instead of using Italian Salad Dressing mix, I used onion-mushroom soup mix and it was delicious!  It took the cream cheese a little longer than 30 minutes to melt entirely - I'd soften it next time rather than putting it in directly from the fridge.

Made this for dinner tonight... Followed the recipe exactly as written and it's so good!!  After tasting it I decided to add a little bit of half and half to help cut the saltiness and thin the sauce out a little bit.  Would probably try reduced sodium soup next time, but either way it's great!  Served over egg noodles and my super picky five year old asked for seconds!  Thanks for a super easy, great recipe!!

I have made this original to the recipe and really enjoyed it, but I've also made this on the stove with ground chicken... AMAZING!  I have found a few of the suggestions of other reviews, and my own preferences, have really made this a more than 5 star EASY dinner!
A little white wine adds so much depth to the flavor!  My family prefers the full packet of dressing because we also add broccoli and mushrooms.  
Again, it's great as written, but I love the help of suggestions to really kick it up!

Super easy. My family loves it. I add sliced and whole baby portobello mushrooms towards the end cook time, serve over wide, yolk free egg noodles with shredded parmesan and fresh parsley sprinkled on top. Going to make this for dinner tomorrow actually!

I liked this dish it was very tasty, I did cut the recipe in half for the two of us and I may make it again because it was so easy.
But this is not Stroganoff and calling it Stroganoff will never make it so. :-)

I made it as written (but I did add some sour cream at the end) and it was very good! And I love how easy it is. Next time, and there will be a next time, I'll shred the chicken and maybe add a little Italian seasoning to enhance the dressing mix. Good recipe! ??

Excellent. I almost always tweak recipes. This is the first time I made this so I followed the recipe and it came out great. It has flavor but not “spicy” Kids will love it. I don’t feel the need to change a thing and it couldn’t be easier to make. Definite keeper. I wish these

So easy to put together and, it was fantastic.  I had enough leftover to freeze for a later date. I did add some portobello mushrooms and some cherry tomatoes toward the end.

This recipe sounded interesting and had a lot of great reviews so I gave it a try. I didn’t have margarine so I used butter which worked just as well. I also took the advice of another reviwer and added a can of mushrooms. It was very tasty. I will definitely make it again.

I give it a 5 for ease - so simple. The Italian seasoning adds a taste different than normal stroganoff - it was a bit strong on day one but day 2 was really good.

Not really impressed. Followed the directions precisely and will make adjustments next time. Just tasted like cream of chicken soup over noodles to me.

No changes made. I used mashed potatoes as the bed, as I’m limited to what I can eat right now (no rice allowed in my diet). It went over well with the family! My son loves cheese, so he did add cheese to his. Loved the recipe! Very easy!

The chicken was moist and delicious and the packet of Italian seasoning was very good - I didn't feel like the recipe needed any more seasoning. However, the addition of the cream cheese made it too thick and it just felt like we were eating cream cheese and butter on noodles. 

If I ever make it again, I'll substitute the cream cheese with a cream that's not quite as a thick or calorie dense as cream cheese and I'll probably do mushrooms instead of butter, like some of the other commenters.

I have made this multiple times and it’s always a hit. Today I didn’t have all the ingredients so I improvised and it still turned out delicious. Instead of the Italian dry seasoning dressing packet, I used garlic salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, Italian seasoning and a little Olive Garden Italian dressing. Then I only had Garden Vegetable cream cheese. Still really tasty!

It is great! FYI, I didn’t have 4 hours to slow cook so I put it on high for 1 hour with the chicken cubed, butter & Italian mix and it cooked up perfect! Then I added the soup and cream cheese on low for a half hour and it was great. So if you don’t have the time, try it on high! Just as good!

I have made this for my family several times now. The kids and hubby give it 2 thumbs up! SO EASY! I too have just put frozen chicken breasts straight in and it turns out great. I prefer to add  low fat sour cream with half the cream cheese.  Have used Healthy Request cream of mushroom or cream of chicken soup and both taste great. Serve over rice or pasta and add steamed broccoli as the side.

Yum! Devoured by my family of 4 (have two other littles, but one is super picky and the other an infant)
made as directed with light cream cheese and reduced fat cream of chicken. Added 1/2c milk to thin the sauce a bit. the chicken was cooking about 7 hours, I shredded the chicken- I'll heed the others advise and just put the breasts in whole and shred later, didn't need to cube them. Served over egg noodles

This is the second time I’ve made this. First time made exactly as written and turned out beautifully. Such comfort food!  This time I’m doubling and  using zesty Italian dressing, 1 can each cream of chicken and cream of mushroom and as 8oz can of  drained sliced mushrooms . I’m using chicken thigh this time. Will see how it turns out.  This original recipe is a keeper!

This was a huge hit! I doubled the seasoning, soup, and cream cheese because I was worried I had more chicken than the recipe. And because of that I just threw in the whole stick of butter. So definitely not a diet dish but a fabulous comfort food and so easy to fix!

I made this exactly how the recipe reads and it's really, really good. Next time I think I will leave the chicken breasts whole and shred them and then add the soup and cream cheese, but that's just a preference. It was delicious as is for sure!

Such amazing flavors but slightly dry chicken for my taste. In the future if I make it again, I’ll probably cook the soup from the beginning. I also added mushrooms at the end when I added the soup and cream cheese- if you like mushrooms I highly recommend.

One of our family favorites!! But this is only a five star recipe if you add wine. Add 1/2 to a cup of a dry or sweet white wine makes all the difference.

It is what it's meant to be.  An easy dinner idea. It tastes great but use the zero salt COC soup. Also, and this is crucial to any slow cooker recipe,  take the few extra minutes to sear the chicken with  med high heat and a little oil. DON'T  cut the cubes too small and go ahead and get that brown caramelisation on the chicken first. Deglaze the pan with a little h2o, or chicken broth ( better ) and pour that in too. Never put raw meat of any kind in a slow cooker.  Trust me it is Soooooo much better that way and it takes only a few extra minutes.

So easy to do, cooked in Crock Pot while out on a doctor appt and a little shopping afterwards.  Husband thought it was very tasty and possible to substitute shrimp in this recipe.  Will make it again!

I didn't have chicken breast, instead I used 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs. Followed the recipe, and I must say that it turned out great! I like mushrooms in my stroganoff so I added a drained jar, and the last 10 minutes I put in a half bag of frozen green peas. This is now in the dinner rotation. Thanks for the recipe!!!

This is a VERY simple to make meal and it tastes GREAT, But.........

Adding 0.7 Oz (!!) package of Italian salad dressing (dry) was/is FAR too much IMHO!!
"Maybe" 0.25 Oz UNLES you desire a REALLY Italian flavored dish. 
I'm hoping the recipe was a misprint for the quantity of the dry dressing, personally, but I am thankful I LIKE the flavoring, even with the excessive amount. 
Lastly, this is a somewhat bland recipe as is. No real spices tasted outside of the excess Italian dressing, IMO. 
I dressed mine up with a few big scoops of sour cream to give it a creamier texture, too.
Lastly, I HIGHLY suggest you NOT overwork the meat while blending and incorporating the soup and cream cheese. 
Doing so pretty much shreds the meat which is not typical of a "Stroganoff" meal. If you think about it, typical Beef Stroganoff has CHUNKS of meat throughout but if you aren't careful here, you'll have a shredded chicken Stroganoff-like meal over noodles. While tasty, the appeal will be lacking and more like a gruel instead of a classy meal. 
Using the changes I've implemented and (perhaps) some of other contributors, I can see myself making this again. It is a simple meal you toss on the crockpot (slow cooker) after Sunday morning breakfast, walk away for 4-6 hours depending on your slow cooker, and enjoy the enticing aromas throughout your home right up until dinner time. 
What a truly easy, tasty, filling, and enjoyable meal for a family and/or friends.

I added some mushrooms and used cream of mushroom soup--stroganoff says mushroom soup not chicken to me! So delicious. Next time will try it with ranch dressing. We loved it over wide noodles.

I added 1/4 cup of milk to make the soup less salty. Instead of using a slow cooker. I used the skillet and cooked the chicken pieces with butter. I added half an onion to the mix of chicken, butter, and Italian sauce.

Obviously play with it some to make it to taste. I eased up on the cream cheese. Otherwise it is a great dish. I have made it once for me and once for a potluck at work. I consider it successful if my crockpot comes away empty.

I actually didn't use a slow cooker. I was looking for a way to use up my rotisserie chicken breast. I put all the ingredients together and microwaved it. I enjoyed it very much and am looking forward to trying it in my crock pot. My husband said it was ok.

Dinner guests liked it and so did I.  I used 7 skinless, boneless thighs (2 lbs) and doubled the sauce recipe.  I used Neufchâtel instead of regular cream cheese and I can of regular cream of chicken soup and one fat free.  As mentioned by others, it’s decadently rich.  If I make it again,  I’ll cut down the calories even more.  It is one of the easiest recipes I’ve ever worked with.

Amazing so simple, yet soooo good. I put soup and Italian packet in crockpot along with chicken, cooked for 6 hours,  added cream cheese and cooked until it was mixed well. This is definitely a keeper.

My family loved this! I only had cream of chicken with herbs soup and it turned out great. My mom always added lots of black pepper to her beef stroganoff, so I did the same, and also added a few shakes of cayenne. Those additions really added depth to this and it cut through the creaminess. It was a huge hit!

The only addition I made was some fresh mushrooms about an hour before it was done.  I will definitely make this again.  I served it over mashed cauliflower since we're watching carbs.  I might add some hot paprika or other peppery spice next time, but you could always do that on individual servings.

This is a great recipe. I always add a package of whole baby bella mushrooms cut in 1/4ths, healthy recipe cream of chicken soup and Neufcatel cheese instead of  cream cheese to keep it on the healthier side. My husband loves it! I serve over whole wheat pasta.

Slow cooked for about 4 1/2 then added the soup and cream cheese with half can of water to rinse the can. Then cooked for another half hour. Very flavorful and delicious. Chicken breast still tastes a little dry. Served over white rice. I used about 2 lbs. chicken.

Yumm! Super easy. I used organic chicken thighs and added a pkg of fresh sliced mushrooms when adding the dressing mix and margarine and only one half of the cream cheese pkg (used neufchatel cheese (1/3 less fat)).  Served over cooked Essenhaus wide homestyle noodles.Delicious!

My husband and son who are not big chicken lovers loved this!!!  It took longer to cook than the time listed- not sure if was my oven.  Chicken was very tender and moist.  I did not dilute the soup and thought it was fine.   I did add a jar of mushrooms to the soup.  Only change I will make next time is to add 2 cans of soup.   My husband wished for more gravy.

Found it delicious just the way it is.  But instead of standard cream cheese, I used cream cheese with chives.

I had to change my review, I made the recipe exactly as is. I was not a big fan, I thought that it was too salty and the sauce too think. I wasn’t sure what all of the fuss was about. However my boyfriend raved about it. He said that it deserves 9 stars lol. So I guess it just comes down to personal taste and I was not a fan.

Followed the recipe but also other's suggestions for sodium free, fat free. Added white wine per another's suggestion. Turned out great. Made enough for leftovers which tasted just as good as the first.

Made with beef. Everyone loved it, will make again, but I wouldn't consider it a stroganoff. It would need, I think, to have sour cream in the recipe for a flavor that was closer. Still great recipe.

Loved this recipe! Well I’m not the type to follow a recipe to the tee but here’s what i did: used a big package of chicken that needed using out of the freezer (so it was all going in regardless). Had a can of fat free cream of chicken soup in the cabinet that was accidentally purchased (I usually don’t buy the fat free)-so to use that up this was perfect. Used regular cream cheese. Added some shakes of garlic salt and ground pepper. After done cooking decided to toss a handful of sharp shredded cheese. A little rich on its own but still really good. Wanted to add some easy veggies so I dumped in my bowl a big scoop of mixed veggies (peas, carrots, g beans and corn frozen bag mix). Mixed it all up with some pasta I also found in the cabinet and viola! My 2 year old also loved it!

Family favorite!  I double the sauce ingredients and added chicken broth (1 soup can for each can of soup used).  Next time I'll cook the chicken breasts whole and then shred/allow them to fall apart so they're more tender and juicy!  Served over egg noodles!

Regularly requested by family. We shred the chicken before serving. When I have it, I add 1/4c of a bright/fruity white wine.

We ended up really liking this recipe but only after making quite a few changes. I added a few portabella mushrooms, a 1/4 a cup of Worcestershire sauce, and about 6oz of beer (I used Miller, PBR would also be fine.) Without these additions, I have no idea how this recipe can be considered a "stroganoff." Without them, this recipe is still good but just tastes like any other chicken casserole. If you are making this dish, I highly recommend adding one or more of these ingredients, especially if you want your meal to actually resemble a stroganoff.

It didn't taste like I imagined it would but it's still really great.  Read comments that it was salty but I didn't find that at all, actually wish it was saltier. Will definitely try again with a different dressing mix next time!

We LOVE this dish! I typically add a teaspoon of garlic powder, as well as fresh ground pepper and sliced mushrooms. I top with fresh oregano and serve on top of noodles. I also typically make honey balsamic roasted Brussel sprouts as a side.

I really enjoyed this recipe but changed it quite a bit. When cooking the chicken, I added about 8-10 oz of chicken broth and a splash of red wine. Additionally I added 8oz of sliced mushrooms. For the soup, I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken. When the cream cheeese melted I added my cooked noodles to the crock pot just to let the mixture coat and soak in the noodles. Simply the best. Worked out great????

Definitely use the low sodium condensed cream of chicken soup. As it is, the recipe is really salty tasting. Other than that, it was really easy and good!

I didn't have dry Italian dressing on hand, so I used two packets of Goya Sazon instead - it was delicious!  Gave it a great color and flavor - the cream cheese is really creamy.  Didn't thicken up as much as I thought it would - stayed a soup-like consistency.  I'd make it again, and reduce the amount of liquid.

It needed more seasoning because the taste was kind of flat.  Maybe two packages of seasoning?  Other than that, it was rich and creamy.  I added a package of peas and carrots to it.

So of course, I added garlic salt, basil, and thyme, as seasoning is always subjective and to taste. I used a full stick of salted butter in the initial cooking, and ended up adding two cans of cream of mushroom soup and a can of mushroom stems and pieces. Finally, I added my wide egg noodles and added water and chicken broth as needed so as to not allow it to get overly thick to the point of burnt, as the pot would sit another six hours before being enjoyed.

I added half the can of milk, 1/2 TVs of fresh dill and a packet of dry onion soup mix to make more sauce cause we love things saaaaucy. I felt like I had to sneak in some sort of veggies to make it a complete well balanced meal so I added, mushrooms and broccoli. This recipe lacks flavor but with some changes so bomb

There must be a wide range of tastes out there - duh - for this recipe to get 4+stars.  We found the dish to be very bland, boring and unattractive visually.  Used the whole pack of salad dressing and could have used another one!  I could see kids liking this a lot so for working moms with young kids it's probably an ok recipe.  Been there, done that.  At this life stage, we prefer some zip to wake up our taste buds and this crock pot dish was sorely lacking there.

This is the second batch I made and my son says it is the best thing I ever made! Not sure about that but this is a very simple recipe with great results! I added 1/2 cup of sour cream. My son added some hot sauce. I doubled it to have some to freeze

Very good and tasty!  I wasn't prepared with the chicken, so I placed 2 large frozen chicken breasts in my cooker. After an hour or so I took them out and cut them up.  Added the other ingredients a little later.   It was ready shortly after. Really easy to make and tastes great!  Thank you for this recipe.

Not the most complex flavors, but still a very flavorful dish. I made this for my lunches while meal prepping for the week.

Made a few small changes:
-Used chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts
-Included mushrooms
-Because of the addition of the mushrooms, I was worried that there wasn't enough liquid in the pot for the first 6 hours, so I used an extra tablespoon of butter

A few additional notes for myself:
-I used Good Seasons Zesty Italian dressing.
-I kept the heat on low for another 1.5 hours after adding in the rest of the ingredients, rather than crank it up to high for a half hour. This worked fine.

Add in some rice and you've got a lunch that is creamy and cheesy, but surprisingly not too heavy.

My husband loved this dish.  I didn’t have any Italian dressing so I substituted a package of ranch dressing instead.  I think it came out just fine, I did add more black pepper to the recipe as it’s a little bland for my taste.  I will cook this recipe again.

A delicious recipe that clearly warrants leftovers. I tripled the recipe to feed a few extra folks and rolled the dice on having leftovers....WORTH IT! The flavor was awesome as is though in order to provide more 'substance' to it I diced 1 each medium green, red and orange peppers and 1 medium onion and sautéed them while cutting up the chicken. Since tripling the recipe I wanted to ensure the chicken would cook evenly so I partially cooked it in batches with the dried Italian dressing mix. When finished this step I added the margarine to the slow cooker and layered the chicken and pepper/onion mix then topped with the remaining 1/2 pack of dressing mix. The slow cooker was on high (4 hour). At about the 2 hour point I placed 2 packs of cream cheese on the slow cooker lid to soften it. At the 30 minute point I  mixed 2 cans of soup and 1 1/2 packs of cream cheese and stirred it into the crock. It was still pretty 'watery' so with about 10 minutes left I mixed 3 TS of corn starch with a couple TS of water and stirred it into the crock. 10 minutes later it was perfect. Again, a delicious meal.

After reading a lot of reviews, I added finely chopped onion, finely chopped mushroom (I have picky 6 and 8 yr olds and if they see anything of color or unknown shape they will not even try it). I also added a little garlic powder.  I have never left a review before, but my son loved this so much I had to. This is beyond amazing in my house. My 8 year old likes hot dogs, pancakes, waffles, chicken strips, and plain dry hamburgers. That's it. So yeah this warrants a 5 star!!!! If I was making it again, for just adults, I would have added fresh garlic, and probably pepper. But for picky eaters, this was absolutely perfect.

With a few changes this came out wonderful.  I substituted the margarine with butter and when I added the cream cheese and cream of chicken soup I also added 2 -3 Tablespoons of Dry Sherry wine.  The Sherry really changes the flavor profile of the dish.   Try it with the Sherry, it greatly improves the flavor!

This was my 2nd time making this dish, and I did a few things differently. I took the chicken breasts and tenderized them before cutting them into cubes. I put them into the slow cooker. I used 1/4 C melted butter instead of 1/8 C, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp salt and added the packet of Good Seasons Italian seasoning, mixing well. I poured it over the chicken and cooked as directed for 5 hours. I then softened the cream cheese, mixed it in the cream of chicken soup and poured over the chicken. Cooked for another 30 minutes. Served over egg noodles. The scallions shown in the picture weren't part of the recipe, but I chopped up about 1/2 cup of them and sprinkled over the dish after removing from the slow cooker. Much better taste in my opinion. Thanks to Judi Ann for the base recipe!

My husband and I plus one child loved it.  The other 3 kids  didn't "like the sauce." It is so good. I found a recipe on Allrecipes for an Italian seasoning mix to use in place of buying one because I'm not a fan of too much salt.  My husband said it was salty anyway and I am thirstier.   I added about 1/3 cup sour cream because I had it in the fridge and wanted to use it up.   I will make it again! Maybe the rest of my kids will like it the next time.

Won't be making this again. It was edible but not what I consider delicious. I think I would have liked it better with sour cream versus cream cheese.

This is 100 times easier if you put the four chicken breasts into the crockpot frozen and cook on high for 3-4 hours or low for 6-8. Then shred the meat before adding the soup and cream cheese. Otherwise, good flavor and good creamy consistency.

This is so easy and delicious just as written.  I do use real butter and will increase the amount just a tad since I am adding a little more chicken with 4 large chicken breasts.  As other reviewers have mentioned, don't worry about the lack of liquid, the butter and juices from the chicken is enough.  I have made this a few times, had it over egg noodles last night but is also good over rice.  Added a chopped onion this time, loved the flavor.

Super easy and my daughter asks for it frequently. I don't cube the chicken, I drop it in and then shred it before adding cream cheese.

This is a big hit in my family. Very very easy to make. It doesn't seem like there is enough liquid but trust me, the chicken turns out very juicy with just the butter and italian dressing. I recommend adding in mushrooms and/or broccoli.

Made this again tonight and still a favorite with the family! Loved how the chicken tastes with just the butter and seasoning (always think I am going to eat it just like that- but love the cream sauce after adding cream cheese and soup)!  Looking forward to leftovers in tomorrows lunch!

My husband and son enjoyed it, which is always a win. I used half onion mix and added some broth and white wine instead of water for cooking chicken pieces. I added soup early without mixing cream cheese and it curdled a bit- so I would follow directions next time. I also added cremini mushrooms and cream of mushroom soup- yum.
It was good but rich definitely something I would make once in awhile as it was not the kind of food I eat every day.

3 stars only because I would eat it again in a super pinch if I had the ingredients. It tasted very processed to me though. I would have preferred less soup mixture. Probably won't make again, husband hated it. :/

So I am definitely not a pro yet at cooking and was looking to see if anybody could help. Not going to give this a bad review because I believe I did something wrong. When I made this recipe I use chicken tenderloins instead of breasts follow the recipe to a T. I had left the house to run some errands. When I got back after about 6 hours my chicken burnt to the bottom of my slow cooker I don't know if it was because I didn't use thick enough chicken or maybe I cooked it too long I cooked it on low. If anybody has any advice please please let me know other than the burnt chicken it tasted amazing.

Looking for easy food for others to make instead of frozen pizza. For that purpose, it was great and healthier. To me it was "ok."

Used x2 cream cheese.
Added coarse ground black pepper.
Added garlic powder.
Used 1lb noodles to the pot.

Made this today following the exact recipe except for doubling it. It was a bit scary as there are just the three ingredients at the start of the recipe, but the reviews made me confident this was going to turn out,  and this had to feed 10 hungry people!  It turned out so incredibly tender and so wonderfully creamy. It drew raves from our adult children, their spouses and even the two picky  grandkids.! This will be made many times I can tell in the foreseeeable future.

Wow - this came out surprisingly great!  Two subs - swapped an envelope of dry Ranch dressing for the Italian and Cream of Chicken/Mushroom combo condensed soup (just what I had handy).    Served over broccoli instead of rice/noodles to keep carbs low.

Tastes great but does NOT taste like stroganoff.  Easy to make, chicken tender, and I actually added baby bellas.  I would give it more stars because of great flavor but again...tastes nothing like stroganoff.

I didn't have dry seasoning, so I used Italian salad dressing. I put that, butter, a little milk, cream of mushroom soup, and a can of mushrooms in with the butter and chicken and cooked overnight. I added the cream cheese in the morning, cooked up some egg noodles and had an early lunch. I love it!

So good. I didn't have the Italian seasoning so I just used onion and garlic powder and it was still delicious. I also was hungry and only cooked it for 3 and a half hours and it was still fine.

Yes, I would make it again! I did add some things: fresh mushrooms, basil, fresh parsley, oregano, & used butter in place of margarine (used less). Also, added diced onion & fresh garlic, substituting bone broth, low fat cream of chickensoup, & Neufchâtel. I used the rest of a chicken we had grilled on the pellet grill instead of cubed chicken breast, serving it over egg noodles. It tasted rich and delicious - my family really enjoyed it

Why so many steps?  If you're using a crock pot the whole idea is to make it in the morning, before work, and be done when you get home from work.   By the time you do all these steps you might as well have made it in a pan. Sorry, way too many separate steps for me. Won't make again. .... at least not this way.

This was a great recipe! My wife and I substituted ground turkey for the chicken and cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken. We cut down the time on the crockpot because of the ground turkey. Absolutely delicious. Would never had thought to cook with the dry Italian dressing mix.

Simple and quick to get ready on a busy morning. big hit for my grandson. I did not have noodles so I made biscuits and pour the Chicken stroganoff. Had peas and made your Simple white cake recipe for dessert.  All in All was a big hit.

I rarely do reviews, but - boy! - this little gem of a recipe deserves a standing ovation! I made it as the recipe instructed; no changes. Considering the ease of preparing, low cost of the ingredients, and knock-your-socks-off end result, this is a 5-Star dish.

We added egg noodles.  It was a delight to eat!  It's the first meal I've ever cooked that wasn't microwaveable nor was it cooked by someone else!  (I'm 39 years old and just now learning how to cook!)  I will definitely make this again.  It was easy and it was yummy.

My intention was to make it just as the recipe stated, but after I mixed the soup & cream cheese... it was WAY TOO SALTY! So I added some milk at that point (prob 3/4 cup).. The milk helped, but still on the salty side. The flavor was really good though. Next time I will try to find lower sodium soup

With these ingredients one cannot go wrong.  However, much as I loved the taste, the method can be improved.  Cook chicken for 4 hours only and add liquid.  I will add canned mushrooms with the liquid in the future but this time  I added a dash of white wine and fresh mushrooms.  Great recipe!

Chicken was very dry, but the test was excellent.  I will make again, but I will either add broth or water with the chicken and seasoning.

Based on other reviews, I halved the cream cheese. I probably shouldn't have, as it wasn't quite "saucy" enough after I added a full bag of cooked wide egg noodles. After adding the noodles, I stretched the sauce by adding a splash each of chicken stock and milk, and approx. 1/3 cup of sour cream. Delicious! Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. I also sauteed some sliced mushrooms and sprinkled them on top of the stroganoff/pasta after plating (not everyone in my family likes mushrooms, or I would have added them to the sauce). This recipe is a keeper!

If I make this again I will only add 1/2  of the Italian dressing pkg.  I found it to be on the salty side.  Perhaps I will cook this for less time, as mine was over cooked.

I've made this twice so far. The first time, I added onions and mushrooms. I had also added a 1/2 cup of chicken broth at the beginning because I used frozen chicken. The sauce came out a little soupier than I wanted.

The second time I did this, I used thawed, cubed chicken, followed the recipe exactly as written, and it came out perfect.  I did add chopped onions with the chicken, and I melted the butter before adding it with the Italian dressing mix. With that, I used the whole packet. I added frozen mixed veggies in with the cream cheese and canned soup. If you're really in a hurry, you can add partially cooked noodles during the last 30 minutes of cooking as well.

I liked the recipe as is, and unlike others, the dish didn't taste salty to me. But I learned that everyone has their own level of saltiness that they can tolerate. My family also enjoyed this recipe as well. It's been printed out and added to my homemade cookbook.

This is my favorite recipe I've found on here! It was so easy but yet so delicious! It's only 5 ingredients and the only prep is cutting the chicken. My rice cooker/slow cooker only has a "high" setting, so the chicken/margarine/seasoning mixture was done in 3 hours and 45mins. I pulled the chicken apart just a little with a spatula before adding the cream cheese and soup then kept it on high for 30 minutes stirring occasionally. Served over egg noodles. It was so delicious and filling. My boyfriend and mom loved it as well. The best part is it is just as great as leftovers. I'm very pleased! Thank you for this great recipe.

This was really tasty - but I made changes so the rating is based on what I did.  I used the Italian Dressing Mix (found on this site) - about 1/3 of the dry ingredients that recipe calls for - to season 4 chicken breast halves.  Turns out that was a lot of chicken so after it cooked I removed about half of it to use another time.  I added low fat cream cheese and lower sodium cream of mushroom soup and a little milk.   I also sauteed some crimini mushrooms and added those.  We really liked it over rice.

This is good, but it's such a different taste from other stroganoffs and casseroles I've made that I don't know if I'll make it again. The sauce was too thick to spread so I added some milk.

I've never eaten stroganoff before and after this, I probably won't again.  Sorry.....too thick.  Tried on noodles and then on rice.  Better on noodles.  Three stars because I had nothing to mentally compare to and didn't think it was fair to give one star for that reason.   Thanks for sharing.

Made it as directed and wanted to eat it over noodles but the family beat me to the slow cooker and left me the gratitude! I'll be making it for co-workers tomorrow in Grand Junction, Co. I made it for co-workers in Wichita, Ks and all that was left was the scale in the pot!

This was super simple and very tasty. I did not have the dry dressing mix so poured in a bit of regular Italian dressing. I was a bit conservative with it I think, so missed some punch in the flavour but it still worked out well. Will make again.

Served this at a party and it was a big hit. You can use any cream soup you like ie mushroom, celery. I added the Dry Italian dressing a little at a time to make sure it wasn't salty as mentioned in a another review. I served it over egg noodles

Easy and delicious recipe just as is.  My husband mentioned he would like a bit more sauce so the second time I made it, I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup and some fresh mushrooms.  I'll continue to make it that way as the mushrooms add taste and volume to an already very nice dish (and also because my husband is a sauce guy)!   Served over egg noodles both times.  Some mentioned it being too salty but we did not think it was.

Made two batches, one for a friend, cooked on low longer and all liked the dish a lot. Very quick. Will make it again.

Really good, it is a little salty for my taste but will try to fix that the next time.

The wife says it's a keeper. I agree. Although I made a couple changes, I stayed with the recipe basics. I didn't have the dry dressing ingredient so I  put the chicken chunks in a Zip-Lock bag along with about 3 T of Italian dressing (out of the bottle) and marinated overnight. In the morning I melted the butter in the cooker, then added the chicken along with 1/2 C chopped onion. I also added a half cup of wild mushrooms simply because they were leftovers. I followed the cooking instructions as given along with the late soup addition. Served over noodles. Delish.

Finally a recipe my family loved! They are so picky. I used heavy cream instead of cream cheese because my husband and kids don't like cream cheese. Next time we make it we are going to add vegetables and double the sauce.  So yummy!

It was a little bit salty.  I made it as is. Did not change anything.  Next time I will use sodium free or fat free cream of chicken.

I made this exactly as per the recipe. It is super easy and we all loved it (including my 5yr old daughter). Is it weird that I'm already looking forward to tomorrow's leftovers? ??

I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, but it still wasn't creamy enough for us. We then added some milk, which made it perfect!

I will definitely make this again I have made it two times so far and each time I have had to do it on the stove instead because i wasn't home and it is amazing and simple. I also made my own cream sauce because I was out and I like it better that way

This is a super easy, satisfying dinned that I'll make again and again. I added a couple larges splashes of white wine to the pot at the beginning and otherwise followed as directed. We didn't think it was too salty at all (and my husband is sensitive to that), nor too thick. Tastes a lot like the chicken tetrazini my mom used to make when served over noodles, but a lot easier to make! In that vein, the second time I made it I added peas and mushrooms I had sauteed in white wine. Definitely a keeper!

Great easy recipe. I could not find dry Italian dressing mix locally so I mixed up my own. It turned out excellent. I tossed in a handful of chopped mushrooms 3 hours in and served over traditional egg noodles. Delicious!

I added about a cup of sliced mushrooms at the beginning, and cooked on high for 2 1/2 hrs. because I got a late start. After 2 1/2 hrs. I tossed in the cream cheese and soup- I also substituted cream of chicken/mushroom, put the lid back on turned it to warm. After 15 minutes (which I used to cook some wide egg noodles)everything stirred/blended together  beautifully with little effort. It was really  tasty, everyone enjoyed it. Someone said it was horribly salty? I'm wondering if they  served it with ricearoni or flavored noodles or something, because with the plain noodles(and I would assume plain rice), it was not overly salty. I will make it again.

I LOVE SALT...and this recipe has plenty of it. 
All kidding aside this is a very good recipe. But there is a lot of salt, no way around it. Not too much in my opinion, but it's there. I personally believe the salt comes from the dry salad dressing packet. I could be wrong but any time I use a recipe with any type of dressing packet, it tends to be salty. I would suggest a reduced sodium condensed chicken as well. I would also include a veggie side (I used broccoli) with wide egg noodles, all of which diluted the salt taste. Will definitely make again.

I make this on the stove. It takes about 20 mins. I also add chicken broth to thin it out.  I serve it over egg noodles

Wow!  This was fabulous.  I made it a bit easier and threw 5 chicken breasts that were frozen directly into the crockpot and did not cut them up until they were already cooked.  Took about 4 hours on high to cook through.  Delicious!!

Simple and delicious.  I resisted the urge to add the soup and sour cream in the beginning.  Great choice on my part.  I put the chicken, seasoning and butter in slow cooker, and  left it alone for 6 hours.  Husband was a huge fan, this will be a regular!

I really liked this.  Am always looking for recipes for my 91 year old mother who looks at most recipes and says "too many ingredients".  She even makes it. The next time I made it I wanted more sauce so I doubled the soup (used both cream of chicken and Cream of Chicken and mushroom).  I also sauteed some button mushrooms and added them.  If you double the soups, don't forget to double the italian dressing to keep the flavor up.

Love this stuff, I season it with oregano,  minced garlic, a pepper blend and salt I've also used the cream cheese w/ chives...I serve over mashed potatoes though, sticks the ribs a wee bit more. Plus who doesn't love mashed potatoes? Shouldn't trust people who don't like mashed potatoes. (I make amazing mashed potatoes...they could inspire world peice kind of mashed potatoes.) think I'll go ahead and upload that :) happy hunting!!

Made this exactly as directed, and it was great. Has a rich, creamy flavor that reminded me of Tuna Helper. Put the chicken and sauce over whole wheat egg noodles, as some of the other reviewers recommended. Yum! And the leftovers were great too. To lighten it up a bit next time, I will probably use reduced fat cream cheese and/or cut down the portion the cream cheese. One of the best slow cooker recipes I've had, to date, and so simple!

Followed recipe except doubling it to feed a large group and using low fat cream cheese and low fat soup. Everyone liked it.  For me it was a bit rich but we will have it again.

I forgot that it was a Crockpot dish; given the time, I used my InstantPot pressure cooker instead.  We were able to enjoy it without as long of a wait. Turned out very tasty, served over papardelle pasta.

Quick and easy dish that can be made in the crockpot or stovetop. I do find the dry italian season mix to be a bit much. I suggest crunching it up more with a rolling pin so the pieces aren't so big. I've used cream of mushroom, cream of chicken and cream of mushroom/chicken to made this. Always tastes good.

Good stuff.  Added mushrooms and wine, may add another packet of Italian dressing next time just for a bit more flavor. Great over egg noodles. Comfort food.

It was delicious. Instead of adding dry Italian seasoning, I used the onion package and I added my cream of chicken soup and 1/2 cup of water along with the chicken.  It was perfect.

Really good, but I second the salt factor is high. ( only reason for the 4 stars) I used cream of mushroom and added milk, I also added way less cream cheese( you can customize this a lot to your own tastes and needs)  I will probably add less of the packet next time and less butter. But still a good recipe and I will be making this again:) SO easy for a busy mom,and very tasty.  Thanks for sharing!

One of the best recipes EVER.  The only change I made was to only use half the package of dry salad dressing mix.  I thought it might be too strong - but I will probably use the entire pack next time.  Flavor was wonderful.  Definitely a 5*

The only ingredient that I didn't add was the Italian dressing because I didn't have any but it tasted terrific! I shredded the chicken instead of dicing it but that's just my preference. Will definitely be making again. I made mashed potatos for the husband and thick egg noodles for me. It was the perfect comfort food for a cold night

This recipe was pretty good.   I used chicken thighs but took the skin off.  I cooked it on low for 10 hours so it would be ready when I got home.  I then took out the bones and the meat fell right off.  I followed the rest of the directions but added some cooked mixed vegetables and Penne pasta to the mixture.  It was pretty good!   I feel it needed a little salt but didn't add it.  I would make this again.

Very easy and my family loved it. Only variation I made was that I served it over egg noodles. Next time I will add mushrooms just to see how that tastes. Be careful to use the correct packaging size on the ranch dressing. Some reviews report it to taste salty, and I think that's from too much dry ranch seasoning.

Could NOT be easier and an absolute hit with the family.  I made the WHOLE BAG of egg noodles to top with this; as I speak, they are finishing it ALL off for late-night snacks after dinner!

My additions were simple:  a shake of garlic powder (NOT garlic salt), dried onions, mushrooms, and what I had left of a container of sour cream (probably about a generous 1/3 cup). Oh, and I substituted cream of mushroom for cream of chicken soup.

I've never been one to have a "rotation" of recipes for the week, but this one will likely be the one that starts my list!  And I would not hesitate to serve it to company with a nice salad and dinner rolls.

My family found it bland and too salty. (I even used reduced sodium soup). I will not make it again.

I've been making this dish for over 5 years. I love it. I started using a recipe from here for the Italian dressing seasoning mix:) a little cheaper than the dang packets. Besides that, exactly as is is PERFECT. Love it over egg noodles. And bow tie pasta. Maybe some peas. Yup. Love it and all the variations you can come up with.

Easiest recipe I could imagine that tastes great as well.  DH thought it was a tad too creamy, but I thought it was just right as is.

I finally found a chicken recipe for the crock pot!  I made the recipe as-is and thought it was a little thick at the end so I added some milk to get the consistency we like.  But the chicken does not need liquid initially; it browns nicely and was really tender.  I did put the chicken chunks in partially frozen because I was worried about it being dry.  Cooked on low about 7 hrs. Easy, yummy meal for the working parent!

I have only made this once. I found it to be too salty for my taste (though I don't add much salt at all to my food). Next time I make it I will only use 1/2 a packet of dressing and a low-sodium soup if I can find it.

Very good. I served it over brown rice, instead of noodles due to personal preference, but we all loved it. My three year old, who is very picky, even loved it. Will definitely make again. I used Neufchatel instead of cream cheese, real butter instead of margarine, and low fat cream of chicken.

AMAZING!  I didn't have the egg  noodles so I had to use rice instead and it was perfect! (although how could you go wrong with so much cream cheese and butter!) Delicious! One of my all time favorite meals.

I made this dish many times already and I love it! Since this is just the basic set up for it for the most part which is great because that means you can add other things to it to. Such as some vegetables or other spices since many people would think this is blan and want it to taste spicy or hot or simply  have more nutrients added to it to make it healthier!

I made this, twice and the second time, I changed it a bit, by adding Adobo, Basil and Onion Powder, the spices, changed it slightly. Adding a more seasons, made it more flavorful. Plus, I cooked the chicken cubes, in a white wine sherry.

Loved it!  I'm in Australia, so I substituted 2 teaspoons dried Italian herbs for the package of dry Italian style dressing mix which we don't have here and added about 3/4 cup sliced mushrooms.  Next time I'll get spreadable Philadelphia cream cheese.  The original package was too hard to mix, although it melted in time.  I also cooked the chicken breasts whole so cooked the meal on low for around 8 hours.  Was delicious.  Hubby also loved it.

I made with chicken breast cut into chunks with butter and 1/2 seasoning mix and cooked as directed.  I removed chicken and poured juices into bowl and skimmed fat.  I put in half cream cheese and cream of chicken soup til melted. Sautéed  8 ounces of mushrooms with 2 cloves garlic and added to mixture.  It tasted too salty and so I added 1/2 cup half and half and heated all and served over noodles.  My husband enjoyed it.  Next time I'll try making with low sodium chicken soup and do without the 1/2 as was thin but very good.

This was a good, filling recipe. The cream cheese gives it a rich flavor. I did make one addition to the posted recipe. I added some mixed veggies,  then served it over a brown rice and quinoa mix.

This was actually very good... I am not a fan of Italian dressing so I was ready to not like this recipe.. The meal was terrific!, very clean chicken flavor ...super simple and easy to make.. followed recipe exactly. served over egg noodles.  I will make this again ... even when I am not looking to reduce cooking time for dinner.... Try this and do follow recipe....  You will enjoy!

I made it exactly per the recipe, but I didn't cube the meat before cooking.  After cooking, I shredded it with two forks and it was perfect.  I will definitely make this again.  SO easy.

Everyone loved this one from the two year old on up. I did chance the cream cheese to low fat and the chicken soup to cream of mushroom plus worstershire sauce.  Ok so maybe I threw in some steamed chopped zucchini that I had from

Easy and delightful. Read all the other comments but I made it pretty much as written with a dash of wine and some mushrooms. Wanted to have leftovers but was disappointed when some folks stopped in and finished it off. Will make it again and soon.

This is awesome, I did add a few drops of milk because it is very thick. I also added 1 small can of mushrooms to it. I made it with egg noodles but I think rice would be just fine and just as filling

We made this exact to the recipe with exception of using low fat cream cheese. Also used butter instead of margarine. The first time it came out thick but after that the next few times it was perfect and the taste is incredible. We serve it over noodles and it has such as creamy texture. I prefer chicken to beef so this was perfect for me. I now crave this so thank you for a great dish! Yum!!

This was very tasty! The only complaint is that it was a bit too much butter! Next time I'd use less. For the seasoning I used a dip mix packet of Gourmet Creations Tuscan Blend. Didn't add any more pepper or spice and it was super tasty! All 4 kids and 2 adults loved it. Good winter meal due to the heaviness. Delicious.

This was delicious and oh-so-easy.  I made some changes but can still reliably rate this recipe.  

My changes were to use butter instead of margarine, chicken thighs instead of breasts and I overcooked it by several hours since hubby had to work late (which I wouldn't recommend  lol! but it was still delicious!  Using chicken thighs meant I didn't end up with dried-out chicken, it was just completely shredded...no longer cubed.).  I added mushrooms about 1 hour before serving (about 30 minutes before adding the soup and cream cheese) mainly because I didn't have any chicken cubes anymore so the mushrooms gave it a "chunkiness" that I wanted.

When I added the cream cheese I stirred the whole mixture until the cream cheese completely melted, then I added the cream of chicken soup.  I served it over egg noodles.  Hubby said "it's a keeper".  

Great recipe, comfort food at its best.  I will definitely be making this again.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I also decided to make a few tweaks after reading several other reviews.
At the beginning:
1) I put the soup in with the chicken
2) I added a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup
3) Added a pack of mushrooms
Followed the rest of the instructions and it was great. New house favorite.

I rate this a 4 because it is a great base recipe for a slow cooker. LOTS of room for tweaking. Since it had so many reviews as is, I wanted to give my variation.
I used 8 bone-in chicken thighs instead of cut up chicken breast. Same amount of time on low. 
I pulled the chicken out and shredded it then put it back in the juices with the listed ingredients but also added sliced mushrooms and frozen peas. 
Cooked in slow cooker for another hour then added cooked egg noodles, mixed, added some shaved Parmesan cheese on top and baked in a 350 degree oven for 25 more minutes.

Definitely a keeper in my family. I did it a little differently though. Instead of using dry Italian dressing mix, I just cubed the chicken and threw it in a Ziploc baggie. Then I poured in a good Italian dressing (I happened to have Olive Garden Signature Italian Dressing that I had bought at Sam's Club (but you can buy in other stores too.) and mushed it around a bit and let it sit for about 15 minutes or so. Then I poured everything into the crock pot with the butter. Instead of just 1/8 cup margarine, I used 1/2 cup butter (I'm German so I'm a butter lover). Also, when I added in the cream cheese and soup, I added in a bunch of frozen broccoli just for a veggie serving and a little color.  It wasn't too salty or anything. It was definitely different and my picky 5-year-old ate it quickly without a fuss!

I have made this several times some in the crock and some in a pan either way is good. The only change i made was i doubled the sauce and added a tablespoon or two of sour cream. Delicious and something different!

Sauce was good but had to throw out the chicken as it was overcooked to mush. I had it on low for only 3 hours.

I didn't have high expectations of this simple recipe, but my hubs and I were pleasantly surprised how delicious it was. I followed the recipe pretty closely except that I added a chopped onion to the crock pot at the start of cooking (only because when I threw my frozen chicken breasts in the pot I wasn't sure what I was making yet, hehe)... and I used only half a brick of cream cheese because that's all I had -- but added a few big spoonfuls of sour cream to compensate.  I also added a healthy dash of milk to thin it out a bit and make more sauce to cover the fettuccine noodles I served it on.  Finished it off with a little chopped parsley and plenty of fresh-ground pepper which made it taste more stroganoff-like and balanced out the saltiness. So good we both had seconds.

My modifications:
*Real butter instead of margarine.
*Progresso  Cream of Mushroom Soup instead of cream of chicken.
*Added 1 package of fresh mushrooms during the last hour
*Served over spinach noodles.  

My family LOVED it!  Very easy to make.  Definitely added to our frequent meal rotation!

This was really good. Only thing I might change next time would be to add a little more Italian seasoning and shred the  chicken instead of dicing.

With only five ingredients this recipe is so flavorful! I didn't read the recipe all the way thru (bad habit of mine) so I added the soup with the chicken, butter and Italian seasoning. No ill effects, if anything it probably added to the flavor. Definitely will put this in our normal rotation

I'm a decent cook and can make more advanced dishes, but why not be willing to make an easy and delicious meal? I like a little more "liquid" in my stroganoff, so I add a cup of chicken broth to the crock pot while the chicken cooks. It's still creamy, but flows a little better over the pasta. This is my "go-to" recipe for when I can't think of anything else yummy to cook for my wife.

My family loves this dish. I usually add an extra can of soup and cream cheese because it tends to not be enough sauce. If u find that time is an issue you can cook it on high in about half the time. I also tried adding a jar of Alfredo sauce to it but was not as happy with the outcome. Another thing u can try which my family really enjoyed was adding bacon bits at the end for a bit of a carbonara flavor.  Love this dish and it has become a staple in my home. Thanks for the recipe

Used low sodium alternatives, included fresh mushrooms and this dish came out delicious.  A very simple and tasty dish indeed.  Served with fresh blanched asparagus.
Update...last night, I prepared salsa chicken and ten minutes before serving, my 89yr youngster asked if we could have "that stroganoff tonight".  She doesn't eat beef since it's difficult to chew but loves tender, juicy chicken.  This qualifies...
Thank goodness for leftovers!!!

I followed the recipe exactly except I used butter instead of margarine. It was very good, but I feel sorry for people who don't like salty food. I like salty, so it was good but it was ALMOST too salty for me. If I make this again, I will use low sodium soup and low sodium dressing mix (if they have it) and I will also add pepper.

I made this today, although I used Cream of Onion Soup rather than Cream of Chicken Soup (because that's what I had) and since I was using my two-quart crockpot which has only one setting -- low -- I cooked it an additional hour after adding the soup and cheese, I have to say this is the best "chicken and noodles" I have EVER had. I might add canned mushrooms next time along with the soup and cheese.

This recipe is absolutely delicious and quick and easy to make.  I prepared it exactly as written with the exception of adding some fresh sliced mushrooms.  It was just as good warmed up as leftovers.  I served it with egg noodles  initially and brown rice with leftovers.  Great with both.  I definitely will make this again.

This was very good. Seven-year old and I loved it. I actually made it in a skillet, not the crock pot. It seemed to be lacking something so I sautéed some onions and added those and wow, so good. Now looking back over the recipe, I realize I forgot to used condensed soup of any kind, so that probably explains it. I did use a little white wine and garlic and only had about 2 T cream cheese on hand so augmented it with sour cream. I will make it again.

So simple and full of flavor. the only change I make was using a pound of ground chicken instead of cubed. Also it turns out a little thick so don't be afraid to add milk to thin it to your liking. I served it over no yolk egg noddles and the whole family loves it. My 9 month old daughter enjoyed hers over rice because she isn't a noodle kind of girl just yet. Oh I almost forgot I cooked this on the stove not a slow cooker so I suppose that's why mine was so thick. All the juice cooked out but still amazing!

This was waaaaay too salty. I made as directed and probably should have used less dressing mix. It also did not make as much stroganoff as I expected. It was only enough to go with half a package of egg noodles. Won't be making this again.

I have a large family of picky eaters. Not only does everyone LOVE this, it even brings my kids in college home for dinner! They don't have to know how easy it is. The only I do differently is add mushrooms.

I did the first step exactly how it was stated. I slow-cooked the chicken for 4 hours in the italian dressing mix. I liked that the chicken was pulling apart after 4 hours and was lightly browned. I then added a bullion cube because it was lacking salt. I then proceeded to add the cream of chicken soup, some mushrooms and the cream cheese. After adding the soup and the cream cheese, the dish became very bland. It took away all of the flavor. I had to modify this dish by adding garlic powder and more seasonings. Overall, ok dish but needs more spices.

I followed this recipe the way it is written except that I used butter instead of margarine. I also didn't have a Italian dressing packet so I used 1/2 pack of onion soup mix. This dish was fabulous!! They whole family liked it, even my picky 3 year old! Will definitely make this again and again!

I cannot rave about this enough. It is one of the easiest and most delicious recipes I've ever made! I used butter instead of margarine, as I never buy it. I also took a suggestion from another reviewer and added mushrooms and used cream of mushroom soup. I also added about a 1/4 of a cup of white wine in the beginning. Other than that, I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. OMG, it tastes so amazing.  I will definitely be making this regularly from now on.

Well....I just wasn't overwhelmed with this recipe - I served it to a family gathering and everyone seemed to enjoy quite well, but I thought it was rather rich and didn't like the texture of the chicken.  Perhaps it was something else - I will probably try it again and work with it - it's definitely worth a 2nd chance !
The reviews were so good I thought I would LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it !

Many reviewers changed the steps and ingredients so I really hesitated following the original recipe. I made myself crazy reading everyone's comments then came to my senses and made the recipe EXACTLY as written. The verdict is in.....DELICIOUS!  Huge hit in my house. My only suggestion for next time (and there will be a next time). Is to soften the cream cheese in the microwave before adding it to the crockpot. Because I took it right from the refrig it took longer than 30 minutes to completely melt.  Definitely make this and follow as is. There is no need to alter anything.

This was very good and easy to make.  I used fat free cream cheese, reduced fat soup, added 1/2 cup water, and a little skim milk as needed, shredded the chicken, then served it over egg noodles with a side salad.  This seems to be more of a chicken tetrazzini rather than a stroganoff, but maybe that's just me.  Either way, it's an easy and tasty dinner after a long busy day.

I made this exactly as it was called for. It tastes great. I had a few mushrooms left so I added them to my next helping. I don't think the mushrooms added anything extra to the taste. It didn't take away from it either. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

BY FAR one of the best.  I made the mistake of adding the cream cheese in with everything else and it was absolutely delish.  We served over rice.  I added about 1 1/2 cups of sliced mushrooms to make it more authentic as well.  A keeper

I made this as written, only I used one more chicken breast than stated in the recipe.  I even added the soup and cream cheese in the final hour of cooking.  My family enjoyed this recipe served over egg noodles.  I will make this again and may play with it by adding diced onions,sliced mushrooms, and cream of mushroom soup. Quick, easy, yummy and recommended!

Yes, I substituted 20 oz. Perdue Short Cuts, Hidden Valley Ranch dry salad dressing, 2/3 cup wine and 2 cans Cream Chicken soup. My so said it was the best meal he ever had. (I really think it was a homemade meal during DC's #snowmaggedon2016.)

I made this today. I added fresh mushrooms, ( I love mushrooms) .  Served it over whole wheat noodles. Um um good! This stroganoff is so delicious and easy to make! It will definitely be a " must have!"  (By the way I sprayed my crockpot with butter flavored non-stick spray to prevent sticking and it worked perfectly!)

next time use 1/2 the soup. 1/2 the cream cheese. Add some milk to thin it out. Also add celery, mushroom, etc. onion. Whatever is in fridge to give it some flavor other than pure chicken.  Super easy and great over egg noodles.

The taste was very good but the consistency was really weird. I used thawed chicken breasts and followed the recipe. When I mixed in the cream cheese and soup, the chicken came apart to the point where it looked almost pureed. I will either use frozen chicken next time or a different recipe.

This was delicious and will definitely be making it again! It was quick and easy! I followed the recipe except I didn't have powdered Italian dressing so I just used some of the bottled kind and it turned out great!  Would recommend it.

Very simple to make. Added Old Bay to give it some favor, since it did come out somewhat bland. Great recipe if you're busy. Set it and forget it.

Very good.  Made this with Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix this time and also added a large can of mushrooms with the juice.  It was very good and easy to make.

Amazing!! I add a little black pepper and some garlic powder or minced garlic. I also add a little extra dry Italian dressing mix. If you are in a time crunch it works to cook on high for 2-3 hours. Wow!!

This dish is amazing! I have twins and one is very picky. He told me "Mama you have to make this everyday. It is the best dinner you have ever made!" Coming from him that meant it was really good! I plan to make this easy slow cooker recipe many, many more times. 

The only changes I made was I added a cup of water and a chopped onion with the chicken, dressing and butter mixer.

LOVED IT!!! And all 3 of my kids loved it, too, which is a pretty big feat. I did make changes as suggested by other reviewers: I added 1can reduced sodium cream of CELERY soup, 1/4 cup white wine, 1/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup butter, and 3 frozen chicken breasts. I also misread the recipe and added 1/2 packet RANCH dressing instead of Italian. It still turned out great! After 5 hours the chicken just fell apart. I shredded it, then added the Neufchâtel cheese and some Sriracha (my family likes a little spice). I added some sautéed Baby Bella mushrooms and it was perfect! I will definitely make this one again. Thank you!!

I added a touch more margarine.  Added an onion, about 8oz of mushrooms, 6oz of peas, and 6oz of cut carrots.  I doubled the cream cheese and soup for the extra volume.  Added 8oz of sour cream too.  The soup was low sodium and the cream cheese and sour cream were low fat.
Cooked step one on low for 5 hours.
Added onion, carrots.
Cooked for another hour.
Added mushrooms and frozen peas.
Cooked for another hour.
Added everything else.
One more hour.

Tastes amazing.  Served over egg noodles.  Will totally cook this up again.

This was so cheap and easy to make.  I typically despise cooking, but wanted to try to learn some new things. I thought this looked so good when I saw it and was impressed with how few steps and ingredients it required. I will definitely be making this again.

This has been my "go to" meal on many occasions since we have such a busy household! Work, coaching, children in activities, and sports,  there's just not enough time in the day. Especially now that school has resumed I know I will be looking to this recipe and all its varieties in the coming days! Excellent recipe and very very delicious!!

Easy and excellent. I appreciate the simplicity during the busy holiday season. The whole fam ate it and enjoyed it. I'm sure the calorie count broke the bank but was it ever good. I made no changes.

This was so easy and delicious. I added some sliced baby Bella mushrooms at the beginning, and just threw the chicken breasts in whole and frozen. At the end of six hours, I shredded the chicken (which just fell apart), added the soup and cream cheese, and by the time the egg noodles were done, so was the rest. This is a keeper!

Very easy to make.  Make sure the cream cheese is completely mixed in with sauce.   The chicken and sauce was so delicious over the egg noodles.  A bit salty, but really good!

I'm a novice cook, so I'm always looking for relatively simple but delicious recipes. This dish definitely delivered. Because of ingredients I had on hand, I used frozen boneless chicken breasts and then added the soup and dressing mix. (I used garlic and onion dressing flavor, not Italian, which then resulted in a rich, creamy flavor.)  One hour before serving, I added 3/4 of the package of cream cheese and a little bit of sour cream. I then served the dish to my son and husband over egg noodles. It was delicious! My son said it was the best thing I've ever cooked! Thank you so much -- you made me look like an actual cook!

Using frozen chicken did not work.  Take the extra 15 mins to cook the chicken and add the rest of the ingredients and you'll have a dish that's juicy and flavorful in less that 35. May want to add onion, mushroom, salt, pepper.

This recipe turned our well.  Per the comments, I added 1/4 cup white wine, and a little bit of leftover chicken broth to the chicken before beginning the 6 hour slow cook.  I think I might add 1/2 a cup of wine and 1/2 cup of broth next time to increase the viscosity.  When fully complete, my sauce was very thick, so I would have preferred it a tiny bit thinner.

I make it with chicken thighs and omit the Italian dressing mix, substituting it with a product called Slap Yo Mama and Gobs of Garlic.  At the end, after adding the soup/cream cheese mixture, I add sautéed mushrooms.  I absolutely love this recipe and have made it several times. (It is in the slow cooker as I write this!!)

This was VERY good and easy.  A big hit with my children and my sister's grandchildren which are picky eaters but asked for second helpings.  I added a container of fresh mushrooms cut up and a large chopped onion.  Also used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.  Followed the original recipe, delicious too .  I have made this 3 times in the last month.

Delicious, my kids and their two friends loved it.  i didn't have seven hours left before supper so I put the chicken, seasoning and margarine on high for 3 hrs and then did the cream cheese and soup as directed.  I also added mushrooms at that time.

I made it as is to start, but thought it didn't have much to tie the cream cheese and the soup flavors together.  It was also much too thick to put over noodles.  So I added some milk until it was more creamy/saucy and some Worcestershire to taste and added some fresh cracked pepper.  The Worcestershire really tied the flavors and made it taste pretty good.  My 6 year old really liked it as well.  Hubby didn't say much, so to me that means it was probably edible to him but he'll probably request I don't make it again.  But then, he isn't a big "white sauce" person.

I used the basics of the recipe and made it on the stovetop. It was still a quick prep time.  And, the results were good. Will make again!

This was a great chilly Sunday night meal. Next time, I might add a little extra cream cheese to make the sauce a bit thicker and some whole button mushrooms.  But, it was very tasty and something that will be a go-to dinner for me.

I simply added to this great recipe by leaving the crock pot on high for four hours then added 16 oz. of fresh mushrooms and let it cook for another two hours.  I added 1/2 cup white wine with the cream of chicken and cream cheese. Let cook another hour and whaa laa.  Wonderful.

Just made this last night. I am so glad I doubled the recipe, because my kids LOVED it. This was super easy. Chicken cooked while I was at work all day. Added the cream cheese and soup when I got home. Twenty minutes later we were eating a delicious dinner.

I made is with reduced fat creamy cheese and reduced fat soup and it is still amazing! We will definitely be having this again!

I don't measure when I cook but I made this using Mrs Dash seasoning instead of the Italian dressing mix, and I basically doubled everything except the cream cheese. And I was way impressed, which rarely happens. I'm an ok cook, but this dish came out as a mega-hit among all, including picky eaters and teenagers!

This is heavenly! I've made this at least a half a dozen times already. Don't change a thing. It is creamy and fattening, I'm sure you can add light cream cheese and soup to reduce calories and it'll still be fabulous!

I haven't read all the reviews, but this dish is fabulous, and I found it serves two purposes:  Make it per the recipe, enjoy it for dinner; then the next day, while the leftovers are nice and chilly from the fridge, spread it on crackers and enjoy it as a lunch or a football Sunday snack.  Because of the cream cheese, it makes a fantastic spread!

What a yummy recipe, thank you, Judi Ann!!  I wasn't sure if it would all come together but it really did!  It was so creamy and yummy.  The only modification I made to the recipe was including butter instead of margarine. I would definitely add this to our routine, not weekly because it's made of cream soup and cream cheese, but definitely monthly and for guests!  The only thing that was strange about it was that the cream cheese never completely melted in despite the fact that I cooked it for about 7 - 8 hours on high. I did put it in cold right from the refrigerator in big chunks but I thought that with enough time in the slow cooker on high (about 1 1/2 hours) it would melt completely from the heat.  Regardless of the little visible pieces of cream cheese, it was delicious : )

I'm actually surprised by how delicious this is because I'm not exactly a 'good cook'... I doubled the recipe & used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken. Although, I still used 1/2 the amount of cream cheese I should have. Instead of cooking the chicken as cubes, I cooked them as they were half cutlets and then shredded them just before adding the soup & cream cheese. I also added frozen broccoli in at the beginning so it mushed into the sauce, which I prefer. My boyfriend & sister are the 2 pickiest eaters I know and they loved it! I'm sure this would be a hit for kids too.

This recipe didn't make sense to me when I read it.  Where was the liquid?  Just chicken and 1/2 cup wine in the crockpot - for SIX hours?  Sure enough, it started to burn at 5 1/2 hours.  I added the cream cheese and soup mixture, but it was still too thick.  The directions don't say if you're supposed to add the can of water to the soup mixture...so I'm thinking there should be at least half a can.  That didn't occur to me at the time, and since I know real Stroganoff uses sour cream, I added about half a cup of sour cream.  Also, I added a pound of sliced mushrooms.  Also, I don't get slow cooking something for six hours.  For me, the whole point of using a crockpot is I can put the meal on before work, and it's ready after work (so 8 - 10 hours).  I'm not working right now, but if I was - I couldn't have tried this recipe on a work day.  Also, slow cooking chicken cubes for that long did not make it succulent and tender.  To me, it made it taste like canned chicken.  This is easier than a real Stroganoff and I learned about dry Italian seasoning mix, so with the modifications I made, we all liked it and I'll be making my version again.

It was a little salty because of the italian dressing, however, I used a low sodium chicken soup and then added two large tablespoons of sour cream.  Cut the salt and my husband and family loved it!

Made this using Healthy Request cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soups. I added the whole chicken breasts (half-frozen), dressing, and soups to the crock-pot, and cooked on HIGH for 3 hours. I then shredded the chicken, added 4oz. each low-fat cream cheese and sour cream, and let it cook for another 30 minutes. Served it over egg noodles, with steamed broccoli. My family loved it.

I might need to give this recipe another chance since I didn't get a chance to read the reviews and follow others' adjustment suggestions. I followed the recipe as is and got a very salty dish that gave me a headache. The cream cheese is nice but it had to be more mild since the dry Italian dressing mix gave the dish already a lot of flavor.  Better luck next time for me.

I made this yesterday and it was a nice and easy recipe. It was a bit too salty for my taste, but that is most likely due to  the Italian salad dressing I used containing too much salt. Will use less of that in the future. After mixing in the cream cheese and condensed soup and heating it for 30 minutes, it was still a bit too lumpy. I think I will add some liquid next time I make this one.

We loved this dish! I made it exactly as written 2 days in a row...once for a friend who was just home from the hospital and again for my son & his family.  Both wanted the recipe and I will definitely add this to my repeat recipe file!

I'm a little disappointed in this recipe.  It's not bad, however, turned out sweeter than I thought it would be.   Maybe I need to try a different dressing mix or less dressing mix.   I'll definitely give it another shot but will alter the ingredients.

9/21/15:  I LOVED loved loved this!  Of course I tweaked a bit....Used tenders instead of breasts, the dry dressing I had was a spicy shrimp mix in a package (McCormick maybe), and I put a splash of white wine in with the chicken....used 4 oz cream cheese and  a scoop of sour cream towards the end along with a can of peas.

This was really good! However, based on other reviews, I got nervous about the chicken possibly burning and the dish being too salty and having an overwhelming cream cheese flavor--so I made some modifications. I added 1/4 c. chicken broth in with the butter, dressing mix, and chicken to ensure there would be no burning and that the chicken would be moist. I only used half of the dressing mix package, and I also seasoned the chicken a tad before putting it in the slow cooker.  For the sauce, I used a can of cream of chicken and mushroom (healthy choice), 1/2 of the cream cheese called for in the recipe (so, 4 oz.), and 1/4 c. milk. As far as cooking time goes, I only had to cook it on low for a little less than 4 hours before the chicken was cooked through. This will likely vary depending on the size of the fillets and the slow cooker itself (so keep your eye on it the 1st time). It took less than half an hour for the sauce to heat through with the chicken. Very good!!

Amazingly easy! I use my crockpot religiously on Sundays during football season, and this one was one of the best! A few modifications: I used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts (less work for me!), 1 can cream of chix AND 1 can of cream of mushroom and I still added some milk to make it less thick. Also threw in some whole black peppercorns at the end for some extra flavor. Overall, loved it! Will definitely be making this again for me and my husband on gameday!

Loved its simplicity, but found it lacking in flavor.  Added some sauteed red pepper and onion, some ground black pepper, more Italian seasonings, a tsp Himalayan salt and some fresh garlic ... now it tastes better to our family palate anyway!  Thanks for the basic idea!

I will make this again, so easy to put in the crock pot and finish when I got home. The whole family enjoyed. I did add  1 tsp. Italian seasoning and parsley. Everything was just as written.

It was a little too thick, but otherwise very good.  Next time I will add a little water to the soup. Very easy to prepare.

I kept checking the recipe to make sure there was nothing else but chicken, dressing and butter in the pot for those first hours! But it made the most delicious dinner I've had in a while. I was almost afraid to put the leftovers away - afraid I'd eat them all! We really enjoyed this. (Oh, I did use chicken thighs instead of breasts.)

I tried this last night.  I figured it would be different than the same beef one I usually  make.  Not sure if its was the cream cheese that over took the flavor but I will not be  making this one again.  I did have high hopes as it sounded so good.

This was amazing! We added diced onions and chopped baby portabella mushrooms to cook with the chicken. Before adding the soups, we drained most of the broth/juice from the crockpot and will use for making a brothy soup in the near future. When it came time to add the soup, we also added a can of cream of mushroom soup and some black pepper. Served on top of noodles. It was definitely a hit and we'll be making it again the same way.

Was an easy recipe to do in the slow cooker!  It turned out a bit "salty" for my taste.  I will tweak it a little and try again.   The flavor was great, though; just salty.  I did use ff cream cheese.

Would have rated it 5 stars except for the fact that it was so salty. Very tasty. I don't change a recipe the first time I make it but the breasts were so thick that I only used 3. The only Italian dressing at my store was zesty in the .6 oz size. I used butter as I don't have margarine. I used a slow cooker that is shallow and rectangular. I cooked on low 4 hours. I could have cooked 3 hours and it would have been fine. Chicken was falling apart. Sauce was very thick. Next time I will add some wine. Super simple to make.

Fantastic, but I made a number of changes up front to fit our preferences.  Also, used a crock pot after research.  Sliced the chicken rather than cubed.  Two cans soup vs. one; this was partly to ensure that the crock pot was filled high enough not to burn since it was a large crock pot.  Half the dry Italian dressing.  A full stick of real butter rather than margarine.  Everyone loved it.  Yes, rich and not as healthy as we might prefer, but delicious!

I always try to follow the recipe to the letter the first time before I rate it.  This time I had to make a couple of changes due to what I had available.  I used Cream of Mushroom soup instead of Cream of Chicken.  Because I was at work and was concerned about cooking the chicken with just the butter and seasoning for 8+ hours while I was out,  I did add the soup before cooking.  I used half a packet of seasoning (I noticed other reviewers did the same - we are watching our sodium intake)  Served over noodles and It turned out fantastic!  The family loved it and went back for more.  So simple but so flavorful.  Would definitely make again and I want to try it without the soup at the start when I'm able to keep a closer eye on it.

Wouldn't change a thing!!!! So good and I used frozen breast - this was one of the tastiest dishes ever.  I did add paprika to the Italian dressing mix for color.  So good that hubby said we'll need to add this to the rotation.  Yum

Super easy and yummy! Every person in my family of four liked it, even the one year old. The only thing I did different was sautéed spinach to mix in and used macaroni instead of egg noodles because that's what I had.

This was seriously simple and seriously yummy!  We spend several hours in church on Sunday so I like a meal that makes itself so it's ready when we come home and everyone is starving.  I used what I had on hand so substituted sour cream for the cream cheese.  I served it over jasmine rice I put in the rice cooker on a delayed start so everything could be ready when we got home from church vs. noodles that would have had to be cooked.  If you're trying to do more primal/paleo eating, you could serve over a potato instead of rice or noodles.  My teens are a little picky and they loved it as did Mom and Dad.  Will definitely keep on my rotating list of favorites.

Due to everyone saying it is too salty and being salt restricted, found recipe for Italian dressing mix here and omitted all the salts and used garlic powder and celery seed instead.  Used sour cream instead of cream cheese.  Added one package of frozen vegetables with a half hour to go.  Served w/ noodles.  Very tasty

This was great. The entire family loved it. I put 3 frozen chicken breasts , the soup, and a package of ranch dressing ( didn't have Italian, it was just as good)in the crock pot on low for 6 hours. I then added 8 oz of whipped cream cheese and 1 cup of sour cream. Cooked on high for another 30 minutes. Poured over egg noodles. It was so creamy the chicken just fell apart.

I have made this dish several times, but tonight, I did a little twist. I didn't have any instant Italian dressing but just a little liquid so I put that in then I had an idea. I used some dry  onion soup and it really notched it up!

Looks & sounds delicious & easy.  I'll brown the chicken (on the stovetop) in an uncovered Dutch oven, since browning will give it more flavor.  At that point, I might as well just continue on with the recipe and cook it (all) on the stove in the Dutch oven.  I think I'll add in some sliced mushrooms, and top off everyone's dish with roughly chopped fresh parsley.  (I wish that the Nutritional Info per portion was posted along with the recipes on this  site., since some folks have health issues which they need to consider.)

It was really good, I just recommend cooking the chicken for about 1-1.5 hours less. It was a little dry, and I wish she would have given the kind of pasta she used. I used extra wide egg noodles. Anyways, yummy recipe! :D

I just made this for supper tonight & the whole family loved it - even my very picky 6-yr-old son! It was very easy to throw together. We put it over white rice and had it with garlic toast and fresh cut up veggies. Delicious! This one is a keeper!

This recipe is great! It's super easy and delicious. I read some reviews that said it was salty so I used unsalted butter and low sodium cream of chicken soup and it came out perfect!

This meal was introduced to my husband and me after the birth of our first son, over 5 years ago. It was delicious then and has been in our rotation every since. So simple and comforting. I follow the recipe and add frozen peas to the crock pot for the last 30 minutes. The green peas added bright color to an otherwise plain dish (we serve the stroganoff over a bed of egg noodles).

Followed the recipe, subbing butter for margarine and cutting back to 4oz cream cheese + adding 4oz sour cream. The dry Italian dressing mix was lacking in depth of flavor and the cream of chicken soup left the dish taste bland and processed. The smell coming from the crockpot reminded me of a tuna casserole... which is really disturbing. Will not be making this again.

My husband and I absolutely love this recipe!! I sauteed some portebella mushrooms and then added them with the cream cheese and soup. Serve it over egg noodles and it really makes a wonderful meal.

it was good and everyone liked it. Cold and thickened the following day, it made great sandwiches.  The fault I found was that it was salty.  next time I'll also add some veggies and see if that helps.  Maybe simmer with a potato?

This is excellent, my family calls it Chicken Pudding (because it's about the thickness of pudding) and it's a favorite whenever we have guests over. Also very easy to make.

As another put it, this is a great easy "busy day" crockpot recipe which is what I was looking for, but  I don't know how anyone cooked the cubed chicken in the butter and Italian dressing mix for 7 to 8 hours (on low.)  I only used three pretty healthy sized chicken breasts but my chicken was done in two hours and beginning to dry out a bit at the edges (and I did not cube as much as cut it in larger chunks.) Otherwise made as directed but I could not cook this when working as the cook time for me was too fast.

Fabulous!  I'm a vegetarian so I substituted real chicken breast for 'fake chick strips.'  As other users did...I added cooking wine...and milk to the sauce to thicken it up.  Served over No Yolk egg noodles.  Yummy!

I really wanted to love this recipe but I didnt. I followed the exact directions but either the can of soup or the large amount of cream cheese made it way too thick. Just ok to me. Maybe next time I'll only add half of the cream cheese and soup. Maybe adding sour cream instead would be better?!

This was pretty good. The only thing I did different was add mushrooms to it. It's very rich. A little bit is filling. I would make this again and maybe try baby peas instead of mushrooms. Good job Judi Ann

This recipe was super yummy, easy, and family friendly!  The only thing I did different was used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken because that was all I had, and used reduced fat cream cheese.  I boiled up about a half a package of egg noodles and mixed them in at the end, and served with steamed broccoli on the side.  A real winner!!

This is very versatile. I used a half bottle of prepared dressing instead of dry mix. I used a family size can of soup, and I used a quarter cup of cream cheese. I also added a cube of vegetable bullion. It came out thick and rich. We also tried this with steak, and it was wonderful.

My husband and I loved it, especially me because it's so quick and easy to prepare. I added extra mushrooms and used wild mushroom soup, with a little bit of Wostershire sauce mixed in. Simply delicious. Thank you for this recipe.

I did everything according to the recipe except I doubled it and added mushrooms. I thought it was very salty so next time I'll add low sodium canned soup and maybe just one package on ranch dressing. I bet it would be 5 stars then.

Made this today for the first time exactly as is with the exception of low fat soup and cream cheese. This tasted wonderful. Such a rich creamy texture and the flavor was fabulous. Will definitely be a keeper. My wife is not a big fan of new dishes during the week but she also loved this. I spent a little extra money for a quality egg noodle and it does make a difference I believe. Thanks for the post!

Super easy and simple recipe, tastes really good considering how simple the prep and procedure were...I followed a number of reviewer's mods. Used 1/2 a cup of white wine, 3 tbsp of butter, with only 1 chicken breast cubed. Didn't have Italian dressing dry packet, so I sub with a packet of dry Tuscan chicken seasoning (club house brand). Plus a cup of sliced onion. All in and on low for 5 hours. Then one full can condense cream of chicken soup with 2/3 cup of Greek yogurt (again, I didn't have any sour cream or cream cheese on hand). Still super yum with brown rice pasta. 
It's a great base recipe that can be modify to suit a variety of diet requirement. The only thing that is pretty much indispensable is the condense soup, don't think there can be a sub for that....next time, I think i will try with coconut oil instead of butter. My preference for Greek yogurt is because of the added protein, I am sure that cream cheese would make it taste a lot richer.   
Definitely a keeper for my slow cooker recipe.

This was great and so easy! It is great as is but I leave out the butter and usually add a veg like broccoli. It also works great with rice instead of the noodles. Thank you!

This recipe was delicious! I followed it exactly.  It just needed a little more seasoning to it, so the next time I'm going to have to add a little something extra.  I did add milk at the end b/c the sauce was a little too thick.  Great recipe overall and we'll definitely try it again.  It was super easy and I like easy!!

Recipe definitely needs some work.  The 8 oz.cream cheese makes it too thick.  I added chicken broth, worchestershire sauce, white wine, still blah.  If I fix it again, I'll use 4 oz. cream cheese and 4 oz. sour cream, and maybe add a little sherry.Also, good thing I added some chicken broth when adding the chicken and salad dressing.  Fixed it on my lunch hour, and when I came home 5 hrs. later it was almost dry.  So, if you'll be away from home, add some liquid.

It was tasty but I did need to add a bit of black pepper and a little bit of garlic powder. We served over 100% whole wheat egg noodles. I put it in the slow cooker when I got home early from work but would be home late due to meetings and appointments. It was nice to come home to delicious food.

I was skeptical to switch it up from the usual beef- so was my husband. However the chicken blew me away! This recipe is delicious! I added a few extra table spoons of sour cream to make it a little more creamy. This is a Must try!

This is a perfect easy mid week meal.  The whole family loved it, even my son who SWEARS he doesn't like cream cheese.  (what one doesn't know...)  The first time I made this I followed other reviewers advice adn didn't use all of the italian seasoning mix packet...  but it definitely is better with the seasoning!  The second time I made it I even added half a packet of onion dip mix also.  It was very good both times!

Amazing recipe! It's quick to put together and tastes so great that my picky eater, who hates chicken by the way, asked for me to make it again :) the only change I made was that I used reduced fat soup only because it's what I had in my pantry. In the future, I will, however, add some water to thin out the sauce. If you're sodium sensitive I would suggest using low sodium ingredients because I found it to be a tad too salty but the rest of my family thought it was perfect.

I was very disappointed with the flavor of this. Made exactly as recipe called but it was very greasy. Ate it for one day and then even hubby did not touch it afterwards ( and he eats everything). We will not make it again. Sorry stroganoff, you were not for us.

This recipe is now on the top of our crockpot favorites!  The only change I made(accidentally)  was used chive and onion cream cheese.  Turned out to be a  tasty combination.   The sauce is fantastic!  Whole family loves it over rice!!

This was very easy to make and tasty and cheap. I made some minor alterations. I used butter instead of margarine and also added in a splash of chicken broth. The chicken by itself was starting to burn. I also stirred the chicken regularly. I cooked the chicken on low for about three hours. For the last half hour I put it on high and added in the soup. Then added the cream cheese at the end and let the cream cheese warm up in the Crockpot for a few minutes before I added the noodles. I would probably add some paprika next time for a little more flavor.

Turned out wonderful! Very tasty and the chicken was nice and tender along with flavorful. Made it for dinner with another couple and they asked me to email them the recipe! I will definitely be making this again. I like how quick and simple it is to throw together along with how few ingredients it takes while still being filling. I made it with veggie pasta (pasta made out of vegetables) to make it even lower carb as well as used  Neufchâtel cheese and low fat soup for a little healthier option. It tasted so good you couldn't even tell it was light ingredients!

I love this recipe.  I made a few changes - added some button mushrooms, used dried tarragon and some chicken broth.  The cream cheese is wonderful in this recipe

Overall good but next time I will use less cream cheese.  It was too heavy on the cheese for me. I also didn't use the entire packet of Italian seasoning. To make it quickly, I just made it on the stove.

Delicious, but really salty! I like to first try recipes as-written, but next time I'll use half the spice packet and/or low sodium soup, and add mushrooms, kale and maybe broccoli. Thanks for the super easy and fast recipe!

Just made this tonight. It is amazing! I too did things slightly different though. I added soup from the get go, cooked on hi for 5 hours and added about 1/8 to 1/4 (eyeballed it) of milk when I added cream cheese for that last 1/2 hour. We put it over egg noodles, delish!

The chicken was absolutely delicious! They sauce on the other hand was good, but could have been better! A little too thick, but next time I will be adding chicken broth and a little less of the cream of chicken!

So good. I used 1/3 fat cream cheese and  only 1/2 of it. Mixed the dressing and the soup mix together and cooked the chicken on low all day. It's very good.

This a great base recipe that is super easy! I did make a few changes. I cooked the chicken with Italian dressing, as the recipe calls for. There was enough juice that cooked out of the chicken. It does not need any other liquid added at this stage. I also added half a chopped onion at this point. I started with about 1 1/3 lb. chicken. Once I chopped it up, was a lot of meat and was worried that one can of soup was not enough. I started with a can of cream of mushroom and 1/2 the cream cheese. I planned to add sour cream as others suggested. It tasted great but not enough sauce. I then added a can of cream of chicken as the recipe calls for. This totally changed the taste. Was much better before this. I also found it a tad bit bland and needed extra seasoning. I will make this again. Will add 2 cans of cream of mushroom and omit cream of chicken. Will also add a second pack of Italian dressing to compensate for the extra sauce, and add more flavor. I don't believe sticking with all the cream cheese or adding sour cream really makes much of a difference. Overall, we really enjoyed this!

This was so easy and truly a winner.  It was about 10 hours before we got home to finish this and it was still great.  We only had macaroni noodles on hand but it worked really well to just mix them in.  And... it had really good flavor (judged by the fact that my husband didn't add anything to it; no salt and pepper, red pepper flakes or hot sauce - his usual standards).

This is a great recipe!! I did not find it to be too salty. I did, however, find it to be a little too thick, so the second time I made this I added about 1/4 cup of white wine and a little half and half to the mix. For my second attempt, I also added a small can of mushrooms and the chive and onion cream cheese instead of the regular. I like to add everything in the beginning except for the cream cheese. I serve this over egg white noodles.

This was a tasty and easy to prepare dinner. I found I only needed to cook the chicken for four hours in my slow cooker. I added some sauteed mushrooms to the mixture and served over egg noodles.

My chicken was done in about 3.5 hours. I added a little sour cream to mine. I used 2.7 oz of Italian dressing mix due to not paying attention to the instructions but it wasn't much of a problem. I also used 2 tablespoons of butter instead of 1 tablespoon of margarine. My biggest tips would be DO NOT SEASON YOUR CHICKEN with anything other than the Italian dressing mix. My family loved the recipe. The chicken was so tender! Went nicely over egg noodles. I think if i would have left the chicken unattended it could have resulted in dry, possibly burnt meat.

Very good basic recipe. I used dark meat, as I had it on hand. It only seem to miss a component to cut the creaminess/sweetness. I believe next time I will add dry white wine to the chicken while it is cooking to introduce a bit of tang, or perhaps some capers.

Delicious and so easy. I give it five stars as is. You can follow it exactly and be very happy. I've swapped cream of mushroom soup for cream of chicken, and added a cup of frozen peas for the final 30 min to add some vegetables. But you truly do not have to make any changes if you don't want to. Great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, and the taste was ok.  It was like one of those quick instant pasta sauce kinda taste. Didn't taste like a regular or traditional stroganoff, perhaps, substituting cream cheese with sour cream could have made a bit more authentic taste.  Meat was soft and easy to chew, but not sure a good chicken meat is a fit for this recipe, as I rather wanted to enjoy just a normally cooked meat than overly soft chicken meat (lost flavor).  Overall, if you don't want to use a canned or instant sauce and still want a satisfaction of so-called "homemade" sauce, then, this menu could work.

This was alright. I like the idea of the chicken cooking with just a little butter and the seasoning. The cream cheese combined with cream of chicken soup made it a little too heavy and rich for my taste. I served it over brown rice. I will probably make this again and serve over egg noodles.

This was the first recipe I tried using my new slow cooker! Very delicious, but I did make a few changes as well. After reading the other reviews, I added the cream of chicken first. I also added 1/3 cup of wine. The sauce ended up being very thick (not a bad thing at all), but I am worried about reheating it. Next time I think I'll add a bit more wine and perhaps less cream cheese.

I found this recipe on Pinterest and thought that would try because it seems very easy. It was certainly easy to make and tasted really good. I didn’t follow the exact times of the recipe. It suggests to let chicken cook with the Italian dressing for 4 ½ hours before adding the cream cheese and soup. I think that I added the cream cheese and soup after 2 hours of cooking. I don’t believe it will make much of a difference if you mix everything together sooner. I served it over noodles instead of rice so it would be more like a stroganoff. I put in only half of the packet of Italian dressing mix after reading reviews that said it was too salty. I thought the taste was perfect so I would recommend only using half of the Italian dressing mix. However, it was almost too creamy for me. I think next time that I might try using half of the cream cheese and maybe add some white wine. I think that it definitely made enough sauce as it seemed to be more sauce than chicken. Next time, I think I’ll try adding some onions and mushrooms to the sauce. I think this recipe can be absolutely delicious with some slight tweaking. All in all, it makes for a quick and tasty meal.

5 Quick Tips: To darken, mix some paprika into soup before adding to the crockpot. Season the chkn w/ a Good Seasons packet before slicing them up. I find 3/4 bar of cream cheese is more than enough. If sauce is too thick, in last hour of cooking thin it with a splash of wine or chkn.broth. In the last 20-30 mins, add in 3 or 4 heaping handfuls of freshly cut ribbons of Swiss Chard to add fabulous color, texture, and flavor. WOW, THIS IS JUST TOO DELISH 2B THIS EZ!!??

My boyfriend loved it; all I could taste was boiled chicken, and it seemed really rich to me, even using neufchatel instead of full-fat cream cheese. With some lemon juice, lemon-pepper seasoning, a cup or so of water, and some crushed red peppers, it was palatable, but I don't think I'd make it again (unless specifically requested!).

Like many others who have left reviews, I ended up revamping the recipe to make it my own. I cubed the chicken, used the salad dressing mix, and the margarine. However I only cooked the mixture long enough for the chicken to whiten, approximately 1.5 hours on low. I then added one small can of cream of mushroom soup and cooked it all for one more hour. Since I was preparing this late at night, I ended up putting the chicken mixture in the refrigerator over night. The next day, I heated the mixture, added 1 small bag of frozen green beans, half of a small onion (chopped), 1 small can of sliced mushrooms, and only half of a block of cream cheese. This I cooked until everything was hot, but the onions were still crunchy. I served it over egg noodles. Overall, we loved how it turned out. I do think if I had made it exactly how the recipe called for, we would have been very dissapointed. Next time, I think I will add some sliced carrots and maybe either frozen cauliflower or corn.

Delicious. I didnt have chicken breasts so I used chicken thighs but othernthan that I followed the instructions exactly and it turned out great. I think next time I may soften the cream cheese before I put it in the slowcooker just so it will mix in a bit better. I am from Canada and the Italian dressing mix is in 28 gram packages so I used 1/2 a pkg which was just right. The sauce was excellent on noodles and this will go into our regular rotation. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

We loved this!  I added a can of Campbell's roasted garlic cream of mushroom at the beginning instead of the end, but after reading some other reviews I may not do that next time. We love lots of flavor, so I rubbed the chicken with an Italian seasoning mix before cutting into cubes in addition to the dry pack of zesty Italian dressing mix that goes in the crock pot. Served over whole wheat egg noodles with a side green salad. I think it would be difficult to mess this up! Enjoy!

YUM!!! I used the frozen chicken breasts in a bag  that I had leftover and were on the edge of freezerburn and threw them in whole, the rest of the recipe worked well, though I did add some milk at the end to thin it out a bit and a can of mushrooms and egg noodles. My mom stopped over and ended up stealing most of it to take home for her and my dad (who's slightly picky, but RAVED about it) :)

the chicken was very very good, i couldn't stop eating it was i was shredding it. but once adding the other ingredients for the "sauce" the soup was over powering and it had a very salty taste, you couldn't even taste the chicken.

My husband liked this, but he says he still prefers a beef version. I could not finish the plate. I did not care for the flavor of this at all. It was salty and not pleasant. I would not make again.

Great, easy recipie. I made this recipe for a small gathering that I had. Everyone ate it up. I was asked how I made it and I was embarassed to tell everyone how simple it was to make. My guests begged me for the recipie. I did make one slight change in the cooking time. I reduced it to half and the chicken was perfect. I had a hunch that cooking chicken breasts in the slow cooker for five hours was too long. I was right. I checked the chicken after two hours in the slow cooker and it was done perfectly.

This is so easy and so , so yummy! I work nights and am always looking for something my guys will eat, other then quick microwave dinners. This is a favorite of my family from the first time I tried it and get requests to make it all the time. I added fresh mushrooms with the cubed chicken, butter and seasonings.

This was very good as is. The next time, I followed the advice of others and just put the frozen chicken breasts in the pot with the dressing mix, a little wine and some sliced onion. After 8 hrs on low, I shredded the chicken, added 4 oz Neufchâtel and 1/2 cup sour cream, some Hungarian paprika, garlic, broccoli and a bit of milk because it was so thick. I have to say that while this was easier, it looked better with the chicken cut in pieces. All of my kids even loved it-thank you!

This was very very good. I made it with a whole chicken cut up into 8 pieces. I only cooked it for one hour longer and it came out tender and full of flavor. The only thing I'll do next time is lower the amount of seasoning and margerine because it was fine but I'm guessing in this case fewer is more and it'll be a little less fatty. But otherwise it was very good, the whole family loved it and I'll be definitely be making it again. 
I served it over brown rice with a side salad. YUM!

So easy and delicious! Have made this for two family reunions and its always a hit! I love that it is easy, feeds a crowd, and frees up my time when I have guests. I add broccoli and fresh mushrooms to the dish and serve it with French bread and salad.

I was very excited to make this after reading all the reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and it tasted ok.  My biggest complaint was the texture of the chicken, it was so slimy I couldn't stomach eating it.  Also, I think it is too creamy and rich for my taste.  I won't be making this dish again.

Big hit with kids! Poured it over bowtie pasta. Only reason I did't give it 5 stars was because it's so rich that you really don't want to eat leftovers the next day.

First time making this and i love it. I didn't have the dry Italian mix so i used the same amount of Italian dressing mix in the actual wet dressing. turned out just as good I'm sure. Near the end I added pepper, basil, and parsley.

Very easy to make and very yummy! I added some frozen mixed veggies and put it over noodles. The kids actually cleaned their plates!

I followed this exactly with ingredients and instructions. This was "ok" right when I served it. I would have given it 3 stars. The family didn't care for it. The next day, I re-heated it for myself for lunch and it was 4 stars, which I think is weird because I HATE leftover chicken in any form. I thought the cream of chicken was so over-powering that the cream cheese was completely undetectable. I am not opposed to condensed "cream of" soups...I use them all the time, so I'm not one of these people on here that gets all hyper about using them and how wrong it is, I just didn't like it in this recipe. I'm wishing I would have used cream of mushroom instead. Maybe I'll try it again.

I likely won't make this again. The chicken tasted overcooked and even though I used lowfat ingredients it still seemed like a really rich and heavy meal. It was easy though.

I found it to be just OK at best. It was way too salty and way too thick. I only used two large chicken breasts but left sauce amounts the same. I also only put in half the italian dressing packet. In the end I had to add 1/2 a can of chicken stock to thin it out and then it was still too thick. Likely if I make this again I will use a whole can of stock, a whole can of cream of mushroom soup rather than cream of chicken (both will be low sodium)and only 4 oz of cream cheese and only use one tablespoon of the seasoning packet. Plus I will add some mushrooms and diced onions to give it a little better flavor. It was just average to less then average as it was. I'm sure the leftovers will end up in the trash.

Pretty good and very easy! It was heavy though and we could only eat a little at a time. I threw in some baby carrots and served it over egg noodles.

Just ok for me, but the kids loved it.  I was super simple, especially since I used chicken right from the freezer (I always do that with my crockpot chicken recipes and they never usually take extra time).  I took it out and cut into chunks while the cream cheese was melting away.

This recipe could not be easier to make, and my dh loved it.  He doesn't usually eat egg noodles, but there was nothing left on his plate.  I served with a salad, very comforting meal.  Make this, you won't regret it!

Amazing!  Heck, you could skip the cream cheese and soup and eat the chicken for a meal after the first step.  I cooked the chicken for 4 hours on low and then added the cream cheese and soup.  The chicken was great.

My family was so excited to try this but it was WAY too salty made as is, even with using the low sodium cream of chicken.  If I make this again I would cut the amount of salad dressing mix in half so it is not so salty.

I followed the instructions exactly but I found it bland, the texture was excellent but it lacks a kick. Adding pepper helped but it still lacked that missing flavor any suggestions are most welcomed.

Loved this recipe! Super easy and a total hit with the whole family. Only four stars because I couldn't imagine a stroganoff recipe without onions and mushroom (which I added during the first step with the chicken). Will absolutely be making this again. Thanks!

Made this for my family of 11 (yes, 11) last night-it was a huge hit!  Other than butter instead of margarine, I made it as written.  Everyone went back for seconds, and some for thirds.  I served it over egg noodles and will make it again.  This was a great, super-easy meal for a large family.

I really like this recipe.  It was easy.  I used frozen chicken and I did add in some chicken broth to keep it moist.  I think it is a little too thick, so I just added in more chicken broth.  I was making this for another family, so I didn't add anything. But I can see how versatile this recipe could be, by adding in fresh mushrooms and peas and carrots or even broccoli, or even going fancy and doing spinach, artichokes and sundried tomatoes.  Easy and delicious as is though!  I used whole wheat noodles too and the low fat cheese and soup.  I doubled this and 1 packet of dressing was plenty.

This recipe was not only easy, it was wonderful!!! I used the dry Ranch packet instead of the Italian, because I didn't have it on hand and the chicken was delicious!! I used Fat Free everything else and it turned out really good. I cooked my Whole Grain Egg Noodles on the stove and mixed it all together before serving - wasn't a bite left! Will be doing this recipe again & again!! :)

There were a few things that I did wrong when I cooked this. Definitely pay attention to the time, I let my chicken cook way too long and it was dry as a bone. But I could tell that if I hadn't screwed it up, this would have been awesome.

SUPER EASY crock pot recipe, taste great! I think I may lower the amount of cream cheese by 1/4 next time. I double the recipe and I made noodles and rice for 7 of us, preference was the rice. I will make again, would be a little fun to play with adding caramelized onions. And using low fat cream cheese and low sodium chicken soup. It was a little salty, but when added to the noodles/rice it balanced out ok. Will make again!

SO EASY!!!  This is my second time using this recipe.  I had a frozen package of boneless chicken  breasts so I looked up a slow cooker recipe. I cubed the 3 large breast and I used 2 cans of cream of chicken with one package of italian seasoning mix (I like lots of gravy).  I did not use any butter, but I don't think it needed it. I added the cream cheese 30 minutes before serving, just enough time for it to melt. I normally serve it over white rice (boil-in-the-bag). I do not think it was too salty. My family loves this recipe and it smells great while it cooks.

Cooked this for the family and guest Thursday night and everyone loved it. My husband and his friends are military and asked if they could eat with us and I decided to try this out. They ABSOULUTELY (yes i put soul) loved it. I had to double the recipe and use a 1\4 cup of sour cream because I had only purchased one package of cream cheese when shopping for the recipe for just my family. But it turned out delicious and had the house smelling great!

We liked it, added mushrooms and peas. Agreed with suggestions to omit margarine, use 1/2 package of dressings mix and 1/2 a Neufatel cream cheese. I could not believe that the frozen pieces of chicken could be put in the cooker with just the spices and it cooked okay! Shredded the chicken just before the soup was added.

My husband loved it! I did make a few changes based on some of the reviews I read.   I cooked the chicken with the seasoning and chicken broth for 4 hours then I added the cream cheese, soup (mushroom and cream of chicken b/c I doubled the recipe) and 1 cup sour cream and left that on high for an hour.  It was delicious.

This is an awesome recipe! It is wonderful to come home to the smell of the chicken in the pot and it tasted wonderful over rice or pasta. My husband won't keep his fingers out of the pot while it's cooking though!

This is my favorite recipe discovery on this site. I've made is several times and it's a big hit every time. It's easy to make and delicious. The left overs heat up well. I've made it at least fifteen times since last winter and still love it.

Holy moly this was fantastic!  With every bite, I had to comment (like in the movie "What About Bob").  You can imagine: Chomp - yum!  Chomp -- uuum! Chomp -- so good! Ha. I didn't change a single thing and it was melt-in-my-mouth savory.  Super easy and will definitely make again!

I loved it, but to make it low fat and much more healthy, I used 3 Tablespoons virgin olive oil instead of butter or margarine and fat free cream cheese instead of regular. I also did this in a frying pan as well, makes up in about 30 minutes if your looking for a quicker version. Still like the slow cooker way better though.

I was just looking for something to throw together for a hectic day and found this out of the blue and it was a hit with my wife and kids and so easy.  We used one can of Cream of Chicken and one of Cream of Mushroom as I used a bit to much chicken.  Turned out wonderful. I think we'll try some white wine next time and add fresh mushrooms in the last hour or two.  I'll be trying this one out at the firehouse real soon and sure it will be well received.

I made this on the stove top & it came out delicious. I've also made it in the crock pot & the only difference is the chicken was more tender. I added all ingredients as "prescribed" & made no changes. I don't give away 5 stars easily but this recipe definitely deserves it.

Fast, easy, delicious, what more could you ask? We serve it over pasta and I add sliced mushrooms when I add the cream cheese and soup. I also add a cup of chicken broth at the beginning bc ours is too dry otherwise. I guess it depends on the crockpot.

SO quick and easy! I used frozen chicken breasts and cut them a few hours in. I used real butter, but reduced fat cream cheese and healthy request soup. Served over "No Yolks" egg noodles. I will definitely make this again!

Oh my! I was extremely excited about this stroganoff when it was done, I probably said, "You just got taste this" about 15 times to the people that live in my house and there are only 4 of us. I am surprised there was actually any left to eat when we were ready to have dinner, ha! I did use a lower sodium Cream of Ckn. Soup and Whole Wheat Pasta. Everything else I kept just like the recipe, it was great and filled the air with an incredible aroma all day.

I started with a 1/2 packet of the Good Seasonings garlic & herb mix and added as I went along, eventually using the entire packet. I used 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom and after adding the cream cheese, I thinned it out with a combination of half & half and water. I also tossed in some dried chives and parsley for a little color and about half an onion, diced and sauteed in 1 Tbsp butter and a little of the Good Seasonings mix. About 15 minutes before serving, I added about 8 oz of sour cream to tone down the cream cheese flavor a tad and it worked perfectly. My crockpot is a beast, so even at low, I had this on the table exactly 2.5 hours after I threw in the raw, cubed chicken. Served over a bed of egg noodles, it was pretty good. I would make it again with the addition of fresh, sauteed mushrooms thrown in at the end, as well as half the cream cheese and adding sour cream to taste. Next time, I'd like to try serving over a bed of garlicky, red mashed potatoes.

This recipe is great as is! The only thing I did after making it as written the first time was to have it with some steamed broccoli on the side the second time.
It is a little bit heavy and creamy with the soup and cream cheese so I think having a good side of veggies helps to balance that out.
When I made this a third time I added a splash of red wine in the beginning (which is a good way to add moisture without altering the flavor for those who are worried about too little liquid from the start)
All in all, great recipe to come home to after a long day at work.

I have made this a few times and it is always a big hit! The first time i made it it was a bit on the salty side, so now I also add a few whole garlic cloves with the chicken in the beginning, I think that it gives it a bit more flavor. I love how easy it is, I work two jobs and am in school my crock pot and recipes like this have saved my life!

Gave this a 5-star rating because the taste was good (at least 4-4.5 stars), but the ease of making and prep pushed over the top for me. No time, and no space due to a kitchen reno and this was the perfect go to! Kids requested I make again! Would be good with a crusty loaf w/butter!

Every time I try to cook with canned soups, I am disappointed.  This didn't taste at all like stroganoff to me.  The only change I made was to do half sour cream and half cream cheese.  Thought it was very bland.  Won't make again.

I used reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat soup, and substituted boneless chicken thighs.  I also substituted olive oil for the margarine.  Cooking the chicken without the soup and cheese gives it a nice texture and even browns it a little.  Served over whole wheat pasta.  Nice dish- will make again.

I was sooo skeptical that this would work I almost changed it, but I read the other reviewers and decided to try it as directed.  It was great!  The next time I made it I doubled the dressing mix and I doubled the sauce ingredients so we could serve this over mashed potatoes and YUM YUM! Thanks for the great recipe.

When the whole family raves about a recipe, I give it 5 stars.  Everyone went back for seconds, 3 year old told me it was delicious, and my son asked for the leftovers in his lunch this morning.  Extra points for being a very easy recipe with only 4 ingredients.  Will definitely make this again.

This was super simple to prepare.  I thought this was an okay basic everyday recipe, but my family didn't care as much for it and said they'd rather not have it again.  We don't eat much stroganoff, so if you are a stroganoff lover, I think this would please you more.

This was really good, I left the breasts whole and added 8 oz. of fresh sliced mushrooms and sprinkled sliced green onions over it before serving.  I served it over wide flat noodles with a salad and garlic bread and everyone enjoyed. So easy and quick will certainly make it again,

This is tasty and easy. Only took 2.5 hrs for the chicken to cook and only need half a package of Italian seasoning otherwise it's a bit too salty for us.

I was so excited to make this recipe.  Simple and great ratings... BUT... if you have a dislike for tuna casserole, this is what is tasted like.  I wouldn't make this again.

Followed recipe except for using "healthy request" cream of chicken soup and reduced fat cream cheese.  Easy & tasty, but both hubby & I found it too salty.  Plan to make again, but probably with only 1/2 packet of dressing mix.

Really liked the way the chicken itself cooked.  it actually browned some.  think it could be used in other recipes.

I've made this a few times as written.  I have had great success substituting cooking creams instead of plain cream cheese for added flavor.  Savory Garlic and Italian cheese and herb are both wonderful.

This recipe was the best!! I didn't use the margerine, and just sprayed the crockpot with pam.  I also added a 10 ounce pkg mushroom sliced and some fresh spinach.  I also doubled the recipe and served it over brown rice!! I used all fat free ingredients because I am on weight watchers and served with green beans.  Delicious!!

Of course, I had to modify it.  I made this with chicken thighs, and over long grain rice.  Excellent that day and 2 days later.  
Next time, and there will be a next time, I will add a can of mushrooms, and put the cream cheese and soup in with the other ingredients, to give the cream cheese a chance to melt.  I sent the recipe to my cousin.  She's going to try it over noodles... I told her I want to be invited to dinner!

This is good but a little on the rich side.  I even used reduced fat cream cheese and healthy request soup...kids liked it, but was a bit heavy for them.  The ease to make was great, considering I threw in frozen breasts.  The tenderness was good too...served over egg noodles.  I will probably make again but cut down the amount of cream cheese and soup and maybe add some water.

I've had this recipe for a while and just today decided to give it a shot mainly bc our recipe rotation was getting old and this looked SOOO easy. I'd tried a few others with with rather blah results but this was AWESOME! I had to change a few things to make due with what I had at home but the result could not have been that far off from the original recipe. I used bnls/sknls thighs, added a can of sliced mushrooms, used lowfat mushroom soup and half of an 8 oz. container of whipped cream cheese w/chives. I would make this for company without a doubt in fact I emailed the recipe to each of our 4 kids. THANKS for this great change of pace, YUMMM!

When I made this recipe, it reminded me of Milwaukee's Famous Turner Hall's Angry Chicken Pasta.

Surprisingly fantastic. Only change, I added about 1/2 cup sour cream with the cream cheese. I did not reduce any of the existing elements. I used an all natural version of the Italian Dressing, worked great no issue. I cooked the egg noodles al dente then added them to the pot and folded them in gently. About 15 minutes later the noodles were perfectly yummy. So bland otherwise, must must get your noodles in that sauce before serving. Such a satisfying dinner. Definitely heavy, however. Husband loved it, unfortunately my 4 and 2 year olds would not touch the noodles and only ate the chicken plain with no sauce. Consequently, not a perfect meal for my situation, but it will be great leftovers for me and hubby.

This dish came out better than I expected! I substituted boneless skinless chicken thighs since it's what I had on hand but I prefer thighs anyway. I didn't have egg noodles either so I had to substitute that as well. This was so easy. I will definitely be making this again :)

It was tasty, but really kind of a belly-buster.  If you are looking for something light, this is not the recipe to make.

At lunchtime, I threw in the frozen chicken breasts, 3/4 of the salad dressing mix and fat free cream of mushroom soup into the crockpot on low. I added a generous heaping of sliced fresh mushrooms but NO margarine or butter.  Came home 5 hours later and added 3/4 container of low fat cream cheese, shredded the chicken in the crockpot, and began boiling water for the egg noodles.

Very easy to make, but as I said, it was a HEAVY meal. I had to add some milk to the sauce - it was way thick.  I took the leftover sauce, added some more milk to thin it out a bit, and froze it for another meal.

Delicious!  Couple of changes I made: used 3 large breasts instead of 4, added ~1/3 c white wine at the beginning, and next time I'll add some frozen peas when I add the sauce.  The chicken was starting to stick at the 5 hr mark, will shorten cook time next time.  Also, the sauce was a little thick - I think I'll thin with milk when I re-heat.  Served over egg noodles with steamed carrots.  Delish!

I cut everything in half and it was way too salty! I couldn't believe it had gotten such good ratings. I served it on top of white rice and it was still too salty.

It was delicious and easy to make! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the sauce was a little to thick. I would recommend adding come milk.

I gave this recipe 4 stars. This was a good recipe! When I made this recipe I used all off brand items including the chicken. This still turned out great! My picky 9 yr old newphew didn't care for this but my hubby and I did. I will make this again for sure! Thanks for posting!

This is a great recipe and one that I will definitely be holding onto.  I have two boys that are picky eaters and they absolutely loved it!  I did make a few changes just because I didn't have it on hand.  Instead of dry mix, I used 3 TBS of Italian dressing, 1/4 cup cooking wine, put that in with the butter and chicken and let cook on low.  Then mixed together soup, cream cheese and 1/2 cup sour cream.  Mixed it altogether first then poured over chicken and cooked while I was cooking the egg noodles.  Delicious, thanks for sharing.

So so good. I love that I could make most of it in the crockpot and only have to take an extra ten minutes to make noodles. I added a small onion 4 hours into it... I think I may add even more onion next time, because by 6 hours, the onions were gone, but a very good taste in it.

This is an easy and delicious recipe. I made it for company. I followed the directions completely only adding 1/2 milk to make it a bit creamier. It tastes exactly like the "Alfredo Chicken" I love at a local restaurant. I will make this again.... for sure.

Awesome recipe just as is!  For additional interesting texture, add some sliced almonds with the chicken breasts at the beginning.  They toast up nice and give a little crunch to the dish.  Served this over angel hair pasta.  YUM!

I did not really care for it. My husband liked it but thought it needed some veggies. Everything I'd like to add though no one else likes (broccoli, bell pepper, and peas!). May make it again in the future but I'll have to doctor it a bit.

This is sinfully easy.  I throw in 3-4 frozen breasts, and some white wine with the other ingredients and it's crock-pot ready when I get home.  Cooked on low, with the cream cheese and a small sour cream added before serving over penne!

Easy and delicious!  Like others, I use reduced fat cream cheese, and add fresh mushrooms.  For an added flare when I have the time, I sear the chicken first on the grill just enough to get the extra flavor and golden brown touch.  I slice into medalions instead of cube, which impacts presentation more than flavor.  This is one that if I forget about it for awhile, the family requests it!  I serve it over Whole Grain noodles or regular egg noodles if I can't find the whole grain.

Loved it! Some changes: I didn't have a packet of dressing mix, so I googled it and used dry spices on hand to approximate the mix. I used sour cream instead of cream cheese, and also doubled the cream of chicken soup to make it nice and saucy. I started with frozen chicken breast halves. They were cooked and ready to shred within 4 hours on low. I wouldn't cube the chicken first, because I think that would make it dry. A perfect meal with egg noodles and some broccoli - my 4 year old raved and raved.

Thought this was a great recipe, and very simple.  I did add 2 cans of portabella mushrooms and about a cup of peas.  I also added a dried herb mixture from my garden than included swiss chard, basil, and a hint of cinlantro.  I made these additions when the cream cheese and soup were added.  These additions made it stand out.

This is an absolute family favorite.  It never fails to get rave reviews whenever I make it and for whomever I make it for.  Easy and delicious.  What more could you ask for?

I make this often and it's become a favorite with family and company.   Great flavors.  I make it just as directed and add frozen peas in at the end.  Lovely.

We served this over egg noodles and my family loved it!  I added a little ground red pepper as we like a little zip.

I changed the white meat for bonless dark leg and it was moist and great over rice or noodles. Simple to make too.

I followed the recipe exactly, it was delicious!! I made it with country style wide noodles. The only complaint is that the chicken got a little done on the top with just cooking it with the butter and dressing. I might put a little broth in next time. Other than that, it was great. Will become a crock pot staple!

This recipe was AWESOME! My family loved it and my husband said it reminded him of meals he's had at some of our favorite restaurants.  I am having friends over and will definitely serve this.  As some of the other reviewers commented, I, too, think some white wine added to it would be a nice flavor enhancer.  It is very rich because of the cream cheese, so a little goes a long way over some hot, cooked egg noodles.

I hate to be one of the few to not rave about this, but we didn't like it at all. The cream cheese was too much. I don't normally make things like this and don't remember the last time I used cream cheese in anything but cheesecake, so it may be that we're just not used to it. I loved the idea of it and it was super easy to make, but my family didn't want to keep eating it after the first couple of bites.

This is an excellent stroganoff.  My family loved it.  I will make it again but will make some altercations based on my tastes.  Next time I will shred the chicken instead of cube it.  It reminded me too much of tuna fish with it cubed.  Additionally, I will add onions and some white wine.  wouldn't be bad to add some vegetables either.  Great meal.  You won't be disappointed if you make it.  we doubled the receipe and had enough to have 3 meals for a family of 4.

Honestly, I thought it was pretty bland and too salty.  However, this recipe was so easy, I may try it again.  If I do, I will use zesty dry italian salad dressing mix, low sodium soup, add bell peppers, and top with a fresh herb like parsley & basil.

With over 2000 positive reviews I decided to try this recipe.  The house smelled amazing during cooking and no Febreeze scent could compete.     The taste was even better than the smell.   Very easy to make and tasted great.  I love mushrooms so I added them to this dish.   I will be making this dish again.

My boyfriend and I were verydisappointed by this dish.  I followed the instructions exactly, but the chicken was very bland.  Maybe an additional packet of the italian dressing might have bumped up the flavor.  I have a big container of leftovers cuz my bf won't eat anymore of it. I'll just freeze the rest in individual portions for grabbing on those running-late mornings.  Recommend adding more spices!

Great Slow Day Recipe!  My kids eat this every time.  I add frozen pes and carrots during the last minutes of the recipe and allow it to cool before serving.  My son was 14 months old the first time I made this and he cleaned his plate twice!

I didn't get the rave reviews on this dish from the kids like others did.  When we first came home the house smelled so good, and I couldn't wait to eat it, but we had to leave again, and let it cook some more on just warm instead of low.  The chicken alone tasted great!  But the cream cheese and soup was very thick even though I added it at the very end like the recipe called for.  In the end it was like eating a past or a thicker version of Elmers glue.  I might try it one more time to see if I can thin it out some, but I have four kids and if they won't eat it, it is a waste for us.  Again, I could have done something wrong, or my kids just may be the odd ones.  So don't count it out, just try it.

A few additions make this dish company-worthy: Put the chicken and seasonings in the slow-cooker with a cup of diced onion and some white wine for about an hour before adding the rest of the ingredients. Adding a package of sliced mushrooms boosts the flavor of the dish. If you like it, drizzle on a little white truffle oil just before serving! Toss on a sprinkle of fresh chopped parsley for some color.

I love this recipe! It's soooo yummy. I have made it a bunch of times on the fly when I don't know what to make. I even make it on Friday's in lieu of pizza! It's warm, comforting, and even better the next day! I make it with reduced fat or fat free cream cheese and soup and whole wheat noodles. Sometimes I add corn or potatoes or mushrooms. LOVE IT!

This meal was very good. I doubled the receipe so it would last a few extra days. I used 2 lbs of boneless chicken breast tenderloins, after cooking for 5 hours..they just fell apart on their own. Very creamy, love the cream cheese. Served it with egg noodles and carrots. Only bad thing is that it is too salty. My entire family commented on how salty it was. Next time I'll use low sodium cream soup.

I love this stuff. I use 1/3 less fat cream cheese, half the packet of seasoning (which has plenty of seasoning to me, and that way I can use the same packet next time), and add a little jar of mushrooms. Yum!

We loved this! I did add 3/4 cup of pinot grigo and some sour cream at the end.  I also threw the breasts in whole and then shredded them at the end. Another note, I used low fat on the ingredients and forgot the butter, but was still great.  House smelled wonderful within and hour.  A true keeper!

I tried this out once and the flavor was okay. I like that it was very simple and called for ingredients that I already had on hand. I also loved that I could put the chicken in the slow cooker while still frozen and it came out moist and shredded easily. Not sure if I'll make it again the way the recipe is written, but I will most likely make the chicken the same without adding the cream cheese and soup mix in at the end.

Tried this recipe today.  Overall, simple to prepare and had good flavor, but it was way too salty.  I will use lower sodium cream of chicken soup next time.

This is SO good and SO easy.  I throw the chicken in whole and frozen with the butter and seasoning and it's ready to shred after 4-5 hrs on low.  A huge hit in my house!

I followed the recipe mostly as described and served over egg noodles. Like others said in their comments, I cooked the chicken breasts whole then tore apart once cooked and that worked just fine. I was a bit worried that the sauce was going to come out too thick so I added some water to it after I dumped the cream cheese and soup in, but in retrospect I may not have needed to. We definitely enjoyed this and I expect we'll make it again. Very quick, easy, and tasty.

Very simple and yummy recipe. Only thing I might change in future is to put a little chicken stock or something in while the chicken initially cooks. The chicken turned out dry and it was set on low for only 6 hours.  Still good though and I did add a small can of mushrooms.

Stir the chicken throughout so it does not clump. We used half the chicken and paired with egg noodles - delicious.

This turned out really tasty. I added fresh mushrooms along with the soup and cream cheese. It seemed a little bland so I added some onion powder and white pepper. Served with noodles.

Great recipe.  Famliy of 5 loved it.   Added one can of chicken broth with chicken as recommended by other reviewers.  Cooked chicken for 4 hours on high.  Blended the cream cheese and cream of chicken together and added to crock pot for 1/2 hour on high.  Turned out perfect.

Loved this recipe just as it's written.  I used frozen chicken breasts, so the prep work was about 30 seconds.  It's a great recipe for a busy weeknight.  I served it with green beans and rolls, and the family loved it!!!!  Even slightly picky kids!!  Thanks for a new go-to staple recipe!

We LOVED it!  My whole family.  The only thing we did differently was I added a cup a water to the chicken while it was cooking and then some mushrooms at the end.  We ate it on gluten free pasta.  This is a keeper for us!  So easy!

This is delicious!  I made 2 small changes.  Added fresh sliced mushrooms in the last 1/2 hour of cooking and did add a little chicken broth as the "sauce" was quite thick.  I also recommend mixing together the cream cheese and soup until smooth before adding to the chicken, otherwise the cream cheese is a little chunky.  This was an easy and quite flavorful weeknight meal.  Will definately make again!

So easy to make, so delicious to eat!  Made egg noodles to go with instead of rice.  Looking forward to the leftovers.  Prepared everything at lunchtime, put in the crock pot - when we got home from work it was time to add final ingredients, finish cooking & make noodles.  Ate within an hour of getting home.

I don't often review recipes but had to say i was very disappointed with this recipe. I had my slow cooker on the low setting (10 hrs) and after 1 hour the mixture was already scorching the sides so I added the soup and cream cheese early. No way does this recipe need 5-6 hours. It was too creamy for my liking; would not try this recipe again.

Delicious recipe.  My house smelled amazing. I made a couple of small changes.  I used butter instead of margarine (personal preference).  The finished product was a little too thick so I took the advice of another reviewer and added about a cup of chicken stock. My family (all ages) loved it!

This is the bomb!  Easy and so rich and tasty!  My two-year old granddaughter shovels it in and says "ummm" with every bite!  I double the recipe to feed my large family.  It has become one of our favorite regulars.  The only thing I do differenly is to cook the chicken 4 hours and then heat the cream cheese and soup in the microwave and then pour into the chicken mixture.

This was a tasty dish.  My husband and I really enjoyed it.  I used frozen chicken breasts and added 1/2 cup of white wine along with the butter (not margarine), and dressing packet.  I also added a 1/4 c. of low-fat sour cream along with the cream cheese and soup. Served over wheat egg noodles.  Will definitely make again.

ONO as we say in Hawaii!!!  This dish is wonderfully easy to make and so good as is!  A little on the salty side for me because of the cream of chicken, but not enough to make me give it any less than 5 stars!!!

This was so good.  I added a little cayenne pepper since we like it a bit spicy.  I cooked bow tie pasta and poured the stroganoff on top.

This recipe is so easy and SOOO delicious!  I did change a couple things.  I put a little chicken broth in with the butter and the chicken because I was a little skeptial about putting only butter in with the chicken.  The chicken turned out nice and golden and smelled delicious!  I also added sour cream at the end to taste.  I served with rotini noodles and bought a loaf of fresh baked bread to dip in the extra sauce.  Delicious!!  I even thought this was better than Beef Stroganoff.

So much better than I expected, the chicken had a yummy roasted flavor.  I used lite cream cheese and low fat soup and added peas and mushrooms and served with whole wheat pasta.

I absolutely love this recipe. Although, I make it without the butter, using fat free cream cheese, and add another cream of chicken.  Tasted great!

This is a great recipe to use! And it's incredibly delicious too! If you want less calories, try using a lower-fat type of cream cheese. Though I wouldn't recommend using a lower fat cream of chicken soup, because it doesn't make it taste as good.

I have enjoyed all of the creative reviews. With my first try at making this dish, I started the project a bit too late in the day to use my slow cooker.  I grabbed a sizable Corningware casserole & lid and baked the first three ingredients in a 300 degree oven for a good hour then I premixed the soup and cream cheese together & added it to the casserole and continued baking for about another half hour.  Wouldn't you know it, I had only a small amount of dried noodles on hand with no time to even make a batch of homemade ones so, I boiled 2/3 of a pkg. of Radiatori pasta in place of the noodles.  Any kind would suffice.  All I can say is YUM!  
I made a doubled batch yesterday, in the slow cooker, for company.  It was a hit.  Thank you Judi Ann and all of the Reviewers.

Excellent!! The only thing I did differently was I put the chicken breasts in frozen and didn't cube them. EASY! The best part was that my 7 year old LOVED it!

I have never done a review of any recipe here until now.  This was a wonderful and easy meal.  I can't believe I finally found something that both of my picky eaters like.  

I followed the recipe almost completely exept at the 5 hour mark, I shredded the chicken instead of cubing it, and I added fresh mushrooms.   I served it over egg noodles, with garlic bread and green beans.  

Thank you so much!  This will defintely be a regular in our house.

Pretty darn good!  I wanted a true stroganoff flavor so I used Lawry's Beef Stroganoff seasoning packet instead of the italian dressing.  I also used about 1/2 cup of sour cream, since a true stroganoff uses that as well.  My family also loves their pasta's saucey, so I used one can of chk mushroom, and 1 can of cream of chk.  Lastly, I added some baby bella mushrooms.   Came out really well.  Like other reviewers I used Healthy Start soups, fat free sour cream and fat free cream cheese.  The flavor was still there.  I ended up using Farfalle as the pasta, since I couldn't find a healthier egg noodle.   Will make again.

This dish is very rich & thick. Served with peas & egg noodles for a complete meal & was delicious. Had to put the slow cooker on high for 20min in order to melt the cream cheese enough. Will make this dish again!

This recipe was okay to me. I'm giving three stars because of the simplicity of the recipe, and because my husband claimed to like it. The only changes I made were adding a splash of white wine (riesling), using light fat-free cream cheese, and a can of water. I will only make this recipe again by request.

My husband and two teen daughters ate this up with no complaints.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and we loved it just as it's written. P.S. my one daughter runs distance on the track team and has been craving carbs. She gobbled this up! Thanks for sharing.

Tastes great but cooks faster than the recipe indicates which is why I didn't give it 5*s. I've made it as written but have also added mushrooms &/or white wine. I think the additions give it a little something-something.

This is a definitely a keeper for me. Very easy to make and really tasty. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken though because that's what I had on hand. Otherwise, I prepared it exactly as instructed. Used Good Seasons italian dressing mix. Also I served it over a bed of egg noodles.

I use a pkg. of dry Italian style salad dressing on the pasta, when making pasta salad. I'm sure this will be a winner too, that stuff tastes so good. I plan to make this soon so my rating isn't valid but I had to give it one.............

I followed the recipe as some others had suggested and cooked the frozen chicken breasts in the dry italian dressing mix, cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soups, mixed with about 1/4-1/2 cup of milk for 5 hours.  At the end, I added in 1/4 block of cream cheese and 1/2 cup of sour cream for about 30 minutes.  Turned out absolutely delicious and even my picky husband went back to finish off the pot!

Great recipe for a family meal.  I added a small can of corn and some frozen peas towards the end just to get some veggies in there and it did feel like it was missing a little something.  Delicious!!  Definitely being added to my favorites and will be in the "meal cycle"

I would make some differences next time I make this. Personally, all of that cream cheese was just too much. It was far too rich, to the point where the next day when my husband reheated the leftovers, the idea of eating it turned my stomach. I'll definitely cut the cream cheese in half if I ever make this again.

I recently viewed this recipe and was shocked at the reviews it received. I purcahsed all the items and prepared it.  VERY VERY GOOD!!  To this recipe I also added a few spoons of cream of mushroom soup. I think this makes a great main dish, but could also make a great dip. As a main dish next time I will add fresh onions and mushrooms with the chicken/dry mixture.  As a dip i will top with mild cheddar and serve with tortilla chips.

My fault but a warning to others... left the crockpot on high and came back 5 hours later to a disaster.  Hopping little pieces of charcoal.  Never happened before with a crockpot recipe for me, so just a warning to others.

I thought it was a little salty for my taste and the kids didn't like it (but they don't like much these days).

I used 6 breasts rather than 4, and I used Cream of Celery instead of the cream of chicken and it came out wonderfully!

Delicious and simple! I was unsure about the 2 T of butter and Italian Seasoning, but the chicken didn't dry out at all! I made it just like it said and my husband ate 3 servings! I just finished eating some leftovers for lunch and it is just as good the next day! I will make this again and again! Not to mention blogging about it!

Very easy and tasty.  I like a little extra "kick", so I use two packages of salad dressing in mine.  I also add a small can of mushrooms.  (The recipe is fine without them; I just happen to love mushrooms.)

The chicken cooked up nicely but the sauce is just plain bland for me.  Maybe I was distracted by the "Stroganoff" name which made me expect a tangier sauce similar to beef stroganoff.  Not bad, but I won't make it again.

I did not have time to make this in the slow cooker, but i followed the recipe as closely as i could on the stove.  I really thought this came out tasting too much like the cream of chicken soup, and i believe it would have been much better with a cream of mushroom.  I tasted the sauce towards the end and added more cream cheese, and still couldnt really taste it.  I will try it in the slow cooker to see if it improves, but i really believe the cream of chicken soup is too overpowering.

My family did enjoy this and the leftovers were gone quickly.  It is something i will make again, but its not one of our all time favorites.

I'm not a fan of chicken cooked in the crock pot but decided to make it after all the good reviews. The flavor was ok but the texture of the chicken was a little funny. My kids loved it, because of the mild flavor and not any vegies in it. This reminded me of 'chicken helper'. I might make it again just because it was easy and the kids liked it a lot.

EASY great recipe.  Just a few changes for me to reduce sodium and fat.  I read all the reviews and to balance the cream cheese and sour cream tastes, I added around 1/2 tsp dried dill - really kicked up the flavor.  I used dried Italian herbs instead of the Italian dressing and reduced the cream cheese to 1/2 cup and 1/2 cup sour cream. I also used Best Life Butter spread to mix the Italian herbs in and then spread that on the chicken breasts. I think this may be more healthful - I hope, because it'll be a often repeated dish.  THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE RECIPE.

I read alot of reviews before trying and these were the adjustments I made. 2 cans of Healthy Request Cream of Chicken w/herbs + 1 can of water, I used italian seasonings instead of the packet of italian dressing, and of course low fat cream cheese! I used bow tie pasta.. it is delicious!!

Yummy!  Like others, I used low fat soup and cream cheese, added veggies and doubled the soup.  Also made a vegetarian version for the vegetarians in the family using cream of mushroom soup. Thanks for the quick and easy dinner fix!

This dish was delicious. I made a few changes. I added a can of mushroom soup and onion. I browned my chicken first then the onions and deglazed the pan with broth. I mixed everything together, added the chicken and cooked it all for about 4 hours on high. I also added a little water because it was very thick. My husband absolutely loved it. I will defintly be making this again.

***If you don't have a packet of a Italian seasoning, you can just 1/3 of prepared Italian dressing.  But, I've been making this recipes for years by putting everything in all together first.    I think Judi's way sounds better!  I think it would work with Judi's way using the dressing and the butter.

This was great and my picky kids loved it!  Put whole chicken breasts in the crockpot and topped with the italian seasonings and the cream chicken soup.  Cooked on low about 4 hours and then shredded the chicken and stirred in the sour cream and some frozen peas and cooked another hour or so.  Ended up adding in a little water at the end because the sauce was really thick.  Skipped the cream cheese as the flavor was great without it.  Served over egg noodles- will definitely be making this again.

A regular is our house! I try to make it healthier sometimes by using reduced fat cream cheese and/or Healthy Request soup. Sometimes we have rice with it & sometimes it egg noodles. Soo good. Reheats fabulously too!

I made this with butter instead of margarine, 1/3 less fat cream cheese and reduced fat soup. It was tasty, but perhaps a bit rich and salty. I might try reduced sodium soup next time. I made just as written and allowed the chicken to cook with the seasoning and butter before adding the soup.

This was great - but since I started it at 2, I didn't have 7 hrs before dinner to let it cook slowly. So, I browned the chicken in the butter after coating it was salad dressing. It turned out great but had to be careful to  not let it burn. Then, I put it in the crock pot with cream cheese, and since I didn't have Cream of Chicken Soup, I used 1/2c sour cream and the liquid from of a can of Campbell's Chicken Noodle. I served it over wide egg noodles - everyone loved it - THANKS!

My entire family devoured this even though the first time I forgot to mix in the cream cheese (D'oh). This also made the ranch extremely powerful. However, it was still tasty and I'm getting ready to make it again tomorrow (with the cream cheese!.) The only change I made was to use pre-packaged frozen chicken breasts and put them in the crockpot frozen and whole with the butter and ranch dressing. I then shredded the chicken and mixed in some cream of chicken soup and some chicken broth. I served it over egg noodles. Looking forward to trying this recipe properly prepared.

Excellent recipe!  I shredded the chicken and added some cooked noodles right in the crock pot after chicken was done.  Alsocooked up some onion and threw that in there for added flavor...it was soooo good.  Have with a salad or garlic toast and you have a wonderful meal.

This was very easy to prepare and the flavor was good; however, it was very salty.  Perhaps a low sodium soup would be a better addition.

To my surprise, my family inhaled this easy crockpot dinner.  I used chicken thighs to retain some of the juiciness, but otherwise left the recipe unchanged.

I thought this dish was awesome! First time using the crockpot my husband and I got for our wedding and it couldn't have been used on a better recipe. I did add in some fresh broccoli when I added the soup and cream cheese to give it some green.

I followed this recipe almost exactly and what I ended up with was almost inedible.  Despite adding a lot more liquid as it cooked, the chicken still turned out very chewy, almost the consistency of beef jerky.  The cream cheese made the sauce overly thick and when combined with the chicken jerky it made a truly awful dish.

This was very good almost like a chicken alfredo, I served it over linguini.  I was pressed for time so I cooked the chicken on high until done then added the cream cheese and soup then turned the crock pot down to low.  It was delish.  The husband liked it.

This was sooo easy to make.  I simply took frozen boneless/skinless chicken breasts (3 of them) and thawed them a bit in the microwave (since I forgot to take them out ahead of time).  I then rinsed them and cut them into pretty good size chunks and added them to the crockpot.  I then added 1/2 can of chicken broth and 1 can of cream of chicken soup plus the Italian seasoning packet.  I mixed it all together and put it on high for about 3 hours, then I put it on low for another hour.  I added the cream cheese just before I was getting the noodles cooked to use to mix with it.  I cooked 1 lb. of noodles, mixed in the sauce w/chicken and walla!  It was a big hit with all and the chicken was sooo moist!  Will definitely make again.  Great for those who don't have much time to cook.

Was pretty good, I had left overs but like everybody else I changed a bit. Added more chicken, chicken broth 1/2 cup and sourcream. Was eaten by kids, but they did not come back for more so made me think they thought it was just ok.

this recipe has a great flavor.  Added white cooking wine to the chicken as PP suggested.  My only complaint is the final product is really thick.  Will try adding chicken broth to the soup and cream cheese at the end to thin it out some. :)

This recipe was so hyped up, I'm not sure if it was my expectations or what, but it just wasn't ALL THAT.  It was good and we ate it, but the line for seconds was non-existant.  In fact, I didn't save for leftovers because nobody would eat them, either.  And I made it EXACTLY as written, I'm not completely changing the recipe and then knocking it because it was bad since I screwed it up (obviously a peeve of mine).  It was rich, but plain.  The chicken was rubbery and I cooked to the low end of the time provided.  BUT, we did eat it and it was EASY.  Just not, well... ALL THAT.

Fantastic : ) Super easy to make. I used Italian seasoning instead of the dressing and added  1 tsp onion powder and 1 tsp garlic powder.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and added a minced clove of garlic.

Still getting use to using a crock pot, but this dish turned out amazing.  I, like a lot of reviewers, was a bit concerned about only putting the chicken, seasoning and butter in for hours beforehand. But the chicken was tender as can be and pretty much fell apart when I went to cut it up before adding the rest of the ingredients.   I used cream of mushroom soup, I sauteed mushrooms and onions in white wine to add to the mixture as well as water chestnuts, chicken broth, and a bit of Chardonnay.  I let the cream cheese melt a bit on top before mixing it in.    The dish is delicious and I will for sure make it again.  Next time, I will use more pepper in the dish or maybe something to add a bit of a kick too it.

I only added half the packet of italian seasoning and I added a little bit of milk while the chicken cooked.  It tasted great, I would make this again.  I served mine with No Yolk noodles.

This was just OK for us. I cut the recipe in half, using just two chicken breast halves. Served over egg noodles. Added about 1/4 cup of white wine. Still tasted as if it was "missing" something...although still not sure what. I'll stick with regular beef stroganoff.

This was just OK for us. I cut the recipe in half, using two chicken breast halves and cooked it in my smaller slow cooker. Cut the rest of the ingredients in half as well. Used butter instead of margarine. Added 1/4 cup white wine when I added the cream cheese & soup mixture. We had this over egg noodles. We weren't too excited over the flavor of this dish. It tasted like it was "missing" something...although not sure what!

I added everything to the slow cooker minus butter.  It still came out wonderfully.  I can see how you would want to add the soups later though as it wasn't smooth and creamy anymore.  Served over egg noodles.  Also this recipe was too salty for me, so next time I will add half the seasoning.

This meal just didn't do it for me and my husband. It was too salty in my opinion. It was edible but I won;t make it again.

This was GREAT!!!!  I added an extra can of cream of chicken soup since I was serving over rice.  My 3 year old son is very picky and he ate an adult sized portion....and he doesn't eat much of ANYTHING!!!  Makes it a keeper in my book.

Excellent recipe.  I used whole chicken cut up pieces (breasts, thighs, legs, wings).  I removed the bones as I shredded the chicken before serving.  I added sauteed mushrooms. Next time I would only add one packet of Good Seasons dressing mix, instead of 2, for the 8 pieces of chicken.  One can of soup and one cream cheese made plenty of sauce, no need to double.  Used butter. Served it over egg noodles.  YUM!  It will be a regular for family gatherings.

Oh, boy, my first review. It was really good and very easy. I tried it once on the family then took it to a team banquet. The first time the seasonings were not enough. The second time I skipped the Cream of Chicken soup and added extra packet of the italian seasoning. I also used lower fat cream cheese. It really was better and less fat that way. using half chicken breast and some thigh meat was delicious, too.

Awesome...second time I made it this week. Following it exactly was great (except I was happy i was home since it needed a few stirs so the chicken didn't stick to the bottom). The second time I made it the less fattening way...both terrific! Oh yeah, my super picky three year old LOVES it!!!

I had to make this simply because it just seemed so odd!  It turned out to be delicious!  I also added peas and a package of pre-sliced mushrooms at the end of the cooking time.  I also substituted butter for margarine, and used low fat cream cheese and lowfat cream of chicken soup.  My husband loved it and it was so quick and easy!

I thought this was really good.  I too added the soup at the beginning along with fresh portobellos and sliced onion.  I used lowfat cream cheese and also stirred in a little dijon mustard before serving over a bed of egg noodles.

Well, I was very disappointed. I should have listened to the reviews.  The whole packet of seasoning was way too salty.  Even though it was too salty it was very bland. Anyway, I don't recommend this dish and I wouldn't even try it again with half the packet.

Perfect meal to make on a Sunday, so dinner is ready during the week.  I'm interested to know if anyone has tried freezing the leftovers.  I'm making this dish today and I'm thinking of freezing half of it.

Great comfort food!  It was so easy to make that my 3 year old even helped me add the different ingredients.  Only down side was that it was a little bit salty.  I think that I may only add 3/4 of the packet of seasoning next time.

What a wonderful easy meal. This reminded me so much of my home made chicken paprikash but creamier. Because I made this while I was at work I didn't feel comfortable leaving the crockpot with dry ingredients only so I added the cream of chicken soup in with the chicken. I also added a splash of white cooking wine per other reviews. I set the timer for 7 hours on low. I added about half to 3/4 of an 8 ounce block of cream cheese when I got home and cooked for an additional 30 minutes on high. Served over whole wheat pasta and a side of green beans amandine.

one of the best crockpot chicken dishes I have had. I made a few tweaks to lower the fat and sodium: only 4 oz cream cheese, no margarine, add low sodium chicken broth to desired consistency. also, if desired, use fine mesh strainer to remove salt from dry italian seasoning packet as there is plenty of salt in canned soup.

This is one of my favorite weeknight recipes. I throw in 4 chicken breasts with 1/4 white wine, butter and a package of italian dressing. When I come home, the house smells amazing! I also use neufachtel cheese to bring down the calories. It's absolutely fabulous!

This didn't turn out at all. I prepared exactly as the recipe stated.  Chicken was overcooked, almost burnt. Way to salty, and we aren't afraid of a little salt. Tasted very processed.

This was pretty good. Everyone finished their plates. I think it was a little too salty but that probably depends on what brand of seasoning packet you use. Next time I will either search for a brand with less salt or I won't use the full packet. Also the sauce was too thick so I added a little bit of milk.

I was unable to find a dry Italian mix, so I used a cup of Italian dressing.    I thought the end result was a little too rich, but the kids liked it a lot.  This was easy to prepare and we will probably have it again.

I was extremely hesitant about this recipe since the chicken goes in with only 1/8 cup of margarine and a packet of seasoning mix... but I read reviews and other people had the same concerns and stated it turned out great! Well... I don't know if it is my slow cooker that is different or if I did something wrong, but JUST AS I EXPECTED the chicken after 7 hours on low was charred! Blackened! I added the cream cheese and soup at this point, and it tasted good, but it was more like chicken jerky than tender chicken cutlets...No idea why everyone else had it turn out great and mine was charred, but it was a bummer. I gave this recipe 1 star for ease, and 1 star for flavor (it actually tastes alright despite the chicken jerky and burnt aftertaste). But otherwise, I remain hesitant to ever put anything in the slow cooker with little/no water.

I made this for the family based on the reviews and the overall rating.  The taste was good, but the sauce was overly thick.  If I made this again, I would definitely add milk, water or broth to make more of a gravy.

I made it with a can of cream of chicken soup and a can of cream of mushroom soup and half a cup of white wine.  I used butter instead of margarine.  Used only half the package of italian dressing mix. I also put all the ingredients (except the cream cheese) in from the start.  I cooked it for 8.5 hours on low then the last half hour on high.  This recipe was an excellent base recipe to work off of.

This was very good, the whole family loved it. I did not use as much butter as it called for. I had to make a bigger batch, I was cooking for 6. Served it over egg noodles and had steamed veggies on the side. Definitely a keeper, thanks!

I wanted to make something hot, hearty & easy today. My BF was home sick with the flu & I thought it would be nice for him to enjoy the house smelling like I was home cooking for him all day when I really had to work. This fit the bill perfectly. I read a lot of reviews and made the following changes to suit our taste; added mushrooms, chopped onions , & 1/4 cup of chicken stock & used 3tbsp butter in step 1. Left on low for 5 hours. Added can of Cambells cream of chicken and mushroom soup & half a can of white wine, 1/2 of the low fat cream cheese along with some frozen peas. It turned out perfect. Served over brown rice.  Thank you Judi.

Absolutely LOVED this.  The whole family devoured it.  Major comfort food.  The only things I changed where adding the cream of chicken soup & a cup of water ( used soup can ) to the chicken, butter, & seasoning & let it all cook together.  I added the water because the first time we made it the sauce was a little too thick.  The water really evened it out.  This is comfort food at it's finest and is loved by family & guests!

Make this exactly as it says, don't be tempted to add the soup and cream cheese in the beginning....you can use reduced or fat free soup and cream cheese, and the results are the same!!  This recipe is in the top five in my house, and I highly recommend it!! *One time I only had half of a block of cream cheese, soI added sour cream to substitute for the rest....it worked great too, and only changed the flavor a tad.

This was really good. I used my own seasoning blend, but kept everything else the same (only because I don't like Italian). I will definitely make again, especially on busy days. Thanks for the recipe.

this was GREAT! I was a little skeptical as well, with such little ingredients but WOW! I left my chicken breasts whole in the crockpot and accidentally put the cream cheese in first-looked a little curd like but tasted SO good. I used low fat cream cheese and 2 cans of 98% fat free cream of chicken soup to make it more "saucy". I opted out of the butter just keep calories down. Awesome! This totally broke me out of my food rut as well. As a mom of one and one on the way, thanks for the excellent but easy recipe!

Another delicious recipe. Make sure you serve this over rice or noodles. The sauce is pretty rich but this dish is so easy, I can't complain.

Wow!!!  This is sooooo yummy...  I consider myself a good cook, and like really flavorful dishes so I did season with additional seasoning but other than that made it as written.  I will definitely make this again and again.  Thank you for the recipe!!

This recipe turned out OK... Was my first time using my slow cooker, which was really easy!  It tasted "alright" - not fantastic. I think it was down to the Italian dressing mix which I will leave out next time and substitute with dried herbs. Also, I won't use the butter - I'll use some olive oil or similar.   On the whole, it was OK, but will make it with some substitutes next time!

Made this tonight, and it was a total hit with the entire family.  Like other reviewers, I did change it up a bit.  I placed two pats of butter, a can of low sodium 98% fat free cream of chicken soup, and half a packet of dry beef strogranoff recipe in the slow cooker and mixed well.  I placed three large thawed chicken breasts on top, and rubbed a bit of the soup mixture on top.  After cooking for five hours on low, the chicken pulled apart very easily with two forks.  I added 4 oz of lowfat cream cheese (Neufactchel) and 4 oz of lowfat sourcream, stirred the mixture (letting quite a bit of heat escape in the process), and then let the contents simmer for about 45 minutes on low before pulling the plug on the cooker.  Still hot half an hour later, it was thick, rich, flavorful and tender...  Perfect.  Thanks to Judi for posting this winner!!!

To be honest, I was skeptical about how this dish was going to turn out.  I'm not a huge fan of cream of chicken soup, it always tastes bland and fatty to me.  But my tastes were proven wrong this time, when my husband and I tried the chicken.  Amazing!  Make it today!

This is so good! I totally missed the instructions to cube the chicken, so I had whole breasts cooking. Otherwise I followed the directions and it turned out wonderful!

This recipe reminds me of the Angel Hair Chicken on this site (which is one of my favourites). I did make a couple of modifications: used margarine instead of butter (and less than 1/8 cup), added 1/2 cup white wine, and I tought the sauce was too thick to serve with pasta so I added milk until the consistency was to my liking. Served over spaghetti pasta (the only pasta I had)... and it was DELICIOUS!

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could!  I only made small changes out of necessity - I used 2 tbl of vegetable oil in place of margarine because I didn't have any on hand.  I used fat-free cream cheese and 98% fat-free cream of chicken soup and added a splash of 1% milk at the end because it was so thick.  Served it over wheat-blend egg noodles and it was so delicious!  THANKS!

FABULOUS!!! Very tasty. Just based on personal preference I browned the chicken first, I just have something against pale chicken! I also added a lot of fresh mushrooms. I am serving this tonight over baked potatoes with snap peas on the side! I will make this often!

I made this tonight and it was delicious! The only changes I made were: I used butter instead of margarine, I used 2 FROZEN chicken breast halves and I used neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese (because it has less fat than regular cream cheese). It was SO good and I will definitely make it again. The only thing I will do differently next time is add more liquid, either in the form of chicken broth at the beginning of cooking or another can of soup at the end, as the sauce was quite thick and a tad salty so it could have used some thinning out. I may also use low sodium canned soup next time to cut down on the saltiness.

This turned into creamed chicken.  A very rich creamed chicken, but by no means did it taste like any stroganoff I've ever had.

So yummy ! The only thing that I found is that the chicken was a bit dry ( it usually drys out fast anyway). I had to cook it on high for 3 hours because of time.

Made this exactly as instructed.  My husband and 3 year old, and 10 month old all loved it. Served it over egg noodles.  We didn't find it too salty as others have stated.  Next time, I think I will add some chopped onion and fresh mushrooms when I add the soup and cream cheese, just to give the meal some different textures and enhance flavors.  I think this might be good using strips of flank steak and maybe add some tomato paste.  Endless possibilities!  Thanks for sharing!  Also, I was short on time and cooked this in my crockpot on high for 1.5 hours then reduced heat to low when adding the soup and cream cheese for the last half hour.  Chicken fully cooked and tender and meal was ready from start to finish in just 2 hours!

Very good!  I followed reviewers advice and only used a half packet of Italian dressing, but I think the author was onto something and the whole packet would be better.  It was a little too mild with only a half packet.  I made it lighter by using 98% fat free cream of chicken soup and fat free cream cheese.  It was quite good, but could use a little more spice.  It also felt very heavy, but this would be excellent for the winter or a rainy day!  Yum!!

This recipe was awesome!  I only had two chicken breasts but the chicken sauce ration came out perfect.  I added in some fresh mushrooms and onions with the chicken and it really worked.  I accidentally bought cr. of mushroom soup instead of cr. of chicken but it still tasted great.  I know some people don't like it when recipes are "tweaked" and still rated high.  This recipe deserves a 5 star cause if it had not been for the main recipe I never would have been able to make this or "tweak" it.  My man says this is a definite regular menu item! :) thanks for sharing your recipe!

For ease and flavor this deserves 5 stars. I did add quite a large splash of chicken broth. I think the sauce would have been much too thick if I hadn't. I think next time I would try it with a splash of white wine.

I did not care for this at all.  I followed the recipe to the letter and it tasted like something you would eat out of a can.  The texture of the chicken was not good either.  I was very disappointed since it had so many good ratings.

I'm giving this 4 stars, it tasted a lot like the box of "Chicken Helper". Next time I want to add some broccoli or peas or something, I'll figure it out then.

OMG! this was outstanding, I ate on this for a week, but instead of putting dry Italian dressing mix, I added dry Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix, not alot just half the package, then I also put in about a teaspoon of Worceteshire Sauch...just fantastic...will make again...

YUM...We absolutely loved this!!! I served it over mashed potatoes and added a little more chicken broth so that it didn't have such a thick consistency.  Made again and served it over rice this time...we prefer the mashed potatoes.  Will be a regular at our house!!!

I made it as directed, and the sauce was soooo thick, and the cream cheese didn't mix well.  I added at least two cups of milk to it, and it was still too thick.  On the plus side, cooking the chicken was amazing this way.  I may make a different recipe with just the chicken and some olive oil and noodles.

Awesome recipe! Very easy to make, This is a keeper. A big hit with my friends kids! (and boy are they picky). I will definitely make this again. I added a little salt and pepper at the beginning and it was still a little bland for my taste, (then again I like really really spicy dishes, and was making this with kids in mind), so making it again this weekend for my family and will add a bit more pepper and will add garlic this time too...

This was good. I followed the recipe except I accidentally put the soup in with the chicken, margarine and dressing mix. It came together fine but my husband did say he thought the gravy was a little on the rich side. Overall a tasty dish though. Easy. Thank you.

I made this as is, with the exception of using cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken soup. I thought I had it but was mistaken, hence the substitution. Served over wide egg noodles, as I do beef stroganoff. This was good, and my daughter ate it quite well. I just felt it was missing something.

My husband and I love this!  I added 1/2 cup of milk because I felt that the it was too thick.  I tried it both with and without the sour cream.  I prefer it without - I think that the sour cream is too overpowering.  But it's your own personal choice.

This was very easy and even the picky eaters in my family ate it.  I will definitely make again.  Didn't give it 5 stars because I don't think it's a stand out recipe, but just a good, easy, tasty one.  Had to double the recipe for my family of 5.

Yum, yum, & yum!  My boyfriend LOVES beef stroganoff, but I was looking for something more crockpot friendly and this was it!!! We didn't change a thing and it was delicious!  However, noodles were not listed as an ingredient so I almost forgot them.  Other than that...delish!

this was SO easy and SO good. i added one package of frozen peas during the last 45 min. to get a vegetable in there. it turned out great! it would be good with some sauteed mushrooms added at the very end, though i didn't do that. (i will next time though.) thanks for an excellent recipe.

This recipe was very good, but was super thick. I has to use quite a bit of milk to thin it out. Overall, very good!

Wow!  This was awesome.  My husband LOVED it.  I added 1/4 cup of white cooking wine with the first set of ingredients. Also, I just threw my chicken in frozen!  Other than that, I made no adjustments.  Turned out perfectly.  Served over egg noodles.  Thanks for sharing!

WOW!!!!!!!  This is so delicious and so easy!  Its the ultimate comfort food.  My family loved it and this will surely be on our dinner rotation.  I followed the recipe pretty much except I used 4 frozen boneless chicken breast & added a splash of red wine (which was all I had on hand).  I had read that others recommended this and I figured a little wine would only add to the recipe, so why not?!  I also shredded the chicken with two forks, right in the slow cooker bowl before adding the soup & cream cheese.  Served with buttermilk biscuits and a side of veggies.  Yum! Yum! Yum!

I did use the olive oil instead of butter.  I doubled the soup and used Health Request.  I also put in a large package of fresh sliced mushrooms.  Fat frree cream cheese made it perfect for my husband's srict heart healthy diet.  I served it in a baked potato one night and it was great.

This was so good!!!!! I used lowfat cream cheese and added spinach and broccoli to get some veggies in there.  Also added some white wine to the chicken in the beginning and at the end to the sauce, used a sweet white wine. It was absolutely delicious, no way you could tell there was low fat cream cheese.  So creamy, so good!!  I served on top of whole wheat egg noodles.  Will definitely make again!  5 Stars for sure!

Very easy recipe, as you can tell just by looking at it. It's a perfect comfort food for the winter, and I put it on a big bed of broad egg noodles. I did change a few things:  1) Reduced Fat cream cheese - still tasted great 2) Healthy Recipe soup - still tasted great 3) Added some spices...garlic, pepper, paprika 4) I had some massive chicken breasts, about 1 lb. each, so I only used three of them. Still, this thing lasted 5-6 meals!   I will certainly make this again when I don't have time to prepare anything big. It isn't the healthiest, but it's far from awful!

I thought this recipe was really good.  My chicken didn't take as long to cook as it says.  It was ready after about 3.5 hours.  I didn't quite have as much chicken on hand as the recipe called for though, so perhaps that was why it was done more quickly.

I made this for the first time yesterday and had it over noodles. The chicken was so tender and moist and the sauce was out of this world. Even my sister-in-law said how good it was and she does not like chicken. I will more this on my list of cooking often. Thanks for the great and easy recipe.

I didn't know whether to add water to the condensed soup, but did anyways.  Once I added the cream cheese it really thickened it.  A little too much.  Next time I think I will add either sour cream or another can of condensed soup.  Overall, really easy to make and tasted great.

Delish!  I substituted butter for the margarine and ranch seasoning packet for the italian (that's all I had).  Came out great!!  Very creamy and tasty.  I served it over couscous.  When I heated it up the next day I added a little milk and it was perfect!

Just got off the phone with my gf and had her turn the chicken breasts over while I'm at work and she said it tasted amazing. Altered the recipe a bit as advised by some other members. Used 4 chicken breasts, i can 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup, 1 can cream of chicken, 1/2 package of the italian mix, 3/4 cup milk, 1 tbsp butter and just a little (1/16 cup) water as i knew I'd be at work awhile and didn't want the chicken drying out (unlikely) or the sauce getting too thick. Can't wait to get home and try it myself but she is picky and said it was amazing. Thanks a lot

The highest compliment I receive is when my family requests a recipe. This one fit the bill. Even without changes, it was fantastic. I did make some changes, though. While slow cooking is great sometimes, other times I don't plan ahead enough to get it done. So I cook the chicken on my stove top until no longer pink, along with the butter and seasoning packet. I substitute fat free cream of chicken soup and splash in a bit of cooking sherry with the cream cheese. And I have used powdered ranch dressing if I'm out of the other. I serve on rice from my rice cooker, and my family thinks I'm a magician!! Very tasty, simple and when done on top of the stove, fast.

Great recipe.  I tried this a few months ago and even a Slow Cooker novice like myself was able to not screw this up.  I used a 1/2 pack fo the seasoning and supplemented with some other dried herbs.  I used reduced fat cream of chicken soup as well as whole wheat egg noodles.  I try to keep it healthy as much as possible to off set some of the heavier ingredients.  It's a winner!  Enjoy!

This recipe is so easy, and delicious!  My fiance asked me to make it again next week because he loved it so much!  I ended up making to much, and he brought it to work the next day.  He said it's good reheated too (which, in his book, qualifies it as the perfect dish).  I love it!

The recipe is easy and delicious, but a bit heavy for my taste even after reducing the cream cheese by half. For a lighter sauce, I would definitely follow the advice of other reviews and add 1/2 cup white wine and/or milk. I will also use much less cream cheese next time.

Great recipe if you are looking for something easy and cheap.  I used Good Seasons Dry Italian Dressing Mix and replaced the Cream of Chicken with Cream of Musroom and added mushrooms 1/2 hour before I added the soup and cream cheese.  The recipe was a big hit with everyone in my house and I would definitely recommend it.

I thought this was very good - very tasty, certainly very easy, and very filling.  You must be a lover of comfort food though because the rest of my family (NOT comfort food lovin' folk) did NOT enjoy this meal (hence the downgrade to 4 stars).  Too bad for me....'cause it sure was good - and easy!!!

It was very easy and the chicken itself had a nice flavor but the sauce was not very good.  I kept expecting all my kids to like it after reading about how much kids liked it, but no.  There was way too much cream cheese.  I would probably eliminate the cream cheese and maybe use sour cream.  Cream of mushroom would probably have tasted better than cream of chicken.  It was edible but not great.

This dish wasn't super flavorful. We served it over rice and ended up topping with chow mein noodles, cheese and pineapple for Hawaiian Haystacks (or Chinese Sundaes). It was a nice twist if you use the sauce for that.  Also, this recipe doesn't really have a "cook on high" option the chicken and sauce ends up burning to the sides.

So easy and so good.  I used frozen chicken breasts and put a can of cream of mushroom and cream of chicken in with the frozen chicken.  I cooked for three hours and then shredded the chicken, put it back in the crockpot, and then cooked for three more hours before adding the cream cheese.  I only used 4 oz of cream chese, too.

I thought this was excellent to be so simple. I made it as written except I stirred the chicken occasionally while it was cooking so that it browned evenly. I added the cream cheese and soup about 2 hours before serving just to make sure everything was melted. Served it over noodles and it was wonderful.

Awesome recipe - followed the instructions exactly- I could have gobbled up the chicken by itself after sitting in the crock pot with just the butter and the seasoning. It got 5 stars from my son. For me, it was a little too rich so next time I might use only half a package of the cream cheese instead. It will definitely have a permanent place on our menu at home!

I was short on time and forgot to throw this in the crock pot.  Works well in a casserole dish in the oven too!  Put it over left over spaghetti noodles.  Hubby and son nearly licked the plates clean!  Very tasty recipe!

Easy to make--good flavor.  I did not use an entire package of Italian dressing for 3 chicken breasts.  Three chicken breasts would easily feed 3 to 4.  Quadruple recipe for a crowd and serve with noodles, dinner rolls and a green vegetable or salad.

I'm learning that everything tastes better with cream cheese, and this recipe is no exception!  The only mistake I made was using a whole chicken.  Apparently I'm the only one who didn't know that bones don't do so well in a slow cooker....Still delicious enough to deserve 5 stars!                          ***Update*** Made this again with boneless skinless breasts and omitted. Also, both times I've made this I add all ingredients at the very beginning rather than cooking several hours and adding cream cheese at the end. Once it was completely cooked it seemed a bit runny, so I shredded the breasts and put the meat back in. This made the sauce seem a little thicker, and more flavorful. Served over rice. Only complaint - needs more salt.

Very tasty!  I would add less margarine if not take it out all together.  But overall the recipe is a keeper.  It’s a dish that is great for one of those hectic days.  I popped everything in my slow cooker and put it on low for about 7 hours.   All I had to do when I came home is make the pasta.  Thanks for a great recipe.

As is the recipes didn't work for me. Maybe its my slow cooker, but the lowest setting seems to be too high a temp for most recipes. When I got home 6 hours later the butter had burned to the bottom of the pot and the cubed chicken pieces were burnt and most of the smaller pieces were tough and over cooked. Next, when I added the cream cheese and soup, the mixture was incredibly thick and I could tell right away that I was going to have to thin it out in order to use it as a sauce. So I added white wine and water because I didn't have milk on hand. Alterations will rescue this recipe and make it usable but As-Is, this recipe fails and serves only as a base for creative cooks to make better. I am not one so I will have to search through reviews for tips. It was very tasty though once I was done with it.

So easy and delish... Used the whole packet of italian dressing mix.. Didnt add soup or cream cheese (used neufchatel) until the chicken was completely cooked (as directed)..I also pulled the chicken as someone suggested... I used 2/3 brick of cream cheese and added 1/2c of skim milk to make more of a sauce.. It was great!

I use 8oz. Italian salad dressing in place of the dry mix and butter/margarine. Cook on low for 4 hours. I mix the soup and cream cheese right in the crock pot with my hand mixer.  I cook 8 oz of egg noodles and add those in too.  This is an ABSOLUTE favorite at our house! I have also subbed sour cream for the cream of chicken soup when I found out too late I was out.  It was delicious!

This was delicious and so simple to make.  I took the advise of reviewers for my recipe - I mixed soup mix, cream soup and 1/3 cup of wine together,  Poured that mixture over chicken breasts cut into scallops.  For the last 10 minutes, I mixed in frozen peas and 1/2 block of low fat cream cheese, along with salt to taste.  My kids asked for seconds!  I served it over brown rice.  YUM!  My husband added a little hot sauce to his and raved about it.

So good! And it smelled so good while it was cooking I could hardly contain myself! All I did differently was add some onions in the last half hour...next time I will saute them before I put them in though!

This meal was a huge hit! I used 2 large chicken breasts vs. 4. The sauce was very tasty. Served over wheat egg noodles. Served the leftovers the next day over brown rice! Yum-o!

Ok, and very, very rich, we put it over biscuits rather then noodles because it was so thick.

Easy and delicious.  I used unsalted butter instead of margarine, low fat cream cheese and low sodium cream of chicken soup.  I served over Trader Joe's lemon pepper papardelle -- and I topped it all with shaved parmesan.

It smell was to die for. I was just a little disappointed with the texture. It was like the meat was pretty dry and the cream of mushroom compounded the two into a really dense substance. Maybe just add some more water to the soup. But overall it is satisfying and definitely sticks to your ribs. Thanks!

Next time I will add mushrooms and do a little less chicken to go with the pound of egg noodles I used.  Also, I had to add milk to thin the sauce.  But it really hit the spot... great flavor.

Made this for a dinner with my husband, brother-in-law, and his girlfriend... it was a hit! The recipe is super easy, seriously... I threw it together at lunch, turned on the crock pot, and when I came home from work it was almost ready (had to add soup & cream cheese). I added fresh mushrooms also. SUPER DELICIOUS! Very creamy and rich. I will cook chicken like this more often!

After reading some of the reviews, I decided to add 1/2 cup white wine to the chicken/butter/seasoning mix. I also added wedged onion with 1 hour left on the clock. This is one of my new favorite recipes! The chicken falls apart in your mouth, so tender. And the flavors and creaminess are outstanding. I served this over whole wheat egg noodles with green beans on the side. It was wonderful!

This recipe is good but not great. I followed the original recipe and found it to be too bland and a tad too salty. Everyone ate it but no one was crazy about it. I think it does have potential and will probably make it again but will add some sherry, onions and mushrooms. The chicken without the sauce was very good.

I have made this twice now. It’s great if you follow the recipe but even better with these changes:

I doubled the recipe but used the 26 oz of cream of chicken soup.
1/4 cup of white cooking wine.
1 cup of sour cream
Milk to thin to desired consistency.
Salt & Pepper to taste.
Served over Egg Noodles.

It was perfect! It’s one of our family favorites.

I set out to follow this recipe exactly but ending up modifying a little as I went along.  First, I left my chicken breasts whole.  I thought they would be more tender that way.  I used reduced fat cream cheese and 98% fat free cream of chicken soup in order to make this healthier.  I placed all ingredients in slow cooker and set on low for 5 hours.  The slow cooker then went to "warm" setting until I got home 2 hours afterwards.  I decided that I would cut up the chicken before adding the cheese and soup.  The chicken was so tender that it just fell apart.  VERY yummy!  Yes, I had to taste a pinch before adding other stuff. :-)  I added soup and cream cheese and cooked on high for about 20 minutes until it was heated through and mixed smoothly.  I used NO yolks noodles and just mixed them into the pot of chicken when they were done cooking and had been drained well.  We tasted it and decided that adding some peas would give some vegetable and natural sweetness.  It reminded me of a tuna noodle casserole when it was completed.  Anyway, it turned out delicious!  We will definitely be adding this to our meal rotation!

OK, I didn't have chicken; so I used some boneless pork chops. And I didn't have Italian dressing mix, so I used Lipton's beefy onion soup mix. I tossed the cubed meat in a ziploc with the soup mix, and put it in the crockpot with a few pats of butter, and went to Walmart. When I got home, the house smelled fantastic, and I used half of the called for cream cheese and about half a cup of sour cream, while that was warming I made a tossed salad; cooked noodles, and browned a loaf of French bread. Both myself and my husband loved this recipe--I will most certainly be making this again! It was a simple tasty meal that was perfect for todays cold New Years Day weather.

This is so yummy!  I followed the directions as stated but I only added 1/2 of the salad dressing mix knowing I could always add more later, if needed.  I also only used 2 chicken breasts and shredded them when when it was time to add the cream cheese and soup, rather than cube them.  This dinner was so easy and even my picky 4-year-old ate it up!  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and next time I will try it with fat-free cream cheese as well as the healthier soup to see how it turns out!

I couldn't give it 5 stars only because I didn't make it "as is" based on so many reviews.....in the beginning added about 1/4 cup of chicken stock with butter and mild italian dressing mix. Towards the end, I added a garlic/herb cream cheese which, I believe, kicked it up a little in the flavor dept - served with sauteed spinach and french bread -

I made this last week for the first time. My family really liked it a lot. I added some vegetables from a bag of frozen mixed blend towards the end of the cooking time. I also did not put in the cream cheese but instead added a few tablespoons of sour cream. Who would have thought that dry salad dressing mix would create such a yummy dinner!

I made this for my family last night and it was wonderful!  I just exchanged chicken breast for boneless chicken thighs.  I left everything else the same and it was yummy!  Served over egg noodles.  My 3 toddlers loved it as well.  Very easy to make.  Thank you!

This was yummy!  I put whole chicken breasts in the crockpot frozen (just defrosted a few minutes in microwave, but they were still hard), sprinkled them with the italian dressing and put a few pats of soft margarine in with them.  Once they were cooked (probably about 5 to 6 hours), I shredded them with a fork and knife.  Then added the cream cheese and soup (I used Cream of Chicken with Herbs).  I had to add some paprika, pepper and some italian herbs (was a little bland to me).  I also added about a 1/2 a can of milk to make it more like a gravy.  I served it over noodles and everybody loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

What a nice surprise!!  When I tasted chicken prior to adding soup/cream cheese, I was not impressed - it was just so/so.  Once I added everything and served over egg noodles - it was great! So easy and tasty.  Thanks for sharing!

An awesome "once in a while dish" (I think I'd get sick of it quickly) for me. A nice alternative to an alfredo sauce dish. Overall: a great dish! I made it without the slow cooker, just on the stove in roughly half an hour. The italian seasoning tastes better than I expected in the ckn soup & cream cheese mixture (put it on the chicken cooking too). ...Then place cooked noodles on plate followed by seasoned chicken cut in pieces, followed by sauce and voila! so easy and good

This was pretty good - and easy. I have to give it a 5 because the combination of seasonings is really tasty, maybe a little overpowering for my personal taste but I can always play around with that. Still deserves the 5 stars for cheap, easy and tasty, thanks for a great recipe!

YUM! This is so close to the Angel Chicken recipe, which I have been avoiding, asI do NOT like cream cheese. But I made it for a potluck at work, as I figured if I didn't like it - no harm no foul ;) and um, YUMMY! I got asked about the recipe by several people.  I actually just threw it all together to cook, it was super yummy and totally fine this way. I cooked it on high for 3.5 hours. My variations: I used Campbells cream of chicken with herb soup - as that is my favorite - I find it more flavorful than regular cream of mushroom or chicken. And I added 1 small red onion, diced (for a double batch). Otherwise the ingredients were left as is (well, doubled them). I did add about 1/2 a can of milk to it (1/2 soup can) when I started it. I also peppered the chicken. I used Angel hair pasta and mixed it in with the sauce.  It was a huge hit at the potluck, and I will DEFINITELY be making this at home again and again! YUM! And so easy! Next time I think I will add mushrooms and garlic..  I used 6 chicken breasts, cubed, for a double batch. I think you could get away with 3-4 for a double batch, too.  I have 7 children, so we look for ways to be frugal.  ***** Oh and to the people who think it is too rich, it IS rich, and also very creamy - I would equate it to a dish made with heavy cream, but I like that sort of thing - so if you don't like that, this is not your recipe. But it is YUM if you do like rich creamy foods.

The chicken was really over cooked and the sauce was way to rich and creamy it made me want to gag half way through it. Husband ate it but said he didn't want it again.

This was REALLY good. I did use 95% fat free cream of chicken soup and 1/3 less fat cream cheese. With this slimmed down fat version it was still terrific. I'd highly recommend this one.

This recipe didn't turn out as expected. I was a little disappointed because it got such great reviews. It tasted like pure cream cheese and lacked flavor. Would not make again.

I loved it, it sorta reminded me of chicken ala king growing up. I did as other reviews stated and put in the wine and it was great, fell apart as I stirred it. For sure would make again.

I have made this twice now.  The first time exactly how the recipe stated and it was awesome!  The second time I added pimentos, mushrooms and used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 cream cheese.  Either way, we LOVE this recipe!

I made this last night and it was very good. My husband loved it and even my 2 yr old ate the noodles (not a big fan of chicken), and he's really fussy about food. I'll keep this in my recipe box. Wonderful comfort food for a snowy evening! I used chicken breast tenderloins and cut them up into small pieces and I added a half can of water because the sauce seemed a little thick.

Love this recipe, make it at least three times a month. I saute up some onions, garlic and celery and add that the time I start the chicken cooking. About an hour before its done I add peas, mushrooms and carrots and serve over brown rice

Ok, I was skeptical about this one....but my goodness what a pleasant surprise!  I literally threw 4 frozen chicken breasts (whole not cubed), the butter and dressing mix in the crock pot and left the house.  When I came home, the place smelled amazing!   I used the "healthy request" soup and low fat cream cheese and it still turned out creamy and decadent!  And the chicken was so tender!!  This recipe is now on constant rotation in the house...and pleases everyone from my husband to my teenage son, to my 16-month old daughter.  If only every recipe was this easy!!!

I used 3 frozen chicken breasts, Beefy Onion soup mix, and cream of chicken & mushroom soup. I also added a can of drained corn, chives, onion, and garlic. I cooked it all on low for 5 hours. I then shredded the chicken and then I added the fat free cream cheese and let it get hot for 30 minutes. I served it over whole wheat egg noodles.

One of the best stroganoff recipes I've tried! I love that it's a slow cooker recipe. It was a little rich for our family so next time I will use lowfat cream cheese and also low fat chicken soup. I served it over thick noodles and my family loved it!

This is very very good! I put the chicken soup in at the beginning along with frozen chicken breast and butter. I only used half of the seasoning packet and 4 oz low fat cream cheese with about 1/4 cup low fat sour cream. Served over egg noodles!

Not sure what I did wrong, but this ended up far too dry.  I may try it again, as my husband liked the flavor, but I was hoping for more sauce.  Perhaps some chicken stock or white wine next time.

I cooked this as-is and thought is was good but it didn't blow me away.  I did love how easy it was and my husband wanted me to give it 4 stars.  Next time I'll probably try jazzing it up a bit.

Fantastic! Made This Recipe && Was Very Sceptical at First...&& It Turned Out Great!! One Of Our Favorites...I Did Add A Few More Seasonings At The Begining Such As Season Salt, Carling Powdre && Onion Powder And Also Before Putting Cooker On High I Added About 1/2C Milk To Thin The Sauce A Bit && cooked About 5 Cups Of Egg Noodles To Make Plenty Of Left Overs For Lunch The Next Day. My Husband Usually Doesn't Like Things Made With Cream Cheese (Picky, I Know) But He Loved This! I Will Definatly Make This Again!

This was pretty good, although a little too salty for some reason (and I didn't add an extra salt).  Nice, easy, comforting chicken.  Although it has to be made on a weekend, because the 5-6 hour cook time isn't feasible on a work day, sadly.

I made this for a dinner gathering with some friends and kids. EVERYONE (including children) loved it! I did add some chicken stock to the chicken as it cooked.  at hour 4, I also added some slices of protabella mushrooms and chopped onion, and more salt, pepper and garlic.  This is definately a recipe we will try again!

I just made this today.  I couldn't find "dry" salad dressing mix.  So I bought Kraft fat free Italian dressing.  I used probably about 1/8-1/4cup of this dressing plus liberal amounts of fresh cracked pepper.  I also added some other spices (oregano, thyme...).  I cooked it on low for 5 hours and then added the soup, low fat cream cheese and about 1.5 cups of egg noodles.  It turned out very good!  I will do this again.  I think once I re-heat it tomorrow, the flavours will have permeated throughout the chicken a bit better.

I have no idea how people are getting this to turn out bland and too thick. I served it over egg noodles and it was absolutely DELICIOUS, with just the right texture for the sauce!  I had an extra tablespoon of butter in there at the beginning because I had 2 partial bars sitting around and I wanted to use it up.    I added some onions about 2 hours in, and about 1/3 of a small sour cream container at the end with the cream cheese and soup. They were leftover from taco night.  After I added the last ingredients I let it cook for an hour instead of 30 minutes, so maybe that's why the flavor from the Italian dressing mix was able to blend into the sauce better. It was FAR from bland!

WOW. I was a bit skeptical of how this recipe would turn out, partially due to how few ingredients it had (silly me!), but I decided to try it based on the reviews.  I am SO glad I did. The italian dressing mix gives the chicken SUCH great flavor.  The only thing I did differently than the recipe states was to put the chicken breasts in the crockpot whole, then shred them before adding the cream cheese and soup. I had a hard time not eating all of the chicken while I was shredding it; it had SUCH great flavor!

Extremely easy and very yummy. I added about a 1/3 cup white wine in the begining. I also added about a cup of sour cream along with the cream cheese and soup. I will definitely be making this again.

This has become a staple in our house, and a go to meal when I need something I can just throw in the slow cooker to be ready for later.  My kids have 3rd and 4th helpings at times! I add the soup in the beginning with the other items, and then add the cream cheese about an hour before dinner and it comes out great!

Thought it was a good recipe, but I didn't have the Italian-style salad dressing mix when I went to make it, so I substituted it for Italian herbs  and some garlic, then added an extra can of soup. My boys loved it...even the fussy one!!!

This is my new favorite dish!!  My entire family absolutely raved about it and told me I should definitely make it again (& again!). As a third shift worker, slow cooker recipes are such a blessing, so I frequent this site to find new ideas often.  I am SO happy to have come acrossed this one, it is amazing!

I made this assembling as instructed, however I add some wine to the chicken and italian dressing.  About 2 hours after cooking I added some sliced mushrooms.  I was not wowed by the flavor, it was a very easy weeknight meal that I will make again, however the 4 stars is because my kids love it.  Next time I will stir in some sour cream before serving.

VERY GOOD!!  I made a smaller portion, as my husband was away.  it tasted great, the house smelled great & I can't wait to make it again.  Next time, I will experiment with diced mushrooms & finely diced onion for added flavour. Thank you!

My family really loved this recipe.  Definitely would make this again.  It was so easy and delicious.  I added some chicken broth to the pot at the beginning because I was leary about no liquids in the pot.  However, the half a can of broth left the sauce a little to liquidy.  Next time, I would just add a couple of tablespoons.  I also added mushrooms, suggested by another reviewer.  Served over egg noodles, this was a hearty meal!

Yummy! I cooked it for 5 hours then added the soup & cream cheese. Then I cooked some egg noodles and added it to the mixture. 2 of my children are very picky eaters so I left some noodles out just in case but wound up adding them because they LOVED it! My 3 year old asked for seconds...that doesn't happen very often. Thank you for the recipe!

Instead of using 8oz of cream cheese, I used 4 oz sour cream and 4oz of cream cheese. I also added 1 small onion, finely chopped.

I did not have the same experience as others. The chicken was burnt and it tasted really nasty. A waste of time! I followed the recipe exactly; I should have followed peoples reviews and put the soup in with the chicken. NASTY!

This is a really good base recipe. I only give it four stars because instead of cream cheese it really needs to be made with sour cream. I add pretty much anything extra I have to this dish and that makes it wonderful. Try mushrooms, shrimp, onion, etc.

ok first I havent made this yet and it does sound good except stroganoff is made with sour cream not cream cheese. While i am sure it is good I would try using sour cream and cream cheese for a creamer smother taste and leave out the cream of chicken soup.

I thought that this turned out tasting too bland - cream cheese can condensed soup. I did enjoy the texture ofthe chicken when cooked in this method (which doesn't sound right) it is very different than other slow cooker recipes. I would have prefered this with sour cream instead of cream cheese, more seasoning, and some fresh mushrooms. I ended up adding some tomato paste and marsala wine in addition to a whole carton of sauteed mushrooms.

This was excellent.  I seared the chicken and put it in the slow cooker with 2 cans cream of mushroom, 1/2 cup of vegetable broth, 1pkg italian seasoning, 1/2 pkg ranch seasoning and 1 pkg neufatchel cheese.  It was wonderful, and ready by the time church was over.  Thank you for posting it.

Very good and easy!  I used italian salad dressing instead of using the italian seasoning and oil.

This was very easy and really yummy.  Everyone gobbled it right up.  The only change I made was adding a splash of red wine like another member had done.

Very easy, and very creamy.  A perfect comfort food.  I served over steamed rice and it was wonderful.  Will probably add mushrooms or broccoli next time.

First cooked chicken in a little fat free italian dressing in the crockpot then used fat free cream cheese and low fat cream of mushroom soup and added some baby portabella mushrooms. Finished with a dollop of sour cream. Yummy but very rich. Served over egg noodles.

This recipe was pretty good. About half way through I added fresh mushrooms, about 1/4 cup water & 1/4 cup sour cream.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. I would make again.

This was awesome!  I cooked the chicken in 1/3 cup white wine with the seasoning & butter on high for 1 hour and then low for 2 hours.  When it was done I added 4 oz of cream cheese and let it melt, shredded the chicken and added 4 oz sour cream with the chicken soup.  Let it heat up for another hour and served over noodles!  Delicious!

This recipe as the potential to a start to something good.  The chick started to burn on low in my crock pot after a 3 hours.  The sauce was too thick for my liking and it was lacking some texture needed by the addition of some veggies.  The sauce as good flavor, but overall I thought this needed more.

I made the recipe exactly as submitted (I used the zesty Italian dressing) and my husband loved it.  I can see how you can easily adjust it to taste as several reviews indicated by adding mushroms, sour cream, wine etc.  Great slow cooker recipe to come home to!!! Update - made again using the italian dressing mix from this website and again it was just great.  Definitely a keeper!

I love when a recipe is so simple and tastes great!  I made a double batch so we would have leftovers and served with egg noodles.  My oldest son said that I needed to add this one to my file of "good" recipes.  I guess I must have one with bad ones somewhere!

This is so easy and inexpensive to make.  I'm not sure what Stroganoff is supposed to taste like, but we thought it tasted like a mild chicken alfredo.  Next time I may add some mushrooms, but it's good just the way it is.

My crockpot is large and oval shaped. The chicken, margarine and dressing mix had started to burn after 5 hours on low. It's probably best made in a regular sized crockpot. I also used Zesty Italian dressing mix - the flavor was slightly over powering. I did add about a half a soup can of water. The sauce seemed a little too thick, after adding the cream cheese and condensed soup. Overall, it was ok. If I try this again, I may double the recipe to fit my large slow cooker. I'll also stick with the regular italian dressing mix or maybe use the ranch flavor.

I didn't have any dry italian dressing mix so I used dry onion soup mix instead. It was pretty good, but if you do it this way I recommend only using half the package! Over all I was pleased

This was a quick recipe to pull together right from my cupboard and fridge. I made the following changes: I used about 1 lb. of boneless pork loin chops, ranch dressing mix (didn't have Italian today), 3/4 of a soup can of fat free half and half and 4 oz. of low fat cream cheese. I pulled the cooked meat into small pieces after 5 hours. Served over small pasta, this was terrific. I left the salt out of the pasta cooking water since the sauce tasted salty. Next time I will use canola oil instead of margarine, and garnish with a little parsley for color and a couple of twists of the pepper grinder. I will try it again with the chicken and Italian salad dressing mix. Thank you for a versatile recipe!

I fixed this chicken stroganoff this evening and it was wonderful. I absolutely loved it and so did my family.  It took me longer than 10 minutes to cube my chicken but it was well worth it.  The italian dry dressing added such a great flavor I was really surprised.  I will be sharing this with many friends and family members. Thank You!

Great dish for a cold night.  Served it for a small group of friends and everyone loved it.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Few changes, added extra garlic and a little less butter, and not so much of the italian seasoning.  Always a hit when we go to camp and easy to make.

so rich and delicious!! definitely not the healthiest thing in the world, but you don't need much to feel satisfied. i make my own salad dressing, just drizzle in some balsamic and olive oil, or add cream of mushroom soup instead sometimes, but it's always excellent.

I tested this recipe on three different families. My hubby made "yummy" sounds as he ate it. I took it to a friend, and she loved it too. We had a visiting 10-year-old for dinner, and he went home raving about it. His mom asked for the recipe. That's a winner in my book! I used left-over roasted chicken and mixed it all together on the stove-top.

DH said it was bland, but I thought it was good!  I think it could be improved on by adding some mushrooms and some liquid to thin it down some.  It is a bit salty because of the seasoning packet but I thought the overall flavor was very good!  I will make this again, and just add some mushrooms and maybe a bit more seasoning for DH!  Thanks!!

Ok, so I read all the reviews and was also nervous about not putting liquid in the pot at the beginning, but I trusted what everyone said and left it as is....came home 6 hours later to a blackened burned DRY pot of chicken chunks....cooked it on low and don't know what happened...not happy though

Very good!  I made this just as the recipe states except I added a small can of mushrooms, added a splash of white wine and substituted the cream cheese and soup for light versions.  Very, very creamy and delicious over whole wheat egg noodles!  May add a little broth next time when adding the cream cheese and soup to thin the sauce out just a touch.

I thought this recipe was fantastic! It was very easy & tasted wonderful! The only thing I did different...I put the chicken breast in the crock pot whole & let it cook, then I shredded it up before adding the other ingredients.  Will definatly make again.

I made this for sunday's dinner and my husband loved it. Just threw everything in the crock pot for 5-6 hours and I added a little sour cream about 3 Tbsps to thinned it out.  Served it over egg noodles. Delish!

This stroganoff is pretty amazing. No, its nothing fancy, but its great for a those nights when you don't have time to cook anything. My family has eaten this several times and its much better than any old Hamburger Helper stroganoff.

This is pretty good, but I have to agree on the saltiness of the dish. Next time I will use low sodium condensed soup, and if they make a low sodium dressing mix that would be good too. I added 1/2 c of white wine and about 1 can of water. threw some carrots in too. Toward the end I mixed in low fat cream cheese, couple handfuls of frozen peas for color, and couple of dashes of cracked black pepper. My family ate it over rice because I didn't have egg noodles on hand. We enjoyed it.

This was really good!  It was so easy to make.  As for the reviewers who said their chicken was dry and burnt, it was probably  your slow cooker.  I have the Hamilton Beach slow cooker with the sealed top and not one ounce of the margerine (I used Smart Balance) evaporated.  Also, the sauce was not too thick.  It was thicker, but not as thick as others suggested (again maybe their slow cooker).  It tasted salty, but when it was served over pasta it tasted just right, not too salty.  I shredded my chicken when I added the cream cheese and let the cream cheese sit for 15 minutes before stirring it in.  I followed recipe exactly and I was very pleased.  My husband, mother, and two toddler daughters liked it.  My father loved it.  I kept dipping in for more.  Very easy recipe.

Thankfully, this recipe is very forgiving because I completely jacked it up. For starters, I forgot to add the Italian dressing mix in the beginning, so when I walked in from work and saw it sitting on the counter, I thought, I'll just put it in now. Then added the rest of the ingredients and some sour cream (suggestion from another reviewer). As soon as I did it, I was sorry because it smelled like Sour Cream and Onion potato chips. Still having the slightest bit of home, I let it cook for another 1/12 hour while attending a school function. When we came home, my husband and daughter said they liked it, but I just couldn't get past the smell, even though it was gone. I served it to them over whole wheat noodles, they really liked it. My daughter ate three bowls! I finally tried it and it was good, however, the smell was haunting me. Husband wants me to cook it again and add mushrooms and peas.

This was sensational! I, too, cooked it for about 7 hours because i just didnt have time. I added mushrooms and onions in the begining, which i think was a great addition. My boyfriend said this is his new favorite dish (good thing i didnt tell him i used fat free everything!)

This recipe is a keeper! My husband and I really enjoyed this. Did not have time to defrost the chicken so I put them in the crockpot frozen. When they were done I took them out to cut into pieces and the chicken just kind of fell apart but it was still delicious. Thanks!

My boyfriend (the picky one) loved it. I liked it as well but think next time i wont add the whole package of italian dressing. its good just tastes like ALOT of seasoning. Also we did it over mashed potatoes kinda like a poor mans stroganoff because hes not big on noodle dishes. but over all pretty darn good! Also its not really a stroganoff flavor at all but its still good.

This recipe received high praises from the family. Super simple to make. Added can of Mushrooms and served over Egg Noodles. The Italian salad seasoning wasn't overpowering as some had stated and the Cream Cheese made for a lovely sauce. Will be making this again. Thanks

This was pretty good, but I used fat-free soups and fat free cream cheese and I think that took away a lot of the flavor. Next time I will use regular ingredients...I think it will make a big difference.

Yummy!  This is really easy.  I added portabella mushrooms 3 hours into cooking and a little more butter.  I also used onion soup mix instead of the italian dressing.  Will make again.

This recipe was outstanding.  I did use dry ranch dressing instead of italian, only because it's what I had in the kitchen.  I also added a can of mushrooms.  The chicken was tender, and the sauce was supurb!!! A+++

This is yummy and creamy...  A big hit at the dinner table and makes for fantastic leftovers!  (There's only 2 of us, so we couldn't manage to eat ALL of it in one sitting -- not for lack of trying!)

I thought it was good and super easy ... but a little salty in my opinion.  I might try different seasoning and/or soups next time and see what I can come up with?

My family still loves this recipe after making it for a few years....I don't change it except I use thin cuts and I throw them in whole and shred with a fork before serving or when I add the last two ingredients.
  It is the easiest meal ever and it is a perfect comfort food for my family

Used Butter instead of margarine, added a couple cloves of garlic and sliced an onion. So good. Very comforting. Served with egg noodles and broccoli. Thanks!

This was delicious!  Served with asparagus and peas.  Sauce did thicken upon standing quite a bit.  Next time I might try to add some milK to the sauce to thin it out.

This has become one of our most favourite dishes. Easy to make and utterly delicious! Even after modifying the recipe by using half the butter, adding mushrooms and broccoli, using fat-free soup and cream cheese serving over wheat or zucchini noodles. Who said healthy can't taste great!

I thought this had a really good flavor and nice texture.  I only used two large chicken breasts and had plenty of sauce.  I followed another reviewer's advice and did simmer the cubed chicken with just the butter and seasoning packet, and it got nice and brown like she said.  I then added a package of fresh sliced mushrooms and let that simmer for about 30 minutes before adding the soup and cheese.  I'm only giving this 4 stars because I thought it was a bit too salty.  Maybe next time I'll try half the italian dressing packet like others did.

good and easy recipe.  i had leftover chicken so just diced that and added it to the soup/dressing mixture.  i just nuked that in the microwave and put it over some egg noodles.  i was worried the italian dressing might not have a chance to meld it's flavor, but it tasted just fine.  very creamy.  i gave it four stars just because it didnt really wow me.   thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was ok. I'll give it 4 stars based on the hope that some other reviewers suggestions might hold true. My problem with the original is it was just to cream cheesy and the sauce was a little too thick. Next time I will try reducing the cream cheese to maybe 4-6 oz and adding either red wine or broth as others have suggested.

This was a really good recipe. I enjoyed the food, although was a little sad that there were no leftovers to munch on later. Definitely plan to try it again, although with a larger amount.

I too made the changes the reviewers said and added only half the packet of Italian dressing but that's only because I don't like my food salty. I also added 1/2 cup milk with cream cheese to make more creamer. Very Good recipe. Thanks

This was really easy and really tasty...an excellent combination! :) I put the breasts in frozen, with the butter and italian dressing packet. Later added the healthy version of the soup and the cream cheese. The 'gravy' seemed to dry out/thicken up pretty quickly, so I added some chicken broth, but that made it pretty salty. Perhaps next time I'll add an extra can of the soup, or do as others suggested and add some wine as there was barely enough sauce...and lots of gravy is always good! :)  I served it over egg noodles. It was a big hit! :)

This was delicious- I was very impressed! Hubby & the whole family loved it, & they are already requesting it again!  Loved the kick that italian dressing gave it!  I doubled the recipe & cooked all day- for 8 hours on low.  Towards the end, I added an extra can cream of chicken, & only 1 1/2 packs cream cheese. This turned out perfect- thanks so much- will make again & again!!

Echoing someone else's review here, this was also my first slow cooker recipe! Purchased my crock pot, and then two hours later this recipe was in it, ready to go. I used chicken thighs instead of breast and the chicken was so tender and shredded, it was almost like eating tuna casserole (but not as processed). Mm!

I screwed it up and it was still amazing. I didn't wait to put in the cream of chicken soup (I put it in at the beginning) and added a little black pepper in at the end & some cooked whole wheat egg noodles. It was so good! Wouldn't change a thing!

My husband LOVES this dish. I'm just not a fan of the consistency, which is a tad on the mushy side. The first time I made it, I didn't chunk the chicken, just put it in whole and then shredded before adding the cream cheese. This made the dish a bit too thick. Recommend keeping the chicken in chunks as much as possible. Also recommend throwing in some peas for color. Otherwise, it's a pretty bland-looking meal, especially over egg noodles, which is how I usually serve it.

Loved it.  I followed the recipe as is except I cooked the chicken with the cream of chicken soup.  I was gone at work all day and had to let it cook for 9 hours and was afraid it might burn otherwise.  It was so great even after cooking for longer than recommended, it was not dry.  I cooked up some egg noodles and served it up.  Boyfriend approved even though it was chicken and not beef!

I make this almost ever week although my husband would eat it every night if I let him!  I follow the recipe exactly and serve it over brown rice.  It is super easy, and really good.

I personally found this recipe full of salt and fat ,i added white wine as well for more flavour but probably would not cook this one again, we do a similar pasta in taste that is real quick ,cube and cook chicken with garlic , rosemary and pepper and add one bag of ready made alfredo sauce and one bag of ready made pesto sauce and serve over penne or rotini pasta,red peppers or mushrooms can be added as well, a perfect 10 minute dinner for a family that has kids in multiple sports most nights of the week

Okay, I must be weird because I am the only reviewer who did not care for this meal. It is extremely salty and the chicken had lost all of its texture. In fact, you could hardly tell it was chicken and it could have literally passed for Tuna Helper. One reviewer suggested using sour cream rather than cream cheese and only half of the dressing mix. If you're going to make this dish, I definitely recommend following her advice.

Loved the flavor!  I stuck to the recipe and it was delicious!  Although, I ended up adding a bit of chicken stock near the end because it was so thick and started to burn.  Served over egg noodles.

This got mixed reviews at the dinner table.  My two kids who usually eat everything barely touched it, but my son and niece who are very picky finished theirs off.  I followed the instructions exactly and found it to be filling but a bit boring and bland.  Had plenty for leftovers, but am not excited about having it again.  If doing anything differently, I'd definitely serve with rice and maybe have something to top it off to add some color and flavor.

I have made this a few times. I only use 1/3 of the Italian dressing mix and add 1/2 cup white wine and lots of sliced fresh mushrooms. It is our favorite slow cooker recipe by far!

My family and I LOVED the sauce in this recipe, but were not thrilled with the texture of the chicken (a bit grainy/mushy).  To the best of my knowledge, the chicken was fresh; however, I am new to using the slow-cooker, so maybe this is how chicken turns out when it's been cooked slowly all day.  I found myself picking out the pieces of chicken and eating just the sauce with the egg noodles that I served it with.  I'm going to try this tomorrow with beef stew meat in place of the chicken.

This was so yummy and creamy.  I grew up eating stroganoff that my mom made with red meat (that I always picked out, I don't like beef) and sour cream.  I love the cream cheese though.  It was such creamy goodness!  Its definately going into my rotation of recipes, thank you for sharing!

Excellent!  My family loved this recipe and my kids are picky, picky at times.  I did add 1/8 c water and a bit more butter. I also choose the 1/3 fat cream cheese and it was quite good. I happened to be home so I flipped the chicken half way through the 6 hr cook time.  It's more of 'roasted chicken' after cooking, which is why some folks said it was dry.  However, after adding the soup, etc. I found the chicken quite tasty and not dry at all.  Served it over egg noodles with a large green salad.  Will definitely make again!

I didn't add anything extra and it was pretty easy to make.  Fire and forget crock pot recipes are the best on a workday.  BUT, I thought it was way to salty (and I'm the one who usually adds salt to everything), but the rest of the family thought it was delicious, so I guess it's in the rotation.

Delicious! I changed a few things to suit my tastes, as everyone does. I did cook the chicken on low for a few hours with just the butter and half the package of seasoning. Then added a can of chicken soup and mushroom soup and half a cup of beef broth. Then I let it cook on high for an hour or so. I sauteed some onions and mushrooms and added those a little while before the cream cheese. I put in only 4oz of the cream cheese and 1/3 cup of sour cream and let it heat through. I was surprised at how good it was! We had no leftovers, and I will definetly make it again soon.

Wow!! This is pretty good. I'm giving it four stars because it needed a bit of salt for my taste. I don't care what kind of "fat free" ingredients you substitute in this recipe, it is still not going to be healthy...so....I would eat this only occastionally. It is super rich, creamy and fattening, but yummy :)

Very good. My husband is a picky eater but he totally loved this. I thought it was too salty so next time I'll use low sodium soup. I cooked it exactly how the recipe says. The chicken is so tender and the smell is awsome. It made me hungry all day smelling it. Ty  for the recipe

OMG, this is SO good! First time I used chicken breasts, mine turned out dry so this next time I used 4 chicken thigh/legs quarters. I put about a 1/8 cup of water with the chicken. The meat was so tender it fell off the bone. I took chicken out and cut up meat, put sauce ingredients into cooker, along with cut up chicken and it was awsome and juicy. Even the leftovers were awsome. I doubled the sauce 2nd time cuz I like a lot of sauce.

Delicious.  I used low fat cream cheese and added just a tad bit of milk to thin the sauce.  Served over egg noodles.

I loved this recipe!  It was so easy!  I put 4 whole chicken breasts in frozen and then shredded it when I got home after work.  It was great as left-overs too!

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and one of his friends.  They both loved it, as did I.  It was very easy and had a nice flavor to it.  I will definitely be making this many more times!

My family of four loves this dish and I love that it is so easy to make.  We usually serve it over rice  because that is how my husband grew up eating stroganoff.

This one is really good. My family loves it. The only change I do is add french onion soup because I can't find the Italian dressing. Yummy!

I didn't have 5-6 hours, so I sauteed the chicken until nearly cooked, threw in the butter and Italian dressing packet, and simmered for about 20 minutes. Then I added the rest of the ingredients and simmered for another 30 minutes. The cream cheese made it seriously decadent and on the heavy side. But the result was really good stroganoff!

I'm giving this a four, because I thought it was a three, but my husband, grandma and kids gave it a 5!  It's super simple tasting, but filling and hearty.  I doubled the recipe (to have ample leftovers to freeze) and used 1.5 blocks of cream cheese, one cream of chicken and one cream of celery soups.  Threw in fresh sliced mushrooms once the soups and cream cheese were all blended.  Served with some green beans and french bread and it was a huge hit (I just didn't personally think it was outstanding).

I doubled the recipe, adding 1/2 cup of cooking sherry with the butter, dressing mix (two packages) and cubed, thawed chicken.  The consistency of the sauce was absolutely perfect and not at all salty!  I used Healthy Request soup, 1/3 reduced fat free cream cheese and added 1/2 pint of sour cream and sliced mushrooms.  Next time I will try fat free cream cheese, as reviews indicate that flavor is not compromised.  My parents and father-in-law came for dinner and went on and on about the meal.  I served with whole wheat egg noodles, fresh bread and a salad. So simple to throw together and delicious too!  This recipe will become a regular in our home.

WOW!  This is awesome!  My hubby went back for seconds AND ate leftovers!  I added some chicken broth seasoning to give it a tad more flavor.  Also only used two chicken breasts, butterflied and then cubed.

This is very good, but very rich.  I use 1/3 less fat cream cheese to cut back on the richness.

Very good and simple to make. I add sliced mushrooms and white wine, and I wait to cut the chicken until I add in the cream cheese and soup. I like it over egg noodles.

This is so simple, and so tasty that everyone thinks I'm a great cook! I add whole frozen chicken breasts to the crockpot, and after several hours of cooking take them out and they shred nicely. Then mix everything in together to cook a little while longer.

Delicious and very easy! Made it exactly from the recipe, and it was a bit thick, so will probably add some sour cream or milk or both at the end the next time. I'll definitely make this again.

This was extremely good!  I was also skeptical about cooking the chicken with only butter and the dry italian seasoning for so long at the beginning of the recipe.. but since I read the reviews first I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect!  The only think different I did was add only a tablespoon of sourcream and a little dash of milk to make it a little more creamy because the finished product seemed a little thick.  We really enjoyed it and the leftovers didn't last long...  Thanks for such a great recipe!

We weren't the biggest fans of this.  I did use the whole packet of Italian dressing and I'm glad that I did because I think it would have been very bland without it.  It was fine, just not probably something that I'd make again.  I think it's simply one of those things that didn't suit our tastes very well.

Not really what I would consider a stroganoff, but a decent dish.  It was too salty for my taste, and even trying to dull the saltiness with sour cream and milk didn't really help.  Maybe next time I would follow previous reviewers advice and use half of a packet of the dressing mix.

I only used half the recommended cream cheese and than 4 0z of sour cream at the end.  (Sorry!  I hate it when people change the recipe).  I also used reduced fat cream cheese and sour cream.  I liked it and so did the fam.  The chicken was very tender and really tasty.  It would be good even without the sauce.  I did not cook the chicken as recommended, however, because it would have dried out and burned!  I had it on low for only a couple of hours and it was almost done, so I turned it to warm for another two hours.  Easy recipe with easy ingredients.

This was really yummy.  I used half the packet of italian dressing powder and added a half cup of milk at the end.  I had put the chicken in frozen solid and it cooked perfectly.  I shredded the chicken before serving to get more mileage out of it.  Thanks very much for a great recipe!

Used Spicy Italian packet. Chicken may be a little too salty.  Added mushrooms and celery.

I had 3/4 can of evaporated milk left over from making carmel nut brownies.  This recipe looked good.  I made it with a few changes due to what I had on hand.  I used french onion dip packet with about 8 chicken breasts.  I used 2 tbps butter and the evaporated milk with the low fat cream cheese and chicken flavored soup and added sliced fresh mushrooms.  It was super!  The grown ups in our house loved it.  The kids ate the chicken and that was all.  I usually make the Easy Chicken from this site, but I think we like this one better.  The chicken was able to be cut up in bites not shreaded since it was not soaking in liquid while cooking.  That seems to work better for the kids.

I have made this twice, it is wonderful comfort food.  I made it exactly as written and added fresh mushrooms-let cook for 15 more minutes. Easy and delicious.

My family loved this recipe. The chicken cooks up nicely in the crockpot and the aroma is wonderful. The finished product reminds us a little more of an alfredo type sauce, but we are definitely not complaining. Great Recipe!

I LOVE this recipe!! I've made it a few times and the only changes that I have made is to add some garlic, a couple spoonfuls of sour cream, and a little milk to thin out the sauce. I also use cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. Wonderful!

I followed the recipe and it was perfect!  Even my super picky daughter asked for seconds!! (I was home to stir periodically though! I think if I was not I would follow the suggestions of the others i.e. add more liquid from the start.) I used a wooden spoon toward the end to shred up the chicken a little bit and served over noodles. Will make again and again!

I ended up liking this recipe, but I'm only giving it a 3 because I had to doctor it up to get it to my liking.  It was pretty bland as the recipe is written.  I added a lot of onion powder and garlic powder, which really helped. When I had the leftovers the next day, I added nutmeg which I think was really good.  I will make again, but I'd like to try replacing 1/2 the cream cheese with sour cream.

The chicken and the sauce had a really great flavor but the sauce was way too thick, I almost couldn't eat it. If I can thin out the sauce just a bit, I would make this dish again.

My family found the sauce too rich, and I had already cut the amount of cream cheese in half and added some chicken broth to the mix.  We felt this recipe was ok, but not great, and won't be making it again.  I know that lots of people rave over this meal but, if you don't like rich sauces, you may want to alter it or give it a pass.

I love how this came out. I used italian seasoning instead of a dressing mix and added fettucine to the mix at the end. Oh and a ton of garlic because I love it. I thing I didn't need to do was cook the chicken for 5-6 hours, I peeked at it around 4 hours and the chicken was completely done. I will definitely be making this again!

DELICIOUS!  I didn't have a package of dry Italian-style salad dressing mix so I found a recipe for "Italian Herb Salad Dressing mix Clone" at www.recipezaar.com  Slightly modifying (decreasing) that recipe, I used 1 tsp. oregano, basil, paprika and freshly ground black pepper, 1/2 tsp. onion powder, 1 TBS garlic powder, and two packets of granulated sugar and added that to the chicken in this recipe in lieu of the Italian dressing mix.  The recipe was not salty and didn't need anymore garlic as others noted.  I used Campbell's 98% fat free cream of chicken soup and I only had a 1/2 brick of cream cheese (again, that's what I had on hand) but it worked great.  I first kept the chicken cubed but shredded it later; I definitely recommend shredding the chicken.  Since I used only 1/2 brick of cream cheese, you should probably add milk or sour cream to thin it out but it still tastes GREAT as is...this is a definite keeper!

A super comfort dish for a frigid day! I started with boneless chicken thighs, the seasoning and only 1 tablespoon of butter, along with a couple of glugs of white wine. After a few hours, the chicken browned nicely. Later on, I added some sliced onions; mushrooms would be fantastic in this, but I have a very fussy husband. About an hour before dinner, I added the low-fat soup and low-fat cream cheese. Served over whole wheat pasta, it was scrumptious.

This was a huge hit with the family.  The only change I made was to throw 8 oz of sliced fresh mushrooms into it along with the soups/etc. 30 minutes before it was done.  Served over egg noodles, there was nothing left at the end of the night.  Definitely will make this again!

Hmmm... Mine shredded into a very odd chicken-paste.  I gave it 4 stars because the TASTE is very good, and the recipe is so fast/easy.  I would like to give this one another chance -- maybe try cooking on high for a shorter period of time so the chicken won't shred as much (???)  The other thing is, I definitely would not call this a stroganoff... If you're looking for a chicken dish with the classic beef strog taste, this is not the one.  But, again, very good flavor :)

I thought this was pretty good...not as good as I may have hoped, though.  I started with frozen chicken breasts, and they easily shredded after 6 hours on low.  I did slice up a yellow onion and put that in the Crock Pot with the chicken in the beginning, but it was barely noticible in the final dish.  I know some reviewers had complained that the sauce was too rich and thick...before adding the soup, I drained off the liquid in the pot, and then thinned the sauce with chicken stock...that seemed to work.  I guess I was mainly disappointed by the lack of texture in this dish...the shredded chicken, sauce and noodles all seemed to meld into one.  I did add some peas, but next time I'm definately going to add more veggies to the sauce to mix things up a bit.

This was very tasty and filling. Of course, I can never make a recipe as is, so I did tweak it a little, partially to due to necessity, and part due to personal preferences.

I made this using a pack of chicken drumsticks since its what I had on hand. I doubled the soup and used the whole packet of the Italian seasoning (other reviewers suggest using only half for the normal portioned recipe) since I had a little more chicken than what the breasts would have provided. I kept the butter and cream cheese the same though.

 I let the margarine melt in the crock on high, and added I some leftover chopped onion, a clove of chopped garlic and a pack of sliced mushrooms (whats a stroganoff without some FRESH mushrooms!) and let them get a little softened, then added the chicken. 

Since I wasn't sure it if would work the same for drumsticks as chicken breast, I added the soup in with the drumsticks and added a little bit of milk and white wine. Cooked it on low until the chicken could be shredded off the drumsticks, removed the leftover bones, and cooked a little longer.  Then I added the cream cheese and about a quarter cup of sour cream.  

I also mixed in a few dashes of worcestershire, since my favorite beef stroganoff recipes uses for it, and I love the tangy flavor. 

There were minimal complaints on it from my picky eater kids; my 5 year old just wasn't fond of the mushrooms I added. 

I served it over bow-tie pasta.  It was very delish.  Only complaint is that my cream chees

I was disappointed... even with the addition of extra milk as others had suggested this still was way too thick of a sauce for us, I might try it again with a ton more milk as the chicken had a great flavor.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  Like other reviewers, I put the chicken in the crock pot frozen to save on time and the smell was amazing while cooking!  When it was time to add the other ingredients, the chicken began to shred and would not stay cubed.  The taste was great and the texture was not too bad even with the shredded chicken.

I don't eat red meat but sometimes crave the dishes from my childhood which had it, like beef stroganoff.  This is a perfect substitute.  And soooooo easy to make.

I thought this was really good. I did mess up and accidentally used a creamy Ranch dressing packet instead of the onein the recipe but I think it still turned out really tasty. It reminded me a bit of the tetrazini (sp) the cooks used to make from scratch at the country elementary school I went to as a kid back in the stone age. I added cooked noodles to this, about a pound of spaghetti, and hubby yummed it up. Thanks for sharing! My picky children wouldn't eat it, but my 9 year old did eat the chicken chunks and said they were delicious! High praise.

Tripled the recipe AS IS and it was very good....smelled FABULOUS while cooking all day! Everyone was drooling over my crock pot :) Nothing too spectacular about it but it is a wonderful 'base' recipe and super super easy to put together. I would for sure make this recipe again!

I made this for dinner a few nights ago and I thought it was pretty good, but my husband loved it. We had it again the next day and tasted better with some pepper flakes sprinkled on. I followed the recipe exactly except I only used two chicken breast. This recipes makes more than 4 servings.

This is just okay. It's easy to make, and dosent taste awful, it's just kind of bland after the first 2 bites.  My husband who usually eats my left-overs the next day passed on this. I asked him what he thought of it, and he said it was just okay. When asked if he wanted me to make it again, he said no. I rated it a 4 because it's the kind of recipe some people will love, but picky eaters probably won't like it.

The way I made this way way too thick( even though I love the thickness of Alfredo, after refrigeration it was almost solid) and bland. My husband who always loves and brags about my cooking hated it. If I try again, I would sub half the cream cheese with sour cream. Also I put 3/4 of my zesty Italian mix, because a lot of the other reviews said that it was too salty and strong. That was a bad idea because it ended up tasting like only a bowl of cream cheese. The chicken came out really soft though. Other than omitting a little of the Italian, I think it would still be pretty tasteless with all of it. Something else would need to be added. Pretty bad recipe, threw it away - what a waste of time and ingredients.

This is wonderful!  I was skeptical at first since I have never had stroganoff with cream cheese but it was great!  I used fat free cream of chicken soup and fat free cream cheese and the flavor was wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good, but I think it'd be even better if I add some more spices and salt next time. I followed the recipe, except I did add about 1/4 of a cup of white wine to the soup mixture. The chicken did brown nicely. I used lower sodium cream of chicken soup and maybe that was part of the problem with it being a touch bland. It was very easy and I will try again with some more salt and spices!

I followed the recipe, EXACTLY.  I, too, was concerned about the lack of liquid in the chicken.  It was not a problem at all.  The end result was a little dry and my chicken was definately overcooked.  Maybe I made my cubes too small?  Overall it had a wonderful taste and this is something I will make again and again.  I will adjust the cooking time next time.

my hubby thought this tasted great! i didn't have any cream cheese so i substituted with sour cream. it changed up the flavor a bit from the usual slow cooker dishes i have made in the past that use cream of whatever soup. the chicken was so soft and is an overall tasty recipe.

It is very good, but needs a little more flavor.  Next time I'll add some garlic.  I mixed it in with egg noddles and it made a harty dinner for two with plenty of leftovers.

I have made this meal several times now and it's always a hit. I do make changes I added a chopped onion a table spoon of garlic, white wine, and I don't like using the powder salad dressing so I used bottled and it helps keep it moist. It turns out great.

This is some good, easy, cheap comfort food!  My very picky 7 year old that won't eat anything but chicken nuggets and mac-n-cheese even ate it w/o complaint.  I'll be making this again and adding this to the regular rotation per my 7 year olds request.  For my husband and myself it was a very tasty, but a little on the bland side, we loaded it up w/ fresh cracked pepper.

This is delicious!  I took some others' advice and added a splash of wine at the beginning just so the chicken wasn't dry, but otherwise I stuck to the recipe minus a little sprinkle of cayenne pepper at the end.  When you wait to add the soup at the end, the chicken roasts up and gets all brown in the crock pot - YUM.  I didn't shred the chicken like some suggested, but I will next time so that it all cooks up in the sauce.  So good!

I made in with chicken tenders, on high in the crock pot for about 3 hours.  It turned out great!  My teen son ate a bowl of it before I could finish cooking noodles to go with it.

This recipe was great. I changed just a few things.  Used a splash of white cookig wine in the crock at the beginning.  Added a bit of sour cream to the mix for flavor and a can of mushrooms.  Very easy to make.  Served over wheat pasta.

This was such a simple easy recipe with fantastic taste.  I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of adding a couple generous spoonsful of sour cream.  My hubby and mom (who was visiting) agreed it was a "keeper" recipe.

I love this dish! The reason I rated it a 4 is because I had to alter it a bit. Maybe my crock-pot cooks fast, but I add the soup, butter, dry italian dressing, the chicken, and a can of water first so the chicken doesn't dry out. Then I add the cream cheese like the recipe says.

Yummo!  The change I made (due to time constraints) was to combine all ingredients in the crock pot (plus a splash of wine to thin the sauce as it appeared very very thick) - cooked on low for 5 hours, served over egg noodles and...PERFECTION!

Thanks!

Made last night; used the recipe as is, except I used healthy choice cream of chicken soup (that's what I buy). Delicious flavor. My husband and even a picky 4-year-old loved it. It's rich but if made occasionally, it's a great sunday dinner dish. It's pretty salty so if you don't like salty food, use only half of the seasoning packet. Will make it again for sure.

I made this today as we had a new pastor installation ceremony to go to at church this afternoon and I wanted something I knew would be ready when we got home. I served it with  instant mashed potatoes because we were really late and didn't have time to make noodles. It was fantastic. Next time I'll go with the low-fat version of the soup and cream cheese because it is very high in fat content, but this time I just used what I already had on hand and that was the full fat stuff. Thanks for a great recipe. It was super easy and we'll definitely be having this again. 
UP-DATE:
It's been nearly three years since the first time I made this the first time and to tell the truth I simply forgot about it until a friend suggested a sismilar recipe. So, I'm making it agian only this time I added a can of low fat cream of celery and about 1/3 cup of  bottled Italian dressing since I'm out of the dry mix. I also added about 2 & 1/2 cups of frozen mixed vegetables to the crock-pot, skipped the butter and added the cream of chicken soup. Just before I serve it I'll add in the cream cheese and serve with noodles or maybe over biscuits. I'll up-date with the results.

I changed the recipe a bit. I used one can cream of chicken, one can cream of mushroom (both 98% fat free), thinned it with 3/4 cup College Inn Culinary Broth (white wine & herb) and added the dressing packet.  Put it all in the crock pot with 6 whole chicken breasts.  Let is slow cook on low for 4 hours, shredded the chicken, added 1 1/2 cups frozen sweet peas, cream cheese and slow cooked another hour, finished it off with two big dollops of sour cream.  Served over noodles...what a hit, family loved it!!

This was super easy to make and delicious! We put it over noodles. My husband said he would eat it at least once a week. If you are making it for 2, definitely cut the other ingredients in half. I read a few reviews that said they cut the chicken in half and left the sauce the same. It was a little too much sauce for me. We will definitely make this again!

I made this the other night, so when it showed up as "Recipe of the Day" I had to chime in.

Liked it, didn't love it.  Surprised that the white meat chicken wasn't overly dry in the end product, like slow-cooker white meat often is.  But, in the end, it tasted like a glorified chicken version of tuna casserole (served it over noodles).  Good starter recipe, but I'd definitely play with it to go beyond the 1950s feel.  My kids liked it, but in the end the adult rating was:  it was decent, but worth the calories...???

(As always, used lower fat versions of cream cheese, etc.  I have yet to see where that made a huge difference, unless using no fat in baking...)

I just didn't like this recipe very much. The cream cheese was just a bit much. I ended up adding some sour cream, and it did help. I won't be making this again.

This was simple to make and very good! I had more chicken than the recipe called for, so I added a second can of soup and put it, a little butter, and the italian seasoning in with the chicken.  I cooked it on high for about 4 hours, then added neufchatel cheese and a few spoonfuls of sour cream and let it cook a half hour longer.  I served it with stuffing (boxed, not homemade) and a french baguette.  My husband enjoyed it a lot.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is delicious!  I was a bit hesitant when it said not to add water or some kind of moisture - just the chicken, butter, and seasonings.  But I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out delicious.  It is now one of our favorite dinners, and I love it because it is sooooo easy to make.
Thank you so much for such a great recipe!

This was very good and I only changed it a little bit. First I used partially frozen chicken (cubed). I also used butter instead of margarine. After about 5 hrs of cooking, I added the soup and about 6oz of cream cheese. It seemed too think so I added some milk until it was the right consistance. After reading other reviews, I served it over rice instead of egg noodles. VERY good. Will make again !

This was pretty good.  I did make a couple changes because of what I had on hand.  I used butter instead of margarine, and cream of celery soup because I didn't have cream of chicken.  The chicken was a bit dry following the recipe as written (maybe the was because the butter doesn't have as much water as margarine?) But, I'll probably try this one again, but I'll put the chicken in with the soup and a little chicken broth.  My sauce was a bit thick too - but maybe it just cooked a little too long.  I tried to thin it out with some milk.  It wasn't bad, and I will try this one again.

Definitely a keeper!  I left the chicken whole and shredded it right before adding the soup and cream cheese.  It was a bit thick, but adding a little bit of sour cream seemed to help.

Loved it.  The 1st time it was a little bland. I used 2 packages of dry Italian dressing mix and that made all the difference.  I serve it over rice. It's a keeper.

Disappointed in the end result.  Rather bland, too salty.  Won't make again

This was a very quick, easy and delicious meal. I actually made it on the stovetop instead of the crockpot. I served it over egg noodles.

This was simply awesome!I've made it several times and everyone (including my very picky 10 year old son)just loves it! I did add some milk about 15 min. before serving just to thin the sauce a bit.This is a 10 on the Yum-meter!

Very easy and very good!  I did add some white wine, a can of mushrooms (drained).  I also sliced the chicken in strips based on the other reviews.  Plus added some frozen peas toward the end and served over egg noodles!  It was a big hit with my family and even my picky 2 yr. old!

Seriously LOVED this. I actually cooked the cream cheese in with it for 2 hours. It turned out great. I put the seasoning directly on the chicken then the soup on top and cooked like that for 4 hours.

This is great!  My husband loves this dish and wants it regularly.  And it's so easy.  I added diced onions to the crock pot with the chicken and let them cook together.  I also use low fat soup and cream cheese and it's delicious.

This recipe was awesome! The family loved it.  They are asking me to make it again already.  The only thing I changed was adding 8oz of fresh mushrooms and half of a chopped onion when putting the chicken and dressing mix in.  I did add a splash of water as I was concerned about there not being enough moisture.  However, with the little water and mushrooms, it was fine.

This is delicious! Loved the sauce! I used reduced fat cream cheese and 98% fat free cream of chicken soup and it was still fabulous. My only change would be to cook the chicken less. Four hours on low would probably be plenty. Mine turned out a little dry, but only because I feel it was cooked too long. I served over whole wheat extra wide noodles. This will be one of our staples now!

This recipe was very good! It was very easy to make. However, I was the only one who liked it in my family. Goodness help me, I have some picky eaters!
The chicken smelt fantastic when I got home from work!
I served it over egg noodles and am looking forward to leftovers today!

My whole family enjoyed this meal; my 5 year old gave it 2 thumbs up!  I did make a few changes, some on error :) and some based on what I had.  My finace bought onion soup mix instead of the dressing mix but it added a nice flavor.  Prob wont even try with the dressing mix as we liked it as is.  I also used boneless pork chops because I didn't have any chicken but wanted to try this recipe.  Like others I added about 1/4 cup chicken stock with the meat and butter.  I also added a few heaping spoonfulls of sour cream and a few splashes of milk when I added the cream cheese.  I will deff be making this meal again.  I'm going to try it with chicken next time.

This recipe is a new family favorite.  My husband and two kids (3 & 5 y.o.) ate this up.  I made the recipe with the exact ingredients called for.  The only change I made, to ease the initial preparation, was to put the chicken breasts in whole and let them cook 6 hours.  Then, when I add the cream cheese and soup I shred the chicken inside the crockpot with two forks.  This dish was definitely not spicy-- my kids loved it.  I will be making this again soon.  Thanks for the great recipe!

We were without power due to Ike, so needed a crockpot recipe, as we could plug that into the generator.  Used skinless thighs, as that was what was on hand.  Pretty good flavor and easy.  Served over whole grain penne. Did not have cream of chicken, so used a can of beef gravy mixed with a chicken gravy packet.  Should have mixed the cream cheese more thoroughly, and next time will add a little milk to make more sauce.

Very good!  I used Tastefully Simple's Farmers Medley Dip Mix instead of the Italian dressing mix as I didn't have any on hand.  I also added the can of soup at the beginning with a little bit of water.  I used the light cream cheese as well.  Definitely will make again!

This recipe was delicious!  I followed other reviewers advice and used low fat soup and about 1/3 cup of low fat sour cream and some frozen peas.  Word of caution about the cooking time for the chicken...I tested mine after three hours and it was done.  Next time I might try using boneless skinless chicken thighs for those in my family who don't care for white meat.  I know I will be making this again!

We found this to be tasty and rich but heavy on the cream cheese.  Next time I think I will cut the cream cheese in half and use a half can of cream of mushroom soup or some sour cream.  I will make it again for sure though....my sisters want the recipe in my next cookbook :)

My family liked this recipe, but I did make some changes to make it healthier.  I used 10 chicken tenders and lowfat cream cheese and soup.  I also added a package of fresh white mushrooms (sliced), a package of frozen peas and carrots and a splash of white wine.  We poured it over whole wheat noodles.  I froze half for later use.  Will definitely make again b/c it was so easy.

I have to say..... this really is one of the best recipes I have ever made. Very, very easy and wonderful taste. My husband is the cook in our home and I decided to make supper one night and I selected this recipe because it was easy and had simple ingredients in it. He loved it and all of our children loved it too. I have made it several times since for us and for friends. This one is a keeper. Thanks so much!

This was a great recipe!! My husband actually cooked it for us. The chicken turned out perfect with just the butter and italian dressing.  However, he found it a little rich so next time I'll use 1/2 cream cheese and 1/2 sour cream.

Excellent! My family and I absolutely loved this.  I followed the directions exactly, which is rare for me.  I believe I just added a bit of dried thyme.  Will definitely be making it again night, but I am doubling it next time!

I only give this four stars because I added a half of an onion chopped, a can of mushrooms, and frozen peas in when I added the soup.  Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T.  I served it over wide whole wheat noodles and it was AMAZING!  Will make again!!!

From all the great reviews for this recipe, decided to try this out yesterday. I didn't have chicken breasts, so boned about 5 thighs. This smelt great while cooking, but the result lacked punch. It was pretty much no different that a very salty cream of chicken soup. I will likely not try this recipe again.

My family loves this chicken!  I have altered the recipe quite a bit though - I put the chicken breasts in frozen to save myself some time and do not add the cream cheese at the end.  I cook it on low in the crock pot for 8 hours, then shred the chicken after I get home from work and serve it on hamburger buns.

This was a very good crock pot recipe.  My chicken came out a little dry so I think next time I will probably cook the breats whole and chop up later in the cooking time.  I also added sour cream as suggested by other reviewers.

Holy chicken!  This was awesome.  My chicken actually only took about 3 hours to cook, so I'm not sure if my pieces were too small, or my cooker temp is off.  Nonetheless, this was awesome.  I had my fiance and his best friend (both manual labor men) raving about it.  They ate it ALL!

I thought this recipe was very good.  (My husband was a little less thrilled, but he ate it.)  I was actually surprised, I chopped it up really small for my one year old and he gobbled it up!!  I did think it was a little bland, so I added some onions and next time I might add a little more seasonings... but I'm not sure what...  Enjoy!!

My husband said this is the best crock pot recipe I have ever made. I served it with egg noodles and made too many noodles so I added some sour cream to the recipe to create more 'sauce'.  I also added frozen peas.  Thanks for the recipe...I will be making it again.

We had this for dinner tonight, this is creamy deliciousness full of flavor! Only thing I did different was to use olive oil instead of butter and topped with cracked black pepper. The chicken had plenty of moisture and the italian seasoning stuck to it almost like a skin. Served with dumpling noodles, YUM! My entire family loved this and I will add this recipe to my cookbook!

The flavor is great.However if you want sauce make extra. I am going to only use 2 chicken breast with the same amount of sauce.because the chicken breast I use were large.

The flavours in this were great but I ended up adding water with the soup.  I think next time I will add water at the beginning as the chicken dried out quite a bit.

As written, I gave the recipe 4 stars because I found it to be salty with all that Italian dressing mix.  If I like a recipe, I'll try it at least twice so I braised the chicken in olive oil first, and then put them in the slower cooker with 2 tbsps homemade Italian Dressing Mix (recipe available on allrecipes.com.) When it came time to add the cream of chicken soup and the cream cheese I, also, added some sliced onions and canned mushrooms.  This is wonderful over rice or noodles.  I did fix this a 3rd time and, after removing the tender chicken, I added bow tie pasta to the cream of chicken mixture and cooked an addition 30-45 mins. After the pasta cooked, I shredded the cooked chicken and mixed it all together.  I'm thinking 1 cup of peas would be good in this, too.  All in all, a good recipe. Thanks!!

This was very yummy and everybody raved.  I only gave it 4 stars because I did make some changes to the original.  It was a little too thick so I added a soup can of water to thin it out and a can of mushrooms.  I prepared the chicken exactly as directed and it was fabulous.  Served with a side of veggies it's the perfect meal.

I was pretty disappointed.  The reviewers gave this high marks, but I found it a thick, salty mess.  My husband commented the same.  I did thin it with pasta water, but on the whole, this was the first recipe I tried from this site and hope I will be able to trust future high-rated recipes.

This recipe was just O.K. I will not even try to modify it. One reason I do not care for most slow cooker recipes is that you cannot taste as you go to season. I found this recipe to be very bland.

After reading the reviews, I placed the frozen boneless chicken breasts fillets(which were less then 3/4 inches thick) in the crockpot and then flaked them apart after cooking for 8 hours. Then added the cream cheese and cream of chicken soup and cooked for 30 minutes. It not only saved time but the Chicken Stoganoff turned out great!! This is an excellent base recipe where one can adjust/add to the recipe to suit one's own taste!!! Thanks for a GREAT recipe!!

If I could give this 4.5 I would. It is excellent and very close to perfect as is, but I added mushrooms just because I had them leftover from another recipe and wanted to use them before they went bad and I think that without the mushrooms, it really would have been missing something. Otherwise, I highly recommend following the recipe as is. I noted some people adding soup or other liquids right off the bat but the chicken browned beautifully in just a little butter and seasoning. It was so tender and moist!

I've gotten into the habit of asking each family member to rate the recipe with me.  Our 12-year-old said "1" the 16-year-old said "2.5" my husband said "4" and I say "3."  I did add fresh mushrooms and 1/4 cup of wine.  I did follow the recipe instructions, other than that. Thanks for sharing!

This was the best stroganoff I've ever has, including my grandmas!  I did make a few changes though - I added the mushroom onion soup mix others suggested and I like mine creamier, so in addition to the 2 golden mushroom soups, I put in a cream of mushroom soup and more meat.  It was GREAT!

This was absolutely AWESOME!  My husband and 2 and 5 year old kids ate it up!  I used 1/2 cup of butter sliced up on the chicken, and added enough water to cover the bottom of the crock pot.  This came out so creamy.  Served it over noodles with peas and cranberry sauce. Yummy!

This is an incredible tasting recipe for the little amount of effort put in.  Follow the recipe to a "T" and don't make and changes and you have yourself an easy, hearty dinner.  My husband is a bear about chicken recipes as he didn't eat much growing up, but absolutely loves this!  He requests it at least 1x a month.

This was sooo easy and sooo good. After reading the reviews, I added cream of mushroom soup, used only half of a packet of italian seasoning mix, and substituted low fat sour cream for half of the cream cheese (and I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese). I think it would have been too thick with the entire block of cream cheese. It was really rich and very tasty. I served it over egg noodles, and both of my young kids loved it too. My 5 year old son said it was the best thing that I had ever cooked!

This was great!  I didn't have the salad dressing mix, so I used a packet out of an italian pasta mix.  My husband loved it and both of my toddlers ate it, which says it all.

This is a great stroganoff!  Sooo easy.  I left out the margarine and it still turned out fantastic.  The next time I made it I added 1/2 bag of frozen green peas.   That version was excellent too.

I normally don't cook anything with a can of premade soup, but I tried this anyway because of the great reviews and the number of reviews. It's a good recipe for a husband who doesn't cook and wants to make something easy. My husband just came in and thanked me again for that delicious dinner and I have to say, for a simple dish, it was very good, soup and all. I'm thinking some mushrooms would jazz it up a bit.........needs a little something, but otherwise, pretty good.

This was an great and easy recipe.  I did modify it somewhat.  I added one can of cream of mushroom soup and a small can of sliced mushrooms, to make it more like a real stroganoff.  The results were delicious.  The only thing I might change for next time will be to add some milk to thin the sauce out a bit.

This was awesome.  I added green onion and garlic to recipe.  I also, used 98% fat free cream of chicken soup and 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  You could not tell this was low fat.  Thanks for posting a great recipe.

This was great!! and easy. The chicken browned and tasted more like roasted. I cooked it 3 hours on high then added the soup and cream cheese and cooked for another 1/2 hour. I did add about 1/3 cup of water to make a little more sauce.If I was not going to be home I would have added everything to the pot at the start. Glad I did not, I liked the chicken better this way.

Excellent. I used a chopped onion and green pepper and a splash of red wine.  My only mistake was using a very low sodium cream of mushroom soup. It was not salty enough for me. I would use regular soup or maybe a white sauce next time.  This was excellent over brown rice.

This was WAY too rich. The first two bites were good, but then I could barely eat anymore. I think there was too much cream cheese, maybe using about half and using more cream of chicken would be better.

This was VERY easy and very tasty!  The only change I made was to double the recipe and threw in a few splashes of white wine (in the beginning).  My kids really liked it and my house smelled yummy all day!

I'm sure that this recipe is good but it needs a different name.  It has no mushrooms, sour cream or beef in it which is what this recipes namesake intended of it.

Very good.  Added mushrooms and a touch of water.  Used lower fat cream cheese and low  fat/sodium soup.  I can't imagine using full sodium soup...it would have been too salty. I'd like to add other veggies but I"m not sure what wold work.

This wasn't bad, but I did find this recipe too rich and too salty. If I make this again, I will add my own seasoning rather than using the soup mix, and use half the amount of cream cheese, adding some low fat sour cream instead.

I love this recipe for being oh-so easy. After reading previous reviews, I decided to follow the recipe as-is as far as the liquids were concerned. My fellow reviewers were right on with the lovely roasted-chicken flavor that results. Just as a personal preference, I think this recipe should call for some freshly-cracked pepper just to give it a little zing. Served over No Yolk noodles, it was good meal!

I made this for dinner one evening and my husband loved it.  The dried Italian seasoning added such a great flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly and will certainly make it again.  Mary

Yummy but needed a few changes because it was too dry.  I added milk and sour cream until I got the consistency I wanted.  The flavor is a bit strong too.  Might be better with mild italian dressing mix.

I was like many other reviewers who were not sure how this would turn out by just adding the chicken with the margarine and italian seasoning package. This turns out very well, nice and creamy. Husband enjoyed this version of stroganoff.

Very good!!  Both my two toddlers loved this recipe.  The house smelled fabulous, too.  I used 1/2 block of low-fat cream cheese and one large serving spoon full (about 1/2c.) of low-fat sour cream instead of the full block of cream cheese.  It came out wonderful!  I also served it with whole-wheat egg noodles and it was great.  My in-laws were over for supper & they too, raved over it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very good, the whole family loved it. I thought the sauce was a bit rich, but of course I still ate way more than I should have! The only changes I made were to add about 3/4 cup of sour cream (I didn't measure, just used what was left in the container) and I ended up making it in the oven because it was a last minute dinner choice. I just mixed it all up and baked for 35 minutes at 375. Served over egg noodles. Next time, I think I'll use all low fat ingredients and whole grain noodles to make it healthier.

Just okay from my family, good comfort food. I added 2 tsp. of minced garlic, halfed the butter and left the pieces whole and upped it to 5 breasts because there was a lot of sauce.  It still fell apart into threads when we would have preferred actual pieces of chicken. Will maybe try it again over less time.

This was great. It is a great base recipe to modify according to what you have on hand. Because I didn't have italian dressing, I used an onion soup mix and substituted cream and chicken bouillion for the cream of chicken soup. I also added some chopped frozen spinach with the cream cheese. My family loved it! We served it over rice and it was demolished.

This turned out pretty good. I didn't have time to put it in the slow cooker...I also didn't have any Italian dressing.  I used some season salt on the chicken and cooked it with a little bit of chicken broth really slowly in a skillet. Next time I will put it in the slow cooker. I took other's advice and used half cream cheese and half sour cream to lighten it up a little.

can't get much easier and totally comforting!!!  i do suggest adding garlic - a tbl of minced was good for me.  i didn't use all 8oz of crm cheese either - probably around 6 and i did add 1/2 can of low sod. chic. broth. I easily pulled apart chicken w/a fork before adding crm.cheese and crm of chickn soup. house smells great.  thank you..this will be a regular - especially in the colder months.

This recipe was okay for a easy dinner option. Served over rice. I only used 1/2 a packet of dressing and 1/2 a package of cream cheese and I think this was plenty.  I think it would have been too over powering in taste for my kids otherwise. Definitely only needs to simmer on low for about 3 1/2 hours (or leave the chicken uncut). I cooked 4 1/2 hours and my chicken was dry. I cut my chicken into good size chunks, not small pieces.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe and have passed it on to at least 5 friends who LOVE it also!  I use the Campbell's healthy cream of chicken soup and about 3/4 of a block of reduced fat cream cheese, and it's still creamy and delicious!

Yummy, this a keeper!... I also used reduced fat cream of chicken and reduced fat cream cheese..Instead of using 8oz. of the cream cheese I only used 4oz and I was out of milk so to thin it out I used a ladel of my pasta water I used to make my egg noodles with..Very good, will make again..

Really easy recipe. I was a little concerned about blandness so when I put the chicken in I added 1/4 tsp. of crushed red pepper and some paprika for color. I used 1/3 fat cream cheese and added frozen peas, mushrooms, and a liberal dash of white pepper. Came out really good, although my wife said she would have preferred it prepared with beef instead of chicken.

Sorry, I only thought it was ok. I followed the directions exactly except that after the chicken was cooked, I took some of the juices that accumulated away before adding the cream cheese and soup, since there was no mention of leaving it in or not. The taste in the end was a little too cream cheesy. Maybe if I reduce the amount of cream cheese to half, it might of tasted better and cut the cook time down down a couple hours since I felt the chicken was too overcooked.

Like a few others I was skeptical about destroying the chicken without having any real liquid in the crockpot for so long. I was so glad to find out my fears were unfounded. This is one of the best things I've tasted in a long time! Great comfort food!

My family loved this..even the 3 and 4 year old!
I did 1/2 reduced fat cream cheese and 1/2 reduced fat sour cream along with 1 cup of chix stock to make it more juicy/spreadable over the whole wheat noodles!

Really great recipe. To make lowfat I used low fat cream cheese, and half the amount called for. Added skim milk to make more sauce. And used 98% fat free condensed soup. I also added mushrooms. We will make this a lot!

This is very easy and good dish.  I added 1/4 cup of white wine with the chicken based on other reviews.  I think this helped dilute the cream of chicken later on, but prevented the browning of the chicken.  It still tasted good though so I'm not going to complain.

This recipe was just alright for me. My husband liked it more than I did. I certainly appreciated how easy it was - and it made the house smell yummy. It was quick to put together over egg noodles on a busy weeknight. But, I found it to be a bit too salty for my taste. Overall, I think I'd rather stick to making traditional Stroganoff

This is a no-fuss recipe that turns out pretty well.  It won't go into my regular rotation, but I will probably make it again in the future.  I used 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup and substituted fat free sour cream for the cream cheese.  I served it over yolk-free noodles.  It didn't knock my socks off, but it was a nice meal.

THANK YOU, Judi!!  This is good home cookin' at it's easiest.  I followed the recipe exactly and it got rave reviews and everyone I shared the recipe with now makes it regularly for their families.  It's a great base recipe for experimentation.  I add jalapenos, bell peppers, lots of garlic and veggies to jazz it up, too.  I think the recipe works fine with 1/2 the cheese, if you are watching calories.  Again thanks, this recipe stays at the front of my "keeper pile".

This was surprisingly delicious!  I added a splash of white wine with the chicken as others had done.  I also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, added the noodles to the pot and thinned it with chicken broth.  We really enjoyed it and will def make it again.  So EASY!  Thank you!

It's edible, not great. I added peas for a little flavor and color. I also added a little chicken broth to prevent dryness. Not very appetizing visually and I wouldn’t make it again. Thanks anyway.

My sister & her kids liked it. I didn't think it was that special. I over cooked it a bit though so maybe it was just too mushy or something. Flovur was ok. I might possibly try this one more time though , everything here sounds like something we would enjoy so maybe it was just over cooked.

This was SO GOOD!!!! If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I would. I made just a few simple additions.  I added a splash of white wine when I put the chicken in.  I also added two small sliced onions. At the end when the cream cheese is added I added a large drained can of mushrooms (fresh would be yummy). Next time I make this I will use boneless skinless thighs because I like the way they cook up in a slow cooker better. This recipe could not possibly have a bigger payoff for how simple it is.

I'll keep this recipe on my go-to list, but I did enjoy the Easy and Delicious Chicken (on allrecipes too) a little bit better. Now, I did try to make this a little more mild by adding the soup when I added the Italian Seasoning....just b/c my husband and daughter are recovering from the stomach flu. So, for today, it accomplishes its purpose. The sauce picked up the flavor nicely, but the chicken is very moist but not flavorful like it turned out for me when I made the Easy and Delicious Chicken.

Very delicious and super easy to make!   I added a little chicken broth with the cream cheese mixture at the end to thin the sauce a little. I also made with reduced fat cream cheese and healtthy choice soup.  Next time I think I will add onions and some vegetables too.  This is a new favorite!

This is so easy and so yummy too!  My husband and I both enjoyed this very much and will make again!  I did add 2 more Tbps. of butter and cooked as directed.  Than added the soup but only had 4 oz. of cream cheese, which was plenty.  Than cooked  8 oz. of pasta and added to the crock-pot right before serving.  Had peas with it and made a yummy meal!!  Thanks Judi for a quick meal!!

My family enjoys this recipe very much, even my picky 3 year old!  It is a great winter "comfort food", which we need much of this time of year!  I follow the recipe almost to the letter, just using the reduced fat cream cheese and soup and it turns out delicious.  I am looking forward to our next family gathering to "wow" the crowd!

Very good. Very easy. Whole family gobbles it up every time. Sometimes I add mushrooms.( I add mushrooms to just about everything!) I make this a couple times a year and have had it in my recipe box since 03' so I thought I should finally give it a rating!

This was pretty good, but I'll use it in the future only as a base.  It's nice to make as is if you're short on time or are just too tired to make much of an effort.  But, it would be a lot more interesting with some chopped onion, mushroom and maybe thin it out with some chicken broth.  It was much to rich for my taste.

This recipe was so easy to make. I started it too early in the day so it was very thick by the time we were ready to eat it for supper, so I thinned it out with a little water. It was delicious. I'll definitely be making this again.

Very tasty - and so easy to throw together, too!  I forwarded this recipe to a friend who made it without the cream cheese (her daughter is lactose-intolerant) and she said it was really good that way, too.  I may try it without the cream cheese next time to save a few calories.  Definitely a keeper!

Very good, but very creamy. We added red wine to the leftovers as suggested in other reviews and it was very good.

This was a hit. Cooking the chicken without liquid at first browns it nicely. The only (minor) downside is that the dish is so white and colorless - I might sprinkle with diced red pepper or paprika next time, just for contrast.

The first time I made this I didn't even add the cream of chicken soup or the cream cheese because my kids loved the chicken plain so much.  I used the leftovers to make the most incredible chicken enchiladas.  The second time, I followed the recipe and there were NO leftovers.  It's a keeper no matter how you make it :)

Easy and good. I did add about 1/2 cup of chicken broth in with the chicken and dressing mix...my crock pot cooks hot even on low!

This recipe was awesome. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star is because it lacks color. It smells divine while it's cooking. The Italian dressing makes this recipe delicious. This will definitely be a recipe I make over and over.

I'd probably give this one three stars, the 4 star rating is from my husband. I added cubed potatoes, sliced onions and red peppers and used low fat soup and cream cheese.   also added white wine and chicken broth and served it as a chowder-type soup. Very easy, hands-off cooking and a wonderful fragrance to come home to.

Very good and extremely easy.  Maybe reduce a bit on the cream cheese.  Makes it very rich with the whole 8 oz.

Great recipe! Followed Judi's directions not making any changes. The whole family loves it. I was asked to make it again soon. This will be a reccuring dinner in our house.

Super EASY!! Really good taste. I used Campbell's Golden Mushroom and it tasted just as good as the original. I also didn't cube the chicken to save time and cooked it on high for about 3-4 hours, chicken didn't get dried out. Definitely a family dinner keeper!

I've been wanting to try this recipe for a long time and finally did.  My husband doesn't like cream cheese so I was a little bit worried and decided to substitute a couple of ounces with sour cream instead of adding the whole thing.  I didn't tell him it had cream cheese in it and he didn't say anything about it, but ate lots that night and had leftovers for lunch the next two days.  This is a keeper because it's so good and so easy.

I hoped this recipe was going to be as good as the reviews said, but I didn't think so. The chicken was moist and flavorful from the Good Seasons dressing -- but I thought the sauce was bland. It was edible, but I probably won't make it again.

A savory and creamy wonderland that dances in your mouth. This dish was very easy to make. With only 5 ingredients, it is simple to make for even the extreme novice. In the end, the sauce is creamy smooth, the chicken is flavoured through and through, and is very moist. This stroganoff compliments an array of things such as pastas, rice, or even try it topped on a buttery piece of toasted baguette. Add fresh basil for a touch of sweetness. Simple and fantastic.

This was an excellent meal. My friends loved it. My only complaint was that it was a bit too salty for me. I used the low fat cream cheese and the low fat soup as another had suggested. If there are any ideas on making this same recipe less salty, I would make it agoain in an instant

It was good.  I served in with spaghetti noodles. I did have to thin it out a bit. I agree with another member that I will use sour cream next time. But it was pretty good and budget friendly.

I'm glad I read reviews before cooking this. I was attracted by the short list of ingredients and ease of the recipe. I agree that sour cream would reduce the richness; however, I liked it rich. I used chive cream cheese (as a reviewer recommended), which I would also recommend. Also, I added a couple of splashes of Pinot Grigio. I think that was a great addition. I also wanted more sauce to go with my noodles so I used 2 cans of soup- one cream of mushroom and one cream of chicken. Next time I will follow advice of others and throw in some veggies. This was a good meal.

Oh my gosh, I just made this recipe today and it was amazing! My entire family liked it, which almost never happens! They want me to make it all the time. I cooked up some white rice and green peas (just throw frozen peas into rice 10 minutes into cooking the rice), and put the chicken and sauce over the rice and peas. It was truly delicious. We used the low fat/low salt soup, and the lower fat cream cheese. Really a fairly healthy recipe except for all the margarine.

This was good but couldn't eat too much before being overwhelmed with the same rich flavor. I think adding a veggie like frozen peas would do wonders for this recipe, it seemed to be lacking that final ingredient.

I really wanted to love this recipe, but I have to say that it was surprisingly bland...  Made it yesterday for myself and boyfriend and while it wasn't bad enough to toss - neither of us went back for seconds.  The Italian Dressing Seasoning didn't leave the zip I had expected, and even combined with the salty condensed soup - it really wasn't enough to balance out the mild cream cheese.  As for the Chicken, in the end it could have easily been mistaken for chunked canned Tuna (not necessarily a bad thing I suppose).  Personally, I won't be making this one again.

I do not slow cook. So I used chicken tenders cut into bite size pieces, sauted the chicken with some diced onion and garlic. When the chicken was done I added the seasoning and soup (I used a can of Cream of Mushroom and Cream of Celery) and some mushrooms (just cause I love mushrooms) let it cook for about 40 minutes then added the cream cheese. I added sour cream right before serving. The seasoning was not enough for me, so I sprinkled a little creole seasoning on mine.  I used the Healthy Recipe soups, together with low fat cream cheese and low fat sour cream, really, really good!!

This was AWESOME! I used two gigantic chicken breast halves (almost 1½ pounds total) cut into small bite-sized pieces. I also used the Italian Dressing Mix recipe from this site (scaled down to 2 servings) and 1 TBS margarine. I let it cook, stirring the chicken pieces two or three times, for about 8 hours on low. I then added the cream cheese and a can of cream of celery soup (I have found cream of chicken soup to be a little too sweet for our tastes). I let it cook on high for an hour or so, stirred it, and served over egg noodles. Very tasty and made great leftovers! Thanks for sharing, Judi!

This was really yummy. A little rich, but the zing of the dressing packet cut the richness a lot. I served it over egg noodles. Will make again.

I had to alter this for a faster result.  I had leftover chicken and came home starving.  I cut up the leftover chicken and used all the listed ingredients in the same qty except for the margarine which I replaced with skim milk titrated to my desired consistency.  Great flavors!  I wonder what it's going to taste like tomorrow.

Very good!  I served it over brown rice.  I had to use a little bit of mashed potato flakes to thicken the sauce, but that is probably just my preference.
Thanks!

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. I had 2 plate fulls and dh cleaned the crockpot clean. I did halve the cream cheese, added about a cup of sourcream and threw in fresh baby portabellos when I added the soup mixture.

I've been meaning to rate this recipe for a while. I actually made this one night for company, doubling the recipe and was so glad that I did. It was amazing. I did add some fresh mushrooms to it as well. Last night, I had some left over marinated garlic and herb chicken breasts that had been done on the grill. I just shredded them up, threw everything in the crockpot on low until it heated thru and my goodness, it was yummy. Thanks for a winner!! UPDATE!! I have since made this recipe substituting boneless pork. Just as amazing if not better. I always use the cream cheese but also stir in some sour cream at the end because we like things a little on the saucier side. This is always at least a once a month recipe.

Served over penne pasta.  Great flavor, and made the house smell great.  I added a little white wine at the beginning.  I think I will try making it on the range next time if I didn't have all day to let it cook.

I'm fairly impressed with the flavor given the number of ingredients. I used butter with the chicken, not marg, and also used Golden Mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken. Didn't change anything else, and won't in the future.

This was great and so simple! I added a can of mushrooms and some sour cream because I did not have a full 8 ozs. of cream cheese and it was a good touch and will do that again.
My boy friend's kids loved it and he did too!We love crock pot meals and this is a keeper! Nice change! Thanks!

What a great recipe!  I throw the breasts in whole & then just fork shred it before adding the cream cheese mix.  My husband travels and this is a perfect dinner with a nice salad and the leftovers microwave well for lunch the next day.  I add about 1/2 cup white wine with the margarine and check it every hour or so to see if it's getting dry and splash more in, if necessary.

Great recipe! Very easy & it turned out really well. I to was sceptical about so little liquid, but took a leap, and it turned out great. I mixed in some angel hair pasta with it before serving as others suggested & it was a hit! Thanks!

A hit with the whole family. I followed the suggestions to cut the cream cheese to about 5 oz. It cooked all day while I was at work so I added a little chicken broth and white wine when I got home. We served it over rice. The leftovers I ate for lunch the next day were delicious as well. We'll be making this again!

My family loved this. The only changes I made were to add fresh sauted mushrooms when I added the cream cheese at the end. I only used 1/2 the amount the recipe called for. I also added about 1/2 soup can of chicken broth. Served it over angel hair pasta. Very Good! Can't wait to make it again.

I basically followed the recipe.  I tried to cook the chicken initially on low for ten hours and it did overcook.  I just followed the recipe straight afterwards, I added a can of chicken broth that's about it to not overcook further.  Anyway my kids loved it.  It was good.  I am adding to my recipe box.  Quick and easy.

Wow - just terrific. It did look kind of weird before the soup and cream cheese went in at the end, but all comes together beautifully. Great flavor. I loved it, hubby loved it.  We'll definately try it again.

I made this today, as directed.  The only change I made was I added about 1/2 of a soup can of water to the mixture at the end.  I also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese.

I really didn't like the flavor.  I can't put my finger on why.  I couldn't finish my helping and was sad that I had so much left over which will go to waste.

Flavor was good but salty.  I cooked whole, icy-cold breasts rather than cubed chicken - after 7 hours on low, it was almost overdone.  Looked a little un-appetizing, but again, flavor was good.  Not sure if I would make this again.  Would probably try other slow cooker recipes first.

It was good but a little dry.  I added some water and it made it not so thick.  We also put it on top of rice which was really tasty.

This was really good!  I added some white wine as suggested, and also put in some sliced portobello and white mushrooms I had left over in my fridge.  I added the mushrooms shortly before the last stage, so that they were soft and tasty but not overcooked.  This was excellent over some egg noodles.  My husband ate this right up!

Delicious! Only alteration made was I added half an onion and a little wine. Not too salty for us, but we love salt. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a very thick and hearty meal, perfect for cold winter nights. My picky husband and son ate every bite. They ask for it all the time! Thank you!

A friend of mine gave me this recipe a while ago.  In her version you don't have to cube the chicken or add the butter.  It is super yummy comfort food and a snap to make.  Serve over egg noodles!

This recipe was great!  My whole family loved it.  I added a jar of sliced mushrooms with garlic the last half hour or so just to "beef it up" a bit, then served it over egg noodles.  I grated some fresh parmesan and chopped italian parlsey on it -- everyone thought it was soooo good!!!

Very easy!  I added 1/4 c. water (an idea I got from a similar recipe on another site), used Zesty Italian mix, cooked in the soup, put the chicken breasts in frozen, then shredded them at the time I added the cream cheese.  Everyone liked them.  It didn't make all that much.  I'd probably double it if we had anyone else over.  (Our family at nearly the whole recipe:  mom, dad, kids ages 8, 5, and 1).  This will be a good "soccer practice" day meal!

This recipe was WONDERFUL and so easy! I also added the soup at the begining. I also added 1/2 can of chicken broth and some Litehouse Italian Herbs Seasoning. After the cream cheese, I used fat free, melted, I also added 2 tablespoons of lite sour cream. My family loved it!

Delicious!  I made a few changes that others suggested.  Added a dash of white cooking wine and a little chicken broth.  Also, cooked the chicken in the soup from the start. I used the whole packet of dressing mix and it wasn't too salty for me or my husband.

Delicious!  I followed recipe exactly, and did not think it was too salty as other reviewers did.  Hubby says this one goes on "the list".  Very high praise coming from him!

Not the greatest for me and my honey, but the kids liked it. Of course, that doesn't guarantee they'll like it next week....
I probably won't make this again.....
