I've never made fried chicken before, and this was just what I was looking for! I always marinate poultry in a salt water solution before I make it (big difference, much more juicy), so I knew Doreen knew what she was talking about. Thank you for such a nice recipe!

I tried it today. It was so good. Instead of dipping the chicken to the flour for the first time, I shook it in a brown bag. For a kick, I added some creole seasoning and chili powder to the flour mixture. Since I don't have a deep fryer or meat thermometer, I cooked the chicken in medium heat for the first two minutes and low heat for the rest. The salt water marination and msg really did the trick! kudos.

This was great!  I tried it last night and this is a keeper.  Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  I did omit MSG and added more seasoning.  Thanks for posting!

The marinade really made a difference-the chicken was extra tender. Actually the whole cooking method was great. The only addition I made was to the spices; I increased the pepper and added 1 teas. each of paprika, garlic powder, dry mustard and poultry seasoning. No matter how you like your chicken seasoned and breaded, the marinade will make a difference. Yum!

I really liked this recipe.  I find leaving the chicken to brine overnight in the fridge works better than just 20 minutes, but 20 minutes will do if you're short on time.  I added a few more spices to the mix as other reviewers did.  Also omitted the msg.  Beautiful!  Will mnake this again.

Very good, I did add a lot more seasonings to my flour.  I always drain fried food on a rack because the bottom can get soggy if drained on a paper towel.

I used this recipe for 120 servings and everyone raved about the chicken.  I will use this recipe from now on. One thing I had to add was more flour because of the flour getting wet when you roll the wet chicken. To say again we love this recipe.

I searched long and hard for a good fried chicken recipe. This one is it. I agree with Janice, the only extra thing it needs is a few more spices in the batter.

Yum

Truly makes a crispy shell and juicy meat. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because the coating as written is very bland, need to add some seasonings to the flour mix. A helpful tip, split the flour mix in half, use 1 half for the dry chicken and 1 half for after you dip into the egg/milk mix.

I cooked this for my family tonight.  I did, however, use chicken strips instead of bone-in chicken.  My 5 yr old son had been especially picky all this week ,but tonight he ate three large pieces of chicken!!!!   Kids will love this chicken!!

This was great!  It is much better than regular fried chicken.  I did add some more spices, celery salt, paprika, chicken seasoning and a dash of creole seasoning.  I will make this again!

I worked in the 'famous restaurant chain' when I was 16. This recipe is probably as close as we can get at home. They use magic and they wear visors. All in all, with the tools and ingredients we have available, this is a great recipe - recommended! Thanks!

The recipe is delicious but, I will not make again. I just cannot get past the mess that frying bone-in chicken in oil makes.

I used this recipe and it rivaled my mom's fried chicken. I just placed the chicken in a bowl and let it sit on a counter to marinade to bring it to room temp, this brings better results when cooking any meat. When it was done marinating, I put it in a large bowl added a quarter cup of hot sauce, some pappy's choice seasoning and McCormick's hot shot pepper, after each piece was covered, dropped in a bag of flour one-at-a-time and shake to completely cover and then place in medium-high oil until they were golden brown and crispy. There is no need to double dip, they are coated to perfection when you do it like this.

This was very moist and came out crispy. I did not, however, think that it was that much better than some of the easier recipes and cannot justify the time and effort that it took. The marinade I will do again; but the rest I will do differently.

Very easy and tasty fried chicken, although it wasn't the specific "restuarant style" fried chicken I was hoping for. The fried coating came out a lot thinner than what I expected. I think the brine was what made the chicken so good. I'm from an MSG household, so that was a definite MUST. I added a packet of poultry seasoning to the flour, instead of just salt and it came out de-lish. I'll experiment with different spices next time.

haven't tried this yet but I'm wondering what the heck is monosodium glutamate and what aisle of the grocery store is it on?  I know sodium is salt but yeah I'll probably try it without it.

Very good, crispy batter, moist chicken, although I had to lower the heat, as the hot oil started to burn the batter. I would add more spices too. But good recipe to use as a base

The method of soaking it in salt water kept the chicken very moist after frying that was fantastic! However the coating was not crisp enough at all . I had to coat in breadcrumbs and then it was very nice. I served it with baked potatoes with cheese and bacon and a dip made with BBQ sauce and a little chilli sauce and the family loved it!

Excellent recipe.  I made this with chicken breast strips for wraps. Family loved it. Added 1tbsp Creole seasoning to the flour mix for added flavor.  Next time I make this,  will separate flour mixture for pre and post egg dip as flour turned doughy after the first few pieces.

I just wanted to do a comparison against my own recipe. This was nice and simple, but took far too long to make. Flavor was okay, and very passable.

Always done my chicken this way since my first job @KFC 40 years ago........ Just leave out the MSG=Bad Stuff. I marinate all my chicken for at least 12 hours in brine solution then freeze tenders in gallon freezer bags for faster dinners.

It was Crispy but the flavor was a bit bland for my taste.  The Chicken also does not reheat well.  The skin takes on a rubbery consistancy.

The measurements were too much for me but the end result was the best ive ever tasted so far. Ive extended the marinade to 40-50 minutes and double coated the chicken. It was perfection.

I used chicken tenderloins  and I replaced the msg with Herbs de Provence and added a bit more salt. These came out excellent! Full of flavor and extra crispy! Saving this recipe for future use!

Pretty easy to make; I fried the chicken in a pot that was filled about half way full with oil. I wish this recipe had a few more 'optional' spices that could be added to the batter for an extra burst of flavor. Technically speaking this is really good chicken(cooks well), but the taste is a little 'eh.' Great recipe for people that are just learning how to cook, like me. :)

Used kfc copycat spice blend and this recipe with boneless , skinless chicken breasts, halved recipe except for coating. Awesome. Thank you. Best fried chicken I have made. Followed other reviewer tip to fry both sides 5 minutes, then bake 30 minutes in preheated 400 degree oven. Forgot to bake on a rack, but was still great. Will use rack though in future.
