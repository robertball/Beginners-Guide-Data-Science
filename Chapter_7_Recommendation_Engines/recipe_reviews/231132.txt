I doubled the dressing as Brenda suggested. I took the salad to a potluck and it must have been a hit because the bowl was half empty. Very good.

I altered dressing recipe: 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup sesame oil, used rice vinegar in place of apple cider and added 1 Tablespoon soy sauce.  Also, toasted the almonds and sesame. Excellent.

A little dry. Needs more dressing.  Next time I'll add more sweetener.

I did change it quite a bit, like a lot of cooks do, but will still rate a 5. I added roasted sunflower seeds, a can of drained mandarin oranges, used 2 pkgs of Oriental flavor ramen noodles with the flavor packets, 1/2 cup sugar vs 2 TBS, a squirt of honey, used 3/4 cup olive oil vs 1/2 cup (too dry with all of the other ingredients otherwise) a tsp toasted sesame seed oil, a bag of shredded coleslaw with green and red cabbage and carrots mix vs just 1/2 head shredded cabbage and no salt. I crushed the 2 pkgs of ramen noodles in a bag, then spread them, along with the slivered almonds and sesame seeds on a cookie sheet, which I toasted for about 8 minutes in a preheated 350 degree oven. I  warmed the oils in a 2 cup glass measuring cup in the microwave, about 2 minutes, then whisked the sugar and the 2 flavor packets in it until dissolved. I then whisked in the apple cider vinegar and pepper. I put all the ingredients in a large bowl, then poured the oil mixture over all and mixed well. Chilled for 2 hours. It was awesome!

Great basis to start from. I know it seems obvious, but I thought it might help brand new cooks if the recipe said to crunch up the noodles into little pieces. I do that before I even open the package. A agree, use some sesame oil, rice vinegar, and a little soy sauce, Leave out the salt and use the packet of Asian seasoning that comes with the Ramen. Adds a nice flavor. If it turns out there's a little too much dressing, just add a little more cabbage.

crunchy -sweet, tangy and filling.  I had to adapt, a lot.  I used crunchy wont-ton strips, honey coated sunflower seeds and regular vinegar.   Only since where I live, the little grocery does not offer a big variety and I use what I have on hand.  

I did double the dressing to make sure it was well coated.  

It turned out delicious and we will make it again.

I added another pack of ramen, quite a bit more green onions, and also a little bit of chopped romaine lettuce to make it have more color. I think it would also be really good with some mandarin oranges in it!

This is one of my favorite dishes to bring to potlucks. People gobble it up! I like to use sliced instead of slivered almonds and toast them a bit in a frying pan along with the sesame seeds.

Use equal amounts of vinegar and sugar.  It is always a hit.

A consistently  great recipe I have made over and over.  Only changes I make is to toast sesame seeds AND mix the ramen packet of seasonings with the dressing ingredients.  Leftovers keep nicely for a day or two refrigerated.

I made this following the recipe but added sesame oil to the dressing, very good way to get rid of left over chicken.

Delicious. I did, however, use a different dressing & rice noodles instead of  ramen.

Made this salad and loved it!!! We added a poached chicken breast, diced into our mix. It was our dinner as is and nothing else. 

I would say I thought the dressing needed a bit more flavor. I think I will use sunflower oil next time to compliment the sunflowers in the recipe.

My husband and I loved this. I did double the dressing and added a little more vinegar to the dressing. I also used about 2 TBS sesame oil instead of some of the olive oil and added fresh ginger because we love those flavors. Definitely a keeper

Just really blah- years ago I made a Chinese Chicken Salad and it was delicious - I lost the recipe...wish I would have looked around on line instead of making this one.
