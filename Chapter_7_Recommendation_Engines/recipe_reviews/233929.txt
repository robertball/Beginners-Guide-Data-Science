LOVE THIS!  The first time I made these I followed the recipe completely and enjoyed them.  So a few days later I made them again changing them just a little and the results were AMAZING!!!  I cut the white sugar back using 1/4 cup, added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, added 1/4 cup of honey, used applesauce in place of oil and used Greek yogurt in place of milk.  Lastly, I did squeeze the shredded zucchini between paper towels to get rid of the water so that the muffins would not be too wet.

I made these tonight and the only thing I changed was to substitute apple sauce for the oil as I wanted fewer calories.  THEY WERE DELICIOUS! These muffins were a HUGE hit with everyone. I will be making them regularly.

I'm excited to be the first to rate this delicious recipe! Moist and juicy; an excellent way to use the last half zucchini I had left over from another recipe, plus the last of the blueberries from this year's tiny crop. I didn't measure the zucchini, but I figured it was a little over a cup, but it worked out fine. Only thing I did differently was use 1/2c. whole wheat flour instead of all white, but that's one of my standard baking secrets. Made a dozen big, gorgeous, plump muffins just right for breakfast or anytime. Couldn't eat just one, no way, and I don't plan to share these beauties with anyone!

Very good, next time I make it I will adjust cooking time though (my oven runs really hot).  Very moist and delicious  and an excellent way to use up what I had on hand. I used applesauce to replace the oil and plain yogurt to replace the milk (for my toddler).  Thanks for submitting. UPDATE:  I would like to add that since I replaced the oil with applesauce & used frozen blueberries, this did not keep long at all.  It turned into a slimy consistency within 3 days.  If you aren't going to eat all of the muffins in 2 days,  1/2 the recipe or go with the original ingredients (oil) it will keep longer.

7-31-2017  ~While looking for a recipe for muffins calling for zucchini, this one had me at olive oil. The olive oil, along with the zucchini of course, made these incredibly moist.  The zucchini is undetectable and the amount of cinnamon makes these delicately and pleasantly spiced.  A happy mistake was that I inadvertently reversed the amounts of brown sugar and granulated sugar which I believe contributed a little extra flavor.  I did not add the pecans, choosing to add an extra handful of blueberries instead.  A happy surprise was accidently finding some extra streusel I had stashed in the freezer, perfectly suited for these muffins, an addition that took them over the top.  The bottom line?  Hubs remarked, “These are the best  "D" things (muffins) I ever ate.  Ten stars!”

Since I eat gluten free,I decided to experiment with this recipe. I am happy to say, I am glad I did. For the flour I used 1\2 cup ground gluten free oatmeal, 3 tbsp. ground flax seed and enough brown rice flour to make a cup. Then I added another 1/2 cup brown rice flour. I used 1\2 cup of honey for the sweetener, added 1\2 tsp. nutmeg as others suggested. I also used 1\2 cup of applesauce instead of the oil. For the milk I had buttermilk so I used that, I am thinking other milk would work just fine. No nuts because of a nut allergy and I added dried cranberries instead of the blueberries. These turned out great as mini muffins. It made 28.

Excellent! These are my favorite blueberry muffins! I have tried so many 5 star recipes! Something was wrong with most of them. But these are just perfect! I add more zucchini because it adds moisture. I also add more blueberries because we like a lot of them. And substitute 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour.

Super awesome recipe!!!!  The muffins were inhaled by my family! I alone ate 3!!!!!!   Yikes!  
I read a few of the reviews and decided I would try this recipe as close to the original recipe as possible.  The only substitution I made was the oil. I just couldn't put olive oil in my blueberry muffins!  Instead I used a 1/2 cup of homemade apple butter which turned out amazing!  The apple butter added a deep and flavorful complexity to the blueberry/zucchini mix! Plus the moisture and texture were perfect.  The AB did make the muffins a little darker in color FYI.  
The only other thing I did purposely for this recipe was to squeeze out my previously shredded and frozen zucchini.  When it thaws from the freezer, it's extra watery, so I stuck it in the colander and squeezed much of the extra liquid out.  I freeze my shredded zucchini in bags of 2cup amounts.  When I was done squeezing the 2cups, I actually ended up with a total of 1cup in the end.  It was the perfect amount and texture for the recipe apparently.  The muffins were amazing!  
Oh, one more thing, I didnt add nuts.  My family doesn't like them.
This recipe will stay on my counter for awhile because I know my family will be requesting them frequently!!!!

These muffins were easily adapted to our dietary preferences.  I omitted the nuts, substituted almond milk, maple flavoring, and chia seeds mixed with water (for egg sub), and they came out great!

Definitely healthy tasting! Not too sweet. Rather moist due to the zucchini no doubt. Will make again.

Ahhhh-mazing! A hit with the hubby, 17, and 4 year olds. I took another reviewers' advice and subbed 1/2 cup of AP flour for whole wheat flour. Definitely going in the recipe box!

Way too much oil! These were greasy and my paper liners were soaked in oil. If I made it again I would cut the oil and possibly do apple sauce to substitute some of the oil.

I simply had to rate this recipe, I've made it 4 times already and it comes out great every time. It makes very moist, not too sweet muffins.  I made it exactly as is, and it was great. Twice used Greek yoghourt instead of milk, and it worked great.I don't mind the sugar and the oil, it's a treat after all. When I didn't have fresh blueberries I used wild frozen, rolled in a little bit of flour. Mine were done in 21 min. I will be making these regularly.

THE BEST!!  I was looking for a way to use up an abundance of zucchini and blueberries from my garden and tried this recipe.  I substituted Splenda for the white sugar and applesauce for the oil and they were INCREDIBLE.  I made 7 dozen and stopped ONLY because I ran out of freezer room.  Very easy to just grab a couple out of the freezer for breakfast.  SO happy I found this recipe.

Made this for my husband to take to a men's breakfast this morning.  I made them in mini muffins.  Of course I tasted before they left the house (had to make sure they wouldn't kill anyone). LOL  They almost didn't make it out of the house.  They are SOOOOOOOOOOO good.  Follow the directions exactly as written.  Mini muffins took about 13 min.  Will be making these again later this week for a bake sale.

I've tried many zucchini muffin recipes and this is by far the best.  I left out the pecans and added 1/2 cup extra blueberries and blackberries.  Also did 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 olive oil instead of the full olive oil amount.

Excellent Recipe! Will definitely make these muffins again! I just love using the Zucchini out of my own garden and my boyfriends dad gave us blueberry's from his blueberry bushes. Yum! A few changes... I did not add any salt (no need for it) and I also did not put quite a 1/2 cup of sugar (no need for so much sugar in recipes) It only took these little muffins about 18 minutes to bake and with add a bit more Zucchini they turned out delicious! Hope this review helps!

These are very good!  I did not measure the amount of zucchini I used because I had some leftover shredded from another recipe and just dumped all of it in.  I think it was about one cup.  I did put it in a colander for a bit to drain some liquid.  I only made one change which was using walnuts instead of pecans but only because the walnuts were on top in my freezer.  They did bake about 30 minutes total.  When I have zucchini again, I will make these again!

Wow this is the perfect muffin....perfect texture and all the flavours meld together to create an amazing taste.   I can't keep them more than an hour after baking as family and guests have them eaten and ask when more will be made or ready!  Truly a keeper!  After using olive oil in recipe as it calls for  I prefer any veggie (canola ect) oil in place of.   I never did understand why a baking recipe calls for olive oil (let me know)....changes the taste as most olive oil overpowers the flavour.....definitely don't use olive oil in place of regular oil in biscuits, I learned the hard way when I didn't have any veggie oil left and tried olive oil.

These are amazing!  Super moist and delicious!  My daughter is allergic to eggs and milk so I substituted the egg with flax seed/water and used her milk.  She doesn't like super sweet foods and she loved these! So happy!  Thanks for sharing! I will be adding this to my favorites! :)

These muffins were awesome! I didn't have any brown sugar, so I only made these with the 1/2 cup of white. I think they tasted just fine with less sugar. I'll definitely make these again - what a great way to use up all the extra zucchinis I have kickin' around :)

These are fantastic.  I just tried this recipe to use up a large zucchini and some blueberries that I had in the fridge.  And it turned out so delicious.   I didn't replace the oil with applesauce even though I usually would.  I did put just a bit less sugar than the recipe calls for because that is our habit.  I had somewhat more zucchini and blueberry than the recipe specified and even added a small carrot shredded.  It still came out good with all that extra produce.

These muffins are seriously good! They have a wonderful texture and are not too sweet. I made a few minor changes and here they are. I used all brown sugar and only 1/2 cup. I didn't have any pecans so I used double+ the amount of  walnut halves. I love the big crunch you get with them. I used frozen blueberries. After they were all mixed up the batter seemed almost too thick so I added a bit more milk. Of course, that meant they needed to bake a bit longer too. Their tender texture made them a bit more difficult to remove from the pan but I noticed that the last ones I removed came out better than the first so next time I think I will leave them in the pan for a few minutes before running the knife around the inside of the cups and taking them out. Those changes are so insignificant that I don't feel bad at all for still rating these 5 star muffins. Yummmmmmy!!!!! Note: I have made these a number of times with different nuts and fruits and dried fruit and each time they turn out awesome. If I use frozen zuke then the mixture is runny so I toss in enough oatmeal to make the batter a thicker consistency. Still yummmmmo!!!!!

I didn't have time to make this as written before making the changes I knew I wanted. I read several reviews and made a few changes of my own, and am quite pleased with the results. I was looking for a low fat, low sugar, healthy muffin instead of a cupcake masquerading as a muffin. I used whole wheat flour, subbed unsweetened applesauce for the oil, finely grated the zucchini and squeezed the extra water out of it, completely left out the white sugar (accidentally the first time, intentionally the second time), and used a heaping 1/2 cup of blueberries. I am very pleased with the result- a tender, healthy muffin with just the right amount of sweet. I'm going to try freezing them to keep them longer, and take them out as I want them.  I will definitely be making these again.

I LOVE this recipe.  Moist and delicious, and almost anything can be thrown in or substituted for the blueberries/pecans- walnuts, coconut flakes, sunflower seeds, chocolate chips... Thank you for sharing!

Fantastic favor!! The muffins are very moist with the hint of cinnamon favor which I loved. Did not add the pecan, my husband doesn't like them. I plan to make these again.

I added shredded carrot instead of blueberries and only a 1/3 cup of white sugar. They were delicious!  Can't beat a warm muffin with a little bit if butter with a nice cup of tea; sublime!

Delicious and moist. I used applesauce instead of oil (don't ever use olive oil in baking anyway -- yuck!) Next time I'll double the blueberries too.

I did make several changes.  Made Mini muffins instead of full size. Baked at 350 for 10 minutes.  Left out pecans, doubled blueberries and replaced 1/2 of oil with apple sauce and 1/2 with peanut oil.

I made it dairy free and whole wheat, and I lowered the glycemic index with the following substitutions: almond milk, whole wheat flour, Swerve (for granulated sugar), & organic brown coconut sugar. It’s still quite good! I’d probably give my version a 4.5/5, but I’m sure the original would’ve been a 5. Delicious,

Excellent recipe ... only change was that I used 1/2 wholegrain flour ... needed nothing else changed.  Brought them to a family get together and not one was left (doubled the recipe too).  Thanx for sharing.

Out of this world good!  I found some cinnamon chips in my pantry, so instead of adding cinnamon, I added 1/4 cup of these.  They were intended to be breakfast for the next morning; Out of the 15 miffins, there were only six left by bedtime.

I wasn't sure about this recipe when I saw it, but I figured it had 5 stars so I'd give it a try. These are AMAZING! I took the advice of another reviewer and put some apple crisp topping on it before I baked it. I also doubled the blueberries because my husband loves them. Mine baked for about 22 minutes before they were done. Next time I'll probably put 1 1/2 to 2 cups of blueberries in it bc the last few muffins didn't have any.

I made it this morning for breakfast and it came out great. I was looking for recipies that did not involve squeezing out the zucchini and this worked great. I made two changes however. 1. Reduced white sugar to 1/3 cup instead of 1/2 and 
2. Substituted 1/2 cup oil with 1/2 cup mashed up banana and 1/4 cup oil.

I am NOT a fan of zucchini, and usually not a big fan of muffins, but these are absolutely great!!  I noticed another reviewer remarked about them being greasy.  When I first took them out of the pan they seemed a bit oily, but they had no oily taste, and after sitting a bit just seemed very moist and very flavorful.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious!  I doubled the blueberries & subbed a banana for the olive oil to use an old one, plus added some wheat germ for chewiness & threw in a purple carrot to match the purple blueberries' antioxidants.  The increased wet seemed to balance the dry because they were perfectly moist & fluffy.  Very tasty & my veggie-hating SO had a bite unawares... he loved it.  Even after I told him it had zucchini & carrot.  Perfect healthier muffin!  My new go-to blueberry muffin.  I fully expect without my changes these will still be delish!  I just had stuff to use up.

I made these muffins exactly according to the recipe and they are awesome! My husband loves them and I've made them multiple times since. I use a jumbo muffin tin and cook them the full 25 mins and they turn out perfectly. Seems like the type of recipe where you could easily substitute other nuts or fruit if you want to mix things up.

My whole family LOVED this recipe. I did as a few others suggested and added a bit of nutmeg to go with the cinnamon and I used Saskatoons instead of blueberries. I really don't want to mess with it much more because it is probably the best muffin I have ever had.

I have never made homemade blueberry muffins before I tried this recipe! I will be making them again. The only changes I made were to use 1/4 C Canola Oil in place of the olive oil and I only used 1/4 C white sugar instead of 1/2 C. They were great! Sweet enough! I also added a few extra blueberries

A definite winner!  Here's how I made it gluten free and a little healthier:
I replaced the flour with 1/2 C Almond Flour, 1 C Oat Flour, and a tsp of xanthan gum.  I also added 1/4 C of ground flax seed to the dry ingredients.  The first time I made this recipe I thought they were pretty sweet, so the second time I reduced the white sugar to 1/4 cup and it's definitely still plenty sweet.  The last change I made was to swap the olive oil with coconut oil.  That doesn't necessarily change the fat or calories, I just really like the flavor of coconut oil in baked goods.  Both times I made this my family and guests gobbled them up. I suggest doubling the batch and freezing them if you want some for yourself!

Excellent! Made them yesterday and they're gone already!  Always sub applesauce for oil, besides followed exactly. May try less sugar next time. Not cause they're too sweet, just always trying to cut back. I'll be making a second batch today!  Thx for a great recipe!

Just made these today as stated with one exception...ran out of milk this morning but has some heavy cream so I used that!  The muffins turned out fabulous!  My husband thought they were great too and he isn't even a zucchini fan!  Very moist and flavorful.  They didn't rise a ton so I made a 2nd batch and filled the muffin cups up to almost full.  Will definitely be making these again!

Made it without the pecans , but otherwise as is. Muffins came out moist, light and not too sweet. They were so delicious that I made another double batch two days later to bring to the office.

Excellent! I made it healthier by using white whole wheat flour, reducing white sugar by half, and applesauce for most of the oil - kept about 3 T of olive oil for a double batch. I used 1 cup blueberries for the first 12 muffins and mini chocolate chips for the  other 12. Both were delicious and gobbled up by kids!

I totally changed this recipe, but used it as a base anyway.  Used whole wheat white flour, switched the sugars - used 1/2 cup of brown and 1/4 cup of white, used canola instead of olive oil and reduced the amount, as I used two very ripe bananas instead of the milk and part of the oil, then used walnuts instead of pecans.  Used a generous cup of zucchini.  Maybe not the author's recipe, but boy were they delicious!!

Moist and delicious.  Healthy too.  35 minutes is a bit of an underestimation.  More like 60 min total with prep.   The only sub I made:  Instead of 1/2 c. oil, I used 1/4 c. apple sauce and 1/4 c. oil.  So yummy.

Made this recipe for a Ladies' Breakfast.  Huge hit!  
Substitutions- vanilla almond milk instead of regular milk to keep it dairy free and slivered almonds instead of pecans just because I didn't have pecans.  Yum!

Delicious!  I tried the recipe with blueberries and then again with raspberries.  The raspberries add a subtler fruit flavor, but they are still so delicious!

This recipe provides a good base and can be adapted quite a bit. I ended up substituting grated zucchini for apple sauce and plain yogurt instead of milk and ended up with very moist muffins (in a good way).

Such a great recipe and easy to follow. I did substitute applesauce for some of the oil and I used Greek Yogurt instead of milk. I also used fresh cranberries instead of blueberries and then topped them with a mandarin orange glaze. These turned out great!

I’ve followed it exactly as written, except for the nuts. To me those are always optional.   Anyway, this time I used some frozen, shredded zucchini. I didn’t remove the liquid, just mixed it in with the zucchini as it thawed. Figured it’s the water that was already in the zucchini so why remove it?  The only change was to increase baking time about 5 minutes. I removed them once the toothpick came out clean. They were awesome, moist and delicious.

I loved this muffins. They turned out perfect. Very moist. First batch disappeared very fast and since I had more zucchini on hand, I made a second batch. Awesome snack with a cup of coffee or tea. I saved this recipe in my favourites and will make them again.

Yummy, and easy! I use yellow squash instead of zucchini , and added more blueberries. I also used only 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup apple sauce instead of a full 1/2 cup of oil - but otherwise followed the recipe. It was very easy and my coworkers loved them! Great way to use up my yellow squash!

Wonderful recipe & I loved it. It is perfect just as it is. The  only substitute I made was to use oat milk to make it dairy free. Will now be my go to recipe for my zucchini bounty, along with my zucchini bread & Zucchini pie.

I used walnut milk instead of regular milk. They are quite good but not very sweet. Good grab and go snack. Made a double batch and froze one.

This is excellent!! Since I am diabetic (type 2) I have been using Monk Fruit (white) sugar and Eurythinol (brown) sugar in my recipes. And both work beautifully in this recipe. Just use about 1/8 cup less of them than you would regular sugar. They are that sweet. I'll make this recipe again in the future.

Excellent zucchini recipe that doesn’t have as much sugar as most others I’ve seen. I did cut it back a bit further though and they were still moist and delicious with just the right amount of sweetness. This is now my go to zucchini muffin recipe!

I used your recipe as a guide to go a little crazy and try some new things. I took advice from others comments. 
I used...
1 cup oatmeal (ground in food processor)
1 cup almonds (ground in food processor)
1/4 cup monkfruit sugar
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup applesauce
5 oz Greek yogurt (stolen from my daughter's stash??)
1 tbsp chia seeds in 3 tbsp water for 15 minutes
1 1/2 tsp vanilla
1 cup shred zucchini
1/2 cup blueberries
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
Surprise MUFFINS!!!!
I love them... They are unique in their own way and I am excited to share them with my husband and get his opinion...
Plus you can eat it raw, cause no eggs!!!

The flavor is very good, but I found the texture too oily. I followed the instructions exactly and made two separate batches: 1 set of cupcakes and 2 set of bars. Both turned out the same: good flavor and slightly oily. They also didn't rise that much. I'm wondering if the instructions meant baking powder and not baking soda. However, I liked the flavor so I'm going to fiddle with it next time and see what happens.

This recipe is amazing! So easy to make and delicious!! 
My kids are allergic to dairy, nuts, and eggs... but the recipe was easily made nut-free and vegan with minor changes. 
Replaced egg with flax egg.
Used oat milk instead of regular, same quantity
Added more blueberries
Added lots of hemp hearts
No other changes. They were moist, fragrant, deliciously spiced!
Will make these again and again.

I just took these out of the oven. I substituted the oil for applesauce and used sour cream instead of milk to add a little richness. The only thing I would do differently is cut back on the cinnamon. I also made these into mini muffins. Yummy bites!

Very moist and tender  light crispiness around the edges made it very good.       I added a heaping 1/4 tsp of Nutmeg (think I'll make it a 1/2 tsp next time)  and canola oil since I only had EVOO, thought may be to strong a flavor.  Next time I  will added a oatmeal crumb topping making it a solid 5 star rating.   It is a keeper for sure!

These muffins turned out AMAZING! Super moist and great flavour! I cut the amount of oil to 1/4 cup and used 3/ 4 cup applesauce. I could have probably taken out the oil altogether 
because even with 1/4 cup oil, the muffin tins were super oily.

Yummy and moist!  I used vanilla Greek yogurt instead of the milk, and also swapped out half the flour for a mixture of whole wheat flour and almond flour.  Didn't have pecans so subbed finely chopped almonds.  Thanks for sharing!

WOW!  These are delicious!  I did use Canola oil in place of the olive oil because my olive oil was extra virgin & was afraid it would be too strong. They turned out great!  I will make these again!

AWESOME!  Made some changes based on other reviewer notes.  Used 1 c white flour and 1/2 c whole wheat.  Added 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  Squeezed the water out of the zucchini, and baked a full 25 minutes.  Made 3 batches with all the zucchini I have, and will freeze 2 batches to enjoy in the future!

These were delicious!    My changes were half canola oil and half unsweetened applesauce, and little less white sugar, twice the blueberries shaken in some flower so they didn’t sink to the bottom, an few shakes of nutmeg and a little extra cinnamon. Also like another baker my zucchini was frozen in 2 cup bags . I thawed it and squeezed the liquid out a bit .  It measured 1 full cup when squeezed. I used chopped walnuts. I also used a streusel topping as suggested...( used Allrecipes crumb topping for pies)...ate 2 before they even cooled...Will make these again for sure.

I added a strudel topping to make these muffin stand out.  I also used an egg replacer since my child has a egg allergy. Since I only had frozen blueberries, I first defrosted the berries, and mixed them with an 1/4 cup flour to help the muffins not get to soggy.  Turned out great!

So good and very moist.  The blueberries kept some of their moisture, not drying out during the baking process which we loved.  I did not include nuts as my family does not like them in their baked goods.   I will be baking another round of these when another zucchini pops up from the garden!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe just became one of my new favorite zucchini bread recipes. I tweaked some of the recipe and it still turned out AMAZING. First, I didnt want to make muffins so I used a couple of small loaf pans. I used both olive oil and regular vegetable oil (Next time I’m either going to use applesauce or mashed up banana). I was apprehensive using the olive oil. Instead of milk (I was all out!) I used half and half. My family loves this recipe. They had one suggestion however, that is, next time I make it to double the recipe hahaha

Loved it...I used my salad spinner for the grated zucchini just to be sure the muffins wouldn't be too soggy and used just a bit less olive oil.  I made one batch and immediately made another because I knew the first one would disappear before I could get a chance to eat a muffin myself!!

Fantastic.  I used more finely shredded zucchini instead of the milk.  Also, I always substitute 1/3 to 1/2 of the white flour with a freshly ground mix of: pecans, almonds, oats, flax.  Adds depth to the flavor but allows the wheat flour to still provide the consistency you want.  Double or even triple the blueberries.

The next time I make these muffins, I will definitely cut back on the oil, maybe increase the milk to make up for it.  They are quite good but there was puddle of oil in each of the muffin cups when I removed the muffins to the cooling rack.  I added a 1/4 tsp nutmeg (excellent suggestion by another reviewer) but otherwise followed the recipe.

We loved these muffins. I did use the applesauce instead of the oil but otherwise, followed the top notch recipe. So moist and flavorful.  Thank you!

These are incredible muffins!  Great for fresh zucchini and blueberries.  They freeze really well.  I like to double the batch and make half of them regular size muffins and half mini muffins.  Makes about 12 regular and 24 mini when doubled.  Bake, then portion to your liking  and freeze.  Great for school year lunches and snacks!   My only change is I use half whole wheat flour and half all purpose, just a personal preference.  Five star either way.

Being a diabetic I made the following substitutions: almond flour for regular, used Truvia brand sugar and stevia blend (cut to 1/4 called for in recipe) for white sugar, 1/2 the amount of brown sugar, and 1/2 the amount of olive oil, and almonds instead of pecans.  Squeezed zucchini really really well as suggested in another review. Baked for 19 minutes.  Cooled on cooling rack.  Yummy and doable for a diabetic.  Next time I am going to try subbing applesauce for the oil.

Love these. Used walnuts and a little less sugar.  A good way to use up all the extra zucchini we have in our garden.  I also got rid of the extra moisture in the zucchini by squeezing it in a paper towel  before adding it to the mixture.

I thought the recipe was just ok. My muffins did turn out quite wet as some reviewers stated. I used apple sauce instead of oil. I think if I were to make these again, I would add 1/2 cup of oats, maybe even some nuts chopped in the food processor. I would also eliminate the milk. I think it is unnecessary and could be the culprit of such a wet muffin.

These are excellent just as written, but I added 1 scoop of unflavored protein powder and reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup. Made them as mini muffins and my family gobbled them up for quick and easy breakfast on the go and as a snack.

Really good!  It was different using olive oil, and it worked very well here. Sometimes I go the apple sauce route, but not this time.  I also squeezed the grated zucchini in paper towels to remove the excess moisture. I cut back a little on each of the sugars with no problem.  I made this into six jumbo muffins, which were done at about 24 min.  I also topped the muffins with a streusel topping which made them even better! Great recipe!  UPDATE 8/8/17: Now that I've had one, I would eliminate the pecans and add more blueberries.

Excellent recipe with tweaks. 
I used applesauce in place of oil, but I always do that with any recipe for baked goods that calls for oil. 
I used almond milk in place of regular milk.
I also added a crumb topping that I made with 3/4 cup of flour,  1 tsp.  cinnamon,  1/4 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  It was the perfect amount for 12 muffins.  
Also,  my oven runs hot and the muffins were perfect after 20 minutes.  
My kids love these.

Omitted white sugar, used only whole wheat flour, substituted applesauce for oil and added a little ground flax and these were still good! Keep a little more sugar if you want them sweet, but I wanted a healthy breakfast muffin and this was perfect.

Made with the olive oil which I cook with all of the time, but never bake with.  Didn't like the taste of olive oil in the muffins. Will replace oil with applesauce or other oil next time.

I have made these 3 times, once following recipe exactly-they didn't rise much, were very dense and seemed oily, good flavor but ugly hockey puck looking things. Another time I used apple sauce instead of oil and Greek yogurt in place of milk-they were a little dry, but better than the original recipe turned out. Can't remember the variations I did the other time and they were even more dry. I love the idea and flavor of this recipe, just can't seem to get them right.

I followed the recipe as is...except adding a few more blueberries and using walnuts since that's what I had. These have a great flavor! My only complaint was how greasy they were. I will cut the amount of oil next time, but I will definitely make them again.

These are wonderful!  I'm making them for a second time today.  I may cut back on the sugar a little this time, and will use light brown sugar instead of dark.  
I shared a few with others, loved by all!

Really liked these and will make again. I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I might try the suggestions of substituting apple sauce for olive oil.

I used almost two cups of zucchini and more frozen blueberries than what is written. I also used some coconut oil with the olive oil. I did not use nuts as the kids did not want them. These were really good! My five year old several warm ones for breakfast this morning and loves them.

Tasty muffins! Doubled recipe...Followed almost exactly...with these minor changes ...used 1 cup whole wheat flour with white (per double), used half white & half brown sugar, used canola oil & omitted the nuts. Used frozen blueberries. 
Moist, tasty muffins with a slightly crisp/slightly chewy top. Glad I doubled the recipe...my kids love them!

The only change I made was to grind up 1/2 cup of oatmeal in the place of flour.  I love that it has olive oil in it - try to more in my diet.  Love it.

I followed the exact recipe although I baked it in a loaf. 
Unfortunately, blueberries did not go well with zucchini bread. I wish I hadn't put it any blueberries, and this would be delicious!

Great muffins, so easy! I added some extra raspberries. It was a tad too sweet for me so next time I'll reduce the amount of sugar going in by about 1/4 to 1/2 cup.

Great recipe! I don't like very sweet muffins, so I reduced the sugar to a quarter of the indicated amount.  I also used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and used half yogurt/half milk (I found that using all yogurt made the batter too thick).  I also added a bit of flax meal (about 2 tablespoons).  Everyone in my family including my hard-to-please toddler loved them!!!

This recipe makes delicious, moist, flavorful muffins.  I followed the recipe except I used pistachio nuts instead of pecans (just because I love pistachios so much).  I gave some to the children and they, too, said these muffins were very good.

These are pretty good. I made these because we didn't have baking powder so I had to find a recipe with just baking soda. So we used this recipe for blueberry muffins and omitted the zucchini.

My preschooler loved them. We made them together. The recipe was easy and tasty. We added a dash of cadamom, a half teaspoon extra of vanila, a tiny bit of lemon zest, shredded the zucchini fine. Omitted the nuts my kid is allergic. I think they would be tasty with the nuts (maybe another time just for me). Other additives maybe oatmeal to make it a bit heartier or oat bran. maybe some lemon for zest.
Overall I would make it again. A great base to experiment with other fruit, veg and spice combinations.

It doesn't get any easier than this. The first thing that attracted me to this recipe was the simplicity of the ingredients - the 2nd thing was that it only made 12 muffins. Just the right recipe size for my husband and me.  I only made a couple of minor changes -  I used frozen shredded zucchini and  blueberries that I drained some of the juice from before adding it to the batterand I used 1 tsp. of Chinese 5-spice powder instead of the cinnamon and they turned out great!! I have several bags of frozen zucchini in my freezer and now I have a great use for them. Thanks for the recipe!!

These are really tasty and seem healthy. I cut the  white sugar to about 1/4 cup and used wheat pastry flour. I used pepita seeds cause I was all out of regular nuts.

This makes a nice, not overly sweet, breakfast muffin.  I added a full cup of blueberries but omitted the nuts because my daughter doesn’t like them.  I wrung the zucchini in a bar cloth to remove the moisture before adding it to the batter.  Baking time was 30 minutes for me.  Thanks for sharing!

Really good recipe.  I did changes some things around. I used organic coconut oil instead of olive oil; I used almond milk instead of milk, I cut down on the sugars by 1/4 and used walnuts instead of pecans.  This will now be my go-to zucchini muffin recipe.

Super easy to make and delicious results. I followed others' suggestions and used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. Also halved the oil and replaced with unsweetened apple sauce. Used half Greek yogurt and half skim milk. The crunch of the pecans is a nice surprise!

Like others I substituted applesauce for oil and we used stevia instead of white sugar. Great breakfast muffin for the kiddos! My husband even loved eating the batter raw.

Really good and moist! I only changed olive oil to canola oil and halved oil using applesauce instead.
