In "my version" of this popular southern recipe, if you do not use a hand mixer, it is important to use sifted powdered sugar to make sure you have smooth frosting. *Edited to add*: It is also very important to let the caramel cool to lukewarm before adding the powdered sugar, so it can thicken sufficiently. Enjoy.

MMM...delicious frosting. It was perfect in the sweetness department. As it cooled, it took a more pipe-able consistency, which is what I was hoping for (otherwise I would have needed to add extra sugar) It made beautiful roses on my mini chocolate cupcakes. I had to put them in the fridge to hold their shape, but it was perfect. Thanks for sharing! *Update:- I initially put it in the fridge because it was looking pretty glossy, as if it may melt. After leaving it in the fridge for a few hours it hardened nicely. I then decided to leave it out overnight and during most of the day to see if it would hold up and it did! My roses are still looking lovely :).

This is such an easy, yummy frosting recipe! I made it to top some zucchini spice cupcakes...it was super yummy! I didn't have any half-and-half, so I just used milk instead. It turned out perfectly, and looked beautiful on my cupcakes. Thanks for sharing this one!

Ridiculously sweet, and really not my thing... but I made this to top cupcakes for a client...and she said it was delicious and perfect, so there you go! The instructions are well-written, which is helpful. I will add a tip: if you're icing LOTS of cupcakes (I did 4 dozen), part way through icing it will start to crystalize... simply stir in a bit more cream/milk to get the right consistency again and you're good to go!

Made this exactly as written and it was GRITTY. I knew it had something to do with bringing the sugar up to temperature too quickly, and my googling confirmed that. If the sugar granules aren't dissolved before coming to a boil, they will never dissolve. I made it a second time, bringing it up to 250 degrees F slowly and the icing is perfect. But the way this is written did not work for me and there was no fixing it... had to start over. But when I did, it was awesome!

Made exactly as written with no experimentation or variations. Very good taste. The texture is really dependent on cooling the cooked mixture adequately.  I made one batch and thought it was lukewarm when it was not; it went from thin to hard without a good spreading phase in between. For the second try I took a reading with my instant read thermometer and held back on beating until it was just 104 degrees. That batch had a much better spreading consistency. It still tended to want to slide down the sides of the cake and then surface harden fairly quickly, which didn't make for a completely attractive final product.  You can't work and rework the surface like a buttercream. One more thing, it is a heavy icing and needs a sturdy cake to support it. My little yellow cake layers got somewhat compacted under the weight. But we all enjoyed the taste. It never became piping consistency as some others have written, so if that's important to you, think twice about this recipe. Maybe there are some tricks to making it pipe worthy that I just don't know yet.

Outstanding! I followed the recipe exactly (except left out the pecans). It's delicious, creamy and caramelly. Perfect as written. I used it on an apple spice cake. Everyone loved it. Thanks.

Delicious and fudgey just like it's supposed to be! I like this frosting because it can be enjoyed warm and didn't melt into the still-warm cupcakes. Perfect!

This is an excellent departure from the usual buttercream.  I needed a glaze and frosting for my donuts and cupcakes too.  It filled the bill nicely and tasted wonderful.  The brown sugar complemented and tasted wonderful on the applesauce cake and the nutmeg donut!

I forgot to sift the sugar, but it was smooth anyway, It tasted divine! I made a chocolate bunt cake and cut it in half, sliced strawberries and used them along with the yummy frosting to give it a great filling! Thank You Brittany!! Terrific! Will for sure make this again!!

The taste is wonderful, but make sure that you can work quickly. I followed the instructions to a T and unfortunately it got hard rather quickly and made it very difficult to spread onto a layer cake. If anyone has suggestions as to how to make it a little softer I would appreciate it!

I would love to give this recipe 5 stars, but I altered it.


I planned on using this recipe to frost a spice cake.  After making the caramel and tasting it, I found it to be quite sweet.  Adding 2 c. of confectioners' sugar would've made it inedible for my family.  So rather than adding the powdered sugar to make icing, I instead used the caramel as a glaze over the spice cake.

As a glaze, it was fantastic: not too stiff, not too runny, and not unbearably sweet.

I made this recipe to top a 9" x 13" yellow cake as this combo is one of my husband's favorites.  I loved the ease of making this recipe and we both really enjoyed the caramel flavor.

As to frosting, we don't like lots of it so this was perfect for us.  One recipe makes just enough for a a fairly thin layer of frosting on a 9x13 cake.  If you like lots of frosting, I'd suggest halving again or even doubling the recipe.  This one is a keeper.

Used this to top my applesauce cookies.  I make the cookies often, but don't usually frost them.  The family loved them with the frosting, so now I probably will have to make them this way.  Followed the recipe exactly.

My mother's favorite desert is Banana cake with Penuche frosting that she hasn't had since her mother passed.  I made this for her birthday and she was amazed at how close it was to what my grandmother used to make.  Thank you for this recipe.l

Delicious! Used it to frost my sticky toffee pudding cookies. Only change I may make next time is to reduce the amount I put on the cookies....it is VERY SWEET. Had to thin icing slightly with hot water until I got the consistency I wanted, but may use spiced rum next time!

Very yummy; I only made a few changes - 1/3 cup of heavy whipping cream instead of half-n-half & 1/2tsp of vanilla as I didn't want it to take over the flavor. Also I just put the butter in saucepan, melted it added the sugar & stirred well for about a minute & then added the whipping cream & then continue to stir for about 2-3 minutes. Then removed from heat, added the vanilla & salt and transferred to bowl & added the sifted powdered sugar.

This is one of my father-in-law's favorite things and I was really excited to make it for him. I followed the directions exactly and it turned out fantastic! I was a little nervous when it was bubbling up so violently, but it turned out fine. I used my standing mixer to beat in the powdered sugar while the caramel was still a little bit warm. About an hour later I frosted a cake with it, and by the next morning it was perfectly hard and tasty. Thanks so much!

I wanted to halve this recipe to ice half of a 9x13 cake.  Needed to  shorten boiling time of butter and dk. brown sugar to about 90 seconds.  I could tell by the smell that this was necessary, probably because of the reduced amount in the pan.  I also only added 1/2 cup of confectioner's sugar.  The icing set up fine for a sheet cake and was still plenty sweet.

Mine didn't thicken up a lot, but it tasted delicious and was great for frosting the 13x9 molasses cake I made for my husband.  The cake was his Grandma's recipe and he was yearning for a taste of his childhood, but all his aunt could tell me about the frosting was that it was brown sugar and butter.  It didn't turn out to be the same as Grandma's, but his Mom and Aunt said this was better than the original on the cake.

So good.  I've started baking for profit in my neighborhood and had a request for this frosting on cupcakes - it turned out so much better than I thought it would.  Wow.  With white cake cupcakes. Omg. Thank you

I made this for my mom who loves German Chocolate cake but my husband hates coconut. This was the perfect replacement for the traditional frosting. This is a keeper.

I added an extra tablespoon of cocoa to some red velvet cookies and thought a caramel frosting would be a nice change of pace from buttercream.  I chose this recipe because all the others called for heavy cream and I only had 1/2 and 1/2.   Killer combo!!  This was a perfect match for my cookies which got 2-3 grains of sea salt on top as well.  Awesome.

Made a half recipe for ginger snap cookies, but had to add more powder sugar so it was thick enough to spread on cookies.  It was super!!! Will use recipe again!

This recipe is almost identical to one I've been using for years, the notable difference calling for only 2 cups of confectioners sugar (why didn't I think of that?).  It spreads so much easier, tastes the same, and is a favorite on devils food cake.  WONDERFUL!

Made this recipe using light brown sugar (did not have "dark" on hand).  It was fabulous.  While stirring the sugar and butter, I was careful not to scrape the sides of the pan.  When it was finished cooking, I poured the mixture into another bowl.  Let it cool. Beat in the powdered sugar gradually.  It was very creamy and smooth.  Put it on an old fashion banana cake.  Will definitely keep this recipe for other cakes!!! YUM!!

I thougth this was wonderful. A little thin at first but once it was on the Spice Cake and sat a while it was fine.
