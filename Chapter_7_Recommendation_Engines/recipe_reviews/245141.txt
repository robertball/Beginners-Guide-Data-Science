My son wanted orange muffins, I also had 6 clementines that needed to used up,  I chose this recipe for the Allrecipes Allstars Canada April Challenge #ARFaceless.
I used all whole wheat flour, reduced the eggs to 2, used orange juice for the applesauce since I had exactly 2/3 cup after juicing the clementines, use melted butter for the oil, and reduced the leavening to 2 tsps baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda as I am really sensitive to the taste of them.
I made mini muffins, recipe yielded 36 muffins that baked at 425 for 3 minutes and 350 for 9 minutes.
The muffins are very tasty, have a nice crumb and are moist, thanks for a keeper Lindsay :)

Moist and tasty, though very heavy orange flavour. I would cut back on the zest next time and perhaps add a touch of maple syrup or another sweetener. I also grated 1 cup of fresh apple rather than using applesauce.  The texture is really good and the kids love them, so A+ there. I made 36 mini muffins, baked @ 350 for 10 minutes. 
Thank you for sharing this recipe.

VVG.  Nice and light.  I did squeeze the juice from the orange into the batter after I'd zested it.

Didn't need 30 minutes; I took out after 20, but probably could've at 18 minutes.

Used mostly all wheat flour, substituted 3/4 maple syrup for the sugar and used coconut oil instead. I also added chopped, frozen cranberries. I prefer healthier and less sweet muffins and these taste great! Great consistency as well.
