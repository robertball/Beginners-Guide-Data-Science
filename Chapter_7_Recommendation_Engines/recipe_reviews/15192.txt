This is just heavenly. I don't use the almonds, and I spoon plenty of apricot preserves over the brie before wrapping and I think this adds the extra kick it needs. Also, for those of you willing to try, this recipie works well with phyllo dough. Just brush melted butter over top of brie, then add preserves, and wrap in 4 sheets of phyllo that have also been brushed with butter. Trim excess dough and freeze. This is very important and should also be done with the puff pastry version. If you don't freeze, the cheese is completely liquid by the time the dough is done, and so this way they both come out perfect. Bake according to package directions.

This is such a great basic recipe for baked brie. There are some other recipes on this site, but this is the most basic. I've added preserves, dried fruits, and different toasted nuts... all work great. I love brie but the rind always bugged... so I remove it. I know there are some cheese connaisseurs out there who think different. P.S. If your pastry comes out soggy or greasy, you need to up your oven temp to 400 because it means your pastry is melting and not "puffing".

It's essential that you completely enclose the brie in the pastry dough!  Mine must have had a small crack or hole...because when it came out of the oven..all of the brie and almonds had made this lovely crunchy mass next to the puff pastry mound and had left barely anything in the inside of the pastry.  So be sure to close up the holes.  It all tasted really good though...regardless of its fragmented presentation.

This recipe is fabulous!!!  I filled mine with apricot preserves along with the almonds and brushed with egg whites as suggested!  Thank you so much to Veronika for the tip on freezing before cooking!  The pastry came out wonderfully cooked and the cheese was perfect!  This was THE hit of our party!

This is fantastic as a Christmas appetizer. I have made this four times already this month! It is fabulous. I fill the centre with seedless raspberry jam (I put the jam through a sieve) and fresh rasberries.
Once the brie is enveloped with the pastry I brush it with a beaten egg before baking. I also put fresh raspberries on top and serve the whole thing alongside water crackers. YUM. At least a dozen people have already asked for the recipe.

This recipe was wonderful with a couple modifications. I mixed the almonds with an apricot/crushed pineapple sauce I made. Then I added a teaspoon of dijon mustard to the sauce. I used reviewer Veronika's suggestion about freezing it before baking. WOW! It came out looking and tasting so wonderful.Thanks idea Nancy.

Recipe requests started flowing after the first bite!! I used a 14 oz. round of brie, added 1/2 cup pesto and toasted the almonds. The pastry fit perfectly with the larger round of brie. It was impressive in both presentation and flavor. This is a keeper. It looks pretty in a fluted style tart dish.

Awesome recipe!  I used seedless raspberry preserves and toasted slivered almonds, garnishing with fresh raspberries.  It was wonderful and everyone raved about it.  The only thing I would do differently is reduce the amount of puff pastry as I wrap it.  I brushed it with butter, but I think the suggestion to use egg white might work better for me.

Delicious!  I was serving this for a Christmas dinner appetizer and wanted it to look festive.  When I sliced the wheel I spread a generous amount of raspberry preserves and then followed the rest of the recipe. I thought I was taking a chance, but it paid off - I got rave reviews and the entire wheel was gone in no time.

Perfect. I shaved off some of the rind, cut the brie in half, put apricot preserves in middle )like a brie/apricot sandwhich), warpped puff pastry around brie, trimmed extra pastry, used egg white wash all over pastry. Wrapped in plastic wrap and froze for 2 hours. Baked at 425 for 25 mins. Served with crackers, pears, apples, and bread. Made two of them for 12 people and there wasnt a drop left. Huge hit!

This is a party staple for my family and friends. I love to mix it up. Sometimes I do the standard cranberries and apricot preserves, other times I use my food processor for super thin slices of granny smith apples or pears that I fan out over the brie wheel then spoon cranberry whole jelly and almonds. 

For a more savory treat I use saute fresh mushrooms in garlic olive oil with touch of salt and pepper then sprinkle w/ healthy dose of fresh parsley and sprinkle with walnuts. 

This summer I am going to fan out some fresh, thin cut strawberries with some high end strawberry preserves. Then I'm going to use clear and colored red and blue egg wash to do a mock flag on the top of pasty before baking for a 4th of July theme. I have a star shapped cookie cutter so the left over pasty will get cut into star shapes.

For Christmas I always use my snowflake cookie cutter and for Thanksgiving I use some leaves.

This is a good base recipe- take note of suggestions for using the egg whites to seal the pastry. This is a MUST and not an option or you will have a messy presentation. Feel free to add preserves (I tried raspberry) or different nuts (pecans were yummy).You could go with something completely different (I added pesto to another and sprinkled with pine nuts). The key to this recipe is to make it your own by adding what you like and experimenting with new tastes. Remember to serve with a good red wine and you can't go wrong!

This is good, but needs a bit more to it.  When I make it, I don't use almonds, but I put chopped sundried tomatoes and lots of crushed garlic and sometimes some capers.  Serve with a variety of crackers.  This is amazing and everyone always loves it.

I made this last night for a wine tasting party but I did add the apricot jam and it was sooooo good.  As someone else said I made it all up ahead of time and froze it for 2 hours and then baked for 35 min. and let it sit for 45 min, it was perfect.

My guests loved this appetizer.  I cut off ALL the rind, then sliced it in half and filled with raspberry jam and slivered almonds.  I wrapped it up and popped it in the freezer while the puffed pastry thawed (about 20 mins).  Last, I wrapped the cheese in the pastry, brushed with egg wash, and baked for 20 minutes.  Make sure you seal the top very well or it will come open.  Overall, this was delicious and I'll definitely make it again!

I used a can of crescent rolls and raspberry preserves like some people suggested.  I took it to a work Christmas party.  It presented beautifully and tasted equally wonderful and it took just a few minutes.

This was a simple and excellent appetizer, but baking it was a challenge.  I took other reviewers recommendations to “freeze” it before baking, which I did. When I baked it in a very good convection oven, the center was not done. I was forced to “nuke” it for a minute and still returned it to the oven for 5-8 more minutes. The final result was great but the next time I make this, I will “freeze” it for no more than 30 minutes to see how that works and then increase or decrease the “freeze” time accordingly.  There is a very fine line in baking this so it is done in the center but not a gooey mess. Everyone will just have to experiment with their own ovens.  Definitely make a trial run with this before that special dinner party.

Really good! But the only thing  kind of annoying was that after 5 minutes it was still too hot and it oozed everywhere. Nobody seemed to mind though. Served it with crackers and apple slices.

I disagree with the cooking temp on this recipe. After baking at 350 degrees for 20 minutes, my puff pastry still looked raw. I needed to increase the temperature to 475 to roast potatoes, so I moved the brie to the top rack, and after 5 minutes it was perfect, nice and golden brown. Someone had suggested freezing the brie before baking, which I did. for about 20-30 minutes. As we were eating it, I noticed the center was too thick/stiff... it wasn't nice and oozy like the outer parts of the brie were. Maybe putting it in the fridge before baking would have sufficed.

Delicious, especially if you love the rich, creamy flavor that brie has. I followed this recipe except added a layer of apricot preserves on top before wrapping. It was easy to make, and I didn't pay too much attention to looks, but I wish I had. You could really make this a show-stopper appetizer if you took the time to mold it just right. Next time I'll cut the mold or wax (or whatever that outter stuff is on the brie) OFF then put it in. I never like that flavor anyway and it definitely shined through after baking. Just a tip!

This was great!  I used Raspberry preserves when I did it the last time.  That tasted fabulous, but I think I might play around with some other type of preserves or maybe even cranberry chutney!  It was a hit with my friends and so very easy to make.  Thanks!

WOW!!  That's what EVERYONE said.  WOW!  I followed the advice of VERONIKA S and added apricot preserves and brushed the dough with butter before freezing.  We wound up having to bake it for around 30 minutes before it was warm enough inside, but it was worth the wait!

I'm so hooked on this.  I've made it several times.  Change the fruit every time, but always remove the rind.  I've used puff pastry and pie crust.  Prefer the pastry.  Always use the egg wash to hold it together.  I've fiddled with the temp and time just a bit to accomadate my finicky oven.  Easy to do, just watch it.

I used a 19.6 oz wheel that I cut in half, so my end product looked like a calzone, but it still taste great!  I added apricot preserves in addition to the toasted almonds in the middle of the brie.  I also stuck the brie with preserves and almonds in the freezer for about 20 min before wrapping it up in the puff pastry and baking.  I sealed the edges with egg white and brushed a little egg white on top as well.  Baked it at 350 for 15 min in my toaster oven and it was great!

Sorry, I did not like this recipe. Other reviewers loved it, so maybe I didn't do something right.  I thought the rind became somewhat bitter, and the brie was basically runny.

I have made this twice now and really enjoyed it both times. I added fresh raspberries along with the almonds and it made it even more yummy. Be sure to brush butter on the dough before baking if you want a nice golden color - I forgot once and it was not as pretty (although it still tasted fine).

It's a total crowd pleaser!! I often replace the nuts with apple butter, apricot preserves, or mulled strawberries, depending on what's in season. Definitely cut the top square down just enough so it covers the cheese but doesn't overlap much-it keeps it from getting soggy! Serve warm ASAP :)

This is a great basic recipe.  Once I wrap the dough around it, I seal the seam by brushing it with a whipped egg and laying it seam side down to ensure a tight seal.  Then I brush the top with the egg.  I've tried it with rasperry preserves (in addition to toasted sliced almonds), but the second time I used fig preserves and it was even better! There are never any leftovers!

This is amazing. I don't cut the brie in half to add nuts, I just leave it whole and wrap the pastry around it. Also, I use a beaten egg to seal the pastry and put it in the freezer for a couple of hours. However, if you stick it in the freezer, it will need more time in the oven. I had mine in for 40 min.
Will definitely make this again.

Great for dinner parties, and everyone loves it. If you can't find puff pastry at the store, pilsbury crescent roll pastry can be used. Halve it and roll it out so that you can't see any of the speration marks. Place the brie onto one half, then place the other half of the pastry on top and seal together. Brush with egg to give it a nice finish.  Instead of almonds, try using differnets jams to suit the season i.e cranberry for winter, or marmalade. Apple and pear slices work well too.

Tastes great but I used a couple of the other suggestions.  A heaping layer of apricot jam and a generous portion of sliced almonds both in the center and on top of the brie.  When using the puff pastry dough, I found using two cans worked perfectly.  Lay them out and them press the two sides together to make a larger sheet.  After wrapping the dough around the brie, I wrapped the brie very tightly in plastic wrap and then froze it for about 3-4 hours.  It turned out perfectly!  When baking, make sure there are no holes in the pastry!

This is a great way to serve Brie but you definately need to brush the puff pastry with an egg wash or else it just is too dry.  I have tried this several times and the more egg wash I used, the better.

Excellent recipe...just a tip, I brush the pastry with beaten egg wherever I fold it over to seal it, as well as over the top, keeps the cheese inside!

I didn't like this at all, but I thought the cheese itself was disgusting, so maybe it's just me. It had no flavor and just tasted weird.

Delicious! I made this for a Christmas party and it was devoured! As per other suggestions, I froze the brie for 30 minutes to keep it from melting too much and I also added raspberry jam inside with the almonds and garnished with fresh raspberries on top. It was incredible and gobbled up by my guests!  The puff pastry was difficult to work with and get to look pretty, but I think that could just be my lack of experience... Yum! Thanks!

Remember to thaw your puff pastry before you use it! I tried thawing it in the microwave and it ended up messy, but still tasted delicious. I added seedless raspberry preserves and then the almonds. I also brushed an egg white over the puff pastry before I cooked it-just don't use all of it if you don't need it-it will end up tasting slightly egg-y! otherwise, a delicious recipe that everyone was raving about :)

used pillsbury puff pastry, 1 sheet rolled out. used brie from costco. sliced in half added peach jam (didn't have apricot) and sliced almonds. cut off the rind of the brie, wrapped it up. with extra pasty cut out leaf for top. cook on a pan with sides because it leaks a little.  very good, thanksgiving 08.
11/17: I cut the rind off and it oozed all over, keep it on next time.

This is a go-to recipe for me whenever I am asked to bring something to a party.  Its fun to try different variations of filling, I like to use honey and pecans, jam, or chopped apples. Make sure that you seal the seams of the puff pastry very well or cheese will break though while baking and you'll have a mess on your hands.

I've made this a few times now...chucked the almonds and spread the middle with mushroom pesto.  Fabulous!  Have also used olive tapenade.  Compliments galore.  Found that I needed to increase the baking time though.  Check it frequently.  Big payoff for little work -- my favorite kind of dish!

Instead of almonds, I spread raspberry jam and fresh raspberries in the middle of the brie. After it was all baked, I garnished it with more fresh raspberries. Elegant and a HUGE hit at my dinner party!

I make this recipe every year, but instead of almonds, I sauté some chopped walnuts, then add Kahlua to the walnuts & reduce to half to take alcohol out & becomes syrupy. Then I pock holes with a fork and drop the syrup with nuts & let it rest for a while to absorb the syrup, then I wrap the Brie  with Puff Pastry & bake

Yum. I didn't let it sit for 5 minutes before serving, and it oozed out of the shell, but it still tasted good. Will try to freeze it before baking, as recommended. I used almonds, but a layer of cranberries would be a good addition as well.

I made this  on Christmas day and it was so good my son asked me to make it again for New Years.  I added red current jelly to the top before covering.  It was a nice compliment to the cheese because it was not sweet.  To seal I brought the four corners  up and together.  I tucked the dough between the corners up and in and then gave it a gently twist to seal, then spread the top back to open.  It was very pretty.

Fantastic!  Instead of almonds, I used a mixture of sundried tomato spread, a fresh minced clove of garlic and a little bit of minced fresh basil.  I served it as an appetizer at a dinner party last weekend and it was gone in about 15 minutes.

This was the easiest recipe ever! It comes out looking way more fancy and time-consuming than it is. I bought the pepperidge puff pastry sheets and they were fabulous. After cooking it I served it with grapes and it looked elegant and tasted great. I got a lot of compliments on it!

I made this for Christmas and it was a HUGE hit!  I recommend rolling the puff pastry pretty thin, which seems to help it get crispy.  I also used my extra dough to cut out decorative leaves for the top.  I stuffed the brie with toasted almonds and blackberry jelly.  Easy and delicious!

This was a huge hit with all my guests.  I added apricot preserves as others suggested and froze first (also from a tip on this site).  Becuase I had frozen it first it definately took longer to bake but OMG so worth the wait.  I could probably eat the whole thing to myself it was so good!!

This is a party favorite..I do something a little different, that I haven't see on any of these recipes. I heat some cherry pie filling and pour it over the top. It is a crowd favorite. I'm going to try the raspberry preserve version tonight!

Thanks earlier reviewers-Freezing the brie prepared brie prior to baking was a must. I also filled mine with 1/4 cup raspberry preserves, but probably could have used a little more.

Good recipe: a variation that I Made was use raspberry jam, dried cranberries, and walnuts. Cut off sides of rind. Wrap with homemade pie dough (set in center of dough round and gather at top to stop leakage, chill for at least one hour, bake for 15-20 minutes at 400 bake in a fluted tart dish then you can serve it in that... let rest 5 minutes before serving with crackers and fresh fruit slices.

This tasted wonderful, but I had some problems getting the pastry dough to keep together while baking.  Now I just make sure to put it seam side down into a small baking dish so that the dough doesn't have room to spread out during baking.  Once it has time to set and I remove it, it is perfect.

I couldn't decide between almonds and raspberry preserves... so I did one of each.  They were both excellent.  I would say the egg wash is a requirement versus an option, it nicely seals the phyllo dough and prevents "bursts".  It is the cooking trifecta: really easy, tastes great, beautiful presentation.

I really wanted to like this, but the puff pastry never seemed to get crisp & brown, even when I left it in the oven an additional 5 minutes. I enclosed the wheel of brie in the puff pastry - maybe I should have just wrapped the pastry around the sides of the brie? I was very disappointed

We made this for our family Christmas and New Years party. We did not use the nuts but instead we used 1 cup of Apricot Jam. Yes, besure you wrap it very well and that there is no cracks. Some of our cheese did sneak out but there was still enough brie in the pastry. My sister used Phylo dough but it did not look very pretty. We served ours on thinly sliced bagette.

I brush the top of mine with an eggwash (1 egg beaten with a teaspoon of water). It gets lovely and golden brown on top. Be sure to let it cool for around 10 minutes to firm back up.

I combined about a 1/3 cup dried cranberries, 1/4 brown sugar and a little over a 1/3 cup of ground pecans (so it totals about a cup) and spread over the aprroximately 6 inch brie to within about 1/4 inch of the edge....patted it high, then covered with 2nd sheet of puff pastry dough and tucked it well under. Took scraps of dough to make a design on the top. It was a HUGE hit...will be serving it again (and again and again)

I add chopped walnuts and raspberry jam over the brie.  I then brush egg (beaten) over the pastry.  People rave when I bring this to parties and people who have experienced it request that I bring it!  It is SO EASY and have made it 3 times this December due to people's requests!!!

This is excellent but you definitely need to add a preserve of some kind, I did seedless raspberry without almonds because I just don't like nuts in my food. I also made sure the edges were sealed and it didn't leak and did the egg wash over the top with some cut out shapes, it looked and tasted marvelous!

Oh so good!  I cut my Brie cheese in half and put a couple tablespoons of pesto in the middle of it before wrapping it up and baking it.  It did need to be cooked a little longer than stated but it was a big hit!  Also, make sure to serve it hot.  It really loses it's wow after it cools off.

This was a big hit at my parent's 55th anniversary party.  For some reason my pastry didn't brown as nice as I would have liked, but I think that is the fault of the very old oven I had to use.  I sliced the brie in half and put triple fruit jam in between and served it with crackers, anjou pears and granny smith apples.  Everyone complimented me on the elegant appetizer.

This is a great base recipe.  I recommend baking the brie with 1/4 cup brown sugar and a handful of walnuts.  Also, to make presentation a little more appealing, brush the puff pastry with a beaten egg to add shine.  Best if served fresh from the oven.

This gets 4 stars with revisions. Novice cooks don't need to shy away from it.  I made one with raspberry and one with apricot for my husband. We thought the raspberry overwhelmed the delicate brie, but the apricot was good.  Bake at 400 degrees, not 350. I froze it as others recommended, but the brie was not "gooey" enough for me, and I think the freezing affected that.  I'll bake mine longer and not freeze it. I'll make it for T-giving, but use shiitake mushrooms sauteed in butter instead of the preserves.

It came out beautifully golden! I used egg whites on the top and instead of just having crackers on the side i found it was amazing with berries, grapes, bread, powdered sugar and a cranberry sauce on the side.  This dish was great for dipping in a party scenario.  To be served as an appetizer i used pesto, olive oil, pine nuts, basil and black pepper.  It is always a hit, and like all cheese it tastes great with a large glass of red.

I served this last night and it was gone in about 5 minutes. I should have made two!  The only thing I did different was to brown the almonds in a little butter before placing them in the brie.  Awesome recipe!

Of course, I changed this a bit. I halved the brie/camembert or whatever soft round cheese you have, and put fried sun dried tomatoes and garlic on one half, and hot peper jelly on the other. People were going NUTS over it, and do yourself a favour, just bring the recipe with you. It willsaveyou time!!

Forget it!  No taste.  Very bland.  I should have read previous reviewers first and used their suggestions about adding something "tasty."  Will not try this again...not even to the tune of half the price!

What an easy and impressive appetizer -- I always get compliments whenever I make this recipe and ususally end up having to copy the recipe out for someone.  I substitute jam (whatever kind is open in the fridge) for the almonds.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm giving this 3 stars only in that it took FOREVER to brown and cook!!!! After the recommended 15-20 mins it still looked like raw dough!! I'd say it took almost an hour to cook/ brown.  I did the egg wash and everything.  It did leak a tad in about the last 5 mins. The taste, however, was delicious!!! I would make it again but maybe turn the oven to 400. 
I did put the wrapped Brie on parchment paper.  Do you suppose this would make it cook slower.

Great recipe.  Next time I will cut some of the rind off of the brie (maybe at least the top?)  It seemed to overwhelm the pastry slightly.  Also, along with the almonds I added dried, tart cherries.  I don't think you can add too many!

I've made this baked brie twice now - and it's been a big hit both times. This recipe is super easy too. 
I've used puff pastry sheets, thawed them out and rolled them out with a rolling pin. I find the sheets that I use to be a tad small for the baked brie rounds that I buy. Also, I've cut the brie round in half as advised in the recipe and used apricot jam and almonds in the middle. Minor tip - spread the jam first then add the almonds. One of those things I didn't think through the first time. I also tied up the loose ends with a piece of twine, that way it kept its shape while baking. All in all, a really great recipe.

Didn't push egg white on pastry but will try that next time.  I froze the brie + pastry combination and then baked it at 400degreeC for 15min.  Turned out well.

My favorite is to slice the brie in half and fill with rasperry preserves (seedless).  Excellent - and the perfect appetizer with granny smith apples and pears - there will be nothing left!

Love this recipe!  I left out the almonds but used raspberry preserves and raisens.  I usually HATE the rind, but I didn't mind it at all when cooked!  I used just half a sheet of puff pastry and froze the cheese/pastry before putting it in the oven.  Will definitely be making this again.

Made this for a baby shower.  Added strawberry jam and served with fresh strawberries (no crackers).  It had cooled too much by the time we ate it, but that actually made it easier to slice and serve than I expected it would be.  Everyone raved about it!  Will definitely make again.

This was so easy and tasted great.  I sliced the brie in half, spread blackberry preserve, then almonds.  Used others advice and brushed pastry with egg to seal and it came out beautifully. 
Made this again recently: did one with boursin in the middle and one with choped prunes and figs.  Both great

Rather then use the almonds, I went for olive oil and basil.  I made it for a wine tasting party and it got RAVE reviews.  One person even called and wanted the recipe. I, personally thought it was good but not great.  Of course, any cheese goes good with wine.

This was tasty - I used raspberry jam as well as almonds.  I found that it could have used more baking time.  The puff pastry was a little doughy.  Next time I will watch and make sure it gets crispy and golden brown.

Loved it....if you are a Brie fan...this is great. And the almonds add a nice crunch.

Made this last night, I didn't use almonds, I spread Mango Chutney in the middle of it and then wrapped it with cresent dough.  Very easy and tasty although I think I am going to continue to experiment with this some more, it needed a little zing.  I also had to cook it longer then the recipe, when I cut into it the cheese was still cold, so I actually ended up baking this for about 30-35 minutes.  Nice appetizer overall though.

I added fresh raspberries and almonds, but it needed more. It was a little bland. Next time I'll try the preserves in the middle.

I served this, with the Appricot preseves but the filling ran out of the brie, so I think next time I need to wrapp it better. The guests seem to like it OK.

Fast, easy and elegant appetizer.  Delicious and fairly inexpensive.  Easy recipe to build on and add your own touches like sun dried tomatoes, pesto, walnuts or those new flavored almonds.  We loved it!

Fancy, easy app. Can make with any preserve. I did raspberry. Try peach or apricot next time. You must freeze. Wash with egg white before cooking.

This a good basic recipe that you can elaborate as you wish.  I had homemade Peach Amaretto Pecan preserves, so I cut the brie in half horizontally and put that in the middle and also on top and added toasted pecans before wrapping it in the puff pastry.   A WINNER!

Good start for a recipe. I usually add brown sugar and cranberries to the almonds and dust the puff pastry with butter and egg white as previously recommended. Turns out delicious!!

I found myself asking why do this when you can buy it already covered in pastry and just heat it up?  It didn't taste any better - I wasn't impressed.  Gave it three stars b/c I guess not everyone has pastry covered brie ready in their local grocery store.

This was a hit.  I sliced horizontally and added blackberry seedless preserves and sliced almonds. As others have mentioned I used crescent roll dough and created a heart shape with the extras and placed on top since this was for an anniversary dinner.  So good, easy and everyone thought it was great!

This was very good. My dad gave this 3 stars but I was hungry so I gave it 4! I would definitely add apricot preserves. I wasn't too sure about eating the rind of the Brie but otherwise it was very good.

I've made this several times for different parties and each time everyone gobbles it down. I brought it to a family gathering and a party with friends and all crowds raved. I've done this recipe with just the cheese as well as with raspberry preserves and another one with sliced almonds. All are great. I like serving it with sliced green apples!

Delicious!! I used apricot preserves and almonds in the brie and wrapped in in crescent roll dough...next time I will use the puff pastry because the crescent roll dough was VERY hard to work with, and there were so many seams...that is the one thing that I would definatley reccommend-make sure you do not have any cracks in whatever you are wrapping the brie in...a bit of my cheese oozed out, but it was no big deal...will definately make again many times!!

Great recipe.  Easy and elegant.  I ended up using 2 4.4oz size brie instead of the 8 oz.  I added honey to the almonds for one and raspberry preserves to the other.  Flavor was great for both.  I used the egg wash to seal and also put in the freezer prior to baking.  I ended up baking at 375.

This was quite tasty.  I served it with a reduction of raspberry lambic and pecans and it was a hit.  Unfortunately, some of the cheese ran out of the side for some reason and made it look a bit messy but it was a good dish nonetheless.

I made this for a baby shower and it was a huge hit!  It was devoured!  My husband was hoping there would be leftovers, but there were none!!!

I love this recipe!  Another good variation is to use some type of jam, raspberry or strawberry works well!

I served this with the almonds as well as fresh raspberries inside of the pasrty.  It tasted wonderful and the presentation was elegant!  I will serve this dish again!  Next time I plan to replace the raspberries with tart green apples.

Brought to a party, great reviews. I sautéed apples and pears in butter and sugar. Placed on Brie and covered in pastry. Delicious but the some of the cheese spilled out. Next time I will put the Brie in the freezer for a bit so the crust and cheese cook at the same rate.

I made two of these for a Church Christmas party and everyone was so excited to try it. Both were gone in about 15 minutes! I made one with raspberry and the other with apricot jelly. I thought they were pretty good but NOBODY else said if they liked them or not.  Usually people at the Church will go on and on if they like something but not a peep out of them on this recipe. Oh well, back to the drawing board. This was super easy to make though and the presentation is easy.

This was delicious, but I made a few changes.  I toasted the almond first, added dried cranberries to the filling.  I also stuck it in the freezer for 1 hour before baking it so the brie & filling wouldn't seep out of the crust.  It turned out awesome!!

Easy and so delicious!  Because I live at high altitude and also had it pre-prepared it in the fridge, my bake time was about 40 minutes, but it still turned out perfect!  I used the President brand round brie, perfect size and consistency once baked.

This is a good simple recipe. You can prepare it the night before a special dinner. I refrigerated the prepared Brie puff overnight and baked it right before serving.

Yum!  I did read the reviews and did the following - froze brie for 30 minutes prior, added raspberry preserves, completely seal pastry, used the trimmings to cut shape for top, brushed with egg whites, upped oven to 400 for about 30 minutes.  Thanks for sharing - easy app for party!

I added honey on top of the cheese and on top of the puff pastry after I closed it up. The only thing is, it took longer to cook for me.  I wanted the golden brown top and I don't think the puff pastry cooked all the way through.  I will make again for sure.  I had too much in the oven and I think the Brie needed to be at a higher temp.

This recipe is delicious. We added salt in between the Bree. It was very good, and we served it as a poolside snack. Definitely would have it again.

I brought this to a memorial day party and everyone loved it! So yummy, a very sweet and savory appetizer. I highly recommend spreading about 2 Tbsp. of apricot preserves and sprinkling almonds on the brie prior to wrapping it with the crescent rolls.  Enjoy!

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and mother last week.  I didn't have any puff pastry, so I substituted Phyllo pastry which seemed to work just fine.  I made one small round with raspberry jam in it, and a second larger round with just almonds.

Since there were less people then expected, I gave my mom the entire raspberry round, and told her just to eat as much as she wanted.  After going on about how it was "WAAAY too much for her" she ate the entire thing!  Similiarly, my boyfriend ate his entire half of the almond round, and then took the rest of my portion!  He said it was the best thing I've ever made.  I will be making this recipe again this week, by request.

This was delicious and my guests really enjoyed it. 
The next time I make this I will be sure not to over cook it. 
I left this in the oven for too long which caused the cheese to melt too much. I had to put it in the refrigerator to get it to solidify enough so that it could be cut. 
Also, after the cheese cooled, I spread a roasted onion and garlic jam on the top, it was a great!
