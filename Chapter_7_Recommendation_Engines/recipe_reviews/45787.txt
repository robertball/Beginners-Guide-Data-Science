I've made this recipe in the past and it turns out great!  I use either raspberry or strawberry jello and no one can tell that it's made with green tomatoes.  Instead of freezing the jam I process my jars in a boiling-water canner for 10-15 minutes.

I made this recipe using sugar-free cherry gelatin and Splenda. It was very good. Had the ladies at work sample without telling them the ingredients---they were pleasantly surprised.

This jam is great!  A very pleasant surprise!  Try it if you have some green tomatos - you won't be sorry.

I just made this and am pretty surprised with the taste. I thought it would have some tomato taste to it but none at all. I did cut it down to 8 serving to try at first and I used cherry jello. I added sugar to it and it turned out really sweet but still good, I made a second 8serving batch and did not add the sugar and that turned out MUCH better. I will be using this recipe again, thank you.

Delicious.  Perfect use of too many end of season green tomatoes.  I used the called for amount of sugar, but used sugar-free gelatin....perfect.  Absolutely delicious!

This really works, and it's delicious.  The tomatoes I used the second time were probably 2/3 of the way ripe, and it still worked great!  I will use this recipe for my green tomatoes for years to come!

I made 12 batches of this jam!!  I had a LOT of green tomatoes to use!  But, I am wondering if anyone can tell me why about half of the batches didn't set, they are ice cream topping consistency??  The first time I didn't do a single batch, so I thought maybe that was why .. but I did ALL the rest one by one, canning them in water bath for 15 minutes and then each time starting the process completely over.  I have a flat top stove, so it is REALLY hard to keep the temperature perfect - especially if you are using more than one burner - the whole thing is just hot!  I cleaned/cut bad spots from tomatoes, put them in the blender (skin, seeds & all) then cooked them with the sugar for 20 minutes, then added the jello & then did the canning process.  Any suggestions?  I used Jello brand jello - the regular/original kind.  Strawberry & Raspberry flavors.  I'm still excited none the less, just wondering if anyone has some helpful hints!  I wasn't exactly sure how to get tomato pulp - was putting them in the blender right or wrong?  Please & thank you for any and all helpful pieces of advice! :)

This is a geat recipe! My family of 8 goes through a jar of jam a sitting ....or almost, and it has become very expensive. The kids are not very picky when it comes to anything sweet so they really enjoyed the jam, not to say that it isn't good, because it is remarkeably tasty, but obviously it is what it is-not the real thing(can anything beat homemade raspberry/strawberry jam with chunks of fruit?). I did fool a lot of people who thought that it was authentic. I cut the sugar by LESS than half and it was still very sweet. I have tried this with every variety of gelatin and the berries are the best in my opinion. I sometimes throw in a hand of sliced real berries to give even more of an effect.  I will be using this recipe again! Thanks!

Looking for a way to use up green tomatoes in our garden, I came across this recipe.  I made a half batch first with raspberry jam and another half batch with strawberry jam.  It is good, but my family could tell it was not my regular freezer jam.  It comes together very quickly and is very simple to make.  I just threw the tomatoes in my food processor to pulp them.  I did use sugar-free gelatin as that is what I always have on-hand.  Very cheap to make if you have the green tomatoes just sitting in your garden.  Thanks for sharing this recipe SUZQ.

Made this according to the recipe and it was good.  A pleasant suprise althought not as good as regular jam w/fruit it was still good. Don't be discouraged the end product is much better than it smells or looks during the process!  I used a combination of strawberry and raspberry together and then another batch with cranberry, strawberry and blackberry.

Miranda628- One suggestion about the runny consistency could be because of using the tomatoes seeds and skin in your pulp. Blanch the tomatoes and remove the skin and take out all seeds inside. Your jam may set better because there is not excess liquid. Hopefully this helps because this looks like an awesome recipe and I can not wait to try it.

Of course it's not the real thing, but for what it is, left over green tomatoes from the garden, it is fantastic. I used some in a berry vinaigrette for salad, and it was very good. My son enjoyed it very much as well, on bread as a jam.  Thank-you for giving me a way to take something useless and make it into something usable.

I would guess that the jam that doesn't set up didn't have the jello completely dissolved, time how long you stir the jello, go at least 4 minutes, maybe five.  This is the only way my kids will eat tomatoes from our garden.  although it doesn't taste like real fruit jam, it is perfect for kids.

I have a bunch of green tomatoes and saw this recipe so I thought I'd give it a shot. I've never made jams or jellies before and this recipe was very simple and had great success. It is a little on the sweet side but then isn't that how jelly should be? A recent reviewer commented on how her jelly had turned out runny. It may be that there was too much liquid from the tomatoes after processing. I drained the liquid after chopping the tomatoes in the food processor so that all I was left with was true pulp. I made the mistake of adding my gelatin with the sugar instead of at the end. It still jelled, thank goodness. Anyway, a great recipe if you've never made jams or jellies before and want to give it a try.

Had a mountain of green tomatoes so tripled the recipe and added about 3 cups of frozen mixed berries but 1/2 the sugar.   Looks and tastes like strawberry rhubarb jam.    Family fooled!   Will definitely use this each fall for excess green tomatoes.

Tasted almost like strawberry jam except it had way to many seeds. But it is quick and easy and a very good way to use all those green tomatoes.

I cooked my tomatoes first until completely soft and then strained them. Added only 3 1/2 cups sugar (will reduce to 3 next time) to my pulp and followed directions from there. 7 pints of delicious strawberry jam. AND a great way to use those green tomatoes.

Just got through making this for the second time and love it, love it, love it!!  I always use raspberry jello.  I tried strawberry, but it didn't have near the flavor of the raspberry.

Very easy to make. I did use half the sugar and it turned out good. Good way to use green tomatoes and I agree the berry kinds are best.
