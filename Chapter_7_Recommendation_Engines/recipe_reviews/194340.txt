This pie is sooo good and it looks really pretty when you cut it open.  I made some changes though.  I thought there was way too much fat, so I used fat free cream cheese and fat free cool whip and then used sugar free lemon jello and reduced-fat graham cracker crust. Not only was this just as good it cuts the calories in half and the fat down to almost nothing!

This was a good pie! I didn't like that it was SOOO lemony. So the next ime I made it I changed some things. I used peach jello instead of lemon and I used white grape peach juice concentrate instead of lemonade. I also used a mixture of peaches, strawberries, and raspberries, and added the zest of one lemon. Okay so I changed it completely! But let me tell you, the family reunion I went to with these pies in tow, was buzzing with compliments for the final product.

This is easy to do, and almost everyone likes it.  I have a couple of friends that don't like lemon, which it very much is.  I have put fresh blueberries in this too and it went over well.

Absolutely melt in your mouth delicious. A bit lemony at first, but it worked great with the raspberries. You could even do mix and match with the fruits too. Maybe cherry for the blend with blueberries for the whole fruit. 6/1 I tried this with blueberries for the fruit, cherry Jello, and Pomegranate/cranberry concentrate, and it was fantastic.

Easy recipe. Fun to do with the kids too. We do not like raspberries, so we used strawberries instead.

Delicious! The only thing I would change is to add the raspberries last- otherwise they sink to the bottom of the bowl and all end up in one pie. After adding them, I used a spoon to hide them under the filling. This pie was really popular at our Memorial Day cook-out :-)
Also- my friend and I used red, golden, and black raspberries. It was a HUGE success!

I substituted 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese and used raspberry-lemonade concentrate. It came out great! In the future, I may get more creative with the gelatin/fruit/juice combinations. This recipe is super easy and great for summer. I'll definitely make this again.

I halved the recipe to make only one pie - it was a big hit!  I did use raspberry lemonade as another recommended.  I will make this again.

Very easy to make and it was a big hit. My family gobbled it up. I found the lemon flavor to be perfect, and not too strong as others found. We used fresh raspberries from our yard.

Very awesome! I made it for memorial day and was so blown away that I forgot to rate it. It keeps very well (we had it in our cooler when we went to the lake) and it's just the right amount of sweet and tangy. Mine did not look like the photo (more pink-ish). Save some raspberries to put on top for a garnish! Like the last commenter, I didn't use all the lemonade concentrate.

Mine did not look like the picture. I did not like the jello texture and how the cream cheese and cool whip looked and tasted when they were put with the jello mixture.

The taste of this pie is amazing! However, I don't know what I did wrong, but it didn't seem to set right. I followed the directions to a T. Will try again though! ETA 6/2-- Made this again last night with fresh strawberries instead of frozen raspberries. Cut into it today and it seemed to have set a LITTLE bit better. Not much. It's definately not so tart with the strawberries instead of raspberries.

This pie was excellent. I didn't make any changes to the recipe and it came out light, fluffy and delicious! If I had to describe this dessert in one word I would say zingy! I have never made a pie with gelatin before and I was a little worried how it would set but it came out perfectly. It has the creaminess of a cheesecake and the lightness of a meringue, add in the sweet bubbly tart of the lemonade, and you have this wonderful spring/summer pie. Plus it looks really pretty with the raspberries. My boyfriend couldn't get enough! I will definitely be making this again!

This was pretty good.  I didn't find it to be too sour or too sweet.  I used frozen raspberries rather than fresh.  I also used lite Cool Whip and sugar free Jello.  It took greater than 4 hours for this pie to set.  I plan on making this again with blueberries rather than raspberries.

I made this for a picnic and it was delicious, but pretty tart. I tried it again with only half of the Jell-O packet, added a cup of sugar, and used a cup and a half of strawberries instead of raspberries.

This was really refreshing. I have been watching my calories, so I used low fat cream cheese and coolwhip. I also used raspberry lemonade concentrate. It was great for a tart treat to have after dinner and not feel guilty for eating a dessert. I also like it better frozen because I am a texture person and I prefer it harder than soft. Overall great recipe if you like tartness.

It was easy and quick to make, and was delicious! Also works with other fruits, I've used blueberries and strawberries. But the raspberries work best with the lemony taste.

Very easy and good on a hot day.  I thought it looked a little bland by itself in the pan so I made a quick raspberry coulis to serve over top.  (bunch of raspberries, couple spoons of icing sugar and a big squeeze of lemon juice in the blender)

This was not to my liking. Directions were followed to a "T" and the top was lumpy/gritty.

Really good and easy to make pie.  The only thing I changed was that I used fresh strawberries rather than raspberries simply because of the availability of them in our store.

We made this pie yesterday for our family gathering. Everyone really loved it. My boyfriend isn’t a fan of tart and sour things and he even enjoyed it. We did run into a problem though as we finished the pie. We had a problem getting it to set right. It was in the refrigerator for more than four hours but the middle was still really runny. We stuck what we  had left in the freezer. Today we took it out of the freezer and put it in the refrigerator. And though it did not (hasn’t yet) become runny, it seems the softer it got the faster it is falling apart. We did use Fat-Free cream cheese, jell-o and cool whip. I’m not sure weither that made a difference or not though. Next time I think I’m going to use something other than the fat-free items and see if it makes a difference. I am also going to put the raspberries at the bottom of the pan and pour the filling over the top of them. This pie was really yummy. I’m definitely keeping this recipe and making it again.

This was very sweet - I read the other reviews about it being too lemony, so I replaced the lemon jello w/peach and kept everything else the same. It turned out a light pink. Very pretty, but maybe a tiny bit too sweet. Probably the frozen lemonade needs to be replaced with another kind of juice.

This pie is average.  It does not set well- it is more like pudding and it is too sweet.  Moreover, it does not taste gourmet at all- you can taste that it was made with pre-prepared ingredients.  It is easy to make but I wouldn't make it again.

I followed the directions exactly and the pie turned out runny.  It was also very, very sweet.  I read the directions again to ensure that I had followed them carefully and found that I had.  I'm glad others had more luck with the recipe but I will not keep this one.

My pie did not set like the recipe did.  A little soft but was still good.  I used frozen raspberries and wonder if that made the difference.  My husband and I really enjoyed it.  Makes an interesting summer treat.

This pie was absolutely delicious.  Unfortunately it did not look nearly as pretty as the picture.  I followed the directions to a tee.  Will make it again for the family but not sure I will be serving to anyone else.

Ours DEFINITELY did not turn out right. We followed the recipe exactly and it was VERY VERY tart. Much too lemoney and it did not set right so even after 4 hours it was still fairly liquidy for some reason. I would recommend adding another cool whip to make it set better.

Absolutely amazing! A great light desert for the summer! I changed the recipe slightly by using home made lemonade instead of the frozen concentrate, and I used low fat cream cheese and cool whip light. I also added blueberries into the mix for Memorial Day weekend and it turned out fantastic! :)

I had to alter the recipe a bit because one of my guests is vegetarian and can't eat gelatin.  So, I substituted lemon pudding for the jell-o and froze the pie instead of refigerating it.  I wasn't so sure it would set right without the jell-o.  It was great!  Very refreshing.  I'd like to try it with the jell-o next time and see how different it is.

I made this today, it too a long time to set, when I mixed everything together as the directions say it looked nasty so input it in the blender to get the texture smooth. I agree with earlier comments, it is wayyyy too tart and feels like a punch in the mouth. I will not be making this ever again sorry :((

A great dessert for a hot day when you don't want to bake. I made my own crust and it worked well to make a double graham cracker crust recipe and put it in 2 8 x 8 pans. I'm interested in trying variations--choc cookie crust, other kinds of jello, etc.

Great tasting pie but I had to make it twice.  The first time the filling seemed to sort of separate and was lumpy.  : (  The second time it blended together better.  Very refreshing flavor.  A good summertime pie.

used white grape raspberry concentrate and lemon jello.  the lemon was strong, but very well balanced with the fruit juice.  would have been too much lemon if i used lemonade.

This pie will be a keeper for us.  Light and refreshing for summer cookouts and is a great quick fix dessert to pop in the fridge and serve after dinner.  That said, it will not look like the photo... period.  Both my friend and I have made it multiple times and the gelatin layer separates sinks to the bottom a bit every time, so your pie will be creamier on the top and more gelatin like on the bottom.  The best remedy is to use less lemonade concentrate.  This recipe works every bit as well with strawberries, so don't hesitate to substitute them.

I was really excited to make this, but it ended up not being to my taste.  Both my husband and I didn't really care for it.  I think the lemonade concentrate gave it too much sharpness and acidity, if that makes any sense.

Easy and delicious! I bought one 9oz deep dish graham crust. I found raspberry lemonade concentrate and used that. Big hit with everyone and easy to make! I poured about 2 cups of the mixture into the base and then dotted the fresh raspberries where I wanted them, then put in the fridge for 30 minutes to set a bit. Then poured on the rest of the filling until it was full. I had about 1 cup leftover for a tiny personal pie!

I didn't have lemon gelatin so I used raspberry.  Delicious recipe - I have the second frozen for another time. Will make again.
