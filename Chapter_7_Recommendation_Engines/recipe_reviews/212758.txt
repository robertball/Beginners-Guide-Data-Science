I don't eat scallops, but I wanted to report that my husband who is picky about his seafood and loves scallops, LOVED this! Will be making this many times over, I'm sure!!

Awesome recipe!  I followed as stated but altered only two things, I didn't have lemongrass so I used freshly grated lemon peel, I also used garlic salt on my scallops and in the salsa which I really liked.  I also didn't have safflower oil so I used canola.  My husband loved it!  Thanks!

Ok Seattle Food Geek should be on Top Chef he could give the contestants who "think" they can cook scallops a run for their money.  Excellent recipe and detailed so much so that even I cooked perfect scallops.  Thank you so much.

I have recently been experimenting with seafood recipes for my 19 yr. old pescatarian daughter and she said this was the best by far!!!

This dish is both visually appealing and delicious. I did make a few small changes. In relation to the salsa I replaced the cilantro with half as much dried basil, canned pineapple as opposed to fresh and increased the red pepper flakes (or chili flakes as they're labeled here) to 1/4 teaspoon as we like a little more heat. When the shallots were soft I added all the salsa ingredients to the pan and heated them through, took them off the heat and placed them in a bowl. This helped keep things relatively at the same temperature and did not affect taste. I decided not to buy safflower oil just for this recipe and substituted canola oil. Overall we felt the ginger was a little too much and that the green beans needed more flavour (maybe a dash or so of salt and pepper would've done the trick). I would definitely make this again, especially since it would easily impress guests.

I thought this was really good. The only thing I did different was, I added a little mango to the salsa because I had some and love the flavor and my whole family loved it! It was such a beautiful looking dish as well. Would be great to impress company. It was a very light and healthy recipe and I will be making it again in the future!!

Wonderfully refreshing!  The taste was very full bodied and appealed to every sensory of taste.  This would be a great meal for those who crave  richness of food but desire to feel light and sensible after dinner. The only thing I think i might have changed is that we used frozen french beans  after having steamed them in the steamer...we had fresh \green beans in the fridge and I wish that I had trimmed the ends and sliced them in the french style cut. I could say much more  but I'll summarize by stating that: The flavor, once again, was unforgettable and I recommend everyone try this recepie.

Yum!  I always use bay scallops but, made an exception for this and did buy the sea scallops.  The salsa was wonderful on them!  Don't see a need for the beans though they were good.  Will leave them out next time.  Served with tri color couscous and even my husband loved dinner.  Thanks for a very nice recipe.

The salsa was five stars, but the scallops and the green beans were only three.   I was worried that the salsa would not come together at first, but after 30 minutes in the fridge it was very good. Less oil would have been much better, though, since I think the honey and cider are enough liquid to bring the ingredients together.  I cooked only one scallop by this method, and it came out dark brown which I think was the intention. It also smoked up my whole apartment, so I cooked the remaining scallops over low heat.  The green beans were nothing special, just steamed green beans. I think I will try tossing some garlic in with them on the last saute next time.

Wonderful flavors that meld together for a mouth watering dinner. I would add a little more red pepper flakes.  Otherwise, this is a keeper!

OMG!  SOOO Good.  Eveything about this recipe is deliciousl  Tried not to alter but had to use what was on hand.  Asparagus instead of beans, Canned crushed pineapple (still really good).  No lemongrass or vinegar, so we used cooking sherry and lemon juice.  And I skipped the oil all together for health reasons.  Used PAM high heat grilling spray on the frying pan and still got a nice sear.  Added a little extra heat and it was wonderful!!  Will definitely make again!

I cut the olive oil in half and added cajun seasoning to the scallops. The salsa was great but next time I'll do waaaaay more of it and use lemon juice/zest instead of lemon grass. Lemon grass just isn't meant to be eaten, there were little strands of it that weren't so appealing. Great recipe overall, will definately make again. Thanks!

I don't eat seafood, I am however learning how to cook it for my husband. Thanks to the clear and well written recipe I served a dish to my husband that looked and tasted like a professional chef had made it.I had fresh snow peas so I used them instead of beans that is the only change I made. My husband said my scallops were perfectly  cooked and the pineapple salsa was a perfect match. He was completely satisfied. I liked the salsa very much as well it lent it self well to my chicken. Thank you so much for helping learn how to cook seafood.
