So much pressure being one of the first to review a recipe. If you are looking for a treat that has a resemblance to the candy bar, then keep looking. This is an homage to the nut - the joy of an almond. Here is what I like about this recipe. It is simplicity at the base - easy ingredients, easy process, quick results with a yummy end product. I will be making these for a long time to come.
