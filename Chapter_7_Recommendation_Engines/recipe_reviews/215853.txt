This is a great way to make cubed steak. My kids LOVE angel hair pasta so I figured it would easily be a hit. I made no changes to the recipe. It was easy to make and tasty. Prep time is right on. I dumped ingredients in the breadmaker right after I got this prepared and in the fridge. I put the pasta on a large plate then placed the steak on top spooning the remaining sauce over the exposed pasta. It looked beautiful with so little effort! This makes more than four servings but leftovers are a cheap lunch for me. I'll definitely make this again!

Used a generic giant eagle tomato/basil sauce half and onion and half a pepper and only a cup of the bread crumbs (no need to waste) and it all came out perfectly! Marinate the steaks overnight in the sauce though to make them more tender!

I used pork cubed steaks! Came out great! I also used a generic sauce eliminated the green pepper because I had none and used frozen cut up onions. I forgot the cheese and used less bread crumbs...just enough to coat. I mixed this recipe up a bunch and I still loved it.
