I was looking for a crock pot recipe and stumbled across this one.  EXCELLENT in the crock pot with the following modifications.  I used one pound of pasta.  Only cook pasta 1/2 the recommended cooking time on package.  It will not be done yet, but will finish softening up in crock pot.  Totally omitted butter.  Added 2 cans of chicken broth and 1 can of cream of chicken soup to crock pot along with other ingredients.  Cooked on low for 6 hours....DELICIOUS.  I also used a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store unstead of boiling one.  Thanks for sharing this one...not your normal chicken spaghetti...has a great spicy kick and very colorful for a pot luck dinner.

My three boys and husband all loved this recipe.  I did make a few changes though.  They don't like celery or green pepper so I left out the celery and I used red bell pepper instead of green.  I didn't use any butter and used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I also used grated cheese instead of cubed processed cheese.  With these changes everyone had thirds, and if I can get ALL my boys to agree on something you know it is a winner!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe and it was a nice change of pace.  I used fresh mushroom and added red pepper flakes when I was sauteeing the vegtables for a little extra kick. I also subsituted mozzarella cheese for the processed cheese and the result was less creamy than I think it was intended to be. If you decide to do this, I would reduce the amount of pasta by 1/3. This was a great recipe that we will definately make again!

It would have been surprising had this recipe NOT tasted good.... it only has A POUND of Velveeta in it!  lol!      This was a really good recipe...here are my slight changes (cheats):  Used a rotisserie chicken.  Used canned broth.  I followed others' suggestions and was sure to use ONLY 12 oz pasta, which was just right (whole box of 16oz would have been too much).  I also added additional chicken broth which kept this dish oh-so-gooey and moist.   How much extra chicken broth?  Just enough to make the mixture the consistency of pancake batter.   Oh and we like spicy, so I used the MEXICAN velveeta instead of the regular.  Delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe Stephanie!

This is ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! I made this last night and my boyfriend and I loved it! I ate 2 plates and I've only had 2 plates in one sitting one other time in the past 6 months of new recipes. The only thing I changed was I boiled 2 bone-in chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken (it was on sale so it was the cheapest way to go). 2 things, next time I'm inviting ppl over b/c it makes a ton! Also, if you have small children you may want to use regular diced tomatoes instead of Rotel. My b/f and I love hot stuff so we enjoyed it, but little kids may find it a little too hot. Thanks for the awesome recipe :)

Pretty good recipe.  The name is a little misleading, It is more of a chicken chili mac and cheese.  I added black olives just because my family loves them so much, used fresh mushrooms and added a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of fiesty nacho cheese soup since I was using my home canned tomatoes that didn't have the peppers in them.  I also added more garlic, onion, Chili powder, and salt & Pepper.  But I'm sure this recipe stands just fine on its own.  I did find the nacho cheese soup a great addition to this so I would highly recommend adding it again even if using the right tomatoes.

This was great.  I added 1 cup white wine and 1 can chicken broth, and used a rotisserie chicken to save time.  I used red pepper instead of green and reduced fat Velveeta.  Vermacelli dries out easily, but is easily fixed by adding broth.  When microwaving the next day, just add a little milk, and it won't be dry at all.

Prep time was a lot more than 15 minutes.  That would have gotten it four stars, but it was soooooo good.  Made exactly by the recipe.  Even topped with shredded cheese.  I will definitely use this recipe again, only next time I'll buy the already chopped veggies, and will probably use less cheese.

Delish!!!  A nice change of spaghetti. Used cheddar, not velveeta - which makes it less creamy, but more healthy.  Added zucchini.  Used chicken tenders and fresh mushrooms.

Great recipe. makes a ton of food. (It says to reserve chick. broth, but since I baked my chicken I just used a can of chick. broth.)  I used 4 seasoned chicken breast. I baked the chicken breast then pulled apart. Used fresh mushroom instead of canned. It tastes good with or without... but I decided to add a can of cream of mushroom soup.

Good flavor! I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken.  I also put a few more veggies in and a small can of pimentos.  Next time, I think I'll leave one can of the Rotel out and substitute a can of regular diced tomatoes.  The two cans of rotel were a little spicey for my taste.  Hubby liked it too!

I've made this recipes in a slow cooker as well as on the stove/in the oven and it turns out really good.  Very cheesy with a little spice.  Not a big hit with my husband who isn't much of a cheese fan or my daughter who doesn't like much spice but it tasted great to me.

This is an awesome recipe. Made it exactly as written. I was a little hesitant to make it because I'm not a big velveeta fan. However, I took a chance because of all the great reviews. I'm glad I did and will definitely make it again.

My husband is still eating as I write this...his 3rd or maybe 4th helping (I lost track!). It was awesome!  The only change I made was that I boiled 4 boneless chicken breast (still frozen) till they were cooked through and used the broth from that plus a little extra to boil the pasta.  I also used the Rotel "hot" version of the chopped tomatoes.  Next time I am going to try Velveeta light so I can consume more with out worry about the calories so much!  I will also use a little less pasta.

This was a good alternative to a typical casserole.  I used fresh mushrooms and omitted the pepper due to taste.  I also used cooked chicken breast instead of a whole chicken. Hubby requested this dish again a few weeks later.  Note: Do not use the tomatoes with green chilis b/c too spicy for the kids.  Use plain tomatoes and then add diced green chilis can b/c they are milder.  6/2017 neither of the kids (10,12) would eat this.  They didn't like it at all.  I used 1 can tomatoes w/ green chilis and one can plain tomatoes and that worked well spice wise.

Excellent Recipe!  The whole family loved it.  I added 8 ounces of sliced mushrooms and omitted the green peppers.  Sliced zucchini works in this recipe as well.  You might want to use two pans when baking it.  I used a 9 x 13 and an 8 x 8.  There was enough left over for another meal even with five of us.  Some reviewers thought that it was too spicy, but we thought that it was perfect.  If you want to cool it down, replace one of the cans of tomatoes with chilies with plain diced tomatoes.  Will definetly make this one again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very Yummy. I used shredded cheddar cheese to replace the Velveeta (not a fan) ... was cheesy and not runny at all.

Used 16 oz of vermicelli pasta, used 2 lbs of velveeta, and used fresh mushrooms.  After I softened the veggies, put all in crock pot on low except pasta.  Boiled pasta and added to crock pot and served.  YUM!!!  I topped with a bit of shredded cheese as I served.  Boiled boneless skinless chicken thighs in water, and added crushed red pepper, tony's, black pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder to water.

Love this recipe!!!  Seconds were a must.  Two small notes.....you only need 1/2 pound of pasta and I used pepper jack Velveeta for a little extra kick!

I thought this was pretty good. I was hustling around my kitchen and forgot the garlic. I normally love garlic, but I would say that you should save yourself from washing your mincer and leave it out. I also left out the mushrooms. I used a 10 oz. bag of coiled vermicelli and I thought that was perfect. I used about 1/2-2/3 cup of the reserved chicken broth to poor over my pan before putting in the oven. I do have to say that this recipe did seem like a huge mess and a lot of trouble for "spaghetti", but I think it would have been easier had I followed the advice of others and bought a rotisserie chicken, or boiled chicken breasts. It was quite a nice change from normal spaghetti for my husband and I. However, even with the mild tomatoes and green chilies, it was too spicy for my 2 1/2 year old.

I made this as a Birthday dinner for a member of my family and was VERY weary about the way it looked before I baked it but after it cooked and I mixed it all around a final time it looked and tasted DELICIOUS! This is a keeper for sure!

I used the crock pot for this recipe, using the suggestions that others have made. I omitted the butter, added one cup of chicken broth and one can of cream of mushroom soup. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into bite sized piece and threw all but the pasta into the crock pot raw. I boiled the pasta for half the time recommended on the box and added it to the crock pot half way through my cooking time of 3 hours on high. Yummy and perfect!

I used to make a similar Chicken spaghetti recipe that didn't have chili's, tomato sauce, or mushrooms but you put cream of chicken in it.  My husband liked this new way even better.

Wow - I wasn't sure what to expect but we all REALLY enjoyed this!  Very minor changes were made: green onion instead of regular, skipped the bell pepper because I forgot and no mushrooms cuz I don't like them.  I didn't sautee the veggies first which kept them nice and crunchy, great texture.  I also used nearly the full lb of pasta so I dumped in an extra can of diced tomatoes.  Holy cow!  Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!  Next time I will cheat tho and use a rotisserie chicken, cuz that was a little too much work...lol.  :-)

I believe in the future , I will substitute a can of chopped green chiles for one of the mushrooms and use regular spaghetti instead of the vermicelli.

Instead of putting 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, I put one can of the tomatoes with peppers and then another can of plain diced tomatoes.  The recipe was still plenty spicy, but not too hot for me.  This will be a recipe that I use on a regular basis.

Loved this recipe!!!  I was a little hesitant, but is was fabulous!  I did only do 1/2 cup of butter to cut back on the fat.  I just used chicken breast and put them in the crock pot for a couple of hours and then shredded it.  We also thought you could totally do this vegetarian or do shrimp instead of chicken.  But the chicken was great in it!

I would make this recipe again, but with some changes. In my opinion, the "cheese" overwhelmed almost all the tasty aspects of this recipe. Next time I'm going to try using a cheddar cheese sauce and see how it goes.

Made exactly as the recipe states and turned out delicious! My family gobbled it up.  Next time I think I'll leave out the green pepper (not a big fan), use fresh sauteed mushrooms and add more garlic.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great different way to have spaghetti.  I did make a few changes based on what other reviewers said and to suit our tastes.  I used rotisserie chicken, about half a chicken. I cut the butter back to 1/2 cup and will probably cut back to 1/4 next time.  Used 2 celery stalks and added an extra garlic clove.  Omitted the bell pepper but will try with a red pepper next time.  Added 3/4 teaspoon mexican oregano and a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of the canned mushrooms.  Also uppped the pasta to one pound.  Turned out wonderful.  Will definately make again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this the first time following the recipe except I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  It was good, very rich, but that's  what kept me from eating a whole bunch of it.  The second time I made it I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, a little less cheese, and spicier tomatoes.  YUMMY!  I will make this a third time when I need a treat!

This is very good, slightly spicy because of the green chilis.  I did not use all that processed cheese cuz I didnt have it.  Just about a cup of real shredded.  I imagine it is just as tasty.

The pound of Velveeta part is very important. I had 1/4 pound of mozzarella handy so I used that. The final product lacked salt and was a little too dry. Both of these problems would have been solved by using the cheese called for. Otherwise the dish tasted good.

I used fresh mushrooms and grated cheese instead of processed.  My family said it was good, but I didnt need to make it again.  I give all our leftovers to my uncle twice a week and he loved it.  He called me to make sure I didn't forget to bring the recipe.

Always looking for a crock pot recipe, this one sounded good. I assembled all the ingredients before I left for work this morning.  It smelled so good when I came home this afternoon, but after we tasted it, I threw it away and we ordered Chinese.  The problem was that the spaghetti noodles became way too mushy and there was just no going around them.  Maybe it would have been better if I'd not made it the original way, but the poster did say it was good for a crock pot.  I will not make this again, sorry.

This is an interesting recipe.  Very different with the pasta.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of the canned.  I think I may try using torn corn tortillas instead of the pasta in it next time to see if we like it better.  All in all the flavor was pretty good but it just seemed strange with the pasta.  Husband had two servings though so you know he didn't dislike it.

So good!  Left out the celery because I don't care for it.  And just used regular chicken breasts instead of whole chicken.  It was so good that I couldn't stop eating it.  And it makes more than enough to freeze for later.

This stuff is GREAT for a cold winter day!
My husband ate 2 helpings & complimented me.
He is 100% ItalianAmerican and difficult to please on pasta dishes.

I left out the celery AND the canned soup.  Instead, I sautéed some garlic, fresh red bell pepper & fresh brown sliced mushrooms.  Added a whole pound of grated cheddar cheese.

this was actually a pretty low cost meal to put together and gave us so much left overs :) not kidding, it was so much food, i could not even mix it in my largest mixing bowl, i had to use a big pot to stir all the ingredients together. used boneless chicken breasts, and went along with other reviews and used one can of diced tomatoes with green chile peppers and used one regular can of diced tomatoes. my husband and i thought it turned out very mild this way, and maybe next time i will go for the 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chile peppers to give it some more spice. i used the oven cooking method and it turned out very moist. i did follow another reviewers advice and did not drain the tomatoes! will definitely make this again, thank you!

Absolutely fabulous, although I did saute the veggies in olive oil instead of butter. I also used whole wheat noodles because I took it to a company pot luck & have some diabetics in the group. Got many compliments on the dish. Thanks for sharing!

The first time I made this, I put it in the crockpot. That time I only gave it 4 stars, but I'm changing my rating. I made it in the oven for my family and it was much better. Also, I was careful not to shred up the chicken too much and kept the pieces in bigger 1 inch chunks. It was great! Even my 2 year old daughter liked this.

Would've given this dish 5 stars, but prepared by the recipe was uncomfortably spicy for our tastes.  Will substitute a can of Rotel for a can of diced tomatoes to decrease a bit of the kick!

SO GOOD! Other than leaving out the mushrooms (yucky things) and halving the amount of butter (3/4 of a cup is just not necessary) I didn't make any changes. Some ppl mentioned it being dry, but I thought it was perfectly creamy; I didn't need to add any of the broth. Maybe it is because I didn't drain the tomatoes. Also, some reviewers added additional spices. I thought the flavor was perfect, any more spicy and it would have been inedible to me (but not to my husband who loves spicy food). Again, soooo good! Gotta go, I'm getting seconds! p.s. I also doubled the amount of garlic, can never have too much garlic! ;-)

Excellent!  My teenagers weren't excited about eating it because it didn't look very appealing, but they loved it! I pretty much followed the recipe as stated with one change.  It seemed like it would need more seasoning so for extra flavor and to make it easier, I used 2 boxes of Rice A Roni chicken flavor instead of the vermicelli pasta.  The Rice A Roni has the pasta and rice and the added flavor made this meal delicious.

I have to put a 5 star review on anything every member of my household really likes.  My husband, 11 yr. old boy, 10 year old girl, and 3 yr. old girl all loved this recipe.  I used romano cheese, and added half a can of cream of chicken soup and some chicken broth when mixing it all together.  It was creamy and they clamored for "more"!

In the south, this is called Chicken Rotel. This freezes well, so I often divide it into two smaller casserole dishes and give one to a friend or neighbor in need of some home cooking. I sub peas for the pepper.

Taste-wise, I loved this!  I used a 16-oz package of angelhair pasta, though, and it was a little dry; I accept full responsibility for this deviation!  Next time if I stick with the 16-oz pkg. of pasta, I will add an extra can of plain diced tomatoes and more garlic.   This dish was colorful and delicious and I can't wait to take it to a church potluck dinner.

We all thought this was good, not great.  I won't be making it again.  It's an interesting variation on spaghetti...or maybe a chicken casserole?  It just wasn't our cup o' tea.

This was so delicious! I got two rotisserie chickens and pulled the meat from them. I sautéed the onion, bell pepper, and celery with about 4 tbsp of butter and then added it to the rest in my crock pot. I cooked it on low for two hours. I then cooked the pasta, al dente, and added it in for the last hour. The flavor in this dish is amazing. I topped it with mozzarella cheese. This stuff is pure comfort food!

This recipe is great! I will make this again. I did as another review suggested and used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store. I also used flavored Mexican style Velveeta cheese that gave an added kick. I left out the mushrooms and celery because my fiance won't eat those items. But the overall taste was amazing. You really don't have to add any seasoning. I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

Pretty good! I liked this, but my fiance didn't at all. I pretty much followed Steph's directions to the letter, except for making a few changes of my own. For one, I 1/2'd the recipe (expecting leftovers). I STILL had TRIPLE the amt. of food I thought I'd have - which is too bad since my fiance won't eat the leftovers.... My only other changes were omitting the mushrooms (we don't like them), subbing a pre-purchased rotisserie chicken & adding a can of cream of chichen soup (didn't seem creamy enough w/o it). I also boiled my spaghetti in chicken broth (i.e. what I had left in my fridge + 2 (14.5 oz.) cans + enough H2O to fill my lg. pot - ~ 2 fulls cans worth) to compensate for not making my own as directed. I used the leftover broth to moisten everything, but didn't need much of it. While I liked this, I wouldn't make it a "regular" on my menu rotation. If I were making this for myself again, I think I'd use cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. I'd also use the sc method PODGER1 suggested. Served w/ biscuits, this was a filling meal. Thx. for sharing, Stephanie :)

Absolutely loved this recipe!  I made a few alterations.  I use a Rotisserie Chicken from my local Grocery Deli. I did use chicken broth to boil up my noodles I omitted the celery and most all of the butter and used a red pepper instead of green. Other than that this is most definitely a comfort food to die for and will be going in the personal favorites cookbook!

To save time,I used 3 boneless, skinless breasts, cooked and cubed.I put the cheese and rotel into my crockpot along with 1 can of cream of chicken soup and heated till the cheese was melted and soup blended. To that I added the chicken, sauteed veggies and the al dente pasta. Cooked on low for aprox 40 minutes.This was good, but a bit sticky. I think next time I will use more soup and less velveeta.

I loved this recipe. At first it was time consuming considering all the prep work with cooking the chicken and cutting all the vegetables. But once past that, it assembled quickly and required a short baking time. My fiance enjoyed it very much. He is a big eater and it satisfied him. And we definitely have enough for 2 more nights. I did not find it dry at all.And didn't need any chicken broth added. I didn't drain the diced tomatoes so maybe that helped and I did cover with foil for the baking time. I found it very moist and an excellent flavor. Well done.

I made this last night and it was really good. I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken and left out the celery.  My husband and I liked it but it's something you can't eat all that often due to the fat content.

This was awesome!!! Everyone enjoyed it and went back for seconds. As another reviewer stated, I had enough for 5 adults and a toddler, and left overs for all of us to eat again. It is a little time consuming, but well worth the effort. I followed the recipe exactly, and found that if you periodically add chicken broth while it's cooking it prevents dryness. I also needed a cook time of about 40 minutes.

I thought it was a delightful change from the usual blah chicken casseroles I've eaten.  My hubby & I enjoyed it thoroughly.

I followed the recipe and it turned out okay. A lot of work though. I should have just grilled a couple of chicken breasts instead of boiling a whole 3lb chicken. I probably won't make this again.

Great dish. It does need more flavor for my tastebuds though. So I’ve added southwest tortilla strips , fresh cilantro and jalapeño for a kick.

This was absolutely delicious!! It will be my new go to for this recipe. Thanks for sharing. The only modifications we made were that we used 2cans of hot title. It added so much flavor! We like spicy.

Made this and LOVED IT! Did make a few subs. I needed to cut some time in half, so I bought an original rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and deboned it. I used a can of chicken broth for the noodles. I added salt/pepper to the sautéed vegetables. Added a tad bit more garlic. I also did half processed cheese and half shredded cheddar. It was fantastic. My husband can’t get enough of it!!!

I used a cajan rubbed rotisserie chicken, deboned. I boiled the noodles in water with 3 chicken boulin cubes. I also omitted the butter and used two cans of broth, and two cans of cream of chicken soup. Rest of recipe I followed as called for except i used my pressure cooker and used the slow cooker setting. It was hot and done when we got home from church.

I have made this in the oven and in the crock pot. I prefer the crock pot method but in the oven works great as well. I was short on time so I just boiled chicken breast and used canned broth tonight. I also add zucchini and take out the celery. My family loves it.

This is very good.  I made it with fresh mushrooms instead of canned, chicken tenders, and a soft jarred soup base.  I didn't have tomatoes that had green chilies so I added several cans of green chilies with 2 (14 oz.) cans diced tomatoes.   It took awhile to prepare but is, again, very good.

When my 6 year old asks for second and thirds, I know its a hit!  This will be a keeper!  

I cooked the pasta in chicken broth and this really pulled out the flavors!

We loved this recipe. It had the right amount of kick to it and cooking it in the slow cooker made it so easy. I will definitely put this on my 'keeper list' . Thanks for a great recipe. I also cooked the spaghetti half way then added it to the slow cooker. It came out perfect

My husband and kids love this dish, it's one of the "house specialties" around here?? only changes I made were using about a tbs of natures seasoning while sautéing and cooking the chicken breast down I also substituted the mushrooms for some nice baby spinach about 2 1/2 cups of it. It really gives it an extra something special and a nice pop of color. I add the spinach right on top of the finished pasta, sprinkle some shredded jack cheese on top of that then bake it covered for about 20 to 30 mins & enjoy??????
