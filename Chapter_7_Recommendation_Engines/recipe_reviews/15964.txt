We loved this, but I did modify it just a little. I only had 8 oz cream cheese, so I folded about a cup of Cool Whip into the mix. I also used the juice of 1 lemon and 1 lime. Added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon orange extract. The recipe I normally use for lemon icebox pie only calls for condensed milk and lemon juice, but I like this recipe better, because I believe the cream cheese tones down the flavor of the condensed milk. We really enjoyed the creaminess and light lemon taste.

This recipe is fabulous! The pie comes out beautiful and so tasty. I used the zest and juice of 3 lemons and it turned out great. Just enough tartness to offset the sweetness of the cream cheese and condensed milk. A hint? Keep it in the freezer for a while before you eat it, makes it even more refreshing!

I made this pie tonight for a dinner party and everybody loved it.  I did however, use the zest of 4 lemons!  I also used a regular crust intstead of the graham.  I really whipped the heck out of it to make it thick and creamy.  UPDATE: USE THE ZEST OF 4 LEMONS, NOT THE JUICE OF 4 LEMONS!!!!

This is actually one of my favorite summertime recipes for it's light refreshing flavor, the fact that it's an easy no bake recipe, and doesn't call for cool whip or jello. I've made it often and it's one of my most popular desserts. Seeing that it has some very mixed reviews, mostly addressing consistency and flavor, I will offer this...cans of sweetened condensed milk only come in 300 ml (10 oz) sizes around here so that's the amount I use, and it sets up quite well for me, so I would recommend using that amount only. Because the size of a lemon can vary and the recipe doesn't give a specific amount of juice, I would suggest adding the juice to taste so it doesn't get too tart. If more lemon flavor is desired, but it's tart enough, up the amount of lemon zest instead of adding more juice. To ensure a smooth filling, be sure to scrape down the bowl after beating the cream cheese, and add the milk and lemon slowly, again scraping the bowl occasionally until all is well incorporated. Finally, I have found that beating the mixture for a good five minutes after it's smooth yields a very light textured, mousse like result. Be sure to also use a 'tnt' crust if going the store bought route or it may detract from the overall flavor of the finished pie. I prefer to just mix up some graham crumbs, butter, and sugar if needed, and press into the pie plate. It isn't always necessary to bake a crumb crust.

Disappointing.  I thought two packages of cream cheese would be too much and I should have followed my instincts instead of the reviews (and made the other Lemon Icebox Pie recipe on this site that calls for only ONE package of cream cheese, darn it)  Too cream cheesey tangy, not sweet enough because of it (I'm sure the sweetness level would be fine if only one package of cream cheese was used) and not lemony enough, even tho' I nearly doubled the amount of zest called for.  I also made my own crust, using "Graham Cracker Crust," also from this site.  It's a pretty pie, but it's not as mouthwatering good as it looks.

This was extremely easy to make and pleased my dinner guests.  I recommend adding the cool-whip topping...it made the dessert much better.  I also made my lower in fat by using lite cool-whip and fat free cream cheese!  Every little bit helps!

Be sure to blend the cream sheese well before adding lemon juice or it will curdle and taste terrible!

This was EXCELLENT.  I made it twice in one week.  I used a shortbread ready-made pie crust from the store and fat-free cream cheese.  I used real lemons one day and the next time I used a 1/2 cup of lemon juice from consentrate.  Both worked out well.  We kept it in the freezer until ready to serve.  Thanks for a quick and perfect summer pie.

This is great recipe, especially for the hot summer months when you don't want to turn on your oven.  The second time I made this pie I used fat free condensed milk, 1/3 less fat cream cheese and fat free cool whip to cut fat down to 10g.  Do not use low fat condensed milk, from my past experience it does not thicken as well as the fat free or regular when citrus is added.  Have not tried the fat free cream cheese yet.

Thank you for the great recipe! This was really easy to make, it took me barely 15 mins and it s an impressive dessert, esp if u have guests and u re rushed for time - just make ahead of time and refrigerate. I made some modifications, however , after reading some of the reviews. I used only 1 stick of the cream cheese (8 oz Philadelphia) and substituted the other for ready to use whipped cream ( about 300ml). The rest was the same, 1 can of milkmaid (sweetened condensed milk) and the juice and zest of 2 large 
lemons.  Used premade graham pie crust as suggested. Used a electric beater to beat it all together smoothly. Came out beautiful! not to sweet and the lemon flavour was just nice. Agree that if I had used 2 sticks of cream cheese, it might have been too cream cheesy...
Everyone at home loved it and will definitely be making it again- thanks again for the wonderful recipe and all the reviewers for their suggestions!

Whew! This one has been a big hit. Even my 5 year old likes it, she's not much of a sweet eater. I don't know how that happened. I did increase it to the juice of 3 lemons for our tastes. This one will be on the menu alot!

This recipe is quick ,easy and good. I used the juice and zest of three lemons and felt like it still tasted a little too much like cream cheese. This recipe is not sweet so if you don't like sweet this is for you. i'm sure you could use either lemons or limes as this is similar to key lime pie VII which uses more sweetened condensed milk. I recomend the key lime pie VII if you like your pie a little sweeter and again, i'm sure you could use either lemons or limes.

Love this dessert!  It's so simple and so yummy!  I have brought it to a couple bbq parties and everyone loves it and wants the recipe.  It's very refreshing!  The only thing I did differently...and it's because we really wanted it to be more tart and lemony...is I added an extra 1/2 of a lemon and only used about 12 oz. of the sweetened condensed milk.  It was perfectly mouthwatering!  Thanks for a wonderful dessert Heather!!  YUMMY!

I love this pie and the recipe works although I think an exact measure of the lemon juice would help. There are too many various sizes of lemons.  I have made this three times within the year and learned a couple of things.  If you want a fluffy pie, beat it on high for about 2 minutes and the pie will be lighter and fluffier.  Second, make sure you don't add the lemon juice to just the cream cheese.  On my first pie, I failed to beat in the condensed milk first so it was horribly lumpy and I had to beat it about 5 minutes to smooth the lumps.  Awesome pie and now my sister and niece serve it to their families for dessert as well.

I have been making a pie similar to this for over 30 years. I only use one 8 oz. pkg. cream cheese and 1/3 cup lemon juice along with the sweetened condensed milk. My family loves it!

Super yummy! To cut the crazy amounts of fat, we used neufchatel and nonfat sweetened condensed milk (and will use reduced fat graham crust next time), and I don't think it affected the flavor at all. However, just know that the fat is what makes it set up so beautifully as it cools, so chilling in the freezer is your best bet if you do the same.  It's a very very pale yellow, so we used this for our Fourth of July red-white-and-blue dessert with strawberries & blueberries. It was great! Quick heads-up for lemon lovers like me - this is a creamy, soft lemon flavor, not tart like a lemon meringue pie; think lemon yogurt. Definitely have an extra lemon or two on hand for juice (and especially zest) and taste your filling before you pour; I used a microplane so I definitely got every last bit of zest off my lemons, and I would've been bummed if it had been any less lemony than it was. It was great, though - a creamy, cool, refreshing plate o'lemony goodness!

SOOO good! I did add more zest (3 lemons) and a little more lemon juice due to other reviews of not being "lemony" enough. Turned out great!!

I only used one 8oz package of cream cheese and used 1/4 cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice (4 lemons ish). To make sure things set up well (and quickly) I dissolved 1/2tsp of unflavored gelatin in 1tbsp boiling water. then added that right at the end before pouring into the pie shell. Set over night and has such a great lemony flavor!

Have made this twice. Followed directions exactly, one time using lemons and one time using limes. Easy to lighten up using low fat cream cheese and fat free sweetened condensed milk. Super easy, convenient ingredients and fabulous taste. Great low investment, high return dessert--my favorite kind. Rave reviews from all.

I loved this pie!  I'm giving a 4 instead of 5 because I did deviate from the original recipe. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and only used one 8oz package of cream cheese.  Instead of folding in cool whip, I beat a 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream (with 1/4 tsp vanilla extract, 1/4 tsp of lemon extract and 1 tbs of confectioners sugar) and folded that in.  I put the pie in the freezer an hour before I served it and topped with whipped cream.  I saw a lot of people had different opinions on the strength of the lemon flavor in the pie.  I used the zest and juice of two large lemons and it was perfect for my family.

This was really, really good! I bought 2 small lemons and used the zest and juice of both. I tasted the filling before pouring it into the crust to make sure it was lemony enough, and two lemons was perfect. I made it on a Friday afternoon and served it the next evening. It set up perfectly. My family and friends all loved it. I will be making this one again and again. It's the perfect easy dessert when you are craving lemon!

This was so yummy, and so easy!  I made it several times this summer.  Even my brother-in-law, who doesn't like lemon, loved this one.  I couldn't believe it!  I agree with others to add the zest and juice of an extra lemon, otherwise there just isn't enough lemon flavor.  I also whipped in some whipped cream to fluff it up, otherwise it's very dense and heavy.  I gave this 4 stars because of the changes I made, but with the changes, it's a 5 star pie for sure!

Delicious. I served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it. The only changes I made were to use the juice and zest of three lemons, and add a teaspoon of vanilla. I used light cream cheese and it turned out perfectly. I served it with lightly sweetened whipped cream.

This is a delicious pie for summer BBQ's with some small changes that made it over the top!  I use 8oz. whipped cream cheese instead of 2 blocks.  I also add one package of lemon pie filling mix.  The kind you use to make lemon meringue pie.  I'm sure it's just sugar and granulated lemon but it makes this pie absolutely delicious.  Not the sour twang of too much creamed cheese.  I also top mine with strawberries and blueberries and it's a hit every time!  Try it and I'm sure you'll make 2 next time.

This pie has become a weekly treat in our house.  Very easy to make and absolutely delicious!  I've tried with both the regular cream cheese and low fat cream cheese and couldn't tell the difference.  I spread some Cool Whip on top and then sprinkle a little extra lemon zest on top to make it pretty.

I never thought I'd say this, but it was just a tad too cream cheesey for me, but overall still a good taste.  Will maybe add some cool whip for added fluffiness next time.  Would make again...just with a few tweaks.

I used this as a filling for a fruit tart on the 4th of July. I made my own shortbread crust, let it cool, added the filling and topped it with berries and a sprinkle of powdered sugar. Everyone loved it.

I gave this 4 stars because I changed the recipe slightly by adding whipped topping to the final stir. It turned out wonderful! My guests loved this.

I wanted something with a distinct lemon flavor - this just tastes like cream cheese in a pie crust.

Been making this for more than 60 years......my mother found it on the other side of label on can of Eagle Brand Condensed Milk!!!!  So whoever posted this recipe should not be taking credit for old recipe that's been around since late'50's!!LOL 
Note to those of you that wondered about amount of cream cheese......good instincts!!!.....recipe has always called for ONE 8 oz package of Cream cheese!!  And I have never seen  14 ounce cans of condensed milk...... here in Canada 1 can of condensed milk is 300 ml or  10 fluid ounces.  Have always made it like that and it's  always great.  Have never had to put in in freezer to set. ....it does take about 2-3 hours to set but I  don't thinkifreezing would contribute much to creamy consistency!!   Have never tried topping pie with whipped cream....that sounds like a lot of milk product !!!
Blueberry pie filling (or your own berry topping) is lovely...

I have been using this recipe for years and always get rave reviews. it is rich and delicious and more then satisfy my cheesecake cravings, but is much easier and surprisingly lighter(maybe not calories but taste) then most cheesecakes. BTW, I have always known this recipes as cheesecake pie, not as icebox pie. can see why some people were confused...but look at the ingredients...it's going to taste like cheesecake...lol

I've been looking for a recipe like this one. I did modiy just a little. I used 3 lemons and 1 lime, I also added 1/2 container of cool whip. I took this to a potluck dinner and it was the 1st dessert to disappear. Sweet but with the sour bite. GREAT!!!!!!!

After reviewing the reviews I used only one package of low-fat cream cheese, one cup of 50% less sugar condensed milk, added one cup of nonfat Cool Whip, 1 tsp vanilla, and the zest and juice of 3 lemons.  After adding each ingredient slowly, beat on high with the mixer about 5 minutes until fluffy.  AWESOME!  So light and lemony.  Hubby loooved this, he is a big lemon fan and this is our new fave.  Instead of using a store-bought pie crust I  made my own graham cracker crust and pressed it into cupcakes in a silicone pan.  Put them in the freezer for a few hours for 12 ready-to-serve individual mini-pies.  It is easy to pop these mini-pies out of the silicone pan and they soften in about a half hour.  Topped each with a dab of Cool Whip.  Keeping uneaten portions frozen prevents us from eating a whole pie in one or two days!! :)

I wish I could give this 5 stars, because it tasted so good that four of us killed the whole pie in one sitting! Unfortunately, we had to eat it with spoons because it never did set up.  Still, the filling was so delicious, we thought next time just make the filling, forget the crust, and serve it in bowls!  I do wish someone could suggest a way to get it to set up.

Really good flavor. Thought the freshly squeezed lemon juice gave the pie a real zing! I didn't get the right texture with mine though so make sure you use an electric mixer (I don't own one) or it comes out lumpy. Mine was tasty just not as pretty to look at.

A keeper, delicious and quick and easy to prepare. I followed a suggestion and used the juice and zest from three lemons. My family and I like it a little tarter so may try four lemons next time. Thank you for sharing, Heather.

While this pie is super-simple to assemble, it doesn't produce a super-foolproof result.  My pie never really set-up properly so it was like eating a custard filling instead of a pie.  Perhaps I added too much lemon juice?  It may be better to list the number of tablespoons of lemon juice to be added rather than 2 lemons, juiced.

I do like the fresh taste of a lemon pie, so, perhaps next time I'll nix 1 package of cream cheese in favor of about a 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of sour cream.  Then, I'll bake the pie for about 10-15 minutes before putting it in the fridge to cool.

The reason I gave this recipe only two stars is because it's more of a tasty lemon cheesecake than an actual lemon icebox pie. I had to use more lemons as well (3 lemons for juice AND zest) and actually felt like I should have used at least one more and it just turned out to be a nice, creamy lemon cheesecake. :/ Kinda dissapointed because I wasted time and ingredients...but mainly because I've had a strong craving for lemon icebox pie here lately...and this recipe is not it. :(

I am only giving this 3 stars because as is, it does not have enough lemon.  You definitely need to follow the recommendations and add the zest of 4 lemons instead of just a teaspoon.

Excellant! Made it with 1 brick of low fat cr. cheese and used 1 cup of cool whip folded in. A home made graham crust is the best too! Very easy. Oh and used more lemon zest.

My only problem with this pie was that it didn't have a strong enough lemon taste.  Maybe my lemons were too small to get the right amount of juice?  I'd love to try making this pie again if I had a liquid measurement for how much juice there should be.

I've made this recipe for the past 6 years and since then realized that it's foolproof.  I never really measure the lemon juice and I use the zest of 2-4 lemons.  But for best results, WAIT 1 DAY BEFORE EATING!  It lasts for 10 days in the fridge, so let it really mellow.

Made this as a quick dessert for a summer BBQ. I am a terrible baker, so I love any dessert that uses store bought crust and has a no fail filling. I made this the night before and it held up really well.

I made this today and it turned out great even though I had substitutions.  My substitions were, 5 tablespoons of lemon juice instead of juice from 2 lemons.  Also 1 teaspoon of orange rind/zest from spice jar instead of lemon zest.  Used subs because that's what I had on hand and it turned out great!  Juice from 1 lemon is approximately 3 tablespoons at most, so I used 5 tablespoons for the 2 lemons.  Will be making this again.

I used 4 lemons that yielded ¾ cup of lemon juice. I also added the zest from those lemons. Some thought the lemon flavor was right, another thought is was a bit tart. So depending on your love of lemons, I would recommend using ½ to ¾ cup of lemon juice. Although I did not measure the zest, I think it was about 2 teaspoons. That also contributes to the lemon flavor, so consider that too. This is a nice pie that is very easy to make.

I used the juice of two large lemons and I think that was a bit too much because the filling was fairly runny. It did thicken in the fridge but became runny again when sitting out at a party.

Used only 1 cream cheese. Mixed cream cheese and condensed milk with mixer 5 or more min. before adding 1/3 cup lemon juice, rind, and 1 tsp. vanilla. Be sure and let cream cheese get room temp. Very important.  Made my own graham cracker crust.  Added lemon rind on top of pie.

Fantastic and so easy to make. Too sour for my taste but everyone loved it, except the kids! It's a great adult dessert, but not for most kids.

Easy and tasty.  I tend to add more juice than it calls for to make it tart and I top it with a container of extra creamy Cool Whip.

really good...I needed to add quite a bit more lemon juice and zest to get the lemony tart taste I was looking for but it was sooo easy and quick to make...I garnished with blueberries!

I took the initiative to make this slightly more healthy so as not to feel so guilty indulging. I'm so glad I did because this is amazing! I made my own graham cracker crust- 1 package reduced fat graham crackers, 1 packet of truvia no calorie sweetener and 2 tbls melted butter- baked in the oven for about 10 minutes. Then for filling I used one fat free cream cheese and one regular, 1 packet of truvia no cal sweetener, fat free sweetended condensed milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and the zest and juice of only 1 lemon. Creamy light and delicious- in my  opinion the perfect summer desert- especially for cheesecake lovers! i'll keep this is a desert staple in my cookbook for sure.

A fantastically easy pie to make.  I added an egg yolk to firm it up as I'd put too much lemon juice.  It worked out well.

Wonderful and oh so easy.  I used just a little less sweetened condensed milk to cut down on the sugar content. Very creamy.

Awesome! This is my boyfriend's favorite dessert so I was nervous about choosing a recipe to follow, but I'm so glad I chose this one. He said it was the best he's ever had and everyone who tasted it keeps bugging me to make another one.

Not bad, but I will take the reviewer's advice from below and use the zest of 4 lemons next time. My guests enjoyed the pie but I thought it could use more lemon flavor and I believe the extra zest will do the trick.

Yummy, easy pie!  Only reason I did not give this 5 stars was even using 3 lemons for the zest and juice, we still could barely taste any lemon.  I guess we just like a lot of tang in our lemon or lime pies.  This recipe is definitely a keeper but I will up the lemon substantially in the future.

made this tonight for dessert.  Used fat-free condensed milk.  Topped with Lite Cool Whip and it was a hit!  Good flavor and not too sweet or tart -- just the right combination of ingredients.  Both my daughters asked for the recipe! Thank you for submitting this one.

Love this pie! It's so easy! The proportions are good, but I added one more lemon's zest for a tangier flavor. Just taste before filling crust to get the lemon to your liking. I topped it with blueberries. Thanks for a great, easy recipe, Heather!

Oh, this was really good, even better than I expected.    This is a creamy and versatile go-to no-bake cheesecake recipe that everyone should have on hand.  I made my own graham cracker crust and used Neufchatel cheese and fat-free s.c. milk.  I also made sure to put in plenty of lemon zest, which not only adds bright flavor but also happy specks of color.  Be sure to do a taste test after mixing everything together to see if anything needs added (sugar, more zest, etc.)  I'm thinking of trying a vanilla pie next!

Very good and fast. I only purchased one lemon for zesting and juicing and used 1/3 cup of "fake" lemon (the kind in the plastic lemon container) to save money. Once mixed, I felt it needed more lemon flavor, so I added extra. I love lime, so I added a dash of that too.

I took this pie to a church pie sale and it was delicious.  It did melt, probably because it did not freeze long enough, but it still tasted good like that.  Several people even asked for the recipe.  This is so easy, I will make it many more times to come!

This isn't the recipe I was hoping it would be. It was nowhere near sweet enough, and I ended up having to add the zest of 4 lemons to get anywhere close to a real "lemony" flavor. It was just very flat tasting.

Yum Yum Yum Yum Yum... we thought this was fantastic!! Did not use the lemon rind as i hate bits if rind in any food - but will maybe try it next time as this was a little light on the lemon tang, and i used 2 lemons! But all the same was absolutely delicous and will be made again and again in my house!

This is such a great recipe that never fails!  I agree to add 1 more lemon (or you can cheat and use 1/4 cup concentrated lemon juice) and for an extra creamy touch, I add 1 teaspoon of vanilla!

This pie is wonderful.  I used 3/4 c of lemon juice instead of juicing and zesting lemons (just to save time).  I served it for Sunday lunch and it was gone in minutes.  I added a little bit of yellow food coloring just for looks.

Wonderful smooth creamy pie.  I made it on a whim 2 hrs before company came because I needed a quick dessert that I could use my lemons on.  Everybody loved it and said it was delicious.  I did not use any whipped topping on it but that would probably have made it creamier.  I did use more lemon rind than was called for because I really love that lemon flavor.  I just added this one to my recipe file.

I used 3/4 Cup lemon juice and the zest of a whole lemon.  I like to use vanilla wafer crust more than graham wafer.  I used an 8X8 square pan, to make it more like squares instead of a pie.  It worked very nicely.  This is my favorite lemon icebox/cheesecake recipe, and I've been looking a long time!  I will definately make this again.

I made this exactly as the recipe states. So easy !! Delicious and refreshing. Slight sweetness from condensed milk but lemon flavor comes through. Next time I think I will make my own graham cracker crust for a fraction of the price. Thanks for a great easy recipe. Yum!

I used 1 pkg of cream cheese instead of 2, 1 small cool whip in its place, the zest and juice of 3 lemons, 4 drops of lemon essential oil and a few drops of yellow food coloring. I whipped it all up fluffy. My family LOVED it!!

It was easy; good but a little thick. 
Would try with cool whip mixed in.

This recipe was perfect!  I had 4 very large lemons. I used the rind of all four and only the juice of 2 lemons. Of course you need to add in increments until you get the perfect taste of lemon. Mine came out light, sweet with just the right amount of lemon taste. I made a graham cracker crust from scratch as well. Great spring/summer dessert. Thanks!

I am rating on this recipe as it is.   If others had rated it as-is then myself and others may have been saved this trouble.   It is way too cheesy and not sweet or lemony enough.   It was in fact very sticky and hard to even slice, despite the care I took to beat it extra well.   I followed the instructions to the tee but unfortunately didn't look at the reviews first.    This recipe should be avoided.     I actually should give this 1-star but I'm trying to be nice.   That said, a new recipe of this with the changes that the other reviewers made should replace this one.

I made this dessert for Easter dinner and it was a big hit.  I made a gluten free shell and decorated the top with candy Easter eggs.  Everyone thought it was delicious and I enjoyed the ease of preparation.

Found it to have too much cream cheese.
I might make it again but I'd add more lemon juice to cut the cream cheese.

I made this exactly according to the recipe.  The juice of 2 lemons, in my opinion, is not nearly lemony enough.  (I use the ratio of 3 T of juice in a lemon)  I think next time I will use 9 T or the juice of 3 lemons.  I also didn't know what to do about measuring the zest, so just used whatever came off the lemons.  It was very good and fast.  Very firm when cut.

I followed the recipe to a tee. It didn't set, it was awful tasting. When I discovered that it wasn't going to set I tasted it. Horrible. I started adding powdered sugar until the taste was alright. Then In froze it . This way it is edible. Won't waste time or money on this recipe again.

So, after reading many reviews I am adding my review from a male perspective and from someone who is not a cook or baker.  Even I managed to get this dessert to come out quite tasty and would do it again.   Amazed at how easy it was to make.   I did have a hard time trying to determine the amount of lemon juice to use as everyone says an amount would be easier.  So, I microwaved the cream cheese  (two 8 oz bars) to soften, then I beat the cream for about 2 mins until creamy.  Then I added the sweetened condensed milk  beat on high to  blend well, then I added the lemon juice and zest which incorporated (I word I see often with cooking, lol).   I actually beat probably more then incorporated, it was creamy when I poured into the crust.   So my only concern was if I added too much lemon would the pie not set in the shell, but after three hours in the refrigerator it was ready.   It was light and lemony, I could have used more lemon juice  but it was good.

Changes for my next pie are (1) Sample the batter for amount of lemon flavor.  I tossed some lemon juice for fear of not setting up but I could have used more lemon flavor, (2) someone recommended freezing the pie, with the  1/4  of pie left over I chilled and loved it .  It did not freeze, even after setting over night.  Definitely will make again!

So delicious!  I ended up only using one package of cream cheese instead of two and I think the consistency of the pie was just so much better that way.  I also topped it with some whipped cream and shaved lemon rind.  Yum!  I made it on Easter for the family and it was a hit!

Excellent. I used bottled lemon juice and made a shortcrust pastry from this site, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. And when I make it again, and make it again I will, but I will use  a baked crust - pastry or graham.  It set up beautifully, the lemon taste was perfect - my guests thoroughly enjoyed every bite.  UPDATE: the filling made far more than enough for one pie so I made two pies, freezing the second. When I served it to company several days later it was every bit as good as when freshly made.  I just added some whipped cream to the top to serve.

Made this Pie for a small group Bible Study I teach. This was my first time making this recipe so I was not sure how it would come out. Let me say this pie was a huge hit everyone who tried it loved it. This was a very easy pie to make. I love lemon flavored desserts so I gave this one a try. I did make a few changes. I didn't have fresh lemon so I used bottled lemon 1/4 cup x2 and I added a box a lemon pudding mix. It worked out fine they love it and asked me to make another for next week. Thanks Ms. Heather for the recipe.

I read every review & using their recommendations the pie was outstanding & is a wonderful dessert to serve to family and guests.  I always leave  cream cheese out overnite to soften & avoid the little lumps.   To avoid the "cream cheese flavor" I added  1/4 cup sugar to the cream cheese and beat the two together for 5 minutes.   I then added the condensed milk and 1 tsp. of vanilla, the juice of 2 very large lemons and all the zest from both lemons.  I did not care for the prepared graham cracker crust so next time will make my own crust or as some suggested use the shortbread crust.  Other than that, it is a delicious dessert.

I have made this recipe many times and always with rave reviews.  This time I beat it for an extra 5 minutes like suggested from another review and it was extremely creamy.  So that will help for those that think it's a little grainy.

Amazing.  BF would have eaten the whole pie if I let him.  Didn't change a thing except used low-fat version of cream cheese and sweetened condensed milk.  Will definitely make again.

This is delicious.  I wanted something a tad bit lighter so I only used 1 package of cream cheese and used 1/2 of a small container of cool whip.  I grated the lemon zest on top of the pie!  Wow super yummy!

My first attempt at making this, and it turned out LOVELY! I had some cool whip for the top, but guests were already complaining about it being too rich! That's a bad thing?????

Recipe was very good, substituted Gluten free crust by grinding 8oz GF ginger snap cookies and 6tblsp melted butter to make crust. Bake in pie dish for 7mins , cool and add filling. Bumped up lemon juice to 3 lemons as well. Big Hit!!

so easy to make and everyone loved it! I like that it has no eggs. Concerns me to make the one with eggs uncooked.

Having tried this recipe I think the cream cheese should have been FOUR OUNCE, NOT EIGHT.  I intended to double the recipe and make two pies and looking at the mixing bowl I realized there's no way 32 ounces of cream cheese and 2 cans of condensed milk will fit into 2 nine inch pie shells!  I used 2 8 ounce cream cheese packages with 2 cans of milk and lemon juice/peels as listed and it came out wonderful!!  Two full pie shells.

This is a great pie deelish!  But like others I only used one cream cheese and the juice of 3 lemons and their zest I also followed my mother's pie crust recipe of pulverized vanilla wafers mixed with 2 tbspns of melted butter. Bake the crust for 8 to 10 minutes, let cool then add lemon mix.

EXCELLENT! 
I know that there are people complaining it is not sweet enough, but to be honest, my German taste buds can't handle the overly sweet American desserts most of the time and I usually have to pass on things like these. But not this one! 
The reason this dessert is so successful at all the parties etc I take it to, is actually BECAUSE it is wonderfully tart and sooo incredible lemony!

Fantastic! I used only 1 package of 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it was perfect. Other than that I followed the recipe to a tee. No leftovers to be had.

I made it with a 8 ounce cream cheese, juice of 3 lemons and a can of condensed milk. I baked it for 20 minutes, allowed it to cool and refrigerated overnight. 

 Topped it with pineapple topping before serving and it was great.

I made this as directed but added an extra teaspoon of lemon zest for tartness.  Still could of been a bit more tart but overall this recipe rocks! I will definitely make it for guests as it is so quick and easy!  I think next time I will use low fat cream cheese and light condensed milk since I am dieting just to alleviate some of the guilt. :)

I used the juice of 3 lemons, lemon zest, and finally some concentrated lemon juice, and this still just tasted like cream cheese with a slight lemon twist. I was afraid to add any more as it was getting very liquid and I was afraid it wouldn't set up. Didn't matter, it tasted awful, I might as well just eat cream cheese with a spoon.

I made this recipie as is and would give it 4 stars easily. It was a hit with the family. I think next time I make this I will make a few changes... I used a springform pan, and it was pretty thin. It made 8 thin slices. I will also use 4 lemons, not just 2. I love love love lemons, and really expected more of a lemony flavor. But like I said, it was a hit, as is.

This was great and although it's annoying, when people tweek recipes to death, this did need sugar in my opinion.  Depend on how you like your pie. I used a store bought crust, will make my own next time and used key limes because I love key lime and lemon pie.  This was great, you do have to keep tasting to make sure you're not making it too tart.  I think I juiced about 5 limes, but only a little zest.  I did sub. one brick for fat free and added a teaspoon of corn starch.  I put it in the freezer and it stayed firm, even when I put it in the fridge later.  I will play around with this one. The sky's the limit.  Maybe strawberry next!

I thought this was pretty good, but you must let it sit longer than two hours.  More like two days.  It gets better the longer it sits in the refrigerator.  Also, use a juicer, just a manual one will do, and use the zest from both lemons.  It's not too cheesey, and it's plenty sweet.  This is downright refreshing in the heat of the summer.

Make sure your cream cheeese is softened, otherwise you get globs of it in the pie. I used the zest of two lemons, and thought the taste was great.

Made this exactly as specified. Everyone loved the taste, but it didn't set up properly.. My lemons were really big and I'm wondering if that put too much liquid into the pie.  Next time I'll just make it into a parfait and serve with berries on top. No pie crust needed!

Very good. I made this for my boyfriend because it is his favorite kind of pie and I didnt have a recipe. Used the Graham Cracker Crust I on this site and it turned worked quite well - much better than store bought :)  The pie seemed a little heavy - may substitute 4 oz of heavy cream whipped for a package of cream cream (or just add it in - because it adds no extra calories right?)   I tasted the filling and thought it could be more tart; however, after the pie sat a day the flavor was excelent!  I will be making this again!

OMG! My fam went crazy for this recipe! I used 2 cans of condensed milk instead of one, and I used the lemon juice from the bottle in lieu of fresh lemons (I just added and tasted until it tasted right to me). Also, I used a homemade/self-made graham cracker crust: crunch up graham crackers, mix in sugar and melted butter, and put into container that mix is going in and line it up all up the sides. They think I went through exhaustive measures for this icebox pie, but it was SO EASY to make! Def new fam fav tradition!

My family thought this pie was excellent.  I garnished it with sweetened cream and lemon slices. I made the pie exactly as the recipe stated, but since we like it really tart I added the juice of a 3rd lemon.  Will for sure make again.  thanks!!

I thought this pie had great consistency and texture, looked beautiful, but lacked that lemony zing.  It needs more lemon flavor in my opinion.

Wow! Yum. The reviews were true - this was easy and delicious. We had it for Easter dessert, and I expected it to be the 'adult' choice, with cupcakes for the kids. At least some of the kids actually preferred the pie (and the cupcakes had sprinkles!) I used half regular cream cheese and half neufchatel (lower fat) and found the taste to be wonderful. A very refreshing, not too-sweet, not too-tart dessert for anytime. Easy, quick, delicious - what's not to love?!

Perfect! I made it for Easter and followed the recipe exactly. I thought it was wonderful. Creamy, not too sweet, and very refreshing. I garnished it with some curls of lemon rind. I'm looking forward to trying the lowfat version everyone keeps mentioning. If I could have this pie and feel less guilty about it that would be fantastic!

Each bite tasted like a spoonful of lemon-flavored cream cheese. I would try to blend in some whipped cream to lighten up the texture.

Fab-u-lous!  My lemons were small so I zested 2 (1 loose tsp) and juiced 3 (1/2 c).  I did add 1/2 tsp vanilla (had to, ;^) couldn't believe such an easy recipe would taste so good). Pie was 5 stars just plain, but then we put real whipped cream and about a heaping tbls of sugared strawberries on top and it was even better!

Awesome pie!  I like my very tart so I added 2extra lemons worth of juice and all the zest of the 6 lemons!  Also, my brood likes a clash of flavors.  Nothing is better then doing this pie in a Oreo or chocolate cookie crust!  Try it you will love it!

This pie was really creamy and tasty, but I wish I hadn't taken the advice of the other reviewers--juice of 3 lemons made it too lemon-y for my taste and the recipe would've been perfect as written.  I only had 1.5 packages of cream cheese, so I added 4 oz. of cool-whip to the mixture.  A nice summer treat.

I thought this recipe should be 2 stars, my husband said 4 so I compromised. It was just about the easiest dessert to make, but I don't know why the flavor didn't do it for me. I felt it tasted just like cream cheese with lemon flavor. I am definitely in the minority because all of the wonderful reviews. I was very surprised I didn't like this because I love both lemon and cream cheese. I may have expected more of a "lemon cheesecake"; I'm just not sure.

My mom has always made this recipe (except she adds cherry pie filling to the top).  I'm not big on cherries, so I made my own variations.  Sometimes I make it just like this recipe, sometimes I use key lime juice and a little green food color.  Very yummy either way!

Perfect. I used this to a dinner party where I did not know in advance what the menu would be, so I need something that would work with almost any type of food and not be too heave and this fit the bill perfectly. Wow what a hit. I did make a few changes. I used a shortbread cookie crust, 1/2 cup lemon juice concentrate and folded in 8 oz of cool wip.

Sinful!! I loved the ease of preparing this. For a slight variation I added some powdered ginger to my graham crust. It really complimented the lemon flavour, and the whole pie disappeared in record time from my Easter table!

The pie was very simple to make, so I wasn't surprised or disappointed when it didn't have a very complex flavor.  I love lemons and lemonade, and made this more tart by using the juice of 3 fresh lemons and the zest of one lemon.  We did not top it with whipped cream, but I'm sure that would be delicious, too.  Or I might try dusting it with a little powdered sugar next time.

I added about 1 tbsp more of lemon juice. I love lemon flavor!!! I think the recipe is very good. The extra lemon juice did not thin the recipe. My family love this pie! Will make this again. This is not my first time making lemon icebox pie.

I have been making a version of this pie for years! I was reading the reviews and saw the suggestion to beat the mixture for a full 5 min.  I thought, sure why not? My husband raved about the "fluffy cheesecake" for days! 
It was airy, light, mousse like. Creamy, tart ( our preference) and we topped it with cherry pie filling and just a dab of whipped cream.  Needless to say the leftovers after our dinner party didn't last long.

My daughter and I loved this easy pie! I am not much of a cook or baker but I read the reviews and made a few changes. I also listened to one reviewer and tasted the filling before assembling — thanks! I used one and a half packages of cream cheese, a small tin of condensed milk (the only size I see in Canada) and the zest and juice of 3 lemons (rather large ones). I kept it in the freezer and cut slices and added whipped cream as needed (letting it thaw a bit before serving).

This is the best Lemon pie I have ever had.  The only thing that I did extra was add extra lemon juice, and lemon zest.  I have made this many times, because it’s my husband’s favorite!

It was delicious!!! I did add the 1/4 sugar and the vanilla as per the recommendations.  It set up perfectly.  I am definitely adding this to my dessert rotation.  It was smooth and creamy with just the right of tang.

I followed the receipe exactly. I always do that first before making any changes to my liking.  It was really good and if you like lemon this will satisfy. I gave it 4 stars because I think this is just way to sweet, at least in my opinion.  I would make it again but i will definetly cut back on the sugar and lemon curd. Lemon curd is very sweet so I don't think it needs that much on it.

I never thought this pie was going to set after pouring it into the crust so i added an  addition1/2 block of cream cheese hoping that would help.  After a couple hours, it didn't look much better.  I then placed it in the freezer and voila, it set beautifully.  I used the juice of 3 lemons and added more zest to tone down the cream cheese flavor.  Everyone really liked this pie. The only disappointment was that the filling was shallow.   Don't give up on this pie.  It is delish.

I won our family's holiday dessert competition with this pie!  I used 12 ounces of cream cheese, juiced 3 lemons and zested 3 and a half lemons. This was an excellent easy to follow recipe.  I  made the graham cracker crust from scratch and recommend homemade  so you have a thick, crispy, buttery crust for such a great filling.  Finally, I added whipped cream and blue berries around the edge of my pie.

My mother handed down this recipe. I don't use quite as much fresh lemon juice (only 4 T.), and Cool Whip on top is preferred over the meringue. So easy to make, and everyone loves it!

Made for lemon lover’s  birthday. Very well received.
I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a little more lemon zest.
I still found the lemon to be underwhelmed by the cream cheese. 
When I make it again, i may try reducing the cream cheese slightly or increasing the zest again, or I might try letting the filling “bloom” a bit before refrigerating

I knew this seemed too good to be true.   Like many other bakers I followed this recipe to a "T".  However, it did not set and was tasteless.  I even added more lemon zest, fresh lemon juice, and bottled lemon juice and the lemon flavor still just didn't come through.  If the recipe is a lemon icebox pie i expect to taste the lemon.  The consistency was so off putting that I ended up throwing the whole thing away after tasting one slice.  There are much better recipe options out there on this site that i have found which are WAAAAYYY better.  I'll stick to those recipes instead...

So easy! I used 8 oz cream cheese and folded in about 8 oz cool whip, the juice and zest of 2 fairly large lemons.  I made my own graham cracker crust and did not bake it just let it get cold before filling. The whole family loved it and I'm trying it again this weekend with limes for Father's Day.

Taste like lemon version of key lime pie.  Very tasty but way too sweet for me.  Will have to figure a way to cut down the sweetness next time.

This is so simple and so good! I made a fun variation to make it margarita. I used the juice of 4 small limes and the zest of 2, then 2 tbsp of tequila with a dash of salt across the top. The extra liquid made it slightly looser but the slices still held their shape. Delicious!

I will definitely be making this again.   I added cool whip to make it fluffier and make the cream cheese a little less subtle.  I'd also use more lemons next time.  I'm even thinking of replacing the lemons with limes.

It is spectacular in that it is devine plus more than easy to make.  Should be in frig more than 2 hours though. I will make it again in a larger pan with home made graham crust.  Sometime I will try it with lime instead, but I love lots of lemon.

Thanks

This pie is one of the easiest pies I have ever made and it had very good flavor also. What would I change? nothing really, perhaps a little more lemon juice. The family loved it and there was only one small piece left. Lighter dessert after dinner and it would be perfect for a summer dessert also. Great and easy recipe make it the day before your party and get all the oohs and ahs when it is served.

Super easy to make! I read some of the reviews and liked one that suggested using 1/2 C of lemon juice from concentrate, so I did that but added just a tablespoon more because I don't care for 'zest'.  We loved this recipe!

Excellent,  I made this to bring for a dinner party & it was delicious.  I like mine a bit more lemony so I used 2 lemons for juice & 3 for the peel.  I made sure to whip up the cream cheese very fluffy-so light & refreshing.  Will make this again!

Made this for 2 dinner parties in a row to rave reviews from all in attendance. So simple to make. Very creamy, not too sweet. Added a splash of limoncello to it. Will become a staple for many more dinners.

Followed the recipe but used low fat cream cheese, fat free condensed milk and reduced fat graham cracker pie crust.  Also used the juice of three lemons as another reviewer had recommended.  Was very pleased with the result and book club friends gave it positive reviews.

It was such an easy recipe.  The lemon was a mild flavor.  No citrus bite at all.  Wish I had topped it with whipped cream and fresh raspberries!

I  replaced the second package of  cream cheese with a cup of  lemon  yogurt  and added lemon juice to taste.  Our 300ml. can of condensed milk (10oz) was enough.  It set up fine.  Beat for a good 5 minutes and there was more than enough filling for a 9" pie.  Will definitely make again..next, will try it with lime yogurt.

This tasted lovely - very light and refreshing. I used the juice and zest of 2 large lemons. Other than that, I stuck to the recipe. There was plenty of filling and everyone enjoyed it. I will definitely make this again, perhaps with lime next time. Thank you for sharing.

I substituted lower fat ingredients or fat free ingredients,  where I could, (i.e, Cream cheese, and condensed milk) I also bought a Sugar free Strawberry spread ( Smuckers preferably) that really took it over the top.

I did follow the recipe but took the advice of reviewers who suggested a third lemon  that did the trick.  I also whipped it for about 5 minutes which really fluffed it up.  I’m considering freezing it next time to firm it up.  Bottom line, we all loved it. I will definitely make this again. A refreshing and light dessert.

Made the recipe just as given. We love it! It's very rich -- doesn't really need whipped cream topping, but I added it and like the contrast of flavors and textures. Great thing to make if you're invited somewhere to bring dessert. Effortless. Only problem I had was that some of the cream cheese ended up as soft lumps. Any suggestions about that? I thought I beat it enough.

I like to cook, but I'm not a baker - just never really had the inclination to learn, and I'm not a big desert guy. But when I saw this, and realized how incredibly easy it was to make, I gave it a try. I loved it! I made it exactly as written. I do think it could use more lemon, so as other reviewers have said, next time I'll up both the juice and zest.

This pie is  a great find, it was delicious. Next time I will try it with some whip topping to lighten it up. It was almost like cheesecake and I am not really a fan of cheesecake.

My wife has dairy allergies, so I substituted a Honey Chevre instead of cream cheese..

The pie is great, but turned out a bit runny and really tart...

Next ime i am trying it with only 1 lemon

I actually used this recipe to make a key lime pie.  I substituted 1/2 cup of Key Lime Juice.  My husband says he doesn't taste the difference between the one I have to use eggs and cook to this no bake pie.  Yeah!!!  I will actually try it with the lemon juice next.

Very easy to make. I used the zest of a hole lemon . I would have given it a 5 but the recipe calling for the juice of two lemons will never be the the same amount of juice. The pie turned out very good I will be making it again

I made this pretty much as written except used all the zest from the two lemons along with all the juice. The lemons were large and very juicy so they yielded about 1/3 cup of juice. After it chilled and set up, I covered it with fresh raspberries brushed with a little bit of melted raspberry jam to give it a shine. You could use any fruit and I think it helped cut the richness of the filling and it looked great. Next time I will assemble it in a rectangular or square pan so it can be cut into easier serving squares. Great recipe, thanks!

Made it and it tasted fantastic but it stayed soft...didn't quite set. It may be because the lemons were very juicy. Next time I thought I would use 3 packs of cream cheese.  The taste was great but I put more than 1 tsp lemon zest more like the zest from one whole lemon. Definitely good recipe.

Lol...I don't know why I am rating  this as I did not even have a piece! All gone by the time everyone was served...As I was hearing...A big hit!
I made it with a plain frozen crust from Crisco since that is what I had in freezer and 1 pkg of cream cheese and squeezed 2 lemons and some rind as well as threw in 1cup of cool whip...thats it... really easy...threw it in freezer for night and took it out to fridge next morning till we ate it later that afternoon.  I will have to make it again to taste it myself... 4 star because of ease and common ingredients I have in kitchen and because of comments I received.

Talk about easy, fast and delicious; everyone loved it, and I expect it to become a regular around our house.  I did increase the lemon juice because we prefer a tarter lemon flavor.  Thanks for a super recipe!

I followed directions  but used the zest of two whole  lemons and  sprinkled a few pieces of the zest on top for looks.  The pie was creamy, delicious and a big hit at Easter dinner.  I liked the simplicity, no bake method.

I followed it to the letter for the first pie... it was great

Second pie I added Sliced strawberries with a little sugar as a topping... Huge success. I will always add the strawberries from now on!

I made this dessert and was a bit disappointed: the filling did not set up firm, and the lemon flavour was weak.  If I make it again, I will increase the lemon zest for more flavour and add gelatin for structure.

This was a really nice and refreshing pie. I would call this a lemon cheesecake. It is also wonderful frozen and you can pull out a piece now and again and quick thaw it for a view seconds in the microwave. Will definitely be making this again. Yummy Yummy!

I only gave it a 4 because I only used one lemon and one 8 oz package of cream cheese. I also made my own whipping cream with heavy whipping cream and 1/2 cup of confection sugar.

Very good and easy to make! I used 4 tbsp juice from fresh lemons and zest from two whole lemons. I also took the advice from other reviews and substituted one cup of cool whip in place of one of the packages of cream cheese. It set up nicely and had a nice lemon flavor. I garnished it with fresh strawberries. I will be making this one again.

This was ver y good! I second (third, fourth...) the advice to blend the cream cheese really well right at the start. I'm lucky enough to have a stand mixer, so I threw the cream cheese in the bowl, started the mixer, and went about doing other cooking stuff. Added the condensed milk, went and did other things.

It does take pretty much all night to really set up, so it's best to make this the day before. Also it's quite rich, so cut those slices small.

Made this several times now; sometimes on homemade crust, store bought Oreo crust or minis on mini vanilla waters.  Everyone loves it no matter which method I use.  Followed the tip to freeze before serving and it's a great treat on a hot day!

I love how easy this is to make! Made a few modifications though:  Instead of sweetened condensed milk, I used vanilla yogurt. I would also try Kefir or the following: To create a dairy-free and sugar-free alternative to 1 cup of sweetened condensed milk, place 3/4 cup of tofu and 3/4 cup of honey in a blender; blend until smooth and store in the refrigerator. Also, lacks flavor, so I would add tsp of vanilla or something; I also added berries on top - you could use any kind you want.

Excellent recipe as is. I never, ever review a recipe if I change it in any way. However, I am this time. Why? Maybe my review can help another person. Because of a past disease, my mom has very little sense of taste left. One of the very few things she can taste is lemon. I prepared the pie filling per directions and tasted it. It was delicious! Then, so my mom could enjoy the pie, I added ten crushed hard lemon candies (I used sugar-free Lemonheads.) The lemon candy added that lemon tartness she needed to be able to taste this pie. Mom LOVED the pie and when I sent the whole thing home with her, she gladly accepted it. I imagine she will finish off this lemon pie in short order! I will prepare the pie again for my family per directions.

I followed the advice to use 1/2 the cream cheese and add in cool whip. I also froze it. It tasted like a cream-cheese and lemon flavored ice cream. The texture was good but there was something a little off. I probably won't make it again, but it still got a few compliments.

I used only 1 pkg of low fat cream cheese & increased the lemon juice and zest. Added 1 tsp vanilla extract. It was fabulous.

This was a big hit at Christmas dinner with friends & family. Turns out more people prefer pies without nuts (except me, but I wasn't eating them all myself). I subbed a half cup of bottled lemon juice for the fresh, and skipped the zest. Still good, easier, and very silky.

I made my own crust (3/4 c grahams, 3T clarified butter, 1/4c slivered almonds), and used 1 package of neufchatel and 1 package of cream cheese with greek yogurt to cut calories. I also used fat-free condensed milk. You should do it; it tastes phenomenal, and I'm not the type to sacrifice flavor for health, LOL. You won't miss the calories. This was great. My brother in law and husband scarfed it down, and had no idea that it was a (relatively) low calorie dish.

Love this recipe. It is super easy. I did modify it a little. Like someone else suggested, I use 1 package cream cheese and 1 cup cool whip. I like the texture and flavor better this way. I also use 1 lemon and 1 lime. Or, I use 1 lemon and 1.5 teaspoons of lavender extract. You will see both in my picture.

We loved this pie. It has just the right amount of tang. Very mild which was perfect for us, not to sour.  The only thing I did differently  was I added blueberries. It was a hit at our party!!

Although I did make a change this recipe still deserves 5 stars. I only used 1 pkg cream cheese because of preference. We wanted a lemon pie not cheesecake!

Awesome dessert!   Like those who recommended it, I only used one block of cream cheese and a cup of Cool Whip.  I also zested two lemons right into the mixing bowl, so I probably ended up with more zest than the recipe called for.  Will definitely make again!

Yum, so good-light and refreshing.  Only 4 ingredients - easy, and takes only minutes to make - what a great recipe.  Followed the recipe exactly, except used the zest from both lemons, just because I could, but would have been good with only the 1 tsp too.  Took it to work twice already, and everyone says it's their favorite.  I am going to try it with key limes next time.

A perfect lemon icebox pie! I also only had 8-oz. cream cheese, so I put a little more than a cup of CoolWhip Free and whipped it together. I love that it was just the right amount of lemon juice and zest....Not overly lemony, but just right!

This was a nice refreshing desert.  I did add a container of yoplait light lemon cream pie yogurt, and about a cup of cool whip to the mixture.  Just made a little more filling.  A great summer time recipe.

Love this recipe!  I've been looking for this recipe for awhile.  So ridiculously easy, my 4 and 6 year old made it.  Definitely like to use a little extra lemon to kick up the tartness.  A definite keeper!

This was really good, I felt like it was almost cheese cake-y though, so I'm going to try half cream cheese and half cool whip. Wish me luck!

This recipe is awesome!!!! I had some difficulty getting the cream cheese whipped; however, I'm pretty sure it's because the cheese was not room temp. When recipe calls for "soft" it means it! But finished product was soooooooooo delicious to have so few ingredients. Thanks Heather, it'll be a keeper around here!

I used 6 Tbl. Lemon juice cause I knew my Meyer Lemons were a bit big. (that was one lemon) and 2 teas zest. It took more than 2 hours to set up I'd say et it set in fridge over night. And only had a faint hint of lemon flavor. This pie worked well since my oven broke and I couldn't use it. I'm sure on a hot day it would be great. I like more lemon flavor myself. My husband liked it but didn't love it. He did eat most of it himself. Very cream cheesey.

Great, I'm sitting here after my first couple bites smiling!  I'm not a huge lemon fan, but I do really like a more subtle lemon flavor and I love cheesecake!  So, this is wonderful for anyone wanting a light lemon flavor.  I wouldn't change a thing!

I loved this! My daughters aren't lemon fans but they really loved this pie and have been asking me to make it again. I found that it needs to be refridgerated longer than 2 hours to properly set. Other than that, it's a wonderfully delicious pie and so easy to make!

This was my 1st crack at Lemon Icebox Pie and it was DELISH!  I took the advise of adding the juice of 4 lemons and the zest of 3.  The zest of 3 was a bit much but still to die for!  Making it again this weekend but with a little

This is a very refreshing tasting pie.  I did add 1/2 squeezed lemon juice and just as much zest to suit our taste. Easy to make. Thanks for sharing!

Great pie for a hot day. I used 3 lemons for the juice and zest, gave it a little stronger lemon taste, which we like. Topped it off with Cool Whip. Yummy!

This is a great recipe. Zest both of your lemons and use it all, you'll be glad you did. Add a little yellow food coloring to make it beautiful :) I absolutely cannot get enough of lemon and lime recipes like this!

This is such a delicious, easy to make pie!  It was a great finish to a otherwise 'heavy dinner'.  I did look at the reviews and decided to add 1/4 C sugar.  I also used the juice of one extra lemon, because I had so many (made it a bit less set) but not to the point of being a problem.  I used Meyer Lemons and it worked great!  I made it even easier by using a pre-made graham cracker crust!  Ate practically the whole pie by myself.  I'm going to try to figure out how to turn it into a cheesecake that you bake!

This has become a staple of the holiday desert table in our family. The only thing we change is the crust. Graham cracker is good, but Keebler's shortbread crust is amazing with this!

This was excellent! I made my own graham cracker crust, with real butter, and baked for a few minutes, then cooled. My lemons were on the small size, so I used 5 lemons and a couple teaspoons of zest. It's not overly sweet, so I topped with sweetened strawberries in syrup, and it was a hit! I love the texture, and don't think it needs to be lightened like some have suggested. Thanks, I'll make again.

I changed this a little using what i had on hand. Changes were- lemon extract(3tsp) instead of lemon zest, 1/2 cup of lemon juice from bottle instead of fresh lemons. Lemon flavor was just right. Instead of sweeten condense milk i use 12oz can of evaporated milk and 1/3 cup organic sugar. I refrigerated pie for 2hrs than froze for 3hrs. Very good, especially with whipped cream on top! Filling enough for two pies.

This was simple and easy and yummy. I tried to lighten it up by using a reduced fat graham cracker crust, lo-fat cream cheese, and non fat sweetened condensed milk mixed with regular sweetened condensed milk (I had doubled the recipe and made two pies - one for the neighbors). My family loved it.

Quick to prepare with foolproof results. Tastes like old fashioned lemon icebox pie is supposed to taste.  Happy to find a recipe that doesn't require egg yolks. Next time I'm trying lime juice and zest.

I served this pie for Mother's Day, and it was a big hit. I'm only giving it 4 stars because it didn't set up very well. I refrigerated it overnight, so I'm not sure what happened. I did add an extra bit of lemon juice, so it may have been my fault. We topped it with whipped cream, and it gave it a nice balance of sweet and tangy flavors. Nice dish for summer.
