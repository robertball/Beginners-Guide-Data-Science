These sound great, but they are not Korean. I live in Korea and can not get half of the ingredients needed. I will try to make them when I go to the USA next vacation.

Get over the Korean title already and just make them. Who really cares if these are authentic Korean or not? They are great and that is what matters to me. The one suggestion/improvement I have to offer is to use Panko instead. Just my opinion....
