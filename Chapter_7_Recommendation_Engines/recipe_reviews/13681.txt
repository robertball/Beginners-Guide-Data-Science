Wow!  This was the hit of Thanksgiving!  It is very creamy and rich, so if you don't care for very sweet sweet potatoes, I suggest omitting the 1/2 c. of white sugar.  I only used 1T of vanilla (that was plenty!), 3 extra large eggs, and added a sprinkle of cinnamon.  I do think that the recipe is a bit vague when it came to the topping though.  My topping came out perfectly and here's what I did.  I let the butter come to room temp and cubed it.  I mixed it with the other topping ingredients until the butter was well blended, there should be no loose flour or sugar.  I baked it uncovered and had to let it go about 45 minutes.  At 30 minutes, the top was still watery.  You MUST leave it in until the topping is crisp on the edges and firm in the middle, that’s what makes it so good.  I didn't see a need to double the topping recipe.  This recipe is perfect to make the day before.  Just make the sweet potato part, cover, and put in the refrigerator overnight.  Make the topping right before you pop it in the oven and it’s perfect!

I made these twice, the first time I followed the recipe and found the potatoes to be a little too sweet for my familys taste but LOVED the topping.  The second time I used your topping & I mashed the potatoes with a little cream, butter, cinnamon s&p &1 tsp vanilla.  They were SOOO good.  I had all 15 of my guests raving & asking for the recipe.

My entire family LOVED this recipe! It was such a hit. I used my mix master fitted with the wire whisk attachment to cream all the casserole ingredients together, and it worked really well. It turned out so smooth and creamy. I added about 3 tsp of cinnamon, and about 2 tsp of nutmeg which I think, was a really nice addition. I had a little trouble with the topping. Nothing serious, it may have been my fault actually (I might have measured the butter wrong I later realized) . It wasn't crumbly at all so I added extra flour and brown sugar until it got to the consistency that I was happy with. I mixed about 1 cup of chopped pecans in the the butter/sugar mixture and evenly sprinkled it on top. I then used 1 small bag (about a cup) of whole pecans and made a boarder around the edge. (The whole pecans got toasted during the cooking process and were SO GOOD!) I then sprinkled just a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg on top. I was able to make this in the morning and cover it and chill it until that evening when I put it in the oven. DELICIOUS! This will be added to the Family Holiday Faves! Thank so so much for sharing the recipe!

This was the most amazing sweet potato recipe I have ever eaten..everyone was licking their plates.. I couldn't keep my daughter out of the pan.. she had a spoon in her hands the whole time and when you would turn around she was eating it... so if you are having many people to dinner, you better make two of these recipes.. when I bought my potatoes I made sure I got all the same size.. then I cooked one in the microwave to see how much potatoe I would get.. it yields 1/2 cup so then I put 7 sweet potatoes in a 9x12 pan in a 400 degree oven for 1 1/2 hrs until they were well done then took out all the sweet potatoe with a spoon.. it was exactly 4 cups.. I used 1/3 cup sugar and 1/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar because I like the flavor of brown sugar in sweet potatoes and added 1/2 tsp salt to the mixture, it brings out more of the flavor.. I also baked it an additional 10 min.. all ovens are different.. I was told I have to make another one today for the left over turkey...

I made this for Easter dinner.  I LOVE sweet potatoes, but hate the mess of "candying" them.  This was the perfect solution.  I used canned sweet potatoes to cut down on prep time and cut the sugar in half.  I also just mixed all topping ingredients without the butter, then melted the butter and drizzled it on top.  I also used only 1 egg, as I didn't want to take a chance on the dish being runny.  It was excellent.  Just sweet enough, and the vanilla added the perfect touch.  Will make this often.

Wonderful! I got so many compliments on this dish. It is sweet, but its a nice compliment to a Holiday dinner. I added more brown sugar and marshmallows for a nice thick topping. Thank you!

I used walnuts instead of pecans to give it a hearty flavor and texture.  I also whipped the sweet potatoe mixture in my Kitchen Aid mixer for about 2 minutes to make it nice and fluffy.  It turned out great.  People who didn't like sweet potatoes even ate it- no left overs!

AWESOME! I did make a few changes. I used brown sugar instead of white and used only two eggs to give it more of a mashed sweet potato feel instead of a pie texture. Oh, I cut the vanilla back to one tablespoon, it's plenty.I also added  1/4 teaspoon salt, it really enhances the flavor. I've made this many times and I never used all the topping,
I like it to resemble a side dish, not dessert. But everyone loves it and we have it numerous times throughout the winter months. Thank you!

This is fantastic. I am required to make this every Thanksgiving! I did make a few changes. I used brown sugar instead of white and used only two eggs to give it more like mashed sweet potatoes and less like pie. I cut the vanilla back to one tablespoon, it is enough flavor without being overpowering. I also added 1/4 teaspoon salt, it really enhances the flavor. I've made this many times and I never used all the topping, I like it to resemble a side dish, not dessert. The kids love it and it has converted more than one "I hate sweet potatoes" resister.

Don't go by the photograph in this recipe.  It absolutely doesn't do this dish justice!  Once you try this recipe it will become a Thanksgiving tradition, it is that good!  I wouldn't even consider making sweet potatoes any other way for our Thanksgiving dinner.  I have even made this several days ahead and froze it, then took it out of the freezer the night before and left it on the counter until I took the turkey out of the oven.  While the turkey was sitting waiting to be carved, I popped this dish in the oven as well as a few others for about 20 minutes and everything was ready to go all at the same time with very little effort on my part!  Easily a five star dish!!!

I have made these for several years for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  This is by far the best sweet potato recipe I have ever made.  The only changes I make is I do only use two eggs instead of four.  I prefer the consistency with only two eggs.  Great recipe and beautiful on the holiday table!

I have made these at the holidays for about 3 years in a row now and they are always asked for again.  Make sure to choose a large dish for baking, as potato mixture will pouf a bit while cooking. I bake my sweat potatos the day before, mix and refridgerate until next day.  Pop in the oven when the turkey comes out to rest and be carved, works for me!

This is my all time favorite sweet potatoe recipe. I usually halve the eggs and forget the heavy cream and it still comes out good. I also add a little more sugar if the sweet potatoes aren't sweet enough. The pralines are what makes it, so yummy! I use room temp butter and then hand cream w=them with the flour and brown sugar till it has a smooth consitency. Do not use melted butter, trust me, I tried it both ways!

Delicious!!! I substituted canned yams (rinsed well),  only 3 eggs, and I cooked it for 45 minutes rather than 30 (to make sure it wasn't too liquidy).  Turned out great!  Topping is the very best part - WOW - yummy!!!!  The sweet potato part underneath was just a tad watery, but that could be because I used canned yams instead of fresh.  The only thing I didn't like was the overwhelming vanilla extract flavor - it was way too strong for my taste.  Next time I'll use 3 eggs again instead of 4, but will use fresh sweet potatoes and only 1 Tbsp of vanilla extract.  Highly recommend this recipe to anyone who loves sweet (because this one is!) sweet potato casserole.  DEE-LISH!

Everyone loved this recipe!  Very very good.  Easy to make up ahead and sprinkle the topping on just before you pop  it in the oven.  

I cut the white sugar in half and you could even use less and it would still be very good.  Used a scant cup of brown sugar for the topping and had some of that left.  Everyone had seconds!  YUM!!

I've been using this recipe every Thanksgiving & Christmas since I found it 9 years ago. I do NOT like sweet potatoes. Would never touch them but always had a can for my mother at holidays. I found this recipe and couldn't stop eating them!! All my guests rave about them and ask for the recipe.  I love 'do-ahead' recipes and this is one of my favorites.  Made a convert out of me!

This recipe is such a hit everytime I make it, everyone wants the recipe. Even if you thought you didnt like sweet pototoes, give this a try. I cut back the mega calories by using regular 1% or 2% milk instead of the cream. I also add nutmeg which really gives a nice flavor. I cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup instead, there is plenty with 1/2 flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar.

I've made this for the last 6 Thanksgivings and it's always a hit.  We are not sweet potato eaters, but this is delicious.  Everyone loves the topping, so I usually double the amount. It does make a lot, but you probably won't have too many leftovers.

This is the second Thanksgiving I have made these delicious sweet potatoes, tonight many people raved about it. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe. It's wonderful as is but I added orange zest, light sea salt, cut back the vanilla extract a bit and replaced it with a light splash of orange juice and VSOP Remy. Increased bake time to set  15 minutes more. Thank you again.

Fantastic rich sweet potato recipe for a special occasion. We always have it on our Thanksgiving table and everyone loves it. I have been asked for the recipe for this on many occasions.

PERFECTION!  I made this for Thanksgiving and Christmas this year.  I was never big on sweet potatoes, but I tried this recipe for the sake of my family.  I was glad I did, now it is a favorite of my own!  In fact, we were eating the leftover portions for breakfast this morning!  I used eggnog in place of the cream which was great, and used pure cane sugar instead of white sugar.  I have also prepared it using left over candied yams.  This will be a regular in my house!  Thanks so much!

I had an early Thanksgiving dinner this year and used this recipe.  Everyone loved it, including my boyfriend who is usually not a fan of sweet potatoes.  It is also my opinion that it looks more elegant than the sweet potato recipes that require a marshmallow topping.  I would not change a thing about this recipe.

This was a hit. I reduced the white sugar by 1/2, but quite frankly, I could have eliminated it all together. I left out the vanilla too. We had so many compliments on this dish. Will definitely make it again.

I have never liked sweet potatoes.  These are awesome!  I eat a bigger helping of this than anything else at Thanksgiving.  People who like sweet potatoes will swoon after tasting it, but I still can't convince the kids to try it.  Another new holiday tradition from Allrecipes.com!

I love sweet potatoes, and this was a good recipe, but I thought it had waaaay too much butter- there were pools of butter after I scooped out servings. I will make again with less butter and probably one less egg.

I made this for Thanksgiving with rave reviews so I did it again for Christmas. Then we had a welcome home party for my daughter who had been gone over the holidays. The most-asked question was, "Are you going to make those yummy sweet potatoes again?!" DEFINITELY a favorite. Some thought it should be dessert. It is so rich and sweet that I'd say the 6 servings stretches to 10-12! Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this every year for Thanksgiving for several years, and it's always a huge hit. In the past, I always followed it to the letter. This year, I forgot to buy heavy cream, but happened to have half and half on hand. I made the substitution and nobody noticed. I have decided to keep that change to save the calories and fat a little bit.

Wow! My sister, who hates sweet potatoes, took leftovers home! We had some visitors from Mexico rave over them too. Luckily I made extra for a party I was attending the next day or we wouldn't have had enough for dinner and leftovers!! (I had to make another dish for the party!) Thank you for this recipe.

This is a hit every year at our holiday dinner. I follow the recipe exactly and it turns out great everytime. It's nice because I can make the sweet potato mixture the night before then I just sprinkle on the topping before I bake it. Good and easy!!

I tried to lighten this one up by using light cream, a margerine/butter blend, only 2 eggs, 1 TBS vanilla, no white sugar and just 1/4 cup of brown sugar. So I changed it considerably, but it came out great!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone was ranting and raving about it! The vanilla makes it taste like ice cream, yet it's still not as sweet as traditional candied sweet potatoes. Absolutely delicious!

This has become a staple for our Thanksgiving dinners.  If I didn't make them I'm sure my family would riot.  They are so easy to make and I've even made them the night before so that I can focus on other dishes the day of Thanksgiving.

This recipe has become a Thanksgiving staple for my family!!!  I have prepared Praline Sweet Potatoes for 4 years (or so) now, and family members look forward to it.  It is a little like having dessert before "dessert time," which is fun!  The flavors are wonderful, and the dish is impressive (but do-able for this non-cook).  I use real sweet potatoes (not yams), which I believe this adds a delicate, elegant quality.  If you have a sweet tooth, you will love this dish!!!

Been using this recipe for almost 10 yrs. It has indeed become a "tradition". ONE IMPORTANT TIP:!!..... Use a food processor to make the smoothest, silkiest, yum-yum sweet potatoes you will ever ever eat!.... I started once using my stand mixer with the whisk attachment, but it just didn't make it smoooooooth enough. I ended up putting it into the processor. What a difference!!....

I have been making this recipe for years and my hubby (the world's pickiest eater) requests that I make this several times through the year! The only difference is I use 2 eggs instead of the 4.  We are also now a gluten free family (Celiac's) and this adapts well using gluten free flour.  If you try this be prepared for everyone wanting the recipe!!!!

If I could give this 10 stars, I would. This is my favorite sweet potato recipe I've ever tried!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it wasn't quite done at 30 minutes, so I cranked the heat up on the oven and gave it 5 or so minutes at 450 to crisp up the topping. My fiance who will "eat everything......except sweet potatoes" said this was amazingly delicious and had a HUGE helping after trying mine. I can't give it higher praise than that! I served this as a side dish to some deep fried catfish filets for an awesome Southern-style meal.

This is simply too good for words- I used dairy mashed sweet potatos, and only half of the sugar called for. The topping required a lot more flour than called for, but maybe I did something wrong? Will make often.

Super! The hit of any holiday meal. My son who just left home wasn't going to come for dinner on Christmas unless I made these! First thing out of his mouth was...where's the sweet potatoes? A delicious dish, turned out wonderfully.

This recipe was the disappointment of my Christmas meal. I actually double checked the recipe after trying it to make sure I had made it correctly. Not one of my guests was impressed either. The praline crust was good, but the actual potatoe mixture itself was tasteless and flat. I expected a melt in your mouth, sweet-sweet potatoe mixture...instead it was bland, far too souffle-like for my liking, and not at all attractive. I will definitely not make this dish again and find a simple combination of sweet potatoes, butter and brown sugar to be not only much easier, but far tastier than this dish.

OMG!!!!  I could so easily live on this stuff it totally rocks and it is sooo easy to make!  Is it legal for food this good to be so easy? 

The sweetpotato part has a flavor that makes one think of custard and light delicate texture that is totally decptive in that this dish is deliciously rich. 

My mom does not care for sweet potato casseroles because of the sweet topping.  But I think this would taste great with just say the nuts on top.  The sweet potato part is just that good.    

And for convenience the potatos can be boiled and mashed way in advance and kept in the fridge or freezer and the same goes for the topping.  So then the day you need it you can quickly whip up the sweetpotato custard and add your topping.  Easy Breezy on the day of serving.

I also found that using the conversion feature on this site worked successfully in allowing me to make a much smaller portion (2 servings) which is important as I knew I would be the only one eating them at our small family gathering.

I think I might start keeping the fixings for this in my fridge so that I can make it as a treat for myself.

I wasn't really impressed.  I used baked sweet potatoes.  Maybe if I had used canned it would have come out a little sweeter, because of the syrup they are canned in.  What was the point of the eggs???  The sweet potatoes weren't sweet enough to me and the topping was a bit too much.  But maybe I am just used to the marshmellow topped sweet potatoes.  I was thinking maybe next time I would use canned swwet potatoes and leave them whole and add the topping to them.  I won't be giving up on them.  Thanks anyhow for a change of pace.

My mother-in-law gave me this recipe several years ago and it is a family favorite.  However, over the years we made a few changes that I think put it over the top...  We add to the potato mixture, cinnamon and rum.  The rum is what really makes it rich.  I also mix all of the dry topping together, spread it on top of the potatoes and then drizzle with melted butter.  Seems easier to me.  This dish is also great because I can prepare it the day before and then bake it the day I need it.

This recipe was a huge hit! I made it for Thanksgiving and it got gobbled up. (no punn intended!) The only change I had to make was I cut WAY down on the vanilla. I felt it was overpowering. I would add only 1 tsp. I did that the second time I made it and it was perfect! Thanks for such a great recipe. It gets eaten by all, even people who dont like sweet potatoes!

I have made these a few times and they are great! Last time I cheated with canned sweet potato - drained and used half & half instead of heavy cream and they still were perfect. Everyone loves them.

Wonderful! I would definately cut down the vanilla to 1 T though, very overpowering with 2. Cut down to 3 eggs and a little less cream for a firmer texture. Topping was incredible! YUM!

I've been making this every Thanksgiving for 4 years.  I cut back on the vanilla to 1 T,  I thought it tasted too much like alcohol with the original amount.  I bake mine longer, until the center is almost set, it tastes soo much better.  Otherwise it was too runny and didn't hold it's shape.

EXCELLENT! We wanted a change for the holidays instead of the usual Candied Yams...well we now have a keeper. Only thing I would do next time, is to make sure I put it in a 9x13 pan so the sweet potato to topping ratio is better. We were out of heavy cream and used evaporated milk and it was still awesome!

Fantastic!  My family loved this recipe.  It's high in fat, so I don't plan to serve it often but it will be a staple for holiday dinners.  I bought canned sweet potatoes, drained them and mashed them to save time.

Thought I would get out of making these this year, but SOMEONE requested them.  Not that I don't want to eat them all up or anything!!  These are memorable, delicious, and set off the Thanksgiving feast so well.  DO NOT use the picture as a guide, they are just beautiful and beyond delicious!!  Nom nom nom as my daughter says.  If they lasted long enough I would take a picture and post it - but who wants a picture of an empty, scraped clean dish??

This is very rich. I served for Thanksgiving. It is delicious but next time I will cut the topping in half as it is quite thick and takes away from the sweet potatoes as the main ingredient.

Huge hit this thanksgiving. Next time I will use real sweet potatoes instead of canned and I'll cut back on vanilla, 2 Tbs is a little too much. Also a little less white sugar, but overall very tasty.

We have a family recipe for praline sweet potatoes that we have served all my life. I did Thanksgiving out of town this year and didn't think to bring my recipes so I was scrambling for this one. I was so happy with how it turned out. Everyone thought it was the best ever, little do they know it wasn't the old family recipe!

I have never liked sweet potatoes until now! I originally made this dish for my husband and now I make it for the both of us every year for the holidays.  This is the only way I will eat sweet potatoes.  The praline topping makes this dish special as well as the heavy whipping cream.
Update:  This is a sweet dish, but oh so good!  I have been making this recipe for 7+ years now.  It is served at every Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner.  I actually enjoy sweet potatoes now, but only as fries or Praline sweet potatoes.  I do not like sweet potatoes boiled as I think they become watered down and taste soggy.  Most people just add marshmallows or brown sugar and call it done.  The key is heavy whipping cream and the Praline topping.  My folks who never eat sweet potatoes, hence why I never ate them until I met my husband, liked this dish.  I sometime make extra topping and put it on my pumpkin pie.  Also, when I make my praline topping I do a little extra.  I find I do not have enough and that is because I use a shallow baking dish, so the surface area on top is much larger.

I took this to Christmas dinner at the in-laws and it was very good.  Not great, but worth making.  I did add ground ginger, nutmeg, and cinnamon to the potatoes when I creamed them.  I think that really helped it a lot!  I also took the advice of others and 1 1/2 times the topping, but it did not need that much.  The recipe is fine as written.  Thanks for the recipe, Mike.  I will make again.

This recipe is fantastic. I loved it, and I don't really like sweet poatoes. My only piece of advice is to make sure that if you cut the recipe in half, as I did the last time I made it, that you use a deep enough baking dish or the potatoes will dry out too much and not be as creamy.

This recipe was so good! At first it seemed a little too liquidy, but it baked perfectly!! A couple of my family members thought it was a little too sweet. Maybe lessen the brown sugar a little?

Whenever we attend a holiday buffet, this is my traditional sweet potato offering.  There is always one sweet-potato hater in the group, and invariably this is the person who raves about the "casserole."  It is rich, but the butter, eggs, and whipping cream change the texture of the potatoes.  It becomes more appealing to people who insist they don't eat sweet potatoes.  I never have left-overs.

Absolutely amazing!  These sweet potatoes were a hit at my Thanksgiving dinner!  I did not add the sugar to the potatoes themselves...I wanted the natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes to shine through, and it did wonderfully.  Several of my Thanksgiving recipes called for pecans, but I could not afford them (they are rather pricey here!) so I used toasted chopped walnuts instead.  Couldn't tell the difference!  These potatoes have a wonderful smooth texture and the crunchy topping is incredible.  Definitely a keeper...my husband insists that I make this dish a Thanksgiving tradition from now on!  Highly recommend!

The four stars are mainly for the topping because that was excellent but otherwise the flavor was a little lacking and I had to add a little cinnamon, nutmeg and ground cloves to make it taste better.

This recipe has become a classic and favorite around here. Just a few updates after yrs. of making it. First, white sugar is un-necessary... plenty on the topping. Also, I tried splitting the recipe into two graham crusts to use as pies for a bake sale and they were taken quickly. I have found this is at least a 45 min-1hr. bake.   If you have a mix master, it helps get it mixed very well. I also toss in pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon or whatever I feel like. Make sure to use rectangle dish b/c the topping is plentiful!  Get some on your plate b/c it won't last for leftovers!!!!
(If using fresh, use 4 potatoes)

Three teenagers wanted to make a sweet potato recipe for Thanksgiving, so I found this one and gave it to them. They worked very hard making it and were very proud of themselves. Unfortunately, noone cared for it. I checked the recipe again and think I found the problem. It calls for 2 tablespoons of vanilla, I think that is incorrect. Thank you.

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving.  Even folks who normally don't eat sweet potatoes were bragging on it.  The only thing I did differently was I used six cups of mashed sweet potatoes and left all the other measurements the same for a four-cup recipe.  Most excellent!

I didn't like the way all the butter lays on the top.  It's greasy.  The topping didn't get crunchy like I thought it would and the flavor was not great.  There are WAY better sweet potato recipes that are similar to this where some butter is added into the sweet potatoes and the topping is more tasty.  This one does not do it for me.

The sweet potatoes were great, my family loved them.  I will make this recipe again, but next time I will use less pecans, the think the recipe calls for a little too much.

We used chopped sweet potatoes instead of mashed and they still were great...also they are really good with coconut mixed in with the other toppings.

This was really delicious, but it serves way more than 6 unless this is all that you are serving.  I used canned yams, drained and then mashed them in the can with my immersion mixer.  A very nice change of pace, everyone was happy not to see marshmallows mixed in with the yams or sweet potatoes.  Thank you.

I was nervous about making this recipe because I have previously made excellent mashed sweet potatoes.  I'M SO GLAD I DID!  The recipe is wonderul and received many accolades.  I did cut out the white sugar for it seemed as if the brown sugar would provide enough sweetness and added 8 oz. additional butter for an additionally buttery taste.  I also added cinnamon to taste, about 2 tsp.  However, the recipe stands on it's own as being EXCELLENT!  Thank you for providing it!

This was such a good recipe!  Everybody was raving!  I did make a couple changes though.  I didn't do the topping and used the old marshmallow standard. I also substituted eggnog for the cream and left out one egg.  YUMMY!!!  I doubled the recipe and had a ton of leftovers which I used to make milkshakes (leftover sweet potatoes, vanilla ice cream, a bit of milk, and blend), and my family couldn't get enough of those as well!!!

TO DIE FOR!!!!! And I don't like sweet potatoes! I made these for Thanksgiving and now have a double batch in the oven for Christmas tomorrow. I added some bourbon to the brown sugar mixture and it gave it a little extra ooomph. Try this try this try this! It's soooo yummy! Worth every single calorie!!!

Absolutely wonderful, I thought my family would balk at the change from our traditional, but everyone went nuts over this!  I did make some changes.  I cut down the butter to half, I cut down the sugar by one third, I substituted evaporated milk for the cream and cut back by about half, and I topped the whole thing with marshmallows instead of the praline. A total hit with everyone!

This was a huge hit at my office party.  I used canned sweet potatoes which worked just as well and I also added 2 cups of mini marshmellows after baking and baked for an additional 10 minutes.  Perfection!  There were no leftovers and someone even commented that this tasted just like their grandmother's recipe!  Just the right amount of ingredients.  I wouldn't change a thing!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe Mike!

After reading previous reviews I revised recipe to my families liking.  Everyone loved it even my 10mth old son.  Recipe makes a huge amount.  My recommendation is to divide into 2 dishes and freeze one for later.  
I usually prefer the sweet potatoes that are made with pineapple but this one was great.  Thank you!

My husband just loves his mother's sweet potato recipe (the kind that has marshmallows in it)--  every Thanksgiving he looks forward to it.  I made this recipe last Thanksgiving & I gave his mom a run for her money.  He says he has a new favorite--maybe he was just being sweet, but I even had my "veggie hating" nephews eating it-so I think it must have been pretty good.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I found this recipe in the "Tried and True" Cookbook and I 1st thought the butter amt of 1/4 POUND was a typo. I thought they meant 1/4 cup, but I made it as directed and there was so much butter when this was done that the sweet potato part seemed to be swimming in grease. I then found the recipe on the website and it still said 1/4 lb. That is WAY too much butter for this recipe and it wasn't even very good. I will not make this again. Be careful if you are on a low-fat diet.

This is UNBELIEVABLE!  It is Thanksgiving Day, and the Praline Sweet Potatoes just went under the gruling taste test of 10 family members.  They raved and raved.  I just got back on here to print the recipe for everyone.  Very easy to create, and no one would know!  I will definitely repeat this creation!

will make again and again. Made it tonight using my own sweet potatoes I had baked and stored in foil in the freezer.  You just pull 6 out, thaw and mash and continue the recipe.  Had a potluck and a total wipeout of nothing left, everyone raved about it. The pecans make it awesome!

I researched the many various recipes and reviews for this sweet potato dish, and read all the reviews here before making this last night. All the previous times I tried to make it, it never came out. It did this time! I used 2- 29oz cans of yams (drained & dried) that made exactly 4 cups mashed. Big time saver to use canned. Recipe states to use 2 quart casserole but I think it would go better in a 9x13 but you'd have to double the topping. The only changes I made was I used 3 eggs, 1 1/2 teaspoons very good vanilla, 1/2 cup white sugar AND 1/2 cup light brown sugar for the base, also evaporated milk. I wanted mine to be more like dessert. Most recipes call for 1 cup of white sugar & only 3 cups mashed potato's. I did bake it for 60 minutes but 45 would have been better. This is very delicious- hot or cold. I will try to make it again with Splenda.

This was the 2nd year I made this recipe.  This year I followed another reviewer and put all of my ingredients in my mixer and mixed everything until smooth.  I baked 4 pounds of sweet potatoes which equaled 4 cups.  I also added cinnamon, nutmeg and a little more brown sugar (couple of teaspoons-to taste).  Last year, I was told that it was okay-it could have been sweeter but that was my fault because I totally screwed the topping up.  However, this year I made it again and EVERYONE loved it.  The topping was delicious, the potatoes were so smooth and creamy.  I will probably cut back on the butter (maybe 3/4 stick of butter-rather than an entire stick) for the topping but besides that it was soooooo yummy.  Thank you for sharing this yummy recipe!

I am not a fan of sweet potatoes but my mom requested a sweet potato dessert for Thanksgiving one year.  I made this and my parents loved it!  Since then, it is requested by them every Thanksgiving.  It does taste good!

Using other people's suggestions, this is what I change: Omit 1/2 c. of white sugar. Use 1 Tablespoon of vanilla, 3 extra large eggs and add more butter, 3 tsp of cinnamon, and maybe about 2 tsp of nutmeg. Bring butter up to room temp & cube it.  Mix with the other topping ingredients until the butter was well blended, there should be no loose flour or sugar.  You MUST leave it in until the topping is crisp on the edges and firm in the middle.  I like doubling the praline top recipe.

A huge hit every year at Thanksgiving! As with all other recipes on this site, I modify them for size as well as add my own personal touches.  

For starters, I add 2 tsp Cinnamon as well replacing the White Sugar with Agave Syrup.  Leaving some of the potatoes a bit chunky is also a favorite. 

Anyone who has every had an aversion to eating Sweet Potato Casserole does a 180 and ends up raving about this one!  It is one of the first items we end up running out of every year!

WARNING! Don't make this for your holiday table unless you are willing to make it EVERY year for the the REST of your LIFE! I've made this for at least ten years, it is such an enormous hit that now every TG and Xmas I am under strict orders to make this. I will add that every year there are fewer pies and sweets brought to the table because everyone fills up on this.

Terrific!  Never made sweet potatoes before and it was amazing.  I used 3 eggs, 1 Tbs of vanilla and added just a touch of spice.  The family really enjoyed it.

This was amazing!! The only thing I changed was cut the white sugar from 1/2 a cup to 1/4 and only put in 1 TBSP of vanilla. Leave it all as is, it is delicious and was a hit at our Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone wanted the recipe.

This is a yummy recipe but it definitely needs tweeking starting with half as much sugar. And the vanilla measurement is definately off. Who ever heard of 2 T of vanilla in anything?! I think there's a typo in the recipe and it's supposed to be 2 t not 2 T. 1 or 2 less eggs would probably make it better. I didn't make it that way but I didn't like the egginess and I noticed that some of the other feedback talked about this. I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg for more flavor. All in all, it's a crowd pleaser. Don't be afraid to adjust it to your liking.

My future mother-in-law raved about this.  I will next time make the sweet potato part less sweet.  The topping is a sugar rush all by itself.

I added about a capful of orange extract and approximately 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice.  It came out really well, plus it upped the flavor a notch without adding sweetness!

We LOVE this recipe, but I have to cook it much longer stated to get it completely cooked. I've made it several times and we are always waiting for it to come out of the oven before we can eat - once we had it the next meal because it was so undercooked. I will continue to make this because the taste is so good!

The BEST sweet potatoes ever! I use Mexican Vanilla instead of traditional extract & everyone thinks there's marshmallows in it! This dish is requested at holiday dinners, even if I'm not going to be there. It has turned into more of a dump recipe for me, but all the ingredients are the same. It's great without the topping too, for those who don't care for nuts.

This base recipe is so good- but I put marshmallows on top of mine instead of the pralines. I've done it both ways, and the year I did it without marshmallows and used pralines, I missed the marshmallows. Both ways are good though.

Great recipe!  I used 2 large cans of sweet potatoes.  That didn't quite make 4 cups so I added some frozen roasted sweet potatoes with maple glaze.  Mashed up with the eggs and added a tsp of cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  I also used 1 TBSP of vanilla and 1 TBSP of maple syrup.  I thought the amount of toppings was perfect, but I put it in the oven for 60 minutes.  My family loved this...even my son who "hates" sweet potatoes.

I have been making this dish for the last 3 years for every Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner we go to.  It's especially easy when you put it in the crockpot, put a woodspoon in the lid so the liquid escapes and viola!!  I have found however that when I do bake it in the oven it takes considerably longer than 30 minutes to bake.

I made this for Thanksgiving and have had to make it several times since.  This is the best sweet potato casserole recipe I've ever come across!  It's very sweet, but still retains the flavor of sweet potatos.  I used canned sweet potatos once and it was still just as yummy.  (I used canned sweet potatoes with NO syrup)  I also cooked it a bit longer because I used a smaller, deeper dish.

This is an excellent recipe though I had to make a few changes to cater to my families dietary restrictions. I added apple juice instead of cream and Splenda instead of the sugar. I also added a little sugar free maple syrup,  1 tsp cinnamon, .5 tsp nutmeg and .25 tsp clove. It gave it just the right spice. Very yummy!!

I made these for Thanksgiving.  Those who like sweet potatoes loved these...said they were the best they've had.  Personally, I've come to the conclusion that I really do not like them in the first place.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving.  I have a large family so I double the recipe with the following changes - did not double vanilla, added 2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg for more flavoring.  Used condensed milk instead of heavy cream. Also added a lot more flour to topping mixture.  Wanted it like apple pie crumb topping.  Everybody loved it and wanted the recipe.

i made this for thanksgiving and everyone loved it! my husband, who doesn't like yams/sweet potatoes, went back for seconds and thirds. i've made this twice, with fresh yams and canned yams. with the canned yams i drained the liquid and cut the sugar in half. both times i added marshmallows. i put the regular sized marshmallows on top (evenly spaced) about 10 minutes before i have to take the yams out of the oven. the marshmallows puffed up and browned nicely, which makes for a pretty presentation.

I made this for Thanksgiving. I thought it was a nice change from the traditional candied yams. My husband did not like it as well as what we've had before. This recipe made quite a bit. If I make it again, I would scale it down.

These were a nice change of pace for Thanksgiving sweet potatoes.  I liked the taste of the sweet potatoes a lot more than the topping, but I'm not a big fan of pecans.  The servings per recipe are off though.  I will make these again.

This dish is maybe a little too sweet, even for a person like myself who's a sugar addict!  I thought there was too much of the topping and not enough of a sweet potato taste.  It tastes almost like a custard, with too much of an "eggy" taste for my liking.  I made it for a Thanksgiving side dish, and it only received a lukewarm reception from my guests as well.  I don't think I would make this again.  FYI, I think the serving size is way off on this.  This recipe is enough for probably more like 12 servings.

Yummy!  Huge hit for Thanksgiving.  I used one large can (40 oz) and one small can (15 oz) of Bruce's Yams, and it was just shy of four cups.

I beat the eggs and cream together before adding the other ingredients.

I reduced the vanilla to between 2 tsp and 1 tbsp, and it was just right (I made this once before as written, and they had a bitter flavor from the vanilla).

I put most of the potatoes in an 11x7 dish, and the rest in a 10 oz Pyrex (otherwise, the 11x7 would have spilled over in the oven.

These were delish!

I found this recipe here 2 years ago and have been making it for every Thanksgiving and Christmas since.  Everybody loves it.  I had to come back and look it up again because I think I had given away the one I printed.  This is the only one to make!  I don't change a thing.

the "sweet potato" part was a little bland to me, but the sweetness of the topping overrode it; the combination was delicious.  i had 3 people ask me for the recipe.

I was not expecting my dish to be the hit at Thanksgiving last night. I got so many compliments on these. It is very sweet so many ate it in place of dessert. I used half the nuts because they are so expensive right now and it was still great!

So yummie. It seems more like dessert than a vegetable dish. The first time I made it I didn't read the recipe correctly and combined the topping into the sweet potatoes......It was great like that, too.

I think the recipe is really good,I love sweet things,but I found this recipe too sweet especially if you serve this dish with another sweet dish like glazed ham which I did,so just watch what you serve with it with because it's very,very sweet. theese potatoes are really great with less white/brown sugar,only in my opinion though.

Whenever I am invited to cook for an event they insist on me bringing this one! I leave the potatoes a bit lumpy and add some crushed pecans to the mix as well as the topping. Delicious.

My husband hated the idea of sweet potatoes before serving him this!  It's a very easy recipe and easy to alter with success.  I've omitted nuts and the crust was still wonderful.  I always add cinnamon to the potatoes.  Sometimes I skip the heavy cream and use milk instead.  I've also cut out an egg.  Always wonderful.  All of my dinner guests asked for the recipe.

I've tried this and another recipe like it and either I'm just not getting it right or it doesn't appeal to me very much.  It's good enough, but I am a very picky sweet potato critic!  I might have to fiddle with the recipe to get it the way I like it.  I didn't like the texture of the potatoes - would like the potatoes to stay firmer and not turn into mush like they do everytime, and the topping was good, but the potato mixture needs something.  Over all, I liked it, but it's not my favorite.

These really are the best sweet potatoes I have ever eaten.  My husband doesn't love sweet potatoes, but he had 3 servings of these and then ate them for breakfast the next day!!!  The only change I would make is to make them with 3 eggs instead of 4.  The consistency seemed a little more like pudding than sweet potatoes.

Absolutely fantastic.  Sinfully delicious.  Rich!  A perfect accompaniment to a turkey or ham dinner. Leftovers are wonderful as a dessert with whipped cream on top.  Yummm....I'm going to go steal a bite right now....

This was the best sweet potato recipe that I have ever made.  I used it on Thanksgiving but made a big mistake.  I really do not like to prepare large meals and I was feeling very stressed.  So much that I combined ALL the ingredients together except of the pecans.  I didn't notice until the end that I had nothing to mix the pecans with.  Sooooooo, I just sprinkled the pecans on the top, pressed them in and baked the dish as instructed.  It was fabulous.  Thank you Mike for a recipe that after I made such a hugh mistake that it still didn't ruin our Thanksgiving.  My family thought I was just creative. (smile)

This is SOOOO Delicious - and even better the next day!  For those having trouble getting the topping "crumbly", try cutting the butter in with a fork or cutting it into small pieces before adding it to the rest of the mix. The only other comment that I have is that it's more like 16 servings instead of 6 - makes quite a lot. A MUST try!

Great recipe but it needs a little salt in the sweet potato mixture.  I usually make the sweet potato mixture  the day before and then sprinkle the topping on and bake the next day (1 less thing to do on thanksgiving!)

I used canned sweet potatoes, reduced the eggs to two (all I had) and also reduced the heavycream to 1/2 cup. I have used the recipe for years and my family always expects it at our Thanksgiving table. My brother said it was possibly the best thing he has ever eaten in his life.

I had a heck of a time getting the topping to come out.  After my 3rd try, I gave up and just ended up putting marshmallows on top.  I am not a sweet potatoe fan, but my family all said it was pretty good.

These came out great (although I had to figure out for myself to let them cook long enough to set).  My crumbly topping didn't come out that way.  It all clumped together as the butter softened.  Next time I'm cutting way down on the butter, but it came out fine just the same.  I'll probably use it as a dessert next time, as well.

Awesome recipe! I have made this dish atleast a half dozen times for the holidays. Rave reviews!
I have also left off the topping before, for a less sweet dish- very good too! Also very good topped off with real whip cream for dessert.

Yuck!!! Way too sweet and the vanilla tastes very strange in this. Next time I will just add some butter and a small amount of maple syrup to the sweet potatoes--no white sugar!j The topping was good

My mother bought the Allrecipes Cookbook and this was the first recipe she made from it.  Absolutely delicious.  She didn't have the heavy cream, so instead, she substituted cinnamon flavored coffee creamer and left out the sugar.  Sounds strange, but they turned out really good.  She and I devoured it.  Thanks Mom and Mike.

This recipe is wonderful. I've made this several times for family gatherings and each time there is almost none left. Even those who claim to hate sweet potatoes devour it. It's more like a dessert than a side dish but I've never heard any complaints.

This is the best, I didn't use the topping I used marshmallows, but it's very rich and delicious.  I didn't use sugar I used Splenda and some Stevia to sweeten... made no difference. Made this for Christmas and everybody loved it.  Even my boyfriend who doesn't like sweets loved this. Before trying this my brother said " You're gonna make sweet potatos?! Disgusting! I don't want any" but after he tried them and it's now one of his favorites.

We ate this fresh out of the oven, and I thought it was kind of runny.  Next time I'll see if waiting a few minutes gives it time to thicken.  Also, I thought 2 tablespoons vanilla was too much, and I like vanilla! Was it supposed to be 2 teaspoons?  Definitely reduce vanilla amount.

I found this recipe four years ago and I have made it for every family gathering since. Everyone insists on it. I've tried several variations, LOL, and it doesn't seem to matter. It still disappears to the last drop. I've used almonds,and once walnuts. I've used canned pumpkin pie mix in a pinch. It turns out very good no matter what variations I use and everyone raves about it. I've never had a problem with the topping at all. It always turns out just right. I have however cut down on the liquids added to the potato mix. I make 20-30 servings at a time for the family gatherings. A huge roaster full disappears like magic.

Brought to Christmas dinner and got rave reviews. I cooked it in a high-sided round 2qt, but think I will switch to a 13x9 next time...the center was pretty runny (but delicious!) I added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to the potato mixture.

This recipe has been mine for several years (varied slightly -- I used drained canned yams)!  This is a family and work pot-luck favorite and I ALWAYS have dozens of requests for my recipe -- every single year!  My daughter even makes it throughout the year -- not just during the holidays.  If you don't like yams.... just try this!  I promise you'll LOVE it.

I made two versions of this for Thanksgiving: one with nuts and one omitting nuts but adding marshmallows at the end of cooking time and placing under the grill to brown.They were both absolutely wonderful - my husband said the nutty one was the taste treat of his life, and the kids loved the marshmallow dish.  The only downside was that they were a little mushy.  Next time I will add a little less liquid.  Thanks for sharing this one - it is our new holiday tradition!  Kay far from home in London

I really loved this recipe.  Most of my guest didn't think that it was sweet enough...phooey on them
because my husband and I loved it.  I did add more butter to the topping so that when
it baked, the topping would fuse together more like a praline.

A true keeper.  Yes, the topping is "dessert-like", but the filling is less sweet than many other sweet potato casseroles I've made.  The sweetness balance between the topping and filling is perfect, and makes for my "new" favorite yam bake!  P.S.---I nuked the yams, and in a matter of minutes, I was able to mash them, and assemble the recipe.
Cheers,
Jeff

I was assigned the sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving. I am addicted to praline topping so I came searching and found this treasure. This is the very best sweet potato recipe I've ever had! I made two of 'em...one for hubby's work and one for our family, and they got rave reviews both times. They are mouthwatering!

Added this to our Thanksgiving menu and it is a keeper.  I used fresh mashed sweet potatoes and prepared all but the topping the night before.  Although I allowed extra baking time, center was a little runny.  Not sure if that was due to early preparation or watery potatoes to begin with.  Will adjust a little next time and will definitely put them in a low-sided casserole rather than a high one.

I just made these to try them out before Thanksgiving to see if the were good, and they were the best sweet potatoes I've ever had!  If you make these, they will be the talk of your whole Thanksgiving dinner!  They're delicious!!!!

This is a great recipe! I changed a few things though! I did not have cream by accident this thanksgiving, so used eggnog instead and thought it turned out extra delicious! I used a full two cups, but you could probably add less. Also, as one reviewer stated, the amount of flour for the crumbled topping is off. I always end up adding probably twice the amount, til it’s as crumbly as I want it. I also add cinnamon and nutmeg to the potato mixture, to add even more flavor.

This recipe has become a Thanksgiving standard in our house. I've made it the last 3 years and my kids ask me to make it. I made it exactly as described, but I did only put 1 T of vanilla instead of 2  I am also a little heavy handed on the pecans because they are so good. I made it in my crockpot the last 2 years to save oven space and it turned out just as good.

This is probably one of the most underrated easiest recipes I have ever made. 
This is the 8th or 9th year my co-workers have asked me to make this dish for our Thanksgiving luncheon.  I do minor changes - less white sugar, use brown sugar, Nutmeg, etc.  but the results are the same.  
This year, my younger sister and her family are hosting Thanksgiving. I am a pretty great cook. What is my sister asking that I bring? 
Last year, I hosted Thanksgiving for 16 people. She wants me to make a dessert (Homemade German Chocolate cake), and...Praline Sweet Potatoes.  
I am thankful everyone loves it. My suggestion is to watch the sugar on the recipe...you might want to useless. We never have leftovers.

This was very tasty, but too sweet.  I'll make it again but with maybe 1/2 the sugars.  It's good for those traditional sweet potato people;)

Really good.  I used a square casserole dish so the cooking time was more like an hour until the topping was totally cooked.  Didn't have enough heavy cream so used partly milk and it still turned out great.

I live in Africa and use local yams. This recipe is very forgiving and tastes amazing. I sub evaporated milk for heavy cream. The one thing I don't skimp on is the topping -- it definitely makes the dish & is the perfect ratio as written. Absolutely delicious.

I HATE sweet potatoes and so does my husband.  This recipe is the BOMB!!  We loved it.  You can't even tell they are sweet potatoes!  My new fave.  I just will use 1/4 cup or less of real maple syrup instead of the white sugar. I also used 2 tsp. of cinnamon.

This is a great recipe!! I like to whip my potatoes a little long so they are thick & fluffy. Sometimes I add coconut flakes to the topping. Either way it is loved by everyone.

I made this dish for our Thanksgiving  dinner and we ready enjoyed it! I followed the suggestion to cut the sugar and decrease the amount of vanilla from the sweet potato portion, which was perfect and allowed us to enjoy the naturally sweet flavor of the potatoes.  Also made that portion ahead the day before, so it was quite easy to finish up on the busy day of our dinner celebration.  The praline top was just the right amount of sweet!

Been making this for holiday dinners now for years and still a big hit. This was the first year I used canned sweet potatoes instead of boiling and mashing my own. Got just as many compliments and requests for the recipe.

Everyone loved this but halved the sugar as it was a bit too sweet the first time I made it.  Made it a second time with less sugar and it was even better.

Not what I hoped for.  I made it exactly as written and had to cook it about 10 min extra to get it done.  It was a little dry for my tastes.  Could probably work on it and make it more creamy and moist.  Flavor was good though.

This is a great recipe. I usually don't follow recipes but ran across this one and gave it a shot. I tweeked it alittle bit and it came out fantastic. Instead of 4 eggs I used 3. Brown sugar instead of white...not packed. 2 Tbsp Honey. 2 Tbsp melted butter. A pinch or two of cayenne. And for the struesel topping I decided that alittle crumbled bacon would make a nice addition to all the sweetness and the added heat. I'm sure the original recipe is just as good....but try this out for alittle change!

I made this recipe and it was heavenly!!! But being in french culinary school I knew I might be able to make this a little more flavorful! So I used fresh baked sweet potatoes, and since they can be stringy I put about  3/4 of this mixture into the blender, this made the texture incredible creamy!  Also another amazing thing to do is cream together the sugar and egg yolks, until ribbons form that melt back into the mixture, this is how . Also To make this especially fluffy, add the egg whites to a electric mixer and mix just until stiff peaks form ( fold this into the sweet potato mixture very last and don't over mix it!) This dish NEEDS salt (to taste) to bring out the natural sweet flavor of the potatoes. Also for acid I added the juice from a quarter of a lemon, and a couple table spoons of Gran Mariner.!!!

Tasty!  
For measurements, Sherry so impressed me with her measurement of how much a potato provided. I hadn't bought all the same size potatoes (bought a 2 pound bag of organics), I put a couple in a 1 quart measuring pitcher, filled it with water to 1 quart and ensured I covered the potatoes, then poured it off into a 1 cup measuring cup until I'd measured how much water came out. The remainder was my volume of potatoes. I had about 4 1/4 cups.
I baked the potatoes for 1 1/2 hours (per Sherry again) and then scooped out the innards of the potatoes.  I wound up with 2 cups of delightfully tasty mashed potato and no losses due to boiling in water.  In summary, 2 pounds of sweet potatoes provided 2 cups of cooked, mashed sweet potatoes.

I also used all brown sugar instead of white - it adds more flavor.  And for those who are gluten free, you can crush up corn flakes to use in place of flour & you actually get a crunchier topping.  I added a little OJ concentrate to make it tangy - it just depends on the mood I'm in & what it will be a side dish of.  Great recipe from MKENNON.

I made this yesterday for our early family gathering.  Everyone LOVED it.  I used boiled fresh Yams (not canned), I added 4Tblsp. homemade Vanilla, Cinnamon and one other spice I cannot remember at the moment and doubled this recipe.  I will NEVER make my Sweet Potatoes any other way again!  Thank you!!!!!

This was very good.  I cut way back on the sugar, but make the praline topping as described and thought it worked well.

This turned out great. I did reduce the sugar in the potatoes as recommended by other reviewers. The only other change I did was to use slivered almonds instead of pecans (it's what I had on hand), but it was still wonderful! I am not a fan normally of sweet potato anything, but I really liked this!

Egads, just serve this for dessert!  I would cut wayyy back on the sugar, especially in the topping, next time, but otherwise tasty.  It did keep and reheat very well.

I used to make other kinds of sweet potatoes, but have only made this one the past few years because we love it so much. All that vanilla gives it a definite richness not found in other recipes. The best ever!

I have made this recipe for three years now and keep meaning to rate it and then neglect to do so. I HATE sweet potatoes, but will eat them every single day when they are made this way!!! This is an amazing recipe and I bring it with me to every Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner I go to...and I have yet (in three years and MANY potlucks) to have any leftovers. Actually, the lack of leftovers makes me very sad the next day. :)

Sweet potatoes were never a part of our Thanksgiving meal until I tried this recipe. It is now requested every year.It has a creamy texture with a delicious crunchy topping and is a perfect compliment to the holiday meal. If you have never cared to try sweet potatoes because of the typical marshmallow topping, try this one. It's to die for!

After reading everyones reviews I thought I am going to make a double batch. to take to my fathers house for dinner. What a waste of money that was. I was so embarrased as to how awful this recipe this was. I followed the directions to a T too. not a hit on my table that is for sure.

Phenomenal recipe.  Hands down, the best sweet potatoes I've ever had.  Soooo easy, and I always go home with an empty casserole dish.

This will be the third year I've made these sweet potatoes.  Every year my family demands that I bring them.  However, I felt the potatoes were a little lacking.  This year I added about some five spice powder and fresh ground nutmeg (just enough to add a little bit of flavor).  I think it gives the potatoes a little extra something.

I made so many changes I almost feel bad writing a review.  But it was the praline topping that got my attention.  It's just that my family likes sweet potatoes that aren't so rich 'n' sweet that they take over the meal. I cut in half the amount of sugar, vanilla and cream and reduced the egg by one. I even reduced the brown sugar by 1/4 c.  Okay, I added nutmeg, cinnamon and melted butter to the potatoes. And let me say it was delicious!!  Thanks to the "guidelines" of this recipe, I now have the PERFECT dish for my family. (I made the mistake of giving the tiny bit of leftovers to my sister-in-law.  Note to self: double this next time!)

This was an interesting dish.  The potatoes weren't very sweet, and weren't particularly good unless the topping was contained within the same bite.  I think that it would be a good idea to swirl the topping into the mix so the sweetness and flavors can mingle better.  Good recipe, though.

This recipe is amazing!  I found it the first year I was married and had to cook for my husband's family and they loved it!  I have a huge sweet tooth and this really hits the spot.  I don't know if the amount of sweet potatoes is really exact, as I have used anywhere between 4 and 6 cups and still ended up with a tasty dish.  This is the fourth year I will be making it and can't wait to get it out of the oven!

I've made this for over a decade, and just found the same recipe online...how funny...it is my all time favorite. You absolutely can't do better than this. And for all of those complaining about calories...this is a down home southern recipe...of course its high in fat and calories!

This recipe is almost the exact recipe that my mother-in-law makes every Thanksgiving...and it happens to be my favorite. The only problem that I had was the topping wasn't as crunchy as I would have liked it. I think it needed more flour because the topping was slightly runny. It was still delicious!
I even like it cold.

This dish was my favorite part of the Thanksgiving meal!  Super delicious.  I used a 2 qt round casserole and had left over topping so the sweet potatoes that didn't get ate on thanksgiving got baked with the additional topping the second day.  Worked out perfect!

My family has a very similar recipe to this with an orange zest, so we weren't blown away.  I was expecting something more unusual on top - something to really signify "praline" so that's why I didn't rate it a five.  It's still a great way to do sweet potatoes :)

These were a hit at our Thanksgiving feast.  I added a bit of cinnamon while blending.  Almost sinful enough to be dessert!

This is so good. I used fresh potatoes. Wash, boil, cool and peel. The only thing I did differently than the recipe was sprinkle a little cinnamon on top.  I could eat the entire pan myself! I took it to work for our Thanksgiving carry in. Three people asked the recipe, including my boss' wife. I also took it to my Dad's for dinner. He doesn't even like sweet potatoes! "He said that quit being sweet potatoes when you put the sweet stuff on top of it." LOL

I personally don't like sweet potatoes, but I got stuck making them one time and that was it. I have to make them for every family event. Everyone loves them even my pickest eater.

I find this recipe rather labor intensive so I only make it for special occassions.  It is usually the dish I am requested to bring for all holidays and get togethers.    Despite the amount of work to make this i am still giving it 5 stars because it is very worth the effort.  This is like sweet potatoe pie without the crust.  Yummy!

Having just returned from New Orleans, we were looking for a recipe with that great praline taste.  This one definitely is a keeper.  Went by the recipe except a little more on the sweet potatoes and would NOT change a thing.

The praline topping was really tasty.  I used yams instead of sweet potatoes.  The potatoes came out kind of runny.  I think I will not use as much cream and eggs next time.  The recipe was still very good though.

It was wonderful.  I think the next time I will use only 1 T vanilla.  It would easily serve 10 - 12.

Made this Thanksgiving and it was wonderful. My only complaint was that there was too much topping. I used only half the amount I made, but froze the extra.

This recipe is fantastic! I just pulled it out of the oven. Instead of heavy cream, I used whipping cream. As a shortcut, use canned sweet potatoes, and blend them with the ingredients before putting them into the casserole dish. I baked this covered, and then uncovered it 5 minutes before taking it out of the oven.

MMM!  It tasted wonderful.  I've never like yams and after this recipe, although it's ironic, I still don't like yams, but this recipe tasted good (only when I'm tasting).  I can't stand foods that are...mushy and have that texture and this unfortunately has that (as with oatmeal, blah blah).  However, this did taste wonderful and I can see how everyone raved about it.  The topping was to die for.  It was so good, we ate all the topping before the yams.  Anyhow, just as a recommendation, use a REALLY shallow dish and double the topping.  MMM MMM MMM

This was an amazing recipe. When people ask what it was and I told them sweet potatoes they all graciously just passed it by. Then I shamed my sister-in-law into trying some. She is a picky eater and was more than hesitant. After one bite she went back and got a big helping. Then she ask if she could take the left overs home! hehe!! But like others mentioned I cut back on vanilla and sugar.

I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving dinner this year & it was a big hit!  I scaled the recipe for 9 servings & made only one adjustment based on another review ... I used 1/3 C. white sugar & 1/3 C. brown sugar in the potatoe mixture.  It was sweet but not too sweet (which is the problem I have had with other people's sweet potatoe casserole dishes.)  I will be sure to make this again for the holidays!

This was very good.  I just don't give 5 stars unless it is totally out of this world.  I did only use 3 eggs with regular milk, didn't have cream, and added some quick cooking oats to the topping.  Thanks for the recipe!

So yummy!  Not sure whether to have it with the turkey or serve it with dessert - could have it either way.  Made as per recipe, but added 1 Tbs brandy to the potato.  Will make again.

I tried this recipe last Thanksgiving as I am the only one in my family who likes sweet potatoes. The company loved it and so did my husband and kids. I gave it to my dad and he is making for his dinner this year! Thanks for sharing!

This is always a hit when I make it.  For pot lucks, this is the dish that is scraped clean and results in many recipe inquiries.  I get requests to make it for my work pot luck every year.  It's easy, delicious and I don't change a thing on the reipe.

The BEST sweet potatoes ever!  I served it at a dinner party and even those who didn't like sweet potatoes loved it.  Some ate it with dinner and then again for dessert.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

Ok, I tried my best to mess this one up but I just couldn't.  Even though I only added 4 cups of sweet potatoes not mashed it still came out great.  I normally would of just ran to the store to buy more but it was Christmas day so I had to make do.  The only thing I had to do was just bake it alittle longer than normal.

This recipe was too buttery for my taste.  It was overpowering.  I wasn't able to taste the other flavors as well as I would've liked to.  Next time I make it, I think I will leave out the cream and about 1/2 the butter.

A totally new experience. It doesn't even fall in the category of a side dish. It almost has a dessert quality with a light, fluffy taste.

I've made this for the last two Thanksgivings at our home. Everyone who eats this demands the recipe.  People even want to pass on Pumpkin Pie just to have more sweet potatoes!  I don't add all of the sugar to the sweet potatoes though, just because I think the topping is sweet.  But, they are great both ways.  It just depends on you.  Make it and you won't be dissapointed!

Not Sure what all the hype was about.  I thought this was ok.  The relatives thought it was good, no rave reviews.  I guess I have a sweet tooth, because I thought it needed a lot more brown sugar and butter.  Not sweet enough for my liking.  I didn't like the pecans either.

Very disappointed.  They turned out with no problem.  Very easy to make.  We had almost all left over at Thanksgiving.  Not even the sweet potato lovers were thrilled over this recipe.  I didn't think they were that sweet as I was expecting.  Flavor was okay.  Will not make again.

This was WONDERFUL the only problem was with the sweet flavoring we couldn't decide to put it on the dinner table or the desert table.  Either would work.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and I was very disapointed.  I followed the advice of someone else and cut the sugars in half.  I think I would have liked it much more had I used the amount of sugar that the recipe called for.  It just wasn't sweet enough for me.  Two of my dinner guests loved it, but the other three said it was so-so. I probably won't try this one again.

I admit that this is a very sweet dish.  But, it is good and my husband loved it.  It could easily be added to the dessert table I perosnally don't have a trouble eating a little dessert with my main course.  Yummy and sweet!  Thumbs up from us!

Great dessert but I would never serve this as a side dish. I think it would ruin the rest of the meal having something so sweet on the plate. I prepared everything but the topping the night before to save time, to the sweet potato mixture, I added 1 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice. In the crumble mixture I used only 1 cup of pecans and 1/3 cup of margarine. I put it in a 9x13 inch pan and baked it for 45 minutes instead of 30. It came out fantastic. My boyfriend ate it with whipped cream on the top. I preferred it cold the next day. It tasted just like pumpkin pie but with no crust and a sweet crunchy topping. Also the servings are HUGE. I cut these into squares and got 12. But it easily could have been 16.

My recommendation - and I know the purists out there will shudder - use canned sweet potatoes.  Will make it a lot faster to make this recipe.  Also, it says this will make 6 servings...I feel it makes about 8-10 as a side dish.  Especially if you don't have a lot of people who like sweet potatoes in your family.  The flavor was great, especially reheated the next day.  Great recipe!

Made this for Christmas and everyone loved it.  My husband too.  A nice change from the marshmallow version each year.  I also took someone's recommendation and cut the sugar in 1/2.  I don't think anyone noticed.  Eek. Just looked at the fat and calorie count!  But who counts during the holidays!

I have made this recipe several times since thanksgiving.  I belive this to be a keeper!  I use fresh baked sweet potatoes instead of canned, takes a bit longer to prepare but has turned out perfect each time.

This recipe was really great. My family ate the whole thing, and we usually just serve sweet potatoes for tradition more than anything. I already have several requests to make it again. I did add some cinnamon and allspice to the recipe, just to give it a bit more taste.

Fabulous!  Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner wanted this recipe.  It even converted my marshmallow addited husband!  I cut the sugar for the potatoes in half, and it was just right.  If I wanted to serve as a desert, I would probably use all the sugar called for.

I love this recipe. Instead of the walnut topping, I used mini marshmallows (the way Mom used to). This will be a tradition!

Excellent!  This recipe was a big hit at Thanksgiving.  I baked my sweet potatoes the night before and mashed them.  When they cooled I put them in the refridgerator.  The next day it was just a matter of adding the rest of the ingredients and making the praline topping.  I'll never go back to the marshmallow recipe I used to use.

This is an amazing recipe.  I made it for Thanksgiving this year.  I doubled the recipe since we were expecting an army.  Knowing that I had too much, I put it in two baking dishes.  I served one to my family and put the other in the freezer for Christmas.  Everyone loved this dish..now they will get it again at the next holiday!  Wonderful, quick and easy recipe.

I made this for our family for Thanksgiving.  Even the pickiest loved it!  Amazingly, there were NO leftovers!  Friends that stopped by were even told to 'try this - it's sooo good'!!  Highly recommended.  I added a little extra cream to make sure the potatoes stayed fluffy.

I was not pleased with this recipe. The topping was too sweet and there was too much of it! I didn't care for the texture of the sweet potatoes either - too creamy/fluffy and also too sweet.

I made these Wednesday for Thanksgiving.  I baked them in the oven the next morning, and everyone loved them!  It was so easy and light.  I'm not a lover of sweet potatoes, but I did love these.  The brown sugar and pecans on top really make the dish!

My mom has always made this recipe for thanksgiving as long as I can remember but I think the heavy cream really added alot.  I would maybe cut back on some of the vanilla, maybe next time only use half as much.

If you nuke the potatoes, it is a much faster recipe. My entire family thought this was delicious. Getting my kids to eat sweet potatoes is like pulling teeth, but not with this one. It's more like a dessert. I read the reviews and found that almost every one said how great this recipe was except the one from allrecipe! Maybe you messed up in the making of it, 48 other people can't all be wrong!

This recipe was wonderful. At family dinners I usually make a sweetpotatoe dish for my father-in-law and myself. But, when I made this recipe for the first time everyone at the table had some and I went home with an empty dish.

My father LOVED this recipe!  I suggest, however, that it is served as a desert rather than a side dish.  It is more like Sweet Potato Pie!

I made these sweet potatoes on New Year's Day
with Hopping John and baked ham.  They're absolutely delicious.  Mike is right -- they were the best sweet potatoes I've ever eaten.

This sweet potato treat was a huge hit at my large family Thanksgiving feast for 30.  The pan was scraped clean which was a bummer because I wanted leftovers!  I converted to receipe to serve 18 people and it worked out fabulous.  My family will be requesting this dish at every family gathering.  I already have been called by three family members making absolutely sure I will be making it for Christmas!

These were even better cold. I would leave the sweet potatoes "chunky" next time instead of whipping them. Great flavor!

I downloaded this recipe on Thanksgiving morning!  It was a great choice.  My husband agreed the praline part was good.  I accidentally sent home ALL of the leftovers of this dish with a guest!  I didn't separate it because I was going to keep it all to myself!  Boy was I disappointed the next day!!  My guest just asked for the recipe today!
